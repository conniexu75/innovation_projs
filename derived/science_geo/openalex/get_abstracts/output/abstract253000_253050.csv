Recent findings have implicated two proteins, Stim1 and Orai1, as having essential roles in store-operated Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane. However, transient overexpression of these proteins on their own results in little or no increase in store-operated entry. Here we demonstrate dramatic synergism between these two mediators; co-transfection of HEK293 cells with Stim1 and Orai1 results in an approximate 20-fold increase in store-operated Ca2+ entry and Ca2+-selective current. This demonstrates that these two proteins are limiting for both the signaling and permeation mechanisms for Ca2+-selective store-operated Ca2+ entry. There are three mammalian homologs of Orai1, and in expression experiments they all produced or augmented store-operated Ca2+ entry with efficacies in the order Orai1 > Orai2 > Orai3. Stim1 apparently initiates the signaling process by acting as a Ca2+ sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum. This results in rearrangement of Stim1 within the cell and migration toward the plasma membrane to regulate in some manner Orai1 located in the plasma membrane. However, we demonstrate that Stim1 does not incorporate in the surface membrane, and thus likely regulates or interacts with Orai1 at sites of close apposition between the plasma membrane and an intracellular Stim1-containing organelle.

Despite more than two decades of research, little is known about the activation mechanism for the channels responsible for this type of Ca2+ entry. Recently, based primarily on RNAi screens from either Drosophila or mammalian cells, two proteins have been identified as essential components in SOC influx: Stim1 (1Roos J. DiGregorio P.J.

Stim1 is thought to act as a sensor for Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum, or in that compartment of the endoplasmic reticulum responsible for signaling to store-operated channels. Zhang et al. (5Zhang S.L. Yu Y. Roos J. Kozak J.A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Stauderman K.A.

However, others have suggested that Stim1 may re-localize near the plasma membrane without inserting into the membrane upon Ca2+-store depletion (2Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T. Myers J.W.

Orai1 was first identified by Feske et al. (3Feske S. Gwack Y. Prakriya M. Srikanth S. Puppel S.H. Tanasa B. Hogan P.G. Lewis R.S. Daly M. Rao A. Nature. 2006; 441: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar) through a combined RNAi screen and analysis of gene mutations in patients suffering from severe combined immunodeficiency. The protein appears to be resident in the plasma membrane (3Feske S. Gwack Y. Prakriya M. Srikanth S. Puppel S.H. Tanasa B. Hogan P.G. Lewis R.S. Daly M. Rao A.

Science. 2006; 312: 1220-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar), and its molecular function has not yet been defined. However, Vig et al. (4Vig M. Peinelt C. Beck A. Koomoa D.L. Rabah D. Koblan-Huberson M. Kraft S. Turner H. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Science. 2006; 312: 1220-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar) suggest that Orai1 (which they designated as CRACM1) could function in the plasma membrane either as a component of the calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel, or as a regulator of CRAC channels. In the current study, we have sought to determine if Stim1 and Orai1 functionally interact by co-expressing them in HEK293 cells. Surprisingly, we find that the combination of Stim1 and Orai1 results in a substantial increase in SOC entry, suggesting that these proteins are limiting for, and may actually comprise both the activation as well as permeation mechanism for SOC influx. This is to our knowledge the first demonstration of an Icrac-like current produced by the ectopic expression of known genes. In addition to Orai1, Orai2 expression with Stim1 also enhanced SOC entry in these cells, however to a lesser extent. Although Orai3 alone or with Stim1 showed no elevation in current or Ca2+ entry, it did rescue the knockdown of Orai1 in HEK293 cells. In addition, we have investigated the movements and distribution of Stim1 and conclude that this protein translocates to the vicinity of the plasma membrane, where it presumably interacts with and activates Orai1, but Stim1 does not incorporate into the plasma membrane. Cell Culture—HEK293 cells, obtained from ATCC, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine and maintained in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. In preparation for cDNA or siRNA transfection, cells were transferred to 6-well plates and allowed to grow to ∼90% confluence. In preparation for Ca2+ measurements, cells were transferred onto 30-mm round glass coverslips (no. 1 thickness) as a 0.5 ml cell suspension (∼400,000 cells/ml) and allowed to attach for a period of 12 h. Additional DMEM was then added to the coverslip, and the cells maintained in culture for an additional 12-36 h before use in Ca2+ measurements. Plasmids—Full-length Stim1, Orai1, Orai2, and Orai3 cDNA plasmids were purchased from Origene in the pCMV6-XL5 (Stim1 and Orai2) and pCMV-XL4 (Orai1 and Orai3) vectors. The following mutations were made in both the native Stim1 plasmid from Origene as well as Stim1 with the yellow-enhanced fluorescent protein fused to the N terminus, obtained from Tobias Meyer, Stanford University. Single amino acid mutations to the putative EF-hand of Stim1 (D76A, D76N, and E87Q) as well as a multi-amino acid mutant (D76N/D78N) were made by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutations were all sequence-confirmed. The KIR-GFP plasmid was obtained from Deborah Burshtyn, University of Alberta. siRNA Knockdown—HEK293 cells were plated in a 6-well plate on day 1. On day 2, cells were transfected with siRNA (100 nm) against Stim1 (Dharmacon) or Orai1 (Invitrogen) using Metafectene (Biontex Laboratories GmbH, Martinsried/Planegg, Germany, 7 μl per well), and including siGLO (Dharmacon) as a marker. The sequence of the siRNA against Stim1 was: agaaggagcuagaaucucac; for Orai1 it was: cccuucggccugaucuuuaucgucu. After a 6-h incubation period, the medium bathing the cells was replaced with complete DMEM and maintained in culture. On day 3, siRNA treated cells were transfected with cDNA for Stim1 tagged with EYFP, or EYFP alone, as described below. On day 4, cells were transferred to 30-mm glass coverslips in preparation for Ca2+ measurements as described above, which were performed on day 5 or 6. cDNA Transfection—HEK293 cells were plated in a 6-well plate on day 1. On day 2, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen; 2 μl per well) with cDNA (0.5 μg/well) for EYFP, Orai1, Orai2, Orai3, or EYFP tagged Stim1 (a gift from Dr. Tobias Meyer) and mutant forms of Stim1. The latter constructs have a mutation in the putative EF-Hand region of the Stim1 molecule (described under “Results”). After a 6-h incubation period, the medium bathing the cells was replaced with complete DMEM and maintained in culture. On day 3, cDNA treated cells were transferred to 30-mm glass coverslips in preparation for Ca2+ measurements as described above, which were performed on day 4 or 5. In general, the concentration of plasmid used was 0.5 μg/well, except for EYFP (0.1 μg/well) Higher concentrations of plasmid (2.0 μg/well) were used in some of the experiments with Orai2 and 3, as indicated under “Results.” Single Cell Ca2+ Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were made in HEK293 cells loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive dye, fura-5F, as described previously (2Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T. Myers J.W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1235-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells plated on 30-mm round coverslips and mounted in a Teflon chamber were incubated in DMEM with 1 μm acetoxymethyl ester of fura-5F (fura-5F/AM, Molecular Probes) at 37 °C in the dark for 25 min. For [Ca2+]i measurements, cells were bathed in HEPES-buffered salt solution (HBSS: NaCl 120; KCl 5.4; Mg2SO4 0.8; HEPES 20; CaCl2 1.8; and glucose 10 mm, with pH 7.4 adjusted by NaOH) at room temperature. Nominally Ca2+- free solutions were HBSS with no added CaCl2. Fluorescence images of the cells were recorded and analyzed with a digital fluorescence imaging system (InCyt Im2, Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Changes in intracellular Ca2+ are represented by and expressed as the ratio of fura-5F fluorescence because of excitation at 340 nm and 380 nm (F340/F380). Before starting the experiment, regions of interests identifying transfected cells expressing the EYFP fluorescence tag were created by observing cells at a 530-nm emission wavelength and illuminated with 477-nm excitation light. Typically, 20 to 30 cells were monitored per experiment. In all cases, ratio values have been corrected for contributions by autofluorescence, which is measured after treating cells with 10 μm ionomycin and 20 mm MnCl2. Electrophysiology—Whole cell currents were investigated at room temperature (20-25 °C) in HEK293 cells using the patch clamp technique in the whole cell configuration. The standard extracellular recording solution contained (mm): 140 NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 0 -10 mm CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH to 7.4 with NaOH). Divalent-free solution (DVF) contained the same as above, except Ca2+ and Mg2+ were eliminated and 0.1 mm EGTA was added. Nominally Ca2+ free (NCF) external solution was also the same as above, except no Ca2+ was added. Fire-polished pipettes fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (WPI, Sarasota, FL) with 3-5 MΩ resistance were filled with (in mm): 145 cesium methanesulfonate, 10 BAPTA, 10 HEPES, and 8 MgCl2 (pH to 7.2 with CsOH). In some experiments, 100 μm inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) was directly added to the intracellular pipette solution, and 1 μm gadolinium (Gd3+) or 30 μm 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane (2APB) was added to the extracellular recording solution. External solution changes were made using a multibarrel perfusion pencil (Automate Scientific) placed adjacent to the cell under investigation. Voltage ramps (-100 mV to +100 mV) of 250 ms were recorded every 2 s immediately after gaining access to the cell, and the currents were normalized based on cell capacitance (mean = 14.4 ± 1.2 pF). Leak currents were subtracted by taking an initial ramp current before the store-operated currents developed and subtracting this from all subsequent ramp currents. Access resistance was typically between 5 and 10 MΩ. The currents were acquired using pCLAMP-9.2 (Axon Instruments) and analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments) and Origin 6 (Microcal) software. Confocal Microscopy—For experiments examining the intracellular distribution of Stim1, HEK293 cells, expressing EYFP-Stim1 or EYFP-Stim1 EF hand mutants, were prepared for confocal microscopy in a similar way as described for Ca2+ measurements. Cells plated on 30-mm round coverslips and mounted in a Teflon chamber were placed on the stage of a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with a 40× water immersion objective (N.A. 1.2). Images of EYFP were obtained with 488-nm excitation light from an argon ion Laser (Lasos T812 M24), and emission fluorescence selected with a 505-550-nm bandpass filter. Confocal images were collected with a pinhole set at 1 Airy unit (∼0.9-μm image thickness). For experiments examining surface expression of Stim1, HEK293 cells that had been transfected with cDNA encoding EYFP-Stim1, EYFP-Stim1-D76A, or EYFP-Stim1 in combination with Orai1 were plated onto glass coverslips and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were washed with Ca2+- free PBS prior to addition of either PBS containing 1.8 mm CaCl2 or Ca2+ -free PBS with 2 μm thapsigargin. Following a 15-min incubation period, cells were fixed by the addition of paraformaldehyde to a final concentration of 1.6%. Cells were incubated 10 min at room temperature and then washed with FACS buffer. Permeabilized cells were washed once for 3 min with FACS buffer supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by additional washes with FACS buffer to remove residual detergent. Cells were then stained with anti-EYFP antibody conjugated to Alexa 647 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Following three wash steps, coverslips were mounted onto slides using ProLong Gold Anti-fade mounting reagent (Molecular Probes). The mounting agent was allowed to set overnight prior to analysis on a Zeiss LSM 510 UV Meta confocal microscope. Background for antibody staining was determined by setting the gain setting just below the point where fluorescence in the 647-nm channel was visible in HEK293 cells transfected with EYFP cDNA. For intact, EYFP-Stim1-transfected samples, the gain was left at this level throughout the analysis. For permeabilized samples, the gain was adjusted downward until the image was just below the saturation point for all pixels. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM)—TIRFM was carried out using an Olympus (Melville, NY) IX2-RFAEVA-2 illumination system mounted on an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope as previously described (7Smyth J.T. Lemonnier L. Vazquez G. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 281: 11712-11720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Illumination was provided by a 488-nm argon ion laser (Melles Griot, Carlsbad, CA) directed through a fiber optic cable, and emitted fluorescence passed through a D525/50m filter (Chroma) before being captured by a Photometrics Cascade 512F cooled CCD (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ). Laser illumination was not toxic to cells, because HEK293 cells loaded with the Ca2+ dye Fluo-3 did not exhibit aberrant Ca2+ release or signs of degeneration when monitored with this system (data not shown). Materials—Thapsigargin was purchased from Alexis (San Diego, CA), fura-5F/AM from Molecular Probes. Co-expression of Stim1 and Orai1 Results in a Synergistic and Robust Increase in SOC Entry—Fig. 1 shows the results of experiments in which HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with EYFP-Stim1, Orai1, or both. Successfully transfected cells were identified by the fluorescence from EYFP-Stim1, or by co-transfected EYFP for control cells or cells transfected only with Orai1. SOC entry was assessed by examining the magnitude of the [Ca2+]i signal upon reintroduction of Ca2+ to cells previously treated with the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Graded additions of extracellular Ca2+ resulted in a graded elevation in [Ca2+]i. Overexpression of EYFP-Stim1 had little if any effect on Ca2+ entry assessed in this way. Surprisingly, overexpression of Orai1 significantly inhibited SOC entry. More importantly, co-expression of both EYFP-Stim1 with Orai1 resulted in a substantial increase in store-operated Ca2+ entry (Fig. 1). Similar synergism between expression of Stim1 and Orai1 was observed in experiments utilizing Ba2+ as a surrogate for Ca2+ (not shown). The large Ca2+ entry resulting from co-expression of EYFP-Stim1 and Orai1 was blocked by 1 μm Gd3+ or 30 μm 2APB, which is the expected pharmacological profile of store-operated channels (8Putney Jr., J.W. Mol. Interventions. 2001; 1: 84-94PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, co-expression of Stim2 with Orai1 resulted in responses resembling those with Orai1 alone, i.e. inhibition of entry (not shown). We examined whole cell currents in HEK293 cells transfected with these same constructs. In our hands, wild-type HEK293 cells do not reproducibly show detectable store-operated currents, and in other laboratories, these currents have been described as very small and are inconsistently detectable (4Vig M. Peinelt C. Beck A. Koomoa D.L. Rabah D. Koblan-Huberson M. Kraft S. Turner H. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Science. 2006; 312: 1220-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar, 9Bugaj V.

When we broke into HEK293 cells with pipettes containing 10 mm BAPTA and 100 μm IP3, we saw no consistent development of current in control cells (Fig. 2A) or in cells transfected with either EYFP-Stim1 (not shown) or Orai1 alone. However, in cells co-transfected with EYFP-Stim1 and Orai1, we observed very large inward currents, of the order of 300 -500 pA with 10 mm Ca2+ outside (Fig. 2, A and B). The currents developed rapidly with BAPTA and IP3 in the pipette (Fig. 2A), and after a delay when stores were depleted passively with BAPTA alone (Fig. 2B). These currents showed strong inward rectification and reversed at +50 mV, as expected for a calcium-selective channel (Fig. 2C). The current was fully blocked by 1 μm Gd3+ (Fig. 2), which at this concentration is believed to block only store-operated channels (11Broad L.M. Cannon T.R. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond. 1999; 517: 121-134Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 12Luo D. Broad L.M. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20186-20189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A hallmark of Icrac is that rapid removal of extracellular divalent cations causes a transient increase in current due to initial removal of Ca2+ block (13Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (661) Google Scholar) followed by a process of depotentiation involving loss of Ca2+ from external modulatory sites (14Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2D, the large currents observed in Orai1 + Stim1 expressing cells showed similar behavior upon removal of extracellular divalent cations. Finally, the IP3-activated current was transiently augmented by 5 μm 2APB and was completely blocked by 30 μm of this drug, which is a pharmacological hallmark of Icrac (15Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Physiol. (Lond. 2001; 536: 3-19Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2E). Although we did not consistently observe store-operated currents in our untransfected HEK293 cells, based on the value reported by Vig et al. (4Vig M. Peinelt C. Beck A. Koomoa D.L. Rabah D. Koblan-Huberson M. Kraft S. Turner H. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Science. 2006; 312: 1220-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar) of 0.5 pA/pF, the large Icrac-like currents observed with co-expression of Stim1 and Orai1 suggest an increase in current density of at least a factor of 20. Effects of Expression of Orai2 and Orai3—In addition to Orai1, mammalian cells express two additional homologous genes, Orai2 and Orai3 (3Feske S. Gwack Y. Prakriya M. Srikanth S. Puppel S.H. Tanasa B. Hogan P.G. Lewis R.S. Daly M. Rao A. Nature. 2006; 441: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). To determine if these genes also encoded components of an Icrac-like entry mechanism, we co-expressed each of these with Stim1 in the same manner as for Orai1. With this protocol, Orai2, like Orai1, inhibits Ca2+ entry on its own, and substantially augments thapsigargin-activated Ca2+ entry when co-expressed with Stim1 (Fig. 3, A and B); however, the increase in [Ca2+]i was consistently less than seen in the Orai1 experiments (Orai1 data are included in Fig. 3A for comparison). As for Orai1, this entry is blocked by 1 μm Gd3+ or 30 μm 2APB (Fig. 3, C and D). In the experiments in Fig. 3A, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg/well of the Orai2 containing plasmid, a similar concentration to that used for Orai1 experiments. In patch-clamp experiments, we found that currents were inconsistently observed with cells transfected in this manner. We thus increased the concentration of Orai2 plasmid to 2.0 μg/well, which resulted in larger [Ca2+]i increases (this is actually the concentration used for experiments in Fig. 3C) and consistently observed Icrac- like currents. Fig. 4 shows that overexpression of Orai2 and Stim1 results in currents somewhat smaller than for Orai1, although with similar properties. The currents were transiently increased in divalent-free solutions, and subsequently underwent depotentiation (Fig. 4B). The IV relationships for the Orai2 + Stim1 currents showed strong inward rectification, typical of Icrac-like currents (Fig. 4C). No such currents were observed following transfection with Orai2 alone (not shown). Expression of Orai3 alone failed to suppress SOC entry (not shown) and co-expression of Stim1 and Orai3 failed to produce increased thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ entry, or store-operated currents, even with 2.0 μg/well of plasmid (Fig. 5, A and B). The failure of Orai3 could mean that this particular protein has some function other than regulation or mediation of Ca2+ entry. Alternatively, it could be poorly expressed, or only function in conjunction with other players, for example in complexes with other Orai family members. However, because Orai3 alone did not suppress Ca2+ entry, we were able to obtain evidence that Orai3 can function in store-operated Ca2+ entry in RNAi rescue experiments. As shown in Fig. 5, C and D, knockdown of Orai1 by RNAi results in substantial abrogation of thapsigargin-activated Ca2+ entry, in confirmation of previous reports (3Feske S. Gwack Y. Prakriya M. Srikanth S. Puppel S.H. Tanasa B. Hogan P.G. Lewis R.S. Daly M. Rao A. Nature. 2006; 441: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 4Vig M. Peinelt C. Beck A. Koomoa D.L. Rabah D. Koblan-Huberson M. Kraft S. Turner H. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Science. 2006; 312: 1220-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar, 16Zhang S.L. Yeromin A.V. Zhang X.H. Yu Y. Safrina O. Penna A. Roos J. Stauderman K.A. Cahalan M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9357-9362Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). When we expressed Orai3 in cells following Orai1 knockdown, thapsigargin-activated Ca2+ entry was essentially restored to the control level (Fig. 5, C and D). We still did not see significant Ca2+ currents in these cells, consistent with the idea that entry was returned only to the control level. The ability of Orai3 to rescue Ca2+ entry following knockdown of Orai1 may indicate that Orai3 is expressed at a more modest (perhaps physiological) level than Orai1, or that it can function together with limited remaining Orai1. Additional experiments will be needed to distinguish among these, or other possibilities. Nonetheless, the clear augmentation of entry by Orai3 in this particular situation demonstrates that this gene product can also play a role in the generation or regulation of store-operated Ca2+ entry. In summary, we find that in expression experiments, all three Orai genes can generate or augment store-operated Ca2+ entry with efficacies in the order Orai1 > Orai2 > Orai3. How this apparent rank order relates to their function under conditions of physiological expression will require additional study. Stim1 Movements in Response to Ca2+ Store Depletion—We next sought to address the question of how Stim1 might regulate the complex leading to channel activation. Two ideas have been suggested; according to Liou et al. (2Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T. Myers J.W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1235-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar), Stim1 redistributes within the cell, approaching the plasma membrane, but does not incorporate into the plasma membrane. A contrasting idea put forth by Zhang et al. (5Zhang S.L. Yu Y. Roos J. Kozak J.A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Stauderman K.A. Cahalan M.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar) suggests that Stim1 actually traffics to, and is incorporated into the plasma membrane where it interacts with key players in the store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway. Also, Spassova et al. (17Spassova M. Soboloff J. He L.-P. Xu W. Dziadek M. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) presented evidence for a role of plasma membrane Stim1, but did not address the question of whether Stim1 moves into the plasma membrane upon store depletion, or is present there constitutively. By use of total internal reflected fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy with HEK293 cells transfected with EYFP-Stim1, we confirmed the observation made by Zhang et al. (5Zhang S.L. Yu Y. Roos J. Kozak J.A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Stauderman K.A. Cahalan M.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar) and by Liou et al. (2Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T.

We also carried out confocal imaging studies with this construct; consistent with previous findings (2Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T. Myers J.W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1235-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar), EYFP-Stim1 reorganizes from an apparent fibrillar or tubular form into discrete punctae in response to depletion of Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin (Fig. 6B).

https://openalex.org/W1992491411,"Hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau is a characteristic feature of neurodegenerative tauopathies including Alzheimer disease. Over-activation of proline-directed kinases, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), has been implicated in the aberrant phosphorylation of tau at proline-directed sites. In this study we tested the roles of Cdk5 and GSK3 in tau hyperphosphorylation in vivo using transgenic mice with p25-induced Cdk5 over-activation. We found that over-activation of Cdk5 in young transgenic animals does not induce tau hyperphosphorylation at sites recognized by the antibodies AT8, AT100, PHF-1, and TG3. In fact, we observed that Cdk5 over-activation leads to inhibition of GSK3. However, in old transgenic animals the inhibition of GSK3 is lost and results in increased GSK3 activity, which coincides with tau hyperphosphorylation at the AT8 and PHF-1 sites. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 in old transgenic mice by chronic treatment with lithium leads to a reduction of the age-dependent increase in tau hyperphosphorylation. Furthermore, we found that Cdk5, GSK3, and PP2A co-immunoprecipitate, suggesting a functional association of these molecules. Together, these results reveal the role of GSK3 as a key mediator of tau hyperphosphorylation, whereas Cdk5 acts as a modulator of tau hyperphosphorylation via the inhibitory regulation of GSK3. Furthermore, these findings suggest that disruption of regulation of GSK3 activity underlies tau hyperphosphorylation in neurodegenerative tauopathies. Hence, GSK3 may be a prime target for therapeutic intervention in tauopathies including Alzheimer disease."

https://openalex.org/W2121174368,"Testosterone plays a crucial role in neuronal function, but elevated concentrations can have deleterious effects. Here we show that supraphysiological levels of testosterone (micromolar range) initiate the apoptotic cascade. We used three criteria, annexin V labeling, caspase activity, and DNA fragmentation, to determine that apoptotic pathways were activated by testosterone. Micromolar, but not nanomolar, testosterone concentrations increased the response in all three assays of apoptosis. In addition, testosterone induced different concentration-dependent Ca2+ signaling patterns: at low concentrations of testosterone (100 nm), Ca2+ oscillations were produced, whereas high concentrations (1-10 μm) induced a sustained Ca2+ increase. Elevated testosterone concentrations increase cell death, and this effect was abolished in the presence of either inhibitors of caspases or the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R)-mediated Ca2+ release. Knockdown of InsP3R type 1 with specific small interfering RNA also abolished the testosterone-induced cell death and the prolonged Ca2+ signals. In contrast, knockdown of InsP3R type 3 modified neither the apoptotic response nor the Ca2+ signals. These results support our hypothesis that elevated testosterone alters InsP3R type 1-mediated intracellular Ca2+ signaling and that the prolonged Ca2+ signals lead to apoptotic cell death. These effects of testosterone on neurons will have long term effects on brain function.

These effects of testosterone on neurons will have long term effects on brain function. Neurosteroids have been implicated as components essential for the normal function of the central nervous system (1Gould E. McEwen B.S. Curr. Opin.

The gonadal steroid hormones are required for reproductive function, but androgens also affect areas of the brain that are not primarily involved in reproduction such as the hippocampus (5Kerr J.E. Allore R.J. Beck S.G. Handa R.J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3213-3221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), preoptic area, amygdala, and medial hypothalamic area (6Sar M. Lubahn D.B. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 3180-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). At physiological levels, androgens are involved in neuronal differentiation, neuroprotection, neuronal survival and development (7Hammond J. Le Q. Goodyer C. Gelfand M. Trifiro M. LeBlanc A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 8Matsumoto A. Arai Y. Urano A. Hyodo S. Horm.

These responses occur slowly (over hours) and are mediated through the intracellular androgen receptor. In the developing brain, androgens are capable of changing the ultrastructural characteristics of the neuronal plasma membrane with a relatively fast pace (10Tabori N.E. Stewart L.S. Znamensky V.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that nanomolar levels of testosterone induce rapid intracellular Ca2+ increases in neuroblastoma cells (within seconds), which begin as Ca2+ transients in the cytosol, propagate as waves of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and develop into an oscillatory pattern (12Estrada M. Uhlen P. Ehrlich B.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 119: 733-743Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These Ca2+ signals depend on an interplay between Ca2+ efflux from the endoplasmic reticulum through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ release channels (InsP3Rs) 4The abbreviations used are: InsP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; XTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide salt; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ac, N-acetyl; AFC, amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin; CHO, aldehyde; pNA, p-nitroanilide; 2-APB, 2-aminoethyl diphenylborate; siRNA, small interfering RNA.4The abbreviations used are: InsP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; XTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide salt; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ac, N-acetyl; AFC, amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin; CHO, aldehyde; pNA, p-nitroanilide; 2-APB, 2-aminoethyl diphenylborate; siRNA, small interfering RNA. and Ca2+ reuptake into the endoplasmic reticulum by Ca2+ pumps. This new testosterone-induced pathway in neuronal cells leads to neurite outgrowth (12Estrada M. Uhlen P. Ehrlich B.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 119: 733-743Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar), an essential event in neuronal differentiation (13Goldberg J.L. Barres B.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 579-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). These results suggest an important physiological mechanism for the action of testosterone in neurons at physiological concentrations. However, it is unknown how these cells respond to high plasma levels of this neurosteroid, generally administered exogenously to achieve an increase in muscle mass (14Bhasin S. Storer T.W. Berman N.

Med. 2004; 350: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). In vivo administration of large doses of androgens has been correlated with neurobehavioral changes like hyperexcitability, supra-aggressive nature, and suicidal tendencies (17Thiblin I. Lindquist O. Rajs J. J. Forensic Sci. 2000; 45: 16-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tirassa P. Thiblin I. Agren G. Vigneti E. Aloe L. Stenfors C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These behavioral changes could be the outward manifestation of neuronal damage resulting from exposure to high concentrations of testosterone.In this investigation, we evaluated the hypothesis that high concentrations of testosterone can induce deleterious effects in neurons. We show that high levels of testosterone initiate an apoptotic program in neuroblastoma cells. Apoptosis is the normal and controlled process of cell death (19Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Precise control of apoptosis is critical in many processes of life, including development and disease. The onset of apoptosis and its progression can be altered by both endogenous and exogenous insults (20Thorburn A. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is characterized by many physical, cellular, and physiological parameters, which include membrane blebbing, caspase activation, change in membrane potential, and DNA damage-associated nuclear deformation (19Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 21Bhuyan A.K. Varshney A. Mathew M.K. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Eldadah B.A. Faden A.I. J. Neurotrauma. 2000; 17: 811-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Prolonged elevated cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) concentrations can initiate the apoptotic program in many cell types (23Hajnoczky G. Davies E. Madesh M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 24Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar), including neurons (25Lipton S.A. Nicotera P. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The testosterone-induced apoptosis described here occurs through overactivation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling pathways. The progression into cell death could be attenuated by the addition of inhibitors of the InsP3R signaling pathway. Moreover, we found that InsP3R type 1, the predominant isoform of the InsP3R found in neurons (26Sharp A.H. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Blondel O. Sheppard C.A. Zhang C. Snyder S.H. Russell J.T. Ryugo D.K. Ross C.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 406: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), is the key integrator of the testosterone response in both normal and hyperstimulated Ca2+ signaling in neuroblastoma cells. It is this pathway that has been implicated in other pathophysiological conditions. For example, overstimulation of the apoptotic program in neurons has been associated with several neurological illnesses, such as Alzheimer disease (27Guo Q. Sopher B.L. Furukawa K. Pham D.G. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Verkhratsky A. Toescu E.C. J. Cell Mol.

Our results suggest that the responses to elevated testosterone can be compared with these pathophysiological conditions.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemical Reagents—Testosterone, 17β-estradiol, 2-aminoe-thoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), and the TOX-2 cell viability assay were purchased from Sigma. Fluo4-acetoxymethylester was acquired from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Caspase-cleavable peptides, Ac-DEVD-AFC and Ac-DEVD-CHO, were obtained from BD Biosciences. Cell-permeable forms of these peptides, colorigenic caspase substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA, and xestospongin-C were obtained from Calbiochem.Cell Cultures—The human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y; ATCC) was cultured in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 5% nonessential amino acids, 100 units of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in a 95% air, 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. Cells were grown on 22 × 22-mm gelatin-coated glass coverslips for the Ca2+ measurements or in 100-mm Petri dishes for biochemical and spectrochemical assays. Cultured cells were washed once with PBS before stimulation with testosterone (from concentrated stocks made in ethanol). The final ethanol concentration (<0.01%) had no effect on intracellular Ca2+ concentration or biochemical determinations (32Estrada M. Liberona J.L. Miranda M. Jaimovich E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E132-E139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Cell Viability—Cells were exposed to various concentrations of steroid hormones for different times. The number of viable cells was determined using a standard trypan blue exclusion assay. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then resuspended with EDTA. Cells were stained with 0.5% trypan blue, and the number of viable and nonviable cells was determined in a hemacytometer. Results are expressed as percentage viability (100 × number of viable cells/number of total cells per well) for each concentration of hormone tested. Cell viability was also assessed using the TOX-2 kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. This method determines the ability of metabolically active cells to reduce the yellow salt 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (XTT) to an orange formazan dye. Therefore, the conversion only occurs in living cells, and the amount of orange formazan formed directly correlates to the number of living cells. Neuroblastoma cells, grown in 60-mm Petri dishes in culture medium without phenol red and exposed to different steroid hormone concentrations, were washed with PBS and incubated with the XTT solution (final concentration 0.3 mg/ml), according to the kit specifications. After this incubation period, quantification of formazan dye formed was determined using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 450 nm minus the absorbance at 690 nm. Results are expressed as percentages with respect to controls (untreated cells).Ca2+ Imaging—Cells were loaded with 5 μm Fluo4-acetoxymethylester at 37 °C for 30 min in “imaging solution”: 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4. After loading, cells were washed twice with the imaging solution and placed on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100; Zeiss) connected to a laser scanning imaging system (LSM 510 META; Zeiss). Cells were stimulated with the hormone diluted in the imaging solution. A 488-nm excitation wavelength was focused through a 40× Apochromat water immersion objective lens (numerical aperture 1.2; Zeiss). In order to identify the cells expressing the siRNA, cells were cotransfected with DsRed-pCMV-cyto construct, which produced DsRed (red fluorescence protein), and were examined using fluorescence excitation at 568 nm. Regions of interest with the same pixel dimensions were identified and analyzed using Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The inhibitors were added during the dye incubation; times and concentrations are indicated under “Results.” The fluorescence intensity ratio (F/Fo) was plotted as a function of time.Annexin V Labeling—Cells were incubated in different concentrations of testosterone for 6 h. After treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS and once with fixation buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2) and were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V (0.5 μl per 100 μl of fixation buffer; BD Biosciences) for 15 min at room temperature. The fluorescence of fluorescein isothiocyanate was visualized by laser-scanning confocal microscopy (LSM 510 META; Zeiss). Annexin V fluorescence-positive cells were analyzed by the Image J program using the particle analysis macro (National Institutes of Health) and normalized to total cell count.DNA Fragmentation Assay—Neuroblastoma cells (1 × 106 cells) growing on 100-mm plates were washed once in PBS, harvested in 0.5 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K), and incubated at 55 °C for 30 min in the presence of 20 mg/ml RNase A. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and aqueous fractions were extracted with phenol/chloroform two to three times. Nucleic acids were precipitated with 0.1 volumes of 3 m sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol. Pelleted DNA was washed with 70% ethanol and was resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) kept at 37 °C. DNA was run on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, visualized with a UV transilluminator, recorded with a UVP gel-doc system, and analyzed by scanning densitometry.Assay of Proteolytic Activity of Caspases— 6 h after incubation with 100 nm to 10 μm testosterone, 1 × 106 neuroblastoma cells were washed with PBS and collected in cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10% sucrose and 1% Triton X-100). Following removal of cell debris and mitochondria from the lysate by centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted 2-fold with PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol. Ac-DEVD-AFC (at the final concentration of 15 μm), dissolved in Me2SO, was added to the mixture, and the sample was incubated for another 30 min. The mixture was then transferred to a quartz 1-cm square cuvette, and AFC fluorescence (excitation, 400 nm; emission, 505 nm) was measured (Quantamaster spectrofluorometer; Photon Technology International). For colorimetric measurement of caspase activity, Ac-DEVD-pNA (Calbiochem) was added at a final concentration of 200 μm to lysates generated from identical numbers of cells under different experimental conditions. Caspase activity was monitored as optical absorbance at 405 nm (Spectronic Genesys2 spectrophotometer) in a time-dependent manner. In the caspase inhibition experiments, 200 nm Ac-DEVD-CHO (BD Biosciences) was added to the mixture prior to Ac-DEVD-AFC or Ac-DEVD-pNA for 30 min.Western Blot—Cells lysates containing 40 μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE in a 4-20% linear gradient followed by electrophoretic transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for 3 h at 400 mA. The following primary antibodies and their dilution were used: anti-InsP3R type 1 (1:2,000; custom produced by Research Genetics), anti-InsP3R type 3 (1:1,000; BD Biosciences), ERK2 (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000; Bio-Rad) for 2 h at room temperature, the bands were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). Membranes were stripped and reprobed with ERK2 antibody, which was used as a sample loading control. Blots were quantified by scanning densitometry.siRNA—siRNAs for InsP3R type 1 and type 3 were kindly provided by Dr. M. Nathanson (Yale University). The siRNA templates were obtained from Ambion, and the sequence was AAAGCACCAGCAGCTACAACTCCTGTCTC of the human InsP3R type 1 and AAACAAGTTTGCCAGCACCAT for InsP3R type 3. Transfection of cells with siRNA was performed using RNAiFect (Qiagen), and down-regulation of either type 1 or type 3 InsP3R was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis.Statistics—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Colorimetrical measurements of caspase activity were fit to a linear equation to estimate the rate of activation. In order to compare the difference between basal and poststimulated points, we carried out analysis of variance, and the statistic differences were determined by the Bonferroni post-test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSHigh Concentration of Testosterone Induces Neurotoxicity— Previously we found that physiological concentrations of testosterone (nanomolar range) induced neuronal differentiation in neuroblastoma cells (12Estrada M. Uhlen P. Ehrlich B.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 119: 733-743Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but it was not clear that supraphysiological levels of this hormone (micromolar range) would have the same effect. Therefore, we treated neuroblastoma cells with different concentrations of testosterone and compared the effect on several parameters, including cell survival. When treated with low concentrations of testosterone (100 nm), cell viability did not change to any appreciable extent over the time range studied (Fig. 1A). Exposure of the cells to 1 μm testosterone induced a significant decrease in cell viability over 24 h. At 10 μm, testosterone was even more lethal (Fig. 1A). To confirm the results determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay, we monitored the effect of testosterone using the XTT cell viability assay. The response after 12 h of treatment was selected for comparison, because the higher concentrations of testosterone (1 and 10 μm) induced a significant deleterious effect at this time point using the previous assay. As predicted, 100 nm testosterone did not affect cell viability, whereas 1 and 10 μm testosterone significantly decreased cell viability (Fig. 1B). Using a similar range of concentrations of estrogen (17β-estradiol), we saw no effect on cell viability, indicating that the decrease in cell viability was specifically triggered by high concentrations of testosterone (Fig. 1B).High Concentrations of Testosterone Induce Apoptosis—Cell viability as determined using either trypan blue exclusion or XTT methods does not discriminate between cell death by apoptosis or necrosis. To identify the mechanism of cell death induced by testosterone, we examined annexin V labeling, caspase activation, and DNA laddering, all markers of apoptosis. Untreated cells did not show fluorescence due to annexin V labeling (Fig. 2A), whereas staurosporine (1 μm), a well established inducer of apoptosis, produced high levels of annexin V-positive cells, depicted in green (Fig. 2B). In the bright field image, it is possible to observe the morphological changes induced by staurosporine (Fig. 2B; superimposed images are shown in the right panel). When neuroblastoma cells were exposed to 100 nm testosterone, very few annexin V-positive cells were detected after 6 h of incubation (Fig. 2C; 4 ± 1%, n = 780 cells). Elevated concentrations of testosterone significantly increased the number of annexin V-positive cells: 21 ± 3% for 1 μm (n = 834 cells; p < 0.05) and 34 ± 8 for 10 μm (n = 600 cells; p < 0.01) testosterone were annexin V-positive (Fig. 2, D and E), where p values are calculated for treatment as compared with the control. These percentages for apoptotic cell death are consistent with the number of dead cells identified by the cell viability assay. Moreover, bright field images also show morphological changes associated with apoptosis; cells have plasma membrane blebs and were more round in shape with loss of their processes (Fig. 2, D and E). To further confirm the specificity of the response to testosterone, cells were exposed to high concentrations of estrogen (1-10 μm). There was no significant labeling of annexin V detected (data not shown), indicating that the apoptotic death pathway was specifically activated by testosterone.FIGURE 2Effect of testosterone on annexin V labeling in neuroblastoma cells. Cells were exposed to different concentrations of testosterone and the fluorescent apoptotic marker, annexin V, was visualized by confocal microscopy. A, untreated cells did not show fluorescence, and in the bright field image the integrity of the cells was observed. B, staurosporine was used as a positive control to maximally induce apoptosis. Cells induced with 1 μm staurosporine displayed a high fluorescence with a marked change in the cellular morphology. C-E, cells were exposed to three concentrations of testosterone for 12 h, and the annexin V-positive labeling was determined. C, at 100 nm testosterone, few cells were positive to annexin V, and the cell morphology did not change when compared with the control cells. At 1 μm (D) and 10 μm (E) testosterone, an increase in the number of fluorescent cells was observed. In the bright field images, cells were much rounder in shape with loss of their process. For each concentration, at least 1000 cells were counted. *, p < 0.05.

We observed that 1 and 10 μm testosterone induced considerable DNA damage in neuroblastoma cells within 6 h (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 5), whereas treatment with 100 nm testosterone for the same duration did not induce DNA damage (Fig. 3A, lane 3). To be certain that the death of neuroblastoma cells is indeed due to a canonical apoptotic pathway, it is necessary to show that testosterone activates aspartate-specific proteases (caspases) (34Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of neuroblastoma cells with the cell-permeable caspase inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO with 16 N-terminal amino acid residues of the signal peptide of Kaposi fibroblast growth factor that confers cell permeability to the peptide) abolishes the testosterone effect on cell viability at both concentrations tested earlier (Fig. 3B). To directly follow caspase activity, the hydrolysis of a specific fluorogenic substrate, Ac-DEVD-AFC, in cell-free extracts prepared from neuroblastoma cells was recorded after cells were treated with testosterone. The steadystate fluorescence emission spectrum of the mitochondria-free extract (Fig. 3C), recorded after the addition of Ac-DEVD-AFC, indicates hydrolysis of the substrate and release of the AFC fluorophore. Prior addition of the caspase inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, competitively inhibits AFC release (Fig. 3C), suggesting the specific activation of aspartate protease(s). The cell-free extracts prepared from untreated neuroblastoma cells produced no caspase activity. In addition, the time course of caspase activation as a function of increasing concentrations of testosterone was monitored by using a colorimetric caspase substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA. There was an increase in caspase activity in cells treated with either 1 or 10 μm testosterone, whereas treatment with 100 nm testosterone elicited caspase activity comparable with that of untreated cells (Fig. 3D). All three characteristic parameters, annexin V labeling, DNA fragmentation, and caspase activation, were induced by treatment with testosterone, supporting the conclusion that cells treated with high levels of testosterone (micromolar concentrations) die by initiation of the apoptotic cascade.FIGURE 3DNA fragmentation and assay of caspase activity in neuroblastoma cells. A, cells were treated with three concentrations of testosterone (Testo) for 6 h, and DNA fragmentation was assessed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. B, neuroblastoma cell viability was determined by an XTT assay. Cells were preincubated with the cell-permeable caspase inhibitor and exposed to 1 μm or 10 μm testosterone for 12 h. C, the fluorescence spectrum, recorded 30 min after the addition of Ac-DEVD-AFC to the extract prepared from 1μm testosterone-induced cells. Ac-DEVD-AFC was added to a final concentration of 150 nm. The caspase-dependent release of AFC following hydrolysis of the substrate is monitored upon excitation at 400 nm. A distinctive emission peak was observed between 475 and 505 nm. The extracts were prepared from 1 × 106 cells ∼6 h after treatment with testosterone (black line) or from cells without any treatment (gray line). The addition of the caspase inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO competitively blocked the AFC release. Lysates from the testosterone-treated cells that were incubated first with Ac-DEVD-CHO and than subjected to the same treatment as in C did not exhibit the AFC release (dotted line). D, concentration dependence of testosterone on caspase activation. For these experiments, a colorigenic substrate of caspase, Ac-DEVD-pNA, was used. Lysates generated from cells treated with 100 nm (▴), 1 μm (□), and 10 μm (•) testosterone were incubated with the substrate, and the pNA absorbance was plotted as a function of time. Lysates from untreated cells were used as negative control (○). Data points were fit to a straight line (gray lines) to calculate the rate of caspase activation (1.1 ± 0.05/s and 1.4 ± 0.02/s for 1 and 10 μm testosterone treatments, respectively). The same amount of protein was used in each assay.

https://openalex.org/W2011490067,"Phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs) are a major class of glycolipids in all mycobacteria. AcPIM2, a dimannosyl PIM, is both an end product and a precursor for polar PIMs, such as hexamannosyl PIM (AcPIM6) and the major cell wall lipoglycan, lipoarabinomannan (LAM). The mannosyltransferases that convert AcPIM2 to AcPIM6 or LAM are dependent on polyprenol-phosphate-mannose (PPM), but have not yet been characterized. Here, we identified a gene, termed pimE that is present in all mycobacteria, and is required for AcPIM6 biosynthesis. PimE was initially identified based on homology with eukaryotic PIG-M mannosyltransferases. PimE-deleted Mycobacterium smegmatis was defective in AcPIM6 synthesis, and accumulated the tetramannosyl PIM, AcPIM4. Loss of PimE had no affect on cell growth or viability, or the biosynthesis of other intracellular and cell wall glycans. However, changes in cell wall hydrophobicity and plasma membrane organization were detected, suggesting a role for AcPIM6 in the structural integrity of the cell wall and plasma membrane. These defects were corrected by ectopic expression of the pimE gene. Metabolic pulse-chase radiolabeling and cell-free PIM biosynthesis assays indicated that PimE catalyzes the α1,2-mannosyl transfer for the AcPIM5 synthesis. Mutation of an Asp residue in PimE that is conserved in and required for the activity of human PIG-M resulted in loss of PIM-biosynthetic activity, indicating that PimE is the catalytic component. Finally, PimE was localized to a distinct membrane fraction enriched in AcPIM4–6 biosynthesis. Taken together, PimE represents the first PPM-dependent mannosyl-transferase shown to be involved in PIM biosynthesis, where it mediates the fifth mannose transfer."

In various animal models and in humans FFA can stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis. Although the in vivo role of FFA in hepatic gluconeogenesis has been clearly established, the intracellular role of FFA and related signaling pathway remain unclear in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenic gene transcription. In this study, we have identified p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) as a critical signaling component in FFA-induced transcription of key gluconeogenic genes. We show in primary hepatocytes that both mid- and long-chain fatty acids (saturated or unsaturated) could activate p38 and increase levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator α (PGC-1α) gene transcripts. The FFA-induced expression of PEPCK and PGC-1α genes and gluconeogenesis in isolated hepatocytes could be blocked by the inhibition of p38. Furthermore, PGC-1α phosphorylation by p38 was necessary for FFA-induced activation of the PEPCK promoter. Additionally, FFA stimulated phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) through p38. The overexpression of the dominant-negative CREB prevented FFA-induced activation of the PEPCK promoter. Finally, we show that FFA activation of p38 requires protein kinase Cδ. Together, our results indicate that p38 plays a critical role in FFA-induced transcription of gluconeogenic genes, and the known gluconeogenic regulators, PGC-1α and CREB, are also integral parts of FFA-stimulated transcription of gluconeogenic genes.

Hepatic gluconeogenesis, which is the de novo synthesis of glucose from non-hexose carbohydrate precursors, is essential for maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting. However, excessive gluconeogenesis is a major source of hyperglycemia in both type I and type II diabetes (1Magnusson I. Rothman D.L. Katz L.D. Shulman R.G. Shulman G.I. J. Clin.

Schmoll D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E685-E692Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar for review). The function of these enzymes is mainly regulated at their transcriptional levels by the pancreatic hormones insulin and glucagon (3Barthel A. Schmoll D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E685-E692Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Insulin suppresses, whereas glucagon stimulates, transcription of these gluconeogenic genes in the liver (3Barthel A. Schmoll D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E685-E692Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In addition to hormonal control, hepatic gluconeogenesis has been shown to be directly regulated by some nutrients such as free fatty acids (FFA) (see Refs. 4Boden G.

FFA levels are often increased in obese individuals in both the fed and fasted states and have been implicated as critical players in the progression of obesity to type II diabetes (6Baldeweg S.E.

The indirect role of FFA is through insulin secretion and insulin action. FFA-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic islets suppresses gluconeogenesis (see Refs. 13Wyne K.L. Am. J.

But on the other hand, exposure of the liver to FFA can desensitize insulin signaling and dampen its suppression of gluconeogenesis, with the net effect of elevating hepatic gluconeogenesis (15Bevilacqua S.

First, FFA promotes gluconeogenesis by serving as a source of substrates and energy, including acetyl-CoA, NADH, and ATP. Second, FFA may directly regulate gluconeogenesis through transcription of key gluconeogenic genes (see Ref. 26Lam T.K. Carpentier A. Lewis G.F. van de Werve G. Fantus I.G. Giacca A. Am. J.

In particular, p38 plays a regulatory role in the function of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α).

In this study, we examined the role of p38 in FFA induction of gluconeogenic gene expression in hepatocytes. Our results show that FFA stimulated phosphorylation of p38 and transcription of PGC-1α, PEPCK, and G6Pase genes. The inhibition of p38 blocked FFA-induced transcription of PGC-1α and PEPCK genes and gluconeogenesis in isolated hepatocytes. Together, we have identified p38 as a mediator of FFA-induced transcription of hepatic gluconeogenic genes, and have provided new insight into understanding of fatty acid regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis.

Isolation of Primary Hepatocytes—Primary hepatocytes were isolated from C57BL/6 mice as previously described (39Seglen P.O. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1979; 5: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). (All the mice used for isolation of hepatocytes were fed under normal chow diet and regular schedule unless otherwise noted.) Briefly, under anesthesia with pentobarbital (intraperitoneal, 30 mg/kg body weight), livers were perfused with Ca2+-free Hanks' balanced solution (Invitrogen) at 5 ml/min for 8 min, followed by continuous perfusion with serum-free Williams' medium containing collagenase (Worthington, type II, 50 units/ml, Invitrogen), HEPES (10 mm), and NaOH (0.004 n) at 5 ml/min for 12 min. Hepatocytes were harvested and purified with Percoll. The viability of hepatocytes was examined with trypan blue exclusion. Only cell isolates with viability >5% were used. Hepatocytes were inoculated into collagen-coated 6-well plates (5 × 105/well) in Williams' medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and were incubated for 24 h before any experimentation. Preparation of FFA and Treatment of Hepatocytes with FFA—FFA solutions were prepared as previously described (40Nguyen M.T. Satoh H. Favelyukis S. Babendure J.L. Imamura T. Sbodio J.I. Zalevsky J.

Briefly, palmitate and capric acids were dissolved with methanol and then diluted with DMEM medium (containing 5.5 mm glucose) to 10 mm. Oleate, linoleate, and caproic acid were all purchased as liquid solutions, and were freshly diluted with DMEM medium (containing 5.5 mm glucose) to 100 mm. The serum-free DMEM media used for the treatment of cells with FFA were supplemented with 5.5 mm glucose and 2% FFA-free bovine albumin (BSA). Transfection of Hepatocytes—Primary hepatocytes were transfected as previously described (36Cao W.H. Collins Q.F. Becker T.C. Robidoux J. Lupo J.E. G. Xiong Y. Daniel K. Floering L. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42731-42737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were settled down in Williams' medium for 24 h before the transfection. Hepa1c1c7 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmid DNAs were introduced into primary hepatocytes and Hepa1c1c7 cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The transfection efficiency was monitored by introducing an identical amount of green fluorescent protein plasmid DNA into the control cells simultaneously, followed by observation under a fluoresce microscope. Approximately 50% of cells were transfected. Measurement of Glucose Production in Primary Hepatocytes—Primary hepatocytes were isolated from mice, which had been fasted for 24 h to deplete glycogen in the liver. Glucose production from the primary hepatocytes was measured as previously described (41Zhou H. Song X. Briggs M. Violand B. Salsgiver W. Gulve E.A. Luo Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed three times with warm phosphate-buffered saline to remove glucose and pre-treated with 5 μm SB (30 min) as noted, followed by the treatment with 0.5 mm oleate (4 h) in the glucose-free medium containing gluconeogenic substrates (20 mm sodium lactate and 2 mm sodium pyruvate). Glucose concentrations were determined with a glucose assay kit from Roche Applied Science (cat. no. 0716251) and normalized to the cellular protein concentrations. Total glucose production was derived from both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glucose production from glycogenolysis was measured in the absence of gluconeogenic substrates. The amount of glucose production by gluconeogenesis is defined as the difference between total glucose production and glycogenolysis. Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting analyses were performed as previously described (29Cao W. Medvedev A.V. Daniel K.W. Collins S. J. Biol.

Briefly, cell lysates were prepared by homogenization and sonication, followed by addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Aliquots (5 μg/well) were resolved with mini Tris-glycine gradient gels (4–20%, Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Levels of phosphorylated and total p38 or phosphorylated CREB were detected with a 1:1,000 dilution of each specific antiserum, followed by incubation with a 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (RPN5783, Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence bands were visualized with a Typhoon PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). RNA Isolation, Semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and TaqMan Real-time PCR—Total RNAs from hepatocytes were prepared by using RNA purification kits from Qiagen. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR reactions were performed according to the manuals from the manufacturer. Real-time RT-PCR TaqMan probes and reaction agents were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Reactions were performed according to manuals from the manufacturer. Catalogue numbers for the probes were as follows: PEPCK (Mm00440636-m1), G6Pase (Mm00839363-m1), and PGC-1α (Ahs00173304-m1). Introduction of siRNA Duplexes into Primary Hepatocytes—The siRNA duplexes were introduced into primary hepatocytes as previously described (31Robidoux J. Cao W.H. Quan Q. Daniel K.W. Moukdar F.

After an overnight fast plasma levels of FFA fluctuate between 350 and 740 μm and can reach 1–2.5 mm during prolonged fasting and in diabetes, in which hepatic gluconeogenesis is elevated (43Ruderman N.

Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and we have recently reported that p38 plays a key role in glucagon-induced hepatic gluconeogenesis (36Cao W.H. Collins Q.F. Becker T.C. Robidoux J. Lupo J.E. G. Xiong Y. Daniel K. Floering L. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42731-42737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that FFA might activate p38 to induce hepatic gluconeogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the effect of unsaturated FFA on p38 activation in primary hepatocytes. As shown in Fig. 1, both oleate (monounsaturated, long chain) and linoleate (double-unsaturated, long chain) stimulated p38 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. Next, the role of saturated FFA in p38 activation was examined. As shown in Fig. 2, palmitate (long chain) and capric acid (mid chain) could both stimulate p38 phosphorylation, whereas caproic acid (short chain) failed to do so. Together, these results suggest that both mid- and long-chain FFA (saturated or unsaturated) can stimulate phosphorylation of p38 in primary hepatocytes.FIGURE 2p38 activation by saturated FFA in primary hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes were isolated and cultured as detailed under “Materials and Methods” and were treated for 20 min with increasing amounts of palmitate (A and B), capric acid (C and D), or caproic acid (E and F) in serum-free DMEM media containing 5.5 mm glucose and 2% FFA-free BSA. Levels of p38 in cell lysates were detected by immunoblotting with antisera against p38 (p38-T) or phospho-p38 (p38-P). Results of p38-P were normalized to p38-T, and represent three independent experiments. *, p < 0.05 compared with 0 mm palmitate; #, p < 0.01 compared with 0 mm capric acid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FFA Induces Gluconeogenesis in a p38-dependent Manner—Although the role of FFA in hepatic gluconeogenesis has been well established (15Bevilacqua S.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the direct role of FFA on gluconeogenesis has not been determined in primary hepatocytes. Therefore, we treated isolated primary hepatocytes with oleate in the presence or absence of p38 inhibition with SB. (Oleate is one of the most abundant FFA in blood (48Bysted A. Holmer G. Lund P. Sandstrom B. Tholstrup T. Eur. J. Clin. Nutr. 2005; 59: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).) As shown in Fig. 3, oleate promoted glucose production via gluconeogenesis in primary hepatocytes but was blocked by the inhibition of p38. These results indicate that FFA can directly stimulate gluconeogenesis in isolated hepatocytes through activation of p38. To determine the role of FFA in transcription of gluconeogenic genes, isolated hepatocytes were treated with increasing amounts of FFA, followed by measuring transcripts of key gluconeogenic genes. As shown in Fig. 4, the effect of oleate on expression of PEPCK and G6Pase genes was biphasic. Specifically, oleate elevated levels of both PEPCK and G6Pase transcripts at 50 μm, but this elevation was reduced to a level, which is still significantly higher than the basal one (p < 0.05), at 500 μm, followed by another increase at 1000 μm. We repeatedly observed this biphasic effect of oleate, but we have not been able to explain this phenomenon yet. Capric acid started to increase levels of PEPCK and G6Pase transcripts at 50 μm, and this increase continued at 100 μm for PEPCK and 500 μm for G6Pase. Elevation of PEPCK and G6Pase transcripts by capric acid started to decrease when concentrations of capric acid reached 500 μm (for PEPCK) or 1000 μm (for G6Pase). The effect of palmitate (saturated FFA) on PEPCK and G6Pase genes were significantly milder in comparison to oleate and capric acid. Palmitate started moderately to increase levels of PEPCK and G6Pase transcripts only at high concentrations (≥500 μm). Together, these results indicate that various FFAs can directly elevate levels of gluconeogenic gene transcripts at different concentrations in primary hepatocytes. To determine the role of p38 in FFA-induced elevation of gluconeogenic gene transcripts, primary hepatocytes were treated with oleate in the presence or absence of p38 inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 5, oleate increased levels of both PEPCK and G6Pase transcripts. The increase in PEPCK transcripts was blocked by the inhibition of p38 with either SB or dominant-negative p38 (dn-p38), whereas, interestingly, levels of G6Pase transcripts were not affected by the blockade of p38. Similar results were observed when palmitate instead of oleate was used (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that FFA induction of the rate-limiting enzyme, PEPCK, is p38-dependent, whereas FFA induction of the G6Pase gene is independent of p38. To further investigate the role of p38 in FFA-induced elevation of gluconeogenic gene transcripts, the PEPCK promoter was introduced into Hepa1c1c7 hepatoma cells, which were subsequently treated with oleate in t"

The ribosomal proteins L5, L11, and L23 can block this loop by inhibiting MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation in response to ribosomal stress. Here, we show that L11, but not L5 and L23, leads to a drastic accumulation of ubiquitinated and native MDM2. This effect is dependent on the ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2, but not p53, and requires the central MDM2 binding domain (residues 51–108) of L11. We further show that L11 inhibited 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation of ubiquitinated MDM2 in vitro and consistently prolonged the half-life of MDM2 in cells. These results suggest that L11, unlike L5 and L23, differentially regulates the levels of ubiquitinated p53 and MDM2 and inhibits the turnover and activity of MDM2 through a post-ubiquitination mechanism.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcription factor activated in response to stress to induce expression of its target genes. The proteins encoded by these genes then mediate multiple cellular responses, such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, differentiation, cell senescence, or DNA repair (1Oren M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Also, p53 can directly trigger mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage (2Dumont P. Leu J.I.

The tumor suppression function of p53 is well reflected in the fact that more than half of human tumors harbor mutations in the p53 gene, and many others retain impaired function of the p53 pathway (5Vogelstein B.

Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar). The mdm2 gene itself is a downstream target of p53, thus forming a tight autoregulatory feedback loop (9Barak Y. Juven T.

Consistent with this notion, gene amplification and overexpression of MDM2 have also been shown in a variety of tumors, particularly in soft tissue sarcomas, lymphomas, and breast and lung cancers (12Momand J.

One example of this regulation is alternative reading frame (ARF) (p14ARF in human, p19ARF in mouse)-mediated inhibition of this loop in response to overexpression of oncogenes such as c-Myc and RAS (17Palmero I. Pantoja C. Serrano M. Nature. 1998; 395: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 18Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F.

Also, in response to DNA-damaging agents, N-terminal serine/threonine phosphorylation at the MDM2 binding domain of p53 prevents MDM2-p53 interaction and activates p53 (19Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S.

Hence, the MDM2-p53 loop presents as a central regulatory point for the cellular response to a multitude of environmental as well as internal stressors. Increasing evidence shows that the MDM2-p53 feedback loop can also be regulated by ribosomal stress. Fine coordination between ribosomal biogenesis and other cellular functions such as the cell cycle and differentiation is important for normal cell growth (24Rudra D. Warner J.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2431-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 25Moss T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Impeding ribosomal biogenesis would generate ribosomal stress that activates p53 to stop cell growth. Examples of such stress include inhibition of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis and processing by a low dose (<5 nm) of actinomycin D or overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of the rRNA processing factor Bop1 (26Ashcroft M. Taya Y. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 27Pestov D.G. Strezoska Z. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell.

Cancer. 2003; 3: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others reported that ribosomal proteins L5, L11, and L23 interacted with MDM2 and inhibited the MDM2-p53 feedback loop in response to ribosomal stress, such as treatment with low dose actinomycin D, serum starvation, or possibly small interference RNA-induced reduction of L23 (29Zhang Y.

Interestingly, these L proteins as well as the tumor suppressor protein ARF are primarily nucleolar proteins. Disruption of the nucleolus appears to be a common event in stress-induced p53 activation pathways (35Rubbi C.P. Milner J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6068-6077Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Thus, releasing small protein molecules such as the ribosomal L proteins from the nucleolus leads to p53 activation in response to ribosomal stress. Although ectopic expression of L5, L11, or L23 can inhibit MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation (29Zhang Y. Wolf G.W. Bhat K. Jin A. Allio T. Burkhart W.A. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), the detailed mechanisms underlying this effect remain undetermined. Also, little is known about the effect of these L proteins on MDM2 stability and ubiquitination. We have begun to address these issues by performing a series of cellular and biochemical analyses. In this study, we found that unlike L5 and L23, which drastically inhibited ubiquitination of both p53 and MDM2, L11 slightly inhibited MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination but markedly increased the ubiquitinated species and the steady-state level of MDM2 in cells. This effect was dependent on the ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2, but not p53, and required the central MDM2 -binding domain of L11. Interestingly, L11 inhibited proteasome-mediated degradation of ubiquitinated MDM2 in vitro. These results suggest that L11 differentially regulates the levels of ubiquitinated p53 and MDM2 through a post-ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent mechanism.

His-tagged L11, L5, and L23 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified through a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA, Qiagen) column as previously described (32Dai M.S. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44475-44482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Purified rabbit ubiquitin activating enzyme (UBA) E1, purified human recombinant E2 (UbcH5a), and recombinant human ubiquitin were purchased from Boston Biochem. Cotransfection, Immunoblot, and Co-immunoprecipitation Analyses—H1299, U2OS, or p53–/–/mdm2–/– MEFs cells were transfected with plasmids as indicated in each figure legend using Lipofectin following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection and lysed in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Equal amounts of clear cell lysate were used for immunoblot analysis as described previously (33Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was conducted using antibodies as indicated in the figure legends and described previously (33Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Beads were washed with lysis buffer twice, once with SNNTE buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 500 mm NaCl, and 5% sucrose), and once with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate). Bound proteins were detected by immunoblot using antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—In vivo ubiquitination assays were conducted as previously described (33Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Briefly, H1299 cells or p53–/–/mdm2–/– MEFs (60% confluence/100-mm plate) were transfected with combinations of the following plasmids as indicated in the figure legends: His6-ubiquitin (2 μg), p53 (1 μg), HA-MDM2 (2 μg), FLAG-L5 (2 μg), FLAG-L11 (2 μg), FLAG-L23 (2 μg), V5-ARF (2 μg) using Lipofectin (for H1299 cells), or Lipofectamine 2000 (for p53–/–/mdm2–/– MEFs) (Invitrogen). For inhibition of proteasome-mediated protein degradation, the cells were treated with 20 μm MG132 for 8 h before harvest. Forty-eight hours after transfection cells from each plate were harvested and split into two aliquots, one for immunoblot and the other for ubiquitination assays. Cell pellets were lysed in buffer I (6 m guanidinium-HCl, 0.1 mol/liter Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mmol/liter β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated with Ni-NTA beads at room temperature for 4 h. Beads were washed once each with buffer I, buffer II (8 mol/liter urea, 0.1 mol/liter Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mmol/liter β-mercaptoethanol), and buffer III (8 mol/liter urea, 0.1 mol/liter Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 6.3), 10 mmol/liter β-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were eluted from the beads in buffer IV (200 mmol/liter imidazole, 0.15 mol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 30% (v/v) glycerol, 0.72 mol/liter β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% (w/v) SDS). Eluted proteins were analyzed by immunoblot with monoclonal anti-p53 (DO-1), anti-HA, or anti-MDM2 (2A10) antibodies. In Vitro Ubiquitination Reactions—MDM2 in vitro auto-ubiquitination reactions were performed in ubiquitination buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.05% TritonX-100, freshly added 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) with 100 ng of UBA-E1, 25 ng of UbcH5a, and 5 ng of ubiquitin and were incubated for 120 min at 37 °C. A total of 10 ng of purified FLAG-MDM2 was used in each reaction. The mixture was either resolved by a SDS-PAGE gel followed by immunoblot using anti-MDM2 antibody or subjected to proteasome-dependent degradation assays. In Vitro 26 S Proteasome-dependent Degradation Assay—A total of 1 μg of purified 26 S proteasome (human erythrocytes, BIOMOL) preincubated with proteasome inhibitors (10 μm MG132, 10 μm lactacystin, 10 μm clasto-lactacystin-β-lactone) for 30 min at 4 °C where indicated was added to ubiquitination reactions along with 3 mm Mg-ATP (Boston Biochem) and further incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. To test the effect of L11, L5, and L23 on proteasome-dependent degradation of MDM2, ubiquitinated MDM2 was preincubated with purified L11, L5, and L23 protein for 30 min at 4 °C in ubiquitination buffer before the addition to the degradation reaction. Differential Effect of L11, L5, L23, and ARF on the Levels of Ubiquitinated MDM2 and p53—In an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms by which ribosomal proteins regulate the stability of MDM2 and p53, we determined the effect of ribosomal proteins L5, L11, and L23 on the ubiquitination of MDM2 and p53 in p53-deficient H1299 cells using ARF as a positive control for a factor known to stabilize p53 when exogenously introduced into cells. The cells were transfected with plasmids encoding MDM2 and p53 alone or with either one of the L proteins or ARF. As a control, the cells transfected with MDM2 and p53 only were treated with 20 μm concentrations of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 8 h before harvesting. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and in vivo ubiquitination assays were conducted as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 1A and as expected (36Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 38Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar), cotransfection of MDM2 with p53 resulted in p53 ubiquitination and drastic reduction of its protein level (compare lane 3 to lane 2). Consistent with our previous results (32Dai M.S. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44475-44482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 33Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), ectopic expression of L5 and L23 markedly inhibited the ubiquitination of both p53 and MDM2 and consequently protected p53 degradation by MDM2 (lanes 5 and 7 of Figs. 1, A and B). However, overexpression of L11 dramatically increased the ubiquitinated species of p53 and MDM2 as well as their protein levels (lane 6 of Figs. 1, A and B). This effect was similar to that of ARF (lane 4 of Figs. 1, A and B) as reported previously (39Xirodimas D. Saville M.K. Edling C. Lane D.P. Lain S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The enhancement of the level of ubiquitinated MDM2 and p53 species as well as their protein levels by L11 and ARF was not due to the variation in transfection efficiency because the GFP protein level in each transfectant was equivalent (Fig. 1C). Of note, the effect of L11 and ARF on stabilizing p53 and MDM2 was much more prominent than that of L5 and L23 (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, the effect of L11 and ARF on the ubiquitination of MDM2 and p53 was similar to that of MG132 treatment (lane 8, Fig. 1, A and B), although to different extents. L11 was more effective than MG132 in enhancing the level of ubiquitinated MDM2 species. This might be due to the specific inhibition of 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation of ubiquitinated MDM2 by L11 (see Fig. 3C). These results suggest that these ribosomal proteins may utilize different mechanisms to regulate the MDM2 and p53 ubiquitination and proteasomal pathways although all these nucleolar proteins can stabilize p53 upon overexpression (Fig. 1).FIGURE 3L11 inhibits 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation of ubiquitinated MDM2 in vitro. A, in vitro auto-ubiquitination of MDM2. 10 ng of purified FLAG-MDM2 was incubated in the ubiquitination reaction in the presence or absence of E1, UbcH5a (E2), and ubiquitin (Ub). Ubiquitinated MDM2 species (MDM2-(His-Ub)n) were detected by immunoblot using anti-MDM2 antibody. B, MDM2 ubiquitination is required for its proteasome degradation. Purified FLAG-MDM2 (10 ng) was incubated with buffer or purified 26 S proteasome, and then the reactions were assayed by anti-MDM2 immunoblot (N-20). C, L11 inhibits 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation of ubiquitinated MDM2. In vitro ubiquitinated FLAG-MDM2 (Ub-MDM2) was preincubated with or without His-L11, His-L5, or His-L23. 26 S proteasome (1 μg) or proteasome inhibitor (10 μm MG132, 10 μm lactacystin, 10 μm clasto-lactacystin-β-lactone)-treated 26 S proteasome was then added. Reactions were quenched in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblot using anti-MDM2 (N20) antibody. A representative experiment was shown. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. The asterisk indicates nonspecific anti-N20 antibody-reacting bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) However, we were unsure whether the changes in ubiquitinated p53 or MDM2 species induced by the ribosomal L proteins were due to the direct effect of these proteins on the ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2. To determine the effect of the L proteins and ARF on the MDM2 ubiquitin ligase activity with p53 and MDM2 as substrates, we performed a set of transfections similar to that in Fig. 1, but 20 μm MG132 was used to block proteasomal degradation so that we could compare ubiquitination at similar protein levels. As shown in Fig. 2, L5 and L23 again dramatically inhibited ubiquitination of both p53 and MDM2 (lanes 5 and 7, Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that these two L proteins may directly inhibit MDM2 ubiquitin ligase activity as previously described (32Dai M.S. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44475-44482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 33Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). By striking contrast, L11, like ARF (39Xirodimas D. Saville M.K. Edling C. Lane D.P. Lain S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), which slightly reduced MDM2-mediated ubiquitinated species of p53 (lanes 4 and 6, Fig. 2A), still markedly increased the ubiquitinated species of MDM2 (lanes 4 and 6, Fig. 2B). This difference was not due to different transfection efficiencies among the different conditions, as all of the exogenous proteins were expressed equally well (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that L11 differentially regulates the levels of ubiquitinated species of p53 and MDM2, causing decreased p53 ubiquitinated species but increased MDM2 ubiquitinated species. L11 Inhibits in Vitro Degradation of Ubiquitinated MDM2 by 26 S Proteasome—Because overexpression of L11, but not L5 and L23, led to similar enhancing effects on the levels of ubiquitinated MDM2 as that of MG132 (Fig. 1) or overexpression of ARF (39Xirodimas D. Saville M.K. Edling C. Lane D.P. Lain S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), we next wanted to determine whether L11, like MG132, could block proteasome-mediated degradation of ubiquitinated MDM2. To test this possibility, we performed an in vitro MDM2 autoubiquitination reaction as shown in Fig. 3A. In the presence of E1, E2, and ubiquitin, MDM2 efficiently ubiquitinated itself (lane 3) as expected (40Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 41Midgley C.A. Desterro J.M. Saville M.K. Howard S. Sparks A. Hay R.T. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2312-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To test if ubiquitination of MDM2 is required for its degradation by 26 S proteasome, we incubated purified MDM2 with 26 S proteasome or buffer and then assayed for the level of MDM2. As shown in Fig. 3B, purified MDM2 is not degraded by 26 S proteasome, indicating that ubiquitination is essential for proteasomal-mediated degradation of MDM2. Next, the ubiquitinated MDM2 was then used for 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation assays. As shown in Fig. 3C, the addition of purified 26 S proteasome caused a marked decrease in the amounts of MDM2-ubiquitin conjugates as well as a decrease of native (non-modified) MDM2 (compare lane 2 to lane 1). These effects were efficiently blocked by the addition of MG132 (lane 3), suggesting that the ubiquitinated MDM2 can be efficiently degraded through the proteasome system in our assays. Consistent with the above results, L11 (lanes 4–5), but not L5 (lanes 6–7) and L23 (lanes 8–9), drastically inhibited the degradation of ubiquitinated MDM2 by the 26 S proteasome. These results suggest that L11 directly blocked 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation of MDM2-ubiquitin conjugates. These results explain the accumulation of ubiquitinated species of MDM2 by L11 in cells (Fig. 2). L11 Also Stabilizes p53 in Cells—It has been shown that ectopic expression of L11 leads to elevated p53 protein levels and transcriptional activity in cells (29Zhang Y. Wolf G.W. Bhat K. Jin A. Allio T. Burkhart W.A. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8902-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 30Lohrum M.A. Ludwig R.L. Kubbutat M.H. Hanlon M. Vousden K.H. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Consistently, we also observed that both endogenous p53 and MDM2 proteins were dramatically increased upon L11 overexpression in p53 proficient U2OS cells (Fig. 4A). However, the effect of L11 on p53 stability has not been determined. Therefore, we transfected U2OS cells with or without FLAG-L11 plasmids. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were treated with cyclohexamide to stop protein synthesis in cells. The cells were then harvested at different time points and subjected to immunoblot to determine endogenous p53 levels (Fig. 4B). The protein levels were determined by measuring the intensity of each band and normalized with expression of GFP. As shown in Figs. 4, B and C, the half-life of p53 prolonged from ∼25 min in empty vector transfected cells to more than 2 h in the cells overexpressing FLAG-L11. These results are consistent with the notion that L11 inhibited MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination (Fig. 2) and demonstrate that the increased level of p53 in the presence of ectopically expressed L11 is due to p53 stabilization by this ribosomal protein. We also observed that L11 significantly increased the half-life of MDM2 in the same assay (data not shown). Therefore, L11 can also stabilize MDM2 as well. Increment of Ubiquitinated Species and Stability of MDM2 by L11 Is p53-independent—L11 can directly bind to MDM2 (32Dai M.S. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44475-44482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) but not p53 (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that stabilization of p53 by L11 is through the inhibitory effect of L11 on MDM2. However, is the L11-induced increase in ubiquitinated species and stability of MDM2 dependent on p53? To address this issue, we examined the effect of L11 on the half-life of MDM2 and its autoubiquitination in p53-deficient H1299 cells. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5, A and B, the half-life of ectopic MDM2 protein increased from ∼20 min in the cells transfected with a control vector to ∼2 h in the FLAG"

Furthermore, many chemokines form dimers or higher order oligomers, but all characterized oligomeric structures are based primarily on two dimerization motifs represented by CC-chemokine or CXC-chemokine dimer interfaces. These observations raise the possibility that some chemokines could form unique hetero-oligomers using the same oligomerization motifs. Such interactions could modulate the overall signaling response of the receptors, thereby providing a general mechanism for regulating chemokine function. For some chemokines, homo-oligomerization has also been shown to be coupled to glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding. However, the effect of GAG binding on chemokine hetero-oligomerization has not yet been demonstrated. In this report, we characterized the heterodimerization of the CCR2 ligands MCP-1 (CCL2), MCP-2 (CCL8), MCP-3 (CCL7), MCP-4 (CCL13), and eotaxin (CCL11), as well as the effects of GAG binding, using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (ESI-FTICR) mass spectrometry. Strong heterodimerization was observed between CCL2 and CCL8 at the expense of homodimer formation. Using NMR, we showed that the heterodimer is predominant in solution and forms a specific CC chemokine-like dimer. By contrast, only moderate heterodimer formation was observed between CCL2·CCL13, CCL2·CCL11 and CCL8·CCL13, and no heterodimerization was observed when any other CCR2 ligand was added to CCL7. To investigate the effect of a highly sulfated GAG on the formation of heterodimers, each chemokine pair was mixed with the heparin pentasaccharide, Arixtra, and assayed by ESI-FTICR mass spectrometry. Although no CCL8·CCL11 heterodimer was observed in the absence of GAG, abundant ions corresponding to the ternary complex, CCL8·CCL11·Arixtra, were observed upon addition of Arixtra. Heterodimerization between CCL2 and CCL11 was also enhanced in the presence of Arixtra. In summary, these results indicate that some CCR2 ligands can form stable heterodimers in preference to homodimers and that these interactions, like those of homo-oligomers, can be influenced by some GAGs. Despite the wide range of sequence diversity among chemokines, their tertiary structures are remarkably similar.

Chemokines are small (8-12 kDa), secreted proteins that have critical roles in many biological processes, including lymphoid trafficking and inflammation, angiogenesis/angiostasis, and development, as well as in many disease states (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar, 2Rossi D. Zlotnik A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). Based on the pattern of N-terminal cysteine residues, they have been categorized into CC, CXC, C, and CX3C families. However, despite the fact that sequence identity between chemokines can range from <20% to >90%, their tertiary structures are highly conserved and consist primarily of a disordered N terminus, a long irregular loop ending in a 310 helix, three antiparallel β-strands, and a C-terminal α-helix (1Baggiolini M.

In addition, many chemokines dimerize, some form higher order oligomers, and in many cases, oligomerization is critical for their in vivo function. For example, although the monomeric mutants of MCP-1 (CCL2), 4The abbreviations used are: CCL2, MCP-1; CCL8, MCP-2; CCL7, MCP-3; CCL13, MCP-4; CCL11, eotaxin; CCL4, MIP-1β; CCL3, MIP-1α; CCL5, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted); CCL1, I-309; CXCL4, PF4; CXCL8, interleukin-8; CCL21, SLC; CXCL13, BCA-1; CCL19, ELC; CCR, CC-chemokine receptor; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; ESI-FTICR, electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance; MS, mass spectrometry; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation. MIP-1β (CCL4), and RANTES (CCL5) have wild-type chemotactic activity in vitro, they are inactive in vivo (5Proudfoot A.E.I. Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K. LiWang P. Clark-Lewis I. Borlat F. Wells T.N.C. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In contrast, some chemokines, specifically eotaxin (CCL11), MCP-3 (CCL7), and I-309 (CCL1), cause cell migration in vivo; however, there is no reported evidence that they oligomerize in solution by themselves (6Crump M.P.

Similar to the corresponding features in their tertiary structures, the dimerization motifs of chemokines tend to be structurally conserved and fall primarily into one of two types represented by CC and CXC chemokines. In general, chemokines in the CC family dimerize by formation of a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet involving residues near the N termini, whereas CXC family members dimerize through the first stand of the β-sheet, which is preformed in the monomer structure (9Fernandez E.J. Lolis E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 469-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Recent structural studies have also revealed tetrameric complexes in which both interfaces occur (10Swaminathan G.J. Holloway D.E. Colvin R.A. Campanella G.K. Papageorgiou A.C. Luster A.D.

Biol. 1997; 4: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The facts that each chemokine has a similar fold and they utilize a limited set of dimer interface motifs raise the possibility that some chemokines, particularly those with high sequence homology around the dimer interface residues, may be able to form specific heterodimeric or higher order hetero-oligomeric structures. Indeed, it has been shown that the CXC chemokine, PF4 (CXCL4), binds to another CXC chemokine, IL-8 (CXCL8) with a dissociation constant of 42 nm (12Dudek A.Z. Nesmelova I. Mayo K. Verfaillie C.M. Pitchford S. Slungaard A. Blood. 2003; 101: 4687-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of both chemokines together was shown to have functional consequences, including attenuation of CXCL8-induced signaling in CD34+ human hematopoietic progenitor cells, enhanced CXCL8-induced chemotaxis of CXCR2-transfected cells, and enhanced anti-proliferative activity of CXCL4 on endothelial cells (12Dudek A.Z.

In another example, it was shown that the CCR7 ligand, SLC (CCL21), interacts with the CXCR5 ligand, BCA-1 (CXCL13), which is not an agonist of CCR7, to form hetero-oligomeric complexes. Furthermore, the combination of CXCL13 in concert with either CCL21 or another CCR7 ligand, ELC (CCL19), triggered CCR7-mediated responses at lower concentrations than the agonists alone, again demonstrating synergy (14Paoletti S. Petkovic V. Sebastiani S. Danelon M.G. Uguccioni M. Gerber B.O. Blood. 2005; 105: 3405-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the formation of hetero-oligomers may be a more general property of chemokines and suggest another mechanism to modulate their in vivo function. It is well established that chemokines bind to GAGs, and there is accumulating evidence that this interaction is critical for their function (5Proudfoot A.E.I. Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K.

For example, it has been demonstrated that GAG binding-deficient mutants of CCL2, CCL4, and CCL5 cannot induce cell recruitment in vivo even though they are functional in vitro (5Proudfoot A.E.I.

Additionally, mice engineered to have attenuated N-sulfation of the heparan sulfate chains on their endothelial cells show reduced chemokine transcytosis and presentation and impaired neutrophil migration (16Wang L.C. Fuster M. Sriramarao P. Esko J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). There is also increasing evidence that the oligomerization of chemokines is in some cases related to their GAG-binding properties. For example, in the presence of low molecular weight heparin, the apparent molecular weights of CCL5, MIP-1α (CCL3), and CCL2 are significantly elevated, consistent with the formation of higher order oligomers (17Hoogewerf A.J.

CXCL8, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5 have also been shown to oligomerize on immobilized heparin and on human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and in the case of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, binding is reduced by deglycosylation enzymes (17Hoogewerf A.J.

Given the correlation between homo-oligomerization and GAG binding, it is not unreasonable to postulate that GAG binding may also modulate chemokine hetero-oligomerization. However, such interactions have yet to be systematically explored. We have recently shown that ESI-FTICR mass spectrometry is a valuable tool with which to characterize chemokine-GAG noncovalent interactions (19Yu Y.H. Sweeney M.D. Saad O.M. Crown S.E. Handel T.M.

Handel, additional unpublished AUC data. the results are in good agreement with solution studies by NMR, analytical ultracentrifugation, and isothermal titration calorimetry. This process is facilitated by electrospray ionization, which enables transfer of intact noncovalent complexes from solution into the gas phase (21Ruotolo B.T. Giles K. Campuzano I. Sandercock A.M. Bateman R.H. Robinson C.V. Science. 2005; 310: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Analysis of the ion populations can then yield information about molecular weight, abundance, binding stoichiometry, and relative binding affinity of the complexes (19Yu Y.H. Sweeney M.D. Saad O.M.

This previous mass spectrometric study indicated that, under the conditions used, the CCR2 ligands can be divided into two groups based on their multimeric states. CCL2 and MCP-2 (CCL8) exist as monomers in equilibrium with dimer, the latter being preferentially bound by the highly sulfated heparin octasaccharides. Conversely, CCL7, MCP-4 (CCL13), and CCL11 are monomers and only form 1:1 complexes with heparin octasaccharides. Because of the significant sequence homology among the CCR2 ligands in the residues involved in CC dimerization (supplemental Fig. S1), we set out to investigate whether any or all of these chemokines are capable of heterodimerizing. In fact, of the ten positions in the first shell of the CC-dimer interface (residues 1-3, 8-12, and 18-19) (22Handel T.M. Domaille P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6569-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 23Blaszczyk J. Van Coillie E. Proost P. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G. Bujacz G.D. Wang J.M. Ji X.H.

Of special note is a proline in position 8, which is essential for dimerization of CCL2 (24Paavola C.D. Hemmerich S. Grunberger D. Polsky I. Bloom A. Freedman R. Mulkins M. Bhakta S. McCarley D.

If differences in the ability of the chemokines to heterodimerize were observed, the results would not only suggest another mechanism for regulating chemokine function, but it would provide evidence for nonredundant behavior of the CCR2 ligands. Redundancy refers to the fact that many chemokines bind the same receptor. For example, CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, CCL11, and CCL13 all bind and signal through CCR2, although CCL11 functions as an antagonist (25Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R.

Thus, in the present study, we used ESI-FTICR MS to characterize the heterodimerization of the CCR2 ligands. We also used NMR to determine if the interaction is specific and to characterize the nature of the heterodimer interface of CCL2·CCL8. Finally, we used MS to investigate the effect of GAG binding on the ability of the chemokines to heterodimerize. Materials—Arixtra™ (fondaparinux sodium) was purchased from GlaxoSmithKline (Research Triangle Park, NC) and was desalted and quantified for experiments as described previously (20Yu Y. Sweeney M.D. Saad O.M. Leary J.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spect. 2006; 17: 524-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Heparinase I (EC 4.2.2.7) was purchased from Seikagaku (Falmouth, MA). All the other chemicals were purchased from Fisher Scientific and used without further purification. The CCR2 ligands were expressed and purified as previously described (19Yu Y.H.

Preparation of Chemokine Heterodimers—The binary interactions between the CCR2 ligands CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, CCL11, and CCL13 were investigated. In each experiment, two chemokines, each at a concentration of 10 μm, were mixed in 100 mm NH4OAc (pH 6.8) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min with gentle rocking. The resulting solution was analyzed by ESI-FTICR MS. For characterization of the effect of GAG on heterodimerization, two chemokines (each at 10 μm) were mixed with 10 μm Arixtra in 100 mm NH4OAc (pH 6.8). The solution was incubated as above and analyzed by ESI-FTICR MS. Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectra were acquired on a Bruker APEX II 7-tesla FTICR mass spectrometer (Billerica, MA) equipped with an Apollo (Bruker, Billerica, MA) electrospray ion source. Samples were infused into the mass spectrometer at 1 μl/min using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). The pressures of the nebulizing and drying gases were maintained at 50 and 25 p.s.i., respectively. The capillary exit voltage was adjusted to 140 V (positive mode) for ion desolvation (19Yu Y.H.

Ions were externally accumulated in a radiofrequency-only hexapole for 0.5 s and were trapped in the ICR cell using gated trapping. Between 8 and 100 broadband time domain transients containing 1024 k data points were averaged and subjected to zero fill, Gaussian multiplication, and fast Fourier transform analysis. The parameters of the ESI source, ion optics, and cell were optimized for the best ion intensity. All the data were acquired and processed using Xmass version 6.0.0 (Bruker, Billerica, MA). NMR—The 15N-labeled CCL2 was produced as previously described (24Paavola C.D. Hemmerich S. Grunberger D. Polsky I. Bloom A. Freedman R. Mulkins M. Bhakta S. McCarley D. Wiesent L. Wong B. Jarnagin K. Handel T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33157-33165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). All NMR samples were prepared with 200 μm CCL2 in 5% D2O (pH 5.42). CCL2·CCL8 samples were prepared with 0, 25, 50, 100, 125, 200, and 800 μm unlabeled CCL8 in addition to the labeled CCL2. HSQC spectra (32Grzesiek S. Anglister J. Ren H. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4369-4370Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar) were recorded as previously described at 26 °C on a 600-MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer. The data were processed in Azara (Wayne Boucher, University of Cambridge). Assignments were derived from a previous study on the structure of CCL2 (22Handel T.M. Domaille P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6569-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Both CCL2 and CCL8 exist in equilibrium between monomer and dimer forms. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and C), the 5+ monomer and 9+ dimer ions were clearly observed when 10 μm CCL2 or CCL8 was sprayed from a solution in 100 mm NH4OAc (pH 6.8). When an equimolar mixture (10 μm each) of CCL2 and CCL8 was analyzed, a distinctly different dimer profile was obtained (Fig. 1B), with only small amounts of CCL2 or CCL8 homodimers. Conversely, an intense peak was observed, corresponding to the 9+ ion of the CCL2·CCL8 heterodimer. Summing the intensities of both 8+ and 9+ charge states, the normalized abundances of the CCL2 homodimer, CCL2·CCL8 heterodimer, and the CCL8 homodimer were calculated to be ∼7.4, 83.6 and 9.0%, respectively, indicating almost complete depletion of the homodimers. The experiments were then repeated for the other binary combinations between the CCR2 ligands and showed very different heterodimerization characteristics. Moderate heterodimer formation was observed between CCL2·CCL13, CCL2·CCL11, and CCL8·CCL13. In these cases, the heterodimers are less abundant than the corresponding homodimers. For example, although CCL13 alone is a monomer (supplemental Fig. S2C), ions corresponding to both CCL2 homodimer and CCL2·CCL13 heterodimer were observed in the mixed sample, with the latter being less abundant (supplemental Fig. S2B). In contrast, heterodimerization was not observed when other CCR2 ligands were mixed with CCL7 or in mixtures of CCL11 with CCL8 or CCL13. For example, the profile of a mixture of CCL2 and CCL7 is shown in Fig. 2. Monomer and dimer CCL2 as well as monomer CCL7 were observed, but no heterodimer was detected. To provide confirmation of the results of the mass spectrometry and to investigate the structure of the strongest heterodimer, we conducted an NMR chemical shift perturbation experiment by titrating different amounts of unlabeled CCL8 into 15N-labeled CCL2, monitoring the 15N HSQC spectrum of the CCL2 component (Fig. 3A). Changes in chemical shift indicate that the chemical environment of the corresponding amide nitrogens and/or protons are altered due to direct contact with CCL8 or from a conformational change due to CCL8 binding and can thus provide evidence of the dimerization interface. Sixty backbone amide peaks from the CCL2-only spectra were unambiguously assigned (supplemental Table S1). Many of the peaks in the CCL2 spectra showed a significant and systematic change in chemical shift with increasing concentrations of CCL8. Several of the peaks in the homodimer spectrum disappear and reappear in a different but nearby location in the heterodimer spectrum. This indicates that the protein is in slow exchange between two stable conformations, the homodimer of CCL2 and the CCL2·CCL8 heterodimer. Peaks in a second set disappear from the spectra at high concentrations of CCL8 but do not reappear near the original location. These peaks change so drastically that they cannot be assigned in the heterodimer spectrum but likely correspond to several new slowly exchanging peaks that appear in the heterodimer spectra. Although small changes are seen scattered throughout the protein, the peaks that migrate significantly (such as those corresponding to residues 3, 4, and 9) are clustered in or around the N terminus, whereas many of the “vanishing” peaks are located in the N terminus (residues 7 and 10-16) and the last β-strand (residues 51-53). Fig. 3B shows sub-spectra of one representative peak in slow exchange. Fig. 4 shows a plot of the changes in peak intensities as a function of added CCL8 for four of the slowly exchanging amides that can be confidently assigned in both the homodimer and heterodimer spectra. With increasing concentrations of CCL8, the intensity of the homodimer peak decreases, while the intensity of the heterodimer peak increases. The intensities of all four peaks were decreased by 50% between 80 and 110 μm CCL8 (approximately a 1:2 molar ratio of CCL8 to CCL2), indicating that half of the CCL2 monomers are in the homodimeric state and half are in the heterodimeric state. Because there are two CCL2 monomers in the CCL2 homodimer while only one is present in each CCL2·CCL8 heterodimer, the concentration of CCL2 homodimer is half of the heterodimer concentration. At 200 μm CCL8 (equimolar to CCL2), all four peaks indicate that there is at most 25% intensity in the homodimer peak, which would correspond to a one homodimer to six heterodimer ratio. This indicates that the heterodimer is predominant, agreeing well with the observations made by mass spectrometry. The peaks that shift most significantly in the spectra were identified and mapped onto the CCL2 tetramer structure (Fig. 5 and supplemental Table 1). Fig. 5A shows the CC-type dimer interface observed in the CCL2 and CCL8 homodimer structures, whereas Fig. 5B shows the CXC-type interface observed in CXC family chemokines. As indicated above, many of the affected peaks correspond to residues in the N terminus or in the third β-strand, which abuts the N terminus of CCL2. These residues fall near the CC-chemokine interface. In contrast, almost no major changes are indicated at the CXC interface. This strongly suggests that the CCL2·CCL8 heterodimer has the CC-type conformation. We subsequently investigated the effect of GAG binding on chemokine heterodimerization. For these studies, we chose the heparin pentasaccharide, Arixtra, because it is homogeneous unlike heparin and other natural GAGs (heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and others) that are heterogeneous in both size and composition. Homogeneity of the GAG greatly simplifies interpretation of the mass spectrometry data, allowing us to distinguish heterodimer·GAG from homodimer·GAG complexes. Arixtra is nearly identical to a highly sulfated heparin pentasaccharide with seven of eight common sulfations present and one rare sulfation site also charged. In a separate study, we demonstrated that its interaction with chemokines is similar to heparin in the context of FTICR MS assays (20Yu Y. Sweeney M.D. Saad O.M. Leary J.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spect. 2006; 17: 524-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We chose Arixtra because it is longer than other commercially available homogenous GAG homologues. However, it is important to note that, like any model GAG, Arixtra does not capture the potential diversity of protein-GAG interactions or mimic quantitatively the true in vivo interactions. Using the mass spectrometry-based filtration trapping assay (9Fernandez E.J. Lolis E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 469-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), we observed that Arixtra binds each of the CCR2 ligands. Each possible pair of CCR2 ligands was then mixed with Arixtra, and the resulting solution was analyzed by ESI-FTICR MS. As shown in Fig. 6A, a solution of CCL8, CCL11, and Arixtra in 100 mm NH4OAc gave well resolved mass spectra. Strikingly, although no heterodimerization of these two chemokines was observed in the absence of Arixtra (Fig. 6B), abundant heterodimer in complex with Arixtra (CCL8·CCL11·Arixtra) was observed for the equimolar mixture of these molecules (Fig. 6A). The heterodimer·Arixtra complex was more abundant than the homodimer·Arixtra complex (CCL8·Arixtra). Similarly, although only a low level of CCL2·CCL11 heterodimer was observed in the absence of Arixtra, intense ions corresponding to the heterodimer·GAG complex (CCL2·CCL11·Arixtra) were observed when Arixtra was added (supplemental Fig. S3). These data indicate that binding of Arixtra can significantly drive heterodimer formation (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Comparison of the relative abundance of the homodimer and heterodimer in a mixture of the CCR2 ligands. A, the relative abundance in the absence of Arixtra. Note that both CCL2 and CCL8 exist in equilibrium between monomers and homodimers, whereas CCL7, CCL13, and CCL11 only form monomers. B, the relative abundance in the presence of Arixtra. The ion intensities of the homodimer and the homodimer in complex with Arixtra are summed, normalized, and reported as the relative abundance of the homodimers. The relative abundance of the heterodimers was calculated using the same method. As noted in the text, quantitative data collected for Arixtra is unlikely to correspond to what would be observed with the"

In the present study, using differential extraction and sedimentation procedures optimized for the purification of cytoskeletal and membrane-skeletal associated proteins, we analyze SERT localization in platelets. We find that most of the plasma membrane SERT is associated with the membrane skeleton. This association can be enhanced by both transporter activation and 5HT2A receptor activation. Inactivation of transport activity by phorbol ester treatment of intact platelets relocates SERT to the cytoskeleton fraction, consequently leading to transporter internalization. The translocation of SERT between these compartments is correlated with changes in the interaction with the LIM domain adaptor protein Hic-5. Co-immunoprecipitation and uptake activity studies suggest that Hic-5 is a determinant of transporter inactivation and relocation to a compartment subserving endocytic regulation.

Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2753-2757Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that specify the plasma membrane localization of SERT are as yet ill defined.The plasma membrane is organized in specialized domains anchored to actin filaments that include spectrin-based meshworks, adsorptive cell surface microvilli, focal adhesions, and adherens junctions (13Kusumi A.

In each of these domains, interactions between cytoskeletal proteins provide resistance against disruption by nonionic detergents, such as Triton X-100, permitting the transmembrane protein assembly to be isolated as a “membrane skeleton” (15Luna E.J.

Traffic. 2004; 5: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar).Both cytoskeleton-stabilized membrane domains and lipid rafts provide sites at which localized signal transduction that ultimately modulate SERT function could occur. Cholesterol depletion of HEK-293 cells expressing rSERT modifies both ligand and antidepressant-binding affinities to the transporter through a mechanism that may involve direct cholesterol/transporter interactions (26Scanlon S.M. Williams D.C. Schloss P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10507-10513Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Whereas active SERT expressed in HEK-293 cells has been localized to lipid rafts, phorbol ester treatment of synaptosomes relocates SERT away from lipid raft fractions in concert with a loss of associated proteins (27Samuvel D.J. Jayanthi L.D. Bhat N.R. Ramamoorthy S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). SERTs form complexes with a growing list of membrane proteins, enzymes and cytoskeleton-associated proteins including syntaxin 1A (28Quick M.W.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7045-7054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the precise role of these associations is not fully defined. Additional information regarding SERT subcellular localization in the context of regulated protein associations may provide important clues to precise mechanisms of SERT regulation.Specific binding to a particular membrane skeleton/cytoskeleton may also be controlled by phosphorylation (17Fox J.E. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 198-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). SERT exhibits basal phosphorylation that can be elevated by activation of protein kinases and inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A, with accompanied changes in transport activity and/or surface expression (33Melikian H.E. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 104: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). External 5HT can suppress phorbol ester-induced SERT phosphorylation and internalization, providing a mechanism to tune SERT capacity to the demands of 5HT release (34Blakely R.D. Ramamoorthy S. Schroeter S. Qian Y. Apparsundaram S. Galli A. DeFelice L.J. Biol. Psychiatry. 1998; 44: 169-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Additionally, Jayanthi et al. (35Jayanthi L.D. Samuvel D.J. Blakely R.D. Ramamoorthy S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 2077-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) demonstrated a biphasic regulation of SERT by PKC in platelets, whereby initial SERT catalytic inactivation is followed by internalization correlated with distinct phosphorylation states. Recent reports also show that cell surface levels of SERT can be modified by protein kinase G (PKG) activation and p38 MAPK inactivation (36Zhu C.B. Hewlett W.A. Feoktistov I. Biaggioni I. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1462-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).These initial studies suggest that the macromolecular organization of SERT protein complexes is differentially linked to specific SERT-associated membrane subdomains that in turn dictate SERT activity or mobility, and ultimately 5HT clearance capacity. We hypothesize that SERT inactivation and internalization is mediated by protein-protein associations that lead to active movement of the transporter through membrane skeleton/cytoskeleton domains. In the present study, using well established, differential extraction procedures (37Sagot I. Regnouf F. Henry J.P. Pradel L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38Lohi O. Lehto V.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 39Dash D. Aepfelbacher M.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we analyze SERT distribution and localization in different cytoskeletal compartments upon exposure of platelets to 5HT, 5HT receptor agonists or phorbol esters. Most of the active plasma membrane SERT is associated with the membrane skeleton, whereas SERT appears to associate with the dense actin-cytoskeleton during inactivation and internalization. The translocation of SERT between these compartments is correlated with the interaction and translocation of the adaptor protein Hic-5. The interaction of Hic-5 with SERT can inactivate the transporter and facilitate SERT internalization through by promoting interactions with the actin cytoskeleton.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Platelets—Outdated human platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained from the American Red Cross. Studies with mouse platelets were performed in accordance with humane guidelines established by the Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under an approved protocol (M/04/376). Mouse platelets were collected in a tube containing acid-citrate-dextrose from the superior vena cava after sacrifice. Whole blood was centrifuged immediately at 190 × g for 15 min at room temperature to obtain platelet-rich plasma. The platelet-rich plasma was centrifuged at 2500 × g for 15 min at 22 °C, and the resulting platelet pellet was gently resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer, pH 7.4 and used immediately.Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—Glass coverslips were treated with collagen (100 μg/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C and washed three times with PBS. Human or mouse platelets were added at a 1 × 108 concentration and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min for adhesion. Platelets were then washed two times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 4 °C, washed overnight with PBS and blocked with PBS solution containing 5% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then incubated overnight, at 4 °C with no. 48 affinity-purified rabbit anti-SERT antibody (30Bauman A.L. Apparsundaram S. Ramamoorthy S. Wadzinski B.E. Vaughan R.A. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7571-7578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary anti-rabbit Alexa 680-conjugated antibody (Molecular Probes) was added after three washes with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Three samples were used as negative controls to determine antibody specificity/background staining: SERT KO platelets, primary Ab alone and secondary Ab alone. The coverslips were then washed three times with PBS and mounted onto glass slides with aqua poly/mount (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). The samples were visualized using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Vanderbilt University Medical Center Cell Imaging Core Resource, LSM 510 META, Zeiss, Thornwood, NY).Biotinylation of Platelets—Human or mouse platelets (1 × 109) were resuspended in room temperature assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.8) containing 2.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) and incubated for 40 min at 4 °C. The platelets were washed with ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 for 10 min at 4 °C and solubilized with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 μm pepstatin A, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 μm okadaic acid). Surface-biotinylated proteins were isolated using streptavidin beads (Pierce). SERT levels from total extract, eluted fractions from streptavidin beads (surface-biotinylated fraction), and non-bound fractions (intracellular fractions) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%), electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with SERT antibody (no. 48 rabbit affinity-purified antibody). Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ). Multiple film (CL-X Posure™, Pierce) exposures were obtained to ensure data capture in the linear range of film. Thereafter, the blots were stripped and probed with anti-actin monoclonal antibody (anti-β-actin, Sigma) and anti-Na+/K+-ATPase monoclonal antibody (Sigma) to validate surface biotinylation as well as equal protein loading and transfer. Band densities were quantified by integrating band density using computer-assisted densitometry (NIH Image 1.33u). Reported values represent absolute mean values ± S.E. (arbitrary units) of five or more independent experiments unless otherwise indicated.Isolation and Analysis of Platelet Fractions—Platelet cytoskeletal fractions were isolated as previously described (18Fox J.E. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 108 platelets (human or mouse) were pelleted after pharmacological treatment by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 2 min and lysed with 100 μl of 1% Triton X-100, 21 μm leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm pepstatin A, and 0.56 trypsin inhibitor unit/ml aprotinin in PBS, pH 7.4. Samples were resuspended and spun at 15,600 × g for 4 min at 4 °C in a bench top microcentrifuge for collection of cytoskeletal pellets (CS). The supernatants were transferred to a new tube and spun at 100,000 × g for 2 h (Beckmann M150 microultracentrifuge) for isolation of membrane skeleton (MS) pellets. The remaining supernatant was denominated TS (Triton-soluble) fraction. Each pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of RIPA buffer and either total content or equivalent protein amounts as described in the figure legends were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis. Hic-5 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) were detected on blots using monoclonal antibodies obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) whereas anti-vinculin and anti-talin monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Graphs that show arbitrary units were subsequently normalized to control values to assess percentage change over time/treatment (data cited under “Results”). For fractionation studies, each set of fractions (CS, MS, and TS) was analyzed independently as well as a fraction of total material in each sample where densities associated with CS+MS+TS = total protein. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prizm 4 software (GraphPad Software Inc.) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) or paired or unpaired Student's t tests as indicated under “Results.”Platelet Plasma Membrane Vesicle Preparation and 5HT Uptake—Resealed plasma membrane vesicles were isolated from human platelets according to Rudnick (41Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2170-2174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human platelet-rich plasma (25 ml) was treated with 10 μm 5HT or vehicle (PBS) for 30 min at 37 °C. Intact platelets were then collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and lysed by washing three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and loaded onto TENG buffer (80% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl pH 7.5). Platelet plasma membranes were purified by centrifugation at 15,600 × g, re-sealed in 1 ml of vesicle buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 1 mg of DNase) for 10 min at 37 °C and then purified by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The plasma membrane vesicles were resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at a concentration of 3-10 mg of membrane protein/ml, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Translation/transcription reactions containing either Hic-5 cDNA or control vector (see “Results”) were added at this point and incubated with platelet membranes for 10 min at 37 °C during resealing of vesicles (TnT® quick-coupled transcription/translation systems, Promega, Madison, WI). The resealed vesicles were then frozen at -20 °C and purified the following day as mentioned above. Platelet plasma membrane vesicles (100 μg per tube) were resuspended in Krebs-Ringer's HEPES (KRH) buffer containing 130 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.8 g/liter glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 100 μm pargyline, and 100 μm ascorbic acid. After 2 min of incubation with 50 nm [3H]5HT (5-hydroxy[3H]tryptamine trifluoro-acetate, 99.0Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences UK Limited, Buckinghamshire, UK), 5HT uptake was terminated by filtration through GF/B Whatman filters and washed three times with ice-cold KRH buffer. Filters were removed, immersed in scintillation fluid (Ecoscint™, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) for ∼8 h and quantitated by scintillation spectrometry. The counts obtained from the filtered samples were corrected for the nonspecific binding/uptake obtained by incubations with 1 μm paroxetine. Assay points were obtained in duplicate with cumulative uptake data arising from three or more independent experiments.Immunoprecipitations—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblots were performed from detergent extracts of either human or mouse platelets, or mouse midbrain synaptosomes. Detergent extracts were prepared by washing 108 platelets with PBS and lysis by 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C. For SERT immunoprecipitations, 100μg of protein extract was precleared with 5μg of normal rabbit serum and 30 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose bead slurry (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsla, Sweden) for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared lysate was then incubated with either 1 μg of normal rabbit IgG or 1 μg of affinity-purified rabbit anti-SERT antibody (purified from either no. 48 or no. 50 antisera, for details see Ref. 30Bauman A.L. Apparsundaram S. Ramamoorthy S. Wadzinski B.E. Vaughan R.A. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7571-7578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by a 1-h incubation with 30 μlofa50% protein A-Sepharose bead slurry at room temperature. Beads were then washed three times with PBS, and immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting as described above.RESULTSDistribution of SERT in Platelets—An initial characterization of SERT membrane localization in platelets was assayed by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1). We characterized SERT-specific staining in mouse platelets by using both wild-type (Fig. 1A) and SERT knock-out (Fig. 1B) mouse platelets and scanning with the same laser configuration for both samples. In wild-type samples, the majority of SERT immunoreactivity localizes to punctuate densities within intracellular compartments. We confirmed that most of the specific staining was also observed in intracellular compartments in human platelets, where almost no signal was detected at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C). To define the relative abundance between surface and intracellular compartments we utilized cell surface biotinylation by incubating mouse platelets with cell-impermeable sulfo-NHS-biotin at 4 °C, followed by solubilization and collection of biotinylated platelet transporters on streptavidin beads (Fig. 1D). SERT immunoreactivity was evident in both plasma membrane (biotinylated, B) and intracellular (resistant to biotinylation or non-biotinylated, NB) fractions. Actin was restricted to the intracellular (NB) fractions, whereas the Na+/K+-ATPase was identified in the plasma membrane (B) fraction. Quantitative analyses demonstrates that the bulk of SERT protein is resistant to biotinylation (86.5 ± 4.5% intracellular, 13.5 ± 4.5% surface) indicative of substantial intracellular sequestration. Similar findings were obtained with human platelets (data not shown).To better characterize SERT localization at both plasma membrane and intracellular compartments, we isolated MS and CS fractions by solubilization of mouse platelets. The procedure described under “Experimental Procedures” has been established to map protein translocation through skeletal compartments in human platelets following thrombin activation (39Dash D. Aepfelbacher M. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17321-17326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 40Dash D. Aepfelbacher M. Siess W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 42Najimi M. Maloteaux J.M. Hermans E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The CS fraction isolated as a low speed (15,600 × g), Triton-X-100 insoluble fraction, is rich in filamentous actin and contains ∼10% of total platelet proteins. The MS fraction requires high-speed (100,000 × g) centrifugation to pellet and is enriched for focal adhesion proteins such as vinculin and talin as well as other actin-binding proteins and also corresponds to ∼10% of total proteins (18Fox J.E. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatant overlying the MS pellet that contains most platelet proteins (∼80%) is denoted TS. We blotted the total content of these fractions and established that most of the SERT protein is present in the TS membranes (88.0 ± 1.7%) whereas only ∼12% of total SERT protein resides in either the MS (7.6 ± 1.2%) or CS (4.4 ± 0.7%) membranes (Fig. 2A). Blotting for other marker proteins revealed the expected distributions for CS, MS, and TS fractions. For example, F-actin was localized to the CS fraction and depleted in the MS fraction, whereas the reverse is true for focal adhesion proteins (vinculin, talin). Focal adhesion kinase and Hic-5 predominated in the TS fraction, consistent with sizeable, soluble pools of these cytoplasmic proteins.FIGURE 2Subcellular fractionation of platelets. A, mouse platelet and midbrain cytoskeleton and membrane skeleton isolation. Mouse platelets were homogenized with PBS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and the CS, MS, and TS fractions were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Equal volumes of each fraction were loaded and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Averaged data from eight independent experiments are presented ± S.E. B, distribution of plasma membrane proteins in the different platelet fractionations. Human platelets were biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-biotin and lysed with 1% Triton X-100, and CS and MS fractions were isolated. Equal volumes of each fraction were submitted to electrophoresis and plasma membrane proteins from each fraction were identified by blotting membranes with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Data represent averaged densitometry from three independent experiments. C, distribution of the plasma membrane SERT between the different cytoskeletal compartments. Human platelets were biotinylated, and the CS and MS fractions were isolated. SERT was immunoprecipitated with no. 48 antibody, and plasma membrane SERT was identified as a 80-kDa streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase reactive band, absent from normal rabbit serum immunoprecipitates (see inset). Averaged data from three independent experiments are quantitated, revealing that the MS fraction contains most of the biotinylated SERT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine how TS, MS, and CS fractions relate to SERT distribution defined by biotinylation, we biotinylated platelets prior to cell fractionation, and then examined fractions for evidence of biotinylation using avidin-HRP In Fig. 2B we show that the bulk of plasma membrane proteins are localized to either the CS or the MS fractions (77 ± 7.1% for MS+CS) indicating that the bulk of the TS fraction derives from intracellular proteins and membrane compartments. Interestingly, although CS and MS fractions exhibit an equivalent level of total biotinylated proteins, SERT was not evenly distributed between CS and MS fractions (Fig. 2C). When the biotinylated CS and MS fractions were immunoprecipitated with SERT antibodies, significantly more biotinylated material was recovered from the MS fraction, suggesting that most of the SERT in the CS fraction is internalized or otherwise inaccessible to biotinylation. Looking at the relative distribution across biotinylated fractions, SERT in the MS fraction constituted 81.7 ± 10.2% of total surface SERT protein. This distribution is unlikely to be caused by a problem with antibody access to CS or MS fractions by SERT antibodies used for immunoprecipitation as we recovered SERT equivalently when CS and MS sample input was balanced for SERT abundance (data not shown). These findings indicate that under basal conditions, the bulk of platelet SERT resides in intracellular, TS membranes, whereas the fraction of SERT that is resident at the plasma membrane is enriched in the MS fraction.5HT-induced Redistribution of SERT—The ability of substrates and antagonists to regulate endogenous SERT surface expression has"

Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the aminoterminal PUB domain of human peptide N-glycanase. We demonstrate that the PUB domain is a novel p97 binding module interacting with the D1 and/or D2 ATPase domains of p97 and identify an evolutionary conserved surface patch required for p97 binding.

Glycoproteins of the secretory pathway that fail to fold correctly in the endoplasmic reticulum are retro-translocated to the cytosol for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system in a process known as endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (1Romisch K.

The protein-extracting activity of p97 is believed to be the result of conformational changes that accompany nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (5DeLaBarre B. Brunger A.T. J. Mol.

The importance of functional p97 for endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation is illustrated by the fact that mutations in p97 that are associated with the disorder inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of the bone and fronto-temporal dementia cause endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation defects (7Watts G.D.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae PNGase homologue Png1 is 363 amino acids in length and contains a catalytic triad of cysteine, histidine, and aspartic acid residues typical of the transglutaminase-like superfamily of enzymes (12Lee J.H.

Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11163-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), differences appear to exist with respect to details of the interaction (14Zhao G.

Animal PNGases possess an additional amino-terminal extension that contains a PUB (also called PUG) domain, a protein module of unknown function found in many proteins linked to the ubiquitin-proteasome system on the basis of their domain architecture (15Suzuki T.

Consistent with this notion, p97 and the putative retrotranslocation pore component Derlin-1 have recently been shown to interact with PNGase in mammalian cells, raising the intriguing possibility that endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation substrates are deglycosylated by PNGase during their p97-mediated retro-translocation and subsequently targeted to the 26 S proteasome via the Rad23 homologue, HR23B (17Li G.

To gain insight into the role of the PUB domain, we solved the three-dimensional structure of the PUB domain of human PNGase and found that it is a novel p97 binding module containing a conserved p97 binding site. Structure Determination—DNA encoding the PUB domain of human PNGase (residues 11-109) was PCR amplified from a human cDNA library (Clontech) and cloned into a pRSETA (Invitrogen) derivative that expresses proteins fused to the lipoyl domain of Bacillus stearothermophilus dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase. The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli C41(DE3) cells. Cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani broth to mid log phase and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The temperature was then reduced to 25 °C, and the cells were grown for a further 16 h. Cells were lysed by sonication, and the fusion protein was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow affinity column (Amersham Biosciences). Following cleavage with thrombin (4 h at 30 °C), the PUB domain was further purified by ion exchange chromatography using a Source Q column (Amersham Biosciences) and subsequent gel filtration using a Superdex 75 HR column (Amersham Biosciences). A PUB domain containing L66M, L75M, and L87M mutations was created using the QuikChange II XL kit (Stratagene) to facilitate selenium incorporation. Selenomethionine-substituted mutant protein was prepared exactly as above except that cells were grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with seleno-methionine. Crystals were grown using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 290 K with a reservoir solution containing 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, 30% polyethylene glycol 4000 using 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. Native and MAD data sets were collected at ID14-4, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble. X-ray diffraction data were indexed and integrated using the program MOSFLM and scaled with the program SCALA (20Leslie A.G.W. CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. SERC Laboratory, Daresbury, Warrington1991Google Scholar). An initial MAD density map was generated by locating four selenium sites in the data sets Peak, Inflection, High-energy remote using the program SOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), which was also used to calculate phases. RESOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar) was used for solvent flattening, assuming a 40% solvent content. The structure was built using MAIN (23Turk D. Further Development of a Program for Molecular Graphics and Electron Density Manipulation and Its Application to Protein Structure Determination. Technische Universität, München1992Google Scholar) and refined using CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

The structure of the native protein was determined by molecular replacement using the program CNS. The PUB domain in which Asn-41, Lys-50, and Tyr-51 are replaced with alanine was crystallized in 50% polyethylene glycol 400, 0.1 m CHES, pH 9.5, 0.2 m NaCl. The structure of the mutant protein was determined by molecular replacement using the structure of the native protein. p97 Binding Assay—Plasmids for the bacterial expression of amino-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions of human PNGase (residues 11-109; GST-PUBPNGase) and human UBXD1 (residues 150-264; GST-PUBUBXD1) and of amino-terminal hexahistidine fusions of full-length human p97 and p47 were cloned according to standard procedures. Plasmid pProExHT-p97ΔN for the expression of hexahistidine-tagged human p97 lacking residues 1-199 (p97ΔN) was a kind gift from P. Zwickl (Martinsried, Germany). Plasmid pQE30-FAF1 (25Olsen B.B. Jessen V. Hojrup P. Issinger O.G. Boldyreff B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) for the expression of hexahistidine-tagged full-length human FAF1 was a kind gift from O. G. Issinger (Odense, Denmark). Site-directed mutagenesis of GST-PUBPNGase was performed using the QuikChange II XL kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All proteins were purified by glutathione or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography as applicable according to standard procedures. Glutathione-Sepharose pull-downs were performed exactly as described (26Schuberth C. Richly H. Rumpf S. Buchberger A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), using 10 μl of beads, 40 μg (1.5 nmol) of GST, 60 μg (1.6 nmol) of GST-PUB domain fusions, 20 μg (0.22 nmol) of His6-p97, 15 μg (0.2 nmol) of His6-p97ΔN, 100 μg (2.4 nmol) of His6-p47, and 150 μg (2.0 nmol) of His6-FAF1. In the experiment described in Fig. 5E, 40 μl of beads, 200 μg of GST (7.7 nmol), and 60 μg (1.6 nmol), 120 μg (3.2 nmol), or 300 μg (8 nmol) of GST-PUB domain fusion was used. In the experiments described in Fig. 5, D and E, His6-p97 and His6-p47 or His6-FAF1 were preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C before the preincubation mixture was added to GST-PUBPNGase immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The protein concentrations in the preincubation mixture were: 2.4 μm His6-p97, 28.6 μm His6-p47, and 21.3 μm His6-FAF1. PUB Domain Structure—The amino-terminal PUB domain of human PNGase could be easily expressed in E. coli, and the purified protein produced crystals that diffracted well. As the domain contains only one methionine residue we prepared a L66M/L75M/L87M mutant protein to facilitate the incorporation of sufficient amounts of seleno-methionine to enable the structure of the domain to be solved using the multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion method. The seleno-methionine-substituted mutant protein readily crystallized, and its structure was determined using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion. The structure of the native domain was then determined to 1.6 Å by molecular replacement using the mutant structure. Crystallographic data are summarized in Table 1. A representative section of the electron density is shown in Fig. 2A. The PUB domain fold consists of a bundle of five α helices that pack onto a short three-stranded anti-parallel β sheet (Fig. 2B). In addition, there is a small 310 helix in the loop between the second helix and the first β strand. The structure has some resemblance to the wing helix motif, which also consists of helices packing onto a small β sheet. The topological arrangement of the helices is, however, very different, and a search of the protein structure data base using the program DALI (27Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar) revealed no significant similarity to other known structures. A structure-based alignment of a selection of PUB domains indicates that insertions and deletions are restricted to loops between elements of secondary structure (Fig. 3) and are unlikely to affect the overall fold. Thus, the structure of the PNGase PUB domain can serve as a good model for other PUB domains.TABLE 1Crystallographic data The first two columns refer to the Se derivative, and the third column refers to the native protein.Data setPeakInflectionHigh resolution peakNativeMutantSymmetryP212121P212121P212121P65P65Wavelength (Å)0.97970.97990.97970.9791.5418Resolution range (Å)24.9-1.824.9-1.824.9-1.533.0-1.624.5-1.9Unique reflections8841879915009137348005Completeness (%)aSignal to noise ratio of intensities, highest resolution bin in parentheses98.4 (98.3)98.0 (97.6)98.1 (97.3)99.5 (97.2)99.0 (98.0)RmergebRmerge: ShSI|I(h,i) – I(h)|/ShSi I(h,i) where I(h,i) are symmetry-related intensities and I(h) is the mean intensity of the reflection with unique index h0.066 (0.086)0.072 (0.147)0.119 (0.204)0.070 (0.173)0.088 (0.284)MultiplicitycMultiplicity for unique reflections for MAD; datasets I(+) and I(–) are kept separate5.6 (5.8)5.5 (5.7)5.7 (5.8)5.9 (5.7)3.1 (3.1)I/sIaSignal to noise ratio of intensities, highest resolution bin in parentheses22.2 (16.3)19.7 (10.1)12.2 (6.5)18.4 (6.7)12.4 (4.0)No. of Se sites/monomer4Figure of meritdValue is given after density modification0.44P212121 a = 29.150 Å, b = 32.779 Å, c = 95.746 ÅP65 (native) a = 73.516 Å, c = 33.001 ÅP65 (mutant) a = 73.987 Å, c = 32.994 ÅModel refinementResolution range (Å)24.9-1.533.0-1.625.0-1.9No. of reflections (working/free)14228/76212945/6797588/410No. of residuesA: 2–99A: 1–99A: 1–99No. of water, ligand molecules165134, 3 glycerol99, 1 PEG, 1 β-MeRwork/Rfreee5% of reflections were randomly selected for determination of the free R-factor, prior to any refinement, %0.194, 0.2040.193, 0.2060.185, 0.223B averagefTemperature factors averaged for all atoms14.6 Å221.9 Å219.7 Å2Geometry bonds/anglesgRoot mean square deviations from ideal geometry for bond lengths and restraint angles0.014 Å, 1.253°0.005 Å, 0.559°0.007 Å, 1.247°RamachandranhPercentage of residues in the “most favoured region” of the Ramachandran plot and percentage of outliers (PROCHECK)96.6%/0.0%94.3%/0.0%96.6%/0.0%PDB IDiProtein Data Bank identifiers for coordinates2CCQ2CM0a Signal to noise ratio of intensities, highest resolution bin in parenthesesb Rmerge: ShSI|I(h,i) – I(h)|/ShSi I(h,i) where I(h,i) are symmetry-related intensities and I(h) is the mean intensity of the reflection with unique index hc Multiplicity for unique reflections for MAD; datasets I(+) and I(–) are kept separated Value is given after density modificatione 5% of reflections were randomly selected for determination of the free R-factor, prior to any refinementf Temperature factors averaged for all atomsg Root mean square deviations from ideal geometry for bond lengths and restraint anglesh Percentage of residues in the “most favoured region” of the Ramachandran plot and percentage of outliers (PROCHECK)i Protein Data Bank identifiers for coordinates Open table in a new tab FIGURE 3Structure-based sequence alignment of PUB domains.

Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 426-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A number of residues are highly conserved in PUB domains (Fig. 3). Gly-79 and Phe-80 are located in the turn between the fourth α helix and the second strand of the sheet. Both residues have a structural role: a glycine residue is required for the sharp turn at the end of the helix, and the side chain of the phenylalanine residue packs into the hydrophobic core of the domain. Similarly, the highly conserved residue Leu-35 is at the center of the hydrophobic core of the domain. In contrast, several hydrophilic conserved residues are exposed at the protein surface. Asn-41, which is at the end of the second helix, is conserved in all PUB domains, and Asn-58 in helix 3 is highly conserved. Lys-50 and Tyr-51, both of which are in the 310 helix, Glu-73 in the third α helix, and Arg-55 in the first β strand are also highly conserved and mostly replaced conservatively in other PUB domains. Intriguingly, the side chains of most of these residues line a basic pocket on the protein surface, and residues Asn-41, Lys-50, and Tyr-51 form a well defined surface patch (Fig. 4). The clustering of three highly conserved residues in this surface patch strongly suggests that it is a functionally important site. p97 Binding—Recently, p97 has been shown to interact with human PNGase in vivo and in vitro (17Li G. Zhou X. Zhao G. Schindelin H. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15809-15814Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19McNeill H. Knebel A. Arthur J.S. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To test whether the PUB domain is involved in p97 binding, we performed an in vitro GST pulldown experiment using the isolated PUB domain of human PNGase (Fig. 5A). Indeed, the isolated PUB domain bound p97 very efficiently (compare lane 4 to the input shown in lane 1), whereas no background binding of p97 to GST alone was detectable (lane 2). Similar results were obtained with the PUB domain of human UBXD1 protein (lane 3) (28Carim-Todd L. Escarceller M. Estivill X. Sumoy L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1517: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These data show for the first time the direct binding of PUB domains to p97. Furthermore, they suggest that the PUB domain is a novel p97 binding module. We next analyzed the importance of the conserved surface patch consisting of residues Asn-41, Lys-50, and Tyr-51 for p97 binding, using a site-directed mutagenesis approach. Altering residues Asn-41 and Lys-50 of the PUB domain of human PNGase to alanine, either alone or in combination, did not result in a significant decrease in p97 binding as compared with the wild-type PUB domain (Fig. 5A, lanes 4-7). The combined mutation of residues Lys-50 and Tyr-51 led only to a slight reduction in p97 binding (lane 8). In contrast, mutation of all three conserved residues almost completely abolished binding of p97 to the mutant PUB domain (lane 9). To verify that the three amino acid exchanges did not affect the overall protein structure, we determined the crystal structure of the NKY41,50,51AAA mutant PUB domain. The structure of the triple mutant PUB domain is identical to that of the native protein, and the Cα atoms can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 0.17 Å (Fig. 5B). The lack of binding activity of the mutated domain is therefore solely the result of the removal of functionally important side chains, indicating that the conserved surface patch comprising residues Asn-41, Lys-50, and Tyr-51 forms part of the major p97 binding site on the PUB domain. Many p97 cofactors, including the heterodimer Ufd1/Npl4 and members of the large family of UBX domain-containing proteins, bind to the amino-terminal N domain of p97 (29Buchberger A. Howard M.J. Proctor M. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 30Yuan X. Shaw A. Zhang X. Kondo H. Lally J. Freemont P.S. Matthews S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31Dreveny I. Pye V.E. Beuron F. Briggs L.C. Isaacson R.L. Matthews S.J. McKeown C. Yuan X. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We therefore tested in NMR chemical shift-mapping experiments whether the PUB domain of human PNGase similarly binds to the N domain of p97. However, unlike the p47 UBX domain (32Dreveny I. Kondo H. Uchiyama K. Shaw A. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the PUB domain did not show detectable binding to the isolated N domain of p97 (data not shown). To test whether the PUB domain binds to the D1 and/or D2 ATPase domains of p97, we repeated the pulldown experiment with a truncated p97 variant lacking the N domain, p97ΔN. p97ΔN bound efficiently and specifically to the PUB domains of PNGase and UBXD1 (Fig. 5C), showing that the PUB domain binding site resides within the D1 and/or D2 ATPase domains of p97. The distinct binding regions of p97 for the PUB versus UBX domains raised the possibility that both domains can bind simultaneously to p97. Indeed, incubation of p97 with a 10-fold molar excess of the UBX domain proteins p47 or FAF1 did not prevent its binding to the PUB domain in a GST pulldown experiment (Fig. 5D, lanes 7-9), suggesting that binding of UBX and PUB domains is not mutually exclusive. Consistent with this interpretation, significant binding of p47 and FAF1 to the GST-PUB domain fusion was observed in the presence, but not the absence, of p97 (compare lanes 8 and 9 with lanes 10 and 11). To ensure that the amount of PUB domain used in this experiment was saturating with respect to p97, we performed a titration experiment with increasing amounts of GST-PUB domain fusion protein (Fig. 5E). We found that the lowest PUB domain concentration, which had been used in the previous experiments, was already saturating, because no additional p97 bound to a 5-fold higher concentration (lanes 3-5). Consistently, the amount of p47 bound to p97 remained constant even at the highest concentration of PUB domain used (lanes 6-8), whereas no p47 bound to the PUB domain in the absence of p97 (lane 9). Taken together, these data demonstrate that binding of the PUB domain and of UBX domain proteins to p97 is not mutually exclusive. p97 is a chaperone-like molecular machine involved in a variety of cellular functions, including protein degradation, membrane fusion, and cell cycle regulation (31Dreveny I. Pye V.E. Beuron F. Briggs L.C. Isaacson R.L. Matthews S.J. McKeown C. Yuan X. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33Woodman P.G. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This remarkable versatility of p97 depends critically on its ability to form complexes with a number of different cofactors mediating distinct activities (31Dreveny I. Pye V.E. Beuron F. Briggs L.C. Isaacson R.L. Matthews S.J. McKeown C. Yuan X. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Substrate-recruiting cofactors including the heterodimer Ufd1/Npl4 and members of the large UBX protein family regulate the substrate specificity of p97 (26Schuberth C. Richly H. Rumpf S. Buchberger A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 34Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2181-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), while substrate-processing cofactors like the ubiquitin chain elongation enzyme Ufd2 or the deubiquitinylating enzymes VCIP135 and Otu1 determine the fate of p97 substrates (31Dreveny I. Pye V.E. Beuron F. Briggs L.C. Isaacson R.L. Matthews S.J. McKeown C. Yuan X. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 35Rumpf S. Jentsch S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, a significant number of p97-binding proteins exist whose mechanism of action on p97 is still poorly characterized, among them PNGase (17Li G. Zhou X. Zhao G. Schindelin H. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15809-15814Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In a structural approach to investigate p97 cofactor functions, we solved the three-dimensional structure of the PUB domain of human PNGase. Although the structure did not possess significant similarities to known proteins, it revealed a conserved surface patch suggestive of a functionally important site (Fig. 4). Indeed, our biochemical analysis showed that the PUB domain is a novel p97 binding module and that the conserved surface patch is a major p97 binding site (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the PUB domain does not bind to the N domain of p97, unlike the well established substrate-recruiting cofactors Ufd1/Npl4 and p47, but rather to the D1 and/or D2 ATPase domains. Consequently, binding of the PUB domain is not mutually exclusive with binding of substrate-recruiting UBX proteins (Figs. 5, D and E). The use of a different binding site on p97 by the PUB domain could simply allow the assembly of larger complexes on p97. Alternatively, the interaction with the D1 and/or D2 domains may enable the PUB domain to coordinate the ATP hydrolysis-dependent substrate-extracting activity of p97 with PNGase-catalyzed deglycosylation and substrate-processing activities of other cofactors, perhaps including the proteasomal targeting factor HR23B (9Katiyar S. Li G. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13774-13779Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Li G. Zhou X. Zhao G. Schindelin H. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15809-15814Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our finding that the two distantly related PUB domains of human PNGase and human UBXD1 both bind to p97 (Fig. 5A) suggests strongly that PUB domain-containing proteins constitute a novel family of p97 cofactors. PUB domain proteins are found in the plant and animal kingdoms and are particularly common in trypanosomes, which contain several unique families of PUB domain-containing proteins (36Iyer L.M. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The PUB domain is often found in proteins that also contain domains associated with ubiquitin conjugation and removal (Fig. 1). It is tempting to speculate that these proteins coordinate assembly and/or processing of ubiquitin chains with p97 function. UBXD1-like proteins containing both PUB and UBX domains together are evolutionary conserved and represent the most widespread group of PUB domain proteins (28Carim-Todd L. Escarceller M. Estivill X. Sumoy L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1517: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although none of these proteins has been characterized in any detail, the simultaneous presence of two p97 binding domains suggests that UBXD1-like proteins may be important regulators of p97 function. Intriguingly, the major p97 binding motif found in most UBX domains (residues FPR in the turn between strands 3 and 4 of the UBX domain) (29Buchberger A. Howard M.J. Proctor M. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 32Dreveny I. Kondo H. Uchiyama K. Shaw A. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) is significantly altered in UBXD1-like proteins (28Carim-Todd L. Escarceller M. Estivill X. Sumoy L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1517: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Buchberger A. Howard M.J. Proctor M. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), thus potentially decreasing the affinity for p97. We speculate that the presence of a second p97 binding module (the PUB domain) within UBXD1-like proteins allowed for the modulation of the binding properties of the UBX domain during evolution. It will be interesting to study the details of such a dual p97 binding mechanism. The identification of PUB domain proteins as an entire new family of potential p97 cofactors further emphasizes the key role of substrate-recruiting and substrate-processing proteins for the regulation of the p97 molecular machine and opens a new direction for the investigation of p97 functions in various organisms.

Therefore, Rheb appears to have two separate functions: mTOR activation and B-Raf inhibition. However, whether Rheb influences the activity of other members of the Raf kinase family is not known. It is also not known whether Rheb inhibition of B-Raf impacts the association of B-Raf with Ras and C-Raf. We demonstrate here that Rheb activation inhibits the kinase activity of C-Raf and strongly inhibits the heterodimerization of B-Raf and C-Raf. We also found that Rheb inhibits the association between B-Raf and H-Ras. Our data position Rheb as a key regulator of the Ras/B-Raf/C-Raf/MEK signaling cascade, with implications for the pathogenesis of TSC and for the design of targeted strategies to inhibit Raf kinases. Cells, Constructs, siRNA, and Antibodies—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). The Tsc2-/- p53-/- and Tsc2+/+ p53-/- MEFs were the gifts of Dr. David Kwiatkowski (Dept. of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). When indicated, cells were serum-deprived for 18 h. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Where indicated, cells were treated for 24 h with 20 nm rapamycin (Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA). The B-Raf kinase mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and fully sequence-confirmed. The C-Raf cDNA and the C-Raf mutant S338D/Y341D/T491E/S494D (DEDD) were the gifts of Dr. Kun-Liang Guan (Life Sciences Institute, Dept. of Biological Chemistry, Institute of Gerontology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). For siRNA down-regulation of TSC2 or Rheb, cells were transfected with 100 nm of either TSC2 SMARTpool siRNA or Rheb SMARTpool siRNA or nonspecific control siRNA (both from Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) using Trans-IT TKO transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison WI). The following antibodies were used: anti-tuberin C20, anti-B-Raf (F-7), anti-C-Raf (E10), and anti-H-Ras (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phospho-Ser-235/236 S6 ribosomal protein, anti-Myc, anti-HA, and anti-phospho-Ser-217/222 MEK1, anti-phospho-Thr-202/Tyr-204-p42/44 MAPK (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); anti phospho-Raf-1 (Ser-338) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); and anti-HA-agarose, anti-FLAG EZview (Sigma). In Vitro Kinase Assays—Cells were lysed in ice-cold kinase assay lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease and phosphatase inhibitors) after serum deprivation, growth factor, or serum stimulation. B-Raf or C-Raf kinase activity was measured using the following direct method. Immunoprecipitated B-Raf or C-Raf was incubated with recombinant MEK1 (Upstate) in the presence of either [32P]ATP or cold ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. MEK1 was then resolved using SDS-PAGE, and 32P incorporation was visualized by autoradiography. For experiments using cold ATP, MEK1 phosphorylation was detected using the phospho-MEK1 (Ser-217/222) antibody. Immunoprecipitation—For the co-immunoprecipitation analyses, cells were lysed in cold buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7. The immunoprecipitation of endogenous C-Raf was performed using anti-C-Raf (E10) and endogenous B-Raf using anti-B-Raf (F7) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed for co-immunoprecipitated proteins. For immunoprecipitations prior to in vitro kinase assays, cells were lysed in kinase assay lysis buffer. Immune complexes were washed four times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 15 mm dithiothreitol). Statistics—Data from at least three independent experiments were quantified by densitometry, normalized to circumvent inter-experimental differences, and expressed as means ± S.E. The paired Student t test was used to detect statistically significant differences. Significance was achieved at p < 0.05. Rheb Decreases C-Raf Phosphorylation at Ser-338 and C-Raf Kinase Activity in a Rapamycin-insensitive Manner—We first asked whether Rheb influences the activity of C-Raf kinase. Phosphorylation of C-Raf on Ser-338 is correlated with C-Raf activity and is required for serum-induced C-Raf activation (24Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J.

We expressed Rheb in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated endogenous C-Raf from cells under both serum starvation and serum stimulation conditions. Phosphorylation of Ser-338 of endogenous C-Raf, which was low under serum-deprivation conditions, was strongly stimulated by the addition of fetal bovine serum. This serum-induced phosphorylation of endogenous C-Raf was inhibited ∼3.5-fold by Rheb expression (Fig. 1A). To determine whether Rheb inhibition of C-Raf Ser-338 phosphorylation is mTOR-Raptor-dependent or independent, we preincubated the cells with 20 nm rapamycin for 24 h. Rapamycin treatment did not impact the magnitude of Rheb inhibition of C-Raf Ser-338 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A), indicating that the inhibition is mTOR-Raptor-independent.FIGURE 1Rheb decreases C-Raf phosphorylation at Ser-338 and kinase activity in a rapamycin-resistant manner. A, endogenous C-Raf was immunoprecipitated from serum-starved or serum-stimulated HEK293 cells. Rheb expression decreased C-Raf phosphorylation at Ser-338 ∼3-fold after 10 min of serum stimulation. Rapamycin had no effect on Rheb inhibition of C-Raf phosphorylation. B, the activity of immunoprecipitated C-Raf was measured using MEK1 as substrate. Co-expression of Rheb inhibited C-Raf kinase activity and Ser-338 phosphorylation in the presence of serum by ∼2-fold. 24 h of rapamycin treatment did not block Rheb inhibition of C-Raf activity. The results of three independent experiments were normalized and compared (*, p < 0.05 by Student's paired t test). C, wild-type and DDED mutant C-Raf were expressed in HEK 293 cells. The in vitro kinase activity of C-Raf-DDED was not inhibited by co-expression of Q64L Rheb. D, tuberin down-regulation using siRNA decreased the activity of C-Raf in the presence of serum, using MEK1 as substrate and detected using either the phospho-MEK1 antibody or 32P-labeled MEK1 (upper panel). The results of three independent experiments were normalized and compared. E, Rheb down-regulation using siRNA increased the phosphorylation of endogenous C-Raf at Ser-338, in both serum-starved and serum-stimulated conditions (upper panel). We achieved ∼70% of Rheb down-regulation at the mRNA level compared with control siRNA, as determined by real-time PCR (data not shown). The results of three independent experiments were normalized and compared.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As a separate means to confirm Rheb inhibition of C-Raf activation, we expressed C-Raf with or without Rheb, and measured the in vitro kinase activity of C-Raf using recombinant MEK1 as a substrate. Rheb expression decreased the activity and Ser-338 phosphorylation of C-Raf kinase in a rapamycin-resistant manner (Fig. 1B). The average inhibition of C-Raf activity by Rheb in five separate experiments was 2.6-fold (p < 0.05). We also tested a constitutively active form of C-Raf, S338D/Y341D/T491E/S494D (C-Raf-DDED) (28Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The Q64L mutant form of Rheb, which more strongly activates mTOR (18Inoki K. Li Y. Xu T. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), failed to inhibit C-Raf-DDED (Fig. 1C). Because these experiments involve Rheb overexpression, we next asked whether activation of endogenous Rheb inhibits C-Raf kinase activity. To activate endogenous Rheb, we used siRNA to down-regulate tuberin (the GTPase-activating protein for Rheb) in HEK293 cells. Down-regulation of tuberin decreased the in vitro kinase activity of endogenous C-Raf, which was measured using recombinant MEK1 as a substrate (Fig. 1D). Finally, to confirm that C-Raf kinase is inhibited by endogenous Rheb, we down-regulated Rheb using siRNA. Rheb siRNA increased C-Raf phosphorylation by ∼3.1-fold in serum deprivation and 3.3-fold in serum stimulation conditions (Fig. 1E). Rheb Expression Inhibits Heterodimerization of B-Raf and C-Raf in a Rapamycin-insensitive Manner—To investigate the mechanism of C-Raf inhibition by Rheb, we asked whether Rheb physically interacts with C-Raf. We expressed tagged C-Raf and Rheb in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated either Myc-Rheb or FLAG-C-Raf, under both serum starvation and serum stimulation conditions. We were not able to detect an interaction between Rheb and C-Raf (Fig. 2A), in contrast to the interaction between Rheb and B-Raf, which was demonstrated by our group (12Karbowniczek M. Cash T.

These data suggest that Rheb inhibition of C-Raf involves an indirect mechanism and led us to ask whether Rheb-dependent inhibition of C-Raf could be mediated via B-Raf, as C-Raf and B-Raf form functional heterodimers upon Ras or serum stimulation (1Weber C.K.

We hypothesized, therefore, that Rheb inhibition of C-Raf might be the consequence of decreased B-Raf/C-Raf heterodimerization. To test this, we immunoprecipitated endogenous B-Raf from cells transfected with C-Raf. Rheb expression strongly inhibited the association of C-Raf with endogenous B-Raf, in both serum-starved and serum-stimulated cells (Fig. 2B). Rheb inhibition of the B-Raf/C-Raf association was not blocked by 24 h of rapamycin treatment, indicating that it is mTOR-Raptor independent (Fig. 2B). To confirm these results, we immunoprecipitated endogenous C-Raf from cells transfected with B-Raf alone or with Rheb. Rheb expression almost completely blocked B-Raf association with endogenous C-Raf, and again this was rapamycin-insensitive (Fig. 2C). These results, together with the lack of evidence of co-immunoprecipitation of Rheb and C-Raf, suggest that C-Raf inhibition by Rheb is a consequence of decreased B-Raf activity and B-Raf/C-Raf heterodimerization, thereby preventing full activation of C-Raf. The V600E mutation in B-Raf is present in the majority of malignant melanomas and in some ovarian, colorectal, and thyroid cancers (4Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S.

V600E has a basal activity ∼10-fold higher than wild-type B-Raf (4Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J. Woffendin H. Garnett M.J. Bottomley W. Davis N. Dicks E.

Previously, we demonstrated that Rheb does not inhibit V600E B-Raf kinase activity (12Karbowniczek M. Cash T. Cheung M. Robertson G.P. Astrinidis A. Henske E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29930-29937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here, we asked whether Rheb can inhibit the association of V600E B-Raf with C-Raf. We expressed either wild-type B-Raf or V600E B-Raf alone or with Rheb and immunoprecipitated endogenous C-Raf. Rheb expression strongly inhibited the interaction of endogenous C-Raf with V600E B-Raf in both serum deprivation and serum stimulation conditions (Fig. 2D). Rheb Negatively Regulates the Phosphorylation of Ser-446 on B-Raf Kinase—To verify that loss of endogenous tuberin (and consequent activation of endogenous Rheb) is associated with decreased B-Raf activity, we used siRNA to down-regulate endogenous tuberin (TSC2) in HEK293 cells. As expected, tuberin down-regulation decreased the in vitro kinase activity of endogenous B-Raf (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, siRNA down-regulation of tuberin inhibited Ser-446 phosphorylation of endogenous B-Raf (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylation of Ser-446 is correlated with B-Raf activity (24Mason C.S.

To determine whether Rheb inhibition of Ser-446 B-Raf phosphorylation is growth factor-specific, HEK293 cells were serum-starved overnight and then treated for 15 min with platelet-derived growth factor or hepatocyte growth factor or for 30 min with epidermal growth factor. Rheb inhibition of Ser-446 phosphorylation was evident in all three conditions (Fig. 3B). Rheb also inhibited the Ser-446 phosphorylation of V600E B-Raf (Fig. 3C). However, the in vitro kinase activity of V600E B-Raf was not significantly inhibited by Rheb expression (Fig. 3D), suggesting that Ser-446 phosphorylation is not the mechanism through which Rheb inhibits B-Raf. To directly test this, we generated a S446D (phospho-mimetic) mutant form of B-Raf. The in vitro kinase activity of the S446D B-Raf mutant was strongly inhibited by Rheb (Fig. 3E), indicating that Rheb inhibition of B-Raf Ser-446 phosphorylation is independent of Rheb inhibition of B-Raf kinase activity. Rheb also inhibited a double phospho-mimetic mutant form of B-Raf, S446D/S447D (data not shown). These findings indicate that inhibition of Ser-446 phosphorylation is not the mechanism through which Rheb inhibits B-Raf, and are instead consistent with a model in which Rheb directly inhibits B-Raf kinase, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation (see Fig. 5). Rheb did not inhibit a constitutively active form of B-Raf, T599E/S602D (33Zhang B.H. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3E).FIGURE 3Rheb negatively regulates the phosphorylation of B-Raf at S446. A, the Ser-446 phosphorylation and in vitro kinase activity of immunoprecipitated endogenous B-Raf were decreased after siRNA down-regulation of tuberin in HEK293 cells, compared with control siRNA, in serum starvation, continuous growth in serum, and in cells stimulated for 15 min with hepatocyte growth factor. An increase in the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 was seen after tuberin down-regulation, reflecting Rheb activation of mTOR. B, B-Raf and Rheb were expressed in HEK293 cells. Rheb inhibited B-Raf phosphorylation on Ser-446 in serum-starved cells, as well as in serum-starved cells stimulated for 15 min with platelet-derived growth factor (25 ng/ml), hepatocyte growth factor (50 ng/ml), or 30 min with epidermal growth factor (25 ng/ml). The results of four independent experiments were normalized and compared (*, p < 0.05 by Student's paired t test). C, wild-type B-Raf or V600E mutant B-Raf was expressed in HEK293 cells with or without Rheb and B-Raf was immunoprecipitated. The Ser-446 phosphorylation of both wild-type and V600E B-Raf was markedly reduced when Rheb was expressed compared with the vector control. D, expression of Rheb inhibited the activity of wild-type B-Raf, as measured using MEK1 as substrate. Rheb did not inhibit the activity of V600E B-Raf. E, wild-type, S446D and T599E/S602D B-Raf mutants were expressed in HEK 293 cells. The in vitro kinase activity of wild-type and Ser-446 mutant form of B-Raf (S446D), but not T599E/S602D, were inhibited by co-expression of Rheb, in both serum starvation (left panel) and serum stimulation (right panel) conditions. The results of three independent experiments were normalized and compared.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Working model. Our data are consistent with a model in which Rheb directly binds B-Raf resulting in disruption of the B-Raf/H-Ras association in a S445-dependent manner, and inhibition of the heterodimerization of B-Raf with C-Raf, with subsequent inhibition of C-Raf activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Rheb Inhibits Ras Binding to B-Raf—We next turned our attention to the interaction between B-Raf and Ras. B-Raf in vitro kinase activity is enhanced by the addition of Ras (34Shimizu K. Kuroda S. Yamamori B. Matsuda S. Kaibuchi K. Yamauchi T. Isobe T. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22917-22920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and activated Ras stimulates the heterodimerization of B-Raf and C-Raf (1Weber C.K. Slupsky J.R. Kalmes H.A. Rapp U.R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3595-3598PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether Rheb influences Ras binding to B-Raf. First, we confirmed that B-Raf is inhibited in Tsc2-/- MEFs, in which endogenous Rheb is activated. The in vitro kinase activity of endogenous B-Raf kinase was inhibited in Tsc2-/- MEFs, compared with Tsc2+/+ MEFs, in both serum starvation and serum stimulation conditions (Fig. 4A). We then asked whether Rheb activation in the Tsc2-/- MEFs impacts the association of Ras with B-Raf by using siRNA to down-regulate Rheb and immunoprecipitating endogenous B-Raf. Rheb down-regulation in Tsc2-/- MEFs significantly enhanced the binding of endogenous H-Ras and B-Raf (Fig. 4B). To confirm this finding, we expressed B-Raf and the hyperactive Q64L Rheb in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated endogenous H-Ras. Rheb very strongly inhibited the association of endogenous H-Ras association with B-Raf in both serum starvation and serum stimulation conditions (Fig. 4C). Ras Binding to B-Raf Is S446-dependent—Because we had found that Rheb inhibits both B-Raf Ser-446 phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B) and B-Raf association with H-Ras (Fig. 4, B and C), we next asked whether B-Raf Ser-446 phosphorylation influences the B-Raf/H-Ras interaction. We generated S446A (non-phosphorylatable) and S446D (phospho-mimetic) forms of B-Raf and expressed them with B-Raf in HEK293 cells. The S446A B-Raf bound substantially less H-Ras than the S446D or wild-type B-Raf (Fig. 4D), suggesting that Ser-446 phosphorylation regulates the interaction between B-Raf and Ras. Furthermore, whereas Rheb expression disrupted the interaction between wild-type B-Raf and H-Ras (Fig. 4C), Rheb did not disrupt the association between S446D B-Raf and H-Ras (Fig. 4E). These results suggest that Ser-446 phosphorylation of B-Raf promotes the association of B-Raf and Ras, possibly due to conformational changes and/or release of B-Raf autoinhibition. Taken together, our data lead to a model (Fig. 5) in which Rheb directly interacts with and inhibits B-Raf kinase. This direct interaction inhibits C-Raf/B-Raf heterodimerization, with consequent decrease in C-Raf activity, and decreases Ser-446 B-Raf phosphorylation, resulting in inhibition of the B-Raf-H-Ras interaction. The Ras/B-Raf/C-Raf signaling network plays an essential role in normal development and is activated in many forms of cancer. Rheb is known to inhibit the activity of B-Raf kinase, but whether Rheb has a broader impact on this network has not been previously addressed. Here, we report that Rheb inhibits the activity of C-Raf kinase, the heterodimerization of B-Raf and C-Raf, and the interaction of B-Raf with H-Ras. We found that Rheb decreases C-Raf activity and C-Raf Ser-338 phosphorylation, a site that is strongly linked to C-Raf activity. However, Rheb did not completely block Ser-338 phosphorylation, suggesting that Rheb-independent factors are also involved. In contrast to the B-Raf-Rheb interaction that is evident at endogenous expression levels (12Karbowniczek M. Cash T. Cheung M. Robertson G.P. Astrinidis A. Henske E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29930-29937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we did not detect an interaction between C-Raf and Rheb in vivo. This suggests that Rheb inhibition of C-Raf is indirect, potentially mediated via Rheb inhibition of B-Raf/C-Raf heterodimerization. Heterodimerization of B-Raf and C-Raf is recognized as a significant mechanism of Raf kinase regulation (1Weber C.K. Slupsky J.R. Kalmes H.A. Rapp U.R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3595-3598PubMed Google Scholar, 2Garnett M.J. Rana S. Paterson H. Barford D. Marais R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 963-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor does stimulate C-Raf in B-Raf-deficient fibroblasts (29Wojnowski L. Stancato L.F. Larner A.C. Rapp U.R. Zimmer A. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and depletion of B-Raf inhibits C-Raf activity (35Mizutani S. Inouye K. Koide H. Kaziro Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that this intricate signaling network, in which B-Raf modifies MEK activity through C-Raf, provides subtle regulation of signaling intensity or duration (2Garnett M.J. Rana S. Paterson H. Barford D. Marais R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 963-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with a model in which Rheb inhibition of C-Raf kinase activity is the result of decreased B-Raf activity and subsequent decreased B-Raf/C-Raf heterodimerization. To our knowledge, Rheb is the first small GTPase shown to inhibit B-Raf/C-Raf heterodimerization. We hypothesize that Rheb binding to B-Raf induces a conformational change in B-Raf, which inhibits S446-B-Raf phosphorylation and subsequent Ras activation and inhibits B-Raf/C-Raf heterodimerization and subsequent C-Raf activity. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Rheb inhibition of C-Raf is mediated by a Raf phosphatase. Rheb also inhibits the interaction of B-Raf and H-Ras in a B-Raf S446-dependent manner. These data suggest that one consequence of Rheb binding to B-Raf is decreased Ser-446 phosphorylation, resulting in enhanced B-Raf autoinhibition and inhibition of Ras binding. The clinical consequences of Rheb inhibition of the Ras/B-Raf/C-Raf network in cells carrying mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 is not yet known. Tumors in TSC patients, including renal angiomyolipomas and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas exhibit aberrant differentiation patterns (36Karbowniczek M. Yu J. Henske E.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 37Astrinidis A. Henske E.P. J. Child Neurol. 2004; 19: 710-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which may be mediated by Raf kinases. Abnormal angiogenesis occurs in TSC angiomyolipomas and angiofibromas, which is intriguing because B-Raf-deficient mice have vascular defects (29Wojnowski L. Stancato L.F. Larner A.C. Rapp U.R. Zimmer A. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). B-Raf is required for the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (38Yoon S. Seger R. Choi E.J. Yoo Y.S. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2004; 69: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), so it is also possible that Rheb regulation of Raf kinases contributes to the neurological manifestations of TSC, which can include mental retardation and autism. Rapamycin is currently being used in clinical trials for TSC patients. Because Rheb inhibition of B-Raf and C-Raf is rapamycin-insensitive, it will be of particular interest to examine the phenotypes of TSC tumors after rapamycin therapy. Finally, it is possible that the two independent growth-related functions of Rheb (B-Raf/C-Raf inhibition and mTOR activation) may naturally limit the ability of Rheb to induce tumor growth, contributing to the fact that the vast majority of tumors in TSC patients are benign. In conclusion, we found that Rheb inhibits C-Raf, B-Raf/C-Raf heterodimerization, and B-Raf/H-Ras association, revealing a novel mechanism of Raf signaling regulation. The activity of tuberin and Rheb are regulated by growth factor signals, nutrient availability, and energy status. Therefore, our data position Rheb as an integrator of upstream cues to modulate Raf activity. This function of Rheb may be related to the unusual aspects of tumorigenesis in TSC patients, including aberrant vascular development and abnormal cellular differentiation patterns. Raf kinase inhibition is an active area of cancer research, with the Raf inhibitor Sorafenib approved for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma in 2006 (10Beeram M. Patnaik A. Rowinsky E.K. J. Clin. Oncol. 2005; 23: 6771-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and other pharmacological inhibitors in development. Defining the precise role of Rheb in the regulation of Raf kinases could lead to novel approaches for targeted Raf kinase inhibition. We are grateful to Drs. Jon Chernoff, Erica Golemis, and Victoria Robb for their critical reviews of this manuscript."

CCL5 binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on the cell surface or in extracellular matrix sequesters CCL5, thereby immobilizing CCL5 to provide the directional signal. In two CCR5-expressing human T cell lines, PM1.CCR5 and MOLT4.CCR5, and in human peripheral blood-derived T cells, micromolar concentrations of CCL5 induce apoptosis. CCL5-induced cell death involves the cytosolic release of cytochrome c, the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. CCL5-induced apoptosis is CCR5-dependent, since native PM1 and MOLT4 cells lacking CCR5 expression are resistant to CCL5-induced cell death. Furthermore, we implicate tyrosine 339 as a critical residue involved in CCL5-induced apoptosis, since PM1 cells expressing a tyrosine mutant receptor, CCR5Y339F, do not undergo apoptosis. We show that CCL5-CCR5-mediated apoptosis is dependent on cell surface GAG binding. The addition of exogenous heparin and chondroitin sulfate and GAG digestion from the cell surface protect cells from apoptosis. Moreover, the non-GAG binding variant, (44AANA47)-CCL5, fails to induce apoptosis. To address the role of aggregation in CCL5-mediated apoptosis, nonaggregating CCL5 mutant E66S, which forms dimers, and E26A, which form tetramers at micromolar concentrations, were utilized. Unlike native CCL5, the E66S mutant fails to induce apoptosis, suggesting that tetramers are the minimal higher ordered CCL5 aggregates required for CCL5-induced apoptosis. Viewed altogether, these data suggest that CCL5-GAG binding and CCL5 aggregation are important for CCL5 activity in T cells, specifically in the context of CCR5-mediated apoptosis.

Chemokines were originally identified for their selective chemoattractant and proadhesive effects. They are responsible for directing leukocyte migration by forming chemokine gradients and triggering firm arrest by activating integrins on the leukocyte cell surface. It is now apparent that chemokines exhibit critical functions in many diverse developmental and immunological operations (1Nagasawa T. Hirota S. Tachibana K. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Kitamura Y.

Interestingly, CCL5 is preferentially chemotactic for T cells of the Th1 and memory phenotype (7Schall T.J. Bacon K. Toy K.J. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1990; 347: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 8Siveke J.T. Hamann A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 550-554PubMed Google Scholar). This may be due to CCL5 binding to CCR5, which is predominantly expressed on memory Th1 T cells (9Rabin R.L. Park M.K. Liao F. Swofford R. Stephany D. Farber J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3840-3850PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kawai T. Seki M. Hiromatsu K. Eastcott J.W. Watts G.F. Sugai M. Smith D.J. Porcelli S.A. Taubman M.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3269-3278PubMed Google Scholar). Given the prevalence of memory Th1 T cells in inflammatory diseases and the coincident increased expression of CCL5 and CCR5, CCL5-CCR5-mediated events in T cells may be critical in disease pathogenesis (11Luster A.D.

CCL5 is a T cell co-stimulatory molecule in the context of CD3 stimulation (6Makino Y. Cook D.N. Smithies O. Hwang O.Y. Neilson E.G. Turka L.A. Sato H. Wells A.D. Danoff T.M. Clin.

Mice deficient in CCL5 demonstrate impaired T cell proliferation and cytokine production in response to antigen or anti-CD3 stimulation (6Makino Y. Cook D.N. Smithies O. Hwang O.Y. Neilson E.G. Turka L.A. Sato H. Wells A.D. Danoff T.M. Clin. Immunol. 2002; 102: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Anti-CD3 stimulation of T cells together with 0.1 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml (nanomolar) CCL5 treatment results in proliferation and cytokine production (13Taub D.D. Turcovski-Corrales S.M. Key M.L. Longo D.L. Murphy W.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2095-2103PubMed Google Scholar). At higher, 1 μm (micromolar) concentrations, CCL5 stimulates antigen-independent activation of T cells in terms of cell proliferation, increased CD25 membrane expression, and cytokine production, indicating that high doses of CCL5 can bypass T cell receptor recognition of antigen to activate T cells (14Dairaghi D.J.

Science. 1995; 269: 1727-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). At these micromolar concentrations, CCL5 forms large oligomers with a mass greater than 100 kDa (16Appay V. Brown A.

Whether the interaction of CCL5 with GAGs induces cellular activation through a novel signaling mechanism is not clear. However, CCL5 and its interaction with GAGs facilitate oligomerization and probably contribute to efficient receptor presentation. In this study, we examined CCL5 activity in T cells in the context of GAG binding, aggregation, and apoptosis. We present evidence that CCL5 aggregates form at high ligand concentrations to induce apoptosis in T cell lines and in primary human T cells in a CCR5-dependent manner. We show that CCL5-induced apoptosis involves the cytosolic release of the mitochondrial proapoptotic factor cytochrome c, the activation of caspase-9 and -3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Additionally, we provide evidence for the critical role of intracellular tyrosine residue 339 of CCR5 in mediating cell death that is independent of G-protein-mediated events. Finally, we show that CCL5-GAG interactions and CCL5 oligomerization are important prerequisites to initiate a cascade of events resulting in T cell death. Taken together, our data suggest a potential novel role for CCL5 in determining T cell fate during an immunological response.

Preparation of Primary T Cells—Human peripheral blood-derived T cells were isolated from healthy donors. For activation, 106 resting T cells/ml were cultured with 1 μg/ml phyto-hemagglutinin and 2 ng/ml interleukin-12 for 2 days and then cultured for an additional 3 days in the presence of 100 units/ml human recombinant interleukin-2. T cells were then stained with anti-human CCR5 antibody (2D7) and sorted for CCR5– and CCR5+ T cells. Sorted cells were >95% CD3-positive. Chondroitinase ABC Treatment—Actively growing PM1.CCR5 cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml CCL5 for 24 h. In experiments where cellular surface GAGs were enzymatically digested, cells were first resuspended at 5 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI containing 0% fetal calf serum and treated with chondroitinase ABC (1 unit/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were then washed three times and incubated with 10 μg/ml CCL5 for 24 h and analyzed by annexin V/7-amino actinomycin D (7-AAD) analysis. For experiments where cell surface CCL5 was measured, PM1.CCR5 cells either untreated or pretreated with chondroitinase ABC were incubated with 10 μg/ml CCL5 for 1 h on ice. Cells were collected, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and stained with anti-human CCL5 antibody (R & D Systems) followed by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. As isotype controls, cells were incubated with FITC-labeled isotype control IgG antibody (eBioscience) and analyzed by flow cytometry. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide, Annexin V/7-AAD Staining, and DNA Fragmentation Assay—The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was performed as previously described (31Uddin S. Fish E.N. Sher D. Gardziola C. Colamonici O.R. Kellum M. Pitha P.M. White M.F. Platanias L.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 2574-2582PubMed Google Scholar). Annexin V-FITC and 7-AAD staining were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences). Briefly, native PM1, PM1.CCR5, native MOLT-4, and MOLT-4.CCR5 cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml CCL5 for 24 h. Cells were then collected, and 1 × 105 cells were incubated in 100 μl of binding buffer together with annexin V-FITC and 7-AAD for 15 min. Samples were analyzed immediately by flow cytometry (FACS-Calibur). DNA fragmentation was analyzed using an apoptotic DNA ladder kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA isolated from cells was resolved in a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized by a UV light source (Fluro-S MultiImager; Bio-Rad). JC-1 Staining for Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—PM1.CCR5 cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml CCL5 for the times indicated, pelleted by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in warm phosphate-buffered saline at 1 × 106 cells/ml. JC-1 was added at a final concentration of 2 μm and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min. Cells were washed two times in PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur). Subcellular Fractionation—Cytosolic fractions were isolated using a mitochondrial fractionation kit (Active Motif; catalog number 40015) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-cytochrome c antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml CCL5 for the times indicated, pelleted by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentration in lysates was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. 40 μg of protein lysate/sample was denatured in 5× sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, followed by blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in TBS for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were probed with the specified antibodies. Proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system (Pierce). Flow Cytometric Analysis—1 × 106 cells were incubated with anti-human CCR5, followed by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. As isotype controls, cells were incubated with FITC-labeled isotype control IgG antibody (eBioscience) and analyzed using the FACSCalibur and CellQuest software. Cells were gated based on forward and side scatter. For intracellular caspase-3 activity analysis, 1 × 106 cells were treated with CCL5 for the indicated times, fixed, and permeabilized with 0.5% saponin on ice. Cells were then incubated with FITC-labeled anti-active caspase-3 (Transduction Laboratories) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Notably, the anti-human CCR5 antibody recognizes ectopically expressed intact CCR5 and CCR5Y339F. CCR5 Site-directed Mutagenesis and PM1 Transfection—The pEF-BOS-CCR5 carrying the human CCR5 gene was obtained from Dr. Martin Oppermann (University of Gottingen, Germany). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the pEF-BOS-CCR5 vectors. Single Y339F mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the following primers: 5′-gcgagcaagctcagttttcacccgatccactgggg-3′ (forward) 5′-cgctcgttcgagtcaaaagtgggctaggtgacccc-3′ (reverse). Mutation was confirmed by sequencing (ACGT Corp., Toronto, Canada). Intact CCR5 and CCR5Y339F genes were then subcloned into the pUMFG retroviral vector (a gift from Dr. Jeffery Medin, Division of Experimental Therapeutics, Toronto General Research Institute). The amphotropic packaging cell line Phoenix was transfected by the calcium phosphate/chloroquine method. At 48 h post-transfection, the viral supernatant was collected and used for PM1 transfection, as described (32Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Positive transfectants were FACS-sorted using antihuman CCR5 antibody and used for subsequent experiments. Statistical Analysis—A paired t test was used to determine the statistical significance of differences between groups. Micromolar Concentrations of CCL5 Induce Apoptosis in CCR5-expressing T Cells—Chemokines and their receptors have been implicated in determining survival (33Boehme S.A. Lio F.M. Maciejewski-Lenoir D.

To investigate the biological consequences of CCL5-CCR5 interactions on T cell survival or death, PM1.CCR5 T cells were treated with different doses of CCL5, and the viability of cells was assessed by the apoptosis marker annexin V and the permeability indicator 7-AAD. At 10 ng/ml to 1 μg/ml (nanomolar) doses, CCL5 treatment did not affect viability, but at 10 μg/ml (micromolar) doses, CCL5 induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A). Classical apoptotic cell death may be distinguished by DNA fragmentation, revealed when cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin or 10 μg/ml of CCL5 (Fig. 1B). Additionally, we confirmed that 10 μg/ml CCL5 induced apoptosis in PM1.CCR5 and another CCR5-expressing T cell line, MOLT-4.CCR5 (Fig. 1C). By contrast, native PM1 and MOLT-4 cells lacking CCR5 expression were not susceptible to CCL5-inducible apoptotic cell death (Fig. 1, D and E). Notably, the PM1 and MOLT-4 cell lines do not express CCR1, an alternate receptor for CCL5 in T cells.FIGURE 1Micromolar concentrations of CCL5 induce apoptosis in PM1.CCR5 T cells. A, 2 × 105 PM1.CCR5 cells/ml were treated with varying doses of CCL5 for 24 h, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was detected by staining with annexin V-FITC and 7-AAD. Data are representative of three independent experiments (mean ± S.D.) **, p < 0.01. B, 2 × 105 PM1.CCR5 cells/ml were either left untreated (control) or treated with CCL5 (10 μg/ml) for either 24 or 48 h. A DNA fragmentation assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin (P + I) for 24 h served as a positive control. Data are representative of two independent experiments. C, 2 × 105 PM1.CCR5 and MOLT-4.CCR5 T cells/ml were either left untreated or treated with 10μg/ml CCL5 for 24 h. Apoptotic cells were detected by staining with annexin V-FITC and 7-AAD. The percentage of the cell population in each quadrant is indicated to the right of each FACS blot. Data are representative of five independent experiments. D, cell surface CCR5 expression was determined for native PM1, PM1.CCR5, native MOLT-4, and MOLT-4.CCR5 cells by FACS. The dotted line represents the fluorescence intensity using an FITC-labeled isotype control IgG antibody. The thick solid line and the gray solid line represent the fluorescence intensity using primary anti-CCR5 antibody in conjunction with the secondary anti-mouse FITC. Data are representative of three independent experiments. E, 2 × 105 native PM1 and native MOLT-4 cells/ml were either left untreated or treated with 10μg/ml CCL5 for 24 h. Apoptotic cells were detected by staining with annexin V-FITC and 7-AAD. The percentage of the cell population in each quadrant is indicated to the right of each FACS blot. Data are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CCL5-induced Cell Death Is Mediated by the Mitochondrial/Apoptosome Pathway—At nanomolar doses, CCL5 acts as a costimulatory signal for T cells. Indeed, costimulation through CD28 in the context of CD3 protects cells from activation-induced cell death (38Noel P.J. Boise L.H. Green J.M. Thompson C.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 636-642PubMed Google Scholar, 39Collette Y. Benziane A. Razanajaona D. Olive D. Blood. 1998; 92: 1350-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps at micromolar doses, CCL5 bypasses the T cell receptor to induce apoptosis. The CD95/CD95L apoptotic pathway has been studied extensively in CD4+ T cells. We did not observe any change in CD95 or CD95L expression following CCL5 treatment in extensive time course studies (data not shown). Moreover, pretreatment of cultures with the anti-CD95L monoclonal antibody, NOK1, did not prevent CCL5-mediated apoptosis (data not shown). Changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability (ΔΨm) led to the efflux of apoptotic factors, the release of cytochrome c, apoptosome formation, and finally chromatin clumping and DNA fragmentation. Accordingly, we examined CCL5-inducible changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and observed a time-dependent reduction in ΔΨm (Fig. 2A). Indeed, the results in Fig. 2B reveal a CCL5-inducible and time-dependent accumulation of cytochrome c in the cytosol in PM1.CCR5 cells, which is maximal at 12 h. We observed a concomitant cleavage of caspase-9 (37-kDa fragment) and caspase-3 (17- and 19-kDa fragments) at 8 h that is sustained for 24 h (Fig. 2C). The activation of caspase-3 was further confirmed by intracellular FACS analysis using the anti-active caspase-3 antibody; at 10 h post-CCL5 treatment, active caspase-3 was detected (Fig. 2D). Finally, we examined the cleavage of the endogenous caspase-3 substrate PARP in similar time course studies. The 85-kDa cleavage fragment of PARP was detected at 8 h post-CCL5 treatment and to a greater extent at 16 h (Fig. 2E). Micromolar Concentrations of CCL5 Induce Apoptosis in CCR5-expressing Primary T Cells—Human primary T cells were isolated from peripheral blood from healthy donors and activated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were subsequently sorted based on cell surface CCR5 expression and were >95% CD3 positive (Fig. 3A). To further investigate the biological consequences of CCL5-CCR5 interactions in primary T cells, CCR5+ and CCR5– primary T cells were treated with CCL5 for 24 h. Consistent with our data for PM1.CCR5 cultures, CCL5-inducible apoptosis was dependent on CCR5 expression and did not occur at 100 ng/ml to 1 μg/ml (nanomolar) CCL5 doses but required 10 μg/ml (micromolar) doses (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3C reveals a CCL5-inducible and time-dependent cleavage of caspase-9 (37 kDa) at 2 h that is maximal at 8 h. These data confirm that CCL5 induces apoptosis in T cells in a CCR5- and mitochondrial pathway-dependent manner. Expression of Intact CCR5, but Not CCR5Y339F, Renders PM1 Cells Susceptible to CCL5-inducible Apoptosis—CCL5-mediated CCR5 activation results in the exchange of GTP for GDP by the Gα subunit, the dissociation of heterotrimeric G-proteins into Gα and Gβγ subunits, and subsequent signal transduction. Additionally, we and others have provided evidence for the CCL5-CCR5-dependent recruitment and activation of distinct protein-tyrosine kinases (reviewed in Ref. 40Wong M.M. Fish E.N. Semin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of the α subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins and inhibits G-protein-mediated signal transduction. Accordingly, to determine the contribution of G-protein-coupled events to CCL5-inducible apoptosis, in dose-response experiments we examined the consequence of pertussis toxin treatment and observed no effects (data not shown). To investigate whether phosphorylation of CCR5 on intracellular tyrosine residues influences CCR5-CCR5-mediated apoptosis, the intracellular residue Tyr339 was mutagenized to phenylalanine. Vectors for intact CCR5 and CCR5Y339F cDNA were constructed (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) and introduced into native PM1 cells. Each transfectant was analyzed for cell surface CCR5 expression using an anti-human CCR5 antibody (Fig. 4A), which does not distinguish among the intact or mutant receptors, and clones exhibiting similar ectopic expression levels were selected for use. In subsequent experiments, we examined whether 10 μg/ml (micromola"

A designed protein, 5-Helix, targets the C-terminal region of the gp41 ectodomain, disrupting trimer-of-hairpins formation and blocking viral entry. Here we show that the nanomolar inhibitory potency of 5-Helix (IC50 ∼6 nm) is 4 orders of magnitude larger than its subpicomolar binding affinity (KD ∼0.6 pm). This discrepancy results from the transient exposure of the 5-Helix binding site on gp41. As a consequence, inhibitory potency is determined by the association rate, not by binding affinity. For a series of 5-Helix variants with mutations in their gp41 binding sites, the IC50 and KD values poorly correlate. By contrast, an inverse relationship between IC50 values and association rate constants (kon) extends for over 2 orders of magnitude. The kinetic dependence to inhibition places temporal restrictions on an intermediate state of HIV-1 membrane fusion and suggests that access to the C-terminal region of the gp41 ectodomain is largely free from steric hindrance. Our results support the importance of association kinetics in the development of improved HIV-1 fusion inhibitors.

Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 2Pierson T.C. Doms R.W. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 281: 1-27PubMed Google Scholar). Functional Env is composed of two noncovalently linked subunits, gp120 and gp41, arranged as a trimer of heterodimers on the virion surface. The interaction of gp120 with cellular CD4 and a chemokine receptor promotes structural rearrangements that ultimately lead gp41 to insert its N-terminal fusion peptide segment into the target cell membrane (Fig. 1A). Eventually, gp41 collapses into a stable, compact trimer-of-hairpins conformation essential for efficient membrane fusion (3Root M.J. Steger H.K. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 1805-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The core of the gp41 trimer-of-hairpins is a bundle of six α-helices formed by two hydrophobic heptad repeat sequences (HR1 and HR2) within each of the three gp41 ectodomains (4Lu M. Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 5Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S.

A. 1997; 94: 12303-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The N-terminal HR1 segments form a central, trimeric coiled coil. The C-terminal HR2 segments pack in an antiparallel manner into hydrophobic grooves on the exterior of the HR1 coiled coil. The antiparallel packing of HR1 and HR2 segments ensures that the fusion peptide and transmembrane region of gp41 are brought into close proximity (Fig. 1A). Since the fusion peptide is inserted within the target cell membrane and the transmembrane region is embedded within the viral membrane, formation of the gp41 trimer-of-hairpins promotes the juxtaposition of the two membranes (6Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). The similarity of the gp41 trimer-of-hairpins to the fusion-active conformations of glycoproteins from distantly related enveloped viruses suggests that this structure plays a critical role in promoting viral membrane fusion (see Ref. 3Root M.J. Steger H.K. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 1805-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar and references therein). Peptides derived from the HR2 region of the gp41 ectodomain can disrupt formation of the gp41 trimer-of-hairpins, thereby inhibiting HIV-1 entry (4Lu M. Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct.

Virol. 2003; 77: 7669-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Once bound, they prevent association of the HR1 and HR2 segments, thus blocking viral membrane fusion. That C-peptides bind an intermediate state in the fusion process is supported by the following observations: 1) C-peptides can precipitate gp41 only after Env binds cellular receptors (12Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 13Kilgore N.R. Salzwedel K. Reddick M. Allaway G.P. Wild C.T. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7669-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); 2) the extent of inhibition depends on C-peptide concentration present during membrane fusion and not on preincubation levels (12Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar); 3) conditions that alter the rate of gp41-mediated membrane fusion influence the inhibitory potency of C-peptides (14Reeves J.D.

Durell S. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Blumenthal R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Despite the transient exposure of their binding site, some C-peptides possess potent (low nanomolar) inhibitory activity in vitro. One C-peptide, T20 (enfuvirtide), also demonstrates antiviral activity in vivo and has been approved by the FDA for treatment of HIV-1 infected individuals (18Lalezari J.P. Henry K. O'Hearn M.

In a complementary manner, agents that specifically target the gp41 HR2 segment also block HIV-1 entry. N-peptides, derived from the gp41 HR1 region, can inhibit through this mechanism, but their tendency to aggregate in physiological solutions severely limits their potency (4Lu M. Blacklow S.C.

However, engineered proteins that expose all or part of the HR1 coiled coil in soluble form display potent, broad-spectrum inhibitory activity (mid-picomolar to low nanomolar). In one design strategy, three HR1 and two HR2 segments that form the core of the gp41 trimer-of-hairpins have been linked into a single polypeptide, denoted 5-Helix (23Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). 5-Helix lacks a third HR2 segment, and this vacancy creates a single, high affinity C-peptide binding site.

These chimeric inhibitors expose three C-peptide binding sites, and multiplicity of interaction likely plays a role in their inhibitory mechanism. It is unclear at what point during fusion the gp41 HR2 segment becomes accessible to engineered inhibitors like 5-Helix. Some evidence suggests that these designed proteins might bind the native conformation of Env prior to receptor engagement. Unlike C-peptides, 5-Helix can precipitate Env from cellular and viral membranes in the absence of CD4 or coreceptor (26Root M.J. Hamer D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5016-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Koshiba T. Chan D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7573-7579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This interaction enables a recombinant 5-Helix toxin to kill Env expressing cells without the need for receptor activation (26Root M.J. Hamer D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5016-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the extent of receptor-independent interaction is relatively small and may merely reflect 5-Helix binding to a misfolded, nonfusogenic form of Env. Moreover, the interaction is enhanced in the presence of receptors (26Root M.J. Hamer D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5016-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Koshiba T.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12471-12479Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), suggesting that 5-Helix might bind to an intermediate state of fusion. Consistent with this interpretation, inhibition of the HR2 region is sensitive to gp41 mutations that disrupt trimer-of-hairpins formation and alter the kinetics of membrane fusion (16Abrahamyan L.G. Mkrtchyan S.R. Binley J. Lu M. Melikyan G.B. Cohen F.S. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Follis K.E. Larson S.J. Lu M. Nunberg J.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7356-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here, we take an alternate approach to investigate the temporal accessibility of the gp41 HR2 segment during membrane fusion. Using a series of 5-Helix variants with mutations within their C-peptide binding sites, we have probed the relationship between inhibitory potency, binding affinity, and association kinetics. We reasoned that the potency of an inhibitor capable of binding native Env should largely depend on its binding affinity. Contrary to this expectation, we find that binding affinity is a poor predictor of inhibitory potency. Rather, an inverse relationship is observed between IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) and the second-order association rate constant (kon). This precise dependence is predicted for an inhibitor that targets a transient state in the fusion process. Our results place temporal and spatial restrictions on the exposure of the C-terminal region of the gp41 ectodomain. Construction, Purification, and Characterization of 5-Helix Variants—Mutations of Ala and Asp were introduced alone or in combination into 5-Helix at residues Val549, Leu556, Gln563, and Val570 of the N40 segments (numbering according to the HXB2 Env sequence of the HR1 region). These residues fall in the e-position in a helical wheel diagram of the HR1 coiled coil (23Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and make primarily hydrophobic contacts with the HR2 segment. For the Single Ala, Single Asp, Double Ala, and Triple Ala variants, substitutions were made in all three N40 segments simultaneously. For reasons of protein stability, substitutions were incorporated into the third N40 segment only for the Double Asp and Ala+Asp variants (see supplemental material for more details on variant construction, purification, and characterization). All 5-Helix proteins were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and purified under denaturing conditions using metal chelate chromatography. Protein refolding took place on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) in 4 m guanidine hydrochloride by slow cooling from 90 °C to room temperature. Monomers were separated from aggregates by gel filtration (Sephacryl S200 HR (Amersham Biosciences)) in 10TBS (10 mm Tris/100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Protein was determined to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis. The concentrations of all 5-Helix variants were determined by absorbance at 280 nm in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (30Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). Molar ellipticity ([θ]222) and melting temperature (Tm) for each variant were determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy and are reported in Table 1.TABLE 1Structural, inhibitory and binding properties of 5-Helix and its variants Disruption of the C-peptide binding site on 5-Helix was achieved by incorporating the indicated substitutions into either all three N40 segments (3×) or only the third N40 segment (N3, see supplemental material for details). For each variant, the helical fold and stability was confirmed by measurements of molar ellipticities at 222 nm ([θ]222) and Tm using circular dichroism spectroscopy. The reported inhibitory potency (IC50) for each variant was determined in the cell-cell fusion assay employing HIV-1HXB2 Env effector cells and CD4- and CXCR4-expressing target cells. The solution-phase KD and kon were obtained using the Kinexa 3000 instrument by measuring the unbound C-peptide concentration in mixtures of R-C37 (EnvHXB2-derived) and 5-Helix variant. For the two Ala+Asp variants indicated with an asterisk, the IC50 and kon-1 values deviate from the linear correlation shown in Fig. 4C. Their koff values, calculated as kon·KD, are the largest among the entire set of 5-Helix variants and essentially determine the magnitude of ks in Equation 5 of the text. NA and ND signify “not applicable” and “not determined,” respectively. Preparation of Fluorescently Labeled C-peptide R-C37—The R-C37 peptides utilized in the study contain HR2 residues 625-661 from either HXB2 or JRFL Env (numbering according to the HXB2 sequence). They were generated from cysteinated C-peptide Cys-C37-H6 obtained by proteolysis of the recombinantly expressed trimer-of-hairpins construct CGG-NC1.1 (see Ref. 23Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar and supplemental material for details). The peptide was fluorescently labeled using rhodamine-5-maleimide (Molecular Probes) and purified to homogeneity by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (Waters Instruments). The identity of R-C37 was confirmed by SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Ciphergen), and its concentration was determined by absorbance at 520 nm in methanol using an extinction coefficient of 95,000 m-1 cm-1 (Molecular Probes). Inhibition Assays—All viral infectivity and cell-cell fusion experiments were performed as described previously (10Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15613-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) with slight modifications as detailed in the supplemental material. Interaction Measurements—The reported KD and kon values were determined for the interaction of rhodamine-labeled C37 (R-C37) and 5-Helix in solution. The binding parameters were measured by sampling the free (unbound) concentration of R-C37 as reaction mixtures were passed through the fluorescence flow cell of a Kinexa 3000 instrument (Sapidyne Instruments). Sampling was achieved using a small amount of 5-Helix-conjugated beads generated by incubating 5-Helix (100 μg) and activated azlactone beads (50 mg, Sapidyne Instruments) in 50 mm sodium carbonate (pH 9.5, 1 ml) at 4 °C overnight. Nonspecific binding sites on the beads were subsequently blocked using bovine serum albumin (10 mg) in 1 m Tris (pH 8.0, 1 ml) at 20 °C for 1 h. Before use, the bead mixture was diluted into 30 ml of 10TBS containing 0.02% NaN3. For each measurement, the Kinexa 3000 instrument automatically passed ∼0.5 ml of the diluted bead mixture through the flow cell capillary. Beads were retained on a 20-μm screen to create a small (<10 μl) bead pack within the optical path. When experimental solutions were passed over this bead pack, a fraction of free (unbound) R-C37 was retained within the flow cell and detected as an increase in fluorescence signal. To ensure that this measurement correctly reflected the free R-C37 concentrations in reaction mixtures, beads were tested for linear responses to both sample volume and R-C37 concentration. Interaction experiments were carried out at 25 °C in solutions of 10TBS containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02% NaN3, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. For equilibrium measurements, 5-Helix variants were titrated into fixed concentrations of R-C37 and incubated for 4-72 h (empirically determined to ensure that equilibrium had been achieved). Each sample was run through the Kinexa 3000 in duplicate, and the difference in fluorescence signal before the sample was run and after it was washed out (Δf) was fit to a general bimolecular equilibrium binding model,Δf=Δfmin+Δfmax-Δfmin2[C37]o[([C37]o-[5H]o-KD)+P](Eq. 1) whereP=([C37]o-[5H]o-KD)2+4[C37]oKD Δfmin and Δfmax were fluorescence differences from samples in which R-C37 was fully bound and fully unbound, respectively, and [C37]o and [5H]o refer to the total (bound + unbound) concentrations of R-C37 and 5-Helix variant. The KD values obtained using this method were within 30% of the values determined using either a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based competition assay for tight binding variants (KD < 200 pm) or a direct R-C37 fluorescence assay for weaker binding variants (data not shown). For association kinetics measurements, solutions of R-C37 (1 nm) and 5-Helix variant were mixed together in a Kinexa 3000 flow line for a short amount of time before passage through the flow cell. The degree of binding was varied by adjusting either the incubation time (2.9 to 7.2 s, depending on the flow rate) or 5-Helix variant concentration. To determine the value of kon, a full titration of 5-Helix variant concentration was performed (see Fig. 4, A and B). The fluorescence differences (Δf) from duplicate samples were fit to a general bimolecular kinetics model,Δf=Δfmin+Δfmax-Δfmin2[C37]o([C37]o-[5H]o-KD)+P1+He-konPt1-He-konPt(Eq. 3) whereH=[C37]o+[5H]o+KD-P[C37]o+[5H]o+KD+P The values P, Δfmin, Δfmax, [C37]o, and [5H]o have the same meaning as in Equation 1. Here, t is the incubation time, and KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant determined previously. For wild type 5-Helix and the Q563D variant, the kon values were confirmed using a fluorescence-based association assay (see supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, the wild type 5-Helix/R-C37 dissociation rate constant (koff) determined by fluorescence competition agrees (within 50%) with the product KD·kon, as expected for a biomolecular interaction (data not shown). Inhibitory Activity of 5-Helix and Its Variants—5-Helix consists of three 40-residue N-peptides and two 38-residue C-peptides alternately connected (N-C-N-C-N) by five-amino acid Gly/Ser linkers (23Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies confirm that the core of 5-Helix adopts the structure of the gp41 trimer-of-hairpins minus one HR2 helix (Fig. 2A). 3K. Champagne and M. J. Root, manuscript in preparation. The hydrophobic groove created by this vacancy interacts strongly with C-peptides and enables 5-Helix to inhibit Env-mediated membrane fusion at low nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 1B). The reported IC50 values are independent of viral concentrations for infectivity studies or effector cell concentrations in cell-cell fusion assays (see supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, 5-Helix inhibitory potency reflects an intrinsic property of the Env interacting with target cells and is not limited by mass action due to the amount of Env on viral or cellular membranes. Preincubating virus at high 5-Helix concentrations prior to diluting for infection does not enhance 5-Helix inhibitory activity (Fig. 1C). Thus, if 5-Helix interacts with Env prior to receptor engagement, there is sufficient time for the protein to re-equilibrate with its binding site during infection. If 5-Helix can equilibrate with native Env, then inhibitory potency should correlate with intrinsic binding affinity. Conversely, if inhibition occurs through an intermediate state with a lifetime insufficient to reach equilibrium, then potency will be influenced by association kinetics. To distinguish between these possibilities, we have constructed a series of 5-Helix variants with mutations in one or more of four residues that form predominantly hydrophobic contacts with the HR2 segment (Fig. 2A). When all four are mutated to Asp, the resulting protein, 5-Helix·N3-D4, displays no inhibitory activity despite being stably folded in the appropriate structure (Figs. 1B and 2A). Here, we have mutated the residues individually or in combination to Ala or Asp. The IC50 values of the 5-Helix variants range from 5.4 nm (0.85 x IC50,wild type) to 970 nm (150 x IC50,wild type) in a cell-based fusion assay (Fig. 2B, Table 1). In general, variants with Asp substitutions tend to have lower potencies than variants with only Ala substitutions, consistent with the hydrophobic nature of the interaction between 5-Helix and the HR2 segment. Variants with one Ala substitution (Single Ala) have IC50 values indistinguishable from that of wild type 5-Helix. Remarkably, variants with even three Ala substitutions (Triple Ala) are still effective inhibitors, with IC50 values within a factor of six of the wild type 5-Helix IC50. Relationship of Binding Affinity to Inhibitory Potency—Solution-phase binding affinities were determined using a Kinexa 3000 instrument. Equilibrated mixtures of 5-Helix and a rhodamine-labeled C-peptide (R-C37) were passed through a fluorescence flow cell containing a small amount of 5-Helix-conjugated beads. A portion of the free (unbound) R-C37 was specifically retained in the bead pack, resulting in an increase in fluorescence signal directly proportional to the free concentration of R-C37 in solution. In the experiments depicted in Fig. 3A, a solution of 30 pm R-C37 generates a fluorescence signal that increases linearly with the amount of solution passed through the flow cell. Addition of 19 pm 5-Helix to this solution reduces the fluorescence signal by 60%, indicating that only 40% of R-C37 remains unbound in solution. From full titrations of 5-Helix at several R-C37 concentrations, we have determined the KD to be 0.65 pm for the wild type protein (Fig. 3B). The binding affinities of the mutant variants span more than 5 orders of magnitude. While weakly inhibiting variants tend to have relatively low binding affinities, the IC50 and KD values show little correlation in general (Table 1). For instance, the KD values for the four Single Ala variants range from 0.79 to 63 pm, but this 80-fold variance is not reflected in their IC50 values (Figs. 2B and 3C). Likewise, binding is disrupted more than 4 orders of magnitude in the Triple Ala variants, yet their IC50 values are less than 6-fold higher than the wild type IC50. However, an Ala-Asp variant (V549D/L556A) that binds with similar affinity as the Triple Ala variants inhibits with 150-fold lower potency than wild type 5-Helix. The lack of overall correlation between IC50 and KD values is inconsistent with an equilibrium thermodynamic interpretation of inhibition (Fig. 3D). Influence of Association Kinetics on 5-Helix Inhibition— Based on our results, we postulate that the inhibitory target of 5-Helix is exposed during a short-lived intermediate state. The simplest model that depicts this inhibition mechanism is summarized by Scheme 1. Here, N, I, and F symbolize the native, intermediate, and the fusogenic conformations of gp41, respectively. The rate constants kon and koff describe the kinetics of 5-Helix (5H) binding to I, where the ratio koff/kon = KD. The constants kf and ks refer respectively to the unidirectional rates out of I and out of I-5H (the inhibited intermediate state). The irreversible transition from I-5H to a hypothetical dead end state (D) is required to prevent the entire reaction from sinking into F, even in the presence of 5-Helix. The results of this study do not describe the nature of this dead end conformation. Using this scheme, we can understand the 104-fold discrepancy between IC50 and KD for wild type 5-Helix. Productive inhibition by 5-Helix requires that its binding rate (kon[5H] + koff) be on the order of or greater than kf. Although 5-Helix at low picomolar concentrations is capable of binding more than 50% of Env, the reaction takes several hours to reach equilibrium (even if association occurs at the diffusion limit). Since the intermediate state of gp41 exists for much shorter durations (17Munoz-Barroso I. Durell S. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Blumenthal R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 28Dimitrov A.S. Louis J.M. Bewley C.A. Clore G.M. Blumenthal R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12471-12479Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), 5-Helix cannot significantly bind and fusion proceeds unabated. When the concentration is raised into the nanomolar range, 5-Helix binds Env with much faster kinetics, and inhibition is observed. The kinetic restriction to inhibition predicts that more slowly associating 5-Helix variants will require higher concentrations in order to inhibit. Thus, we expect IC50 values to vary inversely with kon. To test this prediction, we have measured the solution-phase association of 5-Helix and R-C37 by continuous flow method using the Kinexa 3000 (Fig. 4A). The association rate constant for wild type 5-Helix is 2.6 × 107 m-1 s-1, very close to the diffusion-limited association rate constant for bimolecular interactions (Fig. 4B). The relatively potent variants that contain only Ala substitutions have association rate constants within a factor of five of the wild type value (Table 1, Fig. 4C). By contrast, the association rate constants of the least potent inhibitors (Ala-Asp and Double Asp variants) are up to 150-fold lower than the wild type value. In general, an inverse"

PCNA, an auxiliary factor for DNA replication, facilitates DNA methylation by loading DNMT1 onto itself (2Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The inheritance of the methylation pattern is crucial for determining gene expression because the majority of CpG dinucleotides in the mammalian genome are methylated and methylation often dictates the transcriptional status of a gene. It has been demonstrated that DNA methylation is correlated with transcriptional inactivation of a gene and the reverse is true for gene activation, although recently it was reported that histone modification greatly influences the transcriptional status of a gene (3Fuks F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Additionally, there are two more DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases in the mammalian genome known as de novo methyltransferases, DNMT3a and DNMT3b (4Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E.

Although DNMTs enforce gene silencing directly by DNA methylation, they also act as a platform for recruitment of transcriptional repressor complexes for gene silencing through their N-terminal regions (7Pradhan S.

Thus, specific gene expression patterns in mammalian cells are coordinated and conducted by a host of genetic and epigenetic factors. Interaction of these factors on a promoter or in its vicinity often leads to gene silencing or regulation. For example, Myc binds the corepressor DNMT3a and can target DNMT3a selectively to the promoter of p21Cip1 (16Brenner C. Deplus R. Didelot C. Loriot A. Vire E. De Smet C. Gutierrez A. Danovi D.

A key protein in gene regulation during cellular stress is tumor suppressor p53. Intracellular stabilization and accumulation of p53 takes place when cells are stressed or their DNA is damaged (18Ma L. Wagner J. Rice J.J. Hu W. Levine A.J. Stolovitzky G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Tumor suppressor p53 protects mammals from neoplasia by selectively eliminating stressed cells or cells with damaged DNA via programmed cell death. The p53-dependent growth arrest in response to damaged DNA occurs during both the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle (19Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar, 20Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar). Furthermore p53 can also arrest cell division if the nucleotide pool in the cell becomes a limiting factor. The p53 protein has a central DNA binding domain flanked by transactivation and negative regulation domains. Binding of p53 to the promoter results in transcriptional activation of several genes that control cellular responses to stress (21Hoh J. Jin S. Parrado T. Edington J. Levine A.J. Ott J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8467-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). For example, p53 causes G1 arrest in cells by stimulating cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21/Waf1, thus reducing the activity of CDK2, -4, and -6 that are required for progression from G1 to S phase (22Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 23Enoch T. Norbury C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 426-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p53 was shown to bind to the promoter of cell survival proteins such as survivin and down-regulate its expression by recruitment of epigenetic machinery such as DNMT1 and HDAC1 (24Esteve P.O. Chin H.G. Pradhan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These events link both histone and DNA methylation to gene silencing. Mammalian cell division is controlled by a number of regulatory factors, which including mitotic cyclins A, B1, and B2, mitotic kinase Cdc2 and mitotic phosphatase Cdc25C (25Nilsson I. Hoffmann I. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of Cdc2 is required at G2 phase of the cell cycle, and its biological activity is dependent on phosphatase activity on specific tyrosine (Tyr15) and the threonine (Thr14) residues by Cdc25C (26Winters Z.E. Hunt N.C. Bradburn M.J. Royds J.A. Turley H. Harris A.L. Norbury C.J. Eur. J. Cancer. 2001; 37: 2405-2412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Cdc25C by Chk kinase creates a binding site for 14-3-3 protein that can anchor Cdc25C in the cytoplasm, thus preventing Cdc2 activation. The dual specificity phosphatase Cdc25C mediates cell cycle progression into mitosis and also serves as a checkpoint at G2 (27Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). Upon DNA damage, repression of the Cdc2 and Cdc25C is mediated by p53 interaction on the promoter element of these genes. However, the precise mechanism of p53-mediated repression is not known. In this report, we have investigated the possible role of epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone methylation in the repression of Cdc2 and Cdc25C gene expression upon DNA damage. A direct recruitment of various enzymatic units for DNA and histone modification on to the target promoters by stabilized p53 is investigated here. Cell Culture—Parental HCT116 (colorectal carcinoma) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. DNMT1–/– and both DNMT1–/–/DNMT3b–/– HCT116 cells were kindly provided by Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). All cells were incubated at 37 °C in a5%CO2 humidified atmosphere and propagated in Mac Coy's 5A modified medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. 100 μg/ml hygromycin were added to the DNMT1–/– cells. Drug Treatments—For zebularine treatment, cells were plated (5 × 105 cells/100-mm diameter dish) and treated with 1.5 10–4m of zebularine (Calbiochem) 24 h post-plating. The medium was changed every 3 days, along with fresh zebularine treatment, for up to 8 days. For doxorubicin treatment, subconfluent cells were treated with 1 μm doxorubicin (Sigma) for 0, 2, 4, 24, and 48 h. For mitotic index determination, HCT116 and DNMT1-null cells were grown on coverslips. The cells were treated with doxorubicin and were fixed with paraformaldehyde 24and 48-h post-treatment. The cells were permeabilized with 1× PBS supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated with Hoechst 33342. Mitotic cells were scored under UV using a Zeiss inverted microscope. Western Blot Analysis—Subconfluent cultures of HCT116 cells were washed with 1× PBS, and lysed at 4 °C for 20 min with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent based on the Bradford colorimetric method. 25–75 μg of proteins were electrophoresed on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Daiichi) after boiling for 5 min in a SDS sample buffer supplemented with 100 mm dithiothreitol (New England Biolabs (NEB)). The proteins were transferred onto Protran® pure nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μ) (Schleicher and Schuell). After overnight electroblotting at 4 °C, the membranes were incubated with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20, 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) and rabbit polyclonal antibody against DNMT1 (NEB), DNMT3a, DNMT3b (NEB), p53, Cdc2, Cdc25C, Chk1, Chk2, Chk1 phos (Ser296), Chk2 phos (Thr68), rabbit monoclonal for Cdc25C phos (Ser216), mouse monoclonal for survivin (Cell Signaling Technology (CST)), and rabbit polyclonal antibody against actin (Sigma). Goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, were used in a chemiluminescence detection system as directed by the manufacturer (CST). For zebularine experiments, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were separated and prepared using the NE-PER® Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Total RNA Extraction and Quantification—Total RNA was isolated from subconfluent cells (cultured in 6-well plates) using RNAqueous® columns (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's recommendations for mammalian cultured cells. Briefly, the RNA of lysed cells was absorbed to a silica matrix, washed, and eluted with 50 μl (40 + 10) of 70 °C preheated Rnase-free elution solution. Residual DNA contamination was eliminated using the DNA-free™ kit (Ambion). RNA concentrations and purities were determined by diluting 20 μl of each RNA preparation in 480 μl of Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0 (1:25 dilution) and measuring the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. cDNA Synthesis—One microgram of purified total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Protoscript™ First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (NEB) and oligo(dT23) primer. cDNAs were diluted to 50 μl (1–2.5) prior use in quantitative PCR experiments. Quantitative PCR Experiments—The cDNAs of interest and reference cDNA (G6PDH) were amplified from a separate mix. All reactions were prepared in a 25-μl final volume with indicated end-concentrations: 0.8 μm of forward and reverse primer, 1× iQ™ SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and 4% cDNAs (2 of 50 μl). For each mix a No Template Control (NTC) was performed with 1 μg of total RNA in place of cDNAs. G6PDH primers were previously published (28Radonic, A., Thulke, S., Mackay, I. M., Landt, O., Siegert, W., and Nitsche, A.(2004) 313, 856–862Google Scholar). All the other primer sets (Table 1) were designed using the Primer3 program. These primers were selected to produce PCR fragments between 100 and 200 base pairs in length and in a narrow range of various primer annealing temperatures. All targets were thus amplified using a common PCR program as follows: a denaturation step at 95 °C for 2 min and 40 cycles with a 59 °C annealing temperature (95 °C for 20 s, 59 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 20 s). All reactions were carried out using the i-Cycler instrument from Bio-Rad and double-strand DNA SYBR green incorporation that was measured during each elongation step.TABLE 1Primer setsGenBank™ accession no.Primer sequences (5′-3′)Real-time PCR efficiency (E)Forward primerReverse primerG6PDHX03674atcgaccactacctgggcaattctgcatcacgtcccggaE = 1.98, R2 = 0.997SurvivinNM_001168gttgcgctttcctttctgtcgcactttcttcgcagtttccE = 2.01, R2 = 0.999Cdc2BT007004tggggtcagctcgttactcacacttctggccacacttcatttaE = 2.16, R2 = 0.984Cdc25CNM_001790gaacaggccaagactgaagcgcccctggttagaatcttccE = 1.97, R2 = 0.998DNMT1X63692ggctgagatgaggcaaaaagaccaactcggtacaggatgcE = 2.00, R2 = 0.996DNMT3aAF067972ccggaacattgaggacatctcagcagatggtgcagtaggaE = 2.04, R2 = 0.998DNMT3bAF156487cccattcgagtcctgtcatttgatattcccctcgtgcttcE = 2.32, R2 = 0.993 Open table in a new tab Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Relative expression ratios were calculated using the mathematical model described by M. W. Pfaffl (29Pfaff M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24586) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR efficiency (E) of each of the target and reference gene (G6PDH) transcript was investigated from 40-ng to 64-pg cDNA dilutions (Table 1). Each cDNA sample was examined in triplicate. pcdc2-luc and pcdc25C-luc Plasmid Constructions—The Cdc2–945/+69 bp (GenBank™ AF512554) and Cdc25C–339/+647 bp (GenBank™ AY497474) promoter regions were amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of parental HCT116 cells, using the following primers: Cdc2 promoter forward primer, 5′-GCG GCG GGG TAC CCC CTG CAG TAA GTG CAG AAA TCT CT-3′; Cdc2 promoter reverse primer, 5′-CGC CGG AGG ATC TTC GCA GCG GCA GCT ACA ACA AC-3′; Cdc25C promoter forward primer, 5′-GCG GCG GGG TAC CCC TAG TAA GGC GCG GTT TA-3′; Cdc25C reverse primer, 5′-CGC CGG AAG ATC TTC GGT CTT CGA ATT CTC-3′. PCR fragments were cloned into KpnI and BglII restriction sites of the Promega promoterless luciferase vector pGL3-Basic. Underlined bases in the primer sequences indicate nucleotides added to permit efficient restrictions of the PCR products by the KpnI (forward primers) and BglII (reverse primers) enzymes. Luciferase Activity Assays—The pGL3 reporter plasmids were transiently transfected into wild-type and mutant HCT116 cells (cultured in 6-well plates) using the FuGENE method according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Applied Science) and using a 4.5:1.2 transfection reagent (μl)/DNA ratio (μg). Transfected DNA included 1.0 μg of the pcdc2-luc or pcdc25C-luc plasmid construction and 200 ng of a pSV-β-galactosidase vector (Promega). This second reporter vector was used to check the transfection efficiencies and normalize luciferase activity values. Twelve hours after transfection, culture medium was changed. Then, cells were washed three times in 1× PBS and lysed in 200 μl of the Promega Passive Lysis Buffer® with gentle shaking at room temperature for 20 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 13,800 × g for 2 min to pellet the cell debris. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined, from 100 and 25 μl of the supernatants respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocols (Promega). For p53 expression pcDNAP53 construct was used. This construct contains the wild-type p53 sequence under the CMV promoter. Promoters Methylation Analysis—Genomic DNA from doxorucibin-treated or untreated cells was extracted using the Easy-DNA™ kit (Invitrogen), diluted in Tris-EDTA and exactly quantified using the PicoGreen® dsDNA Quantification kit (Molecular Probes) in a reduce 200-μl volume assay. Then, 1 μg of each DNA sample was subjected to the restriction enzyme HhaI or BstUI digestion (NEB). Gene-specific primers flanking p53-binding site of Cdc25C and Cdc2 promoter amplified the digested DNAs. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—HCT116 cells were grown on 150-mm dishes and treated with 1 μm of doxorubicin. After 24 h, proteins were cross-linked with DNA using 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed two times with ice-cold 1× PBS, harvested, and lysed with an SDS lysis buffer (UB) in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). The lysates were sonicated to shear DNA to lengths between 200 and 1000 bp. After 10-fold dilution of the sonicated cell supernatants in ChIP dilution buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, UB) containing protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitations were carried out overnight at 4 °C with mixing by using 2 μg of DNMT1 (NEB), p53 (CST), HDAC1 (CST), H3K9me2 polyclonal (UB), G9a (UB), Sp1 (UB), and control purified rabbit IgG antibodies (Calbiochem) to the extract. 40 μl of protein G-agarose beads pre-adsorbed with salmon sperm DNA were added and incubated for an hour at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were isolated and washed according to UB's manual. DNA-protein complexes were eluted from the beads with a buffer containing 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3. The cross-links were reversed by incubating the eluates with NaCl (5 m) for 6 h at 65°C. Proteinase K (NEB) was added for 1 h at 45°C, and the DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. ChIP DNA was analyzed for the presence of Cdc2 gene promoter sequence by PCR with proximal (forward: 5′-AACTGTGCCAATGCTGGGAG-3′ and reverse: 5′-AGCCAGCTTTGAAGCCAAGT-3′) and distal (forward: 5′-TCCCATTAGGATCAATGCAA-3′ and reverse: 5′-TTTCTGTTTGTTTGCGGAGA-3′) primer sets using PCR of 30 cycles at 94 °C 30 s, 60 °C 30 s, and 72 °C 30 s. Similarly for Cdc25C promoter ChIP analysis PCR was performed with proximal (forward: 5′-GGCTGACACCTTTGTTGTGA-3′ and reverse: 5′-AGGGAGTGTGGGATGAGTTG-3′) and distal (forward: 5′-AGGGTGTGGAGATTGGTGAG-3′ and reverse: 5′-GCGTTGACCATTCAAACCTT-3′) primer sets. Repression of Cdc2 and Cdc25C Promoters Is Mediated by p53 and DNMT1—Endogenous Cdc2 and Cdc25C promoters contain DNA sequences for p53-binding. In the Cdc2 promoter, CCAAT boxes are responsible for p53-mediated repression of the promoter (30Imbriano C. Gurtner A. Cocchiarella F. Di Agostino S. Basile V. Gostissa M. Dobbelstein M. Del Sal G. Piaggio G. Mantovani R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 3737-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Whereas in the human Cdc25C promoter a p53-binding site that physically recruits p53 has been identified (31St Clair S. Giono L. Varmeh-Ziaie S. Resnick-Silverman L. Liu W.J. Padi A. Dastidar J. DaCosta A. Mattia M. Manfredi J.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 725-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrated p53 stabilization after treatment of HCT116 cells with DNA-damaging agent, doxorubicin, resulting in down-regulation of endogenous Cdc25C expression (24Esteve P.O. Chin H.G. Pradhan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A similar down-regulation of endogenous Cdc2 was reported elsewhere (30Imbriano C. Gurtner A. Cocchiarella F. Di Agostino S. Basile V. Gostissa M. Dobbelstein M. Del Sal G. Piaggio G. Mantovani R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 3737-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To reconcile these findings and understand the mechanism of gene repression, reporters were constructed with the promoter of either Cdc2 (pcdc2-luc) or Cdc25C (pcdc25C-luc) preceding the luciferase gene. These reporter constructs were used in transfection assays. These constructs contain essentially all of the features of the respective endogenous promoter including Sp1, NF-Y, CDE, and CHR binding sites (Fig. 1A). To investigate whether p53 can repress these promoters, the constructs were cotransfected with an increasing amount of p53 expression construct pcDNAP53 into HCT116 p53-null cells. In the control experiment, backbone pcDNA vector was used instead of pcDNAP53. Both Cdc2 and Cdc25C promoter-mediated luciferase expression were down-regulated in the transfected cells in a dose-dependent manner by pcDNAP53 (Fig. 1, B and C). To determine if DNMTs participate in this down-regulation event, either pcdc2-luc or pcdc25C-luc were transfected into HCT116 cells WT or into DNMT1-null or DNMT1 and DNMT3b-null background. After the transfection, endogenous p53 was induced via doxorubicin treatment. In the WT cells, luciferase expression was down-regulated. Both Cdc2 and Cdc25C promoters were repressed (∼75%) in the presence of p53. However, in DNMT1-null cells or DNMT1 and DNMT3b-null cells luciferase expression was not down-regulated (Fig. 1, D and E), suggesting a direct involvement of both DNMT1 and p53 in Cdc2 and Cdc25C promoter regulation as observed before for the survivin promoter (24Esteve P.O. Chin H.G. Pradhan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A similar derepression of luciferase reporter was observed in p53-null cells (Fig. 1, D and E). This suggests a plausible general mechanism of gene regulation of promoters containing a p53-binding site that are repressed in the presence of p53. DNA Damage-induced Down-regulation of Endogenous Cdc25C and Cdc2 Requires Both Tumor Suppressor p53 and DNA (Cytosine-5) Methyltransferase 1—To evaluate the impact of p53-mediated repression of the endogenous Cdc2 and Cdc25C promoter, wild-type HCT116 cells were treated with doxorubicin and the level of tumor suppressor p53, DNMT1, Cdc2, and Cdc25C were measured at different time intervals (0-, 24-, and 48-h post-treatment) via Western blot analysis. A time-dependent accumulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 was observed in 24and 48-h post-treatment (Fig. 2A). Correlated with the accumulation of p53 the level of Cdc2 and Cdc25C decreased in the wild-type HCT116 extracts (Fig. 2A). At 48-h post-treatment there was a ∼90% reduction in Cdc2 and Cdc25C protein levels (Fig. 2A, right panels). As a positive control, survivin, another p53-repressed gene, was monitored and was down-regulated under identical conditions. The loading control, actin or PCNA (data not shown) level remained the same in all the different time points indicating consistent loading of extract in each lane. An identical experiment performed side by side with the HCT116 p53-null cells, HCT116 DNMT1-null cells or HCT116 DNMT1 and DNMT3b-null cells resulted in either no changes or a gradual increase with the level of Cdc2 or Cdc25C after doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 2, B–D). The positive control survivin level increased in all the null cell lines validating previously reported up-regulation of survivin (24Esteve P.O. Chin H.G. Pradhan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The actin level remained the same throughout. A lower time point, between 0 and 24 h, also demonstrated the same effect for survivin, Cdc2, Cdc25C in wild-type HCT116, HCT116 p53-null, and HCT116 DNMT1-null cell lines (data not shown). This argues in favor of the notion that down-regulation of endogenous Cdc2, Cdc25C and survivin is a direct cooperative effect of p53 and DNMT1, and both proteins are needed to be physically present in the cell. The down-regulation was also observed at the RNA level as determined by real time PCR experiments (data not shown). Zebularine-mediated DNMT1 Entrapment Can Disrupt p53-mediated Repression of Cdc2 and Cdc25C—To determine if the derepression of endogenous Cdc2 and Cdc25C promoters is mediated by DNA damage in p53-null cells, DNMT1-null cells or in DNMT1 and DNMT3b-null cells are direct consequence of DNMT1 involvement, we treated the HCT116 cells with zebularine, a mechanistic inhibitor of DNMTs. Zebularine is a nucleotide analogue that can get incorporated to DNA during DNA synthesis and give rise to high affinity complexes with DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase (33Zhou L. Cheng X. Connolly B.A. Dickman M.J. Hurd P.J. Hornby D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The incorporation of zebularine into DNA is believed to facilitate DNMT1 entrapment leading to depletion of the enzyme level in the cell, resulting in the demethylation of the genome (34Cheng J.C. Yoo C.B. Weisenberger D.J. Chuang J. Wozniak C. Liang G. Marquez V.E. Greer S. Orntoft T.F. Thykjaer T. Jones P.A.

Initially, to validate the specificity of zebularine, wild-type HCT116 cells were treated with a fixed amount of zebularine and the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of the cells were separated, Western-blotted and probed with antibodies specific for human DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b (Fig. 3A). In the cytoplasmic fraction either the presence or absence of zebularine did not impact on the quantity of DNMT3a and DNMT3b, because the density of the signal remained consistent between t"

We have shown previously that the main structural differences in a nucleosome in which both H2A moieties have been replaced by macro-H2A reside in the only point of contact between the two histone dimers, the L1-L1 interface of macro-H2A. Here we show that the L1 loop of macro-H2A is responsible for the increased salt-dependent stability of the histone octamer, with implications for the nucleosome assembly pathway. It is unknown whether only one or both of the H2A-H2B dimers within a nucleosome are replaced with H2A variant containing nucleosomes in vivo. We demonstrate that macro-H2A preferentially forms hybrid nucleosomes containing one chain each of major H2A and macro-HA in vitro. The 2.9-Å crystal structure of such a hybrid nucleosome shows significant structural differences in the L1-L1 interface when comparing with homotypic major H2A- and macro-H2A-containing nucleosomes. Both homotypic and hybrid macro-nucleosome core particles (NCPs) are resistant to chaperone-assisted H2A-H2B dimer exchange. Together, our findings suggest that the histone domain of macro-H2A modifies the dynamic properties of the nucleosome.

Histones are responsible for the packaging of eukaryotic DNA into a nucleoprotein complex termed chromatin, the fundamental unit of which is the nucleosome core particle (NCP). 2The abbreviations used are: NCP, nucleosome core particle; NAP-1, nucleosome assembly protein 1; yNAP-1, yeast NAP-1. The NCP consists of an octamer of two copies each of four core histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, that organizes 147 base pairs of DNA in a tight superhelix (1Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (6912) Google Scholar). The structure and function of chromatin and ultimately the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA is regulated either through covalent post-translational modification of histones, through interactions with non-histone proteins (for example, architectural proteins), and through the incorporation of non-allelic variants of histones. Histone variants exhibit sequence differences in strategic regions of the histone fold, resulting in functional differences in the variant nucleosome and in chromatin higher order structure (2Suto R.K.

Major functional changes are caused by relatively subtle manipulation of very specific regions within the structured parts of the histones, resulting in subtly altered protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions and/or in changes in the molecular surface of the nucleosome. The L1 loops of both H2A moieties in the nucleosome form the L1-L1 interface, the only region where the two H2A-H2B dimers interact (1Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (6912) Google Scholar). This region has diverged significantly during evolution of species and is also highly variable within histone H2A variants (10Chakravarthy S. Bao Y. Roberts V.A. Tremethick D. Luger K. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2004; 69: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the two available variant nucleosome structures (in which H2A is replaced by H2A.Z or macro-H2A, respectively), this is the only site where sequence differences lead to a significant difference in structure (2Suto R.K.

Here we demonstrate that four amino acids in the L1 loop of macro-H2A stabilize the histone octamer in the absence of DNA and are thus solely responsible for altering the in vitro salt-dependent nucleosome assembly pathway. Macro-H2A is implicated in the formation of transcriptionally silent heterochromatin (15Pehrson J.R. Fried V.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1398-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 16Costanzi C.

In addition to a histone H2A-like domain, it also has a C-terminal domain that has been shown to bind NAD metabolites (18Karras G.I. Kustatscher G. Buhecha H.R. Allen M.D. Pugieux C. Sait F. Bycroft M. Ladurner A.G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1911-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and an H1-like linker region. Although several studies have addressed the in vivo localization patterns of macro-H2A (16Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 19Pehrson J.R. Costanzi C. Dharia C. Cell Biochem. 1997; 65: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Chadwick B.P.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), many aspects of targeting and replication-independent deposition of macro-H2A remain to be understood. For example, it is not known whether one or both of the H2A moieties within a single nucleosome are replaced by macro-H2A. We have devised an in vitro assay to test whether hybrid nucleosomes (nucleosomes containing one macro-H2A-H2B and one H2A-H2B dimer) are indeed formed and find that macro-H2A preferentially forms hybrid nucleosomes after salt-dependent reconstitution onto defined-sequence DNA. To better understand the adaptability of the L1 loop in particular in forming this interface, we determined the 2.9-Å crystal structure of such a hybrid nucleosome. Macro-H2A is found predominantly in transcriptionally inactive heterochromatic regions of the genome, such as the inactive X chromosome in female mammals (16Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors and histone chaperones play important roles in promoting chromatin fluidity. It was found previously that macro-H2A-containing nucleosomes were refractory to remodeling by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors in vitro (13Angelov D. Molla A. Perche P.Y. Hans F. Cote J. Khochbin S. Bouvet P. Dimitrov S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1033-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Here, we show that chaperone-assisted H2A-H2B dimer exchange is greatly inhibited in homotypic and hybrid macro-NCP. Together, our results demonstrate how relatively minor sequence and structural deviations in a variant histone result in altered nucleosome dynamics, with implications for gene regulation. Expression and Purification of Histone Proteins; Reconstitution of Nucleosomes—The expression vector for the histone domain of macro-H2A was a kind gift from Dr. Saadi Khochbin. The coding region was subcloned into a pet3a vector. Expression plasmids for H2B and H2A from mouse (Mus musculus) were a kind gift from Dr. David Tremethick. The coding region for mouse H2A was subcloned into a pet15b vector, which adds a His6-tag at the N terminus of the protein. We also used previously described expression plasmids for histones H2B, H3, and H4 from Xenopus laevis (22Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Flaus A.J. Waye M.M. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). All histones were overexpressed in BL21(DE3)-plysS (Stratagene) and purified using previously published protocols (23Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The histone domain of macro-H2A (macro-H2AHD) and X. laevis H2B was refolded into a dimer, as was His-tagged mouse H2A with mouse H2B. H3 and H4 were refolded into tetramers using published protocols (24Dyer P.N. Edayathumangalam R.S. White C.L. Bao Y. Chakravarthy S. Muthurajan U.M. Luger K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 23-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Macro-H2A-H2B dimer, His-tagged H2A-H2B dimer, (H3-H4)2 tetramer, and a 146-bp palindromic fragment of DNA derived from human α-satellite regions (α-sat DNA) (1Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (6912) Google Scholar) were mixed in a 1:1:1:1 molar ratio for nucleosome reconstitution by salt gradient dialysis. NCPs reconstituted with only macro-H2A-H2B dimers or only His-tagged H2A-H2B dimers (tetramer:dimer:DNA = 1:2:1) were prepared as controls. Nucleosomes were analyzed on a 5% non-denaturing PAGE gel. Yeast Nucleosome Assembly Protein 1 (yNAP-1)-dependent NCP Reconstitution—Glutathione S-transferase-tagged yNAP-1 was purified as described (25McBryant S.J. Park Y.J. Abernathy S.M. Laybourn P.J.

Macro- or Xla-octamer, or (H3-H4)2 tetramer and H2A-H2B (or macro-H2A-H2B) dimer that had been stored in refolding buffer (2 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), was dialyzed against 100 mm NaCl TE buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). The components were mixed withα-sat DNA in the presence of equimolar quantities of yNAP-1 (considering that the functional unit of yNAP-1 is a homodimer (25McBryant S.J. Park Y.J. Abernathy S.M. Laybourn P.J. Nyborg J.K. Luger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44574-44583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)). The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 3 h, followed by a 1-h incubation at 37 °C. NCPs were analyzed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For crystallography, NCPs were purified by preparative gel electrophoresis (23Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Domain Swapping—We performed site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to change the L1 loop of X. laevis major H2A to that of macro-H2A (amino acids 38-41 changed from NYAE to HPKY, resulting in the mutant mL1-H2A). Similarly, we mutated amino acids 83 (Leu to Ile), 84 (Gln to Leu), and 88 (Arg to Ala) in major H2A, to simulate major changes in the docking domain, resulting in mDD-H2A. Mutants were expressed, purified, and reconstituted into nucleosomes along with the other core histones from X. laevis as described above, resulting in mL1-NCPs and mDD-NCP, respectively. Analytical Gel Filtration—The relative stability of non-variant and variant histone octamers in varying salt concentrations was studied using a Superdex-200 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) size-exclusion column. Sample (Xla-octamer, macrooctamer, or mL1-octamer) was injected onto a calibrated column at strategic points in a decreasing salt gradient (2 m NaCl to 0.5 m NaCl) in a modification of a procedure described earlier (26Endo S. Saito Y. Wada A. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 108-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The injection points were 2, 1.7, 1.4, 1.1, 0.8, and 0.5 m. Analysis of Histone Content—We used nickel-affinity chromatography to isolate nucleosomes containing His-tagged H2A. 100 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Sigma) were thoroughly washed in binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm imidazole). Nucleosomes set up with a variety of combinations of H2A-H2B dimers as indicated were loaded on to the beads and rocked for 2 h at 4°C. The flowthrough was collected followed by three washes with binding buffer. The beads were then rocked for 15 min in elution buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 m imidazole). Fractions along with the onput were analyzed for their histone content on an 18% SDS-PAGE gel. Crystallographic Procedures—Hybrid macro-NCP (prepared and characterized as described above) was crystallized using salting in vapor diffusion at NCP concentrations between 8-12 mg/ml with salt concentrations of 34-37.5 mm KCl and 40-45 mm MnCl2. The crystals were soaked in 24% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and 5% trehalose and frozen in liquid nitrogen as described previously (1Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (6912) Google Scholar). Data were collected at Advanced Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) on beamline 5.0.2. Data from a single crystal were processed using Denzo and Scalepack (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzyomol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38565) Google Scholar). Protein Data Bank entry 1U35 was used as the search model in molecular replacement. Molecular replacement and subsequent rounds of refinement were performed using CNS (28Rice L.M. Shamoo Y. Brunger A.T. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1998; 31: 798-805Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The program O was used for model building (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar). The entire model was checked using simulated anneal omit maps for critical regions during various stages of refinement and a composite omit map at the end. Crystallographic Coordinates and Structure Factors—The crystallographic coordinates and structure factors for the hybrid macro-NCP have been deposited under the ID number 2F8N. yNAP-1-assisted H2A-H2B Dimer Exchange Assays—H2A-H2B dimers were labeled with Alexa-488 on H2B C112 (30Park Y.J. Dyer P.N. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24274-24282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Labeled H2A-H2B dimers were incubated with varying amounts of yNAP-1 at 4 °C for 2 h. Labeled yNAP-1-histone complex thus obtained was incubated with unlabeled H2A-NCP, macro-NCP, or hybrid macro-NCP overnight at 4 °C. Incorporation of fluorescently labeled H2A-H2B dimer into unlabeled nucleosomes was monitored on a non-denaturing 5% PAGE gel at 302 nm. Macro-NCP and Major NCP Behave Differently during Salt-dependent Reconstitution Due to Differences in Histone Octamer Stability—We have previously shown that NCP preparations reconstituted from major-type histones and a 146-base pair DNA fragment are heterogeneous with respect to the position of the histone octamer on the DNA (Ref. 31Muthurajan U.M. Park Y.J. Edayathumangalam R.S. Suto R.K. Chakravarthy S. Dyer P.N. Luger K. Biopolymers. 2003; 68: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar and references therein). These positional isoforms are distinguished by their different electrophoretic mobility and can usually be converted to a thermodynamically favorable position by incubation at 37 °C for 20-60 min (“heat shifting,” Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). Macro-NCP also reconstitutes as two different species, but the heat-induced redistribution is reproducibly incomplete. A significant fraction of macro-NCP remains in the upper band after heating at 37 °C (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4) and even higher temperatures (55 °C; data not shown). The histone composition of the bands was compared by SDS-PAGE. This analysis demonstrates that shifted macro-NCP contains a full complement of histones in stoichiometric amounts (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 5 and 6). However, the slower migrating species appears to be partially depleted for macro-H2AHD and -H2B (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 3 and 4). We therefore hypothesize that the slower migrating band of macro-NCP obtained after salt gradient reconstitution consists of two species, one that can be fully shifted and thus represents nucleosomes with different translational positioning and one that cannot be converted to the thermodynamically more stable form by heating, due to a noncanonical histone composition. We next investigated whether this is specific to assembly of macro-NCP by salt gradient dialysis. This method relies on the dissociation of the histone octamer (which is stable at 2 m NaCl in the absence of DNA but not under physiological conditions) into a (H3-H4)2 tetramer and two H2A-H2B dimers at relatively high ionic strength, followed by the sequential deposition of (H3-H4)2 tetramers and H2A-H2B dimers onto the DNA at consecutively lower salt concentrations. The delicate balance between the stability of the histone octamer on the one hand and the relative stability of the H2A-H2B dimer and (H3-H4)2 tetramer interaction with DNA at critical ionic strength may be altered in macro-NCP. To address this possibility, we reconstituted macro-NCP using two different approaches. First, instead of mixing refolded macro-octamer with DNA, we used independently refolded macro-H2AHD-H2B dimers, (H3-H4)2 tetramer, and 146-bp DNA for salt gradient deposition. This approach has previously been shown to give identical results for Xla-NCP (14Bao Y. Konesky K. Park Y.J. Rosu S. Dyer P.N. Rangasamy D. Tremethick D.J. Laybourn P.J. Luger K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Macro-NCP obtained with this method reproducibly exhibited complete heat-induced shifting, as observed for canonical Xla-NCP (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2). Second, we reconstituted major and macro-NCP in a salt-independent way, using (yNAP-1, Fig. 1C, lanes 3-8). Again, macro-NCP obtained by this method was shifted completely upon incubation at 37 °C (lane 4). Since macro-NCP did not assemble normally from refolded histone octamer using salt dialysis but only from individually purified macro-H2A-H2B dimers and (H3-H4)2 tetramers using salt gradient deposition or NAP-1, we hypothesized that the macro-H2AHD containing histone octamer may differ in its ability to dissociate into assembly-competent histone subcomplexes appropriately upon lowering the ionic strength, resulting in a compromised in vitro assembly pathway. To test this hypothesis, we monitored the ternary structure of the histone octamer by analytical gel filtration under varying ionic strengths. Histone octamer, (H3-H4)2 tetramer, and H2A-H2B dimer exhibit distinct elution profiles on a size-exclusion column due to their 2-fold difference in molecular weight (14Bao Y. Konesky K. Park Y.J. Rosu S. Dyer P.N. Rangasamy D. Tremethick D.J. Laybourn P.J. Luger K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Purified Xla- or macro-octamer, previously refolded at 2 m NaCl, was injected onto a column equilibrated with 1.7, 1.4, 1.1, 0.8, and 0.5 m NaCl, and the elution profiles were compared. Xla-octamer dissociates into H2A-H2B dimers and (H3-H4)2 tetramer at 1.1 m NaCl, (Table 1 and Fig. 2, upper panel). In striking contrast, the macro-octamer remains intact down to a concentration of 0.5 m NaCl (Table 1 and Fig. 2, middle panel). Because histones (in particular the (H3-H4)2 tetramer start to bind to DNA at a concentration of ∼1.0 m NaCl during salt gradient reconstitution, this inability to dissociate properly may result in the deposition of an entire macro-octamer (or a hexamer, i.e. one H3-H4 tetramer and one macro-H2A-H2B dimer) on the DNA, resulting in the observed nucleosome species which is either non-canonical in its histone composition or its conformation, resulting in aberrant electrophoretic mobility.TABLE 1The L1 loop of macroH2A is responsible for the different behavior of macro-octamer Samples of refolded histone octamer (in 2 m NaCl) were injected onto a Superdex-200 column equilibrated with the indicated salt concentrations, and the elution of peaks (in ml) was tabulated.

We focused on regions in the macro-H2A sequence that were shown to be structurally significantly different compared with major H2A and/or that are implicated in interactions that contribute to stabilizing the nucleosome: the L1 loop and the docking domain. We replaced the L1 loop of major H2A with that of macro-H2A by site-directed mutagenesis (N38YAE41 to H38PKY41) resulting in a mutant designated mL1-H2A (“macro L1 loop”). We used the same approach to replace the docking domain of major H2A with that of macro-H2A (L83I, Q84L, and R88A) to generate a mutant designated mDD-H2A (“macro docking domain”). Histone octamers were refolded from these mutant histones as described above, and NCPs in which major H2A was replaced with either mL1-H2A or mDD-H2A (mL1-NCPs and mDD-NCPs, respectively) were reconstituted by salt gradient dialysis. Both mutant NCPs were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. While mL1-NCP showed incomplete heat induced shifting (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6), and behaved essentially like macro-NCP, mDD-NCP behaved exactly like major NCP, i.e. heat-induced distribution to the shifted form was complete (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 8). This suggests that four amino acids in the L1 loop of macro-H2A are solely responsible for the changes in assembly that lead to the formation of the aberrant nucleosome species. We next compared the ability of histone octamers reconstituted with this H2A/macro-H2A chimera to dissociate into histone subcomplexes. Consistent with the results described above, mL1-octamer behaved exactly like macro-octamer in that it dissociated at 0.5 m NaCl (instead of 1.1 m NaCl). Elution profiles at different salt concentrations were highly comparable (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Together, these results confirm our hypothesis that the increased stability of the macro-octamer, caused by sequence differences in the four-amino acid stretch of the L1 loop (H38PKY41), is the determining factor for the formation of aberrant nucleosomes. Macro-H2A Preferentially Pairs Up with a Major-type H2A within a Single Nucleosome—The L1 loops of the two H2A moieties are involved in formation of an L1-L1 interface, which is the only site of interaction between the H2A-H2B dimers in the nucleosome (1Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (6912) Google Scholar). The loop is also responsible for the cooperative incorporation of the H2A-H2B dimers during nucleosome assembly. Almost all H2A variants exhibit significant sequence differences in the L1 loop. The likelihood of forming hybrid nucleosomes could therefore depend on the relative affinity between the L1 loops of different H2A variants and major H2A within the context of a nucleosome. To determine the ability of different H2A variants to form hybrid nucleosomes in vitro, we reconstituted nucleosomes by salt gradient dialysis (24Dyer P.N. Edayathumangalam R.S. White C.L. Bao Y. Chakravarthy S. Muthurajan U.M. Luger K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 23-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) using mixtures containing (H3-H4)2 tetramer, His-tagged major H2A-H2B dimer, macro-H2A-H2B dimer, and 146-bp α-satellite DNA in a molar ratio of 1:1:1:1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). For comparison, we performed this experiment with homotypic nucleosomes containing His-tagged major H2A (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2) or homotypic nucleosomes containing macro-H2A (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4) (molar ratio of tetramer:dimer:DNA = 1:2:1 in both cases) reconstituted in the same manner. Homotypic nucleosomes containing only variant H2A (no His-tag) and homotypic nucleosomes with only His-H2A show subtle differences in rates of migration on a 5% native PAGE-gel (compare lanes 2 and 4 in Fig. 3A). Intriguingly, when macro-H2A-H2B dimers are present in equimolar ratios with His-tagged H2A-H2B dimers, we predominantly obtain nucleosomes that exhibit an intermediate electrophoretic mobility, indicative of hybrid nucleosomes (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). To further analyze the histone content of the various nucleosome preparations, we performed batch nickel affinity chromatography to isolate nucleosomes that have the His-tagged H2A-H2B dimers (either homotypic nucleosomes containing only His-tagged H2A or putative hybrid nucleosomes with only one His-tagged H2A and one variant H2A) (Fig. 3D). Unbound and bound fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE which allows a separation of His-H2A, H2A, and macro-H2A. As expected, His-H2A-NCP binds with a high affinity to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Fig. 3B), whereas homotypic macro-H2A-NCP does not bind (Fig. 3C). In contrast, “hybrid NCPs” (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6) exhibit bands of equal intensity on the gel representing both macro-H2A and His-tagged major H2A (Fig. 3D, elute). We conclude that macro-H2A preferentially forms hybrid nucleosomes in vitro. The L1 loop significantly contributes to the propensity of macro-H2A to form hybrid nucleosomes but is not sufficient (supplemental Fig. 1). Although mL1-H2A seems to make more hybrid nucleosomes than mDD-H2A (compare lane 5 in C with lane 5 in E and F of supplemental Fig. 1), neither region drives the absolute preference for hybrid nucleosome formation seen in case of the histone domain of macro-H2A. Hybrid Macro-NCP Differs Significantly in the Structure of the L1L1 Interface Compared with Homotypic Macro-NCP— We next wanted to investigate the structural rearrangements (if any) required to form this novel nucleosome species. To this end, we determined the crystal structure of a hybrid NCP. Samples were analyze"
https://openalex.org/W1989998356,"Sphingolipids are well established effectors of signal transduction downstream of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor. In a previous study, we showed that the sphingosine kinase/sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) pathway couples TNF receptor to induction of the cyclooxygenase 2 gene and prostaglandin synthesis (Pettus, B. J., Bielawski, J., Porcelli, A. M., Reames, D. L., Johnson, K. R., Morrow, J., Chalfant, C. E., Obeid, L. M., and Hannun, Y. A. (2003) FASEB J. 17, 1411-1421). In this study, the requirement for acid sphingomyelinase and sphingomyelin metabolites in the TNFα/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) pathway was investigated. The amphiphilic compound desipramine, a frequently employed inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase), blocked PGE2 production. However, the action of desipramine was independent of its action on ASMase, since neither genetic loss of ASMase (Niemann-Pick fibroblasts) nor knockdown of ASMase using RNA interference affected TNFα-induced PGE2 synthesis. Further investigations revealed that desipramine down-regulated acid ceramidase (AC), but not sphingosine kinase, at the protein level. This resulted in a time-dependent drop in sphingosine and S1P levels. Moreover, exogenous administration of either sphingosine or S1P rescued PGE2 biosynthesis after desipramine treatment. Interestingly, knockdown of endogenous AC by RNA interference attenuated cyclooxygenase 2 induction by TNFα and subsequent PGE2 biosynthesis. Taken together, these results define a novel role for AC in the TNFα/PGE2 pathway. In addition, the results of this study warrant careful reconsideration of desipramine as a specific inhibitor for ASMase. Sphingolipids are well established effectors of signal transduction downstream of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor. In a previous study, we showed that the sphingosine kinase/sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) pathway couples TNF receptor to induction of the cyclooxygenase 2 gene and prostaglandin synthesis (Pettus, B. J., Bielawski, J., Porcelli, A. M., Reames, D. L., Johnson, K. R., Morrow, J., Chalfant, C. E., Obeid, L. M., and Hannun, Y. A. (2003) FASEB J. 17, 1411-1421). In this study, the requirement for acid sphingomyelinase and sphingomyelin metabolites in the TNFα/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) pathway was investigated. The amphiphilic compound desipramine, a frequently employed inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase), blocked PGE2 production. However, the action of desipramine was independent of its action on ASMase, since neither genetic loss of ASMase (Niemann-Pick fibroblasts) nor knockdown of ASMase using RNA interference affected TNFα-induced PGE2 synthesis. Further investigations revealed that desipramine down-regulated acid ceramidase (AC), but not sphingosine kinase, at the protein level. This resulted in a time-dependent drop in sphingosine and S1P levels. Moreover, exogenous administration of either sphingosine or S1P rescued PGE2 biosynthesis after desipramine treatment. Interestingly, knockdown of endogenous AC by RNA interference attenuated cyclooxygenase 2 induction by TNFα and subsequent PGE2 biosynthesis. Taken together, these results define a novel role for AC in the TNFα/PGE2 pathway. In addition, the results of this study warrant careful reconsideration of desipramine as a specific inhibitor for ASMase.

A rate-limiting enzyme during prostaglandin synthesis is the inducible form of cyclooxygenase (COX-2), a major target for anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapy. Recently, the cytokines TNFα and IL-1β were shown to induce COX-2 through activating the SK1/S1P pathway, such that knockdown of SK1 by RNA interference blocked the induction by TNFα of COX-2 and subsequent PGE2 synthesis (1Pettus B.J. Bielawski J. Porcelli A.M. Reames D.L. Johnson K.R. Morrow J. Chalfant C.E. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1411-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Interestingly, S1P synergizes with a parallel ceramide kinase (CK)/ceramide 1-phosphate pathway, which regulates cytosolic phospholipase A2 and arachidonic acid release (2Pettus B.J. Kitatani K.

Besides COX-2 induction, S1P has also been shown to affect neutrophil priming (3MacKinnon A.C. Buckley A. Chilvers E.R. Rossi A.G. Haslett C. Sethi T. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6394-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), macrophage activation (4Wu W. Mosteller R.D. Broek D. Mol.

J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and chemotaxis of inflammatory cells. Therefore, the SK1/S1P pathway is emerging as a key regulator of several aspects of the inflammatory cascade (reviewed in Refs. 6Chalfant C.E. Spiegel S. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 7Pettus B.J. Chalfant C.E. Hannun Y.A. Curr. Mol.

Although SK1 plays a major role, regulation of S1P levels is a function of the net responses of enzymes of the sphingolipid network that influence the levels of ceramide and sphingosine (precursors for S1P synthesis). Ceramide generated de novo or from sphingomyelin (SM) hydrolysis can be deacylated by ceramidases to sphingosine. Consequently, agonist-driven activation of SK1 results in conversion of sphingosine to S1P. Indeed, evidence supporting the existence of such a signaling pathway began to emerge from studies implicating sphingolipids in regulation of COX-2. For example, treatment with sphingolipid metabolites, such as ceramide, sphingosine, or S1P, induces production of PGE2 (9Ballou L.R. Chao C.P. Holness M.A. Barker S.C. Raghow R. J. Biol.

Furthermore, ceramide exogenously added or generated by treatment with sphingomyelinase (SMase) enhanced IL-1-mediated PGE2 production (9Ballou L.R. Chao C.P. Holness M.A. Barker S.C. Raghow R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20044-20050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies implicate SM metabolites in COX-2 regulation, the contribution of the implicated enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism, namely ceramidases and sphingomyelinases, to this process is poorly understood. In this study, we focused initially on defining the contribution of acid SMase (ASMase) to cytokine-induced generation of S1P. In humans, ASMase deficiency results in Niemann-Pick disease (NPD), a neurodegenerative disorder resulting in pathologic lysosomal accumulation of SM. Whereas numerous studies have suggested ASMase as an important player during receptor- and nonreceptor-mediated cellular stress responses (reviewed in Refs. 13Gulbins E. Kolesnick R. Subcell. Biochem. 2002; 36: 229-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Marchesini N. Hannun Y.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 15Andrieu-Abadie N. Levade T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the role of ASMase in inflammatory signaling cascades, such as prostaglandin synthesis, remains unknown. The availability of genetic models (knock-out mice) and cell lines derived from NPD patients allowed better understanding of the role of ASMase in signal transduction pathways. Attempts to determine contributions of ASMase to cell responses have also relied on the use of pharmacological inhibitors, especially tricyclic amines. The addition of the tricyclic amine desipramine to neuroblastoma cells and skin fibroblasts was shown to decrease ASMase activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner (16Albouz S. Hauw J.J. Berwald-Netter Y. Boutry J.M. Bourdon R. Baumann N. Biomedicine. 1981; 35: 218-220PubMed Google Scholar, 17Albouz S. Vanier M.T. Hauw J.J. Le Saux F. Boutry J.M. Baumann N. Neurosci. Lett. 1983; 36: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there was no change in ASMase activity when desipramine was added to cellular homogenates in vitro, suggesting an indirect effect of the compound. The mechanism of ASMase inhibition by desipramine was addressed in careful studies by Sandhoff and coworkers. The authors demonstrated that desipramine, probably by virtue of its cationic amphiphilic properties, displaces ASMase from a membrane-bound state to the lysosomal lumen, allowing its proteolytic degradation (18Kolzer M. Werth N. Sandhoff K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether this process is specific for ASMase or not. Although the results from this study showed that desipramine treatment inhibited PGE2 synthesis, we provide evidence that this process is independent of ASMase inactivation. Further investigations revealed that desipramine down-regulated acid ceramidase (AC) at the protein level without influencing total cellular SK1. This resulted in a drop in total cellular levels of sphingosine and S1P. Finally, using RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown, we demonstrate that AC is required in the TNFα/PGE2 pathway. Potential mechanisms by which AC may contribute to this response are discussed. We also discuss the potential uses of desipramine as a pharmacologic agent in evaluating sphingolipid-mediated responses. Materials and Cell Culture—L929 murine fibroblasts were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere with saturated humidity. NPD fibroblasts and control Lesch-Nyhan fibroblasts were obtained from The Kennedy Krieger Institute (Baltimore, MD) and cultured in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. In most assays, cells were seeded at 50,000 cells/well in 6-well dishes unless otherwise indicated. Human recombinant TNFα was purchased from PeproTech, Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Desipramine was purchased from Sigma. C16-ceramide, sphingosine, and S1P were synthesized in the Lipidomics Core Facility at the Medical University of South Carolina. For ceramidase assays, N-[12-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl]-d-erythro-sphingosine was purchased from Avanti (Alabaster, AL). COX-2 was probed using specific anti-human polyclonal primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). AC mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences, and SK1 rabbit polyclonal antibody was described previously (19Johnson K.R. Becker K.P. Facchinetti M.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35257-35262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). PGE2 Assay—The PGE2 assay was performed using a prostaglandin E2 monoclonal enzyme immunoassay kit from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Media containing PGE2 collected from the indicated treatment groups competed with PGE2-acetylcholinesterase conjugate for a limited amount of PGE2 monoclonal antibody. The antibody-PGE2 conjugate bound to a goat anti-mouse antibody previously attached to the wells. The plate was washed to remove any unbound reagents, and then the substrate to acetylcholinesterase was provided. The concentration of PGE2 in a sample is inversely proportional to the yellow color produced. The results are expressed as pg/ml calculated according to the PGE2 standard curve. Western Blotting—L929 fibroblasts subjected to the indicated treatments were scraped on ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation. Cells were lysed using radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer supplemented with a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce), and lysates were normalized to protein concentration using Bio-Rad Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Samples (30 μg) were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. This was followed by protein transfer to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes and blocking with 5% milk or bovine albumin solution. Blots were probed by overnight incubation with the indicated antibodies. Membranes were washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline before adding appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The ECL immunoblotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to visualize the bands. Equal loading was checked by probing with actin-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In Vitro SMase Assay—SMase assay was carried out by the method described previously (20Marchesini N. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13775-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). L929 cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors using a probe sonicator. Cellular debris was removed after centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. Proteins (50 μg) were adjusted to a total volume of 100 μl, and the reaction was started by adding 100 μl of the reaction mixture containing 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 100 μm [choline-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin, and 0.1% Triton X-100. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the reaction was stopped by adding 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) followed by adding 400 μl of water. Phases were separated by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min. Quantitation of the amount of released radioactive phosphocholine was determined by subjecting 400 μl of the upper phase to scintillation counting. In Vitro AC Assay—Detection of total cellular AC enzymatic activity was performed according to previously described methods (21Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H.

Briefly, fibroblasts were lysed in an acidic buffer (pH 4.5) consisting of 50 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Lysates normalized to equal total proteins (50 μg) were incubated in the assay buffer (pH 4.5), consisting of 0.2% Igepal-CA 630, 250 mm sodium acetate, and 150 μm NBD-C12 ceramide in a total volume of 100 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Conversion of NBD-C12 ceramide to NBD-dodecanoic acid was detected by spotting the organic phase on a TLC plate. Results were quantitated by densitometric analysis using ImageQuant software. RNA Interference—Knockdown of ASMase and AC was achieved using RNA interference technology. For each target gene, 21 nucleotide duplexes were designed and then purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The sequences were as follows: murine ASMase, (UGG GAC UCC UUU GGA UGG G)dTdT and (CCC AUC CAA AGG AGU CCC A)dTdT; murine AC, (UCA ACG UAU CCU CCU UCU G)dTdT and (CAG AAG GAG GAU ACG UUG A)dTdT; murine NC, (UGA CAG UCA UCA CAG UGG C)dTdT and (GCC ACU GUG AUG ACU GUC A)dTdT. Transfection was performed using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 48 h, cells were treated with TNFα and assayed as described. The efficiency of gene silencing was assessed by measuring enzymatic activity or protein levels of the target gene. Levels of Sphingolipid Metabolites—Mass spectrometric analysis of lipids was performed using electrospray ionization MS/MS analysis on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadruple mass spectrometer, operating in multiple reaction-monitoring positive ionization mode as described previously. Briefly, about 2-3 × 106 cells were fortified with the internal standards (ISs; C17 base d-erythrosphingosine, N-palmitoyl-d-erythro-C13-sphingosine, and heptade-canoyl-d-erythrosphingosine). Calibration curves were constructed by plotting peak area ratios of synthetic standards corresponding to each target analyte with respect to the appropriate internal standard. The target analyte peak areas from the samples were similarly normalized to their respective internal standard and then compared with the calibration curves using a linear regression model. Results were normalized to total protein levels. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was performed between control and treated states and/or between treatment and treatment plus RNAi-mediated inhibition states on a minimum of three independent experiments. Desipramine Blocks the TNF/PGE2 Pathway Upstream of S1P but Independent of Its Action on ASMase—The tricyclic antidepressant desipramine has been extensively employed as an irreversible inhibitor for lysosomal ASMase. Since original studies documented inhibition of ASMase by desipramine in different cell lines, we studied the kinetics of this process in L929 fibroblasts. The results showed that desipramine inhibited ASMase in a dose- and time-dependent manner with ED50 of 5 μm and greater than 80% inhibition achieved within 1 h of treatment (supplemental Fig. 1). Therefore, for the rest of this study, we used 10 μm desipramine for 1 h in order to inhibit ASMase. A key role for TNFα in the inflammatory cascade is induction of inflammatory mediators, such as the prostaglandin PGE2. Treatment of L929 cells with TNFα for 8 h resulted in extracellular release of PGE2 into the medium. Interestingly, pretreatment with desipramine resulted in significant reduction in the levels of PGE2 detected after TNFα treatment (Fig. 1A). Since COX-2 is a rate-limiting step during prostaglandin biosynthesis, the effect of desipramine on COX-2 induction was evaluated. As expected, a robust elevation in COX-2 protein levels was observed after 8 h of TNFα treatment. However, the COX-2 response was markedly attenuated after pretreatment with desipramine (Fig. 1A). Next, and in order to determine if desipramine affected the sphingolipid pathway upstream of COX-2, the levels of S1P, which has been shown to be necessary for induction of COX-2 in response to TNF, were analyzed under similar treatment conditions. Mass spectrometric measurements revealed significant elevation in S1P within 10 min of TNF treatment. Interestingly, the S1P response was significantly attenuated in desipramine-pretreated cells (Fig. 1B). This result points to a site of action of desipramine upstream of the generation of S1P. The above results showing significant effects of desipramine on COX-2 and S1P are potentially consistent with a role for ASMase in the TNFα-PGE2 pathway, and we investigated this role using fibroblasts derived from NPD patients who exhibit genetic deficiency in ASMase activity. However, the results showed that NPD fibroblasts responded to TNFα with a robust elevation of PGE2 that actually exceeded the response seen in “control” fibroblasts derived from Lesch-Nyhan patients, who have no perturbations in ASMase (Fig. 2A). Moreover, and similar to L929 cells, desipramine treatment was still able to attenuate the PGE2 response in NPD fibroblasts (Fig. 2B). Thus, in contradistinction to the results with desipramine, these results in NPD fibroblasts argue against a role for ASMase in the TNF-induced PGE2. Because of the discrepancy of results between desipramine-treated cells and NPD fibroblasts, we resorted to investigating the role of ASMase using RNAi. Cells were treated with two different concentrations (25 and 50 nm) of either scrambled or ASMase RNAi for 48 h. Subsequently, cells from each treatment group were evaluated for total ASMase activity. As shown in Fig. 2C, 25 and 50 nm of ASMase RNAi down-regulated the enzyme activity by 40 and 75%, respectively. Having established the effectiveness of RNAi-mediated knockdown, the effects of RNAi on the TNFα response were then evaluated. Thus, cells were transfected with either ASMase RNAi or scrambled sequence for 48 h before PGE2 detection. As shown in Fig. 2D, ASMase knockdown did not exert a significant effect on the PGE2 response. Together with the results from NPD cells, the results from knockdown imply that the PGE2 response does not require the activity of ASMase. A Functional Lysosomal Compartment Is Required for PGE2 Biosynthesis—Activation of the TNF receptor elicits changes in different cellular compartments, including mitochondria, lysosomes, and nucleus. Since desipramine is a lysomotropic hydrophobic amine, its actions (including effects on ASMase) point to the lysosome. To investigate the role of lysosomal sphingolipid metabolism in prostanoid biosynthesis, we used the lysomotropic agent chloroquine. L929 fibroblasts preincubated with 50 μm chloroquine were treated with or without recombinant human TNFα. The production of PGE2 was then analyzed after 8 h. Whereas treatment with TNFα enhanced PGE2 production, this response was markedly blocked after pretreatment with chloroquine (Fig. 3A). Since S1P generation has been shown as an indispensable step for cytokine-induced PGE2 production, it became important to measure levels of this proinflammatory sphingolipid. As illustrated in Fig. 3B, preincubation with chloroquine blocked synthesis of S1P after TNFα treatment. These findings suggest that a functional lysosomal compartment is required for events downstream of the TNF receptor, leading to S1P and prostanoid production. Desipramine Decreases Levels of Sphingosine and S1P—Since in previous studies S1P was implicated in mediating the effects of TNFα on PGE2 (1Pettus B.J. Bielawski J. Porcelli A.M. Reames D.L. Johnson K.R. Morrow J. Chalfant C.E. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1411-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), we investigated whether desipramine modulated sphingolipid levels. After incubation of L929 cells with 10 μm desipramine, sphingolipid levels were analyzed over a period of 4 h by mass spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 4A, desipramine treatment did not change basal levels of total ceramide. However, the results showed a significant time-dependent drop in the levels of sphingosine and S1P (Fig. 4B). Although this decrease was still observed after up to 4 h of desipramine treatment, the maximal drops in S1P (60%) and sphingosine (40%) were observed within the first 30 and 60 min, respectively. Therefore, desipramine modulates acutely the levels of two bioactive sphingolipids. Desipramine Down-regulates AC but Not SK1—To address the mechanism of S1P down-regulation, we investigated the effects of desipramine on SK1. To that end, L929 fibroblasts were treated with 10 μm desipramine, and SK1 levels were analyzed by Western blotting. The results showed that SK1 protein levels were unchanged after 4 h of desipramine treatment (Fig. 5A). Therefore, unlike its effects on ASMase, desipramine did not induce down-regulation of SK1. Since S1P biosynthesis requires the presence of its precursor substrate sphingosine and since desipramine induced a significant drop in sphingosine levels, we next evaluated the effects of desipramine on ceramidases. We focused on acid ceramidase, since, similar to ASMase, this enzyme is present in the lysosome and indeed is found to interact with ASMase (25He X. Okino N. Dhami R. Dagan A. Gatt S. Schulze H. Sandhoff K. Schuchman E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32978-32986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis revealed loss of AC protein that correlated with the dose and time of desipramine treatment, as illustrated in Fig. 5, B and C, respectively. Next, we addressed the question whether the observed down-regulation of AC is mediated by a proteolytic process. To that end, desipramine treatment was performed in the presence or absence of the broad range protease inhibitors pepstatin and leupeptin. Interestingly, leupeptin treatment restored basal protein levels of AC, suggesting that the desipramine effect is mediated by a cysteine protease (Fig. 5D). These results have two important implications. They first demonstrate that the effects of desipramine on sphingolipid enzymes are not restricted to ASMase. They also suggest that acid ceramidase may play a role in the PGE2 response to TNFα. AC Is Required for TNFα—induced PGE2 Synthesis—Based on the above and in order to evaluate the role of AC in the TNFα/PGE2 pathway, we employed RNAi to achieve specific knockdown of AC. To that end, L929 cells were treated with 50 nm scrambled or AC-specific RNAi sequences. After incubation for 48 h, a significant drop (80%) in total AC protein levels was observed (Fig. 6A). The results showed that the basal levels of PGE2 were similar in cells treated with AC or scrambled RNAi. However, knockdown of AC resulted in a significant inhibition of PGE2 production after 8 h of TNFα treatment (Fig. 6A). Likewise, induction of COX-2 by TNFα was attenuated after loss of AC. On the other hand, targeting neutral ceramidase (NC) with a specific RNAi sequence did not influence PGE2 biosynthesis after TNF treatment (Fig. 6B). Thus, AC appears to contribute to the production of PGE2, probably through its influence on the levels of S1P. To investigate whether TNFα treatment modulates AC activity, an in vitro enzymatic assay was performed. After an acute time course of TNF treatment (20 min), total cellular lysates were incubated with fluorescently labeled C-12 ceramide at pH 4.5. As shown in Fig. 6C, there were no detectable changes in ceramide breakdown to dodecanoic acid after TNF treatment. Therefore, the results suggest that the TNF/PGE2 pathway selectively utilizes sphingosine generated via basal AC activity without activating the enzyme itself. In order to determine if exogenous delivery of specific sphingolipids would overcome the desipramine-induced inhibition, we evaluated the effects of ceramide, sphingosine, and S1P on PGE2 production alone or in response to TNFα plus desipramine. The results showed that exogenous treatment with sphingosine and S1P, but not ceramide, rescued the PGE2 response to TNFα after desipramine treatment (Fig. 7). Thus, taken together, the results suggest an important role for acid ceramidase in regulating the PGE2 response to TNFα. The present study provides specific insights into the role of sphingolipid metabolism and signaling in regulation of the TNFα/PGE2 pathway. Using a L929 fibroblast cell culture model, it was found that the tricyclic amine desipramine inhibits COX-2 induction and PGE2 production in response to TNFα. Although desipramine treatment down-regulated ASMase activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner, the results suggest that ASMase per se does not participate in this pathway. On the other hand, the results point to AC as the relevant target for this compound in the TNF/PGE2 pathway. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that desipramine induced a time-dependent drop in sphingosine and S1P cellular levels, without noticeable changes in ceramide. Furthermore, it was observed that desipramine down-regulates AC but not SK1 protein levels. Moreover, using AC specific RNAi, it was shown that AC is important for PGE2 synthesis induced by TNFα. Finally, both sphingosine and S1P, but not ceramide, overcame the desipramine effect, thus further localizing the action of desipramine to AC. A major finding of this study is that regulation of PGE2 synthesis by TNFα is independent of ASMase. This conclusion is supported by the following observations. 1) Treatment of NPD fibroblasts with TNFα resulted in pronounced synthesis of PGE2 that exceeded the levels secreted by control fibroblasts. 2) There was no significant change in the levels of PGE2 after knockdown of ASMase using specific RNAi sequence. These results are consistent with an earlier study by Manthey and Schuchman (26Manthey C.L. Schuchman E.H. Cytokine. 1998; 10: 654-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) examining the role of ASMase in lipopolysaccharide signaling. The authors reported that lipopolysaccharide-induced g"

Finally, we showed that FAN is involved in PAS1-regulated processes because FAN overproduction partly complemented the pas1 phenotype. We suggest that PAS1 regulates the function of this NAC-like transcription factor by controlling its targeting to the nucleus upon plant cell division. Immunophilins are a large family of proteins with peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase (PPiase) 5The abbreviations used are: PPiase, peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase; FKBP, FK506-binding protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; FAN, FKBP-associated NAC; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MBP, maltose-binding protein; RT, reverse transcription; NAM, no apical meristem; IRF4, interferon-regulating factor 4; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; RTS, rapid translation system.5The abbreviations used are: PPiase, peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase; FKBP, FK506-binding protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; FAN, FKBP-associated NAC; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MBP, maltose-binding protein; RT, reverse transcription; NAM, no apical meristem; IRF4, interferon-regulating factor 4; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; RTS, rapid translation system. activity (1Dornan J.

Immunophilins include cyclophilins and FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs). FKBPs, like other immunophilins, are found in all organisms and have many cellular activities (2Galat A. Curr. Top Med.

For example, the mammalian FKBP12, the smallest protein known to display PPiase activity and drug binding, mediates immunosuppression and modulates signal transduction pathways by interacting with ryanodine receptors, the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor, transforming growth factor receptor type I, and epidermal growth factor receptor (5Lehnart S.E.

Cells from FKBP12 knock-out mice display high levels of proliferation because of hyperactivity of the transforming growth factor receptor (9Aghdasi B. Ye K. Resnick A. Huang A. Ha H.C. Guo X.

The large mammalian FKBPs, FKBP52 and FKBP51, are associated with HSP90 in the native steroid receptor complex and modulate the activity of this complex (10Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. Murphy P.J.

The interaction between FKBP52 and dynein has been shown to facilitate import of the steroid receptor complex into the nucleus (10Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. Murphy P.J. Chinkers M. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Zhang M. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13602-13610Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Large FKBPs have also been found in complexes with transcription factors such as interferon-regulating factor 4 (IRF-4) (12Mamane Y. Sharma S. Petropoulos L. Lin R. Hiscott J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 129-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and Ying Yang 1 (YY1) (13Yang W.M. Yao Y.L. Seto E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4814-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Very few functional studies are available concerning the cellular role of FKBPs. FKBP12 inactivation was investigated only in mammals (8Shou W. Aghdasi B. Armstrong D.L. Guo Q. Bao S. Charng M.J. Mathews L.M. Schneider M.D. Hamilton S.L. Matzuk M.M.

A. 2001; 98: 2425-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and the function of FKBPs in yeast remains unclear, because a strain in which all the immunophilins were inactivated remained viable (14Dolinski K. Muir S. Cardenas M. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13093-13098Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The first comprehensive analysis of all the immunophilins in a multicellular eukaryote was recently performed in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (15He Z. Li L. Luan S. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1248-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 16Romano P.G.N. Horton H. Gray J.E. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1268-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This plant was found to contain a family of 52 immunophilins, differing in length, domain organization, and predicted subcellular distribution. Characterization of mutants in high molecular weight immunophilins of A. thaliana showed that these molecules play an important role in plant development. Mutations in the FKBP TWISTED DWARF (TWD) gene lead to defects in cell elongation and disorientation of the growth of all plant organs (17Geisler M. Kolukisaoglu H.U. Bouchard R. Billion K. Berger J. Saal B. Frangne N. Koncz-Kalman Z. Koncz C. Dudler R. Blakeslee J.J. Murphy A.S. Martinoia E. Schulz B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4238-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). TWD is present in the plasma membrane and was found to be associated with HSP90 and the multidrug resistant-like ABC transporter AtPGP1 (17Geisler M. Kolukisaoglu H.U. Bouchard R. Billion K. Berger J. Saal B. Frangne N. Koncz-Kalman Z. Koncz C. Dudler R. Blakeslee J.J. Murphy A.S. Martinoia E. Schulz B. Mol. Biol.

Plant J. 2002; 32: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Studies of loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the cyclophilin CYP40 have shown that this molecule is required for the juvenile vegetative phase of shoot development (19Berardini T.Z. Bollman K. Sun H. Poethig R.S. Science. 2001; 291: 2405-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Finally, the large FKBP PASTIC-CINO1 (PAS1) has also been shown to be essential for plant development (20Vittorioso P. Cowling R. Faure J.D. Caboche M. Bellini C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3034-3043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PAS1 is required for correct cell division and cell differentiation, as mutations in the gene encoding this FKBP (also known as AtFKBP70) caused ectopic cell division, leading to tumor growth in the presence of the plant hormone cytokinins (21Faure J.D. Vittorioso P. Santoni V. Fraisier V. Prinsen E. Barlier I. Vanonckelen H. Caboche M. Bellini C. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 909-918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PAS1 mutant plants grown in the light have short, thick hypocotyls with misshaped cotyledons that never expand (21Faure J.D. Vittorioso P. Santoni V. Fraisier V. Prinsen E. Barlier I. Vanonckelen H. Caboche M. Bellini C. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 909-918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant meristems are often disorganized but continue to generate leaves, although these leaves are abnormal and fused. Abnormal cell division and differentiation are associated with changes in responses to the plant hormones cytokinins and auxin (22Harrar Y. Bellec Y. Bellini C. Faure J.D. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1217-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PAS1 is mainly expressed in zones with high levels of mitotic activity, such as the shoot and root apical meristems (20Vittorioso P. Cowling R. Faure J.D. Caboche M. Bellini C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3034-3043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PAS1 has three FKBP12-like domains at the N terminus of the protein, three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) units, and a C-terminal domain. The TPR motif, a degenerate 34-amino acid repeat, is known to be involved in protein-protein interactions in many processes, including cell cycle regulation, RNA synthesis, protein transport, Ser-Thr dephosphorylation, and heat shock response (23Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of PAS1, like that of its mammalian homolog, binds calmodulin in vitro in a calcium-dependent manner and may be considered to be a calmodulin-binding domain (24Carol R.J. Breiman A. Erel N. Vittorioso P. Bellini C. Plant Sci. 2001; 161: 527-535Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We carried out a functional analysis of PAS1 protein, evaluating the role of one of its domains. We demonstrated that the C-terminal region controlled the subcellular distribution of the protein and interactions with other proteins. This domain was able to recruit a member of the NAC family of transcription factors and to target this transcription factor to the nucleus. Our data provide new insight into the biochemical role of high molecular weight immunophilins. GFP/DsRED/mRFP Fusion Proteins—The full-length (1901 bp) and C-terminally deleted (1555 bp) PAS1 cDNAs were inserted between a 2× 35S promoter and a poly(A) 35S terminator in pOL GFPS65C (25Peeters N.M. Chapron A. Giritch A. Grandjean O. Lancelin D. Lhomme T. Vivrel A. Small I. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The resulting 35S promoter-PAS1::GFP-35S terminator cassettes were introduced into the binary vector pCAMBIA 1300 to obtain the PAS1::GFP and PASΔC:GFP constructs. Strep::PAS1 and Strep::PAS1ΔC protein fusions were produced from the pIVEX4 vector (Roche Applied Science). The full-length FAN cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR and inserted into the GATEWAY™-modified vector HispKM596 (Invitrogen) to produce the fusion protein of FAN with the maltose-binding protein (MBP::FAN). FAN cDNA was inserted behind the 35S promoter into the pGWB2 vector from Tsuyoshi Nakagawa (Research Institute of Molecular Genetics, Shimane University, Matsue, Japan). FAN cDNA was also cloned into pGDR to produce the fusion protein DsRED2:FAN (26Goodin M.M. Dietzgen R.G. Schichnes D. Ruzin S. Jackson A.O. Plant J. 2002; 31: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). A DsRED-based vector was required for the acceptor bleaching FRET experiments because DsRED, unlike mRFP, has an excitation spectrum compatible with the emission spectrum of GFP and is sensitive to bleaching. The Gateway vectors pH7WGR2 and pH7RWG2 were used to generate mRFP: FAN fusion proteins (27Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). BY2 Cell Culture, Synchronization, and Transformation— Suspension-cultured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L., cv. BY2) cells (28Kato K. Matsumoto T. Koiwai A. Mizusaki S. Nishida K. Noguchi M. Tamaki E. Terui G. Fermentation Technology Today. Society of Fermentation Technology, Osaka, Japan1972Google Scholar) were grown in modified MS basal medium (29Nagata T. Nemoto Y. Hasezawa S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 132: 1-30Crossref Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) in the dark at 24 °C, on a rotary shaker (130 rpm). Cells were subcultured by transfer to fresh medium once every 7 days (1:30 dilution). For transformation, 3 ml of BY2 cell suspension was incubated with 2 ml of MS medium containing 50 μl of a stationary phase culture of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1, in the dark, for 36 h, without shaking. BY2 cells were thoroughly washed and cultured for 2 days in the dark (24 °C, 130 rpm). Cells were then incubated for 2 days with the antibiotic for selection (20 μg/ml hygromycin B, Duchefa). We obtained stable, independent transformants by plating cells at low density on agar-MS medium containing 200 mg/ml cefotaxime and the antibiotic for selection (20 or 40 μg/ml hygromycin) and incubating them in the dark (at 24 °C) for 4-6 weeks. In Situ Hybridization—The DNA template for the antisense RNA probe was produced by PCR with the following oligonucleotides: for PAS1 (5′-GGTGAGGGCTGGGAATCTCC-3′ and 5′-TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCAAGCCAGTCCAGTCTCTTGG-3′) and FAN (5′-GGTACAAGTCAGAAGGCACC-3′ and 5′-TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCAACATTGCTATCAGAGCCAC-3′). The reverse primer includes the synthetic minimal T7 promoter in a 5′-position. Digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were synthesized by incubating T7 RNA polymerase and 1 μg of DNA template in a final volume of 20 μl for 40 min at 37 °C, according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer of the enzyme. Siliques were fixed, mounted in Historesin, and sectioned as described previously (30Laufs P. Dockx J. Kronenberger J. Traas J. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sections were dewaxed and mounted on slides. They were treated for 10 min with 10 μg/ml proteinase K and then for 10 min with anhydrous acetic acid/triethanolamide. Finally, the sections were dehydrated. Sections were hybridized overnight at 45 °C in mRNA in situ hybridization solution (Dakocytomation, Dako). Slides were washed by incubation for 30 min at 45 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS and then for 60 min at 45 °C in 2× SSC, 50% formamide. They were then incubated with RNase for 30 min (10 mg/ml in NTE buffer) and washed by incubation for 60 min at 45 °C in 2× SSC, 50% formamide. Digoxigenin-labeled probes were detected with alkaline phosphatase-coupled antibodies, as described previously (30Laufs P. Dockx J. Kronenberger J. Traas J. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein-Protein Interactions—The fusion proteins Strep::PAS1 and Strep::PAS1ΔC were produced with the rapid translation system, RTS 100 Escherichia coli kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with a BAS 1500 (Fuji). For MBP-tag/amylose affinity purification, the amylose matrix (100 μl/reaction) was incubated for 45 min with W buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) supplemented with 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton. BL21(DE3)pLysE cells expressing the MBP:FAN construct were induced by incubation with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 24 °C. Induced cells were centrifuged and resuspended in W buffer. The cells were incubated for 30 min on ice in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, frozen at -70 °C, and thawed in the presence of 40 μg/ml of DNase I for 10 min on ice. The resulting suspension was centrifuged (14,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was incubated with amylose. The matrix was then washed and incubated with an RTS 100 reaction mixture containing the Strep:PAS1 protein. Proteins were eluted with 10 mm maltose and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-PAS1 antibody. The CTTVSTERKRRWSEK-amide peptide from the C-terminal part of PAS1 was synthesized and used to elicit an antiserum (anti-PAS1) in rabbit (Biogenes). For streptavidin tag/Strep-Tactin (IBA) affinity purification, the matrix was prepared as described above. An RTS 100 reaction mixture containing Strep:PAS1 protein or Strep:PAS1ΔC was incubated with the Strep-Tactin matrix, with washing and elution according to the manufacturer's instructions (IBA). Eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-MBP antibody (kindly provided by Jean-Michel Betton, Institut Pasteur France). For pulldown assays, 10-day-old PAS1:GFP seedlings (1 g) were ground in liquid nitrogen, and 1-4 mg/ml protein was extracted in extraction buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton, and protease inhibitors). The crude extract was incubated with a MBP:FAN amylose matrix. The proteins were washed, eluted, and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science). Plant Materials and Transformation—A. tumefaciens strain C58C1 was electroporated with the pCAMBIA PAS1::GFP, PAS1ΔC:GFP and pGWB2 35S::FAN binary vectors and used to transform plants as described by Clough and Bent (31Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heterozygous pas1-3 plants were transformed, and primary transformants were selected in vitro in the presence of 15 mg/liter hygromycin B (Duchefa) and 50 mg/liter kanamycin (Duchefa) for the pCAMBIA and pCWB2 vectors, respectively. Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown in the greenhouse under the following conditions: 13 h of light, diurnal temperature of 25 °C, and nocturnal temperature of 17 °C. These plants were used for all agroinfiltration experiments. Leaves were infiltrated (32Rathjen J.P. Chang J.H. Staskawicz B.J. Michelmore R.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3232-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with an exponential phase culture of A. tumefaciens strain C58C1 resuspended at an A600 of 0.5 in 0.04 g/ml saccharose. For coinfiltration experiments, equal volumes of the two cultures were mixed before agroinfiltration. Observations were performed 48 h after transformation. Confocal Microscopy and FRET Measurements—Confocal microscopy was carried out with an inverted Leica TCS-SP2-AOBS spectral confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica). Samples were excited with a 488 nm argon laser with an emission band of 500-530 nm for GFP detection and with the 594 nm HeNe laser with an emission band of 600-635 nm for DsRED/mRFP detection. Nuclei were stained with 4 μm SYTO16 (Molecular Probes) and visualized with an emission band of 500 to 330 nm after excitation at 488 nm in sequential mode. For FRET measurements, Leica FRET acceptor photobleaching was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. DsRED was photobleached in a region 4-8 μm in diameter, by four scans with the 543 nm laser at 100%, with a small illumination beam to increase bleaching efficiency (Leica Beam Expander). GFP fluorescence intensity was quantified before (donor 1 (d1) and after (donor 1 (d2)) acceptor photobleaching, and FRET efficiency was automatically determined by Leica software, using the (d2 - d1)/d2 equation. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNAs were extracted and treated with DNase according to the RNeasy plant kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcriptions were performed from total DNase-treated RNA with Superscript II enzyme (Qiagen) according to standard protocols. PCRs were performed on Roche Applied Science LightCycler with primers for Arabidopsis FAN (CC TCG TCA TTA TCC ACC TGT, GGG GAG AAA CTA CTC GCT GA) and EF1α as control (CCA AGG GTG AAA GCA AGA AGA, CTG GAG GTT TTG AGG CTG GTA T). Mutations in the C-terminal Domain of PAS1 Lead to Severe Developmental Defects—The pas1 mutants were originally isolated on the basis of their early developmental phenotype. Two alleles were analyzed in more detail, as both the mutations concerned the C-terminal domain of the protein. The pas1-1 allele was obtained from the Versailles T-DNA collection and resulted from an insertion in the 19th exon of the gene (20Vittorioso P. Cowling R. Faure J.D. Caboche M. Bellini C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3034-3043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). This insertion led to the deletion of 127 amino acids, corresponding to the last 12 amino acids of the third TPR motif and the entire C-terminal region. A second allele with a mutation in the C-terminal part of PAS1 gene, pas1-3, was identified from a population subjected to ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis. The pas1-3 mutation involves the replacement of G3417 (from the ATG) by A at the intron 18 donor splicing site (Fig. 1A). This mutation results in partial splicing of the 19th exon, generating a smaller transcript, a translational frameshift, and a premature stop codon (Fig. 1, B and C). The predicted sequence of the PAS1 protein in the pas1-3 mutant displayed a deletion of 134 amino acids, corresponding to the last 19 amino acids of the third TPR motif and the entire C-terminal domain (Fig. 1C). The two alleles had similar developmental phenotypes, with a small, thick hypocotyl, finger-shaped cotyledons and small fused leaves (Fig. 1D). Both mutants displayed ectopic cell proliferation in the presence of cytokinins (data not shown). The identification of two mutations with similar phenotypes and modified PAS1 protein C termini suggests that this domain plays an essential role in plant development. The C-terminal Domain Is Required for PAS1 Exclusion from the Nucleus—We investigated the intracellular distribution of PAS1, using a PAS1:GFP fusion protein produced under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The PAS1: GFP fusion was functional, and it complemented the pas1-3 mutant (Fig. 2A). As the C-terminal region of PAS1 was required for the function of the protein, we investigated whether this region played an important role in controlling the subcellular distribution of the protein. A fusion protein consisting of the PAS1 protein deleted of the last 113 C-terminal amino acids fused to GFP was generated (PAS1ΔC:GFP). This truncated fusion protein was produced under control of the 35S promoter in Arabidopsis. This protein was correctly produced (as indicated by GFP fluorescence) but did not complement the pas1-3 mutant, demonstrating the functional importance of this C-terminal domain. The subcellular distribution of PAS1:GFP and PAS1ΔC:GFP fusion proteins was analyzed in Arabidopsis seedlings root cells. The location of PAS1:GFP was mainly in the cytosol and excluded from the nucleus, whereas PAS1ΔC:GFP was observed in both the compartments (Fig. 2B). The subcellular distribution of PAS1 was also confirmed in a different system, the tobacco BY2 cells. The PAS1:GFP fusion protein was also found in the cytosol of interphasic tobacco BY2 cells (Fig. 2C, top). However, during the exponential growth phase, during which cells were actively dividing, PAS1:GFP was occasionally detected in the nucleus (Fig. 2C, middle, arrowheads). Unlike PAS1:GFP, the PAS1ΔC:GFP fusion protein was not excluded from the nucleus and was present in the cytosol as well as the nucleus of BY2 cells, as in Arabidopsis plants (Fig. 2C, bottom). The C terminus of PAS1 therefore seems to be necessary for the nuclear exclusion of PAS1. A Member of the NAC Transcription Factor Family Interacts with the C-terminal Domain of PAS1— We used a yeast two-hybrid approach to identify proteins interacting with PAS1. We used the full-length PAS1 protein as bait and screened 16 million clones from two A. thaliana cDNA libraries. We identified seven independent clones, one of which had a sequence similar to those of the NAC family of transcription factors and was subsequently named FAN (FKBP-associated NAC). We carried out in vitro pulldown assays to confirm the results obtained with the yeast two-hybrid system. We first assessed the ability of an MBP-FAN affinity matrix to capture the streptavidin-tagged PAS1 recombinant protein (Strep-PAS1). Strep:PAS1 was captured by MBP:FAN (Fig. 3A, 1st lane) but not by the amylose beads alone (2nd lane). This interaction was further confirmed in a pulldown assay with an MBP:FAN column and crude protein extract from BY2 cells expressing the 35S-PAS1: GFP construct. PAS1:GFP bound to the MBP:FAN column but not to the maltose matrix alone (Fig. 3A, right). Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that the C terminus of PAS1 interacted most strongly with the FAN clone (data not shown). We therefore used in vitro assays to assess the involvement of the C-terminal domain of PAS1 in FAN binding. Strep:PAS1 and Strep:PAS1 deleted of the C-terminal domain (Strep-PAS1ΔC) were produced in vitro (Fig. 3B, left), and the proteins were bound to Strep-Tactin beads. MBP:FAN was retained on the Strep:PAS1 column (Fig. 3B, right, 2nd lane) but was only weakly retained on Strep:PAS1ΔC columns (Fig. 3B, right, 3rd lane) and Strep-Tactin beads alone (Fig. 3B, 1st lane). These data suggest that the C terminus of PAS1 is required for interaction with FAN. NAC transcription factors were named after the no apical meristem (NAM) protein of petunia (33Souer E. van Houwelingen A. Kloos D. Mol J. Koes R. Cell. 1996; 85: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), and the Arabidopsis ATAF1 and CUp Shape Cotyledons2 (CUC2) genes (34Aida M. Ishida T. Fukaki H. Fujisawa H. Tasaka M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 841-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). They have a characteristic conserved N-terminal domain of about 150 amino acids, defined as the NAC domain (35Ooka H. Satoh K. Doi K. Nagata T. Otomo Y. Murakami K. Matsubara K. Osato N. Kawai J. Carninci P. Hayashizaki Y. Suzuki K. Kojima K. Takahara Y. Yamamoto K. Kikuchi S. DNA Res. 2003; 10: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The clone isolated by two-hybrid screening corresponded to residues 18-239 of the At5g22290 gene. The NAC domain of the FAN protein was 85, 49, 49, 48, 46, and 41% identical to the NAC domains of NAC2, AtNAM, CUC2, NAM, NAC1, and CUC1, respectively (Fig. 3C). Computer analyses of the expression profile of FAN revealed that this gene was expressed at low but constant levels during most stages of plant development, with the exception of the final stages of seed development where FAN was highly expressed. Interestingly, pas1 mutants display major defects in embryo development (20Vittorioso P. Cowling R. Faure J.D. Caboche M. Bellini C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3034-3043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Faure J.D. Vittorioso P. Santoni V. Fraisier V. Prinsen E. Barlier I. Vanonckelen H. Caboche M. Bellini C. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 909-918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that the PAS1 and FAN genes would be coexpressed in the developing embryo. In situ hybridization confirmed that both genes were indeed expressed in the same cells of mature embryos (Fig. 3D). In Vivo Interaction between PAS1 and FAN Requires the C-terminal Domain—We then investigated whether FAN could interact with PAS1 in vivo. We first coexpressed constructs encoding PAS1:GFP and a DsRED:FAN fusion protein transiently in N. benthamiana leaves. As shown in Arabidopsis and BY2 cells, PAS1:GFP was localized in the cytoplasm of N. benthamiana epidermal cells (Fig. 3E, top). DsRED:FAN was also localized in the cytoplasm and colocalized with PAS1:GFP (Fig. 3E). Following the coexpression of PAS1ΔC::GFP and DsRED::FAN, PAS1ΔC::GFP was found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, as expected, and DsRED:FAN was detected in the cytoplasm. In contrast to what was observed with the PAS1: GFP fusion, PAS1ΔC:GFP and DsRED:FAN were seldom, if ever, colocalized. We then used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technology to demonstrate the direct interaction between PAS1 and FAN in vivo. The GFP-DsRED combination was shown previously to"

In the TEM family of Class A β-lactamases, single amino acid substitutions at Arg-244 confer resistance to clavulanate inactivation. To understand the amino acid sequence requirements in class A β-lactamases that confer resistance to clavulanate, we performed site-saturation mutagenesis of Arg-244 in SHV-1, a related class A β-lactamase found in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Twelve SHV enzymes with amino acid substitutions at Arg-244 resulted in significant increases in minimal inhibitory concentrations to ampicillin/clavulanate when expressed in Escherichia coli. Kinetic analyses of SHV-1, R244S, R244Q, R244L, and R244E β-lactamases revealed that the main determinant of clavulanate resistance was reduced inhibitor affinity. In contrast to studies in the highly similar TEM enzyme, we observed increases in clavulanate kinact for all mutants. Electrospray ionization mass spec-trometry of clavulanate inhibited SHV-1 and R244S showed nearly identical mass adducts, arguing against a difference in the inactivation mechanism. Testing a wide range of substrates with C3-4 carboxylates in different stereochemical orientations, we observed impaired affinity for all substrates among inhibitor resistant variants. Lastly, we synthesized two boronic acid transition state analogs that mimic cephalothin and found substitutions at Arg-244 markedly affect both the affinity and kinetics of binding to the chiral, deacylation transition state inhibitor. These data define a role for Arg-244 in substrate and inhibitor binding in the SHV β-lactamase.

Although this family of antibiotics now contains numerous classes (penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, see Fig. 1), their use is threatened by the expansion and spread of β-lactamase enzymes (1Thomson J.M. Bonomo R.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These bacterial enzymes hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics before reaching their target, the penicillin-binding proteins. In an effort to retain the utility of several generations of life-saving β-lactam antibiotics, β-lactamase inhibitors (clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam) have been developed. These mechanism-based inhibitors are β-lactam compounds that experience multistep reactions within the active site of β-lactamase enzymes (2Sulton D. Pagan-Rodriguez D. Zhou X. Liu Y. Hujer A.M.

Typically the inhibitors lack antimicrobial activity and are formulated with a β-lactam antibiotic to act as shields against β-lactamase enzymes. This allows the β-lactam to bypass the β-lactamase and inactivate the penicillin binding proteins. Unfortunately, inhibitor-resistant class A β-lactamases are emerging in the clinic and undermining the use of β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor therapy (5Zhou X.Y. Bordon F. Sirot D.

Interest has been renewed in the discovery of novel β-lactamase inactivators to circumvent these inhibitor-resistant enzymes (8Buynak J.D. Curr. Med.

In this context, detailed analyses of enzymes resistant to the inhibitors are needed to minimize cross-resistance and guide discovery.

A. Jacoby and K. Bush (2006) www.lahey.org/studies/webt.asp. A notable exception, however, is the absence of clinical variants with substitutions at Ambler 6The Ambler numbering system was developed to standardize the amino acid positions in Class A β-lactamases with different chain lengths. position Arg-244 in SHV compared with TEM. Arg-244 is situated at the periphery of the active site pocket in the B4 β-strand (13Ambler R.P. Coulson A.F. Frere J.M. Ghuysen J.M. Joris B. Forsman M. Levesque R.C. Tiraby G. Waley S.G. Biochem.

Although 15 distinct inhibitor-resistant TEM enzymes have been reported with substitutions at this residue, mutations at Arg-244 in SHV have not been described in clinical isolates. 5G. A. Jacoby and K. Bush (2006) www.lahey.org/studies/webt.asp. The mechanism of clavulanate resistance resulting from substitutions at position 244 in TEM was previously examined (14Delaire M. Labia R. Samama J.P. Masson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20600-20606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zafaralla G. Manavathu E.K. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S.

Structural and computational studies of TEM-1 show that Arg-244 coordinates a water molecule with the backbone carbonyl of Val-216 (10Wang X. Minasov G. Blazquez J. Caselli E. Prati F. Shoichet B.K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8434-8444Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Zafaralla G. Manavathu E.K. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S.

Soc. 1993; 115: 4435-4442Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This water molecule is postulated to play a key role in inhibitor affinity and provide the proton source essential for terminal inactivation of the enzyme (Fig. 2) (16Imtiaz U. Billings E. Knox J.R. Manavathu E.K. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4435-4442Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, the guanidinium group of Arg-244 contributes directly to substrate affinity through hydrogen bonding with the conserved β-lactam carboxylate (10Wang X. Minasov G. Blazquez J. Caselli E. Prati F. Shoichet B.K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8434-8444Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1 and 2). Inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamases with substitutions at Arg-244 exhibit reduced rates of inactivation (kinact) as well as diminished affinity for clavulanate and substrates (14Delaire M. Labia R. Samama J.P. Masson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20600-20606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Imtiaz U. Billings E. Knox J.R. Manavathu E.K. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4435-4442Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the absence of mutations identified in SHV at this position, despite heavy clinical drug pressure, is an indication of important differences in active site chemistry between the two highly similar enzymes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of multiple amino acid substitutions by site-saturation mutagenesis and characterized select SHV β-lactamases by steady-state kinetics. To compare the nature of the intermediates in the inactivation process, we incubated SHV-1 and SHV R244S, a clavulanate-resistant variant, with clavulanate and resolved the adducts by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. In addition, we studied the inhibition of several SHV β-lactamase variants at position 244 using two boronic acid transition state analogs that are chemically related to the antibiotic cephalothin (Fig. 1). Our results reveal mechanistic differences in clavulanate inactivation between SHV-1 and TEM-1 and suggest a new role for Arg-244 in SHV. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—blaSHV-1, subcloned into phagemid vector pBC SK(-) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and maintained in ElectroMAX™ DH10B™ T1R cells (Invitrogen) as previously described (17Rice L.B. Carias L.L. Hujer A.M. Bonafede M. Hutton R. Hoyen C. Bonomo R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) served as the template for all mutagenesis described herein. Site-saturation mutagenesis was performed on the blaSHV-1 construct using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and primers degenerate at Ambler position 244. Two microliters of the mutagenesis reaction was transformed into Escherichia coli DH10B electrocompetent cells (Invitrogen) and plated onto Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates using chloramphenicol (Sigma-Aldrich, 20 μg/ml) for selection. One hundred colonies were screened for mutations at amino acid position 244 by DNA sequencing with an ALF Express™ automated DNA sequencer (GE, Piscataway, NJ). The Thermo Sequenase™ fluorescence-labeled primer cycle sequencing kit was used according to the protocol provided. Special attention was given to selecting mutants with the most common codon usage in SHV-1. Because the R244K, -Met, and -Phe mutants were not obtained in the initial screen, blaSHV-1(R244K), blaSHV-1(R244M), and blaSHV-1(R244F) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, using specific mutagenic oligonucleotides as previously described (18Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M. Helfand M.S. Anderson V.E. Bonomo R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3971-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing confirmed the presence of the mutated codons as described above. Immunoblots—E. coli DH10B cells were grown to A600 = 0.8 and frozen. Twenty microliters of each culture was lysed by 10-min incubation at 100 °C in SDS loading dye buffer. Immunoblots were performed with an anti-SHV polyclonal antibody to confirm expression of full-length protein from all 20 constructs as previously described (18Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M. Helfand M.S. Anderson V.E. Bonomo R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3971-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Antibiotic Susceptibility—Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the agar dilution method, using a Steer's Replicator that delivers 104 colony forming units per 10-μl spot. Antibiotics tested include ampicillin, cephalothin, and piperacillin (all from Sigma-Aldrich) and lithium clavulanate (GlaxoSmithKline, Surrey, United Kingdom). Clavulanate susceptibility was determined in the presence of 50 μg/ml ampicillin. MIC values reported are the most frequent number observed (mode) in at least three separate experiments. Protein Expression and Purification—E. coli DH10B cells containing the blaSHV-1 and blaSHV R244S, R244Q, R244L, and R244E genes in pBC SK(-) were grown overnight in SOB medium (per liter: 20 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 0.58 g sodium chloride, 0.19 g potassium chloride (Fisher Scientific)) harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, and frozen. β-Lactamase was liberated using stringent periplasmic fractionation with 40 μg/ml lysozyme and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8. Preparative isoelectric focusing was performed with the lysate in a Sephadex granulated gel using ampholines in the pH range of 3.5-10 (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (19Lin S. Thomas M. Shlaes D.M. Rudin S.D. Knox J.R. Anderson V. Bonomo R.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The protein was eluted and dialyzed with 20 mm diethanolamine buffer, pH 8.5. Protein concentration was assessed by Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin standards. Purity of >95% was determined using 10% SDS-PAGE. Kinetics—Kinetic constants of the β-lactamases chosen for study (SHV-1, R244S, R244Q, R244L, and R244E) were measured by continuous assays at room temperature, 25 °C, using a diode array spectrophotometer (Model 8453, Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). Each assay was performed in 20 mm phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4. Measurements were obtained using nitrocefin (BD Biosciences) (Δϵ482 = 17,400 m-1 cm-1) and ampicillin (Δϵ482 =-900 m-1 cm-1). The kinetic parameters, Vmax and Km, were obtained with non-linear least squares fit of the data (Equation 1) using Origin 7.5®.v=(Vmax×[S])/(Km+[S]) The dissociation constants of the pre-acylation complex (Kd) were determined by direct competition with the indicator substrate nitrocefin for the β-lactams (cephalothin, piperacillin, and meropenem). The Ki values for the inhibitors (clavulanic acid and the boronic acid inhibitors, compounds 1 and 2) were also determined by direct competition, because kinact/Ki was <<1. Enzyme concentrations for these experiments were adjusted so that an initial rate of nitrocefin hydrolysis between 1 and 1.5 μm/s in the absence of inhibitor was achieved. Final concentrations were 7 nm (SHV-1), 10.5 nm (R244Q), 21 nm (R244S and R244L), and 105 nm (R244E). Nitrocefin concentrations equal to the Km (Table 2) were used for all experiments, except for R244L in which 200 μm was used due to absorbance limitations. The data were analyzed according to Equation 2 to determine Ki,i=[I]/[I]+Ki(1+([S]/Km)))TABLE 2Kinetic properties of SHV-1 and variants at Arg-244 for clavulanate, ampicillin, and nitrocefinSHV-1R244SR244QR244LR244EClavulanateKi (μM)1 ± 0.0463 ± 385 ± 7360 ± 201000 ± 150kinact (s−1)0.04 ± 0.0020.09 ± 0.0050.09 ± 0.0070.11 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.008kinact/Ki (μM−1 s−1)0.04 ± 0.0030.0014 ± 0.00010.0011 ± 0.00010.00031 ± 0.000030.00008 ± 0.00001kcat/kinact60 ± 1050 ± 10180 ± 10550 ± 3055 ± 10kcat (s−1)2.4 ± 0.44.5 ± 0.919 ± 261 ± 64.4 ± 0.9AmpicillinKm (μM)165 ± 10255 ± 451190 ± 1202240 ± 5903500 ± 1800kcat (s−1)3700 ± 400390 ± 501400 ± 160800 ± 170115 ± 50kcat/Km (μM−1 s−1)22 ± 31.5 ± 0.31.2 ± 0.20.4 ± 0.10.03 ± 0.02NitrocefinKm (μM)21 ± 355 ± 4110 ± 9590 ± 30250 ± 10kcat (s−1)290 ± 32107 ± 11270 ± 30230 ± 2020 ± 2kcat/Km (μM−1 s−1)14 ± 2.52 ± 0.252.4 ± 0.30.4 ± 0.040.08 ± 0.009 Open table in a new tab where i = fraction of enzyme inhibited, [S] = nitrocefin concentration, [I] = inhibitor concentration, and Km refers to the Km value of the enzyme for nitrocefin (20Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12292) Google Scholar). The first-order rate constant for enzyme and inhibitor complex inactivation, kinact, was measured directly by monitoring the reaction time courses in the presence of clavulanate. A fixed concentration of enzyme and nitrocefin, and increasing concentrations of clavulanate ([I]), were used in each assay. The kobs for inactivation was determined graphically by Equation 3,A=vf×t+(v0-vf)×(1-e(-kobs×t))/kobs+A0 where A = absorbance, t = time (seconds), vf = final reaction velocity, v0 = the initial reaction velocity in the first 5 s, and A0 = the initial absorbance. Each kobs was plotted versus [I] and fit to Equation 4 to determine kinact.kobs=kinact[I]/(Ki+[I]) The partitioning of the initial enzyme inhibitor complex between hydrolysis and enzyme inactivation (kcat/kinact) was obtained in the following manner. First, we incubated increasing amounts of clavulanate with a fixed concentration of β-lactamase in a total volume of 40 μl of 20 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at room temperature. After 24 h, the sample was added to a 1-ml cuvette containing phosphate-buffered saline and nitrocefin (see above), and initial rates of hydrolysis were assessed. The proportion of clavulanic acid relative to enzyme that resulted in ≥90% inactivation after 24 h was the kcat/kinact for the enzyme. Ki values for the boronic acid compounds were determined as described above. However, because of time-dependant inactivation, enzyme and the boronic acid compound 2 were preincubated for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline before initiating the reaction with the addition of substrate (10Wang X. Minasov G. Blazquez J. Caselli E. Prati F. Shoichet B.K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8434-8444Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Chen Y. Shoichet B. Bonnet R. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 2006; 128: 2970-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Timed inactivation experiments were also performed with clavulanate and the boronic acid compound 2. To control for the difference in affinities, Ki concentrations of inhibitor were used in each assay. Enzyme and inhibitor were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline for a range of time points before the reaction was initiated by nitrocefin (see above for enzyme and nitrocefin concentrations). Mass Spectrometry—For intact protein mass spectrometry, 40 μm of SHV-1 or R244S were incubated for 15 min with and without the addition of 40 mm lithium clavulanate. Each reaction was terminated by the addition of 1:10 volume of 1% trifluoroacetic acid and immediately desalted and concentrated using a C4 ZipTip® (Millipore, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were then placed on ice and analyzed within 2 h. Spectra of the intact SHV-1 and SHV R244S proteins were generated on an Applied Biosystems (Framingham, MA) Q-STAR XL quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray source. Experiments were performed by diluting the protein sample with acetonitrile/1% formic acid to a concentration of 10 μm. This protein solution was then infused at a rate of 0.5 μl/min, and data were collected for 2 min. Spectra were deconvoluted using the Applied Biosystems (Framingham, MA) Analyst program. Synthesis of Boronic Acid Inhibitors—1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX-200 or Avance 400 spectrometer; chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million (ppm) downfield from tetramethyl silane (TMS) as internal standard (s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br, broad signal); coupling constants (J) are given in hertz. Mass fragmentations were determined on a Finnigan MAT SSQ A mass spectrometer (electron impact (EI), 70 eV). Optical rotations were recorded at 20 °C on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences polarimeter, and specific rotations are given in 10-1 deg cm2 g-1. All reactions requiring anhydrous conditions were performed under argon using oven-dried glassware. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried according to classic procedures and distilled from sodium/benzophenone before use. Chromatographic purification of the compounds was accomplished on silica gel (0.05-0.20 mm). 3-Ethoxycarbonylphenylboronic acid and (+)-(1S,2S,3R,5S)-pinanediol (enantiomeric excess > 98%) were purchased from Aldrich. Synthesis of the achiral cephalothin boronic acid transition state inhibitor 1 was performed as previously described (23Caselli E. Powers R.A. Blasczcak L.C. Wu C.Y. Prati F. Shoichet B.K. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 17-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Enantioselective synthesis of the chiral cephalothin boronic acid transition state inhibitor 2 was performed as follows (Fig. 3) (11Morandi F. Caselli E. Morandi S. Focia P.J. Blazquez J. Shoichet B.K. Prati F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 685-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). (+)-Pinanediol 3-(Ethoxycarbonyl)phenylboronate (+)-(3)—Phenylboronic acid (1,250 g, 6.44 mm) and (+)-pinanediol (1.100 g, 6.44 mm) were dissolved in anhydrous THF (8 ml). The mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature and concentrated in vacuo.

Separated by ∼10 kb on chromosome 6, the coding sequences of RNases A-1 and A-2 are diverging under positive selection pressure (dN > dS) but remain similar to one another (81% amino acid identity) and to the mammalian angiogenins. Immunoreactive RNases A-1 and A-2 (both ∼16 kDa) were detected in peripheral blood granulocytes and bone marrow. Recombinant proteins are ribonucleolytically active (kcat = 2.6 and 0.056 s-1, respectively), and surprisingly, both interact with human placental ribonuclease inhibitor. RNase A-2, the more cationic (pI 11.0), is both angiogenic and bactericidal; RNase A-1 (pI 10.2) has neither activity. We demonstrated via point mutation of the catalytic His110 that ablation of ribonuclease activity has no impact on the bactericidal activity of RNase A-2. We determined that the divergent domains II (amino acids 71-76) and III (amino acids 89-104) of RNase A-2 are both important for bactericidal activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these cationic domains can function as independent bactericidal peptides without the tertiary structure imposed by the RNase A backbone. These results suggest that ribonucleolytic activity may not be a crucial constraint limiting the ongoing evolution of this gene family and that the ribonuclease backbone may be merely serving as a scaffold to support the evolution of novel, nonribonucleolytic proteins.

The RNase A ribonuclease gene family has been a tremendous source of information on unusual evolutionary constraints and their effects on protein structure and function at the molecular level. Although RNase A ribonucleases maintain invariant disulfide bonds and catalytic components that are necessary for RNA degradation, other regions have diverged dramatically. RNase A ribonucleases have been implicated in a wide variety of physiologic functions and have been observed to promote angiogenesis, cellular apoptosis, and anti-tumor and anti-pathogen host defense via a complex array of seemingly unrelated molecular mechanisms (reviewed in Refs. 1Matousek J.

The specific patterns of diversification are best understood among the RNase A ribonucleases of mammalian species. Four major RNase A lineages have been described in mammals (6Beintema J.J. Kleineidam R.G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) as follows: the pancreatic RNases, or RNases 1, which include the prototype, bovine pancreatic RNase A; a second group, including the eosinophil ribonucleases EDN (RNases 2), ECP (RNases 3), and RNases 6, 7, and 8; a third group that includes the RNases 4; and a final group that includes the angiogenins (RNases 5). There are also several genes, such as RNases 9-13 in the human genome, that are distantly related to the RNase A family based on amino acid sequence homology but that are missing one or more elements necessary for enzymatic activity (9Penttinen J.

Interestingly, not all RNase A lineages are found in every mammalian species, and there are some recently described mammalian RNase A ribonucleases that cannot be clearly assigned to a specific lineage or group (14Cho S. Zhang J. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 373: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, the nonmammalian RNase A ribonucleases have not been as clearly defined.

Likewise, the physiologic activities of many of these nonmammalian ribonucleases remain unexplored. Given our ongoing interest in the role of RNase A ribonucleases in promoting host defense (5Dyer K.D. Rosenberg H.F. Molecular Divers. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), in this work we explore the biologic activity and structure-function relationships of two closely related leukocyte-associated ribonucleases from the chicken, G. gallus. Chicken RNase A/angiogenin, named for structural similarity, as opposed to functional analysis, was identified by Nakano and Graf (20Nakano T. Graf T.

Genomics. 2005; 85: 208-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) performed an exhaustive search of the recently published chicken genome and have concluded that there are only three RNase A ribonucleases, the two leukocyte-associated RNases on chromosome 6 and a more distantly related sequence on chromosome 4. In this study, we isolated two cDNAs from chicken bone marrow and generated specific antibodies that enabled us to localize these leukocyte-associated RNases in peripheral blood granulocytes. We also characterized novel biologic function for these proteins, performed structure-function analysis, and identified unique domains that contributed independently to bactericidal and ribonucleolytic activities. Further studies on the surprising independent function of these peptide domains have led us to reconsider some long held assumptions regarding evolutionary diversity and RNase A ribonuclease genes. Isolation of Leukocytes from Bone Marrow—Bone marrow cells were collected from femurs and tibiae of White Leghorn chickens (Gallus gallus) by flushing sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) through opened bones. Cells were washed twice with PBS, and red blood cells were lysed by incubation with ACK lysing buffer (Cambrex Bio Science, Walkersville, MD) for 5 min. The cells were subsequently washed again with PBS and counted with a hemocytometer. Viability was assessed by trypan blue staining. Isolation of Leukocytes from Peripheral Blood—Leukocytes were separated from peripheral blood according to the methods described previously (26Rath N.C. Huff G.R. Balog J.M. Huff W.E. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1998; 64: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Seo S.H. Pei J. Briles W.E. Dzielawa J. Collisson E.W. Virology. 2000; 269: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Heparinized peripheral blood was collected by cardiac puncture and then mixed with a 3% dextran solution. Red blood cells were sedimented, and the leukocyte-rich supernatant (buffy coat) was collected by centrifugation at 400 × g, washed twice with PBS, and separated into phases via Lymphocyte Separation Medium (density,1.077-1.080 g/ml at 20 °C; Mediatech, Herndon, VA) at 400 × g for 30 min at room temperature. Cells sedimenting at the base of the tube were collected as the granulocyte fraction. Red blood cells were eliminated by ACK lysing buffer, and cell number and viability were evaluated as described above. Preparation of Cell Lysates—Isolated bone marrow cells or peripheral blood leukocytes (2 × 106 cells/100 μl) were mixed with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and left on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was collected and stored at -80 °C prior to use. Preparation of RNA from Bone Marrow Cells—One ml of RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) was added to each aliquot of 2 × 106 cells (15-25 × 106 cells total). Chloroform was added (1:10 (v/v)), and the samples were mixed thoroughly and incubated on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation at 13,600 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the aqueous layer was transferred to fresh tubes. Equal volumes of ice-cold isopropyl alcohol were added, and RNA was precipitated at -20 °C, harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in 80% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. RNA was quantitated spectrophotometrically. Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5′- and 3′-RACE)— cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA from G. gallus bone marrow RNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase as per the manufacturer's instructions (SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit, Clontech) and then amplified using specific oligonucleotides for chicken leukocyte RNase A-1 (previously identified as angiogenin/RNase (20Nakano T.

The PCR conditions were as follows: 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s followed by 72 °C for 3 min, then 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s followed by 70 °C for 30 s and followed by 72 °C for 3 min, and finally 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, followed by 68 °C for 30 s, and followed by 72 °C for 3 min. The amplified PCR fragments were gel-purified (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA) and subcloned into the pCR2.1 (Invitrogen); multiple colonies were sequenced in both directions. The sequences were assembled using Sequencher 4.1 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, MI) to obtain the full-length cDNA sequence. To amplify the two chicken leukocyte RNases (minus signal sequences), the following primers were used: 5′-aagcttctGTTCCAACCTACCAAGATTTTTTG-3′ and 5′-gaattcTGGAAAGGTGCCATCCAGATGCAC-3′ for leukocyte RNase A-1 and 5′-aagcttctGTTCCAACCTACCAAGATTTTTTG-3′ and 5′-gaattcTGGAGAGGTGCCATCCAGATGCACAGGAAGCCCTCCCCG-3′ for leukocyte RNase A-2 (lowercase letters indicate restriction sites added to facilitate subcloning). PCR with Pfx DNA polymerase was performed under the following conditions: an initial denaturation step of 94 °C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min. PCR product was subcloned into pCR-Blunt vectors (Invitrogen) as described above. Sequence Analysis—Automated DNA sequencing was performed using an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and a DYEnamic ET terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Sequence analyses were performed with the assistance of Sequencher 4.1 (Ann Arbor, MI). Production of Recombinant Chicken Leukocyte RNases A-1 and A-2—Recombinant chicken RNase proteins were prepared in Escherichia coli BL21 strain using the pFLAG-CTS expression vector (Sigma), which utilizes an isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible promoter, an amino-terminal bacterial OmpA secretion piece and a carboxyl-terminal FLAG tag. This expression system has been used extensively for expression of recombinant RNase A ribonucleases (28Rosenberg H.F. J. Biol.

Site-directed Mutagenesis—Chicken ribonucleases with exchanged domains were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primers used to effect site-specific mutations are shown in Table 1. Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.

Purity of peptides was confirmed as >95% by mass spectrometry. Antibodies to G. gallus leukocyte RNases A-1 and A-2 were prepared by immunization of rabbits with 10 mg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated sequence-specific peptides: A-1, H2N-QPNRALRTTQQQLP-COOH and A-2, H2N-DQALRTTRRHFRIT-COOH (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Immunoblotting—Bone marrow lysates and peripheral granulocyte lysates from G. gallus and recombinant FLAG-tagged chicken RNases were mixed with a reducing Tris-glycine 2× SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and subjected to SDS-PAGE (14% acrylamide, 1× Tris-glycine system). After proteins in-gel were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen), nonspecific binding to the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, prior to probing the membrane with a 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-leukocyte RNase A-1, 1:200 rabbit anti-leukocyte RNase A-2, or 1:200 mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad). The membranes were developed with AP conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunostaining of G. gallus Leukocytes and Observation under Confocal Microscopy—One million cells were isolated as described and washed with 3 ml of 1% BSA in PBS (BSA/PBS) and then fixed and permeabilized by FIX & PERM (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Primary antibody was used at 1:100 and consisted of anti-leukocyte RNase A-1 or anti-leukocyte RNase A-2. Preimmune serum was used as a control for background staining. After an overnight incubation in primary antibody at 4 °C, the cells were washed in BSA/PBS, and a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (BD Biosciences), was applied at a 1:100 dilution. After a 1-h incubation in the dark at room temperature, the cells were washed, and the nuclear stain, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), was added at 1 μg/ml and incubated for 15 min in the dark. The cells were washed two times in BSA/PBS and then fixed onto glass slide using cytofunnels (Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA). Coverslips were attached after the addition of the ProLong antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Slides were stored in dark at 4 °C until imaging. Images were collected on a TCS-SP2 AOBS confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany) using a ×63 oil immersion objective NA 1.32 at different zoom factors. The confocal pinhole was set to 0.9 Airy units to ensure maximum resolution. FITC was excited using an argon laser at 488 nm, and DAPI, nuclear stain, was excited using an argon laser (Enterprise model 651, Coherent, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) at 364 nm. Differential interference contrast images were collected simultaneously with the fluorescence images using the transmitted light detector. The settings were adjusted on a preimmune slide for each cell type and were not changed for images collected with relevant primary antibody. Ribonuclease Assays—The ribonuclease (RNase) assay with yeast tRNA substrate has been described in detail elsewhere (29Rosenberg H.F. Dyer K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21539-21544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this study, 10 μl of a 20 mg/ml solution of yeast tRNA, polyuridylic acid (poly(U)), polyadenylic acid (poly(A)), polycytidylic acid (poly(C)), polyguanylic acid (poly(G)), or polyinosinic acid (poly(I)) (Sigma) was added to 800 μl of 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing recombinant FLAG-tagged chicken RNase protein. In experiments in which the pH optimum was to be determined, 40 mm sodium phosphate buffers of pH 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.4, or 8.0 were used instead of the buffer of pH 7.0. In some experiments, 200 units of human placental RNase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) were added prior to the addition of the tRNA substrate. Conversion of A260 per unit time to pmol/s was performed as described previously (29Rosenberg H.F. Dyer K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21539-21544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), based on the following conversion factors: the average molecular weight of a molecule of tRNA is 28,100 (75-90 ribonucleotides/tRNA molecule × 341 Mr per ribonucleotide) with an A260 of 1.0 corresponding to 40 μg of RNA. Angiogenesis Assay—The chick aortic ring sprouting assay was performed as described previously (33Clement P.M. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Wolff E.C. Kleinman H.K. Park M.H. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 100: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Aortic arches were dissected from 13-day-old chicken embryos, cleaned free of unwanted tissue, and cut into 0.8-mm slices. Each ring was transferred into the center of a 96-well plate. 10 μl of ice-cold Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was added immediately to embed the ring. After the Matrigel was solidified, 100 μl of human endothelial SFM basal growth medium (Invitrogen) was added to each well. After addition of recombinant leukocyte RNase A-1 or RNase A-2 or control preparation, the rings were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Vessels sprouted from rings were observed under microscopy and assessed by blinded observers. Each groups composed of 6-8 rings. Bactericidal Assays—Bactericidal assays were performed as described previously with modifications (28Rosenberg H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7876-7881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl from a single bacterial colony of overnight culture grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth was diluted 1:100 in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 1 ml of sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Ten microliters of bacteria in buffer are incubated for 4 h at 37°C with 10 μl of recombinant protein or peptide at the concentrations indicated or diluent control and were then diluted 10-, 100-, or 1000-fold prior to plating on LB agar for overnight growth for colony counts. All points were determined in triplicate. Phylogenetic Analysis—Sequence data were analyzed using algorithms included in the MEGA program (34Kumar S. Tamura K. Jakobsen I.B. Nei M. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 1244-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (4549) Google Scholar), which is available on line. Sequences were aligned using ClustalW for import into MEGA. All sequence data are available on line at the GenBank™ or NCBI data bases.

Statistical Analysis—Data are shown as the mean ± S.E. for the numbers of samples. The Student's t test was performed for statistical analysis of the differences between the groups. RNase A Ribonucleases in the Genome of the Domestic Chicken, G. gallus—Three RNase A ribonucleases have been identified in the genome of the chicken, G. gallus (11Cho S. Beintema J.J. Zhang J. Genomics. 2005; 85: 208-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). An unrooted neighbor-joining tree (Fig. 1) comparing these three chicken sequences to other known nonmammalian and mammalian RNase A ribonucleases indicate the following: 1) these three sequences are most closely related to one another; 2) they are more closely related to the other known nonmammalian RNase A ribonucleases than to any of the mammalian superfamily members; and 3) together, the nonmammalian RNase superfamily members are most closely related to the mammalian angiogenin lineage, which, as noted by Cho et al. (11Cho S. Beintema J.J. Zhang J. Genomics. 2005; 85: 208-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), likely represents the ancestral structural subtype of this superfamily. We have re-isolated full-length cDNAs of the two chicken leukocyte RNases by reverse transcription-PCR from RNA prepared from the bone marrow of White Leghorn chickens (G. gallus) and have deposited sequences into GenBank™ as chicken leukocyte RNase A-1 (DQ395275) and chicken leukocyte RNase A-2 (DQ395276). These sequences share 93% nucleotide sequence identity to one another and are identical to RNase A/angiogenin (19Costanzi J. Sidransky D. Navon A. Goldsweig H. Cancer Investig. 2005; 23: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and RSFR (20Nakano T. Graf T. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 527-534PubMed Google Scholar), respectively; the new names are more consistent with current RNase A family nomenclature and make no specific assumptions vis à vis gene function. The chicken leukocyte RNase A-1 and A-2 map to chromosome 6 (GenBank™ NW_060392) is separated by only 10 kb. The signal sequences are 100% identical; the ratio of rates of nonsynonymous (dN = n/n = 0.095) to synonymous (dS = s/S = 0.055) substitution calculated for the mature coding sequence is >1.0 (dN/dS = 1.73), suggesting divergence by positive (Darwinian) selection. Detection and Characterization of Leukocyte RNases A-1 and A-2 in Bone Marrow and Peripheral Blood Granulocytes—The amino acid sequences of leukocyte RNases A-1 and A-2 are shown in Fig. 2A. The sequences are shown without the encoded 23-amino acid signal sequences. The amino termini were determined by direct analogy with the amino terminus of the paralogous chicken RNase CL2 (GenBank™ accession number AAB28438), which was determined by Irie and co-workers (22Hayano K. Iwama M. Sakamoto H. Watanabe H. Sanda A. Ohgi K. Irie M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) directly from the protein sequence. The amino acid sequences (without signal sequences) of RNase A-1 and A-2 are 81% identical, although the isoelectric point of leukocyte RNase A-1 is 10.2 and that of RNase A-2 is 11.0; the divergence is because of the extra arginines (10 versus 14) in the RNase A-2 sequence. Each sequence includes canonical features of the RNase A superfamily, including six cysteines (characteristic of the angiogenin-type RNase A r"

Par-1, a homologue of MARK in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, is essential for the development of embryonic polarity. Four isoforms of MARK are found in humans. Recently, we reported the crystal structure of the catalytic and ubiquitin-associated domains of MARK2, an isoform enriched in brain (Panneerselvam, S., Marx, A., Mandelkow, E.-M., and Mandelkow, E. (2006) Structure 14, 173-183). It showed that the ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA) domain has an unusual fold and binds to the N-terminal lobe of the catalytic domain. This is at variance with a previous low resolution structure derived from small angle solution scattering (Jaleel, M., Villa, F., Deak, M., Toth, R., Prescott, A. R., Van Aalten, D. M., and Alessi, D. R. (2006) Biochem. J. 394, 545-555), which predicts binding of the UBA domain to the larger, C-terminal lobe. Here we report the crystal structure of the catalytic and UBA domain of another isoform, MARK1. Although the crystal packing of the two isoforms are unrelated, the overall conformations of the molecules are similar. Notably, the UBA domain has the same unusual conformation as in MARK2, and it binds at the same site. Remarkable differences occur in the catalytic domain at helix C, the catalytic loop, and the activation segment.

Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of tau and other microtubule-associated proteins (MAP2, MAP4) at the KXGS motifs by MARK reduces the affinity to microtubules and leads to microtubule disassembly. Hyperphosphorylation of tau followed by aggregation to paired helical filaments is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer disease. MARK orthologues KIN1 in fission yeast and Par-1 in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans are involved in the development of cell polarity (2Munro E.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3Pellettieri J. Seydoux G. Science. 2002; 298: 1946-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In neurons, MARK is required for neurite outgrowth and differentiation (4Biernat J. Wu Y.Z. Timm T. Zheng-Fischhofer Q. Mandelkow E. Meijer L. Mandelkow E.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4013-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). There are four isoforms of MARK in the human kinome that form a subfamily of the Snf1/AMP-activated protein kinase family of kinases within the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase group (5Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6256) Google Scholar). MARK kinases are relatively large; the longest isoform, MARK1, comprises 795 amino acids (Fig. 1). The catalytic domain is flanked by an N-terminal header of about 60 amino acids and a linker of about 20 amino acids that includes a four-residue motif (adjacent to the catalytic domain) that may serve as a common docking site (CD domain) for regulatory binding partners in analogy to MAP kinases (6Tanoue T. Nishida E. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The linker connects the catalytic domain to a bona fide UBA (ubiquitin-Associated) domain, a globular domain of 40 amino acids consisting of three α-helices. The UBA domain is followed by a long spacer and a globular tail (NMR structure, see Protein Data Bank code 1UL7) that comprises the KA1 domain (kinases-associated domain 1) with the characteristic ELKL motif at the C terminus. The functions of the putative UBA and KA1 domains are not well understood. The fact that most of the AMP-activated protein kinase-related kinases, including the yeast homologue Snf1, possess a UBA or UBA-like domain (7Beullens M. Vancauwenbergh S. Morrice N. Derua R.

Like many other kinases, MARK is regulated by phosphorylation of the activation loop (T-loop). MARKK/TAO-1 (9Timm T. Li X.Y. Biernat J. Jiao J. Mandelkow E. Vandekerckhove J. Mandelkow E.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5090-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and the tumor suppressor kinase LKB1/Par-4 (10Brajenovic M. Joberty G. Kuster B. Bouwmeester T. Drewes G. J. Biol.

A fraction of MARK isolated from brain tissue is doubly phosphorylated at Thr-208 and Ser-212 (MARK2 numbering used throughout); phosphorylation of the second site, however, is inhibitory (9Timm T. Li X.Y. Biernat J. Jiao J. Mandelkow E. Vandekerckhove J. Mandelkow E.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5090-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). There are a number of other mechanisms that seem to be able to regulate MARK, including phosphorylation of the spacer by atypical protein kinase C (12Hurov J.B. Watkins J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 736-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 13Suzuki A. Hirata M. Kamimura K. Maniwa R. Yamanaka T. Mizuno K. Kishikawa M. Hirose H. Amano Y. Izumi N.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4190-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Benton R. Palacios I.M. St. Johnston D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 659-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) or to PAK5, a member of the family of p21-activated kinases (16Matenia D. Griesshaber B. Li X.Y. Thiessen A. Johne C. Jiao J. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4410-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the MARK2 catalytic domain in combination with the UBA domain suggested a role of the latter in regulation of the enzyme (17Panneerselvam S. Marx A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Structure. 2006; 14: 173-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain seems to be locked in an open, inactive conformation through the action of the UBA domain, which while being tethered via an extended linker to the C terminus of the catalytic domain binds firmly to the N-terminal lobe (N-lobe). According to the crystal structures of MARK2, localization of the UBA domain (to the N-lobe) is directly opposite to a model derived from solution x-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments (8Jaleel M. Villa F. Deak M. Toth R. Prescott A.R. Van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Another surprising result was that the UBA domain adopts an unusual fold in the MARK2 crystals, raising the question of whether the unexpected conformation and localization of the UBA domain could be a crystal packing artifact rather than an intrinsic property of the kinase. To answer this question, we determined the structure of the MARK1 isoform (catalytic and UBA domains). The two MARK isoforms differ by about 40 amino acids, half of them concentrated in the UBA domain. In addition, we measured the kinase activities of MARK constructs with and without UBA domain and compared the crystal structure with the conformation in solution by means of SAXS experiments. The crystal structure of MARK1 reveals significant differences in the conformation of the catalytic domain, especially in the catalytic loop and the activation segment. However, the overall arrangement of domains, including position and fold of the UBA domain, is the same for both isoforms. Biochemical assays showed that removal of the UBA domain has only a limited effect on the kinase activity in vitro, arguing against the alleged regulatory function. Nevertheless, the UBA domain could still play an important role in the regulation of MARK activity or in localization, assuming that it provides an additional template for the interaction with other binding partners. The results of the SAXS experiments are consistent with the crystal structures, indicating that the overall conformation observed in solution and in the crystals is the same. Protein Preparation and Crystallization—Fragments of MARK1 from human (GenBank™ accession number Q9P0L2) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 AI (Invitrogen) by using the manufacturer's protocol. The MARK1 fragment Asn-45—Lys-371 described here is similar to the MARK2 fragment Asn-39—Lys-364 (17Panneerselvam S. Marx A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Structure. 2006; 14: 173-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which was identified by limited proteolysis. The MARK fragments without the UBA domain range from Asn-45 to Asp-329 (MARK1) and Asn-39 to Lys-324 (MARK2). By sequence alignment, MARK1 has a single, one-residue insert (Thr-51) relative to MARK2. Residue ranges Asn-45—Ala-50 and Asp-52—Lys-371 of MARK1 correspond to Asn-39—Ala-44 and Asp-45—Lys-364 in MARK2. In the following we use the residue numbers based on the MARK2 sequence for both isoforms. The constructs include an N-terminal glycine left over from tobacco etch virus protease cleavage of a His6 or His10 tag. All proteins were prepared as described (9Timm T. Li X.Y. Biernat J. Jiao J.

Structure. 2006; 14: 173-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Crystals of MARK1 were grown by vapor diffusion by mixing 2 μl of protein (20 mg/ml) with 2 μl of a reservoir solution containing 7-10% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 m Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 0.2 m ammonium citrate at 4 °C. For SAXS analysis 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) was added during the purification procedure, and fresh DTT was added to a final concentration of 2 mm just before the SAXS measurement. Kinase Assays—The kinase assays were performed essentially as described (1Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5090-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Kinase activity was determined with respect to the tau-derived peptide TR1, NVKSKIGSTENLK, which contains Ser-262 (underlined), the primary phosphorylation site of tau by MARK kinases. The kinases were activated by MARKK/TAO-1 as described (9Timm T. Li X.Y. Biernat J. Jiao J. Mandelkow E. Vandekerckhove J. Mandelkow E.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5090-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which phosphorylates a critical threonine (Thr-208) in the activation loop of MARK kinases. Crystal Data Collection, Phasing, and Model Building—X-ray data were collected at the X13 Consortium beamline at DESY, Hamburg. Crystals were flash-frozen at 100 K in cold nitrogen. The HKL data processing system V1.97.2 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 276: Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar) was used for data reduction and analysis (Table 1). MARK1 crystallized in space group P212121 with 8 molecules per asymmetric unit (Matthews coefficient 3.06). The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the catalytic domain of MARK2 as search model, using Phaser Version 1.2 (19Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). To reduce model bias, a composite omit map was calculated with CNS 1.1 (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr D. Biol.

The final model contained 2417 of 2624 residues in 8 independent molecules plus 210 water molecules. The model was checked with PROCHECK (23Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J.

Bordas J. Nucl. Instrum. Methods. 1983; 208: 461-469Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar) using a MAR345 image plate detector. The scattering patterns were measured with a 3-min exposure time for multiple solute concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 6 mg/ml. To check for radiation damage, two 2-min exposures were compared; no radiation effects were observed. Using the sample-detector distance of 2.7 m, the range of momentum transfer 0.09 < s < 0.5 Å-1 was covered (s = 4π sin(θ)/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ = 1.5 Å is the x-ray wavelength). The data were processed using standard procedures and extrapolated to infinite dilution by the program package PRI-MUS (26Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2357) Google Scholar). The forward scattering I(0) and the radii of gyration Rg were evaluated using the Guinier approximation (27Guinier A. Ann. Phys. (Paris). 1939; 12: 161-237Google Scholar) assuming that at very small angles (s < 1.3/Rg) the intensity is represented as I(s) = I(0)exp(-(sRg)2/3). The maximum dimensions Dmax and the interatomic distance distribution functions p(r) were computed using the indirect transform package GNOM (28Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2969) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of the solutes were evaluated by comparison of the forward scattering with that from a reference solution of bovine serum albumin (molecular masses = 66 kDa). The scattering from the high resolution models of MARK isoforms in the crystal was computed using the program CRYSOL (29Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2778) Google Scholar). Given the atomic coordinates, the program fits the experimental intensity by adjusting the excluded volume of the particle and the contrast of the hydration layer to minimize the discrepancy,χ2=1N-1∑jIexp(Sj)-clcalc(Sj)σ(Sj)2 where N is the number of experimental points, c is a scaling factor, Iexp(sj) and Icalc(sj) are the experimentally determined and calculated intensities, respectively, and σ(sj) is the experimental error at the momentum transfer sj. General Organization of the MARK1 Crystal Structure—MARK1 crystallized in space group P212121 with eight molecules per asymmetric unit. The packing of the molecules is completely different from that of MARK2 molecules in the crystal form described previously (17Panneerselvam S. Marx A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Structure. 2006; 14: 173-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the MARK1 crystal, the molecules do not form symmetric dimers, as in the case of MARK2. The packing can be described by assuming two lozenge-shaped “tetramers” bent across the short diagonal (molecules A, B, C, D and molecules E, F, G, H). Moreover, contacts between UBA domains of different tetramers are essential for the packing of the MARK1 tetramers (Fig. 2). Yet the general fold and organization of the subdomains of the individual molecules is the same as that of MARK2. The UBA domain has the same fold as observed for MARK2, with the third helix pointing in the opposite direction compared with UBA domains of other proteins. Furthermore, the UBA domain of MARK1 binds at the same site as in MARK2, at the N-lobe and on the back side of the active site. Conformational Variability of MARK1 Molecules—Although the general fold of the eight molecules in the MARK1 crystal is the same, different environments in the crystal lead to local and global variations. Because of this variability, non-crystallographic symmetry was not used for structure determination (except for the very first steps of refinement) at the expense of some parts of the molecules not being modeled. The following residues are not included in the final model (as deposited in the PDB): Ann-A45, A204-A212, Bnn-B46, B204-B212, Cnn-C47, C203-C210, Dnn-D45, D202-D230, D253-D257, D290-D291, D308-D311, Enn-E46, Fnn-F46, Gnn-G47, G203-G211, G219-G227, G290-G291, Hnn-H46, H203-H227, H252-H267 (nn, N terminus; numbering is according to MARK2; add +7 to convert to the MARK1 sequence numbering in the entire range of residues that are visible in the MARK1 crystal structure, i.e. except the N-terminal part that is missing in the structure model). Molecules E and F are almost complete; only 10 residues at the N terminus are missing. Most affected by disorder are molecules D, G, and H. In molecule H, for instance, the C-terminal half of the activation loop and the following sequence up to the start of helix F is not modeled as well as helix G and residues of the preceding loop. For a large part of the missing regions, electron density in the 2Fo - Fc map indicates the general trace of the polypeptide chain; these parts, however, were not included in the final model since completion of the model did not appreciably improve the quality of the model (by R factors and geometry). For the sake of clarity, some of the figures show such additional parts of the molecules (as indicated in the legends) using a more complete model. Because these regions are close to cavities in the crystal packing, the poor electron density is attributed to conformational disorder and multiple conformations with partial overlap. Omission of the doubtful regions in the final model may underline the fact that the observed variability reflects a property of the crystal structure and is not due to limitations of the data set. For comparison of different molecules, a hierarchical approach for describing the variability seems appropriate; at the top level the molecules are considered as consisting of three subdomains, N-lobe, C-lobe, and UBA domain, appearing as rigid bodies in first approximation. Least square superpositions of the molecules using each of the three subdomains in turn reveals (i) the displacement of the free subdomains relative to the fixed one and (ii) the conformational variation within the fixed subdomain across the ensemble of the eight molecules (Fig. 3). For superpositions and calculation of relative displacements, it is convenient to define “core” structural elements for the N- and the C-lobe that may serve as a reference. Residues 52-84 (comprising β strands 1, 2, and 3) are chosen as the reference for the N-lobe, and residues 151-168 and 231-243 (helices E and F) for the C-lobe. Because of its small size and low variability, there is no need to select a core reference structure in the case of the UBA domain (residues 323-362). Superposition of the molecules using any one of the subdomains (Fig. 3, a-c) as reference reveals considerable movements relative to each other. With the N-lobe fixed, the C-lobe rotates by up to 10°, which results in a shift at the distal parts of about 7-8 Å (Fig. 3a). Movement of the UBA domain relative to the N-lobe is more restricted, consistent with the tight interaction of these subdomains (up to 6°, corresponding to 2-3 Å at the periphery). Two highly variable regions are found in the N-lobe (Fig. 3a). One of these regions comprises the N terminus of helix C, the preceding loop, and the turn between β4 and β5. In fact, helix C pivots around its C-terminal end like a rigid rod. The other variable region is the loop between the fixed end of helix C and β4. This loop follows the movement of the C-lobe. It forms part of the hinge that links the N- to the C-lobe. The most variable part of the C-lobe is the activation loop, its C-terminal anchor, and the following sequence up to the N terminus of helix F (residues ∼203-229). The activation loop is highly flexible; only two molecules (E and F) exhibit a well defined conformation of the entire activation loop (B-factors of the backbone atoms <60). In another molecule (C) the activation loop could also be traced, but the result was unsatisfying (bad geometry, B-factors up to ∼85), so it was omitted in the final model. Moreover, all three conformations of the activation loop that have been traced are different from each other. In molecules E and F, the activation loops are stabilized by reciprocal intermolecular contacts (E with F, and F with E). This is reminiscent of the MARK2 crystal structure that consists of symmetric dimers with the activation loops at the center in close contact and even covalently linked by a disulfide bridge. However, in MARK1, the packing of the molecules is different. There is no special symmetry relation between E and F, and therefore, there is no requirement for the activation loops of these molecules to be similar. In molecules D, G, and H, the flexibility of the C-lobe affects a substantial part of the support structure of the activation loop, including the C-terminal anchor (P + 1 loop), helix EF, the loop leading to helix F as well as helix G, and the loop between helices I and H. These regions exhibit considerable shifts between the molecules or are untraceable due to conformational disorder or the presence of multiple conformations. The UBA domains of all molecules are well defined. In fact they rank among the best defined parts of the crystal structure in terms of root square deviations and B-factors. The linker (residues ∼313-322) has to adapt to the displacements of the C-lobe and the UBA domain; nevertheless, its backbone trace and side chain conformations are well conserved in all molecules. Differences between MARK1 and MARK2—Further discussion of the MARK1 structure will focus on molecules E and F, the best defined molecules in the MARK1 structure. These molecules differ mainly by the conformation of the activation loop between residues 202 and 214 and by relative movements of the subdomains as described above (with intermediate rotations, 6.3° for the C-lobe, 4.9° for the UBA domain; relative to the N-lobe). For comparisons with the MARK2 structure, the same approach is used as before, with the same core structural elements serving as a reference for describing the relative movement of the subdomains (Fig. 3). Unless otherwise noted, comparisons are between molecule E of MARK1 and molecule A of MARK2 using the coordinates of the selenomethionine derivative of the Thr-208/Ser-212 double mutant (PDB code 1Y8G), which is the structure of highest resolution available for MARK2. Superposition of the N-lobes or the UBA domains of MARK1 and MARK2 clearly shows that the UBA domain attaches to the catalytic domain at the same place and with the same orientation in both isoforms (Fig. 3, a and c). More generally, the relative movements of the subdomains (as defined by the core reference elements) are similar to those observed between the different molecules of the MARK1 structure; their amplitudes, however, tend to exceed the range covered by the MARK1 molecules. This is most obvious for the UBA domain in the superposition of the C-lobes (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, large deviations between the two isoforms occur in the highly variable regions of the N- and the C-lobe and in the catalytic loop. N-lobe—Helix C of MARK1 performs a movement relative to MARK2 that consists of a small shift in axial direction combined with a tilt rotation of about 5°. This movement also extends to the adjacent loop and to strands β4 and β5 (Fig. 3a). Together with the overall rotation of the N-lobe, this movement leads to a substantial dislocation of helix C farther away from the C-lobe (Figs. 3b and 4). C-lobe—In MARK2, the N-terminal half of the activation segment (residues 193-219) starting with the DFG motif is disordered and invisible; only the C-terminal half (residues 206-219) was traceable due to stabilization by direct interaction of the activation segments of the MARK2 dimers (17Panneerselvam S. Marx A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Structure. 2006; 14: 173-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the MARK1 structure, the N-terminal anchor up to residue 201 is well defined and almost identical in all molecules, whereas the remaining part of the activation segment is more variable; it is clearly visible in two of eight molecules (E and F). The common part of the activation segment (residues 193-201) is nestled to helix C and the P-loop (β1-β2). Moving helix C to its position in MARK2 would result in a steric clash with the stable part of the activation segment (Fig. 4c). The second half of the activation segment forms a severely distorted helix in molecule E. From Gly-211 to the APE motif (217-219, which marks the end of the activation segment), the conformation of molecule E is very similar to that of MARK2. The APE motif, which is part of the EF helix, is remarkably similar in all molecules of the MARK1 structure inasmuch as they could be defined. The conformation of residues ∼202 to 210, however, is highly variable, indicating that this part of the activation segment (visible in molecules E and F and to some extent in the other molecules) is at least partially determined by intermolecular contacts (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the activation loops of molecules E and F are in close contact to each other, as they are in the MARK2 dimers. At the first glance, molecules E and F form dimers similar to MARK2 (see overlay in Fig. 5a). However, if one of the molecules is overlaid by best fit to a molecule of the MARK2 dimer, the other is rotated by an angle of about 75° compared with the MARK2 structure. Still, the overall shape of the “EF dimer” is roughly conserved since the rotation is around the lo"

We now report that a calpain-calpastatin association can occur also in the absence of Ca2+ or at very low Ca2+ concentrations, reflecting the physiological conditions under which calpain retains its inactive conformational state. The calpastatin binding region is localized in the non-inhibitory L-domain containing the amino acid sequences encoded by exons 4-7. This calpastatin region recognizes a calpain sequence located near the end of the DII-domain. Interaction of calpain with calpastatins lacking these sequences becomes strictly Ca2+-dependent because, under these conditions, the transition to an active state of the protease is an obligatory requirement. The occurrence of the molecular association between Ca2+-free calpain and various recombinant calpastatin forms has been demonstrated by the following experimental results. Addition of calpastatin protected calpain from trypsin digestion. Calpain was coprecipitated when calpastatin was immunoprecipitated. The calpastatin molecular size increased following exposure to calpain. The two proteins comigrated in zymogram analysis. Furthermore, calpain-calpastatin interaction was perturbed by protein kinase C phosphorylation occurring at sites located at the exons involved in the association.

Friedrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9022-9026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The conformational transition of calpain from the inactive to the Ca2+-induced active state seems to be an obligatory step for the calpain-calpastatin association stabilized by interactions at many sites (29Cottin P.

Biochem. 1999; 74: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have reported that an association between calpain and calpastatin can occur within cells in the presence of physiological Ca2+ levels. This conclusion was reached based on immunoprecipitation experiments carried out in cell homogenates prepared in the presence of 0.2 mm EDTA, a condition preserving the inactive calpain state. The fact that most of the earlier attempts were unsuccessful in identifying this association could be due to a number of reasons, including the use of high ionic strength media (35Maddock K.R. Huff-Lonergan E. Rowe L.J. Lonergan S.M. J. Anim. Sci. 2005; 83: 1370-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), inappropriate technical approaches, and the lack of precise information on the molecular properties of calpastatin preparations. This is a crucial point because calpastatin isolated from tissues or cell cultures might be a mixture of different forms derived from alternative splicing or proteolysis, showing also different inhibitory properties. It must also be recalled that calpastatin behaves as a high affinity substrate of calpain (36Nakamura M. Inomata M. Imajoh S. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Calpain-calpastatin association under physiological conditions is also supported by our recent observations indicating that calpain undergoes a conformational transition following exposure to calpastatin regardless of the presence of Ca2+ (37Averna M. Stifanese R. De Tullio R. Defranchi E. Salamino F. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1660-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes changes in calpain conformation, we have demonstrated that such changes take place also in intact cells following stimulation with agonists that do not induce an increase in intracellular free Ca2+. These results indicate that the association of calpastatin with calpain in the inactive Ca2+-free form can occur under physiological intracellular conditions. Finally, because a calpain-substrate complex can be formed even if the protease retains its inactive conformation (38Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Salamino F. Sparatore B. Michetti M. Horecker B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 39Fabrice R. Carole J.N. Anne M. Dieter F. Yves B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 404-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume that also calpain-calpastatin association can take place under these conditions.In this work, we report that the non-inhibitory region (L-domain) of calpastatin interacts with native micromolar and millimolar calpain at physiological concentrations of Ca2+. The specific exon sequences involved in such an interaction have been identified in the region encoded by exons 4-7. Phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) 2The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PKA, protein kinase A. 2The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PKA, protein kinase A.at sites included in these sequences profoundly reduced this association. This finding provides further support to the physiological relevance of this process, which may represent an additional mechanism for the regulation of calpain by controlling the rate and extent of enzyme activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Casein, bovine serum albumin, trypsin, rabbit muscle aldolase, carbonic anhydrase, arachidonate, aprotinin, leupeptin, and dibutyryl cAMP were purchased from Sigma. 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride was obtained from Calbiochem.

Following this treatment, no protease activity was detectable, whereas upon SDS-PAGE, the major protein band on the stained gel showed a mass of ∼55-60 kDa. This autolysis removes both the DI- and DII-domains from the protease molecule (8Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L.

The following recombinant rat brain calpastatins (18De Tullio R. Sparatore B. Salamino F. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were prepared: RNCAST104 (Gen-Bank™ accession number Y13588), containing the complete L-domain (exons 2-8) and four inhibitory units (exons 9-29); RNCAST23 (accession number Y13591), containing the L-domain and lacking exon 6 and one inhibitory unit (exons 9-12); RNCAST110 (accession number Y13590), corresponding to the free L-domain containing sequences encoded by exons 2-7; RNCAST600, composed of the complete L-domain (exons 2 and 4-8) and one inhibitory unit (exons 9-12); and RNCAST300, composed of exon 8 and a single inhibitory unit (exons 9-12). The recombinant human calpastatin fragment corresponding to a portion of the human calpain inhibitor (accession number P20810) contains exons 4-13. The oligonucleotides used to generate the expression clones were as follows: for RNCAST300, sense primer 5′-TGGGATCCGAGAAGAAATCATTAACACCTACTT (containing a BamHI restriction site at the 5′-end); for RNCAST600, sense primer 5′-TGGGATCCATGAGTACCACAGGAGCTAAGG (containing a BamHI restriction site at the 5′-end); for both calpastatins, antisense primer 5′-TGGAATTCTCACAAGGCATCTATAGCATGGTC (containing an EcoRI restriction site at the 5′-end); and for the human calpastatin fragment, sense primer 5′-TGGGATCCATGGCTGTAAAAACAGAACCTGAG (containing a BamHI restriction site at the 5′-end) and antisense primer 5′-TGGAATTCTCACAAGGCGTCTATAGCATCATC (containing an EcoRI restriction site at the 5′-end). The 20-residue peptide GIKEGTIPPEYRKLLEKNEA (derived from amino acids 174-193 of RNCAST104) corresponds to a portion of sequence B and was chemically synthesized. All RNCAST forms were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli (44Melloni E. De Tullio R. Averna M. Tedesco I. Salamino F. Sparatore B. Pontremoli S.

Anti-phosphoserine mAb was purchased from Sigma.Cell Culture—Jurkat cells (human T-lymphocyte line) were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 10 units/ml penicillin (Sigma), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), and 4 mml-glutamine.Assay of Calpain and Calpastatin Activities—Calpain activity was assayed using human denatured globin as substrate following the liberation of free amino groups (41Salamino F. Averna M. Tedesco I. De Tullio R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One unit of calpain activity is defined as the amount that releases free α-amino groups at 1 μmol/h under the specified conditions. The specific activity of the calpain forms used ranged from 950 to 1050 units/mg. Calpastatin activity was assayed as reported (43Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Viotti P.L. Michetti M. Salamino F. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 646-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). One unit of calpastatin activity is defined as the amount that inhibits one unit of calpain activity.Calpain Carboxymethylation—Human erythrocyte calpain was treated with a 100-fold excess of iodoacetamide to block the essential sulfhydryl group without any change in the other functional protease properties (42Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). When calpain activity was almost completely lost, the excess of reagents was removed by filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (1 × 17 cm) previously equilibrated with 50 mm sodium borate (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mm EDTA.Calpain Digestion by Trypsin—Calpain (10 μg) was mixed with RNCAST600 (3 μg) or RNCAST300 (1.5 μg) in 50 μl of 50 mm sodium borate buffer (pH 7.5) and 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol containing alternatively 100 μm Ca2+, or 1 μm Ca2+, or 1 mm EDTA and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with or without trypsin at a 1000:1 ratio. To avoid calpain autoproteolysis in the course of the experiments carried out in the presence of Ca2+, carboxymethylated human erythrocyte calpain was used (42Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). At the end of the incubations, aliquots (10 μl) of the mixtures were collected and submitted to 10% SDS-PAGE (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar). The proteins were then blotted (47Towbin J. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44709) Google Scholar). The sheets were then incubated with the appropriate monoclonal antibody as specified in the next paragraph. The immunoreactive material was detected by a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (48Palejwala S. Goldsmith L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4202-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and developed with the ECL® detection system. The immunoreactive bands were quantified with a Shimadzu CS9000 densitometer at a wavelength of 590 nm.Immunoprecipitation of Calpastatin—Recombinant calpastatins alone or mixtures of calpastatin and human erythrocyte calpain in a final volume of 50 μl of 50 mm sodium borate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA were treated with 3 μg of anti-calpastatin mAb 35.23 at 4 °C for 2 h. The replacement of EDTA with Ca2+ and its concentration in these mixtures is specified elsewhere. Protein G-Sepharose (15 μl) was then added to the samples, and these mixtures were rotated end-over-end for 2 h at 4°C. Sepharose beads were collected and washed three times with 0.1 ml of 50 m m sodium borate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA. The beads were then suspended in 50 μl of 60 m m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 2% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol and heated for 1 min at 100 °C. The insoluble particles were discarded by centrifugation, and the clear solutions were submitted to 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted. Calpain and calpastatins were immunodetected with anti-calpastatin mAb 35.23 or anti-calpain mAb 56.3 and revealed using peroxidase-linked secondary antibody.Size-exclusion Experiments on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL Column—RNCAST600 alone (10 μg) or mixed with human erythrocyte calpain (48μg) was diluted in 50μl (final volume) of 50 mm sodium borate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and loaded onto a Superdex 75 10/300 GL size-exclusion gel chromatography column previously equilibrated with 50 mm sodium borate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots (100 μl) of the eluted fractions were heated for 1 min at 100 °C to inactivate calpain activity, and 30 μl of the heated solution were then used to assay calpastatin activity as described (43Pontremoli S.

The resin was packed for 15-20 min at 4 °C, and aliquots (0.2 ml) of the clear aqueous phase were collected and heated for 1 min at 100 °C. Calpastatin activity was then assayed as described (43Pontremoli S. Melloni E. Viotti P.L. Michetti M. Salamino F. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 646-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) using 50 μl of the clear supernatant.Zymography of Mixtures of Calpain and Calpastatin—Zymogram analysis was carried out as described by Raser et al.(52Raser K.J.

Calpain Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 109-116Google Scholar). Briefly, calpain, calpastatin, or mixtures of the two proteins were diluted in 60 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 20% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm EDTA and loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 1 mg/ml casein.The electrophoretic run was carried out in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 125 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 2 h at 4°C and 125V. At the end of the electrophoretic run, the gel was incubated overnight at 25 °C in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2 under gentle shaking. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the bands were quantified by densitometric analysis using Kodak Digital Science 1D image analysis software.Purification of Protein Kinase A (PKA) and PKC and Phosphorylation of Calpastatin—PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) and PKC (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase) were purified from rat brain and assayed as described (41Salamino F. Averna M. Tedesco I. De Tullio R. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Calpastatin phosphorylation by PKA or PKC was carried out as reported (54Averna M. De Tullio R. Salamino F. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Incorporation of γ-32P into calpastatin molecules was determined following 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of the dried gels. The equivalents of γ-32P incorporated were measured using a Cyclone storage phosphor screen system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and quantified utilizing OptiQuant Version 03.10 acquisition and analysis software (55Amemiya Y. Miyahara J. Nature. 1988; 336: 89-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar).Separation of Calpastatin Forms by Ion-exchange Chromatography—Freshly collected rat brains (2 g) were homogenized in 5 volumes of 50 mm sodium borate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The crude homogenate was sonicated six times (for 10 s at 30-s intervals), and the particulate material was discarded by centrifugation at 25,000 × g. The clear supernatant was collected and heated at 100 °C for 3 min, and the precipitated protein was discarded by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The clear solution was loaded onto a DE53 column (1 × 5 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.7) containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer, and the absorbed proteins were eluted with a 0-0.35 m NaCl gradient. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected.Determination of Intracellular Calpain and Calpastatin by Confocal Microscopy and Fluorescence Quantification—Control or stimulated Jurkat cells were fixed and permeabilized by the Triton/paraformaldehyde method as described (56De Tullio R. Passalacqua M. Averna M. Salamino F. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Calpain and calpastatin intracellular localizations were determined by confocal microscopy using anti-calpain mAb 56.3 or anti-calpastatin mAb 35.23 as the primary antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (Alexa 488) as the secondary antibody. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 and 522 nm, respectively, and fluorescence intensity was quantified using LaserPix software (Bio-Rad).RESULTSProtection of Calpain from Trypsin Digestion by Recombinant Calpastatins—Although the role of the four inhibitory units has been well established, the physiological relevance of the N-terminal non-inhibitory region (L-domain) of calpastatin still remains uncertain.

These receptors play essential roles in mediating synaptic transmission and modulating the release of a variety of neurotransmitters. Different molecular forms of the nAChR are comprised of homopentameric (α7 and α9) and heteropentameric (e.g. α3β2, α4β2, and α1β1γϵ) arrangements of subunits that have discrete anatomical locations and distinct physiological functions. Dys-function or dysregulation of nAChRs is implicated in a variety of neuropsychiatric disease states including schizophrenia, Parkinson, Alzheimer, depression and nicotine addiction (1Changeux J.P. Edelstein S.J. Odile J. Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors: From Molecular Biology to Cognition. Johns Hopkins University Press, New York2005Google Scholar). Several drug discovery programs aim to develop specific drugs that selectively act on subtypes of nAChRs. The AChBP, synthesized in molluskan glial cells, is proposed to function as a modulator of synaptic ACh transmission. ACh, acting on a glial nAChR, induces cellular release of AChBP. AChBP, in turn, binds presynaptically released ACh, acting as a synaptic buffer to dampen synaptic transmission (2Smit A.B. Syed N.I. Schaap D. van Minnen J. Klumperman J. Kits K.S. Lodder H. van der Schors R.C. van Elk R. Sorgedrager B. Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Geraerts W.P. Nature. 2001; 411: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). AChBP has sequence similarity (15-28% identity) with subunits of the cysteine loop ligand-gated ion channel family that includes nAChRs, GABAA, GABAC, 5-hydroxytryptophan type 3, and glycine receptors (3Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). These receptors assemble as heteromeric or homomeric pentamers of subunits, and each subunit has an NH2-terminal extracellular ligand-binding domain and four COOH-terminal transmembrane spans that serve as the channel pore-forming domain. AChBP is homologous to the extracellular domain of the cysteine-loop family. The crystal structure of AChBP has provided a structural template for examining ligand recognition in nAChRs by spectroscopic analysis of conjugated fluorophores, structural modeling, dynamics of deuterium/hydrogen exchange, computational docking of ligands, and direct monitoring of ligand occupancy by changes in intrinsic Trp fluorescence (4Celie P.H. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Dijk W.J.

Despite several conserved features of the ACh-binding site among different nAChR subtypes and the AChBP, certain ligands are able to discriminate between nAChRs of different subunit composition. The structural basis of nAChR subtype selectivity and the sequence determinants governing specificity are subjects of intense investigation. α-Conotoxins are a family of small peptides used by carnivorous marine snails to envenomate their prey. These peptides are small, disulfide-linked, conformationally constrained antagonists of nAChRs. They generally target the ligand-binding site of these receptors. Although the fold of their peptide backbone is highly conserved, differences in amino acid side chains lead to a remarkable degree of receptor subtype specificity (9Nicke A. Wonnacott S. Lewis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2305-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 10Janes R.W. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2005; 5: 280-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, α-conotoxin ImI (11Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) and an analog of α-conotoxin PnIA (PnIA (A10L,D14K)) (12Celie P.H. Kasheverov I.E. Mordvintsev D.Y.

In contrast, α-conotoxin MII (13Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), a ligand that binds with high affinity to the α3β2 and α6βx nAChRs, had only approximately micromolar affinity for the Lymnaea and Aplysia AChBPs (12Celie P.H. Kasheverov I.E. Mordvintsev D.Y. Hogg R.C. van Nierop P. van Elk R. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. Zhmak M.N. Bertrand D. Tsetlin V. Sixma T.K. Smit A.B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In this report we describe the purification of a novel peptide from the venom of the molluscivorous Conus omaria. The peptide not only avidly binds AChBP from Bulinus, Lymnaea, and Aplysia, but also selectively blocks neuronal nAChRs with greatest antagonism appearing for the α3β2 subtype. Venom Extraction—Crude venom from dissected ducts of C. omaria was collected in the Philippines, lyophilized, and stored at -70 °C until use. All reagents were pre-cooled to, and extraction procedures were carried out, at 4 °C. Thirty ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was added to each of two tubes containing 250 mg each of crude venom. The mixture was vigorously vortexed for 30 min and then centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was stored and the pellet resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and the above procedure was repeated twice. All resulting supernatants were combined and vacuum passed though a 0.45-mm filter. The filtered material was diluted to 800 ml with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for loading onto a preparative HPLC column as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Chemical Synthesis—The peptide was synthesized, 0.45 mmol/g, on a Fmoc amide resin using Fmoc chemistry and standard side protection except on cysteine residues. Cys residues were protected in pairs with either S-trityl on Cys1 and Cys3 (the first and third Cys), or S-acetamidomethyl on Cys2 and Cys4. The peptide was removed from the resin and precipitated. A two-step oxidation protocol was used to -fold selectively the peptides as described previously (14Walker C. Steel D. Jacobsen R.B. Lirazan M.B. Cruz L.J. Hooper D. Shetty R. DelaCruz R.C.

Briefly, the disulfide bridge between Cys2 and Cys8 was closed by dripping the peptide into an equal volume of 20 mm potassium ferricyanide, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The solution was allowed to react for 30 min, and the monocyclic peptide was purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Simultaneous removal of the S-acetamidomethyl groups and closure of the disulfide bridge between Cys3 and Cys13 was carried out by iodine oxidation. The monocyclic peptide and HPLC eluent was dripped into an equal volume of iodine (10 mm) in H2O:trifluoroacetic acid:acetonitrile (78:2:20 by volume) and allowed to react for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of ascorbic acid, diluted 20-fold with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the bicyclic peptide was purified by HPLC on a reverse-phase C18 Vydac column using a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.092% trifluoroacetic acid, 60% acetonitrile, and the remainder H2O. Mass Spectrometry and Sequencing—Measurements were performed at the Salk Institute under the direction of Jean Rivier. Liquid secondary ionization mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry were utilized. Reduction and alkylation of Cys residues and chemical sequencing was performed as previously described (13Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Reduction and Equilibrium Oxidation of α-Conotoxin OmIA— Twenty nmol of synthetic α-conotoxin OmIA prepared by the two-step oxidation protocol described above was reduced, HPLC purified, and then reoxidized using glutathione. Reduction was carried out in a 1-ml volume at room temperature for 1 h. Reducing solution was 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.7, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm dithiotheitol. Eighty μl of formic acid was added to the solution at the end of the reaction. Reduced peptide was purified by HPLC and lyophilized. Six nmol of reducedα-conotoxin OmIA was dissolved in 30 μl of 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid. This was added to a solution that at a final volume of 300 μl was 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.7, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm oxidized glutathione, and 1 mm reduced glutathione. The solution was reacted at room temperature for 2 h and terminated by the addition of 24 μl of formic acid. Expression and Purification of AChBPs—AChBPs from Lymnaea stagnalis (Ls), Aplysia californica (Ac), and Bulinus truncatus (Bt) were expressed using cDNAs synthesized from oligonucleotides engineered for mammalian codon usage, as previously described (6Hansen S.B.

Briefly, the AChBP gene was inserted into a FLAG-CMV-3 expression vector (Sigma) with the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase II gene, to confer aminoglycoside resistance, and a preprotrypsin leader peptide followed by a NH2-terminal FLAG epitope. AChBP-transfected HEK-293 cells were selected with G418 to generate stably expressing cell lines. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (MediaTech CellGro) containing 3% fetal bovine serum was collected at 3-day intervals from multitier flasks for up to 4 weeks. Adsorption onto anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel followed by elution with the FLAG peptide (both from Sigma) yielded purified protein in quantities between 0.5 and 5 mg/liter of media. Purity and assembly of subunits as a pentamer were assessed by SDS-PAGE and fast protein liquid chromatography. Two AChBP homologs (Bt-AChBP and Bt-AChBP-2) that differ by eight residues have been identified in the tissue of B. truncatus (17Celie P.H. Klaassen R.V. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. van Elk R. van Nierop P. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26457-26466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Our initial attempts expressing Bt-AChBP showed low expression in our system. During the process of converting Bt-AChBP to Bt-AChBP-2 by mutagenesis, we observed that the single mutation, F149L, results in comparatively robust expression of a soluble pentameric entity. We used the F149L construct for this investigation. Radioligand Competition Assays—An adaptation of a scintillation proximity assay was used to determine the apparent Kd as reported previously (16Hibbs R.E. Talley T.T. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28483-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, AChBP (final concentration ∼500 pm binding sites), polyvinyltoluene anti-mouse SPA scintillation beads (0.1 mg/ml, Amersham Biosciences), monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody from mouse (Sigma), and [3H]epibatidine (5 nm final concentration for Ls and Bt, 20 nm for Ac) were combined in phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.0) with increasing concentrations of competing ligand in a final volume of 100 μl. Total binding was determined in the absence of competing ligand, and nonspecific binding was measured by adding a saturating concentration (15 μm) of methyllycaconitine. The resulting mixtures were allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for a minimum of 2 h and measured on a LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Scientific). The data obtained are normalized, fit to a sigmoidal dose-response curve (variable slope), and the Kd calculated from the observed EC50 (18Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12329) Google Scholar) using GraphPad Prism version 4.02 for Windows. A minimum of three independent experiments, performed in duplicate, were used to determine the Kd values reported. This procedure required less than 10 μg of each binding protein for this study, including initial compound screening and preliminary assays. Electrophysiology—Oocytes were harvested and injected with cRNA encoding nAChR subunits as described previously (13Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). All clones were from rat, except for the muscle subtype that was from mouse. The rat α6 subunit does not express with the rat β2 subunit (19Dowell C. Olivera B.M. Garrett J.E. Staheli S.T. Watkins M. Kuryatov A. Yoshikami D. Lindstrom J.M. Mcintosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8445-8452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore used a chimera that contains the NH2-terminal extracellular α6 subunit sequence linked to the remaining portion of the α3 subunit protein as a model of activity at α6 subunit-containing nAChRs. The chimeric α6/α3 nAChR consists of amino acids 1-237 of the rat α6 subunit protein linked to amino acids 233-499 of the rat α3 subunit protein. The chimeric junction is located at the paired arginine residues immediately preceding the M1 transmembrane segment of the α3 subunit. The subunit is as previously described except that a valine to arginine change at amino acid 278 in the original chimeric construct was corrected; all other subunits were as previously described (20Azam L. Dowell C. Watkins M. Stitzel J.A. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 80-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A 30-μl cylindrical oocyte recording chamber fabricated from Sylgard was gravity-perfused with ND96A (96.0 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2,1 μm atropine, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.1-7.5) at a rate of ∼2 ml/min. All toxin solutions also contained 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to reduce nonspecific adsorption of peptide. Toxin was preapplied for 5 min. ACh-gated currents were obtained with a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (model OC-725B, Warner Instrument, Hamden, CT), and data were captured as previously described (21Luo S. Kulak J.M. Cartier G.E. Jacobsen R.B. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane potential of the oocytes was clamped at -70 mV. To apply a pulse of ACh to the oocyte, the perfusion fluid was switched to one containing ACh for 1 s. This was automatically done at intervals of 1-5 min. The shortest time interval was chosen such that reproducible control responses were obtained with no observable desensitization. This time interval depended on the nAChR subtype being tested. ACh was diluted in ND96A for tests of all nAChR subtypes except α7, in which case the diluent was ND96 (no atropine) (22Gerzanich V. Anand R. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 212-220PubMed Google Scholar). For control responses, the ACh pulse was preceded by perfusion with ND96 (for α7) or ND96A (all others). No atropine was used with oocytes expressing α7, because it has been demonstrated to be an antagonist of these receptors. The concentration of ACh was 10 μm for trials with α1β1δϵ, 200 μm for α7, and 100 μm for all other nAChRs. Toxin was bath applied for 5 min, followed by a pulse of ACh. Thereafter, toxin was washed away and subsequent ACh pulses were given every 1 min, unless otherwise indicated. All ACh pulses contain no toxin, for it was assumed that little if any bound toxin washed away in the brief time (less than 2 s rise time to peak). In our recording chamber, the bolus of ACh does not project directly at the oocyte but rather enters tangentially, swirls and mixes with the bath solution. The volume of entering ACh is such that the toxin concentration remains at a level >50% of that originally in the bath until the ACh response has peaked (<2 s). The average peak amplitude of three control responses just preceding exposure to toxin was used to normalize the amplitude of each test response to obtain a “% response” or “% block.” Each data point of a dose-response curve represents the average value ± S.E. of measurements from at least three oocytes. Dose-response curves were fit to the equation: % response = 100/{1 + ([toxin]/IC50)nH}, where nH is the Hill slope with Prism software (GraphPad Software). Molecular Modeling—Molecular modeling was done on Silicon Graphic Indigo O2 computer using the programs Discover and Insight II (Accelrys, San Diego). The three-dimensional structure of Lymnaea AChBP was built with the Homology module of Insight II using as templates two molecules; α-cobratoxin bound Lymnaea AChBP (Protein Data Bank code 1YI5) (23Bourne Y. Talley T.T. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Marchot P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1512-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and for the C-loop (residues 183-192), the structure of Aplysia AChBP bound to α-conotoxin ImI (PDB code 2BYP) (11Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In the case of α-conotoxin OmIA, the NMR derived solution conformation was used as the conotoxin template (PDB code 2GCZ) (24Chi S.W. Kim D.H. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. Han K.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 345: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The modeled structure was then minimized for 10,000 iterations of steepest descent in vacuo, using the distant-dependent dielectric constant, with the program Discover. Both structures were superimposed and α-conotoxin OmIA was located in the position where its backbone atoms were superimposed with homologous atoms of α-conotoxin in Aplysia AChBP. The systems containing AChBP and α-conotoxin underwent 800 iterations of steepest descent minimization in vacuo with fixed Cα trace atoms of AChBP using the distant-dependent dielectric constant, with the program Discover. Molecular graphics images were produced using the UCSF Chimera package from the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San Francisco (25Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (28971) Google Scholar). Purification and Sequence Determination of α-Conotoxin OmIA—A crude extract of lyophilized C. omaria venom was initially fractionated using reversed phase chromatography. Because many conotoxins are positively charged, we subsequently utilized cation exchange chromatography to achieve further purification (Fig. 1). Final purification and desalting were carried out and the product was reduced, alkylated, and sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sequence is GCCSHPACNVNNPHICG. Mass spectrometry indicated that Cys residues are present as disulfides and that the COOH-terminal α-carboxyl group is amidated (monoisotopic MH+: calculated 1720.66, observed 1720.7). The sequence was additionally confirmed though total chemical synthesis (see below). Based on the structure and function (detailed below), the peptide was named α-conotoxin OmIA according to the proposed nomenclature (26Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 1985; 4: 107-132Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Chemical Synthesis—The peptide was synthesized using solid phase Fmoc chemistry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The disulfide connectivity was assumed to be that of other venom-derived α-conotoxins, that is Cys1-Cys3 and Cys2-Cys4. Orthogonal protection was used on Cys pairs to direct the folding. Liquid secondary ionization mass spectrometry confirmed full oxidation of the peptide product (monoisotopic MH+: calculated 1720.66, observed 1720.5). On reversed phase HPLC, the fully folded synthetic peptide elutes at a time that corresponds to that of the native peptide. When the native and synthetic peptides were mixed together, they co-eluted, indicating that the native peptide has Cys1-Cys3 and Cys2-Cys4 connectivity (Fig. 2). This was further confirmed by experiments showing that the disulfide isomers may be resolved on HPLC. Fully oxidized synthetic peptide was reduced with dithiothreitol, and chromatographed. The reduced peptide elutes later and is well separated from the native peptide (Fig. 3, A and B). Equilibrium folding of the reduced peptide using glutathione gave three major products corresponding to the three theoretical disulfide arrangements; each had a mass consistent with that of fully folded peptide. Synthetic peptide prepared by directed folding co-elutes on HPLC with the second eluting of the three equilibrium folding products (Fig. 3, C-E). Given that disulfide forms 1 and 2 from equilibrium folding of the peptide are not well resolved on HPLC, directed folding is the synthetic procedure of choice.FIGURE 3Co-elution of α-conotoxin OmIA synthesized by directed folding versus equilibrium folding.

OmIA was tested for its ability to displace the binding of [3H]epibatidine or [125I]α-bungarotoxin to the three AChBPs as measured by a scintillation proximity assay. The Kd values determined using [3H]epibatidine are consistent with those using [125I]α-bungarotoxin and indicate that OmIA has high affinity for AChBP from all three species (Fig. 4 and Table 1).TABLE 1Kd of α-conotoxins OmIA and ImI for AChBPsAChBPRadioligandα-OmIAα-ImIKd ± S.E.aCalculated from observed IC50 of six replicate measurements as described under “Experimental Procedures”nH ± S.E.bnH denotes the Hill slopes as described under “Experimental Procedures”Kd ± S.E.cCalculated from observed IC50 of three replicate measurements as described under “Experimental Procedures”nH ± S.E.cCalculated from observed IC50 of three replicate measurements as described under “Experimental Procedures”nmnmLymnaea[3H]Epibatidine1.7 ± 0.11.01 ± 0.02>10,000125I-Labeled α-Bgtx2.0 ± 0.20.99 ± 0.05Aplysia[3H]Epibatidine6.7 ± 0.31.10 ± 0.062.1 ± 0.10.96 ± 0.15125I-Labeled α-Bgtx7.7 ± 0.11.06 ± 0.02Bulinus[3H]Epibatidine18.5 ± 1.60.95 ± 0.0910.2 ± 1.31.21 ± 0.09a Calculated from observed IC50 of six replicate measurements as described under “Experimental Procedures”b nH denotes the Hill slopes as described under “Experimental Procedures”c Calculated from observed IC50 of three replicate measurements as described under “Experimental Procedures” Open table in a new tab We next tested activity on rat nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes. AChBPs have considerable sequence identity with the homomeric α7 nAChR. OmIA effectively blocks the ACh-induced response on homomeric α7 nAChRs at 100 nm. By contrast, it is inactive on the α1β1δϵ subtype of nAChR at 10 μm, indicating a high selectivity for this neuronal subtype versus adult muscle subtype (Fig. 5). Concentration-response testing on multiple subtypes of nAChRs indicated that the peptide has highest affinity for the α3β2 nAChR, yet is inactive at α2β2 and α4β2 nAChRs (Fig. 5 and Table 2). To our knowledge, OmIA is the only reported α-conotoxin that potently and preferentially targets α3β2 nAChRs and also has high affinity for the AChBP. In contrast, for example, α-conotoxin MII, which blocks α3β2 nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes with an IC50 of 2.2 nm (27McIntosh J.M. Azam L. Staheli S. Dowell C. Lindstrom J.M. Kuryatov A.

The docked structures show a close fit of both OmIA and ImI at the subunit interface and under the C-loop flap (Fig. 6). The additional mass of the OmIA toxin at its COOH-terminal end (17 versus 12 amino acids) is accommodated in the binding site region at the outer perimeter of the complementary face and partially exposed to solvent.

https://openalex.org/W1997349175,"The Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio harveyi produces and responds to three autoinducers, AI-1, AI-2, and CAI-1 to regulate cell density dependent gene expression by a process referred to as quorum sensing. The concentration of the autoinducers is sensed by three cognate hybrid sensor kinases, and information is channeled via the HPt protein LuxU to the response regulator LuxO. Here, a detailed biochemical study on the enzymatic activities of the membrane-integrated hybrid sensor kinase LuxN, the sensor for N-(d-3-hydroxybutanoyl)homoserine lactone (AI-1), is provided. LuxN was heterologously overproduced as the full-length protein in Escherichia coli. LuxN activities were characterized in vitro and are an autophosphorylation activity with an unusually high ATP turnover rate, stable LuxU phosphorylation, and a slow phosphatase activity with LuxU∼P as substrate. The presence of AI-1 affected the kinase but not the phosphatase activity of LuxN. The influence of AI-1 on the LuxN→ LuxU signaling step was monitored, and in the presence of AI-1, the kinase activity of LuxN, and hence the amount of LuxU∼P produced, were significantly reduced. Half-maximal inhibition of kinase activity by AI-1 occurred at 20 μm. Together, these results indicate that AI-1 directly interacts with LuxN to down-regulate its autokinase activity and suggest that the key regulatory step of the AI-1 quorum sensing system of Vibrio harveyi is AI-1-mediated repression of the LuxN kinase activity.

The influence of AI-1 on the LuxN→ LuxU signaling step was monitored, and in the presence of AI-1, the kinase activity of LuxN, and hence the amount of LuxU∼P produced, were significantly reduced. Half-maximal inhibition of kinase activity by AI-1 occurred at 20 μm. Together, these results indicate that AI-1 directly interacts with LuxN to down-regulate its autokinase activity and suggest that the key regulatory step of the AI-1 quorum sensing system of Vibrio harveyi is AI-1-mediated repression of the LuxN kinase activity. Vibrio harveyi is a free-living marine bacterium that controls bioluminescence, exopolysaccharide and siderophore production, type III secretion, and other processes through quorum sensing. V. harveyi has three quorum sensing systems. AI-1, an acyl homoserine lactone, sensed by LuxN is employed for intraspecies signaling (1Bassler B.L. Wright M. Silverman M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). AI-2, a furanosyl borate diester, sensed by LuxPQ is involved in inter-species signaling (2Chen X. Schauder S. Potier N. Van Dorsselaer A. Pelczer I. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). CAI-1, whose chemical nature is unknown, is sensed by CqsS and is proposed to be responsible for Vibrio-specific signaling (3Henke J.M. Bassler B.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6902-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Information from all three hybrid sensor kinases is transduced via phosphorelay to the response regulator LuxO with the HPt protein LuxU acting as intermediate (Fig. 1). Phosphorylated LuxO, a σ54-dependent response regulator, activates transcription of genes encoding four small regulatory RNAs, which together with Hfq, destabilize the transcript for the LuxR protein, the master transcriptional regulator required for quorum sensing gene expression (4Mok K.C. Wingreen N.S. Bassler B.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 870-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 5Lenz D.H. Mok K.C. Lilley B.N. Kulkarni R.V. Wingreen N.S. Bassler B.L.

Microbiol. 2005; 58: 1186-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Bioluminescence is used as the canonical readout for V. harveyi quorum sensing controlled gene expression. Genetic studies indicated that LuxO is phosphorylated at low cell density, causing the luciferase operon to be repressed, and the cells are dark. When a threshold concentration of autoinducer is reached, LuxO is dephosphorylated, leading to induction of the luciferase operon and a bright phenotype (Fig. 1). It has been postulated that the hybrid sensor kinases switch from kinases to phosphatases at high autoinducer concentration and hence high cell density (3Henke J.M. Bassler B.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6902-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 4Mok K.C. Wingreen N.S. Bassler B.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 870-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 5Lenz D.H.

Biol. 2005; 21: 319-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (2685) Google Scholar).Despite numerous genetic studies of quorum sensing in V. harveyi, biochemical characterization of the corresponding proteins is rare. The solution structure of LuxU was solved by NMR. LuxU contains a four-helix bundle with the active-site histidine residue (His58) exposed to the solution (8Ulrich D.L. Kojetin D. Bassler B.L. Cavanagh J. Loria J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Co-crystallization of LuxP and the periplasmic domain of LuxQ showed that LuxP is bound to LuxQ independent of the presence/absence of AI-2 (9Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Miller S.T. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Amino acid replacements of residues located in the LuxP::LuxQ interface sensitize V. harveyi to AI-2, implying that binding of AI-2 to LuxP causes a conformational change within LuxQ that is transmitted across the membrane, presumably affecting LuxQ enzymatic activities (9Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Miller S.T. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).Here, we characterized LuxN′s enzymatic activities and its phosphotransfer properties to LuxU. LuxN possesses an autokinase activity that has an exceptionally high ATP turnover rate. Moreover, AI-1 has an inhibitory effect on LuxN kinase activity, whereas the LuxN phosphatase activity is unaffected by AI-1.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—E. coli strains TKR2000 (10Kollmann R. Altendorf K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and JM109 (11Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11425) Google Scholar) were used throughout this study. Cells were grown in KML medium (1% tryptone, 1% KCl, 0.5% yeast extract) and incubated aerobically in Erlenmeyer flasks in a rotary shaker at 37 °C. When appropriate, the medium was supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg·ml–1). Overexpression of luxN or luxU was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h.Cloning of luxN and luxU—The luxN gene was amplified by PCR from purified cosmid DNA using the primers LuxN-BamHI sense (5′-AAAGGGGGATCCATGTTTGATTTTAGCCTAGAG-3′) and LuxN-PstI antisense (5′-AGGTGCCTGCAGTTCTCTCTCAGCTTCACAAGC-3′). The PCR fragment obtained was digested with BamHI/PstI, gel-purified, and ligated with appropriately digested pTCaiTH (12Jung H. Buchholz M. Clausen J. Nietschke M. Revermann A. Schmid R. Jung K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39251-39258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to obtain pTLuxN-6His in which luxN is under control of the lac promoter/operator. For cloning of luxN into pKK223-3 (GE Healthcare), a HindIII site in luxN had to be removed. This was accomplished by introducing a silent mutation with concomitant formation of a DraI site using oligonucleotides LuxN-HindIII sense (5′-GAGGATTTTAAACTTTCTATT-3′) and LuxN-600 sense (5′-TATTTCTCATGCCAGTTGGC-3′) and applying the PCR overlap extension method (13Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar). The product was digested with XhoI and NsiI, and the resulting 420-bp fragment was introduced into appropriately digested pTLuxN6His resulting in plasmid pTLuxNb6His. The mutation was verified by sequencing and detection of a new restriction site for DraI. For construction of pKKLuxNb6His a 2646bp fragment of luxN obtained by digestion of pTLuxNb6His with XmaI and HindIII was introduced into pKK223-3. Similarly, individual substitution of the amino acid residues at positions His471 → Gln and Asp771 → Asn was achieved by the PCR overlap extension method using synthetic oligonucleotide primers with the corresponding codons exchanged. PCR products were purified, digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, and cloned into plasmids pTLuxN6His or pKKLuxNb6His, respectively.luxU was amplified by PCR from cosmid DNA using the primers LuxU-NdeI sense (5′-ACAAAACATATGAATACGGACGTATTAAAT-3′)/LuxU-BamHI antisense (5′-TTGCTCGGATCCTTAGTTTGTCCAAGAACGGTA-3′). The fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into appropriately digested pET16b (Novagen) to construct pETLuxU10His. luxU was also amplified by PCR with the primers LuxU-BamHI sense (5′-AAAAGGATCCAATACGGACGTATTAAATCAG-3′) and LuxU-HindIII anti-sense (5′-TTGCTCGAAAGCTTAGTTTGTCCAAGAACG-3′) and cloned into plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen) resulting in plasmid pQELuxU6His. As described above, oligonucleotide-directed specific mutagenesis using the PCR overlap extension method was used to introduce codon exchanges corresponding to a replacement of His58 → Gln (13Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar). PCR-generated DNA fragments were verified by sequencing.Preparation of Inverted Membrane Vesicles—E. coli TKR2000 was transformed with plasmids pKKLuxNb6His, pKKLux-NbH471Q6His, and pKKLuxNbD771N6His, respectively, encoding wild-type LuxN, LuxN-H471Q or LuxN-D771N with a C-terminal His6-tag separated by an amino acid linker consisting of two amino acids. Cells were grown and harvested at late exponential growth phase. Following centrifugation (20 min at 7,000 × g; 4 °C), cells were washed at 4 °C in washing buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2). Subsequently, cells were resuspended and homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol (v/v), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mm Pefablock SC (Sigma), 30 ng·ml–1 DNase) and disrupted at 4 °C using a cell disruptor (IUL Instruments). Afterward, the suspension obtained was centrifuged (10 min at 11,200 × g, 4 °C) followed by an ultracentrifugation step (1 h at 130,000 × g; 4 °C) to separate soluble proteins from membranes and insoluble proteins. LuxN-containing membrane vesicles were washed in low ionic buffer (1 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 3 mm EDTA) and resuspended in TG buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol).Purification of LuxU—LuxU-His6 was purified from the cytosolic fraction of E. coli JM109/pQELuxU6His. Cells were grown aerobically in KML medium at 37 °C and induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) during exponential growth (A600 = 0.8) for 3 h. Cells were harvested and lysed as described above. The His-tagged LuxU was purified from the cytosolic fraction by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer E (10 mm imidazole, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.4 mm Pefablock SC). His-tagged protein was eluted with buffer E containing 250 mm imidazole. During the entire purification process the temperature was maintained at 4 °C to minimize proteolysis.Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation Assays—Autophosphorylation was tested with LuxN in membrane vesicles. A typical reaction mixture (total volume 180 μl) contained 8 mg/ml membrane proteins with LuxN-His6, and when indicated 0.1 mg/ml purified His6-LuxU, in phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 500 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT). The reaction was started by addition of radiolabled Mg2+-ATP, typically 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.94 Ci/mmol) and 110 μm MgCl2. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature, and at various time points the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS loading buffer followed by separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried at 80 °C on filter paper or blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Dried gels or membranes were exposed to a phosphoscreen for at least 24 h and subsequently scanned using a PhosphoimagerSI (Amersham Biosciences). Signal intensities of phosphorylated proteins were quantified in comparison to an [γ-32P]ATP standard using ImageQuant V5.0.For dephosphorylation assays, first, LuxU was phosphorylated using LuxN. In this case, the phosphorylation buffer contained 10 mm CaCl2 instead of MgCl2 and twice the amount of LuxN and LuxU. After 10-min incubation at room temperature, membrane vesicles were removed by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and ATP and CaCl2 were removed by gel filtration (Sephadex G25 columns, GE Healthcare). Dephosphorylation of LuxU∼P (0.6 mg/ml) was initiated by addition of 110 μm MgCl2, 100 μm ATPγS, 2The abbreviation used is: ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). and LuxN in membrane vesicles (8 mg/ml). As described above, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and exposed to a phosphoscreen.Analytical Procedures—Protein was assayed by the method of Peterson (14Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7089) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) using 7.5 or 15% acrylamide gels. His-tagged Lux proteins were detected after immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-mouse antibodies against the His-tag (Qiagen) followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Rockland) according to the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSCharacterization of the in Vitro Autophosphorylation Activity of LuxN—Full-length LuxN was overproduced in the F1/F0-ATPase negative E. coli strain TKR2000. In vitro phosphorylation of LuxN was examined in inverted membrane vesicles. Incubation of these vesicles in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP led to very rapid, but short-lived autophosphorylation of LuxN (Fig. 2, A and E). The maximal phosphorylation level was reached in less than 1 min, after which the amount of LuxN∼P decreased. LuxN autophosphorylation activity was maximal in the presence of K+ ions (0.5 m) and under reducing conditions, whereas NaCl, even at low concentration, prevented autophosphorylation completely (data not shown). The turnover rate of LuxN∼P was unusually high. No phosphorylation of LuxN was detected using low concentrations of radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP with the highest specific radioactivity (3000 Ci/mmol) commercially available (data not shown). An increase of the ATP concentration led to an increase in LuxN autophosphorylation, which was maximal at about 2.5 mm ATP. Thus, for the kinase activity, a Vmax of 27 pmol/min/mg of protein, and an apparent Km for ATP of 555 μm were determined. It should be noted that all phosphorylation experiments were performed with 20–100 μm [γ-32P]ATP, which enabled significant labeling with reasonable levels of radioactivity. Consequently, the rates of LuxN phosphorylation measured were far below the Vmax determined for the autokinase activity. LuxN derivatives containing amino acid replacements of the two predicted phosphorylation sites, LuxN-H471Q (Fig. 2B), and LuxN-D771N (Fig. 2C) were tested for autokinase activity. Replacement of the conserved histidine residue (His471) abolished autophosphorylation activity (Fig. 2B). The weakly phosphorylated protein observed in the figure is unrelated to LuxN. It runs at a slightly higher molecular mass on the gel than does LuxN. Moreover, in control vesicles lacking LuxN, a weakly phosphorylated protein of the same size was observed (Fig. 2D). In contrast, LuxN-D771N exhibited 2–3-fold higher phosphorylation than wild-type LuxN (Fig. 2, C and E). Western blots show that this difference cannot be attributed to higher production of the mutant LuxN protein (Fig. 2F), so we interpret this result to be a consequence of the increased stability of the phosphoamidate (His∼P) than the mixed acid ester (Asp∼P) under the alkaline conditions of an SDS gel (16Stock J.B. Ninfa A.J. Stock A.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 450-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33176-33180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an anhydride bond has a higher energy state compared with a phosphoamidate bond. LuxN-D771N lacks this high energy phosphorylation site, and thus phosphorylation at His471 seems to have increased stability. The autophosphorylation activity of LuxN-D771N combined with the lack of activity of LuxN-H471Q indicated that His471 is phosphorylated by ATP in the transmitter domain before the phosphoryl group is transferred to Asp771 located in the receiver domain.FIGURE 2Autophosphorylation of LuxN, LuxN-H471Q, and LuxN-D771N. Membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli TKR2000 producing LuxN-6His (A), LuxN-H471Q-6His (B), LuxN-D771N-6His (C), or control vesicles (D), respectively, were incubated in the presence of 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated, and the radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. 160 μg of membrane protein was loaded per lane. A–D, autoradiograms. The arrows indicate the radiolabeled LuxN derivatives. E, the phosphorylated LuxN derivatives were quantified with ImageQuant using [γ-32P]ATP as standard.

S, radiolabeled protein standard.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Hybrid Sensor Kinase LuxN Transfers the Phosphoryl Group to the Histidine Phosphotransfer Protein LuxU—Incubation of purified His6-LuxU with radiolabeled ATP did not result in phosphorylation of the protein (data not shown). In contrast, the phosphoryl group was transferred very fast from phosphorylated LuxN to LuxU resulting in accumulation of LuxU∼P (Fig. 3, A and C). As judged by Western blot (Fig. 3B), 50 times more LuxU was present than LuxN in this experiment, which is consistent with the typical low levels of integral membrane histidine kinases found in cells compared with their soluble partners (18Kremling A. Heermann R. Centler F. Jung K. Gilles E.D. Biosystems. 2004; 78: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Whereas phosphorylated LuxN was barely detectable, LuxU∼P was stable and increased constantly for 10 min. This result indicates that LuxU can be regarded as a sink for phosphate from LuxN. Using 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP as substrate, about 1% of the LuxU molecules were labeled at a rate of 0.83 pmol/min/mg protein in a LuxN-specific manner. No phosphotransfer was observed when LuxN-H471Q or LuxN-D771N was used (data not shown). Furthermore, replacement of His58 with Gln in LuxU also abolished the phosphorylation of the protein (data not shown), confirming the proposed phosphorylation sites in both LuxN and LuxU.FIGURE 3Phosphotransfer from the sensor kinase LuxN to the histidine phosphotransfer protein LuxU. For in vitro phosphorylation, membrane vesicles containing full-length LuxN (per lane: 160 μg of membrane protein containing ∼6 pmol of LuxN) were incubated with 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP for 1 min (lane 1) prior to addition of purified LuxU (290 pmol/lane). Incubation was continued, and samples were withdrawn at the indicated times. Radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western immunoblotting using antibodies against the His-tag (B). The dried membranes were exposed to a phosphoscreen for autoradiography (A). The arrows mark LuxU and LuxN. Phosphorylated LuxU was quantified with ImageQuant using [γ-32P]ATP as standard (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reconstitution of LuxN→LuxU Signal Transduction in Vitro—To mimic the in vivo situation, LuxN and LuxU were incubated together, and the reaction was initiated by addition of radiolabeled ATP. The time course of LuxU phosphorylation was followed for 60 min (Fig. 4, A and C). Following addition of ATP, phosphorylated LuxU was detected within 1 min, and it reached a maximum level after 10 min and declined thereafter. Phosphorylated LuxN was hardly detectable (data not shown). The identical experiment was performed following preincubation of the membrane vesicles containing LuxN with synthetically prepared AI-1 (50 μm). 3H-Labeled homoserine lactone is freely diffusible through the cytoplasmic membrane, and following exogenous addition it is found within 20 s in the cytoplasm (19Kaplan H.B. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1210-1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, to ensure that AI-1 reached the periplasmic domain in inside-out membrane vesicles, vesicles were preincubated (5 min) with AI-1. Preliminary tests revealed that an additional sonication step did not improve the results. The time course for LuxN-dependent phosphorylation of LuxU was essentially identical in the presence and absence of AI-1, however, strikingly lower LuxU∼P was produced (60% reduction) when AI-1 was present compared with when it was absent (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, the presence of AI-1 does not prevent LuxN autophosphorylation or phosphotransfer from LuxN to LuxU. Rather, AI-1 significantly reduces LuxU∼P production. Addition of AI-1-containing conditioned cell-free culture fluids produced comparable effects (data not shown). The concentration-dependent influence of AI-1 on LuxN→ LuxU signaling is shown in Fig. 4D. Half-maximal inhibition of LuxU phosphorylation was determined with 5 μm AI-1. At concentrations higher than 20 μm, a constant level of phosphorylated LuxU∼P was observed.FIGURE 4Reconstitution of the LuxN → LuxU signal transduction cascade and the influence of AI-1. A, membrane vesicles containing LuxN (∼6 pmol of LuxN) were incubated with purified LuxU (290 pmol) in the absence (A) and presence of 50 μm pure AI-1 (B). The reaction was initiated by adding 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and at the indicated time points, the reaction was terminated. Autoradiograms show the time course of LuxU phosphorylation. The amount of LuxU∼P was quantified with ImageQuant using [γ-32P]ATP as standard and normalized. A relative amount of 1.0 of LuxU∼P corresponds to 2.5 pmol (C). The identical experiment was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of AI-1. The amount of LuxU∼P was quantified after 5 min of incubation (D). S, radiolabeled protein standard.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Autoinducer-1 Inhibits the LuxN Kinase Activity—We considered two possibilities for the effects of AI-1 on the levels of LuxU phosphorylation; AI-1 could affect LuxN kinase activity or LuxN phosphatase activity. To examine the effects of AI-1 on LuxN kinase activity, various concentrations of AI-1 were incubated with LuxN and the initial rates of autophosphorylation determined. Because of the weak phosphorylation signal obtained with wild-type LuxN (see Fig. 2), which is likely further reduced in the presence of AI-1, the LuxN-D771N derivative was used for this series of experiments to provide us a method with which to reliably quantify our data. The kinase activity of LuxN-D771N was significantly affected by AI-1 (Fig. 5). Increasing AI-1 concentrations successively decreased the rate of autophosphorylation of LuxN-D771N. The concentration-dependent influence of AI-1 followed the same course as was observed for the LuxN→ LuxU phosphorylation. The half-maximal inhibition was determined to be 20 μm AI-1. Despite the difficulties associated with the wild-type protein, we could in fact observe that AI-1 affected the wild-type LuxN kinase activity (Fig. 5). The phosphorylation signal for the wild-type was only slightly above background, which could account for the observed weak effects of AI-1 on wild-type autophosphorylation activity. Nevertheless, even the highest AI-1 concentration did not completely abolish the autophosphorylation activity of LuxN wild-type or LuxN-D771N.FIGURE 5Influence of AI-1 on the LuxN kinase activity. LuxN in membrane vesicles was preincubated with the indicated concentrations of AI-1 for 5 min, and the autophosphorylation reaction was initiated by adding 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP. Samples were withdrawn, and the initial rates of autophosphorylation were determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)LuxN Phosphatase Activity Is Not Regulated by AI-1—To determine whether the decline of LuxU∼P observed in the reconstituted cascade (see Fig. 4A) was due to effects of AI-1 on phosphatase activity of LuxN, we examined this activity. Purified LuxU∼P was incubated with LuxN at a ratio 50:1, and the time-dependent LuxU∼P dephosphorylation rate was 0.33 pmol/min/mg protein (Fig. 6, B and G). This result shows that indeed, LuxN has phosphatase activity on LuxU-P because LuxU-P alone was stable for at least 2 h (Fig. 6, A and G). LuxN phosphatase activity was independent of the presence of ATP (data not shown). The significance of the phosphorylation sites in LuxN were examined in the phosphatase assay. The LuxN-H471Q phosphatase activity was indistinguishable from the wild type (Fig. 6, D and G). However, no LuxU∼P dephosphorylation was observed when LuxN-D771N was used (Fig. 6, E and F) indicating that this aspartate residue is essential for the phosphatase activity of LuxN. Surprisingly, AI-1 had no effect on the phosphatase activity of LuxN. In all cases, the dephosphorylation rates in the presence of AI-1 were nearly identical to the rate determined in its absence (Fig. 6, B, C, E, and F).FIGURE 6Dephosphorylation of LuxU∼P. A mixture of phosphorylated LuxU and AI-1 (10% AI-1 containing conditioned cell-free culture fluid) was incubated in the absence (A) and the presence of membrane vesicles containing LuxN-6His (B), LuxN-H471Q-6His (D), or LuxN-D771N-6His (F). The identical experiments were performed in the absence of AI-1 with membrane vesicles containing LuxN-6His (C), or LuxN-D771N-6His (E). At the indicated time points, the reactions were terminated, and the amount of phosphorylated LuxU was determined after SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The amount of phosphorylated LuxU was quantified with ImageQuant using [γ-32P]ATP as standard (G).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONLuxN belongs to the family of unorthodox sensor kinases that are equipped with two phosphorylation sites. Sequence alignment studies suggested His471 and Asp771 as the phosphorylation sites of LuxN. Consistent with this, genetic analyses of LuxN derivatives with point mutations at the putative sites of phosphorylation provided evidence for the important roles of the conserved amino acid residues His471 in the transmitter domain and Asp771 in the receiver domain (20Freeman J.A. Lilley B.N. Bassler B.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Moreover, investigation of the bioluminescence phenotypes of these and other lux mutants of V. harveyi led to the conclusion that LuxN catalyzes three enzymatic activities within a phosphorelay: (i) autophosphorylation and intramolecular phosphotransfer from His471 to Asp771; (ii) phosphotransfer from LuxN to LuxU, a histidine phosphotransfer protein; and (iii) dephosphorylation of LuxU. In the present report these proposed enzymatic activities of LuxN and the effect of AI-1 on them were investigated in vitro.luxN was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli as a full-length protein including the N-terminal membrane-spanning domain. For in vitro phosphorylation assays, inverted membrane vesicles containing LuxN were incubated with radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP. Autophosphorylation of L"
https://openalex.org/W1969181446,"C4 photosynthesis typically requires two specialized leaf cell types, bundle sheath (bs) and mesophyll (mp), which provide the foundation for this highly efficient carbon assimilation pathway. In leaves of Flaveria bidentis, a dicotyledonous C4 plant, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rubisco) accumulates only in bs cells surrounding the vascular centers and not in mp cells. This is in contrast to the more common C3 plants, which accumulate rubisco in all photosynthetic cells. Many previous studies have focused on transcriptional control of C4 cell type-specificity; however, post-transcriptional regulation has also been implicated in the bs-specific expression of genes encoding the rubisco subunits. In this current study, a biolistic leaf transformation assay has provided direct evidence that the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of F. bidentis FbRbcS1 mRNA (from a nuclear gene encoding the rubisco small subunit), in themselves, confer strong bs cell-specific expression to gfpA reporter gene transcripts when transcribed from a constitutive CaMV promoter. In transformed leaf regions, strong bs cell-specific GFP expression was accompanied by corresponding bs cell-specific accumulation of the constitutively transcribed FbRbcS1 5′-UTR-gfpA-3′-UTR mRNAs. Control constructs lacking any RbcS mRNA sequences were expressed in all leaf cell types. These findings demonstrate that characteristic cell type-specific FbRbcS1 expression patterns in C4 leaves can be established entirely by sequences contained within the transcribed UTRs of FbRbcS1 mRNAs. We conclude that selective transcript stabilization (in bs cells) or degradation (in mp cells) plays a key role in determining bs cell-specific localization of the rubisco enzyme. C4 photosynthesis typically requires two specialized leaf cell types, bundle sheath (bs) and mesophyll (mp), which provide the foundation for this highly efficient carbon assimilation pathway. In leaves of Flaveria bidentis, a dicotyledonous C4 plant, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rubisco) accumulates only in bs cells surrounding the vascular centers and not in mp cells. This is in contrast to the more common C3 plants, which accumulate rubisco in all photosynthetic cells. Many previous studies have focused on transcriptional control of C4 cell type-specificity; however, post-transcriptional regulation has also been implicated in the bs-specific expression of genes encoding the rubisco subunits. In this current study, a biolistic leaf transformation assay has provided direct evidence that the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of F. bidentis FbRbcS1 mRNA (from a nuclear gene encoding the rubisco small subunit), in themselves, confer strong bs cell-specific expression to gfpA reporter gene transcripts when transcribed from a constitutive CaMV promoter. In transformed leaf regions, strong bs cell-specific GFP expression was accompanied by corresponding bs cell-specific accumulation of the constitutively transcribed FbRbcS1 5′-UTR-gfpA-3′-UTR mRNAs. Control constructs lacking any RbcS mRNA sequences were expressed in all leaf cell types. These findings demonstrate that characteristic cell type-specific FbRbcS1 expression patterns in C4 leaves can be established entirely by sequences contained within the transcribed UTRs of FbRbcS1 mRNAs. We conclude that selective transcript stabilization (in bs cells) or degradation (in mp cells) plays a key role in determining bs cell-specific localization of the rubisco enzyme. Plants that utilize the highly efficient C4 pathway of carbon fixation typically possess a Kranz-type leaf anatomy that consists of two distinct photosynthetic cell types (1Hatch M.D. Biochim.

Bundle sheath (bs) 3The abbreviations used are: bs, bundle sheath; mp, mesophyll; rubisco, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase; UTR, untranslated region; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. cells occur as a layer around each leaf vein, while mesophyll (mp) cells occur in one or more layers surrounding the vascular associated rings of bs cells. This specialized leaf anatomy compartmentalizes two sets of photosynthetic reactions that make up the C4 pathway. In the C4 dicot Flaveria bidentis, atmospheric CO2 entering via the leaf stomata is initially incorporated into four carbon acids by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, an enzyme found only in the leaf mp cells. The C4 acids diffuse from mp cells to bs cells, where they are decarboxylated by a photosynthetic malic enzyme. Within bs chloroplasts, the released CO2 is incorporated into the Calvin cycle by ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco), the primary enzyme of photosynthetic carbon fixation. The specialized anatomical framework and compartmentalized reactions of the C4 pathway function as a “CO2 pump” that concentrates CO2 in bs cells, where rubisco is specifically localized (1Hatch M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 81-106Crossref Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 2Kanai R. Edwards G.E. Sage R.F. Monson R.K. C4 Plant Biology.

New Phytol. 2004; 161: 341-370Crossref Scopus (925) Google Scholar). As a result, the carboxylase activity of this enzyme is increased, while its oxygenase activity, which can decrease photosynthetic productivity, is essentially eliminated. This two-cell compartmentalization of carboxylation/decarboxylation reactions does not occur in leaves of the more common C3 plants, which possess only one photosynthetic cell type and use rubisco as the initial enzyme of biological carboxylation. The result is that C4 plants are much more efficient at using biological energy (derived from photosynthetic electron transport) for CO2 fixation, particularly in warm and arid environments where carbon assimilation in C3 plants can be severely limited (1Hatch M.D. Biochim.

In mature C4 leaves, rubisco and other photosynthetic proteins (such as the mp cell-specific phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase) are confined to only one of the two photosynthetic cell types, and transcripts encoding these enzymes are correspondingly bs or mp cell-specific (8Furbank R.T. Taylor W.C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 797-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sheen J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 187-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For this reason, many previous studies have focused on regulation of transcription as the primary determinant of bs and mp cell specificity. In some cases transcriptional control has been demonstrated, and transcriptional regulatory elements involved in determining cell type specificity have been identified (8Furbank R.T. Taylor W.C.

Genes encoding both small and large subunits of the rubisco enzyme (RbcS in the nucleus and rbcL in the plastid) often show patterns of expression that are distinct from other C4 enzymes. For example, in many C4 species RbcS and rbcL genes are initially expressed in all leaf cell types, similar to their expression in C3 plant species (8Furbank R.T. Taylor W.C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 797-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sheen J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 187-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 16Wang J.-L.

Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 289-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To achieve cell type-specific localization of rubisco, which is essential for the function of the C4 pathway, RbcS and rbcL genes become selectively down-regulated in leaf mp cells while continuing to be expressed abundantly in bs cells. This C3-C4 transition in rubisco gene expression occurs during leaf development and is influenced by light and/or photosynthetic metabolism (8Furbank R.T. Taylor W.C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 797-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sheen J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 187-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 17Wang J.-L. Turgeon R.

Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 801-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Some studies have indicated that unlike other C4 enzymes, the initiation of bs cell-specific rubisco gene expression during leaf development and its maintenance in mature leaves of C4 plants is due, at least in part, to post-transcriptional regulation; control of translation and mRNA stability have both been implicated (8Furbank R.T. Taylor W.C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 797-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sheen J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 187-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 19McCormac D.J. Boinski J.J. Ramsperger V.C. Berry J.O.

Of particular significance, transcriptional run-on studies have shown that, while the rubisco mRNAs accumulate only in bs cells of mature C4 leaves, their corresponding genes are transcribed in the nuclei and plastids of both bs and mp cells, suggesting cell type-specific control of transcript stability (9Sheen J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 187-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 21Boinski J.J. Wang J.-L. Xu P. Hotchkis T. Berry J.O. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that untranslated regions (UTRs) from a heterologous rubisco transcript (AhRbcS1 from amaranth, another C4 dicot), in themselves, conferred partial bs cell-specific expression to a gusA reporter gene at the level of mRNA accumulation when transcribed from a constitutive promoter in transgenic F. bidentis plants (22Patel M. Corey A.C. Yin L.-P. Ali S. Taylor W.C. Berry J.O. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3550-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This provided further evidence that post-transcriptional regulation contributes to bs cell-specific gene expression. To better understand the role of post-transcriptional gene expression in determining the bs cell-specific localization of rubisco in C4 leaves, we made use of a rapid and efficient biolostic transient expression assay. For this assay, transcripts with 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) from an F. bidentis RbcS gene (FbRbcS1) were linked in frame with a gfpA reporter gene and placed under the control of a constitutive promoter. When introduced into intact F. bidentis leaves, these constructs produced striking patterns of bs cell-specific GFP fluorescence and transcript localization within the transformed leaf regions. In contrast, gfpA transcripts lacking the FbRbcS1 UTRs produced no cell-type specificity in fluorescence or mRNA localization. Because GFP transcript accumulation, as well as protein accumulation, was found to be highly specific to bs cells in the intact transformed leaves, we conclude that this strong cell type-specific expression occurred at the level of mRNA stability and was mediated by the FbRbcS1 UTRs. Plant Material and Growth Conditions—F. bidentis seedlings were germinated and grown under sterile conditions on Murashige and Skoog media (Sigma) in PlantCon (ICN) growth containers maintained in a growth chamber with 14 h/day illumination at 170-200 mmol photons m-2 s-1. FbRbcS cDNAs—cDNAs of F. bidentis FbRbcS transcripts were prepared by 5′- and 3′-RACE PCR (FirstChoice RLM-RACE Kit, Ambion) according to manufacturers protocols, using primers provided with the kit together with gene-specific primers corresponding to sequences within the FbRbcS coding regions (see supplemental material). 5′-Amplifications (performed under conditions that required the presence of a cap to ensure authentic 5′ ends) revealed the presence of two classes of cDNA, designated FbRbcS1 and FbRbcS2 (accession numbers AY267350 and AY267351, respectively), based on the length and sequence of the 5′-UTRs. Full-length cDNAs were isolated using 5′ end sense primers specific to each class of FbRbcS cDNA, together with a 3′ primer provided with the kit. Primer extension analysis was performed (Promega AMV Reverse Transcriptase-Primer Extension System and manufacturers protocols) using total RNA isolated from F. bidentis leaves and cotyledons, together with a 32P-end-labeled primer corresponding to a conserved region within the FbRbcS1 and FbRbcS2 coding regions. Primer extension products were analyzed using a 6% acrylamide-urea sequencing gel. Post-transcriptional Expression Vectors—The experimental and control expression constructs were carried in the transient expression vector pBI221 (Clonetech), downstream of the CaMV promoter, and upstream of the nopaline synthase transcription terminator. The control transient expression vector CaMV-gfpA was based on the pBI221XS expression cassette described by Patel et al. (22Patel M. Corey A.C. Yin L.-P. Ali S. Taylor W.C. Berry J.O. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3550-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and was created by replacing the β-glucuronidase (gusA) gene located within the SmaI and XhoI restriction sites of that vector, with the gfpA gene. To prepare the FbRbcS1 5′-UTR-gfpA-3′-UTR expression vector, two chimeric gene fragments were initially amplified. The 5′-fragment corresponded to the FbRbcS1 5′-UTR plus the 5′ portion of the gfpA open reading frame and was amplified from a gfpA DNA template (using primers 5GFPFor and GFPRev; supplemental material). The forward primer incorporated a SmaI restriction site at start of the FbRbcS1 5′-UTR. The 3′-fragment was amplified from the FbRbcS1 cDNA template (primers GFP49_3FbFor and G3FbRev; supplemental material) and contained 49 bases from the 3′ end of the gfpA coding sequence, plus the FbRbcS1 3′-UTR and an XhoI site at the 3′ end. These 5′-UTR-gfpA and gfpA3′-UTR fragments overlapped by 49 bases within the gfpA open reading frame. The full-length FbRbcS1 5′-UTR-gfpA-3′-UTR expression cassette was prepared by denaturing and annealing these overlapping fragments and then extending the overlapping DNA strands with Klenow DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The transient expression vector FbRbcS1 5′-UTR-gfpA-3′-UTR was created by replacing the gusA fragment of pBI221XS (22Patel M. Corey A.C. Yin L.-P. Ali S. Taylor W.C. Berry J.O. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3550-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with this expression cassette, using the restriction sites SmaI and XhoI. Biolistic Transformation—Leaves (2-3 cm in length) from 6-week-old F. bidentis plants were detached and placed into a Petri dish lined with H2O-moistened filter paper (Whatman 3MM). Four to five leaves were used per dish. For particle bombardment, gold particles (1.0 μm in size) were washed, prepared, and coated with DNA (either FbRbcS1 5′-UTR-gfpA-3′-UTR or CaMV-gfpA) according to manufacturer's protocols (Biolistic PDS-1000/He Particle Delivery System, Bio-Rad). Leaves were bombarded once at 1100 p.s.i. using a PDS-1000/He Particle Delivery System (Bio-Rad). Each bombardment was performed using 10 μl gold/plasmid DNA suspension, using macrocarriers and stopping plates (Bio-Rad) placed ∼6 cm from the leaves. After bombardment, the leaves were incubated in the dishes with illumination at 25 °C for 16 h and analyzed by microscopy. Microscopy and Tissue Preparation—Following incubation, the bombarded leaves were initially placed on microscope slides over a thin layer of H2O and visually scanned under 4× and 10× objectives of an Axiovert 10 microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), using a 450-490 FT510, LP520 filter system. Localized regions of leaf transformation (foci) showing GFP fluorescence were carefully excised on the microscope stage using a scalpel, and these were used immediately for capturing leaf surface images of the foci and subsequent tissue processing. All of the images shown were captured using a DM IRE2 inverted compound microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with fluorescent and brightfield imaging systems and a Retiga Exi cooled CCD camera (QImaging, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada). Immediately after leaf surface images were taken, the foci were placed either in optimal cutting temperature compound (O.C.T., TissueTek) for cryosectioning or processed for paraffin embedding/sectioning (13Long J.J. Berry J.O. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Wang J.-L. Klessig D.F. Berry J.O.

Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3550-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 10-μm cryosections were prepared using a Reichert-Jung Cryocut 1800 (Leica Microsystems) at 18 °C. 15-μm-thick paraffin-embedded sections were prepared using a rotary microtome and fixed to glass slides treated with Sta-On (Surgipath, Richmond, IL). In Situ Hybridization and Immunolocalization—In situ hybridization analysis of paraffin-embedded sections from GFP-expressing foci was performed as described previously (13Long J.J. Berry J.O. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Wang J.-L. Klessig D.F. Berry J.O. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Patel M. Corey A.C. Yin L.-P. Ali S. Taylor W.C. Berry J.O. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3550-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Sections were hybridized to a gfpA antisense RNA probe that was transcribed in vitro using biotin-16 UTP (Roche Applied Science). Hybridized transcripts were detected using a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (NeutrAvidin; Pierce Chemical) with an enzymatic color reaction (SigmaFast 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium tablets). Immunolocalization analysis on serial paraffin-embedded sections of GFP-expressing foci was performed as described (13Long J.J. Berry J.O. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Wang J.-L. Klessig D.F. Berry J.O. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Patel M. Corey A.C. Yin L.-P. Ali S. Taylor W.C. Berry J.O. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3550-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), using GFP antiserum (Assay Designs, Inc.). Fluorescent imaging of the antibody reactions was performed using biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) together with an R-phycoerythrin/streptavadin conjugate (Molecular Probes). The goal of this investigation was to determine the role of 5′- and 3′-UTRs of a F. bidentis RbcS mRNA in mediating bs cell-specific gene expression in the leaves of a C4 plant. Therefore, to ensure that FbRbcS cDNA used for vector construction contained a full-length 5′-UTR, we used a RACE PCR protocol that required the presence of a 5′-cap. Approximately 100 clones were characterized, some of which contained small variations within their coding regions that identified them as being derived from individual members of an FbRbcS gene family. These comprised two distinct classes, based on the length and sequence of their 5′-UTRs, and by some differences in their 3′-UTRs. FbRbcS1 and FbRbcS2 (supplemental Fig. S1, A and C) are representative of these two classes. Primer extension analysis confirmed that two main classes of FbRbcS mRNA accumulate in F. bidentis in vivo, with 5′ termini corresponding to the 5′ ends of these two classes of cDNA (supplemental Fig. S1B). The post-transcriptional expression construct derived from FbRbcS1 (supplemental Fig. S2) was prepared by linking the full-length 5′- and 3′-UTRs of this transcript (nucleotides 1-26 and 552-735, respectively) in frame with a gfpA reporter gene. To ensure that expression patterns were due entirely to post-transcriptional control, transcription of experimental, as well as control mRNAs (which lacked the FbRbcS1 UTRs, supplemental Fig. S2), was placed under the control of the constitutive CaMV promoter. These were inserted into the plasmid pBI221 for biolistic transformation. Following bombardment, images taken from the leaf surface clearly show bs cell-specific GFP fluorescence within transformed regions (foci) expressing the FbRbcS1 5′-UTR-gfpA-3′-UTR construct (Fig. 1, A-C). These three images show GFP expression that is highly specific to bs cells that surround the leaf veins, with no GFP fluorescence observable outside of a single layer of cells surrounding the leaf vascular centers or within the veins themselves. In contrast, leaves bombarded with a CaMV-gfpA control construct, which lacked the FbRbcS1 UTRs, showed GFP fluorescence distributed throughout all of the cell types observable from the leaf surface (Fig. 1, D-F). Note that for A and D, images taken with a GFP imaging filter system were merged with the corresponding bright-field images, for clear visualization of transformed and untransformed leaf structures (leaf veins and bs cells). Images in other panels were captured using the GFP imaging filters alone and clearly show the differences in fluorescence between GFP-expressing and non-expressing cells. To observe patterns of expression for the FbRbcS1-UTR and control constructs in more detail, cryogenic cross-sections were prepared from GFP-expressing foci that were excised from the intact leaves. Due to higher levels of GFP expression from FbRbcS1-UTR constructs relative to control constructs (similar findings were reported for AhRbcS1-UTR versus control constructs in ref. 22Patel M. Corey A.C. Yin L.-P. Ali S. Taylor W.C. Berry J.O. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3550-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), exposures were adjusted for equal visualization of GFP fluorescence. In cross-sections, the FbRbcS1 5′-UTR-gfpA-3′-UTR construct clearly shows strong bs cell-specific expression (Fig. 2, A-C), whereas the control construct showed expression in all of the leaf cell types (D-F). With both the experimental and control constructs, transformed as well as non-transformed cells were observed within the foci. For example, both GFP-expressing (gbs) and non-expressing (bs) bundle sheath cells are observable in Fig. 2, A-C; expressing and non-expressing examples of all leaf cell types are observable in Fig. 2, D-F. Such cell to cell variations in transformation within a foci were most likely due to the nature of the biolistic protocol, which normally results in random clusters of cell transformations by the DNA-coated biolistic beads. The images in Figs. 1 and 2 are representative of more than 60 independent biolistic transformation events. In all cases, the FbRbcS1 5′-UTR-gfpA-3′-UTR construct produced transformation foci showing strong GFP fluorescence only in bs cells, whereas transformation foci produced by the control construct showed GFP fluorescence in all cell types. Because both experimental and control constructs were transcribed from the same constitutive promoter, we conclude that bs cell-specific GFP expression mediated by the FbRbcS1-UTRs was due to post-transcriptional regulation. In situ hybridizations were performed to determine whether the strong bs cell specificity mediated by the FbRbcS1 UTRs was due to regulation at the level of translation (gfpA mRNA would be present in all transformed cell types) or mRNA stability (gfpA mRNA would be present only in transformed bs cells). It was necessary to use paraffin-embedded sections for in situ localization of GFP mRNAs, since it was not possible to maintain the integrity of frozen sections from biolistically transformed F. bidentis leaf foci through the in situ hybridization procedure. These sections were hybridized to a biotin-labeled GFP antisense RNA probe, and hybridization was detected using streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase and an enzymatic color reaction. Fig. 3, A-C, show representative cross-sections of foci from F. bidentis leaves bombarded with constructs containing the FbRbcS1 5′-UTR-gfpA-3′-UTR construct (all of which showed strong bs cell-specific GFP expression when viewed from the leaf surface). In these images (and in more than 15 additional sections), hybridization to the GFP antisense probe occurred primarily in leaf bs cells; only minimal signal was observed in mp cells of the biolistically transformed leaves. The very low levels of hybridization signal observed in some leaf mp cells was most likely due to low levels of mRNA accumulation from the FbRbcS1 5′-UTR-gfpA-3′-UTR construct, since the GFP antisense probe did not normally produce detectable background signal in non-expressing leaf cells (for example, see Fig. 3, right portion of section shown in F). In contrast, in sections from foci of leaves bombarded with the control construct (all of which showed GFP expression in all cell types when viewed from the leaf surface), hybridization to the GFP antisense probe occurred in all transformed leaf cell types, including bs and mp cells (Fig. 3, E-G). Note that Fig. 3F shows hybridization to a section from near the edge of an excised foci that contains both transformed cells (which showed hybridization to the gfpA probe) and non-transformed cells (which showed no hybridization). This observation is consistent with control hybridization reactions (data not shown) indicating that the gfpA antisense probe did not hybridize to sections from non-transformed F. bidentis leaves under conditions used here. To co-localize GFP mRNA and protein accumulation within the same paraffin-embedded transformed leaf foci, serial sections were reacted with GFP antiserum; imaging of the antibody reactions was performed using an R-phycoerythrin/streptavadin detection system. Fig. 3D (serial section corresponding to 3C) shows the same highly specific pattern of GFP protein accumulation in bs cells that was observed for GFP transcripts. Similarly, GFP protein accumulation in leaf regions bombarded with the control construct (Fig. 3H, serial section corresponding to Fig. 3G) shows the same nonspecific accumulation patterns as the control GFP mRNAs. It should be noted that differences between in situ hybridization versus immunolocalization protocols can lead to slight variations in tissue morphology, accounting for the apparent incomplete overlap between serial sections shown in Fig. 3, D and C and H and G). This current study provides strong evidence for post-transcriptional control of bs cell-specific RbcS gene expression in the leaves of a C4 dicot. Taken together, the data shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3 show that constitutively transcribed reporter gene transcripts containing both 5′- and 3′-UTR regions from endogenous FbRbcS1 mRNAs display strong bs cell-specific patterns of expression in biolistically transformed F. bidentis leaves. Because gfpA transcript accumulation as well as expression of the GFP protein were both highly specific to bs cells, we conclude that this regulation occurred at the level of mRNA stability. This conclusion is supported by initial observations of regenerating F. bidentis T0 plants stably transformed with the FbRbcS1 5′-UTR-gfpA-3′-UTR construct, which also show GFP fluorescence that is highly specific to leaf bs cells in a pattern very similar to the foci shown here. 4M. Patel and J. O. Berry, unpublished data. Findings presented here differ from those of our previous study (22Patel M. Corey A.C. Yin L.-P. Ali S. Taylor W.C. Berry J.O. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3550-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), in which 5′- and 3′-UTRs from heterologous amaranth AhRbcS1 mRNAs conferred only partial bs cell specificity to a gusA reporter gene, a pattern that was also likely mediated by post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA accumulation. The difference in expression patterns between these two systems is likely due to the heterologous origin of the AhRbcS1 5′- and 3′-UTRs sequences (these share 65 and 69% similarity, respectively, with the endogenous FbRbcS1 UTRs, see supplemental Fig. S1, A and C), which might not have been fully recognized by the F. bidentis post-transcriptional regulatory processes, resulting in “leaky” bs cell specificity. In consideration of our current findings, we conclude that 5′- and 3′-UTRs of endogenous F. bidentis RbcS transcripts are capable of mediating strong bs cell-specific protein as well as mRNA accumulation in C4 leaves and thus contain the information needed to generate the bs cell-specific expression patterns that characterize these plants. In initial studies, we have found that neither UTR by itself is capable of mediating bs-specific gfp expression, suggesting that interactions between the 5′- and 3′-UTRs may be required for this process. Rubisco genes are known to be highly regulated; in many plants their expression is modulated by light (18Wang J.-L. Long J.J. Hotchkiss T. Berry J.O.

While regulation of transcription has been implicated in some of these processes, post-transcriptional control is often a primary regulatory determinant (21Boinski J.J. Wang J.-L. Xu P. Hotchkis T.

This current study indicates that post-transcriptional control was utilized as a primary mechanism when RbcS gene expression was adapted for the specialized cell-type specific expression that provides the foundation for the C4 pathway in F. bidentis leaves. Post-transcriptional regulation of FbRbcS1 transcript accumulation would appear to be fully sufficient for mediating bs cell-specific gene expression. However, additional regulatory mechanisms might also contribute to this process in F. bidentis and other C4 systems. Separate studies from our laboratory and others have also implicated regulation of transcription and translation in determining bs cell-specificity (8Furbank R.T. Taylor W.C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 797-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sheen J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 187-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 19McCormac D.J.

Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For example, bs cell-specific localization of the rubisco proteins is separable from the specific localization of their corresponding transcripts in amaranth leaves during specific stages of leaf or photosynthetic development, implicating regulation at the level of translation (19McCormac D.J. Boinski J.J. Ramsperger V.C. Berry J.O. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 801-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Ramsperger V.C. Summers R.G. Berry J.O. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, the establishment of full bs cell-specific RbcS gene expression in C4 leaves might in fact result from the integration of multiple levels of regulation. Each mechanism could act independently during different developmental stages (as in Refs. 19McCormac D.J. Boinski J.J. Ramsperger V.C. Berry J.O. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 801-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar and 20Ramsperger V.C. Summers R.G. Berry J.O. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or perhaps at some times in synergy, ultimately leading to full bs cell-specific localization of the rubisco proteins. Emerging evidence suggests that close interactions between different phases of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation may be a common occurrence in eukaryotic gene expression (33Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Such redundancy and overlap for mechanisms determining bs cell specificity would ensure that full C4 photosynthetic capacity occurs in the leaves of these plants, at all stages of development and under diverse environmental conditions. A less likely alternative explanation for bs cell-specific localization of FbRbcS1 mRNA is that sequences within the UTRs have an effect on transcriptional elongation. Inhibition or termination of transcription by downstream control elements is known to occur in eukaryotic viruses and more rarely in cellular genes (in both plants and animals; Refs. 34Wright S. Mol.

Measurements of gfpA mRNA transcription and turnover in stable transgenic F. bidentis lines will provide mechanistic details about UTR-mediated control of bs cell-specific FbRbcS1 mRNA accumulation. Direct evidence that bs cell specificity is controlled by sequences within the FbRbcS1 UTRs will focus future C4 studies (38Brown N.J. Parsley K. Hibberd J.M.

RbcS mRNAs from the C4 dicots F. bidentis and amaranth contain multiple AU-rich elements within their 3′-UTR (supplemental Fig. S1C); interestingly, one of these repeats, UUUAUU, is identical to a repeat in human mRNAs that become destabilized when this sequence interacts with a specific class of RNA binding protein (46Blackshear P.J.

Identification of regulatory sequences within the RbcS 5′- and 3′-UTRs, as well as the RNA-binding proteins they interact with, will aid in the functional analysis of specific molecular recognition processes responsible for post-transcriptional, bs cell-specific transcript accumulation in C4 leaves.

Agrobacterium tumefaciens has two phytochromes, Agp1 and Agp2, with antagonistic properties: in darkness, Agp1 converts slowly from Pfr to Pr, whereas Agp2 converts slowly from Pr to Pfr. In a previous study, we have assembled Agp1 with synthetic locked chromophores 15Za, 15Zs, 15Ea, and 15Es in which the C15=C16 double bond is fixed in either the E or Z configuration and the C14–C15 single bond is fixed in either the syn (s) or anti (a) conformation. In the present study, the locked chromophores 5Za and 5Zs were used for assembly with Agp1; in these chromophores, the C4=C5 double bond is fixed in the Z configuration, and the C5–C6 single bond is fixed in either the syn or anti conformation. All locked chromophores were also assembled with Agp2. The data showed that in both phytochromes the Pr chromophore adopts a C4=C5 Z C5–C6 syn C15=C16 Z C14–C15 anti stereochemistry and that in the Pfr chromophore the C15=C16 double bond has isomerized to the E configuration, whereas the C14–C15 single bond remains in the anti conformation. Photoconversion shifted the absorption maxima of the 5Zs adducts to shorter wavelengths, whereas the 5Za adducts were shifted to longer wavelengths. Thus, the C5–C6 single bond of the Pfr chromophore is rather in an anti conformation, supporting the previous suggestion that during photoconversion of phytochromes, a rotation around the ring A-B connecting single bond occurs.

Depending on the species, phytochromes bind one of three bilins as a chromophore: land plants utilize phytochromobilin (PΦB) (2Rüdiger W. Thümmler F. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 51-59Crossref Google Scholar), cyanobacteria use phycocyanobilin (PCB) (3Hübschmann T. Börner T.

Whereas plant and cyanobacterial phytochromes use a cysteine in the so-called GAF domain of the protein as chromophore attachment site (2Rüdiger W. Thümmler F. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 51-59Crossref Google Scholar), the chromophore-binding cysteine of BV-binding phytochromes is close to the N terminus of the protein (8Lamparter T.

NMR studies with plant phytochromes showed that the chromophore undergoes isomerization around the double bond connecting the rings C and D during photoconversion from Pr to Pfr (11Rüdiger W. Thümmler F. Cmiel E. Schneider S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The configuration of this double bond is Z in the Pr and E in the Pfr form. Time-resolved spectroscopy techniques show that this Z-E isomerization, leading to the lumi-R photoproduct, takes place on a picosecond time scale (12Rentsch S. Hermann G. Bischoff M. Strehlow D.

Later intermediates, termed meta-Ra, meta-Rb, and meta-Rc, as well as the photoproduct Pfr are formed in the microsecond and millisecond time frame (14Borucki B. von Stetten D. Seibeck S. Lamparter T. Michael N. Mroginski M.A. Otto H. Murgida D.H. Heyn M.P. Hildebrandt P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11460-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For the reverse photoreaction from Pfr to Pr, a scheme starting with the formation of lumi-F, which is formed by a rapid C15=C16 E to Z isomerization followed by intermediates, has been proposed (16Eilfeld P. Rüdiger W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C J. Biosci. 1985; 40: 109-114Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Chen E. Lapko V.N. Lewis J.W. Song P.S. Kliger D.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Most information on the configuration and conformation of the chromophore is available for the Pr form for which a clear picture has been obtained recently from the crystal structure of the chromophore-binding domain of Deinococcus phytochrome DrBphP (10Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). However, detailed knowledge of configurational and conformational changes of the chromophore that are reflected by spectral changes is lacking. Four different synthetic locked chromophores, in which the rings C and D are held in a fixed orientation by an additional carbon chain, have been assembled with phytochrome Agp1 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (18Inomata K. Hammam M.A.S. Kinoshita H. Murata Y. Khawn H. Noack S. Michael N. Lamparter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24491-24497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In these chromophores, termed 15Za, 15Zs, 15Ea, and 15Es, the double bond is either in the Z or E configuration, and the single bond is either in the syn (s) or anti (a) conformation. All chromophores were incorporated into the protein and formed covalently linked photostable adducts. UV/visible spectra of the 15Za adduct were comparable with the Pr form of BV-Agp1, whereas the 15Ea adduct resembled the Pfr form. Both the 15Zs and 15Es adducts absorbed only in the blue region of visible light. These data show that the C15=C16 double bond switches from the Z to the E configuration upon photoconversion from Pr to Pfr, which is in line with previous assumptions, and that the C14–C15 single bond has an anti conformation throughout the entire photocycle (18Inomata K.

The latter notion is in contrast with former studies that predicted a rotation around the C14–C15 single bond during Pr to Pfr conversion (19Andel F.I. Murphy J.T. Haas J.A. McDowell M.T. van der Hoef I. Lugtenburg J. Lagarias J.C. Mathies R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 14: 2667-2676Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar) but in line with recent density functional theory calculations combined with resonance Raman spectroscopy (20Mroginski M.A. Murgida D.H. von Stetten D. Kneip C. Mark F. Hildebrandt P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16734-16735Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the chromophore-binding domain of Deinococcus phytochrome shows that a rotation around the C14–C15 single bond would be hindered by the surrounding amino acids and supports the anti conformation of the C14–C15 single bond in both the Pr and Pfr forms. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and phosphorylation studies showed that the 15Za and 15Ea adducts adopt a protein conformation that is comparable with the Pr and Pfr forms of the BV adduct, respectively (18Inomata K. Hammam M.A.S. Kinoshita H. Murata Y. Khawn H. Noack S. Michael N. Lamparter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24491-24497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Direct information on the configuration of the C4=C5 and C9=C10 double bonds has been lacking. Most researchers have predicted that the C4=C5 double bond is always in the Z configuration, whereas both E and Z configurations have been proposed for the C9=C10 double bond (20Mroginski M.A. Murgida D.H. von Stetten D. Kneip C. Mark F. Hildebrandt P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16734-16735Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Andel F. Lagarias J.C. Mathies R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15997-16008Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The crystal structure showed that in the Pr form both double bonds are in the Z configuration. Conflicting results have also been obtained for the conformation of the C5–C6 single bond. The interpretation of the resonance Raman spectra of plant phytochromes by density functional theory calculations suggested an anti conformation in the Pr and a syn conformation in the Pfr form (20Mroginski M.A. Murgida D.H. von Stetten D. Kneip C. Mark F. Hildebrandt P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16734-16735Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The crystal structure showed that in the Pr form of DrBphP, this single bond is in the syn conformation. As noted above, plant phytochromes (with a PΦB chromophore) and BV-binding phytochromes have different chromophore attachment sites. The ring A ethylidene or vinyl side chain, respectively, is involved in covalent bond formation. The crystal structure predicts that the position of both chromophore-binding cysteines would be on opposite sides of the side chains. It could therefore be that in the Pr form of phytochromes both C5–C6 conformations are realized: syn for BV-binding and anti for PCB- and PΦB-binding species. However, the conformation of the C5–C6 single bond of plant phytochromes has still to be established. Whether or not photoconversion involves a rotation around the C5–C6 single bond, as evidenced by density functional theory calculations (20Mroginski M.A. Murgida D.H. von Stetten D. Kneip C. Mark F. Hildebrandt P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16734-16735Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), is also unclear. Whereas Agp1 of A. tumefaciens converts from Pfr to Pr in darkness, a feature well known from many plant phytochromes, the second phytochrome of A. tumefaciens, Agp2, converts from Pr to Pfr in darkness (22Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Such a property has also been found for three other BV-binding phytochromes from the bacteria Bradyrhizobium sp. (23Giraud E. Fardoux J. Fourrier N. Hannibal L. Genty B. Bouyer P. Dreyfus B. Vermeglio A. Nature. 2002; 417: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), Rhodopseudomonas palustris (24Giraud E. Zappa S. Jaubert M. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Adriano J.M. Bouyer P. Genty B. Pignol D. Vermeglio A. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 587-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25Tasler R. Moises T. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1927-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Physiological evidence suggests that a similar phytochrome exists in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum (26Starostzik C. Marwan W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Based on spectral similarities, it may be predicted that the dark conversion of these phytochromes is initiated by the same C15=C16 Z-E isomerization as during photoconversion from Pr to Pfr of typical phytochromes, but direct evidence is lacking. In free bilins, the ZZZ configuration is the thermodynamically stable configuration (27Falk H. The Chemistry of Linear Oligopyrroles and Bile Pigments. Springer Verlag, Berlin, Germany1989Crossref Google Scholar, 28Lamparter T. Michael N. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8461-8469Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Within a small group of phytochromes, the protein environment seems to make the C15=C16 E configuration thermodynamically more favorable. To see whether and how locked chromophores are incorporated into Agp2, the set of the above mentioned chromophores was also tested with purified recombinant Agp2. For analyses on the stereochemistry of the C5–C6 single bond, new locked 5Za and 5Zs chromophores were used for assembly with Agp1 and Agp2. These studies provided deeper insight into the similarities and differences between a more conventional phytochrome and a phytochrome that converts to Pfr in darkness and give further clues for the understanding of chromophore stereochemistry in the ground state and during photoconversion. Expression and Purification of Agrobacterium Phytochromes Agp1 and Agp2—An Escherichia coli expression vector termed pAG1 was used for full-length Agp1. pAG1 encodes for the Agp1 protein with a C-terminal polyhistidine tag for Ni2+ affinity purification (8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For recombinant Agp2, a pET21b (Novagen)-derived expression vector as described in Ref. 28Lamparter T. Michael N. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8461-8469Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar was used. The vector was modified to encode for a C-terminal His-tagged protein; expression, purification, and assembly were performed as for Agp1. Another expression vector, pAG1-M15, encodes for the N-terminal 504 amino acids and a His tag (29Scheerer P. Michael N. Park J.H. Noack S. Förster C. Hammam M.A.S. Inomata K. Choe H.W. Lamparter T. Krauss N. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 153: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The expressed protein is termed Agp1-M15. For expression and purification of Agp1, Agp1-M15, and Agp2 apoproteins, we followed the same procedure as described previously (8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In brief, E. coli cells harboring the expression plasmid were grown in rich broth medium. Specific protein expression was induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the cells were disrupted with a French pressure cell. Soluble proteins were purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography and by preparative SEC. The SEC was performed in “basic buffer” (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/Cl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.8). The final apoprotein concentration was ∼15 mg/ml. At this stage, the protein was stored at –80 °C. Synthesis of Bilin Derivatives—BV was purchased from Frontier Scientific (Carnforth, UK). Synthesis of 18-ethyl-BV (18EtBV) was performed according to the protocols published for PΦB, PCB, and PCB derivatives (30Kakiuchi T. Kato H. Jayasundera K.P. Higashi T. Watabe K. Sawamoto D.

Syntheses of 5Za (UV/visible (MeOH) λmax 383 (ϵ = 12,633), 644 (ϵ = 11,067), 719 (ϵ = 7,533) nm) and 5Zs (UV/visible (MeOH) λmax 389 (ϵ = 26,533), 637 (ϵ = 8,333) nm) will be published elsewhere. Bilin stock solutions of ∼1 mm concentration, judged from the weight of the dissolved solid compounds, were prepared in Me2SO and stored at –80 °C. The exact concentration of each stock solution was estimated by UV/visible spectroscopy. Assembly and UV/Visible Spectroscopy—UV/visible spectra were recorded as before (8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) at 18 °C. The concentration of apoproteins was estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm. A precise concentration of the bilin stock solution was estimated from the absorbance of the diluted solution of an aliquot in MeOH based on the corresponding molecular extinction coefficient (ϵ) of each locked chromophore described above. For assembly studies, the apoprotein was diluted with basic buffer to a final concentration of ∼10 μm and pipetted into a measuring cuvette. After addition of 1 mm (final concentration) tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, chromophore was added from the Me2SO stock solution to a final concentration of ∼5 μm; the sample was mixed rapidly for 30 s. Immediately after mixing, a spectrum was recorded from 900 to 250 nm; the duration of the scan was ∼1 min. Nine further spectra were recorded in 5-min intervals. Series of 10 spectra with various time intervals were recorded until absorbance changes were apparently complete. The time intervals between subsequent measurements were 10, 30, and 60 min for the second, third, and fourth measuring series. To analyze whether chromophores are covalently bound to the protein, apoprotein and chromophore were mixed as above and incubated until assembly was complete. Thereafter, SDS was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the sample was incubated again for 10 min. The mixture was passed over a desalting column as described previously (8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). From a comparison of absorption spectra before and after column separation, the amount of covalently bound chromophore can be estimated. For photoconversion of Pr to Pfr or Pr to Pnr (the nearred-absorbing form), the samples were irradiated with red light from a light-emitting diode (λmax = 655 nm; half-bandwidth = 40 nm); the light intensity was 135 μmol m–2 s–1 at the position of the cuvette. For photoconversion of Pfr to Pr, the sample was irradiated with a 785 nm laser diode (RLD-78MA, Sanyo; half-bandwidth = 10 nm); the light intensity was 70 μmol m–2 s–1 at the position of the cuvette. For irradiations with orange light, the light beam of a halogen projector was passed through an AL interference filter (Schott, Mainz, Germany; λmax = 608 nm; half-bandwidth = 40 nm); the light intensity was 45 μmol m–2 s–1 at the position of the cuvette. Dark reversion and photocon-version kinetics were measured with the time drive program of the photometer in which the measuring wavelength was set to λmax of the Q-band of the Pr form (around 700 nm). The initial rate of back-conversion in darkness or under illumination was estimated from the derivative. This value was divided by the initial light-induced absorbance change of a dark-assembled sample, i.e. the value that corresponds to the concentration of the photoproduct. Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography—The Agp1-M15 apoprotein (10 μm) was mixed with BV, 5Za, or 5Zs (∼15 μm) and incubated for ∼3 h. The adducts were used either unirradiated (“Pr”) or after saturating red irradiation (“Pfr”). Analytical SEC was carried out in darkness on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (18Inomata K. Hammam M.A.S. Kinoshita H. Murata Y. Khawn H. Noack S. Michael N. Lamparter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24491-24497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The elution was monitored at 280 nm. Chromophores that were used in the present study are shown in Fig. 1. BV, which is the natural chromophore of A. tumefaciens phytochromes, was used as control. The synthetic derivative 18EtBV was used as a second control. This compound is distinguished from BV by the side chain at C18 position of the bilin skeleton, which is an ethyl group in the former and a vinyl group in the latter. For technical reasons, the locked chromophores have also an ethyl group at C18. The nomenclature of the locked chromophores is also given in Fig. 1. The number 5 or 15 stands for the carbon atom of the methine bridge, which is held in a sterically fixed orientation by an additional carbon chain; the first letter stands for the configuration of the methine bridge double bond; and the second letter stands for the conformation of the single bond (s for syn and a for anti). Both phytochromes of A. tumefaciens, which are termed Agp1 and Agp2 (or AtBphP1 and AtBphP2 by other groups), were used for studies on chromophore assembly and photoconversion. The chromophores 15Za, 15Zs, 15Ea, and 15Es have been tested with Agp1 in a previous study (18Inomata K. Hammam M.A.S. Kinoshita H. Murata Y. Khawn H. Noack S. Michael N. Lamparter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24491-24497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The present work extends the Agp1 studies by 5Za and 5Zs. In addition, the “unusual” phytochrome Agp2 was also assembled with all presently available locked chromophores. Assembly of Agp1 with 5Za and 5Zs—Fig. 2 shows series of UV/visible spectra that were measured during 51 min after mixing Agp1 apoprotein with 5Za (Fig. 2a) and 5Zs (Fig. 2b) in comparison with the spectra of the free chromophores. For both 5Za and 5Zs, absorption changes were observed that are characteristic for chromophore assembly and show that these compounds are also incorporated into the chromophore pocket. The absorption maxima of the 5Za and 5Zs adducts were at 672 and 692 nm, respectively. In Fig. 3, the time courses of absorbance values are presented together with the values obtained with those chromophores that had already been analyzed in the previous study (18Inomata K. Hammam M.A.S. Kinoshita H. Murata Y. Khawn H. Noack S. Michael N. Lamparter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24491-24497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This comparison shows that the 5Za assembly is faster than the 5Zs assembly and that both chromophores assemble faster than 15Ea but slower than BV, 18EtBV, 15Za, 15Zs, and 15Es. After an incubation time of 2 h, both the 5Za and 5Zs chromophores were covalently bound to the protein as judged by desalting column tests with SDS-treated holoprotein (data not shown).FIGURE 3Time course of absorbance changes during assembly of Agp1 with all chromophores given in Fig. 1. The values for 5Za and 5Zs were taken from spectra as given in Fig. 2, and the values for 15Z/Ea/s are from spectra that were published previously (18Inomata K. Hammam M.A.S. Kinoshita H. Murata Y.

Phytochrome photoconversion is initiated by a Z to E isomerization around the C15=C16 double bond, which is not possible in these adducts. In the 5Za and 5Zs adducts, this isomerization is not hindered. Therefore, irradiation should result in absorption changes. After irradiating the 5Za adduct with red light, the absorbance around 672 nm was reduced, accompanied by an increase in the longer wavelength region and a band broadening in the wavelength region around 370 nm (Fig. 4b). Obviously the Pr-like form converts partially into a Pfr-like form, which absorbs at higher wavelengths and has a rather low extinction coefficient. Irradiation of the 5Zs adduct resulted in a shift of the maximum by 56 nm toward shorter wavelengths (from 692 to 636 nm) and a reduction of absorbance in that spectral region (Fig. 4c). Thus, photoconversion shifts the absorption maximum of this adduct to the opposite direction than the adducts with BV (18Inomata K. Hammam M.A.S. Kinoshita H. Murata Y. Khawn H. Noack S. Michael N. Lamparter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24491-24497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), 18EtBV (Fig. 4a) and 5Za (Fig. 4b). Light-induced absorbance changes of 5Zs-Agp1 closely resemble those of the unusual bacteriophytochrome BphP3 of R. palustris in which the absorption maximum shifts by 60 nm from 705 to 645 nm upon irradiation (37Giraud E. Vuillet L. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Zappa S. Adriano J.M. Berthomieu C. Bouyer P. Pignol D. Verméglio A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32389-32397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The photoproduct of RpBphP3 has been denominated “Pnr” where “nr” stands for “near-red” light. In accordance with this nomenclature, we also denominate the photoproduct of the Agp1–5Zs adduct as Pnr. It has been shown that BV-Agp1 converts from Pfr to Pr in darkness and that the quantum yield of the light-induced Pfr to Pr conversion is rather low (8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In the present study, we performed comparative measurements on dark reversion and light-induced back-conversion with BV-Agp1, 18EtBV-Agp1, 5Za-Agp1, and 5Zs-Agp1 (Table 1). The initial rate of dark reversion of the BV adduct was 2.2 10–3 s–1; the initial rate of Pfr to Pr conversion under rather strong 785 nm light was about twice as high as that of the dark reversion.TABLE 1Summary of dark reversion and photoconversion of Agp1 adductsChromophoreDirection of dark reversionLight sources for photoconversionInitial rate of reversionIn darknessWith lights-1BVFrom Pfr to PrPr to Pfr photoconversion with 655 nm; back-conversion with 785 nm2.2·10-34.7·10-318EtBVFrom Pfr to PrPr to Pfr photoconversion with 655 nm; back-conversion with 785 nm1.6·10-45.8·10-45ZaFrom Pfr-like to PrPr to Pfr-like photoconversion with 655 nm; back-conversion wi"

Here, we analyzed the role of the eukaryote-specific Nug1 N-domain (Nug1-N). We show that the essential Nug1-N is sufficient and necessary for nucle(ol)ar targeting and association with pre-60 S particles. Nug1-N exhibits RNA binding activity and is genetically linked in an allele-specific way to the pre-60 S factors Noc2, Noc3, and Dbp10. In contrast, the middle domain, which exhibits a circularly permuted GTPase fold and an intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity in vitro, is not essential for cell growth. The conserved Nug1 C-domain, which has a yet uncharacterized fold, is also essential for ribosome biogenesis. Our findings suggest that Nug1 associates with pre-60 S subunits via its essential N-terminal RNA-binding domain and exerts a non-essential regulative role in pre-60 S subunit biogenesis via its central GTPase domain.

Ribosome synthesis in eukaryotic cells is a strictly coordinated multistep process. It requires transcription by the three RNA polymerases to generate the pre-rRNAs (by polymerase I and polymerase III) and mRNAs (by polymerase II) that encode the ribosomal proteins and the non-ribosomal factors involved in ribosome biogenesis. Concomitant to transcription, early trans-acting factors together with small nucleolar ribonucleoparticles and ribosomal proteins are recruited to the 35 S pre-rRNA to form the 90 S pre-ribosome/small subunit processome (1Dragon F. Gallagher J.E. Compagnone-Post P.A. Mitchell B.M. Porwancher K.A. Wehner K.A. Wormsley S. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J. Osheim Y. Beyer A.L. Hunt D.F. Baserga S.J.

Within this early 90 S pre-ribosome intermediate, various rRNA modification/processing events occur, including methylation, pseudouridylation, and cleavage of pre-rRNA at sites A0 and A1. Subsequently, cleavage at site A2 leads to a splitting of the 90 S precursor particle yielding the earliest pre-40 S and pre-60 S subunits (reviewed in Refs. 3Kressler D. Linder P. de La Cruz J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7897-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar and 4Venema J. Tollervey D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Depending on the growth state, the latter cleavage can occur co-transcriptionally or post-trancriptionally in yeast (5Osheim Y.N. French S.L. Keck K.M. Champion E.A. Spasov K. Dragon F. Baserga S.J. Beyer A.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 943-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Upon further maturation, nearly all 90 S factors dissociate, and a small number of new factors are recruited (6Schäfer T. Strauss D. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The derived nuclear pre-40 S particle contains Rps proteins, 20 S pre-rRNA, and a few non-ribosomal factors. Lastly, the pre-40 S particle is exported to cytoplasm, where final maturation of the 40 S subunit takes place. In contrast, the early nucleolar pre-60 S particles contain a huge number of factors (∼40-50), among which are methyltransferases, RNA helicases, ATPases, and GTPases (7Nissan T.A. Bassler J. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5539-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Subsequent maturation steps include processing of the 27 S rRNA into 25 S and 5.8 S rRNA, incorporation of 5 S rRNA and transport of the pre-60 S subunit to the nucleoplasm. During these processes, the composition of the particles is simplified until export competence is achieved by recruitment of export factors including Nmd3 and Mtr2 and possibly others (7Nissan T.A. Bassler J. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5539-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). It is assumed that the heterotrimeric Nmd3-Xpo1-RanGTP complex, which assembles onto the transport-competent pre-60 S subunit, mediates export through the nuclear pore complex into the cytoplasm. Subsequently, the late non-ribosomal factors dissociate from the 60 S subunit by mechanisms, which also involve GTPases (8Hedges J. West M. Johnson A.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Significant insight into the formation and transport of preribosomal particles has been achieved over the past several years (for review, see Refs. 9Tschochner H. Hurt E.

Due to extensive proteomic analyses of pre-ribosomal particles, the vast majority of nonribosomal factors involved in ribosome synthesis have been identified, and their approximate site of action is beginning to be understood. Moreover, the structural organization of a few pre-ribosomal particles has been determined by electron microscopy (12Nissan T.A. Galani K. Maco B. Tollervey D. Aebi U. Hurt E. Mol.

Notably, structural rearrangement of a late pre-40 S particle was followed during in vitro maturation and was found to be dependent upon phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events (13Schäfer T.

Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Here, we studied one member of these putative GTPases, Nug1. We found that the essential N-terminal Nug1 domain targets Nug1 to the nucleolus/nucleus, mediates association with pre-60 S particles, and exhibits RNA binding activity. In contrast, the middle part of Nug1, which comprises the GTPase fold, is not essential for cell growth and thus may fulfill a redundant role with other GTPases involved in ribosome biogenesis. Plasmids, Strains, DNA Recombinant Work, and Microbiological Techniques—Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Tables 1 and 2. Double knockout strains were generated as described previously (20Strässer K. Bassler J. Hurt E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). DNA recombinant work was done according to (21Maniatis T. Fritsch E.T. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) using Escherichia coli strain DH5α. Live Cell Imaging—Prior to imaging, cells were grown in SDC-leu liquid medium (30 °C) until logarithmic phase. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Imager Z1 (Carl Zeiss) with a ×100 NA 1.4 Plan-Apo-Chromat Oil immersion lens (Carl Zeiss) and DICIII, HE-EGFP, or HE-Cy3 filter set, respectively. Pictures were acquired with an AxioCamMRm camera (Carl Zeiss) and software AxioVision 4.3 (Carl Zeiss) at resolution 1388 × 1040 (Binning 1 × 1, gain factor 1). Pictures were exported as jpg files and processed in PhotoShop 7.0 for gray levels. GTP Hydrolysis Assays—Recombinant GST-TEV-Nug1 or GST-TEV-Nug1-4G mutant was expressed from E. coli Star+, purified via GST affinity purification, and eluted by incubation with TEV protease. GST-Nug1-4G is a mutant of Nug1, in which the G1 consensus motif GKSS was mutated to 4 glycines (GGGG). Eluted proteins were further purified by ion exchange chromatography (MonoS/GE Healthcare) and gel filtration (Superdex™ 200/GE Healthcare) and concentrated using ULTRAFREE 0.5 with Biomax-10K NMWL membrane (Millipore). Cell lysis buffer contained 100 mm KOAc, 400 mm NH4Cl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Subsequent purification steps were performed in the same buffer with 200 mm NH4Cl. For the GTPase assay, the purified protein was incubated with [γ-32P]GTP at 30 °C. To stop the reaction, SDS was added. The cleaved radioactive [γ-32P]phosphate was separated by thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography. Kinetic analysis of Nug1-mediated GTP hydrolysis was performed using a colorimetric assay according to Ref. 22Fiske L.M. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-389Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar. Purified Nug1 (80 μl) was mixed with 20 μl of various concentrations GTP to obtain 16-30 μm Nug1 and 0.4, 1, 2, 4, or 10 mm GTP and incubated at 30 °C. Aliquots (15 μl) were taken in 45-min intervals, and the reaction was stopped by freezing in liquid N2. The amount of hydrolyzed phosphate was determined by incubation with 885 μl of malachite green solution (0.3 g of malachite green, 2 g of ammonium molybdate, 0.5 g of Triton in 1 liter of 1 n HCl). The colorimetric reaction was terminated after 3 min by adding 100 μl of sodium citrate (34 g/100 ml). Finally, A600 was measured after a 30-90-min incubation. The catalytic constant was derived from kcat = vmax/cNug1. vmax was calculated using a Lineweaver-Burk plot, and cNug1 was determined by A280 in a NanoDrop© 1000 spectrophotometer. RNA-Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—Nug1-N was incubated with RNase during incubation with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). Subsequently, Nug1-N was eluted by imidazole and applied to a gel filtration column containing Superdex™-200 (Amersham Biosciences). All purification steps were performed in buffer containing 50 mm KOAc, 100 mm NH4Cl, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgOAc2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. In vitro transcription of 5 S RNA was performed using linearized plasmid DNA carrying the 5 S rRNA gene under the control of T7 promoter (pET9D-5 S-RNA). Total yeast tRNA was purchased from Sigma. RNA binding assays were performed at room temperature (23 °C) in protein purification buffer. Samples were analyzed by loading on 8% polyacrylamide gels (0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA) containing ethidium bromide to visualize RNA under UV light. Miscellaneous—The following published methods were applied: three-hybrid interactions on SDC-trp-leu-ura-his+5 mm 3-AT (23Bernstein D.S. Buter N. Stumpf C. Wickens M. Methods. 2002; 26: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), sedimentation analysis (14Bassler J. Grandi P. Gadal O. Lessmann T. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Lechner J. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), affinity purification of tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged Nug1 constructs (24Rigaut G.

Domain Analysis of the Nug1 Protein—Inspection of primary amino acid sequence suggests that Nug1 consists of three domains (Fig. 1 and supplemental figure Fig. S1). An N-terminal domain (residues 1-154), which is conserved within the Nug1 orthologues (nucleostemin family), a middle domain (residues 155-344), which has a highly conserved GTPase fold with permutated G1-5 motifs and a conserved C-terminal domain (residues 345-520) lacking known motifs. The protein fold of the latter two domains most likely resembles the prokaryotic RbgA fold, whose x-ray structure is known (see “Discussion”). To determine whether all three domains of Nug1 are essential for cell growth, a deletion analysis was performed (Fig. 1A). In the case of the N-domain, removal of the first 37 amino acids (nug1-ΔN1) exhibited a slightly reduced growth rate, whereas deletion of the first 100 amino acids or the entire N-domain caused a lethal phenotype (nug1-ΔN; Fig. 1A). In the case of the C-terminal domain, deletion of the last 52 non-conserved residues did not affect the growth rate, but further (last 116 amino acids) or complete deletion of the conserved C-domain (last 176 amino acids; nug1-ΔC) resulted in lethality (data not shown and Fig. 1A). Unexpectedly, deletion of the M-domain containing the GTPase fold resulted only in a slightly reduced growth rate (nug1-ΔM; Fig. 1A). In contrast, deletion of the M-domain in the homologous putative GTPase Nug2 (Fig. 1B) or point mutations in the GTPase motifs caused lethality (15Saveanu C. Bienvenu D. Namane A. Gleizes P.E. Gas N. Jacquier A. Fromont-Racine M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6475-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the putative Nug1 GTPase has essential N- and C-domains, which enclose the central but nonessential putative GTPase domain. Purified Nug1 Exhibits GTPase Activity—The finding that the Nug1 middle domain with a predicted GTPase fold is not essential for growth prompted us to test for Nug1 GTPase activity. Thus, we expressed GST-tagged Nug1 in E. coli and purified it via GSH affinity, ionic exchange, and gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2A). As a negative control, we purified in the same manner GST-Nug1-4G that is a mutant form of Nug1, containing an inactive Walker A motif (see “Experimental Procedures”). This Nug1-4G construct was expected to be inactive in GTP hydrolysis. The purified GST-tagged Nug1 and Nug1-4G proteins were tested in vitro for GTP hydrolysis activity by incubation with γ-32P-labeled GTP. The release of [γ-32P]phosphate was followed by thin layer chromatography in combination with autoradiography (Fig. 2B). This analysis revealed that purified recombinant Nug1 exhibits a distinct GTPase activity (Fig. 2B), which is largely abolished in the Nug1-4G mutant. Thus, it is likely that Nug1 has GTP hydrolysis activity in vivo. For further characterization of the Nug1 GTPase activity, we determined the enzymatic parameters using a colorimetric assay (22Fiske L.M. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-389Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Purified Nug1 was incubated with various concentrations (0.2-10 mm) of GTP, and the amount of generated PO43− was determined (see “Experimental Procedures”). Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis revealed a Km of 0.2 mm ± 0.1 mm and kcat of 0.11 min-1 ± 0.01 min-1 for the GTP hydrolysis reaction (“Experimental Procedures”). Notably, for E. coli RsgA (a Nug1 homolog), similar kinetic parameters for the intrinsic GTPase activity were reported (26Daigle D.M. Rossi L. Berghuis A.M. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Brown E.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11109-11117Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Himeno H. Hanawa-Suetsugu K. Kimura T. Takagi K. Sugiyama W. Shirata S. Mikami T. Odagiri F. Osanai Y. Watanabe D. Goto S. Kalachnyuk L. Ushida C. Muto A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5303-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We conclude from our studies that purified Nug1 has an intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity (see “Discussion”). Trans-complementation by the Various Nug1 Domains—In the course of our studies, we found that N-terminal truncations of Nug1 could be rescued by co-expression of an intact N-domain. Therefore, we tested whether the essential Nug1 domains, when separated from each other but co-expressed in the same cell, would allow for trans-complementation. Co-expression of the split N-domain together with the Nug1-ΔN construct revealed efficient complementation of the otherwise lethal nug1 null mutant (Fig. 1C). Moreover, co-expression of the C-domain together with the Nug1-ΔC construct could complement the nug1 null mutant (Fig. 1C). This suggests that the various Nug1 domains perform unique but overlapping functions. The Nug1-N Domain Exhibits Nucle(ol)ar Targeting and Pre-ribosome Binding Properties—To determine how the three Nug1 domains contribute to nuclear and/or nucleolar targeting and association with pre-60 S particles, we tagged the individual domains or various combinations of them (ΔN, ΔM, ΔC) with either EGFP or TAP and analyzed their subcellular location and association with pre-60 S particles. The EGFP-tagged Nug1-N domain, as well as the Nug1-ΔC and Nug1-ΔM constructs, localized to the nucleolus/nucleoplasm with a distribution that is similar to that of the endogenous Nug1 (Fig. 3). The nucleolar localization of these constructs was confirmed by colocalization with the nucleolar marker Nop1 tagged with mRFP. Interestingly, expression of fragments that lacked the N-domain (e.g. Nug1-ΔN) revealed a predominantly cytoplasmic location with a weak nuclear signal (Fig. 3). Altogether the data suggest that the N-domain of Nug1 when attached to a reporter protein can mediate nucle(ol)ar localization. To further delimit the nucle(ol)ar targeting signal, the first 39 amino acids of the N-domain, which is rich in positively charged amino acids (MRVRKRQSRRTSTKLKEGIKKKASA-HRKKEKKMAKKDVT; pI = 11.76), were fused to EGFP. In contrast, the second half of the N-domain is acidic (pI = 4.37). As seem in Fig. 3, the N-terminal basic sequence of Nug1 (Nug1-N1) is sufficient to target the attached EGFP reporter to the nucleus/nucleolus. Conversely, a construct lacking the first 37 amino acids from Nug1 (Nug1-ΔN1-EGFP) no longer mediated nucleolar accumulation but was still able to target to the nucleus. Moreover, a fraction of Nug1-ΔN1-EGFP was also detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3). In conclusion, the N-terminal end of Nug1 exhibits a basic sequence that is sufficient and necessary for nucleolar accumulation of Nug1. To correlate nucle(ol)ar location of Nug1-N with binding to 60 S pre-ribosomes, we performed sucrose gradient centrifugation to analyze the association of wild-type Nug1 and its various truncation constructs with pre-60 S subunits (Fig. 4). The A260 nm profile of these gradients shows the sedimentation of 40 S and 60 S subunits, 80 S ribosomes, and polysomes (Fig. 4, upper panels). The sedimentation of the TAP-tagged wild-type and mutant Nug1 proteins was determined by Western analysis (Fig. 4, lower panels). Interestingly, wild-type Nug1 and the N-terminal constructs Nug1-N and Nug1-N1 are associated with high molecular weight complexes, presumably pre-60 S particles. In contrast, constructs lacking the N-terminal domain (Nug1-ΔN) or part of it (Nug1-ΔN1) did not associate with the high molecular particles and were mainly detected in the fractions of the gradient, containing the soluble proteins (Fig. 4). Notably, Nug1-N1 revealed a broad distribution with large complexes (in the range of pre-60 S particles). Notably, if endogenous Nug1 was absent, the viable Nug1-ΔN1-(38-520) was also weakly associated with large structures. These data indicate that the entire N-domain is necessary and sufficient for association with large assemblies, which likely correspond to pre-60 S subunits. To show a direct association with pre-60 S particles, we performed tandem affinity purification of various Nug1 constructs. Significantly, when TAP-tagged Nug1-N was affinity-purified, it co-precipitated pre-60 S subunits that contained a set of non-ribosomal factors, the most prominent ones being Dbp10, Erb1, Nop2, Nop7, Noc3, Nog1, Has1, and Nug2 (Fig. 5). The same pre-60 S factors were also co-enriched when full-length Nug1-TAP was affinity-purified (Fig. 5). Purification of the Nug1-N1 construct, which has a shortened N-domain, caused substantial loss of these pre-60 S factors, but association with 60 S subunits was not abolished. Thus, Nug1-N1 may exhibit a relatively unspecific binding to 60 S subunits. Consistent with this interpretation, Nug1-N1 was also detected in fractions corresponding to polysomes (Fig. 4). In contrast, affinity purification of TAP-tagged Nug1-ΔN or Nug1-ΔN1 lacking the entire N-domain or part of it, respectively, revealed a complete loss of both pre-60 S factors and ribosomal Rpl proteins (Fig. 5). Taken together, the data showed that the N-domain of Nug1 confers nucle(ol)ar location and association with pre-60 S particles that exhibit a typical set of pre-60 S factors. However, the middle and C-domain of Nug1 (Nug1-ΔN) are not significantly associated with pre-60 S particles under the biochemical conditions tested. The N-terminal Domain of Nug1 Interacts with RNA—The observation that the N-domain of Nug1 mediates recruitment to the pre-60 S subunit suggested that it binds to the particle through either a protein or an RNA interaction. Notably, we observed that recombinant Nug1 purified from E. coli co-enriched RNA. 4J. Bassler and E. Hurt, unpublished results. Therefore, we sought to test whether Nug1 via its N-domain can bind to RNA in general. As a first approach, we employed the yeast three-hybrid system to test for a possible interaction of Nug1 with RNA (23Bernstein D.S. Buter N. Stumpf C. Wickens M. Methods. 2002; 26: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,28SenGupta D.J. Zhang B. Kraemer B. Pochart P. Fields S. Wickens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). In the past, several specific RNA-protein interactions have been demonstrated in the three-hybrid system including interaction between ribosomal protein Rps14 and helix 23 of 18 S rRNA (29Fewell S.W. Woolford Jr., J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 826-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We could validate interaction of Rps14 with helix 23 rRNA in our three-hybrid analysis, but Nug1 did not interact with helix 23 rRNA (Fig. 6B). Notably, Nug1 revealed a strong three-hybrid interaction with 5 S rRNA (Fig. 6B). However, no three-hybrid interaction was observed between Nug1 and 5.8 S rRNA or reverse 5 S rRNA. Additional controls revealed that Rps14 did not interact with 5 S, 5.8 S, and reverse 5 S rRNA (Fig. 6B). Since the N-domain of Nug1 mediates binding to pre-60 S subunits, we tested whether Nug1-N interacts with 5 S rRNA in the three-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig. 6C, the Nug1-N construct, but not Nug1-ΔN, exhibited a three-hybrid interaction with 5 S rRNA. To confirm that Nug1 binds directly to RNA via its N-domain, we performed RNA electrophoresis mobility shift assays. First, the Nug1 N-terminal domain was expressed in E. coli as His6-Nug1-N and purified to homogeneity by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity purification and subsequent gel filtration on Superdex™200 (Fig. 7A). As an RNA substrate, we used in vitro synthesized 5 S rRNA and commercially available yeast tRNA. We observed that 5 S rRNA, but also tRNA, were efficiently retarded in their migration on the native polyacrylamide gel (band shift) when increasing amounts of the Nug1 N-domain were added (Fig. 7B). The formation of Nug1-N/5 S rRNA complexes was still observed in buffers that contained high salt (e.g. 500 mm NaCl). Since nug1-ΔN1 or nug1-1 mutants are not genetically linked to rpl5 or 5 S rRNA mutants (data not shown), we assume that in vitro binding of Nug1 to 5 S rRNA and tRNA reflects a general RNA binding activity of the Nug1 N-domain. However, it remains to be shown whether in vivo Nug1 binds to 5 S rRNA or to another rRNA species within the pre-60 S subunit (see “Discussion”). NUG1 via Its N-terminal Domain Genetically Interacts with pre-60 S Factors NOC2, NOC3, DBP10, and BUD20—To characterize the functional interaction of the Nug1 N-domain with components of the pre-60 S subunit in vivo, we performed a synthetic lethal (SL) screen with the nug1-ΔN1 allele using a red-white colony-sectoring assay (14Bassler J. Grandi P. Gadal O. Lessmann T. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Lechner J. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). From this SL screen, we could isolate synthetic lethal mutants SL46, SL78, and SL105 that were complemented by DBP10, NOC3, and BUD20, respectively. Noc3 and Dbp10 are known pre-60 S factors that are essential for 60 S subunit biogenesis (30Milkereit P. Gadal O. Podtelejnikov A. Trumtel S. Gas N. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Mann M. Hurt E.

Here we show that both UV-C and UV-B lead to decrease of p21 protein, but not mRNA, level in a dose-dependent fashion in all of six human cell lines and five mouse cell lines tested. Also, high doses of UV reduce the half-life of p21. High doses, but not low doses, of UV induced p21 degradation in both skp2-proficient and -deficient murine embryonic fibroblast cells. UV-induced p21 reduction was rescued by proteasome inhibitors in all human and mouse cell lines tested. Neither a caspase inhibitor nor small interfering RNA against skp2 had an effect on the UV-induced p21 decrease, suggesting that this p21 degradation pathway may not involve caspases, or Skp2. Finally, UV did not induce p21 ubiquitination but still induced its degradation when the E1-activating enzyme was inactivated in an E1 temperature-sensitive mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line. Altogether, these results demonstrate that UV induces p21 degradation through an Skp2and ubiquitin-independent pathway.

The tight cell cycle control is executed through the concerted efforts of cyclin-dependent kinases and their cellular inhibitors (1Schwartz G.K. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 122-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). One of the inhibitors, p21, is induced at the mRNA level by the tumor suppressor p53, subsequently leading to G1 arrest in response to DNA damage (2el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5132) Google Scholar), constantly high levels of p21 would be detrimental to normal cell growth. Thus, a post-translational mechanism has been evolved to adjust the level of this protein. It has been shown that the p21 protein is unstable due to active proteasome-mediated degradation in the nucleus (7Sheaff R.J. Singer J.D. Swanger J. Smitherman M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Mol.

Biol. 2004; 24: 6140-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Also, Skp2 was shown to mediate p21 ubiquitination and degradation in response to UV (14Bendjennat M. Boulaire J. Jascur T. Brickner H. Barbier V. Sarasin A. Fotedar A. Fotedar R. Cell. 2003; 114: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). On the other hand, challenging this ubiquitin-dependent model are several independent studies showing that p21 is degraded through a ubiquitin-independent mechanism (15Jin Y. Lee H. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Lu H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6365-6377Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 16Chen X. Chi Y. Bloecher A. Aebersold R. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 16000-16006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For example, lysinefree p21 was not ubiquitinated but still degraded through the proteasomal system (7Sheaff R.J. Singer J.D. Swanger J. Smitherman M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In addition, the 20 S proteasome directly bound to p21 and led to its degradation in vitro (18Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Moreover, p21 degradation was promoted by MDM2 independently of ubiquitin (15Jin Y. Lee H. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Lu H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6365-6377Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 17Zhang Z. Wang H. Li M. Agrawal S. Chen X. Zhang R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16000-16006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Further supporting the nonubiquitin pathway is that p21 was found to be acetylated at its N terminus in cells, suggesting that N-terminal ubiquitination is unlikely. Consistently, inactivation of the E1 or Skp2 components in the ubiquitination-proteasome system did not change the stability of p21 (16Chen X. Chi Y. Bloecher A. Aebersold R. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 839-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These results suggest a ubiquitin-independent mechanism for p21 turnover. Our study as described here further shows that UV induces p21 degradation independently of Skp2 and ubiquitin, consistent with the ubiquitin-independent model for p21 degradation.

UV Irradiation—UV Cross-linker (Fisher Scientific, FBUVXL-1000) was used to for UV C irradiation. Cells were irradiated with UV-C or UV-B at about 60–80% confluence with 6 ml of medium in a 100-mm Petri dish or with 2 ml of medium in a 60-mm Petri dish with the lid removed. This approach was adapted from that as described previously (14Bendjennat M. Boulaire J. Jascur T. Brickner H. Barbier V. Sarasin A. Fotedar A. Fotedar R.

However, the same results as that shown in Figs. 1, 2 were obtained when cells were irradiated with UV in the absence of media. The latter was our original protocol (20Zeng X. Keller D. Wu L. Lu H.

The skp2 siRNA-encoding (si-skp2) vector or a scrambled siRNA vector were transfected (3 μg each) into H1299 or 293 cells following the transient transfection protocol as described above. UV Reduces p21 Level in Human Cells in a Dose-dependent Fashion—In our initial attempt to understand how the p53 pathway in human RPE cells is regulated in response to UV irradiation, we surprisingly found that despite p53 induction by irradiation of RPE cells with 20 J/m2 UV-C, one of its targets, p21, was conversely reduced at the protein level in a time-dependent manner. Within 3 h post-irradiation, p21 protein almost completely disappeared (Fig. 1A). Unlike p21, MDM2 slightly increased at the 3-h point after irradiation and then decreased in a timely fashion afterward (Fig. 1A). The reduction of MDM2 was due to the repression of its transcription by UV as shown previously (20Zeng X. Keller D. Wu L. Lu H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6184-6188PubMed Google Scholar). However, this was not the case for p21, as its mRNA level was induced by UV, consistent with the idea that p21 transcription is activated by p53 (24el-Deiry W.S. Harper J.W. O'Connor P.M. Velculescu V.E. Canman C.E. Jackman J. Pietenpol J.A. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Wang Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1169-1174PubMed Google Scholar, 25Macleod K.F. Sherry N. Hannon G. Beach D. Tokino T. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 26Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5798) Google Scholar). Also, the UV-induced reduction of p21 in this cell line was dose-dependent, as the protein level of p21 was inversely proportional to the dose of UV used for irradiation (Fig. 1, B and C). This was true for both UV-C (>40 J/m2) and UV-B (>562 J/m2), but UV-C was more effective than UV-B, regardless of the induction of p53 (Fig. 1, A and C). The reduction of the p21 level by high doses of UV was due to the decrease of p21 stability, but not the change of its mRNA, as this reduction was rescued by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (supplemental Fig. S1), and again the p21 mRNA level was conversely induced by high doses of UV (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that UV-C and UV-B can reduce p21 protein, but not mRNA, levels independently of p53 activity in RPE cells. Our finding was surprising as a previous report showed that lower doses, instead of higher doses, of UV-C irradiation triggered p21 degradation in several mammalian cell lines (14Bendjennat M. Boulaire J. Jascur T. Brickner H. Barbier V. Sarasin A. Fotedar A. Fotedar R. Cell. 2003; 114: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Because the RPE cells used here were not used in that study (14Bendjennat M. Boulaire J. Jascur T. Brickner H. Barbier V. Sarasin A. Fotedar A. Fotedar R. Cell. 2003; 114: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), it is likely that this difference might be cell type-specific. To check this possibility, we carried out a set of experiments similar to that in Fig. 1 by employing five more human cell lines including U2OS, MCF7, HeLa, WI-38, and HEK cells. These cells are known to harbor wild-type p53 (Fig. 2 and data not shown). These cells were irradiated with different doses of UV-C (0–100 J/m2) (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the result of Fig. 1, but different from the previously reported result (14Bendjennat M. Boulaire J. Jascur T. Brickner H. Barbier V. Sarasin A. Fotedar A. Fotedar R. Cell. 2003; 114: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), UV-C also induced reduction of p21 protein levels to different degrees in a dose-dependent fashion in these cells regardless of the induction of p53 by UV (Fig. 2A and data not shown). UV-C at the doses higher than 80 J/m2 resulted in almost complete degradation of the p21 protein in most of the cells tested (Fig. 2A). This result is in striking contrast with the previously published result, which showed that UV-C at the doses higher than 40 J/m2 had no effect on p21 levels in several mammalian cell lines including U2OS cells (14Bendjennat M. Boulaire J. Jascur T. Brickner H. Barbier V. Sarasin A. Fotedar A. Fotedar R. Cell. 2003; 114: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This difference would not be due to possible variations in defining the dose of UV-C between our laboratory and the other laboratory (14Bendjennat M. Boulaire J. Jascur T. Brickner H. Barbier V. Sarasin A. Fotedar A. Fotedar R. Cell. 2003; 114: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Our 100 J/m2 could not be the same as their 30 J/m2, as most of the cells treated with 80 or 100 J/m2 underwent drastic death within 10 h post-irradiation (data not shown). Also, as expected (20Zeng X. Keller D. Wu L. Lu H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6184-6188PubMed Google Scholar), MDM2 levels also decreased in response to different doses of UV-C (Fig. 2A). The level of MDM2 in HEK cells was not shown because MDM2 was hardly detectable in this cell line (data not shown). To test whether UV-B can also affect p21 levels, we irradiated U2OS and MCF7 with different doses of UV-B (0–843 J/m2). As shown in Fig. 2B, UV-B also led to p21 decrease in a dosedependent fashion to a lesser degree in comparison with UV-C, although p53 was induced. Taken together, these results, which were also repeated in other human cell lines tested regardless of the presence of p53 or not (Figs. 1 and 2 and Figs. 4A and 6A; data not shown), demonstrate that UV irradiation leads to a decrease of p21 protein in human cells in a dose-dependent fashion. UV Induces the Proteasome-mediated p21 Degradation Independent of Ubiquitination—To determine whether UV-induced p21 decrease is due to proteasome-mediated degradation, RPE cells were incubated with or without 10 μm of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 immediately after being exposed to different doses of UV-C for 6 h and then harvested for WB analyses with antibodies against p21 and tubulin. Consistent with the results in Fig. 1 and 2, UV induced p21 reduction in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S1). This reduction was completely rescued by MG132 (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that UV may induce proteasomal turnover of p21. To confirm this result, a similar set of experiments was conducted using RPE, U2OS, and MCF7 cells. These cells were treated with or without another proteasome inhibitor ALLN or the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD besides MG132 prior to being exposed to UV irradiation (20 J/m2). Again, MG132 rescued UV-induced reduction of p21 in all three cell lines (lane 3 of Fig. 3B). Similarly, but to a less degree, ALLN also prevented p21 reduction by UV irradiation (lane 5). By contrast, the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD was without any effect on UV-induced reduction of p21 (lane 4). Z-VAD was effective in inhibiting caspase 3and 7-mediated cleavage of SSRP1, a nuclear transcriptional regulator, as shown in our recent report (27Landais I. Lee H. Lu H. Cell Death Differ. 2006; : 1-13PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for checking whether caspases are involved in p21 degradation is that UV-induced p21 reduction appeared to be less apparent in caspase 3-deficient MCF7 cells in comparison with other cell lines (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that UV may lead to p21 degradation through the proteasomal, but not the caspase, pathway. To confirm that UV indeed promotes p21 proteasomal degradation, we determined the effect of UV irradiation on the p21 half-life. As shown in Fig. 3C, the half-life of p21 was drastically reduced from ∼90 min without UV irradiation to ∼25 min after UV irradiation of RPE cells. To determine whether this UV-induced degradation of p21 is due to enhancement of p21 ubiquitnation, we performed an in vivo p21 ubiquitination assay. p53 null H1299 cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding p21 or p53 alone or together with the His-ubiquitin expression vector. The transfected cells were irradiated with 30 J/m2 UV-C and harvested 6 h afterward for in vivo ubiquitination and straight WB assays. As shown in Fig. 4, UV irradiation resulted in the reduction of both endogenous and exogenous p21 levels (A) but did not apparently affect the ubiquitination of p21 (compare lane 4 with lane 5 of Fig. 4B). This result is consistent with the previous report showing that endogenous p21 ubiquitination is not affected by UV-C irradiation (9Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In contrast with this result, p53 ubiquitination was markedly reduced by UV, which was also as expected (9Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 28Inoue T. Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Wu X. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), largely due to the reduction of MDM2 levels (20Zeng X. Keller D. Wu L. Lu H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6184-6188PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). These results indicate that UV induces the proteasome-mediated p21 degradation, but not ubiquitination, in human cells. To demonstrate that ubiquitination is not required for UV-induced p21 degradation, we employed an E1 temperature-sensitive ts20TGR MEF cell line (30Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, c-Myc was stabilized when ts20TGR cells were switched from 35 to 40 °C, indicating that E1 was inactivated, as c-Myc has been shown to be degraded through a ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway (31Gregory M.A. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 7: 2423-2435Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar). As a control, c-Myc was also markedly stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 when the ts20TGR cells were cultured at 35 °C (middle lane in Fig. 5A). Using this cell line, we then tested whether UV would induce p21 degradation when E1 is inactivated. Indeed, this was the case, as the p21 protein level was still drastically reduced by high doses of UV-C when the ts20TGR cells were cultured at 40 °C in comparison with that at 35 °C (Fig. 5B). Again, MG132 prevented UV-induced p21 reduction when cells were cultured at 35 °C (center panels of Fig. 5B). The inactivation of E1 by switching culture temperature to 40 °C was also evident by the stabilization of MDM2 even when the cells were irradiated at 80 J/m2 of UV-C (compare the top left panel with the top right panel). The reason for that both inactivation of E1 by switching culture temperature and inhibition of the proteasome by MG132 failed to completely rescue the level of MDM2 (top panels) was because the transcription of this mdm2 gene was inhibited by UV (20Zeng X. Keller D. Wu L. Lu H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6184-6188PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that UV-induced p21 turnover is proteasome-dependent but ubiquitination-independent. UV-induced p21 Proteasomal Turnover Is Independent on Skp2—It was previously shown that p21 degradation induced by low doses of UV (5–30 J/m2) is dependent upon the F box protein Skp2 (14Bendjennat M. Boulaire J. Jascur T. Brickner H. Barbier V. Sarasin A. Fotedar A. Fotedar R. Cell. 2003; 114: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Because here we showed that higher doses (>40 J/m2), instead of lower doses, of UV irradiation induced p21 degradation in all human cell lines and the ts20TGR MEF cell line tested (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and data not shown), we wanted to determine whether Skp2 is also required for UV-triggered p21 degradation. To this end, H1299 cells were transfected with the vector encoding Skp2 siRNA or scrambled siRNA (23Garriga J. Bhattacharya S. Calbo J. Marshall R.M. Truongcao M. Haines D.S. Grana X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5165-5173Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). At 40-h post-transfection, the transfected cells were irradiated with 40 J/m2 UV-C and harvested at 6 h post-irradiation for WB. As shown in Fig. 6A, siRNA designed to deplete all the variants of Skp2 as described previously (23Garriga J. Bhattacharya S. Calbo J. Marshall R.M. Truongcao M. Haines D.S. Grana X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5165-5173Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) remarkably reduced the expression of endogenous Skp2 in H1299 cells. As a result, one of the Skp2 targets, p27 (32Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 33Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat.

Biol. 1999; 9: 661-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), was induced (lower panel). Consistent with the results in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the high dose of UV irradiation caused drastic degradation of p21 in the cells. However, surprisingly, ∼90% reduction of the Skp2 level by siRNA did not rescue the UV-induced p21 degradation in this cell line (middle panel of Fig. 6A). This result, which was also reproduced in 293 cells (data not shown), suggests that UV-induced p21 proteasomal turnover may not require the Skp2-dependent ubiquitination pathway. To further verify this possibility, Skp2 null MEF cells (35Nakayama K. Nagahama H. Minamishima Y.A. Matsumoto M. Nakamichi I. Kitagawa K. Shirane M. Tsunematsu R. Tsukiyama T. Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Hatakeyama S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2069-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), as also evident in Fig. 6B, were employed in the following experiments. First, we checked the half-life of p21 in both wild-type and skp2–/– MEF cells without UV irradiation to see if the status of Skp2 would affect the stability of p21. Surprisingly, endogenous p21 in both of the cell lines displayed a similar half-life of ∼2 h (Fig. 6C). Next, both of the MEF cell lines were irradiated with different doses of UV-C and harvested for WB 6 h after irradiation. As shown in Fig."
https://openalex.org/W2007463619,"Neuroglycan C (NGC) is a transmembrane-type chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that is exclusively expressed in the central nervous system. We report that the recombinant ectodomain of NGC core protein enhances neurite outgrowth from rat neocortical neurons in culture. Both protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors attenuated the NGC-mediated neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that NGC promotes neurite outgrowth via PI3K and PKC pathways. The active sites of NGC for neurite outgrowth existed in the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain and acidic amino acid (AA)-domain of the NGC ectodomain. The EGF-domain caused cells to extend preferentially one neurite from a soma, whereas the AA-domain caused several neurites to develop. The EGF-domain also enhanced neurite outgrowth from GABA-positive neurons, but the AA-domain did not. These results suggest that the EGF-domain and AA-domain have distinct functions in terms of neuritogenesis. From these findings, NGC can be considered to be involved in neuritogenesis in the developing central nervous system. Neuroglycan C (NGC) is a transmembrane-type chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that is exclusively expressed in the central nervous system. We report that the recombinant ectodomain of NGC core protein enhances neurite outgrowth from rat neocortical neurons in culture. Both protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors attenuated the NGC-mediated neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that NGC promotes neurite outgrowth via PI3K and PKC pathways. The active sites of NGC for neurite outgrowth existed in the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain and acidic amino acid (AA)-domain of the NGC ectodomain. The EGF-domain caused cells to extend preferentially one neurite from a soma, whereas the AA-domain caused several neurites to develop. The EGF-domain also enhanced neurite outgrowth from GABA-positive neurons, but the AA-domain did not. These results suggest that the EGF-domain and AA-domain have distinct functions in terms of neuritogenesis. From these findings, NGC can be considered to be involved in neuritogenesis in the developing central nervous system. Proteoglycans (PGs) 3The abbreviations used are: PGs, proteoglycans; CALEB, chicken acidic leucine-rich EGF-like domain-containing brain protein; CNS, central nervous system; CS, chondroitin sulfate; CSPG, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MAP2, microtubule-associated protein 2; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NGC, neuroglycan C; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIP3 phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate; PKC, protein kinase C; AA, acidic amino acid. are a group of proteins with covalently attached sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. In the central nervous system (CNS), there are many PG species, some of which are classified into families with a domain structure common to their core proteins (for review, see Ref. 1Bandtlow C.E. Zimmermann D.R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1267-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that PGs are involved in axonal outgrowth, synaptogenesis, neuronal cell differentiation, embryonic cell division, and repair of the CNS (1Bandtlow C.E. Zimmermann D.R.

Neuroglycan C (NGC) is a membrane-spanning chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) with a core glycoprotein of 120 kDa that was originally found in the developing rat brain (5Watanabe E. Maeda N.

Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Its core protein is divided into five structurally different domains; an N-terminal domain to which a chondroitin sulfate chain is attached, an acidic amino acid (AA) cluster, a cysteinerich domain containing a single epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like module, a membrane-spanning segment, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 95 amino acids (5Watanabe E. Maeda N. Matsui F. Kushima Y. Noda M. Oohira A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26876-26882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). NGC is a part-time PG, because most NGC molecules exist in a non-PG form without chondroitin sulfate (CS) in the mature cerebellum and retina (7Aono S. Keino H. Ono T. Yasuda Y. Tokita Y. Matsui F.

Kida N. Honda Y. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 4338-4346PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of NGC in the rat CNS is detected at embryonic day (E) 16, increases with a peak around the third postnatal week, then decreases to about a half of the peak level at adulthood (5Watanabe E.

Because neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis in the rat CNS actively occur in the late fetal and early postnatal periods, it is likely that NGC is involved in the formation of the neuronal circuit in the CNS. Immunohistochemical studies using an antibody against NGC show that NGC is expressed in association with neuronal structure such as dendrites or axons in the developing CNS (7Aono S. Keino H. Ono T.

Immunostaining of cultured neuronal cells with anti-NGC antibody demonstrated that NGC is concentrated in budding neurites (8Inatani M. Tanihara H. Oohira A. Otori Y. Nishida A. Honjo M. Kida N.

Suppl. 2001; 25: S4Google Scholar), which are considered to develop into neurites or postsynaptic spines. Schumacher et al. (9Schumacher S. Volkmer H. Buck F. Otto A. Tarnok A. Roth S. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 895-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have identified a chicken homolog of NGC named chicken acidic leucine-rich EGF-like domain containing brain protein (CALEB), and reported that Fab fragments of anti-NGC/CALEB antibodies interfere with the formation of neurites in chick tectal cells. Moreover, it has been shown that synapse function during postnatal development was impaired in CALEB-deficient mice (11Jüttner R. Moré M.I. Das D. Babich A. Meier J. Henning M. Erdmann B.

Thus, NGC is involved in neuritogenesis and/or synaptogenesis. To study the function of NGC in neuritogenesis more directly, we produced a recombinant ectodomain of the NGC core protein and performed neurite outgrowth assays in primary cultured fetal rat neocortical neurons. We found that the EGF-domain and AA-domain of the NGC ectodomain enhanced the outgrowth of neurites from rat neocortical neurons, and that NGC-induced neurite outgrowth was mediated via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways. Cell Culture—Neocortical neurons were cultured as described previously (12Nakanishi K. Nakanishi M. Kukita F. Brain Res. Protoc. 1999; 4: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebral cortices of fetal (embryonic day 16) Wistar rats were digested with 0.02% papain and mechanically dissociated by trituration. The cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well plates at a density of ∼5.3 × 103 cells/cm2. The cells were maintained in high glucose Dullbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.02% heat-inactivated horse serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 25 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES; Dojin Chemicals, Kumamoto, Japan), 25 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 μl/ml N2 supplement (Invitrogen), in a 95% air, 5% CO2, H2O-saturated atmosphere at 37 °C. For the experiment of immobilized NGC, culture plates precoated with poly-l-lysine were treated with recombinant NGC proteins at 4 °C overnight. The plates were washed three times with PBS before use. All of the animal experiments were performed with the approval of the Animal care and Experimentation Committee of our institution. Every effort was made to minimize animal suffering and reduce the number of animals used. Preparation of Recombinant NGC Core Protein Peptides—Recombinant NGC proteins were prepared by the method of Yamauchi et al. (13Yamauchi S. Tokita Y. Aono S. Matsui F. Shuo T. Ito H. Kato K. Kasahara K. Oohira A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20583-20590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with a slight modification as follows. To produce recombinant rat NGC polypeptides as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused proteins, cDNA fragments encoding the entire ectodomain without the signal peptide (NGCect; amino acid 31-426), a domain containing the CS attachment site (NGCcs; 33-259), a domain containing the acidic amino acid (AA) cluster (NGCAA; 259-336), a domain containing the EGF module (NGCE; 336-426), and a domain containing both AA- and EGF-domains (NGCAE; 259-426) of rat NGC were subcloned into pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The plasmids were introduced separately into Escherichia coli BL21. Expression of the fusion proteins was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Katayama Chemicals, Nagoya, Japan). Cells were lysed in BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). After centrifugation of the lysate at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column, and proteins bound to the beads were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm glutathione. Affinity-purified GST-fused proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C overnight, and used for neurite outgrowth assays after sterilization by filtration. Neurite Outgrowth Assay—Recombinant proteins were usually added to neuronal cell cultures 1 h after plating. For the assay with kinase inhibitors, first the kinase inhibitors were added 1 h after plating, then the recombinant proteins. Cells were fixed 24 h after plating with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 1% sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 1 h. After fixation, ten fields in each well were photographed using a digital camera (DXC-S500/OL; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) through an inverted microscope (IX71, Olympus) at a ×200 scale and analyzed. A neuron with neurites extending three somal diameters or longer was defined as a neuron with long neurites (Fig. 2B, panel a). The percentage of neurons with long neurites was calculated as the number with long neurites divided by the total number of neurons in 10 fields in each well, and the average from 4 wells was calculated. Neurite length was defined as the one-line distance from the center of the soma to the farthest tip of the longest neurite of individual neurons (Fig. 2B, panel b). The neurite length of all neurons in 10 photographs in each well was measured using the public domain NIH Image program. The average for 4 wells was calculated as the mean neurite length in each condition. We usually analyzed about 50-100 neurons per well. The number of neurites per neuron was determined as the number of primary processes from the soma. The histogram (Fig. 7) was made from all neurons with long neurites in 4 wells (total 40 fields). For the analysis of the percentage of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-positive neurons with long neurites, all GABA-positive neurons were examined in each well, since there were only a few GABA-positive neurons in each field (around 250-300 cells in each well, namely about one tenth of all neurons; Ref. 14Nakanishi K. Kukita F. Asai K. Kato T. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 304: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Data were plotted as the mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance followed by the Tukey-Kramer multiple-comparison test (InStat Ver. 3; Graph-Pad Software, San Diego, CA), and a p value of < 0.05 was considered significant.FIGURE 7NGCE preferably promotes elongation of one neurite, whereas NGCAA promotes elongation of several neurites. The number of neurites extending from a soma (primary processes) of each neuron was counted and represented in the histogram in each culture condition. Only neurons with neurites extending three somal diameters or longer were counted. The polypeptide added to the culture is shown in the upper right of each panel. #; number.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Antibodies and other Chemicals—Mouse monoclonal antibodies against Tau-1 (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2; Sigma-Aldrich), phosphotyrosine (PY-20; Sigma), β-actin (Sigma), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; Sigma), and phospho-ERK (Sigma), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Tau (H-150; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and GABA (Sigma) were used. Staurosporine was purchased from Wako Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Rp-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate triethylammonium salt (Rp-cAMPS), hypericin, U0126, calphostin C, and LY294002 were obtained from Sigma. Lavendustin A and bisindolylmaleimide I were purchased from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). Immunocytochemistry—Freshly fixed neurons were first washed with PBS and blocked with 2% goat serum in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 to reduce nonspecific antibody binding. Neurons were then incubated with a primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS, they were incubated with a secondary antibody, either Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) or biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), at room temperature for 2 h, and in the latter case then incubated with streptavidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For the double staining, samples were incubated with two kinds of antibody concurrently. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—To confirm the production and purity of recombinant proteins, they were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 5-20% gradient gel (Bio Craft, Tokyo, Japan), and protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For phosphorylation analysis, neocortical neurons were seeded on 6-cm dishes at a density of 4.2 × 104 cells/cm2. Fifteen minutes after treatment with NGCect (50 μg/ml) or GST (at a molar concentration equal to that of NGCect), the cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 200 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. After 60 min of incubation on ice, cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were used for Western blot analyses. Proteins precipitated from each sample by adding 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate at 0 °C were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 5-20% gradient gel (Bio Craft). The proteins in the gel were transferred electrophoretically to a Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was incubated sequentially with primary antibodies and with adequate secondary antibodies, and immunoproducts were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblotting using an anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) was done to estimate the yield of proteins after stripping of the membrane. A Recombinant Ectodomain of NGC Core Protein Promotes Neurite Outgrowth—The NGC core protein contains several structurally unique domains such as the CS-attachment site, an AA cluster, and a single EGF-like module as shown in Fig. 1A. To investigate domain-specific functions of the extracellular region of NGC, we produced recombinant polypeptides containing one or more of these domains in E. coli as GST-fused proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). These recombinant polypeptides were purified separately by affinity column chromatography using a glutathione column, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). Each sample contained a major band with the largest molecular size and a few minor bands, which might be synthetic precursors or degradation products of the major component. For control experiments, GST was also expressed in E. coli, and purified by affinity column chromatography. It was recovered by SDS-PAGE at a molecular size of 27 kDa, the expected size for GST (Fig. 1B, lane G). To examine whether the NGC ectodomain exerts any effect on the cellular events in neurons, we first added NGCect to rat neocortical neurons in culture. Twenty-four hours after plating, the neurites of neurons cultured in the presence of NGCect (50 μg/ml) were longer than those of control cells cultured without any NGC peptides (None) or with only GST (Fig. 2A). The percentage of cells which have neurites extending three somal diameters or longer was 66.6 ± 4.9 (mean ± S.D.) percent in the presence of NGCect. This was significantly high compared with the control value (None, 12.6 ± 7.0%; GST, 10.7 ± 3.9%; p < 0.001, Fig. 2B, panel a). The mean length of the longest neurite of individual neurons cultured in the presence of NGCect was 47.3 ± 3.3 μm, which was significantly longer than the control value (None, 22.1 ± 0.8 μm; GST, 22.4 ± 2.1 μm; p < 0.001, Fig. 2B, panel b). NGCect-mediated neurite outgrowth was also observed in cultures of hippocampal neurons from E16 fetal rats (data not shown). Furthermore, outgrowth-promoting activity was observed when we used pure NGCect prepared from NGCect by enzymatic removal of the GST portion (data not shown), indicating that the promotive activity of NGCect for neurite outgrowth was not due to the fusion of GST to the NGC ectodomain. When neocortical neurons were cultured on plates precoated with 50 μg/ml of NGCect, neurite elongation was also promoted significantly, but less than the cultures supplemented with NGCect to culture media (data not shown), suggesting that both soluble and substratum-immobilized NGC molecules exert neurite outgrowth-promoting activity. Most neurites elongated by the NGCect treatment were immunopositive for tau (an axonal marker, Fig. 3A). Some elongated neurites were also immunopositive for MAP2 (a dendrite marker), although the intensity was low (Fig. 3B). Considering that the differentiation of neurites into axons or dendrites is determined after 3 days in culture (15Craig A.M. Banker G. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 267-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), it is possible that the neurites elongated by NGCect treatment have not differentiated into axons completely by 24 h after plating. Treatment of Neurons with NGCect Reduces Tyrosine Phosphorylation—To find a cue of the intracellular mechanism for neurite elongation mediated by NGCect, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of neocortical neurons. Fifteen minutes after treatment with NGCect or GST, neurons were lysed and tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed by Western blotting using an antibody against phosphotyrosine (PY20). Treatment with NGCect reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of about 34-, 37-40-, 46-56-, 92-, and 180-kDa proteins (Fig. 4A). The density of each tyrosine-phosphorylated band was compared between control and NGCect-treated sample after normalization to the density of β-actin band using the public domain NIH Image program. Tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced by NGCect treatment to 74, 78, 64, 74, and 83% in 34-, 37-, 46-, 92-, and 180-kDa proteins, respectively. This result indicates that NGCect gives rise to a certain intracellular signal in cultured neurons. Because the ERK pathway is involved in neurite outgrowth in some experimental systems (16Vaudry D. Stork P.J.S. Lazarovici P. Eiden L.E. Science. 2002; 296: 1648-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 17Pasterkamp R.J. Pescho J.J. Spriggs M.K. Kolodkin A.L. Nature. 2003; 424: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), we then examined whether ERKs were activated during NGCect-induced neuritogenesis. Neither the protein level nor the phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 was changed remarkably by NGCect treatment of neurons (Fig. 4B). Next, we examined the involvement of Src family tyrosine kinases whose molecular sizes are 50-60 kDa, because they have been demonstrated to be involved in the elongation of neurites in some cases (18Hoffman-Kim D. Kerner J.A. Chen A. Xu A. Wang T.F. Jay D.G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Kinnunen T. Kaksonen M. Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Peng H.B. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10702-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 20Martinez M.C. Ochiishi T. Majewski M. Kosik K.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the level of c-Src phosphorylation was not changed in neurons treated with NGCect (data not shown). These results indicate that NGC-mediated neurite outgrowth is independent of MAPKs and Src kinase pathways. NGC-induced Neurite Outgrowth Is Mediated by PKC and PI3K—To identify the family of kinases responsible for NGCect signaling in neuritogenesis, we treated neocortical neurons with several kinase inhibitors in the presence (+) or absence (-)ofNGCect (N), and then examined neurite outgrowth (Fig. 5). We tested staurosporine (S, a broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor, 50 nm), lavendustin A (L, an inhibitor of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase and p60c-src, 10 μm), Rp-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate triethylammonium salt (Rp-cAMPS; R, a protein kinase A inhibitor, 20 μm), hypericin (H, a protein kinase C inhibitor, 10 μm), and U0126 (U, a MAP kinase kinase (MEK) 1 and 2 inhibitor, 100 nm). Addition of NGCect increased the percentage of neurons with long neurites even in the presence of lavendustin A, Rp-cAMPS, and U0126 (L versus L + N, 5.6 ± 2.9 versus 40.6 ± 4.6%, p < 0.001; R versus R + N, 25.1 ± 1.8 versus 66.3 ± 4.8%, p < 0.001; U versus U + N, 32.3 ± 6.0 versus 72.5 ± 1.3%, p < 0.001, respectively) as well as in the absence of these inhibitors (GST (G) versus NGCect (N), 26.0 ± 1.4 versus 73.8 ± 4.0%, p < 0.001; Fig. 5A, panel b). The fact that U0126 did not block the NGC-mediated neurite outgrowth was consistent with the results of phosphorylation experiments shown in Fig. 4B. On the other hand, in the presence of staurosporine and hypericin, NGCect did not enhance neurite outgrowth (S and H in Fig. 5A, panel b). The mean neurite lengths in S + N and H + N conditions were not significantly different from those in S alone and H alone, respectively, while NGCect treatment increased the mean neurite length even in the presence of L, R, or U (L versus L + N, 23.6 ± 3.6 versus 44.3 ± 3.0 μm, p < 0.001; R versus R + N, 38.4 ± 2.3 versus 64.1 ± 4.7 μm, p < 0.001; U versus U + N, 40.2 ± 3.6 versus 65.1 ± 1.6 μm, p < 0.001; G versus N, 34.6 ± 1.3 versus 69.6 ± 4.8 μm, p < 0.001; Fig. 5A, panel c). Furthermore, a calmodulin kinase II inhibitor, KN62 (10 μm), did not prevent the NGCect-mediated neurite outgrowth either (data not shown). Next, we tried a specific PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide I (B). Treatment with bisindolylmaleimide I inhibited the NGCect-mediated neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner (the percentage of neurons with long neurites; 57.9 ± 5.1, 38.3 ± 1.3, 18.3 ± 3.7, and 7.2 ± 2.3% in 0, 1, 5, and 10 μm B + N, respectively, p < 0.001; the mean neurite length; 57.8 ± 2.0 μm, 40.9 ± 1.4 μm, 29.3 ± 2.6 μm, and 22.1 ± 1.8 μm, in 0, 1, 5, and 10 μm B + N, respectively, p < 0.001; Fig. 5B, panels a, b, and c). Another specific PKC inhibitor calphostin C (Cal; 100 nm) also blocked the NGCect-mediated neurite outgrowth (the percentage of neurons with long neurites; Cal + N, 3.0 ± 3.5%, p < 0.001 compared with the sample treated with NGCect alone: the mean neurite length; Cal + N, 13.8 ± 2.5 μm, p < 0.001 compared with the sample treated with NGCect alone; Fig. 5B, panels b and c). We also tested the involvement of PI3K in NGCect-mediated neurite outgrowth using a PI3K-specific inhibitor, LY294002 (LY). Treatment with LY294002 also inhibited NGCect-mediated neurite outgrowth dose-dependently (the percentage of neurons with long neurites; 20 μm LY + N, 18.8 ± 3.9%, and 100 μm LY + N, 2.1 ± 1.3%, p < 0.001 compared with the sample treated with NGCect alone: the mean neurite length; 20 μm LY + N, 27.0 ± 1.3 μm, and 100 μm LY + N, 13.9 ± 0.6 μm, p < 0.001 compared with the sample treated with NGCect alone; Fig. 5B, panels a, b, and c). These results suggest that both PKC and PI3K pathways are involved in neurite outgrowth mediated by NGCect. The Active Site of NGCect for Neurite Outgrowth Exists in the Region Containing the Acidic and EGF-like Domains—To examine which region of NGCect has promotive activity for neurite elongation, we added separately the five GST-fused polypeptides (NGCect, NGCCS, NGCAA, NGCE, and NGCAE) shown in Fig. 1A as well as GST to culture medium of neocortical neurons at an equal molar concentration; 50 μg/ml for NGCect, 38 μg/ml for NGCCS, 26 μg/ml for NGCAA, 27 μg/ml for NGCE, 33 μg/ml for NGCAE, and 20 μg/ml for GST. As shown in Fig. 6A, the addition of NGCAA, NGCE, or NGCAE apparently promoted neurite elongation 24 h after plating as did the addition of NGCect, but the addition of NGCCS or GST did not. The percentages of neurons with neurites extending three somal diameters or longer were 75.6 ± 7.1, 72.4 ± 12.7, 50.5 ± 9.8, and 62.6 ± 9.4 in NGCect-, NGCE-, NGCAA-, and NGCAE-treated cultures, respectively. These values were significantly higher than those in GST- and NGCCS-treated cultures (GST, 19.4 ± 11.1%; NGCCS, 22.9 ± 5.0%; Fig. 6B, panel a). The mean lengths of neurites were 54.7 ± 3.6, 50.5 ± 5.7, 41.9 ± 5.1, and 48.7 ± 6.4 μm in NGCect-, NGCE-, NGCAA-, and NGCAE- treated cultures, respectively. These were significantly longer than those in GST- and NGCCS-treated cultures (GST, 26.3 ± 4.6 μm; NGCCS, 28.6 ± 2.4 μm; Fig. 6B, panel b). These findings indicate that both NGCAA and NGCE have a promotive effect on the outgrowth of neurites from neocortical neurons. According to our careful observation, neurons in the presence of NGCE appeared to extend one neurite, whereas those in NGCAA-treated cultures developed several neurites. Then, we counted the number of neurites elongating from a soma in each condition. As shown in Fig. 7, neurons with one long neurite dominated in the presence of NGCE, whereas many of the neurons treated with NGCAA had several neurites. Neurons treated with NGCect or NGCAE tended to develop an intermediate number of neurites. These results suggest that NGCE and NGCAA have somewhat different functions in neurite outgrowth. NGCE, but Not NGCAA, Promotes Neurite Outgrowth in GABAergic Neurons—It is generally accepted from anatomical studies using Golgi or immunohistochemical techniques that the majority (about 80%) of layer IV neurons in the mouse or rat barrel cortex are spiny (presumably excitatory) neurons, whereas about 20% are sparsely spiny or aspiny (presumably inhibitory) neurons (21Simons D.J. Woolsey T.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1984; 230: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Lin C.-S. Lu S.M. Schmechel D.E. J.

Therefore, the data shown in Figs. 2 and 6 indicate that both NGCE and NGCAA promote the elongation of neurites from excitatory neurons. It is of interest to examine whether they also promote the elongation of neurites from inhibitory neurons. To examine this, we performed double immunofluorescence labeling of cultured neurons treated with each fusion protein using antibodies against MAP2 (a neuronal marker) and GABA (a main inhibitory neurotransmitter in neocortex). GABA-positive neurons accounted for 10-15% of all MAP2-positive neurons in our culture at 1 day of cultivation (14Nakanishi K. Kukita F. Asai K. Kato T. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 304: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The addition of NGCect or NGCE incr"

Research concerning how OPN functions in tumor progression has led to the identification of a limited number of genes that contribute functionally to OPN-induced cellular behaviors. Recent microarray analysis, comparing 21NT breast cancer cells transfected to constitutively overexpress OPN with control cells, revealed hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) to be a gene highly up-regulated in OPN-overexpressing cells. In this study, we further examined the relationship between OPN and HAS2. We show that 21NT OPN-transfected cells express high levels of HAS2, which is associated with increased HA production and matrix retention and is necessary for tumor cell adhesion to bone marrow endothelial cells and anchorage-independent growth. Finally, stable transfection of antisense HAS2 into 21NT cells overexpressing OPN resulted in a reduction in HAS2 expression, HA production, and pericellular retention. Antisense-mediated down-regulation of HAS2 also resulted in a significant decrease in cellular proliferation and colony growth in soft agar. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the ability of OPN to regulate HAS2 expression and HA production in breast cancer cells and further illustrates a unique functional relationship by which enhanced HA production facilitates OPN-mediated cell behaviors.

The extracellular matrix has a crucial role in tumor development and progression. It provides tumor cells with the necessary scaffold for attachment, migration, and growth and also serves as a reservoir for many growth factors, cytokines, and signaling molecules that may regulate malignant cell behaviors. Further, it provides a contextual three-dimensional microenvironment that contributes to the regulation of cell phenotype (1Bissell M.J. Labarge M.A. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 17-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar).Osteopontin (OPN) 3The abbreviations used are: OPN, osteopontin; as, antisense; BMEC, bone marrow endothelial cells; cDNA, complementary DNA; CMFDA, 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; HA, hyaluronan; HAase, hyaluronidase; HAS, hyaluronan synthase; RT, reverse transcription; VC, vector-transfected control; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 3The abbreviations used are: OPN, osteopontin; as, antisense; BMEC, bone marrow endothelial cells; cDNA, complementary DNA; CMFDA, 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; HA, hyaluronan; HAase, hyaluronidase; HAS, hyaluronan synthase; RT, reverse transcription; VC, vector-transfected control; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. is an extracellular phosphoglycoprotein that has been increasingly implicated in the progression and metastasis of various cancers, including breast cancer. Clinically, OPN has been shown to correlate with disease outcome and patient survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer, as well as in patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer (2Singhal H. Bautista D.S. Tonkin K.S. O'Malley F.P. Tuck A.B. Chambers A.F. Harris J.F. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 605-611PubMed Google Scholar, 3Tuck A.B. O'Malley F.P. Singhal H. Harris J.F. Tonkin K.S.

Med. 2001; 1: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which OPN contributes functionally to malignancy remains poorly understood. OPN is able to bind to cell surface receptors, including integrins and members of the CD44 family. OPN-induced signaling through these receptors has been shown to regulate specific cellular functions including migration, invasion, cell survival, and angiogenesis (5Tuck A.B. Arsenault D.M.

Biochem. 2000; 78: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which OPN mediates these biological effects has been attributed in part to its ability to regulate the expression of specific genes, although, until recently, only a limited number have been identified (5Tuck A.B. Arsenault D.M. O'Malley F.P. Hota C. Ling M.C. Wilson S.M. Chambers A.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4237-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 9Tuck A.B. Hota C. Wilson S.M. Chambers A.F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).To identify genes that may contribute to OPN-induced malignant cell behaviors, our group previously performed microarray analysis to compare the expression profiles between 21NT control and OPN-transfected human breast cancer cells (10Cook A.C. Tuck A.B. McCarthy S. Turner J.G. Irby R.B. Bloom G.C. Yeatman T.J. Chambers A.F. Mol. Carcinog. 2005; 43: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We subsequently categorized those genes differentially regulated by OPN into the six “Hallmarks of Cancer” categories, as defined by Hanahan and Weinberg (11Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21926) Google Scholar). Of those genes grouped into the “Tissue Invasion and Metastasis” category, we identified hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) as a gene highly up-regulated by OPN.Hyaluronan (HA) is a linear glycosaminoglycan of repeating disaccharide units of N-acetylglucosamine and d-glucuronic acid. It is found abundantly in the extracellular matrix of various tissues, particularly those undergoing tissue remodeling and rapid cell proliferation (12Tammi M.I. Day A.J. Turley E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4581-4584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, increased HA expression has been associated with malignant progression of a variety of tumor types, including breast, prostate, colon, glioma, and mesothelioma (13Toole B.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). How HA promotes tumor progression is not fully understood but has been suggested to be due to its biomechanical properties, through its ability to expand extracellular spaces to facilitate cell migration. HA may also interact with specific receptors, including CD44 and RHAMM (receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility), to stimulate adhesion, cell survival, and motility (12Tammi M.I. Day A.J. Turley E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4581-4584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 13Toole B.P. Nat. Rev.

Glycoconj J. 2002; 19: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).HA biosynthesis is catalyzed by multipass transmembrane HAS enzymes. HAS2 is one of three members of the HAS gene family, which also includes HAS1 and HAS3. Each isoform is located on different mammalian chromosomes, yet they have remarkable sequence homology (15Itano N. Kimata K. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Although each isoform can catalyze the synthesis of HA, they display different tissue patterns of expression as well as distinct enzymatic characteristics, including their elongation rate of HA and the average size of HA produced (15Itano N. Kimata K. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence suggests that elevated HAS expression can contribute to tumor progression and metastasis. Increased HAS2 expression in fibrosarcoma cells or HAS3 expression in prostate cancer cells leads to enhanced subcutaneous tumor growth in mice (16Kosaki R. Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1141-1145PubMed Google Scholar, 17Liu N. Gao F. Han Z. Xu X. Underhill C.B. Zhang L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5207-5214PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, expression of HAS1 can restore the metastatic potential of mouse mammary carcinoma cells defective in HAS activity (18Itano N. Sawai T. Miyaishi O. Kimata K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2499-2504PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, targeted down-regulation of HAS2 or HAS3 in prostate cancer cells reduces their ability to adhere to bone marrow endothelial cells, whereas suppression of HAS2 in breast cancer cells inhibits both primary and secondary tumor formation (19Simpson M.A. Wilson C.M. Furcht L.T. Spicer A.P. Oegema Jr., T.R. McCarthy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10050-10057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20Udabage L. Brownlee G.R. Waltham M.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6139-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).In this study, we investigated whether increased HAS2 and HA expression in cells constitutively expressing OPN was necessary for OPN-mediated cell behaviors. Here we show that overexpression of OPN in a tumorigenic human mammary epithelial cell line contributes to increased HAS2 expression and HA production to promote anchorage-independent growth and adhesion to bone marrow endothelial cells. We then show that antisense-mediated down-regulation of HAS2 in these cells results in decreased HAS2 expression, HA secretion, and pericellular matrix retention. Furthermore, antisense inhibition of HAS2 significantly decreases anchorage-independent growth. These results provide the first evidence of a functional relationship between OPN and HAS2 in the malignancy of breast cancer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The NTOPbi (OPN-transfected) and NTCi (mock transfected) cell lines were cultured in standard growth medium (αHE + 10% fetal bovine serum + 200 μg/ml G418) as described previously (10Cook A.C. Tuck A.B. McCarthy S. Turner J.G. Irby R.B. Bloom G.C. Yeatman T.J. Chambers A.F. Mol. Carcinog. 2005; 43: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These cells were previously derived from the 21NT tumorigenic, nonmetastatic human mammary carcinoma cell line (21Band V. Zajchowski D. Swisshelm K. Trask D. Kulesa V. Cohen C. Connolly J. Sager R. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7351-7357PubMed Google Scholar) by stable transfection with either a pcDNA3 vector containing a full-length human OPN cDNA (21NTOPbi) or an unmodified pcDNA3 expression vector (21NTCi) (5Tuck A.B. Arsenault D.M. O'Malley F.P. Hota C. Ling M.C. Wilson S.M. Chambers A.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4237-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Transfection of OPN into the 21NT cells resulted in an 8.1–8.6-fold increase in OPN mRNA and protein expression, respectively, relative to mock transfected cells (5Tuck A.B. Arsenault D.M. O'Malley F.P. Hota C. Ling M.C. Wilson S.M. Chambers A.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4237-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 22Tuck A.B. Hota C. Chambers A.F. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2001; 70: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Relative to the highly metastatic MDA-MB-435 cell line, which is known to naturally express very high levels of OPN, 21NTOPbi cells expressed 67% of the levels of OPN protein in conditioned media (12 ng/ml versus 17.9 ng/ml by ELISA assay), whereas the control cells expressed only 7.8% of the amount of OPN (1.4 ng/ml versus 17.9 ng/ml) (data not shown). The human bone marrow endothelial cell line, hBMEC UEAP P03, was obtained as a kind gift from Dr. Ken Pienta (University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI). These cells were previously transformed with the SV40 virus to maintain a stable cell line and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose + 10% fetal bovine serum. All of the cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.Quantification of HAS and OPN Messenger RNA Expression—OPN and HAS isoform expression was quantified by real time PCR using gene-specific primers. Total RNA was extracted from subconfluent plates using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. RNA concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm by standard spectrophotometric analysis, and RNA samples were frozen at –80 °C. 0.5 μg of RNA was used to prepare a 20-μl reaction volume of cDNA in a first strand cDNA synthesis reaction using SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen) and random hexamers. Quantitative detection and analysis of mRNA gene expression was performed using the Stratagene Mx3000P real time RT-PCR system with SYBR Green chemistry (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Real time RT-PCR primers were designed using PrimerQuest software (scitools.idtdna.com/Primerquest/) and synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (Oakville, Canada). Primer sequences were as follows: OPN forward, 5′-AGTTTCGCAGACCTGACATCCAGT, and reverse, 5′-TTCATAACTGTCCTTCCCACGGCT; β-actin forward, 5′-GGAAATCGTGCGTGACATTA, and reverse, 5′-GGAGCAATGATCTTGATCTTC; HAS1 forward, 5′-CGATACTGGGTAGCCTTCAATG, and reverse: 5′-GGAGGTGTACTTGGTAGCATAACC; HAS2 forward, 5′-CACACTCTTTGGAGTCTCTCTC, and reverse, 5′-GGTCATCTTCTGAGTTCCCATC; and HAS3 forward, 5′-AACTAAGTATACCGCGCGCTCCAA, and reverse, 5′-AGGTGGTGCTTATGGAACCACAGA. The primers were reconstituted to a concentration of 6 × 10–5 μmol/μl in sterile TE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA), pH 8.0, and further diluted 1:10 in sterile water prior to the assay. PCRs were set up according to the manufacturer's instructions provided with the Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix kit (Stratagene). All of the reactions were carried out in a final volume of 25 μl and consisted of 12.5 μl of 2× Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix, 30 nm final concentration of the passive reference dye, 25 ng cDNA, and 6 × 10–6 μmol/μl forward and reverse primers. OPN and β-actin primers were used at final concentrations of 100 nm, and HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3 primers were used at final concentrations of 150 nm. All of the samples were run in triplicate, in parallel with no template controls for each gene analyzed. The standard amplification protocol consisted of a 10-min incubation at 95 °C followed by 40 amplification cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Fluorescent measurements were taken at the end of the 72 °C extension step. Cycle threshold, the cycle at which fluorescence is determined to be statistically significant above background, was set within the linear range for all reactions. To determine the efficiency of the reaction and purity of the products, a melt curve analysis was performed at the end of each reaction by incubating the samples at 95 °C for 1 min and ramping down to 55 °C at a rate of 0.2 °C/s. This was followed by a stepwise increase in temperature from 55 to 95 °C for 81 cycles, in which the temperature was increased by 0.5 °C/cycle (30 s/cycle), with fluorescent measurements taken at each temperature increment. Standard curves for each gene were generated by serially diluting known amounts of cDNA. All of the amplifications were carried out within the linear range of the standard curves. Expression analysis and calculation of relative changes in gene expression were determined using Stratagene Mx3000Pro software. The relative expression levels were calculated by first normalizing the expression of the gene of interest to the β-actin expression level followed by taking the ratio of the normalized OPN-transfected cell value to the normalized vector-transfected control cell level.Particle Exclusion Assay—Pericellular matrices were visualized by the particle exclusion assay, as described previously (23Knudson W. Knudson C.B. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 227-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 × 104 cells were plated on 35-mm culture dishes in triplicate in standard culture medium and allowed to adhere overnight. The following day, culture medium was aspirated, and the cells were pretreated in the presence or absence of Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich) (16 units/ml in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 20 min at 37 °C. The medium was removed, and 1.0 × 108 cells/ml of gluteraldehyde-fixed sheep erythrocytes (Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp.) in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin were added to each culture dish and allowed to settle for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then viewed on a Nikon TE300 phase contrast microscope with Hoffman optics at 400× magnification. Pericellular matrices were seen as halos surrounding the cell from which the fixed erythrocytes were excluded. To quantify the amount of matrix production, 20–30 randomly selected cells were photographed, and the cell coats (matrix) and cell areas were traced using Image ProPlus 5.1 image software. The ratio of the matrix to cell area was used as an indicator of HA matrix thickness. A ratio of 1.0 indicates an absence of an organized pericellular matrix.Quantification of HA Synthesis—The concentration of HA in cell culture supernatants was determined in a competitive ELISA assay purchased from Echelon Biosciences Incorporated (product number K-1200; Salt Lake City, UT). The cells were plated in triplicate in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and allowed to grow to ∼80% confluence. The cells were then washed twice with serum-free medium (αHE + 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Fresh serum-free medium was added to each plate and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The following day, the conditioned medium was removed from each plate, centrifuged to remove any floating debris, and frozen at –80 °C. The cell counts were determined by trypsinization and counting in a hemacytometer. All of the samples were examined in triplicate according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plates were read at 405 nm, and the percentage of binding was calculated for each sample. HA concentrations were determined by comparing the percentage of binding to a standard curve of binding at known HA concentrations. The mean HA concentration for each sample was calculated and normalized to cell number. The concentrations are expressed in ng/ml/106 cells.Anchorage-independent Growth Assay—Quadruplicate plates were first layered with 2 ml of a 1:1 mixture of 1.0% agarose solution with αHE + 10% fetal bovine serum containing the appropriate selective agent (either 200 μg/ml G418 (active) or 200 μg/ml G418 plus 500 μg/ml hygromycin for antisense transfectants) and allowed to solidify for 1 h in a laminar flow hood. The cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended to a final concentration of 2.0 × 105 cells/ml. The top layer consisted of a 1:1 mixture of 0.6% agarose with αHE + 10% fetal bovine serum medium containing the appropriate selective agent and 1.0 × 104 cells, which was overlaid on the preprepared bottom layer and allowed to solidify for ∼15 min at room temperature. The plates were then incubated in a 37 °C incubator for 1 h, after which 3 ml of standard growth medium was added to each plate. The cells were allowed to grow for 3–4 weeks with fresh medium added every 3 days. To study the role of HA, activity-blocking HA oligosaccharides (o-HA) (24Zeng C. Toole B.P. Kinney S.D. Kuo J.W. Stamenkovic I. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) were obtained as a kind gift of Dr. Bryan P. Toole (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA). The cells were preincubated with 100 μg/ml HA oligomers for 30 min and then suspended 1:1 in 0.3% agarose with a final oligomer concentration of 100 μg/ml and allowed to grow undisturbed for 12 days. At the end of the incubation periods for all experiments, the cells were fixed overnight in 10% formalin and replaced with phosphate-buffered saline. Colonies greater than 150 μm were counted for each cell line across the entire plate. Statistical differences between the groups were determined with the Student's t test using Sigma Stat software. All of the experiments were performed three times with similar results.Bone Marrow Endothelial Cell Adhesion Assay—21NT control (NTCi) and OPN-transfected cells (NTOPbi) were plated in 150-mm culture dishes in standard growth medium and grown to ∼80% confluence. Human bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs) were plated at 4.5 × 104 cells/well on 48-well plates 1 day prior to the assay and allowed to grow to confluence overnight. Subconfluent 21NT-derived cells were labeled in 0.5 nm Cell Tracker Green CMFDA (Molecular Probes, Burlington, Canada), diluted in adhesion medium (αHE + 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min, followed by a 30-min incubation in standard growth medium. The cells were then trypsinized, washed in adhesion medium, and resuspended to a final concentration of 1.0 × 105 cells/ml. The cells were incubated with or without the presence of 16 units/ml Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Sigma) for 25 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation. The hyaluronidase was present throughout the duration of the assay. BMECs were washed twice with adhesion medium, and 300 μl of tumor cells were added and allowed to adhere for 20 min at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing twice with 500 μl of adhesion medium. The adherent cells were solubilized in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% SDS and 0.2 m NaOH, and fluorescence was measured in a Victor fluorescence plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 485 and 530 nm. All of the experiments were performed three times with similar results.Preparation of Stable Antisense HAS2 Transfectants—HAS2 antisense (asHAS2) and vector control (VC) plasmid constructs were a kind gift of Dr. James B. McCarthy (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN). Plasmid constructs were made using the pIRES-Hyg vector (Clontech) (19Simpson M.A. Wilson C.M. Furcht L.T. Spicer A.P. Oegema Jr., T.R. McCarthy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10050-10057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For the HAS2 anti-sense constructs, the first 300 base pairs of the HAS2 sequence, including the ATG start codon, was amplified from HAS2 plasmid DNA and cloned in the antisense orientation into pIRES-Hyg. 21NT OPN-transfected cells were transfected with FuGENE transfection regent (Roche Applied Science) in serum-free medium according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were allowed to recover in standard culture medium without antibiotics for 48 h, subcultured onto 100-mm dishes, and allowed to grow for an additional 48 h. Growth medium was then replaced with selective medium containing hygromycin (0.5 mg/ml, active) and geneticin (0.2 mg/ml, active), and clones were allowed to establish colonies. The clonal colonies were picked using cloning rings. Stable transfected cell lines were established by screening antibiotic resistant colonies. Down-regulation of HAS2 in the antisense HAS2-transfected cell line (asHAS2) was confirmed by real time PCR analysis of OPN and HAS2 expression, HA ELISA, and particle exclusion as described above and compared with vector-transfected cell line (VC). The selective growth medium was maintained in all routine culturing and experiments except where stated. Cellular morphology was comparable among all of the experimental groups.Cell Proliferation Assay—Exponentially growing cells were plated in triplicate onto the wells of a 6-well plate (2.3 × 104 cells/well). The cells were trypsinized, and cell number was determined using a hemacytometer on every second or third day of an 11-day growth period.RESULTSOPN Overexpression Results in Increased HAS2 Expression—Previously, our group performed microarray analysis on 21NT control versus 21NT OPN-transfected cells to identify genes differentially regulated by OPN (10Cook A.C. Tuck A.B. McCarthy S. Turner J.G. Irby R.B. Bloom G.C. Yeatman T.J. Chambers A.F. Mol. Carcinog. 2005; 43: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Among those genes up-regulated by OPN was the gene encoding HAS2, whose expression we confirmed by real time PCR analysis. Because HAS2 is one of three isoforms of the HAS gene family, we wished to profile the expression of all three isoforms to determine the expression patterning of these isoforms in the 21NT cells. Real time PCR analysis verified that HAS2 is indeed the most highly up-regulated isoform in the 21NT OPN-transfected cells, with an approximate 6-fold increase in expression relative to control cells (Fig. 1A). This result is consistent with our microarray data, which revealed a 5.8-fold increase in HAS2 expression. Although HAS3 expression was detected in both cell lines by real time PCR, there was no observable difference between them. HAS1 expression levels were barely detectable.OPN Overexpression Leads to Enhanced HA Production and Abnormal Accumulation of HA Matrix—To confirm that increased HAS2 expression correlated with enhanced HA production, we used a quantitative ELISA to measure the amount of secreted HA by the 21NT cell lines. 21NT OPN-transfected cells produced significantly more HA compared with their controls (Fig. 1B), secreting an average of ∼530 ng of HA/106 cells/day.Because pericellular HA has been shown to play an important role in malignant progression, we used a method of particle exclusion to visualize the matrix production and retention by the 21NT cells. In this assay, the cells are preincubated with a solution of fixed sheep erythrocytes (particles), which, based on the charge and size of HA, are excluded from the matrix surrounding a cell. Matrices are visualized by clear areas surrounding a cell. We observed significantly larger pericellular coats in the 21NT OPN-transfected cells, with a greater than 2-fold increase in matrix production compared with controls that did not form pericellular coats (Fig. 2). To confirm that these matrices were composed of HA, we pretreated the cells with Streptomyces hyaluronidase, specific for HA, prior to the addition of particles.

https://openalex.org/W2160454889,"Gene 2.5 of bacteriophage T7 encodes a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein (gp2.5) that is an essential component of the phage replisome. Similar to other prokaryotic ssDNA-binding proteins, gp2.5 has an acidic C terminus that is involved in protein-protein interactions at the replication fork and in modulation of the ssDNA binding properties of the molecule. We have used genetic and biochemical approaches to identify residues critical for the function of the C terminus of gp2.5. The presence of an aromatic residue in the C-terminal position is essential for gp2.5 function. Deletion of the C-terminal residue, phenylalanine, is detrimental to its function, as is the substitution of this residue with non-aromatic amino acids. Placing the C-terminal phenylalanine in the penultimate position also results in loss of function. Moderate shortening of the length of the acidic portion of the C terminus is tolerated when the aromatic nature of the C-terminal residue is preserved. Gradual removal of the acidic C terminus of gp2.5 results in a higher affinity for ssDNA and a decreased ability to interact with T7 DNA polymerase/thioredoxin. The replacement of the charged residues in the C terminus with neutral amino acids abolishes gp2.5 function. Our data show that both the C-terminal aromatic residue and the overall acidic charge of the C terminus of gp2.5 are critical for its function.

Essentially all DNA replication systems require a cognate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 4The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; wt, wild-type; trx, thioredoxin; SSB protein, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; hRPA, human replication protein A; cpm, counts per minute; DTT, dithiothreitol; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; RU, response units.-binding protein. The ssDNA-binding protein of bacteriophage T7 is encoded by an essential gene of the phage, gene 2.5 (1Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10173-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The gene 2.5 protein (gp2.5) contains 232 residues and appears to exist in solution as a dimer (2Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). gp2.5 binds to ssDNA with low micromolar affinity (2Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C.

Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29098-29105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). gp2.5 is one of the four proteins that comprise the T7 replisome. The other three proteins are the T7 gene 5 DNA polymerase, its processivity factor, Escherichia coli thioredoxin (trx), and the multifunctional gene 4 helicase-primase. One role of gp2.5 in vivo is almost certain to be to remove secondary structures in ssDNA that are known to impede the progress of the otherwise processive T7 DNA polymerase/thioredoxin (T7 DNA pol/trx) complex (2Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the host ssDNA-binding protein, E. coli SSB protein, is equally effective in accomplishing this role (6Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The essential nature of gp2.5 protein may rather be related to its known physical interactions with the T7 DNA pol/trx and the T7 gene 4 helicase-primase (7Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Churchich J.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical manifestations of these interactions are a slight stimulation of T7 DNA pol/trx activity on ssDNA templates and an increase in the utilization of primase recognition sites and the efficiency with which the primers are extended by T7 DNA pol/trx (24Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a gp2.5 lacking the C-terminal 26 amino acids (gp2.5Δ26) revealed a signature oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding core (OB-fold) (10Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This OB-fold is essentially superimposable with the OB-fold found in the E. coli SSB protein and in the 70-kDa subunit of the human replication protein A (hRPA) (10Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The crystallographic data also identified a dimer interface within the N-terminal one-third of the protein. Based on structural homology and amino acid sequence conservation of amino acids known to contact ssDNA in the E. coli SSB protein/ssDNA complex, a DNA binding cleft was proposed for gp2.5 as well (10Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The functional significance of both the postulated DNA binding cleft and the dimer interface were confirmed by the biochemical properties of altered gp2.5 proteins purified from several point mutants selected in a screen for in vivo lethal mutations in gene 2.5 (3Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 4Hyland E.M. Rezende L.F. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 29098-29105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). gp2.5 has an acidic C terminus, in which 15 of 21 residues have acidic side chains (Fig. 1). The presence of such an acidic C terminus is a conserved feature of all prokaryotic ssDNA-binding proteins despite the limited sequence homology (6Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 11Kelman Z. Yuzhakov A. Andjelkovic J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2436-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The removal of the acidic C termini of these proteins is lethal and results in a higher affinity of the protein for ssDNA (12Hosoda J. Moise H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7547-7558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Burke R.L. Alberts B.M. Hosoda J. J. Biol.

In addition, protein-protein interactions have been mapped to the C termini of the T4 gene 32 ssDNA-binding protein and E. coli SSB protein (13Burke R.L. Alberts B.M. Hosoda J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11484-11493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hurley J.M. Chervitz S.A. Jarvis T.C. Singer B.S. Gold L. J. Mol.

These C-terminal residues of T7 gp2.5 also define an important segment of gp2.5 because deletion of the sequence encoding these residues is lethal (7Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting protein, T7 gp2.5Δ26, binds more tightly to ssDNA and is defective in its interaction with T7 DNA pol/trx and gene 4 helicase-primase (4Hyland E.M. Rezende L.F. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7247-7256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18He Z.G. Rezende L.F. Willcox S. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29538-29545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the C terminus of gp2.5 binds to a highly positively charged segment located in the thumb subdomain of the gene 5 T7 DNA polymerase (19Hamdan S.M. Marintcheva B. Cook T. Lee S.J. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5096-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This unique fragment is also the site of binding of the processivity factor, E. coli thioredoxin and the C terminus of gene 4 helicase-primase. The multiple interactions of the C terminus of gp2.5 could thus function as switch to coordinate the multiple reactions occurring at the replication fork. We have previously shown that gp2.5 is critical for establishing coordinated leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis (20Lee J. Chastain 2nd, P.D. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Lee J. Chastain 2nd, P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In one model the acidic C terminus of gp2.5 mimics the negatively charged phosphate backbone of ssDNA and can thus bind in the positively charged DNA-binding cleft found in the crystal structure. Upon binding to ssDNA the C terminus of gp2.5 would be displaced and become available for protein-protein interactions. Unfortunately, the only available structure of gp2.5 protein is that of T7 gp2.5Δ26 lacking the C terminus. Attempts to crystallize the full-length protein were unsuccessful, suggesting that this domain is not stably folded and thus may interfere with crystal packing (10Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The in vivo screen for lethal mutations in gene 2.5 did identify residues in the C terminus that are essential for T7 growth (3Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Truncations of 12, 17, or 18 residues were lethal, as were a double (D212A/E222G) and quadruple (D212A/E222G/D227H/D232H) amino acid alteration. These deletions and amino acid substitutions all decreased the number of acidic residues within the C terminus. An intriguing lethal mutation was one that resulted in the replacement of the C-terminal phenylalanine with leucine (F232L). This altered protein, gp2.5-F232L, binds 3-fold more tightly to ssDNA and has a slightly reduced affinity for T7 DNA pol/trx when compared with wild-type gp2.5 (18He Z.G. Rezende L.F. Willcox S. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29538-29545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, it has the unique property of promoting strand-displacement DNA synthesis by T7 DNA pol/trx in the absence of the gene 4 helicase. Identification of the specific role of gp2.5 at the replication fork is elusive. Its multiple interactions with DNA and the other replication proteins have been difficult to dissect. In the present study we have identified critical determinants within the C terminus for gp2.5 function in vivo and in vitro. Not only is the acidic nature of the fragment important but surprisingly an aromatic residue at the C-terminal position is critical for a functional protein. In the accompanying article we show likewise that both of these chemical requirements must be manifested in the C terminus of the gene 4 helicase-primase (Lee et al., Ref. 33Lee S.-J. Marintcheva B. Hamden S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25841-25849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the C terminus of gene 4 protein likewise physically interacts with the highly basic thioredoxin binding domain of T7 DNA pol/trx (19Hamdan S.M. Marintcheva B. Cook T. Lee S.J. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5096-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Bacterial Strains and Phages—E. coli DH5α was used in all cloning procedures. E. coli MRI 80 (22Lopilato J. Bortner S. Beckwith J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and E. coli C600 were used for in vivo DNA complementation and DNA synthesis assays. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) was used for protein expression. Wild-type T7 and T7Δ2.5 phages were previously described (1Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10173-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Plasmids and Oligonucleotides—The parent plasmids encoding native and His-tagged versions of wild-type gp2.5 and gp2.5Δ26 lacking the 26 C-terminal residues, were provided by Lisa Rezende (Harvard Medical School) and are described in Ref. 3Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar. All oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. Construction of Plasmids Encoding Altered gp2.5 Proteins— Alterations of the sequence encoding wild-type gp2.5 were generated by PCR. All oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis contained a BamHI restriction site immediately following the stop codon of gene 2.5. An oligonucleotide encompassing nucleotides 256-287 from the gp2.5 sequence was used as a reverse primer. The generated PCR product was digested with BamHI and MluI restriction enzymes and inserted into BamHI/MluI-digested pET17bgp2.5-wt vector. The constructs expressing His-tagged versions of altered gp2.5 proteins were generated by subcloning NdeI-BamHI gp2.5-containing fragments from the corresponding pET17b constructs into pET19bPPS vector (3Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Gene Expression and Protein Purification—Native and histidine-tagged gp2.5 variants were purified from BL21(DE3)pLysS cells overexpressing their genes as previously described (3Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). T7 DNA pol/trx was purified as previously described (23Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Vivo Complementation Assay—To test the ability of the gp2.5 variants to support the growth of T7 phage lacking gene 2.5 (T7Δgp2.5), pET17b plasmids containing genes encoding altered gp2.5 proteins were transformed in E. coli strains, maintaining high (DH5α) and low (MRI80) plasmid copy number. Serial dilutions of T7Δ2.5 phage were mixed with 0.5 ml of overnight culture of E. coli cells transformed with each plasmid, 3 ml of soft agar, and ampicillin. The mixtures were overlaid on TB plates and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The plaques were counted, and the plating efficiencies calculated as a ratio between the number of plaques observed on a specific strain transformed with plasmid encoding a gp2.5 variant and the number of plaques observed on the same strain transformed with pET17bgp2.5-wt. In Vivo DNA Synthesis—E. coli MRI 80 cells were transformed with each plasmid of interest and infected with T7Δ2.5 phage. DNA synthesis was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation into acid-insoluble DNA as previously described (3Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Relative incorporation was calculated as a ratio between the radioactivity incorporated for the specific gp2.5 variant and that incorporated for E. coli transformed with pET17b empty vector. ssDNA Gel Shift Assay—5′-32P-End-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides of different length were used as a substrate to compare the ssDNA binding abilities of wild-type and altered gp2.5 proteins. The 15-μl reactions included 0.3 nm ssDNA substrate, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and various concentrations gp2.5 variants diluted in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were incubated on ice for 10 min. Bound and free DNA species were resolved on a 10% TBE Ready Gel (Bio-Rad) using 0.5× Tris/glycine buffer (12.5 mm Tris base, 95 mm glycine, and 0.5 mm EDTA). Gels were run at 150 V at 4 °C until bromphenol blue reached two-thirds of the gel length. The gels were dried, exposed to a Fujix PhosphorImager plate, and the radioactivity was measured using Image-Quant software. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis—SPR was performed using a Biacore 3000 instrument. Wild-type and genetically altered gp2.5 variants (150 response units (RU)) were immobilized on a CM-5 (carboxymethyl-5) chip using EDC/NHS chemistry. The immobilization was performed at a flow rate of 40 μl/min in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, except for the gp2.5Δ6 protein, which was immobilized at pH 4.5. The binding studies were performed in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 250 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm DTT, at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. A control flow cell was activated and blocked in absence of protein. The response units seen in the control cell were subtracted from the signal of the flow cells with immobilized protein to account for changes in the bulk refractive index. The chip surface was regenerated using 1 m NaCl at a 100 μl/min flow rate. The apparent binding constants were calculated under steady-state conditions and the data fitted using BIAEVAL 3.0.2 software (Biacore). gp2.5 Stimulation of Strand Displacement DNA Synthesis— The reaction contained 4 nm M13 template DNA, 0.3 mm of all four dNTPs (0.1 μCi of [α-32P]dGTP), 100 nm T7 DNA pol/trx, and 4 μm gp2.5. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was spotted on DE-81 filter and washed three times with 0.3 m ammonium formate, pH 8.0, and one time with 95% ethanol. The filters were dried, and the retained radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. The reaction products were also analyzed by electrophoresis through 1% alkaline agarose gel. In Vivo Analysis of Alterations in the C Terminus of gp2.5— To determine the relative importance of the individual residues within the essential C terminus of the T7 gene 2.5 protein we have carried out extensive in vitro mutagenesis. As shown on Fig. 1A the acidic C terminus of gp2.5 contains 21 amino acids of which 15 have acidic side chain (8 glutamate (E) residues and 7 aspartate (D) residues). These acidic residues occur in blocks of varying lengths, separated mainly by non-polar amino acids such as alanine, serine, and glycine known to be associated with flexibility of the polypeptide chain. The C terminus ends with the aromatic residue phenylalanine (F) that by virtue of its free carboxyl group adds another negative charge. Fig. 1 summarizes all of the modifications of the C terminus used in the present study. Table 1 summarizes the ability of these same altered genes to complement the growth of T7 phage lacking gene 2.5. These constructs will be cited at the appropriate point in the text.TABLE 1Plating efficiency of T7Δ2.5 on E. coli strains containing plasmids expressing wild-type or mutant gene 2.5 proteins The ability of the gp2.5 variants to support the growth of T7Δgp2.5 phage was tested in E. coli strains maintaining high (DH5α) and low (MRI80) plasmid copy number. The plating efficiencies were calculated as a ratio between the number of plaques observed on a specific strain transformed with a pET17b plasmid encoding the gp2.5 variant and the number of plaques observed on the same strain transformed with pET17bgp2.5-wt.gp2.5Plating efficiencyHigh copy (DH5α)Low copy (MRI80)AWt11Δ100Δ600Δ1700Δ2600BΔ1F0.70.7Δ6F0.70.6Δ17F00Δ207—2101.21.2Ins206 (WFRA)21.9CInsF231ΔF23200InsF223ΔF23200DF232C00F232R00F232E00F232Y1.21.3F232W0.91.0F232S00EUncharged00C-term gp41.71.7 Open table in a new tab The C-terminal Phenylalanine Is Essential for the Function of Gene 2.5 Protein—In earlier studies we have shown that gp2.5 proteins lacking the entire C terminus (gp2.5Δ21 and gp2.5Δ26) cannot complement for the growth of T7 phage lacking gene 2.5, T7Δ2.5 (3Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 8Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Churchich J.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inasmuch as we had attributed this phenotype to the removal of the acidic residues we were surprised to find that deletion of the C-terminal phenylalanine is as detrimental as deletion of the all C-terminal 26 residues (Table 1, A). In this initial experiment deletion mutants were constructed to progressively remove the charged residues by setting the boundaries of the deletions according to the positions of non-acidic residues. Thus gp2.5Δ1 removes the C-terminal phenylalanine, gp2.5Δ6 removes 6 residues, gpΔ17 removes 17 residues, and gpΔ26 eliminates the entire C terminus of 26 residues (Fig. 1A). To eliminate possible effects of overexpression of gene 2.5 variants from the strong T7 promoter in the pET17b vector used for cloning, all complementation experiments were performed in E. coli strains maintaining either high (DH5α) or low (MRI 80) plasmid copy number. As shown in Table 1, gp2.5Δ1 lacking the C-terminal phenylalanine could not complement for the growth of T7Δ2.5. Not surprisingly, in view of the absence of the phenylalanine in the remaining deletion mutants, none of the other deletion mutants were able to complement for growth. To determine if the inability of these deletion mutants to complement T7Δ2.5 arose from a defect in DNA synthesis, we measured the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA after T7Δ2.5 infection of cells harboring the altered gene 2.5 (Fig. 2). When wild-type gp2.5 is overexpressed from a plasmid, DNA synthesis peaks at ∼35 min after phage infection. Little, if any, DNA synthesis occurred in cells infected with each of the deletion mutants. gp2.5Δ1 is equally as defective as is gp2.5Δ26 (Fig. 2B). An Aromatic Residue at the C Terminus of Gene 2.5 Protein Is Critical for Function—The inability of gene 2.5 protein lacking its C-terminal phenylalanine to function in vivo could reflect a requirement for a specific length of the acidic C terminus or a requirement for a terminal residue of a specific chemical nature. To examine the former possibility we generated a series of gene 2.5 proteins in which internal residues were deleted from the C terminus but preserving the C-terminal phenylalanine (Fig. 1B). gp2.5Δ1F lacks the aspartic acid normally present adjacent to the phenylalanine. gp2.5Δ6F and gp2.5Δ17F lack the same acidic residues as gp2.5Δ6 and gp2.5Δ17, whereas preserving the C-terminal phenylalanine. gp2.5Δ1F and gp2.5Δ6F complemented for the growth of T7Δ2.5 phage almost as well as did wild-type gp2.5 (Table 1). The in vivo DNA synthesis assay showed that gp2.5Δ1F and gp2.5Δ6F retain 70 and 30%, respectively, of wild type ability to synthesize DNA (Fig. 2B). The more extensive deletion, gp2.5Δ17, that removes a major portion of the negative charge of the C terminus is unable to complement regardless of presence or absence of C-terminal phenylalanine. We also shortened and lengthened the distance of the C-terminal phenylalanine from the OB-fold harboring the ssDNA binding site by inserting (gp2.5Ins206(WFRA)207) or deleting (gp2.5Δ207-210) four amino acids just before the beginning of the acidic C terminus at position 207. These altered gene 2.5 proteins having an intact C terminus functioned normally (Table 1, B and Fig. 2A). The finding that up to six residues can be deleted from the C terminus without a deleterious effect suggests strongly that a simple shortening of the fragment does not explain the defect arising from the deletion of the phenylalanine. Is the location of the phenylalanine as the C-terminal amino acid important or is there simply a requirement for a phenylalanine near the C terminus? To address this question we switched the two C-terminal residues such that aspartic acid is now the C-terminal residue and phenylalanine is adjacent as second residue (gp2. 5InsF231ΔF232) (Fig. 1C). Likewise phenylalanine was removed from the C-terminal position and inserted ten residues distal to the C terminus (gp2.5InsF222ΔF232). Neither gene 2.5 construct could complement for the growth of T7Δ2.5 (Table 1, C) or support DNA synthesis (data not shown). Clearly the phenylalanine must occupy the C-terminal position. To gain insight into the properties of phenylalanine that gives rise to its essential role we constructed a series of gene 2.5 proteins in which various amino acids replaced the C-terminal phenylalanine (Fig. 1D). As seen in Table 1, D of the six amino acid substitutions only those proteins in which tyrosine (gp2.5-F232Y) and tryptophan (gp2.5-F232W) occupied the C-terminal position could function in vivo. gp2.5-F232Y and gp2.5F232W retain ∼90% of the wild type ability to incorporate radioactive thymidine (Fig. 2C). In contrast, substitutions of positively charged (arginine), negatively charged (glutamic acid), small (serine), or sulfhydryl-containing (cysteine) residues resulted in loss of function. As mentioned earlier, gp2.5-F322L was selected in an in vivo screen for lethal mutations (3Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and was characterized biochemically (18He Z.G. Rezende L.F. Willcox S. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29538-29545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These results imply that the aromatic nature of the C-terminal residue is critical for gp2.5 function. Contribution of Acidic Residues—The essential nature of the phenylalanine does not rule out an equally important role for the acidic properties of the C terminus. The interaction between gp2.5 and T7 DNA pol/trx is salt-sensitive, suggesting involvement of charged residues (8Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Churchich J.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, recent studies on the binding of gp2.5 to the T7 DNA pol/trx show that at least a part of that interaction is mediated by charged residues in the thioredoxin-binding domain of the DNA polymerase (19Hamdan S.M. Marintcheva B. Cook T. Lee S.J. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5096-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The loss of function for gp2.5Δ17F shown above also suggests that charge may be important but the decrease in length of the protein might also contribute to the loss. On the other hand, some of the charge is clearly dispensable in that gp2.5Δ6F lacking four of the acidic residues is still functional, although exhibiting diminished ability to synthesize DNA in vivo. To separate the contribution of charge from that of length of the acidic C terminus we have maintained the length of the C terminus while varying the acidic content. The replacement of all acidic residues with uncharged residues, i.e. glutamate with glutamine and aspartate with asparagines (Fig. 1E), resulted in a nonfunctional protein (Table 1, E). We also replaced the C-terminal 17 residues of gp2.5 with the 17 C-t"
https://openalex.org/W2014054744,"The chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs) are ""orphan"" members of the nuclear hormone receptor (NR) superfamily. COUP-TFs are involved in organogenesis and neurogenesis. However, their role in skeletal muscle (and other major mass tissues) and metabolism remains obscure. Skeletal muscle accounts for approximately 40% of total body mass and energy expenditure. Moreover, this peripheral tissue is a primary site of glucose and fatty acid utilization. We utilize small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated attenuation of Coup-TfI and II (mRNA and protein) in a skeletal muscle cell culture model to understand the regulatory role of Coup-Tfs in this energy demanding tissue. This targeted NR repression resulted in the significant attenuation of genes that regulate lipid mobilization and utilization (including Pparalpha, Fabp3, and Cpt-1). This was coupled to reduced fatty acid beta-oxidation. Additionally we observed significant attenuation of Ucp1, a gene involved in energy expenditure. Concordantly, we observed a 5-fold increase in ATP levels in cells with siRNA-mediated repression of Coup-TfI and II. Furthermore, the expression of ""classical"" liver X receptor (LXR) target genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport (Abca1 and Abcg1) were both significantly repressed. Moreover, we observed that repression of the Coup-Tfs ablated the activation of Abca1, and Abcg1 mRNA expression by the selective LXR agonist, T0901317. In concordance, Coup-Tf-siRNA-transfected cells were refractory to Lxr-mediated reduction of total intracellular cholesterol levels in contrast to the negative control cells. In agreement Lxr-mediated activation of the Abca1 promoter in Coup-Tf-siRNA cells was attenuated. Collectively, these data suggest a pivotal role for Coup-Tfs in the regulation of lipid utilization/cholesterol homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells and the modulation of Lxr-dependent gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2070447615,"Regulation of the terminal stage of viral DNA development, DNA packaging, is poorly understood. A new phage T4 in vitro DNA packaging assay employed purified proheads, terminase (gp17 + gp16), and ATP to encapsidate DNA resistant to nuclease. Mature phage T4 DNA and linearized plasmid DNAs containing or lacking a cloned T4 gene were packaged with high (approximately 10%) efficiency. Supercoiled, relaxed covalently closed, and nicked circular plasmid DNAs were packaged inefficiently, if at all, by these components. However, efficient packaging is achieved for nicked circular plasmid DNA, but not covalently closed plasmid DNA, upon addition to packaging mixtures of the purified T4 late transcription-replication machinery proteins: gp45 (sliding clamp), gp44/gp62 (clamp loader complex), gp55 (late sigma-factor), and gp33 (transcriptional co-activator). The small terminase subunit (gp16) is inhibitory for packaging linear DNAs, but enhances the transcription-replication protein packaging of nicked plasmid DNA. Taken together with genetic and biochemical evidence of a requirement for gp55 for concatemer packaging to assemble active wild-type phage particles (1), the plasmid packaging results show that initiation of phage T4 packaging on endless concatemeric DNA in vivo by terminase depends upon interaction with the DNA loaded gp45 coupled late transcription-replication machinery. The results suggest a close mechanistic connection in vivo between DNA packaging and developmentally concurrent replication-dependent late transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2160833611,"The structural analysis of surface proteins belonging to the CD2 subset of the immunoglobulin superfamily has yielded important insights into transient cellular interactions. In mice and rats, CD2 and CD244 (2B4), which are expressed predominantly on T cells and natural killer cells, respectively, bind the same, broadly expressed ligand, CD48. Structures of CD2 and CD244 have been solved previously, and we now present the structure of the receptor-binding domain of rat CD48. The receptor-binding surface of CD48 is unusually flat, as in the case of rat CD2, and shares a high degree of electrostatic complementarity with the equivalent surface of CD2. The relatively simple arrangement of charged residues and this flat topology explain why CD48 cross-reacts with CD2 and CD244 and, in rats, with the CD244-related protein, 2B4R. Comparisons of modeled complexes of CD2 and CD48 with the complex of human CD2 and CD58 are suggestive of there being substantial plasticity in the topology of ligand binding by CD2. Thermodynamic analysis of the native CD48-CD2 interaction indicates that binding is driven by equivalent, weak enthalpic and entropic effects, in contrast to the human CD2-CD58 interaction, for which there is a large entropic barrier. Overall, the structural and biophysical comparisons of the CD2 homologues suggest that the evolutionary diversification of interacting cell surface proteins is rapid and constrained only by the requirement that binding remains weak and specific."
https://openalex.org/W2154207026,"The gene 4 protein of bacteriophage T7 plays a central role in DNA replication by providing both helicase and primase activities. The C-terminal helicase domain is not only responsible for DNA-dependent dTTP hydrolysis, translocation, and DNA unwinding, but it also interacts with T7 DNA polymerase to coordinate helicase and polymerase activities. The C-terminal 17 residues of gene 4 protein are critical for its interaction with the T7 DNA polymerase/thioredoxin complex. This C terminus is highly acidic; replacement of these residues with uncharged residues leads to a loss of interaction with T7 DNA polymerase/thioredoxin and an increase in oligomerization of the gene 4 protein. Such an alteration on the C terminus results in a reduced efficiency in strand displacement DNA synthesis catalyzed by gene 4 protein and T7 DNA polymerase/thioredoxin. Replacement of the C-terminal amino acid, phenylalanine, with non-aromatic residues also leads to a loss of interaction of gene 4 protein with T7 DNA polymerase/thioredoxin. However, neither of these modifications of the C terminus affects helicase and primase activities. A chimeric gene 4 protein containing the acidic C terminus of the T7 gene 2.5 single-stranded DNA-binding protein is more active in strand displacement synthesis. Gene 4 hexamers containing even one subunit of a defective C terminus are defective in their interaction with T7 DNA polymerase.

Gene 4 hexamers containing even one subunit of a defective C terminus are defective in their interaction with T7 DNA polymerase. The replisome of bacteriophage T7 consists of only four proteins: three phage-encoded proteins (gene 2.5 ssDNA 2The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; DTT, dithiothreitol; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; nt, nucleotide; trx, thioredoxin.-binding protein, gene 4 helicase-primase, and gene 5 DNA polymerase) and one host protein Escherichia coli thioredoxin (trx) as a processivity factor. Nonetheless, this simple replisome mediates a coordinated synthesis of leading and lagging strands using a double-strand template (1Lee J. Chastain P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The limited number of components suggests that T7 has evolved a replisome in which individual protein functions in several capacities via multiple interactions with the other components of the replisome. Such an example is the coexistence of both helicase and primase activities in a single polypeptide, the T7 gene 4 protein. This tandem organization of two essential enzyme domains assures that the primase can immediately access ssDNA template generated as the tethered helicase domain unwinds dsDNA (2Richardson C.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 315-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). E. coli thioredoxin binds to a unique loop in T7 gene 5 DNA polymerase with a strong binding affinity of a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range (3Huber H.E. Russel M. Model P. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15006-15012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another equally important interaction occurs between T7 DNA polymerase and the helicase domain of gene 4 protein. Although T7 DNA polymerase/thioredoxin (T7 DNA pol/trx) complex catalyzes processive DNA synthesis on ssDNA templates (3Huber H.E. Russel M. Model P. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15006-15012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it cannot polymerize nucleotides through duplex DNA (strand displacement synthesis) (4Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9831-9839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the helicase domain of gene 4 protein is required for unwinding of duplex DNA to expose ssDNA template. To coordinate helicase unwinding of the DNA with the polymerization of nucleotides by T7 DNA pol/trx, an interaction of the two proteins is essential. Likewise, gene 2.5 ssDNA-binding protein must interact with both the T7 DNA pol/trx and gene 4 protein in order for them to function on gene 2.5 protein-coated DNA. In the accompanying article (19Marintcheva B. Hamdan S.M. Lee S.-J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25831-25840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we explored this interaction of gene 2.5 protein. Because each protein component of the replisome contributes its own unique function to the replication process, there is no reason to anticipate any sequence or structural homology among the proteins. In the accompanying article (19Marintcheva B. Hamdan S.M. Lee S.-J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25831-25840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we described the interactions of the C-terminal region of the gene 2.5 ssDNA-binding protein with other components of the replisome. These interactions were dependent not only on the acidic nature of the C terminus but also on the presence of phenylalanine as the C-terminal residue. Interestingly, the gene 4 helicase-primase also has a C terminus rich in acidic amino acids and a phenylalanine as the C-terminal residue. The C-terminal region of the gene 4 protein did not diffract in the crystal structure (5Sawaya M.R. Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1999; 99: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 6Toth E.A. Li Y. Sawaya M.R. Cheng Y. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1113-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and taken together with the inability of a full-length gene 2.5 protein to crystallize it raises the possibility that the C terminus is quite flexible. Such a speculation was supported by studies in which deletion of the C termini of these proteins abolished their ability to interact with DNA polymerase (7Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Notarnicola S.M. Mulcahy H.L. Lee J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18425-18433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that the thioredoxin-binding domain of T7 DNA polymerase contacts the acidic tails of both gene 4 and gene 2.5 proteins, an interaction that is also enhanced by the binding of thioredoxin (9Hamdan S.M. Marintcheva B. Cook T. Lee S.J. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5096-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we showed that deletion of the 17 C-terminal residues of gene 4 protein results in an inability to physically interact with T7 DNA polymerase. The absence of this interaction prevents the helicase and T7 DNA pol/trx from mediating strand displacement DNA synthesis (8Notarnicola S.M. Mulcahy H.L. Lee J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18425-18433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Whereas this earlier study clearly showed that the helicase domain of gene 4 protein interacts with polymerase via its C-terminal during leading strand DNA synthesis, it did not address the properties of the C terminus important for this interaction. Furthermore, the finding in the accompanying article (19Marintcheva B. Hamdan S.M. Lee S.-J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25831-25840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that the C-terminal phenylalanine of gene 2.5 protein is equally as important as the acidic nature of the C terminus both in vivo and in vitro warranted an examination of the role of this same residue in the gene 4 protein. Thus, a comparison of the properties of the C termini of the two proteins could hopefully elucidate the important role of these two almost identical segments in these two essential proteins. To investigate mechanistic details of the interaction with T7 DNA pol/trx at the C terminus of gene 4 protein, we constructed a variety of alterations on the C-terminal region and their effects on the protein function were examined. Materials—Oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technology. Restriction endonucleases and Deep Vent® polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs. T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, radiolabeled nucleotides, and high molecular weight protein markers were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Agarose and exonuclease-free T7 DNA polymerase were from USB Corp. T7 DNA polymerase/Escherichia coli thioredoxin complex, M13mp18 ssDNA, and a primer used for strand displacement DNA synthesis assay were kindly provided by Donald Johnson (Harvard Medical School). Sensor chips and coupling reagents for surface resonance plasmon assay were from Biacore (Uppsala, Sweden). Construction of Plasmids and Purification of Gene 4 Proteins—Plasmids that express gene 4 containing alterations in the sequence encoding the C terminus were constructed as described previously (10Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27198-27207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the coding region for gene 4 of the plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis, proteins were overexpressed in E. coli HMS 174(DE3) by IPTG induction and then purified following a standard procedure (11Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49419-49426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were all greater than 95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis and staining with Coomassie Blue. Biochemical Assays of Gene 4 Protein—All assays (DNA unwinding, template-directed oligoribonucleotide synthesis, oligomerization, strand displacement DNA synthesis, RNA-primed DNA synthesis, and gel mobility shift assays) were carried out at 37 °C and used a reaction buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, and 50 mm potassium glutamate plus additional components described in each assay. Except as noted below, all assays were carried out as described previously (12Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23384-23393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Strand Displacement DNA Synthesis—Either M13 dsDNA containing a 5′-non-complementary ssDNA region or a minicircle containing a replication fork was used as a template. The M13 template was prepared by annealing a 66-mer primer (5′-T36AATTC GTAAT CATGG TCATA GCTGT TTCCT-3′) to M13 ssDNA in 10 mm NaCl and then extending its 3′-end with T7 DNA pol/trx in the presence of 0.3 mm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dGTP at 37 °C for 30 min. The preparation of the minicircular template was described previously (1Lee J. Chastain P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The reaction contained either the M13 DNA template (10 nm)orthe minicircle template (60 nm), 0.3 mm of all four dNTPs (0.1 μCi of [α-32P]dGTP or dTTP), 20 nm T7 DNA pol/trx, and the indicated amounts of gene 4 protein. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min for the M13 template reaction or 10 min for the minicircle template reaction, the reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were spotted on DE-81 membrane and washed three times with 0.3 m ammonium formate (pH 8.0). The amount of DNA synthesis was determined by measuring incorporation of radioactive dNMP into DNA retained on the membrane. The reaction products were also analyzed by electrophoresis through 0.6% alkaline agarose gel. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—In the presence of ssDNA and a non-hydrolyzable dTTP analog, T7 DNA pol/trx and gene 4 protein form a stable complex that can be distinguished from oligomeric gene 4 protein by its migration on a non-denaturing gel (8Notarnicola S.M. Mulcahy H.L. Lee J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18425-18433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The reaction contained 2.4 μm gene 4 protein, 1.8 μm exonuclease-free T7 DNA polymerase, 100 nm 5′-32P-radiolabeled 24-mer ssDNA (CGCCA GGGTT TTCCC AGTCA CGAC), and 0.5 mm β,γ-methylene dTTP. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the reaction mixture was loaded on a 5% non-denaturing gel, and electrophoresis was performed with a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 190 mm glycine, and 10 mm Mg(OAc)2. After electrophoresis at room temperature for 3 h, the gel was dried for autoradiography. Surface Plasmon Resonance Assay—SPR analysis was performed by using a Biacore-3000 instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). Various gene 4 proteins were coupled via primary amine groups to the carboxymethyl-5 (CM-5) chip at a concentration of 100 μg/ml in NaOAc (pH 5.0) as described previously (9Hamdan S.M. Marintcheva B. Cook T. Lee S.J. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5096-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A control flow cell, which was activated and blocked in the absence of protein, was used to subtract the bulk refractive index and nonspecific interactions. Binding studies were performed at room temperature at a flow rate of 40 μl/min in running buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 250 mm potassium glutamate, and 0.005% Tween 20 (v/v). The surface of the chip was regenerated by two injections of running buffer containing 1 m NaCl. The observed dissociation binding constant, KD, was calculated using the average response units under steady-state conditions as described previously (9Hamdan S.M. Marintcheva B. Cook T. Lee S.J. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5096-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Data were fitted using the steady-state model provided by BIAEVAL 3.0.2 computational software (Biacore). A previous study showed that the C terminus of the gene 4 protein is critical for its interaction with the T7 DNA pol/trx complex during leading strand DNA synthesis (8Notarnicola S.M. Mulcahy H.L. Lee J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18425-18433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The deletion of the C-terminal 17 amino acid residues does not affect the activities of the protein with regards to primer synthesis, dTTP hydrolysis, and DNA unwinding. However, the deletion of the C-terminal region abolished a proper interaction with T7 DNA pol/trx, a loss that resulted in a failure of the proteins to carry out strand displacement DNA synthesis. The C terminus of gene 4 protein is unique in two respects. One is its high content of acidic residues; 8 of the 17 residues are negatively charged. The other unique feature is the C-terminal aromatic residue, phenylalanine. In general, neither of these two features is conserved in other replicative helicases. Interestingly, another protein involved in T7 replication, gene 2.5 ssDNA-binding protein has both features (19Marintcheva B. Hamdan S.M. Lee S.-J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25831-25840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the early study clearly demonstrated the importance of the C-terminal of gene 4 protein in strand displacement DNA synthesis, it is not known what features of the C-terminal region are responsible for its critical interaction with T7 DNA polymerase. Considering the known interaction of both gene 2.5 protein and gene 4 protein with T7 DNA pol/trx (9Hamdan S.M. Marintcheva B. Cook T. Lee S.J. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5096-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), it is clearly important to understand how this motif common to both gene 4 and gene 2.5 proteins mediates this interaction. To achieve this end, we introduced a variety of alterations in the C terminus of the gene 4 protein (Fig. 1). First, we replaced all 7 acidic residues, aspartic acids and glutamic acids in the 17 residue C terminus with asparagines and glutamines, respectively (gp4-uncharged in Fig. 1). Second, the C-terminal phenylalanine was replaced with aspartic acid, leucine, or tyrosine (gp4-F566D, -L, and -Y in Fig. 1). These alterations allow us to investigate separately the effect of either the acidic characteristics or the last aromatic residue on function. We also created a chimeric gene 4 protein in which the C-terminal 17 residues were replaced with the corresponding region from gene 2.5 protein (gp4-c-term gp2.5 in Fig. 1). The chimeric protein maintains the last phenylalanine residue but has five additional acidic residues. The altered proteins were purified from E. coli cells overexpressing the altered gene 4 in plasmids (11Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49419-49426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). DNA Unwinding—The effect of the C-terminal alterations on the helicase activity of the gene 4 protein was examined using a mini-replication fork as DNA substrate. To unwind the substrate, a functional gene 4 protein first assembles as a hexamer on the ssDNA region of the DNA substrate, translocates in the 5′ to 3′ direction, and then unwinds the duplex DNA. The radioactively labeled displaced strand can be measured by gel electrophoresis. This assay can thus detect a defect in one of those activities of gene 4 helicase. Results of the assay shown in Fig. 2A indicate that all altered proteins unwound the substrate as efficiently as did the wild-type protein. We also separately examined the ability of the proteins to hydrolyze dTTP in the presence of ssDNA. No differences between the wild-type protein and the altered proteins were observed (data not shown). Primer Synthesis—The primase domain of gene 4 protein catalyzes the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides in a template-directed reaction (13Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tetraribonucleotides generated at specific recognition sequences can then be used as primers by T7 DNA pol/trx. The ability of the altered gene 4 proteins to produce oligoribonucleotides was examined by incubating a 15-mer ssDNA template containing a primase recognition sequence, 5′-GGGTC-3′,[α-32P]CTP and ATP, with the gene 4 proteins. The radioactively labeled tetraribonucleotide products can then be measured on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig. 2B, all of the altered gene 4 proteins synthesized oligoribonucleotides as well as did the wild-type protein. Oligomerization of Gene 4 Protein—As discussed above, the functional form of the gene 4 protein is a hexamer. The presence of β,γ-methylene dTTP, ssDNA and Mg2+ facilitates the oligomerization of the gene 4 protein and the oligomerization can be detected by electrophoresis of the proteins on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. At room temperature wild-type gene 4 protein is present as monomers as well as oligomers (Fig. 3A). Gp4-Δ17, lacking the C terminus, gives rise to a greater abundance of the oligomeric species. Likewise, eliminating the negative charges in the C terminus as in gp4-uncharged also leads to a greater degree of oligomerization. The precise oligomeric state of these gene 4 proteins is not known but molecular weight species larger than hexamers and heptamers have been visualized (12Lee S.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23384-23393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Eliminating or altering the C-terminal phenylalanine has no effect. On the other hand, the chimeric protein with the C terminus of gene 2.5 protein clearly oligomerizes to a lesser extent than does the wild-type protein. The chimeric protein has five additional acidic residues and thus further strengthens the argument that increasing the negative charge in this region decreases oligomerization. At 4 °C the formation of oligomers is enhanced and this enhancement is seen with the wild-type protein where all the monomers are now present in two high molecular weight species (Fig. 3B). The general pattern of oligomerization seen at room temperature with each of the altered proteins is again apparent but the decreased oligomerization with the chimeric protein is more apparent. Enzymatic Interactions of Gene 4 Protein with T7 DNA Pol/trx—Gene 4 protein supplies two vital activities at the T7 replication fork. For leading strand synthesis to occur, the helicase domain of gene 4 protein, assembled on the lagging strand as a hexamer, must unwind the duplex DNA to expose a ssDNA template for the leading strand DNA polymerase. To coordinate these activities, a physical interaction must occur between the polymerase and helicase domain of gene 4 protein. As ssDNA is extruded behind the translocating helicase, the primase domain of gene 4 protein must synthesize tetraribonucleotides and hold them in position until the lagging strand DNA polymerase can use them as primers. Tetraribonucleotides themselves cannot serve as primers for T7 DNA pol/trx unless they are bound to the gene 4 protein. We have examined those two interactions of the gene 4 protein with polymerases. In the first assay, the interaction of gene 4 protein with T7 DNA pol/trx during strand displacement DNA synthesis was examined. A primer-template consisting of a circular M13 dsDNA molecule in which one of the two strands bears a 36-nt ssDNA tail resembles a replication fork (see inset to Fig. 4A). The 5′-ssDNA provides a site for the assembly of the hexameric gene 4 protein. Upon the addition of T7 DNA pol/trx and dNTPs, the two proteins act together to mediate strand displacement synthesis. As shown in Fig. 4A, there is essentially no strand displacement synthesis in the absence of gene 4 protein but upon the addition of increasing amounts of wild-type gene 4 protein, there is a dramatic stimulation of DNA synthesis. The products of DNA synthesis obtained with wild-type gene 4 protein represent many circumnavigations of the protein complex around the 7,249-nt M13 DNA as measured by electrophoresis of the products through an alkaline agarose gel where the larger products of synthesis exceed the resolving power of the gel (lane 2 in Fig. 4B). Gene 4 protein lacking the C terminus (gp4-Δ17), as previously shown (8Notarnicola S.M. Mulcahy H.L. Lee J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18425-18433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), is unable to interact with T7 DNA pol/trx to mediate strand displacement synthesis (Fig. 4, A and B). Retention of the C terminus but elimination of the acidic residues (gp4-uncharged) is likewise detrimental to this interaction. Most interestingly, replacement of the C-terminal phenylalanine with a non-aromatic residue (gp4-F566L or gp4-F566D) reduces the ability of the altered gene 4 protein to promote strand displacement synthesis greater than 2- or 5-fold, respectively. The absence of high molecular products with these two altered proteins (lanes 5 and 6 in Fig. 4B) dramatically attests to this defect. Substitution of another aromatic residue, tyrosine, for the C-terminal phenylalanine is well tolerated (Fig. 4, A and B). This requirement for a C-terminal aromatic residue mimics the same requirement found in gene 2.5 protein for its interaction with T7 DNA pol/trx (19Marintcheva B. Hamdan S.M. Lee S.-J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25831-25840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the chimeric gene 4 protein containing the C terminus of gene 2.5 protein (gp4-c-term gp2.5) has enhanced strand displacement activity, perhaps due to its higher content of acidic residues (Fig. 4A, lane 8 in Fig. 4B). We have also used the 70-nt minicircle primer-template previously described (1Lee J. Chastain P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) to examine the ability of the altered gene 4 proteins to mediate leading strand DNA synthesis (Fig. 4C). Essentially the same results were observed as found for the M13 DNA primer-template just discussed. In the second assay, we tested the ability of various gene 4 proteins to synthesize and deliver oligoribonucleotides to T7 DNA pol/trx for RNA-primed DNA synthesis on M13 ssDNA. Oligoribonucleotides are synthesized from specific recognition sites on the template DNA by the primase domain of gene 4 protein and proper delivery of the primers to T7 DNA pol/trx allows synthesis of dsDNA. Essentially, all the gene 4 proteins demonstrated the same level of DNA synthesis proportional to the amount of gene 4 protein as measured by incorporation of dNMP into dsDNA (Fig. 5). The results indicate that the alterations at the C-terminal of gene 4 protein do not affect the interaction between the primase domain of gene 4 protein and DNA polymerase. Because this RNA-primed assay requires activity of gene 4 protein to both synthesize primer and translocate on a long ssDNA template to search for primase recognition sites, these results also confirmed that all of the altered proteins have similar ability to synthesize oligoribonucleotide (Fig. 2B) and translocate on ssDNA (Fig. 2A). Physical Associations of Gene 4 Protein with T7 DNA Pol/trx—Inasmuch as all the altered gene 4 proteins unwind duplex DNA as efficiently as does the wild-type protein (Fig. 2A), their inability to function with T7 DNA pol/trx to mediate strand displacement synthesis most likely arises from a defect in a proper interaction between the two proteins. Therefore, we have examined complex formation using two independent techniques: gel mobility shift assay and surface plasmon resonance. It has been shown previously that the interaction between the two proteins can be detected by gel mobility shift assay (8Notarnicola S.M. Mulcahy H.L. Lee J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18425-18433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the presence of a non-hydrolyzable dTTP, binding of gene 4 protein to ssDNA is significantly enhanced and thus a stable DNA-gene 4 protein complex can be detected by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Addition of T7 DNA pol/trx to the reaction leads to form a stable ternary complex between the DNA-gene 4 protein complex and T7 DNA pol/trx, distinct from the binary complex. The ability of the altered gene 4 proteins to form such a ternary complex with DNA and T7 DNA pol/trx is shown in Fig. 6A. Consistent with earlier results (8Notarnicola S.M. Mulcahy H.L. Lee J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18425-18433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), T7 DNA pol/trx alone did not form a stable complex with ssDNA (lane 2 in Fig. 6A). Gene 4 protein alone forms a binary complex with ssDNA (lane 3) and upon the addition of T7 DNA pol/trx there is a further shift to the slower migrating ternary complex (lane 4), consistent with earlier studies. We have used Western blot analysis to confirm that the slower migrating band seen in lane 4 of Fig. 6A contains both gene 4 protein and DNA polymerase (data not shown). Gp4-Δ17, gp4-uncharged, and gp4-F566D were unable to form a stable ternary complex with DNA and T7 DNA pol/trx (lanes 5-10) whereas gp4-F566L, gp4-F566Y, and gp4-c-term gp2.5 did (lanes 11-16). Measurements of the interaction of gene 4 proteins using surface plasmon resonance confirm the results obtained with the gel shift assays (Fig. 6B). In this assay the gene 4 proteins were immobilized via their amine groups to the Biacore CM-5 chip and T7 DNA pol/trx was injected over the chip at varying concentrations. Using steady state analysis, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” we calculated the KD for the various protein interactions. Both the wild-type gene 4 protein and gp4-F566Y interact with a KD of 575 and 760 nm, respectively. Gp4-c-term gp2.5 forms a considerably more stable complex with a KD of 450 nm. Gp4-F566L binds weakly to T7 DNA pol/trx, and no binding was observed with gp4-Δ17. We do not know why the gel shift assay reveals relatively stable ternary complex with T7 DNA pol/trx and gp4-F566L unless the presence of ssDNA in some way compensates for the clearly weaker interaction of the two proteins observed by surface plasmon resonance. This altered protein did support some, albeit low, strand displacement synthesis (Fig. 4) consistent with weak binding between the two proteins. Because gene 4 protein functions as hexamer, a defect in the C terminus of one subunit might affect the ability of adjacent subunits to interact with the polyme"

The interaction of eIF4G (or its isoform, eIFiso4G) and eIF4B with PABP synergistically increases the binding affinity of PABP for poly(A) RNA, whereas the interaction of PABP with eIFiso4G increases the binding of eIFiso4F (an isoform of eIF4F) to the cap (4Le H.

Addition of eIF4B to eIFiso4F or the eIFiso4F-PABP complex lowers the activation energy of binding of each to the 5′ cap in plants (10Luo Y. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43083-43086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Khan M.A. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4510-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that eIF4B and PABP enhance binding by providing a lower energy barrier that may involve a conformational change that is propagated to the cap binding site. Thus, eIF4B, together with PABP, promotes stable recruitment of eIF4F to an mRNA by accelerating its binding to, and reducing its dissociation from, the 5′ cap (11Khan M.A. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4510-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The interaction between PABP and eIF4G, and presumably eIF4B, brings the termini of an mRNA in close physical proximity as demonstrated in vitro (12Wells S.E. Hillner P.E. Vale R.D. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 135-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) to serve as a means test to confirm the integrity of an mRNA as a prerequisite for recruitment of the 40 S subunit (13Gallie D.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 585-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Once recruited, the 40 S subunit scans down the 5′-leader in search of the first initiation codon present in the appropriate context (14Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). eIF4A serves as an RNA helicase thought to unwind any secondary structure present in the 5′-leader that would otherwise impede scanning of the 40 S subunit. Alone, eIF4A exhibits little RNA helicase activity (15Lawson T.G. Lee K.A. Maimone M.M. Abramson R.D. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Thach R.E.

In contrast, wheat eIF4B only moderately stimulates but is not required for the ATP hydrolysis and RNA helicase activities of eIF4A (26Lax S. Fritz W. Browning K. Ravel J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

In addition to stimulating eIF4A activity, eIF4B mediates mRNA binding to ribosomes (31Trachsel H. Erni B. Schreier M.H. Staehelin T. J. Mol.

Translation from mRNAs with a moderately stable secondary structure in the 5′ leader is highly stimulated by eIF4B in yeast, whereas the higher basal level of translation from mRNAs with little secondary structure is only moderately stimulated (21Altmann M. Muller P.P. Wittmer B. Ruchti F. Lanker S. Trachsel H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3997-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) supporting a role for eIF4B in promoting eIF4A RNA helicase activity. In animals, in vitro assembly of 48 S translation initiation complexes on mRNAs with moderately stable secondary structure in the 5′ leader also requires eIF4B (36Dmitriev S. Terenin I. Dunaevsky Y. Merrick W. Shatsky I.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8925-8933Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) but only native and not recombinant eIF4B was active in this assay. Thus, eIF4B functions to stabilize eIF4F binding to the 5′ cap, PABP binding to the poly(A) tail, and mRNA binding to ribosomes while stimulating eIF4A activity, demonstrating that it performs multiple functions through interactions with several factors and RNA to facilitate translation initiation. Mammalian eIF4B contains an N-proximal RNA recognition motif (RRM), a hydrophilic region rich in aspartic acid, arginine, tyrosine, and glycine residues (DRYG) responsible for dimerization and binding to eIF3a, a C-terminal RNA binding domain, and a C-proximal serine-rich region (18Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W. Davies M.V. Kelleher K. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2783-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Methot N. Pause A. Hershey J. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell.

The C-terminal RNA binding domain contains two clusters of arginine-rich sequences that may be involved in RNA binding. Iterative RNA selection in vitro demonstrated that a purine-rich sequence was the preferred substrate for the N-terminal RRM, whereas the C-terminal RNA binding domain showed little specificity (39Methot N. Pickett G. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1996; 2: 38-50Google Scholar). A feature of the RNAs selected for binding by the RRM was that they formed a stem-loop structure where a conserved Ala residue was typically part of a bulge in the structure. A poly(A)-rich sequence predominated when eIF4A was included during RNA selection although eIF4A alone did not exhibit any binding preference (39Methot N. Pickett G. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1996; 2: 38-50Google Scholar). Moreover, the C-terminal RNA binding domain did not alter the specificity of the RRM or its binding affinity (39Methot N. Pickett G. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1996; 2: 38-50Google Scholar). Deletion of the RNP-1 motif within the RRM or mutation of conserved residues within the RNP-1 substantially reduced RNA binding (37Naranda T. Strong W.B. Menaya J. Fabbri B.J. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14465-14472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Methot N. Pickett G. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1996; 2: 38-50Google Scholar). eIF4B also bound 18 S rRNA with high affinity and this binding could be competed by a purine-rich sequence, suggesting that the eIF4B RRM was responsible for the binding and may have bound a purine-rich sequence within the 18 S rRNA (39Methot N. Pickett G. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1996; 2: 38-50Google Scholar). Each RNA binding domain functions independently as eIF4B is able to bind two RNA molecules simultaneously (i.e. a purine-rich and nonspecific RNA) (39Methot N. Pickett G. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1996; 2: 38-50Google Scholar). Although this ability has been suggested to be the basis for its RNA annealing activity (39Methot N. Pickett G. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1996; 2: 38-50Google Scholar), those RNAs bound by eIF4B have not been identified and therefore the purpose of its preferential binding to purine-rich RNA is unknown. Yeast eIF4B is significantly shorter at the C terminus (21Altmann M. Muller P.P. Wittmer B. Ruchti F. Lanker S. Trachsel H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3997-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 40Coppolecchia R. Buser P. Stotz A. Linder P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4005-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and lacks the serine-rich domain that is present in mammalian eIF4B although no role has been identified for this domain. Like eIF4B in animals, yeast eIF4B contains an N-terminal RRM and it, together with the N-proximal three of the seven repeat motifs present in yeast eIF4B, were sufficient to complement the cold-sensitive and temperature-sensitive growth phenotypes of eIF4B null yeast, stimulate translation in vitro, and perform RNA strand-exchange (41Niederberger N. Trachsel H. Altmann M. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1998; 4: 1259-1267Google Scholar). However, the C-terminal region and the seven repeat motifs also exhibited some RNA strand-exchange activity and conferred partial complementation of the growth phenotypes. Like mammalian eIF4B, a second region exhibiting RNA binding activity is present in the C-terminal two-thirds of yeast eIF4B, although it was unresolved whether the region containing the repeat motifs or the C-terminal domain was responsible for this (41Niederberger N. Trachsel H. Altmann M. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1998; 4: 1259-1267Google Scholar). The yeast RRM did not bind to 18 S rRNA, 25 S rRNA, or poly(A)-containing RNA, demonstrating a significant difference with mammalian eIF4B (39Methot N. Pickett G. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1996; 2: 38-50Google Scholar, 41Niederberger N. Trachsel H. Altmann M. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1998; 4: 1259-1267Google Scholar). eIF4B from wheat was shown to bind poly(A) and poly(G) RNA (42Gallie D.R. Tanguay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17166-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that, like the animal and yeast orthologs, plant eIF4B is an RNA-binding protein. Based on the observations with animal and yeast eIF4B, plant eIF4B has been proposed to contain an N-terminal RRM (43Metz A.M. Wong K.C. Malmstrom S.A. Browning K.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) although this has not been experimentally verified. Only limited conservation is observed between eIF4B from wheat and other species: wheat eIF4B shares 29 and 24% identity with human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae eIF4B, respectively (43Metz A.M. Wong K.C. Malmstrom S.A. Browning K.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), making this factor one of the least conserved of the translation factors. The lack of sequence conservation, the apparent lack of interaction between eIF4B and PABP in yeast, and the difference in the degree to which eIF4B is essential for the ATPase and RNA helicase activities of eIF4A between plants and animals raised the question of the extent to which the domain organization of eIF4B was conserved among eukaryotes. To increase the understanding of the role of eIF4B during translation initiation and investigate the extent to which the functional interactions of eIF4B have been maintained despite the poor conservation of its primary sequence, the domain organization of wheat eIF4B was examined. We observed that whereas plant eIF4B is similar to animal eIF4B in that it contains RNA binding domains, plant eIF4B contains one additional RNA binding domain not reported for other eukaryotic homologs. Each RNA binding domain in wheat eIF4B requires dimerization for RNA binding activity and each exhibits a preference for purine-rich sequence. A functional interaction of eIF4B with eIFiso4G and eIF4A was shown for the first time to involve a physical interaction with conserved sequence elements adjacent to the RNA binding domains. The eIFiso4G binding domain lies immediately C-proximal to the N-proximal RNA binding domain. Two binding sites for PABP and eIF4A were mapped to conserved domains on either side of the C-terminal RNA binding domain that represents two 41-amino acid repeats conserved among plant eIF4B proteins, and to a lesser degree, in human eIF4B. These results support the notion that eIF4B functions by organizing multiple components of the translation initiation machinery and RNA. Plasmid Construction and Protein Expression—pET3d-eIFiso4G, pET3d-eIF4B, and pET23d-eIF4A were generous gifts from Karen Browning (University of Texas, Austin, TX). pT7-A50 has been described previously (44Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Following PCR amplification of the appropriate region of the eIF4B coding region, the fragments were introduced into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGEX-2TK or into the NdeI or NdeI and XhoI sites of pET19b (Novagen) and the eIF4B polypeptides expressed as GST or His10-tagged fusions, respectively. For construction of eIF4B-(55–74) and eIF4B-(55–74(K→ A)), sense and antisense oligonucleotides representing the entire wild-type or mutant sequences were annealed and ligated to pGEX-2TK digested with BamHI/EcoRI. pET19b-PABP-(1–651) and pET19b-PABP-(1–393) were made by PCR amplification of the appropriate region and introduced into the BamHI and NdeI/BamHI sites, respectively, of pET19b. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Protein expression was performed in Escherichia coli BL21 following induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Pelleted cells were sonicated in Buffer B-100 (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) and following centrifugation to remove cell debris, crude cell extracts used for analysis or the His10-tagged or GST-tagged fusion proteins were purified first using TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech) or glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. RNA Binding Analysis—Poly(A)-Sepharose 4B and poly(C)-, poly(G)-, or poly(U)-agarose (Sigma) were washed three times with Buffer B-100 (supplied with 5 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100). eIF4B proteins were incubated with the resin at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was washed four times with Buffer B-100 (with 5 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100), re-suspended in SDS sample buffer, and heated. The supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the gel stained with Coomassie or used for Western analysis. To determine the affinity of eIF4B for poly(A), poly(U), poly(C) or poly(G) RNA, binding was performed in Buffer B with either 100 or 150 mm KCl. To test if eIF4B can bind two molecules of RNA simultaneously, purified His-tagged eIF4B was incubated first with poly(A) beads. Radiolabeled poly(A)50 was then added and incubated for 2 h. The poly(A) resin was washed four times with Buffer B-40 (containing 40 mm KCl), re-suspended in SDS sample buffer, and the bound protein and poly(A)50 RNA resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Following electrophoresis, the gel was stained, de-stained, dried, and binding of radiolabeled poly(A) RNA detected by autoradiography. Radiolabeled (A)50 RNA was made as previously described (44Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—GST fusion protein was added to glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) washed three times with pre-cooled Buffer B-100 (supplied with 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100). Following incubation with shaking at 4 °C for 1 h, the resin was collected by centrifugation and the supernatant removed. Prey protein was added to the resin and incubated for 2 h. The resin was washed four times with Tween phosphate-buffered saline (TPBS: 0.1% Tween 20, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4) with 1 mm DTT. Bound protein was released following the addition of SDS sample buffer to the resin and boiling. Following centrifugation, the protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and the gel stained or used for Western analysis. For experiments testing for RNA tethering, micrococcal nuclease was added to the pulldown assay. The nuclease was added to the resin containing the bait protein and incubated in Buffer B-100 (without EDTA) at 30 °C for 1 h. The prey protein was then added and the reaction incubated at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. Identical conditions were used for control reactions in which only the nuclease was lacking. Western Analysis—Protein was transferred to 0.22-mm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting. The membranes were blocked in 5% milk, 1% NaN3 in TPBS followed by incubation with antiserum in TPBS with 1% milk for 1.5 h. Membranes were washed twice with TPBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) diluted from 1:5,000 to 1:10,000 for 1 h. The blots were washed twice with TPBS and the signal detected typically between 1 and 15 min using chemiluminescence (Pierce). His tag antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as recommended. eIFiso4F and eIF4A antisera (a generous gift of K. Browning) were used at 1:2000 dilution. eIF4B antiserum was used at 1:1000 dilution. eIF4B Contains Novel N-terminal and C-terminal RNA Binding Domains—In previous work, wheat eIF4B was shown to bind poly(A) or poly(G) RNA specifically (42Gallie D.R. Tanguay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17166-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the protein contained at least one RNA binding domain that exhibited a preference for the purine-rich sequence. To identify the number, type, and organization of the eIF4B RNA binding domains and determine their RNA binding requirements, the cDNA encoding eIF4B was introduced into pGEX-2TK and the full-length GST-eIF4B fusion protein (i.e. GST-eIF4B-(1–527)) expressed in E. coli (Fig. 1, lane 1, top panel). GST-eIF4B-(1–527)-containing crude extract was incubated with poly(A)-Sepharose 4B resin, the resin was washed extensively, and bound protein analyzed by SDS-PAGE. GST-eIF4B-(1–527) bound to poly(A) RNA, whereas GST alone did not (Fig. 1, compare lane 1 to lane 9, bottom panel), in good agreement with our earlier observations using native wheat eIF4B (42Gallie D.R. Tanguay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17166-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIF4B truncated polypeptides, in which the N-terminal 44 and 68 residues were deleted (i.e. GST-eIF4B-(45–527) and GST-eIF4B-(69–527), respectively), were also able to bind poly(A)-Sepharose resin efficiently (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3, bottom panel). Deletion of the N-terminal 279 and 319 residues (i.e. GST-eIF4B-(280–527) and GST-eIF4B-(320–527), respectively) reduced but did not eliminate RNA binding affinity (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5, bottom panel). However, deletion of an additional 20 residues (i.e. GST-eIF4B-(340–527)) abolished RNA binding (Fig. 1, lane 6, bottom panel), which was also observed for larger N-terminal deletions (e.g. GST-eIF4B-(358–527) and GST-eIF4B-(390–527)) (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8, bottom panel), suggesting that sequences involved in RNA binding were confined to approximately the region between residues 45 and 340. To delineate further the sequences involved in RNA binding, C-terminal deletions within GST-eIF4B-(45–527) were tested. Truncation to residue 390 (i.e. GST-eIF4B-(45–390)) did not affect RNA binding (Fig. 2A, lane 2, bottom panel) as did truncation to residues 360, 324, or 280 (i.e. GST-eIF4B-(45–360), GST-eIF4B-(45–324), or GST-eIF4B-(45–280), respectively) (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–5, bottom panel). Truncation to residue 76 (i.e. GST-eIF4B-(45–76)) also did not abolish RNA binding (Fig. 2A, lane 8, bottom panel) and residues 55 to 74 (i.e. GST-eIF4B-(55–74)) also exhibited RNA binding activity (Fig. 2A, lane 7, bottom panel), suggesting that an RNA binding domain was present within this 20-amino acid region. As this region contains five lysine residues between amino acids 56 and 61 (Fig. 3A) that may interact with the negative charge of the phosphates in RNA, the four lysines residues between amino acids 58 and 61 within GST-eIF4B-(55–74) were mutated to alanine residues. The resulting polypeptide (i.e. GST-eIF4B-(55–74(K→ A)) exhibited no RNA binding activity (Fig. 2A, lane 6, bottom panel), demonstrating a requirement for the lysine residues in RNA binding. A lysine-rich sequence is also present in the corresponding location of Arabidopsis eIF4B1 and eIF4B2 and in a more N-proximal position in human and yeast eIF4B (Fig. 3A). In addition, an adjacent C-proximal sequence is conserved in plant and animal eIF4B and to a lesser degree in the yeast homolog (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Comparison of RNA and protein binding domains of wheat eIF4B (Ta eIF4B) with similar sequence of Arabidopsis eIF4B (At eIF4B1 and At eIF4B2), human eIF4B (Hs eIF4B), and S. cerevisiae eIF4B (Sc eIF4B).

In particular, a ubiquitin ligase, Cbl, plays a central role in this event. Several candidates that have potential effects on the negative control of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor have now been identified by our recent studies in phospho-proteomics. Among these molecules, we focus on characterizing a novel protein, Ymer, which is a tyrosine-phosphorylated and ubiquitinated protein. Ymer is found to be phosphorylated at tyrosine 145 and 146 upon EGF stimulation, and lysine 129 of Ymer has been identified as a ubiquitination site. Ymer has two motifs interacting with the ubiquitin (MIU) domains that might function as a binding site for the ubiquitinated EGF receptor. Although Ymer and EGF receptors are associated in an EGF-dependent manner, their interaction is required not only for MIU domains but also for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Ymer. Phosphorylated Ymer is mainly located at the plasma membrane with EGF receptor and functions in its endocytosis and degradation. Furthermore, EGF-mediated secondary modifications of an activated-EGF receptor are inhibited by overexpressing Ymer in COS7 cells. Therefore, Ymer may have competitive effects on the activation of the EGF receptor. Our findings suggest that Ymer functions as a novel inhibitor for the down-regulation of the EGF receptor and plays a crucial role for regulating the amount of the EGF receptor on the cell surface membrane.

Lane H.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (2697) Google Scholar), many research groups have applied a proteomic technique using mass spectrometry (MS) to identify novel molecules and posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination involved in this EGF signaling pathway (2de Hoog C.L. Mann M. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2004; 5: 267-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Recently, numerous proteins, including both well known and previously unknown proteins in growth factor receptor-mediated signaling pathways, have been identified by proteomic studies carried out by several research groups including ours 3H. Konishi, K. Tashiro, Y. Murata, H. Nabeshi, E. Yamauchi, and H. Taniguchi, submitted for publication. (3Thelemann A. Petti F. Griffin G. Iwata K. Hunt T. Settinari T. Fenyo D. Gibson N. Haley J.D.

Science. 2005; 308: 1472-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). To obtain a complete picture of EGF receptor-mediated signaling pathways by using variable experimental resources derived from proteomics, each identified molecule must be validated and characterized to ensure that it is involved in this pathway; this is an important step in the post-proteomics stage. In the EGF receptor-mediated signaling pathway, receptor autophosphorylation after ligand binding is the first of the various intracellular events induced by EGF stimulation. After this step, protein-protein interactions of the assembled molecules with the activated receptor complex occurs for transducing the signal to several downstream kinase cascades (8Jones R.B. Gordus A. Krall J.A. MacBeath G. Nature. 2006; 439: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In general, these processes resulting from EGF receptor activation are likely to positively regulate this signaling pathway. On the other hand, ligand-mediated ubiquitination of the EGF receptor plays a role in its internalization to the endosomal pathway, which determines the fate of the intracellular EGF receptor; that is, its recycling or degradation (9Schmidt M.H. Dikic I. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 907-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 10Dikic I. Giordano S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Therefore, this modification is considered to be a negative regulator of the EGF receptor. Based on the results of phospho-proteomics that explores the downstream molecules of the EGF receptor, it is suggested that many proteins related to its internalization are involved in the interactome of Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a central role in the growth factor receptor down-regulation (9Schmidt M.H. Dikic I. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 907-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, a newly identified molecule from the proteomics study that does not have any functional domain needs to have its functions in the EGF receptor-mediated signaling pathway deciphered using appropriate biochemical and cell biological experiments. Ymer, which was originally named by Blagoev et al. (6Blagoev B. Ong S.E. Kratchmarova I. Mann M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), has been identified as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, and one of its phosphorylation sites (tyrosine 145) has also been detected (4Zhang Y.

Although Ymer has been hypothesized to function in the EGF signaling pathway, there is no biological evidence to this effect. Moreover, a recent report has described that one of the newly identified ubiquitin binding motifs, MIU (motif interacting with ubiquitin) is contained within Ymer (11Penengo L. Mapelli M. Murachelli A.G. Confalonieri S. Magri L. Musacchio A. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Schneider T.R. Cell. 2006; 124: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), which indicates that Ymer may be ubiquitinated and may function in the negative control of receptor signaling. In this study, we focus on Ymer that has been identified by our original phospho-proteomic experiments using EGF-stimulated A431 cells,3 and we demonstrate that the functional analysis in the EGF receptor down-regulation events is dependent upon the multiposttranslational modifications of Ymer. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Reagents—COS7, HeLa, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T, and A431 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Transfection of a plasmid into COS7, HeLa, or HEK293T cells was carried out by electroporation using Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Before EGF stimulation, cells cultured for 48 h after transfection were serum-starved for 16 h, and 50 ng/ml EGF (Sigma) or 100 ng/ml Alexa-fluora 488-conjugated EGF (Molecular Probe) dissolved in serum-free medium was added. MG132 was purchased from Sigma. cDNA Cloning and Vector Constructions—For cloning of the long and short forms of the Ymer cDNA, the A431 cDNA library were screened by PCR with two primers (EcoRI, 5′-ATGGCTGAAGTCAGCATCGAC-3′, and BamHI, 3′, 5′-TTAATGTTTGTAATGAAA-3′) that were designed based on the sequence (gi 40675504) in the NCBI data base. The amplified products were first subcloned into a TOPO™ TA cloning vector, pCR®2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), and then sequenced. The nucleotide sequences were determined using an ABI prism dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an ABI Prism 3100-Avant genetic analyzer. Ymer cDNAs were subcloned into a pCMV-FLAG6a (Sigma) expression vector in-frame and expressed as FLAG-tagged protein with the tag at the N terminus. The human HA-tagged ubiquitin construct was provided by Dr. S. Hatakeyama (Hokkaido University, Japan). The DNA fragments of Ymer used for the construction of deletion mutants were prepared by using PCR or suitable restriction enzyme digests. After examining their DNA sequences, the constructs were subcloned into a pCMV-FLAG6 series vector to express N-terminal FLAG-tagged proteins. Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The human EGF receptor, the FLAG-tagged CFBP (CIN85/CD2AP family-binding protein) construct, was prepared as described elsewhere.3 The human HA-tagged c-Cbl construct was provided by Dr. J. E. van Leeuwen (University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Antibodies—Two polyclonal anti-Ymer antibodies were used in this study. Anti-Ymer(His) antibody and anti-Ymer(pep) were raised against a Ymer fragment containing residues 77-183 and 166-270, which were bacterially produced as His-tagged protein using pET vector (Novagen) and as glutathione S-transferase fusion protein using pGEX4T vector, respectively. These antibodies were purified using HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with each immunizing antigen. Phosphorylation site-specific antisera was raised against the phosphopeptides having an additional cysteine residue at the N-terminal end of the Ymer amino acid sequence, namely, CAYADSYpYYEDGGM (amino acids 139-151; pY indicates phosphotyrosine). The phosphopeptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize rabbits. The phosphorylation site-specific antibodies were purified from antisera by successive column chromatography with the use of affinity resins coupled with each phosphopeptide and nonphospho-peptide. The Ymer antibodies used in this study were tested for their specificities for use in immunoprecipitation (anti-Ymer(pep)), immunoblotting (anti-Ymer(His) and (pep)), and immunofluorescence studies (anti-Ymer(pep)). Other antibodies that were obtained commercially from various suppliers included anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10; Upstate Biotech Inc.), anti-EGF receptor antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-03), anti-HA antibody (12CA5; Roche Applied Science), and anti-ubiquitin (P4D1, Santa Cruz). Semiquantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—To assess the relative expression levels of Ymer transcripts, a reverse transcriptase-PCR assay was performed on each panel of eight different human culture cell lines and tissue cDNAs (human tissue and cell line MTC panel, Clontech) using the primers 5′-AAAAGACCTTGAACAACAA-3′ and 5′-TTATTCTTCAGCCATTAGAAG-3′. The normalized cDNA was amplified under the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min; 30 or 50 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels. Small Interference RNA (siRNA)—The mammalian expression vector pSUPER-Retro-puro (Oligoengine) was used for expression of siRNA in HeLa cells. The targeted sequence of human Ymer was 5′-AAGATGGAGGAATGAAGCCAA-3′ (nucleotides 440-460), and a resulting plasmid for the knockdown of Ymer was named pSuper-Ymer. The empty pSuper vector was used as a control. HeLa cells were stably infected with an amphotropic receptor. The packaging cells, AmphoPack™-293 cell line (Clontech), were transfected with the appropriate retroviral RNA-mediated interference construct by electroporation. Culture supernatants were collected after 48 h post-transfection and centrifuged. HeLa cells were infected with the viral supernatants in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) for 12 h, after which the medium was replaced with fresh medium. After infection, cells were selected using 2 μg/ml puromycin. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—The following procedures were carried out at 0-4 °C. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and complete protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was used as a whole cell lysate. For immunoprecipitation experiments, the whole cell lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated for 2 h with an appropriate antibody. Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added. Then the resulting mixture was rotated at 4 °C for an additional hour. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer. The samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore). Immunoblot analysis was carried out using primary antibodies as described in the figure legends. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of FLAG-Ymer and Its Binding Protein—293T cells (1 × 108 cells) transiently expressing FLAG-tagged Ymer were lysed with lysis buffer. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated with FLAG affinity gel (50-μl bed volume) (Sigma) for 2 h. The gel was applied to an empty mini column (Bio-Rad) and washed with lysis buffer several times. FLAG-Ymer was eluted with 45 μl of 100 mm glycine-HCl (pH 3.0). The eluate was neutralized with 5 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. All bands that were visible after Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining were subjected to MS/MS analysis after in-gel digestion with trypsin. In-gel Digestion with Trypsin—Each gel slice was cut into small pieces and put into a new tube. The gel pieces were destained by rinsing in 50% acetonitrile containing 25 mm NH4HCO3. Disulfide bonds were reduced by incubating with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 25 mm NH4HCO3 at 56 °C for 1 h and alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 25 mm NH4HCO3 at room temperature for 45 min in the dark. Gel pieces were washed with 50% acetonitrile and dried in a vacuum concentrator (Speed-Vac, Thermo Savant). Gel pieces were rehydrated with 15 μl of trypsin solution (10 ng/μl trypsin in 50 mm NH4HCO3 containing 5 mm CaCl2). In-gel digestion was performed overnight at 37 °C. The resulting peptides were extracted with 50% acetonitrile containing 5% trifluoroacetic acid. Extracts were dried in the vacuum concentrator and redissolved in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The peptide mixtures obtained were subjected to LC/MS and data-dependent LC/MS/MS analyses. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—LC/MS/MS analysis was carried out in a quadrupole-time-of-flight-type hybrid mass spectrometer (Micromass, UK) interfaced on-line with a capillary high performance liquid chromatography (Waters-Micromass modular CapLC, Micromass, UK) (12Konishi H. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. Yamamoto T. Matsuzaki H. Takemura Y. Ohmae K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The linear gradient of acetonitrile produced was split at a 1:10 ratio, and a slow flow of ∼100 nl/min was injected into a nano-LC column (PepMap C18, 75 μm × 150 mm, LC Packings). The column eluate was directly injected into a self-constructed nanospray ion source with a tapered stainless capillary. The LC/MS/MS analysis was carried out in a data-dependent mode; peptide peaks above a certain threshold were subjected automatically to the collision-induced dissociation. Peak lists obtained from the MS/MS spectra were used to identify proteins using the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, UK). Fluorescence Microscopic Analysis—COS7, HeLa, and A431 cells with or without transfection were fixed with 5% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in PBS for 10 min, and washed with PBS again. After a blocking step with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, the primary antibodies, as described in the figures, were applied for 1 h. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa fluorescent dyes (Molecular Probes) for 45 min. If required, the cells were treated with rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes). The cell nuclei were stained with 2 μm Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). Finally, cells were rinsed 3 times with PBS and mounted onto microscope slides with ProLong Antifade reagents (Molecular Probes). The images taken were those observed under a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope with a 40 × 1.0 numerical aperture PlanApo objective (Zeiss Axioskop, Carl Zeiss Inc.). Figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop. Ymer Is a Tyrosine-phosphorylated Protein upon EGF Stimulation—Ymer has been identified as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein through the phospho-proteomic studies performed by three independent research groups (4Zhang Y.

Kratchmarova I. Mann M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In addition, by using a similar strategy, we have also independently identified more than 150 proteins containing Ymer from the lysate of EGF-stimulated A431 cells.3 However, the function of Ymer in the EGF signaling pathway is yet to be elucidated. Although the study on the cDNA cloning of Ymer has revealed that two splice variants of Ymer transcriptants are expressed ubiquitously in mammalian tissues and that the short variant is dominantly expressed (14Vazza G. Picelli S. Bozzato A. Mostacciuolo M.L. Gene. 2003; 314: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), little evidence for expression of this protein has been shown in cultured cells. Therefore, biochemical analysis on Ymer was carried out. It has been reported that the long form of Ymer (Ymer-L) is transcribed as a 1449-bp mRNA comprising a total of 12 exons, which corresponds to a 482-amino acid polypeptide. A splice variant lacking exon 6 encodes the short form of Ymer, which corresponds to a 306-amino acid polypeptide (Fig. 1D). We have produced a specific antibody against Ymer, which recognizes the recombinant Ymer proteins with considerable accuracy (Fig. 1A, lane 2 and 3). By using this antibody, endogenous Ymer was also detected in the cell lysates from COS7 (Fig. 1A, lane 1). This band was not detected using preimmune serum or by incubating with immunizing antigen (data not shown). Furthermore, the immunoprecipitants with phosphotyrosine antibody from EGF-stimulated A431 cells included Ymer (Fig. 1B, right), and immunoprecipitated endogenous Ymer from EGF-stimulated cells was tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 1C). Therefore, Ymer might be tyrosine-phosphorylated in an EGF-dependent manner. The size of this Ymer was apparently similar to the expected size of the short form, and the band of Ymer-L was very faint in the whole cell lysate (WCL; Fig. 1A). Therefore, Ymer-S is expressed dominantly in the examined cells, and similar results were obtained using the lysates of HEK293, A431, and HeLa cells (data not shown). Next, the transcriptional levels of Ymer isoforms in various cultured cells were analyzed by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. The results of the biochemical analysis revealed that in contrast to the small amounts of Ymer-L that were expressed in the limited cells tested, Ymer-S was expressed dominantly in all examined cells with the exception of a breast cancer cell line, MCF-7 (Fig. 1E). The Ymer protein was not detected in the lysate from these cells (data not shown). Tyrosine 145 and 146 of Ymer Are Phosphorylated upon EGF Stimulation—Two research groups have described that tyrosine 145 of Ymer is phosphorylated by growth factor stimulation (4Zhang Y.

Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), and we have obtained similar results from a deletion study (data not shown). To confirm the phosphorylation of Tyr-145 of Ymer, point mutants replacing the tyrosines around this phosphorylation site with phenylalanine were constructed. Unexpectedly, the Y145F mutant of Ymer continued to be phosphorylated upon EGF stimulation, and a double mutant replacing both Tyr-145 and 146 with Phe abolished the EGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Therefore, in addition to Tyr-145, 146 of Ymer is also phosphorylated upon EGF stimulation. For further analysis on the physiological function of Ymer, we have developed a Tyr-145 phosphorylation-specific antibody. This antibody recognizes the phosphorylation of both Ymer isoforms with considerable accuracy (Fig. 2, B and C), and we demonstrated this in our study on the subcellular localization of phosphorylated Ymer using this antibody as described below. Ymer Is a Ubiquitinated Protein—To gain insights into the function of Ymer, we analyzed proteins coprecipitated with Ymer by immunoaffinity purification. HEK293T cells transfected with the expression plasmid for FLAG-tagged Ymer-S were lysed with the buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and immunoprecipitation was carried out using an anti-FLAG-affinity gel. Proteins eluted with glycine buffer were analyzed with SDS-PAGE. In addition to Ymer, a protein ∼45 kDa was detected only in the immune complex from the transfected cells (Fig. 3A). These bands were cut out from the gel and in-gel-digested with trypsin. The resulting extracted peptides were analyzed to identify their amino acid sequences using tandem MS. Interestingly, this band was Ymer itself, and several peptides derived from ubiquitin were also detected (data not shown). We carefully analyzed the MS/MS profile of the Ymer peptide containing the ubiquitin sequence; lysine 129 was identified as a ubiquitination site of Ymer (Fig. 3B). To confirm the data from MS/MS, an immunoprecipitation study was performed with co-expression of HA-tagged ubiquitin. We found that Ymer-S was ubiquitinated in COS7 cells, and the amount of the high molecular weight band increased after EGF treatment (Fig. 3C). This result suggests that Ymer might be polyubiquitinated in EGF-stimulated cells. On the other hand, several bands conjugated with HA-tagged ubiquitin might be mono- or multiubiquitinated Ymer, and the intensity of these bands also increased slightly upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 3C). In contrast to Ymer-S, which was strongly ubiquitinated in the cells, only a band of likely monoubiquitinated Ymer-L was detected (Fig. 3C). Although the mutant Ymer replacing Lys-129 with arginine was also strongly mono- or multiubiquitinated, the polyubiquitinated Ymer levels did not increase upon EGF stimulation in COS7 cells (Fig. 3D). Because there are many Lys residues that could be putative ubiquitinated sites in the Ymer molecule, further studies must be carried out to identify the total ubiquitination sites. On the other hand, our previously identified protein, CFBP, which could play a role as the positive effector in the down-regulation of EGF receptor,3 was not ubiquitinated (Fig. 3D). Next, we focused on the MIU region, which has been most recently identified as a new ubiquitin-binding site (11Penengo L. Mapelli M. Murachelli A.G. Confalonieri S. Magri L. Musacchio A. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Schneider T.R. Cell. 2006; 124: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 15Mattera R. Tsai Y. Weissman A.M. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol.

Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although the precise position of the monoubiquitination site of Ymer has not yet been identified, the double mutant of alanine 179 and 206 that plays crucial roles for the structures of two MIU domains replaced with glycine diminished the amounts of monoubiquitinated Ymer (Fig. 3E). Therefore, two MIU domains in Ymer play a role in its ubiquitination. However, the ubiquitination of exogenous Ymer normally occurred without EGF treatment in COS7 cells, and it was enhanced by pretreatment with a proteasomal inhibitor, MG132 (Fig. 3F). This result suggests that ligand-induced polyubiquitination and degradation of Ymer may be dependent on the proteasomal pathway. Ymer Binds to the EGF Receptor in an EGF Stimulation-dependent Manner—From our results, we found that multi-posttranslational modifications occurred in the Ymer molecule in an EGF-dependent manner. According to the results of quantitative phosphorylation proteomics, the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Ymer was ∼2.5-fold higher than its phosphorylation upon platelet-derived growth factor stimulation (7Kratchmarova I. Blagoev B. Haack-Sorensen M. Kassem M. Mann M. Science. 2005; 308: 1472-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ymer might be a suitable substrate for the EGF receptor. Likewise, the substrate of the EGF receptor, Eps15, is well known as a ubiquitinated and EGF receptor-binding protein, which functions in the process of EGF receptor down-regulation. Hence, we focused on the physical relationship between Ymer and the EGF receptor. Endogenous Ymer was found to be co-immunoprecipitated with the EGF receptor in the lysate from EGF-stimulated A431 cells (Fig. 4A). Next, we proceeded to identify the EGF receptor binding site in Ymer by using recombinant proteins in COS7 cells. Although it was impossible to detect endogenous EGF receptors bound to FLAG-Ymer-S, the complex of both proteins appeared due to the overexpression of EGF receptor in COS7 cells. Furthermore, the Ymer-S region of amino acids from 78 to 216 was found to be a binding site for the EGF receptor, which contained its ubiquitination and tyrosine phosphorylation sites and two MIU regions (Fig. 4, B and C). Therefore, we tested the effects of posttranslational modifications in Ymer on the interaction between Ymer and the EGF receptor. Because the Y145F/Y146F mutant of Ymer did not bind to the EGF receptor, the phosphorylation of these sites might be necessary for their binding. On the other hand, Ymer-L also had a low affinity for binding to the EGF receptor (Fig. 4D). This result suggests that the internal sequence between posttranslational modification sites and MIU regions, which are encoded by exon 6, may have negative effects on the binding to the EGF receptor. Next, we focused on the MIU region that has been most recently identified as a new ubiquitin-binding site. Because the mutant replacing Ala-179 with Gly diminished the binding activity to the EGF receptor as compared with the wild type and another mutant, the N-terminal MIU domain might be necessary for binding to the EGF receptor (Fig. 4E). To clarify the meaning of the interaction between EGF receptor and Ymer, we focused on the effect of Ym"
https://openalex.org/W2068471730,"BRCA1 is a well described breast cancer susceptibility gene thought to be involved primarily in DNA repair. However, mutation within the BRCA1 transcriptional domain is also implicated in neoplastic transformation of mammary epithelium, but responsible mechanisms are unclear. Here we show in a rat mammary model system that wild type (WT) BRCA1 specifically represses the expression of osteopontin (OPN), a multifunctional estrogen-responsive gene implicated in oncogenic transformation, particularly that of the breast. WT.BRCA1 selectively binds OPN-activating transcription factors estrogen receptor alpha, AP-1, and PEA3, inhibits OPN promoter transactivation, and suppresses OPN mRNA and protein both from an endogenous gene and a relevant model inducible gene. WT.BRCA1 also inhibits OPN-mediated neoplastic transformation characterized by morphology change, anchorage-independent growth, adhesion to fibronectin, and invasion through Matrigel. A mutant BRCA1 allele (Mut.BRCA1) associated with familial breast cancer lacks OPN suppressor effects, binds to WT.BRCA1, and impedes WT.BRCA1 suppression of OPN. Stable transfection of rat breast tumor cell lines with Mut.BRCA1 dramatically up-regulates OPN protein and induces anchorage independent growth. In human primary breast cancer, BRCA1 mutation is significantly associated with OPN overexpression. Taken together, these data suggest that BRCA1 mutation may confer increased tissue-specific cancer risk, in part by disruption of BRCA1 suppression of OPN gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2097305047,"Halorespiration is a bacterial respiratory process in which haloorganic compounds act as terminal electron acceptors. This process is controlled at transcriptional level by CprK, a member of the ubiquitous CRP-FNR family. Here we present the crystal structures of oxidized CprK in presence of the ligand ortho-chlorophenolacetic acid and of reduced CprK in absence of this ligand. These structures reveal that highly specific binding of chlorinated, rather than the corresponding non-chlorinated, phenolic compounds in the NH(2)-terminal beta-barrels causes reorientation of these domains with respect to the central alpha-helix at the dimer interface. Unexpectedly, the COOH-terminal DNA-binding domains dimerize in the non-DNA binding state. We postulate the ligand-induced conformational change allows formation of interdomain contacts that disrupt the DNA domain dimer interface and leads to repositioning of the helix-turn-helix motifs. These structures provide a structural framework for further studies on transcriptional control by CRP-FNR homologs in general and of halorespiration regulation by CprK in particular."

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The xanthophylls consist of two molecules of lutein (Lu), one neoxanthin (Nx), and one violaxanthin (Vx), bound to the sites L1/L2, N1, and V1, respectively. L1 and L2 are located close to the center of the complex, stabilizing a superhelix of protein helices I and III, whereas N1 and V1 are located more peripherally.The specificity of xanthophyll binding sites has been addressed both by analyzing xanthophyll biosynthetic mutants (see below) and by employing recombinant in vitro systems. In the latter approach, complexes were formed by having different carotenoids compete for the various binding sites. Lu and Nx were found to bind to the L1/L2 and N1 sites, respectively, with high specificity (3Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 4Hobe S. Niemeier H. Bender A. Paulsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As long as Lu is provided for binding to L1/L2, the N1 site does not bind any of the all-trans carotenoids Lu or Vx. Zx was shown to be a strong competitor for Lu, whereas Vx competes to a lesser extent. Consistently, when Lu is omitted completely from the refolding experiment, both Zx and Vx support complex formation by binding to L1/L2, although this increasingly compromises the complex stability. Moreover, Zx and Vx in L1/L2 compromise the binding specificity of N1, prompting its partial occupation with Vx. Xanthophyll biosynthetic mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana revealed a flexible response of the aggregational state of LHCIIb as well as of pigmentation of particular binding sites: double mutants lacking epoxycarotenoids as well as Lu exhibit a complete loss of trimeric LHCIIb with resulting monomeric complexes carrying only the remaining xanthophyll Zx (5Lokstein H.

B: Bio. 1996; 34: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The loss of trimer formation and binding flexibility toward “non-native” carotenoids also holds true for single mutants where both the absence of Lu in mutant lut2, which is then replaced by Vx and/or Zx, and the absence of Nx in aba1 strongly decreases the trimer stability of LHCIIb (5Lokstein H.

In the case of L1/L2 a hydroxyl group at C3 on the β-end group turned out to be important (8Phillip D. Hobe S. Paulsen H. Molnar P. Hashimoto H. Young A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25160-25169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast to Lu and Vx, which both exhibit an all-trans configuration of the extended polyene chain, Nx in photosynthetic tissue of chlorophyll b-containing organisms is present in its 9′-cis conformation (9Takaichi S. Mimuro M. Plant Cell Phys. 1998; 39: 968-977Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, pigment analysis of LHCIIb from the parasitic plant Cuscuta reflexa identified 9′-cis-Vx as the carotenoid in N1 (10Snyder A.M. Clark B.M. Robert B. Ruban A.V. Bungard R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5162-5168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting that this binding site requires a 9-cis-5,6-epoxy-3-hydroxy carotenoid. This suggestion was confirmed by the x-ray structure of LHCIIb resolved at 2.72 Å (1Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar), which identified a tyrosine residue located in the luminal loop as the hydrogen bond partner for the ionone ring proximal to the 9′-cis conformation of Nx. Furthermore, numerous chlorophylls and amino acid side chains form a hydrophobic cleft that accommodates the bent polyene chain of Nx.Whereas both Lu and Nx are generally considered to be tightly bound to LHCIIb, the binding strength of Vx is much weaker. Solubilization of thylakoids usually causes the loss of Vx from LHCIIb unless special care is taken (11Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography localized the Vx binding site at the interface between two monomers in trimeric LHCIIb (1Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W.

One of these is the protection against photodamage by quenching either the triplet-excited state of chlorophyll or the singlet state of oxygen.

Another function of carotenoids is the dissipation of excess excitation energy in the light-harvesting apparatus involving zeaxanthin, generated by de-epoxidation of Vx in the xanthophyll cycle (12Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Phys. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar, 13Niyogi K.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Phys. Plant Mol.

During this cycle, Vx presumably is extracted from its binding site in light-harvesting complexes to interact with the water-soluble de-epoxidase, which then reinserts its product back into the protein complex (19Jahns P. Wehner A. Paulsen H. Hobe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22154-22159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This dynamic binding behavior may explain why Vx easily dissociates from LHCIIb. The dynamics of carotenoid binding to LHCIIb is an issue to be considered when the biogenesis of this complex is to be understood. It is unclear how and in which sequence the carotenoids are assembled into the light-harvesting complexes. In an early stage of greening, before the massive accumulation of trimeric LHCIIb sets in, the monomeric complex is transiently found (20Dreyfuss B.W. Thornber J.P. Plant Phys. 1994; 106: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, no earlier assembly intermediate, containing only a subset of LHCIIb pigments, has ever been observed in greening plants. Of course this does not exclude the existence of such intermediates, because the biogenesis of LHCIIb is not well synchronized in greening tissue, and, therefore, such intermediates may appear only in low amounts at any given time point. Time-resolved fluorescence and CD measurements (21Booth P.J. Paulsen H. Biochem. 1996; 35: 5103-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Horn R. Paulsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44400-44406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) showed that the presence of Lu accelerates complex assembly and protein folding, more so than the presence of any other carotenoids, indicating that the correct occupation of the central xanthophyll binding sites L1 and L2 with Lu possibly precedes the binding of (some) other pigments (23Reinsberg D. Ottmann K. Booth P.J. Paulsen H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In fact, LHCIIb containing Lu as the only carotenoid component is stable (4Hobe S. Niemeier H. Bender A. Paulsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Croce R. Remelli R. Varotto C. Breton J. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), at least in its monomeric form (5Lokstein H. Tian L. Polle J.E.W. DellaPenna D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta - Bioenergetics. 2002; 1553: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The present work addresses the question of whether Nx can bind to a potential intermediate of LHCIIb assembly consisting of the folded protein, Lu, and the chlorophylls. We show that in fact Nx binding to LHCIIb is reversible and, by using Nx-specific signals in the CD of LHCIIb, determine the binding constant and activation energy of its binding equilibrium.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPigment Preparation—9′-cis-Nx, all-trans-Vx, all-trans-Lu as well as chlorophylls a and b were prepared from pea leaves as described previously (21Booth P.J. Paulsen H. Biochem. 1996; 35: 5103-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). 9′-cis-Vx was extracted from papaya fruits (Carica sp., local market). The extraction of total pigments from papaya, the hydrolysis step in a KOH-ethanol solution, the extraction of carotenoids, and their fractionation by HPLC followed the procedure for carotenoids isolation from pea leaves (see above). 9′-cis-Vx was identified by the 40 nm hypsochromic shift in the absorption and increased hydrophobicity of its furanoid derivative produced by adding HCl (25Eugster C.H. Chemical derivatizations: Microscale tests for the presence of common functional groups in carotenoids.in: Britton G., L.-J.S. Pfender H. Carotenoids. Birkhäuser, Basel1995Google Scholar) and distinguished from the all-trans isomer by its slightly lower polarity and a 4–5 nm hypsochromic shift of absorbance (26Molnar P. Szabolcs J. Phytochem. 1980; 19: 623-627Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Preparation of Recombinant and Native LHCIIb—Native LHCIIb was isolated as described before (27Krupa Z. Huner N.P.A. Williams J.P. Maissan E. James D.R. Plant Physiol. 1987; 84: 19-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant LHCIIb was prepared from overexpressed apoprotein carrying a His tag at its C terminus (28Rogl H. Kosemund K. Kühlbrandt W. Collinson I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Monomeric samples were reconstituted by the detergent exchange method as described previously (29Paulsen H. Finkenzeller B. Kuhlein N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) but without sucrose in the solubilization buffer to facilitate the subsequent purification step on sucrose gradients (0.1–1 m sucrose, 0.1% β-DM, 5 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.8). Monomeric complexes were harvested with a syringe and kept on ice until use. Trimeric LHCIIb was prepared by detergent exchange reconstitution (29Paulsen H. Finkenzeller B. Kuhlein N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and affinity chromatography (30Yang C. Horn R. Paulsen H. Biochem. 2003; 42: 4527-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and purified on sucrose gradients as described for monomeric complexes.Carotenoid Insertion Reactions—Insertion reactions were carried out with complexes extracted from sucrose gradients, thus containing ∼0.2 m sucrose, 0.1% β-DM, 5 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.8. When unbound pigments were to be extracted upon the insertion reaction, sucrose was depleted from the complex solution. In this case, β-DM was added to give a total detergent concentration of 0.3%. The sample was then diluted 10-fold in 5 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.8, and concentrated again on 30-kDa Centricon devices to the original volume, thereby decreasing the sucrose concentration to ∼0.02 m. Concentration of LHCIIb was determined using a molar extinction coefficient at 670 nm of 5.46 × 105 (m–1 × cm–1) (31Butler P. Kühlbrandt W. Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3797-3801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Xanthophylls for insertion were first completely solubilized in ethanol (concentration of ∼1–2 μg/μl). This solution was diluted 1:10 with 0.1% β-DM, 5 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.8, sonified in a bath sonifier for 1 min, and filtrated through 0.2-μm sterile filters. Pigment concentration in the filtrate was determined by analytical HPLC after butanol extraction (32Martinson T.A. Plumley F.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Insertion was started by mixing LHCIIb and xanthophyll solutions. The xanthophyll solution never exceeded 5% of the final volume to facilitate the comparison of LHCIIb CD spectra taken before and after the insertion reaction by using a J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Gross-Umstadt, Germany). The temperature during the insertion reaction was controlled by a thermostatted water bath.Determination of Binding Constant K—According to the law of mass action the binding constant K is defined as in Equation 1.K=[NLL·LHCIIb][Nx]×[LL·LHCIIb](Eq. 1) The ratio of NLL·LHCIIb/LL·LHCIIb was determined via CD478/492 calibration (see Fig. 9), whereas the portion of unbound Nx in equilibrium [Nx] can be expressed as the difference between total Nx minus Nx concentration bound to LHCIIb. Because of the stoichiometry of 1 Nx per apoprotein this can be calculated as in Equation 2.[Nx]=[Nx(total)]-[NLL·LHCIIb](Eq. 2) Total Nx was quantified by HPLC, whereas [NLL·LHCIIb] can be calculated by taking into account the ratio of NLL·LHCIIb/LL·LHCIIb as determined via CD478/492 calibration and the total concentration of LHCIIb as determined by A670 with a molar extinction coefficient of 5.46 × 105 (m–1 × cm–1) (31Butler P. Kühlbrandt W. Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. U. S.

During the insertion reaction spectra were taken every 60 s. The temperature was controlled by an implemented Peltier-type thermostat. Amplitudes of negative peaks at 478 nm and 492 nm from every spectrum were extracted, and [NLL·LHCIIb] was determined as described above. Rate constants k were determined by using Equation 4 for a second order reaction,[P]=[A]0[B]0(1-e([B]0-[A]0)kt)[A]0-[B]0e([B]0-[A]0)kt(Eq. 4) with [P] = [NLL·LHCIIb]; [A]0 and [B]0 are the concentrations of Nx and LL·LHCIIb, respectively, at the beginning of the reaction, k is the rate constant, and t = time (seconds). An iterative fit procedure was performed by minimizing the sum of square deviations at all time points.RESULTSDissociation of Nx from LHCIIb Depends on Temperature and Protein Concentration—As a first approach to further understand the dynamics of xanthophyll binding to LHCIIb we tested whether Nx and Lu, like Vx, are reversibly bound, i.e. whether these pigments are able to dissociate from the otherwise intact complex. Native trimeric LHCIIb was first diluted in detergent buffer containing 0.1% β-DM. Afterward potentially dissociating pigments were separated from the remaining complexes by ultracentrifugation at different temperatures to overcome possible activation barriers of carotenoids dissociation. Fig. 1 depicts the relative pigment compositions of native LHCIIb as a result of both decreasing concentration and increasing temperature during isolation by sucrose density centrifugation. The complex concentrations given in Fig. 1 were measured before ultracentrifugation but are expressed as per gradient volume. The combination of nearly hundredfold dilution before centrifugation with a temperature increase up to 40 °C during preparative ultracentrifugation leads to a specific and complete loss of Nx but not Lu (Fig. 1). The dissociation of Nx from LHCIIb can both be observed with respect to Lu (Fig. 1A) and chlorophyll a plus b (Fig. 1B). Pigment compositions of the remaining complexes after Nx dissociation do not significantly change, as indicated by the fact that the graphs in Fig. 1 (A and B) follow the same profile.FIGURE 1A combination of temperature increase and dilution leads to specific loss of neoxanthin. Native trimeric LHCIIb was diluted with 0.1% β-DM and purified by sucrose density ultracentrifugation at the temperatures given below. Initial LHCIIb concentrations, determined by the absorbance at 670 nm, were measured before ultracentrifugation. Trimeric complexes were harvested, and their pigment contents analyzed by HPLC. A, Nx/Lu ratios; B, Nx/(Chla+b) ratios. Temperature during centrifugation (16 h) was as follows: squares, 4 °C; diamonds, 24 °C; triangles, 35 °C; and crosses, 40 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Nx Rebinds at a Defined Stoichiometry and Correct Orientation—If this specific loss of Nx is based on an equilibrium reaction we would expect the remaining LL·LHCIIb to rebind Nx either upon reconcentrating the sample or upon adding an excess of unbound Nx. Because samples solubilized in a detergent system are hard to concentrate without changing the concentration of detergent, we chose the second approach. However, because biochemical and spectroscopic analysis of emerging complexes demand higher concentrations than that available after extreme dilution, we chose recombinant LHCIIb refolded in the absence of Nx as the substrate for Nx binding. In the presence of chlorophylls a and b and of Lu as the sole carotenoid, both monomeric and trimeric LHCIIb could be isolated by sucrose density ultracentrifugation (Fig. 2). Although the yield of trimeric complexes decreases when Nx is omitted from the refolding mixture, the composition of chlorophylls and remaining Lu molecules within the resulting monomers and trimers remained largely unchanged (Table 1). These complexes were then incubated with Nx solubilized in detergent and subsequently re-isolated on sucrose gradients. HPLC analysis of pigment composition of emerging complexes shows that both monomeric and trimeric LL·LHCIIb take up Nx in a stoichiometric manner (Table 1). This becomes obvious from the upper limit of one molecule of Nx per apoprotein, even under conditions of 3- and 5-fold excess over LL·LHCIIb, indicating Nx binding to be quite specific.FIGURE 2Preparative ultracentrifugation of monomeric and trimeric LL·LHCIIb and NLL·LHCIIb.

The CD spectra taken from NLL·LHCIIb and LL·LHCIIb in their monomeric states reveal significant differences both in the blue (400–500 nm) and the red (650–700 nm) regions of complex absorption (Fig. 3). In the red region the absence of Nx decreases CD amplitudes at 650 nm and the positive signal at 668 nm, whereas the signal strength at 681 nm is increased. In the Soret region we observed a stronger negative CD signal at 478 nm, and additionally, the amplitude of the negative CD signal at 492 nm was decreased. These signals presumably contain contributions of Nx interacting with chlorophyll b as suggested by the wavelength region and the spatial vicinity of binding site N1 and several chlorophylls b close to helix C (1Liu Z.

Insertion of Nx transforms CD signals of LL·LHCIIb into those characteristic for NLL·LHCIIb as can be seen by comparing the spectra of NLL·LHCIIb and LL·LHCIIb with substoichiometric insertion of Nx into LL·LHCIIb (Fig. 4). Increasing ratios of Nx/LL·LHCIIb, offered successively, shift the Soret CD profile toward that of fully pigmented LHCIIb. This further corroborated the notion of a correct three-dimensional orientation of inserted Nx, as the CD characteristics become indistinguishable from native LHCIIb monomers (34Hobe S. Prytulla S. Kühlbrandt W. Paulsen H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3423-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3CD spectra of monomeric LHCIIb with or without Nx.

Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Consistently with this observation, fluorescence rises upon association of Nx to prefolded LL·LHCIIb as monitored by comparing excitation spectra (Fig. 5). Fluorescence emission before (dashed line) and after (solid line) Nx insertion was measured at 720 nm, beyond the emission maximum, to be able to record an excitation spectrum covering the whole red region of chlorophyll absorption. Close inspection of the Soret region of excitation reveals a contribution of newly inserted Nx at ∼492 nm. This shoulder was also present in the spectrum of fully pigmented NLL·LHCIIb obtained by folding the protein in the presence of both Lu and Nx (Fig. 5, dotted line). The insertion reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 12°C before taking the excitation spectra. The slight difference in the blue region between insertion product and fully pigmented NLL·LHCIIb did not indicate deficient coupling of Nx but was caused by Nx insertion not yet being completed after 1 h under these conditions (see below, Fig. 12).FIGURE 5Inserted Nx contributes to chlorophyll fluorescence and increases overall quantum yield.

This study documents a novel biochemical activity of human REV1 protein, due to higher affinity for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) than the primer terminus. Preferential binding to long ssDNA regions of the template strand means that REV1 is targeted specifically to the included primer termini, a property not shared by other DNA polymerases, including human DNA polymerases α, β, and η. Furthermore, a mutant REV1 lacking N- and C-terminal domains, but catalytically active, lost this function, indicating that control is not due to the catalytic core.

Methyl methanesulfonate-induced mutagenesis has been shown to be normal in a site-directed mutant lacking deoxycytidyltransferase activity (25Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although the REV1 protein does not allow bypass of thymine-thymine (6-4) photoproducts in vitro, the gene is required for bypass replication of this lesion in yeast cells (24Nelson J.R. Gibbs P.E. Nowicka A.M. Hinkle D.C. Lawrence C.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 26Otsuka C. Kobayashi K. Kawaguchi N. Kunitomi N. Moriyama K. Hata Y.

Res. 2005; 578: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). With respect to the second function, the BRCA1 C-terminal domain of REV1 has an essential function, mutation abolishing UV-induced mutagenesis, even if the protein retains normal levels of transferase activity in vitro (24Nelson J.R. Gibbs P.E. Nowicka A.M. Hinkle D.C. Lawrence C.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 27Otsuka C. Kunitomi N. Iwai S. Loakes D. Negishi K. Mutat. Res. 2005; 578: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Evolutionary preservation of functions of the mammalian REV1 gene was first indicated by the finding that human cell lines expressing high levels of human REV1 antisense RNA exhibit a much reduced frequency of 6-thioguanine-resistant mutants induced by UV light (10Gibbs P.E.

This feature was confirmed in another experimental system using a ribozyme that cleaves human REV1 mRNA (28Clark D.R. Zacharias W. Panaitescu L. McGregor W.G.

DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 1182-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mouse embryonic stem cells carrying a mutation lacking the BRCA1 C-terminal domain of the Rev1 gene also exhibit sensitivity to a wide range of DNA-damaging agents and a reduced level of UV light-induced mutations (30Jansen J.G. de Wind N.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recently, chicken ΔRev1-DT40 cell lines were generated and found to exhibit slow growth and sensitivity to a wide range of DNA-damaging agents (32Simpson L.J. Sale J.E.

Although studies of the cellular functions of the REV1 gene in yeast to humans have shed light on its importance for maintaining genetic integrity, the biochemical basis is poorly understood. It is known that both mouse and human REV1 proteins interact with REV7 and other Y family polymerases through the same C-terminal region (35Murakumo Y. Ogura Y. Ishii H. Numata S. Ichihara M.

In particular, the REV1-REV7 interaction is very stable and results in formation of a heterodimer in yeast and humans (39Masuda Y. Ohmae M. Masuda K. Kamiya K. J. Biol.

In this report, we document a novel biochemical property of human REV1. We show that REV1 has single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding activity with affinity much higher than that of the primer-template. After binding to ssDNA, REV1 can translocate and be targeted to primer termini. We consider that this property might reflect a particular biochemical function required for regulation of the repair pathway involved in lesion bypass replication.

Fractions containing h6-p180-p70 were pooled and loaded at 0.1 ml/min onto a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl. The h6-p180-p70 peak fractions were pooled, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by protein assay using BSA (Bio-Rad) as the standard. Primer Extension Assay—The primers were labeled using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare) and annealed to the respective templates. The standard reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm dCTP, 100 nm primer-template, and 1 μl of protein sample diluted with buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) as indicated. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, reactions were terminated with 10 μl of stop solution (30 mm EDTA, 94% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol), and products were resolved on 20% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea and autoradiographed at –80 °C. The amount of DNA present in each band was quantified using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). The conditions for the primer extension assay for DNA polymerase shown in Fig. 4B were identical to those for the dCMP transferase assay. DNA Polymerase Assay—DNA polymerase activities shown in Fig. 4A were measured by incorporation of [α-32P]dCMP using the unlabeled primer-template, P5786T, as a substrate. The reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm each of dGTP, dATP, dTTP, and [α-32P]dCTP (GE Healthcare), 100 nm primer-template (P5786T), and 1 μl of protein sample diluted with buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) as indicated. Ten ng of REV1, 3 ng of pol α, 2 ng of pol β, and 10 ng of pol η were used in 25-μl reaction mixtures. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, reactions were terminated with 10 μl of 30 mm EDTA, and then 1-μl samples were spotted on DE81 paper (Whatman), which was washed three times with 0.5 m Na2HPO4. The amount of incorporated [α-32P]dCMP was determined as the radioactivity retained on the paper (48Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Appendix E.19, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and quantified using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.) Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Poly[d(C-T)] oligonucleotides with various lengths were labeled using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare). Assays of DNA binding were performed with modification of a method described previously (6Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Tsunekuni N. Minami T. Sumii M. Miyagawa K. Kamiya K. J. Biol.

Reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm dCTP, 50 pm oligonucleotide, and 1 μl of protein sample diluted with buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) as indicated. Incubation was on ice for 20 min followed by loading on prerunning 4% polyacrylamide gels (79:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide). The electrophoresis buffer contained 6 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 0.1 mm EDTA, and the gels were subjected to a constant voltage of 8 V/cm for 2 h at 6°C. Following gel electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiographed at –80 °C. High Affinity Binding of REV1 to ssDNA—During biochemical characterization of the dCMP transferase reactions of human REV1 protein, we found a synthetic oligonucleotide, H1, to be a strong inhibitor of the transferase activity of the REV1 (Fig. 1A). In reactions containing 100 nm primer-template and 2.8 nm REV1, the transferase activity dropped to less than 10% in the presence of 10 nm of the H1 (Fig. 1, A and B). To ascertain whether the inhibitory effect was because of a specific nucleotide sequence, oligonucleotides of different sequences (H2–H4) were tested (Fig. 1B). The results suggested that the inhibitory effect was not because of a specific nucleotide sequence, although each oligonucleotide exhibited a different extent of inhibition. When the oligonucleotide was annealed with the complementary oligonucleotide and converted to double-stranded DNA, such an effect was much decreased (Fig. 1B). The remaining effect might be due to trace contamination of ssDNA (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that the effect is due to local secondary structures formed by the oligonucleotides, we tested 30- and 60-mer oligonucleotides composed of one or two nucleotides, which are guaranteed not to form secondary structures (Fig. 1, C and D). The results revealed general features for the inhibition. First, it was not because of secondary structures of the oligonucleotides. Second, the composition of the nucleotides affected the extent of inhibition, whereas polypurines, poly(dA) and poly[d(A-G)], showed no effect. Third, the extent of inhibition was stronger with 60- than 30-mer oligonucleotides with the same composition of nucleotides. Furthermore, we systematically addressed the effect of the length using poly[d(C-T)] as a model oligonucleotide (Fig. 1E) and found the extent of inhibition to correlate synergistically with the length. In a control experiment, we demonstrated that REV1 could not transfer dCMP to the 3′ end of the d(C-T)30, 60-mer oligonucleotide, under those reaction conditions (supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that the inhibition is not because of random priming reactions with the oligonucleotide. In following experiments, we used poly[d(C-T)] oligonucleotides as model ssDNA substrates. The inhibitory effect might be due to high affinity binding of the REV1 to the ssDNA, and consequently, it should compete with the primer-template. To examine REV1 ssDNA binding activity, we performed gel mobility shift assays using poly[d(C-T)] oligonucleotides with various lengths as substrates and detected REV1-ssDNA complexes (Fig. 2A). When we tested the d(C-T)15, 30-mer oligonucleotide, as a substrate, no complexes could be detected. However, when the length was increased, complexes became visible and were stable. The apparent affinity of REV1 for the oligonucleotides proved to be relative to their lengths. On the 60-mer oligonucleotide, the apparent affinity was very high with less than 1 nm of estimated Kd. Most importantly, the degree of apparent affinity of REV1 for the oligonucleotides of various lengths showed good agreement with the degrees of their inhibitory effects on transferase activity (Fig. 1E). Analysis of Truncated REV1 Proteins—Next, we examined the properties of truncated REV1 proteins (Δ1–Δ5) (Fig. 1F) with intact transferase activity (Fig. 3E, panel a). First, the inhibitory effects of 60-mer poly[d(C-T)] were examined (Fig. 1G). The effect of truncation of the C-terminal Δ3 and Δ4 was the same as observed with the full-length protein. On the other hand, truncation of the N-terminal Δ1 and Δ2 resulted in partial resistance to ssDNA. However, truncation of both N- and C-terminal Δ5 showed a much greater effect. The activity of the mutant protein Δ5 consisting of only the transferase domain was not inhibited by the oligonucleotide, indicating inhibition by ssDNA to be modulated by domains outside the transferase domain of REV1. Then we tested ssDNA binding activity of the mutants (Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, binding of the 60-mer poly[d(C-T)] to all the truncated proteins was essentially identical to that to full-length REV1 (Fig. 2B). With the full-length REV1, the transferase activity could be inhibited by ssDNA binding. However, this was not the case with truncated protein Δ5. Therefore, we addressed the question of whether the primer-template is accessible to REV1-ssDNA complexes (Fig. 2, C and D). If REV1 could interact with a primer-template after forming a complex with ssDNA, the complex would be sensitive to an addition of a large amou"

Glutamate can influence these events via N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. The neuropeptides vasoactive intestinal peptide and pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP38) affect neurogenesis and differentiation in the developing nervous system. We report here that the peptides and NMDA acted synergistically on dendrite and branch formation. In stage III hippocampal neurons, NMDA increased not only the addition but also the elimination of new dendrites and branches by activating Rac and Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, respectively. When applied alone, the neuropeptides did not influence dendrite or branch formation. However, they reduced the elimination of newly formed dendrites and branches caused by NMDA by preventing the NMDA-induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases. This led to the formation of persistent dendrites and branches. Additional timelapse studies on the dynamics of dendrite elongation showed alternating periods of elongation and retraction. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases increased the velocities of dendrite elongation and retraction, whereas the neuropeptides prolonged the periods of elongation. By modifying NMDA-induced activation of Rho GTPases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, vasoactive intestinal peptide and PACAP38 could play an important role in the control of dendrite growth and branching during development and in response to neuronal activity.

In Xenopus optic tectal neurons, the neurotransmitter glutamate changes the activity of Rho GTPases by acting on ionotropic NMDA (NMDAR) and l-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptors. It facilitates dendrite formation by inhibiting RhoA and activating Rac (10Li Z. Aizenman C.D. Cline H.T.

Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating peptide-38 (PACAP38) belong to the secretin-glucagon-VIP family of peptides (21Vaudry D. Gonzalez B.J. Basille M. Yon L. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 269-324PubMed Google Scholar). VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors are shared by VIP and PACAP38, whereas only PACAP38 binds with high affinity to the PAC1 receptor (PAC1R) (22Harmar A.J. Arimura A. Gozes I. Journot L. Laburthe M.

In the adult brain, PACAP38 enhances NMDAR function via PAC1R (30Yaka R. He D.Y. Phamluong K. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9630-9638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We have studied the NMDA- and VIP/PACAP38-induced dendrite and branch morphogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons of the rat. Our biochemical analysis provided evidence that only the synergism of NMDA and VIP/PACAP38 induced changes in Rho GTPase, and PI3K activities led to a pronounced dendritic development. In contrast, activation of NMDAR alone enhanced dendritic motility by activating Rac, Cdc42, and PI3Ks but did not promote dendritogenesis. Materials—NMDA and LY294002 were from Tocris (Köln, Germany). Y-27632, H89, KN93, KN92, nimodipine, and dizocilpine (MK801) were from Calbiochem, and wortmannin was from Sigma. The expression plasmids encoding the GST-PAK-CRIB domain and the pGEXC21 plasmid were gifts of Dr. J. G. Collard (Amsterdam, Netherlands). Poly-l-lysine, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, and StartV medium were from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany); B27 supplement was from Invitrogen; PACAP38, VIP, and the VPAC1R agonist, [Arg16]secretin, were from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals (Karlsruhe, Germany). Neuronal Cell Culture—Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from brains of embryonic rats at day 17. Dissociated cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 104 cells/cm2 on 10-mm glass coverslips or for biochemical experiments on 10-cm cell culture dishes (Greiner Bio-One, Solingen, Germany). Both were coated with poly-l-lysine. The incubation medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum with a low endotoxin level (<0.5 enzyme units/ml). After 1 day in culture, the incubation medium was replaced by serum-free differentiation medium, which consisted of StartV medium, supplemented with B27, HEPES, pH 7.3. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with low oxygen conditions to mimic physiological conditions (6.5% CO2 and 9% O2) (31Brewer G.J. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1989; 494: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Within hours after plating, hippocampal neurons developed 4-5 neurites and progressed through stages I and II, according to Bradke and Dotti (36Bradke F. Dotti C.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Under these culture conditions, most neurons remained dissociated; only a few formed clusters. The cells showed a density of ∼4 × 104 cells/cm2 at stage III when experiments were performed. Cytochemical Staining—Cultured hippocampal neurons were fixed for 12 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in a cytoskeletal stabilization buffer (CSB) containing 80 mm Pipes, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 4% polyethylene glycol (Mr 35,000) (32Schaefer A.W. Kabir N. Forscher P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). After washing with CSB, neurons were permeabilized for 2 min with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in CSB. Normal goat serum was used to block nonspecific binding. For β-tubulin III staining, cells were incubated with a monoclonal mouse anti-β-tubulin III antibody (1:4000; Sigma); for p-Akt staining, neurons were incubated with a rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-Ser473 Akt antibody (1:100; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). The resulting immune complexes were visualized with an Alexa 488-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat antimouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Heidelberg, Germany). For F-actin staining, cells were incubated with Alexa 594-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Heidelberg, Germany) and washed with PBS. Preparation of Transfection Vectors and Cell Transfection—The coding regions of the RhoAN19 and Rac1N17 genes were excised from the plasmid pGEX with BamHI/EcoRI and inserted in-frame into the BglII/EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). The coding region of the Cdc42N17 gene was excised from the plasmid pcDNA3 with BamHI/EcoRI and inserted in-frame into the BglII/EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1. The plasmids coding for the dominant-negative YFP-p110γ K833R and the constitutive active p110γ CAAX (where AA is aliphatic amino acid) were provided by Bernd Nürnberg (Düsseldorf, Germany). The YFP-p110γ K833R and the p110γ CAAX constructs were functionally tested in a culture of rat astrocytes where they inhibited and elevated the PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of Ser473Akt. All plasmids were confirmed by restriction digest analysis and sequencing. Cells were transfected for 1.5 h at 2.5% CO2 using the calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation procedure. After transfection, neurons were grown for 16 h prior to use. To increase transfection efficiency, we used DIV4 hippocampal neurons. Under these conditions, the calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation procedure, which does not change neuronal morphology (33Washbourne P. McAllister A.K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), produced transfection rates of 3-8%. Expression of GST-PAK-Cdc42/Rac Interactive Binding (CRIB) Domain and Expression of GST-C21 Protein—GST-C21 contains the N-terminal 90 amino acids of the RhoA-binding region of the RhoA effector Rhotekin. The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells grown at 37 °C. Expression was induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at A600 1.0. Two hours after induction, the cells were collected and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was used for purification of the GST-PAK-CRIB-/GST-C21 domain by affinity purification using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads loaded with the GST fusion proteins were washed twice with GST-fishing-buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin) at 4 °C. GST-PAK-CRIB Domain/GST-C21 Domain Pulldown Experiments—Approximately 1 × 106 neurons were used for Rac or for Cdc42 experiments; ∼4 × 106 neurons were used for the RhoA experiments. Cells were treated with drugs as indicated under “Results.” After addition of 250 μl of GST-fishing-buffer, cells were harvested. The detergent-soluble supernatant was recovered after centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 × g and at 4 °C. GTP-Rac, GTP-Cdc42, or GTP-RhoA proteins were precipitated for 1 h with 20 μl of GST-PAK/GST-C21 fusion protein at 4 °C. The complexes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, resuspended, and boiled with Laemmli buffer. Bound Rac, Cdc42, and RhoA proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-Rac1 (1:1000; BD Biosciences), anti-Cdc42 (1:1000; Upstate, Milton Keynes, UK), or anti-RhoA antibodies (1:400; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphorylation Assay for Akt—After drug treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS. Ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin) was added, and the neurons were harvested. The detergent-soluble supernatant was recovered after centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 × g and at 4 °C. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis. To determine the phosphorylation of Akt, anti-phospho-Ser473Akt and anti-Akt antibodies were used (1:1000; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Densitometric analysis of films was performed with the ImageQuant TL software (American BioSciences, Sunnyvale, CA). Time-lapse Light Microscopy—To determine the dynamics of branch formation as well as dendrite elongation, hippocampal neurons were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass-bottom microwell dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and used for timelapse light microscopy. Neurons were incubated in a custommade chamber at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (6.5% CO2, 9% O2), staged on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope system equipped with a digital camera (Coolsnap HQ; Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ). Differential interference contrast (DIC) images were acquired every 60 s with a Zeiss ×40; A:1.4 oil immersion objective for 8 h. To minimize phototoxicity, an automatic shutter was used (100 ms/frame). The Metamorph 6.5.2 software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA) was used to acquire and process the resulting stacks of images. For analysis of branch formation, we distinguished dendritic branches from filopodia using the following parameters: branches have a lifetime longer than 20 min, whereas filopodia have a mean lifetime of ∼10 min in immature dendrites (34Ziv N.E. Smith S.J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Typically filopodia are less than 5 μm in length (35Maletic-Savatic M. Malinow R. Svoboda K. Science. 1999; 283: 1923-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The number of branches detected by DIC microscopy corresponded to that of tubulin-containing branches found in immunohistochemical experiments. After acquisition of the time-lapse movies, neurons were fixed and stained for β-tubulin III and F-actin to ensure that the appropriate structures were analyzed and that the respective neuron was in a healthy condition. For analysis of dendrite elongation, we tracked primary dendritic length in intervals of 20 min. We analyzed the movies of at least 10 neurons for each treatment group. Morphometry of Fixed Cells—The dendrites were distinguished from the axon of a stage III hippocampal neuron by use of morphological criteria (36Bradke F. Dotti C.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Developing axons contain microtubules up to their tips, whereas dendrites contain microtubules only in their proximal part (37Portera-Cailliau C. Pan D.T. Yuste R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7129-7142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Axons have few or no axonal branches. In addition, we performed TAU-2 staining to confirm the presence and identity of axons. To quantify the number of dendrites, their branches, and the dendritic length, we took images of the phalloidin staining for F-actin and of the β-tubulin III staining. Primary dendrites were defined as extensions with a length longer than the average perikaryon (∼10 μm) and a positive β-tubulin III staining in the proximal part. The cytoskeleton of a dendritic branch contains microtubules with a cortex of actin close to the plasma membrane (9Van Aelst L. Cline H.T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Therefore, a dendritic branch was defined as a β-tubulin containing process arising from a dendrite. Extensions containing only F-actin were defined as dendritic filopodia. Only isolated neurons were chosen for analysis, because cell-cell contacts can influence dendritic differentiation (38Kirby M.A. Chalupa L.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1986; 251: 532-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The hippocampal culture contained less than 1% astrocytes, as determined with glial fibrillary acidic protein immunohistochemistry for astrocytes and β-tubulin III immunohistochemistry for neurons. Therefore, interactions between astrocytes and neurons were negligible. We never observed any signs of increased cell death under any treatment. Cellular uptake of propidium iodide was not enhanced, nor did the neurons show morphological signs of degeneration, such as neurite loss or pearl string neurites. Cells were imaged with the Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope system. Images were processed with the Metamorph software. They were thresholded, and dendrites were defined. Cell bodies were marked and then dendrite numbers were determined by using the “measure count object” function. For dendrite measurement, the integrated morphometry analysis tool was used to measure dendritic length in the respective region. Numerical values of number and length measurements were logged onto Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA) automatically. We performed each experiment at least three times. For quantification, we analyzed 50 neurons for each treatment group. Confocal Microscopy—A Zeiss LSM 510 visible confocal system was used to acquire z-stacks of representative neurons, afterward vertical projections were performed. When the growth cone at the tip of a neurite was not visible in the vertical projection, a horizontal projection was performed to confirm its existence. Statistical Analysis—The Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test (for multiple comparisons) were used. If samples showed normal distribution, analysis of variance and Scheffe's test or Student's t test were used. NMDA Induces Dendritogenesis Only in Combination with VIP/PACAP38 or ROCK Inhibition—In Xenopus tectal neurons, the development of the dendritic arbor requires glutamate receptor activity (39Sin W.C. Haas K. Ruthazer E.S. Cline H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In our experiments we used cultured hippocampal neurons that were at stage III of differentiation. After 2 days in vitro (DIV2), they had formed an axon and several dendrites (36Bradke F. Dotti C.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 40de Anda F.C. Pollarolo G. da Silva J.S. Camoletto P.G. Feiguin F. Dotti C.G. Nature. 2005; 436: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Added to the hippocampal neurons for 8 h, NMDA (5 μm) increased the number of filopodia from 0.96 ± 0.19/30 μm in controls to 2.78 ± 0.28 filopodia/30 μm(p < 0.001), indicating that it changed the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. However, NMDA had minimal or no effects on the average number of dendrites and branches (Fig. 1A and Table 1). In Xenopus tectal neurons, the glutamate-induced decrease in RhoA activity is important for the dendrite and branch formation (10Li Z. Aizenman C.D. Cline H.T. Neuron. 2002; 33: 741-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In contrast, in our hippocampal neurons NMDA did not reduce the level of GTP-bound RhoA (Fig. 2A), which represents RhoA activity (41Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar).TABLE 1NMDA, VIP, and PACAP38 as well as ROCK inhibitors change the numbers of dendrites and branchesNo. of dendritesNo. of branchesControl3.1 ± 0.250.3 ± 0.13NMDA3.6 ± 0.11aValue shows significant difference (p < 0.05) compared with controls.0.5 ± 0.15VIP3.4 ± 0.130.5 ± 0.14PACAP383.3 ± 0.100.4 ± 0.11[Arg16]Secretin3.5 ± 0.110.4 ± 0.18NMDA + VIP4.7 ± 0.14aValue shows significant difference (p < 0.05) compared with controls.,bValue shows significant difference (p < 0.05) compared with NMDA.,cValue shows significant difference (p < 0.05) compared with VIP, PACAP38, [Arg16]secretin, Y-27632, and H-1152, respectively.

Electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone is coupled with the translocation of protons across the membrane by a yet unknown mechanism. Redox-induced Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy showed that the oxidation of iron-sulfur cluster N2 located on NuoB is accompanied by the protonation of acidic amino acid(s). Here, we describe the effect of mutating the conserved acidic amino acids on NuoB. The complex was assembled in all mutants but the electron transfer activity was completely abolished in the mutants E67Q, D77N, and D94N. The complex isolated from these mutants contained N2 although in diminished amounts. The protonation of acidic amino acid(s) coupled with the oxidation of N2 was not detectable in the complex from the mutant E67Q. However, the conservative mutations E67D and D77E did not disturb the enzymatic activity, and the signals because of the protonation of acidic amino acid(s) were detectable in the E67D mutant.

J. 1980; 186: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that N2 is involved in proton translocation and functions as the direct electron donor of quinone (21Ingledew W.J. Ohnishi T. Biochem.

This idea is supported by the fact that N2 interacts with ubisemiquinone radicals identified in submitochondrial particles (22Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys.

Two semiquinone radicals coined SQNf and SQNs have been identified by the group of T. Ohnishi. Distances of 12 Å and more than 30 Å between N2/SQNf and N2/SQNs, respectively, were calculated (26Yano T. Dunham W.R. Ohnishi T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1744-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).If N2 participates in proton pumping, its redox reaction is coupled to a protonation/deprotonation of the cluster itself and/or of surrounding amino acids. We demonstrated by means of electrochemically induced FT-IR difference spectroscopy of complex I from site-directed mutants that the reduction of N2 is accompanied by the protonation of Tyr114 and Tyr139 on NuoB (numbering according to the E. coli sequence; Ref. 27Flemming D. Hellwig P. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3055-3062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Other important features of the infrared difference spectra are a positive absorption around 1,712 cm-1, which has been attributed to protonated aspartic or glutamic side chains, and negative absorptions at 1,556 and 1,410 cm-1 attributed to the respective signals of the deprotonated forms (28Hellwig P. Scheide D. Bungert S. Mäntele W. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10884-10891Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These data indicated that the oxidation of N2 is coupled with the protonation of acidic amino acid(s). In this study, we mutated the conserved acidic amino acids on NuoB and characterized the mutants by their enzymatic activity and by means of EPR- and FT-IR-spectroscopy. Our data showed that Glu67, Asp77, and Asp94 are essential for electron transfer. We are discussing the role of Glu67, the acidic amino acid most likely protonated by the oxidation of N2, for proton translocation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Strains—E. coli strain ANN023 (19Flemming D. Schlitt A. Spehr V. Bischof T. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47602-47609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) is a derivative of strain AN387 (29Wallace B.J. Young I.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 461: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and was generated using a genomic replacement method as described (27Flemming D. Hellwig P. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3055-3062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It contains a chromosomal in-frame deletion of nuoB. E. coli strains DH5α (30Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (8124) Google Scholar), XL1-Blue Supercompetent cells (Stratagene) and the plasmids pSTBlue-1 (Novagen) and pBAD33 (31Guzman L. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bact. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3904) Google Scholar) were used. When required for maintenance of plasmids, chloramphenicol was added to 20 mg/liter and ampicillin to 100 mg/liter. All enzymes used for recombinant DNA techniques were from MBI Fermentas (St. Leon-Roth). All other chemicals were from Merck and Sigma.Site-directed Mutagenesis and Expression of nuoB—Point mutations were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the corresponding primers are given in the supplemental data (Table S1). The plasmid pBAD/nuoB was used as template as described (27Flemming D. Hellwig P. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3055-3062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmids containing the desired mutation were used for transformation of the deletion strain ANN023. In this strain, expression of NuoB and complementation of the chromosomal deletion was carried out by adding arabinose to a final concentration of 0.2% (w/v) as described (19Flemming D. Schlitt A. Spehr V. Bischof T. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47602-47609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Growth of Cells and Isolation of Complex I—Parental strain and mutant E. coli strains were grown aerobically in 10 liters culture of LB medium at 37 °C to the late exponential growth phase. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 × g, washed with 50 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.0 and stored at -80 °C. Complex I was isolated from the mutants as described (27Flemming D. Hellwig P. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3055-3062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In principle, the proteins were extracted from the cytoplasmic membrane with 3% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside (Glycon) in 50 mm MES/NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.0 and applied to a first anion-exchange chromatography on Source 15Q (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity were combined, concentrated by precipitation with 9% (w/v; final concentration) poly(ethylene glycol) 4,000 and dissolved in 2 ml of 50 mm MES/NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, pH 6.0. The protein was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 (Amersham Biosciences) in the same buffer. Peak fractions were pooled and applied to a 10 ml Source 15Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated as described above. Fractions with NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity were pooled and stored at -80 °C.Electrochemistry—The ultra-thin layer spectroelectrochemical cell for the visible (vis) and infrared (IR) was used as previously described (32Hellwig P. Behr J. Ostermeier C. Richter O.-M.H. Pfitzner U. Odenwald A. Ludwig B. Michel H. Mäntele W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7390-7399Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Sufficient transmission in the 1,800 cm-1 to 1,000 cm-1 range, even in the region of strong water absorbance around 1,645 cm-1, was achieved with the cell pathlength set to 6-8 μm. To avoid protein denaturation, the gold grid working electrode was chemically modified by a 2 mm cysteamine solution as reported (32Hellwig P. Behr J. Ostermeier C. Richter O.-M.H. Pfitzner U. Odenwald A. Ludwig B. Michel H. Mäntele W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7390-7399Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In order to accelerate the redox reaction, mediators were used at a final concentration of 45 mm each as described (28Hellwig P. Scheide D. Bungert S. Mäntele W. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10884-10891Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). At the given concentrations and with the pathlength below 10 mm, no spectral contributions from the mediators in the vis and IR range used were detected in control experiments with samples lacking the protein. Approximately 6-7 μl of the protein solution were sufficient to fill the spectroelectrochemical cell.FT-IR Spectroscopy—FT-IR and vis difference spectra as a function of the applied potential were obtained simultaneously from the same sample with a setup combining an IR beam from the interferometer (modified IFS 25, Bruker, Germany) for the 4,000 cm-1 to 1,000 cm-1 range and a dispersive spectrometer for the 400-900 nm range as reported previously (33Moss D.A. Nabedryk E. Breton J. Mäntele W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). First, the protein was equilibrated with an initial potential at the electrode, and single beam spectra in the vis and IR range were recorded. Then, a potential step toward the final potential was applied, and single beam spectra of this state were recorded after equilibration. Difference spectra were calculated from the two single beam spectra with the initial single beam spectrum taken as reference. IR-double difference spectra were obtained by a subtraction of the samples normalized at 460 nm. No smoothing or deconvolution procedures were applied. The equilibration process for each applied potential was followed by monitoring the electrode current and by successively recording spectra in the vis range until no further changes were observed. Generally, the equilibration took less than 8 min for the full potential step from -0.7 V to 0.2 V. Typically, 128 interferograms at 4 cm-1 resolution were coadded for each single beam IR spectrum and Fourier-transformed using triangular apodization. 20-25 difference spectra have been averaged. The presence of atmospheric water vapor was avoided as described (28Hellwig P. Scheide D. Bungert S. Mäntele W. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10884-10891Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).EPR Spectroscopy—EPR measurements were conducted with a Bruker EMX 1/6 spectrometer operating at X-band (9.2 GHz). The sample temperature was controlled with an Oxford instrument ESR-9 helium flow cryostat. The magnetic field was calibrated using a strong or a weak pitch standard. The isolated complex I (2-4 mg/ml) was reduced with a few grains of dithionite in the presence of 15 mm NADH (12Spehr V. Schlitt A. Scheide D. Guénebaut V. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16261-16267Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The relative amount of the individual clusters was determined by simulation of the spectra as described (11Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Potentiometric redox titrations were performed as described (11Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).Other Analytical Procedures—The (deamino-) NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity and the (deamino-) NADH oxidase activity were measured as described (34Friedrich T. Hofhaus G. Ise W. Nehls U. Schmitz B. Weiss H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 35Friedrich T. van Heek P. Leif H. Ohnishi T. Forche E. Kunze B.

Protein concentration was measured with the biuret method using bovine serum albumin as standard. Sucrose gradient centrifugation in the presence of 0.2% dodecyl maltoside was performed as described (11Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 12Spehr V. Schlitt A. Scheide D. Guénebaut V. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16261-16267Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE protein bands were either stained with Coomassie Blue or silver (36Dunbar B.S. Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Immunological Techniques. Plenum Press, New York1987: 1-372Google Scholar). Alternatively, the separated proteins were electroblotted onto 0.45-μm pore size nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher und Schüll) for Western blot analysis (37Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 1320: 217-234Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against NuoB was used for detection. Analytical gelfiltration was performed on a 14 ml of PolySep-GFC-P4,000 column (Phenomenex) in 50 mm MES/NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, pH 6.0 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Each run was loaded with 0.2 mg of complex I.RESULTSConserved Acidic Amino Acids on NuoB—The homologues of NuoB from bacterial and mitochondrial complex I from 35 species were aligned. As an example the alignment of five different sequences is shown in Fig. 1. NuoB contains eight conserved acidic amino acids including two glutamates and five aspartates, respectively. Either a glutamate or an aspartate is present at position 119 (E. coli numbering). In this study, these acidic amino acids were changed individually to the corresponding amide. The assembly and the enzymatic activity of complex I in these mutants was investigated. The enzyme was isolated from the inactive mutants and characterized by means of EPR and FT-IR spectroscopy. Aspartic acids that were identified to be of functional importance were subsequently changed to glutamic acids and vice versa.Catalytic Activity of the Mutant Strains—The E. coli strain ANN023 lacks subunit NuoB and is therefore not able to assemble an intact complex I (27Flemming D. Hellwig P. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3055-3062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). By complementing the chromosomal in-frame deletion strain with nuoB on a plasmid under control of the inducible pBAD promotor, the amount of complex I in membranes was restored to 90% of the wild-type level (27Flemming D. Hellwig P. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3055-3062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Strain ANN023 complemented with wild-type nuoB on the plasmid is referred to as parental strain throughout this study. Strain ANN023 carrying the pBAD plasmid without an insert is coined control strain. Mutants of all eight conserved acidic amino acids on NuoB were generated using this plasmid-borne mutagenesis system. Possible contamination with wild-type cells were excluded by withdrawing an aliquot of the culture before induction and growth of this aliquot in the presence of 0.2% (w/v) glucose. Under these conditions, the expression of nuoB is repressed and no complex I activity was detectable in any experiments. Enzymatic activities were determined with at least two independent cultures. The presence of subunit NuoB in the mutant membranes after induction with arabinose was confirmed by Western blot analysis (supplemental data, Fig. S3). Sucrose gradient centrifugation showed the presence of an assembled complex I in the cytoplasmic membrane of all mutant strains (supplemental data, Fig. S4).The NADH dehydrogenase activity of bacterial membranes was measured as NADH/ferricyanide and deamino (d)-NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity, respectively, to discriminate the two membrane-bound NADH dehydrogenases of E. coli (35Friedrich T. van Heek P. Leif H. Ohnishi T. Forche E. Kunze B. Jansen R. Trowitzsch-Kienast W. Höfle G. Reichenbach H. Weiss H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 38Matsushita K.

Whereas the non-energy converting, alternative NADH dehydrogenase has a very low affinity to d-NADH, complex I has the same affinity toward NADH and d-NADH (35Friedrich T. van Heek P. Leif H.

Because NuoB is not involved in this reaction, the amount of complex I in the cytoplasmic membranes of the mutants can be estimated from the d-NADH/ferricyanide reductase assay (Table 1). The control strain ANN023/pBAD did not show any complex I activity. Complex I content was reduced by approximately one third in mutants D152N and E163Q and by one-fourth in mutants E67Q, D77N, D94N, and D146N. The amount of complex I in the cytoplasmic membranes of the D115N and E119Q mutant strains was comparable to the one of the parental strain (Table 1). The amount of complex I in the mutant membranes as determined by the d-NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity correlates well with the amount of subunit NuoB determined by Western blotting (supplemental data, Fig. S3). The NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity was only slightly reduced in all mutant strains indicating that the production of the alternative NADH dehydrogenase was increased in E. coli strains with a reduced amount of complex I as reported earlier (12Spehr V. Schlitt A. Scheide D. Guénebaut V. Friedrich T.

This reaction rate normalized to the amount of the complex in the membranes as deduced from the d-NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity reveals the catalytic rate of the mutant complex. The rate was 45-90% of the activity of the parental strain in the D115N, E119Q, D146N, D152N, and E163Q mutants (Table 1). This activity was sensitive to piericidin A, a specific complex I inhibitor, indicating that complex I was functional in these mutants although at a slower rate. The mutants E67Q, D77N, and D94N showed about 10% of the activity of the parental strain. This residual activity was not inhibited by 10 μm piericidin A and therefore was not derived from the physiological activity of the complex. Thus, complex I is inactive in these mutants. From this we concluded that Glu67, Asp77, and Asp94 are essential for the physiological electron transfer in the E. coli complex I and focused our further studies on these mutants.Isolation of Complex I from the Mutant Strains—To determine whether the reduced activity of complex I in the distinct mutants was due to the loss of a cofactor or the replacement of a functionally important amino acid, we attempted to isolate the enzyme from the mutants and to characterize them by EPR and FT-IR spectroscopy. The complex from the E67Q and the D77N mutants showed comparable chromatographic behavior. It eluted from both anion-exchange chromatographies on Source 15Q at 280 mm NaCl and from the Sephacryl S-300 size-exclusion column at 70 ml (supplemental data, Fig. S5). On an average 4 mg of complex I were obtained from 80 g of cells (supplemental data, Table S2). Upon SDS/PAGE the preparation was resolved into 12 subunits corresponding to the proteins encoded by the nuo-operon (supplemental data, Fig. S5). The subunits NuoE and J were not separated by SDS-PAGE as reported (11Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J.

Because of the presence of protein impurities additional bands were detectable in the early fractions of the gradient. These fractions were discarded. It was not possible to obtain a stable preparation from the D94N mutant. Thus, the preparations from the E67Q and D77N mutants were further investigated. They did not show any piericidin-sensitive NADH:decyl-ubiquinone reductase activity, even after activation with phospholipids (7Stolpe S. Friedrich T. J. Biol.

These data demonstrate the structural integrity of the preparations of the complex from the mutants.EPR Spectroscopic Analysis of the NuoB Mutants—The content of the Fe/S clusters in the preparations was determined by means of EPR-spectroscopy.

Here we provide the strongest evidence so far of such hierarchy and determine the time constants and weights of the kinetic components of the suggested hierarchic energy landscape. To our knowledge, the idea of hierarchical folding energy barriers has never been tested over such a broad timescale. Refolding of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase was initiated from the guanidine-unfolded state by stopped-flow or manual mixing and monitored by tryptophan fluorescence from 1 ms to 15 min. The strategy to build a model that describes folding of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase was to start from the simplest paradigm and modify it stepwise to the necessary minimal extent after repeated comparisons with the experiments. We made no a priori assumptions about the folding landscape. The result was a hierarchic finite level landscape model that quantitatively describes the refolding of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase from 1 ms to 15 min. The early steps of the folding process happen in the upper region of the landscape, where the surface has a hierarchic structure. This leads to stretched kinetics in the early phase of the folding. The lower region of the energy landscape is dominated by a trap that reflects the accumulation of molten globule intermediate state. From this intermediate, the protein can reach the global energy minimum corresponding to the native state through a cross-barrier folding step.

The general mechanism of protein folding, i.e. how the amino acid sequence directs the organization of the polypeptide chain toward the native structure, is still an unresolved problem. There is a wealth of experiments published in the literature, which provide background for the theories intending to describe protein folding, but a thorough understanding is still missing (1Gruebele M.

One of the most interesting predictions of landscape models is the existence of hierarchically structured protein folding energy surfaces that produce stretched folding kinetics that lack a characteristic time scale (25Metzler R. Klafter J. Jortner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11085-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Stretched refolding kinetics has been observed experimentally and explained using the energy landscape concept (23Yang W.Y. Pitera J.W. Swope W.C. Gruebele M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Sabelko J. Ervin J. Gruebele M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although these findings provide experimental tests of hierarchic energy landscapes, and show examples of kinetics that stretch over several orders of magnitude in time, the models presented to explain the results are based on a priori assumptions about the shape of the energy landscape. A possible starting point to treat complex kinetics is to write the time dependence of the concentrations (C) of different states in the following form (25Metzler R. Klafter J. Jortner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11085-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). C(t)=∑n=1Nanτnexp{−tτn}(Eq. 1) Here the parameters an are the amplitudes and τn the time constants of the Debye contributions, which correspond to different “levels” of the energy landscape. For a landscape that consists of a multitude of hierarchically structured kinetic barriers, the an and τn parameters are not independent, they obey a scaling relation. These scaling relations are apriori included in models that explain strange protein folding kinetics (23Yang W.Y. Pitera J.W. Swope W.C. Gruebele M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Sabelko J. Ervin J. Gruebele M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gruebele M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2283-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Apart from a few exceptions (25Metzler R. Klafter J. Jortner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11085-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) the summation is extended over an infinite number of components without considering the possibility of a hierarchic system with a finite number of Debye contributions. Two types of scaling relations are used most frequently. If the parameters follow a power law scaling: an = a1·αn–1 (0<α < 1); τn = τ1·λn–1 (λ >1), and the summation is extended to infinity, the resulting kinetics can be approximated by a power law function (25Metzler R. Klafter J. Jortner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11085-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). If the scaling of the parameters is: an = a1·αn–1 (0<α < 1) and τn = τ1·nχ (χ >1), and the summation is extended to infinity, the kinetics can be approximated by a stretched exponential (29Klafter J. Shlesinger M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 848-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The discrete character of the energy levels is reflected in the summation and yields a correction term of logarithmic oscillations superimposed on the kinetics (25Metzler R. Klafter J. Jortner J.

Razgulyaev O.I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). In spite that several details of PGK folding have been revealed, no coherent model exists to date that would explain the folding of this protein from a few milliseconds until the full refolding. Yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (yPGK) is a monomeric protein that is comprised of two domains linked by a helical hinge. It contains two tryptophans, both located on the C terminus. Trp333 is buried in the main hydrophobic core, and its fluorescence is strongly quenched in the native state, while Trp308 is located in a solvent-exposed turn, and it is less quenched in the native fold (40Sabelko J.J.

Sherman M.A. Mas M.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13943-13948Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Proline 204 is located in a loop between the helix of the interdomain hinge, and a β sheet of the C domain. It is highly conserved, and it is the only cis-proline in PGKs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus stearotermophilus, Trypanosoma brucei, and Thermotoga maritima (42McHarg J. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Cooper A. Littlechild J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this paper, we follow refolding of yPGK and explain the observed kinetics by a hierarchic finite level (HiFi) energy landscape model. Our results provide the strongest test so far of the hierarchic protein folding landscape concept. Protein Purification—Wild-type yPGK was purchased from Sigma and used after purity check by denaturing gel electrophoresis. The P204H mutant of a histidine-tagged version of the yPGK (HisPGK P204H) was constructed, expressed, and purified as described earlier (43Osváth S. Gruebele M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Edelhoch from the UV absorbance spectra measured on a Carry4E spectrophotometer (44Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). Samples were stored in 50 mm, pH 6.2, phosphate buffer at –80 °C. Kinetic Measurements—Refolding of samples containing 30–35 μm protein unfolded in 1.7 m GuHCl, 50 mm, pH 6.2, potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT aqueous solution, was initiated by 11-fold dilution with a similar buffer containing no GuHCl, using stopped-flow (Applied Photophysics π *-180) and manual mixing. Earlier experiments demonstrated that both yPGK variants studied here are completely unfolded at the conditions used before mixing (43Osváth S. Gruebele M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). After mixing, the wild-type protein is completely folded, and 85% of the P204H mutant is in the native state (43Osváth S. Gruebele M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Refolding was followed by time resolved changes of tryptophan (excited at 295 nm, 5 nm bandwidth) or ANS fluorescence (excited at 365 nm, 5 nm bandwidth) as described earlier (45Osváth S. Köhler G. Závodszky P. Fidy J. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1609-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Refolding of yPGK—Fig. 1A shows the refolding kinetics of the wild-type yPGK from the GuHCl unfolded state between 1 ms and 15 min after initializing refolding by rapid mixing. To build a model that describes yPGK folding we will pursue the following strategy. We start from the simplest paradigm and modify it stepwise to the necessary minimal extent after repeated comparison with the experiments. The simplest model for folding of any protein involves a single cooperative folding step, in which the unfolded (U) protein adopts its folded structure (F): U ↔ F. Such simple folding mechanisms give rise to single exponential folding kinetics, which could not describe our results. The experimental folding kinetics shows the accumulation of a hyperfluorescent state a few seconds after initializing folding. The native structure forms later, with a time constant of a few minutes. This is in agreement with an earlier publication (39Ptitsyn O.B. Pain R.H. Semisotnov G.V. Zerovnik E. Razgulyaev O.I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). We modified the folding mechanism to describe yPGK by the addition of an intermediate state (I), and the reaction scheme changed to the following: U ↔ I → F. Earlier circular dichroism detected GuHCl titrations have shown that under our refolding conditions (0.15 m GuHCl) 99.997% of the sample is in folded state (43Osváth S. Gruebele M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This means that the reaction pointing from the folded state toward non-native states is roughly 3·104 times slower than the refolding reaction. Refolding of yPGK takes more than 1 min, so the back reaction has a larger time constant than 3·104 min (roughly 20 days). Since the full time-window of our measurements is 15 min, the back reaction of the I → F transition was neglected in our model. The observed fluorescence signal can be calculated from the molar fractions of the unfolded (U), intermediate (I), and folded (F) species as follows. Fluo(t)=ΦU⋅U(t)+ΦI⋅I(t)+ΦI⋅F(t)(Eq. 2) Here ΦU, ΦI, and ΦF denote the fluorescence yield of the sample in the unfolded, intermediate, and folded states, respectively. The U ↔ I → F reaction yields a bi-exponential kinetics. Such time dependencies differed significantly from the detected refolding kinetics. We observed a gradual fluorescence intensity increase that stretched over more than 3 orders of magnitude in time: from one millisecond to several seconds. To describe this, we generated the transition from the unfolded to the intermediate state as the sum of several Debye contributions.

If the time constant of the monomolecular transition from I to F is τ, the system of differential equations describing such a scenario is as follows. dI(t)dt=−dU(t)dt−1τ⋅I(t)U(t)+I(t)+F(t)=1(Eq. 4) After solving the equations, the fluorescence intensity can be calculated as follows. Fluo(t)=ΦF+(ΦU−ΦF)⋅∑n=1N(anτnexp{−tτn})−(ΦI−ΦF)⋅∑n=1N(an/τn1−τn/τ(exp{−tτn}−exp{−tτ}))(Eq. 5) To adjust this general description to the studied problem, we performed least squares fits of the folding kinetics for different numbers N of exponential components in the U ← ··· → I transition. As the number of the exponential components was increased, the mean square deviation between the observed and calculated kinetics (χ2) decreased. This is easily explained by the increase in the number of the fit parameters. When trying to fit with a larger number of exponential components than five; however, unrealistic fit parameters were obtained (e.g. components with identical time constants or time constants that fell outside the measured time range). The best fit obtained with five independent exponentials gave a good fit of the experimental data. Fig. 1B shows the residuals of the fit. Fig. 2 shows the amplitudes (an) and time constants (τn) of the best fit. The logarithmic plot clearly indicates that both the amplitudes and the time constants show a power law scaling. Such scaling can arise if the folding reaction is directed by an energy landscape that contains a high number of small traps that are arranged in hierarchic structure (25Metzler R. Klafter J. Jortner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11085-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this case the an amplitudes and τn time constants are not independent parameters any more, they are connected through the scaling of the energy landscape (25Metzler R. Klafter J. Jortner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11085-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Following the implication of the scaling property found for the fit parameters, a scaled energy landscape model is proposed to describe the refolding of the yPGK. The equation describing this scenario is identical to the equation used in the fit with independent exponentials, but the amplitudes and time constants are connected through a power law scaling relation (25Metzler R. Klafter J. Jortner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11085-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). an=a1⋅αn−1, τn=τ1⋅λn−1(Eq. 6) The corresponding energy landscape has a large number of traps that can have N different depths, which give rise to a large number of independent relaxation pathways described by N different relaxation times. The fastest relaxation pathway has a time constant of τ1. Every deeper level has λ times longer relaxation time than the level before it. The number of the protein molecules following the pathway with the characteristic time τn is proportional to the an/τn ratio. The scaling property of the landscape reduces the number of the free fit parameters to the constants a1, τ1, α, and λ, regardless of N. The refolding of yPGK was modeled at several different numbers N of the levels in the scaled energy landscape. Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the mean square deviation of the best fit from the measured data (χ2) on the number N of the levels in the scaled landscape. Unlike in the fit with independent exponentials, here the increase in the number of the hierarchic levels does not change the number of the fit parameters, it only changes the shape of the fitting function. As it is clearly visible, a minimum χ2 was obtained with n = 5 levels. The residuals of the fit are shown in Fig. 1C. The parameters of the fit are summarized in Table 1. The χ2 of the fit with the scaled landscape model is 28.8·10–6, only slightly larger than that obtained with the fit using five independent exponentials for the U ← · · · → I transition (26.2·10–6). The number of the fit parameters is, however, much smaller in the case of the landscape model (six independent parameters) than in the case of the multi-exponential fit (13 independent parameters). This also argues in favor of the landscape model.TABLE 1Parameters of the fits with the U ← ··· → I → F modelyPGKhisPGK P204HyPGK, ANSχ2/10-6 (relative units)28.985.980.9τ (s)120.9 ± 1195.2 ± 10137.0 ± 14α6.0 ± 0.78.1 ± 1.15.8 ± 0.7λ8.0 ± 0.910.6 ± 1.26.6 ± 0.7τ1 (ms)2.4 ± 0.52.4 ± 0.51.5 ± 0.5N555 Open table in a new tab The scaling relation of the amplitudes and time constants seen in Fig. 2 could also come from an accidental coincidence in the interconversion rates of a small number of well defined intermediate states and in their fluorescence yields. If the scaling of the parameters is a mere coincidence, then a mutation that changes the interconversion rates of the supposed intermediate states should diminish the above scaling property. Mutation of the only cis-proline of the yPGK structure changes the refolding kinetics of the protein (43Osváth S. Gruebele M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), so we assayed the refolding of the P204H mutant of a histidine-tagged version of yPGK. Refolding of the HisPGK P204H Mutant—Fig. 4A shows the refolding kinetics of the HisPGK P204H mutant. A similar analysis was done than in the case of the wild-type protein. The best fit was obtained when n = 5 independent exponentials were used to describe the U ← ··· → I transition. A further increase in the number of the exponentials yielded unrealistic fit parameters similarly to the case of the yPGK. Fig. 4B indicates the residuals of the multiexponential fit. The an amplitudes and τn time constants of the fit were clearly different from the parameters obtained for the wild-type yPGK, but the scaling property remained valid. A similar analysis of the χ2 of a scaled landscape model fit was done for the HisPGK P204H as for the wild-type protein. The best χ2 was obtained with n = 5 hierarchic levels. Fig. 4C shows the residuals of the best fit with the scaled energy landscape model. The parameters of the best fit are summarized in Table 1. The χ2 obtained with the scaled landscape model (85.9·10–6) is in the same range as that of the multi-exponential fit (53.4·10–6), although it uses less than half as many independent fit parameters. Based on the above comparison of the refolding kinetics of the wild-type protein and the HisPGK P204H mutant, we can state that the transition from the unfolded into the intermediate state during the refolding of the yPGK is directed by a scaled energy landscape. This finding is further supported by earlier results of fast folding experiments that found stretched folding kinetics in several variants of yPGK in the 20 μs to 10-ms region (27Osváth S. Sabelko J.J. Gruebele M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 40Sabelko J.J. Millisecond and Submillisecond Folding Kinetics of Horse Apomyoglobin and Yeast Phosphoglycerate Kinase. University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL2000Google Scholar). ANS Binding during yPGK Refolding—To obtain information about the physical nature of the intermediate state (I), ANS binding experiments were performed. Fig. 5 shows the folding kinetics of the wild-type yPGK detected through the fluorescence of ANS added to the sample prior to initiating refolding. Accumulation of a transient state with high ANS binding affinity (high ANS fluorescence) was observed, which is the signature of a molten globule intermediate. Earlier experiments of Ptitsyn and co-workers (39Ptitsyn O.B. Pain R.H. Semisotnov G.V. Zerovnik E. Razgulyaev O.I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) have proved the presence of a molten globule intermediate in the refolding of yPGK. ANS fluorescence reached its maximum roughly 0.3–0.4 s after the mixing in their experiments while in our measurements only after 5 s. The difference can be explained by the different refolding conditions (0.4 m GuHCl and 0.15 m GuHCl for the earlier results and our experiments, respectively). The formation and decay of the molten globule state detected by ANS fluorescence (Fig. 5) coincides well with the tryptophan fluorescence detected refolding of the wild-type protein (Fig. 1). A fit with the hierarchic landscape model and the residuals of the fit are also shown in Fig. 5. The kinetic parameters of the fit are identical within experimental error to that obtained from tryptophan fluorescence (Table 1) we can thus conclude that the intermediate state (I) of our model is a molten globule. Hierarchic Landscape Versus Multi-exponential Models—Energy landscape models offer a unified view of protein folding that can interpret the diverse experimental findings. The physico-chemical environment of the protein in vitro or in vivo modulates the energy landscape that governs the dynamics of the molecule, but the underlying principles remain the same. If the energy landscape of the protein contains only a few deep energy minima, folding kinetics of the protein can be well described by simple mass action models that lead to multi-exponential kinetics. Since any kinetics can be decomposed into the sum of exponentials, there is no simple experimental way to distinguish between folding through a few discrete intermediate states and folding on a hierarchic landscape. Here we provide the strongest experimental evidence so far of a hierarchic structure in the folding energy landscape. In contrast to previous studies, we analyze our measurements without any a priori assumptions about the mechanism of the folding reaction, and we find that a hierarchic finite level model emerges. The model describes correctly both the tryptophan and the ANS fluorescence changes during the folding reaction. The observed kinetics can arise from discrete folding intermediates only if a coincidence happens: the amplitudes and time constants of the multi-exponential kinetics have to follow power law scaling. In this case, however, a mutation that changes the folding kinetics, changes one or more of the time constants and the amplitudes of the transitions between the intermediate states. This should break the accidental coincidence and should reveal the multiexponential character of the mechanism. Mutating the evolutionary conserved cis-proline of the structure changed the folding kinetics but did not reveal multi-exponential mechanism; on the contrary, the kinetics was well described by the hierarchic finite level model. Conclusions—We present, to our knowledge, the strongest test so far of the hierarchic folding landscape idea. Using a hierarchic landscape model, we describe the refolding kinetics of yPGK from 1 ms to the acquisition of the native structure (15 min) within experimental error. According to our HiFi model, the early phase of the yPGK folding proceeds on the scaled upper region of the energy landscape of the protein. A multitude of traps with different depth is organized in n = 5 levels giving rise to a large number of independent relaxation pathways with n = 5 different relaxation times. The fastest relaxation pathway has a time constant of τ1 = 2.4 ± 0.5 ms. Each level has λ = 8 ± 0.9-fold longer relaxation time than the level before it, and α/λ = 0.75 ± 0.17 times more protein molecules follow the pathway than that of the previous level. The hierarchically scaled landscape gives rise to stretched kinetics that extends up to several seconds. During this early phase, a molten globule intermediate is formed. The native structure is formed from the molten globule intermediate in a single cross-barrier folding step with a time constant of τ = 121 ± 11 s.

https://openalex.org/W1975607610,"RUNX1, or AML1, is a transcription factor that is the most frequent target for chromosomal gene translocations in acute leukemias. RUNX1 is essential for definitive hematopoiesis in embryos and profoundly influences adult steady-state hematopoiesis both positively and negatively. To investigate this wide range of normal activities and the pathological role of RUNX1, it is important to define the functions of different domains of the protein. RUNX1, RUNX2, and RUNX3 are highly conserved in their DNA binding runt homology domain and contain divergent sequences of unknown function N-terminal to this domain. Here we analyzed the role of the N-terminal sequence and the alpha-helix of the runt homology domain of Runx1 in DNA binding, transactivation, and megakaryocytopoiesis. Both the N terminus and the alpha-helix were found to reduce DNA binding of Runx1 and be essential for transactivation of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and Ialpha1 promoters by Runx1. The N terminus of Runx1, including the alpha-helix, was also required for transactivation of a Gal4 reporter when expressed as fusion proteins with a Gal4 DNA binding domain, and the N terminus alone was capable of stimulating transcription when fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. The N terminus and the alpha-helix, however, were not required for megakaryocyte development from embryonic stem cells differentiated in vitro. Thus, our findings define a second transactivation domain of Runx1 that is differentially required for activation of transcription of some Runx1-dependent promoters and megakaryocytopoiesis."

The crystal structure of sheep liver 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase shows that Tyr-191, Lys-260, Thr-262, Arg-287, and Arg-446 contribute a mixture of ionic and hydrogen bonding interactions to the 6-phosphate, and these interactions are likely to provide the majority of the binding energy for 6PG.

The pH dependence of kinetic parameters indicates a general acid-general base chemical mechanism (1Price N. Cook P.F. Arch. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11231-11238Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) studies suggest that Lys-183 and Glu-190 are likely the general base and the general acid, respectively. In this mechanism, the general base (Lys-183) is required to accept a proton from the 3-hydroxyl group of 6PG concomitant with hydride transfer from C-3 of 6PG to the coenzyme. Reduction of the nicotinamide ring is accompanied by rotation around the N-glycosidic bond such that the ring occupies the position formerly occupied by the 1-carboxylate of the substrate (5Cervellati C. Dallocchio F. Bergamini C.M. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2432-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The resulting 3-keto-6-phosphogluconate intermediate is decarboxylated to produce the enediol of Ru5P with the general base used to protonate the carboxyl oxygen. A general acid (Glu-190) is needed to facilitate the tautomerization of the enediol of Ru5P to the keto product (Fig. 1). In the E·6PG binary complex, the 6-phosphate of 6PG is surrounded by the following five active-site residues that are within hydrogen-bond distance: Tyr-191, Lys-260, Thr-262, Arg-287, and Arg-446 (6Adams J.M. Grant H.E. Gover S. Naylor C.E. Philips C. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 651-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment of 6PGDH shows that these five residues are completely conserved (Fig. 2), and Fig. 3 shows these residues in the protein environment. Notably, Lys-260 donates a hydrogen bond to the 6-phosphate from its backbone NH and also provides significant hydrophobic interaction to substrate via its side chain. Arginine 446 is from the C-terminal tail of the second subunit and together with Arg-287 balances the charge of the phosphate and may contribute most to anchoring the substrate. Mutations were made at Arg-447 in 6PGDH from Lactococcus lactis (7Tetaud E. Hanau S. Wells J.M. Page R.W.F. Adams J.M. Arkinson S. Barrett M.P. Biochem.

Interestingly, Arg-287 participates in a hydrogen-bond network through water 528 to Glu-190 and the 1-carboxyl of 6PG. It is suggested that this network is important in defining the bound conformation of 6PG (6Adams J.M. Grant H.E. Gover S. Naylor C.E. Philips C.

Initial velocity and isotope effects studies were carried out to characterize the mutant enzymes. Data are consistent with the hypothesis that these residues are important in providing the binding energy for the 6-phosphate of 6PG.

The next day, this culture was transferred into 2-10 liters of LB/Amp/Kan medium and was incubated at 25 °C for 8 h or until the A600 reached 0.6. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm to initiate expression. After 16 h of growth at 25 °C with shaking, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 30 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 4 volumes of Buffer A (50 mm triethanolamine, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5), sonicated on ice for 3 min (pulsing 30 s with 30 s of rest) using a MISONIX Sonicator® XL, and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was combined with 2-10 ml of Ni-NTA resin pre-equilibrated with Buffer A and stirred at 4 °C for 2 h. The mixture was then loaded onto a 25-ml column, and the column was washed with 5 volumes of Buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole. Dependent on the number of uses of the Ni-NTA resin prior to regeneration, the imidazole concentration will be higher for fresh resin, and lower once the resin has been used. As a result, a short gradient of 0.2-0.4 m was used for elution, rather than an isocratic elution at a fixed concentration of imidazole. Protein concentrations were measured for all fractions using the method of Bradford (9Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Fractions containing protein were pooled and applied to an ADP-agarose affinity column, which takes advantage of the NADP-binding site in the protein. Pooled fractions from the Ni-NTA column were applied to the ADP-agarose column directly, with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The column was then washed with 10 volumes of Buffer A, and protein was eluted with 150 mm pyrophosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Fractions were collected, and protein concentration was determined by reading the absorbance at 280 nm (ϵ = 62,160 m-1 cm-1 for His6-tagged 6PGDH). Fractions containing protein were again pooled and concentrated using an Amicon ultrafiltration apparatus with a PM-30 semipermeable membrane. SDS-PAGE was performed for wild type and all mutant enzymes to analyze the purity of the protein. The wild type and mutant proteins were purified in an identical manner, and all enzymes were stored at 4 °C in the same buffer used for elution from the ADP-agarose column. All mutant enzymes are stable and do not lose activity for more than 1 year. Synthesis of 3-d-6PG—3-deuterio-Glucose was converted to 3-deuterio-glucose 6-phosphate enzymatically by using hexokinase as described previously (10Hwang C.C. Berdis A.J. Karsten W.E. Cleland W.W. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12596-12602Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The extent of conversion to the product of the reaction was determined by end point assay using glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Upon completion of the reaction, the pH of the solution was adjusted to 4.5 to denature the enzymes in the mixture, and Amicon ultrafiltration was used to remove the enzymes. The resulting solution was treated with acid-washed and heat-activated charcoal, stirred for 1 h, and filtered to remove nucleotides, and then Dowex 50W-H+ resin was used to remove Mg2+. The solution, containing 3-d-glucose 6-phosphate, was oxidized with bromine to yield the final product 3-d-6PG, which was purified as described previously (5Cervellati C. Dallocchio F. Bergamini C.M. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2432-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Initial Velocity Studies—Initial velocity studies were performed using a Beckman DU640 UV/visible spectrophotometer. The appearance of NADPH (ϵ340 = 6.22 mm-1 cm-1) was monitored over time using 1-cm path length semi-micro quartz cuvettes. The temperature was maintained at 25 °C using a Beckman temperature controller. Initial velocity patterns were measured for all mutant and wild type enzymes in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, using variable concentrations of 6PG (0.5-5 Km) and NADP (0.5-5 Km) dependent on the mutant enzyme. pH Studies—Initial velocity data were obtained as a function of pH under conditions in which 6PG was varied, and NADP was fixed at a saturating level (40 Km). The pH was maintained using the following buffers at 100 mm concentrations: BisTris, 5-6.5; Hepes, 6.5-8.5; Ches, 8.5-9.5. Sufficient overlap was obtained upon changing buffers to eliminate buffer effects. The pH was determined before and after the initial velocity measurements. All enzymes are stable for at least 5 min at all pH values studied. Primary Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effects—The concentrations of 3-protio-6PG (3-h-6PG) and 3-d-6PG were determined enzymatically in triplicate by end point assay using wild type 6PGDH. The concentrations from three determinations were in agreement within 2%. Primary deuterium isotope effects with 3-d-6PG were obtained for all the mutant enzymes as well as for the wild type enzyme by direct comparison of initial velocities (11Parkin D.W. Cook P.F. Enzyme Mechanism from Isotope Effects. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 284-285Google Scholar). DV and D(V/KNADP) were obtained in triplicate by varying NADP at saturating levels of either 3-h-6PG or 3-d-6PG (20 Km), whereas DV and D(V/K6PG) were measured in triplicate varying 3-h-6PG or 3-d-6PG at saturating concentrations of NADP (40 Km). Solvent Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effects—Initial velocities for the wild type and mutant enzymes were measured in both H2O and D2O solutions. Substrates (NADP, 3-h-6PG, and 3-d-6PG) and buffers used in D2O solutions were first dissolved in a small volume of D2O and lyophilized overnight to remove exchangeable protons. The lyophilized powders were then dissolved in D2O to give the desired concentrations, and pD was adjusted using either DCl or NaOD. Primary solvent deuterium isotope effects were obtained by direct comparison of initial velocities in the pH/pD independent region. 13C-Kinetic Isotope Effects—These effects were measured using the natural abundance of 13C at C-1 of 6PG (12O'Leary M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 83-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Both high conversion (100% reaction, which represents 12C/13C in substrate) and low conversion samples were used to measure the 12C/13C isotope ratios in the CO2 produced from the reaction of 3-h-6PG or 3-d-6PG. From these ratios, the 13C-kinetic isotope effect was calculated (13Hermes J.D. Roeske C.A. O'Leary M.H. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5106-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). For high conversion samples, in 40 ml of H2O or D2O, the reaction mixtures contained 2 mm 3-h-6PG or 3-d-6PG, 0.5 mm NADP, and 10 mm oxidized glutathione. The low conversion reactions contain 6.5 mm 3-h-6PG or 3-d-6PG for the enzymes that have a K6PG close to that of the wild type 6PGDH (28 μm), or 15 mm, if K6PG was higher. The NADP concentration was 0.25 mm for enzymes with a KNADP about 2 μm or 1 mm if KNADP was higher (greater than 20 μm). All low conversion samples contained 5 mm oxidized glutathione in a final volume of 40 ml. The pH(D) of the reaction solutions was titrated to 7.6, followed by sparging with CO2-free nitrogen overnight. Before starting the reactions, aliquots were withdrawn to determine the initial concentrations of 6PG by end point assay in triplicate. Then the reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 units of 6PGDH and 100 units of glutathione reductase to recycle NADP for both high and low conversion samples. The high conversion samples were allowed to proceed for more than 16 h, and end point assays were used to confirm the completion of the reaction. For the low conversion samples, extents of reaction were monitored by end point, assaying the remaining 6PG. Reactions were quenched when 50 μmol of CO2 were produced. For both high and low conversion samples, 0.2 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid was added to quench the reactions, and the generated CO2 was isolated by vacuum distillation (14Weiss P. M. Cook P.F. Enzyme Mechanism from Isotope Effects. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 291-311Google Scholar). Aliquots of the samples were withdrawn after the CO2 isolation and incubated at pH 8 overnight. The next day, end point assays were performed in triplicate to determine the exact extent of the low conversion reactions. Isotopic composition of the CO2 was measured on a Finnigan Delta E isotoperatio mass spectrometer in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Engel, Department of Geophysics, University of Oklahoma. All ratios were corrected for 17O according to Craig (15Craig N. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta. 1957; 12: 133-149Crossref Scopus (3185) Google Scholar). Nomenclature—Isotope effects are expressed using the nomenclature developed by Northrop (19Northrop D.B. Cleland W.W. O'Leary M.H. Northrop D.B. Isotope Effects on Enzyme-catalyzed Reactions. University Park Press, Baltimore1977: 122Google Scholar) and Cook and Cleland (20Cook P.F. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1790-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Deuterium, 13C, and solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects are written with a leading superscript D, 13, or D2O, e.g. a primary deuterium isotope effect on V/K is written D(V/K). Multiple isotope effects are written with a leading superscript to depict the isotope varied, and a following subscript to depict the fixed isotope, e.g. a solvent deuterium isotope effect measured with deuterated 6PG would be written D2O(V/K)D. Data Processing—Double-reciprocal plots were used to analyze the data, and all plots and replots were linear. Data were fitted using the appropriate rate equations and programs developed by Cleland (16Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). Data for substrate saturation curves obtained at a fixed concentration of the second substrate were fitted using Equation 1.v=VAKa+A(Eq. 1) Initial velocity patterns were fitted using Equation 2.v=VABKiaKb+KaB+KbA+AB(Eq. 2) Deuterium kinetic isotope effect data in H2O and D2O were fitted using Equation 3.v=VAKa(1+FiEV/K)+A(1+FiEV)(Eq. 3) In Equations 1 and 2, v is the initial velocity; V is the maximum velocity; A and B are reactant concentrations; Ka and Kb are the Michaelis constants for NADP and 6PG, respectively; and Kia is the dissociation constant for NADP. In Equation 3, Fi is the fraction of deuterium label in the substrate or solvent, and EV and EV/K are the isotope effects -1 on V and V/K. The pH dependence of V and V/K were fitted using Equation 4,logy=logC1+H/K1+K2/H(Eq. 4) in which y is V or V/K; C is the pH-independent value of y; H is the hydrogen ion concentration; and K1 and K2 are the acid dissociation constants for enzyme or substrate groups important in a given protonation state for optimal binding and/or catalysis. Calculation of 13C-kinetic isotope effects was performed according to Equation 5,13(V/K)=log(1-f)log(1-f(Rp/R∞))(Eq. 5) where f is the fraction of completion of the reaction, and Rp and R∞ are the 12C/13C isotopic ratios for CO2 at partial and complete conversion, respectively. Isotope ratios, given as δ13C, were calculated from Equation 6,δ(13C)=RsmpRstd-1×103(Eq. 6) where Rsmp and Rstd are 12C/13C isotopic ratios for sample and standard, respectively. The standard for CO2 was calibrated from Pee Dee Belemnite with a 12C/13C of 0.0112372 (15Craig N. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta. 1957; 12: 133-149Crossref Scopus (3185) Google Scholar). Spectral Properties of Mutant Enzymes—There are 16 tryptophan residues in 6PGDH spread throughout the protein structure. Identical tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra were obtained for all mutant and wild type enzymes, upon excitation at 298 nm (data not shown), indicating that the microenvironment of tryptophan residues of the proteins is the same for all enzymes. As a result, there are no major changes in the overall structure of the enzyme resulting from the mutation. Changes are restricted to the local area within the active site. Kinetic Parameters of the Mutant Enzymes—Initial velocity patterns were obtained by measuring the initial rate at pH 7.5 using variable concentrations of 6PG (0.5-5 Km) and NADP (0.5-5 Km) dependent on the mutant enzymes. Data are summarized in Table 2.TABLE 2Summary of the kinetic parameters for 6PGDH wild type and mutant enzymes Values are ± S.E.WTY191AK260AT262AR287AR446AV/Et (s—1)9.4 ± 0.411.0 ± 0.40.43 ± 0.053.1 ± 0.30.015 ± 0.0010.03 ± 0.01Fold decrease223627303KNADP (μm)5 ± 114 ± 216 ± 34.2 ± 0.573 ± 1064 ± 6Fold increase2.83.21513K6PG (μm)28 ± 41,040 ± 60150 ± 824 ± 123000 ± 20003,400 ± 400Fold increase375.40.9814120V/K6PGEt (m—1 s—1)3.4 × 1051.1 × 1042.8 × 1031.3 × 1050.69.2Fold decrease311212.65.7 × 1053.7 × 104ΔG0 (kcal mol—1)aValues are calculated from K6PG, using ΔG0 = —RTlnK6PG—6.2—4.1—5.2—6.3—2.2—3.4ΔΔG0 (kcal mol—1)aValues are calculated from K6PG, using ΔG0 = —RTlnK6PG2.11.04.02.8a Values are calculated from K6PG, using ΔG0 = —RTlnK6PG Open table in a new tab KNADP increased for all but Thr-262 mutation, which showed no change compared with that of wild type enzyme. The increase in KNADP for Y191A and K260A is about 3-fold, whereas more than an order of magnitude increase is observed for R287A and R446A mutant enzymes. Data suggest that changes in the 6PG-binding site somehow affect the binding of NADP, i.e. there is a linkage between the two sites. In comparison, the value of V/K6PGEt for the R287A and R446A mutant enzymes is decreased 104-105-fold, and V/Et is decreased by at least 2 orders of magnitude with respect to the wild type enzyme. Data indicate that elimination of either of the arginine residues dramatically impairs enzyme activity. On the other hand, V/K6PGEt is decreased 30- and 120-fold, respectively, compared with the wild type enzyme, for Y191A and K260A mutant enzymes. Changes in V/Et are smaller with no change in the case of Y191A and a 20-fold change in the case of K260A. The T262A mutant enzyme exhibits a 3-fold change in V/Et and V/K6PGEt, reflecting the 3-fold change in the former. Kinetic Primary Deuterium Isotope Effects—The kinetic deuterium isotope effects on V and V/K6PG were measured at saturating NADP (40 Km) (Table 3). The isotope effects on both kinetic parameters are small in all cases, and within error equal to one another, consistent with the proposed rapid equilibrium random kinetic mechanism (1Price N. Cook P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Isotope effects on R287A and R446A were not measured because of the very low activity.TABLE 3Summary of isotope effects for 6PGDH wild type and mutant enzymes Values are ± S.E.WTY191AK260AT262ADV1.9 ± 0.1aData are from Ref. 101.06 ± 0.021.24 ± 0.091.25 ± 0.07D(V/K6PG)1.9 ± 0.1aData are from Ref. 101.05 ± 0.021.48 ± 0.231.19 ± 0.1013(V/K6PG)H1.00281.02691.03971.0325(0.0007)bValues in parentheses are standard errors for the 13C-kinetic isotope effects(0.0005)(0.0007)(0.0005)13(V/K6PG)D1.0017NDcND indicates not determined1.02901.030(0.0005)(0.0007)(0.001)13(V/K6PG)D2O1.00001.0116ND1.02060.0001(0.0005)(0.0003)D2OVH2.10 ± 0.051.58 ± 0.061.22 ± 0.041.15 ± 0.04D2O(V/K6PG)H1.9 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.11.25 ± 0.090.76 ± 0.06D2O(V)DND1.22 ± 0.101.29 ± 0.04D2O(V/K6PG)D2.28 ± 0.05ND0.94 ± 0.100.77 ± 0.04pKa (V)dpKa values are from the VpH profile6.40 ± 0.04eData are from Li and Cook (L.

Equal isotope effects, within error, on V and V/K6PG were obtained for the wild type and all mutant enzymes, with the exception of the T262A mutant enzyme. For all three mutant enzymes, the isotope effects are smaller than those observed for the wild type protein. Multiple primary deuterium/solvent deuterium isotope effects were measured for K260A and T262A mutant enzymes at saturating level NADP (40 Km) (Table 3). For the K260A mutant enzyme D2OVD, within error, is equal to D2OVH, whereas D2O(V/K)D is slightly smaller than D2O(V/K)H. In the case of T262A mutation, D2OVD is within error equal to DV, and inverse solvent isotope effects are obtained for D2O(V/K)D and D2O(V/K)H. 13C-Kinetic Isotope Effects"
https://openalex.org/W2039386069,"The tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) is a degenerate 34-amino acid repeating motif that forms a repeating helix-turn-helix structure and is a well characterized mediator of protein-protein interactions. Recently, a biophysical investigation on one naturally occurring TPR protein, Tom70, found that the mitochondrial receptor displayed an unusual three-state unfolding pathway, distinct from the two-state model usually displayed by TPR proteins. To investigate this unusual behavior, we undertook a tryptophan-scanning analysis of Tom70, where both native and engineered tryptophan residues are used as fluorescent reporters to monitor the range of local and global unfolding events that comprise the unfolding pathway of Tom70. Specifically, seven Tom70 variants were constructed, each with a single tryptophan residue in each of the seven TPR repeats of Tom70. By combining equilibrium and kinetic fluorescent unfolding assays, with circular dichroism experiments, our study reveals that the unusual folding pathway of Tom70 is a consequence of the unfolding of two separate, autonomous TPR arrays, with the less stable region appearing to account for the low structural stability of Tom70. The tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) is a degenerate 34-amino acid repeating motif that forms a repeating helix-turn-helix structure and is a well characterized mediator of protein-protein interactions.

Since it was first identified in 1990 (1Sikorski R.S. Boguski M.S. Goebl M. Hieter P. Cell. 1990; 60: 307-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) 5The abbreviations used are: TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; TOM, translocase of outer membrane. motifs have been found in over 300 different proteins (2Blatch G.L. Lassle M. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 3D'Andrea L.D. Regan L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 655-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Approximately 20 structures of proteins containing TPR motifs have been solved, revealing the motif to consist of a 34-amino acid-long pair of antiparallel α-helices, linked by a short loop region (4Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). TPRs are often further arranged into large superhelical arrays of between 3 and 20 repeats that provide a contiguous surface by which the repeats can mediate protein-protein interactions. Investigations into the biophysical characteristics of TPR motifs have focused on the properties of artificial motifs constructed from alignment-derived consensus sequences (5Main E.R. Jackson S.E. Regan L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Such studies have also been performed on other helical repeating motifs, such as ankyrin (6Mosavi L.K. Minor Jr., D.L. Peng Z.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16029-16034Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and leucine-rich repeats (7Stumpp M.T. Forrer P. Binz H.K. Pluckthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 471-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These studies have revealed that each separate TPR is intrinsically stable as a result of favorable hydrogen bonding between conserved residues, with stability increasing as more repeats are added to an array. Thermal midpoints of unfolding have been reported as high as 83 °C for a three times artificial TPR repeat (8Main E.R. Xiong Y. Cocco M.J. D'Andrea L. Regan L. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This comparative stability and the apparent ease with which these repeating sequences evolve (9Makarova K.S. Wolf Y.I. Mekhedov S.L. Mirkin B.G. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4626-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have meant that TPRs modulate the function of a diverse array of proteins. One such protein, Tom70, is a receptor of the TOM complex, an oligomeric translocase located on the outer membrane of mitochondria. The function of Tom70 is modulated by its complement of at least seven TPR motifs, through which it recognizes Hsp70-bound import-competent mitochondrial proteins with internal noncanonical targeting sequences. Upon its recognition of internal targeting sequences, Tom70 helps facilitate the import of mitochondrial protein through the general import pore of the TOM complex (10Hachiya N. Mihara K. Suda K. Horst M. Schatz G. Lithgow T. Nature. 1995; 376: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The Tom70 N-terminal TPR motifs (TPRs 1 and 2) are thought to bear a structural and mechanical similarity to that of Hop, a co-chaperone that uses its own TPR motifs to coordinate with the conserved C-terminal aspartate of Hsp70 (11Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 12Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). With this region acting as a clamp, Tom70 recognizes the mitochondrial precursor payload of Hsp70 via its C-terminal TPR repeats (residues 397–617), (13Brix J. Rudiger S. Bukau B. Schneider-Mergener J. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16522-16530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 14Brix J. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The roles of any putative TPRs in the linker region between these two arrays remain unknown, but it is possible that they contain additional binding sites for both mitochondrial precursors and other subunits of the TOM complex. Whereas previous biophysical investigations of TPR repeats have focused on idealized artificially created TPR arrays (5Main E.R. Jackson S.E. Regan L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), Tom70 represents an ideal naturally occurring model from which physiological data can be derived. As a member of the TPR superfamily, Tom70 displays several unusual characteristics that warrant further investigation. Bioinformatic analysis of the primary structure of Tom70 yields suggests that its TPR repeats are organized in a 2:5 arrangement (15Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar), an unusual composition, considering most other TPR-containing proteins have just a single array. Furthermore, TPR arrays generally utilize a two-state model of folding and unfolding (8Main E.R. Xiong Y. Cocco M.J. D'Andrea L. Regan L. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar); however, it was recently demonstrated that Tom70 unfolds via a three-state pathway (N → I → U) (16Beddoe T. Bushell S.R. Perugini M.A. Lithgow T. Mulhern T.D. Bottomley S.P. Rossjohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46448-46454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The presence of an unfolding intermediate suggested that each of the two known TPR arrays of Tom70 undergo a separate unfolding event as the protein is denatured. The same study showed that Tom70 does not display the same stability that was seen in their engineered counterparts, with thermal unfolding midpoints of 41 and 53 °C. In order to explain some of these unusual biophysical properties of Tom70 as well as to further characterize the receptor as a naturally occurring TPR protein, we employed a tryptophan scanning approach to identify what parts of the protein were unfolding. In this study, single tryptophan residues were engineered into a variant of Tom70 lacking its natural tryptophan residue (Trp124). We exploited the fact that tryptophan emissions vary in wavelength in proportion to their solvent exposure. Therefore, by monitoring the emission spectra of these engineered Trp-substituted proteins, we were able to derive site-specific data on the conformational changes involved in Tom70 unfolding (17Bottomley S.P. Popplewell A.G. Scawen M. Wan T. Sutton B.J. Gore M.G. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Clark P.L. Liu Z.P. Zhang J. Gierasch L.M.

This approach represents an ideal spatial and temporal tool for defining the range of localized unfolding events that comprise the Tom70 unfolding pathway. Protein Expression and Purification—All Tom70 proteins were recombinantly expressed with a C-terminal His tag and purified via Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. The eluent was concentrated via anion exchange chromatography using a Q-Sepharose column. The protein underwent final purification and buffer exchange using a calibrated Superdex 200 16/60 column (GE Health Sciences). All proteins were stored in a buffer comprising 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 35,250 m–1 cm–1. In each case, 4–6 mg of protein was yielded per liter of media. Site-directed Mutagenesis—All site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Potential variants were transformed into XL10 Escherichia coli cloning strain and sequenced at the Monash Micromon DNA sequencing facility. Plasmids from successful variants were transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli expression strain and purified as described above. Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroic spectra were measured on a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter using a temperature-controlled cuvette at 25 °C. Far-UV spectra from 190 to 250 nm were collected with 5-s/point signal averaging. θ222 measurements were made with the signal averaged over 15 s. The concentration of the protein was 0.15 mg/ml (2 μm) with a 0.1-cm path length. For a comparison of unfolding transitions collected at different protein concentrations, the data were normalized by calculating the fraction of unfolded protein as described previously (21Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 311-330Google Scholar). All unfolding data were fitted to either a two- or three-state unfolding model as described previously (22Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar, 23Barrick D. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3790-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Spectrofluorometry Methods—Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorimeter using a temperature-controlled cuvette at 25 °C in a 1-cm path length quartz cell. Excitation and emission slits were set at 5.0 nm for all spectra, and a scan speed of 10 nm/min was used. Unless otherwise stated, an excitation wavelength of 295 nm was used for all experiments. Kinetic Experiments—All kinetic experiments were performed using an Applied Photophysics SF.18MV stopped-flow apparatus. Unfolding was monitored by observing changes in fluorescence intensity (λex = 290 nm) at wavelengths of >330 nm using a cut-off filter placed between the reaction cell and the detector. 15 μm protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA was rapidly mixed with similarly buffered 8 m urea. All experiments were repeated six times, with representative traces fitted to a one-phase experiential decay curve using Prism Graphpad. Generation and Biophysical Analysis of Tom70W124F—Wild-type Tom70 contains a single tryptophan residue at residue 124. This would place the residue at position 26 in TPR 1, as determined by Pfam. Fig. 1 shows an alignment of the seven known TPR motifs of Tom70 as well as a previously derived consensus sequence (2Blatch G.L. Lassle M. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). The alignment shows that the tryptophan of the wild type is at a position usually occupied by leucine, lysine, or glutamate. Using site-directed mutagenesis, Trp124 was conservatively mutated to a phenylalanine, ensuring that any emission signal detected when the protein is excited at 295 nm will arise from a single tryptophan introduced into each TPR motif. To ensure that the folding of Tom70W124F was not adversely affected by the mutation, a series of spectroscopic and spectrofluorometric experiments were performed to ensure that the protein had similar folding properties and stability to the wild type. Far-UV CD spectra showed that Tom70W124F had a double minimum at 222 and 208 nm, indicating that the protein's highly helical secondary structure had not been disrupted. Thermal denaturation experiments showed that the protein had thermal stability identical to that of wild type, with midpoints of 41 and 53 °C. Chemical denaturation was also monitored spectrofluorimetrically by measuring the shift in emission wavelength when the tyrosine residues of Tom70 were excited at 280 nm. The midpoint of unfolding was 1.1 m urea, identical to that seen in the wild type (16Beddoe T. Bushell S.R. Perugini M.A. Lithgow T. Mulhern T.D. Bottomley S.P. Rossjohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46448-46454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that the W124F substitution had not noticeably altered the folding or stability of Tom70. Generation of Trp-substituted Tom70 Variants—We took a consensus-based approach in determining where best to introduce tryptophan residues in each TPR motif. According to a published consensus sequence, shown in Fig. 1B, position 4 of a TPR motif is usually a tryptophan, a tyrosine, or a leucine (2Blatch G.L. Lassle M. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). The alignment of the Tom70 TPR motifs, in the same figure, shows that this consensus holds true in this case. With a view to maintaining the structural integrity of the protein, we reasoned that a conservative substitution for tryptophan in position 4 of each TPR motif would provide consistency in our results as well as conserve the properties of the TPR motif, making it less likely that the folding and structure of the motif would be perturbed. With Tom70W124F as a template, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to mutate position 4 of each TPR motif (with the exception of TPRs 2 and 5) to a tryptophan. In the case of TPR 2, a Y135W mutation would have placed a tryptophan in close proximity to the former position of the wild-type tryptophan. To ensure a separate reading for TPR 2, the tryptophan was introduced at a position similar to that of the wild-type tryptophan in TPR 1. In the case of TPR 5, the presence of two proline residues in the first four residues would suggest that this TPR motif is highly atypical, so a nearby phenylalanine residue (Phe470; position 6 of the putative motif) was changed. The final series of tryptophan-substituted variants generated from the Tom70W124F template is as follows: TPR 2, S155W; TPR 3, Y400W; TPR4, Y434W; TPR 5, F470W; TPR 6, L508W; TPR 7, K545W. In addition, we used wild-type Tom70 to analyze the movements in the region around TPR 1. Trp-substituted Tom70 Variants Display the Same Folding Properties as Wild Type—Tom70 Trp-containing variants were all purified to homogeneity, with protein yield in all cases being 3–6 mg/liter of media (comparable with wild type). All proteins demonstrated the same elution profile when purified with a Superdex 200 size exclusion column (V e ≈ 72 ml). This would initially indicate that each variant is folded similarly to that of the wild type with no change to the protein's hydrodynamic radius. It has been previously demonstrated that the comparatively late elution of Tom70 from the Superdex 200, for a 70-kDa protein, is due to its high asymmetry and not homodimerization (16Beddoe T. Bushell S.R. Perugini M.A. Lithgow T. Mulhern T.D. Bottomley S.P. Rossjohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46448-46454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To further confirm the correct folding of each variant, the far-UV CD spectra were determined for each protein. All spectra were identical to the wild type spectra, with double minima at 222 and 208 nm with similar mean residue ellipticity, indicating that the tryptophan substitutions do not alter the secondary structure. Thermal melts of each protein, monitored at 222 nm via far-UV CD, demonstrated that there is no appreciable change in each variant's stability, with variants showing midpoints of unfolding at ∼41 and 53 °C, as was also observed with the wild-type protein (data not shown). When Tom70 was denatured with urea, the resultant unfolding curve (as monitored at 222 nm by CD) displayed a three-state unfolding pathway (16Beddoe T. Bushell S.R. Perugini M.A. Lithgow T. Mulhern T.D. Bottomley S.P. Rossjohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46448-46454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To confirm that the presence of the engineered tryptophan residues does not perturb this behavior, each variant was subjected to similar unfolding assays. The overlaid unfolding curves can be seen in Fig. 2. The curves were fitted to a three-state unfolding model with the curve parameters comprising Table 1. All of the proteins displayed unfolding midpoints at ∼1 and 3.3 m urea. The concordance of all of the equilibrium CD data indicates that all of the variants unfold via a similar pathway and that the tryptophan substitutions did not significantly affect the protein's native fold or the stability of either the native or intermediate conformations. Accordingly, conclusions drawn from the folding of wild-type Tom70 will also hold for the Trp-substituted variants.TABLE 1Three-state unfolding parameters for Tom70 and Trp-substituted variantsTPRMutationΔGF→IDF→I50&percent;ΔGI→UDI→U50&percent;kcal/molmkcal/molm1Wild type2.05 ± 0.071.105.50 ± 0.063.162S155W2.19 ± 0.081.175.62 ± 0.083.233Y400W2.33 ± 0.061.255.34 ± 0.073.074F434W2.51 ± 0.081.355.39 ± 0.083.105F470W2.17 ± 0.031.165.31 ± 0.033.056L508W2.16 ± 0.141.165.57 ± 0.143.207K545W2.19 ± 0.031.185.51 ± 0.033.17 Open table in a new tab Identification of a Separately Folded Region—When excited at 295 nm, tryptophan emits fluorescent radiation at a wavelength between 300 and 400 nm. The wavelength of maximum emission is proportional to the solvent exposure of the particular residue, with wavelength maxima >350 nm, indicating that the residue is fully exposed. Thus, tryptophan represents an ideal marker in resolving which parts of a protein are unfolding (17Bottomley S.P. Popplewell A.G. Scawen M. Wan T. Sutton B.J. Gore M.G. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Clark P.L. Liu Z.P. Zhang J. Gierasch L.M.

When Tom70 unfolding is monitored by measuring the shift in emission wavelength, an unfolding midpoint of 2.8 m urea is observed (16Beddoe T. Bushell S.R. Perugini M.A. Lithgow T. Mulhern T.D. Bottomley S.P. Rossjohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46448-46454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This midpoint does not correspond to the unfolding events observed when unfolding is monitored by far-UV CD, with both the N → I and I → U transitions having midpoints of 1.05 and 3.2 m urea, respectively. It was therefore apparent that structural changes associated with these transitions were occurring elsewhere within the protein. The local changes in tertiary structure at each TPR motif were monitored by measuring the decay of emission signal at the λmax of each variant. The resultant unfolding curves of each protein are shown in Fig. 3, with thermodynamic parameters detailed in Table 2. Unlike the two transitions observed with far-UV CD, the unfolding of each single tryptophan protein occurs in a single cooperative transition, indicative of a two-state unfolding event. The curves show two distinct midpoint groupings. The less stable group comprises the variants with mutated tryptophans in TPRs 4–6, with unfolding midpoints centered around 1.7, 1.6, and 1.1 m urea, respectively. The remaining variants have midpoints that cluster around 3.0 m urea.TABLE 2Results from Figs. 3 and 4 were fitted to a two-state unfolding analysis as described previouslyTPRMutationλmaxΔGF→UmF→UDF→U50&percent;knmkcal/molkcal/mol/mms-11Wild type3333.68 ± 0.31.31 ± 0.072.833.64 ± 2.02S155W3333.05 ± 0.21.02 ± 0.163.02.097 ± 0.223Y400W3425.22 ± 0.21.66 ± 0.093.110.87 ± 0.644F4a34W3381.83 ± 0.11.14 ± 0.151.6252.9 ± 44.245F470W3301.27 ± 0.20.85 ± 0.151.554.59 ± 2.746L508W3401.47 ± 0.21.50 ± 0.21.06.26 ± 0.827K545W3302.10 ± 0.20.81 ± 0.12.65.27 ± 0.90 Open table in a new tab Kinetic Unfolding Experiments Confirm Metastable Region—In addition to the equilibrium unfolding experiments performed above, the unfolding kinetics of each protein was also determined using stopped flow. In these experiments, folded Tom70 was mixed with 8 m urea, and the change in fluorescence intensity was observed. All variants displayed rapid unfolding with unfolding complete within 1 s for all of the proteins. Fig. 4 shows the stopped-flow-determined unfolding curve for wild-type Tom70 as well as the curves for the variants representing TPR 2 and TPR 4, the slowest and quickest unfolding variants, respectively. All of the curves could be adequately described by a single exponential function; the rate constants for unfolding, kNU, for all proteins are shown in Table 2. The unfolding of the TPR 4 variant was extremely rapid, with a rate of 253 s–1, followed closely by TPR 5, with a rate of 55 s–1. The slowest rate was observed for TPR 2, with a rate of 2.1 s–1, correlating well with its position as the most stable variant as determined in the fluorescent studies. The clustering of the unfolding rate constants and the equilibrium unfolding midpoints into two groups correlates with our hypothesis that the region encompassing TPRs 4–6 is a distinctly less stable region than the rest of the protein. In both cases, the region around TPR 2 was found to be among the most stable. It has previously been hypothesized that the Tom70 complement of TPR repeats are arranged in autonomously folding arrays (16Beddoe T. Bushell S.R. Perugini M.A. Lithgow T. Mulhern T.D. Bottomley S.P. Rossjohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46448-46454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The far-UV CD spectrum of Tom70 indicates that it is highly α-helical, which would suggest that the bulk of its structure lies within these TPR motifs. When urea-induced changes in secondary structure are monitored via CD, Tom70 demonstrates a three state unfolding curve (N → I → U). Given that it has previously been shown that TPR motifs usually unfold via a two-state pathway, it suggests that this intermediate represented a separately folded array that displayed less stability than other such arrays within the protein. By employing tryptophan-scanning mutagenesis, we have been able to show that the unfolding midpoints of each of the Tom70 TPR motifs cluster into two distinct groups, reflecting the differential unfolding of distinct parts of the protein. This is surprising, since most TPR proteins only contain their motifs in a single array. A notable exception to this trend is the peroxisomal receptor PEX5, whose TPR arrays appear to be arranged in a clamp type arrangement (24Gatto Jr., G.J. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Berg J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Whereas this protein has a solved crystal structure, there is no biophysical study to indicate whether it unfolds through a three-state pathway. Under the current model of the mode of action of Tom70, the receptor clamps the chaperone component of the Hsp70-precursor complex via TPR 1 and TPR 2, with recognition of the precursor's targeting sequences facilitated by the C-terminal TPRs (11Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). It has been shown that a 25-kDa proteolytically stable fragment encompassing residues 247–460 (the area preceding and including TPR 4) is able to bind targeting sequences at a similar capacity to that of the full-length protein (25Brix J. Ziegler G.A. Dietmeier K. Schneider-Mergener J. Schulz G.E. Pfanner N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), indicating that this region might represent the receptor's major binding site. Given the highly degenerate nature of internal mitochondrial targeting sequences, one might expect this region to display a high degree of plasticity in order to facilitate such binding. The similarly low stability of TPRs 5 and 6 might represent a mechanical means of improving specificity or a means of facilitating precursor transfer to downstream components of the TOM complex. Conversely, the region around TPR 2 appears to be the most stable, as reflected by the high equilibrium unfolding midpoint (3.0 m) and the low kNU when unfolding is observed via stopped flow experiments. This region is thought to constitute a binding site for the highly conserved C-terminal region of Hsp70 (11Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). This stability would therefore be crucial in the specificity of this binding event. The comparative stability of both TPR 3 and TPR 7 could serve to constrain the receptor's instability to just TPR 4–6. Such a mechanism is not without precedent; stabilizing helices have been observed and employed in a number of helical repeat systems (8Main E.R. Xiong Y. Cocco M.J. D'Andrea L. Regan L. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The unfolding kinetics show general agreement with the clustering of midpoints seen in fluorometric experiments and correlates well with the observed relative order of TPR stability. The values for kNU in the variants representing TPRs 4–6 were generally lower than that observed in other repeats. The reason for the variance in the order of stability is probably due to the slight effects a mutation might have on the TPR stability being amplified by the high speeds at which Tom70 unfolds in such an experiment. The variance in stabilities seen in even adjacent TPR motifs seems to indicate that their folding in Tom70 is noncooperative. Furthermore, this variance would suggest that it is not always stability that is the chief advantage that the motif confers upon the protein. In the case of Tom70, the stability varies in accordance with the role the motif plays in the protein's function. The Tom70 TPR motifs display both stability in the recognition of Hsp70 and flexibility in the binding to mitochondrial targeting sequences. It would therefore appear that adaptability is a key asset of the TPR in its role in mediating protein-protein interactions. In this regard, it is of interest to examine how TPRs evolved in systems that involve cross-talk between two different organisms. For example, it has recently been shown that proteins with primitive TPR motifs are secreted by the pathogen Legionella pneumophila to interfere with the host macrophage cell's stress response effectors (26Cirillo S.L. Lum J. Cirillo J.D. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1345-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For such a system to be effective, the adaptors would presumably need to display a balance of stability and flexibility to carry out its role. Given the bacterial origins of the mitochondrion, the evolution of a complex system for maintaining the integrity of the organelle in the face of the transfer of its genes to the nuclear genome could be achieved comparatively quickly (through gene duplication) by using a TPR system. As such, the mitochondrial import system contains two major receptors that utilize TPRs in performing their respective roles (27Perry A.J. Hulett J.M. Likic V.A. Lithgow T. Gooley P.R. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 221-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 28Haucke V. Horst M. Schatz G. Lithgow T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of using mutated tryptophan residues in observing the myriad of localized unfolding events that comprise a protein's folding pathway. Since the bonds that stabilize TPR-proteins, such as Tom70, are extremely localized when compared with globular proteins, the tryptophan-scanning technique is particularly effective when discerning the pathways of repeat proteins. It has allowed us to identify two regions of Tom70 that fold autonomously (a stable Hsp70-binding region and a less stable region that recognizes mitochondrial targeting sequences) and form a model that explains how their respective stabilities are vital to function."
