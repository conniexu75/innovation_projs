For example, Kappers et al.1 state that “different cytoarchitectonic regions, such as are demonstrable in the various areas of the cerebral cortex, are not present in the cortical portion of the cerebellum”. This absence of localization of histological structure has been a hindrance to research in view of the known localization of function in different regions of the cerebellum."

https://openalex.org/W2016236500,"THE mechanisms of the primary stage of radiobiological damage involve three major problems. First, the destructive effect of relatively small doses of radiation. This cannot be explained on a purely statistical basis, so long as most components in the living cell exhibit a comparable reactivity towards the primary radicals formed by radiation. Secondly, the oxygen effect which undoubtedly increases the radiosensitivity of the living system. This effect could possibly be explained by inhibiting the recombination of organic radicals by the formation of peroxides. Thirdly, the action of radiation protecting agents which can scarcely be explained quantitatively. These reagents are generally considered either as scavengers of the primary free radicals or as hydrogen atom donors in a repair mechanism. Recent experiments on the effect of metal ions on the radiolytic behaviour of organic solutes may throw some light on these problems."

https://openalex.org/W2071813636,"THE ‘Castrix’ molecule (2-chloro-4-methyl-6-dimethylaminopyrimidin)1,2 resembles the vitamin B6-antagonist toxopyrimidin. In rodents poisoned with this rodenticide the symptoms are an initial depression followed in 40–60 min by a ‘search and flight reaction’, spastieity, and tonicclonic seizures, often with tongue-bite. Sound and touch aggravate the severity of the seizures, which may end with death from respiratory failure, dependent on dosage. Survival for more than 5 h usually results in total recovery within 24 h. As these symptoms are almost identical with those seen after administration of certain carbonyl trapping agents and vitamin B6-antagonists3–6 we tried vitamin B6 as an antidote."

https://openalex.org/W2049332764,"IT is well known that few non-vascularized homologous tissues survive in mice after subcutaneous transplantation, because these tissues do not sensitize the host organism against themselves. If, however, the host organism becomes sensitized by a second transplant, destruction of the first, non-vascularized tissue transplant will occur1. On the other hand, homologous tissue also survives in mice, if it is brought into a so-called diffusion chamber or implantation chamber2–5."
https://openalex.org/W2066324898,"IN 1959 Kelus et al.1 were able to demonstrate H-antigen in HeLa cells by means of mixed agglutination using extracts from Ulex europens as anti-H agglutinin. At that time in our laboratory the species-specific antigenicity of cultivated mammalian cells was being investigated by means of a haemagglutination test which involved guinea pig anti-cell sera and erythrocytes of various species2. The species-specificity of this test was established, partly by excluding blood-group specific reaction. This finding was supported by the work of Hogman3, who verified that human cell cultures lose blood group A and B antigens in the early stages of cultivation. Apparently, this does not occur with regard to H-antigen according to the observation of Kelus et al. mentioned here. Yet, H-specific reaction was found not to interfere in species-specific haemagglutination. This conclusion was reached indirectly by demonstrating species-specific cell haemagglutinogens and erythrocyte receptors to be proteins in contrast to the carbohydrate nature of blood-group substances4. A more direct examination of this problem was made possible when Bombay blood erythrocytes (lacking H-antigen) and Bombay blood serum (containing anti-H isoagglutinins) became available to us. Various experiments were carried out."

https://openalex.org/W2093717939,"WORK on the mesial surface of the cortex has produced conflicting observations on the part played by the cingulate gyrus in behaviour. Smith1,2, Ward3 and Glees et al.4 reported that cingulectomy produces profound changes in the social and emotional behaviour of monkeys and similar observations have been made by Kennard5 on the cat. In contrast, Pribram and Fulton6 and Mirsky et al.7 have observed little or no permanent effect following bilateral ablation in the monkey and this conclusion has been supported by investigations on the cat8."
