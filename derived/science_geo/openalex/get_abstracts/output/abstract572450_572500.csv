https://openalex.org/W2546514099,"Although human tumours are shaped by the genetic evolution of cancer cells, evidence also suggests that they display hierarchies related to developmental pathways and epigenetic programs in which cancer stem cells (CSCs) can drive tumour growth and give rise to differentiated progeny. Yet, unbiased evidence for CSCs in solid human malignancies remains elusive. Here we profile 4,347 single cells from six IDH1 or IDH2 mutant human oligodendrogliomas by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and reconstruct their developmental programs from genome-wide expression signatures. We infer that most cancer cells are differentiated along two specialized glial programs, whereas a rare subpopulation of cells is undifferentiated and associated with a neural stem cell expression program. Cells with expression signatures for proliferation are highly enriched in this rare subpopulation, consistent with a model in which CSCs are primarily responsible for fuelling the growth of oligodendroglioma in humans. Analysis of copy number variation (CNV) shows that distinct CNV sub-clones within tumours display similar cellular hierarchies, suggesting that the architecture of oligodendroglioma is primarily dictated by developmental programs. Subclonal point mutation analysis supports a similar model, although a full phylogenetic tree would be required to definitively determine the effect of genetic evolution on the inferred hierarchies. Our single-cell analyses provide insight into the cellular architecture of oligodendrogliomas at single-cell resolution and support the cancer stem cell model, with substantial implications for disease management."
https://openalex.org/W2548680460,"The mass of the axion, a particle that is central to many dark-matter theories, is calculated via the equation of state of the Universe and the temperature dependence of the so-called topological susceptibility of quantum chromodynamics. Calculations that need to consider the theory of quantum chromodynamics, which describes how the strong interaction holds quarks together, are daunting because of the nonlinearity of the strong force. Despite the numerical difficulties, Szabolcs Borsanyi et al. have managed to perform an accurate calculation of the mass of an axion. These particles are at the heart of many dark-matter theories. Key in this paper is the ability to calculate the equation of state and the so-called topological susceptibility of quantum chromodynamics over a very wide temperature range. With their determination of the axion mass, the authors make important predictions about the evolution of the Universe that will help to test dark-matter theories involving axions in the near future. Unlike the electroweak sector of the standard model of particle physics, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is surprisingly symmetric under time reversal. As there is no obvious reason for QCD being so symmetric, this phenomenon poses a theoretical problem, often referred to as the strong CP problem. The most attractive solution for this1 requires the existence of a new particle, the axion2,3—a promising dark-matter candidate. Here we determine the axion mass using lattice QCD, assuming that these particles are the dominant component of dark matter. The key quantities of the calculation are the equation of state of the Universe and the temperature dependence of the topological susceptibility of QCD, a quantity that is notoriously difficult to calculate4,5,6,7,8, especially in the most relevant high-temperature region (up to several gigaelectronvolts). But by splitting the vacuum into different sectors and re-defining the fermionic determinants, its controlled calculation becomes feasible. Thus, our twofold prediction helps most cosmological calculations9 to describe the evolution of the early Universe by using the equation of state, and may be decisive for guiding experiments looking for dark-matter axions. In the next couple of years, it should be possible to confirm or rule out post-inflation axions experimentally, depending on whether the axion mass is found to be as predicted here. Alternatively, in a pre-inflation scenario, our calculation determines the universal axionic angle that corresponds to the initial condition of our Universe."
https://openalex.org/W2548868034,"Sleep is conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates, and is tightly regulated in a homeostatic manner. The molecular and cellular mechanisms that determine the amount of rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and non-REMS (NREMS) remain unknown. Here we identify two dominant mutations that affect sleep and wakefulness by using an electroencephalogram/electromyogram-based screen of randomly mutagenized mice. A splicing mutation in the Sik3 protein kinase gene causes a profound decrease in total wake time, owing to an increase in inherent sleep need. Sleep deprivation affects phosphorylation of regulatory sites on the kinase, suggesting a role for SIK3 in the homeostatic regulation of sleep amount. Sik3 orthologues also regulate sleep in fruitflies and roundworms. A missense, gain-of-function mutation in the sodium leak channel NALCN reduces the total amount and episode duration of REMS, apparently by increasing the excitability of REMS-inhibiting neurons. Our results substantiate the use of a forward-genetics approach for studying sleep behaviours in mice, and demonstrate the role of SIK3 and NALCN in regulating the amount of NREMS and REMS, respectively. Two mutations affecting the sleep–wakefulness balance in mice are detected, showing that the SIK3 protein kinase is essential for determining daily wake time, and the NALCN cation channel regulates the duration of rapid eye movement sleep. Although the molecular pathways regulating circadian rhythms have been extensively explored and catalogued, much less is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling and driving sleep homeostasis. Using a forward genetic screen, Hiromasa Funato et al. identify two mutations affecting sleep/wakefulness balance. The Sik3 protein kinase was shown to be essential for determining total wake time, and mutations in the cation channel NALCN modulated REM sleep episode duration and total REM sleep time."

https://openalex.org/W2547486598,"In the chemical industry, molecules of interest are based primarily on carbon skeletons. When synthesizing such molecules, the activation of carbon-carbon single bonds (C-C bonds) in simple substrates is strategically important: it offers a way of disconnecting such inert bonds, forming more active linkages (for example, between carbon and a transition metal) and eventually producing more versatile scaffolds. The challenge in achieving such activation is the kinetic inertness of C-C bonds and the relative weakness of newly formed carbon-metal bonds. The most common tactic starts with a three- or four-membered carbon-ring system, in which strain release provides a crucial thermodynamic driving force. However, broadly useful methods that are based on catalytic activation of unstrained C-C bonds have proven elusive, because the cleavage process is much less energetically favourable. Here we report a general approach to the catalytic activation of C-C bonds in simple cyclopentanones and some cyclohexanones. The key to our success is the combination of a rhodium pre-catalyst, an N-heterocyclic carbene ligand and an amino-pyridine co-catalyst. When an aryl group is present in the C3 position of cyclopentanone, the less strained C-C bond can be activated; this is followed by activation of a carbon-hydrogen bond in the aryl group, leading to efficient synthesis of functionalized α-tetralones-a common structural motif and versatile building block in organic synthesis. Furthermore, this method can substantially enhance the efficiency of the enantioselective synthesis of some natural products of terpenoids. Density functional theory calculations reveal a mechanism involving an intriguing rhodium-bridged bicyclic intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2548058740,"Dietary fat promotes pathological insulin resistance through chronic inflammation. The inactivation of inflammatory proteins produced by macrophages improves diet-induced diabetes, but how nutrient-dense diets induce diabetes is unknown. Membrane lipids affect the innate immune response, which requires domains that influence high-fat-diet-induced chronic inflammation and alter cell function based on phospholipid composition. Endogenous fatty acid synthesis, mediated by fatty acid synthase (FAS), affects membrane composition. Here we show that macrophage FAS is indispensable for diet-induced inflammation. Deleting Fasn in macrophages prevents diet-induced insulin resistance, recruitment of macrophages to adipose tissue and chronic inflammation in mice. We found that FAS deficiency alters membrane order and composition, impairing the retention of plasma membrane cholesterol and disrupting Rho GTPase trafficking-a process required for cell adhesion, migration and activation. Expression of a constitutively active Rho GTPase, however, restored inflammatory signalling. Exogenous palmitate was partitioned to different pools from endogenous lipids and did not rescue inflammatory signalling. However, exogenous cholesterol, as well as other planar sterols, did rescue signalling, with cholesterol restoring FAS-induced perturbations in membrane order. Our results show that the production of endogenous fat in macrophages is necessary for the development of exogenous-fat-induced insulin resistance through the creation of a receptive environment at the plasma membrane for the assembly of cholesterol-dependent signalling networks."

https://openalex.org/W2507759049,"The gradual development of a turbulent cascade in a weakly interacting homogeneous Bose gas is observed on application of a periodic driving force. An important signature of turbulence is the emergence of a cascade of excitations involving all length scales. While turbulence has been observed in quantum fluids—typically liquid helium—it is difficult to control such systems and to observe the properties of turbulence on demand, because the particles therein strongly interact. Here Nir Navon et al. trap a weakly interacting homogeneous Bose–Einstein condensate consisting of rubidium-87 atoms in a cylindrical optical box and shake the gas to produce turbulence. This methodology lets them observe the full turbulent cascade. This work demonstrates that ultracold atomic gases could serve as models for quantum turbulence. A central concept in the modern understanding of turbulence is the existence of cascades of excitations from large to small length scales, or vice versa. This concept was introduced in 1941 by Kolmogorov and Obukhov1,2, and such cascades have since been observed in various systems, including interplanetary plasmas3, supernovae4, ocean waves5 and financial markets6. Despite much progress, a quantitative understanding of turbulence remains a challenge, owing to the interplay between many length scales that makes theoretical simulations of realistic experimental conditions difficult. Here we observe the emergence of a turbulent cascade in a weakly interacting homogeneous Bose gas—a quantum fluid that can be theoretically described on all relevant length scales. We prepare a Bose–Einstein condensate in an optical box7, drive it out of equilibrium with an oscillating force that pumps energy into the system at the largest length scale, study its nonlinear response to the periodic drive, and observe a gradual development of a cascade characterized by an isotropic power-law distribution in momentum space. We numerically model our experiments using the Gross–Pitaevskii equation and find excellent agreement with the measurements. Our experiments establish the uniform Bose gas as a promising new medium for investigating many aspects of turbulence, including the interplay between vortex and wave turbulence, and the relative importance of quantum and classical effects."

https://openalex.org/W2547794687,"Mammalian colour patterns are among the most recognizable characteristics found in nature and can have a profound impact on fitness. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the formation and subsequent evolution of these patterns. Here we show that, in the African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio), periodic dorsal stripes result from underlying differences in melanocyte maturation, which give rise to spatial variation in hair colour. We identify the transcription factor ALX3 as a regulator of this process. In embryonic dorsal skin, patterned expression of Alx3 precedes pigment stripes and acts to directly repress Mitf, a master regulator of melanocyte differentiation, thereby giving rise to light-coloured hair. Moreover, Alx3 is upregulated in the light stripes of chipmunks, which have independently evolved a similar dorsal pattern. Our results show a previously undescribed mechanism for modulating spatial variation in hair colour and provide insights into how phenotypic novelty evolves."
https://openalex.org/W2548555233,"Clinical trials have shown that administration of the nematode Trichuris suis can be beneficial in treating various immune disorders. To provide insight into the mechanisms by which this worm suppresses inflammatory responses, an active component was purified from T. suis soluble products (TsSPs) that suppress---- TNF and IL-12 secretion from LPS-activated human dendritic cells (DCs). Analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry identified this compound as prostaglandin (PG)E2. The purified compound showed similar properties compared with TsSPs and commercial PGE2 in modulating LPS-induced expression of many cytokines and chemokines and in modulating Rab7B and P2RX7 expression in human DCs. Furthermore, the TsSP-induced reduction of TNF secretion from DCs is reversed by receptor antagonists for EP2 and EP4, indicating PGE2 action. T. suis secretes extremely high amounts of PGE2 (45-90 ng/mg protein) within their excretory/secretory products but few related lipid mediators as established by metabololipidomic analysis. Culture of T. suis with several cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors that inhibit mammalian prostaglandin synthesis affected the worm's motility but did not inhibit PGE2 secretion, suggesting that the worms can synthesize PGE2 via a COX-independent pathway. We conclude that T. suis secretes PGE2 to suppress proinflammatory responses in human DCs, thereby modulating the host's immune response.-Laan, L. C., Williams, A. R., Stavenhagen, K., Giera, M., Kooij, G., Vlasakov, I., Kalay, H., Kringel, H., Nejsum, P., Thamsborg, S. M., Wuhrer, M., Dijkstra, C. D., Cummings, R. D., van Die, I.

We propose leveraging cloud-computing technologies to enable large-scale neurodata storing, exploring, analyzing, and modeling. This utility will empower scientists globally to generate and test theories of brain function and dysfunction. Technological advances from all around the globe (Grillner et al., 2016Grillner S. Ip N. Koch C. Koroshetz W. Okano H. Polachek M. Poo M.-M. Sejnowski T.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1118-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) are allowing neuroscientists to collect more precise, complex, varied, and extensive data than ever before (Sejnowski et al., 2014Sejnowski T.J. Churchland P.S. Movshon J.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1440-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). How can we maximally accelerate our collective ability to extract meaning from such data? To answer this question, the United States Congress commissioned the National Science Foundation (NSF) to “convene government representatives, neuroscience researchers, private entities, and non-profit institutions” (https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/113th-congress/house-report/448). The NSF funded two events. The first was a workshop of over 75 individuals from 12 countries and 5 continents that was broadcast live over the internet. Each person was invited to bring a single big idea—one that could have maximal impact, while being both feasible, given existing resources, and universally inclusive. Four ideas emerged as grand challenges for global brain science (Vogelstein et al., 2016Vogelstein, J.T., Amunts, K., Andreou, A., Angelaki, D., Ascoli, G., Bargmann, C., Burns, R., Cali, C., Chance, F., Chun, M., et al. (2016). arXiv, arXiv:1608.06548, https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06548.Google Scholar). A second event was organized to discuss these ideas with a larger (425 participants) and more diverse community, which will be the subject of another article. The goal of this NeuroView is to describe one of the four grand challenges and propose a strategy to overcome it, in order to gather feedback from the larger community. The authors are participants in the first conference who volunteered to hash out these ideas via emails, online documents, conference calls, and in-person visits. The kernel of the idea is based on a view of the scientific process as an “upward spiral”: a collective effort where each new experiment yields data, upon which analysis is performed, leading to new or refined models, which suggest novel experiments (see Figure 1). Historically, the process of data analysis has been kept relatively simple by the small scale of data acquired. But recent advances in experimental technology, such as serial electron microscopy (Denk and Horstmann, 2004Denk W. Horstmann H. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar), light sheet microscopy (Weber et al., 2014Weber M. Mickoleit M. Huisken J. Methods Cell Biol. 2014; 123: 193-215Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and models of the whole human brain at the microscopic level (Amunts et al., 2013Amunts K. Lepage C. Borgeat L. Mohlberg H. Dickscheid T. Rousseau M.-E. Bludau S. Bazin P.-L. Lewis L.B. Oros-Peusquens A.-M. et al.Science. 2013; 340: 1472-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), have made data analysis significantly more challenging. While experimental neuroscience is enabling the collection of ever larger and more varied datasets, information technology is undergoing a revolution of its own. Commercial development of artificial intelligence and cloud computing innovations are changing the computational landscape (The Economist, 2016The Economist (2016). The future of computing. The Economist, http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21694528-era-predictable-improvement-computer-hardware-ending-what-comes-next-future.Google Scholar). Computing is moving toward “cloudification,” a “software as a service” model, in which locally installed software programs are replaced by web apps. These forces create a massive opportunity to develop new computational technologies that complement advances in data collection in order to accelerate and democratize model building, hypothesis testing, and model refinement. Consider sending a letter, watching a movie at home, or obtaining reference information. Ten to twenty years ago, to send a letter, we purchased paper, stamps, and envelopes; to watch a movie at home, we rented or purchased a VHS or DVD; to obtain reference information, we bought an encyclopedia and obtained yearly revisions. Today, each of those options is still available and indeed preferred in certain circumstances. However, web options exist for each activity as well. In each case, we have privacy, bandwidth, and financial concerns. Nonetheless, for many of our daily practices we use these cyber solutions, sometimes putting our most private information in the cloud. The everyday practice of brain science is just beginning to benefit from similar technology development. Other scientific disciplines have already navigated similar waters with remarkable success. For example, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) changed the daily practice of astronomers and cosmologists (Kent, 1994Kent S.M. Science with Astronomical Near-Infrared Sky Surveys.in: Epchtein N. Omont A. Burton B. Persi P. Springer, 1994: 27-30Crossref Google Scholar). They still have the option to wait 6 months for telescope time, analyze their data locally on machines they own and maintain, and publish a summary of the results (and many do). Yet there are more accounts in SDSS than there are professional cosmologists. Astronomers can now log in to SDSS, find previously published data, run database queries (a skill they typically did not have prior to SDSS), and publish the queries and results. Similarly, molecular geneticists historically sequenced their own data (using machines that they owned and maintained), analyzed it locally, and published the results. Now, they can outsource the sequencing to avoid owning and maintaining the machines, upload the sequences to a national or international database, quantitatively compare their sequences to previously published sequences, and then publish their findings. The success of these efforts is evident from the cultural shift of daily practices by many, if not most, participants in each field. Both fields resolved issues of data privacy, data ownership, governance, and financial concerns, providing a proof of principle that other scientific disciplines can do the same. In neuroscience, many of our scientific practices remain based on pre-internet methods. A scientist designs an experiment, collects data, stores it locally, keeps metadata in his head or in some custom spreadsheet, analyzes it using software that he buys and installs on local computers that he updates regularly, and publishes a summary of the results. We predict that another strategy will be superior for many situations: as the scientist collects data, it gets stored privately or publicly in the cloud, and she then selects analyses to occur automatically, having the flexibility to pull from a variety of previously published analyses, and finally publishes entire “digital experiments,” containing (some of) the data and the entire analysis pipeline. We see two key goals that, if achieved, would leverage advances in computing to accelerate brain sciences. The first goal is to make reproducibility and extensibility of science as easy as possible, even for small amounts of data or simple data. The current practices of private data storage and siloed analyses make reproducing an analytic result tedious at best and impossible at worst. The steps can include requesting the data, identifying the formats and organization, requesting the code, deciding which functions to run and how, getting all necessary dependencies installed, making sure to use the same software versions, and accessing the same computational hardware. Solutions now exist to mitigate each of these challenges, though they are relatively disparate and unconnected. Data can be uploaded to data repositories (e.g., https://figshare.com/), data standards have been proposed for several domains of brain science (e.g., http://bids.neuroimaging.io/ and http://www.nwb.org/), code can be stored in publicly accessible repositories (e.g., https://github.com/), interactive tutorials can be provided (e.g., using http://jupyter.org/), and all necessary software dependencies can be easily packaged together (e.g., using https://www.docker.com/) and run “in the cloud” (e.g., using http://mybinder.org/) on commercial service providers (e.g., on https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ or https://cloud.google.com/). Nonetheless, given some new data, it is not obvious where to find reference algorithms or how to connect them to the data. Similarly, given a new model, it is not clear how to find reference data, figure out which standard it is using and then fit it, and determine if others have done the same to allow us to compare and assess the results. In either case, once the data are processed, it remains difficult to keep track of the resulting data derivatives and which version of which code resulted in which outputs. So although many of the pieces are in place, there is still no unified “glue” that makes everything work together seamlessly. Moreover, each of the above-mentioned tools can be used by some brain scientists, but most tools are designed for data scientists, so the learning curve can be incredibly steep. Ideally, there would be a place where brain scientists could find all relevant analyses and data, run each analysis on each dataset, and see a leaderboard comparing performances, without writing any lines of code. Cloud-based solutions simplify reproducibility and extensibility by essentially eliminating activation energy and extraneous sources of analytic variability. The second goal is to enable such a system to work with “big data” (i.e., data too large to fit on a workstation). Data are scaling in many domains in brain science, either because individual experiments are large (as in calcium imaging and whole-brain CLARITY imaging), there are thousands of subjects with gigabytes of data each (as in large-scale human brain imaging projects), or there are millions of time points (as in wearable sensor data). Regardless of source and modality, if it is “medium data” (meaning too large to fit in memory, but small enough to fit on your computer), tasks as simple as visualizing, rotating, and opening the data are challenging using standard tools such as MATLAB, Python, or ImageJ. For big data, the challenges are even larger because questions of how to store, compress, manage, and archive the data exceed the computational capabilities and resources of most experimental labs. Cloud-based solutions simplify big data analysis due to their inherently scalable nature. We are proposing to design, build, and deploy an instance of “cloud neuroscience,” meaning that the data, the code, and the analytic results all live in the cloud together. Cloud neuroscience can be thought of as an operating system, a set of programs that run on it, a file system that stores the data, and the data itself, all designed to run in a scalable fashion and to be accessible from anywhere. First and foremost, the design and construction should be organic, grassroots, and open source, to ensure that it remains intimately connected to the needs of all scientific citizens. Over 100,000 people attend annual brain science conferences, including neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, and neurology. This is a massive human capital resource, so the system should enable contributions from any of them, regardless of background or resources. Thus, the system needs to support data and workflows of all kinds, regardless of modality, complexity, or scale—including raw data, derived data, and metadata. Doing so would also further democratize brain sciences, opening the door to the additional 3.5 billion people with mobile broadband access who could contribute if given the opportunity. Encouraging and supporting such involvement motivates an emphasis on ethical standards and cultural sensitivities. Moreover, millions of hours and billions of dollars have been spent developing brain science resources, including vast quantities of data, algorithms, and models. The system should build upon such work. Because different people have different preferences, access controls should be flexible enough to satisfy everyone’s needs. For resources that are open, reproducing and extending prior work should be “turn-key,” allowing researchers to “swap in” different datasets or algorithms as desired. Industry is making tremendous headway in this regard, including digital notebooks to keep track of all analyses, software containers to ease the burden of installing and configuring software, and web services that dynamically provide computational resources as needed. To the extent possible, we should leverage these resources and engage with non-profit, institutional, and corporate partners to express our domain-specific needs. The design should be highly adaptive, to capitalize on rapid advances from within and outside brain sciences, and, of course, open source with permissive licenses. And the entire system should be able to run not just in a single commercial cloud, but also on other clouds, national resources, institutional clusters, local workstations, and laptops, to enable maximal portability and utility. Perhaps most importantly, the system should be universally useful, helping to answer the grand challenges of brain science while facilitating much greater participation in the scientific process. The motivation underlying this endeavor is to accelerate the scientific process by improving the experience of doing brain science. Thus, the community can determine the worst pain points in our process and design solutions around them. For example, if looking at data is the largest bottleneck, then one could use a cloud-based visualization app (like Google Maps, CATMAID, or NeuroDataViz). On the other hand, if the largest bottleneck is getting data into a common format before running analyses, then one would benefit from having all the data stored in a format with a standardized application programming interface (API) so every dataset can be accessed in the same way. In other words, it is time for the scientific community to prioritize the user experience to focus the subsequent software development. In this section, we propose a potential design of the constituent components that could comprise an instance of cloud neuroscience (see Figure 2). The required elements can be divided into five categories: data, infrastructure, apps, algorithms, and education. The goal of breaking down the problem this way is to ensure that all brain scientists, professional and citizen alike, can contribute to and benefit from the system. Crucial to success will be tight integration across components, each of which is described in some detail below. Some brain scientists are able to span the full range from design to analysis, including running experiments, analyzing data, making discoveries, and even writing articles. Such polymaths can seamlessly alternate between different roles. Others might be highly skilled in software engineering, but not data collection. To ensure that all brain scientists can contribute to this effort, we have organized types of activities according to the “role” of the individual performing those activities. These roles are not meant to be prescriptive; rather, they serve to help guide scientists to the different kinds of contributions they could make (see Box 1 for detailed description of the roles).Box 1RolesWe enumerate six different roles for participants.

Therefore, the technical challenges for small and large data storage and access, for the most part, already have reasonable solutions for many data types. The remaining challenges are to further lower the barrier to entry, making data upload and access easier, especially for multi-terabyte datasets. Data contributions will be able to come from anyone and could be stored in a variety of accessible places to minimize transfer cost and time. Access controls would enable scalable sharing with minimal effort. Storage costs would be the responsibility of the data provider if the data are private; if public, others could financially contribute. In either case, economies of scale would reduce storage costs, and we would work with commercial clouds and national infrastructures to offset costs to the extent possible. The data storage formats would allow visualization and analysis at scale. Data contribution would be desirable and possible from any lab, regardless of its financial resources or location. For example, some methods are relatively inexpensive, such as EEG, fNIRS, and wearable technologies. Moreover, certain important subpopulations are better represented in less wealthy countries, enabling unique contributions from those places. If the same measures are included in more expensive projects, analysis bridges could be established between the datasets. This would enhance translational research at a global scale. These factors would lead to important collaborations in which less wealthy countries could influence the content and usefulness of this effort (Neuroinformatics Collaboratory, 2016Neuroinformatics Collaboratory (2016). Neuroinformatics Collaboratory, http://www.neuroinformatics-collaboratory.org.Google Scholar). Data types would include raw, derived, and metadata (see Box 2 for additional details). Raw data include data from any kind of experiment, including functional, structural, omics (e.g., genetic and epigenetic), behavioral, and medical data. Every experiment will be given a unique data identifier. Medical data will be given special attention to ensure compliance with national guidelines for patient privacy. Each data type will yield a wide diversity of derived data, including summary statistics, matrices, networks, shapes, and more. Associated with each entry is a collection of metadata, including a community-driven controlled vocabulary, as well as custom ad hoc fields. Metadata on the derived data will include detailed provenance history. The system would be seeded with existing reference datasets spanning spatial, temporal, and phylogenetic scales, including data from the Human Brain Project, the Human Connectome Project, the Allen Institute for Brain Science’s data portal, IARPA’s MICrONs program, and more.Box 2Types of Brain Science Data•Functional data are fundamentally temporal and dynamic. Whether univariate or multivariate, the standard operations to apply include zooming in time, subsampling, smoothing, and converting to other domains such as Fourier. Functional data also have a spatial domain, which links them to structural data. The subdivision between functional and structural data may be, for some data, ambiguous.•Structural data are fundamentally spatial in nature, include 2D images, 3D volumes, and 4D and 5D hypervolumes for multispectral and/or time-varying data (spatiotemporal data, such as fMRI and calcium imaging, are both structural and functional).

The infrastructure component is intended to mitigate difficulties in finding data or tools, linking them together, installing software, managing computers, and reproducing and extending results. When the infrastructure is operational, much of the scientific process can be conducted from a tablet or smartphone, replacing the need to buy and maintain high-power computers or keep software up to date. The infrastructure is essentially the operating system upon which all the services would run, akin to NeuroDebian (Halchenko and Hanke, 2012Halchenko Y.O. Hanke M. Front. Neuroinform. 2012; 6: 22Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but designed specifically for the cloud. This virtual operating system will run in the commercial cloud, on institutional resources, national centers, or local workstations, regardless of hardware configuration (e.g., Mac, Windows, Linux, etc.).

High-performance computing will allow exploratory analysis of massive datasets stored in standardized formats, hosted in open repositories, and integrated with simulations. Opportunities offered by new neuro-technologies are threatened by lack of coherent plans to analyze, manage, and understand the data. High-performance computing will allow exploratory analysis of massive datasets stored in standardized formats, hosted in open repositories, and integrated with simulations. The diverse national and private neuroscience initiatives across the globe aim to accelerate our understanding of brains in a variety of ways (Grillner et al., 2016Grillner S. Ip N. Koch C. Koroshetz W. Okano H. Polachek M. Poo M.-M. Sejnowski T.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1118-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Central to many initiatives is developing tools to investigate neuronal circuits at unprecedented resolution and scales. Much attention has been focused on the technological challenges of measuring and manipulating neural activity from large numbers of sites (e.g., neurons) for long periods. However, much less attention has been focused on the computing challenges associated with the vast amounts of data that these technologies generate. Specific and coherent plans to manage, share, analyze, and understand these data remain in a nascent stage. Thus, the opportunities offered by new neuro-technologies are threatened by the deluge of data generated. High-performance computing (HPC) has revolutionized many scientific fields, in particular those studying systems of many heterogeneous elements governed by complex interaction across many spatiotemporal scales: brains fit this mold well. Scientific HPC has traditionally focused on large-scale simulations, and this is also true for neuroscience (e.g., Markram et al., 2015Markram H. Muller E. Ramaswamy S. Reimann M.W. Abdellah M. Sanchez C.A. Ailamaki A. Alonso-Nanclares L. Antille N. Arsever S. et al.Cell. 2015; 163: 456-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). However, there is a paradigm shift occurring within the HPC community toward harnessing this massive computing power to processing and analyzing experimental data (Bethel et al., 2016Bethel, E.W., Greenwald, M., van Dam, K.K., Parashar, M., Wild, S.M., and Wiley, H.S. (2016). DoE ASCR Workshop Report. http://www.mcs.anl.gov/papers/P6017-0616.pdf.Google Scholar). The neuroscience community is not alone in the challenges of utilizing HPC—other scientific fields are being rapidly transformed through the application of HPC to process and analyze ever-increasing volumes of experimental data. The computational power, memory, and storage capabilities offered by HPC resources, while not yet suitable for many neuroscience labs, can enable the neuroscience community to address several “Grand Challenge Problems.” Here we focus on four topics: processing and analysis of structural connectomics data, extreme-scale statistical data analytics on massive physiology datasets (i.e., electrical and optical recording), repositories for hosting and sharing multi-modal data stored in standardized formats, and data synthesis through neural circuit simulations. Across species, brains consist of hundreds-to-billions of individual neurons connected by thousands-to-trillions of synapses. These circuits form the structural backbone from which brain function is generated. Structural connectomics refers to neuropil reconstruction at sufficient resolution to trace neuronal processes and unambiguously identify synaptic connections. The current fastest approach for structural connectomics involves scanning multiple electron beams over a brain sample in parallel and is already producing ∼50 TB/day. HPC systems are well positioned to store, host, and process these data volumes. The major computational bottleneck in structural connectomics is automating segmentation, alignment, and annotation of the raw data (Lichtman et al., 2014Lichtman J.W. Pfister H. Shavit N. Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1448-1454Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The best current algorithms are relatively slow when one considers the total amount of computation required to render any reasonably sized connectome (e.g., a cubic millimeter of tissue). The segmentation challenge is compounded by two facts: the segmentation task requires the tracing of all (or most of) the objects in the field of view; and segmentation accuracies have to be very good, as even small mistakes could result in thousands of downstream synapses being incorrectly assigned. Large-scale image/volumetric processing has been routinely conducted on HPC systems for three-dimensional (3D) and four-dimensional (4D) data generated by physics simulations (e.g., combustion, cosmology, etc.). Thus, collaboration between the communities should be able to effectively leverage existing computational tools and resources. The result of processing structural connectomics data could be either a 3D geometric representation of each cell and its attendant processes and/or a “graph” of the resulting structural connectivity matrix with identified synapses and measures of synaptic strength. A weighted, directed graph characterizing the connection strength between neurons, along with a 3D embedding of the synapses and neurons for visualization purposes, would provide a compact summary sufficient for analyses—and is a critical step in linking “structure-to-function” in the brain. Performing exploratory analysis (e.g., “clique counting,” Milo et al., 2002Milo R. Shen-Orr S. Itzkovitz S. Kashtan N. Chklovskii D. Alon U. Science. 2002; 298: 824-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar) on graphs consisting of 100 billion nodes (number of neurons in human brain) and one trillion edges (10% average connectivity) requires optimized methods that can exploit the structure of the graph and are accelerated by HPC resources. The extraction of information from large-scale neurophysiology experiments requires the application of sophisticated data analysis methods. There are computing challenges associated with data preprocessing (e.g., image processing, spike sorting) and application of statistical data analytics (SDA) to the processed data. In particular, neuroscience researchers often implicitly or explicitly interpret the output of their data analysis tools as reflecting the true state of nature. Therefore, neuroscience requires SDA algorithms that are simultaneously interpretable and predictive. By interpretable, we mean that inferred models yield insight into the (bio)-physical processes that generated the data; by predictive, we mean that the model predicts the data with high accuracy. There is often a tension between the goals of interpretability and predictability, and SDA methods that satisfy both criteria for massive datasets often require large-scale computing systems (Jordan, 2013Jordan M.I. Frontiers in Massive Data Analysis. National Academies Press, 2013Google Scholar). As there is a cost associated with all computing resources, and HPC in particular, optimized analysis codes developed by experts within the open-source community are required for efficient HPC utilization. More broadly, building and using workflows and frameworks for distributed computing, and embedding them in a collaborative setting, requires expertise well outside that of typical neuroscientists, and interactions with HPC centers could be transformative. HPC will eventually be required to understand the dynamically modulated, spatiotemporal patterns of neural activations occurring across multiple brain areas, which ultimately give rise to sensation, action, consciousness, and behavior. New technologies enable increasingly large numbers of “brain signals” to be recorded simultaneously from diverse recording modalities (e.g., Ca2+ imaging, multi-unit silicon arrays, electrocorticography [ECoG], fMRI). Concomitantly, the duration of recordings from the same neuronal population has been steadily increasing, and it will soon be possible to record continuously for weeks at a time (generating 100 s of TBs of data). Some data processing and analyses in neurophysiology can be performed independently on individual “channels” (e.g., pixels, neurons), exhibiting what is known as “natural” or “trivial” parallelism. For example, determination of encoding models, which describe how, e.g., a single neuron’s activity is modulated by sensory inputs/motor outputs, can be computed independently of the other neurons that are recorded. In contrast, extracting structure from the concerted action of neural populations necessarily requires that calculations be performed jointly on all (or nearly all) the data at the same time, making the parallelization challenging. Therefore, it is important to develop scalable SDA methods capable of revealing structure from the large-scale neurophysiology datasets. Two complementary approaches to understanding neural population dynamics are “dimensionality reduction” and “functional connectomics.” Dimensionality-reduction methods aim to find low-dimensional spaces that concisely summarize the high-dimensional spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity; these lower-dimensional spaces can be used to gain insight into higher-order network dynamics (Cunningham and Yu, 2014Cunningham J.P. Yu B.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1500-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Owing primarily to its (relative) computational efficiency, the most common dimensionality-reduction method in neuroscience (and many other fields) is principal components analysis (PCA). Even for PCA, application to very large-scale datasets is non-trivial, but it has recently been performed on TB-sized matrices using HPC systems (Gittens et al., 2016Gittens, A., Devarakonda, A., Racah, E., Ringenburg, M., Gerhardt, L., Kottalam, J., Liu, J., Maschhoff, K., Canon, S., Chhugani, J., et al. (2016). arXiv, arXiv:1607.01335, https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01335.Google Scholar). The second complementary approach to neural-population dynamics is functional connectomics, which involves using temporally directed analysis methods to infer “causal” influences among spatially distributed neural recordings (Brovelli et al., 2004Brovelli A. Ding M. Ledberg A. Chen Y. Nakamura R. Bressler S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 9849-9854Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The resulting functional connectomes explicitly represent the time-varying, causal interactions between individual physical recordings and are thus potentially more interpretable than results from methods like PCA. Furthermore, functional connectomes are naturally represented as graphs, and so may be mapped to structural connectomes to enhance understanding of “structure-function” relationships. However, even using linear techniques (e.g., vector autoregressive models), the extraction of functional connectomes from large-scale neurophysiology datasets will require HPC systems running highly optimized implementations that estimate sparse connectivity in an unbiased fashion. These examples illustrate that performing even standard analysis on large-scale neurophysiology datasets will benefit from HPC systems. Continued investigations into interpretable statistical data analysis coupled with implementations on high-performance computing systems (e.g., to distribute optimization calculations) are required to address these challenges and to ensure that extraction of useful information from neuroscience data is unhindered by computing bottlenecks. Neuroscience is a diverse field producing a wide variety of datasets. It is essential to share data and code through standardized and extensible data models and management solutions (e.g., Garcia et al., 2014Garcia S. Guarino D. Jaillet F. Jennings T. Pröpper R. Rautenberg P.L. Rodgers C.C. Sobolev A. Wachtler T. Yger P. Davison A.P. Front. Neuroinform. 2014; 8: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar; http://nwb.org). The data model requirements in neuroscience are primarily driven by the data generators (e.g., experimenters) and the data consumers (e.g., data analysts). At a high level, data-generator requirements relevant for HPC include: fast data-write capabilities and efficient storage of large data volumes; common data standards to enhance portability and usability for efficient storage; and capacity for collection of metadata with the raw data for reproducibility and interpretation. Data-consumer requirements include: the need for fast data read for efficient data analysis; semantic data access through data query, annotations, and relationships; and integration of distributed, multi-modal data sources. This last point—integration of multi-modal data—is particularly salient for understanding neurophysiology recordings because, as recently noted, it is insufficient to record increasing numbers of neurons without simultaneously monitoring behavior during increasingly complex sensory, motor, and cognitive tasks (Gao and Ganguli, 2015Gao P. Ganguli S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2015; 32: 148-155Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The increased complexity of naturalistic, real-world stimuli and behaviors brings with it challenges of integrating such multi-modal data and metadata (e.g., visual, audio, haptic, and movement) with the brain data. The single greatest impediment to fully extracting the return on investment into neuroscience data collection is the lack of community alignment and coordination around standards for experiments, data, and metadata. Sharing and reuse of all data will enable validation of experiments and enhance reliable scientific interpretation. Ultimately, data analysis results in commodities that become shared and reused. The path to understanding often involves a complex range of processing steps requiring different areas of expertise. Similar to the role of metadata for raw measurements, data provenance (including the denotation of methods, parameters, etc.) is required for reliable interpretation of analysis. To maximize the utility of HPC for neuroscience data, ensuring “machine readability” of metadata is an important consideration that requires knowledge and expertise from experimentalists, data model designers, and data analysts. The close integration of computing resources with data repositories (e.g., http://crcns.org) will enable effective data-driven discovery. This includes integration of hardware resources for efficient processing, reduction of costs for large data transfers, and management/analysis software stacks to enable large-scale analysis. In addition to the challenges associated with storing large datasets from a single individual (i.e., a single brain or single experimental subject), persistent access to a large number of datasets across individuals drastically increases data volumes. Critically, combining across individuals will reveal universal design features of a species’ brain and will constrain models. Perhaps as important, comparing across individuals could expose “quirks” that make each individual unique and thus provide insight into resilience/susceptibility to failure modes (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, environmental challenges, etc.). Meeting all these needs requires advanced, high-performance data and computing infrastructure that HPC centers are ideally positioned to provide. Ultimately, the goal of neuroscience is to achieve a deeper, broader understanding of brains in health and disease that extends across vast spatial and temporal scales. Many domains utilize simulation where extensive experimentation is intractable due to either cost or feasibility of data acquisition. As other fields have demonstrated, it can be extremely productive to have computational/theoretical frameworks that permeate research directions and guide the scaling-up of data acquisition and analysis. By following a similar pattern, neuroscience can reduce the challenge of integrating information from very different perspectives of the brain. While a “theory of brain” seems a distant goal, many research domains focused on highly complex, multi-scale problems (e.g., climate, high-energy physics, cosmology) have effectively leveraged HPC capabilities to integrate data and analysis into theoretical frameworks through the use of simulations (Bauer et al., 2015Bauer P. Thorpe A. Brunet G. Nature. 2015; 525: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Full-scale simulations of neurons with all their synapses on supercomputers have recently enabled several research groups to construct anatomically detailed models of local cortical networks (e.g., Markram et al., 2015Markram H. Muller E. Ramaswamy S. Reimann M.W. Abdellah M. Sanchez C.A. Ailamaki A. Alonso-Nanclares L. Antille N. Arsever S. et al.Cell. 2015; 163: 456-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Modeling approaches can have different goals: “bottom-up models” aim to emulate high-level phenomena by constraining low-level parameters, while “top-down models” aim to replicate specific computations in a region. Linking the biophysical reality of bottom-up models with the well-defined computations of top-down models could reveal the biophysical mechanisms of neural computations, and more effort in this direction is required. The challenge still is to scale up networks to the size of the full brain (Kunkel et al., 2014Kunkel S. Schmidt M. Eppler J.M. Plesser H.E. Masumoto G. Igarashi J. Ishii S. Fukai T. Morrison A. Diesmann M. Helias M. Front. Neuroinform. 2014; 8: 78Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and further research may allow use of the upcoming exascale supercomputers for this purpose. Another challenge facing large-scale neural simulations is understanding how to evaluate the quality of results from models constrained by relatively limited amounts of experimental data, though some efforts in this domain exist (Hawrylycz et al., 2016Hawrylycz M. Anastassiou C. Arkhipov A. Berg J. Buice M. Cain N. Gouwens N.W. Gratiy S. Iyer R. Lee J.H. et al.MindScopeProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: 7337-7344Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Conversely, it should be possible to examine the accuracy of data analysis algorithms (e.g., spike sorting, functional connectivity estimation) on data from simulations, in which the ground truth is known. Techniques for understanding the uncertainty of model outputs and overall sensitivity of models relative to input parameterization is an area that needs to be further explored and will greatly increase computational demand. Community reliance on simulation codes requires the treatment of these codes as complex scientific infrastructure that need to be maintained. HPC will allow continued scaling (both in number and accuracy) of network simulations, as well as tighter integration with experimental data and analysis, which is required to generate specific predictions and hypotheses across spatiotemporal scales. While the computing challenges for different areas of neuroscience require somewhat non-overlapping sets of expertise, it is not enough to embark upon these enterprises independently (Box 1). To fully achieve the goals of the many neuroscience initiatives, data standards and analyses need to be coordinated, and the derived products from data analysis and simulations need to be synthesized into coherent, self-consistent descriptions of the brain. This endeavor has its own set of computing requirements: allowing exploratory analysis across the (international) neuroscience community will require major improvements to reproducibility of analysis workflows; massive data “meta-repositories” to persistently host the many repositories collecting physiological data from many experiments and individuals; that data will need to be stored in common formats and collocated with HPC hardware; and it must be analyzed using open-source, optimized-analysis tools guided by, and integrated with, brain-scale simulations. The insights generated from this endeavor will have high-payoff outcomes: they will greatly support neuroscience efforts to reveal both universal design features of a species’ brain, as well as understand what makes each individual unique—a central concept of precision medicine. Activities focused on enabling “Cloud” computing for individual labs (e.g., “International Brain Station”) are important endeavors but do not address the challenges for which HPC will be required, and both should be pursued in parallel. Harnessing the power of HPC resources will require neuroscientists to work closely with computer scientists and will take time, so we recommend rapid and sustained investment in this important endeavor now.Box 1Summary and Recommendations•The computational power, memory, and storage capabilities offered by HPC resources will enable the neuroscience community to address several “Grand Challenge Problems.” HPC needs to be more thoroughly integrated into neuroscience research strategies.•Persistent storage of large-scale neuroscience datasets from multiple brains in massive repositories is required to extract universal design principles and identify unique differences across individuals. HPC systems are uniquely positioned to enable this capability and should be utilized.•Leveraging HPC resources for neuroscience “Grand Challenge Problems” requires significant investment in standardization of data and metadata as well as development and optimization of data preprocessing and analysis codes, as well as enabling data analysis frameworks (e.g., Spark) on HPC systems.•Activities focused on enabling “Cloud” computing for individual labs (e.g., “International Brain Station”) are important endeavors but do not address the challenges for which HPC will be required, and both should be pursued in parallel.•International research and funding agreements, such as occurs in high-energy physics, should ensure coordination across different national and private neuroscience initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W2548979602,"It is widely accepted that physiological mechanical stimulation suppresses apoptosis and induces synthesis of extracellular matrix by osteoblasts; however, the effect of stress overloading on osteoblasts has not been fully illustrated. In the present study, we investigated the effect of cyclic compressive stress on rat osteoblasts apoptosis, using a novel liquid drop method to generate mechanical stress on osteoblast monolayers. After treatment with different levels of mechanical stress, apoptosis of osteoblasts and activations of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways were investigated. Osteoblasts apoptosis was observed after treated with specific inhibitors prior to mechanical stimulation. Protein levels of Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-3 signaling were determined using western blot with or without inhibitors of PI3K/Akt and phosphorylation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) MAPK. Results showed that mechanical stimulation led to osteoblasts apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner and a remarkable activation of MAPKs and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Activation of PI3K/Akt protected against apoptosis, whereas JNK MAPK increased apoptosis via regulation of Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-3 activation. In summary, the PI3K/Akt and JNK MAPK signaling pathways played opposing roles in osteoblasts apoptosis, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis upon small-magnitude stress and increased apoptosis upon large-magnitude stress."

Beyond the scientific goals this grand endeavor will ultimately have socioeconomic ramifications that not only facilitate global collaboration in the neuroscience community, but also develop various brain science-related industrial and medical innovations. In 1998, the Korean government enacted the “Brain Research Promotion Act” to promote the importance of brain science and enhance the public’s welfare by facilitating the industrialization of developed technologies in what has recently been referred to as “the fourth industrial revolution” (Schwab, 2015Schwab, K. (2015). Foreign Affairs, December 12, 2015. https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2015-12-12/fourth-industrial-revolution.Google Scholar). This act reinforced the government’s active investments in basic and clinical neuroscience, cognitive science, and neuro-engineering. The main content of the Act consists of the establishment of basic annual plans to foster brain research, which are published in annual reports; the installation and operation of a biotechnology comprehensive policy deliberating committee; and the expansion of investments through collaborative efforts of four ministries of the Korean government: the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MSIP); the Ministry of Education (MOE); the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE); and the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW). Based on the first (1998–2007) and the second (2008 –2017) Brain Research Promotion Basic Plans, the Korean government has analyzed the working plans, which are publishing annual reports. The decade-long 21st Century Brain Frontier Project (2003–2013) contributed to advancing brain science. This government-led project largely focused on R&D for brain functions and diseases, with research studies conducted by joint teams from the private and public sectors. Due to these two decades of promotional effort by the Korean government, Korea’s brain research has been able to grow and prosper continuously. Along with growing international efforts in the area of brain mapping, there has been emerging interest in formulating nationwide brain science projects in Korea. It has been considered a challenging and timely endeavor to launch a flagship initiative prior to another national basic plan for a decade-long development of brain science (2018–2027), and the Korean government has developed a bold and ambitious plan for advancing brain science and stimulating the interaction between the scientific community and industry. To further promote brain research at the government level, the Korea Brain Research Institute (KBRI) was established in 2011 based on Article 17 (Establishment of Research Institutes) of the Brain Research Promotion Act. This national institute plays an important role in conducting national brain research while also maintaining and developing a system for enhancing cooperation among academia, research institutes, and industries. In the same year, the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST, founded in 1966) launched the Brain Science Institute to facilitate brain science in convergence with brain engineering. In 2013, the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) also began contributing to the development of basic neuroscience research, creating three research groups: centers for cognition and sociality, neuroscience imaging research, and synaptic brain dysfunctions. With the advantage of these ongoing investments and a strong environment for research, Korean neuroscience has made remarkable progress. Macroscale brain imaging studies are now supported by over 400 MRIs across the country and also by a dedicated IBS center. The Brain Science Institute of KIST focuses on neural and glial mechanisms in the diseased brain and the developing programs for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of such diseases. KBRI, on the other hand, has launched a collaborative research project focusing on perceptual decision-making by multiscale circuit analysis of the posterior parietal cortex. Recently, MSIP formed an advisory committee composed of experts from academia, research institutes, and business to develop a ten-year roadmap to revolutionize brain science. With this commitment, in-depth research on policies in neuroscience has been conducted, which resulted in the announcement of the “Korea Brain Initiative” on May 30, 2016. The overall plan features the development of novel neurotechnologies and the reinforcement of the neuroindustry with a vision to advance brain science by establishing and facilitating local, national, and global collaborative networks. It is essential for governments to invest in innovative approaches to solve today’s scientific challenges and prepare for the future of an aging society. The launch of a sustainable, nationwide, flagship brain research project is important to confront the challenges that we face in a changing society and prepare for the future neuro-industry. The proposed Korea Brain Initiative is currently the subject of a comprehensive feasibility study and technological assessment, after which the grand project will be launched in 2018. Aligned with these scientific and infrastructure goals, it will also be important to consider the ethical and social issues in advancing neuroscience and neurotechnologies. Because of potential societal implications, it will be critical to undertake regular and comprehensive assessment of the developing R&D programs, as well as to work to promote strong public awareness in support of these initiatives. Open forums and symposia on the development of national brain science programs will serve as communication channels for researchers and the public and provide opportunities to promote social harmony around the neuroscience community. The primary goal of the Korea Brain Initiative is to foster neuroscience to enable scientific understanding of the principles of higher brain functions to produce a new dynamic picture of healthy and diseased brains. Additional goals are to develop personalized treatments for mental and neurological disorders by extrapolating the concept of precision medicine and to stimulate the interaction among scientific institutes, academia, and industry. To achieve such goals, the project adopts a dual-track strategy of innovative R&D projects, building a balanced neuroscience ecosystem. The R&D of the Korea Brain Initiative is focused on four core areas:1.Constructing brain maps at multiple scales. The Korea Brain Initiative’s brain mapping plan employs a two-track strategy to understand how the brain works and how disease occurs. One track focuses on unraveling the structural and mechanistic bases of higher brain functions, such as decision-making, attention, and memory, while the other focuses on understanding the progression of neurological disorders, especially those related to aging. Two types of “specialized brain maps” are expected to be developed by 2023. Research in the area of functional connectomics will support the development and application of structural and functional mapping technologies applied at the micro-, meso-, and macroscales.2.Developing innovative neurotechnologies for brain mapping. The initiative aims at advancing technologies for a better understanding of the full complexity of the brain, and especially of circuit-function relationship. The development of neuro-tools for multiscale brain mapping, circuit-mining, and high-resolution wide-field recording as well as new methods for modeling neurological diseases such as brain organoids are a few examples of innovative convergence R&D projects.3.Strengthening artificial intelligence-related R&D. These initiatives are also intended to contribute to the development of new cutting-edge AI technologies. Neural circuit studies of higher brain functions such as sensory integration, perceptual decision-making, and natural intelligence are important for the advancement of AI, developing next-generation AI algorithms and models and neural devices.4.Developing personalized medicine for neurological disorders. The initiative aims to develop cutting-edge precision medicine technologies to prevent and diagnose neurological disorders and to develop customized disease-prevention and treatment strategies for brain disorders. In order to create a favorable and collaborative research environment, the Korea Brain Initiative intends to provide a framework to embark on research activities in harmony by:1.Training next-generation neuroscientists. The scope of neuroscience has broadened significantly over the last decades, and researchers in the field need to be competent in a wider range of technical and analytical knowledge and skills. It is essential to push the limits of our knowledge and to adopt new approaches to train and develop a next generation of neuroscientists through various multidisciplinary training programs. The Korea Brain Initiative incorporates training plans into all of its various academic research institute collaborative projects. In this way, we hope to nurture experts competent in translating basic research into new treatments for brain diseases.2.Strengthening a sustainable infrastructure. The Korea Brain Initiative aims at building a pipeline to facilitate collaborative research and exchange resources and research outcomes. For instance, the initiative plans to increase core facilities and expand the Korea Brain Bank Network (KBBN), and to construct an accessible data station to share and store data.3.Enhancing national and global networks. Strengthening strategic interactions with neuroscience stakeholders, both at the national and international level, will be essential to solve the challenging issues in brain science. With regard to brain mapping, establishing a collaborative network by joining a global brain research consortium, including the currently discussed project for creating an international brain data hub, would facilitate this task.4.Jump-starting the neuro-industry. The Korea Brain Initiative plans to build a framework for the industrialization of cutting-edge neuroscience. To this end, it is essential to develop lab-to-bench bridge programs and establish neuro-industry clusters where research and business sectors can work together to create new value in the field of neuroscience (Figure 1). The core infrastructure will feature a “hub-and-spoke” model in order to effectively operate the many projects of the Korea Brain Initiative. This model is expected to encourage multidisciplinary collaborations and create an open research environment. While the hub groups will have a role in providing research support from the core research infrastructure, standardizing brain mapping technologies, and developing the operating systems for data sharing, the individual spokes will undertake practical, bottom-up R&D activities and employ the systems that have been constructed and operated by the hub groups (Figure 2). The Korea Brain Initiative is unique in that it employs a dual-track strategy in pursuing goals of developing innovative neurotechnologies as well as fostering brain research environments. Through the implementation of this strategy, it is expected that the research ecosystem will function to bridge the gap between basic and applied neuroscience research. The reinforcement of this neuroscience ecosystem includes building and expanding neuroscience networks; allowing better access to research data, neuro-tools, and brain tissue samples; and fostering of a future-oriented neuro-industry. Last but not the least, central to the overall strategy of the Korea Brain Initiative is the commitment to foster the development of next-generation neuroscientists. In order to have a valuable research outcome, it is essential to create a strong environment and training ground for more and better-trained R&D manpower. The grand plan suggests cultivating the next generation of neuroscientists trained in multiple disciplines such as ICT, computer science, etc. through various programs involving institute-academia collaborations. This mission is crucial to recruit researchers for the brain mapping initiatives, and they will also contribute to an innovative research environment and will be better able to exploit the newly available data and information that will emerge from these big data resources. With the initiation of these neuroscience-focused mega-projects, Korea will not only boost its research competitiveness in the specialized fields of neuroscience but will also play a crucial role in contributing to impactful cooperation with the other national and global neuroscience communities that are involved in related neuroscience projects, including, for instance, the MESO-BRAIN Initiative, funded by EC FET, which aims to replicate the brain’s neural networks through 3D nano-printing (https://www.icfo.eu/newsroom/news/3142-meso-brain-and-light-sheet-imaging-techniques). For regional collaboration at a wider level, Korea is in discussions about the creation of an “Asia Brain Initiative,” a trilateral consortium between Korea, Japan, and China. By establishing a strategic East Asian brain research consortium, Korea is hoping to expand opportunities to conduct joint research projects and collaborate with international groups to tackle current challenges in the field of neuroscience, thereby contributing to the global neuroscience community as a whole. For the upcoming Tenth International Brain Research Organization (IBRO) World Congress of Neuroscience, to be held in Daegu, Korea, in September 2019, we hope that the East Asian regional alliance will bring together stakeholders from the global neuroscience community, discuss pertinent issues, and promote large-scale brain research projects through cooperation. Toward the goal of promoting effective, international collaboration, we hope to play an important part in the ambitious global-level plans toward establishing a comprehensive computational neuro-platform. A Korean delegation participated in a recent coordinating conference at Rockefeller University and a meeting that accompanied the 71st session of the UN General Assembly in September 2016, where there were official discussions on the topic of international collaboration among governments and the private sector for the launch of an International Brain Initiative, termed “The International Brain Station (TIBS)” (Reardon, 2016Reardon S.

By establishing a sustainable environment to build accessible databases, create core R&D facilities, and expand national brain bank networks, Korea is committed to expanding its role to the international level, embarking on various collaborative R&D tasks among national and global neuroscientists, and making significant contributions to the database initiative (Box 1).Box 1Funding InitiativesGovernanceThe Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MSIP) is at the top of the national project’s operating system.

https://openalex.org/W2547815051,"Previous study found that rifampicin caused intrahepatic cholestasis. This study investigated the effects of rifampicin on hepatic lipid metabolism. Mice were orally administered with rifampicin (200 mg/kg) daily for different periods. Results showed that serum TG level was progressively reduced after a short elevation. By contrast, hepatic TG content was markedly increased in rifampicin-treated mice. An obvious hepatic lipid accumulation, as determined by Oil Red O staining, was observed in mice treated with rifampicin for more than one week. Moreover, mRNA levels of Fas, Acc and Scd-1, several key genes for fatty acid synthesis, were elevated in rifampicin-treated mice. In addition, the class B scavenger receptor CD36 was progressively up-regulated by rifampicin. Interestingly, hepatic SREBP-1c and LXR-α, two important transcription factors that regulate genes for hepatic fatty acid synthesis, were not activated by rifampicin. Instead, hepatic PXR was rapidly activated in rifampicin-treated mice. Hepatic PPARγ, a downstream target of PXR, was transcriptionally up-regulated. Taken together, the increased hepatic lipid synthesis and uptake of fatty acids from circulation into liver jointly contribute to rifampicin-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. The increased uptake of fatty acids from circulation into liver might be partially attributed to rifampicin-induced up-regulation of PPARγ and its target genes."

Elevated levels of Crk and CrkL have been observed in many human cancers; inhibition of Crk and CrkL expression reduced the tumor-forming potential of cancer cell lines. Despite a close relationship between the Crk family proteins and tumorigenesis, how Crk and CrkL contribute to cell growth is unclear. We ablated endogenous Crk and CrkL from cultured fibroblasts carrying floxed alleles of Crk and CrkL by transfection with synthetic Cre mRNA (synCre). Loss of Crk and CrkL induced by synCre transfection blocked cell proliferation and caused shrinkage of the cytoplasm and the nucleus, formation of adherens junctions, and reduced cell motility. Ablation of Crk or CrkL alone conferred a much more modest reduction in cell proliferation. Reintroduction of CrkI, CrkII, or CrkL individually rescued cell proliferation in the absence of the endogenous Crk and CrkL, suggesting that Crk and CrkL play overlapping functions in regulating fibroblast growth. Serum and basic FGF induced phosphorylation of Akt, MAP kinases, and S6 kinase and Fos expression in the absence of Crk and CrkL, suggesting that cells lacking Crk and CrkL are capable of initiating major signal transduction pathways in response to extracellular stimuli. Furthermore, cell cycle and cell death analyses demonstrated that fibroblasts lacking Crk and CrkL become arrested at the G1-S transition and undergo a modest apoptosis.

To investigate functions of endogenous Crk and CrkL in biological processes at the cellular level, we developed mouse strains and cell lines harboring individual and combined floxed alleles of Crk and CrkL. Application of the Cre-loxP recombination-based conditional knock-out approach to cultured fibroblasts enabled us to demonstrate that endogenous Crk and CrkL are important for maintaining cell structural integrity and proper cell motility (21.Park T.J. Curran T. Essential roles of Crk and CrkL in fibroblast structure and motility.Oncogene. 2014; 33: 5121-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We also discovered that Crk and CrkL are required for cell transformation induced by viral oncogenes (22.Koptyra M. Park T.J. Curran T. Crk and CrkL are required for cell transformation by v-fos and v-ras.Mol Carcinog. 2016; 55: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Here we utilized the conditional knock-out system to examine whether endogenous Crk and CrkL are required for cell growth. Our findings clearly demonstrate that Crk and CrkL play essential, overlapping roles in fibroblast proliferation by enabling cells to progress from the G1 phase to the S phase. Our study also demonstrates that expression of any one protein among CrkI, CrkII, and CrkL at physiological levels is sufficient to secure cell proliferation. We used the Neon system (Life Technologies) to achieve rapid and efficient gene expression in growing fibroblasts by transduction of synthetic mRNA (synRNA). To reduce innate immune responses and increase ectopic protein expression, we synthesized mRNA using the modified ribonucleotides, pseudo-UTP, and methyl-CTP (23.Warren L. Manos P.D. Ahfeldt T.

When fibroblasts immortalized by T antigen or the 3T3 protocol were transfected with synthetic green fluorescent protein mRNA (synGFP), both cell types in monolayer cultures showed evidence of green fluorescence at 1 day post transduction (DPT) (Fig. 1A). As cells proliferated, the intensity of fluorescence in individual cells gradually decreased (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the protein level of GFP in the cell population as measured by Western analysis displayed a similar trend (Fig. 1B). Time-lapse analysis of live fibroblasts transfected with synGFP showed strong GFP signals at 5 h post transduction, with the fluorescence reaching a maximum around 24 h post transduction, and thereafter, it gradually declined (Fig. 1, C and D). For quantification of the synRNA transfection efficiency, T antigen-immortalized fibroblasts were transfected with synGFP and fixed at different time points, and their nuclei were stained with DAPI. As shown in Fig. 1, E and F, 99 and 98% of fibroblasts were GFP-positive at 1 and 2 DPT, respectively. At 3 DPT, 69% of cells were positive for GFP. In contrast, only 5% of fibroblasts were GFP-positive at 2 and 3 DPT after GFP DNA transfection. The decrease in average GFP fluorescence intensity per cell over time is likely a consequence of the rapid proliferation of fibroblasts (Fig. 1G), thereby diluting the signal as the total intensities for all the fields of view (intensity × cell count) and the entire well (intensity x WST-1) stayed relatively constant over time (Fig. 1H). These observations suggest that electroporation of fibroblasts with synRNA is an effective method for rapid and efficient introduction of exogenous proteins into growing fibroblasts. To investigate the contribution of endogenous Crk and CrkL to cell growth, we immortalized fibroblasts from Crk/CrkL double-floxed mice using SV40 T antigen. We transfected the fibroblasts with synthetic Cre mRNA (synCre) to induce a rapid and efficient ablation of Crk and CrkL. As shown in Fig. 2A, staining of fibroblasts with crystal violet indicated substantial increases in cell number between 1 and 3 DPT for control and synGFP-transfected cells. In contrast, the cell number did not increase in cells transfected with synCre. Quantitative analyses of cell proliferation using WST-1 revealed similar exponential rates of cell proliferation in control and synGFP populations (slopes of 1.25 and 1.30, respectively) (Fig. 2, B–D). In contrast, synCre cells failed to proliferate (a slope of 0.05). Western analyses of cell lysates indicated that synCre induced efficient ablation of CrkI, CrkII, and CrkL. The steady state levels of Crk family proteins and other cellular proteins increased as control and synGFP cells recovered from trypsin-EDTA treatment and electroporation and continued to grow (Fig. 2E), probably due to increased cell-to-cell connections. It has been reported that expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of many cellular proteins, including focal adhesion proteins, increase at higher cell densities in Balb 3T3 fibroblasts (25.Batt D.B. Roberts T.M. Cell density modulates protein-tyrosine phosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3408-3414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, in synCre cells, the levels of Crk family proteins declined after electroporation (Fig. 2, E–G). Tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, a well known protein that associates with Crk family members, decreased as Crk family proteins disappeared from the cells (Fig. 2, E and H). Phosphorylation of Akt was also reduced in the absence of Crk and CrkL (Fig. 2, E and I). Although the level of β-actin showed a modest decrease, vinculin expression was not affected by the loss of Crk and CrkL (Fig. 2, J and K). The requirement of Crk and CrkL for cell proliferation and p130Cas phosphorylation was also observed in fibroblasts immortalized by the 3T3 protocol, which grew more slowly than T antigen-immortalized fibroblasts (data not shown). Our results indicate that endogenous Crk and CrkL are required for proliferation of immortalized fibroblasts. Staining of fibroblasts with Crk and CrkL antibodies suggests that Crk is expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm with a higher expression in the nucleus, whereas CrkL is expressed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus at similar levels (Fig. 3B, data not shown). When cells were transfected with synCre, the level of Crk substantially declined. On the other hand, the decrease in the CrkL level was not obvious in part because a polyclonal antibody for CrkL was used for the staining, although Western blot analysis clearly showed a substantial change in CrkL levels between the control and synCre cells (Fig. 2, E and G, versus Fig. 3B). Staining polymerized actin with phalloidin indicated that actin stress fiber formation was defective in the absence of Crk and CrkL. Cytoplasmic staining with a heat shock protein 90 antibody showed well developed cellular processes in control fibroblasts that were lost in the absence of Crk and CrkL, resulting in a more rounded appearance (Fig. 3, A and B). Without Crk and CrkL, cells formed tight clusters (Fig. 3A) that could be dissociated by treatment with trypsin-EDTA (data not shown), suggesting that they are not multinucleated cells. Because overexpression of Crk caused breakdown of adherens junctions and cell spreading as well as decreased levels of two key components of the adherens junction, E-cadherin and p120-catenin, in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial and non-small cell lung cancer cells (26.Lamorte L. Royal I. Naujokas M. Park M. Crk adapter proteins promote an epithelial-mesenchymal-like transition and are required for HGF-mediated cell spreading and breakdown of epithelial adherens junctions.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27.Mortazavi F. Dubinett S. Rettig M. c-Crk proto-oncogene contributes to transcriptional repression of p120-catenin in non-small cell lung cancer cells.Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2011; 28: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we tested whether adherens junction formation changed in fibroblasts lacking both Crk and CrkL. As shown in Fig. 3B, staining of control fibroblasts with a p120-catenin antibody did not exhibit any junctional structure between neighboring cells. In contrast, staining of synCre-transfected fibroblasts with the same antibody showed well developed adherens junctions between the neighboring cells (yellow arrows in Fig. 3B). However, the E-cadherin antibodies we tested did not show such a clear formation of adherens junctions. On the other hand, a pan-cadherin antibody displayed cell-to-cell junctions in both control and synCre-transfected cells, and the junctions looked more concentrated in synCre cells (white arrows in Fig. 3B). It is unclear whether they were adherens junctions because the shapes (white arrows) appeared to be different from the adherens junctions stained with p120-catenin (yellow arrows). Our results are consistent with Crk-induced breakdown of adherens junctions reported by Lamorte et al. (26.Lamorte L. Royal I. Naujokas M. Park M. Crk adapter proteins promote an epithelial-mesenchymal-like transition and are required for HGF-mediated cell spreading and breakdown of epithelial adherens junctions.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and suggest that adherens junctions were formed between neighboring cells in the absence of Crk and CrkL, contributing to formation of cell clusters. Furthermore, both nuclear and cytoplasmic areas of the cells significantly decreased in the absence of Crk and CrkL (Fig. 3, C and D). In addition, the cytoplasmic circularity increased in the absence of Crk and CrkL (Fig. 3E), suggesting that cells shrank and became rounded. Next, we examined whether the altered cell structure and formation of adherens junctions affect cell motility. The scratch wound-healing assay revealed directional migration of wild-type fibroblasts to the wound site for 24 h with 44 ± 4% of cells located in the region of interest (ROI) (Fig. 4, A–C). In contrast, only 4 ± 4% of synCre-transfected fibroblasts migrated to the wound site. These results confirm our previous findings (21.Park T.J. Curran T. Essential roles of Crk and CrkL in fibroblast structure and motility.Oncogene. 2014; 33: 5121-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that Crk and CrkL play essential roles in cell structure, formation of cell-to-cell junctions, and cell motility.FIGURE 4.Reduced cell motility in the absence of Crk and CrkL. T antigen-immortalized Crk/CrkL double-floxed fibroblasts were transfected without synRNA (None) or with synCre (0.2 μg in 10 μl cell suspension). At 2 DPT, a wound was created by scratching through the cell monolayer with a micropipette tip, and cells were allowed to migrate into the gap at the wound site for 24 h, fixed, and stained with a HSP90 antibody and DAPI to visualize the cytoplasm and nucleus. A, after fluorescence images were taken, a ROI of 2230 × 1000 μm as the original wound gap was drawn (red rectangles) using the Nikon NIS element program. Six separate experiments were done for each group, and representative images are shown. Scale bar: 500 μm.

Previously, other groups associated high levels of CRE expression with inhibition of cell growth and cytopathic effects (28.Loonstra A. Vooijs M. Beverloo H.B. Allak B.A. van Drunen E. Kanaar R. Berns A. Jonkers J. Growth inhibition and DNA damage induced by Cre recombinase in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9209-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 29.Pfeifer A. Brandon E.P. Kootstra N. Gage F.H. Verma I.M.

Therefore, we conducted a dose-response analysis of synCre in wild-type and Crk/CrkL double-floxed fibroblasts. Transfection of wild-type fibroblasts with synCre up to 0.2 μg did not affect exponential growth of cells (Fig. 5, A and C). However, use of 0.66 μg and more of synCre reduced proliferation of wild-type cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, as little as 0.066 μg of synCre inhibited proliferation of Crk/CrkL double-floxed cells, and at 0.2 μg there was essentially no growth (Fig. 5, B and C). Crystal violet staining of Crk/CrkL double-floxed cells showed that both inhibition of cell proliferation and morphological alteration occurred at a level of 0.2 μg synCre, indicating that both phenotypes are related (Fig. 5D). Examination of CrkI, CrkII, and CrkL indicated that all were effectively ablated using as little as 0.2 μg of synCre in double-floxed cells (Fig. 5, E–G). Furthermore, the changes in the growth rate and in the Crk family protein levels were closely correlated in Crk/CrkL double-floxed cells (Fig. 5, C versus F and G), suggesting that Crk family proteins play an essential role in cell proliferation. Phosphorylated forms of p130Cas and Akt were decreased to similar extents by 0.2 μg of synCre (Fig. 3, H and I). On the other hand, the decrease in β-actin levels induced by 2 μg synCre in wild-type cells seems to reflect a nonspecific effect of synCre. These results suggest that 0.2 μg is the optimal amount of synCre to investigate the effects of Crk/CrkL ablation without confounding nonspecific effects of high levels of CRE. Therefore, we chose to use 0.2 μg of synCre for further analyses. Because transfection of Crk/CrkL double-floxed cells with synCre ablated both Crk and CrkL, it was unclear which of these proteins was actually required for cell proliferation. To ablate Crk or CrkL alone, we derived immortalized fibroblasts from Crk or CrkL floxed mice and transfected them with synCre. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, loss of either Crk or CrkL only slightly reduced cell proliferation (10.8% and 4.9% inhibition for single-floxed cells compared with 92.4% for double-floxed cells). Furthermore, loss of either Crk or CrkL did not result in any detectable morphological alterations (Fig. 6C). Western analyses verified the loss of Crk or CrkL alone upon synCre transfection in single-floxed cells (Fig. 6, D and E). It is noteworthy that phosphorylated p130Cas decreased only when cells lost Crk (or Crk plus CrkL). The result suggests that Crk predominantly mediates phosphorylation of p130Cas. Phosphorylation of Akt decreased in the absence of both Crk and CrkL, but it did not decrease significantly when cells lacked either Crk or CrkL, suggesting that both Crk and CrkL contribute to Akt phosphorylation, with either sufficient for the phosphorylation to occur. The results from single-floxed fibroblasts demonstrate that Crk and CrkL play overlapping functions in cell proliferation and that ablation of one does not cause obvious defects."

It is not known if longer-term prior experiences requiring challenging balance control carryover as long-term adaptations that influence ability to react in response to novel stimuli. The purpose of this study was to determine if individuals who had long-term exposure to balance instability, such as those who train on specific skills that demand balance control, will have improved ability to adapt to complex continuous multidirectional perturbations. Healthy adults from three groups: 1) experienced maritime workers (n = 14), 2) novice individuals with no experience working in maritime environments (n = 12) and 3) individuals with training in dance (n = 13) participated in the study. All participants performed a stationary standing task while being exposed to five 6 degree of freedom motions designed to mimic the motions of a ship at sea. The balance reactions (change-in-support (CS) event occurrences and characteristics) were compared between groups. Results indicate dancers demonstrated significantly fewer CS events than novices during the first trial, but did not perform as well as those with offshore experience. Linear trend analyses revealed that short-term adaptation across all five trials was dependent on the nature of participant experience, with dancers achieving postural stability earlier than novices, but later than those with offshore experience. These results suggest that long term previous experiences also have a significant influence on the neural control of posture and balance in the development of compensatory responses."

Here we discuss the goals of the ABI, its areas of research focus, its context in the Australian research setting, and its necessity for ensuring continued success for Australian brain research. A proposal for an Australian Brain Initiative (ABI) is under development by members of the Australian Brain Alliance. Here we discuss the goals of the ABI, its areas of research focus, its context in the Australian research setting, and its necessity for ensuring continued success for Australian brain research. The Australian Brain Alliance (ABA) is an initiative of the Australian Academy of Science with a vision to coordinate and boost strategic brain research across Australia. The goal is to lead paradigm-changing research into the brain and its disorders, in collaboration with global brain initiatives. Since its establishment in February 2016, the ABA has successfully united researchers across the breadth of Australia’s neuroscience and behavioral science communities, with early involvement of both the Australasian Neuroscience Society and the Australian Psychological Society, and the support of over 28 member organizations engaged in brain research. This alliance has developed an integrative brain research agenda that builds on Australia’s strengths, with the aim of revolutionizing our understanding of the brain through a coordinated and collective effort. The ABA’s vision is to create a program with broad appeal by ensuring that research and infrastructure are developed in conjunction with government, funding agencies, industry, and philanthropic organizations. The goal is to secure investment in an Australian Brain Initiative (ABI), with a mission of creating an innovative and healthy nation by cracking the brain’s code. The overarching goal of the ABI is to “crack the brain’s code.” This is defined as understanding the mechanisms or “codes” that underlie how neural circuitry develops, how it encodes and retrieves information, how it underpins complex behaviors, and how it adapts to external and internal changes (see Figure 1). Discoveries in each of these areas will be essential for successfully achieving the following four grand challenges, which lie at the heart of the initiative:(1)To optimize and restore healthy brain function throughout life,(2)To develop neural interfaces to record and control brain activity to restore function,(3)To understand the neural basis of learning across the lifespan, and(4)To deliver new insights into brain-inspired computing. As other brain initiatives have recognized, brain science is still in a discovery phase whereby understanding basic nervous system structure and function is a crucial precursor to delivering meaningful outcomes. Increasingly, it is being realized that investment in basic research, both technological and experimental, is essential for the discovery of innovative solutions in areas such as health, education, and 21st century industries (Kosik et al., 2016Kosik K.S. Sejnowski T.J. Raichle M.E. Ciechanover A. Baltimore D. Science. 2016; 353: 872-873Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, the widely acknowledged “valley of death” in translation is testament to the fact that basic research alone is not enough. While Australia’s recent record in moving from discovery to application is poor (Watt, 2015Watt, I.J. (2015). https://www.education.gov.au/review-research-policy-and-funding-arrangements-0.Google Scholar), we have demonstrated successes in a number of disciplines, including in the convergence of basic neuroscience with engineering (see Playing to Our Strengths, below). This is an area of focus for the ABI and one that the ABA believes can play a key role in Australia’s future prosperity. To facilitate the translation of fundamental science into practical outcomes, we propose a new approach that incentivizes and enables a collaborative discovery process between industry, universities, and other research institutions. Specifically, we suggest that dedicated, multidisciplinary science incubators be set up to facilitate linkage between discovery and industry. The expectation is that this will lead to a pipeline of applications that stem from the foundations of blue-sky brain research. This approach will enable new and existing companies to capitalize on the work of the ABI as well as other large-scale brain initiatives, which are united in their aspiration for discoveries that will help crack the brain’s code. The results will drive innovation in developing new devices, diagnostic methods, and interventions for health and education, and spur the establishment of new industries (Figure 2). For a country of its size—just 24 million people—Australia has a strong history in neuroscience and neurotechnology. In 1948, John Cade discovered the therapeutic efficacy of lithium in treating bipolar disorder, a drug that remains the treatment of choice for this patient population. In 1963, John Eccles shared the Nobel Prize for work on the ionic mechanisms of neuronal inhibition and excitation at the Australian National University. In 1978, Graeme Clark’s research at the University of Melbourne led to the first successful cochlear implant and to the founding in 1981 of Cochlear Limited, a company that Forbes magazine named one of the world’s most innovative companies in 2011. In 1983, Alan Finkel—now Australia’s Chief Scientist—founded Axon Instruments (subsequently bought by Molecular Devices) to commercialize devices he developed for making high-resolution electrical recordings from neurons. More recently, a start-up company, Saluda Medical, founded by ex-Cochlear scientist John Parker, has developed a closed-loop spinal cord implant for chronic pain management (Crow, 2016Crow J.M. Nature. 2016; 535: S4-S6Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The device, currently in clinical trials, has the potential to change the lives of the 1 in 5 people who experience chronic pain. Australian psychologists have also made significant advances in our understanding of cognition and behavior. Several national centers have been established with the goal of understanding a range of cognitive processes—including attention, learning and memory, language and reading, and decision making—as well as the neural circuitry that regulates these processes. Researchers in these centers have highlighted the key role of attention in the encoding of new information and the importance of computational modeling approaches for understanding simple and complex behavior. The outcomes of this work are already being felt in the community. For example, Australian expertise in models of complex processes in reading have contributed to education through the new National School Curriculum. Capabilities in the genomic analysis of patients with neurological and mental illnesses and access to well-characterized cohorts of participants are also areas of research strength in Australia. For example, twin and family studies led by Sam Berkovic and Ingrid Scheffer at the University of Melbourne, utilizing the Australian Twin Registry, have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis underlying many forms of epilepsy (Vadlamudi et al., 2014Vadlamudi L. Milne R.L. Lawrence K. Heron S.E. Eckhaus J. Keay D. Connellan M. Torn-Broers Y. Howell R.A. Mulley J.C. et al.Neurology. 2014; 83: 1042-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, Australia possesses a well-organized and established infrastructure for longitudinal analysis of health data, with a number of unique cohort-based programs allowing genetic, epigenetic, and other biomarkers of health and disease to be measured over an individual’s lifetime. Our capacities in these fields have helped guide the areas of focus for the ABI. In many ways, they are complementary to brain initiatives in progress, or in development, in the U.S., Europe, Japan, China, Canada, and other countries (see this issue of Neuron). Australian brain researchers lead internationally competitive research programs across many areas of neuroscience such as brain development, the aging brain, neurogenetics, and the physiological processes of brain and nervous system function. The ABI aims to build on this expertise while facilitating creative new approaches to understanding brain function. Deciphering how the brain encodes, retrieves, and utilizes information is essential for the development of novel treatments and interventions for brain disorders. In addition, it will enable advances in neurotechnology and brain-inspired computing. Achieving these goals will require the merging of historically distinct scientific disciplines such as engineering, chemistry, physics, and computer science with neuroscience and psychology in so-called “convergence science” (Sharp et al., 2016Sharp, P., Jacks, T., and Hockfield, S. (2016). http://www.convergencerevolution.net/2016-report.Google Scholar). Currently, science is funded in Australia through small, individual investigator project grants or through multi-investigator Program and Centre grants that are divided into either medical research (funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council) or non-medical research (funded by the Australian Research Council). The ABA proposes to transform the Australian brain research landscape by establishing a framework to bring together existing brain researchers and scientists from other disciplines to “crack the brain’s code.” This will require alternate funding models in which discipline barriers are broken down, and which can accommodate the scale of the initiative being proposed. In this way, the ABI will complement rather than replace the current government-funded activities in brain research. The ABI must ensure that its proposed brain research agenda is aligned with the Australian Government’s focus on ensuring industry and public good outcomes from research. Indeed, the challenge of achieving a significant publicly funded research initiative at a time of fiscal restraint provided the impetus for the ABA to step up and demonstrate how brain science can help grow the Australian economy. A major goal of the ABI is therefore to ensure that discoveries in the brain and behavioral sciences form the foundation for improving health and education, stimulating new industries, and creating new jobs. To achieve these objectives, we believe the ABI must provide not only the knowledge, but also the organizational structures for generating new industries and treatments for brain disease. In concrete terms this will involve directing new funding to key priority-driven research areas (see Figure 1) and incubator-like facilities to link research and industry. Critically, it will also mean retaining and building the Australian brain research workforce through education and training infrastructure. This will occur in part through targeted fellowships that already exist in Australia, but also through new training grants in convergence neuroscience. The ABA will also prioritize engagement with the international brain research community, public outreach, and policy initiatives that address the rapidly moving field of neuroethics (Farah, 2015Farah M.J. Neuron. 2015; 86: 34-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Global brain initiatives aim to understand the neural basis of cognition and brain function, enabling better diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases. These are lofty goals. Brain scientists must address these issues by developing research strategies that prepare the public and governments for what can be achieved in the short-to-medium term. It is important to communicate to our stakeholders about our aspirational goals but also those goals that will create impact in the short term. For example, one identified grand challenge of the ABA is to understand the neural basis of learning to provide better education and learning outcomes across the lifespan. We chose learning because it will have profound outcomes for the Australian community and will lead to a greater understanding of brain function in other domains. It is now well established that the aging population will require better ways of maintaining a healthy brain for as long as possible, which would reduce the impact of dementia and lead to major economic benefits. A definition of a healthy brain is one in which the person has the capacity and motivation to learn and apply new information. This goal is perfectly compatible with ways of understanding and optimizing how the brain learns in childhood and can be adapted for every stage of life to promote healthy brain function. A deeper understanding of how the brain learns, retains, and retrieves information will also stimulate improvements in brain-inspired computing. It is for these reasons that the ABA has singled out learning as one of the research grand challenges. A specific goal is to develop an evidence-based online learning assessment for each stage of life that measures and characterizes a person’s learning strengths and abilities on an individual basis. This would be the first step in identifying areas with the most potential for improvement and therefore areas to target for intervention, resulting in significant economic and health benefits. In April 2017, the ABA will hold a conference and a series of workshops at the Australian Academy of Science in Canberra, the nation’s capital. The objective of the conference is to present and discuss the ABI with the science community, government, and public and to offer an opportunity for further broad input into the ABI research agenda. The essential next steps for the development of the ABI are:(1)To identify suitable goals for the ABI with defined end-points,(2)To engage potential industry partners in the ABI,(3)To develop a research strategy that responds to the needs of the community, and(4)To ensure that the research agenda will deliver in priority areas. Successfully incorporating these areas into the ABI will provide Australian neuroscience with a research strategy that is on par with, and complementary to, major brain initiatives being developed around the world, and that delivers major benefits to the Australian community (see Box 1).Box 1Summary of the Australian Brain AllianceGovernanceThe Australian Brain Alliance (ABA) is led by a steering committee comprised of Australia’s leading neuroscientists and psychologists, chaired by Emeritus Professor Patricia Michie.HistoryThe ABA was established in February 2016 under the auspices of the Australian Academy of Science with founding members including the Academy's National Committee on Brain and Mind and the peak bodies of the Australasian Neuroscience Society and the Australian Psychological Society.

DYRK1A was considered to play important roles in the pathogenesis of DS and Alzheimer's disease; however, the degradation mechanism of DYRK1A was still unclear. In this study, we found that DYRK1A was degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in HEK293 cells. The N terminus of DYRK1A that was highly unstable in HEK293 cells contributed to proteolysis of DYRK1A. E3 ligase SCFβTrCP mediated ubiquitination and promoted degradation of DYRK1A through an unconserved binding motif (49SDQQVSALS57) lying in the N terminus. Any Ser-Ala substitution in this motif could decrease the binding between DYRK1A and β-transducin repeat containing protein (βTrCP), resulting in stabilization of DYRK1A. We also found DYRK1A protein was elevated in the G0/G1 phase and decreased in the S and G2/M phase, which was negatively correlated to βTrCP levels in the HEK293 cell cycle. Knockdown of βTrCP caused arrest of the G0/G1 phase, which could be partly rescued by down-regulation of DYRK1A.

DYRK1A, a member of the dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase family, located on chromosome 21, was reported to be overexpressed and responsible for nervous defects in patients with Down syndrome (DS) 2The abbreviations used are: DS, Down syndrome; AD, Alzheimer's disease; λ-PPase, λ-protein phosphatase; aa, amino acid; Lac, lactacystin; CHX, cycloheximide; qRT, quantitative RT; REST, RE1 silencing transcription factor; APP, amyloid protein precursor; LB, Lewy body; co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; F, forward; R, reverse; DN, dominant negative; NT, N terminus; CT, C terminus; βTrCP, β-transducin repeat containing protein; NPC, neural progenitor cell; EdU, 5-ethynyl-2′. 2The abbreviations used are: DS, Down syndrome; AD, Alzheimer's disease; λ-PPase, λ-protein phosphatase; aa, amino acid; Lac, lactacystin; CHX, cycloheximide; qRT, quantitative RT; REST, RE1 silencing transcription factor; APP, amyloid protein precursor; LB, Lewy body; co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; F, forward; R, reverse; DN, dominant negative; NT, N terminus; CT, C terminus; βTrCP, β-transducin repeat containing protein; NPC, neural progenitor cell; EdU, 5-ethynyl-2′.

Recent studies provided evidence that neural functional defects in DS could be due to proliferative impairment of neural progenitor cells.

As one of the key genes implicated in DS, DYRK1A was considered to be involved in the proliferative regulation of NPCs. Studies showed that overexpression of DYRK1A could inhibit proliferation and promote cell cycle exit of NPCs by phosphorylation on several cell cycle regulators, including cyclin D1 (12.Yabut O.

However, haploinsufficency of DYRK1A could lead to impaired longevity of neural stem cells, resulting in reduced self-renewal and reservoir of neural stem cells (15.Hämmerle B. Ulin E. Guimera J.

These studies indicate the importance of maintaining the appropriate protein level of DYRK1A in neural development. Our recent study showed that RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST) regulated DYRK1A gene transcription, and both the overexpression and down-regulation of DYRK1A reduced REST levels, further emphasizing the appropriate protein level of DYRK1A for cellular functions (17.Lu M.

Nearly all DS individuals showed typical features of AD, such as senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in their early 40s, making DS an ideal model for AD research (18.Tanzi R.E. Neuropathology in the Down's syndrome brain.Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 31-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Studies showed that DYRK1A could phosphorylate the amyloid protein precursor on Thr-668 (19.Ryoo S.R. Cho H.J. Lee H.W. Jeong H.K. Radnaabazar C. Kim Y.S. Kim M.J. Son M.Y. Seo H. Chung S.H.

Phosphorylation by DYRK1A could facilitate cleavage of APP by the β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (23.Lee M.S. Kao S.C. Lemere C.A. Xia W. Tseng H.C. Zhou Y. Neve R. Ahlijanian M.K. Tsai L.H.

Dis. 2005; 20: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), leading to increased production of amyloid-β. DYRK1A-mediated phosphorylation could disrupt the normal biological effect of Tau and make it much more preferable to aggregate (22.Liu F. Liang Z. Wegiel J. Hwang Y.W. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. Ramakrishna N. Gong C.X. Overexpression of Dyrk1A contributes to neurofibrillary degeneration in Down syndrome.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The roles of DYRK1A in AD pathogenesis were still not clear. Nonetheless, histological studies showed that there were significantly more DYRK1A-positive cells in AD brains than normal controls (25.Ferrer I. Barrachina M. Puig B. Martínez de Lagrán M. Martí E. Avila J. Dierssen M. Constitutive Dyrk1A is abnormally expressed in Alzheimer disease, Down syndrome, Pick disease, and related transgenic models.Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 20: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The protein level of DYRK1A was also remarkably up-regulated in the sporadic AD cortex, compared with normal individuals (25.Ferrer I. Barrachina M. Puig B. Martínez de Lagrán M. Martí E. Avila J. Dierssen M. Constitutive Dyrk1A is abnormally expressed in Alzheimer disease, Down syndrome, Pick disease, and related transgenic models.Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 20: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanism causing abnormal up-regulation of DYRK1A in AD brains was still unclear. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, one of the main routes for protein destruction in eukaryotic cells, has been implicated in maintaining normal functions of nervous systems. Accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates or aggregates has been reported in AD and other neural degenerative diseases (26.Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway.Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar), implying that ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated protein degradation was impaired during the pathogenesis of neural degeneration. DYRK1A showed strong gene dosage effect, and its transcription and translation were strictly regulated (27.Dierssen M. de Lagrán M.M. DYRK1A (dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and -regulated kinase 1A): a gene with dosage effect during development and neurogenesis.ScientificWorldJournal. 2006; 6: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As described above, DYRK1A overexpression in DS patients was due to the extra copy of the DYRK1A gene. However, generally AD patients had normal gene copy number, suggesting that disrupted proteolysis could be responsible for DYRK1A increments in AD patients. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of DYRK1A degradation was still unclarified. In the ubiquitin-proteasome system, ubiquitin was sequentially catalyzed by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3) to be covalently linked to Lys residues of substrates, forming a degradation signal that could be recognized by 26S proteasome (26.Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway.Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). SCFβTrCP was the most frequently studied ubiquitin ligase. It could specifically bind to the DpSGXXpS motif, where serine residues were phosphorylated, and subsequently mediated by ubiquitination of substrates (28.Frescas D. Pagano M. Deregulated proteolysis by the F-box proteins SKP2 and β-TrCP: tipping the scales of cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 29.Low T.Y. Peng M. Magliozzi R. Mohammed S. Guardavaccaro D. Heck A.J. A systems-wide screen identifies substrates of the SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase.Sci. Signal. 2014; 7: rs8Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin cluster covalently connected to substrates functioned as a degradation signal and could be recognized by proteasome for degradation (26.Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway.Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). SCFβTrCP exerted its roles in neural development by regulating the stability of the RE1-silencing transcription factor, which was a transcriptional repressor of neural genes in non-neuronal cells. SCFβTrCP promoted neuronal differentiation by targeting REST for degradation in the proteasome (30.Westbrook T.F. Hu G. Ang X.L. Mulligan P. Pavlova N.N. Liang A. Leng Y. Maehr R. Shi Y. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. SCFβ-TRCP controls oncogenic transformation and neural differentiation through REST degradation.Nature. 2008; 452: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In our previous study, we found that dysregulation of DYRK1A could impair REST protein stability, making REST vulnerable for proteolysis (17.Lu M. Zheng L. Han B. Wang L. Wang P. Liu H. Sun X. REST regulates DYRK1A transcription in a negative feedback loop.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 10755-10763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, more studies are needed to uncover whether there is an association between SCFβTrCP and DYRK1A in neural development. In this study, we found DYRK1A was degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in HEK293 cells. Its N terminus rather than the PEST-rich region was responsible for the proteasome proteolysis. SCFβTrCP bound to the 49SDQQVSALS57 motif lying in the N terminus of DYRK1A, mediating the ubiquitination of DYRK1A. Knockdown of βTrCP up-regulated DYRK1A protein levels and prolonged its half-life. We also observed that DYRK1A protein but not mRNA was elevated in the G0/G1 phase and decreased during S and G2/M phase, negatively correlated with the changes of βTrCP in HEK293 cell cycle. Our study proposed a new regulatory role of DYRK1A proteolysis in HEK293 cell cycle progression. To determine the half-life of DYRK1A, HEK293 cells were pulse-chased with CHX. Cells were harvested every 12 h after CHX treatment, and DYRK1A protein was analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, DYRK1A protein gradually decreased in a time-dependent manner after the addition of CHX. The half-life of DYRK1A in HEK293 cells was 14.07 h by the following calculation, Qt = Q0·(1/2)t/H, where Qt indicates the protein level at t time; Q0 indicates the protein level at 0 h; and H indicates half-life (Fig. 1A). Ubiquitin-proteasome pathway was responsible for degradation of most proteins in eukaryotic cells. To examine whether the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway was involved in thedegradation of DYRK1A, HEK293 cells were transfected with pDAYRK1A-MycFLAG and treated with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Western blotting results clearly showed that treatment with lactacystin significantly increased DYRK1A protein level in a time-dependent (Fig. 1B) and dosage-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). Lactacystin treatment also markedly decreased the degradation of DYRK1A in CHX chase assay (Fig. 1D). These data demonstrated that ubiquitin-proteasome participated in the degradation of DYRK1A. Because ubiquitination was the essential step for ubiquitin-proteasome pathway-mediated protein degradation, we next investigated whether DYRK1A could be ubiquitinated using co-IP assay. Endogenous DYRK1A was pulled down with DYRK1A monoclonal antibody, and ubiquitinated proteins were detected by ubiquitin antibody. Western blotting exhibited a smeared band, the typical feature of ubiquitination (Fig. 1E), implying that DYRK1A could be ubiquitinated in HEK293 cells. Taken together, our results revealed that DYRK1A was ubiquitinated and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In cell cycle progression, E3 ligase SCFβTrCP showed the highest activity in S phase, and βTrCP was specifically attenuated in the G0/G1 phase and increased in the S phase, implying the important roles of SCFβTrCP during G0/G1-S phase transition. DYRK1A had been reported to be involved in regulating cell proliferation. We previously showed that overexpression of DYRK1A could cause proliferative inhibition and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, indicating that down-regulation of DYRK1A could be necessary for G0/G1-S phase transition (31.Liu Q. Liu N. Zang S. Liu H. Wang P. Ji C. Sun X. Tumor suppressor DYRK1A effects on proliferation and chemoresistance of AML cells by downregulating c-Myc.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e98853Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we synchronized HEK293 cells by nocodazole. After 12 h of treatment with nocodazole, more than 90% of cells were arrested at G2/M phase (Fig. 2A). Cell cycle was recovered with fresh medium. We found DYRK1A protein showed the highest expression level at the G0/G1 phase and was comparatively reduced at the S and G2/M phase (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, βTrCP protein level was negatively correlated to DYRK1A, exhibiting an inverse profile in cell cycle (Pearson r = −0.5655, p = 0.0442, Fig. 2B). The down-regulation of DYRK1A during G0/G1-S phase transition could be due to enhanced degradation, as the mRNA level of DYRK1A did not change significantly in cell cycle (Fig. 2C). Then we established a HEK293 cell line stably expressing βTrCP shRNAs (Fig. 2D), and we evaluated the cell cycle of this cell line. FACS results showed that βTrCP shRNAs reduced the ratio of cells in S phase by 9.12% and increased the ratio of cells in G0/G1 phase by 11.53%. When transfected with DYRK1A interfering constructs, the cell cycle arrest induced by βTrCP knockdown was partly rescued (Fig. 2E). To further confirm our results, we performed an EdU staining assay. Flow cytometry analysis showed that knockdown of βTrCP markedly decreased positive-staining cells from 40.51 to 29.03%, which could be rescued by DYRK1A shRNA transfection (37.90%) (Fig. 2F). Our studies suggested that DYRK1A was inversely regulated by E3 ligase SCFβTrCP and played important roles in cell cycle progression. As the key component of the SCFβTrCP complex, F-box protein βTrCP directly bound to target proteins independent of the SCF complex, promoting ubiquitination of target proteins (26.Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway.Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). To investigate whether SCFβTrCP was involved in DYRK1A degradation, we first applied co-IP assay to detect the interaction between βTrCP and DYRK1A. Co-IP results showed that both exogenous βTrCP and DYRK1A could be efficiently precipitated by βTrCP antibody (Fig. 3A). To better validate the interaction between βTrCP and DYRK1A, we performed co-IP using HEK293 cells without any treatment. This experiment also revealed that endogenous βTrCP and DYRK1A could be precipitated simultaneously (Fig. 3B). These results indicated that βTrCP interacted with DYRK1A. To demonstrate whether SCFβTrCP was involved in DYRK1A protein degradation, we interrupted SCFβTrCP by knocking down βTrCP expression with siRNAs (Fig. 3C). βTrCP siRNA significantly increased the DYRK1A protein level to 218.51 ± 33.61%, compared with control (Fig. 3D). To further confirm the roles of βTrCP in the degradation of DYRK1A, we assessed the ubiquitination status of DYRK1A when βTrCP was knocked down or overexpressed. We infected HEK293 cells with βTrCP shRNA-expressing lentiviral particles (Fig. 3E). Our results showed βTrCP down-regulation led to a significant decrease of ubiquitinated endogenous DYRK1A levels to 61.72 ± 8.74% (Fig. 3F), whereas overexpression of βTrCP remarkably promoted the ubiquitination of endogenous DYRK1A to 142.73 ± 26.98% (Fig. 3G). To validate whether DYRK1A up-regulation upon βTrCP interference was due to impaired proteolysis, we determined the DYRK1A turnover rate in HEK293 cells with the βTrCP knocked out. CHX chase assay showed that both the exogenous and endogenous DYRK1A proteins (Fig. 3, H and I, respectively) were markedly stabilized in shβTrCP stably transfected HEK293 cells, implying an important role of βTrCP in the proteolytic process of DYRK1A. The SCFβTrCP E3 ligase complex was mainly composed of four core components as follows: Skp1; F-box protein (βTrCP); cullin; and Rbx1. βTrCP specifically interacted with target proteins, whereas cullin acted as the structural scaffold linking the N terminus of Skp1 to the C terminus of Rbx1 (28.Frescas D. Pagano M. Deregulated proteolysis by the F-box proteins SKP2 and β-TrCP: tipping the scales of cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). To disrupt the normal function of SCFβTrCP complex, we constructed dominant negative mutants of cullin, in which only the N-terminal 1–452-aa residues of Cullin1 or 20–427-aa residues of Cullin2 were expressed (DN-Cullin1 and DN-Cullin2). These dominant negative forms of cullin, serving as the decoy partner, could assemble a complex with Skp1 and F-box protein (βTrCP), while losing the ability to bind RBX1 and E2 enzyme, leading to failure of ubiquitination. When overexpressed with DN-Cullin1 or DN-Cullin2, the protein level of DYRK1A was increased to 207.44 ± 30.17 and 213.73 ± 34.50%, compared with control vector, respectively (Fig. 3J). Our studies provided solid evidence that E3 ligase SCFβTrCP was responsible for DYRK1A proteolysis. DYRK1A protein was composed of the following four domains: N terminus (NT, 1–149 aa); the kinase catalytic domain (150–477 aa); the PEST-rich region (PEST, 478–516 aa); and the C-terminal (CT, 517–754 aa) (Fig. 4A) (32.Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schürmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.G. Dyrk, a dual specificity protein kinase with unique structural features whose activity is dependent on tyrosine residues between subdomains VII and VIII.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The PEST-rich region was a peptide composed with proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T) residues, commonly acting as protein degradation signal (33.Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Amino acid sequences common to rapidly degraded proteins: the PEST hypothesis.Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). Because DYRK1A possessed a PEST-rich region comprising 478–516-aa residues, it is predicted that DYRK1A could be degraded rapidly with a short half-life in cells. We determined whether the half-life of DYRK1A was dramatically changed when the PEST-rich region was truncated (Fig. 4A). CHX chase assay showed that deletion of the PEST-rich region did not significantly alter the degradation rate, compared with wild type DYRK1A (Fig. 4B), indicating other domains of DYRK1A could be responsible for DYRK1A proteolysis. For this purpose, a series of DYRK1A truncation mutants were constructed (Fig. 4A), and the relevant degradation rates were assessed by CHX chase assay. Compared with wild type DYRK1A, the degradation rate of DY-ΔCT was not significantly changed (Fig. 4C), whereas the degradation rate of DY-CT was notably prolonged (Fig. 4D), suggesting the C terminus did not play a significant role in DYRK1A degradation. Noticeably, we found that the N terminus of DYRK1A (DY-NT) was highly unstable and could be rapidly degraded in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4E), compared with other domains of DYRK1A. These results suggested the N terminus could play a vital role in regulating DYRK1A degradation. Considering the importance of E3 ligase SCFβTrCP and N terminus in the degradation of DYRK1A, we proposed that SCFβTrCP could directly bind to the N terminus of DYRK1A. To confirm this, we carried out co-IP assay between βTrCP and a series of DYRK1A truncation mutants (Fig. 4A). Results in Fig. 5, A and B, show that only DYRK1A truncation mutants containing the N terminus could be co-immunoprecipitated with βTrCP, implying that the SCFβTrCP complex specifically bound to the N terminus of DYRK1A. To further identify the exact residues to which βTrCP bound, we constructed another two truncation mutants, which lacked the N-terminal 33 aa (DY-ΔN33) or 71 aa (DY-ΔN71) residues (Fig. 5C). The co-IP results showed that interaction between DY-ΔN33 and βTrCP was negligibly affected (Fig. 5D, 5th lane versus 4th lane), but the DY-ΔN71 band co-immunoprecipitated with βTrCP was markedly reduced (Fig. 5D, 6th lane versus 4th lane), suggesting that the region of 34–71 aa contained the degradation degron. To further verify this degradation degron, the CHX assay was performed in HEK293 cells transfected with the two deletion constructs. The CHX chase assay demonstrated that the degradation rate of DY-ΔN33 was similar to that of wild type DYRK1A, whereas DY-NΔ71 degradation was noticeably impaired, revealed by slower decrement after CHX addition (Fig. 5E). Collectively, our results suggested the binding site of βTrCP on the DYRK1A protein lying in the N-terminal 33–71-aa residues.

This article describes Brain Canada’s “One Brain One Community” approach and its views on international collaboration and the future of brain research. Building on the long history of neuroscience in Canada, Brain Canada is accelerating the funding of transformative brain research across Canada, primarily through an innovative $240-million CAN public-private partnership with the Government of Canada and numerous partners. This article describes Brain Canada’s “One Brain One Community” approach and its views on international collaboration and the future of brain research. Canada’s contributions to brain research began in 1934 when Dr. Wilder Penfield founded the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital (MNI). The MNI became the birthplace of neuroscience, and the largest center dedicated to the brain in Canada and among the largest in the world. A seamless integration of research and patient care was and remains the vision and is a model that has been adopted around the world. Since then, various brain research centers have been established across Canada, including the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health (British Columbia), Hotchkiss Brain Institute (Alberta), Krembil Neuroscience Centre (Ontario), Rotman Research Institute (Ontario), and the Brain Repair Centre (Nova Scotia), which are producing some of the most significant discoveries in the field. Much, however, remains to be done to unlock the mysteries of the brain. Brain Canada was founded nearly 20 years ago by a group of business and science leaders with a bold vision to transform brain research in Canada. They recognized the burden of brain disorders on individuals, families, caregivers, the economy, and society. In Canada, one in three individuals—over 11 million people—will face a psychiatric disease, addiction, neurological disorder, or brain or spinal cord injury at some point in their lives (NeuroScience Canada, 2006NeuroScience Canada (2006). The Case for Canada’s Increased Investment in Neuroscience Research. http://www.cnsfederation.org/uploads/content/advocacy/documents/reports-case-for-increased-investment.pdf.Google Scholar). They further recognized that the investment in brain research was severely disproportionate to the burden of disease and lagged behind investments in other disease areas, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. These leaders created Brain Canada, then known as NeuroScience Canada, as a non-profit organization, the first of its kind in Canada, dedicated to increasing funding across the entire spectrum of brain research and changing the way we do research (Box 1). Over a period of 10 years, Brain Canada established a track record of funding teams of researchers pursuing paradigm-changing ideas, at a time when most funding was supporting individual researchers. Early evidence from the first five team grants showed that this approach did indeed accelerate breakthroughs and lead to new networks of researchers who had not previously worked together.Box 1Funding InitiativesHistory•Nearly 20 years ago, a group of business and science leaders had a bold vision: to transform brain research in Canada.•Brain Canada (previously called NeuroScience Canada) was established to harness the collaborative energy of Canadian research and to enable world-class researchers to pursue paradigm-changing ideas.•In 2011, the Government of Canada (Health Canada) established a public-private partnership with Brain Canada to create the Canada Brain Research Fund, a $200-million fund in which $100 million raised by Brain Canada and its partners is matched on a 1:1 basis with new public funding.•In 2016, the Government of Canada committed an additional $20 million in matching funds, bringing the total Canada Brain Research Fund to $240 million.Mission•Brain Canada's vision is to understand the brain, in health and illness, to improve lives and achieve societal impact.•Brain Canada is achieving its vision by:•Increasing the scale and scope of funding to accelerate the pace of Canadian brain research•Creating a collective commitment to brain research across the public, private, and voluntary sectors•Delivering transformative, original, and outstanding research programsScope•Brain Canada enables multidisciplinary, collaborative, high-risk, high-reward research.•Brain Canada funds across all brain science and all stages in the research process, from basic science through to population health.•The Canada Brain Research Fund supports three types of grants:•Multi-Investigator Research Initiatives (MIRI) (team grants)•Platform support grants•Training awardsReview Process•Funding recipients are selected through open and partnered competitions and rigorous international peer review.•An exception is made for training awards where knowledge of the Canadian context is essential.Funding•To date, Brain Canada has invested $176.6 million to support 168 projects, 750+ researchers across Canada, connecting 75+ disciplines and 70 institutions. •Nearly 20 years ago, a group of business and science leaders had a bold vision: to transform brain research in Canada.•Brain Canada (previously called NeuroScience Canada) was established to harness the collaborative energy of Canadian research and to enable world-class researchers to pursue paradigm-changing ideas.•In 2011, the Government of Canada (Health Canada) established a public-private partnership with Brain Canada to create the Canada Brain Research Fund, a $200-million fund in which $100 million raised by Brain Canada and its partners is matched on a 1:1 basis with new public funding.•In 2016, the Government of Canada committed an additional $20 million in matching funds, bringing the total Canada Brain Research Fund to $240 million. •Brain Canada's vision is to understand the brain, in health and illness, to improve lives and achieve societal impact.•Brain Canada is achieving its vision by:•Increasing the scale and scope of funding to accelerate the pace of Canadian brain research•Creating a collective commitment to brain research across the public, private, and voluntary sectors•Delivering transformative, original, and outstanding research programs •Brain Canada enables multidisciplinary, collaborative, high-risk, high-reward research.•Brain Canada funds across all brain science and all stages in the research process, from basic science through to population health.•The Canada Brain Research Fund supports three types of grants:•Multi-Investigator Research Initiatives (MIRI) (team grants)•Platform support grants•Training awards •Funding recipients are selected through open and partnered competitions and rigorous international peer review.•An exception is made for training awards where knowledge of the Canadian context is essential."

https://openalex.org/W2548196308,"Background Several studies have shown that total depressive symptom scores in the general population approximate an exponential pattern, except for the lower end of the distribution. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) consists of 20 items, each of which may take on four scores: “rarely,” “some,” “occasionally,” and “most of the time.” Recently, we reported that the item responses for 16 negative affect items commonly exhibit exponential patterns, except for the level of “rarely,” leading us to hypothesize that the item responses at the level of “rarely” may be related to the non-exponential pattern typical of the lower end of the distribution. To verify this hypothesis, we investigated how the item responses contribute to the distribution of the sum of the item scores. Methods Data collected from 21,040 subjects who had completed the CES-D questionnaire as part of a Japanese national survey were analyzed. To assess the item responses of negative affect items, we used a parameter r, which denotes the ratio of “rarely” to “some” in each item response. The distributions of the sum of negative affect items in various combinations were analyzed using log-normal scales and curve fitting. Results The sum of the item scores approximated an exponential pattern regardless of the combination of items, whereas, at the lower end of the distributions, there was a clear divergence between the actual data and the predicted exponential pattern. At the lower end of the distributions, the sum of the item scores with high values of r exhibited higher scores compared to those predicted from the exponential pattern, whereas the sum of the item scores with low values of r exhibited lower scores compared to those predicted. Conclusions The distributional pattern of the sum of the item scores could be predicted from the item responses of such items."
https://openalex.org/W2547085754,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a satellite virus of hepatitis B virus (HBV). HDV genome encodes two forms of hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), small HDAg (HDAg-S), which is required for viral replication, and large HDAg (HDAg-L), which is essential for viral assembly. HDAg-L is identical to HDAg-S except that it bears a 19-amino acid extension at the C terminus. Both HDAgs contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS), but only HDAg-L contains a CRM1-independent nuclear export signal at its C terminus. The nuclear export activity of HDAg-L is important for HDV particle formation. However, the mechanisms of HDAg-L-mediated nuclear export of HDV ribonucleoprotein are not clear. In this study, the host cellular RNA export complex TAP-Aly was found to form a complex with HDAg-L, but not with an export-defective HDAg-L mutant, in which Pro205 was replaced by Ala. HDAg-L was found to colocalize with TAP and Aly in the nucleus. The C-terminal domain of HDAg-L was shown to directly interact with the N terminus of TAP, whereas an HDAg-L mutant lacking the NLS failed to interact with full-length TAP. In addition, small hairpin RNA-mediated down-regulation of TAP or Aly reduced nuclear export of HDAg-L and assembly of HDV virions. Furthermore, a peptide, TAT-HDAg-L(198–210), containing the 10-amino acid TAT peptide and HDAg-L(198–210), inhibited the interaction between HDAg-L and TAP and blocked HDV virion assembly and secretion. These data demonstrate that formation and release of HDV particles are mediated by TAP and Aly."

This study investigated the association of n-3 and n-6 PUFA and BP in children and adolescents.In a subsample of 1267 children aged 2-9 years at baseline of the European IDEFICS (Identification and prevention of dietary- and lifestyle-induced health effects in children and infants) cohort whole blood fatty acids were measured by a validated gas chromatographic method. Systolic and diastolic BP was measured at baseline and after two and six years. Mixed-effects models were used to assess the associations between fatty acids at baseline and BP z-scores over time adjusting for relevant covariables. Models were further estimated stratified by sex and weight status.The baseline level of arachidonic acid was positively associated with subsequent systolic BP (β = 0.08, P = 0.002) and diastolic BP (β = 0.07, P<0.001). In thin/normal weight children, baseline alpha-linolenic (β = -1.13, P = 0.003) and eicosapentaenoic acid (β = -0.85, P = 0.003) levels were inversely related to baseline and also to subsequent systolic BP and alpha-linolenic acid to subsequent diastolic BP. In overweight/obese children, baseline eicosapentaenoic acid level was positively associated with baseline diastolic BP (β = 0.54, P = 0.005).Low blood arachidonic acid levels in the whole sample and high n-3 PUFA levels in thin/normal weight children are associated with lower and therefore healthier BP. The beneficial effects of high n-3 PUFA on BP were not observed in overweight/obese children, suggesting that they may have been overlaid by the unfavorable effects of excess weight."
