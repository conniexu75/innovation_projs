However, how cytokine signals mediate THi differentiation is unclear. We found that IL-6 functioned to up-regulate IL-23R and that IL-23 synergized with IL-6 in promoting THi generation. STAT3, activated by both IL-6 and IL-23, plays a critical role in THi development. A hyperactive form of STAT3 promoted THi development, whereas this differentiation process was greatly impaired in STAT3-deficient T cells. Moreover, STAT3 regulated the expression of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γ-T (RORγt), a THi-specific transcriptional regulator; STAT3 deficiency impaired RORγt expression and led to elevated expression of T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet) and Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3). Our data thus demonstrate a pathway whereby cytokines regulate THi differentiation through a selective STAT transcription factor that functions to regulate lineage-specific gene expression.

Upon activation, naive TH cells differentiate into effector cells that have been historically classified into two lineages, TH1 and TH2, based on their cytokine secretion and immune regulatory function (1Mosmann T.R. Coffman R.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 145-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (6816) Google Scholar, 2Dong C. Flavell R.A. Arthritis Res. 2000; 2: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). TH1 cells secret IFN-γ and regulate cellular immunity, whereas TH2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and mediate the humoral response. The cytokine microenvironment during TH activation determines TH effector differentiation through selective signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins (3Glimcher L.H. Murphy K.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1693-1711PubMed Google Scholar, 4Dong C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). TH1 differentiation and IFN-γ production is promoted by IL-12, a heterodimeric cytokine produced by activated antigen-presenting cells that signal through STAT4. The IFN-γ-STAT1 pathway in turn sustains TH1 development, leading to the induction of transcription factor T-bet. On the other hand, IL-4, secreted by activated T cells, drives TH2 polarization in a STAT6-dependent manner, resulting in activation of the transcription factor GATA3.Recently, a third subset of TH cells, named as THIL-17, TH17, or inflammatory TH (THi), which produce IL-17, was identified by us as well as other investigators to mediate a pathogenic inflammatory response (5Langrish C.L.

Chen Y. Blumenschein W.M. Mattson J. Basham B. Sedgwick J.D. McClanahan T. Kastelein R.A. Cua D.J. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (3207) Google Scholar, 7Harrington L.E.

IL-23, sharing a p40 unit with IL-12, has been first found to regulate IL-17 expression and the development or expansion of THi cells in vitro (5Langrish C.L. Chen Y. Blumenschein W.M. Mattson J.

More recently, several groups showed that TGF-β in the context of IL-6 and other inflammatory cytokines supports THi differentiation in vitro, independent of IL-23 (10Mangan P.R. Harrington L.E.

Dong C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5969-5972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). IL-1β and TNF-α may also be involved in promoting THi development or in regulating expression of IL-17 at the effector phase (11Veldhoen M. Hocking R.J. Atkins C.J. Locksley R.M. Stockinger B.

Med. 2006; 203: 1685-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar).The downstream signaling pathways, such as STAT, that selectively mediate THi generation are unclear. STAT1 appears to negatively regulate THi differentiation (7Harrington L.E. Hatton R.D. Mangan P.R. Turner H. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Weaver C.T. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (3759) Google Scholar), whereas STAT4 or STAT6 were not involved (6Park H. Li Z. Yang X.O. Chang S.H. Nurieva R. Wang Y.H. Wang Y. Hood L. Zhu Z. Tian Q. Dong C. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). Recently, Socs3-deficient T cells were found to exhibit enhanced IL-17 expression; this effect was associated with enhanced activity of STAT3 in response to IL-23 that could bind to IL-17 and IL-17F promoters (15Chen Z. Laurence A. Kanno Y. Pacher-Zavisin M. Zhu B.M. Tato C. Yoshimura A. Hennighausen L. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8137-8142Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). STAT3 has critical functions in the immune system, including control of dendritic cell production, inhibition of macrophage inflammatory signaling, and regulation of steady state and emergency granulopoiesis (16Laouar Y. Welte T. Fu X.-Y. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 2003; 19: 903-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 17Takeda K. Clausen B.E. Kaisho T. Tsujimura T. Terada N. Forster I.

Goldsmith M.A. Link D.C. Murray P.J. Watowich S.S. Blood. 2006; 108: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, the precise physiological function of STAT3 in THi lineage differentiation has not been directly addressed. Whether STAT5, another STAT protein that has been shown activated by IL-23R (19Parham C. Chirica M. Timans J. Vaisberg E. Travis M. Cheung J. Pflanz S. Zhang R. Singh K.P. Vega F. To W. Wagner J. O'Farrell A.-M. McClanahan T. Zurawski S. Hannum C. Gorman D. Rennick D.M. Kastelein R.A. de Waal Malefyt R. Moore K.W. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5699-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar), has any function in THi differentiation is also unclear.In this study, we show that IL-6 up-regulates expression of IL-23R and that IL-23 synergizes with IL-6 in promoting THi differentiation. Retroviral expression of a hyperactive STAT3 enhances THi cell development. STAT3 deficiency in CD4 T cells results in impaired THi development and a deficiency in RORγt, a THi-specific transcription factor recently identified (20Ivanov I.I. McKenzie B.S. Zhou L.

These data indicate that STAT3 is a cytokine-activated essential regulator in THi development.MATERIALS AND METHODSMice and Immunization—Il-6- and Ifng-deficient mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Stat3 fl and Tie2-Cre mice were generously provided by Drs. Takeda and Koni (21Koni P.A. Joshi S.K. Temann U.A. Olson D. Burkly L. Flavell R.A. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 4652-4660PubMed Google Scholar) and were bred to yield fl/Δ Cre+ and Cre–littermates as described (18Panopoulos A.D. Zhang L. Snow J.W. Jones D.M. Smith A.M. El Kasmi K.C. Liu F. Goldsmith M.A. Link D.C. Murray P.J. Watowich S.S. Blood. 2006; 108: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Mice were housed in the specific pathogen-free animal facility at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and the animal experiments were performed using protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. For immunization, Il-6 knock-out and C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with MOG35–55 peptide in CFA. 5–7 days later, splenocytes were collected from the immunized mice and restimulated with MOG peptide for 3 days. In the final 5 h, Golgi-stop (BD Biosciences) was added, and IL-17- and IFN-γ-producing cells were analyzed using a BD CytoFix/CytoPerm intracellular staining kit (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions.TH Differentiation—Naive CD4+ T cells were isolated from spleen and lymph nodes of various strains of mice by AutoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) selection of CD62L+ or FACS sorting of CD4+CD62L+CD44loCD25–T cells after enriching CD4+ T cells by negative selection using rat anti-mouse antibodies for CD8, B220, and I-A/I-E and Qiagen BioMag® goat anti-rat IgG beads. T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (2 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (2 μg/ml) and 50 units/ml IL-2 in the presence or absence of 20 ng/ml IL-6 (Peprotech), 50 ng/ml IL-23 (R&D systems), 2 ng/ml TGF-β (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 μg/ml anti-IL-4 (11B11), or 10 μg/ml anti-IFN-γ (XMG1.2), 10 ng/ml TNF-α, 10 ng/ml IL-1β, or cocktails of these stimuli, as indicated. 4 days after activation, cells were restimulated with 500 ng/ml ionomycin and 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of Golgi-stop for 5 h, after which IL-17- and IFN-γ-producing cells were analyzed using intracellular staining as described above. Intracellular staining for FoxP3 was performed by using a FoxP3 staining kit (eBioscience).Retroviral Transduction—STAT3C (a gift from J. Darnell's laboratory) (24Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H.

Bhattacharya D. Murphy T.L. Sha W.C. Murphy K.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Stat5A and Stat5A 1*6 sequences were cloned into a bicistronic retrovirus MSCV-IRES-GFP vector (26Pear W.S. Miller J.P. Xu L. Pui J.C. Soffer B. Quackenbush R.C. Pendergast A.M. Bronson R. Aster J.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Blood. 1998; 92: 3780-3792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the cloned gene and green fluorescent protein (GFP) is under murine stem cell virus (MSCV) promoter control. The ecotropic virus-producing cells GP+E86 (27Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were generated as described previously (28Wen R. Chen Y. Xue L. Schuman J. Yang S. Morris S.W. Wang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43654-43662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Naive CD4+ T cells were activated under the indicated conditions for 2 days and infected with viral supernatants produced by the stable lines as described previously (25Ouyang W. Ranganath S.H. Weindel K. Bhattacharya D. Murphy T.L. Sha W.C. Murphy K.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). 2–4 days after infection, the cells were tested for IL-17 and IFN-γ expression using intracellular staining. In some experiments, GFP+ cells were sorted by FACS and subjected to analysis for gene expression.Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was prepared from T cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript reverse transcriptase under priming of oligo(dT) (Invitrogen), and gene expression was examined in a Bio-Rad iCycler optical system using the iQ™ SYBR green real-time PCR kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). The data were normalized to β-actin reference. The primers used were (5′ to 3′): IFN-γ, forward, GATGCATTCATGAGTATTGCCAAGT, and reverse, GTGGACCACTCGGATGAGCTC; T-bet, forward, CAACAACCCCTTTGCCAAAG, and reverse, TCCCCCAAGCAGTTGACAGT; GATA3, forward, AGAACCGGCCCCTTATGAA, and reverse, AGTTCGCGCAGGATGTCC; and β-actin, forward, GACGGCCAGGTCATCACTATTG, and reverse, AGGAAGGCTGGAAAAGAGCC. The primers for IL-12Rβ2, IL-23R, IL-17, IL-17F, RORγt, Foxp3, and IL-22 were synthesized as described previously (7Harrington L.E. Hatton R.D. Mangan P.R. Turner H. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M.

IL-23 was previously shown to be important in the development or expansion of THi cells in vivo (5Langrish C.L. Chen Y. Blumenschein W.M. Mattson J. Basham B. Sedgwick J.D. McClanahan T. Kastelein R.A. Cua D.J. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (3207) Google Scholar), whereas IL-6 is potent in THi development in vitro and has recently been shown to be necessary in RORγt-dependent IL-17 expression in the lamina propria (20Ivanov I.I. McKenzie B.S. Zhou L. Tadokoro C.E. Lepelley A. Lafaille J.J. Cua D.J. Littman D.R. Cell. 2006; 126: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar). To further examine whether IL-6 is required for THi differentiation in vivo, C57BL/6 and Il-6 knock-out mice were immunized with MOG peptide and CFA. 5–7 days later, splenocytes collected from the immunized mice were restimulated with MOG peptide and stained for CD4, IL-17, and IFN-γ. In Il-6 knock-out mice, THi cells were greatly reduced relative to WT mice, whereas IFN-γ-producing TH1 cells were only moderately affected (Fig. 1A).IL-6 and IL-23 are thus both important in regulation of THi cells in vivo. We attempted to analyze their functional relationship during THi differentiation. Because IFN-γ has been shown as a potent inhibitor of THi differentiation (6Park H. Li Z. Yang X.O. Chang S.H. Nurieva R. Wang Y.H. Wang Y. Hood L. Zhu Z. Tian Q. Dong C. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar, 7Harrington L.E. Hatton R.D. Mangan P.R. Turner H. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Weaver C.T. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (3759) Google Scholar), we next isolated naive TH cells from IFN-γ-deficient mice and activated them with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the presence of different cytokines and/or cytokine-neutralizing antibodies. 4–5 days after activation, the differentiated cells were analyzed by intracellular staining. IL-6 increased the number of IL-17-expressing THi cells, which was more pronounced in the presence of anti-IL-4 or, even more dramatically, TGF-β (Fig. 1B). Although IL-23 was a poor inducer of THi differentiation by itself, the combination of IL-6 and IL-23 led to greatly enhanced development of THi cells (Fig. 1B). To substantiate the synergy between IL-6 and IL-23, we purified CD4+CD25-CD62LhiCD44lo naive TH cells from C57BL/6 mice and activated them with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the presence of IL-6 and/or IL-23 for 5 days and analyzed THi differentiation by intracellular staining. IL-6 weakly induced THi differentiation (Fig. 1C). Although IL-23 had no effect on its own, it synergized with IL-6 in promoting generation of IL-17-expressing TH cells (Fig. 1C). We also observed synergy of IL-6 and IL-23 in THi differentiation of naive OT-II cells activated with antigen-presenting cells in the presence or absence of TGF-β (data not shown). Our data thus not only support a unique function of IL-6 in initiating THi differentiation but also, more importantly, demonstrate a synergistic action of IL-6 and IL-23.To further understand why IL-23 only functions in IL-6-treated cells, we stimulated naive TH cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 48 h in the presence of IL-6 and/or IL-23 and examined expression of IL-23R by real-time RT-PCR analysis. Interestingly, whereas T cells after activation moderately up-regulated IL-23R mRNA in the presence or absence of IL-23, IL-6 increased the expression of IL-23R in activated T cells by >120-fold (Fig. 1D). Our above results altogether indicate that THi differentiation is initially mediated by IL-6, which induces IL-23 responsiveness to enhance this differentiationSTAT3 Hyperactivation Enhances THi Differentiation—STAT proteins are key factors mediating cytokine signals during TH1 and TH2 differentiation. Although STAT3 is an important target of IL-6, IL-23 has been shown to activate STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, and STAT5 proteins (19Parham C. Chirica M. Timans J. Vaisberg E. Travis M. Cheung J. Pflanz S. Zhang R. Singh K.P. Vega F. To W. Wagner J. O'Farrell A.-M. McClanahan T. Zurawski S. Hannum C. Gorman D. Rennick D.M. Kastelein R.A. de Waal Malefyt R. Moore K.W. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5699-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Since STAT1 and STAT4 are not involved in THi differentiation (6Park H. Li Z. Yang X.O. Chang S.H. Nurieva R. Wang Y.H. Wang Y. Hood L. Zhu Z. Tian Q. Dong C. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar, 7Harrington L.E. Hatton R.D. Mangan P.R. Turner H. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Weaver C.T. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (3759) Google Scholar), we first examined STAT5. We overexpressed WT (STAT5A WT) or a constitutively active form (STAT5A 1*6) (31Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L.-F. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) of STAT5A using the bicistronic retroviral vector MSCV-IRES-GFP during TH differentiation. Naive CD4+ T cells isolated from C57BL/6 mice were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and IL-2 in the presence of various polarizing cytokines or cytokine blockers, infected on day 2, and subsequently further differentiated under the polarizing conditions. On day 5, IL-17 expression was analyzed in transduced CD4+ cells. Under neutral or THi favorable conditions, neither WT STAT5A nor STAT5A 1*6 had any effect on THi development when compared with cells infected with a control virus (data not shown).We next went on to determine the role of STAT3, which could be activated by both IL-6 and IL-23 (18Panopoulos A.D. Zhang L. Snow J.W. Jones D.M. Smith A.M. El Kasmi K.C. Liu F. Goldsmith M.A. Link D.C. Murray P.J. Watowich S.S. Blood. 2006; 108: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 22Takeda K. Kaisho T. Yoshida N. Takeda J. Kishimoto T. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4652-4660PubMed Google Scholar), by overexpressing a hyperactive STAT3 form (STAT3C) (24Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H.

Naive CD4+ T cells isolated from Ifng knock-out mice were activated as above and infected with STAT3C and control viruses. Under neutral conditions or in the presence of TGF-β or anti-IL-4, STAT3C increased IL-17-expressing cells when compared with those infected with a control vector. Since the activation of STAT3C still requires cytokine-mediated phosphorylation, in the presence of IL-6 and IL-23 or under THi differentiation conditions, STAT3C greatly increased the numbers of IL-17-producing cells (Fig. 2A). Similarly, when we infected wild-type CD4+ T cells, STAT3C also enhanced THi differentiation under THi but not neutral condition (Fig. 2B). THi cells were also reported to produce IL-17F (5Langrish C.L. Chen Y. Blumenschein W.M. Mattson J. Basham B. Sedgwick J.D. McClanahan T. Kastelein R.A. Cua D.J. J. Exp.

In wild-type cells transduced with STAT3C, when compared with those infected by a control virus, IL-17F expression was also greatly enhanced (Fig. 2C) when we used an antibody specific for IL-17F. 6S. H. Chang and C. Dong, unpublished data. FIGURE 2STAT3 hyperactivation promotes THi differentiation in vitro. CD4+CD62Lhi naive T cells from Ifng-deficient (A) or WT(B) mice were purified by AutoMACS and activated under indicated conditions for 2 days and infected with STAT3C or control viruses. 2 days after infection and culture under the indicated differentiation conditions, the cells expressing IL-17 were examined by intracellular staining. The analysis was gated on CD4+GFP+ cells. The experiment was repeated at least three times with consistent results. C, naive CD4 T cells were activated under THi conditions and infected with STAT3C or control viruses, and the cells expressing IL-17F were analyzed using intracellular staining on gated CD4+GFP+ cells. D, naive CD4+ T cells were activated under THi conditions and infected with STAT3C or control viruses under THi conditions. After infection, CD4+GFP+ cells were sorted by FACS, and gene expression was measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The data shown are -fold changes of STAT3C versus vector control normalized to expression of a reference gene β-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further assess the effect of STAT3C during TH cell differentiation, expression of TH lineage-specific genes was examined in wild-type TH cells that were transduced with vector or STAT3C virus and differentiated under THi conditions. Using quantitative real-time PCR, when compared with vector control, STAT3C transduction resulted in up-regulation of IL-23R and THi cytokines IL-17 and IL-17F and suppression of TH1-specific IL-12Rβ2 and IFN-γ (Fig. 2D). Remarkably, IL-22, a cytokine expressed in THi cells that may synergize with IL-17 in inflammation (8Chung Y. Yang X. Chang S.H. Ma L. Tian Q. Dong C.

Moreover, STAT3 overactivation also reduced GATA3 and T-bet expression but increased the expression of RORγt, a transcription regulator of THi differentiation (20Ivanov I.I. McKenzie B.S. Zhou L.

Thus, STAT3 promotes the THi program and inhibits TH1 and TH2 programs.THi Differentiation Is STAT3-dependent—Our data indicate a potential role of STAT3 in regulating cytokine-mediated THi development. We further examined the role of STAT3 in THi development by using Stat3-deficient CD4+ T cells. Mice with hematopoietic and endothelial-specific Stat3 deletion were generated by breeding floxed STAT3 (fl) (22Takeda K. Kaisho T. Yoshida N. Takeda J. Kishimoto T. Akira S. J.

Naive CD4+CD25-CD62LhiCD44lo T cells isolated from fl/Δ Cre+ (Stat3 KO) and Cre–(WT) mice were differentiated in vitro in the presence of TGF-β, IL-6, IL-23, anti-IFN-γ, and anti-IL-4 or TGF-β, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α as described previously (11Veldhoen M. Hocking R.J. Atkins C.J. Locksley R.M. Stockinger B. Immunity. 2006; 24: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2972) Google Scholar). Consistently in both systems, expression of IL-17 by Stat3-deficient T cells was greatly impaired, and expression of IFN-γ was moderately increased (Fig. 3A), indicating an essential role of STAT3 in THi differentiation in vitro.FIGURE 3THi differentiation is dependent on STAT3. A–C, FACS-sorted CD4+CD25-CD62LhiCD44lo T cells from Stat3 fl/Δ Tie2-Cre+ mice (STAT3 KO) or littermate Cre–mice (WT) were differentiated under THi conditions. 4 days after polarization, the differentiated cells were assessed for IL-17 or IFN-γ production (A) or FoxP3 expression (B) using intracellular staining. Some cells were restimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3, and messenger RNA expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (C). The data shown are -fold changes of STAT3 KO versus WT control normalized to expression of the β-actin reference. D, memory CD4 T cells were isolated from Stat3 KO mice or WT littermate controls were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 for 24 h, and the cells producing IL-17 or IFN-γ were assessed by intracellular staining.

https://openalex.org/W2002424665,"Autoimmune diseases are thought to result from imbalances in normal immune physiology and regulation. Here, we show that autoimmune disease susceptibility and resistance alleles on mouse chromosome 3 (Idd3) correlate with differential expression of the key immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2). In order to test directly that an approximately twofold reduction in IL-2 underpins the Idd3-linked destabilization of immune homeostasis, we show that engineered haplodeficiency of Il2 gene expression not only reduces T cell IL-2 production by twofold but also mimics the autoimmune dysregulatory effects of the naturally occurring susceptibility alleles of Il2. Reduced IL-2 production achieved by either genetic mechanism correlates with reduced function of CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells, which are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis."

To facilitate studies of cAMP regulation we developed a BRET (bioluminescence resonance energy transfer) sensor for cAMP, CAMYEL (cAMP sensor using YFP-Epac-RLuc), which can quantitatively and rapidly monitor intracellular concentrations of cAMP in vivo. This sensor was used to characterize three distinct pathways for modulation of cAMP synthesis stimulated by presumed Gs-dependent receptors for isoproterenol and prostaglandin E2. Whereas two ligands, uridine 5 ′-diphosphate and complement C5a, appear to use known mechanisms for augmentation of cAMP via Gq/calcium and Gi, the action of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is novel. In these cells, S1P, a biologically active lysophospholipid, greatly enhances increases in intracellular cAMP triggered by the ligands for Gs-coupled receptors while having only a minimal effect by itself. The enhancement of cAMP by S1P is resistant to pertussis toxin and independent of intracellular calcium. Studies with RNAi and chemical perturbations demonstrate that the effect of S1P is mediated by the S1P2 receptor and the heterotrimeric G13 protein.

ACs are primarily activated by Gαs but their activities can also be differentially regulated by Gαi, Gβγ, or Ca2+ (10Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

The activities of various phosphodiesterases can be regulated by protein kinase A (PKA), extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and the concentration of cAMP itself (12Hoffmann R.

Thus integration of signaling by stimuli that can regulate the intracellular concentration of cAMP will depend strongly on the various pathways and the subtypes of ACs and phosphodiesterases expressed in individual cells at any given time.Assessment of the regulation of intracellular cAMP in vivo has only become possible recently. Zaccolo et al. (17Zaccolo M. De Giorgi F. Cho C.Y. Feng L. Knapp T. Negulescu P.A. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) first described a FRET sensor for cAMP based on the cAMP binding domain of PKA. Subsequently, several reports have described FRET sensors for cAMP based on binding of the nucleotide to the Epac proteins (18Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 19DiPilato L.M. Cheng X. Zhang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

While these FRET sensors have been effective for measuring changes and localization of cAMP in single cells, measurements are tedious. Furthermore, the requirement for excitation of donor molecules produces a range of problems including cell damage, photobleaching, and low signal-to-noise ratios due to intrinsic cellular autofluorescence. This precludes use of the FRET sensors in high throughput population assays. In contrast, BRET (bioluminescence resonance energy transfer) sensors use an enzymatic reaction to produce energy emission in the donor, usually produce better signal-to-noise ratios, and are better suited for high throughput population assays (22Boute N. Jockers R. Issad T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 351-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We report here the development and characterization of an Epac-based BRET sensor for cAMP (CAMYEL) with improved dynamic range and a method to quantify intracellular cAMP changes.This sensor was further used to characterize a novel phenomenon identified in RAW 264.7 cells. The Alliance for Cellular Signaling (AfCS) has conducted a comprehensive double ligand screen using the mouse macrophage-like cell line, RAW 264.7, to examine the extent of ligand interactions on a variety of downstream outputs, including cAMP (23Natarajan M. Lin K-M. Hsueh R.C. Sternweis P.C. Ranganathan R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). One of the striking results is the interaction between the lysophospholipid, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), and ligands for receptors that stimulate cAMP. S1P alone does not significantly elevate either cAMP or Ca2+ in RAW 264.7 cells. However, S1P greatly increases the amount of intracellular cAMP stimulated by isoproterenol (ISO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE). Other ligands that stimulate mobilization of Ca2+ in RAW 264.7 cells, such as complement C5a and uridine 5′-diphosphate (UDP), also enhance stimulation of cAMP by ISO and PGE, but are less efficacious than S1P.Receptors for S1P, formerly known as endothelial differentiation genes (Edg), are heptahelical transmembrane receptors that can variously interact with at least three G protein subfamilies, Gαi, Gαq, and Gα12/13 (25Pyne S.

S1P has also been shown to regulate inhibition of intracellular cAMP by a receptor-dependent Gαi-mediated mechanism (29Ancellin N. Hla T. J. Biol.

Although S1P has been shown to stimulate intracellular cAMP in cells overexpressing S1P receptors, there is no evidence that the S1P receptors couple directly to Gαs and the mechanism remains unclear (30Gonda K. Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Yatomi Y. Okazaki H. Sakurai T. Kimura S. Sillard R. Harii K. Takuwa Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).Using the CAMYEL sensor, we identified roles for S1P2 receptors and G13 proteins in mediating the synergistic effect of S1P on cAMP responses. This is the first evidence that a G13 pathway is involved in the regulation of cAMP. Kinetic experiments indicate that the effect of S1P has rapid onset and works through increasing the rate of synthesis of the cyclic nucleotide.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Isoproterenol, prostaglandin E2, complement C5a, uridine 5′-diphosphate, 8-bromo cAMP, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Sigma), sphingosine 1-phosphate (Avanti Polar Lipids), terbutaline (Sigma), ICI 118551 (Biomol Research), SEW2871 (Cayman Chemical), and JTE 013 (Tocris bioscience) were purchased from the sources indicated.DNA Constructs—Epac1 (amino acids 148-881) was generated by RT-PCR with human brain RNA as template using the primer pair 5′-CTC CGC GGA CCC GAG CCC GTG GGA ACT C-3′ and 5′-GTG AAT TCT GGC TCC AGC TCT CGG GAG AG-3′. Two point mutations, T781A and F782A, which eliminate the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Epac (21Ponsioen B. Zhao J. Riedl J. Zwartkruis F. van der Krogt G. Zaccolo M. Moolenaar W.H.

Citrine with the monomeric mutation A206K and Renilla luciferase (RL) were amplified by PCR using primer pairs: 5′-ATG GAT CCA TGG TGA GCA AGG GCG AG-3′ and 5′-CCG CGG AGC TTG TAC AGC TCG TCC ATG-3′;5′-GAA TTC ATG GCT TCC AAG GTG TAC G-3′ and 5′-GCG GCC GCT TAC TGC TCG TTC TTC AGC-3′. Fragments were then fused to the N and C termini of Epac1 as shown in Fig. 1. Circularly permuted citrine was generated by sewing PCR; constructs were equivalent to those described for the improved YFP, Venus (34Nagai T. Yamada S. Tominaga T. Ichikawa M. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The pFB-neo vector from Stratagene was used to deliver the cAMP sensor into RAW 264.7 cells via retroviral infection.Cell Culture and Transfection—Protocols for culturing RAW 264.7 cells and for transfection of DNA and siRNA or retroviral infection can be found at the AfCS website. Briefly, RAW 264.7 cells (obtained from ATCC) and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4. Transfection with DNA was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Retrovirus was made with the Phoenix Amphotropic packaging cell line (Orbigen). Infection of RAW cells was initiated by applying virus-containing supernatant harvested from the packaging cell line with 6 μg/ml polybrene on top of the cells and spinning at 1,200 × g at 32 °C for 2 h. Cells were then cultured with the viral supernatant for 1 day at 32 °C followed by removal of the viral medium and further culturing with fresh medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 at 37 °C.Gene Knockdown by RNAi—siRNA pools of oligomers targeting S1P1, S1P2, and Gα13 were SMARTPool products purchased from Dharmacon. The sequence for the S1P2-B oligomer (5′-GCA TGT CAC TCT GTC CTT A-3′) is unique from those in the SMARTPool. RAW cells were transfected with 400 nm siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were plated into 96-well tissue culture plates at 24 h post-transfection and assayed at 48-h post-transfection. Samples were taken for Western blot or qRT-PCR to assess the knockdown level of protein or mRNA, respectively. Cells were lysed and blotted with antiserum B-860 to detect Gα13 as described (35Singer W. Miller R. Sternweis P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19796-19802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Respective primers for qRT-PCR of the S1P1 and S1P2 receptors are: (F) 5′-CGG TGT AGA CCC AGA GTC CTG-3′ and (R) 5′-TTC TTT TAT GGA GCT TTT CCT TGG-3′; (F) 5′-AGC CAA CAG TCT CCA AAA CCA-3′ and (R) 5′-GGG CTG AGC ACT GGC TAG G-3′. The qRT-PCR reactions were done with an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR system from Applied Biosystems.EIA Assay for cAMP—Cells were plated on 96-well tissue culture plates 1 day prior to the treatment with ligands. Prior to treatments, cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 1 h. Ligands were then added to stimulate the cells. After the addition of ligands, reactions were stopped at the indicated times by removal of medium and cell lysis with 65% ethanol. Cell lysates were then dried and assayed using the cAMP Biotrak EIA kit (Amersham Biosciences).Measurement of Fluorescence in Vitro—Cells that express the CAMYEL sensor were lysed with buffer containing 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Bacterial expressed protein with an N-terminal His6 tag was purified with Ni-NTA resin. Coelenterazine-h (2 μm final concentration) was added to the cell lysates or purified proteins immediately prior to measurements of fluorescence emission spectra using a Spectrofluorometer MD-5020 (Photon Technology International).Assay of BRET in Live Cells—Cells were plated in 96-well solid white tissue culture plates (Greiner) at a density of 60,000 cells per well the day before assays. Cells were serum-starved in Hank's balanced salt solution, pH 7.4, for 1 h before treatments. The BRET assay was carried out with a POLARstar Optima plate reader from BMG LabTech. Emission signals from RL and YFP were measured simultaneously using a BRET1 filter set (475-30/535-30). Cells in each well were assayed in 80 μl of Hank's balanced salt solution with 2 μm coelenterazine-h, and stimulations were initiated by injection of 20 μl of 5× ligand.Calculation of cAMP Concentration—Ratiometric data were converted to cAMP concentration using Equation 1.[cAMP]=Kd×{(R-Rmin)(Rmax-R)}Eq. 1 The Kd and Hill coefficient for association of cAMP with the sensor were determined to be 8.8 μm and 1, respectively. R is the intensity ratio of RL to YFP. Rmax is obtained by adding 2 mm 8-bromo cAMP to the cells at the end of the assay. Rmin is arbitrarily set to be the average ratio of measurements with unstimulated cells minus 4 S.D.

Because the sensor containing an inactive cytosolic mutant form of human Epac-1 appeared to have the best signal-to-noise ratio (21Ponsioen B. Zhao J. Riedl J. Zwartkruis F. van der Krogt G. Zaccolo M. Moolenaar W.H. Bos J.L. Jalink K. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), it was used as a basis for development of a BRET sensor. The design of the sensor is shown in Fig. 1A; it utilizes the enhanced variant of YFP, citrine (36Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), and Renilla luciferase as the BRET pair with human Epac1 inserted in between. Spectra of the expressed sensor protein revealed strong resonance energy transfer that was significantly reduced in response to cAMP, as expected from the FRET sensors and known structural changes in the molecule (21Ponsioen B.

Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).We sought to further improve the signal by replacing citrine with circularly permuted versions of the protein. Such circular permutations of the fluorescent proteins have been shown to vastly improve the FRET signal in a sensor for calcium (34Nagai T. Yamada S. Tominaga T. Ichikawa M. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10554-10559Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). This improvement in FRET efficiency may be due to altered fluorophore orientation of the permuted proteins, and we reasoned that similar changes would apply to the efficiency of BRET sensors. Of the five different circular permutations screened, we found that replacement of citrine with citrine-cp229 improved the changes of BRET ratio upon binding cAMP by 2-fold (Fig. 1). The improved sensor gives an increase in BRET ratio (Rluc/YFP) of about 70% with cAMP and was named CAMYEL (cAMP sensor using YFP-Epac-RLuc).The CAMYEL protein was expressed in bacteria and purified for further characterization. A concentration response analysis with cAMP indicated a Kd and n (Hill coefficient) for binding of 8.8 μm and 1, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1); these are similar to binding properties reported for the FRET sensor (21Ponsioen B. Zhao J. Riedl J. Zwartkruis F. van der Krogt G. Zaccolo M. Moolenaar W.H. Bos J.L. Jalink K. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). While the activity of luciferase can be influenced by calcium, resonance energy transfer should be independent of these changes in absolute signals if calcium does not cause any conformational changes in the sensor protein. This appears to be the case because the BRET ratios, either in the presence or absence of cAMP, were not influenced by concentrations of calcium up to 1 mm (supplemental Fig. S2). Additional experiments indicated that the BRET signals were also independent of changes in pH within the tested range (pH 6.5-8.0, supplemental Fig. S2). The response time of the sensor was assessed by measured changes in BRET when the sensor was exposed to abrupt increases or decreases in cAMP. Such changes depend on both the association and dissociation of cAMP and the ensuing changes in conformation. In vitro, the change of BRET ratio in response to altered cAMP concentrations appears to be complete within 1 to 2 s (supplemental Fig. S3). This rate of signal change is well suited for measuring the kinetics of change in intracellular concentrations of cAMP.Regulation of Cytosolic cAMP in RAW 264.7 Cells—One of the outputs measured in a survey by the Alliance for Cellular Signaling for the complexity of interactions among signaling pathways was the regulation of the classical second messenger, cAMP. A traditional enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) for total intracellular cAMP was used to identify two ligands, isoproterenol (ISO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE), which effectively increased this second messenger in RAW cells. These two ligands were subjected to a comprehensive double ligand screen with over twenty additional ligands to look for non-additive interactions (23Natarajan M. Lin K-M. Hsueh R.C. Sternweis P.C. Ranganathan R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Ligands that elicit calcium responses in RAW cells, such as complement C5a and uridine 5′-diphosphate (UDP), enhanced cAMP responses triggered by ISO or PGE. Interestingly, S1P, which at best induced only minimal cAMP or calcium responses in RAW cells by itself, enhanced the cAMP response to the ISO or PGE by 2-3-fold (Fig. 2A). To study these synergistic interactions in detail, cell lines that stably express the sensor for cytosolic cAMP, CAMYEL, were derived from RAW 264.7 cells. The level of expression of the CAMYEL sensor in the RAW 264.7 cells was estimated to be about 100 nm based on comparative Western blots. These cells produced normal calcium and cAMP (as measured by EIA) responses to an array of ligands. In such cell lines the BRET ratio, RLuc/YFP, can then be used to continuously monitor intracellular cAMP in real time (Fig. 2B). The dynamic range of the sensor in RAW cells was measured using 2 mm 8-bromo cAMP, a cell-permeable analog of cAMP, to saturate the sensor in vivo.FIGURE 2Measurement of intracellular cAMP responses in RAW 264.7 cells. A, changes in cAMP measured by EIA. At time 0, cells were stimulated with 16 nm ISO, 16 nm ISO and 0.5 μm UDP, 16 nm ISO and 10 nm S1P, or 50 nm S1P as indicated. At the given times, reactions were stopped by removal of medium and addition of cell lysis solution, and cAMP was determined by EIA. The results shown are the average of three independent experiments done with two different preparations of cells: the variance among the experiments is about 30% of the signals. B, measurement of cAMP responses using the CAMYEL sensor. Emission ratios (RL/YFP) were measured in RAW 264.7 cells stably expressing the CAMYEL sensor. Cells were stimulated at time 0 by addition of either 16 nm ISO 16 nm ISO and 0.5 μm UDP, 16 nm ISO and 10 nm S1P, 10 nm S1P, 2.5 μm UDP, or 2 mm 8-bromo cAMP as indicated. C, ratiometric measurements of CAMYEL responses were converted to intracellular concentrations of cAMP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors with ISO led to rapid decreases of the BRET signal hence increases of the fluorescence intensity ratio, Rluc/YFP (Fig. 2B). The response peaked at ∼20-30 s after addition of ligand and declined to a sustained level. This response profile is qualitatively the same as measured by EIA. The BRET sensor also recapitulates the effect of S1P and UDP on production of cAMP. Addition of either S1P or UDP alone elicited minimal cAMP responses (Fig. 2B), although UDP stimulates robust increases in intracellular calcium in RAW cells. This confirms in vitro results that calcium does not affect the BRET ratio of the sensor. Simultaneous addition of either S1P or UDP together with ISO led to greater changes in BRET at the peak of the response and subsequent decreases over time to a sustained level that was equivalent to that obtained with the addition of ISO alone.To better assess the dynamics of changes in intracellular cAMP, we converted the ratiometric results shown in Fig. 2B to concentrations of cAMP (Fig. 2C, see “Experimental Procedures” and supplementary information). Using this method of conversion, we can then compare quantitative changes in cAMP measured with the BRET sensor to those obtained with the EIA. As shown in Fig. 2C, S1P or UDP synergistically increases the peak cAMP response induced by ISO alone by 2-4 or 1.5-2 folds, respectively. This slightly higher ratio of enhancement than that observed with EIA is likely due to two differences in the assessments. First, the peak response is usually missed by the EIA. Second, the sensor measures free intracellular cAMP, whereas the EIA also measures bound nucleotide that will be proportionally higher at lower concentrations.Enhancement of cAMP by S1P Is Caused by Increased Synthesis of cAMP—Use of the CAMYEL sensor allows us to dissect the effect of S1P on cAMP through detailed kinetic measurements. The intracellular concentration of cAMP is determined by a dynamic balance between its biosynthesis via adenylyl cyclases and its degradation by phosphodiesterases. The enhancement observed with S1P could be due to either stimulation of synthesis or inhibition of degradation. We first compared rates of cAMP increases when cells were stimulated by either ISO alone or combination of ISO and S1P. The synergistic effect of S1P is observed at the earliest times after ligand addition with a greater than 4-fold increase in rate throughout the approach to peak values (Fig. 3, filled symbols). This suggests that the enhancement by S1P is temporally well-coupled to the early processes causing activation of ACs.FIGURE 3Effect of S1P on intracellular cAMP has a fast onset and is not affected by inhibitors of phosphodiesterases. The CAMYEL sensor was used to measure the rise in cAMP when cells were treated with 16 nm ISO or 16 nm ISO and 10 nm S1P either in the absence or in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEi), 10 μm Ro20-1724 and 40 μm isobutylmethylxanthine. Ligands were added at time 0, PDEi were added 2 min prior to ligand addition, which was sufficient to cause maximum impact of the inhibitors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res i"

Several reports have shown that EGFR is translocated into the nucleus during liver regeneration and in several types of cells and tissues such as placenta and thyroid. Nuclear EGFR is associated with transcription, DNA synthesis, and DNA repair activity and serves as a prognostic marker in breast carcinoma and oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer. However, the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of EGFR has not been extensively examined. In this study, we have shown that the juxtamembrane region of EGFR harbors a putative NLS with three clusters of basic amino acids (RRRHIVRKRTLRR (amino acids 645–657)) that mediates the nuclear localization of EGFR. We found that this newly characterized tripartite NLS is conserved among the EGFR family members (EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4) and is able to move each to the nucleus. Further, this tripartite NLS could also mediate the nuclear localization of other known cytoplasmic proteins such as pyruvate kinase. We have demonstrated that mutating one of the three basic amino acid clusters (R or K → A) leads to significant impairment of the nuclear localization of EGFR and that of a green fluorescent protein-pyruvate kinase-NLS reporter protein. Our results show that this tripartite NLS is distinct from the traditional mono- and bipartite NLS and reveal a mechanism that could account for the nuclear localization of membrane receptors.

Classic RTKs contain an extracellular domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. Binding between RTK and their ligands is thought to initiate homodimerization or heterodimerization of the receptor (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2002; 110: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar); subsequently, dimerized RTKs are activated through their intrinsic tyrosine kinase activities by tyrosine phosphorylation (2Wells A.

Putative nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) of EGFR family members are thought to be required for the nuclear function of EGFR as a transcriptional co-activator (9Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W.

A classical monopartite NLS, RRRRHSP, resembling the NLS for the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T (LT) antigen has been identified in the C terminus of ErbB3 (11Offterdinger M. Schofer C. Weipoltshammer K. Grunt T.W. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Putative NLSs for ErbB2 and ErbB4 that mediate the nuclear localization of either full-length ErbB2 or truncated ErbB4 have also been identified in the juxtamembrane (JM) region (14Giri D.K. Ali-Seyed M. Li L.Y. Lee D.F. Ling P. Bartholomeusz G. Wang S.C. Hung M-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 11005-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 21Williams C.C. Allison J.G. Vidal G.A. Burow M.E. Beckman B.S. Marrero L. Jones F.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, whether these putative NLSs within the JM region of EGFR family members could transport cytoplasmic proteins to the nucleus has not been addressed. Molecules are shuttled between the nucleus and cytoplasm via several well studied pathways. Small molecules can diffuse freely through the nuclear pores, but nuclear localization of large molecules is generally mediated by NLSs, which are rich in basic amino acids (22Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar, 23Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M.

Two types of NLS have been identified thus far, one consisting of a monopartite sequence of basic amino acid residues (e.g. 126PKKKRKV132 in the SV40 LT antigen (25Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar)) and the other a bipartite sequence of two clusters of basic amino acids (e.g. 305KRALPNNTSSSPQPKKK321 in p53 protein (26Shaulsky G.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). NLS-bearing molecules are thought to be transported into the nucleus through their forming of a complex with importin α/β (28Efthymiadis A. Shao H. Hubner S. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22134-22139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 29Hu W. Jans D.A. J. Biol.

Importin α is an armadillo repeat-containing protein that has an arginine-rich N-terminal domain. The armadillo repeats form a grooved structure to which the basic NLS could bind (32Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Importin β is responsible for docking to the nuclear pore complex and for translocating the NLS-bearing molecules through the pore (33Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1769-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 34Gorlich D. Kostka S. Kraft R. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Curr.

Several proteins can be transported into the nucleus by directly binding to importin β, including ribosomal proteins (37Jakel S. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and the viral proteins HIV-1, Tat, and Rev (30Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have characterized a novel tripartite NLS, an NLS containing three clusters of basic amino acids that is conserved within the JM region of all EGFR family members, is capable of targeting cytoplasmic proteins into the nucleus, and is responsible for the nuclear localization of EGFR family members. Cell Culture and Transfection Conditions—All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. The cells were serum-starved for 20–24 h and then stimulated with EGF in various concentrations for different times. Transfection was done with the cationic liposome SN as previously described (13Lo H.W. Hsu S.C. Ali-Seyed M. Gunduz M. Xia W. Wei Y. Bartholomeusz G. Shih J.Y. Hung M-C. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 575-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 38Yan D.H. Spohn B. Hung M-C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 245: 125-136PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on Petri dishes or slides overnight and incubated with plasmid-liposome complex in serum-free medium for 4 h, after which the medium was replaced by complete medium and the cells incubated at 37°C for 24–48 h. Plasmid Constructs—All of the EGFR expression plasmids were amplified by PCR from pcDNA3.1-EGFR, a kind gift from Dr. David James (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). The pcDNA6A-EGFR plasmid, expressing full-length human EGFR with a C-terminal Myc-His6 tag, was constructed by PCR with the forward primer 1F-H (5′-ATTAAGCTTCGGGGAGCAGCGATG-3′) and the reverse primer 3630R-X (5′-CCTTCTAGATGCTCCAATAAATTCACTG-3′). The DNA fragments were digested with HindIII and XbaI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pcDNA6A vector (Invitrogen). A Myc-tagged, EGFR intracellular domain (ICD)-expressing plasmid was constructed with DNA fragments corresponding to amino acids 644–1186 of EGFR. The PCR products were digested with KpnI and XbaI and subsequently cloned into the corresponding sites of the pcDNA6A vector. To generate NLS mutants of EGFR, specific alanine mutations were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using either the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions or a two-round PCR method (39Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR products were cloned into the pcDNA6A vector. The NLSm1 mutant (645AAA647) has a mutation in the first basic amino acids cluster, the NLSm12 mutant (645AAAHIVAAA653) has a mutation in the first two basic amino acid clusters, and the NLSm3 mutant (RRRHIVRKRTLAA) has the first two basic clusters intact and a mutation in the third. We also created a dNLS mutant, in which all three basic amino acid clusters of the EGFR NLS (645RRRHIVRKRTLRR657) are deleted and the two amino acids (LE) inserted at the deletion junction. The dNLS mutant of EGFR was constructed by inverting PCR with the two primers 2004R-X (5′-GATCTCGAGCATGAAGAGGCCGATCCC-3′) and 2044F-X (5′-GATCTCGAGCTGCTGCAGGAGAGGG-3′). The PCR product was then digested with XhoI and ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The plasmid GFP-ICD, expressing human EGFR amino acids 640–1186 with an N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag, was constructed by using the forward primer 1990F-B with a BspEI site, (5′-AGGTCCGGAATCGGCCTCTTCATG-3′) and the reverse primer 3633R-H harboring a HindIII site (5′-CCCAAGCTTCATGCTCCAATAAATTC-3′). The amplified DNA fragments were digested with BspEI and HindIII and cloned into the corresponding sites of a pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). The GFP-ICD NLS mutants were PCR-amplified with the same primers and cloned. The plasmid GFP-JM, expressing the human EGFR JM region, was constructed by using PCR with the forward primer 1990F-B and the reverse primer 2136R-X (5′-TATTCTAGAATTCAGTTTCCTTCAAG-3). The DNA fragments were digested with BspEI and XbaI and cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector. GFP-tagged chicken muscle pyruvate kinase (GFP-PK) was kindly provided by Dr. Warner C. Greene (University of California at San Francisco) (40Sherman M.P. de Noronha C.M. Heusch M.I. Greene S. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1522-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To construct the wild-type and alanine-substituted mutants of GFP-NLS and GFP-PK NLS, oligonucleotides were synthesized, annealed, and then ligated to pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech) or to GFP-PK that had been digested with KpnI and XbaI. The insertion sequences were as follows: EGFR NLS (RRRHIVRKRTLRR), ErbB2 NLS (KRRQQKIRKYTMRR), ErbB3 NLS (RGRRIQNKRAMRR), ErbB4 NLS (RRKSIKKKRALRR), EGFR NLSm1 (AAAHIVRKRTLRR), EGFR NLSm2 (RRRHIVAAATLRR), EGFR NLSm3 (RRRHIVRKRTLAA), EGFR NLSm12 (AAAHIVAAATLRR), EGFR NLSd3 (RRRHIVRKR), and SV40 LT NLS (PKKKRKV). All of the insertion sequences yielded C-terminal fusion proteins. The authenticity of all constructs was confirmed via nucleotide sequencing by the DNA Core Facility at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, Texas). Cellular Fractionation and Western Blotting Analyses—Cellular fractionation was performed as described previously (9Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M-C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman, and lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). After incubation on ice for 10 min, the cells were homogenized by 20 strokes in a tightly fitting Dounce homogenizer. An aliquot of cells was checked for cell lysis by light microscopy to confirm that >98% of cells had been lysed. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min to sediment the nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at a maximum speed of 16,100 × g for 20 min, and the resulting supernatant formed the non-nuclear fraction. The nuclear pellet was washed three times with lysis buffer to remove any contamination from cytoplasmic membranes, and the purity of the nuclei was confirmed by light microscopy. To extract nuclear proteins, the isolated nuclei were resuspended in NETN buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin), and the mixture was sonicated briefly to aid nuclear lysis. Nuclear lysates were collected after centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. To obtain whole-cell lysates, cells were lysed in NETN buffer with sonication; lysates were then centrifuged at 16,100 × g for 20 min. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and then the samples were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8 or 10% polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Prestained molecular mass standards for electrophoresis were obtained from Bio-Rad. Membranes were probed with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies that were followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive protein bands were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce or Amersham Biosciences). When required, the intensity of the expression proteins was quantified with a computer-assisted scanning densitometer equipped with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti-EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-lamin B (Calbiochem), anti-α-tubulin (Sigma), anti-actin (Sigma), anti-c-Myc (Roche Applied Science), and anti-GFP (Clontech). All secondary antibodies were obtained from Vector Laboratories and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Confocal Analyses—Cultured cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and incubated with 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, washed and further incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody, and tagged with either fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red. Nuclei were stained with Topro 3 before mounting. Cells expressing GFP fusion proteins were subjected to nuclear staining after blocking with bovine serum albumin. Confocal fluorescence images were captured with a Zeiss CLM510 laser microscope. The images were captured in the middle sections of the nuclei. EGF Stimulation Induces Accumulation of EGFR in the Nucleus—The detection of EGFR in cell nuclei was first reported in regenerating liver and adrenocortical carcinoma (41Kamio T. Shigematsu K. Sou H.

To establish a reliable system for the functional analysis of nuclear localization of EGFR, we analyzed the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear distribution of EGFR in a breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-468) after stimulation with 10, 25, 50, or 100 ng/ml EGF for 30 min (Fig. 1A). Nuclei were then isolated by cellular fractionation and analyzed for EGFR level. The nuclear EGFR levels of the EGF-stimulated cells were about three times higher than those of unstimulated cells. To assess EGFR redistribution at different time points, we treated cells with 100 ng/ml EGF and measured nuclear EGFR levels at 0, 30, 60, and 240 min later. Nuclear EGFR levels were found to be elevated at 30 min, reached a plateau at 60 min, and declined toward the base line at 240 min after EGF treatment (Fig. 1B). Because physiological EGF levels typically range from 10 to 100 ng/ml (50Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), we reexamined the nuclear localization of EGFR at different times after stimulation with EGF at 25 ng/ml, a physiological concentration. A similar expression profile was observed, except that the 25 ng/ml EGF treatment led to EGFR being retained in the nucleus longer than did the 100 ng/ml EGF treatment (Fig. 1C). We also used confocal microscopy to confirm the nuclear localization of EGFR in response to EGF. In the absence of EGF stimulation, the EGFR protein remained mostly at the cell membranes. As early as 10 min after treatment with 10 ng/ml EGF, yellow signals were detected, indicating co-localization of EGFR and DNA, in the nucleus and in the perinuclear membranes (data not shown; see Refs. 13Lo H.W.

Identification of a Nuclear Localization Sequence within EGFR—Nuclear localization signaling is usually mediated by specific, short sequences of basic amino acids within nuclear proteins. Computer analysis of the EGFR sequence with the POSRTII program revealed the sequence RRRH (amino acids 645–648) to be a putative NLS. We also noted a poly-basic sequence in the intracellular JM region of EGFR (RRRHIVRKRTLRR, amino acids 645–657) (Fig. 2A) that was conserved in the EGFR family of proteins, and we thus proposed it as a putative NLS (9Lin S.Y.

Med. 1998; 218: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To test whether the EGFR protein contains such an NLS, we labeled cDNA fragments of EGFR ICD, JM, or the putative tripartite NLS with an enhanced GFP tag and then transiently transfected the constructs into HeLa cells. The GFP-ICD localized mostly in the nucleus with only weak cytoplasmic expression (Fig. 2B). Both the GFP-JM and GFP-NLS exhibited distinct nuclear accumulation, but the GFP control vector displayed diffuse cytoplasmic localization accompanied by a basal level of nuclear accumulation. To better quantify the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear distribution of GFP fusion proteins, cells expressing the different GFP fusion proteins were subjected to biochemical fractionation. The results revealed that most of the GFP-JM and GFP-NLS proteins were in the nuclear fractions (Fig. 2C), consistent with our findings from confocal microscopy. To see whether the tripartite NLS could direct cytoplasmic proteins into the nucleus without the influence of endogenous EGFR, we tested Chinese hamster ovary cells, which do not express EGFR, and obtained similar results (data not shown). These results suggest that the nuclear localization patterns observed were not caused by endogenous EGFR. They further indicate that this tripartite 13-amino-acid sequence, containing three clusters of two or three continuous basic amino acid residues, functions as an NLS to drive GFP-tagged protein trafficking to the nucleus, similar to the classical monopartite or bipartite NLS. All Three Clusters of Basic Amino Acids of the Tripartite NLS Are Required for Efficient Nuclear Translocation—The nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of large molecules is normally mediated by classical NLSs (22Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). To determine whether the tripartite NLS for EGFR functions as a bona fide NLS for transferring large cytoplasmic proteins into the nucleus, we fused this 13-amino-acid sequence to the C terminus of a known cytoplasmic protein, chicken PK, which had been tagged with GFP (40Sherman M.P. de Noronha C.M. Heusch M.I. Greene S. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1522-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As expected, we found that the control GFP-PK was predominantly found in the cytoplasm, whereas the GFP-PK-NLS protein was clearly visible in the nucleus (Fig. 3A, a versus b). A positive control, GFP-PK-LTNLS (which expressed a fusion protein containing the monopartite NLS of SV40 LT (PKKKRKV)), was also expressed in the nucleus (data not shown). These results indicated that the EGFR NLS is a functional NLS that can lead a large cytoplasmic protein into the nucleus. To determine whether all three of the basic amino acid clusters within the tripartite NLS are required for nuclear localization, we generated three mutants in which one of the three clusters had been mutated to alanines (Fig. 3C, NLSm1, NLSm2, and NLSm3). This substitution reduced but did not completely abolish nuclear localization; all of the mutants displayed significant cytoplasmic expression but had detectable nuclear signals of GFP-PK (Fig. 3A, c–e). Similar results were obtained with the GFP-NLS protein; mutations in any one of the three clusters of the tripartite NLS affected its nuclear translocation activity (data not shown). The biochemical fractionation experiments revealed decreases in the nuclear expression of the EGFR tripartite NLS mutants in comparison with wild-type tripartite NLS (Fig. 3B). An EGFR tripartite NLS mutant containing the first two clusters of basic amino acids but lacking the third cluster (GFP-PK NLSd3) also showed strong cytoplasmic expression but weaker nuclear expression than GFP-PK-NLS (Fig. 3A, b versus f and Fig. 3B). Collectively, these results demonstrate that t"

The role of PA in membrane dynamics and signaling is most likely 2-fold, either via an effect on the packing properties of the membrane lipids or via the specific binding of effector proteins (4Kooijman E.E.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2097-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The origin of the specific binding of effector proteins to PA is not known. The PA binding domains thus far identified (for review, see Ref. 10Andresen B.T. Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Romero G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and more recently (7Testerink C. Munnik T. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar)) are diverse and share no apparent sequence homology, in contrast to other lipid binding domains, such as e.g. the PH, PX, FYVE, and C2 domains (11Rizo J.

One general feature that the PA binding domains do have in common is the presence of basic amino acids (7Testerink C. Munnik T. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Where examined in detail, these basic amino acids were shown to be essential for the interaction with PA, which underscores the importance of electrostatic interactions. Indeed, the negatively charged phosphomonoester head group of PA would be expected to interact electrostatically with basic amino acids in a lipid binding domain. However, such a simple electrostatic interaction cannot explain the strong preference of PA-binding proteins for PA over other, often more abundant, negatively charged phospholipids. In a recent study we showed that the phosphomonoester head group of PA has remarkable properties (8Kooijman E.E. Carter K.M. van Laar E.G. Chupin V. Burger K.N. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 17007-17015Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The phosphomonoester head group is able to form an intramolecular hydrogen bond upon initial deprotonation (when its charge is -1), which stabilizes the second proton against dissociation. We provided evidence that competing hydrogen bonds, e.g. from the primary amine of the head group of phosphati-dylethanolamine (PE), can destabilize this intramolecular hydrogen bond and, thus, favor the further deprotonation, i.e. increase the negative charge, of PA (8Kooijman E.E. Carter K.M. van Laar E.G. Chupin V. Burger K.N. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 17007-17015Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These data raised the intriguing hypothesis that a combination of electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions and not just electrostatic interactions of PA with basic amino acids, i.e. lysine and arginine, forms the basis of the (specific) binding of PA to PA-binding proteins. We set out to test this hypothesis by determining the ability of lysine and arginine residues in various membrane-interacting polypeptides to form a hydrogen bond with the phosphomonoester head group of PA in a lipid bilayer. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find using magic angle spinning 31P NMR that the positively charged amino acids lysine and arginine in these peptides are able to increase the charge of PA. We conclude that this increase in charge is due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between PA and the basic amino acids. MD simulations provided a dynamic view on the specific docking of these side chains on the di-anionic form of PA. We conclude that the phosphate of PA is an effective and preferred docking site for lysine and arginine residues in membrane-interacting peptides. In combination with its special packing properties, this turns PA into nature's preferred membrane lipid to mediate interfacial insertion of positively charged membrane protein domains. This preference for PA and the role of interfacial insertion was confirmed in binding experiments with the PA binding domain of the protein kinase Raf-1, which is one of the best-characterized PA target proteins (16Ghosh S.

To conclude, we propose that the electrostatic/hydrogen bond switch provided by the phosphomonoester is a universal mechanism in stabilizing the binding of phosphomonoesters to proteins. Sample Preparation—1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (monosodium salt; DOPA), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), and 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propanediol (chloride salt) were purchased from Avanti Polar lipids (Birmingham, AL). Dimethyldioctadecylammonium (chloride salt) was a kind gift from Dr. M. Scarzello, University of Groningen, The Netherlands. The detergents, dodecylamine and dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride, were purchased from Sigma. Lipid purity was checked by thin layer chromatography and judged to be more than 99% pure. Polyleucine-alanine-based peptides (ALP) (lysine-flanked, KALP; arginine-flanked, RALP; tryptophan-flanked, WALP) were synthesized as described previously and were more than 98% pure as determined by quantitative high performance liquid chromatography (20de Planque M.R.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8396-8404Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); poly-l-lysines (hydrobromide) with polymerization degree n of 20 and 100 were purchased from Sigma and used without further purification. Dry lipid films and lipid suspensions were prepared as described previously (8Kooijman E.E. Carter K.M. van Laar E.G. Chupin V. Burger K.N. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 17007-17015Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Lipid/poly-l-lysine samples were prepared by hydrating the lipid film with Hepes buffer (100 mm Hepes, 5 mm acetic acid-NaOH, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.20) containing poly-l-lysine. The resulting lipid/poly-l-lysine dispersions were freeze-thawed at least once, after which the pH of the dispersions was generally found to be within 0.05 pH units of pH 7.20 (if not, the pH was adjusted to fall within this range). The dispersions were centrifuged at 70,000 rpm for 30 min at room temperature in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge, and the pellet was transferred to 4 mm TiO2 MAS-NMR sample tubes for 31P NMR measurement. Lipid/polyleucine-alanine peptide films were prepared as described previously (20de Planque M.R. Boots J.W. Rijkers D.T. Liskamp R.M. Greathouse D.V. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8396-8404Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These films were hydrated with Hepes buffer, and the dispersions were centrifuged as described above. The clear supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in Hepes buffer and centrifuged again. This procedure was repeated until the pH of the supernatant was within 0.05 pH units of pH 7.20, after which the samples were freeze-thawed at least once. When the pH of this dispersion was still within 0.05 pH units of pH 7.20, it was centrifuged, and the pellet was transferred toa4mmTiO2 MAS-NMR sample tube; otherwise, the above procedure was repeated until the pH was in the desired range (pH 7.20 ± 0.05). NMR Spectroscopy—31P NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 500 wide-bore spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany) at 202.48 MHz using a 4-mm cross-polarization MAS-NMR probe. Samples were spun at the magic angle (54.7°) at 5 kHz to average the chemical shift anisotropy, and the chemical shift position of PA was recorded relative to 85% H3PO4. Under stable spinning conditions typically 500-3000 scans were recorded. Experiments were carried out at a temperature of 20.0 ± 0.5 °C. Hydrogen Bond Length Determination—In the Cambridge Structural Data base (version November 2004, with updates of February and May 2005; total number of entries 347767) 395 crystal structure determinations were found containing 1716 fragments that fit the lysine geometry, i.e. primary amine-to-phosphate hydrogen bond length (see supplemental Fig. 3A). For the arginine geometry, i.e. guanidinium-to-phosphate hydrogen bond length (see supplemental Fig. 3B), 30 crystal structure determinations were found containing 158 fragments. Searches were performed with the program ConQuest (21Bruno I.J. Cole J.C. Edgington P.R. Kessler M. Macrae C.F. Mc-Cabe P. Pearson J. Taylor R. Acta Crystallogr. B. 2002; 58: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (3126) Google Scholar); for data analysis the program Vista (22CCDC Vista: A Program for the Analysis and Display of Data Retrieved from the CSD. Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, Cambridge, England1994Google Scholar) was used. MD Simulations—Starting structures for molecular dynamics simulations were based on previous simulations of DOPC-peptide interactions and used the exact same protocols (23Aliste M.P. MacCallum J.L. Tieleman D.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8976-8987Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The original DOPC bilayer consists of 64 lipids, 32 in each membrane leaflet. In each leaflet 3 randomly chosen DOPC molecules were changed into DOPA (-1) or DOPA (-2) by removing the choline head group. Head group charges and geometries for DOPA (-1) and DOPA (-2) lipids were calculated using density functional theory calculations and chargefitting. The resulting charges were close to the phosphate group charges in DOPC. 8Z. Xu and D.P. Tieleman, manuscript in preparation. 0.2 m salt was added to match the experimental conditions. The DOPA (-1) simulation system contained 58 DOPC and 6 DOPA (-1) lipids, 2791 water molecules, 11 Na+ ions, and 5 Cl- ions. The DOPA (-2) simulation system contained 58 DOPC, 6 DOPA (-2) lipids, 2785 water molecules, 17 Na+ ions, and 5 Cl- ions. These two bilayers were simulated for 25 ns for equilibration, as determined by changes in the area per lipid and hydrogen bonding, and 25 ns for production. Lys8 and Arg8 peptides were built in an extended configuration with uncapped termini. Two peptides were added to the water phase of the pre-equilibrated DOPC/DOPA bilayers above by removing overlapping water molecules and adding additional counter ions to maintain a zero net charge in the simulations. Initially the peptides were placed such that they had no contact with lipids at all, but in all cases the peptides rapidly bound at the water/lipid interface and showed little change in depth after the first 10 ns. Equilibration was monitored by following the depth of the center of mass of the peptides in the water/lipid interface and hydrogen bonding between the peptides and lipids. Hydrogen bonding parameters were calculated as averages over the last 10 ns of the 50-ns simulations. For analyses, hydrogen bonds were defined by the geometrical criteria of a donor-acceptor distance of less than 0.35 nm and an acceptor-donor-hydrogen angle of less than 30 degrees. All simulations and analyses were done with GROMACS Version 3.2.1 (24Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar); visualization was done with VMD (25Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39890) Google Scholar). Protein Production—A GST fusion of the Raf-1 PA binding region (RPA) (amino acids 390-426) (16Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

The RPA fragment was amplified by PCR and cloned into the destination vector pDest15 using the Gateway recombination system (Invitrogen). The construct was transformed to E. coli strain BL21-AI, and expression was induced by adding arabinose according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Total soluble protein was isolated, and GST-tagged protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose. Liposome Binding Assays—Liposome assays were performed as described before (26Levine T.P. Munro S.

Per sample, in total 250 nmol of synthetic dioleoyl phospholipids (all from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) were mixed at the appropriate molar ratios in chloroform, dried, and subsequently rehydrated in extrusion buffer (250 mm raffinose, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h. Unilamellar vesicles were produced using a lipid extruder (0.2-μm filters, Avanti Polar Lipids) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Liposomes were diluted in 3 volumes of binding buffer (125 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA) and pelleted by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 15 min. Liposomes were resuspended in binding buffer, added to 300 ng of purified GST-tagged protein, and incubated for 30-45 min in a total volume of 50 μl at room temperature. Liposomes were harvested by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min, washed once in binding buffer, and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie staining (Sigma), scanned, and quantified with ImageQuant (GE Healthcare) before staining with silver. Basic Amino Acids in Membrane-interacting Peptides Increase the Charge of PA—The 31P chemical shift of PA was previously found to be very sensitive to the ionization (charge) state of the phosphate head group. A change in chemical shift to downfield values, e.g. induced by an increase in pH, corresponds to an increase in negative charge observed either via high resolution NMR in small membrane vesicles (28Koter M. de Kruijff B. van Deenen L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 514: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Hauser H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5351-5355Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or by MAS NMR in physiologically more relevant extended bilayers (8Kooijman E.E. Carter K.M. van Laar E.G. Chupin V. Burger K.N. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 17007-17015Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In an earlier study we observed that inclusion of PE in a PA-containing PC bilayer resulted in a profound downfield shift of the 31P NMR peak of PA (8Kooijman E.E. Carter K.M. van Laar E.G. Chupin V. Burger K.N. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 17007-17015Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This is exemplified in Fig. 1A (compare curves 1 and 2). Curve 1 shows the MAS 31P NMR spectrum of a PC/PA (9:1) bilayer with the minor downfield peak (to the left) corresponding to PA and the major upfield peak (to the right) to PC. Inclusion of 10 mol % PE (PC/PE/PA 8:1:1, curve 2) results in a large shift of the PA peak to downfield values due to an increase in the charge of PA. This increase in negative charge of PA induced by PE is caused by hydrogen bonding between the primary amine in the head group of PE and the phosphomonoester head group of PA (see (Ref. 8Kooijman E.E. Carter K.M. van Laar E.G. Chupin V. Burger K.N. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 17007-17015Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To determine whether the basic amino acid lysine, which contains a primary amine, is also able to form a hydrogen bond with PA, we first determined the effect of polylysine20 on the chemical shift of PA at neutral pH. Polylysine20 with a polymerization degree of 20 was chosen because it binds with high affinity to membranes containing negatively charged phospholipid (30de Kruijff B. Rietveld A. Telders N. Vaandrager B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 820: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Kim J. Mosior M. Chung L.A. Wu H. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 135-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A (curve 3) shows that an equimolar amount of lysine residues with respect to PA causes the majority of the PA peak to shift to downfield values. The minor part of the PA peak that does not shift upon polylysine addition most likely represents a small pool of PA in the multilamellar vesicles that is not reached by polylysine. In the presence of an excess of lysine residues with respect to PA (Fig. 1A, curve 4), maximizing the PA-polylysine interaction, the PA peak shifts even further (see Fig. 1B for quantitation). These results were confirmed using another, longer, polylysine (n = 100) (data not shown). Thus, at constant pH, the addition of polylysine results in an increase in the negative charge of PA. The binding of polylysine to negatively charged lipid membranes is cooperative and requires a polymerization degree of at least five lysine residues (30de Kruijff B. Rietveld A. Telders N. Vaandrager B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 820: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, the PA binding domains that have been identified to date contain a smaller cluster of only 2-4 basic amino acids in their PA binding site (7Testerink C. Munnik T. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 10Andresen B.T. Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Romero G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To more closely mimic the natural situation, we chose a well characterized experimental system of synthetic polyleucine-alanine α-helical transmembrane peptides flanked on either side by two basic amino acids to study the interaction of small clusters of the basic amino acids, Lys and Arg, with PA (20de Planque M.R. Boots J.W. Rijkers D.T. Liskamp R.M. Greathouse D.V. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8396-8404Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 32de Planque M.R. Goormaghtigh E. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe 2nd, R.E. Kruijtzer J.A. Liskamp R.M. de Kruijff B. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5000-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that at a lipid-to-peptide ratio of 25, KALP23 causes a large downfield shift of the PA peak (quantified in Fig. 2B). This demonstrates that KALP23 is indeed able to increase the charge of PA, similar to the effects of PE and polylysine. The effect of KALP23 on the charge of PA depends on the lipid-to-peptide ratio, as is shown in Fig. 2B (black bars). Identical results were obtained with a KALP31 peptide (data not shown), which has a considerably longer transmembrane segment than the KALP23 peptide (32de Planque M.R. Goormaghtigh E. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe 2nd, R.E. Kruijtzer J.A. Liskamp R.M. de Kruijff B. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5000-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). RALP23 also causes an increase in the negative charge of PA in the PC/PA bilayer, although slightly less efficient than KALP23 (Fig. 2). As a control we investigated the effect of the tryptophan-flanked peptide WALP23. WALP23 incorporated at different concentrations did not appreciably affect the chemical shift of PA (Fig. 2, A, curve 2, and B), and the considerably longer WALP31 peptide displayed a similar behavior (data not shown). Clearly, the positively charged lysine and arginine residues in KALP and RALP, respectively, are responsible for the observed charge increase of PA and not just the presence of a transmembrane peptide. The Increase in Charge Is Largely Due to Hydrogen Bonding—Apart from the possibility of forming a hydrogen bond with the phosphomonoester head group of PA, lysine and arginine also introduce a net positive charge at the membrane surface. This will decrease the local proton concentration (due to charge repulsion) and, thus, increase the local (interfacial) pH. An increase in the interfacial pH will result in an increase in the negative charge of PA and is accompanied by a downfield shift of the PA peak. To distinguish between positive charge and hydrogen bond effects, we sought a simpler system in which to address this issue. We chose the positively charged amphiphiles dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride and dodecylamine, since these amphiphiles carry the same positive charge but differ in the ability to form hydrogen bonds because the quaternary amine cannot act as a hydrogen bond donor. Dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride and dodecylamine were included in the PC/PA bilayer at a lipid-to-amphiphile molar ratio of 12.5 and 6.25 to be able to compare the positive charge effects induced by these amphiphiles with those induced by the transmembrane peptides (each KALP and RALP peptide contains 4 positive charges); the results are shown in Fig. 3. As expected, the positively charged dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride increased the charge of PA due to the interaction of a positive charge (Fig. 3, white bars; control, cross-hatched bar). Similar results were obtained for the structurally very different, quaternary amine containing, diacylamphiphiles, 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propanediol and dimethyldioctadecylammonium, which also only caused a small increase in the chemical shift and, thus, the negative charge of PA (data not shown). However, dodecylamine, which in addition to being positively charged can also form a hydrogen bond, induced a substantially larger increase in the negative charge of PA (Fig. 3, striped bars). Quantitation of the change in charge induced by primary and quaternary amines requires full titration curves, which are shown in Supplemental Fig. 1. These data show that at pH 7.2 primary amines induce an ∼60% larger increase in the negative charge when compared with quaternary amines. These results clearly demonstrate that hydrogen bond-forming primary amines are able to further increase the negative charge of PA beyond the increase induced by quaternary amines and indicate that the extra increase in negative charge induced by the primary amine is due to the formation of a hydrogen bond with the phosphomonoester head group of PA. Importantly, the effects induced by the quaternary amines are substantially less than those induced by KALP and RALP peptides, whereas the effect of the primary amine dodecylamine is essentially identical to that of KALP (compare Figs. 2B and 3). Therefore, we conclude that the interaction of KALP and RALP peptides with PA involves the formation of hydrogen bonds between the basic amino acid residues and the phosphomonoester head group of PA. Basic Amino Acids Have a Preferential Interaction with Di-anionic PA—To get a broader insight into the interaction of lysine and arginine containing membrane active peptides with a PA-containing PC bilayer, we carried out MD simulations. These simulations were performed with PC bilayers containing 10 mol % of either a mono-anionic or di-anionic PA and contained either polylysine8 or polyarginine8 peptides, one on either side of the lipid bilayer. The length of these peptides is sufficient to assure an efficient interaction with an anionic bilayer (30de Kruijff B. Rietveld A. Telders N. Vaandrager B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 820: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The simulations were started with the peptides in solution, and we monitored the interaction between lysine or arginine side chains and phosphates in the head group of PA and PC. The peptides quickly bound to the lipid bilayer (within 10 ns) and stayed bound for the duration of the simulation (50 ns). A two-dimensional snapshot of the simulation of a PC bilayer containing di-anionic-PA in the presence of polylysine8 is shown in Fig. 4. As predicted by the MAS-NMR experiments, hydrogen bond interactions between the di-anionic PA and lysine side chains are clearly visible (shaded in yellow). However, hydrogen bonds between the phosphate of PC and lysine side chains were also present. To get an estimate of the relative preference of the lysine side chains for a specific lipid (either PA or PC), we determined the total number of hydrogen bonds formed between the peptides and phosphate of mono- and di-anionic PA and PC and compared these to the ratio of PA to PC in the bilayer. The total number of lysine side-chain hydrogen bonds to the phosphate of PA and PC in the simulations containing either mono-anionic or di-anionic PA normalized to the PC/PA ratio in the bilayer are shown in Fig. 5, A and B, respectively. These normalized histograms show that it is much more likely for a lysine side chain to form a hydrogen bond with the phosphate of di-anionic PA than with the phosphate of PC; in contrast, there is no apparent difference between mono-anionic PA and PC, i.e. the histograms overlap. These histograms al"

The expression of Sry and subsequently Sox9 (SRY box containing gene 9) in precursors of the supporting cell lineage results in the differentiation of these cells into Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells in turn orchestrate the development of all other male-specific cell types. To ensure that Sertoli cells differentiate in sufficient numbers to induce normal testis development, the early testis produces prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which recruits cells of the supporting cell lineage to a Sertoli cell fate. Here we show that the gene encoding prostaglandin D synthase (Pgds), the enzyme that produces PGD2, is expressed in Sertoli cells immediately after the onset of Sox9 expression. Promoter analysis in silico and in vitro identified a paired SOX/SRY binding site. Interestingly, only SOX9, and not SRY, was able to bind as a dimer to this site and transactivate the Pgds promoter. In line with this, a transgenic mouse model showed that Pgds expression is not affected by ectopic Sry expression. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation proved that SOX9 but not SRY binds to the Pgds promoter in vivo.

Sexual differentiation in mammals is unique in that an indifferent organ system, including gonads, genital tracts, and external genitalia, has the potential to develop in two completely different directions, either down the male pathway or down the female pathway. In mice, the decision as to which pathway to follow takes place between 10.5 and 12.5 days post coitum (dpc), 3The abbreviations used are: dpc, days post coitum; PGD2, prostaglandin D2; PGDS, prostaglandin D synthase; SRY, sex-determining region of Y chromosome; SOX, SRY box containing gene 9; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ts, tail somite; HEK, human embryonic kidney; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ISH, in situ hybridization. when the gene Sry (sex-determining gene on the Y-chromosome) is expressed in the genital ridge of an XY animal or not expressed, as in the case of an XX animal. The expression of Sry drives the differentiation of the genital ridge into a testis rather than an ovary, which in turn directs all secondary sexual differentiation via secretion of male-specific hormones (for review see Ref. 1Wilhelm D. Koopman P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 620-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). SRY belongs to the family of SOX transcription factors that are characterized by the high mobility group DNA binding domain. It is expressed specifically in the supporting cell lineage that gives rise to immature Sertoli cells in the developing testis. The expression of Sry resembles a wave, starting in the center of the genital ridge, expanding to the poles and turning off first at the anterior pole with the last SRY-positive cells being detectable at the posterior pole at around 12.5 dpc (2Hacker A.

Almost immediately after Sry, another gene of the Sox family, Sox9, is expressed in the same cells following a similar wave of up-regulation, but unlike Sry, its expression continues throughout testis development (7Schepers G.

Subsequently, SOX9-positive cells differentiate into Sertoli cells, which form the testis cords by enclosing clusters of germ cells. Sertoli cells then coordinate the differentiation of all other testis-specific cell types such as the steroidogenic Leydig cells within the interstitium and peritubular myoid cells, which surround Sertoli cells and thereby take part in testis cord formation. It has been shown that both Sry and Sox9 are necessary and sufficient for male development in mice and in humans (10Bishop C.E. Whitworth D.J. Qin Y. Agoulnik A.I. Agoulnik I.U. Harrison W.R.

Consistently, in vitro experiments have shown that both factors recognize essentially the same DNA motifs with very similar affinities and induce sharp bends at similar angles (18Ferrari S.

The best candidate so far for being an authentic SRY target is Sox9 itself. However, experimental proof has not been forthcoming. The direct or indirect up-regulation of Sox9 expression by SRY is crucial for testis development. Studies have shown that in XX ↔ XY chimeric mouse embryos, the ratio of XX to XY cells is ∼50:50 in all tissues, the only exception being Sertoli cells. These were found to be more than 90% XY, indicating that the differentiation of Sertoli cells needs the presence of the Y chromosome (23Palmer S.J. Burgoyne P.S. Development (Camb.). 1991; 112: 265-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore, SRY acts cell-autonomously. However, these experiments also imply that Sry is not essential for the differentiation of all Sertoli cells. XX cells were recruited to differentiate into Sertoli cells contributing almost one-tenth of the total number of Sertoli cells. Thus, it is not surprising that in addition to the cell-autonomous mechanism, at least one non-cell-autonomous mechanism exists to ensure the differentiation of sufficient Sertoli cells to a level above the estimated threshold of 20% (24Burgoyne P.S.

PGD2 has been shown to play a role in various physiological and pathological functions as an endogenous somnogen, anti-coagulant, vasodilator, broncho-constrictor and as an allergic and inflammatory mediator released from mast cells (for review see Ref. 28Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Here we show that Pgds is expressed in Sertoli cells shortly after the expression of Sry and Sox9 in a similar dynamic wave. Biochemical, cell culture, and genetic experiments indicate that this up-regulation is mediated by SOX9, but not SRY, via a paired SOX recognition site within the Pgds 5′-flanking region. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirm that SOX9 binds in vivo to the identified regulatory region. Animals and Cell Lines—Embryos were collected from timed matings of the Swiss Quackenbush outbred strain, with noon of the day on which the mating plug was observed designated as 0.5 dpc. For more accurate staging, the tail somite (ts) stage of the embryo was determined by counting the number of somites posterior to the hind limb (2Hacker A. Capel B. Goodfellow P. Lovell-Badge R. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using this method, 10.5 dpc corresponds to ∼8 ts, 11.5 dpc corresponds to 18 ts, and 12.5 dpc corresponds to 30 ts. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cambrex), 1× penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. In Situ Hybridization—The probes for Sox9 (29Wright E. Hargrave M.R. Christiansen J. Cooper L. Kun J. Evans T. Gangadharan U. Greenfield A. Koopman P. Nat.

Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were made as described previously. Section in situ hybridization was performed on 7-μm sections of paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded embryos. Sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and incubated in 5 μg/ml proteinase K for 20 min at room temperature. After washing in PBS, sections were refixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, acetylated, and prehybridized with hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 250 μg/ml yeast RNA, 500 μg/ml herring sperm DNA) for 2 h at room temperature. Hybridization (hybridization solution +0.5 μg/ml probe) was performed overnight at 60 °C. Slides were washed in 5× SSC for 5 min, 0.2× SSC for 1 h at 60 °C, 0.2 × SSC for 5 min at room temperature and NT buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for 5 min at room temperature before incubating for 2 h with blocking solution (10% heat-inactivated sheep serum in NT buffer) in a humidified chamber. Anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Applied Science) at 1:2000 dilution in blocking solution was added to the slides and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Unbound antibodies were removed by washing three times in NT buffer. Sections were equilibrated in NTM buffer (100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 50 mm MgCl2) and incubated in color solution (3.5 μl of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Applied Science), 3.5 μl of nitro blue tetrazolium (Roche Applied Science) per ml of NTM buffer) until purple staining was satisfactory.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1839-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) using recombinant, bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins of the full-length mouse SRY, SOX9, and SOX2. Recombinant plasmids were constructed by using the vector pGEX-KG (32Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides harboring SOX-A/-B sites had the following sequence: 5′-CCA AAT GTT CAA GGC ACA AAT GGT GCT TTG TGT TCC CTG CTG G-3′; harboring SOX-C site, 5′-GGT AGG GCT TGT GAG AAG CAG G-3′; mut-A (mutated nucleotides are underlined), 5′-CCA AAT GTT CAA GGG ACG TGT GGT GCT TTG TGT TCC CTG CTG G-3′; mut-B, 5′-CCA AAT GTT CAA GGC ACA AAT GGT GCT TCT GCA CCC CTG CTG G-3′; mut-AB, 5′-CCA AAT GTT CAA GGG ACG TGT GGT GCT TCT GCA CCC CTG CTG G-3′. Oligonucleotides were annealed and subsequently labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37 °C and purified using Nick columns (Amersham Biosciences). Binding reactions were performed by using 20 ng of purified protein and 3000 cpm of end-labeled probe. Luciferase Assays—HEK293 cells were plated at 3 × 105/well in 12-well plate 24 h before transfection. The cells were transfected in triplicates with the relevant combination of plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each well received 800 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL2-Basic without or with the wild type or mutated Pgds promoter fragment), increasing amounts (32, 80, 200 ng) of expression plasmid (pSGSox9 (9Kent J.

Genome Res. 2003; 101: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)), and 600 ng of β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCH110 as an internal control. The empty pcHA vector was added to equalize amounts of transfected plasmid DNA concentrations. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity as described previously (7Schepers G. Wilson M. Wilhelm D. Koopman P. J. Biol.

To verify expression of SOX9 and SRY, Western blot analysis with antibodies specific for SOX9 (6Wilhelm D. Martinson F. Bradford S. Wilson M.J. Combes A.N. Beverdam A. Bowles J. Mizusaki H.

Stanfield S. Dinnis D. Koopman P. genesis. 2006; 44: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Values were normalized for transfection efficiency according to β-galactosidase activity and with respect to the effects of the expression constructs on the empty pGL2-Basic reporter plasmid. Three independent experiments were performed. ChIP—Male and female genital ridges (gonad + mesonephros) were dissected from ∼500 staged mouse embryos (one genital ridge at 11.5 dpc yields ∼1 μg of protein) in cold PBS, and a single cell suspension was prepared by passaging several times through a 21-gauge needle. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and proteins and DNA were cross-linked by incubating the cells in 1% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine in a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were washed three times with PBS, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8), and sonicated to shear DNA into fragments ≤2 kb. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the extract was precleared with 30 μl of preswollen protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C to reduce nonspecific background. The precleared extract was split into two equal aliquots and incubated with either anti-mouse SRY or anti-mouse SOX9 antibodies (6Wilhelm D. Martinson F. Bradford S. Wilson M.J. Combes A.N. Beverdam A. Bowles J. Mizusaki H. Koopman P. Dev. Biol. 2005; 287: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) at 4 °C overnight. After incubation with 30 μl of preswollen protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with sonication buffer and once with TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA), and protein-DNA complexes eluted by incubation twice with 100 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS in TE) at 37 °C for 20 min with vigorous shaking. Co-immunoprecipitated DNA was purified by 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K digest (overnight at 55 °C), phenol/chloroform extraction, and washing with Microcon YM-100 filter tubes (Millipore). Identity of the amplified fragments was verified by sequencing. Primers used to investigate the enrichment of Pgds promoter fragments by PCR were as follows: PCR1.F, 5′-GTC GAC CAG AAA TAA CTT TAG AGA AGA AA-3′; PCR1.R, 5′-TTA AGC TTC CTG TGT GTG GGG TCC TGT A-3′; PCR2.F, 5′-TTG TCG ACC AGG GTA GAG TGC GTG AGC TTC TT-3′; PCR2.R, 5′-GGA AGC TTG CGC TTC CCT GCT GCT GGA AA-3′. Pgds Expression in Developing Mouse Testes—To address the question of how the expression of Pgds is regulated in the fetal gonad, we first compared Pgds and Sox9 expression in detail by whole-mount in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis of ts-staged mouse genital ridges from 13 to 21 ts. At each developmental stage, left and right genital ridges from the same embryo were assessed in parallel for Pgds and Sox9 expression. Pgds transcripts were first detected in the center of the testis at 17 ts (Fig. 1A), shortly after the onset of Sox9 expression at 15 ts. Subsequently, the expression domain of Pgds expanded to include the anterior and posterior poles. This dynamic, wave-like expression pattern closely resembles those of Sry and Sox9 in the embryonic testis (Figs. 1A, and 5, A and B) (3, 6, and 7). Pgds was not detected in the ovary at any investigated stages (data not shown).FIGURE 5Ectopic Sry is not sufficient to induce endogenous Pgds expression. A and B, whole-mount in situ hybridization of male wild type (XY) and sex-reversed Sry-transgenic (XX tg) genital ridges from 10 to 17 ts for Sry (right gonads)(A) and Pgds (left gonads)(B). Sry was expressed in XX transgenic animals already at 10 ts along the whole length of the genital ridge, in contrast to endogenous Sry in wild type XY genital ridges, whose expression started at 13 ts. In both cases, Pgds expression was induced between 15 and 17 ts, suggesting that it is not directly regulated by SRY.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the cell type that express Pgds, section ISH was carried out on whole embryos from 11.5 to 14.5 dpc using an RNA probe specific for Pgds in comparison with the germ cell-specific marker gene Oct4. At all stages, Pgds, like Sry and Sox9, was expressed by Sertoli cells but not by germ or interstitial cells (Fig. 1B, left panels, and data not shown), whereas Oct4 showed the expected expression in germ cells only (Fig. 1B, right panels). Identification of the Mouse Pgds Promoter—Our expression analysis suggested that SRY and/or SOX9 might directly regulate Pgds transcription. To test this hypothesis, we compared the genomic region of mouse Pgds with that of human and dog by means of the ECR (evolutionary conserved region) browser. Approximately 600 bp 5′ of the transcription start site was found to be highly conserved between human and mouse and ∼300 bp between human, mouse, and dog (Fig. 2A). Cloning and sequence analysis of the conserved 600-bp fragment revealed three putative SRY/SOX binding sites (Fig. 2B). Two of these binding sites (SOX-A and SOX-B) were separated by 4 bp and arranged in opposite orientation, representing a so-called paired SOX site similar to the sites identified in the Col2a1, matrilin-1, Col11a2, and Col27a1 promoters (7Schepers G.

J. 2005; 389: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The third SOX site was an isolated, single site. Characterization of the SOX Binding Sites within the Pgds Promoter—To determine whether SRY and/or SOX9 protein is able to bind to these putative binding sites, we performed EMSAs using labeled duplex oligonucleotides that encompassed the paired SOX sites and the single SOX site, respectively (Fig. 2B). After incubation of these oligonucleotides, bacterially expressed GST-SRY fusion protein was bound to the paired binding sites (SOX-A and SOX-B), forming one complex, even with increasing amounts of protein (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, incubation of the labeled oligonucleotide encompassing SOX-A and SOX-B with SOX9 revealed the formation of two complexes (Fig. 3A, lane 4), presumably corresponding to the binding of SOX9 as a monomer to one site or as a dimer to both sites. Neither GST alone nor the dissimilar SOX protein SOX2 bound to the fragment under these conditions (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 5). In contrast, the single SOX site C was not bound by any of the proteins tested (Fig. 3A, lanes 6–10). Having identified the paired SOX site within the Pgds promoter, we sought to characterize these binding sites further by mutation analysis. Introduction of four point mutations in SOX-A resulted only in a slight reduction of SRY binding when compared with the wild type sequence (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 2 and 5), whereas for SOX9, only monomeric but no longer dimeric complexes were detected (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 6). In contrast, mutation of SOX-B almost completely abolished binding of either SRY or SOX9 to the EMSA probe (Fig. 3B, lanes 8 and 9). As expected, mutation of both sites obliterated the binding entirely (Fig. 3B, lanes 11 and 12). These data suggest that SOX-B represents a high affinity binding site to which the SOX proteins predominantly bind. In contrast, SOX-A appears to be a low affinity site to which SOX9 binds only if SOX-B is intact and occupied by another SOX9 molecule. SOX9 but Not SRY Activates the Pgds Promoter—Binding of SRY and SOX9 to these sequences suggested that these transcription factors are able to transactivate the Pgds promoter. To validate this possibility, we used HEK293 cells and co-transfected either Sry or Sox9 expression plasmids together with the Pgds promoter fragment driving the luciferase gene. Expression of SOX9 and SRY was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, increasing amounts of Sry expression plasmid appeared to repress rather than activate transcription (Fig. 4B, wt/Sry). However, this repression of the wild type promoter mediated by SRY was not changed by mutation of either or both SOX binding sites (Fig. 4B, A-mut, B-mut, AB-mut/Sry), suggesting that it is a nonspecific, binding site-independent effect. In contrast, increasing amounts of Sox9 expression construct resulted in activation of luciferase activity (Fig. 4B, wt/Sox9). Introduction of mutations in any or both of the SOX binding sites led to a complete loss of promoter activation by SOX9 (Fig. 4B, A-mut, B-mut, AB-mut/Sox9), indicating that SOX9 has to bind as a dimer to an intact paired SOX site to activate the Pgds promoter. In summary, only SOX9 dimers but not SOX9 monomers or monomeric SRY binding are sufficient for transactivation of the Pgds promoter. Ectopic Sry Does Not Alter Endogenous Pgds Expression in Vivo—Our in vitro data implied that SOX9 but not SRY is able to activate Pgds transcription. To support the in vivo significance of this hypothesis, we performed two types of experiments. First, we made use of a transgenic mouse line in which Sry is expressed under the control of the Hsp70.3 promoter (39Kidokoro T. Matoba S. Hiramatsu R. Fujisawa M. Kanai-Azuma M. Taya C. Kurohmaru M. Kawakami H. Hayashi Y. Kanai Y. Yonekawa H. Dev. Biol. 2005; 278: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These mice exhibit XX sex reversal with Sry being expressed as early as 10 ts along the whole length of the gonad (Fig. 5A). This is in contrast to endogenous Sry, which is first detectable at around 13 ts in the center of XY genital ridges before extending to the poles (Fig. 5A) (3Bullejos M. Koopman P. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 221: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 6Wilhelm D. Martinson F. Bradford S. Wilson M.J. Combes A.N. Beverdam A. Bowles J. Mizusaki H. Koopman P. Dev. Biol. 2005; 287: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The onset of Sox9 expression is not altered in these transgenic mice, taking place between 13 and 15 ts (39Kidokoro T. Matoba S. Hiramatsu R. Fujisawa M. Kanai-Azuma M. Taya C. Kurohmaru M. Kawakami H. Hayashi Y. Kanai Y. Yonekawa H. Dev. Biol. 2005; 278: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, these mice provide a unique model system with a time window of at least 8–10 h in which only Sry but not Sox9 is expressed. Using this mouse model, we investigated whether endogenous Pgds expression is altered by the ectopic expression of Sry. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of genital ridges from tail somite-staged mice revealed that Pgds expression is first detectable at 15 ts both in wild type XY as well as in transgenic XX genital ridges (Fig. 5B). Therefore, ectopic expression of Sry is not sufficient to change the expression pattern of Pgds, supporting our hypothesis that Pgds is not directly regulated by SRY. SOX9 Binds in Vivo to the Pgds Promoter—In a second series of experiments, we used in vivo ChIP assay with isolated 11.5 dpc XX and XY genital ridges, respectively. Any transcription factor that functions as a direct activator of Pgds in vivo would be expected to be associated with the identified promoter fragment in Sertoli cell nuclei. To test whether SRY and/or SOX9 bind to the Pgds promoter in vivo, immunoprecipitation was carried out with antibodies specific for mouse SRY and SOX9. As a control, primers were chosen that amplify a region ∼2 kb upstream of the Pgds transcription start si"

Three of these receptors, S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3, are widely expressed on cells and tissues, whereas expression of the S1P4 and S1P5 receptors are largely confined to cells of the immune and nervous systems. The ligand S1P is produced through the phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 and can be degraded by S1P-specific enzymes that include phosphatases and a lyase (3Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Micromolar levels of the S1P ligand, bound primarily to high density lipoproteins, are found in plasma and may provide a source for tonic signaling. Acute S1P signaling may result from enhanced secretion of S1P from cells, such as platelets and mast cells, upon activation.Genetic deletion of receptors within mice has been an important means of identifying the physiologic roles of S1P receptor signaling.

Distortion product (DP)-grams comprised 2f1 - f2 DPOAE amplitudes as a function of f2. Possible vestibular function defects were evaluated by standard rotarod, balance beam walking, swimming, and contact righting reflex tests (15Khan Z. Carey J. Park H.J. Lehar M. Lasker D. Jinnah H.A. Neuroscience. 2004; 127: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Histological Analysis of Inner Ear—Mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4; PFA). The skulls were removed, immersed in 4% PFA for 4 h at room temperature, decalcified in Decalcifier II (Surgipath Medical Industries Inc., Richmond, IL) overnight at 4 °C and embedded in paraffin blocks. The 5-μm serial sections were obtained from paraffin blocks and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy—For whole-mount staining, the stria vascularis was dissected out and fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min on ice. The tissue was treated in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% Triton X-100) for 30 min at room temperature. The tissue was stained overnight at 4 °C to visualize the vasculature with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated isolectin GS-IB4 (4 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) in blocking buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 or with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin to visualize the actin cytoskeleton (1:200, Molecular Probes) and DAPI to visualize nuclei. Tissue was washed with cold PBS and mounted in Fluoromount-G. Dissected organs of Corti were fixed in 4% PFA for 1 h at room temperature and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Tissues were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (1:100, Molecular Probes), diluted in PBS for 20 min, washed in PBS, and mounted using a Prolong Antifade kit (Molecular Probes). Imaging was performed with a laser scanning confocal microscope LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.).Light Microscopy Imaging of Vestibular Epithelium and Stria Vascularis—The inner ears of wild-type and S1P2 receptor-null mice were fixed with 4% PFA for 1 h at room temperature and washed in PBS, and the stria vascularis with the spiral ligament as well as the vestibular epithelia were dissected out. The vestibular epithelia were transferred to fresh PBS and imaged using a Stemi-11 stereomicroscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) equipped with a ZVS-3C75DE digital camera and Digital Acquire application software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). The stria vascularis with the underlying spiral ligament were mounted using immu-mount solution (ThermoShandon, Pittsburgh, PA) and examined with a Nikon eclipse 80i upright microscope (Nikon Instruments, Inc.) using differential interference contrast.Real-time PCR—Tissue RNA was isolated with TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). Stria vascularis RNA was pooled from nine wild-type mice. For other tissues, RNA was prepared from separate samples from three wild-type mice. cDNA was synthesized from 100 ng of total RNA. Real-time PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Assay-on-Demand™ gene expression products for S1P1 (catalog number Mm00514644_m1), S1P2 (Mm01177794_m1), S1P3 (Mm00515669_m1), Sphk1 (Mm00448841_g1), Sphk2 (Mm00445021_m1), Sgpl1 (Mm00486079_m1), Sgpp1 (Mm00473016_m1), Gapdh (Mm99999915_g1), and Taq-Man Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) were used for real-time PCR under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. For quantitation, Gapdh was amplified simultaneously, and the gene expression of S1P1, S1P2, S1P3, Sphk1, Sphk2, Sgpl1 and Sgpp1 was normalized to the Gapdh expression.Preparation of the Spiral Modiolar Artery—The isolation of the spiral modiolar artery has been previously described in detail (16Scherer E.Q. Wonneberger K. Wangemann P. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 182: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The artery segments (∼1.5 mm in length) were canulated and pressurized hydrostatically (30 mm Hg). The functional experiments were performed at 37 °C in MOPS-buffered salt solution (3 mm MOPS, 145 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 3mm CaCl2, 1.17 mm, MgSO4·7H2O, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4·2H2O, 2 mm pyruvate, 0.02 mm EDTA, and 5.0 mm glucose). Changes in the outer diameter were detected using videomicroscopy (Crescent Electronics, Windsor, Ontario, Canada). Artery viability was confirmed by testing its vasomotor response to 0-10 mm Ca2+ under depolarizing conditions (125 mm KCl).RESULTSWe have previously reported that ∼50% of S1P2; S1P3 receptor double null mice die in utero with angiogenic defects (6Kono M.

We noted that ∼20% of the surviving S1P2; S1P3 receptor double null mice developed a pronounced head tilt as adults, suggesting a possible inner ear abnormality (Fig. 1A). Histological evaluation of the inner ears of six-month-old double null mice demonstrated a striking bilateral absence of the spiral ganglion neurons (Fig. 1B). Examination of the inner ear histology of single null S1P2 or S1P3 receptor mice revealed that only the S1P2 receptor-null animals were lacking spiral ganglion neurons (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus we focused our attention on S1P2 receptor-null mice for analysis of auditory function.To evaluate hearing ability, ABR analysis was performed using one- and three-month-old S1P2 null and S1P2 heterozygous mice from the same litters (Fig. 2, A and B). At one month of age, heterozygous mice already had normal adult-like ABR waveforms and thresholds. In contrast, age-matched S1P2 receptor-null mice showed no characteristic ABR waveforms at intensities of 100 db of sound pressure level (SPL) to all four stimuli tested (click, 8, 16, and 32 kHz). These results demonstrated that the S1P2 receptor-null mice were profoundly deaf shortly after hearing function usually becomes fully established in mice (∼3 weeks) (17Anniko M. Nordemar H. Arch. Otorhinolaryngol. 1980; 229: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18Sadanaga M. Morimitsu T. Hear. Res. 1995; 89: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We next measured distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE), an indicator of the mechanosensory function of outer hair cells within the organ of Corti. We found that S1P2 receptor-null mice at one and three months of age had no measurable DPOAE (Fig. 2C), which suggested that the function of the outer hair cells was disrupted either because of abnormalities of these and other cells of the organ of Corti or because of disturbed homeostasis of the inner ear fluids that are critical for mechanotransduction in the organ of Corti.FIGURE 2Analysis of S1P2 receptor-null mice auditory function. A, shown is a sample ABR analysis for a click stimulus of a 4-week-old S1P2 receptornull (-/-) and heterozygous (+/-) littermate. The horizontal axis is time in milliseconds; the vertical axis is sound intensity in db SPL. Observed thresholds in this sample were 40 db SPL for the S1P2+/- mouse and >100 db SPL for the S1P2-/- mouse. B, mean ABR thresholds (db SPL) of S1P2+/- and S1P2-/- mice at 1 and 3 months old. C, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in S1P2 receptor-null mice and their heterozygous littermates. Relationships between DPOAE and stimulating frequency (DP-grams) are shown for S1P2 receptor-null mice at 1 and 3 months of age. Heterozygous littermates had normal DPOAEs at both of these ages and, therefore, the data were combined. Values are presented as mean ± S.E.

Although the otoconia defect could underlie manifestations of vestibular dysfunction, such as the head tilt originally displayed by the double null mice, the S1P2 receptor-null mice exhibited balance and motor function indistinguishable from wild-type littermates when tested on a rotarod by balance beam walking or in a swimming test (data not shown).FIGURE 3Temporal analysis of inner ear pathologic changes in S1P2 receptor-null mice.

The cochlea duct histology of null and wild-type mice was similar at postnatal day 7 (data not shown). However, at postnatal day 14, the stria vascularis, which produces the endocochlear potential within the inner ear endolymphatic space, was nearly double the thickness in S1P2 receptor-null mice compared with wildtype littermates (Fig. 3, C and F). Within the stria vascularis of the S1P2 receptor-null mice, blood vessels appeared dilated. At postnatal day 31, the stria vascularis of the S1P2 receptornull mice showed abnormally increased pigmentation, an indicator of damage and altered function of intermediate cells (19Wangemann P. Itza E.M. Albrecht B. Wu T. Jabba S.V. Maganti R.J. Lee J.H. Everett L.A. Wall S.M. Royaux I.E. Green E.D. Marcus D.C. BMC Med. 2004; 2: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, A-C). The sensory hair cells in the organ of Corti in S1P2 receptor-null mice appeared relatively normal at postnatal day 14 (Fig. 3, C and F) and were only mildly affected by postnatal days 17-21 (Fig. 3, D and G). By postnatal day 31 there was base-to-apex degeneration, which was more severe in the basal turn of the organ of Corti and milder in the middle and apical turns, with the degeneration progressively increasing at later times (Fig. 3, E and H; Fig. 4, D-G). The spiral ganglion neurons of S1P2 receptor-null mice were present up to postnatal day 21 but had largely disappeared by 4 months (Fig. 3, E and H). Because the stria vascularis was severely affected at an early time in the temporal sequence of pathologic changes within S1P2 receptornull cochlea, we analyzed this structure in more detail.FIGURE 4Increased pigmentation in stria vascularis and degeneration of the organ of Corti in S1P2 receptor-null mice. A-C show light microscopy images of the whole-mount preparation of the stria vascularis and underlying spiral ligament. Intermediate cells of the stria vascularis are pigmented cells, and the pigmentation is seen as brown spots all over the stria vascularis. Note the abnormally increased pigment accumulation in the stria vascularis of one- and six-month-old S1P2 receptor-null mice. Images were obtained by using a 10× objective and differential interference contrast. Scale bar in A is 100 μm and applies to B and C.

Arrowheads point to cuticular plates of OHCs with a characteristic V-shape of stereocilia bundles. Cuticular plate of an IHC is indicated by the arrow. The stereocilia of IHCs are present but are not visible, because they are out of the focal plane of this optical section.

Double staining with phalloidin and DAPI revealed both multinuclear and anuclear marginal cells of heterogeneous sizes in S1P2 receptor-null stria vascularis (Fig. 5, A and D). The capillary network of the stria vacularis was imaged by isolectin staining and confocal microscopy. The blood vessels of the stria vascularis from S1P2 receptor-null mice, at one month of age, were remarkably dilated and tortuous compared with vessels from the controls (Fig. 5, C and F).FIGURE 5Organization of marginal and basal cell barriers and capillaries in the stria vascularis. The marginal (A and D) and basal (B and E) cell barriers were visualized by whole-mount phalloidin staining of stria vascularis (green). A and B illustrate the normal morphology of the marginal and basal cell barriers of 3-week-old wild-type mice. D and E illustrate the disorganization of the marginal and basal cell barriers in 3-week-old S1P2 receptor-null mice. The cell nuclei were visualized by DAPI (blue) in A and D. The stria vascularis capillaries of 1-month-old mice were visualized by isolectin in C (wild-type) and F (S1P2 receptor-null). Scale bars in A and C are 20 μm.

We therefore investigated whether S1Pstimulated vasoconstriction in spiral modiolar arteries isolated from the gerbil cochlea could be inhibited with an antagonist of the S1P2 receptor. Gerbil spiral modiolar arteries were used because the mouse cochlea anatomy does not permit reliable spiral modiolar artery isolation.

This striking phenotype is not shared by S1P3 receptor-null mice. A substantial incidence of head tilt in double null S1P2; S1P3 receptor mice first prompted us to examine inner ear structures. The head tilt, a possible vestibular manifestation, was observed much less frequently in the S1P2 receptor-null mice. However, the bilateral absence of normal with the presence of few enlarged utricular otoconia in all of the S1P2 receptor-null inner ears indicate the perturbed ionic composition of vestibular labyrinth fluids and suggest that more subtle vestibular dysfunction may indeed exist. Other prominent pathologic features of the S1P2 receptor-null inner ear included cellular abnormalities within the stria vascularis by postnatal day 14 and subsequent base-to-apex degeneration of sensory hair cells within the organ of Corti, which were later accompanied by the loss of spiral ganglion neurons.How does the loss of S1P2 receptor function cause deafness and the associated inner ear pathology? A potential mechanism may be gleaned from the early cellular changes that occur within the stria vascularis. The stria vascularis is a highly vascularized, multilayer structure with (i) marginal cells facing the endolymphatic space, (ii) layers of flat interleaved basal cells facing the perilymphatic space, and (iii) capillaries and intermediate cells in the center. A major function of this structure is to establish the endocochlear potential by secreting K+ ions against an electrical and chemical gradient into the endolymphatic space, which is essential for mechanosensitive hair cell signal transduction (21Wangemann P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 576: 11-21Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar).Our imaging results demonstrate that the cellular organization of the S1P2 receptor-null stria vascularis is dramatically disturbed around the time when the endocochlear p"

A novel assay using water-soluble analogs of dihydroceramide, dihydroceramidoids (d-erythro-dhCCPS analogs), was used to measure desaturase activity in situ. Conversion of d-erythro-2-N-[12′-(1″-pyridinium)-dodecanoyl]-4,5-dihydrosphingosine bromide (C12-dhCCPS) to its 4,5-desaturated counterpart, d-erythro-2-N-[12′-(1″-pyridinium)dodecanoyl]sphingosine bromide (C12-CCPS), was determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. The validity of the assay was confirmed using C8-cyclopropenylceramide, a competitive inhibitor of dihydroceramide desaturase. A human homolog (DEGS-1) of the Drosophila melanogaster des-1 gene was recently identified and reported to have desaturase activity. Transfection of SMS-KCNR cells with small interfering RNA to DEGS-1 significantly blocked the conversion of C12-dhCCPS to C12-CCPS. The associated accumulation of endogenous dihydroceramides confirmed DEGS-1 as the main active dihydroceramide desaturase in these cells. The partial loss of DEGS-1 inhibited cell growth, with cell cycle arrest at G0/G1. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the amount of phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein. This hypophosphorylation was inhibited by tautomycin and not by okadaic acid, suggesting the involvement of protein phosphatase 1. Additionally, we found that treatment of SMS-KCNR cells with fenretinide inhibited desaturase activity in a dose-dependent manner. An increase in dihydroceramides (but not ceramides) paralleled this process as measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. There were no effects on the mRNA or protein levels of DEGS-1, suggesting that fenretinide acts at the post-translational level as an inhibitor of this enzyme. Tautomycin was also able to block the hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein observed upon fenretinide treatment. These findings suggest a novel biological function for dihydroceramides.

Cer is the central building block for sphingolipids. It serves as a precursor for the synthesis of more complex sphingolipids and is generated in cells by multiple pathways. Cer can be produced de novo from serine and palmitoyl-CoA via dihydroceramide (dhCer), followed by its desaturation to Cer by dihydroceramide desaturase. Although many of the enzymes of the de novo pathway and Cer have been extensively investigated, the enzyme dihydroceramide desaturase and its substrate dhCer have not been well characterized. Dihydroceramide desaturase is responsible for inserting the 4,5-trans-double bond into the sphingoid backbone of dhCer. The enzyme was previously characterized, and an in vitro assay was developed to determine its activity (6Michel C. van Echten-Deckert G. Rother J. Sandhoff K. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol.

Franke S. Zahringer U. Sperling P. Heinz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25512-25518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). These proteins contain three His-containing consensus motifs that are characteristic of a group of membrane fatty acid desaturases. The human homolog of des-1 is now referred to as DEGS-1 (DES1) and was first cloned in 1997 and named membrane lipid desaturase (11Cadena D.L. Kurten R.C. Gill G.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6960-6967Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It was identified using a yeast two-hybrid screen. It was reported that overexpression of membrane lipid desaturase inhibits biosynthesis of the epidermal growth factor receptor in Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-expressing 293 human embryonic kidney cells. Dihydroceramides are believed to be biologically inactive molecules. Treatment of cells with exogenous short chain dhCers has failed to inhibit cell growth and to induce apoptosis (12Bielawska A.

In this study on dihydroceramide desaturase in SMS-KCNR cells, we used a novel in situ assay to measure the activity of this enzyme using cell-permeable dihydroceramidoids (dhCCPS analogs) (15Szulc Z.M. Bielawski J. Gracz H. Gustilo M. Mayroo N. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Bielawska A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 7083-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). dhCCPS analogs represent a novel class of water-soluble long chain dhCers that can be delivered to cells in culture. The obtained data demonstrate that DEGS-1 is the main dihydroceramide desaturase active in SMS-KCNR human neuroblastoma cells and that inhibition of DEGS-1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) leads to the accumulation of endogenous dhCers with subsequent effects on cell growth, with cell cycle arrest and hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Activation of ceramide-activated protein phosphatases appears to be involved in this process. Furthermore, we have confirmed that dihydroceramide desaturase is a target for the synthetic retinoid fenretinide (N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-retinamide (4-HPR)). Reagents—d-erythro-2-N-[12′-(1″-Pyridinium)dodecanoyl]-sphingosine bromide (d-erythro-C12-ceramide; C12-CCPS) and d-erythro-2-N-[12′-(1″-pyridinium)dodecanoyl]-4,5-dihydrosphingosine bromide (d-erythro-C12-dihydroceramide; C12-dhCCPS) were synthesized in the Lipidomics Core Facility of the Medical University of South Carolina (15Szulc Z.M. Bielawski J. Gracz H. Gustilo M. Mayroo N. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Bielawska A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 7083-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). 4-HPR, all-trans-retinoic acid, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were obtained from Sigma. C8-Cyclopropenylceramide (C8-CPPC) was obtained from Matreya, LLC (Pleasant Gap, PA). Okadaic acid and tautomycin were obtained from BIOMOL International, L.P. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—The SMS-KCNR cell line was obtained from Dr. C. Pat Reynolds (Children's Hospital of Los Angeles) The MCF-7 cell line was obtained from Dr. Chiara Luberto (Medical University of South Carolina). Cells were maintained in growth medium (RPMI 1640) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. C8-CPPC was dissolved in methanol at a stock concentration of 10 mm, 4-HPR in 95% ethanol at a stock concentration of 100 mm, and all-trans-retinoic acid in Me2SO at a stock concentration of 100 mm. Stock solutions were diluted to the required concentrations (0.01–2.5 μm for C8-CPPC, 0.5–10 μm for 4-HPR, and 10 μm for all-trans-retinoic acid) just prior to use and then directly added to the cells in growth medium. Okadaic acid and tautomycin were dissolved in ethanol at a stock concentration of 10 μm. Okadaic acid and tautomycin were directly added to the cells in growth medium to obtain a final concentration of 10 nm 18 h prior to siRNA transfection or 4-HPR treatment. The final volume of methanol, ethanol, or Me2SO in the medium was <0.02%, which had no effect on cell growth or survival. In Situ Dihydroceramide Desaturase Assay—C12-dhCCPS was used as the substrate for this enzyme. C12-dhCCPS was dissolved in 100% ethanol at a concentration of 100 mm, and this stock solution was diluted just prior to use and directly added to the cells in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 μm. Cells were incubated with C12-dhCCPS for 15 min and 2, 6, and 24 h. The cells were collected at these time points, and the levels of C12-dhCCPS and its product (C12-CCPS) were detected by LC/MS (15Szulc Z.M. Bielawski J. Gracz H. Gustilo M. Mayroo N. Hannun Y.A.

LC/MS Analysis of Endogenous Ceramides and the Cellular Level of Ceramidoid (CCPS) and dhCCPS Analogs—Advanced analyses were performed in the Lipidomics Core Facility of the Medical University of South Carolina (hcc.musc.edu/research/shared_resources/lipidomics.cfm) on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple-stage quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in a multiple reaction monitoring positive ionization mode as described (15Szulc Z.M. Bielawski J. Gracz H. Gustilo M. Mayroo N. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Bielawska A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 7083-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Hannun Y.A. Bielawska A. Methods (Orlando). 2006; 39: 82-91Google Scholar). RNA Interference Transfection—Transient transfections were performed using HiPerFect (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's recommendations. siRNA to human DEGS-1 (GenBank™ accession numbers NM_144780 and NM_003676) and a nonspecific siRNA (Silencer® negative control) were purchased from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). Cells were treated with siRNA at least 24–48 h prior to the addition of dhCCPS analogs. Knockdown of target gene expression was confirmed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and Western blotting. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—One μg of total RNA (isolated using an RNA isolation kit from Qiagen Inc.) was used in reverse transcription reactions with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and random primers (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) as recommended by the manufacturer. The resulting total cDNA was then used in PCR to measure the mRNA levels of DEGS-1. The mRNA levels of 28 S rRNA were used as internal controls. Linear amplification cycles were determined separately for each gene. The following primers were used for PCR amplification: DEGS-1, 5′-TTCTTCTGTACCGCTTTCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTACTCCAGCACCATCTCT-3′ (reverse); and rRNA, 5′-TTACCAAAAGTGGCCCACTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAAAGATGGTGAACTATGCC-3′ (reverse). The reactions were performed at 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 30 cycles. The concentrations of rRNA primers were used at a 1:6 ratio compared with other primers to achieve linear amplification conditions in the same reactions. The RT-PCR products were quantitated by densitometry using Quantity One one-dimensional analysis software (Bio-Rad). The mRNA levels of DEGS-1 were normalized to the rRNA levels used as internal controls. The amplified fragments were separated on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Immunoblotting—The protein levels of DEGS-1, phosphorylated Rb (pRb), Rb, and β-actin were determined by Western blot analysis. In brief, total proteins (30 μg/lane) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto Immobilon™ membranes (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA), and detected using anti-DEGS-1 (1:2000), anti-pRb (1:1000), anti-Rb (1:1000), or anti-β-actin (1:1000) primary antibody for 1 h, followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:10,000) for 1 h. The proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL™ protein detection kit (GE Healthcare) as described by the manufacturer. Anti-DEGS-1 antibody (MLD 3906) was kindly provided by Dr. Gordon N. Gill (University of California, San Diego). Anti-β-actin antibody was purchased from Sigma. Anti-pRb (Ser795) was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Anti-Rb antibody was obtained from Pharmingen. Secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Protein levels were quantitated by densitometry using Quantity One one-dimensional analysis software. Cell Growth Assays—The effects of DEGS-1 siRNA cell growth were detected using a trypan blue exclusion method as described previously (17Kraveka J.M. Li L. Bielawski J. Obeid L.M. Ogretmen B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). SMS-KCNR cells were transfected with 10 nm siRNA to DEGS-1 or nonspecific siRNA. These cells, along with untransfected cells, were replated 24 h after transfection in 6-well plates at a density of ∼5000 cells/well. At 2, 4, and 6 days after plating, the cells were trypsinized and diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. The floating (dead) cells in the medium and the cells that remained attached to the plates were then counted using a hematocytometer in the presence of trypan blue solution (Sigma) at a 1:1 (v/v) ratio as recommended by the manufacturer. Triplicate wells were used for each treatment. The effects of increasing concentrations of 4-HPR on cell growth were detected using an MTT cell survival assay (18Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 943-946PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, ∼2000 cells were plated in 24-well dishes in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of 4-HPR. On days 0, 2, 4, and 6, the cells were incubated with MTT reagent at 37 °C for 4 h and then lysed overnight in lysis buffer at room temperature. MTT uptake was measured at 570 nm in a microplate reader. Untreated cells were used as controls. 4-HPR was added directly to the medium every 48 h. Triplicate wells were used for each treatment. Cell Cycle Analysis—The effects of inhibition of DEGS-1 by siRNA on the cell cycle profiles of SMS-KCNR cells at 48 h were analyzed in the presence of DNase-free RNase and propidium iodide by flow cytometry in the Flow Cytometry Facility of the Medical University of South Carolina as described previously (19Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Untreated and nonspecific siRNA-transfected cells were used as controls. Conversion of 4,5-Dihydroceramides to the Corresponding Ceramides—Positively charged cell-permeable analogs of d-erythro-C12-ceramide (C12-CCPS) and d-erythro-C12-dihydroceramide (C12-dhCCPS) were used as molecular probes to study dihydroceramide desaturase activity by monitoring conversion of C12-dhCCPS to C12-CCPS in intact cells by an LC/MS approach (16Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Hannun Y.A. Bielawska A. Methods (Orlando). 2006; 39: 82-91Google Scholar). This conversion is depicted in Fig. 1A. SMS-KCNR human neuroblastoma cells and MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells were incubated with 0.5 μm C12-dhCCPS for 15 min and 2, 6, and 24 h (Fig. 1B). The cells were collected at these time points, and the levels of C12-dhCCPS and C12-CCPS were measured by LC/MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The percentage of the conversion is shown in Fig. 1B. Desaturation to C12-CCPS was detected as early as 15 min (8 and 11% in SMS-KCNR and MCF-7 cells, respectively), and nearly total conversion was achieved by 24 h, with >80% conversion at 6 h. This assay was also performed with other human cancer cell lines, including lung adenocarcinoma (A549), squamous cell carcinoma (UM-SCC-1), and other neuroblastomas (SK-N-SH, IMR-32, and SK-N-RA), and similar results were obtained (data not shown). These experiments demonstrated that the desaturase is an active enzyme in these cells, proving this approach to be a powerful method to study the activity of this enzyme in intact cells. Because there was a >80% conversion of C12-dhCCPS to C12-CCPS at 6 h, this time point was selected to study potential inhibitors and activators of the desaturase enzyme. Prior to testing the action of various compounds on enzyme activity, the cytotoxicity of C12-dhCCPS was examined by MTT assay. There was no significant effect on cell viability of increasing concentrations up to 10 μm at 6 h in SMS-KCNR and MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Measurement of endogenous ceramide and dihydroceramide levels was also performed, and no changes in these sphingolipid levels were observed at 6 h (data not shown). Effects of the Desaturase Inhibitor C8-CPPC on Conversion of C12-dhCCPS to C12-CCPS—C8-CPPC is a known in vitro competitive inhibitor of dihydroceramide desaturase (20Triola G. Fabrias G. Casas J. Llebaria A. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 68: 9924-9932Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). At low concentrations, C8-CPPC inhibits dihydroceramide desaturase, whereas at high concentrations, it also inhibits sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase and serine palmitoyltransferase (21Triola G. Fabrias G. Dragusin M. Niederhausen L. Broere R. Llebaria A. van Echten-Deckert G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1671-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). SMS-KCNR cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations (0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 μm) of C8-CPPC for 30 min, and 0.5 μm C12-dhCCPS was added for 6 h (Fig. 2A). Cells were collected after 6 h, and the conversion to C12-CCPS was determined. Inhibition of DEGS-1 activity was observed in a dose-dependent manner starting at 0.1 μm, decreasing conversion levels to ∼40% C12-CCPS compared with ∼66% conversion in the untreated cells. The percentage of the conversion to C12-CCPS in cells treated with 0.5, 1, and 2.5 μm C8-CPPC was ∼27, ∼22, and ∼5%, respectively (Fig. 2A). Measurement of total endogenous Cer, dhCer, and sphingosine levels was also performed (Fig. 2, B–E) by LC/MS. Approximately 2.4-, 8.4-, and 4.8-fold increases in total endogenous dhCers were observed in cells treated with 0.5, 1, and 2.5 μm C8-CPPC, respectively, correlating with the inhibition of DEGS-1 (Fig. 2B). There was also a modest concentration-dependent decrease in total Cer levels: ∼8, 22, and 27% (Fig. 2B). There were no significant changes in dihydrosphingosine, dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate, sphingosine, or sphingosine 1-phosphate levels (Fig. 2C). The largest decrease in Cer species occurred in C24, which was the predominant Cer species in this cell line (Fig. 2D). All dhCer species were elevated; the largest increases occurred for those species that were predominant in this cell line, mainly C16, C24, C24:1, C26, and C26:1 (Fig. 2E). These results verify that C8-CPPC is a potent and total (not showing specificity for dhCer species) inhibitor of dihydroceramide desaturase and that inhibition of this enzyme with C8-CPPC leads to the accumulation of endogenous dhCers. Role of DEGS-1 in Mediating the Conversion of C12-dhCCPS to C12-CCPS—Although the experiments above revealed the action of a desaturase, it became important to determine whether this was mediated specifically by the primary dihydroceramide desaturase, DEGS-1. Therefore, siRNA against the human desaturase enzyme DEGS-1 was used to attenuate its expression and consequently inhibit its activity. SMS-KCNR cells were transfected with 10 nm DEGS-1 siRNA or nonspecific siRNA, and the conversion of C12-dhCCPS was evaluated after 48 h with the in situ desaturase assay. Knockdown of DEGS-1 mRNA levels was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 3A, left panel), with >75% knockdown of DEGS-1 mRNA achieved in SMS-KCNR cells. Decreased expression of the DEGS-1 protein in DEGS-1 siRNA-treated SMS-KCNR cells was also confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3A, right panel). Next, the effects of the loss of DEGS-1 on the conversion of dihydroceramide were evaluated (Fig. 3B). SMS-KCNR cells were transfected with siRNA (DEGS-1 or nonspecific) for 48 h and then, along with untransfected (control) cells, incubated with 0.5 μm C12-dhCCPS for 6 h. In the untreated (control) and nonspecific siRNA-transfected cells, ∼70% of the substrate C12-dhCCPS was converted to C12-CCPS. However, when expression of the enzyme was inhibited with siRNA, the conversion was significantly reduced, with only ∼4% conversion observed. Similar results were also obtained with MCF-7 cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that DEGS-1 is the major dihydroceramide desaturase in these cells. We next examined what effects inhibition of DEGS-1 would exert on endogenous sphingolipids (Fig. 3, C–E). For these experiments, cells were treated with 10 nm DEGS-1 siRNA or nonspecific siRNA for 48 h, and key sphingolipids were quantitated by LC/MS. As expected, there was an ∼13-fold increase in endogenous dhCers when the enzyme was inhibited, whereas the levels of endogenous Cer were decreased by ∼25 and 20% compared with untreated and nonspecific siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3, C and D). As seen with C8-CPPC, all dhCer species were elevated, with the largest increases occurring in the ceramide species predominant in these cell lines (C16, C24, C24:1, C26, and C26:1) (Fig. 3E). There were no significant changes seen in endogenous sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, or sphingosine 1-phosphate levels (data not shown). A time course study using siRNA against DEGS-1 (Fig. 4A) showed that the DEGS-1 protein was reduced by ∼50% by as early as 24 h (data not shown) and persisted even 6 days after siRNA transfection. LC/MS measurement of endogenous Cers and dhCers (Fig. 4, B–D) was performed 2, 4, and 6 days after siRNA transfection and demonstrated the persistent elevation of endogenous dhCers after silencing of the DEGS-1 protein. Endogenous dhCers were elevated by ∼18-fold, ∼22-fold, and ∼8-fold compared those in untreated cells on days 2, 4, and 6 after siRNA transfection, respectively. Taken together, these results demonstrate that DEGS-1 is the major dihydroceramide desaturase active in these cells and that inhibition of this enzyme with siRNA leads to the accumulation of endogenous dhCers. Effects of Loss of DEGS-1 on Cell Growth—In most cell studies, exogenous dhCers behave as “biological inactive compounds” compared with exogenous ceramides (12Bielawska A. Crane H.M. Liotta D.

To evaluate the biological role of the loss of DEGS-1 (which results in elevation of endogenous dhCers), we examined its effects on cell growth using a trypan blue exclusion method. SMS-KCNR cells were transfected with 10 nm DEGS-1 siRNA or non-targeting siRNA (nonspecific). As shown in Fig. 5A, treatment of these cells with DEGS-1 siRNA resulted in a significant inhibition of cell growth (∼65%) at days 4 and 6. We next determined the cell cycle profile of these cells after reduction of DEGS-1 expression at 48 h (Fig. 5B). Loss of DEGS-1 resulted in cell cycle arrest at G0/G1. In DEGS-1 siRNA-treated cells, 72% of the cell population was in the G0/G1 phase and 19% in the S phase, whereas in nonspecific siRNA-treated and untreated cells, 34 and 36% of the cell population was in the G1 phase and 44 and 54% in the S phase, respectively. Because loss of DEGS-1 resulted in G1 arrest, the phosphorylation status of Rb was examined next (Fig. 5C). pRb is critical for cell cycle progression; it regulates the G1/S phase restriction point, thereby controlling entry into the S phase (22Seville L.L. Shah N. Westwell A.D. Chan W.C. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2005; 5: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed, and a >50% decrease in the amount of pRb was seen in cells treated with siRNA to DEGS-1. There was no change in the level of total Rb (Fig. 5C, left panels). Ceramide has been shown to induce the dephosphorylation of Rb (23Dbaibo G.S. Pushkareva M.Y. Jayadev S. Schwarz J.K. Horowitz J.M. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2035648221,"T20 (Fuzeon), a novel anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug, is a peptide derived from HIV-1 gp41 C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR). Its mechanism of action has not yet been defined. We applied Pepscan strategy to determine the relationship between functional domains and mechanisms of action of five 36-mer overlapping peptides with a shift of five amino acids (aa): CHR-1 (aa 623–658), C36 (aa 628–663), CHR-3 (aa 633–668), T20 (aa 638–673), and CHR-5 (aa 643–678). C36 is a peptide with addition of two aa to the N terminus of C34. Peptides CHR-1 and C36 contain N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR)- and pocket-binding domains. They inhibited HIV-1 fusion by interacting with gp41 NHR, forming stable six-helix bundles and blocking gp41 core formation. Peptide T20 containing partial NHR- and lipid-binding domains, but lacking pocket-binding domain, blocked viral fusion by binding its N- and C-terminal sequences with gp41 NHR and cell membrane, respectively. Peptide CHR-3, which is located in the middle between C36 and T20, overlaps >86% of the sequences of these two peptides, and lacks pocket- and lipid-binding domains, exhibited marginal anti-HIV-1 activity. These results suggest that T20 and C36 contain different functional domains, through which they inhibit HIV-1 entry with distinct mechanisms of action. The multiple functional domains in gp41 CHR and their binding partners may serve as targets for rational design of new anti-HIV-1 drugs and vaccines.

Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Each of these steps can serve as a target for the development of HIV entry or fusion inhibitors. In the early 1990s, Jiang et al. discovered the first potent anti-HIV-1 peptide derived from the gp41 C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) region, SJ-2176, which inhibited HIV-1-mediated membrane fusion at nanomolar level (4Jiang S. Lin K. Strick N. Neurath A.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 113Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Later, Wild et al. (5Wild C.T. Shugars D.C. Greenwell T.K. McDanal C.B. Matthews T.J. Proc. Natl.

Med. 2003; 348: 2175-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), the first member of a new class of anti-HIV drugs, namely HIV fusion inhibitors. In 1997, Lu et al. (9Lu M. Kim P.S. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1997; 15: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) identified another CHR-peptide, C34, which covers the entire sequence of SJ-2176 and overlaps most of the T20 sequence and possesses more potent anti-HIV-1 activity than SJ-2176 and T20. They demonstrated that C34 could interact with N36, a peptide derived from the HIV gp41 N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) region, to form a stable six-helix bundle (6-HB), representing the gp41 core structure (9Lu M. Kim P.S. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1997; 15: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that the 6-HB core consists of three N36 molecules that form a trimeric core and three C34 peptides that bind to the grooves of N36 trimer in an anti-parallel manner (10Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the binding of gp120 to CD4 and a coreceptor, CXCR4 or CCR5, triggers the conformational changes of gp41, which include the interaction between the gp41 CHR and NHR to form a stable 6-HB core, bringing the viral and target cell membranes into close proximity. This viral fusion model has been employed for explaining the mechanism by which the CHR-peptides C34 and T20 inhibit HIV fusion, i.e. they interact with the viral NHR to form heterologous 6-HB and block the formation of the homologous 6-HB core between the viral NHR and CHR, thereby inhibiting HIV fusion. Indeed, C34 is very effective in inhibiting the gp41 6-HB formation (11Liu S. Zhao Q. Jiang S. Peptide. 2003; 24: 1303-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Liu S. Boyer-Chatenet L. Lu H. Jiang S. J. Biomol. Screening. 2003; 8: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, T20 is a weak inhibitor of the gp41 core formation, suggesting that T20 and C34, although they are derived from the same region, may have different mechanisms of action (13Liu S. Lu H. Xu Y. Wu S. Jiang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11259-11273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the anti-HIV-1 peptides derived from the gp41 CHR region may contain different functional domains, through which they inhibit HIV-1 fusion with distinct mechanisms of action. Here we applied a peptide-scanning (Pepscan) strategy to define the relationship between the functional domains in the gp41 CHR region and the mechanisms of action of the CHR-peptides. We designed and synthesized five overlapping peptides that cover the entire CHR region and compared their biological activities and biophysical properties. We found that the CHR-peptides that contain both NHR- and pocket-binding domains (e.g. CHR-1, C36, and C34) could interact with both the viral gp41 NHR region and the hydrophobic pocket on the NHR-trimer to form stable 6-HBs and block the gp41 core formation. The CHR-peptides that contain a major part of the NHR-binding domain and a lipid-binding domain (e.g. T20) may interact with both the gp41 NHR region and lipid bilayers in the target cell membrane to mediate anti-HIV-1 activity. These functional domains in the gp41 CHR region and their binding partners may be used as targets for designing novel HIV fusion inhibitors. Reagents—MT-2, TZM-bl, and HIV-1IIIB-infected H9 (H9/HIV-1IIIB) cells as well as T20-resistant HIV-1 strains were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Peptides N46, CHR-1, C36, CHR-3, T20, CHR-5, C34, T20-scramble, and T20-ANAA (see the sequences in Fig. 1) as well as C34-biotin (biotin was added to the N termini of C34) were synthesized by a standard solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl-)methoxycarbonyl) method as previously described (13Liu S. Lu H. Xu Y. Wu S. Jiang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11259-11273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These peptides were purified to homogeneity by high performance liquid chromatography. The identity of the purified peptides was confirmed by laser desorption mass spectrometry (PerSeptive Biosystems). HIV-1-mediated Cell-Cell Fusion—The inhibitory activities of the CHR-peptides against HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion were determined using a dye transfer assay as previously described (14Jiang S. Radigan L. Zhang L. Proc. SPIE. 2000; 3926: 212-219Crossref Google Scholar, 15Lu H. Zhao Q. Xu Z. Jiang S. J. Virol. Methods. 2003; 107: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of H9/HIV-1IIIB cells (2 × 105/ml), which were pre-labeled with Calcein AM, a fluorescent dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon), were incubated with a 50-μl peptide at a graded concentration at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of 100 μl of MT-2 cells (1 × 106/ml) in a 96-well plate. After coculture at 37 °C for 2 h, the fused and unfused Calcein-labeled HIV-1-infected cells were counted under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with an eyepiece micrometer disc (10 × 10 mm2) and a 10× objective. Four fields per well were examined, and the average percentage of cell fusion was calculated by the following formula: fused cells/(fused + unfused cells) × 100%. The wells for positive control were added with 50 μl of culture medium, instead of peptides, and 50 μl of Calcein-labeled, HIV-infected cells. The wells for negative controls were added with culture medium and Calcein-labeled, uninfected H9 cells. The percentage of inhibition of cell fusion by a peptide was calculated as previously described (14Jiang S. Radigan L. Zhang L. Proc. SPIE. 2000; 3926: 212-219Crossref Google Scholar, 15Lu H. Zhao Q. Xu Z. Jiang S. J. Virol. Methods. 2003; 107: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and IC50 (the concentration for 50% inhibition) values were calculated using the computer program CalcuSyn (16Chou T.C. Hayball M.P. CalcuSyn, Windows software for dose effect analysis. BIOSOFT, Ferguson, MO1991Google Scholar) kindly provided by Dr. T. C. Chou (Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). Native-PAGE—Native-PAGE as described previously (11Liu S. Zhao Q. Jiang S. Peptide. 2003; 24: 1303-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was used to detect the 6-HB formed by NHR- and CHR-peptides. In this study, NHR-peptide N46, instead of N36, was used as the CHR-peptide-binding partner, because N46 is longer than N36 by 10 amino acid residues and almost covers the entire NHR region. N46 (100 μm) was mixed with each of the CHR-peptides at a 1:1 ratio. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by addition of Tris-glycine native sample buffer (Invitrogen). The samples (20 μl) were then loaded onto Tris-glycine gels (18%; Invitrogen), which were run under 125 V constant voltage at room temperature for 2 h. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and then visualized with the FluorChem 8800 Imaging System (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). ELISA for Measuring Inhibitory Activity of CHR-peptides on the gp41 6-HB Formation between N46 and Biotinylated C34—A conformation-specific monoclonal antibody NC-1 (17Jiang S. Lin K. Lu M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10213-10217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used in a modified ELISA as previously described (18Gallo S.A. Wang W. Rawat S.S. Jung G. Waring A.J. Cole A.M. Lu H. Yan X. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Jiang S. Lehrer R.I. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18787-18792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) to determine the inhibitory activity of CHR-peptides on the gp41 6-HB formation between N46 and biotinylated C34 (C34-biotin). Briefly, a 96-well polystyrene plate (Costar, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) was coated with the monoclonal antibody NC-1 IgG (4 μg/ml in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.8). A CHR-peptide at graded concentrations was mixed with C34-biotin (0.25 μm) and incubated with N46 (0.25 μm) at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was then added to the NC-1-coated plate, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min and washing with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) 6 times. Then streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase (SA-HRP, Zymed Laboratories Inc., Invitrogen Immunodetection, S. San Francisco, CA) and the substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) were added sequentially. Absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured using an ELISA reader (Ultra 384, Tecan, Research Triangle Park, NC). The percent inhibition by the peptides was calculated as previously described (19Jiang S. Lu H. Liu S. Zhao Q. He Y. Debnath A.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4349-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and the IC50 values were calculated using CalcuSyn software (16Chou T.C. Hayball M.P. CalcuSyn, Windows software for dose effect analysis. BIOSOFT, Ferguson, MO1991Google Scholar). CD and Thermal Midpoint (Tm) Analysis—CD spectroscopy was performed to determine the conformation of NHR- and CHR-peptide complexes as previously described (11Liu S. Zhao Q. Jiang S. Peptide. 2003; 24: 1303-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, each of the CHR-peptides dissolved in PBS (50 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) at 10 μm was mixed with N46 in PBS at a 1:1 ratio. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the samples were then cooled down to 4 °C. The CD spectra of each sample were acquired on a Jasco spectropolarimeter (Model J-715, Jasco Inc., Japan) at 4 °C using a 5 nm bandwidth, 0.1 nm resolution, 0.1-cm path length, and an average time of 5.0 s. Spectra were corrected by the subtraction of a blank corresponding to the solvent composition of each sample. Thermal midpoint analysis was performed at 222 nm by applying a thermal gradient of 5 °C/min. The melting curve was smoothened, and the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition (Tm) values was calculated using Jasco software utilities as previously described (11Liu S. Zhao Q. Jiang S. Peptide. 2003; 24: 1303-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Preparation of Large Unilamellar Vesicles of POPC Liposome—1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) dissolved in chloroform was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and used without further purification. 20 mg of POPC stock solution was dried under a stream of nitrogen and stored under vacuum overnight to completely remove trace amounts of organic solvent. The dried lipid film was suspended by vortexing in 2 ml of PBS buffer. The multilamellar vesicle suspension was freeze-thawed for 5 cycles and then successively extruded through two stacked polycarbonate filters (0.1 μm) 13 times using an Avanti miniextruder. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence spectra of the CHR-peptides (10 μm) presented in PBS and POPC LUVs (2 mm), respectively, were obtained on a Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer, with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, and emission was scanned from 300 to 450 nm at a scan rate of 10 nm/s. Spectra were baseline-corrected by subtracting blank spectra of the corresponding solutions without peptide. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC was performed using a high-sensitivity ITC instrument (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). Solutions were degassed under vacuum prior to use. LUVs of POPC were injected into the chamber containing a peptide solution. The heats of dilution were determined in control experiments by injecting corresponding lipid vesicles into buffer and subtracted from the heats produced in the corresponding peptide-lipid binding experiments. Data acquisition and analyses were performed using Origin (Version 7.0, MicroCal). Measurement of Inhibitory Activity of Peptides on Infection of TZM-bl Cells by T20-resistant HIV-1 Strains—To compare the in vitro efficacy of C36 and T20 on infection by T20-resistant HIV-1 strains in TZM-bl cells (20Wei X. Decker J.M. Liu H. Zhang Z. Arani R.B. Kilby J.M. Saag M.S. Wu X. Shaw G.M. Kappes J.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1896-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar), 50 μl of a peptide at graded concentration in triplicate was incubated with an equal volume of an HIV-1 isolate at 0.01 multiplicity of infection at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by addition of the mixture to 100 μl of TZM-bl cells (1 × 105/ml) that were pre-cultured in a 96-well plate at 37 °C overnight. After further culture at 37 °C for 3 days, the cells were harvested and lysed with 50 μl of lysing reagent. The luciferase activity was analyzed using a luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and a luminometer (model Ultra 386, Tecan, Durham, NC) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The percent inhibition of luciferase activity, and the IC50 values were calculated as described above. Peptides CHR-1, C36, and T20 Exhibited Highly Potent Inhibitory Activities on HIV-1-mediated Cell-Cell Fusion—To determine the functional domains in the HIV-1 gp41 CHR region involved in the process of fusion between the virus and target cell membranes, five 36-mer CHR-peptides covering the CHR region (aa 623–678), namely CHR-1, C36, CHR-3, T20, and CHR-5 (Fig. 1) were synthesized for Pepscan study. The consecutive peptides each had sequence shifts of five residues. Peptide C36 covers the entire sequence of C34. The inhibitory activities of these CHR-peptides on HIV-1-induced cell-cell fusion were compared. As shown in Table 1, the peptide C36 exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity with IC50 < 5 nm. The peptides CHR-1 and T20 had similar potency in inhibiting HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion with IC50 in the range of 15–20 nm, whereas the peptides CHR-3 and CHR-5 showed marginal fusion inhibitory activity.TABLE 1Inhibitory activity of the CHR-peptides on HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusionCHR-peptidesInhibition of HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusionIC50IC90nm, mean ± S.D.CHR-117.27 ± 0.3126.41 ± 0.55C364.67 ± 0.077.04 ± 0.12CHR-31,470.00 ± 20.02,380.00 ± 35.00T2019.29 ± 0.2229.23 ± 0.45CHR-52,185.00 ± 15.002,858.00 ± 6.00T20-Scramble>20,000>20,000C348.20 ± 0.1312.37 ± 0.26 Open table in a new tab Unlike T20 and CHR-5, Peptides CHR-1, C36, and CHR-3 Could Form 6-HB with N46—CD spectroscopy was used to differentiate the secondary structures of the complexes formed between the NHR-peptide N46 (sequence shown in Fig. 1) and the CHR-peptides. N46 peptide alone in PBS formed typical α-helical structure, although its α-helicity was moderate (Fig. 2A and Table 2). The peptides CHR-1, C36, and CHR-3 interacted with N46 to form complexes with typical α-helical conformation (Fig. 2A). The α-helicity of these complexes are in the following order: C36 plus N46 > CHR-1 plus N46 > CHR-3 plus N46, in agreement with their Tm values (Table 2), suggesting that the α-helical complex formed by C36 and N46 is the most stable, whereas the one formed between CHR-3 and N46 is the least stable. These data are also consistent with the inhibitory activities of the respective peptides against HIV-1-induced cell-cell fusion, indicating that peptides CHR-1 and C36, like the peptide C34, inhibit HIV-1 fusion by interacting with the gp41 NHR region. Addition of the peptides T20 and CHR-5 to N46 did not enable the formation of typical α-helical complexes, but rather distorted the α-helical conformation and reduced the α-helicity of N46 (Fig. 2A and Table 2). This is in agreement with the reports by Wild et al. (21Wild C. Greenwell T. Shugars D. Rimsky-Clarke L. Matthews T. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1995; 11: 323-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and Lawless et al. (22Lawless M.K. Barney S. Guthrie K.I. Bucy T.B. Petteway Jr., S.R. Merutka G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13697-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that T20 could severely distort the α-helical conformation and reduce α-helicity of T21, a 37-mer peptide derived from the HIV-1 gp41 NHR region. These results suggest that the peptides T20 and CHR-5, although they may interact with the gp41 NHR region to form non-helical complexes, cannot associate with the viral N-helices to form a stable heterologous gp41 core.TABLE 2α-Helicity and Tm values of the complexes formed between N46 and the CHR-peptidesN46 plus CHR-peptide complex[θ]222Tm value103 deg cm2 dmol-1°CN46 plus CHR-1-25.8976.0N46 plus C36-30.9393.8N46 plus CHR-3-16.8268.0N46 plus T20-9.05UndetectableN46 plus CHR-5-12.65UndetectableN46-13.8170.5 Open table in a new tab Subsequently, we investigated whether these CHR-peptides can form 6-HBs with NHR-peptide N46 using the native-PAGE method (11Liu S. Zhao Q. Jiang S. Peptide. 2003; 24: 1303-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Each of the CHR-peptides was incubated with N46, respectively, at 37 °C for 30 min before analysis of the mixtures in the gel electrophoresis under native conditions. As shown in Fig. 2B, the peptide N46 (lane 1) showed no band as N46 carries net positive charges, thus it may migrate up and off the gel. Peptide CHR-1 (lane 2) exhibited a band located in the lower part of the gel. The mixture of N46 and CHR-1 (lane 3) had two bands: the lower band with less intensity located at the same position as that of CHR-1, and the upper one corresponding to the position of 6-HB formed by N36 and C34 (11Liu S. Zhao Q. Jiang S. Peptide. 2003; 24: 1303-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This suggests that the CHR-1 peptide can interact with N46 to form 6-HB. A similar 6-HB band was revealed in the lane where the mixture of C36 plus N46 (lane 5) was loaded. The mixture of CHR-3 plus N46 (lane 7) also showed a band of 6-HB, but having a relatively lower intensity than those formed by CHR-1 plus N46 and C36 plus N46. No 6-HB bands were revealed in the lanes where the mixtures of T20 plus N46 (lane 9) and CHR-5 plus N46 (lane 11) were loaded. But notably, the lower bands in these lanes were much less intensive than the corresponding bands in lane 8 (T20 only) and 10 (CHR-5 only). These results suggest that the peptides T20 and CHR-5 cannot form 6-HBs with N46, but may interact with N46 to form insoluble complexes or aggregates that cannot migrate into the gel. These data are consistent with the results obtained from CD analyses, which showed that mixing of T20 with N46 resulted in formation of non-helical complexes (Fig. 2A). Peptides CHR-1 and C36 Had Potent Inhibitory Activities on 6-HB Formation, whereas the Peptide T20 Exhibited Only Weak Inhibition—We used a modified ELISA (18Gallo S.A. Wang W. Rawat S.S. Jung G. Waring A.J. Cole A.M. Lu H. Yan X. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Jiang S. Lehrer R.I. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18787-18792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) to compare the inhibitory activities of the CHR-peptides on the gp41 6-HB formation between N46 and C34-biotin. As shown in Fig. 3, both CHR-1 and C36 strongly inhibited the 6-HB formation with IC50 values of 0.433 and 0.177 μm, respectively. T20 could also block the 6-HB formation, but exhibited much lower potency (IC50 = 4.616 μm) than CHR-1 and C36. The peptides CHR-3 and CHR-5 had no significant inhibitory activity against the gp41 core formation. These data further confirm that the peptides CHR-1 and C36 inhibit HIV-1 fusion by forming heterologous 6-HB with the viral NHR region, thereby blocking interaction between the viral NHR and CHR regions to form homologous gp41 core. However, the peptide T20 may act through a different mechanism, because it cannot form stable 6-HB with an NHR-peptide but can partially inhibit 6-HB formation between the peptides N46 and C34-biotin. Peptides T20 and CHR-5 Interact with Lipid Bilayers—Previous studies have shown that the HIV-1 gp41 6-HB interacts with lipid bilayers with substantial binding affinity (23Shu W. Ji H. Lu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1839-1845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), perhaps participating in the formation of a fusion pore. Because the CHR helices are located in the outer layer of the 6-HB, the CHR-peptides derived from the CHR region may bind to the lipid bilayers. We thus used the POPC LUV liposome system to detect the potential interaction of the CHR-peptides with lipid bilayers. Because all five CHR-peptides contain tryptophan residues, the tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of the CHR-peptides may change if they interact with the lipid bilayers. Significant blue shift of the fluorescence spectra was observed when the peptides T20 and CHR-5 were presented in the POP LUVs (Fig. 4b), compared with their presence in PBS (Fig. 4a), whereas other CHR-peptides did not show remarkable fluorescence spectra shift. These data suggest that both T20 and CHR-5 peptides may interact with the host cell membranes. We also used an ITC assay to determine the interaction of CHR-peptides with lipid bilayers. As shown in Fig. 4c, the highest heats released from binding were seen in the titration of POPC LUVs into a solution containing CHR-5. The binding constant of CHR-5 to POPC LUVs was 1.66 × 105 m–1. T20 ranked second with a binding constant of 5.41 × 104 m–1. The bindings of CHR-1, C36, and CHR-3 to POPC LUVs were very weak, and the binding constant could not be calculated by the Origin software (Fig. 4d). These results confirm that, unlike the other three CHR-peptides, the peptides T20 and CHR-5 can interact with lipid bilayers. Then, we determined which part of the T20 is critical for its interaction with lipid bilayers. It has been reported that a WNWF motif at the C terminus of T20 is critical to its inhibitory activity. Replacement of WNWF with ANAA results in the significant loss of T20-mediated anti-HIV activity (22Lawless M.K. Barney S. Guthrie K.I. Bucy T.B. Petteway Jr., S.R. Merutka G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13697-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 24Wild C. Dubay J.W. Greenwell T. Baird Jr., T. Oas T.G. McDanal C. Hunter E. Matthews T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12676-12680Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In the present study, we compared the lipid-binding activity of T20 with its mutant, T20-ANAA. As shown in Fig. 5, unlike T20, T20-ANAA could not bind to POPC LUVs as determined by both fluorescence spectroscopy and ITC assays. These results suggest that the WNWF motif at the C terminus of T20 is important for both its anti-HIV and lipid-binding activities. C36 Was Highly Effective against T20-resistant HIV-1 Variants—T20 could induce drug-resistant HIV-1 variants in patients shortly after use of T20 therapy (20Wei X. Decker J.M. Liu H. Zhang Z.

Jurriaans S. Lange J.M. Lu M. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12428-12437Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The determinant for T20 resistance is located in the N-terminal region of the gp41 NHR domain (26Rimsky L.T. Shugars D.C. Matthews T.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 986-993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we compared the inhibitory activities of C36 and T20 against a panel of HIV-1 variants with different sensitivities to T20. As shown in Table 3, T20 indeed was much less efficient in inhibiting infection by T20-resistant strains. However, C36 was highly potent against most T20-resistant strains tested, with effective inhibitory concentration (IC50) ∼3- to 250-fold lower than T20. These results indicate that C36 has a different resistance profile from T20, further suggesting that these peptides have different mechanisms of action.TABLE 3Comparison of inhibitory activity of T20 and C36 on infection by T20-resistant HIV-1 variantsHIV-1 variants (mutations in gp41)Catalog numberPhenotype (for T20)IC50T20C36nm, mean ± S.D.pNL4-3 gp41 D36G (parental NL4-3)#9489Sensitive10.73 ± 0.643.39 ± 1.45pNL4-3 gp41 (36G) V38A#9490Resistant76.97 ± 16.870.31 ± 0.12pNL4-3 gp41 (36G) N38E, N42S#9496Resistant1236.53 ± 187.3410.34 ± 1.59pNL4-3 gp41 (36G) N38A, N42T#9498Resistant1682.43 ± 87.4924.71 ± 11.34 Open table in a new tab After the determination of the x-ray crystal structure of the HIV-1 gp41 6-HB core consisting of the NHR- and CHR-peptides in 1997 (10Chan D.C.

To test whether STIM1 is required for ER refilling, we used RNA interference and measured Ca2+ signals in the cytosol, the ER, and the mitochondria of HeLa cells. Knockdown of STIM1 (mRNA levels, 73%) reduced SOC entry by 73% when sarco/endoplasmic Ca2+ ATPases (SERCA) were inhibited by thapsigargin but did not prevent Ca2+ stores refilling when cells were stimulated by physiological agonists.

[Ca2+]ER measurements revealed that the basal activity of SERCA was not affected in STIM1 knockdown cells and that [Ca2+]ER levels were restored within 2 min in physiological saline following store depletion. Mitochondrial inhibitors reduced ER refilling in wild-type but not in STIM1 knockdown cells, indicating that ER refilling does not require functional mitochondria at low STIM1 levels. Our data show that ER refilling is largely preserved at reduced STIM1 levels, despite a drastic reduction of store-operated Ca2+ entry, because Ca2+ ions are directly transferred from SOC channels to SERCA.

The depletion of ER Ca2+ stores, in turn, activates Ca2+-permeable channels at the plasma membrane to ensure long term signaling. This mechanism of store-operated Ca2+ entry was described 20 years ago (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar), and the prototypic store-operated channel CRAC (for Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channel) was extensively characterized (2Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism that activates SOC and CRAC channels upon ER depletion has long remained elusive (3Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). Two protein families, STIM and Orai, were identified recently as essential for SOC activity (4Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T.

STIM1 is a highly conserved type I ER membrane protein containing a luminal EF-hand domain and several cytosolic protein-protein interaction domains. Several evidences indicate that STIM1 is the ER Ca2+ sensor that regulates the activity of SOC channels: STIM1 redistributes into ER puncta located 10-25 nm from the plasma membrane upon Ca2+ store depletion, and puncta formation precedes the activation of CRAC channels by several seconds, consistent with a causal role of STIM1 in SOC activation (6Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Luik R.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). STIM1 EF-hand mutations constitutively activate SOC and induce puncta formation (4Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T. Myers J.W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Meyer T. Curr.

Cahalan M.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). Finally, STIM1 associates with the CRAC channel pore subunit Orai1, an interaction increased by store depletion (8Yeromin A.V. Zhang S.L. Jiang W. Yu Y. Safrina O. Cahalan M.D. Nature. 2006; 443: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), and also with the hTRPC1 channel (9Lopez J.J. Salido G.M. Pariente J.A. Rosado J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28254-28264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The other protein, Orai1 (also known as CRACM1), was identified by genetic linkage in a subset of patients with severe combined immunodeficiency, who lack functional CRAC channels (10Feske S.

As observed for STIM1, knockdown of Orai1 drastically reduced both store-operated Ca2+ entry and CRAC current (11Vig M. Peinelt C. Beck A. Koomoa D.L. Rabah D. Koblan-Huberson M. Kraft S. Turner H.

All three mammalian Orai homologues synergized with STIM1 to augment store-operated Ca2+ entry in the potency order Orai1 → Orai2 → Orai3 (15Mercer J.C. Dehaven W.I. Smyth J.T. Wedel B. Boyles R.R.

Mutagenesis studies then conclusively showed Orai1 to be the CRAC channel pore as point mutations in Orai1 transformed the Ca2+-selective, inwardly rectifying channel into an outwardly rectifying channel permeable to monovalent cations (8Yeromin A.V.

Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 2073-2079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). During store depletion, STIM1 and Orai1 move in a coordinated fashion to form closely apposed ER-plasma membrane clusters, and the clusters are associated with highly localized increases in subplasmalemmal [Ca2+] (18Luik R.M. Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The STIM-Orai interaction thus restricts Ca2+ influx to specific regions of the plasma membrane located 10 nm away from the ER. This cellular structure resembles the synaptic cleft and creates a diffusion barrier that prevents the escape of Ca2+ ions from the cleft. In these conditions, Ca2+ influx should be barely detectable with cytosolic Ca2+ dyes. Yet cytosolic Ca2+ dyes are used routinely to measure store-operated Ca2+ entry. One possible explanation is that SERCA inhibitors are often used to activate SOC. With SERCA inhibited, Ca2+ ions entering across SOC channels cannot be transferred to the ER and are thus more readily detected in the cytosol. Alternatively, STIM1 might bring together the ER and plasma membrane only in cells that express CRAC channels, such as Jurkat cells. Here, we tested the hypothesis that SOC influx occurs in membrane clusters closely apposed to the ER by measuring the impact of STIM1 levels on cytosolic, ER, and mitochondrial Ca2+ handling. STIM1 knock-down with siRNA markedly decreased SOC activity in HeLa cells but had surprisingly little impact on ER Ca2+ homeostasis because all incoming Ca2+ ions were directly taken up by SERCA pumps. These findings are consistent with the formation of clusters containing SOC channels on the plasma membrane and both STIM and SERCA proteins on the closely apposed ER membrane to enable efficient ER refilling with minimal changes in cytosolic Ca2+. Reagents—Minimum essential medium, fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent were obtained from Invitrogen. Histamine, thapsigargin, oligomycin, and rotenone were obtained from Sigma, CGP-37157 was from Calbiochem, and UTP was from GE Healthcare. YC3.6cyto and D1ER were kindly provided by Drs. Amy Palmer and Roger Tsien, and YC2.12mit was provided by Dr. Tullio Pozzan. RNA Interference—Small double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) were purchased from Ambion. All experiments were performed with the previously described hSTIM1-1140 siRNA (sense, 5′GGCUCUGGAUACAGUGCUCtt3′, antisense, 5′-GAGCACUGUAUCCAGAGCCtt3′) (4Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T.

The scrambled dsRNA (sense, 5′GUGCGACUGCUGGACUACUtt3′, antisense, 5′AGUAGUCCAGCAGUCGCACtt3′) was used as a negative control. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were grown in minimum essential medium containing 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For all experiments, cells were plated on 25-mm-diameter glass coverslips and co-transfected with plasmids (2 μg) coding for YC probes and dsRNA (80 nm) using Lipofectamine 2000. Cytosolic, ER, and mitochondrial recordings were performed using YC3.6cyto, D1ER, and YC2.12mit, respectively. All experiments were performed 2 days after transfection. Cytosolic Ca2+ Measurements—Experiments were performed in HEPES buffer solution containing (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 20 Hepes, 10 glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH. Ca2+-free solution contained 1 mm EGTA instead of CaCl2. Glass coverslips were inserted in a thermostatic chamber (Havard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) equipped with gravity inlets and vacuum outlets for solution changes. Cells were imaged on an Axiovert s100 TV using a ×40, 1.3 NA oil-immersion objective (Carl Zeis AG, Feldbach, Switzerland) and a cooled, 16-bit CCD back-illuminated frame transfer MicroMax camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ). For dual emission imaging of YC3.6cyto, D1ER, and YC2.12mit, cells were excited at 430 nm with a monochromator (DeltaRam, PTI, Monmouth Junction, NJ) through a 455-nm dichroic mirror and imaged sequentially at 475 and 535 nm using a filter wheel (455DRLP, 475DF15, and 535DF25, Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). Fura-2 fluorescence was imaged using alternate excitation at 340 and 380 nm and a 510WB40 emission filter. Image acquisition and analysis were performed with the Metafluor 6.2 software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Quantitative RT-PCR—Two day after co-transfection, cells were harvested by trypzination, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and subjected to cytofluorometric analysis. Green fluorescent protein-positive cells were sorted using a FACStar+ (BD Biosciences). Total RNA was isolated from the sorted cells using the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), and 0.5 μg of Dnase-treated RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using QuantiTec reverse transcription kit (Qiagen, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland). RT-PCR assays were carried out in an iCycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using the TaqMan system in a final volume of 25 μl. The reaction mix included 12.5 μl of ABsolute QPCR mixes (ABgene), 0.5 μm primers, and 0.1 μm specific Taqman probe. The sequences of the primer used were as followed: GAPDH, 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′ and 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′; STIM1, 5′-TGACAGGGACTGTGCTGAAG-3′ and 5′-AAGAGAGGAGGCCCAAAGAG-3′; GAPDH fluorogenic probe, 5′-FAM-CAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAGCC-TAMRA-3′; STIM1 fluorogenic probe, 5′-FAM-ACAGACCGGAGTCATCGGCAAGAAGBHQ1-3′. Taqman fluorogenic probe are labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at the 5′-end and with the fluorescent black hole quencher 1 (BHQ1) or with tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) used as fluorescent quencher at the 3′-end. For quantification, relative standard curves were created for each gene product, and a housekeeping gene, GAPDH, was used for normalization of the concentration. Relative expression was calculated using the 2-ΔΔCT method. Statistics—The significance of differences between means was established using the Student's t test for unpaired samples. The level of significance was defined as p < 0.05. Effect of STIM1 Knockdown on Calcium Release and Influx—To decrease cellular STIM1 levels, double-stranded RNAs designed against STIM1 were transiently transfected in HeLa cells, together with a “cameleon” Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent protein (YC3.6) that was used as a marker of transfection. Fluorescent cells were sorted by flow cytometry to select cells that presumably received the dsRNA, and quantitative RT-PCR was performed. As shown in Fig. 1A, STIM1 mRNA levels were decreased by 73% in fluorescent cells exposed to STIM1 dsRNA when compared with cells exposed to control, scramble dsRNA. To test whether STIM1 knockdown altered Ca2+ handling, we measured the cytosolic Ca2+ responses elicited by agonists and by SERCA inhibitors using ratio imaging of the YC3.6 fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 1B, the initial peak of the histamine response was identical in cells that received control or STIM1 dsRNA, whereas the subsequent plateau phase, which reflects Ca2+ influx, was nearly abrogated in STIM1 knockdown cells. As a result, the integrated Ca2+ response to histamine was inhibited by 72% in STIM1 knockdown cells (Fig. 1C). Consistent with a decreased Ca2+ influx but preserved Ca2+ store content, the addition of thapsigargin in Ca2+-free medium to passively deplete Ca2+ stores elicited similar responses in control and STIM1 knockdown cells, whereas the response elicited by the further readdition of Ca2+ was severely inhibited in STIM1 knockdown cells, the area under the curve being reduced by 73% (Fig. 1, B and C). These observations confirm previous results showing that Ca2+ influx, but not Ca2+ release from stores, is affected by STIM1 silencing. Effect of STIM1 Knockdown on the Refilling of Ca2+ Stores—The strongly reduced SOC influx but preserved Ca2+ store content suggested that STIM1 knockdown cells were still able to refill their internal Ca2+ stores. This observation is surprising because the primary role of SOC influx is to sustain ER refilling during physiological stimulations. To study the impact of STIM1 knockdown on the refilling of Ca2+ stores, we extensively depleted Ca2+ stores without altering the activity of SERCA. For this purpose, cells were repeatedly stimulated with histamine in the absence of external Ca2+ (Fig. 2A, phase i). As shown in Fig. 2, the amplitude and kinetics of the agonist-induced Ca2+ release were equivalent in control and STIM1 knockdown cells, confirming that STIM1 knockdown cells retained a normal Ca2+ store content (Fig. 2, B and C, phase i). After this extensive store depletion, Ca2+ was transiently readded to allow store refilling (Fig. 2A, phase ii), and cells were stimulated again with histamine to assess the content of Ca2+ stores (Fig. 2A, phase iii). Remarkably, no Ca2+ changes were observed in STIM1 knockdown cells during Ca2+ readmission, whereas the expected increase was observed in control cells (Fig. 2B, phase ii). As a result, the integrated “Ca2+ influx” response was nearly abrogated in STIM1 knockdown cells (-99%, Fig. 2C, phase ii). Despite the lack of visible Ca2+ influx, however, the final histamine stimulation elicited a large cytosolic Ca2+ increase in STIM1 knockdown cells (Fig. 2B, phase iii), the integrated Ca2+ response averaging 58% of control cells (Fig. 2C, phase iii). To verify that histamine efficiently depleted Ca2+ stores, we repeated this experiment using ATP and UTP as Ca2+-mobilizing agonists. The Ca2+ responses elicited by UTP and ATP were smaller than the responses induced by histamine, and Ca2+ influx remained undetectable in STIM1 knockdown cells (data not shown). When added to cells previously stimulated with histamine, UTP elicited a very small Ca2+ response, indicating that the agonist mobilizable store was efficiently depleted by histamine (supplemental Fig. S1). Importantly, Ca2+ influx remained abrogated in STIM1 knockdown cells, even when UTP was added in combination with histamine (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, although no Ca2+ changes were observed in the cytosol during Ca2+ readmission, Ca2+ stores were able to refill efficiently in STIM1 knockdown cells. Effect of External Ca2+ Concentration on the Refilling of Ca2+ Stores—The ability of STIM1 knockdown cells to remobilize Ca2+ from internal stores after the depletion/readmission protocol indicated that a “silent” supply of Ca2+ ions sustained the activity of SERCA pumps. To reveal this silent influx pathway, we varied the external Ca2+ concentration applied during the 5-min readmission phase, from 0 to 50 mm. As expected, when no Ca2+ was present during the refilling period, histamine could not remobilize Ca2+ from stores (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, at 0.2 mm [Ca2+], the responses were identical in control and STIM1-invalidated cells. In both conditions, Ca2+ influx was undetectable, and histamine could remobilize an identical amount of Ca2+ from internal stores (Fig. 3, C and D). The responses diverged markedly at higher Ca2+ concentrations, however. In control cells, Ca2+ responses increased in a dose-dependent manner with the external [Ca2+], both during Ca2+ readmission and during Ca2+ remobilization from stores (Fig. 3, C and D). In STIM1 knockdown cells, only minimal changes were observed during the readmission phase even at the highest Ca2+ concentration, but the amount of Ca2+ that could be remobilized by histamine increased with the amount of external Ca2+ supplied (Fig. 3, C and D). The response obtained in STIM1 knockdown cells with 50 mm Ca2+ approached the response obtained in control cells with 2 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 3D), indicating that Ca2+ stores could be completely replenished despite the lack of visible influx. Thus, increasing the external [Ca2+] enabled complete refilling of Ca2+ stores in STIM1 knockdown cells, but the entering Ca2+ ions remained undetectable in the cytosol. Effect of STIM1 Knockdown on ER Ca2+ Homeostasis—The major intracellular Ca2+ store is the ER, where the STIM1 protein resides (6Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Luik R.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The experiments shown in Figs. 2 and 3 indicate that external Ca2+ ions can reach the ER without altering cytosolic Ca2+ levels in STIM1 knockdown cells. To verify this observation, we directly measured the changes in the free ER Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]ER, using a cameleon probe targeted to the ER, D1ER (kindly provided by Dr. Amy Palmer, Boulder, CO). As illustrated in Fig. 4, A and B, the D1ER recordings showed that [Ca2+]ER levels decreased upon histamine stimulation and returned to resting levels upon Ca2+ readmission, both in wild-type and in STIM1 knockdown cells. The [Ca2+]ER changes correlated temporally with the changes in cytosolic Ca2+ measured simultaneously with Fura-2 during our depletion/readmission protocol (supplemental Fig. S2). The amplitude of the [Ca2+]ER changes during Ca2+ release and uptake was similar in all conditions (Fig. 4C), but detailed analysis of the D1ER responses revealed that the kinetics of ER Ca2+ refilling were slower in cells transfected with STIM1 siRNA (τ = 31 s) than in cells transfected with scramble siRNA (τ = 11 s, Fig. 4, D and F). In contrast, the kinetics of histamine-induced Ca2+ release were identical for both conditions (supplemental Fig. S3). Further stimulation with histamine elicited a second decrease in [Ca2+]ER, whereas a final stimulation with thapsigargin to extensively deplete Ca2+ stores elicited a slower and monotonic decrase in [Ca2+]ER. Importantly, [Ca2+]ER decreased with identical kinetics in wild-type and STIM1 knockdown cells exposed to thapsigargin (Fig. 4E). This indicates that the Ca2+ permeability of the ER was not affected, and by inference, that the activity of SERCA that counterbalances the ER Ca2+ leak was also unaffected. Thus, although Ca2+ ions reach the ER more slowly in STIM1 knockdown cells, SERCA activity is normal at low STIM1 levels, and resting [Ca2+]ER levels are restored in 2 min upon Ca2+ readmission. Effect of STIM1 on Mitochondrial Ca2+ Handling—The silent ER refilling revealed by STIM1 knockdown suggested that an organelle could relay Ca2+ ions from membrane channels to SERCA pumps on the ER. Mitochondria rapidly accumulate and release Ca2+ and thereby can provide such a Ca2+ relay mechanism. In addition, Ca2+ buffering by mitochondria has been shown to favor SOC influx by preventing the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of SOC channels (19Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). To investigate whether mitochondria participate in Ca2+ influx and ER refilling in STIM1 knockdown cells, we used a combination of rotenone (an inhibitor of complex I from the respiratory chain) and oligomycin (an inhibitor of the H+ ATPase) to dissipate the mitochondrial membrane potential and prevent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. In wild-type cells, the histamine-induced Ca2+ influx was severely inhibited by the mitochondrial inhibitors, which were applied shortly before Ca2+ readmission (Fig. 5A). The response during Ca2+ readmission was reduced by 69%, and the refilling efficiency, assessed as in Fig. 2, was reduced by 37% (Fig. 5, B and C). In contrast, in STIM1 knockdown cells, the refilling efficiency was essentially insensitive to mitochondrial inhibitors (Fig, 5C). As previously reported (20Frieden M. James D. Castelbou C. Danckaert A. Martinou J.C. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22704-22714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), mitochondrial inhibition significantly decreased thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx in control cells (Fig. 6, A and B). In this case, however, SOC influx was nearly abolished in STIM1 knockdown cells exposed to mitochondrial inhibitors, the integrated Ca2+ response averaging 11% of the response of control, untreated cells (Fig. 6, A and B). Thus, the residual channels of STIM1 knockdown cells do not appear to require functional mitochondria when SERCA are active but are sensitive to mitochondrial inhibitors when SERCA are inhibited by thapsigargin. To test whether the effect of oligomycin and rotenone reflected reduced Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria, we used CGP-37157, an inhibitor of mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange. This compound greatly reduces mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering without altering the ability of mitochondria to produce ATP (21Arnaudeau S. Kelley W.L. Walsh Jr., J.V. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29430-29439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, C and D, CGP-37157 prevented thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx as efficiently as the combination of oligomycin and rotenone in wild-type cells but had no effect on SOC entry in STIM1 knockdown cells.FIGURE 6Effect of mitochondrial ATP production and Ca2+ buffering on Ca2+ influx.

Pozzan). As shown in Fig. 6, E and F, large changes in [Ca2+]mit were observed upon Ca2+ readmission in control cells treated with thapsigargin. In STIM1 knockdown cells, the [Ca2+]mit response was much smaller, consistent with the cytosolic responses shown in Fig. 1, the integrated [Ca2+]mit and [Ca2+]cyt responses being reduced by 89 and 73%, respectively. Nonetheless, the [Ca2+]mit response was clearly visible in STIM1 knockdown cells during thapsigargin-induced influx, confirming that mitochondria were taking up Ca2+ at low STIM1 levels. These experiments indicate that mitochondria are located close to SOC channels and that SOC influx depends not only on STIM1 levels but also on the activity of SERCA and of neighboring mitochondria. In this study, we decreased the levels of the protein STIM1, a key activator of store-operated Ca2+ influx, to study how Ca2+ ions entering across membrane channels are transferred to the ER. We confirmed that the STIM1 protein is an important regulator of SOC influx; reducing STIM1 mRNA levels by 73% with siRNA caused a 73% decrease in the integrated Ca2+ response to thapsigargin, a robust and very sensitive assay for SOC activity. The excellent correlation between STIM1 mRNA levels and the magnitude of the thapsigargin response confirms previous studies showing that the flux of Ca2+ ions entering across SOC channels is limited by the amount of STIM1 proteins (4Liou J.

Despite the drastic reduction in SOC influx, however, Ca2+ handling was essentially normal in STIM1 knockdown cells, which maintained normal resting cytosolic Ca2+ levels, released a normal amount of Ca2+ from internal stores, and were able to replenish their Ca2+ stores efficiently. The major difference observed was that at low STIM1 levels, store refilling occurred without detectable changes in cytosolic [Ca2+]. Store reloading at resting [Ca2+]cyt was reported previously when the amplitude of Ca2+ influx was reduced pharmacologically with SOC blockers (22Byron K.L. Babnigg G. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 108-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or with receptor antagonists (23Takemura H. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) or when Ca2+ influx was spatially restricted to one side of the cell with a patch pipette (24Mogami H. Nakano K. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 49-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Our data confirm these early studies and show that a decrease in cellular STIM1 levels “silences” Ca2+ entry but has minimal impact on store refilling. The efficiency of Ca2+ stores refilling was quantified by two distinct approaches: 1) by remobilizing Ca2+ from stores after a brief refilling period and 2) by measuring Ca2+ changes within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The first approach revealed that store refilling was reduced by 42% in STIM1 knockdown cells kept for 5 min in physiological saline. Stores could be fully refilled by increasing the Ca2+ concentration from2to50mm during the Ca2+ readmission period, but even at this very high Ca2+ concentration, Ca2+ stores refilled without any visible cytosolic signal. When measured from within the ER, store refilling was very rapid, and [Ca2+]ER returned to resting levels within 2 min upon Ca2+ readmission. ER refilling proceeded more slowly in STIM1 knockdown cells than in wild-type cells, but in both cases, [Ca2+]ER returned within 2 min to prestimulatory levels in physiological saline. The kinetics of histamine- and thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ release were not altered by STIM1 knockdown, indicating that the permeability and InsP3 sensitivity of Ca2+ stores were normal in these cells. These observations indicate that cells can maintain normal levels of Ca2+ within the ER even with drastically reduced SOC activity. When Ca2+ influx is limiting, the few Ca2+ ions entering across the plasma membrane are rapidly carried to the ER without impacting on cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis. In cells containing a normal amount of STIM1, however, the large flux of Ca2+ ions through SOC channel clusters exceeds the capacity of subplasmalemmal SERCA. In this case, a significant fraction of the entering Ca2+ is taken up by nearby mitochondria and redirected to SERCA located farther from the plasma membrane (25Malli R. Frieden M. Osibow K. Zoratti C. Mayer M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44769-44779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 26Frieden M. Arnaudeau S. Castelbou C. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43198-43208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This trans-mitochondrial Ca2+ flux ensures that only a minimal fraction of the Ca2+ entering via SOC channels diffuses in the cytosol (Fig. 7A). The combined capacity of mitochondria and SERCA is fairly large, and in wild-type cells, cytosolic flooding is not observed when the external Ca2+ concentration is reduced to 0.2 mm. This mechanism ensures that during stimulation with physiological agonists, nearly all the entering Ca2+ ions are used by SERCA to refill the ER, either directly or indirectly via mitochondria. The situation is very different when influx through SOC channels is limiting because in STIM1 knockdown cells, the silent ER refilling was insensitive to mitochondrial inhibitors. This indicates that all the entering Ca2+ ions were directly captured by subplasmalemmal SERCA and not relayed by mitochondria. Mitochondria, however, were still located close to the active channels because a mitochondrial Ca2+ signal was detected when SERCA were inhibited by thapsigargin (Fig. 6). This indicates that, at low STIM1 levels, the Ca2+ uptake capacity of SERCA exceeds the flux of Ca2+ ions across the remaining functional SOC channels (Fig. 7B). Our data thus highlight a major role of SERCA in buffering subplasmalemmal Ca2+ ions, a role that is intrinsic to their Ca2+ pumping activity but was not fully appreciated before. SOC channels inactivate rapidly at high cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, and their sustained activity requires efficient buffering systems to prevent the buildup of Ca2+ near the mouth of the channel. Mitochondria were shown to prevent the Ca2+-dependent inactivation of SOC channels by buffering subplasmalemmal Ca2+ (19Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). SERCA can perform the same function, as shown in patch clamp studies (24Mogami H. Nakano K. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 49-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 27Liu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29891-29898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and in cells expressing transient receptor potential channels (28Lemonnier L. Trebak M. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 503-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our data show that, at low STIM1 levels, SERCA take up all the Ca2+ ions entering across SOC channels, thereby preventing channel inactivation and enabling efficient ER refilling. A similar conclusion was reached by Malli et al. (29Malli R. Frieden M. Hunkova M. Trenker M. Graier W.F. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using high K+ to reduce the electrochemical driving force for Ca2+ and thus the magnitude of Ca2+ influx. When Ca2+ influx exceeds the capacity of subplasmalemmal SERCA, mitochondria take up the excess Ca2+ and relay it to deeper ER regions. Finally, when both SERCA and mitochondria are saturated, the Ca2+-dependent inactivation of SOC channels shuts down the supply of Ca2+ ions. Thus, as depicted in the diagram of Fig. 7, three mechanisms contribute to minimize the diffusion of Ca2+ ions in the cytosol in the vicinity of SOC channels: 1) the presence of active SERCA on the juxtaposed ER membrane, which under physiological conditions take up most of the entering Ca2+ ions; 2) the presence of neighboring mitochondria, which scavenge the remaining Ca2+ ions; and 3) the Ca2+-dependent inactivation of SOC channels, which terminates Ca2+ entry when both Ca2+ scavenging systems are saturated. At low STIM1 levels, SOC influx did not require mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering but nevertheless required functional mitochondria (Fig. 6), indicating that local ATP production is also required for SOC channel activity. Because SERCA were inhibited by thapsigargin in this experiment, the mitochondrial ATP was not required as energy supply but most likely as a mobile Ca2+ buffer, as recently shown in lymphocytes (30Montalvo G.B. Artalejo A.R. Gilabert J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35616-35623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mitochondria located near the ER-PM junction are thus particularly important because they supply ATP used to buffer the entering Ca2+ ions and to energize SERCA and scavenge the excess of Ca2+ ions when SOC influx exceeds the capacity of SERCA. Our STIM1 knockdown study thus highlights the important role of the mitochondria located near the narrow and extended ER-PM junctions. Our [Ca2+]ER measurements further show that removing STIM1 proteins is well tolerated by the ER Ca2+ handling machinery. This is somewhat unexpected given the dominant role of STIM1 in the regulation of SOC entry. STIM1 contains a lumenal EF-hand domain that acts as a [Ca2+]ER sensor and a cytosolic domain that is both necessary and sufficient for the activation of SOC channels (31Huang G.N. Zeng W. Kim J.Y. Yuan J.P. Han L. Muallem S. Worley P.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). STIM1 interacts with Orai1 and TRP Ca2+ channels at the plasma membrane via its cytosolic ERM domain, but it is not known whether the only partners of STIM1 are plasma membrane Ca2+ channels or whether STIM1 also interacts with Ca2+ transporters on the ER membrane and modulate their activity. Our data indicate that STIM1 has minimal impact on the basal activity of ER Ca2+ transporters because decreasing STIM1 levels did not significantly alter resting [Ca2+]ER levels or the passive Ca2+ permeability of the ER. Since the [Ca2+]ER homeostasis is maintained by a “pump and leak” mechanism, this implies that the basal activity of SERCA Ca2+ pumps and of the Ca2+ leak pathway (which reflects the basal Ca2+ permeability of InsP3 receptors and other pathways, see Ref. 32Lomax R.B. Camello C. Van Coppenolle F. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26479-26485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) is not affected by the decrease in STIM1 levels. Thus, our data indicate that removing STIM1 proteins has minimal impact on ER Ca2+ homeostasis, confirming a recent study in Caenorhabditis elegans (33Yan X. Xing J. Lorin-Nebel C. Estevez A.Y. Nehrke K. Lamitina T. Strange K. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 443-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this model system, STIM1 knockdown inhibited store-operated Ca2+ entry but had no effects on Ca2+ oscillations and waves and did not induce ER depletion. Our data confirm these findings and show that STIM1 regulates the activity of SOC channels at the plasma membrane without modifying the activity of Ca2+ transporters located on the ER. The structure formed by the juxtaposition of the ER and the plasma membrane ensures the optimal delivery of Ca2+ ions to the reticulum and minimizes the Ca2+ contamination of the cytosol, creating a privileged pathway for ER refilling.

https://openalex.org/W2094092533,"The proteasome usually completely degrades its target proteins, but it can also degrade a handful of proteins in a limited and site-specific manner. The molecular mechanism for such limited degradation is unknown. The repressor forms of Gli2 and Gli3 transcription factors are generated from their full-length proteins through limited proteasome-mediated protein degradation. In this study, we have taken advantage of the fact that Gli3 is efficiently processed, whereas Gli2 is not, and identified a region of ∼200 residues in their C termini that determine differential processing of the two proteins. This region, named processing determinant domain, functions as a signal for protein processing in the context of not only Gli2 and Gli3 protein sequences but also a heterologous hybrid protein, which would otherwise be completely degraded by the proteasome. Thus, the processing determinant domain constitutes a novel domain that functions independently. Our findings explain, at the molecular level, why Gli2 and Gli3 are differentially processed and, more importantly, may help understand a probably general mechanism by which the proteasome degrades some of its target proteins partially rather than completely."
https://openalex.org/W2150971846,"Thalidomide, a sedative originally used to treat morning sickness and now used to treat leprosy and multiple myeloma, is also a teratogen that induces birth defects in humans such as limb truncations and microphthalmia. However, the teratogenic mechanism of action of this drug remains obscure. Thalidomide induces limb and eye defects in the chicken embryo at an EC50 of 50 microg/kg egg wt and apoptosis in primary human embryonic fibroblasts (HEFs) at an EC50 of 8.9 microM. Using these model systems, we demonstrate by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and whole-mount in situ hybridization that thalidomide-induced oxidative stress enhances signaling through bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps). This leads to up-regulation of the Bmp target gene and Wnt antagonist Dickkopf1 (Dkk1) with subsequent inhibition of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and increased cell death as shown by trypan blue and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling staining. Thalidomide-induced cell death was dramatically reduced in HEFs and in embryonic limb buds by the use of inhibitors against Bmps, Dkk1, and Gsk3beta, a beta-catenin antagonist acting downstream of Dkk1 in the Wnt pathway. Most interestingly, blocking of Dkk1 or Gsk3beta dramatically counteracts thalidomide-induced limb truncations and microphthalmia. From this, we conclude that perturbing of Bmp/Dkk1/Wnt signaling is central to the teratogenic effects of thalidomide."
https://openalex.org/W2077551455,"Cyclic AMP regulates multiple neuronal functions, including neurite outgrowth and axonal regeneration. GPR3, GPR6, and GPR12 make up a family of constitutively active G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that share greater than 50% identity and 65% similarity at the amino acid level. They are highly expressed in the central nervous system, and their expression in various cell lines results in constitutive stimulation of cAMP production. When the constitutively active GPCRs were overexpressed in rat cerebellar granule neurons in culture, the transfected neurons exhibited significantly enhanced neurite outgrowth and overcame growth inhibition caused by myelin-associated glycoprotein. GPR12-mediated neurite outgrowth was the most prominent and was shown to depend on Gs and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Moreover, the GPR12-mediated rescue from myelin-associated glycoprotein inhibition was attributable to cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated inhibition of the small GTPase, RhoA. Among the three receptors, GPR3 was revealed to be enriched in the developing rat cerebellar granule neurons. When the endogenous GPR3 was knocked down, significant reduction of neurite growth was observed, which was reversed by expression of either GPR3 or GPR12. Taken together, our results indicate that expression of the constitutively active GPCRs up-regulates cAMP production in neurons, stimulates neurite outgrowth, and counteracts myelin inhibition. Further characterization of the GPCRs in developing and injured mammalian neurons should provide insights into how basal cAMP levels are regulated in neurons and could establish a firm scientific foundation for applying receptor biology to treatment of various neurological disorders."

In this report, we characterize a potential conformational or functional checkpoint affecting CaR stability during biogenesis: gain-of-function mutations or the allosteric agonist NPS R-568 stabilize CaR and increase CaR abundance, whereas loss-of-function mutations or the allosteric antagonist NPS 2143 destabilize CaR and increase degradation by ERAD. Treatment of loss-of-function mutants with NPS R-568 increases processing of the 130-kDa form to the mature 150-kDa form, resulting in increased plasma membrane localization and robust signaling in response to 5 mm Ca2+, suggesting that some CaR mutations cause a protein folding/processing defect (17Kim P.S.

Traffic. 2004; 5: 821-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These results suggest that long-term treatment with calcimimetics and calcilytics can regulate turnover of CaR, providing unique possibilities for interventions in Ca2+ handling diseases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human CaR, NPS R-568 ((R)-N-(3-methoxy-α-phenylethyl)-3-(2′-chlorophenyl)-1-propylamine hydrochloride), and NPS 2143 ((R)-N-(3-methoxy-α-phenylethyl)-3-(2′-chlorophenyl)-1-propylamine hydrochloride) were kind gifts from K. Seuwen (Novartis Pharma, AG).Plasmid Construction—CaR with an amino-terminal FLAG epitope (FLAG-CaR) was generated as described (19Zhang M. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11140-11146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Point mutations in FLAG-CaR were generated by inverse PCR mutagenesis (20Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 814-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with Pfu Ultra High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and verified by dideoxy-DNA sequencing (Weis Center Sequencing Facility). Primer sequences are available upon request.Cell Transfection—HEK293 cells (American Tissue Culture Collection) were transiently transfected with Novafector (Venn Nova LLC) and cultured as described (1Huang Y. Niwa J. Sobue G. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11610-11617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Prior to assay, transfected cells were treated for 12 h with drugs including 10 μm MG132, 10 μm NPS R-568, or 10 μm NPS 2143, solubilized in 1% Me2SO. 1% Me2SO was also compared with no drug treatment, because Me2SO has been shown to act as a chemical chaperone in some systems (18Ulloa-Aguirre A. Janovick J.A. Brothers S.P. Conn P.M. Traffic. 2004; 5: 821-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Transfected HEK293 cells were lysed, proteins were immuno-precipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and resolved by SDS-PAGE as described (1Huang Y.

Nitrocellulose membranes were probed with anti-CaR polyclonal antibody (LRG, 1:1000), and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Super West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate, Pierce), and quantitated as described (1Huang Y.

Untransfected HEK293 cells were used to estimate background.Assay of Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase (ERK1/2) Activation—Transiently transfected HEK293 cells were incubated overnight in serum-free 0.5 mm Ca2+ DMEM plus drugs, as indicated in the figure legends, exposed to 0.5 or 5 mm Ca2+ (10 min, 37 °C). ERK1/2 phosphorylation was analyzed as described (19Zhang M. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol.

Niwa J. Sobue G. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11610-11617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying differential sorting of CaR to the Golgi complex and plasma membrane or ERAD pathway are unknown. To determine whether there is a conformational or functional checkpoint in CaR biogenesis, we used the sensitivity of CaR mutants to the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 as an indicator of degradation via ERAD (1Huang Y. Niwa J. Sobue G. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11610-11617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells transiently transfected with equivalent amounts of cDNA for FLAG-tagged WT CaR, the loss-of-function mutant R795W (22Hu J. Spiegel A.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metabol. 2003; 14: 282-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), or the gain-of-function mutant A843E (22Hu J. Spiegel A.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metabol. 2003; 14: 282-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), were treated without or with 10 μm MG132 for 12 h. Western blots of immunoprecipitated CaR revealed that MG132 increased the amount of WT CaR (173.8 ± 10.2% relative to Me2SO) (Fig. 1, A and D). MG132 similarly increased the amount of the loss-of-function mutant R795W (from 80.2 ± 7.0% (control) to 134.9 ± 6.0% (MG132)), but had no effect on the gain-of-function mutant A843E (117.5.2 ± 2.9% (control) versus 119.1 ± 2.7% (MG132)) (Fig. 1, A, D, and E). Mutant CaR abundance in the absence or presence of MG132 were normalized to the abundance of WT CaR in the absence of MG132 to illustrate baseline expression of the mutants relative to WT CaR and the effect of treatment with MG132. WT CaR and mutants were seen as doublets with molecular masses of 130/150 kDa in the monomeric and corresponding dimeric forms (Fig. 1A), indicating that all undergo glycosylation and dimerization (23Ray K. Clapp P. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34558-34567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To determine whether the differential sensitivity to degradation is generalizable to additional CaR mutants, the effect of MG132 was quantified for loss-of-function CaR mutants identified in patients with FHH or NSHPT, having decreased sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ (R66C, R185Q, R680C, and V817I) and gain-of-function CaR mutants from patients with ADH having increased sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ (F128L, E191K, Q681H, and F788C) (Table 1) (22Hu J. Spiegel A.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metabol. 2003; 14: 282-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All loss-of-function mutants exhibited decreased expression relative to WT CaR (summarized in Fig. 1D, black bars), and MG132 significantly increased the amount of each loss-of-function mutant (R66C, 44.7 ± 4.9% (control) to 98.1 ± 7.9% (MG132); R185Q, 62.4 ± 7.6% (control) to 114.6 ± 11.0% (MG132); R680C, 40.0 ± 8.0% (control) to 96.4 ± 5.5% (MG132); and V817I, 85.7 ± 13.0% (control) to 121.3 ± 10.0% (MG132)) (Fig. 1, B and D). Thus, for all loss-of-function mutants examined, treatment with MG132 increased abundance of the mutants to a level equal to or greater than the amount of WT CaR under control conditions. Treatment with MG132 also increased maturation of CaR loss-of-function mutants, as reflected in the abundance of the mature 150-kDa and corresponding dimeric forms.TABLE 1Summary of the properties of functional CaR mutants in the present studyReceptor mutantMutation location (41Hu J.

Open table in a new tab In contrast, all gain-of-function mutants exhibited baseline abundance greater than WT CaR (summarized in Fig. 1E, black bars), and MG132 did not alter the abundance of gain-of-function mutants (normalized to the abundance of WT CaR in the absence of MG132: F128L, 148.5 ± 5.7 (control) to 152.8 ± 5.6% (MG132); E191K, 147.9 ± 5.7 (control) to 156.2 ± 3.7% (MG132); Q681H, 113.8 ± 9.3 (control) to 117.0 ± 9.1% (MG132); and F788C, 123.4 ± 8.2 (control) to 126.3 ± 6.0% (MG132)) (Fig. 1, C and E). These results demonstrate that gain-of-function CaR mutants are more stable than loss-of-function mutants, i.e. less subject to ERAD. The two classes of mutants are defined functionally by their decreased (loss-of-function) or increased (gain-of-function) signaling responses to extracellular Ca2+. The free Ca2+ concentration in the ER is estimated to be in the range of 1–400 μm, depending upon the filling state of the stores (24Michalak M. Parker J.M. Opas M. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and glutathione (oxidized > reduced forms) is also present (25Chakravarthi S. Jessop C.E. Bulleid N.J. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The free concentrations of Ca2+ plus glutathione are sufficient to activate CaR (EC50 for Ca2+ ≈ 3 mm (3Chattopadhyay N. Brown E.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2006; 89: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Tfelt-Hansen J. Brown E.M. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab.

Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but maximal activation of CaR is observed with 0.5 mm Ca2+ plus 10 μm GSH or GSSG (6Wang M. Yao Y. Kuang D. Hampson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8864-8870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)). We therefore hypothesize that there is a conformational or functional checkpoint in the ER quality control of CaR biogenesis, i.e. loss-of-function mutants that predominantly exist in inactive conformation(s) are less stable than gain-of-function mutants that can achieve active conformation(s) in the ER.Allosteric Modulators Differentially Regulate the Stability of WT CaR—Mutations may alter CaR stability by a variety of potential mechanisms, so we sought to confirm the hypothesis using WT CaR. The allosteric modulators NPS R-568 and NPS 2143 are able to alter CaR activation in the presence of constant Ca2+ concentrations (reviewed in Ref. 26Nagano N. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 109: 339-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), so we determined whether chronic treatment with these allosteric modulators could affect the abundance of WT CaR. NPS R-568 is an allosteric agonist that binds the transmembrane domain and acts synergistically with Ca2+ to activate CaR (12Miedlich S.U. Gama L. Seuwen K. Wolf R.M. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7254-7263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), whereas the allosteric antagonist NPS 2143 acts at the same site to antagonize Ca2+-dependent CaR activation (12Miedlich S.U. Gama L. Seuwen K. Wolf R.M. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7254-7263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells transiently expressing WT FLAG-CaR were incubated without drugs or with Me2SO, MG132, NPS R-568, or NPS 2143 for 12 h, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody followed by immunoblotting. Me2SO (1%), the solvent for MG132 and the NPS compounds, had no effect on CaR abundance. NPS R-568 doubled the amount of CaR protein (200.5 ± 19.1%), comparable with the increase observed upon addition of MG132 (163.6 ± 12.1%), whereas NPS 2143 decreased CaR abundance (72.6 ± 4.6%) (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the effects of NPS R-568 and NPS 2143 on CaR abundance were the result of drug-mediated alterations in CaR susceptibility to ERAD, the effect of MG132 on CaR abundance in the presence of NPS R-568 or NPS 2143 was examined. MG132 had no effect on the amounts of WT FLAG-CaR in cells treated with NPS R-568 (101.2 ± 1.9% relative to control), whereas MG132 caused a significant increase in WT FLAG-CaR in cells treated with NPS 2143 (194.1 ± 4.9% relative to control) (Fig. 2B). The effects of the allosteric modulators were the result of specific binding to the transmembrane domain of CaR, because neither modulator affected the abundance of the CaR mutant E837I, which disrupts the allosteric binding site for both NPS R-568 and NPS 2143 (Fig. 2C) (12Miedlich S.U. Gama L. Seuwen K. Wolf R.M. Breitwieser G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7254-7263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These results imply that WT CaR is more sensitive to ERAD when inactive conformations are favored by either mutation (Fig. 1) or drugs (Fig. 2), and conversely, is stabilized by mutations or drugs that favor active conformation(s).FIGURE 2Allosteric modulators differentially regulate abundance of WT CaR protein.

NPS R-568 increased WT CaR and R795W abundance, but had no effect on the gain-of-function mutant A843E (Fig. 3A). Conversely, NPS 2143 treatment decreased the amounts of WT CaR and the gain-of-function mutant A843E, but had no effect on the loss-of-function mutant R795W (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that allosteric modulators are able to stabilize distinct conformations of CaR mutants thereby affecting receptor stability. Importantly, NPS R-568 increased the protein amounts of all loss-of-function mutants (R66C, R186Q, R680C, and V817I, Fig. 4A), whereas it had no effect on levels of gain-of-function mutants (Fig. 4C). Stabilization of loss-of-function mutants led to the appearance (R680C) or increase (R185Q, V817I) in glycosylated forms (Fig. 4A). In contrast, NPS 2143 decreased the amount of all gain-of-function mutants (Fig. 4D), whereas it had no effect on the loss-of-function mutants (Fig. 4B).

PPR proteins play essential roles in organelle-related functions, mostly in RNA-processing steps in plastids and mitochondria. In the moss Physcomitrella patens, there is also a large gene family, but the moss PPR proteins are likely to be divergent from those of higher plants. To investigate the function of plastid PPR proteins, we have generated and characterized a PPR protein gene disruptant of P. patens. The PPR531-11-disrupted mosses displayed abnormal phenotypic characteristics, such as a significantly smaller protonemal colony, different chloroplast morphology, and incomplete thylakoid membrane formation. In addition, the quantum yield of photosystem II was reduced in the disrupted mosses. To further investigate whether disruption of the PPR531-11 gene affects chloroplast gene expression, we performed Northern blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses. These analyses revealed that PPR531-11 has a role in intergenic RNA cleavage between clpP and 5′-rps12 and in the splicing of clpP pre-mRNA. Western blot analysis showed that disruption of PPR531-11 resulted in a reduced level of ClpP, photosystem II reaction center protein D1, and the stromal enzyme, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. These reductions might result in the severely retarded growth of the protonemal colony. Taken together, we propose a model where PPR531-11 function affects the steady-state level of ClpP, which regulates the formation and maintenance of thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts.

Plant J. 2004; 38: 152-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), chloroplast biogenesis (10Williams P.M. Barkan A. Plant J. 2003; 36: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and early or late embryogenesis (11Cushing D.A. Forsthoefel N.R. Gestaut D.R. Vernon D.M. Planta. 2005; 221: 424-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 12Ding Y.H. Liu N.Y. Tang Z.S. Liu J. Yang W.C. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 815-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Many chloroplast genes of land plants are cotranscribed as polycistronic pre-RNAs, which are then extensively processed into shorter mature RNA species (13Sugita M. Sugiura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Recently, several lines of evidence that PPR proteins are involved in post-transcriptional regulation in chloroplast gene expression have accumulated. For instance, the maize PPR protein CRP1 is required for intergenic RNA processing of petB and petD dicistronic mRNA (8Fisk D.G. Walker M.B. Barkan A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2621-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The maize protein PPR2 was shown to exist in large macromolecular complexes in the chloroplast stroma and was suggested to function in the synthesis or assembly of the plastid translation machinery (10Williams P.M. Barkan A. Plant J. 2003; 36: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis HCF152 protein is a plastid RNA-binding protein that is involved in the 5′ processing and splicing of petB pre-mRNA (14Meierhoff K. Felder S. Nakamura T. Bechtold N. Schuster G. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1480-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 15Nakamura T. Meierhoff K. Westhoff P. Schuster G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4070-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis CRR2 protein is essential for the processing of rps7-ndhB dicistronic mRNA (16Hashimoto M. Endo T. Peltier G. Tasaka M. Shikanai T. Plant J. 2003; 36: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Thus, PPR proteins might be involved in certain steps of RNA maturation in a gene-specific manner. Interestingly, some PPR proteins have also been identified as DNA-binding proteins (12Ding Y.H. Liu N.Y. Tang Z.S. Liu J. Yang W.C. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 815-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Ikeda T.M. Gray M.W. Mol.

Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 176-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Despite the large number of PPR proteins in plants, there is only fragmented information concerning the relationship between PPR proteins and their target RNA or DNA molecules.The moss Physcomitrella patens has recently emerged as a powerful model system in plant functional genomics (19Cove D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The genome sequences are known for the chloroplast (20Sugiura C. Kobayashi Y. Aoki S. Sugita C. Sugita M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5324-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the mitochondrion (21Terasawa K. Odahara M. Kabeya Y. Kikugawa T. Sekine Y. Fujiwara M. Sato N. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and the nucleus (22Nishiyama T. Fujita T. Shin I.T. Seki M. Nishide H. Uchiyama I. Kamiya A. Carninci P. Hayashizaki Y. Shinozaki K. Kohara Y. Hasebe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8007-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Gene targeting is feasible in the nuclear and chloroplast genomes (23Schaefer D.G. Zryd J.P. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1195-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 24Sugiura C. Sugita M. Plant J. 2004; 40: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the P. patens gametophyte, the haploid phase of the life cycle, is dominant, making it possible to study the phenotypes of knock-outs directly without further crosses. We previously identified and characterized two chloroplast-localized PPR proteins, PPR513-10 and PPR566-6, from P. patens. Their genes were expressed differentially in protonemata grown under different light-dark conditions, suggesting that they have distinctive functions in chloroplasts (3Hattori M. Hasebe M. Sugita M. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 343: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To investigate the function of chloroplast PPR proteins, we generated and characterized the PPR531-11 (an isoform of PPR513-10) protein gene disruptant. In this study, a chloroplast PPR gene disrupted moss displayed abnormal phenotypic characteristics, such as significantly retarded growth of the protonemal colonies and smaller chloroplasts with an abnormal thylakoid membrane structure. Moreover, disruption of PPR531-11 resulted in aberrant RNA processing of clpP pre-mRNA. This is the first identification of an RNA species targeted by the moss chloroplast PPR protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant Material and Culture Conditions—The protonemata (juvenile gametophores) and the leafy shoots (adult gametophores) of P. patens subspecies patens were grown at 25 °C under continuous light (30 μmol/m2/s) on solidified BCD medium (25Nishiyama T. Hiwatashi Y. Sakakibara I. Kato M. Hasebe M. DNA Res. 2000; 7: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). For vegetative propagation, the protonemata were collected every 4 days and spread on fresh plates (26Miyata Y. Sugita M. J. Plant Physiol. 2004; 161: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Total cellular DNA and RNA and chloroplasts were isolated from the 4-day-old protonemata.Isolation of DNA and RNA—Total cellular DNA was prepared by a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method as described (27Murray M.G. Thompson W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4321-4325Crossref PubMed Scopus (9200) Google Scholar) and treated with RNase A (TaKaRa) to remove residual RNAs. Total cellular RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen), chloroform, and isoamyl alcohol and finally treated with DNase I (TaKaRa). Chloroplast RNA was prepared from the isolated chloroplasts as described previously (28Kabeya Y. Sato N. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).cDNA and Genomic DNA Sequencing—The genomic region of the PPR531-11 gene was amplified from total cellular DNA by PCR with the primers: 5′-GAGGAGGCTGTGTTAGAGGTCT-3′ and 5′-GATCACTTGGAACAAACTGCCG-3′ (3Hattori M. Hasebe M. Sugita M. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 343: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The amplified DNA fragment (3879 bp) was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate plasmid pMH1-1 and was sequenced using an ABI3100 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Applied Biosystems) and appropriate primers as described previously (3Hattori M. Hasebe M. Sugita M. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 343: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). cDNA derived from constitutively spliced mRNA coding for PPR531-11 was amplified and sequenced as described before (3Hattori M. Hasebe M. Sugita M. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 343: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence data were deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ databases (accession nos. AB267806 (PPR531-11 gene) and AB267854 (PPR531-11 cDNA)).Moss Transformation—To disrupt the PPR531-11 gene, the genomic region of the gene was amplified from pMH1-1 with the primers: P1, 5′-ATGGCTGGTTTGCCGGTGGCT-3′ and P2, 5′-AGATAAAGTTTCTAGGCTGATT-3′. The amplified DNA fragment (3288 bp) was cloned into pGEM-T Easy to generate pMH1-2. The chimeric nptII gene cassette from pMBL6, which consists of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S gene promoter, the nptII coding region, and the 35S gene terminator, was excised as a 1973-bp EcoRV fragment. This fragment was inserted into the blunted StuI site in the fifth exon of the PPR531-11 gene in pMH1-2. The resulting plasmid, pMH1-3, was digested by NotI and introduced into the P. patens protonemata protoplasts as described (23Schaefer D.G. Zryd J.P. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1195-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Transformed mosses were cultured on BCDAT medium containing 50 mg/liter Geneticin (G418, Wako). Gene disruption was confirmed by PCR with the primers: P3, 5′-GCAATATGCTCAAGCTCAAGG-3′ and P4, 5′-CCCATCATACTCTCTGCCATT-3′, and by genomic Southern blot analysis. A PPR531-11 gene probe (531 bp) was amplified using primers, 5′-TTGTTGCAGCATATGGGAAGGC-3′ and 5′-CCTCCATGACAGATGTATAAGTG-3′, and labeled using a digoxigenin DNA labeling and detection kit (Roche Diagnostics).Phenotypic Observation, Chlorophyll Content, and Chlorophyll Fluorescence Properties—External phenotypes of protonemata and leafy shoots were observed using an Olympus SZX12 stereomicroscope and an Olympus BX-50 fluorescence microscope. Chlorophyll content was determined as described previously (29Arnon D.I. Whatley F.R. Science. 1949; 110: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Analytical photosystem II (PSII) fluorescence measurements were carried out with a pulse-amplitude modulated fluorometer (PAM 101/103, H. Walz, Effeltrich). 4-day-old protonemal tissue (1 g fresh weight) was placed at the bottom in a 50-ml plastic tube and dark-adapted for 5 min before measurement. The quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (φPSII) was calculated as previously described (30Genty E. Brazier J.L. Lesca P. Riviere J.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 3885-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).Electron Microscopic Observations—5-day-old protonemata and 30-day-old gametophores were fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde and 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.05 m phosphatase buffer (pH 7.2). The samples were dehydrated through a graded acetone series and embedded in Spurr's resin and polymerized. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate solution. We analyzed samples with a transmission electron microscope (H-7500, Hitachi) (31Hasan R. Ohnuki Y. Kawasaki M. Taniguchi M. Miyake H. Plant Prod. Sci. 2005; 8: 567-577Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Northern Blot Analysis—For Northern blot hybridization analysis, 5 μg of total RNA was loaded onto a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, and then transferred to a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized and washed at 65 °C (3Hattori M. Hasebe M. Sugita M. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 343: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Gene-specific DNA probes were amplified by PCR as described (32Nakamura T. Sugiura C. Kobayashi Y. Sugita M. Plant Biol. (Stuttg.). 2005; 7: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar): 3′-rps12 (741 bp), ndhB (1922 bp), ycf66 (939 bp), petB-petD (1856 bp), ycf3 (1830 bp), atpF (1170 bp), rpl14-rps16 (1706 bp), ndhA (1584 bp), ndhF (1337 bp), rpoC1 (958 bp), clpP (1629 bp), psbA (884 bp), rbcL (1204 bp), 5′-rps12 (438 bp), rpl20 (402 bp), rrn23 (1257 bp), and rrn16 (1035 bp). The DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Random primer DNA Labeling Kit (TaKaRa).Reverse Transcription-PCR—For the PPR531-11 transcripts, DNA-free total cellular RNA (4 μg) was denatured in the presence of oligo(dT)18 primer at 70 °C for 10 min and chilled on ice. Reverse transcription was carried out with ReverTra Ace (Toyobo) at 42 °C for 60 min, and first-strand cDNA was synthesized. PCR were performed using the first strand cDNA, Ex Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa), and primers P1 (as above) and P5 (5′-ATAGTCATTGCGTCTCTCATG-3′) for 30 cycles (3Hattori M. Hasebe M. Sugita M. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 343: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A 500-bp DNA fragment was amplified from the transcripts. As a control, an actin gene sequence was used for the RT-PCR using primers as described previously (33Ichikawa K. Sugita M. Imaizumi T. Wada M. Aoki S. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 4285-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For semiquantitative analysis of chloroplast transcripts, first strand cDNA was reverse-transcribed from the chloroplast RNA with random primers (Invitrogen). Each cDNA fragment was amplified using the following pair of primers: C1, 5′-ATGCCTATCGGTGTTCCAAAAGT-3′ and C2, 5′-CGTTTAATAGTTCAAGTTCGT-3′; C3, 5′-ATGTAGATGATGAAATTGCGA-3′ and C4, 5′-TTAATTATGAACTGTACGTAC-3′; C1 and C5, 5′-GCTTCTTGCGCTGACATAAAAAC-3′; C6, 5′-CAACCTGCTAGTTCTTATTAT-3′ and C7, 5′-ATTTTCTATTGGTTGTCTTCG-3′; RS1, 5′-TAAACCAATAAATTCTGCATATTATATA-3′ and RS2, 5′-ACGCCCTTGTTGACGATCTTT-3′; RS1 and RS3, 5′-TTATTTTGGCTTTTTCACTCCATATT-3′; RL1, 5′-GACTAGAGTTAAACGTGGGTATG-3′ and RL2, 5′-TGTAGAAAAACAATTAGTGTC-3′; D1, 5′-CGATTGGTTTGAAGAACGTCTTG-3′ and D2, 5′-AAGCTGCTCCAATACCTAACCAA-3′; and D3, 5′-TAACGCTTAAAAAAAATTTATGG-3′ and D2.Primer Extension Analysis—To determine the RNA processing site of clpP pre-mRNA, primer extension was carried out using isolated chloroplast RNA (10 μg) and 5′-32P-labeled primer, 5′-TGGATGTCCTCAACGAAGAGGAGTTTGTACTAGAG-3′ (nucleotide positions 13571-13537) (20Sugiura C. Kobayashi Y. Aoki S. Sugita C. Sugita M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5324-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was performed using ReverTra Ace (Toyobo). Sequence ladders were amplified with the same primers and a Thermo Sequenase Primer Cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). The products and sequence ladder were loaded onto a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel.Chloroplast Isolation—4-day-old protonemata (30 g of fresh weight) were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in 8% mannitol and 2% Driserase 20 (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo). The protoplasts were suspended in buffer (330 mm sorbitol, 30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin), and broken by passing the suspension through two layers of nylon mesh (20 μm pore size). The chloroplast pellet was collected by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min at 2 °C (28Kabeya Y. Sato N. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Immunoblot Analysis of Chloroplast Proteins—Chloroplast protein was extracted from the isolated chloroplasts using buffer (2% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol and 3 mm dithiothreitol). 9 μg of extract, and each protein dilution were loaded on SDS-12% or 15% (for detection of ClpP) PAGE and stained Quick-CBB Plus (Wako). For immunoblotting, the gel was transferred to Immobilon™ Transfer Membranes (Millipore). The incubation and immunodetection were performed using ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences) protocols. Antibodies were provided by M. Ikeuchi (α-spinach D1), T. Hisabori (α-TF1-B), F. Sato (α-spinach PsbO), and A. Watanabe (α-rice ClpP). α-Rice ClpP, α-spinach D1, and α-tobacco cp28 were used at a dilution of 1:5000, and α-TF1-B and α-spinach PsbO at a dilution of 1:10000.RESULTSStructure of the PPR531-11 Gene—In a previous study (3Hattori M. Hasebe M. Sugita M. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 343: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we showed that two PPR proteins, PPR513-10 and PPR566-6, are plastid-localized in P. patens. Expression of the PPR513-10 gene is regulated in a light-dependent manner, suggesting PPR513-10 plays an important role in plastid function. Hence, we selected the PPR513-10 protein to investigate its function in plastids. Before this analysis, we amplified the genomic region using primers designed from the PPR513-10 cDNA (3Hattori M. Hasebe M. Sugita M. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 343: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and determined that the genomic sequence consisted of seven exons and six introns. In this analysis, we noticed that the cDNA encoding PPR513-10 was derived from an alternatively spliced mRNA. We then isolated and sequenced the cDNA, which encodes a polypeptide of 531 amino acids with 11 PPR motifs (hereafter designated as PPR531-11, Fig. 1). There were two splicing donor sites at the border of exon 5 and intron 6 of the gene. If 312 bp or 258 bp of intron 6 were spliced out, mRNA encoding PPR513-10 or PPR531-11, respectively, would be produced (Fig. 2A). RT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA encoding PPR531-11 was predominant in the moss protonemal cells (data not shown).FIGURE 2Structure of the PPR531-11 gene and the targeting construct, and verification of the targeted disruption of PPR531-11. A, exons of PPR531-11 gene are represented by boxes. The untranslated regions of exons 1 and 7 are indicated by gray boxes. An alternative splicing of the intron 6 produces PPR513-10. The nptII gene cassette was inserted into the StuI site of exon 5. Gray lines indicate the DNA probe for Southern blot analysis. The fragment sizes after EcoRV and BstXI digestion of genomic DNA for Southern analyses are shown. Primers and the expected fragment sizes for PCR analysis are also shown. B, total cellular DNA from wild-type (WT) and disrupted (4-4 and 2-30) mosses and the targeting construct pMH1-3 (cons.) were digested with EcoRV and BstXI and hybridized with the DNA probe (above). C, PCR analysis using primers P3 and P4 showed that 1.1- and 3.0-kb fragments were derived from wild-type (WT) and transgenic lines (4-4 and 2-30), respectively. D, RT-PCR for detection of PPR531-11 transcripts using primers P1 and P5 and total cellular RNA from wild-type (WT) and the disruptants (4-4 and 2-30). RT-PCR for actin transcripts was used as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Knockout of the PPR531-11 Gene Results in Significantly Reduced Growth of Protonemata—To investigate the function of PPR531-11, we constructed and characterized PPR531-11 knock-out mosses (Fig. 2A). Among several G418-resistant mosses, we isolated two lines, 4-4 and 2-30, and performed Southern blot analysis to verify the targeted disruption (Fig. 2B). Probing with PPR531-11 gene detected the predicted 2.6-kb signal in the wild-type moss. By contrast, a 4.6-kb signal appeared in the G418-resistant moss lines, corresponding to the 2.0-kb nptII cassette integrated into the PPR531-11 locus (Fig. 2A). A uniform population of the transformed moss genome in the transgenic moss was further verified by PCR analysis (Fig. 2C). These results indicated the correct insertion of the nptII cassette into the targeted PPR531-11 gene locus. Furthermore, the absence of PPR531-11 transcript in the 4-4 and 2-30 transgenic lines was verified by RT-PCR (Fig. 2D). A band of 500 bp was detected in the wild-type moss but not in the transgenic PPR531-11 disruptants. By contrast, actin gene transcript was detected in the wild-type and PPR531-11 disruptant mosses. This result clearly indicates that PPR531-11 transcripts are absence from the disruptants, which are probably PPR531-11-deficient. Because the two disruptants displayed the same external phenotypes, the 4-4 transgenic moss was selected as the representative PPR531-11 disruptant and was further characterized.The PPR531-11 disruptant, transgenic line 4-4, did display abnormal protonemal colonies. Compared with the wild-type moss colony, the protonemal colonies were significantly smaller in the disrupted moss. This phenotype was not caused by G418, because G418 was not added to the growth medium for phenotypic characterization. Even though glucose (0.5%, 1%, or 3%) and/or ammonium tartrate (5 mm) was supplemented in the BCD medium, the size of the moss colony was not restored in the disruptant. A concentration of 0.15 m (2.8%) glucose is known to induce caulonemal filaments (34Olsson T. Thelander M. Ronne H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44439-44447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Such a small colony might result in poor induction of caulonemal filaments (Fig. 3, A and B). Generally, chloronemal cells contain more chlorophyll than caulonemal cells (35Reski R. Bot. Acta. 1998; 111: 1-15Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The chlorophyll content was 632.7 ± 28.2 (n = 3) μg/g fresh weight in the wild-type and 982.7 ± 10.3 in the disruptant colonies. This also supports the fact that the induction of caulonemal filaments is retarded in the disruptants. The gametophores were somewhat smaller than those of the wild-type moss (Fig. 3C). The number of gametophores formed in the colony was ∼50 in the disruptant, less than half of that of the wild-type (Fig. 3D). To investigate the functional status of the photosynthetic apparatus of the disruptant, 4-4, we measured quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (φPSII). The score of the disruptant was 30% lower than that of the wild-type. In addition, Fm/Fv and Fm′/Fv′ were reduced by 40 and 28%, respectively, but the photochemical quenching (qP) was not changed (Table 1). This indicated that the electron transfer from PSII to PSI was not interrupted, but the efficiency of PSII or accumulation of active PSII complexes was reduced in the disruptant.FIGURE 3Phenotype of the PPR531-11 disruptant. To compare the phenotype of the disruptant and the wild-type, the mosses were grown on a culture plate without Geneticin G418.

We then analyzed morphological changes in chloroplasts in the protonemata and gametophores by electron microscopy (Fig. 4).

https://openalex.org/W2089103016,"Direct recruitment of transcriptional corepressors to estrogen receptors (ER) is thought to contribute to the tissue-specific effects of clinically important ER antagonists. Here, we present the crystal structures of two affinity-selected peptides in complex with antagonist-bound ERalpha ligand-binding domain. Both peptides adopt helical conformations, bind along the activation function 2 coregulator interaction surface, and mimic corepressor (CoRNR) sequence motif binding. Peptide binding is weak in a wild-type context but significantly enhanced by removal of ER helix 12. This region contains a previously unrecognized CoRNR motif that is able to compete with corepressors for binding to activation function 2, thereby providing a structural explanation for the poor ability of ER to directly interact with classical corepressors. Furthermore, the ability of other sequence motifs to mimic corepressor binding raises the possibility that coregulators do not necessarily require CoRNR motifs for direct recruitment to antagonist-bound ER."

A sublethal dose of UVC (1 J/m2), which selectively inhibits replicon initiation by 50%, failed to reduce the amount of Cdc25A protein or decrease Cdk2-cyclin E kinase activity. Cdc25A degradation was observed after irradiation with cytotoxic fluences of UVC, suggesting that severe inhibition of DNA chain elongation and activation of the replication checkpoint might be responsible for the UVC-induced degradation of Cdc25A. Another proposed effector of the S checkpoint is the Cdc7-Dbf4 complex. Dbf4 interacted weakly with Chk1 in vivo but was recognized as a substrate for Chk1-dependent phosphorylation in vitro. FLAG-Dbf4 formed complexes with endogenous Cdc7, and this interaction was stable in UVC-irradiated HeLa cells. Overexpression of FLAG- or Myc-tagged Dbf4 abrogated the S checkpoint response to UVC but not ionizing radiation. These findings implicate a Dbf4-dependent kinase as a possible target of the ATR- and Chk1-dependent S checkpoint response to UVC. The S checkpoint response to ultraviolet radiation (UVC) that inhibits replicon initiation is dependent on the ATR and Chk1 kinases.

Human cells continuously experience damage to DNA from both reactive cellular metabolites and environmental sources. If damaged DNA is not repaired before DNA replication, mutations and chromosomal aberrations might ensue. To maintain high fidelity replication of the genome, human cells have evolved a number of biochemical pathways that respond to perturbations in DNA structure and facilitate error-free replication of damaged DNA (1Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). The S checkpoint maintains genomic stability by transiently inhibiting the initiation of new replicons and thereby limiting the number of active replication forks that encounter DNA lesions. This transient inhibition of replicon initiation should provide more time for DNA repair pathways to recognize and eliminate DNA damage prior to replication. Replicon initiation is a biochemically and genetically conserved process across eukaryotic phyla that requires the stepwise formation of pre-replication complexes at origins of DNA replication (2Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The six-subunit origin recognition complex binds to replication origins throughout the cell cycle and acts as a landing pad for Cdc6. Origin recognition complex and Cdc6 collaborate with the chaperone protein Cdt1 to load the six-subunit MCM 4The abbreviations used are: MCM, minichromosome maintenance; IR, ionizing radiation; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; DDK, Dbf4-dependent kinase; HU, hydroxyurea; NHF1, normal human fibroblast 1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LLnL, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal. complex into the developing pre-replication complexes. Mcm2–7 forms a hexameric structure, which is hypothesized to be the mammalian DNA helicase that unwinds duplex DNA to allow DNA polymerases to synthesize daughter strands. The origin recognition complex-Cdc6-Cdt-MCM pre-replication complex is regulated by two S phase kinase complexes, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and a Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK). S phase CDKs phosphorylate Cdc6, which results in its degradation (yeast) or nuclear export (mammals) (3Elsasser S. Chi Y. Yang P. Campbell J.L. Mol. Biol.

DDK-dependent phosphorylation is thought to activate the MCM helicase causing local unwinding of origin-specific DNA and the binding of the single-stranded DNA binding protein, RPA. CDK- and DDK-dependent phosphorylations are required for the loading of Cdc45 (13Aparicio O.M. Stout A.M. Bell S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cdc45 acts as a chaperone protein, which recruits the DNA polymerase α-DNA primase complex to origin DNA (14Mimura S. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5699-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). TopBP1 and Mcm10 are also required for Cdc45 loading following DDK-dependent activation of the MCM helicase (17Makiniemi M.

Loading of the DNA polymerase α-DNA primase complex on RPA-coated template strands initiates bi-directional, semi-conservative DNA replication. The S checkpoint pathway that responds to IR-induced DNA damage and inhibits replicon initiation in S phase cells has been intensively investigated (19Bartek J. Lukas C. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 792-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Upon recognition of IR-induced DNA strand breaks by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex, the sensor kinase ATM is activated by intramolecular autophosphorylation (20Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). Activated ATM inhibits the initiation of new replicons through a complex signaling pathway that involves a number of mediators of checkpoint signaling, including 53BP1, MDC1, and Brca1. Inhibition of the function of any of these mediator proteins results in a radio-resistant DNA synthesis phenotype in which cells are less able or unable to inhibit DNA synthesis after IR treatment (21Goldberg M.

It was previously demonstrated that ATM regulates two parallel pathways to inhibit replicon initiation following IR-induced DNA damage (25Falck J. Petrini J.H. Williams B.R. Lukas J. Bartek J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). One involves ATM-mediated phosphorylation of Chk2 on threonine 68. Chk2 in concert with Chk1 phosphorylates Cdc25A phosphatase on a number of serine residues, resulting in the accelerated ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of Cdc25A (26Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 27Sorensen C.S. Syljuasen R.G. Falck J. Schroeder T. Ronnstrand L. Khanna K.K. Zhou B.B. Bartek J. Lukas J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Degradation of Cdc25A, an activator of CDKs, inhibits Cdk2-cyclin E and binding of Cdc45 to origins of DNA replication (25Falck J. Petrini J.H. Williams B.R. Lukas J. Bartek J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The second ATM-dependent pathway that is activated in response to IR-induced strand breaks involves ATM-dependent phosphorylation of SMC1 (25Falck J. Petrini J.H. Williams B.R. Lukas J. Bartek J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), but it remains to be determined how this pathway regulates replication origin firing. We have shown previously that S checkpoint activation in human cells exposed to low, sublethal doses of UV is independent of ATM and the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex but dependent on the ATR and Chk1 kinases (28Heffernan T.P. Simpson D.A. Frank A.R. Heinloth A.N. Paules R.S. Cordeiro-Stone M. Kaufmann W.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8552-8561Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Claspin and Timeless, two mediators of ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling, also appear to be required for the response to UV-induced DNA damage (29Chini C.C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30057-30062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 30Unsal-Kacmaz K. Mullen T.E. Kaufmann W.K. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3109-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Little is known about the mechanism by which ATR- and Chk1-dependent signaling inhibits replicon initiation. As mentioned above, Cdc25A is the downstream target of the ATM-dependent, IR-induced S checkpoint. Cdc25A degradation was also observed in cells treated with the anti-metabolites hydroxyurea (HU) (31Molinari M. Mercurio C. Dominguez J. Goubin F. Draetta G.F. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and 5-fluorouracil (32Xiao Z. Xue J. Sowin T.J. Rosenberg S.H. Zhang H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1403-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the topoisomerase inhibitors etoposide and camptothecin (33Agner J. Falck J. Lukas J. Bartek J. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 302: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), as well as lethal fluences of UV (34Hassepass I. Voit R. Hoffmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29824-29829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 35Goloudina A. Yamaguchi H. Chervyakova D.B. Appella E. Fornace Jr., A.J. Bulavin D.V.

Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether Cdc25A is a required target for the UV-induced inhibition of replicon initiation. There is evidence that the Cdc7-Dbf4 complex may be a target of the S checkpoint response to genotoxic stress (37Jares P. Donaldson A. Blow J.J. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In HU-treated Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cdc7/Him1/Dfp1 (spDbf4) undergoes Cds1-dependent phosphorylation (38Takeda T. Ogino K. Tatebayashi K. Ikeda H. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1257-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 39Brown G.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8443-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In HU-treated Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rad53 physically interacts with scCdc7 and phosphorylates scDbf4. Rad53-dependent phosphorylation of scDbf4 has been shown to result in the removal of the kinase complex from chromatin and inhibition of kinase activity (40Duncker B.P. Shimada K. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Pasero P. Gasser S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16087-16092Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 41Weinreich M. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5334-5346Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence for the involvement of vertebrate DDK as a target of the S checkpoint has been reported (42Costanzo V. Shechter D. Lupardus P.J. Cimprich K.A. Gottesman M. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In Xenopus egg extracts, treatment with etoposide or exonuclease III activated an ATR-dependent checkpoint that inhibited the initiation of DNA replication; this response was accompanied by the inhibition of Dbf4 binding to chromatin and its interaction with Cdc7, ultimately resulting in the down-regulation of Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase activity and the inhibition of Cdc45 binding to origins (42Costanzo V. Shechter D. Lupardus P.J. Cimprich K.A. Gottesman M. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Further, the ATR-dependent S checkpoint response to single-stranded DNA regions (daughter-strand gaps) did not inhibit Cdk2-cyclin E kinase activity. However, inhibition of Cdk2-cyclin E was observed in Xenopus egg extracts in the presence of double-stranded DNA breaks. This S checkpoint response was shown to be ATM-dependent and inhibited the initiation of DNA synthesis through inactivation of Cdk2-cyclin E (43Costanzo V. Robertson K. Ying C.Y. Kim E. Avvedimento E. Gottesman M. Grieco D. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, at least two DNA damage checkpoint mechanisms regulate origin firing in Xenopus. The goal of the present study was to characterize further the downstream signaling targets of the ATR- and Chk1-dependent S checkpoint response to UV-induced DNA damage. Our data indicate that, in contrast to the IR-induced S checkpoint, the UVC-induced response is independent of Chk1-mediated proteolysis of Cdc25A and does not involve inhibition of Cdk2-cyclin E. This is consistent with different signaling intermediates being phosphorylated and activated when normal human fibroblasts are treated with UVC or IR. Furthermore, data presented herein suggest that Chk1, when activated by UVC irradiation, may regulate the Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase complex. Taken together, the data reveal several mechanisms for inhibition of replicon initiation following DNA damage in human cells. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—hTERT-immortalized normal human fibroblasts (NHF1), HeLa, and HEK-293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were routinely established to be free of contamination with mycoplasma using a commercial kit (Gen-Probe Inc.). Cell Treatments—Prior to treatment with UVC, culture medium was removed and reserved. Cultures were washed once with warm PBS, and then placed uncovered under a UV lamp emitting primarily 254 nm radiation at a fluence rate of 0.7 J/m2/s. Following irradiation, the reserved medium was replaced, and the cultures were incubated for the indicated periods of time. Sham-treated cultures were handled exactly the same way, except that they were not exposed to UVC. Cells treated with ionizing radiation (IR) were maintained in culture medium and exposed to 137Cs γ-rays at a dose rate of 0.84 Gy/min. Cells were treated with HU by adding the appropriate amount of a 1 m stock solution in PBS to the culture medium for a final concentration of 2 mm. Where indicated, cells were treated with 25 μg/ml N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (LLnL, Sigma) 30 min prior to UVC or IR exposure and for the duration of the experiment. Western Immunoblot Analyses—Logarithmically growing cells were seeded at 106 per 100-mm dish and incubated for 40 h. Cultures were treated with UVC or IR as described above and incubated in reserved medium for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed once in PBS, and resuspended in MCLB (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4) supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After clarifying the extract by centrifugation, protein concentration was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Samples containing equal amounts of protein were mixed with equal volumes of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with antibodies against Chk1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, G4), Chk2 (Oncogene), phospho-serine 317 Chk1, phospho-serine 345 Chk1, and phospho-threonine 68 Chk2 (Cell Signaling), FLAG epitope (Anti-FLAG M2, Sigma), Cdc7 (Abcam), Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, E10), Cdc25A (Labvision), Nbs1, phospho-serine 343 Nbs1, Smc1, phosphorserine 655 Smc1, Rad17, and phospho-serine 645 Rad17 (Bethyl Laboratories). Cdk2-Cyclin E Kinase Assay—Cdk2-cyclin E kinase assays were performed as previously described (44Shackelford R.E. Innes C.L. Sieber S.O. Heinloth A.N. Leadon S.A. Paules R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21951-21959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, cyclin E was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of whole cell extract with anti-human cyclin E Power clonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Kinase reactions were carried out in histone H1 kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm EGTA, 50 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μm cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-inhibitory peptide), with 8 μg of histone H1 and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 37 °C. The kinase reactions were stopped by addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to verify equal histone protein loading, dried, and subjected to autoradiography with Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). The radiolabeled protein substrates in the dried gels were then quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuaNT software. RNA Interference—Small interference RNA duplexes were synthesized by Dharmacon against the following target sequences: ATR, AACCTCCGTGATGTTGCTTGA; and Chk1, AAGCGTGCCGTAGACTGTCCA. Transfections of 200 nm small interference RNA oligonucleotide duplexes were performed with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-Dbf4—HeLa cells were transfected with 10 μg of pME18S-2XFLAG-Dbf4 plasmid (per 100-mm plate containing ∼1 × 106 cells) using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in MCLB. Pre-cleared lysates (1 mg of protein) were incubated with 40 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. Proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and probed with the indicated antibodies. Affinity Purification of FLAG-Dbf4 and FLAG-Chk1—HEK-293T cells were transfected with 25 μg of pME18S-2XFLAG-Dbf4, pcDNA3-FLAG-Chk1WT, or pcDNA3-FLAG-Chk1KD plasmids by using a calcium phosphate transfection method (45Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 1.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Tween 20, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatants were incubated with 40 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. For FLAG-Dbf4-transfected cells, the agarose beads were washed three times with 1.5 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 m NaCl; the proteins were eluted in 100 μl of elution buffer that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 μg/ml 3× FLAG-peptide (Sigma). For FLAG-Chk1-transfected cells, bead washing was performed only under low salt conditions (150 mm NaCl). For in vivo interaction studies, pME18S-Myc-Dbf4, pcDNA3-FLAG-Chk1, or pcDNA3-ATR plasmids were transfected alone or in combination by using a calcium phosphate transfection method. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed, and FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated as described. FLAG beads were washed with low salt buffer, and proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE. Radio-resistant DNA Synthesis Assay—Logarithmically growing cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish and grown at 37 °C for 30–40 h in medium containing 10 nCi/ml [14C]thymidine (ICN Radiochemicals) to uniformly label DNA. Radioactive medium was replaced with fresh medium to chase 14C-labeled precursors into DNA for at least 3 h. To determine the ability of cells to repress DNA synthesis in the presence of DNA damage, cells were either sham-treated or exposed to UVC. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then 15 min with 20 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine. Radioactive medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice in cold PBS. Cells were harvested by scraping from the plate with a rubber policeman into 0.5 ml of 0.1 m NaCl containing 0.01 m EDTA (pH 8.0) and passed 5× through a 25-gauge needle. Aliquots (200 μl) of the cell suspension were added to separate tubes containing 200 μl of lysis buffer (1 m NaOH, 0.02 m EDTA), and acid-insoluble material was collected on GF/C microfiber glass filters (46Kaufmann W.K. Cleaver J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Net 3H radioactivity corrected for 14C spillover was normalized for cell number (total 14C radioactivity). Velocity Sedimentation Analysis—The methodology used to determine the steady-state distribution of sizes of nascent DNA 30–45 min after irradiation of log phase cultures with either 1 J/m2 UVC or 5 Gy of IR was described previously (47Cistulli C.A. Kaufmann W.K. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1993-2002PubMed Google Scholar, 48Cordeiro-Stone M. Frank A. Bryant M. Oguejiofor I. Hatch S.B. McDaniel L.D. Kaufmann W.K. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). UVC and IR Activate Different Signaling Intermediates in Human Cells—Human S phase cells inhibit replicon initiation by 50% when exposed to low doses of UVC and IR. However, it was previously shown that the upstream sensor and transducer kinases involved in the responses to these radiations were different (28Heffernan T.P. Simpson D.A. Frank A.R. Heinloth A.N. Paules R.S. Cordeiro-Stone M. Kaufmann W.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8552-8561Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). ATR and Chk1 regulate the S checkpoint response to UVC, whereas ATM is required for the response to IR. Because the ATR- and ATM-dependent S checkpoints inhibit replicon initiation to the same extent, it was hypothesized that two independent signaling pathways converged downstream, ultimately regulating the same origin-proximal targets. To test this hypothesis, signaling intermediates were compared after the two checkpoint pathways were activated. First, the doses of UVC and IR that induced an equivalent inhibition of replicon initiation were determined. Velocity sedimentation analysis reveals the steady-state distribution of pulse-labeled nascent DNA molecules in S phase cells. This technique was used to quantify DNA damage-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis in replicons that were scheduled to initiate after irradiation. Treatment of NHF1 cells with either 1 J/m2 UVC or 5 Gy of IR induced an equivalent biological response, mainly the same selective inhibition of incorporation of radiolabeled precursor into low molecular weight nascent DNA intermediates (Fig. 1A). To determine if downstream signaling targets were shared between the two S checkpoint pathways, NHF1 fibroblasts were harvested 45 min post-irradiation, when inhibition of replicon initiation was demonstrated. Consistent with previous reports, treatment with IR induced the phosphorylation of Chk1, Chk2, Nbs1, Smc1, and Rad17, (49Bao S. Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Fang Y. Richardson D.A. Ali A. Chen S.M.

In contrast, UVC failed to induce phosphorylation of Chk2, Nbs1, or Smc1, and induced Rad17 phosphorylation only modestly over the level seen in the sham-treated control. These data are consistent with previously published observations that the activation of the S checkpoint by UVC required the phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATR and was independent of ATM, Nbs1, and Mre11 (28Heffernan T.P.

Cdc25A Degradation Was Not Associated with Activation of the S Checkpoint by UVC—The ATM-dependent, IR-induced S checkpoint inhibits replicon initiation by regulating the stability of Cdc25A. Checkpoint-induced degradation of this phosphatase results in persistent inhibition of Cdk2-Cyclin E and replicon initiation. Because checkpoint-dependent regulation of Cdc25A stability was also observed in cells treated with lethal doses of UVC (34Hassepass I. Voit R. Hoffmann I. J. Biol.

To test this hypothesis, NHF1 and HeLa cells were treated with doses of UVC and IR that induced equivalent inhibitions of replicon initiation (Fig. 1A). Cdc25A degradation and Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylation were observed after treating cells with IR (Fig. 2A). However, under conditions in which low dose UVC activated ATR-dependent Chk1 phosphorylation, Cdc25A degradation was not observed (Fig. 2A). It has been shown previously that DNA damage-induced degradation of Cdc25A is mediated by the proteasome (26Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J.

https://openalex.org/W2022991364,"Abstract The exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the cell surface is a general marker of apoptotic cells. Non-apoptotic PS externalization is induced by several activation stimuli, including engagement of immunoreceptors. Immune cells can also be activated by aggregation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). However, it is unknown whether cell triggering through these proteins, lacking transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, also leads to PS externalization. Here we show that engagement of GPI-APs in rodent mast cells induces a rapid and reversible externalization of PS by a non-apoptotic mechanism. PS externalization triggered by GPI-AP-specific monoclonal antibodies was dependent on the activity of H+-ATP synthase and several other enzymes involved in mast cell signaling but was independent of cell degranulation, free cytoplasmic calcium up-regulation, and a decrease in lipid packing as determined by merocyanine 540 binding. Surprisingly, disruption of actin cytoskeleton by latrunculin B or plasma membrane integrity by methyl-β-cyclodextrin had opposite effects on PS externalization triggered through GPI-AP or the high affinity IgE receptor. We further show that PS externalization mediated by GPI-APs was also observed in some other cells, and its extent varied with antibodies used. Interestingly, effects of different antibodies on PS externalization were additive, indicating that independent stimuli converge onto a signaling pathways leading to PS externalization. Our findings identify the cell surface PS exposure induced through GPI-AP as a distinct mechanism of cell signaling. Such a mechanism could contribute to “inside-out” signaling in response to pathogens and other external activators and/or to initiation of other functions associated with PS externalization."
https://openalex.org/W1969173606,"Despite its central role in cell survival and proliferation, the transcriptional program controlled by GSK-3 is poorly understood. We have employed a systems level approach to characterize gene regulation downstream of PI 3-kinase/Akt/GSK-3 signaling in response to growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells. Of 31 immediate-early genes whose induction was dependent on PI 3-kinase signaling, 12 were induced directly by inhibition of GSK-3. Most of the GSK-3-regulated genes encoded transcription factors, growth factors, and signaling molecules. Binding sites for CREB were highly over-represented in the upstream regions of these genes, with 9 genes containing CREB sites that were conserved in mouse orthologs. Binding sites predicted in 6 genes were confirmed by CREB chromatin immunoprecipitation and forskolin induction of CBP binding. Moreover, CREB siRNA substantially blocked induction of 5 genes by forskolin and of 3 genes following inhibition of GSK-3. These results indicate that GSK-3 actively represses gene expression in quiescent cells, with inhibition of CREB playing a key role in this transcriptional response.

First described as the kinase capable of phosphorylating and inactivating glycogen synthase, GSK-3 is now recognized as a key regulator of many normal processes such as cellular development, proliferation, and survival. Dysregulation of GSK-3 activity has been linked to various human diseases including Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, schizophrenia, and mood disorders. GSK-3 can be regulated either by Wnt signaling or by the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/Akt pathways. Wnt signaling leads to an inhibition of the phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3 and a corresponding increase in transcriptional activation of β-catenin/Tcf target genes (1Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4239) Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase in response to stimulation of cells by insulin or growth factor causes a decrease in GSK-3 activity because of an inhibitory phosphorylation by Akt of GSK-3β on serine 9 or GSK-32 on serine 21 (2Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). The resulting inhibition of GSK-3 plays a critical role in signaling cell growth and survival downstream of PI 3-kinase. In the absence of growth factor stimulation, GSK-3 is active and can inhibit cell proliferation as well as induce apoptosis (3Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J.

We have combined global gene expression profiling with computational analysis to characterize gene regulation downstream of PI 3-kinase/Akt/GSK-3 signaling. We previously identified immediate early genes that were induced by the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway in response to growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells (11Tullai J.W. Schaffer M.E. Mullenbrock S. Kasif S. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20167-20177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have characterized a subset of these genes that are regulated by GSK-3, and by combining computational predictions with experimental analyses have identified CREB (cyclic AMP response element-binding protein) as a key transcription factor responsible for gene regulation by GSK-3. Cell Culture and Treatments—T98G human glioblastoma cells were grown in Minimal Essential Medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. For inhibitor and growth factor treatments, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 72 h, and left untreated or treated with 50 ng/ml human PDGF-BB (Sigma) for 30 min, 10 μm forskolin (Sigma), or Me2SO vehicle for 1 h, or 5 μm SB-216763 (BioMol) or Me2SO vehicle for 1 h, as indicated in the text. GSK-3 Kinase Assays—GSK-3 kinase activity was assayed using a crude cell lysate method (12Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30945-30953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, T98G cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using a Dounce homogenizer in 8 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm benzamidine. Samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 12.5-μl aliquots of the supernatant (containing ∼150 ng of total protein) were then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in 50 μl of reaction buffer (5 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm magnesium chloride, 250 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1.6 Ci/mol), and 62.5 μm of either a GSK-3 peptide substrate (YRRAAVPPSPSLSRHSSPHQ(pS)EDEEE) or a control pseudosubstrate peptide (YRRAAVPPSPSLSRHSSPHQAEDEEE) (Upstate Biotechnology). Reactions were stopped by spotting the sample onto P81 phosphocellulose paper for 30 s, followed by washing each filter for 5 min in 40 ml of 0.75% phosphoric acid (three times), and once with acetone. Filters were allowed to dry and incorporated 32P measured by scintillation counting. Incorporation into control pseudosubstrate samples was subtracted as background. Immunoblots—Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with the indicated antibodies as recommended by the manufacturer. Blots were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody, and chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer). All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies, except for anti-β-actin, which was from Sigma. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA preparations were used in quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Reverse transcription of 0.25 μg of total RNA was performed in 20 μl using SYBR green RT-PCR reagents and random hexamer primers (Applied Biosystems) as recommended by the manufacturer. Following a 95 °C incubation for 10 min, forty cycles of PCR (95 °C/15 s; 60 °C/1 m), were then performed on an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System with 1 μl of the RT reaction, 100 nm PCR primers (see supplemental Table S1 for primer sequences), and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix in 5-μl reactions. Threshold cycles (CT) for three replicate reactions were determined using Sequence Detection System software (version 2.2.2) and relative transcript abundance calculated following normalization with a GAPDH PCR amplicon. Amplification of only a single species was verified by a dissociation curve for each reaction. Identification of Transcription Factor Binding Sites and Statistical Analysis of the Site Frequencies—To identify candidate regulators of the SB-216763-induced genes, the web-based tool, TRACTOR, 4M.

Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20167-20177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The computational procedure implemented in TRACTOR aims to detect a set of overrepresented transcription factor binding sites in upstream regions of co-expressed genes compared with a background set of upstream sequences. Briefly, human 5-kb upstream sequences were obtained from the University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser Data Base (version hg17, May 2004) (13Karolchik D. Baertsch R. Diekhans M. Furey T.S. Hinrichs A. Lu Y.T. Roskin K.M. Schwartz M. Sugnet C.W. Thomas D.J. Weber R.J. Haussler D. Kent W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar) and were scanned with the Match algorithm (14Kel A.E. Gossling E. Reuter I. Cheremushkin E. Kel-Margoulis O.V. Wingender E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3576-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar) using 546 vertebrate position weight matrices from TRANSFAC Professional (version 8.4) (15Wingender E. Chen X. Fricke E. Geffers R. Hehl R. Liebich I. Krull M. Matys V. Michael H. Ohnhauser R. Pruss M. Schacherer F. Thiele S. Urbach S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Sites scoring greater than predefined Match thresholds that minimize the sum of false negative and false positive error rates (min-SUM) were considered matches. For each matrix, the distribution of sites per gene in the SB-216763-induced gene set was compared with the distribution detected in a previously described background set of genes that were expressed in T98G cells, but not induced by PDGF (11Tullai J.W. Schaffer M.E. Mullenbrock S. Kasif S. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20167-20177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The significance of site frequencies relative to background was assessed with a one-sided permutation test using the exactRankTests package in R (16Ihaka R. Gentleman R. J. Computat. Graph. Stat. 1996; 5: 299-314Google Scholar), and p values were adjusted with a false discovery rate (FDR) correction (17Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. J. Royal Stat. Soc. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). Only 165 matrices for the human-only set and 162 matrices for the human-mouse conserved set (those meeting the criteria of less than 5 hits per 5 kb of upstream sequence in the background set and at least one hit in 50% of the test genes) were considered in the correction calculations. Identification of Conserved Binding Site Enrichment—5-kb upstream human sequences (version hg17, May 2004) and orthologous mouse genomic sequences (version mm5, May 2004) were extracted from 8-way 5-kb upstream MULTIZ alignments obtained from the University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser Data Base. The human and mouse sequences were independently scanned with Match as described above and predicted sites in human and mouse at the same alignment position were considered matches. Statistical analysis and p value corrections were performed as described above. TATA Box Identification—To identify transcripts with an upstream TATA box, sequences –55 to –5 relative to the transcription start site were scanned with the Match algorithm (14Kel A.E. Gossling E. Reuter I. Cheremushkin E. Kel-Margoulis O.V. Wingender E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3576-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar) using a TBP binding site matrix (supplemental Fig. S2A). Subsequences with at least one site scoring greater than a threshold were considered TATA sites and those with at least one site in the corresponding aligned mouse sequence were considered conserved. Using a set of sequences bound by human TATA-binding protein (hTBP) in vitro (18Hardenbol P. Wang J.C. Van Dyke M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3339-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the threshold was based on the collection of highest scoring positions within each sequence. These 68 sequences, derived from a restriction endonuclease protection selection and amplification (REPSA) assay, were grouped into four categories based on their consensus sequence as TATAAA, TAAATA, TATATA, or Other. A threshold of ≥0.7 was selected to identify at least 95% of the RESPA sequences in the TATAAA, TATATA, and TAAATA groups (supplemental Fig. S2B). This threshold identified TATA sites upstream of 20.68% of 16,743 unique human Ref-Seq transcripts (hg17) (supplemental Fig. S2C). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed as described (11Tullai J.W. Schaffer M.E. Mullenbrock S. Kasif S. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20167-20177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), except that cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and aprotinin) for 10 min after formaldehyde fixation. Crude nuclei were collected by microcentrifugation at 4000 × g for 3 min, washed once with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in high salt lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and aprotinin). After sonication to obtain an average of 500-bp chromatin fragments, samples were precleared with sonicated salmon sperm DNA/protein A agarose (50% slurry), and immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C using 6.25 μg/ml anti CREB-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-186), 3.3 μg/ml anti CBP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-369) or equivalent concentrations of normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-2027) as negative control. For CREB ChIP, beads were washed three times in low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.1), once in LiCl wash (0.25 m LiCl, 1% IGEPAL-Ca 630, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and twice with 1× TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). For CBP ChIP, beads were washed successively in low salt wash, high salt wash (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.1), LiCl wash, and twice in 1× TE. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was quantified with real-time PCR (see Fig. 4 for mapped amplicons and supplemental Table S1 for primer sequences). GAPDH was used as a negative control for CREB ChIPs (19Conkright M.D. Guzman E. Flechner L. Su A.I. Hogenesch J.B. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1101-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). RNA Interference—RNA interference transfections were conducted using HiPerfect reagent (Qiagen) and pre-designed siRNAs (final concentration 10 nm, Ambion). Transfection mixtures were prepared in 400 μl of total volume by adding 24 μl HiPerfect and either CREB1 siRNA (Ambion siRNA ID 109994, 5′-GGUGGAAAAUGGACUGGCUtt-3′) or nonspecific siRNA (Ambion negative control siRNA 1, catalog 4611) to serum-free medium, mixed, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The transfection mixtures were then overlaid with 4.6 ml of 105 cells/ml in serum-containing medium and transferred to 60-mm plates. Cells were incubated at 37C, 5% CO2 for 48 h and then serum-starved for 25 h prior to treatment with forskolin or SB-2167623 for 1 h. Cells were then harvested, total RNA-extracted, and analyzed by real time RT-PCR. Identification of Genes Induced by GSK-3 Inhibition—Microarray analysis was previously used to identify immediateearly genes that were induced by stimulation of quiescent T98G human glioblastoma cells with PDGF (11Tullai J.W. Schaffer M.E. Mullenbrock S. Kasif S. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20167-20177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (LY294002) and MEK (U0126) were then used to identify genes whose induction in response to growth factor stimulation was dependent on either PI 3-kinase or MEK/ERK signaling. This analysis revealed four categories of genes: genes that were induced independent of PI 3-kinase and MEK/ERK, genes that were dependent on PI 3-kinase, genes that were dependent on MEK/ERK, and genes that were dependent on both PI 3-kinase and MEK/ERK signaling (Fig. 1) (11Tullai J.W. Schaffer M.E. Mullenbrock S. Kasif S. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20167-20177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We have investigated 31 of these genes (10 that were dependent only on PI 3-kinase and 21 that were dependent on both PI 3-kinase and MEK/ERK signaling) to determine whether they could be induced in serum-starved, quiescent T98G cells by treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of GSK-3 (SB-216763) in the absence of growth factor stimulation. The genes selected for these experiments were those for which sequences upstream of the transcription start site could be obtained from GenBank™, so that computational analysis of transcription factor binding sites could be conducted. The effect of the GSK-3 inhibitor SB-216763, which inhibits both the α- and β-isoforms (20Coghlan M.P. Culbert A.A. Cross D.A. Corcoran S.L. Yates J.W. Pearce N.J. Rausch O.L. Murphy G.J. Carter P.S. Roxbee Cox L. Mills D. Brown M.J. Haigh D. Ward R.W. Smith D.G. Murray K.J. Reith A.D. Holder J.C. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), was first tested by assaying lysates of T98G cells for GSK-3 activity (Fig. 2). Quiescent T98G cells were treated with SB-216763, vehicle (Me2SO) or PDGF, and GSK-3 activity determined by in vitro kinase assays (12Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30945-30953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). As expected, quiescent T98G cells exhibited the highest GSK-3 activity. When cells were treated for 1 h with SB-216763, activity decreased to 39% (±10%, n = 3) of the activity of quiescent cells treated with vehicle alone. Similarly, quiescent cells treated with PDGF demonstrated an activity decrease to 53% (±8%, n = 3) the activity of quiescent, untreated cells. These results are consistent with previous studies on the effects of both growth factor stimulation and SB-216763 treatment (2Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar, 6Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol.

In contrast, treatment of quiescent cells with SB-216763 did not significantly affect either Akt or ERK activity (Fig. 2B). Gene induction by GSK-3 inhibition (with SB-216763) was compared with induction by PDGF by quantitative real time RT-PCR (Fig. 3). Quiescent cells were treated with SB-216763 for 60 min in the absence of growth factor stimulation, as compared with cells stimulated with PDGF for 30 min. Overall, 12 of the 31 PI 3-kinase-regulated genes tested were induced greater than 2-fold upon direct GSK-3 inhibition in the absence of any growth factor stimulation, ranging from 2-fold (21) to nearly 16-fold (24). Regarding the distribution across the two groups of genes, 4 of 10 genes in the PI 3-kinase-only-dependent group were induced more than 2-fold by SB-216763 and 8 of 21 genes in the PI 3-kinase and MEK/ERK-dependent group were induced more than 2-fold by SB-216763. Typical of immediateearly genes, 11 of the GSK-3-regulated genes encoded transcription factors (FOSB, NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3, BHLHB2), growth factors (CYR61, CCL8, CTGF), and signaling molecules (RGS1, RGS2, ARHE). For some genes, such as CYR61, RGS2, CCL8, BHLHB2, PLAU, and ARHE, the induction by SB-216763 alone was comparable to their induction by PDGF. This result suggested that GSK-3 was a major contributor to the regulation of these genes. Identification of Transcription Factor Binding Sites in SB-216763-induced Genes—Co-regulated genes often share common transcription factor binding sites. Therefore, the twelve genes up-regulated greater than 2-fold from Fig. 3 were examined for common cis-elements to identify transcription factors that might be targeted by GSK-3 signaling. Predicted cis-elements are generally more likely to be physiologically relevant if they are evolutionarily conserved in multiple organisms and can be demonstrated to occur in an aligned upstream sequence from an orthologous gene (22Sauer T. Shelest E. Wingender E. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Wasserman W.W. Sandelin A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Therefore, each 5-kb upstream human sequence, as well as the corresponding orthologous mouse sequence, was analyzed with the Match program using 546 vertebrate matrices from TRANSFAC Professional (v8.4). All sites with a score above the recommended threshold to minimize the sum of false negative and false positive (minSUM) hits were recorded, and the frequency of predicted transcription factor binding sites was examined across the group of twelve SB-216763-induced genes and compared with a background set of genes that were expressed in T98G cells but were not induced by PDGF (11Tullai J.W. Schaffer M.E. Mullenbrock S. Kasif S. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20167-20177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The most significantly scoring matrices are shown in Table 1 (see supplemental Table S2 for complete analysis). When considering only the human sequences (Table 1A), three matrices were significantly overrepresented in the twelve genes at p < 0.05: V$CREB_Q3, V$CREB_Q2_01, and V$CREBATF_Q6, all representing CREB binding sites. The same three CREB matrices scored in the top four most highly significant sites that were conserved between human and mouse, in addition to a matrix representing binding sites for CEBPα (Table 1B).TABLE 1Summary of transcription factor matrices with over-represented binding sites in the upstream sequences of SB-216763 up-regulated genesA.

Schaffer M.E. Mullenbrock S. Kasif S. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20167-20177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to compare the frequency of predicted CREB binding sites in the GSK-3-regulated genes to the 19 PI 3-kinase-regulated genes that were not induced by GSK-3 inhibition (see Fig. 3). For these 19 genes, neither matrices for CREB nor any other transcription factor were over-represented in the human sequences alone. When considering sites that were conserved between human and mouse, the V$CREB_Q3 matrix was among the top ten sites predicted in these 19 genes, but with a p value that was only marginally significant (5.57 × 10–3), compared with p = 1.47 × 10–6 in the GSK-3-regulated genes (Table 1B). Over-representation of CREB binding sites is thus specific for the subset of GSK-3-regulated genes. The over-representation of CREB binding sites in GSK-3-regulated genes is consistent with CREB being a known target of GSK-3 (5Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). Therefore, we further explored the possible involvement of CREB in the induction of these genes. The alignments of the 5-kb upstream regions, and the distribution of predicted CREB binding sites are compiled in Fig. 4 (see supplemental Fig. S1 for other predicted binding sites). Consistent with its role as a putative regulator for this cluster, CREB binding sites were predicted in 11 of 12 genes. Despite low overall percent identities, conserved CREB sites between mouse and human are predicted in 9 of 12 genes within the 5-kb window. To further corroborate the prediction of CREB as a major regulator of this group of genes, we separately searched for TATA motifs, as others have shown a proximal TATA box is often present in the promoter region of CREB-activated genes (19Conkright M.D. Guzman E. Flechner L. Su A.I. Hogenesch J.B. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1101-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 6 of 9 SB-216763-induced genes with conserved CREB sites (67%) also contained a proximal TATA box (Fig. 4), compared with an occurrence of only 20.68% for 16,743 genes encoding unique human RefSeq transcripts (supplemental Fig. S2). Forskolin Induction of GSK-3 Target Genes—Genes that have functional CREB binding sites in their upstream regions are likely to be induced by stimulation of protein kinase A with cyclic AMP. To test this, quiescent T98G cells were subjected to forskolin treatment to stimulate cyclic AMP-mediated pathways, and the transcripts of the 12 GSK-3-regulated genes were measured by quantitative real time RT-PCR (Fig. 5). Forskolin up-regulated 9 of 12 genes greater than 2-fold, consistent with CREB-mediated regulation of these genes. The values ranged from just over 2-fold for BHLHB2 (21), to more than 380-fold (28.6) for NR4A2. In most (7 of 9) cases, forskolin induction was consistent with the presence of CREB sites that were conserved in mouse. BHLHB2, FOSB, NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3, RGS1, and RGS2 all exhibited greater than 2-fold inductions by forskolin, and like-wise contained evolutionarily conserved binding sites within the 5-kb window (Fig. 4). Binding of CREB and CBP to GSK-3 Target Genes—To gain a better understanding of the CREB regulation of the SB-216763 up-regulated genes, CREB binding to upstream regions containing the predicted sites in 10 GSK-3 target genes was tested by ChIP (Fig. 6A). These 10 genes included the 9 genes with predicted CREB binding sites that were conserved in the mouse, as well as CTGF, which was also forskolin-inducible. Serum-starved T98G cells were treated with SB-216763 or vehicle (Me2SO), followed by immunoprecipitation of chromatin using an anti-CREB1 antibody. Quantitative real time PCR was then used to detect specific upstream regions (amplicons for all ChIPs are mapped in Fig. 4). As expected, because CREB has been shown to occupy its binding sites constitutively (19Conkright M.D. Guzman E. Flechner L. Su A.I. Hogenesch J.B. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1101-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), the vehicle-treated and SB-216763-treated samples showed similar levels of precipitation by the anti-CREB antibody (Fig. 6A). Comparable results were also obtained with untreated control cells (data not shown). The upstream regions of 6 genes (FOSB, NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3, RGS2, and CYR61[II]) were specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-CREB antibody (0.1–0.6% of input) compared with control IgG, whereas a negative control promoter (GAPDH) was not immunoprecipitated (<0.02% of input). This is consistent with the finding that FOSB, NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3, and RGS2 were induced by forskolin (Fig"

In this study, we address the role of these receptors in cartilage homeostasis during inflammatory joint disease. We document for the first time expression of the NR4A receptors in osteoarthritic cartilage. Relative to Nur77 and NOR-1, NURR1 is expressed at the highest level and correlates with cyclooxygenase-2 levels in cartilage. Consistent with this observation, cyclooxygenase-2-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) rapidly and potently induces NURR1 expression in chondrocytes, suggesting that this receptor may regulate PGE2-mediated processes in cartilage. We demonstrate that PGE2 represses interleukin-1β-induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and that transient overexpression of NURR1 is sufficient to antagonize expression of this gene. Furthermore, MMP-1 promoter activity is potently suppressed by NURR1, resulting in a significant reduction in endogenous MMP-1 mRNA and secreted pro-MMP-1 protein. In addition, NURR1 selectively antagonizes cytokine-induced MMP-3 and -9 expression with minimal effects on MMP-2 and -13 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-1 and -2. To explore the molecular mechanisms of NURR1 transrepression, we reveal that this receptor targets a critical region of the MMP-1 promoter (–1772 to –1546 bp) and that repression does not require consensus binding sites for NURR1. We confirm that NURR1 targets a 40-bp promoter sequence that is also positively regulated by ETS transcription factors. Finally, functional studies indicate that transcriptional antagonism exists between NURR1 and ETS1 on the MMP-1 promoter. We propose a protective function for NURR1 in cartilage homeostasis by selectively repressing MMP gene expression during inflammation.

Nuclear hormone receptors comprise a large family of tightly regulated transcription factors that play critical roles in normal physiology and disease processes (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M.

Several of these receptors are activated by ligands such as vitamins and hormones, which cause allosteric changes in the receptors and alter the transcription of target genes. Modulation of these receptors with synthetic ligands has shown great promise in the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases (2Gronemeyer H. Gustafsson J.A. Laudet V. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 950-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). In contrast, orphan nuclear receptors control gene expression in the absence of ligands, and elucidating the functions and transcriptional targets of these receptors may also lead to therapeutic advances. The NR4A receptors are a subfamily of orphan nuclear receptors consisting of nerve growth factor-induced clone B (Nur77, NR4A1), NURR1 (nuclear receptor related-1; NR4A2), and NOR-1 (neuron-derived orphan receptor-1; NR4A3) (3Maxwell M.A. Muscat G.E. Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2006; 4: e002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As ligand-independent receptors (4Wang Z. Benoit G. Liu J. Prasad S. Aarnisalo P. Liu X. Xu H. Walker N.P. Perlmann T. Nature. 2003; 423: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), the activity of these transcription factors is tightly controlled at the level of expression. Nur77, NURR1, and NOR-1 exhibit distinct and overlapping expression patterns in a number of cell and tissue types (3Maxwell M.A. Muscat G.E. Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2006; 4: e002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that these receptors have unique and partially redundant functions. A number of NR4A target genes have been elucidated in the central nervous system (5Sakurada K. Ohshima-Sakurada M. Palmer T.D. Gage F.H.

As these immediateearly genes are induced by inflammation and can, in turn, enhance or attenuate inflammation by modulating transcription, the NR4A receptors may have diverse roles in a number of inflammatory diseases. Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis (OA). Inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins are released from infiltrating immune cells and resident joint cells. These soluble mediators induce changes in gene expression that modulate the tightly regulated program of inflammation and the subsequent degradation of extracellular matrix components (31Burrage P.S. Mix K.S. Brinckerhoff C.E. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated elevated levels of NR4A receptors in synovial tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (32Murphy E.P. McEvoy A. Conneely O.M. Bresnihan B. FitzGerald O.

The cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α and the growth factors vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor potently induce NURR1 in synoviocytes and endothelial cells derived from inflamed joints (32Murphy E.P.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-generated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is the most robust regulator of NURR1 expression in these cell types (32Murphy E.P. McEvoy A. Conneely O.M. Bresnihan B. FitzGerald O.

Taken together, the expression patterns of the NR4A receptors and the target genes identified in joint tissues suggest a role for these transcription factors in modulating inflammation and tissue homeostasis. Chondrocytes are another important cell type involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory joint disease (43Goldring M.B. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1916-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). These cells are embedded within articular cartilage, where they function to maintain homeostasis by balancing the synthesis of matrix components with the expression of catabolic factors such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). During the progression of inflammatory joint disease, chondrocytes secrete elevated levels of MMPs, which digest components of the extracellular matrix, ultimately leading to the degradation of cartilage, tendon, and bone (31Burrage P.S. Mix K.S. Brinckerhoff C.E. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Expression of these enzymes is largely controlled by critical transcription factors such as activator protein-1 (AP-1), ETS (E26 transformation-specific sequence), and NFκB, which function through defined promoter elements (31Burrage P.S. Mix K.S. Brinckerhoff C.E. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PGE2 can intersect with inflammatory signals and differentially modulate the expression of MMPs and matrix components (44Pillinger M.H. Rosenthal P.B. Tolani S.N. Apsel B. Dinsell V.

In addition, MMP transcription can be altered by nuclear hormone receptors in response to steroid hormones, vitamins, and a number of synthetic compounds (48Eberhardt W. Schulze M. Engels C.

Targeting specific members of the nuclear receptor family may be a viable strategy to suppress MMP transcription in inflamed joints. The functional role of the NR4A orphan receptors has not been investigated in chondrocytes, and we postulate that these receptors may be important regulators of cartilage homeostasis and MMP transcription. In this study, we document elevated levels of NURR1 mRNA in cartilage derived from patients with OA. Relative to Nur77 and NOR-1, NURR1 is expressed at the highest level in chondrocytes, and PGE2 rapidly and potently induces receptor expression. IL-1β-induced MMP-1 expression is dramatically antagonized by PGE2, and because NURR1 is robustly activated by PGE2, this orphan receptor may directly inhibit MMP gene expression. Our results indicate that NURR1 selectively antagonizes IL-1β-induced MMP-1, -3, and -9 gene expression in chondrocytes. We further elucidate MMP-1 as a transcriptional target of NURR1 and characterize novel interactions between NURR1 and ETS transcription factors that mediate repression of the MMP-1 promoter. In conclusion, our findings implicate NURR1 as a novel transcriptional repressor of MMPs, and we propose a protective function for NURR1 in maintaining cartilage homeostasis during inflammation. Procurement of Cartilage—Human cartilage slices were obtained from the knees of patients with advanced OA (50–70 years old) who were undergoing knee replacement surgery. Non-arthritic knee cartilage was obtained from patients with fractures or from patients undergoing amputation because of trauma. Isolation of Primary Chondrocytes—Human cartilage slices were cut into small pieces and digested with Pronase (0.1%) for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by digestion with collagenase P (0.1%) for 12–16 h in Ham's F-12 medium. This cell suspension was used to establish cell cultures and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Human chondrocytes were maintained in chondrocyte growth medium (Cell Applications) as monolayer cultures for not more than 3 days to maintain the chondrocyte phenotype. Tissue Culture and Reagents—SW1353 human chondrosarcoma cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, HEPES, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α+/–; generous gift from Dr. Evan Rosen, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were passaged with 1× Trypsin/EDTA and seeded into 6- or 24-well plates for experiments. For treatments, cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma), and PGE2 (Sigma and Cayman Chemical) or IL-1β (R&D Systems) was added to cells in serum-free medium. In initial experiments, we determined that the vehicles used for these treatments (ethanol, acetone, and phosphate-buffered saline) had no effects on gene expression (supplemental figure). Untreated controls were cells treated in an identical manner with serum-free medium alone. RNA Extraction—RNA was isolated from SW1353 cells using TRIzol solution (Sigma) according to the manufacture's protocol. For primary human chondrocytes, micro-RNeasy columns (Qiagen Inc.) were used after TRIzol extraction for further purification. Cartilage slices were milled into fine powder in liquid nitrogen and extracted with 4 m guanidium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sarcosine, and 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol for 4 h on a rocker. RNA was then extracted with water-saturated phenol, followed by phenol and chloroform. The RNA in the aqueous phase was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol. The RNA pellet was further purified using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer's RNA cleanup protocol. RNA concentrations were determined by A260, and the integrity of RNA was checked by gel electrophoresis. Real-time Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Two micrograms of RNA were reverse-transcribed into cDNA using an oligo(dT) primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was conducted using SYBR Green Master Mix and an ABI PRISM 7900HT thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). Duplicate reactions were analyzed in 10-μl volumes containing 40 ng of cDNA and 0.2 μm primers. Real-time primers have been described previously: NURR1 (38Lammi J. Huppunen J. Aarnisalo P. Mol.

Coon C.I. Gibson J.J. Brinckerhoff C.E. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7200-7202PubMed Google Scholar). Pre-designed TaqMan primers and probes (Applied Biosystems) were used to measure NR4A receptors and COX-2. Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2–(ddc(t)) method with GAPDH as a control. Western Blotting—Nuclear extracts from SW1353 cells were generated using NE-PER protein extraction reagents (Pierce). Five micrograms of protein were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Rabbit anti-NURR1 antibody (clone E-20 (catalog no. sc-990), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) were used, followed by detection with ECL Western substrate (Pierce). In vitro transcribed and translated NURR1 protein was generated using the coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega), and 1 μl of a 50-μl reaction volume was used as a positive control for NURR1 Western blotting. Transfections—For reporter assays, cells were transfected using Geneporter II reagents (Gene Therapy Systems). Cells were seeded in 6- or 24-well plates and transfected with 2 or 0.5 μg of DNA, respectively. MMP-1 promoter-luciferase constructs have been described previously (55Rutter J.L. Benbow U. Coon C.I. Brinckerhoff C.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 322-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 56Rutter J.L. Mitchell T.I. Buttice G. Meyers J. Gusella J.F. Ozelius L.J. Brinckerhoff C.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5321-5325PubMed Google Scholar). The NURR1 expression vectors containing the mouse NURR1 cDNA were pUB6-NURR1 and pCMX-NURR1 (a generous gift from Dr. Thomas Perlmann, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research). The control plasmids used were pUB6-LacZ and pCMV-LacZ. Mutant pCMX-NURR1 plasmids (P560A, F592A, L593A, 1–583) and the pNBRE3-tk-luciferase plasmid were kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Perlmann. The pCMV-ETS1 expression plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Leonie Young (Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the medium was changed to serum-free medium for an additional 24 h. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and proteins were harvested using passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured with a Turner TD luminometer and luciferase assay reagents (Promega). Relative luciferase units can vary among experiments with different promoters and cell types because of differences in basal promoter activities and transfection efficiencies. Experiments were repeated multiple times in triplicate, and similar results were obtained. Amaxa nucleofection technology was used to transfect SW1353 cells with pCMX-NURR1 or pCMV-LacZ. Cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA in Nucleofector Solution T (Amaxa) with program A33. The transfection efficiency of a control green fluorescent protein plasmid was >70%. Cells were seeded into 6-well plates containing growth medium. Following overnight incubation, the medium was changed to serum-free medium with or without IL-1β for an additional 24 h, followed by RNA extraction. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—SW1353 cells were transfected in triplicate with the control pCMV-LacZ or pCMX-NURR1 plasmid by Amaxa and seeded into 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and transferred to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with and without IL-1β. The conditioned medium was collected after 24 h. A human pro-MMP-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems) was used to measure secreted pro-MMP-1. IL-1β-treated medium was diluted 1:10 in calibrator diluent supplied by the manufacturer. Duplicate measurements were performed for each conditioned medium sample, and the absorbance was measured in a plate reader at 450 nm with a reference filter set to 570 nm. Pro-MMP-1 concentrations were determined using a standard curve of pro-MMP-1 (R&D Systems). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Putative NBRE sequences in the MMP-1 promoter were identified using the nucleic acid pattern search application FUZZNUC (bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/fuzznuc.html). A site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to mutate the core GG sequence in each of the putative NBRE sequences on the full-length MMP-1-luciferase construct (details shown in Fig. 5C). The mutated sequences were analyzed with TFSearch (www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html) to ensure that mutagenesis did not create or destroy any additional transc"
https://openalex.org/W2067924463,"Cytochrome P4502S1 (CYP2S1) is expressed at high levels in epithelial tissues and is inducible by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin) via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Transcriptional initiation of mouse Cyp2s1 was found to occur at three regions, ∼198, 102, and 22 nucleotides from the translational initiation codon. Approximately 400 nucleotides upstream of its translational initiation codon, mouse Cyp2s1 contains three overlapping xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE) sequences, which make a major contribution toward dioxin inducibility. Each XRE sequence in this trimeric XRE can bind the AHR/aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) dimer in a dioxin-dependent fashion in vitro and can mediate dioxin-dependent transcription. Cyp2s1 is also markedly inducible by hypoxia. Induction is dependent on hypoxiainducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and is mediated in large part by three overlapping hypoxia response elements (HREs) embedded within the trimeric XRE segment. Although each HRE within this segment can bind HIF-1α/ARNT in vitro, the most 3′ HRE contributes the most toward hypoxia inducibility. AHR/ARNT and HIF-1α/ARNT dimers bind to the region containing the trimeric XRE segment of the endogenous Cyp2s1 gene in vivo in a dioxin-dependent fashion and hypoxia-dependent fashion, respectively. These observations identify a novel regulatory cassette that mediates changes in Cyp2s1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2143868289,"Scaffolding of membrane proteins is a common strategy for forming complexes of proteins, including some connexins, within membrane microdomains. Here we describe studies indicating that Cx32 interacts with a PDZ-containing scaffolding protein, Dlgh1 (Discs Large homolog 1). Initial screens of liver lysates using antibody arrays indicated an interaction between Cx32 and Dlgh1 that was confirmed using coimmunoprecipitation studies. Yeast two-hybrid complementation determined that the Cx32 bound via interaction with the SH3/Hook domain of Dlgh1. Confocal microscopy of liver sections revealed that Cx32 and Dlgh1 could colocalize in hepatocyte membranes in wild type mice. Examination of levels and localization of Dlgh1 in livers from Cx32 null mice indicate that, in the absence of Cx32, Dlgh1 was decreased, and the remainder was translocated from the hepatocyte membrane to the nucleus with some remaining in cytoplasmic compartments. This translocation was confirmed by Western blots comparing Dlgh1 levels in nuclear extracts from wild type and Cx32 null murine livers. Using SKHep cells stably transfected with Cx32 under the control of a tet-off promoter, we found that acute removal of Cx32 led to a decrease of membrane-localized Dlgh1 and an increase in the nuclear localization of this tumor suppressor protein. Together, these results suggest that loss of Cx32 alters the levels, localization, and interactions of the tumor suppressor protein Dlgh1, events known in other systems to alter cell cycle and increase tumorigenicity.

Connexins, of which there are more than 20 isoforms in mice and humans, are tetraspan proteins that oligomerize to form hexameric connexons. Connexons contributed by each cell interact head-to-head across the extracellular space, forming channels providing direct cytoplasmic continuity between cells. Aggregates of these channels, gap junctions, are found in almost all tissues. Connexins have intracellular amino-terminal cytoplasmic loops and carboxyl-terminal domains. Although much of the connexin sequence is highly conserved throughout the protein family, the amino acid sequences of intracellularly localized cytoplasmic loop and carboxyl-terminal domains vary markedly between connexin isoforms, and these regions likely confer isoform specificity. Carboxyl-terminal connexin domains, in particular, contain multiple sites for protein-protein interactions. For example, the major gap junction protein of heart and astrocytes, Connexin43 (Cx43), 2The abbreviations used are: Cx43, Connexin43; SH, Src homology; MAGUK, membrane-associated guanylate kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; CT, carboxyl-terminal; NT, amino-terminal; CL, cytoplasmic loop. possesses binding sites for Src homology 3 (SH3), SH2, WW, MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), and PDZ within its carboxyl-terminal domain, and other connexins, although less well mapped, also display potential binding sites. The function of these protein-protein interactions is not well understood, but many of them regulate the function of the gap junction channel (1Ahmad S. Martin P.E. Evans W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4544-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis of the primary sequence of the α subdivision of connexins (which includes Cx43) for consensus binding sites indicates that many of these connexins have potential PDZ interaction domains, whereas the primary sequences of the β subdivision of connexins (including the major gap junction protein of liver and myelinating glia, Cx32) do not contain these potential interaction sites. This leads to the question of whether the α connexins are scaffolded while the β connexins are not or whether there are alternative binding domains within the PDZ-containing proteins that interact with β connexins. The PDZ domain-containing proteins, including Discs Large and its mammalian homolog (Dlgh1), belong to a family of proteins known as membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs). These proteins have multiple functions, including scaffolding of ion channels, heterodimerization to form protein microdomains, and regulation of junctional complexes. Dlgh1, in particular, has been shown to be involved in cellular growth control via a nuclear translocation mechanism (2Ishidate T. Matsumine A. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The PDZ domains are the primary sites of protein-protein interactions with many macromolecular components, but the SH3 region, with its “hook” region also participates in the formation of protein-protein interactions (reviewed in Funke et al. (3Funke L. Dakoji S. Bredt D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 219-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar)). We here report our studies examining the interaction of a β connexin, Cx32, with the MAGUK protein Dlgh1. In normal murine livers, Cx32 and Dlgh1 were found to colocalize at sites of cell-cell contact, whereas in livers of Cx32 null mice and in hepatoma cells, where Cx32 was acutely down-regulated, expression of Dlgh1 was reduced and the remaining Dlgh1 protein was largely localized within the nucleus. As revealed by yeast two-hybrid complementation, the interaction of Cx32 with Dlgh1 is non-canonical, involving the SH3/Hook/GUK region rather than the PDZ domains. When Dlgh1 is localized to cell membranes, it regulates cell growth, blocking cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase. Translocation of hDlg to the nucleus has been shown to increase cell proliferation (3Funke L. Dakoji S. Bredt D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 219-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Loss of Cx32 has been shown to promote the formation of induced hepatic tumors (4Dagli M.L. Yamasaki H. Kurtovskikh V. Omori Y. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 5Temme A. Buchmann A. Gabriel H.D. Nelles E. Schwarz M. Willecke K. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 713-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that one mechanism by which Cx32 may act to control cell proliferation in liver is through maintenance of membrane-associated Dlgh1 in addition to the intracellular communication that gap junctions provide. Liver Lysate Preparation—For antibody arrays (whole lysates from 5 mg of liver tissue), Western (50 μg) and coimmunoprecipitation studies (whole lysates from 5 mg of tissue protein matched across samples). Adult C56B mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and decapitated prior to removal of the liver. Whole liver was extracted, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and lysed in complete lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 mm sodium-deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, ½ tablet of Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were sonicated for 30 s, maintained on ice for 30 min, and then triturated and spun at 10,000 revolutions/min for 10 min. Total protein was assessed using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Lysates were then equalized to 50 μg by dilution in lysis buffer. The supernatant was retained for use in arrays and coimmunoprecipitation studies. Antibody Arrays—Hypromatrix (Worcester, MA) antibody arrays were reacted with liver lysate and probed with HRP-tagged Cx32 antibody according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In-house antibody arrays were produced on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and spotted with 32 different antibodies (6Duffy H.S. Iacobas I. Spray D.C. Ashton A.W. Methods in Cardiovascular Res. Springer Press, Berlin2005: 916-935Google Scholar). For this, membranes were wet in 100% methanol and rinsed three times in PBS. Antibodies (0.05 μg/spot) were individually spotted onto the membrane using a BioDot array spotter (Bio-Rad). All arrays were made in triplicate for statistical analysis. Following drying of the array, the membrane was blocked for 2 h in 5% skim milk with 0.05% Tween 20, incubated with lysates from whole liver (see above) for 2 h, rinsed three times for 10 min in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), exposed to HRP-conjugated Cx32 antibody (antibody conjugated to HRP using the EZ Link Biotech kit (Pierce catalog number 31489) according to the manufacturer's instructions for 2 h in 5% skim milk and then rinsed, and HRP was detected using the ECL protein detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were exposed to x-ray film and then developed on an Exomat developing system. Coimmunoprecipitation Studies—Coimmunoprecipitations were performed as previously described (3Funke L. Dakoji S. Bredt D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 219-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole liver lysates were treated as noted above to produce supernatant (50 μg of total protein). Supernatant was precleared by spinning with 50 μl of Sepharose A beads (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer (250 mg of Sepharose A), incubated in 2 ml of lysis buffer on ice for 15 min. The beads were spun at 3000 revolutions/min for 3 min and washed 3 times in lysis buffer. Following the wash, the beads were diluted 1:1 beads:lysis buffer and kept at 4 °C. Following preclear, 1.5 μg of Cx32 antibody was added (Cx32, polyclonal Zymed Laboratories Inc., Temecula, CA), and Dlgh1, monoclonal antibody (Affinity Bioreagents), and supernatant were rotated for 4 h at 4°C. Thereafter, 100 μl of Sepharose beads was added, and the sample was rotated overnight at 4 °C. The following day, the sample was spun at 5000 revolutions/min for 10 min and supernatant discarded. The beads were rinsed six times in lysis buffer, incubated in 60 μl of loading buffer (2× Laemmli buffer plus dithiothreitol), incubated in 100 °C water for 2 min, and then placed immediately on ice for 2 min. The sample was then spun and the loading buffer removed from the beads for running on Western blots using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and Cx32 or Dlgh1 were detected with the appropriate antibodies. Yeast Two-Hybrid Complementation Assays—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain AH109 was cotransformed with the following GAL4ad fusion constructs: GAL4ad-NT (hDlg-(1–233)), GAL4ad-PDZ1–2 (hDlg-(200–463)), GAL4ad-PDZ3 (hDlg-(451–587)), GAL4ad-SH3/Hook (hDlg-(569–764)), and GAL4ad-SV40 Large T antigen (control) or with the following GAL4bd fusion constructs: GAL4bd-Cx32CT (Cx32-(209–283)), GAL4bd-Cx32CL (Cx32-(96–127)), GAL4bd-Cx32NT (Cx32-(1–22)), and GAL4bd-pVA3 murine p53 (control). Cotransformants were assayed for growth on nonselective (+His) and selective (–His) media. Cell Culture—Parental and Cx32-tet-off transfected SkHep cells were plated directly on coverslips and grown until 80–90% confluent. The cells were treated with 30 μm tetracycline (13Laird D.W. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 527-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) for 0, 24, 48, or 96 h and used for immunocytochemistry. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Rapidly frozen liver samples were sectioned (15 microns) using a Shandon electronic cryotome. Sections or cultured SkHep1 cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated in 50 mm NH4Cl for 3 h to quench autofluorescence. Following quench, sections were blocked (PBS plus 10% goat serum plus 0.4% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies directed against Cx32 (Sigma) and polyclonal Dlgh1/SAP97 (Affinity Bioreagents) at 4 °C overnight. Following 30 min of rinsing (3× for 10 min in PBS plus 0.4% Triton X-100), the slices were incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor anti-mouse 488 and anti-rabbit 595) for 1 h at room temperature. The slices were rinsed for 50 min (5× for 10 min) and mounted on glass microscope slides with Vectrashield anti-fade agent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and examined on a confocal microscope (Olympus BX61WQ Fluoview confocal system). Images were processed using Imaris Image Pro software. Nuclear Extraction—For SKHep1 cells, at 0, 24, 49, and 96 h time points, 100-mm dishes of confluent SkHep cells were washed with PBS and prepared for nuclear extraction (Bio-Rad) according to their instructions. Samples were subjected to protein level determination using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), run on either 10% (Cx32) or 7.5% (Dlgh1) SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and probed using antibodies against Cx32 and Dlgh1, respectively, as described above. Segregation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Fractions—Isolation and preparation of cells harvested from whole mouse liver. Wild type and Cx32 null mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (inhaled). The left ventricle was located and perfused with an EGTA-containing solution (0.5 mm EGTA, 15 mm HEPES, 130 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm glucose, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm taurine) to remove blood and flush the organs; the right atrium was cut to facilitate solution outflow. The system was perfused until the liver was completely blanched, and the liver was dissected and washed with PBS. To obtain a cell suspension, the liver was ground with a pestle and successively strained through two mesh cell separators of 230 and 80 μm each. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and placed on ice. Analysis of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Proteins for Cx32 and Dlgh1—The cytoplasmic and nuclear samples were assayed for protein concentration (Bio-Rad) and their volumes determined. Cytoplasmic (50 μg) and a proportional amount of nuclear protein were loaded in Laemmli buffer for separation by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) for Western blotting. The membranes were probed with antibodies to Cx32 and Dlgh1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualized on x-ray film using chemiluminescence (Pierce). The purity of the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions was confirmed by probing the membranes with antibodies to markers of the cell cytoplasm (Rho-GDI, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and nucleus (Histone H1, NeoMarkers; or Lamin A/C, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Western blotting was analyzed by densitometry. Measurements of Junctional Conductance—Cell pairs in cultures seeded at low density were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of 0 mV using patch pipettes connected to an Axo 1C patch clamp amplifier; junctional conductance was calculated as the current recorded in one cell divided by a 10 mV step applied to the other cell. In targeted immunoprecipitation experiments with likely partners, Cx32 has previously been shown to interact with Caveolin1 (7Schubert A.L. Schubert W. Spray D.C. Lisanti M.P.

To identify additional binding partners, using an unbiased approach, we initially screened for Cx32 interactions within liver lysates using Hypromatrix antibody arrays, finding a number of novel potential interactions including Dlgh1 (results not shown). These were followed up with in-house antibody arrays in which we spotted membranes with antibodies that we had screened for specificity for the target protein. When incubated with whole liver lysates and probed with HRP-tagged anti-Cx32, the in-house antibody arrays indicated that, within liver, Cx32 interacts with several complexes of proteins, including a complex containing the scaffolding protein Dlgh1 (Fig. 1A). In this illustration, Spot c contained antibodies directed against Dlgh1, and Cx32-HRP binding determined that Cx32 was within the complex of proteins captured at this spot. Densitometric analysis of the spot indicates that the signal was much stronger for the Cx32 interaction with Dlgh1 than with ANT (adenine nucleotide translocator) protein (spot a), Claudin-1 (spot b), or VDAC (voltage-dependent anion-selective channel) (spot d), although for each of these spots the signal was higher than background, presumably indicating weak or higher order interactions with Cx32 (Fig. 1B, n = 3). The Dlgh1-Cx32 interaction was confirmed using coimmunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 1C). The reverse coimmunoprecipitation also indicated an interaction between these two proteins with the Dlgh1 antibody immunoprecipitates containing a 32-kDa protein that was immunoreactive to the Cx32 antibodies. Immunoprecipitation of Dlgh1 from Cx32 null livers indicated that there is no signal for Dlgh1 when Cx32 antibody was used for pulldowns in the Cx32 null background (data not shown). As a control for immunoprecipitation experiments, we performed Western blots of liver homogenate from Cx32 null mice. As shown in Fig. 1C, second lane, Dlgh1 remained in the liver lysate from Cx32 null mice. However, in quantitative experiments in which Dlgh1 levels were normalized against β-actin levels, Dlgh1 abundance was substantially reduced (∼4-fold) in livers from Cx32 null mice (1D). It was of interest to determine whether the interaction between Cx32 and hDlg was via a PDZ domain, particularly because the Cx32 carboxyl-terminal domain does not contain a canonical PDZ interaction site. Thus, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay to identify which of the Cx32 and Dlgh1 domains physically associate in vivo (Fig. 2). The CT, CL, and NT domains of Cx32 and the NT, PDZ1–2, PDZ3, and SH3/Hook domains of Dlgh1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) were coexpressed in AH109 yeast cells as GAL4 DNA-binding domain (bd) fusion proteins and as GAL4 transactivation domain (ad) fusion proteins, respectively. Interestingly, there was no interaction between any Cx32 cytoplasmic domain and any PDZ domain of Dlgh1. Instead, a direct interaction was observed between the hDlg SH3/Hook domain and both the Cx32CT and Cx32CL domains. To determine whether this interaction was seen in native tissues, we performed immunocytochemistry on wild type and Cx32 null liver. For these studies, 15-μm sections of liver were stained for localization of Cx32 and Dlgh1 (Fig. 3, A–H). The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (A and E). In wild type liver, Cx32 localizes around cell membranes (Fig. 3B) as does Dlgh1 (Fig. 3C). An overlay of these images shows apparent colocalization of Cx32 and Dlgh1 at sites of cell membranes (Fig. 3D). In contrast, in the Cx32 null livers, as expected, there is no staining for Cx32 (Fig. 3F), and Dlgh1 is no longer primarily localized to the membranes (Fig. 3G). Overlay of these images indicates that the remaining Dlgh1 is found within the cell nuclei rather than at the membranes. Higher magnification images of wild type (Fig. 3I) and Cx32 null hepatocytes (Fig. 3J) show how dramatic the changes in Dlgh1 localization are in the Cx32 null livers. To verify translocation of Dlgh1 protein into the cell nuclei, where it might play a functional role, we extracted nuclei from wild type and Cx32 null livers and probed the nuclear extracts for both Cx32 and Dlgh1 (Fig. 3K). Using Rho-GD1 to determine the purity of the cytoplasmic fraction and histone to determine the purity of the nuclear fraction, we found that Cx32 was primarily present in the cytoplasmic fraction of cells from wild type livers, with little signal seen in the nuclear component, whereas Cx32 was absent from both liver fractions from Cx32 null mice. The small amount of Cx32 seen in the nucleus in wild type liver likely corresponds to a small cytoplasmic contaminant evidenced by a low but visible Rho-GD1 signal in the wild type liver nuclear fraction. Dlgh1 was found in the cytoplasm and at low levels in the nucleus of the hepatocytes from wild type livers. However, there was a large increase in the levels of Dlgh1 within the nuclear fraction of the Cx32 null livers (Fig. 3, K and L).FIGURE 3Confocal immunolocalization of Cx32 and Dlgh1 in wild type and Cx32 null murine liver. A, the number and location of cells was marked by DAPI staining of the hepatocyte nuclei. B, Cx32 was localized in a punctate fashion on the plasma membrane of hepatocyte around the entire periphery of most cells. C, Dlgh1 localized to the plasma membrane in a solid line of protein. D, confocal colocalization of these two proteins indicates that these two proteins overlap at most sites of Cx32 immunoreactivity, suggesting that Cx32 is in close contact with Dlgh1 in these cells. E, nuclear staining by DAPI. F, as expected, there was no reactivity to the anti-Cx32 antibody, confirming the knock-out of Cx32 in these animals. G, staining for Dlgh1 showed an altered localization of this protein in the livers of knock-out Cx32 mice. In these cells, Dlgh1 is no longer primarily localized to cell membranes in these hepatocytes; instead it appears to localize either around or within the nuclei of these hepatocytes (H). Higher magnification image of Cx32 and Dlgh1 at a section between two hepatocytes shows punctate Cx32 staining around Dlgh1 regions on the membrane (I) but primarily nuclear localization in the Cx32 null livers (J). To determine whether the Dlgh1 protein was translocating into the nucleus, Western blot analysis of nuclear Dlgh1 levels in Cx32 knock-out liver was done. Following nuclear extraction and purification, liver nuclear extracts from both wild type and Cx32 knock-out mice were blotted for Cx32 and Dlgh1 (K). Histone was used to determine the purity of the nuclear fraction, whereas Rho-GD1 was used to determine the purity of the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclei of wild type animals (n = 3) showed little Cx32 but did contain a small amount of Dlgh1, whereas nuclei from Cx32 knock-out mice (n = 3) showed no Cx32 but had a large increase in the levels of Dlgh1 (K) within these purified nuclear extracts (L). There were no changes in overall cadherin levels (M), and localization of cadherin in the Cx32 null hepatocytes (O) was identical to that seen in the wild type hepatocytes (N).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cadherin, the functional component of adherens junctions, functions to maintain normal cell-cell contact. To determine whether there were changes in cadherin expression that might alter the ability of cells to adhere and form proper cell-cell contacts in the Cx32 null livers, we evaluated cadherin levels using Western blot analysis and immunostaining. Using a pancadherin antibody, which identifies both the 135-kDa isoform as well as a 120-kDa isoforms, we found no significant difference between the levels of cadherin in hepatocytes from Cx32 null livers (Fig. 3M). In conjunction with the Western blot analysis, immunostaining studies of cadherin revealed no difference in the staining pattern for cadherin in wild type and Cx32 null liver sections (Fig. 3, N and O). Colocalization analysis of Cx32, Dlgh1, and nuclei were done on confocal stacks of images from both wild type and Cx32 null liver sections using the Imaris colocalization algorithms (11Costes S.V. Daelemans D. Cho E.H. Dobbin Z. Pavlakis G. Lockett S. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3993-4003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Regions of the wild type liver were selected in which colocalization profiles of Cx32 with Dlgh1 were characterized (Fig. 4, high magnification image in upper right panel), and regions of Cx32 null liver sections were selected for calculating colocalization of Dlgh1 with DAPI-stained nuclei (Fig. 4, high magnification image in upper right panel). Wild type liver exhibited regions along cell membranes where Cx32 and Dlgh1 were colocalized within the entire confocal stack (Fig. 4, lower right panel). In contrast, the localization profile of Dlgh1 showed strong colocalization with the nuclei in Cx32 null livers throughout the confocal stack (Fig. 4, lower right panel). Chronic long term loss of Cx32, as is seen in the Cx32 null mouse, might be expected to trigger alterations in cell function that subsequently lead to a loss of Dlgh1 at cell membranes. Thus, the loss of Cx32 might not be a primary step in the Dlgh1 alterations seen in the Cx32 null livers. To determine whether similar changes occurred with acute loss of Cx32, we used the normally connexin-deficient SkHep1 cell human hepatoma cell line transfected with Cx32 driven by a tet-off promoter (12Fishman G.I. Gao Y. Hertzberg E.L. Spray D.C. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the absence of tetracycline, Cx32 is robustly expressed in these cells (Fig. 5A), and Dlgh1 is prominent at cell membranes (Fig. 4). Overlay shows regions of overlap of these two proteins. Dual whole cell voltage clamp studies on cell pairs indicate that these cells are highly coupled (Fig. 5M). After 24 h of tetracycline treatment, Cx32 was no longer seen at cell membranes (Fig. 5D); Dlgh1 was still present, although its localization at the membrane was patchy, generally not fully encircling the cells (Fig. 5E). Overlay of these images shows substantially less colocalization of these two proteins than before tetracycline treatment (Fig. 5F). Junctional conductance was reduced by >10-fold in cells treated for 24 h with tetracycline (Fig. 5M). Extending the tetracycline treatment to 48 h further decreased Cx32 levels (Fig. 5G), and Dlgh1 was primarily located in the cytoplasm rather than at the membrane (Fig. 5H). Junctional conductance remained very low (Fig. 5M). Overlay of the images indicates no colocalization of Cx32 and Dlgh1. By 96 h of treatment, complete loss of Cx32 protein occurred (Fig. 5J), and Dlgh1 was then seen only localizing with cell nuclei (Fig. 5K, overlay 5L).FIGURE 5Confocal studies of SkHep cells transfected with tet-off Cx32. SkHep cells were immunostained for either Cx32 (green) or Dlgh1 (red) and examined for the amount of overlay of the two proteins. A shows images of non-tetracycline-treated SkHep cells, where Cx32 can be seen at sites of cell-cell contact, and as is common with connection-transfected cells, perinuclearly. Dlgh1 can be seen around the periphery of the cells outlining the cell membranes (B). Overlay images show that these two proteins show areas of colocalization in these untreated SkHep cells (C). Following 24 h of tetracycline treatment, Cx32 was reduced to the perinuclear fraction (D), whereas the Dlgh1 was still seen on parts of the membrane, although slightly decreased as compared with the untreated cells (E). Overlay images show less colocalization of Cx32 with Dlgh1 following the 24 h treatment period (F). G shows that 48 h of tetracycline treatment obliterates almost all Cx32, and Dlgh1 is then found to be almost exclusively nuclear or perinuclear (H). Overlay images show no colocalization between the two proteins (I). By 96 h of tetracycline treatment, there was no Cx32 expression (J), the Dlgh1 was localized within the nuclei (K), and again, no colocalization of the two proteins was seen (L). Electrophysiological studies indicate that the Cx32 forms functional channels in these cells when tetracycline is absent, but coupling is lost as early as only 24 h after treatment and remained low for the entire treatment period (M).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Initial studies showing interaction of connexins with scaffolding proteins have begun to find multiple interacting proteins with a small subset of connexins. The studies reported here are the first to show interaction of Cx32 with such binding partners. Although connexins turn over in the plasma membrane rather rapidly (13Laird D.W. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 527-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), scaffolding proteins remain. Thus, although the connexins may aid in the organization of the microdomain, the scaffolding protein is likely to be the more stable link. This would set up a “target” for cycling connexins that may underlie how connexins are added to the plaque along the outer edges of the plaques (14Lauf U. Giepmans B.N. Braconnot S. Chen S.C. Falk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10446-10451Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Cross-talk between these proteins could then allow for a symbiotic relationship where, at least in this case, Cx32 may “signal” where the microdomain forms, and once recruited, Dlgh1 is needed to form a stable platform. Thus, we hypothesize that, when Cx32 is initially removed from the cells, the Dlg1 remains for a while, but when newly translated Cx32 does not insert into the plasma membrane, the organizational signal is lost and the Dlgh1 is no longer directed to the plasma membrane but rather to the cell nucleus as a portion of the signal that indicates loss of cell-cell coupling. The remaining Dlgh1 is degraded over time, causing a delay between the loss of Cx32 and translocation of Dlgh1. Previous reports suggest that, in addition to providing direct intracellular communication between coupled cells, connexins (either alone or as components of the Nexus (15Duffy H.S. Delmar M. Spray D.C. J. Physiol. (Paris). 2002; 96: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) complex) might be involved in other processes, including growth control (16Hirschi K.K. Xu C.E.

There are also numerous studies reporting that manipulation of gap junction gene expression modifies the expression of other genes (23Stains J.P. Civitelli R. Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today. 2005; 75: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). There are at least two distinct mechanisms by which expression of other genes may be modified by expression of connexins, channel-dependent mechanisms and channel-independent mechanisms. Channel-dependent mechanisms that have been proposed include the direct transfer of genetic information, a concept that was attractive in the early days of gap junction research but turned out to be artifactual (24Pitts J.D. Finbow M.E. Kam E. Br. J. Cancer Suppl. 1988; 9: 52-57PubMed Google Scholar). However, this possibility has recently reappeared with the demonstration that RNA interference-sized oligonucleotides may pass from cell to cell (25Valiunas V. Polosina Y.Y. Miller H. Potapova I.A. Valiuniene L. Doronin S. Mathias R.T. Robinson R.B. Rosen M.R. Cohen I.S. Brink P.R. J. Physiol. 2005; 568: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and by a report that gap junctions may permit passage of large peptides, permitting “cross-presentation” of antigens (26Neijssen J. Herberts C. Drijfhout J.W. Reits E. Janssen L. Neefjes J. Nature. 2005; 434: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been proposed that intracellular communication provided by Cx43 can modulate gene transcription in osteocytes by differential recruitment of Sp1/Sp3 transcription factors to the osteocalcin promoter (27Stains J.P. Lecanda F. Screen J. Towler D.A. Civitelli R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24377-24387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Stains J.P. Civitelli R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this scenario, the effectors are believed to be gap junction-permeant second messenger molecules that may act through increasing or decreasing the phosphorylation state of transcription factors. Connexin-dependent but channel-independent mechanisms for the control of gene expression include the possibility that the carboxyl-terminal domain of Cx43 can translocate to the nucleus, acting there as a transcription factor (29Dang X. Doble B.W. Kardami E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 242: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), or that connexins might bind to molecules with both membrane or cytosolic localization and also with transcriptional activity; in this scenario, varying connexin abundance would lead to changes in the expression of other genes by shifting the equilibrium between the connexin-bound pool and a nonbound pool that could translocate to the nucleus. The first evidence for this mechanism was the study of Wnt-1 regulation of Cx43 expression and function in cardiac myocytes (30Ai Z. Fischer A. Spray D.C. Brown A.M. Fishman G.I. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar); β-catenin was shown to interact directly with Cx43 and also to translocate to the nucleus when activated by Wnt-1 signaling. β-catenin transactivated Cx43 transcription, providing a mechanism whereby Cx43 binding to another molecule, independent of its channel function, could regulate its own transcription. A similar mechanism has been recently proposed involving the growth regulator CCN3 (NOV) (31Fu C.T. Bechberger J.F. Ozog M.A. Perbal B. Naus C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36943-36950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 32Gellhaus A. Dong X. Propson S. Maass K. Klein-Hitpass L. Kibschull M. Traub O. Willecke K. Perbal B. Lye S.J. Winterhager E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36931-36942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), in which NOV is localized to Cx43 at the membrane. When Cx43 is down-regulated, NOV translocates to the nucleus producing a transformed phenotype with increased growth rate. Similarly, Penes et al. (33Penes M.C. Li X. Nagy J.I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 404-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have reported that the transcription factor ZO-1-associated nucleic acid-binding protein (ZONAB) is colocalized and coimmunoprecipitates with ZO-1 and connexins in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, providing an additional substrate for the regulation of transcription factor availability by the abundance of connexins. Nuclear localization of members of the MAGUK family of proteins has been reported for both ZO-1 and CASK (calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine kinase) with nuclear translocation causing alterations of cell proliferation, activation of the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors and changes in the levels of cell cycle regulators such as Cyclin D and c-Myc (34Hsueh Y.P. Curr. Med. Chem. 2006; 13: 1915-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our finding that, in response to cellular perturbation, Dlgh1 also translocates to the nucleus expands the repertoire of regulatory roles of MAGUK proteins. Regulation of this translocation may be one mechanism by which Cx32 regulates cell proliferation. In summary, we describe here the novel interaction of Cx32 and the scaffolding protein Dlgh1 by a noncanonical interaction of the SH3/Hook domain of Dlgh1 and the Cx32 cytoplasmic loop and carboxyl tail. Further research is needed to determine the functions of this interaction and will likely yield interesting information on the role of connexins in macromolecular complexes."

We have previously shown that glucocorticoids inhibit the secretion of MCP-1 in arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC) by markedly decreasing MCP-1 mRNA stability. We now report that the destabilization of MCP-1 mRNA is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The GR antagonist, RU486, blocked the effect of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) on MCP-1 mRNA stability in SMC culture. Using a previously reported in vitro mRNA gel shift and stability assay, antibodies to the GR blocked the ability of cytoplasmic extracts from Dex-treated SMC to decay MCP-1 mRNA. Recombinant human GR (rhGR) bound in a concentration-dependent manner to in vitro transcribed MCP-1 mRNA, whereas other members of the steroid hormone receptor family did not. Binding of GR to MCP-1 mRNA was specific as it was not found to bind other mRNAs. Immunoprecipitation of GR in extracts from Dex-treated SMC followed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that endogenous GR was bound specifically to MCP-1 mRNA. The addition of exogenous rhGR blocked the ability of extracts from Dex-treated SMC to degrade MCP-1 mRNA, suggesting that exogenous rhGR can compete with an endogenous GR-containing degradative complex. These data suggest a novel role for the GR in binding to and facilitating mRNA degradation. These results provide novel insights into GR function and may provide a new approach to attenuate the inflammatory response mediated by MCP-1.

Recent studies employing mice lacking MCP-1 or its receptor, CCR2, crossed into an atherosclerotic background (e.g. apoE–/– or LDLR–/– mice), have established that MCP-1 plays a dominant role in attracting monocyte/macrophages to developing atherosclerotic plaques (10Boring L.

Therefore, MCP-1 appears to be an important target for attenuating arterial inflammation.Glucocorticoids are clinically important agents that possess a wide variety of anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties.

Pathol. 1996; 149: 307-317PubMed Google Scholar) by rat aortic SMC. This effect was seen with other glucocorticoids but not with mineralocorticoids, estrogen, progesterone, or testosterone. Of note, the effect of Dex on MCP-1 mRNA accumulation in rat aortic SMC was due predominantly to a decrease in mRNA stability and not to changes in MCP-1 transcription (24Poon M. Megyesi J. Green R.S. Zhang H. Rollins B.J. Safirstein R. Taubman M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22375-22379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As determined by in vivo and in vitro decay assays, Dex reduced the half-life (t½) of MCP-1 mRNA in the presence of PDGF or serum from ∼3 h to ∼30 min (21Poon M. Gertz S.D. Fallon J.T. Wiegman P.

Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6471-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The effect of glucocorticoids involved the binding of a protein complex to the 5′ end (nucleotides 1–224) of the MCP-1 mRNA (26Poon M. Liu B. Taubman M.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6471-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These data suggest that part of the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids may be mediated by their regulation of MCP-1 mRNA stability.Although there is considerable information on the mechanism underlying glucocorticoid-mediated transcription activation or inhibition, much less is known about the effects of glucocorticoids on mRNA stability. We now report that the effect of Dex on MCP-1 mRNA stability is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and involves a novel mechanism in which the GR binds directly to MCP-1 mRNA and facilitates its degradation. These results provide new insights into GR function and to the mechanisms regulating MCP-1 mRNA stability.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—rhGR (product number G1542), recombinant human estrogen receptor (rhER; E1528), and RU486 (M8046) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Human retinoic acid receptor (RAR; product number sc-4088), human mineralicorticoid receptor (MCR; sc-4419), and protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (sc-2003) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies recognizing amino acids 245–259 of hGR were obtained from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO) (PA1–512) and Abcam (Cambridge, UK) (antibody number Ab3579). Antibodies recognizing the carboxyl terminus (sc-1002) and amino terminus (amino acids 395–411 (sc-12763) and 121–421 (sc-8992)) of hGR were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibody to the estrogen receptor (ER) (product number MAI-310) was obtained from Affinity BioReagents.Cell Culture—Rat aortic SMC were isolated from the thoracic aortas of 200–300-g male Sprague-Dawley rats by enzymatic dissociation and cultured as described previously (24Poon M. Megyesi J. Green R.S. Zhang H. Rollins B.J. Safirstein R. Taubman M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22375-22379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The response to Dex has been consistently seen with cells as early as passage 5 and as late as passage 23 (26Poon M. Liu B. Taubman M.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6471-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at confluence (∼2 × 106 cells/100-mm-diameter dish) 36 h after the addition of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum.In Vitro Decay Assays—The MCP-1 constructs were generated by PCR using the full-length human MCP-1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number S71513) as template. Linearized cDNAs were transcribed in vitro with T3 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (26Poon M. Liu B. Taubman M.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6471-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Capped transcript was generated using a 4:1 ratio of m7G5ÅåpppG (Roche Applied Science) to GTP. Tissue factor (TF; Genbank accession number U07619), c-fos (X06769), Mena (mammalian homologue of Drosophila enabled, accession number BC062927), and pBluescript KS (Stratagene) mRNAs were also in vitro transcribed from their linearized full-length cDNAs. Probes were purified on 4% polyacrylamide gels. Cytosolic (S-100) extracts were prepared from SMC as described previously (26Poon M. Liu B. Taubman M.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6471-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations (generally 250–500 ng/μl) were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) (31Wang J. Zhu Z. Nolfo R. Elias J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L175-L185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro RNA gel shifts and decay assays were performed and analyzed on polyacrylamide gels as described previously (26Poon M. Liu B. Taubman M.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6471-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation—Co-immunoprecipitation of MCP-1 mRNA from SMC extracts with antibody to GR was performed using the method of Tenenbaum et al. (32Tenenbaum S.A. Lager P.J. Carson C.C. Keene J.D. Methods. 2002; 26: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Following several washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, SMC were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman on ice. The cells were then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in polysome lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with RNase inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics) and protease inhibitor (protease inhibitor mixture P8340, Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were then passed through a 29-gauge needle, mixed several times with a hand pipettor, placed on ice for 5 min, and then stored at –80 °C. Prior to use, lysates were thawed and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads were swollen in NT2 buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin to a final ratio of ∼1:5 (v/v) for at least 1 h prior to use. Beads (100 μl) were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with 6 mg of antibody, washed five times with NT2 buffer, and then resuspended in 850 μl of NT2 buffer containing 200 units of Rnase OUT (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm vanadyl ribonucleoside complexes, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 15 mm EDTA. The beads were then mixed with 100 μl of the cell lysate and incubated with shaking at room temperature for 2 h. The beads were washed six times with ice-cold NT2 buffer and resuspended in 100 μl of NT2 buffer supplemented with 0.1% SDS and 30 μgof proteinase K at 55 °C for 30 min. The immunoprecipitated RNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation.Real-time PCR—First strand cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Assays were performed in triplicate using the Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The 20-μl reaction mixture was comprised of 2 μl of cDNA, 900 nm forward primer, 900 nm reverse primer, 1× SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems), and DNase-free water. Amplification conditions were: 10 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 20 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 60 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C. The primers for rat MCP-1 spanned nucleotides 76–320 and, for TF, nucleotides 301–800.RNA Blot Analysis—Isolation of total RNA and RNA blot hybridization with the full-length rat JE cDNA were performed as described previously (24Poon M. Megyesi J. Green R.S. Zhang H. Rollins B.J. Safirstein R. Taubman M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22375-22379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal loading of total RNA was verified by ethidium bromide staining of the 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA.RESULTSRU486 Blocks the Inhibitory Effect of Dex on MCP-1 mRNA Accumulation in SMC—We have previously shown that Dex inhibits MCP-1 mRNA accumulation in rat aortic SMC by enhancing its decay (24Poon M. Megyesi J. Green R.S. Zhang H. Rollins B.J. Safirstein R. Taubman M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22375-22379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Poon M. Liu B. Taubman M.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6471-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of the GR in this process, SMC were treated for 3 h with 20 ng/ml PDGF alone or in the presence of 1 μm Dex, and MCP-1 mRNA abundance was analyzed by blot hybridization. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, Dex completely blocked the accumulation of MCP-1 mRNA. RU486, an inhibitor of the GR, blocked the effect of Dex in a concentration-dependent manner. RU486 had no effect on control or PDGF-inducible levels of MCP-1 mRNA.GR Antibody Blocks Dex-mediated MCP-1 mRNA Degradation—We have previously reported an in vitro mRNA decay assay using RNA gel shifts in which the rates of decay of MCP-1 mRNA in the presence of PDGF and Dex were similar to those measured in cell culture (26Poon M. Liu B. Taubman M.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6471-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In these assays, we observed at very early incubation times (e.g. 5 min) that the gel shift with Dex extract was higher than the gel shift seen with control extracts, suggesting that additional proteins bind to the MCP-1 mRNA in the Dex extract, perhaps facilitating its degradation (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, extracts from PDGF-treated cells produce a shift lower than control and Dex-treated extracts, suggesting that PDGF treatment might interfere with the binding of proteins that normally contribute to MCP-1 mRNA degradation (33Liu B. Poon M. Taubman M.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2006; 41: 160-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To elucidate further the role of GR in the Dex-mediated decay of MCP-1 mRNA, RNA decay assays were performed in the presence of an antibody to GR. As shown in Fig. 1D, cytoplasmic extracts from untreated control (lane C) SMC caused a gel shift and stabilized the 32P-labeled MCP-1 probe, whereas extracts from Dex-treated SMC completely degraded the probe after a 30-min incubation. Antibody to GR blocked the ability of extracts from Dex-treated SMC to degrade MCP-1 mRNA, whereas antibodies to PDGF-BB (as an “irrelevant” control) or to Dex (not shown) had no effect. Of note, the shift seen with Dex extracts at 30 min in the presence of antibody to the GR had the same mobility as that seen with control extracts, suggesting that the antibody prevented the formation of the higher molecular weight band produced by Dex extracts.MCP-1 mRNA Binds Directly to GR—The above data suggested that GR present in cytoplasmic extracts was directly involved in MCP-1 mRNA degradation. To determine whether there was any physical interaction between MCP-1 and GR, in vitro transcribed 32P-labeled full-length human MCP-1 mRNA was incubated directly with rhGR and analyzed on non-denaturing gels. The rhGR produced a shift in MCP-1 mRNA after only 5 min of incubation (Fig. 2A). The same shift was observed at 30 and 60 min (data not shown), suggesting that GR alone does not degrade the MCP-1 mRNA and requires the activity of a ribonuclease. The shift with Dex extracts was substantially higher than with rhGR alone, suggesting that it is produced by a GR-containing ribonuclease complex (Fig. 2A). The GR-mediated shift of MCP-1 mRNA was concentration-dependent and generated more and higher shifted bands at higher concentrations, suggesting GR multimerization, mRNA multimerization, or the recruitment of additional molecules (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2rhGR binds to MCP-1 mRNA. In vitro transcribed hMCP-1 (1–739 nucleotides) mRNA was incubated with 7.35 nm rhGR or with Dex extract for 5 min (A); incubated with increasing amounts of rhGR for 30 min (B); incubated with 7.35 nm rhGR, 73 nm RU486, or both for 30 min (C); incubated with rhGR or rhER alone or in the presence of various antibodies (Ab) to GR or ER (D); or incubated with Dex extract alone or in the presence of various antibodies to GR for 5 min (E). All samples were analyzed on 4% native polyacrylamide gels. All experiments were performed three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RU486, by itself, did not interfere with the binding of the GR to MCP-1 mRNA (Fig. 2C). In addition, Dex alone did not interfere with the gel shift (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction between GR and MCP-1 mRNA did not involve the steroid binding domain of GR. The interaction between GR and MCP-1 mRNA was seen with multiple lots of rhGR from two different sources (Sigma and Panvera). To further establish that the shift was not due to a non-GR contaminant, supershifts were performed with five different antibodies to GR generated against amino acids 245–259 (Ab1 and Ab5), 395–411 (Ab2), carboxyl terminus (Ab3), and 121–421 (Ab4). Supershifts were observed with all GR antibodies (Fig. 2D). No supershift was observed with antibody to the ER, another member of the steroid receptor family. Of note, a supershift was also seen when Dex extracts were incubated with antibodies to the GR for 5 min (Fig. 2E). This supershift was not seen after a 30-min incubation (Fig. 1D), suggesting that in the presence of antibody to GR, the high molecular weight complex is not stable. It is of interest that different antibodies produced different shifts, both with rhGR and with Dex extracts. This may be due to differences in valence (information not available from the manufacturers) or differences in protein configuration on the non-denaturing gels.Specificity of the MCP-1 mRNA-GR Interaction—To examine whether the MCP-1 RNA-GR interaction exhibits hormone receptor specificity, human and rat MCP-1 mRNA were incubated with other members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily, including the ER, MCR, and RAR. Only rhGR produced a shift with MCP-1 mRNA (Fig. 3A). This result is consistent with our previous findings in SMC culture and in gel shifts showing that the inhibition of MCP-1 mRNA accumulation was glucocorticoid-specific (24Poon M. Megyesi J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6471-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A similar shift was seen when rhGR was incubated with full-length rat JE (Fig. 3B) and a 1–224-nucleotide fragment from the 5′ end of the JE mRNA (Fig. 3C), which we have previously identified as the minimum region required to maintain Dex sensitivity (26Poon M. Liu B. Taubman M.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6471-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Analysis of the MCP-1-GR interaction, hormone specificity. In vitro transcribed full-length hMCP-1 (A), rat full-length JE (B), or a 1–224-nucleotide fragment (J1′tl) from the 5′ end of the JE mRNA (C) were incubated with 7.35 nm rhGR, ER, MCR, or RAR for 30 min and then analyzed on 4% native polyacrylamide gels.

Liu B. Taubman M.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6471-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This suggested that Dex treatment caused a critical modification that either increased the activity or allowed for the formation of a stable degradative complex. The above data suggest that this complex includes the GR. We therefore sought to determine whether exogenous rhGR would be able to compete with this putative endogenous active degradative complex. As shown in Fig. 5, the addition of rhGR to extracts from Dex-treated SMC blocked the ability of the extracts to degrade MCP-1 mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, the addition of exogenous rhER had no effect. These results suggest that rhGR may act as a competitive inhibitor of a GR-containing degradative complex.FIGURE 5Inhibition of Dex-mediated MCP-1 mRNA degradation by exogenous rhGR. In vitro transcribed hMCP-1 mRNA was incubated with extracts (ext) from untreated (control) or Dex-treated SMC for 30 min in the presence of increasing amounts (1 μl = 7.34 nm final concentration) of exogenous rhGR or rhER.

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms involved in WASP phosphorylation and the resulting sealing ring formation in osteoclasts. The phosphorylation state of WASP and WASP-interacting proteins was determined in osteoclasts treated with osteopontin or expressing either constitutively active or kinase-defective Src by adenovirus-mediated delivery. In vitro kinase analysis of WASP immunoprecipitates exhibited phosphorylation of c-Src, PYK2, WASP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-PEST, and Pro-Ser-Thr phosphatase-interacting protein (PSTPIP). Phosphorylation of these proteins was increased in osteopontin-treated and constitutively active Src-expressing osteoclasts. Pulldown analysis with glutathione S-transferase-fused proline-rich regions of PTP-PEST revealed coprecipitation of WASP, PYK2, c-Src, and PSTPIP proteins with the N-terminal region (amino acids 294-497) of PTP-PEST. Similarly, interaction of the same signaling proteins, as well as PTP-PEST, was observed with glutathione S-transferase-fused proline-rich regions of WASP. Furthermore, osteopontin stimulation or constitutively active Src expression resulted in serine phosphorylation and inhibition of WASP-associated PTP-PEST. The inhibition of PTP-PEST was accompanied by an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of WASP and other associated signaling proteins. Experiments with an inhibitor to phosphatase and small interference RNA to PTP-PEST confirmed the involvement of PTP-PEST in sealing ring formation and bone resorption. WASP, which is identified in the sealing ring of resorbing osteoclasts, also demonstrates colocalization with c-Src, PYK2, PSTPIP, and PTP-PEST in immunostaining analyses. Our findings suggest that both tyrosine kinase(s) and the tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST coordinate the formation of the sealing ring and thus the bone-resorbing function of osteoclasts.

Furthermore, osteopontin stimulation or constitutively active Src expression resulted in serine phosphorylation and inhibition of WASP-associated PTP-PEST. The inhibition of PTP-PEST was accompanied by an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of WASP and other associated signaling proteins. Experiments with an inhibitor to phosphatase and small interference RNA to PTP-PEST confirmed the involvement of PTP-PEST in sealing ring formation and bone resorption. WASP, which is identified in the sealing ring of resorbing osteoclasts, also demonstrates colocalization with c-Src, PYK2, PSTPIP, and PTP-PEST in immunostaining analyses. Our findings suggest that both tyrosine kinase(s) and the tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST coordinate the formation of the sealing ring and thus the bone-resorbing function of osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are terminally differentiated, multinucleated, and highly motile cells responsible for bone resorption. The adhesion of osteoclasts to bone leads to the formation of the osteoclast clear zone, an actin-rich ring-like adhesion zone (sealing ring) circumscribing an area of bone resorption. Sealing ring formation has been considered to be a marker of osteoclast activation for bone resorption (1Teti A. Marchisio P.C. Zambonin-Zallone A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C1-C7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vaananen H.K. Horton M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2729-2732PubMed Google Scholar). Bone resorption is mediated by the dynamics of an actin cytoskeleton ring. Distinct pathways and signaling molecules (c-Src, PYK2, c-Cbl, p130 Cas, leupaxin, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) have been described to play roles in the organization of the sealing ring during bone resorption (3Schwartzberg P.L.

Despite success in identifying the role of these kinases in osteoclast sealing ring formation in the clear zone of resorbing osteoclasts, the potential target protein of these kinases involved in the sealing ring formation is poorly understood.

Expression of WASP restores normal cytoarchitecture in these osteoclasts. More recently, we have demonstrated that sealing ring formation and bone resorption are enhanced by interaction of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) and Cdc42 with the WASP (12Chellaiah M.A. J.

Efficient phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of WASP at amino acid Tyr-291 within the GTPase binding domain (GBD) of WASP are both reliant on binding of Cdc42 (24Torres E. Rosen M.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1215-1227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) or PIP2 (12Chellaiah M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32930-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with WASP. Phosphorylated GBD is able to bind SH2-containing tyrosine kinases (e.g. c-Src), thus destabilizing the inhibitory GBD-C-terminal VCA interaction and promoting Arp2/3 binding and actin polymerization (25Caron E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the ability of SH2 domains to bind and activate WASP could also have several functional implications. Phosphorylation of WASP increases the affinity of the C-terminal VCA domain of WASP for the Arp2/3 complex and is required for actin polymerization (21Cory G.O.C. Cramer R. Blanchoin L. Ridley A.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1229-1239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-PEST was also shown to interact with WASP (26Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Quan C. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PTP-PEST contains the typical tyrosine phosphatase catalytic domain flanked by proline-rich regions. These regions are capable of interacting with several signaling molecules, including paxillin, leupaxin, PYK2, p130 Cas, and Grb2 (10Gupta A. Lee B.S. Khadeer M.A. Tang Z. Chellaiah M. Abu-Amer Y.

Spencer S. Quan C. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)). PSTPIP functions as a scaffold protein between PTP-PEST and WASP (20Badour K. Zhang J. Shi F. Leng Y. Collins M. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It has a role in the regulation of cortical cytoskeleton reorganization via its SH3-mediated interactions with WASP (31Wu Y. Dowbenko D. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30487-30496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, this interaction allows PTP-PEST to dephosphorylate WASP (32Cote J.F. Chung P.L. Theberge J.F. Halle M. Spencer S. Lasky L.A. Tremblay M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2973-2986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although Fyn enhanced WASP-mediated Arp2/3 activation and was required for synapse formation, PTP-PEST combined with PSTPIP inhibited WASP-driven actin polymerization and synapse formation (20Badour K. Zhang J. Shi F. Leng Y. Collins M. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Mutation of the tyrosine residue (TyrΔAsp) that is present in the SH3 domain of the polyproline region of PSTPIP resulted in a loss of WASP binding in vitro and dissolution of colocalization in vivo (32Cote J.F.

By regulating the tyrosine phosphorylation state of PSTPIP, PTP-PEST plays a key role in dephosphorylation of signaling proteins, such as p130 Cas and paxillin (33Angers-Loustau A. Côté J.-F.

WASP is a binding partner for the c-Src SH3 domain (34Schulte R.J. Sefton B.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9424-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated the role of PIP2 and Cdc42 in the WASP-mediated sealing ring organization in response to integrin αvβ3 signaling (12Chellaiah M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32930-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which signaling molecules regulate sealing ring formation in a complex spatial and temporal manner is unknown. It is important to identify the interaction between potential kinases/phosphatase(s) and WASP in the regulation of sealing ring formation during bone resorption. It is likely that interaction of phosphatase with WASP, in addition to its role in regulating the phosphorylation status of signaling proteins associated with WASP, may have a regulatory role in the stability of the sealing ring during bone resorption. A decrease or failure of sealing ring formation, in a number of conditions, is correlated to failure of osteoclast adhesion or proper signaling pathway mediated by the integrin αvβ3 (35McHugh K.P. Hodivala-Dilke K. Zheng M.-H. Namba N. Lam J. Novack D. Feng X. Ross F.P. Hynes R.O. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 36Feng X.

Silva M. Alvarez U. Kwiatkowski D. Hruska K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 665-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We have sought to further characterize the mechanism(s) by which the WASP-Arp2/3 complex becomes stabilized to localize to the sealing ring during the process of bone resorption by osteoclasts. Identification of mechanism(s) linking sealing ring formation and bone resorption will elucidate the distinctive properties of WASP and the associated signaling complex. Therefore, our aim in this study was to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of WASP, and to decipher possible signaling pathways that control sealing ring formation and bone resorption in osteoclasts. This study shows that osteoclasts treated with OPN or transfected with constitutively active Src (CA-Src) exhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins, including PYK2, PTP-PEST, WASP, c-Src, and PSTPIP. Serine phosphorylation of proteins with molecular mass of 160-170 and 80-85 kDa was also observed. Basal level phosphorylation of these proteins was observed in control or kinase-defective Src (KD-Src)-transfected osteoclasts. The presence of PSTPIP in the WASP immunoprecipitates suggests that it may serve as a linker protein in the interaction of PTP-PEST with WASP. Serine phosphorylation of PTP-PEST in response to CA-Src expression and OPN stimulation suggests that PTP-PEST may have a regulatory role in the tyrosine phosphorylation state of proteins associated with WASP. An increase in phosphorylation of WASP and the associated signaling proteins enhanced the bone resorption function of osteoclasts through sealing ring formation. Small interference RNA (siRNA) to PTP-PEST or WASP (12Chellaiah M.A. J. Biol.

Reagents—Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for immunoblotting, rainbow molecular weight marker, and [32P]orthophosphate were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. GAPDH antibody was obtained from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Protein estimation reagent, molecular weight standards for proteins, and PAGE reagents were bought from Bio-Rad. Cy2- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Antibodies to WASP, Arp2, and Arp3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, (Santa Cruz, CA). Actin polymerization kit and purified Arp2/3, G-actin, and pyrene-labeled G-actin were bought from Cytoskeleton, Inc. (Denver CO). Antibody to Src and recombinant Src protein (marker for kinase assay) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Rhodamine phalloidin, phenyl arsine oxide, and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Preparation of Osteoclast Precursors from Mice—C57/BL6 mice were used for osteoclast preparation. These mice were either purchased from Harlan Laboratory or generated in the animal house of the University of Maryland Dental School. Breeding and maintenance were carried out as per the guidelines and approval of IACUC. Osteoclasts were generated in vitro using mouse bone marrow cells. Cells isolated from five mice were cultured into 100-mm dishes with 20 ml of α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (α-10). After culturing for 24 h, nonadhered cells were layered on Histopaque®-1077 (Sigma) and centrifuged at 350 × g for 15 min at room temperature. The cell layer between the Histopaque and the medium was removed and washed with α-10 medium at 2000 rpm for 7 min at room temperature. Cells were resuspended in α-10 medium and cultured with the appropriate concentrations of mCSF-1 (10 ng/ml) and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (55-75 ng/ml). After 3 days in culture, media were replaced with fresh cytokines. The multinucleated osteoclasts were seen from day 4 onward. Small Interfering RNA for PTP-PEST—Two different siRNA sequences were purchased from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). The first 1 and 2 sequences target to 5′-ggaagaaauacuacagccatt-3′ and 5′-uggcuguaguauuucuucctt-3′ (siRNA ID 68984), and the second targets to 5′-ggguguguaugggccaaaatt-3′ and 5′uuuuggcccauacacaccctt3′ (siRNA ID 68890). PTP-PEST levels were reduced to a greater extent by siRNA ID 68984 than by siRNA ID 68890. Hence, we used siRNA ID 68984 to reduce endogenous PTP-PEST levels in osteoclasts. Negative control RNAi (cRNAi) for PTP-PEST sequences and siRNA for GAPDH or β-actin were purchased from Ambion. Negative control RNAi sequences (cRNAi) for PTP-PEST siRNA sequences consisting of a scrambled sequence, which does not have specificity to any known cellular mRNAs, was used. Silencer positive control siRNA for GAPDH or β-actin was used to optimize siRNA experiments. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transfect osteoclasts. Because the silencing was only 50% with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) reagent, we used the permeabilization technique with streptolysin O to deliver the siRNA into osteoclasts, as described previously (12Chellaiah M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32930-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 38Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Alvarez U. Hruska K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11908-11916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts were washed twice with permeabilization buffer (120 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm MgCl2). Freshly prepared dithiothreitol (5 mm), ATP (1 mm), streptolysin O (0.5 units/ml), and siRNA (0.5, 1, and 2 μm) or cRNAi (2 μm) were added to the buffer at the time of permeabilization. Cells were incubated with the above-mentioned solution for 2-3 min, and resealing was achieved by the addition of α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Incubation was continued for 48 h. Control cells were permeabilized as above in the absence of siRNA. After 36-48 h, lysates were made and subjected to immunoblotting with an antibody to PTP-PEST. Preparation of Osteoclast Lysate after Various Treatments—Constitutively active (CA)-Src and kinase-defective (KD)-Src that were generated essentially based on pAdEasy-1 system (39He T.C.

CA-Src contains only the Y527F point mutation to prevent tail binding to the SH2 domain, and KD-Src contains two point mutations, K297R to prevent ATP transfer and Y527F to prevent tail binding to the SH2 domain. Virus was propagated as described previously (40Willey C.D. Balasubramanian S. Rodriguez Rosas M.C. Ross R.S. Kuppuswamy D. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Adenovirus was added to osteoclasts at the 10-30 multiplicity of infection in the serum-free medium. Two hours after adenoviral infections, the medium was replaced with α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (α-10). Expression of Src was evaluated by immunoblotting of the osteoclast lysate with a c-Src antibody. Expression was maximal at 36-48 h. Osteoclasts treated with PBS were used as controls. Some cultures were treated with OPN (25 μg/ml for 30-45 min), phenylarsine oxide (PAO, 100 nm for 45 min), and PAO/OPN at 37 °C. Following various treatments, osteoclasts were washed three times with cold PBS and lysed in a Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.05, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, 5 mm ZnCl2, 1% aprotinin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were rocked on ice for 15 min and scraped off with a cell scraper. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was saved as a Triton-soluble fraction. The pellet was resuspended in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% aprotinin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant is the Triton-insoluble fraction. Protein contents were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Purification of GST-fused WASP and PTP-PEST Proteins—Full-length (FL) WASP, GTPase binding domain and Proline-rich (GP) domain of WASP (41Hufner K. Schell B. Aepfelbacher M. Linder S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and proline-rich (N- and C-terminal) regions of PTP-PEST (27Shen Y. Lyons P. Cooley M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Salgia R.

Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions as described previously (42Chellaiah M.A. Biswas R.S. Yuen D. Alvarez U.M. Hruska K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47434-47444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining tested the purity of the purified proteins. Immunoprecipitation and Western Analysis—Equal amounts of lysate proteins were precleared with protein A-Sepharose, pre-soaked in lysis buffer containing bovine serum albumin and with nonimmune IgG coupled to Sepharose. The precleared supernatants were incubated with antibodies of interest, and the immune complexes were adsorbed onto protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were pelleted and washed three times for 5 min each with ice-cold PBS. Pulldown with GST-fused WASP proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose was also performed to determine that the proteins had the capacity to bind FL-WASP and WASP-GP region as described previously (42Chellaiah M.A. Biswas R.S. Yuen D. Alvarez U.M. Hruska K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47434-47444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The immune complexes were then eluted in electrophoresis sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blot analyses. To investigate the involvement of GP domain of WASP in the interaction of PSTPIP in osteoclasts, about 500 μg of protein was used for GST pulldown or immunoprecipitation with a WASP antibody. Immunoprecipitates or pulldown proteins were divided into two parts. The first part was immunoblotted with a phosphotyrosine antibody. This blot was stripped and immunoblotted with a GST antibody or WASP antibody. The second part was immunoblotted with a PSTPIP antibody. Immunoblotting was performed as described below. Blots were blocked with 10% milk in PBS containing 0.5% Tween (PBS-T) for 2-3 h and then incubated with 1:100 dilution of primary antibody of interest for 2-3 h. After three washes for 10 min each with PBS-T, the blot was incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated species-specific respective secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes for 10 min each with PBS-T, protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL kit (Pierce). Immune Complex Kinase Assay Analysis—Equal amounts of protein lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-WASP antibody or pulldown with GST-fused PTP-PEST proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose. About 50 μg of whole cell lysate and about 300 μg of lysate protein was used for GST-pulldown analysis. The immune complexes collected by the addition of protein A-Sepharose were used for immunoblotting analysis or kinase assay. For kinase assay, the Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed sequentially, three times each with the following buffers: lysis buffer, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 m LiCl; finally with a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4. The beads were resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP either in the presence or absence of casein (1 mg/ml) as an exogenous substrate. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer (43Lammelli V.P. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The samples were boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat film.

https://openalex.org/W2070157035,"The type I, 55-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) is released from cells to the extracellular space where it can bind and modulate TNF bioactivity. Extracellular TNFR1 release occurs by two distinct pathways: the inducible proteolytic cleavage of TNFR1 ectodomains and the constitutive release of full-length TNFR1 in exosome-like vesicles. Regulation of both TNFR1 release pathways appears to involve the trafficking of cytoplasmic TNFR1 vesicles. Vesicular trafficking is controlled by ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), which are active in the GTP-bound state and inactive when bound to GDP. ARF activation is enhanced by guanine nucleotide-exchange factors that catalyze replacement of GDP by GTP. We investigated whether the brefeldin A (BFA)-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins, BIG1 and/or BIG2, are required for TNFR1 release from human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Effects of specific RNA interference (RNAi) showed that BIG2, but not BIG1, regulated the release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles, whereas neither BIG2 nor BIG1 was required for the IL-1β-induced proteolytic cleavage of TNFR1 ectodomains. BIG2 co-localized with TNFR1 in diffusely distributed cytoplasmic vesicles, and the association between BIG2 and TNFR1 was disrupted by BFA. Consistent with the preferential activation of class I ARFs by BIG2, ARF1 and ARF3 participated in the extracellular release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles in a nonredundant and additive fashion. We conclude that the association between BIG2 and TNFR1 selectively regulates the extracellular release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles from human vascular endothelial cells via an ARF1- and ARF3-dependent mechanism.

TNF signals through the type I 55-kDa (TNFR1, TNFRSF1A, CD120a) and type II 75-kDa (TNFR2, TNFRSF1B, CD120b) TNF receptors (1Chen G. Goeddel D.V.

TNFR1, which contains death domains in its intracytoplasmic tail, is considered the major receptor for TNF signaling (3Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P.

Release of TNFR1 to the extracellular space is mediated by two distinct mechanisms. The first involves the proteolytic cleavage of TNFR1 ectodomains by a receptor sheddase that results in the shedding of soluble TNFR1 ectodomains (5Engelmann H. Aderka D. Rubinstein M. Rotman D.

TACE was identified as a TNFR1 sheddase because TACE-deficient cells had lower ratios of shed to cell surface TNFR1 than did TACE-reconstituted cells (12Reddy P. Slack J.L. Davis R. Cerretti D.P.

Proteolytic cleavage and shedding of soluble TNFR1 can be induced by diverse stimuli, such as phorbol ester, interleukin-1β, and proteasome inhibitors (13Lantz M. Gullberg U. Nilsson E. Olsson I. J.

The second mechanism is the constitutive release of full-length TNFR1 from cells within membranes of exosome-like vesicles (16Hawari F.I. Rouhani F.N. Cui X. Yu Z.X. Buckley C. Kaler M. Levine S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Exosomes are small membrane-enclosed vesicles, 30–200 nm in diameter, that correspond to the internal vesicles of endolysosome-related multivesicular bodies and are released via exocytic fusion with the plasma membrane (17Denzer K.

TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles were initially identified in conditioned medium from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which contained 20–50-nm exosome-like vesicles that were pelleted by high speed centrifugation, sedimented to a density of 1.1 g/ml, and were capable of binding TNF (16Hawari F.I.

Recent investigations have identified previously unrecognized pathways for regulation of TNFR1 release from cells to the extracellular space. For example, histamine has been reported to induce redistribution of TNFR1 to the cell surface from an intracellular storage pool, such as the Golgi system, which served as a source of proteolytically cleaved receptors (21Wang J. Al-Lamki R.S. Zhang H. Kirkiles-Smith N. Gaeta M.L. Thiru S. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21751-21760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We showed that calcium-dependent formation of a complex comprising ARTS-1 (aminopeptidase regulator of TNF receptor shedding), a type II integral membrane aminopeptidase, and NUCB2 (nucleobindin 2), a putative DNA- and calcium-binding protein, associates with cytoplasmic TNFR1 prior to the commitment of TNFR1 to pathways that result in either the constitutive release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles or the inducible proteolytic cleavage of TNFR1 ectodomains (22Cui X.

Taken together, these findings suggested the probable involvement of intracytoplasmic vesicular trafficking between ERGolgi and cell surface plasma membranes in these processes. Initiation of vesicle formation from a donor membrane (e.g. Golgi) requires activation of a 20-kDa ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) by interaction with a guanine-nucleotide exchange protein (GEP) that accelerates release of GDP and thereby GTP binding (24Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Accumulation of ARF-GTP and coatomer (plus other proteins) leads to membrane deformation or budding. A vesicle, released by sealing off the bud at its base, is translocated to and fuses with a target membrane. Vesicular transport from the Golgi or trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane in mammalian cells is known to involve the class I ARFs 1 and 3, which are activated by the brefeldin A-inhibited ARF-GEPs, BIG1 and BIG2 (25Togawa A.

The experiments reported here demonstrate that BIG2, but not BIG1, was required for the constitutive release of full-length TNFR1 in exosome-like vesicles from human vascular endothelial cells. Cells and Reagents—HUVEC (passages 3 and 8) and EGM-2 medium were purchased from Cambrex BioScience (Walkersville, MD). Recombinant human IL-1β wasfromR&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and brefeldin A (BFA) was from MP Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). Antibodies—Chicken polyclonal anti-NUCB2 antibodies were generated against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein with sequence corresponding to amino acids 326–420 of the NUCB2 C-terminal leucine zipper domain (Sigma Genosys) (23Islam A.

Murine IgG2b monoclonal (H5) and goat polyclonal (C20) antibodies that reacted with TNFR1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), as were antibodies against β-tubulin (D10). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ARTS-1, BIG1, and BIG2 were used as previously described (27Shen X. Xu K.F. Fan Q. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2635-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Specific murine monoclonal antibodies reactive with human ARF1, ARF3, ARF5, and ARF6, respectively, were from Stressgen Bioreagents (Victoria, Canada), BD Biosciences (Palo Alto, CA), Abnova Corp. (Taipei, Taiwan), and Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). RNA Interference and Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Individual siGENOME RNA duplexes for BIG1 and BIG2, siGENOME SMARTpool RNA duplexes for ARF1, ARF3, ARF5, and ARF6, as well as siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA 1 were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). HUVEC were transfected with siRNA (50–100 nm) using DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon) for 3 days. RNA was isolated with an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and cDNA templates were prepared with a ProSTAR Ultra-HF RT-PCR system (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). Sequences of RT-PCR primers are listed in supplemental Table S1. Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed using the iCycler iQ thermocycler, iQ SYBR green PCR supermix, and iCycler iQ data analysis software (Bio-Rad). BIG2, ARF1, and ARF3 Expression Plasmids—Mammalian expression plasmids encoding full-length human BIG2, ARF1, or ARF3 were purchased from Origene Technologies (Rockville, MD). The BIG2 cDNA clone contained 7 nucleotide substitutions that differed from the ARFGEF2 reference sequence (NCBI accession NM_006420). Among these putative polymorphisms, two represented silent mutations (C3663T, C4131T), while 5 represented nonsynonymous mutations (A619G, G620A, A2884G, A3145G, and A5287G) that resulted in 4 amino acid substitutions. The 5 nonsynonymous mutations were corrected by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange Multi Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All plasmids were sequence-verified. The T31N mutations were introduced using the Quik-Change Multi Site-directed Mutagenesis kit and the following primers; ARF1: 5′-CTGCAGGGAAGAACACGATCCTCTACAAG-3′ and ARF3: 5′-CGCAGGAACGAACACCATCCTATACAAG-3′. RNAi-resistant BIG2, ARF1, and ARF3 mutant plasmids, which contained synonymous mutations, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the following primers; BIG2: 5′-ATTTATGTCAATTATGATTGCGATTTAAATGCTGC-3′, ARF1: 5′-CAGCAATGACAGGGAACGAGTAAACGAGGCCCG-3′, and ARF3: 5′-CAGGAAAGACGACGATACTGTACAAGCTGAAACTGGGGG-3′. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. HUVEC, grown in 6-well plates, were transfected with plasmids using FuGENE 6, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). For co-transfection, individual siGENOME siRNA duplexes (Dharmacon) targeting BIG2 (5′-CAACUACGACUGUGAUUUA-3′) ARF1 (5′-ACAGAGAGCGUGUGAACGA-3′), or ARF3 (5′-GGAAAGACCACCAUCCUAU-3′) were transfected at a concentration of 100 nm using the DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent. Immunoblotting—HUVEC were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% n-octyl β-d -glucopyranoside, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 120 mm NaCl (Sigma), supplemented with Complete™ protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). For immunoblots of HUVEC-conditioned medium, cells were grown in medium that contained fetal bovine serum that had been depleted of exosomes by centrifugation at 175,000 × g at 4 °C for 16 h. Prior to immunoblotting, conditioned medium was cleared of cells and debris by sequential centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min, 500 × g for 10 min, 1,200 × g for 20 min, and 10,000 × g for 30 min. Immunoblots of cellular proteins (50 μg per lane) or medium (26 μl per lane) were performed as previously described, using NIH Image Software (version 1.63) for densitometry (23Islam A. Adamik B. Hawari F.I. Ma G. Rouhani F.N. Zhang J. Levine S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6860-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—HUVEC were lysed in buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 120 mm NaCl (Sigma) supplemented with Complete™ protease inhibitor. Samples (200 μg) of HUVEC lysates were incubated for 2 h with 8 μg of rabbit anti-BIG2 antibodies immobilized on 100 μl of protein A/G beads (Pierce) that had been blocked with 1% ovalbumin in PBS. Controls were protein A/G beads incubated with preimmune serum or without bound antibodies. Beads were washed six times with cold lysis buffer, and immunoblots were performed as previously described (23Islam A. Adamik B. Hawari F.I. Ma G. Rouhani F.N. Zhang J. Levine S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6860-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Proteins from HUVEC supernatants after immunoprecipitation were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—HUVEC grown on collagen I-coated slides (BD Biosciences) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS (5 min), washed three times with PBS, and blocked with PBS containing 10% donkey and 10% goat serum for 1 h. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 1% donkey and 1% goat serum, as follows: goat anti-TNFR1 (C20) polyclonal antibodies (2 μg/ml), rabbit polyclonal anti-BIG2 antibodies (diluted 1:500), and mouse monoclonal anti-p230 trans-Golgi antibody (1:200). After washing three times in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubation with species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 or Alexa Fluor® 568, (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, 1:200 dilution), cells were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and visualized using a Leica SP Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). Quantification of Extracellular TNFR1 by ELISA—HUVEC were transfected with siRNA for 3 days, and then fresh, exosome-depleted medium was added for 24 h. Medium cleared of cells and debris as described for immunoblotting was analyzed for TNFR1 using a Quantikine sandwich ELISA kit with a sensitivity of 7.8 pg/ml (R & D Systems). Statistical Analyses—Data were analyzed by a paired Student's t test with a Bonferoni correction for multiple comparisons or analysis of variance. A p value ≤0.05 was considered significant. BIG2 Regulates the Constitutive Release of TNFR1 Exosomelike Vesicles—The role of BIG1 and BIG2 in the constitutive release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles from HUVEC was assessed using RNA interference. Small interfering RNA duplexes (siRNA) specifically decreased levels of BIG1 and BIG2 mRNA and protein (Fig. 1, A and B), but did not alter the quantities of mRNA (data not shown) or protein (Fig. 1B) encoding NUCB2 or β-tubulin. As quantified by ELISA, TNFR1 constitutively released into the medium from cells transfected with siRNA targeting BIG2 was 63% less than that from cells transfected with control non-targeting siRNA (Fig. 1C). Similarly, Western blots showed that medium from cells transfected with siRNA targeting BIG2 contained 69% less 55-kDa TNFR1 than did medium from cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA (p = 0.017, n = 4) (Fig. 1D). A ∼40-kDa TNFR1 band was also seen, as has been previously described, which was similarly decreased (23Islam A. Adamik B. Hawari F.I. Ma G. Rouhani F.N. Zhang J. Levine S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6860-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, no effects of siRNA targeting BIG1 were found. Neither BIG1 nor BIG2 Affects the IL-1β-induced Proteolytic Cleavage of TNFR1 Ectodomains—In experiments performed to assess the role of BIG1 or BIG2 in the inducible proteolytic cleavage of TNFR1 ectodomains, transfection of HUVEC with siRNA targeting BIG1 or BIG2 did not reduce the quantity of TNFR1 released into medium following 2-h stimulation with IL-1β, as measured by ELISA (Fig. 2A) or Western blotting (Fig. 2B). The quantity of full-length 55-kDa TNFR1 released in exosome-like vesicles into medium in 2 h was below the limit of detection by Western blotting. Endogenous BIG2 Associated with TNFR1 in HUVEC—To determine whether the action of BIG2 in the constitutive release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles involved an association between the endogenous proteins, BIG2 was immunoprecipitated from HUVEC homogenates, and the full-length, 55-kDa TNFR1 was detected by immunoblotting, but neither ARTS-1 nor NUCB2 were present (Fig. 3A). The BIG2 antibodies immunoprecipitated 48% of BIG2, but only 16% of the TNFR1 was pulled-down (Fig. 3B), consistent with the association of a subpopulation of endogenous TNFR1 with BIG2. The association between BIG2 and TNFR1 in HUVEC was also characterized by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3C, TNFR1 and BIG2 were co-localized in diffusely distributed cytoplasmic vesicles. Although BIG2 had been described in the trans-Golgi network, neither BIG2 nor TNFR1 co-localized with the trans-Golgi marker, p230 (data not shown). Because BIG2 is a BFA-inhibited activator of ARF, we looked for a BFA effect on the association between endogenous BIG2 and TNFR1. As shown in Fig. 4, no full-length, 55-kDa TNFR1 was found among proteins immunoprecipitated by BIG2 antibodies from cells incubated for 15 min with BFA. This showed that the association between endogenous BIG2 and TNFR1 was disrupted by BFA. BIG2-dependent Release of TNFR1 Exosome-like Vesicles Involves ARF1 and ARF3 in a Nonredundant and Additive Fashion—BIG2 activates both ARF1 and ARF3 (25Togawa A. Morinaga N. Ogasawara M. Moss J.

Cell. 2004; 15: 5283-5294Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To assess the roles of individual ARFs in the constitutive release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles, ARF1, ARF3, ARF5, or ARF6 mRNA and protein were selectively depleted using RNA interference (Fig. 5, A and C), while neither TNFR1 nor β-tubulin mRNA (data not shown) and protein (Fig. 5C) were decreased. Treatment of HUVEC with siRNA targeting ARF1 or ARF3 decreased by 59 and 60%, respectively, the amount (quantified by ELISA) of TNFR1 released relative to that from cells treated with control, non-targeting siRNA (Fig. 5B). In contrast, siRNA-mediated depletion of ARF5 or ARF6 had no effect. Quantification of Western blots showed that the siRNA-mediated depletion of either ARF1 or ARF3 reduced the amount of constitutively released 55-kDa TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles into the culture medium by 67% (p = 0.008, n = 3) and 55% (p = 0.016, n = 3) respectively, from that released by cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA (Fig. 5C). We next assessed whether ARF1 and ARF3 function in an additive fashion to mediate the extracellular release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles. HUVEC transfected with siRNAs targeting both ARF1 and ARF3 showed specific depletion of both mRNAs (data not shown) and proteins (Fig. 5E), while β-tubulin mRNA (data not shown) and protein (Fig. 5E) were not decreased. As shown in Fig. 5D, the amount of TNFR1 constitutively released from cells transfected with siRNAs targeting both ARF1 and ARF3 was 82% less than that from cells transfected with control, non-targeting siRNA. The quantity of TNFR1 constitutively released into culture medium was also significantly less from cells transfected with siRNAs targeting both ARF1 and ARF3 than from cells treated with siRNAs individually targeting ARF1 or ARF3. Western blots (Fig. 5E) confirmed that the siRNA-mediated depletion of both ARF1 and ARF3 reduced the constitutive release of the 55-kDa TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles by 90% (p = 9.04 × 10–6, n = 3), from the level of cells treated with control, non-targeting siRNA. Similarly, Western blots (Fig. 5E) showed that the siRNA-mediated depletion of both ARF1 and ARF3 significantly reduced the constitutive release of the 55-kDa TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles as compared with cells treated with siRNAs individually targeting ARF1 or ARF3 (p = 0.00013, n = 3). To confirm that BIG2 activation of ARF1 and ARF3 mediates the release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles from HUVEC, cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either wild-type or guanine nucleotide exchange-defective (T31N) ARF1 or ARF3 mutants. The T31N mutants exhibit minimal GTP binding and are preferentially constrained to the GDP-bound inactive form (29Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Furman C. Short S.M. Subramanian R.R. Zetter B.R. Roberts T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7962-7969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Quantification of Western blots of cell lysates (Fig. 6A) showed levels of immunoreactive ARF1 and ARF3, respectively, 205% (p = 0.015, n = 3) and 174% (p = 0.043, n = 3) those of cells transfected with the empty (control) plasmid. These were associated with increases of 106% (p = 0.0009, n = 3) and 116% (p = 0.0008, n = 3), respectively, in the amounts of 55-kDa TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles that were constitutively released into the culture medium (Fig. 6, A and B). Similarly, quantification by ELISA (Fig. 6C) showed that overexpression of ARF1 or ARF3 was associated with respective increases of 86% (p < 10–9, n = 6) and 89% (p < 10–12, n = 6) in the amount of TNFR1 released into the culture medium. In contrast, overexpression of the ARF1(T31N) or ARF3(T31N) plasmids did not alter TNFR1 exosome-like vesicle release. Immunoprecipitations were next performed to assess the effect of the ARF1(T31N) and ARF3(T31N) mutants on the association between BIG2 and TNFR1. Consistent with the lack of a dominant-negative effect on the release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles, the mutants did not disrupt the association between BIG2 and TNFR1 (Fig. 6D). Although ARF1(T31N) and ARF3(T31N) mutants have previously been demonstrated to function as dominant-negative constructs, which occurs via sequestering of relevant ARF-GEPs (29Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this was not the case in our system where their behavior was consistent with a GDP-bound inactive form. Our findings are similar to a prior report investigating secretory vesicle formation in pituitary cells, which also found that ARF1(T31N) functioned as an inactive ARF, rather than as a dominant-negative mutant (31Chen Y.G. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5297-5300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This study hypothesized that the T31N mutant could not undergo a GTP-induced conformational change, which resulted in impaired membrane localization, so that the mutant was inaccessible to compete with proteins binding to the ARF effector domain (31Chen Y.G. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5297-5300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The reason why overexpression of ARF1(T31N) and ARF3(T31N) mutants did not produce a dominant-negative effect in our system is unclear. Our data suggest that a sufficient quantity of BIG2 was not sequestered by the ARF (T31N) mutants and therefore remained available to mediate the association between BIG2 and TNFR1, as well as the release of TNFR1 exosome-like vesicles. This interpretation is consistent with our finding that only a subset of BIG2 associates with TNFR1 in HUVEC. RNAi-resistant BIG2, ARF1, and ARF3 expression plasmids with 4 silent single base pair mutations in the region targeted by siRNA were used to confirm the specificity of the observed siRNA effects. BIG2, ARF1, and ARF3 proteins were detected in lysates from HUVEC co-transfected with siRNA and RNAi-resistant expression plasmids, whereas BIG2, ARF1, and ARF3 protein levels were markedly diminished in cells co-transfected with siRNA and plasmids expressing wild-type BIG2, ARF1, or ARF3 (Fig. 7, A–C). We next assessed if the effect of BIG2, ARF1, and ARF3 siRNAs on TNFR1 exosome-like vesicle release were specific and not caused by off-target effects. Medium from HUVEC co-transfected with the empty (control) plasmid and siRNA targeting BIG2, ARF1, or ARF3 contained significantly less TNFR1, quantified by ELISA, than those transfected with the empty (control) plasmid in the absence of siRNA (Fig. 7, D–F). Reductions in TNFR1 release by siRNAs targeting BIG2, ARF1, or ARF3 were rescued by co-transfection with RNAi-resistant, but not the wild-type, BIG2, ARF1, or ARF3 plasmids. Western blots confir"

PKA phosphorylates FXYD1 at serine 68 (S68), however, the effects of phosphorylation on Na/K ATPase activity are not fully characterized. The objectives of this study were to characterize Na/K ATPase currents in FXYD1 wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) adult mouse ventricular myocytes, and investigate the effects of FXYD1 on Na/K ATPase currents using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. A peptide representing the 19 C-terminal residues of FXYD1 (FXYD1(54-72)) was introduced into the interior of FXYD1 KO and WT myocytes through the patch pipette. K-sensitive Na/K ATPase currents were higher in KO myocytes (2.9+/-0.1 pA/pF; n=4) compared with WT (1.9+/-0.1 pA/pF; n=4). Unphosphorylated FXYD1(54-72), at a concentration of 4 microM, reduced the currents in WT (from 2.1+/-0.1 to 1.3+/-0.1 pA/pF; P<0.05, n=7) and KO (from 2.9+/-0.1 to 1.7+/-0.1 pA/pF; P<0.05, n=5), whereas, 1 microM of FXYD1(54-72) phosphorylated at S68 increased currents in WT (from 1.91+/-0.09 to 3.1+/-0.5 pA/pF; P<0.05, n=6) and KO (from 2.7+/-0.11 to 3.8+/-0.2 pA/pF; P<0.05, n=6) myocytes. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that S68 phosphorylated and unphosphorylated FXYD1(54-72) associates with Na/K ATPase alpha1 subunit. We conclude that unphosphorylated FXYD1 inhibits Na/K ATPase, whereas S68 phosphorylated FXYD1 stimulates Na/K ATPase to a level above that seen in the absence of FXYD1."
https://openalex.org/W2123793343,"IL-4 is overexpressed in liver grafts during severe recurrent hepatitis C and rejection. Hepatocyte apoptosis is involved in both these phenomena. We therefore examined the proapoptotic effect of IL-4 on HepG2 cells and human hepatocytes in vitro, together with the underlying mechanisms. We first measured IL-4 receptor expression, STAT6 activation by IL-4, and STAT6 inhibition by an anti-IL-4 antibody or by STAT6 siRNA transfection. We then focused on the pathways involved in IL-4-mediated apoptosis and the role of STAT6 activation in apoptosis initiation. The IL-4 receptor was expressed on both cell types, and STAT6 was activated by IL-4. Both anti-IL-4 and STAT-6 siRNA inhibited this activation. IL-4 induced apoptosis of both HepG2 cells (P=0.008 vs. untreated control) and human hepatocytes (P<0.001 vs. untreated control). IL-4 reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential, activated Bid and Bax, and augmented caspase 3, 8, and 9 activity. STAT6 blockade inhibited IL-4-induced apoptosis. Expression of Fas and Fas ligand was unaffected when HepG2 cells and hepatocytes were cultured with IL-4, and Fas/FasL pathway blockade failed to inhibit IL-4-induced apoptosis. These results show that IL-4 induces apoptosis of human hepatocytes through IL-4 receptor binding, STAT6 activation, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased caspase activation, independently of the Fas pathway. IL-4 might thus contribute to the progression of severe liver graft damage."

The CO oxidation mechanism proposed on the basis of several CODHIICh crystal structures involved the apical binding of CO at the nickel ion and the activation of water at the Fe1 ion of the cluster. To understand how CO interacts with the active site, we have studied the reactivity of the cluster with potassium cyanide and analyzed the resulting type of nickel coordination by x-ray absorption spectroscopy.

The oxidation of CO is catalyzed by two Ni-Fe CO dehydrogenases, designated CODHICh and CODHIICh, according to the equation CO + H2O → CO2 + 2H+ + 2e-. Crystal structures of CODHIICh in different functional states have been solved to 1.1 Å resolution (3Dobbek H. Svetlitchnyi V. Gremer L. Huber R. Meyer O.

The homodimeric enzyme contains five metal clusters, of which clusters B, B′, and a subunit-bridging cluster D are conventional cubane-type [4Fe-4S] clusters (3Dobbek H. Svetlitchnyi V. Gremer L.

The active site clusters C and C′ in dithionite-reduced active CODHIICh (CO oxidation activity ∼14,000 μmol of CO oxidized min-1 mg-1 at 70 °C) have been modeled as [Ni-4Fe-5S] centers containing a Ni-(μ2S)-Fe1 subsite. Their integral nickel ion is coordinated by 4S ligands with square-planar geometry (3Dobbek H. Svetlitchnyi V. Gremer L. Huber R. Meyer O.

Ragsdale S.W. Cramer S.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9029-9035Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A defined non-functional [Ni-4Fe-4S] form of cluster C can be produced by treatment of CODHIICh with CO in the absence of low potential reductants, resulting in inactivation and the loss of the bridging μ2S (4Dobbek H. Svetlitchnyi V. Liss J. Meyer O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5382-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It has been assumed that CODHIICh catalyzes the oxidation of CO at the Ni-(μ2S)-Fe1 subsite of cluster C (3Dobbek H. Svetlitchnyi V. Gremer L. Huber R. Meyer O. Science. 2001; 293: 1281-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The prime candidate for CO binding is the nickel ion because of its facile accessibility through the substrate channel and its empty apical coordination site (3Dobbek H. Svetlitchnyi V. Gremer L. Huber R. Meyer O. Science. 2001; 293: 1281-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Fe1 is the presumed OH- donor ligand in CO2 formation (3Dobbek H. Svetlitchnyi V. Gremer L. Huber R.

The CODHOc from the aerobic bacterium Oligotropha carboxidovorans oxidizes CO at the Mo-(μ2S)-Cu subsite of the [Cu-S-MoO2] active site, in which copper and molybdenum are bridged by a cyanolyzable sulfane μ2S (7Dobbek H.

Inorg. Chem. 2005; 10: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Mo-(μ2S)-Cu subsite resembles the Ni-(μ2S)-Fe1 bridge in cluster C of CODHIICh. The mechanism of CO oxidation based on the x-ray structure of [Cu-S-MoO2] CODHOc with bound inhibitor n-butyl isocyanide involves a thiocarbonate-like intermediate state and proposes the binding of CO between the μ2S and copper (equivalent to nickel in CODHIICh) and the binding of an OH- group at molybdenum (equivalent to Fe1 in CODHIICh) (7Dobbek H.

Since sodium sulfide was found to inhibit CODHRr and CODHMt, it has been concluded that cluster C with the bridging μ2S, as has been observed in CODHIICh from C. hydrogenoformans (3Dobbek H. Svetlitchnyi V. Gremer L. Huber R. Meyer O. Science. 2001; 293: 1281-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 4Dobbek H. Svetlitchnyi V. Liss J. Meyer O. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 2004; 126: 9094-9100Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown that the [Ni-4Fe-4S] cluster missing the bridging μ2S is an inactivated decomposition product originating from the [Ni-4Fe-5S] cluster (4Dobbek H. Svetlitchnyi V. Liss J. Meyer O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5382-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A catalytic mechanism suggesting the apical binding of CO at nickel and the coordination of OH- in the bridging position between the nickel and Fe1 ions was proposed for CODHRr and CODHMt (13Feng J. Lindahl P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 9094-9100Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Ragsdale S.W. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

To clarify some of these aspects and get further insights into the mechanism of CO oxidation, we were interested to study how CO interacts with cluster C of CODHIICh and how the bridging μ2S might be involved in catalysis. Although some crystal structures have modeled apical CO at the nickel ion, the occupancies of CO were very low in CODHMt (12Darnault C. Volbeda A. Kim E.J. Legrand P. Vernede X. Lindahl P.A. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), or the potential CO was observed in the non-functional [Ni-4Fe-4S] cluster C of CODHIICh (4Dobbek H. Svetlitchnyi V. Liss J. Meyer O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5382-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We could not identify a CO ligand in the functional cluster C of CODHIICh, which can be ascribed to the high turnover rate of CO oxidation (4,000 s-1 at 23 °C) (2Svetlitchnyi V. Peschel C. Acker G. Meyer O. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5134-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 4Dobbek H. Svetlitchnyi V. Liss J. Meyer O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5382-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have focused on the reactivity of CODHIICh with potassium cyanide. CO and the cyanide ion show similar reactivities because they are isosteric and isoelectronic, display a similar σ-donor and π-acceptor ligand character, and share the presence of a non-bonding pair of electrons in the sp-hybridized orbital of the terminal carbon atom. Cyanide has a similar size as CO, allowing its passage through the substrate channel of CODHIICh (3Dobbek H. Svetlitchnyi V. Gremer L. Huber R. Meyer O. Science. 2001; 293: 1281-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), and inhibits the oxidation of CO by Ni-Fe CODHs and [Cu-S-MoO2] CODHOc (9Resch M. Dobbek H. Meyer O. J. Biol. Inorg.

The inhibition of Ni-Fe CODHs has been attributed to the binding of cyanide to the nickel ion of cluster C in CODHRr (17Ensign S.A. Hyman M.R. Ludden P.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4973-4979Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or to the Fe1 ion (ferrous component II) of cluster C in CODHRr and CODHMt (20Hu Z. Spangler N.J. Anderson M.E. Xia J. Ludden P.W. Lindahl P.A. Münck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 830-845Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has been established that the inhibition of [Cu-S-MoO2] CODHOc is due to the removal of the copper ion as copper cyanide and the sulfane μ2S as thiocyanate, resulting in the formation of a [MoO3] center, which is catalytically inactive (7Dobbek H. Gremer L. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Meyer O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15971-15976Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 9Resch M. Dobbek H. Meyer O. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2005; 10: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have studied the reactivity of CODHIICh with potassium cyanide and the nickel coordination derived from XAS. We show that cyanide behaves as a competitive inhibitor of CODHIICh with respect to the substrate CO and apparently interacts with cluster C in a similar fashion. It inhibits reduced CODHIICh reversibly and forms a nickel cyanide in the equatorial plane. Thereby one of the four square-planar sulfur ligands of nickel, apparently the labile μ2S, is replaced but remains bound to Fe1. Reactivation cleaves the nickel cyanide and results in square-planar 4S-coordination of nickel and reformation of the Ni-(μ2S)-Fe1 bridge. The results are summarized in a model of CO oxidation at cluster C of CODHIICh from C. hydrogenoformans. All experiments were done under strictly anoxic conditions because of the oxygen sensitivity of CODHIICh (2Svetlitchnyi V. Peschel C. Acker G. Meyer O. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5134-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Purification and Assay of CODHIICh—Growth of C. hydrogenoformans Z-2901 (DSM 6008) on CO and purification of CODHIICh were carried out as detailed (2Svetlitchnyi V. Peschel C. Acker G. Meyer O. J.

CO oxidation activity of CODHIICh was assayed at 70 °C by following the CO-dependent reduction of oxidized methyl viologen employing an ϵ578 of 9.7 mm-1 cm-1 as described (2Svetlitchnyi V. Peschel C. Acker G. Meyer O. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5134-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). For the assays, 1-ml volumes of reaction mixture composed of anoxic 50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 8.0) (buffer A) with 20 mm methyl viologen and 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) were flushed with CO in screw-capped cuvettes sealed with a rubber septum. Reactions were initiated by injecting 10 μl of diluted enzyme solution. One unit of CO oxidation activity is defined as 1 μmol of CO oxidized/min. Protein estimation employed conventional methods with bovine serum albumin as a standard (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Purified as isolated CODHIICh displayed a CO oxidation activity of 14,800 units mg-1 of protein and had a protein concentration of 8.8 mg ml-1. Inhibition of CODHIICh by Potassium Cyanide under Turnover Conditions—Potassium cyanide (KCN) stock solutions were prepared in anoxic 10 mm aqueous NaOH under N2. KCN was added to the cuvettes for the assay of CO oxidation activity prior to the addition of CODHIICh. The different CO concentrations for kinetic measurements were established by adding the appropriate amounts of CO-saturated reaction mixture to N2-saturated reaction mixture. At 70 °C and 1 atm pressure, the CO concentration in CO-saturated reaction mixtures was taken to be 645 μm (23Lax E. D'Ans-Lax: Taschenbuch für Chemiker und Physiker.Vol. 1. Springer, Berlin, Germany1967: I-1025Google Scholar). Inhibition of CODHIICh by Potassium Cyanide under Non-turnover Conditions—Assays (1 ml) were performed at 23 °C and contained CODHIICh in buffer A with 4 mm sodium dithionite plus 2 mm DTT, 4 mm Ti(III) citrate, 2 mm DTT or without reductants under an atmosphere of CO or N2. Inhibition was initiated by the addition of KCN. Aliquots were removed with time and analyzed for CO oxidation activity. Reactivation of Cyanide-inhibited Reduced CODHIICh—Cyanide-inhibited reduced CODHIICh was prepared by treatment of the enzyme with KCN under non-turnover conditions. CODHIICh (109 μg) was incubated for 20 min at 23 °C under N2 in 1 ml of buffer A containing 75 μm KCN, 4 mm dithionite, and 4mm DTT. Such treatment resulted in complete loss of CO oxidation activity. To lower the concentration of KCN in reactivation assays to non-inhibitory 0.07 μm, samples of inhibited CODHIICh were diluted 11 times in buffer A containing 2 mm DTT under N2. For reactivation, 10 μl of diluted samples were added to 1 ml of buffer A without reductants or with 4 mm dithionite plus 2 mm DTT, 4 mm Ti(III) citrate, or 2 mm DTT under CO or N2. Reactivations were performed at 23, 50, and 70 °C. Effect of Sodium Sulfide on CODHIICh—Sodium sulfide (Na2S) was added to CODHIICh activity assays under turnover conditions, to the reactivation assays of cyanide-inhibited reduced CODHIICh, and to the as isolated CODHIICh under non-turnover conditions. Preparation of Samples for XAS—Dithionite-reduced CODHIICh (CODH-DT, 15,400 units mg-1) was produced by treatment of as isolated enzyme under N2 with 4 mm dithionite for 5 min at 23 °C followed by concentration under N2 to 99 mg ml-1. CO-treated dithionite-reduced CODHIICh (CODH-CO, 14,600 units mg-1) was produced by incubation of as isolated enzyme under CO in the presence of 4 mm dithionite for 1 h at 50 °C followed by concentration under CO to 85 mg ml-1. For dithionite-reduced CODHIICh reversibly inhibited by cyanide (CODH-CNa and CODH-CNb), the as isolated enzyme was diluted under N2 with buffer A containing 4 mm dithionite and 2mm DTT to 0.25 (CODH-CNa) or 0.46 mg ml-1 (CODH-CNb). KCN was added to the final concentrations of 1 mm (CODH-CNa) and 200 μm (CODH-CNb). After a 40-min incubation at 23 °C with gentle stirring, the activity was completely inhibited. The samples were concentrated under N2 to 64 (CODH-CNa) and 132 mg ml-1 (CODH-CNb) and displayed activities of 700 and 44 units mg-1, respectively. CODH-CNa and CODH-CNb were reversibly inhibited since they could be reactivated to 5,400 and 13,100 units mg-1, respectively, upon incubation at 70 °C under CO or N2 in buffer A containing 4 mm Ti(III) citrate or 4 mm dithionite plus 2 mm DTT. CODHIICh reactivated after the inhibition by cyanide (CODH-react., 13,100 units mg-1) was prepared from the concentrated CODH-CNb. To remove the unbound cyanide, CODH-CNb (70 μl) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of buffer A under N2 containing 4 mm dithionite and 2 mm DTT and concentrated to 50 μlby ultrafiltration under N2. The procedure was repeated two times. For the reactivation, the concentrated enzyme (50 μl) was dissolved in 30 ml of buffer A with 4 mm dithionite and 2 mm DTT to a protein concentration of 0.3 mg ml-1 and incubated at 70 °C under N2 for 40 min. Reactivated CODHIICh was concentrated under N2 to 157 mg ml-1, yielding sample CODH-react. Ni-K Edge XAS Measurements—For XAS measurements, 25 μl of each sample were filled into plastic cells covered with Kapton foil. Cells were sealed and kept in liquid N2. The Ni-K edge XAS data, 8.2-9.2 keV, were collected in fluorescence mode with a silicon (111) monochromator at the EMBL beam-line D2 (DESY, Hamburg, Germany). Harmonic rejection was achieved by a focusing mirror (cut-off energy 20.5 KeV) and a monochromator detuning to 70% of its peak intensity. The sample cells were kept at ∼20 K in a two-stage Displex cryostat. Automated data reduction, such as normalization and extraction of the fine structure, was performed with KEMP (24Korbas M. Fulla Marsa D. Meyer-Klaucke W. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 2006; 77063105Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) assuming an energy threshold E0,Ni = 8,333 eV. Sample integrity during exposure to synchrotron radiation was checked by monitoring the position and shape of the absorption edge on sequential scans. No change in redox state or metal environment was detectable. X-ray Absorption near Edge Structure (XANES) Analysis—The Ni-K edge position was defined at the energy corresponding to a normalized absorbance of 0.5 (25Colpas G.J. Maroney M.J. Bagyinka C. Kumar M. Willis W.S. Suib S.L. Baidya N. Mascharak P.K. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 30: 920-928Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The extracted 1s → 3d pre-edge feature, isolated by subtracting an arctangent function and a first order polynomial to the rising edge (25Colpas G.J. Maroney M.J. Bagyinka C. Kumar M. Willis W.S. Suib S.L. Baidya N. Mascharak P.K. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 30: 920-928Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar), was fitted to a single Gaussian function centered at ∼8,332 eV. Its intensity corresponds to the integrated area of the Gaussian function. Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) Analysis—The extracted Ni-K edge (20-700 eV) EXAFS were converted to photoelectron wave vector k-space and weighted by k3. The spectra were analyzed with EXCURV98 (26Binsted N. Strange R.W. Hasnain S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12117-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), refining the theoretical EXAFS for defined structural models based on the curved-wave theory. In addition to single scattering contributions, multiple scattering units were defined for linear Ni-C-N and square-planar Ni-4S. Parameters of each structural model, namely the atomic distances (R), the Debye-Waller factors (2σ2), and a residual shift of the energy origin (EF), were optimized, minimizing the fit index (Φ) while keeping the number of free parameters below those of the independent points (26Binsted N. Strange R.W. Hasnain S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12117-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 27Stern E.A. Physiol. Rev. B. 1993; 48: 9825-9827Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Throughout the data analysis, the amplitude reduction factor was kept at 1.0. The reduced χ2 test verified the significance of an additional ligand in the models (26Binsted N. Strange R.W. Hasnain S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12117-12125Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Inhibition of CODHIICh by Potassium Cyanide—Potassium cyanide inhibits CO oxidation activity of CODHIICh under catalytic (turnover) conditions in the presence of CO and electron acceptor methyl viologen (Figs. 1, A and B, and 2A) as well as under non-turnover conditions in the absence of CO and acceptor (Fig. 1, C and D). The rate of inhibition depends on time (Fig. 1, A-D), the cyanide concentration (Fig. 1, A-C), and the incubation temperature (Fig. 1, A and B). Since CODHIICh displays a high temperature optimum for activity (2Svetlitchnyi V. Peschel C. Acker G. Meyer O. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5134-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the temperature dependence of inhibition indicates a similar mode of interaction of cyanide and CO with the active site. This is supported by the double reciprocal plot of initial activity versus CO concentration as a function of cyanide concentration, revealing a pattern characteristic of competitive inhibition and a Ki of 21.7 μm cyanide (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2A, competitive inhibition of CO oxidation by CODHIICh under turnover conditions in the presence of CO, methyl viologen, and cyanide. KCN was added to serum-stoppered cuvettes for the assay of CO oxidation activity prior to the addition of CODHIICh. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μl of stock enzyme solution (0.144 μg ml-1). The different CO concentrations were established by adding the appropriate amounts of CO-saturated reaction mixture to assays containing the same reaction mixture saturated with N2. V0 indicates the initial activity in units mg-1. KCN concentrations in the cuvettes were 0 (•), 24.6 (▾), and 49.0 (▪) μm. B, effect of CO on the inhibition of oxidized CODHIICh by cyanide under non-turnover conditions. CODHIICh (0.19 μg ml-1) was incubated with 2 mm KCN in the absence of reductants under an atmosphere of CO (•) or N2 (○) at 23 °C. C, effect of sodium sulfide on the activity of CODHIICh under turnover conditions in the presence of CO and methyl viologen. Na2S was added to serum-stoppered cuvettes for the assay of CO oxidation activity containing 1.05 ng ml-1 CODHIICh. 100% activity corresponds to 14,800 units mg-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The inhibition by cyanide under non-turnover conditions greatly depends on the redox state of CODHIICh (Fig. 1, C and D). Reduced CODHIICh incubated with low potential reductants dithionite or Ti(III) citrate (redox potential ∼-500 mV) is inhibited more strongly than the more oxidized enzyme incubated with the weak reductant DTT (∼-330 mV) or without reductants. This indicates an efficient interaction of cyanide with the highly reduced cluster C of CODHIICh at redox potentials of ∼-500 mV. Obviously, CO also interacts with cluster C of CODHIICh at very low potentials since the oxidation of CO in C. hydrogenoformans (-520 mV) is coupled to the reduction of protons to H2 (-410 mV) (2Svetlitchnyi V. Peschel C. Acker G. Meyer O. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5134-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, cyanide interacts with the reduced cluster C of CODHIICh in a similar fashion as the substrate CO. CO protects reduced CODHIICh against inhibition by potassium cyanide since there is no decrease of activity under CO in contrast to complete inhibition under N2 (Fig. 1D), whereas the oxidized enzyme is not protected by CO (Fig. 2B). The protection by CO suggests that cyanide and CO share a common binding site at the reduced cluster C. The effects of temperature (Fig. 1, A and B), redox dependence (Fig. 1, C and D), protection by CO (Fig. 1D), and competitive character of inhibition with respect to CO (Fig. 2A) suggest that the inhibition of reduced CODHIICh by cyanide is due to the occupation of the CO binding site. Reactivation of Cyanide-inhibited Reduced CODHIICh—Inhibition of dithionite- or Ti(III) citrate-reduced CODHIICh by potassium cyanide is fully reversible since the enzyme can be completely reactivated (Fig. 1, E and F). CO, high temperature (70 °C), and the presence of dithionite or Ti(III) citrate accelerate the reactivation and increase the maximum level of regained activity as compared with reactivation under N2 at lower incubation temperatures (23 or 50 °C) and in the absence of low potential reductants (Fig. 1, E and F). The significant acceleration of reactivation under CO (Fig. 1, E and F), which apparently displaces cyanide at the CO binding site, indicates again that the interaction of reduced CODHIICh with cyanide mimics its interaction with CO. The effect of CO is evident at 23 and 50 °C (Fig. 1E). At 70 °C, the effect of CO is negligible, and CODHIICh can be completely reactivated after 25 min in the absence of CO (Fig. 1, E and F). Apparently, the dissociation of cyanide from the active site is accelerated by high temperatures, whereas at low temperatures, CO is required to displace the bound cyanide. Low potential reductants are required for fast and complete reactivation (Fig. 1F). Inhibited CODHIICh regains initial activity after a 15-25-min incubation at 70 °C with dithionite or Ti(III) citrate under CO or N2. In contrast, slower and partial reactivation to 30-50% of the initial activity occurs with DTT or without reductants (Fig. 1F). The reactivation patterns discussed above further substantiate that the inhibition of reduced CODHIICh originates from the occupation of the CO binding site by cyanide. This inhibition is not due to any decomposition of cluster C since the activity can be completely recovered (Fig. 1, E and F). Effect of Sodium Sulfide on CODHIICh—Sodium sulfide has no effect on the reactivation of cyanide-inhibited CODHIICh in the presence of dithionite (Fig. 1G). Partial reactivation with sulfide alone (Fig. 1G) is brought about by its function as a strong reductant and not as a sulfur source since the enzyme can be completely reactivated in the presence of Ti(III) citrate alone (Fig. 1F). Sulfide does not inhibit CODHIICh under non-turnover conditions in the presence or absence of dithionite (Fig. 1H) as well as under turnover conditions (Fig. 2C). Apparently, sulfide does not affect CO oxidation by CODHIICh, which is in contrast to the reported inhibition of CODHRr and CODHMt by sulfide and to the suggested inhibitory role of the bridging μ2S (13Feng J. Lindahl P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 9094-9100Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). XAS of Dithionite-reduced CODHIICh—Ni-K edge XAS on highly active dithionite-reduced CODHIICh (CODH-DT, 15,400 units mg-1) reveals the nickel coordination in functional CODHIICh in solution. The XANES spectrum (Fig. 3A) resembles that of the four-coordinate square-planar complexes of nickel (25Colpas G.J. Maroney M.J. Bagyinka C. Kumar M. Willis W.S. Suib S.L. Baidya N. Mascharak P.K.

It shows a small shoulder near 8,337 eV, which has been observed in tetragonal geometries lacking one or more axial ligands and has been assigned to a 1s → 4pz transition (with shakedown contributions).

This is accomplished in part through Ca2+ waves and other spatial patterns of Ca2+ signals. To investigate the mechanism responsible for the formation of Ca2+ waves, we examined the role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) isoforms in Ca2+ wave formation. Ca2+ signals were examined in hepatocytes, which express the type I and II InsP3R in a polarized fashion, and in AR4-2J cells, a nonpolarized cell line that expresses type I and II InsP3R in a ratio similar to what is found in hepatocytes but homogeneously throughout the cell. Expression of type I or II InsP3R was selectively suppressed by isoform-specific DNA antisense in an adenoviral delivery system, which was delivered to AR4-2J cells in culture and to hepatocytes in vivo. Loss of either isoform inhibited Ca2+ signals to a similar extent in AR4-2J cells. In contrast, loss of the basolateral type I InsP3R decreased the sensitivity of hepatocytes to vasopressin but had little effect on the initiation or spread of Ca2+ waves across hepatocytes. Loss of the apical type II isoform caused an even greater decrease in the sensitivity of hepatocytes to vasopressin and resulted in Ca2+ waves that were much slower and delayed in onset. These findings provide evidence that the apical concentration of type II InsP3Rs is essential for the formation of Ca2+ waves in hepatocytes. The subcellular distribution of InsP3R isoforms may critically determine the repertoire of spatial patterns of Ca2+ signals.

Cytosolic Ca2+ exerts wide ranging effects as a second messenger (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4395) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes Ca2+ regulates such diverse functions as bile secretion, glucose release, cell metabolism, gene transcription, and apoptosis (2Leite M.F. Nathanson M.H. Arias I.M. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 537-554Google Scholar). Spatial patterns of Ca2+ signals, such as Ca2+ waves, help encode the information that is responsible for such regulation (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Burgstahler A.D. Fallon M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G338-G349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not entirely understood how InsP3Rs regulate the formation and spread of Ca2+ waves. There are three isoforms of the InsP3R, each with distinct biophysical properties (10Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E.

There is also variability in the expression and subcellular distribution of each isoform among different cell and tissue types (8Hirata K. Pusl T. O'Neill A.F. Dranoff J.A. Nathanson M.H.

O'Neill A.F. Dranoff J.A. Nathanson M.H. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 1088-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, the type I InsP3R is distributed relatively uniformly throughout the hepatocyte, whereas the type II isoform is concentrated in the apical region (8Hirata K. Pusl T. O'Neill A.F. Dranoff J.A. Nathanson M.H. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 1088-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the expression and subcellular distribution of each isoform determines the spatial patterns of Ca2+ signals in cells. Because the type II InsP3R is the isoform with the highest affinity for InsP3 (17Newton C.L. Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been suggested that Ca2+ waves begin in the apical region of hepatocytes because the type II isoform is concentrated there (8Hirata K. Pusl T. O'Neill A.F. Dranoff J.A. Nathanson M.H. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 1088-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to determine whether the subcellular distribution of InsP3R isoforms is important for organizing the pattern of Ca2+ waves. Materials—Acetylcholine (ACh), arginine-vasopressin, bovine serum albumin, and penicillin-streptomycin were obtained from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Liebowitz 15 (L-15) medium were from Invitrogen. Fluo-4/acetoxymethyl ester, TO-PRO-3, and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were of the highest quality commercially available. Cloning of Rat cDNA Sequences for Type I, II, and III Isoforms of the InsP3R—The cDNA for the type I and type II isoforms of the InsP3R was synthesized by reverse transcription-PCR using template RNA isolated from the brain and the liver of rats, respectively. RNA from RIN cells was used as a template for the cDNA of the type III isoform. The RNA was isolated by the RNAqueous™ kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). The sequences for each forward primer contained an XbaI site, and the sequence for each reverse primer contained a HindIII site. Sequences were designed to be ∼200 bp in length in order to maximize their stability upon production by adenovirus. Vector NTI software (Invitrogen) was used to identify regions of each isoform that had minimal (16-19%) homology with the other two isoforms (Fig. 1). This approach was taken so that each of the three antisense sequences would have little likelihood of inhibiting expression of InsP3R isoforms in a nonspecific fashion. The resulting primers for each of the three isoforms were as follows: (a) type I isoform 5′ (5′-aagctttACATCTGCAGGGCCTGTAACAA-3′, position 4699-4720) and type I isoform 3′ (5′-ctagaGCAGTGGTAAACTCGGAACACG-3′, position 4873-4895), which generates a 196-bp cDNA fragment; (b) type II isoform 5′ (5′-agctttTTCTCAGCCCTCCTTTGGGTAG-3′, position 6787-6809) and type II isoform 3′ (5′-tctagaTTCCCACAAAACTCACCAGGA-3′, position 6964-6986), which generates a 199-bp cDNA fragment; (c) type III isoform 5′ (5′-aagctttTGTGGGGTAGCATCTCCTTCAA-3′, position 6739-6761) and type III isoform 3′(5′-tctagaGAAGGACCAGTGCCACAATGAG-3′, position 6920-6942), which generates a 203-bp cDNA fragment. The obtained cDNA sequence for each isoform was then subcloned into the dual promoter (pCR II) vector (Invitrogen) for amplification, and then the identities were confirmed by direct sequencing. Antisense Oligonucleotides and Adenovirus Construction—Each cDNA was cloned into an adenovirus vector in an antisense orientation as described previously (18Lu C.Y. Giordano F.J. Rogers K.C. Rothman A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1703-1713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA sequence for each InsP3R isoform was directionally sub-cloned into the adenoviral shuttle vector pCMVPLPASR, between the HindIII and XbaI polycloning sites in an antisense orientation, and each of the three antisense sequences was confirmed by sequencing. This construct was co-transfected with the plasmid pJM17 into 293 cells. Homologous recombination resulted in adenoviral particles expressing the antisense construct (19McGrory W.J. Bautista D.S. Graham F.L. Virology. 1988; 163: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The resultant adenoviruses were tested by PCR to ensure that each expressed the correct sequence. Individual viral plaques were isolated and amplified, and then the recombinant adenoviruses were purified and concentrated using CsCl step gradients followed by dialysis against 10% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline. Viral stocks consisting of 8 × 1010 plaque-forming units (pfu)/ml for adenoviral antisense for the type I InsP3R, 7 × 1010 pfu/ml for the type II receptor, and 5 × 1010 pfu/cell for the type III receptor were produced after four rounds of amplification for each construct. Viruses were then stored in aliquots at -80 °C in buffer with 10% glycerol. DsRed and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (Clontech) were used to form adenoviral DsRed and EGFP constructs, respectively. These were amplified and purified as described above and then used to monitor the efficacy of infection. Infection Conditions—Both cell lines and animals were used for adenoviral studies. AR4-2J pancreatoma and RIN insulinoma cell lines (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum and antibiotics. Cells were seeded onto culture dishes at a density of 8 × 105 cells/dish. After an initial incubation period of 24 h, the cells were infected with adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 40 followed by a further 24-48 h of incubation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-225 g; Charles River Breeding Laboratories) were used for all animal studies. For adenoviral studies, animals were anesthetized with 4% pentobarbital (0.4 ml intraperitoneally) and then adenoviral constructs (5 × 109 pfu/ml) were injected via the portal vein, which was exposed by laparotomy. After repair of the surgical wound, animals were allowed to recover and then were sacrificed 48 h later. At the time of sacrifice, livers were used for immunofluorescence or else used to isolate hepatocyte couplets and triplets as described below. All animal experiments were performed under the guidelines of the Yale University IACUC. Immunoblotting—Immunoblots were used to test the efficacy of adenoviral antisense constructs and were performed as described previously (8Hirata K. Pusl T. O'Neill A.F. Dranoff J.A. Nathanson M.H.

Briefly, cells were lysed at 4 °C with lysis buffer; the lysate underwent centrifugation, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined spectrophotometrically. Twenty five μg of total cellular protein was separated by SDS-PAGE using a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Membranes were blocked with nonfat milk and then incubated at room temperature with InsP3R isoform-specific antibodies (8Hirata K. Pusl T. O'Neill A.F. Dranoff J.A. Nathanson M.H.

Membranes were washed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and then protein-antibody conjugates were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Confocal immunofluorescence to detect the subcellular distribution of InsP3R isoforms was performed as described previously (8Hirata K. Pusl T. O'Neill A.F. Dranoff J.A.

Briefly, frozen rat liver sections were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, followed by tissue permeabilization in 0.5% Triton X-100. After blocking steps, the liver sections were incubated with primary antibody against specific InsP3R isoforms and then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and 1% bovine serum albumin. The specimens were then incubated with Alexa 488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) and co-labeled with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) to facilitate the recognition of the apical and the basolateral pole of hepatocytes (8Hirata K.

For AR4-2J cells, the isolated cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, then fixed with 4% formaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Primary and secondary antibodies were the same as used for liver immunofluorescence, and TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes) was used to label the nucleus of the cultured cells. An MRC-1024 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) was used for all imaging studies. Images were obtained by excitation at 488 nm and observation at 505-550 nm to detect Alexa 488. Tissue specimens were excited at 543 nm and observed at >585 nm to detect rhodamine phalloidin, whereas cells in culture were excited at 647 nm and observed at >680 nm to detect TO-PRO-3. Isolation of Hepatocytes—Isolated rat hepatocyte couplets and triplets were used for single cell imaging, because these cells maintain structural and functional polarity in short term culture (8Hirata K.

Briefly, rat livers were perfused with Hanks' A and then Hanks' B medium containing 0.05% collagenase (Roche Applied Science) and 0.8 units of trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) per unit of tryptic activity. Livers were minced and passed through serial nylon mesh filters, and the resultant cells were washed. Isolated hepatocytes were resuspended in L-15 medium with 50 units of penicillin and 50 mg of streptomycin. The cells were then seeded onto glass coverslips and incubated at 37 °C for 2-4 h before used. Measurement of Cytosolic Ca2+—Cytosolic Ca2+ was monitored in individual cells and subcellular regions by time lapse confocal microscopy as described previously (8Hirata K. Pusl T. O'Neill A.F.

Coverslips seeded with the cells were transferred to a custombuilt perfusion chamber on the stage of an MRC-1024 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad), and the cells were then perfused with HEPES-buffered solution. Fluo-4 was excited at 488 nm and observed at 505-550 nm. In most experiments a ×63 objective was used to observe the cells, but a ×20 objective was used in a limited series of studies to monitor population responses to agonists. Increases in Ca2+ were expressed as percent increase in Fluo-4 fluorescence intensity. Statistics—All results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Student's t test was used for comparisons between groups, whereas repeated measures ANOVA was used for comparisons among larger groups. A p value less than 0.05 was used to indicate a statistically significant difference. GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA) was used for all statistical tests. Adenoviral Antisense Can Selectively Decrease Expression of Specific InsP3R Isoforms—Antisense sequences were designed for regions of each InsP3R isoform with little homology to the other two isoforms (Fig. 1), and an adenoviral delivery system was used. AR4-2J cells were used as a tool to examine the efficacy of the adenoviral antisense constructs because these cells, like hepatocytes, are epithelia that almost exclusively express the types I and II InsP3R (20Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In addition, hepatocytes and AR4-2J cells express these two isoforms in similar proportions (20Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), and AR4-2J cells can be induced to differentiate into a hepatocyte phenotype (23Shen C.N. Slack J.M.W. Tosh D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Confocal immunofluorescence confirmed that AR4-2J cells express the type I and II isoforms of the InsP3R (Fig. 2). Both isoforms were distributed uniformly throughout the cytosol (Fig. 2, A and D). The cells were colabeled with the nuclear stain TO-PRO-3 (Fig. 2, B and E), which suggested the presence of the type I isoform of the InsP3R in the nucleus as well (Fig. 2C), although the nuclear labeling may have been nonspecific. There was minimal nuclear expression of the type II isoform (Fig. 2F). Thus, the cytosolic distribution of these two receptor isoforms was similar in AR4-2J cells. The efficacy of the isoform-specific adenoviral antisense constructs was determined in several steps. First, the efficiency of adenoviral infection was optimized by infecting cells with an adenovirus-DsRed construct. This allowed visual confirmation of successful infection. The efficiency of infection of AR4-2J cells was 100% using an m.o.i. of 40 (not shown), so this m.o.i. was used for infection with antisense constructs as well. Immunoblotting was then performed to analyze the effects of each adenoviral antisense construct. Treatment of AR4-2J cells with the adenoviral antisense construct for the type I InsP3R decreased the expression of the type I InsP3R (Fig. 3A) but not the type II InsP3R (Fig. 3B). Similarly, treatment of these cells with the construct for the type II InsP3R decreased the expression of the type II InsP3R (Fig. 3C), without affecting the expression of the type I InsP3R (Fig. 3D). In each case, expression of the respective isoform decreased markedly by 24 h post-infection and remained low after 48 h. Cells infected with an m.o.i. of less than 40 exhibited less pronounced decreases in the expression of the corresponding InsP3R isoform (not shown). Expression of type I and type II InsP3R was not inhibited by infection with adenovirus construct for DsRed (Fig. 3, A and C), demonstrating that the inhibition was not a nonspecific effect of adenoviral infection. Finally, the efficacy of the adenoviral antisense construct for the type III InsP3R was examined. RIN cells were used for these experiments because this cell type nearly exclusively expresses the type III isoform (11Hagar R.E. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1998; 396: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 20Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The expression of this isoform in RIN cells was decreased only slightly 24 h after infection but decreased dramatically 48 h after infection (Fig. 3E). The basis for the longer time interval needed to decrease expression of this isoform is unclear. The type III InsP3R is degraded as quickly as the other two InsP3R isoforms following stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis (20Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). However, InsP3R turnover is much slower in nonstimulated cells (24Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5673-5679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so it is possible that the type III isoform has a longer half-life than the other two isoforms. These results demonstrate that each of the three adenoviral antisense constructs effectively inhibits expression of the corresponding InsP3R isoform.FIGURE 3Efficacy and specificity of adenoviral antisense constructs for each InsP3R isoform. A, effect of type I antisense (AS) on expression of the type I InsP3R in AR4-2J cells. The adenoviral construct markedly decreases expression of the type I isoform both 24 and 48 h after infection (left and right lanes, respectively), relative to uninfected control cells (ctrl). In contrast, expression of this isoform was not decreased 24 or 48 h after infection with the adenoviral DsRed construct (left and right lanes, respectively). B, expression of the type II isoform is not decreased 24 or 48 h after infection with the antisense construct for the type I InsP3R (left and right lanes, respectively), relative to uninfected control cells. C, effect of type II antisense on expression of the type II InsP3R in AR4-2J cells. The adenoviral construct markedly decreases expression of the type II isoform both 24 and 48 h after infection (left and right lanes, respectively), relative to uninfected control cells. In contrast, expression of this isoform was not decreased 24 or 48 h after infection with the adenoviral DsRed construct. D, expression of the type I isoform is not decreased 24 or 48 h after infection with the antisense construct for the type II InsP3R (left and right lanes, respectively), relative to uninfected control cells. E, effect of type III antisense on expression of the type III InsP3R in RIN cells. The adenoviral construct markedly decreases expression of the type III isoform 48 h (right) but not 24 h (left) after infection, relative to uninfected control cells. Each immunoblot was performed using 25 μg of protein/lane, and cells were infected with each adenovirus at a concentration of 5 × 1010pfu/ml (m.o.i. = 40).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Type I and II InsP3Rs Both Contribute to Ca2+ Signals in AR4-2J Cells—To investigate the relative contribution of the type I and II InsP3R isoforms to Ca2+ signaling in AR4-2J cells, the cells were infected with adenoviral constructs as described above. Cells were then stimulated with ACh (10 μm) to induce an InsP3-mediated increase in cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 4A). The amplitude of the ACh-induced Ca2+ signal was reduced by 75% in cells treated with adenoviral antisense for either the type I or type II InsP3R (p < 10-10 relative to uninfected controls, n = 20-22 cells in each group) (Fig. 4, A and B). Infection with the adenovirus DsRed construct did not affect the amplitude of the ACh-induced Ca2+ signal (p = 0.12), suggesting that the inhibition was not a nonspecific effect of adenoviral infection (n = 20 in both the noninfected and DsRed group) (Fig. 4B). The amplitude of the ACh-induced Ca2+ signal was not reduced significantly in cells treated with adenoviral antisense for either the type I or II InsP3R if cells were stimulated with lower concentrations of ACh (Fig. 4C). To characterize the effects of InsP3R isoforms on Ca2+ signals more completely, the relationship between ACh concentration and percent of responding cells (Fig. 4D) and time delay before a Ca2+ signal begins (Fig. 4E) were examined. The percent of cells responding to ACh was lower than controls in cells treated with adenoviral antisense for either the type I or II InsP3R, but only at minimal concentrations of ACh (Fig. 4D). Similarly, the time delay before the onset of ACh-induced Ca2+ signals was lower in controls than in cells treated with adenoviral antisense for either the type I or II InsP3R. The time delay was prolonged in cells expressing either type of antisense and stimulated with lower ACh concentrations, but the time delay persisted at higher ACh concentrations only in those cells expressing antisense for the type II InsP3R (Fig. 4E). These findings demonstrate that the loss of InsP3Rs induced by the adenoviral const"

Because confluent polarized epithelia demonstrate dome formation and sodium influx that mimic the onset of differentiation, we sought to elucidate the role of Stat3 in association with the regulation of selective epithelial transporters in this biological phenomenon. This study established the correlation between Stat3 activation and cell confluence-induced dome formation in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) by following Stat3 activation events in dome-forming cells. Epifluorescent and confocal microscopy provided evidence showing specific localization of phosphorylated Stat3 Tyr705 in the nuclei of dome-forming cells at initial stages. The relationship was further elucidated by the establishment of tetracycline-inducible expression of constitutive Stat3 mutant (Stat3-C) in MDCK cells or expression of dominant negative Stat3 (Stat3-D) stable cell lines (MDCK and NMuMG). Dome formation was promoted by the expression of Stat3-C but inhibited by Stat3-D. Two trans-epithelial transporters, NHE3 and ENaC α-subunit, were found to be increased during cell confluence. Interestingly, NHE3 expression could be specifically up-regulated by Stat3-C but inhibited by Stat3-D through promoter regulation, whereas NHE1 and ENaC α-subunit were not affected by Stat3 expression. Application of NHE3 shRNA, NHE3 inhibitors (EIPA and S3226) suppressed confluence-induced dome formation in MDCK or NMuMG cells. These results demonstrate a cell confluence-induced Stat3 signaling pathway in epithelial cells in triggering dome formation through NHE3 augmentation.

This feature is conceived by the coordinated development of transepithelial transport systems in morphologically polarized cells.

At least three possible mechanisms exist to coordinate the vectorial sodium transport across MDCK monolayer from apical to basolateral sites. One is the ouabain-sensitive Na+-K+ exchange mechanism, the second is the furosemide-sensitive Na+-Cl-/K+-Cl- co-transport mechanism, and the third is the amiloride-sensitive ENaC (12Kennedy B.G.

In mammalian kidney, NHE3 is the key factor acting to reabsorb sodium and water across the epithelial cells of renal proximal tubule (21Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Miller M.L. Soleimani M.

In general, STAT signaling events are triggered by membrane receptors in response to wide varieties of cytokines and growth factors to regulate physiological responses (24Calo V. Migliavacca M.

Receptors for cytokines are devoid of intrinsic kinase activity and require the mediation of Janus kinases (JAKs) for STAT phosphorylation (24Calo V. Migliavacca M. Bazan V. Macaluso M. Buscemi M. Gebbia N. Russo A. J. Cell Physiol. 2003; 197: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 25Bromberg J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2468-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). However, recently, a ligand-independent activation of Stat3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3) by cell confluence has been demonstrated in both cancer and normal epithelial cell lines (27Steinman R.A. Wentzel A. Lu Y. Stehle C. Grandis J.R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Vultur A. Cao J. Arulanandam R. Turkson J. Jove R. Greer P. Craig A. Elliott B. Raptis L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2600-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These studies revealed cdk2-(cyclin-dependent kinase 2)-regulated activation of Stat3 by cell growth arrest and envisioned a novel role of JAK-dependent Stat3 signaling in modulating the survival-related physiological functions during cell confluence. This raises the possibility that signaling via Stat3 (or their cognate family members involved in the growth control, such as Stat1 and 5 (25Bromberg J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2468-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar)), as a result of cell confluence, modulates trans-epithelial sodium transport and lead to dome formation. STAT proteins, which include 7 latent cytoplasmic transcription factors, are normally activated through phosphorylation of their tyrosine residues by several tyrosine kinases. The key tyrosine residue phosphorylated in Stat1 is Tyr701, in Stat3 is Tyr705, and in Stat5 is Tyr694 (24Calo V. Migliavacca M. Bazan V. Macaluso M. Buscemi M. Gebbia N. Russo A. J. Cell Physiol. 2003; 197: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated STATs are dislodged from the receptor or non-receptor associated kinase complex and may cross-talk between each other to form immediate hetero- (e.g. Stat1-Stat3) or homodimers (e.g. Stat1-Stat1 or Stat3-Stat3) (24Calo V. Migliavacca M. Bazan V. Macaluso M. Buscemi M. Gebbia N. Russo A. J. Cell Physiol. 2003; 197: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). They are then translocated into the nucleus where they work coordinately with different co-activators to induce transcription of distinct genes via binding to their cognate cis-elements within their promoter regions (26Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar, 29Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3383) Google Scholar). We report here that cell confluence-induced activation of Stat3 regulates dome formation in MDCK and NMuMG (normal mouse mammary gland) cells by augmentation of NHE3 transporter. By coupling dome formation as a biological trait to chase Stat3 signaling events in MDCK or NMuMG cells during cell confluence, a causal effect of Stat3 resulting from cell-cell contact on dome formation was revealed. We found that the morphological characteristics of dome formation in terms of their number and size as a result of the transcriptional regulation by constitutively active or dominant negative forms of Stat3 correlated with Stat3-mediated expression of NHE3. Lastly, by functional inhibition of NHE3 activities, we demonstrated a novel Stat3-mediated NHE3 augmentation signaling pathway in regulating differentiation of a functional epithelial monolayer during cell-cell contact. Cell Culture and Stable Transfections—MDCK cells and NMuMG cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The constitutively active form Stat3 (Stat3-C) plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. James Darnell, Jr. (30Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E.

To generate the tetracycline-inducible Stat3-C system, we subcloned the Stat3-C gene from pRc/CMV plasmid to rtTA-responsive pTRE2-hyg plasmid (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). Stable transfections of inducible FLAG-tagged Stat3-C (30Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E.

The pTet-ON plasmid contains a neomycin resistance gene to permit G418 selection (0.5 mg/ml; Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). One of these rtTA clones was selected for secondary stable transfection with rtTA-responsive pTRE2-hyg hygromycin plasmid containing Stat3-C, and colonies were selected with 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA). Stable clones were screened after 24 h of induction with 10 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) for Stat3-C expression by Western blot using anti-FLAG antibody. For the dome formation assay, MDCK (2.5 × 105) cells or NMuMG (3 × 105) cells were plated on 6-cm culture dish in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and the medium was changed every 2 days until dome formation. To generate cells stably expressing a dominant negative Tyr705 mutant form of Stat3 (Stat3-F), subconfluent MDCK cells grown on 6-cm dish were co-transfected with 1 μg of pRc/CMV neomycin resistance empty vector and 4 μg of pMS1 plasmid encoding Stat3-F (31Kaptein A. Paillard V. Saunders M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5961-5964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) using 20 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). One day after transfection, cells were re-seeded on a 10-cm dish at an appropriate density in the medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418. Neomycin-resistant cell clones were selected and screened for exogenous Stat3-F expression by immunoblotting with anti-Stat3 and anti-Stat3 Tyr705(P) polyclonal antibodies. Two positive clones (clones 11 and 12) expressing Stat3-F were used for dome formation assay. To generate cells stably expressing HA epitope-tagged Stat3-D, a DNA binding domain mutant kindly provided by Dr. T. Hirano (32Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), subconfluent MDCK (and NMuMG) cells grown on a 6-cm dish were transfected with 4 μg of pCAGGSneo plasmid encoding Stat3-D using 20 μl of Lipofectamine. Neomycin-resistant cell clones were selected following the aforementioned procedures and were screened for exogenous Stat3-D expression by immunoblotting with anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Multiple positive clones expressing Stat3-D were obtained for dome formation assay. The dome number and diameter were quantified by counting and measuring domes from at least 20 independent fields at high power magnification (×100). EIPA (NHE inhibitor, Sigma) and S3226 (NHE3 inhibitor) were used for inhibition of dome formation. Confluent cells were incubated with each inhibitor at different concentrations until the dome appeared in control cells. S3226 was kindly provided by Dr. Robert J. Wilkins (33Tattersall A. Meredith D. Furla P. Shen M.R. Ellory C. Wilkins R. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2003; 13: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Oncostatin M was purchased from PeproTech EC Ltd (London, UK). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were collected according to the method of Wang et al. (34Wang Y.N. Chen Y.J. Chang W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells grown to various degrees of confluence on 6-cm plastic dishes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mm sodium chloride, 2.7 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, and 2 mm monobasic potassium phosphate) and scraped off the plate after incubation with 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm KCl) on ice for 10 min. Cells were precipitated by centrifugation at 7,500 × g for 20–30 s, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 420 mm NaCl). The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 7,500 × g for 2 min. The supernatants were collected and stored at -70 °C.

DNA Affinity Precipitation Assay (DAPA)—This assay was performed according to the method of Wang et al. (34Wang Y.N. Chen Y.J. Chang W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The binding assay was performed by mixing 200 μg of nuclear extract proteins, 2 μg of biotinylated m67 oligonucleotides specific to Stat3 binding (14McRoberts J.A. Erlinger S. Rindler M.J. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2260-2266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 20 μg of streptavidin-agarose beads in TE buffer (pH 7.9). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with rotation followed by precipitation at low speed in a microcentrifuge and washed with cold PBS three times. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), followed by Western blot analysis probed with Stat1 or Stat3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology; Danvers, MA). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total cellular RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For RT-PCR, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 0.2–1 μg of total RNA with an oligo-dT primer and the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). The sequences of PCR primers were as follows: forward primer (5′-CTC AAT GTT TTC CAT GAA CTC AAC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-ACT GTA CAG GTG CTT GTA CTC CTG-3′) were designed from Canis familiaris NHE3 (NCBI accession XM_545197), and the resulting PCR product was 318 bp.

The PCR protocol performed with the mouse NHE3 was: 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s (32 cycles), followed by 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR protocol performed with the Stat3 and GAPDH primers was: 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min (28 cycles), followed by 72 °C for 10 min. Transfection and Dual Luciferase Assay—The Stat3 reporter pm67 and its vector pTATA TK-luc were kindly provided by Dr. James Darnell, Jr. (35Besser D. Bromberg J.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The Renilla luciferase reporter pRL-TK was purchased from Promega. For the Stat3 reporter gene assay, cells (2 × 105 cells) were plated in 6-cm dish and co-transfected with 4 μg of pTATA TK-luc or m67 pTATA TK-luc with 0.5 μg pRL-TK by using the Arrest-In™ transfection reagent (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 12 h of transfection, the transfectants were reseeded into 6-well plates at high cell density (5 × 105 cells/well) or at low cell density (5 × 104 cells/well). After 24 h of incubation, cells were subjected to the dual luciferase assay. NHE3 promoter activity assay was conducted in mock-transfected MDCK cells or in cells stably transfected with inducible Stat3-C expression vector (St3C-3). Cells (2 × 105 cells) were plated in 6-cm dishes and transiently transfected with a Renilla luciferase reporter gene containing plasmid alone (either phRG-b vector, pNHE3 -450/+58) or in combination with a pCMV-Luc vector (firefly luciferase). Transient transfection was carried out by the Arrest-In™ reagent (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. phRG-b vector is a promoterless vector harboring the Renilla luciferase gene (Promega), and pNHE3 -450/+58 is the phRG-b vector fused with a rat NHE3 promoter (-450 to +58 region) to drive Renilla luciferase expression (36Kiela P.R. Hines E.R. Collins J.F. Ghishan F.K. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2001; 281: G947-956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as canine NHE3 promoter sequence has not been described. The pCMV-Luc contained the firefly luciferase gene driven by cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (a gift kindly provided by Dr. Wen-Tsan Chang, College of Medicine, National Cheng-Kung University). After 12 h of transfection, the transfectants were reseeded in 6-well plates and cultured in the medium with or without doxycycline (10 μg/ml) for 20 h. The cells were washed three times in PBS, and the lysates were prepared by scraping the cells from plates in the presence of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). Dual luciferase assays for Renilla luciferase and firefly luciferase activities were then performed on cell lysates using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a Sirius luminometer (Berthold Detection System, Pforzheim, Germany). RNA Interference—To knock-down NHE3 expression in NMuMG epithelial cells, 19-mer short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against mouse NHE3 was synthesized by Open Biosystems. Sequences for shNHE3 are: 5′-GCG TCT GTC TCA TAT TTC T-3′ and 5′-AGA AAT ATG AGA CAG ACG C-3′. For stable transfection, shNHE3 was cloned in pSM2 expression vector (Open Biosystems) and then transfected into NMuMG cells using Arrest-In™ transfection reagent (Open Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Open Biosystems). After 24 h of transfection, cells were subjected to puromycin (1 μg/ml) selection for at least 1 week. Subsequently, multiple puromycin-resistant cell clones were selected and screened for NHE3 expression by immunoblotting with NHE3 polyclonal antibody. Two positive clones (clones 4 and 10) with minimal NHE3 expression were picked for dome formation assay as described above. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Study—MDCK cells were cultured at different time intervals followed by washing three times with PBS and fixed with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After cells were washed three times in PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, they were incubated with Stat3 Tyr705(P) or Stat3 (Cell Signaling) polyclonal antibody for 1 h. Cells were then washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen) and Hoechst 33258 for 1 h. The immunofluorescent images were taken by confocal microscopy (Olympus, FV-1000). Western Blotting—Cells were grown to various degrees of confluence, and proteins were extracted using lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 7.5% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). For each blotting analysis, 50 μg of clarified cell extract was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for at least 1 h followed by an overnight incubation in primary antibody. Immunodetection was performed using antibodies against the Stat3 Tyr705(P), total Stat3, Stat3 Ser727(P), Stat1 Tyr701(P), total Stat1, Stat5 Tyr694(P) (all from Cell Signaling Technology), FLAG (Sigma), HA (Roche Applied Science; Indianapolis, IN), Ki-67 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA), PCNA (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), Lamin A/C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), β-actin (Sigma), NHE1 (Chemicon; Temecula, CA), NHE3 (Chemicon), ENaC α-subunit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Na+,K+-ATPase α1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or Na+,K+-ATPas β1 (Upstate; Charlottesville, VA) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). The bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer; Boston, MA). Statistics—All data were expressed as means ± S.E. Differences between groups were determined by Student's t test. Multigroup comparisons were determined by one-way analysis of variance. Differences in the comparison were considered to be significant when p values were less than 0.05. Cell Confluence Induces Stat3 Tyr705 Phosphorylation and DNA Binding, Which Is Correlated with Dome Formation in MDCK Cells—MDCK cells were monitored daily to establish the sequence of events from seeding to reaching confluence and to dome formation (Fig. 1A). They formed initial cell islets and proliferated to reach confluence with few highly cell-condensed clusters occasionally present at day 4. These cells organized into small blister-like structures, which represented early stage of dome formation at day 5 and progressed to reach relatively larger dimensions at day 6. These domes continued to bulge with decreased adherence to plate and kept developing for an additional week associated with floating cells and apoptotic bodies (data not shown). Cell growth reached a plateau on day 4, and the cell number was sustained as 100% confluent on day 5–6 based on a standard growth curve (data not shown). These results indicated that the init"
https://openalex.org/W2055821425,"In previous studies it was demonstrated that sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are able to interact with one of the nuclear receptors, hepatocyte nuclear receptor (HNF)-4, and that this interaction regulates transcriptional activities of these proteins (Misawa, K., Horiba, T., Arimura, N., Hirano, Y., Inoue, J., Emoto, N., Shimano, H., Shimizu, M., and Sato, R. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 36176–36182; Yamamoto, T., Shimano, H., Nakagawa, Y., Ide, T., Yahagi, N., Matsuzaka, T., Nakakuki, M., Takahashi, A., Suzuki, H., Sone, H., Toyoshima, H., Sato, R., and Yamada, N. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 12027–12035). In an attempt to identify other nuclear receptor family members affecting the SREBP transcriptional activities, we found that the liver receptor homolog (LRH)-1 suppresses them. Several types of luciferase assays revealed that coexpression of these two proteins (LRH-1 and SREBP-1a, -1c, or -2) results in reciprocal inhibition of the transcriptional activity of each protein. It was confirmed that suppression in endogenous LRH-1 by small interference RNA stimulates the mRNA levels of certain SREBP target genes and that elevation in active SREBPs in the nucleus in response to cholesterol depletion suppresses the LRH-1 activity. In vitro/in vivo glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments demonstrated that the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper domain in SREBP-2 binds to the ligand-binding domain in LRH-1. Furthermore, we found that SREBP-2 interferes with the recruitment of a coactivator of LRH-1, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α, thereby leading to the inhibition of the LRH-1 transcriptional activity. These results clearly indicate that the interaction between SREBPs and LRH-1 exerts a suppressive influence on their target gene expression responsible for cholesterol and bile acid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1981899305,"We report on the ultrasensitive protein nanoprobe system that specifically captures disease marker (autoantibodies of Type I diabetes in this case) with attomolar sensitivity. The system relies on supramolecular protein nanoparticles that bind a specific antibody [65 kDa glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65)-specific autoantibody, i.e., the early marker of Type I diabetes]. The ultrasensitive detection of early marker of Type I diabetes during the early phase of pancreatic beta-cell destruction is important because individuals at high risk of developing Type I diabetes can be identified several years before the clinical onset of the ailment. The bacterial expression of chimera genes encoding N-[human ferritin heavy chain (hFTN-H)]::[specific antigenic epitope]-C produces supramolecular nanoparticles with uniform diameters (10-15 nm), owing to self-assembly activity of hFTN-H. Each nanoparticle, formed by intermolecular self-assembly between the chimera protein molecules, is subjected to carrying a large number (presumably, 24) of epitopes with a homogeneous and stable conformation per autoantibody binding, thereby allowing substantial enhancement of sensitivity. The sensitivity was finally boosted to 3 attomolar concentration of the autoantibodies, 4-9 orders of magnitude more sensitive than conventional immunoassays. Also, this ultrasensitive protein nanoprobe successfully detected natural autoantibodies in the sera from Type I diabetic patients. The attomolar sensitivity was successfully reproduced on the detection of other antibodies, i.e., monoclonal antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen. With the two antibody markers above, the feasibility of simultaneous and multiplexing-mode detection was also demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2048859842,"The family of Smad proteins mediates transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling in cell growth and differentiation. Smads repress or activate TGF-β signaling by interacting with corepressors (e.g. Ski) or coactivators (e.g. CREB-binding protein (CBP)), respectively. Specifically, Ski has been shown to interfere with the interaction between Smad3 and CBP. However, it is unclear whether Ski competes with CBP for binding to Smads and whether they can interact with Smad3 at the same binding surface on Smad3. We investigated the interactions among purified constructs of Smad, Ski, and CBP in vitro by size-exclusion chromatography, isothermal titration calorimetry, and mutational studies. Here, we show that Ski-(16-192) interacted directly with a homotrimer of receptor-regulated Smad protein (R-Smad), e.g. Smad2 or Smad3, to form a hexamer; Ski-(16-192) interacted with an R-Smad·Smad4 heterotrimer to form a pentamer. CBP-(1941-1992) was also found to interact directly with an R-Smad homotrimer to form a hexamer and with an R-Smad·Smad4 heterotrimer to form a pentamer. Moreover, these domains of Ski and CBP competed with each other for binding to Smad3. Our mutational studies revealed that domains of Ski and CBP interacted with Smad3 at a portion of the binding surface of the Smad anchor for receptor activation. Our results suggest that Ski negatively regulates TGF-β signaling by replacing CBP in R-Smad complexes.

The common Smad protein Smad4 serves as a signaling partner to R-Smads. Phosphorylated R-Smad forms a functional signaling complex with Smad4 and then translocates into the nucleus to modulate expression of ligand-responsive genes. Structural analysis has shown that this functional signaling complex consists of two R-Smad subunits and one Smad4 subunit (Fig. 1A) (8Chacko B.M. Qin B.Y. Tiwari A. Shi G. Lam S. Hayward L.J.

Human Ski is a 728-amino acid protein, and its N-terminal region is the most conserved region between Ski and its related gene product SnoN. Separate regions within Ski have been implicated in binding to Smad4 (amino acids 219-312) (13Wu J.W. Krawitz A.R. Chai J. Li W. Zhang F. Luo K. Shi Y.

Our previous structural analysis showed that a domain of Ski (amino acids 17-45) interacts with Smad3 at part of its Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA)-binding surface (Fig. 1B) (16Qin B.Y. Lam S.S. Correia J.J. Lin K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1950-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). SARA recruits Smad3 for phosphorylation by the receptor kinase (17Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A.

Upon phosphorylation, Smad3 dissociates from SARA and enters the nucleus, where its transcriptional activity can be repressed by Ski (16Qin B.Y. Lam S.S. Correia J.J. Lin K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1950-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).As positive regulators of Smad function, the transcriptional coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 are important components of TGF-β signaling and mediate the anti-on-cogenic functions of Smad2 and Smad4 (18Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). These Smad proteins directly interact with the nuclear coactivator CBP/p300 to activate the transcription of TGF-β-responsive genes (18Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T.

However, the interactions among Smad, Ski, and CBP have not been completely characterized. It is unclear whether Ski-(16-192) or CBP-(1941-1992) can interact with Smad3 at the SARA-binding surface and whether there is direct competition between CBP and Ski for binding to Smads.To resolve the stoichiometric identity of Ski and CBP for binding to Smads and to provide insights into the regulation of TGF-β signaling, size-exclusion chromatography and isothermal titration calorimetry were used in in vitro interactive assays to measure the binding of purified Ski-(16-192) and CBP-(1941-1992) to Smads. Here, we present biochemical and calorimetric evidence that Ski and CBP directly interact with R-Smad and that Ski competes with CBP for binding to Smad.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression, Purification, and Mutagenesis—The cDNA of human Ski-(16-192) was generated by PCR and subcloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The Ski protein was expressed with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag, extracted with glutathione-Sepharose, and released with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). Eluted protein was dialyzed in DEAE buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.3), 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethanesul-fonyl fluoride). Protein was purified using a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with DEAE buffer and eluted with a gradient of 10-300 mm NaCl. Site-directed mutants of Ski-(16-192), and S3LC-(145-424) were generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing.The cDNAs of CBP-(1911-1992), CBP-(1931-1992), and CBP-(1941-1992) were generated by PCR and subcloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector. The CBPs were expressed with a GST tag (GST-CBP-(1911-1992), GST-CBP-(1931-1992), and GST-CBP-(1941-1992)) and extracted with glutathione-Sepharose. Eluted proteins were dialyzed in DEAE buffer. Proteins were purified using an SP-Sepharose column equilibrated with DEAE buffer and eluted with a gradient of 10-300 mm NaCl.The phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 constructs used to analyze Smad/Ski interactions in this study include their linker and MH2 domains. The phosphorylated Smad2 construct extends from residues 186 to 467 and is referred to as S2LC-2P. The phosphorylated Smad3 construct extends from residues 145 to 425 and is referred to as S3LC-2P. The Smad4 construct comprises its MH2 domain and part of its linker domain, extending from residues 273 to 552, and is referred to as S4AF (23Qin B. Lam S.S. Lin K. Structure (Camb.). 1999; 7: 1493-1503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). S2LC-2P and S3LC-2P were prepared using the intein-mediated phosphopeptide ligation method as described previously (16Qin B.Y. Lam S.S. Correia J.J. Lin K.

Structure (Camb.). 1999; 7: 1493-1503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Smad heteromeric S4AF·S3LC-2P complexes and S4AF·S2LC-2P were purified as described previously (8Chacko B.M. Qin B.Y. Tiwari A. Shi G. Lam S. Hayward L.J. De Caestecker M. Lin K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 813-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).To form the heteromeric complexes S2LC-2P·Ski-(16-192) and S3LC-2P·Ski-(16-192) or S2LC-2P·GST-CBP-(1941-1992) and S3LC-2P·GST-CBP-(1941-1992), Ski-(16-192) or GST-CBP-(1941-1992) was added in 2-fold molar excess to S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P, respectively, at 4 °C for 24 h. Each heteromeric complex (S2LC-2P·Ski-(16-192), S3LC-2P·Ski-(16-192), S2LC-2P·GST-CBP-(1941-1992), or S3LC-2P·GST-CBP-(1941-1992)) was purified on a Superdex 200 HR 16/60 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). Uncomplexed Ski-(16-192) and GST-CBP-(1941-1992) were eluted in fractions 31-34 and 27-31, whereas the heteromeric complexes S2LC-2P·Ski-(16-192), S3LC-2P·Ski-(16-192), S2LC-2P·GST-CBP-(1941-1992), and S3LC-2P·GST-CBP-(1941-1992) eluted in fractions 22-25.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—To measure the binding of purified Ski-(16-192) and GST-CBP-(1941-1992) with Smads, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was performed (25Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar) using a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal, LLC, Northampton, MA). All samples were dialyzed against ITC buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) and degassed prior to titration. Experiments were performed at 15 °C. Isothermal interactions between proteins were measured by titrating over 55 injections using 1.4 ml of 40 μm protein/complex against 300 μl of 400 μm Ski-(16-192) or GST-CBP-(1941-1992). The proteins/complexes tested were phosphorylated Smad2, Smad3, the heterotrimer of S2LC·S4AF, and the heterotrimer of S3LC·S4AF. The heats of dilution for Ski-(16-192) or GST-CBP-(1941-1992) were measured by titrating Ski-(16-192) or GST-CBP-(1941-1992) into ITC buffer; these values were subtracted for data analysis. Data were analyzed with Origin 7.0 software (Micro-Cal, LLC) using a single-site binding model. ΔH, ΔS, and Ka values were determined experimentally, and ΔG was calculated from the following equation: ΔG =-RT ln Ka.Size-exclusion Chromatography—To obtain the stoichiometry of Ski and CBP for binding to Smads, size-exclusion chromatography was performed on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column using theÁKTA Explorer 10 FPLC system (GE Healthcare). All runs were performed at room temperature in FPLC buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Prior to loading onto the column, protein samples were incubated in 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine for 60 min at room temperature. FPLC operation and data analysis were done with UNICORN software. The column was calibrated with blue dextran (to determine the void volume) and molecular mass standards (ovalbumin (43 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and ferritin (440 kDa)). Elution fractions (0.5 ml) were collected at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.GST Pulldown Assay—The GST fusion form of a protein was immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads, which were then cleaned with wash buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). A second protein purified without a GST tag was then added to the beads and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed again and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. The standard conditions were as follows: 100 μl of beads, 100 μg of GST fusion protein, and 200 μg of binding partner. Unless stated otherwise, the beads were washed six times (each time with 1 ml of wash buffer), rapidly mixed, and centrifuged, and the buffer was removed.RESULTSHomotrimeric S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P Interacts with Ski to Form a Heterohexamer—To determine whether Smads and Ski-(16-192) interact directly in the purified state, S2LC-2P (phosphorylated Smad2-(186-467)) or S3LC-2P (phosphorylated Smad3-(145-425)) and Ski-(16-192) were incubated overnight at 4 °C and passed over a size-exclusion column. Ski-(16-192) was found to interact directly with S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P as judged by co-elution on a size-exclusion column (Fig. 2, A and B). When mixed at a 2:1 molar ratio, a significant portion of Ski-(16-192) co-eluted in the same fractions as trimeric S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P. The remaining uncomplexed Ski-(16-192) eluted in a monomeric form. The elution peak of the S2LC-2P·Ski-(16-192) or S3LC-2P·Ski-(16-192) complex shifted 1.7 fractions forward relative to the peak of trimeric S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P, respectively.FIGURE 2Ski interacts with S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P. A, the elution peak of the S2LC-2P·Ski (left panel) or S3LC-2P·Ski (right panel) complex shifted 1. 7 fractions forward relative to the peak of trimeric S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P, respectively. Interactions between Ski-(16-192) and S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P are shown by their elution profiles upon size-exclusion chromatography. Ski-(16-192) and S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P were loaded as 2:1 molar mixtures onto a size-exclusion column, and their interactions are indicated as a heteromeric complex eluting with a peak around fraction 13. Excess uncomplexed Ski-(16-192) eluted as a monomer with a peak around fraction 21. mAU, milli-absorbance units. B, Ski co-eluted with trimeric S2LC-2P (left panels) or S3LC-2P (right panels).

C, Ski titrated into both S2LC-2P and S3LC-2P at a relative molar ratio of 1. ITC analyses are shown for the interactions between S2LC-2P and Ski-(16-192) (left panel) and between S3LC-2P and Ski-(16-192) (right panel). D, Ski interacted with a homotrimer of Smad2 or Smad3 to form a heterohexamer of Smad2·Ski or Smad3·Ski.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further characterize the interactions between Smads and Ski-(16-192), ITC was used to analyze the thermodynamics and stoichiometry of heteromeric Smad·Ski-(16-192) complex formation. The results showed that Ski-(16-192) titrated into both S2LC-2P and S3LC-2P at a relative molar ratio of 1.0 (Fig. 2C and Table 1), meaning that a single molecule of Ski-(16-192) can interact with one molecule of S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P. The ITC results are consistent with the stoichiometry observed in the size-exclusion analysis. Taken together, these results suggest that the heteromeric Smad·Ski-(16-192) complex is a heterohexamer with a preferred stoichiometry of three subunits of S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P and three subunits of Ski-(16-192) (Fig. 2D).TABLE 1Summary of ITC for Smad protein interactions with Ski and CBPComplexnΔHΔSΔGKdTΔSkcal/molcal/mol/Kkcal/molμmkcal/molS2LC-2P·Ski1.03 ± 0.04−12.5 ± 1.0−17.1 ± 1.1−7.9 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.212.5S3LC-2P·Ski1.00 ± 0.03−11.4 ± 1.1−12.3 ± 1.6−7.8 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.211.4S2LC-2P·S4AF·Ski0.67 ± 0.04−12.6 ± 1.0−18.2 ± 1.6−7.7 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.112.6S3LC-2P·S4AF·Ski0.67 ± 0.02−11.6 ± 1.2−13.4 ± 1.7−7.6 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.511.6S3LC-2P·Ski(L26A)1.00 ± 0.02−8.7 ± 0.5−5.2 ± 0.3−7.1 ± 0.23.9 ± 1.38.7S2LC-2P·CBP1.02 ± 0.03−8.8 ± 1.2−2.9 ± 1.6−7.7 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.18.8S3LC-2P·CBP1.01 ± 0.02−8.9 ± 0.5−4.1 ± 0.3−7.7 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.58.9 Open table in a new tab The affinities of S2LC-2P and S3LC-2P for Ski-(16-192) were the same. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) for both S2LC-2P·Ski-(16-192) and S3LC-2P·Ski-(16-192) was 1.0 μm, corresponding to changes in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for complex formation of -7.9 and -7.8 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 1).The Heterotrimeric S2LC-2P·S4AF or S3LC-2P·S4AF Complex Interacts with Ski to Form a Heteropentamer—To examine the interaction between heteromeric complexes of Smads and Ski, the heteromeric Smad complexes were prepared, and size-exclusion chromatography was carried out as described above using heteromeric complexes instead of homomeric complexes. The results showed that Ski-(16-192) also interacted directly with the heteromeric S2LC-2P·S4AF (Smad4-(273-552)) or S3LC-2P·S4AF complex as judged by co-elution on a size-exclusion column (Fig. 3, A and B). When mixed at a 2:1 molar ratio, a significant portion of Ski-(16-192) co-eluted in the same fractions as the heteromeric S3LC-2P·S4AF or S2LC-2P·S4AF complex. The remaining uncomplexed Ski-(16-192) also eluted in a monomeric form. The elution peak of the S2LC-2P·S4AF·Ski-(16-192) or S3LC·S4AF·Ski-(16-192) complex shifted 1.0 fraction forward relative to the peak of trimeric S2LC-2P·S4AF or S3LC-2P·S4AF, respectively.FIGURE 3Ski interacts with the S3LC-2P·S4AF or S2LC-2P·S4AF complex. A, the elution peak of the S2LC-2P·S4AF·Ski (left panel) or S3LC-2P·S4AF·Ski (right) complex shifted 1.0 fraction forward relative to the peak of trimeric S2LC-2P·S4AF or S3LC-2P·S4AF, respectively. Interactions between Ski-(16-192) and S2LC-2P·S4AF or S3LC-2P·S4AF are shown by their elution profiles upon size-exclusion chromatography. Ski-(16-192) and S2LC-2P·S4AF or S3LC-2P·S4AF were loaded as 2:1 molar mixtures onto a size-exclusion column, and their interactions are indicated by co-elution as a heteromeric complex with a peak around fraction 14. Excess uncomplexed Ski-(16-192) eluted as a monomer with a peak around fraction 21. mAU, milli-absorbance units. B, Ski co-eluted with trimeric S2LC-2P·S4AF (left panels) or S3LC-2P·S4AF (right panels). Constructs (indicated to the right of each panel) were injected into a size-exclusion column, and eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Molecular mass standards are shown above and to the left; fraction numbers are shown below. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. C, Ski titrated into both S2LC-2P·S4AF and S3LC-2P·S4AF at a relative molar ratio of 0.67. ITC analyses are shown for the interaction between S3LC-2P·S4AF and Ski-(16-192) and between S2LC-2P·S4AF and Ski-(16-192). D, Ski interacted with the heterotrimer of Smad2·Smad4 or Smad3·Smad4 to form a heteropentamer of Smad2·Smad4·Ski or Smad3·Smad4·Ski.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Likewise, to further determine the interactions between heteromeric R-Smad·Smad4 and Ski-(16-192), ITC was used to analyze the thermodynamics and stoichiometry of heteromeric R-Smad·Smad4·Ski-(16-192) complex formation. The ITC results are shown in Fig. 3C and Table 1. Ski-(16-192) titrated into both S2LC-2P·S4AF and S3LC-2P·S4AF at a relative molar ratio of 0.67, meaning that two molecules of Ski-(16-192) can interact with three molecules of S2LC-2P·S4AF or S3LC-2P·S4AF. This result suggests that Ski-(16-192) interacts only with the subunits of S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P in the R-Smad·Smad4 heterotrimer.Again, we found that the affinities of S2LC-2P·S4AF and S3LC-2P·S4AF for Ski-(16-192) were very close. The apparent Kd values for S2LC-2P·S4AF·Ski-(16-192) and S3LC-2P·S4AF·Ski-(16-192) were 1.5 and 1.6 μm, respectively, corresponding to ΔG values for complex formation of -7.7 and -7.6 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 1).Ski-(16-192) interacted with S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P as shown by co-elution with an apparent molecular mass larger than that of S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P alone (Fig. 2, A and B). Ski-(16-192) also interacted with the S2LC-2P·S4AF or S3LC-2P·S4AF heterotrimer as shown by co-elution of all three species with an apparent molecular mass larger than that of the trimeric S2LC-2P·S4AF or S3LC-2P·S4AF complex (Fig. 3, A and B). To confirm that Ski-(16-192) does not interact with Smad4, size-exclusion chromatography and ITC experiments were also carried out. The results suggest that Smad4 alone or within the heterotrimeric Smad complex does not interact with Ski-(16-192). This lack of interaction is supported by five observations. First, S4AF and Ski did not form a complex on the size-exclusion column (data not shown). Second, Ski-(16-192) did not interact with Smad4 upon ITC analysis (data not shown). Third, the S2LC-2P·Ski-(16-192) or S3LC-2P·Ski-(16-192) complex eluted with an apparent molecular mass larger than that of the S2LC-2P·S4AF·Ski-(16-192) or S3LC-2P·S4AF·Ski-(16-192) complex (Figs. 2A and 3A). Fourth, the molar ratio of Ski-(16-192) titrated into S2LC-2P·S4AF or S3LC-2P·S4AF was smaller than that of Ski-(16-192) titrated into S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P. Fifth, the Kd for the S2LC-2P·S4AF·Ski-(16-192) or S3LC-2P·S4AF·Ski-(16-192) complex was greater than that for the S2LC-2P·Ski-(16-192) or S3LC-2P·Ski-(16-192) complex, respectively (Table 1). This result is consistent with a previous report that the Smad4/Ski interaction involves a region of Ski (residues 219-312) other than another region of Ski similar to that used in this study (residues 17-192) (13Wu J.W. Krawitz A.R. Chai J. Li W. Zhang F. Luo K. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the complex is a heteropentamer with a preferred stoichiometry of two subunits of S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P, two subunits of Ski-(16-192), and one subunit of S4AF (Fig. 3D).Homotrimeric S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P Interacts with CBP to Form a Heterohexamer—The analysis above showed that Ski-(16-192) bound to homotrimeric S2LC-2P and S3LC-2P as well as to heterotrimeric S2LC-2P·S4AF and S3LC-2P·S4AF. To compare the binding of Ski and CBP to Smads, the same conditions used for Ski-(16-192) were used for CBP-(1941-1992) to test its interaction with Smads.A previous study showed that the MH2 domain of R-Smads can interact with the C-terminal domain (amino acids 1891-2175) of CBP (18Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Wu et al. (13Wu J.W. Krawitz A.R. Chai J. Li W. Zhang F. Luo K. Shi Y. Cell. 2002; 111: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) identified a 26-residue sequence motif of CBP/p300 (amino acids 1955-1980) that is both necessary and sufficient to form a stable complex with R-Smads. To confirm these results, we carried out in vitro binding assays using CBP-(1911-1992), CBP-(1931-1992), and CBP-(1941-1992). An in vitro GST-mediated pulldown assay was used to confirm that CBP-(1941-1992) is sufficient to format a stable complex with the S3LC-2P homotrimer and the S3LC-2P·S4AF heterotrimer (data not shown).Because CBP-(1941-1992) was unstable, GST was required to stabilize it. Before testing the interaction of GST-CBP-(1941-1992) with Smads, it was necessary to test whether GST alone interacts with Smad2. Our results show that GST did not interact with Smad2 and Smad3 (Fig. 4B, upper panels). To further investigate whether Smads and GST-CBP-(1941-1992) interact directly in the purified state, size-exclusion chromatography and ITC were performed. GST-CBP-(1941-1992) interacted directly with S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P as judged by coelution on a size-exclusion column (Fig. 4, A and B). When mixed at a 2:1 molar ratio, a significant portion of GST-CBP-(1941-1992) co-eluted in the same fractions as trimeric S2LC-2P or S3LC-2P. The remaining uncomplexed GST-CBP-(1941-1992) eluted in a dimeric form, presumably through GST dimerization. The elution peak of the S"

Here we report regulation of major hepatic nuclear factors in human colorectal liver metastases and primary colonic cancer. Notably, the genes coding for HNF6, HNF1beta, and C/EBPgamma were selectively regulated in liver metastases. We therefore studied protein expression of regulated transcription factors and found unacetylated HNF6 to be a hallmark of colorectal liver metastases. For its known interaction with HNF6, we investigated expression of FOXA2, which we found to be specifically induced in colorectal liver metastases. By electromobility shift assay, we examined DNA binding of disease regulated transcription factors. Essentially, no HNF6 DNA binding was observed. We also searched for sequence variations in the DNA binding domains of HNF6, but did not identify any mutation. Furthermore, we probed for expression of 28 genes targeted by HNF6. Mostly transcript expression was repressed except for tumor growth. In conclusion, we show HNF6 protein expression to be driven by the hepatic environment. Its expression is not observed in healthy colon or primary colonic cancer. HNF6 DNA binding is selectively abrogated through lack of post-translational modification and interaction with FOXA2. Targeting of FOXA2 and HNF6 may therefore enable mechanism-based therapy for colorectal liver metastases."

KLF5 regulates pathological cell growth, and its acetylation is important for this effect. Its mechanisms of action, however, are still unclear. Analysis in KLF5-deficient mice showed that KLF5 confers apoptotic resistance in vascular lesions. Mechanistic analysis further showed that it specifically interacts with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), a nuclear enzyme important in DNA repair and apoptosis. KLF5 interacted with a proteolytic fragment of PARP-1, and acetylation of KLF5 under apoptotic conditions increased their affinity. Moreover, KLF5 wild-type (but not a non-acetylatable point mutant) inhibited apoptosis as induced by the PARP-1 fragment. Collectively, we have found that KLF5 regulates apoptosis and targets PARP-1, and further, for acetylation to regulate these effects. Our findings thus implicate functional interaction between the transcription factor KLF5 and PARP-1 in cardiovascular apoptosis.

The cardiovasculature adapts dynamically to metabolic and/or mechanical stresses (i.e. blood vessel remodeling in response to oxidative and hypertensive stress). Although this response initially compensates for the pathological stimulus, chronic and excessive load ultimately leads to decompensatory maladaptation, which is the underlying pathology of heart failure and atherosclerosis (1Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 2Towbin J.A. Bowles N.E. Nature. 2002; 415: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The cellular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular adaptation processes are characterized by cellular hyperplasia, hypertrophy and death. Previous studies have begun to clarify the molecular basis of the process centered on signaling pathways linking extracellular stimuli to intracellular processes characterized by the intracellular signaling cascade and downstream gene expression events, which include roles of transcription factors, such as NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) through the calcineurin pathway and histone deacetylases in cardiac hypertrophy (3Molkentin J.D.

Although the transcriptional and signaling networks regulating the cardiac adaptation response have begun to be unraveled, further investigation is needed to better understand the pathogenic roles of the involved factors and pathways. Regulation of cell death/survival, in particular, remains poorly understood. Here, we have shown that KLF5 inhibits cell death/apoptosis and that it functionally interacts with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), a nuclear enzyme involved in the response to DNA damage (11D'Amours D.

Statistical Analysis—All data were analyzed by the non-paired t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Apoptotic Resistance Is a Pathophysiological Function of KLF5—The present study began with the initial observation of an attenuated response to vascular injury in KLF5 knock-out mice subjected to a mouse femoral artery injury model (9Shindo T. Manabe I. Fukushima Y. Tobe K. Aizawa K. Miyamoto S. Kawai-Kowase K. Moriyama N. Imai Y. Kawakami H. Nishimatsu H. Ishikawa T. Suzuki T. Morita H. Maemura K. Sata M. Hirata Y. Komukai M. Kagechika H. Kadowaki T. Kurabayashi M. Nagai R. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). To understand the mechanisms underlying this effect on neointimal hyperplasia, we questioned whether cell death/apoptosis might play a pathological role, given that cellular apoptosis is a major mechanism of the wire injury model that was used (13Sata M. Maejima Y. Adachi F. Fukino K. Saiura A. Sugiura S. Aoyagi T. Imai Y. Kurihara H. Kimura K. Omata M. Makuuchi M. Hirata Y. Nagai R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 2097-2104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Analysis of apoptosis by TUNEL staining showed an increase in TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in the neointima of knock-out mice as compared with wild-type littermates (13.1 versus 1.5%) (Fig. 1, C and D). Insufficiency of KLF5 therefore resulted in decreased neointima formation most likely due to enhanced apoptotic cell death after vascular injury. To confirm that KLF5 insufficiency is associated with increased apoptosis at the cellular level, we next used an RNA interference approach to knock-down KLF5 under apoptotic stimulation (TNF-α). TUNEL staining showed an increase in positive staining cells when subjected to KLF5 small interfering RNA as compared with control small interfering RNA (secreted alkaline phosphatase) (Fig. 1, E and F). Thus, KLF5 insufficiency is associated with increased apoptosis. Cellular Apoptotic Resistance of KLF5—To characterize the apoptotic resistance mechanisms of KLF5, stable transformants (cloned) expressing KLF5 in human HeLa and murine 3T3 cells were used for further investigations. Both KLF5-expressing cells showed resistance to induced cell death by TNF-α as compared with mock cells (Fig. 2A). We then measured apoptotic caspase-3 activity, which was reduced in both KLF5-expressing cells (29% for TNF-α stimulation and 44% for anisomycin treatment in HeLa cells and 34% in 3T3 cells for TNF-α stimulation) (Fig. 2B). Further, TUNEL staining showed that KLF5-expressing cells were resistant to DNA cleavage by apoptotic stimulation as shown by quantification of TUNEL-positive cells (15% by TNF-α and 40% by anisomycin) (Fig. 2C). Thus, cells expressing KLF5 were consistently resistant to apoptosis by criteria including morphology, caspase-3 activity, and DNA cleavage (TUNEL). Apoptotic resistance was confirmed in at least two independent clones for both HeLa and NIH3T3 cells as well as in a resistance-selected heterogenous non-cloned colony (data not shown). Mechanisms of Apoptosis-resistant Activity of KLF5—Next, to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the apoptosis-resistant effects of KLF5, the expression levels of a panel of proteins related to the apoptotic signaling cascade were examined in the HeLa stable transformant with apoptotic stimulation by TNF-α. Although there were no apparent effects on the expression of most of these apoptosis-related proteins, the protein level of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) was markedly affected in KLF5-expressing cells as compared with the control (Fig. 3A). PARP-1 is a 113-kDa nuclear enzyme involved in DNA repair that catalyzes the initiation, elongation, and branching of poly(ADP-ribose) onto its target protein (11D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). PARP-1 is cleaved by caspase into a 24-kDa amino-terminal DNA-binding domain and an 89-kDa carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain under apoptotic conditions. This result was not unexpected, given that caspase cleaves PARP-1, and as caspase-3 activity was reduced in KLF5-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). RNA interference experiments confirmed involvement of PARP-1 in apoptosis of the tested HeLa cells (data not shown). Nevertheless, we further pursued actions of KLF5 on PARP-1 under apoptotic conditions given the specific effects on PARP-1. We hypothesized that PARP-1 and KLF5 might functionally interact, given that they are zinc finger proteins that often physically and functionally interact (17Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that KLF5 interacts with PARP-1, and strikingly, for this interaction to be specific with the 24-kDa fragment under apoptotic conditions (Fig. 3B). Note that loading amounts of protein were normalized to show the difference in binding affinities. KLF5 did not interact with the 89-kDa carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain under these conditions (data not shown). As these experiments were done using the stable transformant, further immunoprecipitation experiments were done to confirm interaction by endogenous proteins (Fig. 3C). Immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-KLF5 and PARP-1 antibodies confirmed that KLF5 and the PARP-1 24-kDa fragment interact in the cell. We thus sought to understand the functional implications and regulation of this interaction. Interaction between KLF5 and PARP-1—To characterize the interaction between KLF5 and PARP-1, we next examined the specificity and site of interaction. For specificity, we compared the binding of PARP-1 between KLF5 and KLF6, the latter being a similar Krüppel-like factor (18Narla G. Heath K.E. Reeves H.L. Li D. Giono L.E. Kimmelman A.C.

Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Horikoshi M. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, A and B). GST pulldown assay under conditions in which KLF5 bound the 24-kDa fragment of PARP-1 (Fig. 4B, lane 4) showed a lack of interaction with KLF6 (Fig. 4B, lane 5). Thus, interaction of KLF5 with PARP-1 was direct and specific. We further determined the site of interaction between KLF5 and PARP-1. To confirm our initial expectations that the zinc finger motif is the protein-protein interaction interface (12Miyamoto S. Suzuki T. Muto S. Aizawa K. Kimura A. Mizuno Y. Nagino T. Imai Y. Adachi N. Horikoshi M. Nagai R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8528-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), we tested whether the zinc finger 24-kDa fragment of PARP-1 directly interacts with the zinc finger DNA-binding domain of KLF5 (Fig. 4, C and D). The GST pulldown assay showed that the zinc finger region of KLF5 directly and specifically bound the 24-kDa fragment of PARP-1 (Fig. 4D, lane 4). Given that the zinc finger regions of KLF5 and PARP-1 (which mediate their interaction) comprise their DNA-binding domains, we tested the requirement of DNA by competitively adding DNA to protein interaction assays, which showed that DNA is not necessary for this interaction and for this interaction to thus be mediated by protein-protein interaction (data not shown). As the zinc finger DNA-binding domain of KLF5 contains three zinc finger motifs, we next examined whether there is specific binding of individual zinc fingers to PARP-1 (Fig. 4E). The GST pulldown assay showed the first zinc finger but not the second nor third zinc finger peptides to interact with PARP-1 (Fig. 4F, lanes 4–6). Acetylation Is Important for the Apoptosis-resistant Effects of KLF5— As the interaction with PARP-1 was mediated through the first zinc finger of KLF5 (Fig. 4F) (which contains a lysine residue whose acetylation we have previously shown to be important for the cell growth stimulatory effects of KLF5 (12Miyamoto S. Suzuki T. Muto S. Aizawa K. Kimura A. Mizuno Y. Nagino T. Imai Y. Adachi N. Horikoshi M. Nagai R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8528-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)), we next asked whether acetylation is important for apoptosis-resistant actions and interaction with PARP-1. First, we examined whether a non-acetylatable point mutant of KLF5 (K369R, lysine → arginine substitution at residue 369) would lack resistance to apoptosis. Stable transformants in 3T3 cells of wild type and that of the point mutant K369R of KLF5 were subjected to apoptotic stimulus (TNF-α), and morphology was examined in addition to quantification of caspase-3 activity and DNA cleavage. As compared with wild-type KLF5-expressing cells, cells expressing the point mutant KLF5-K369R were less viable in response to apoptotic stimulus (TNF-α)(Fig. 5, A and B). Caspase-3 and DNA cleavage assay both showed that the point mutant KLF5-K369R did not inhibit apoptosis under conditions in which KLF5 wild type showed significant inhibition. Adenoviral transfer of the wild type and point mutant K369R into balloon-injured rat cartotid arteries confirmed that the wild type but not the point mutant K369R can inhibit pathophysiological vascular apoptosis. 5D. Sawaki, T. Suzuki, and R. Nagai, unpublished data. These findings suggest acetylation of KLF5 is important for its apoptosis-resistant cellular effects. The former experiments suggested that KLF5 is likely acetylated under apoptotic conditions. To test this, Western blot analysis using antibody against acetylated lysine was done that showed KLF5 is markedly acetylated under apoptotic conditions (Fig. 5C, lane 3)), although we did see some acetylation under basal conditions (lane 2). We next asked whether acetylation might regulate interaction between KLF5 and the PARP-1 fragment. A protein-protein interaction assay using in vitro acetylated KLF5 was done that showed acetylation of KLF5 increased its binding affinity with the PARP-1 fragment (Fig. 5D, lane 4 versus lane 3), although we did note that the addition of the p300 acetyltransferase region alone resulted in a marginal increase (data not shown). We further examined whether acetylation augments interaction between KLF5 and the PARP-1 fragment in the cell. Immunoprecipitation experiments in endothelial cells transfected by adenovirus expressing similar amounts of wild-type or the point mutant KLF5-K369R followed by immunoprecipitation of similar amounts of the 24-kDa PARP-1 fragment by anti-PARP-1 antibody showed that wild-type KLF5 but not the point mutant KLF5-K369R to selectively interact with the PARP-1 24-kDa fragment (Fig. 5E, lane 2 versus lane 3). Acetylation of KLF5 is thus induced under apoptotic conditions and is important for its apoptosis-resistant activity as well as its interaction with PARP-1. We further characterized the functional effects of this selective interaction. We reasoned that wild-type but not the point mutant KLF5-K369R may inhibit apoptosis induced by the 24-kDa pro-apoptotic fragment of PARP-1 (16Yung T.M.C. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11279-11286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Kim J.W. Won J. Sohn S. Joe C.O. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 55-961Google Scholar). The 24-kDa pro-apoptotic fragment of PARP-1 and wild-type KLF5 or the point mutant KLF5-K369R were transfected into endothelial cells, and effects on apoptosis were determined by examining caspase-3 activity. Under conditions in which the 24-kDa pro-apoptotic fragment of PARP-1 stimulated apoptosis, although marginally in our hands (Fig. 5F, lane 1 versus lane 2), wild-type KLF5 inhibited caspase-3 activity in contrast to the point mutant KLF5-K369R in which suppression of caspase-3 activity was not seen (Fig. 5F, lane 3 versus lane 4). These experiments showed that wild-type KLF5 but not the point mutant KLF5-K369R can inhibit apoptotic activity as stimulated by overexpression of the 24-kDa pro-apoptotic fragment of PARP-1. Functional Interaction between KLF5 and PARP-1—The cardiovascular transcription factor, Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), inhibits cell death/apoptosis and functionally interacts with PARP-1, a highly abundant nuclear enzyme that functions as a sensor of DNA damage. To our knowledge, KLF5 is the first protein to interact specifically and functionally with the 24-kDa PARP-1 fragment. This PARP-1 fragment also, at least partially, mediates physical interaction with the Werner syndrome protein and also likely with DNA ligase III (21Schreiber V. Amé J.C. Dollé P. Schultz I.

Schreiber V. Stiegler P. Piotrowski J. Dawut L. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4003-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but neither the specificity nor the functional effect of the interaction had been addressed. The PARP-1 fragment has been reported to harbor pro-apoptotic activity (16Yung T.M.C. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11279-11286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have found that KLF5 is able to inhibit the marginal pro-apoptotic effects of the PARP-1 fragment, that KLF5 interacts with this peptide, and that acetylation of KLF5 stimulates this interaction. It is tempting to speculate that sequestration of the PARP-1 proteolytic fragment by KLF5 may be a novel target for regulation of PARP-1 actions. However, we do note that the effects of PARP-1 on apoptosis remain controversial. Gene ablation studies in mice have shown that PARP-1 is not essential for apoptosis (23De Murcia J.M. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Ricoul M. Dutrillaux B. Mark M. Oliver F.J. Masson M. Dierich A. Le Meur M. Walztinger C. Chambon P. de Murcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2347-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Additionally, cells exhibiting cleaved PARP-1 can divide normally (25Yang L. Cao Z. Yan H. Wood W.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6815-6824PubMed Google Scholar), making its instructive role in apoptosis unclear. The fragment being produced after the apoptotic commitment step of caspase activation makes it further unlikely to be a critical determinant of apoptotic progression. Further investigation of the functional effect of the interaction with KLF5 will require a better understanding on the precise role of the PARP-1 fragment. Regulatory Effects of Acetylation—Another important finding of the present study is that the signaling modification (acetylation) was shown to play an important role in the effects of KLF5 on cell death and interaction with PARP-1. Acetylation is a nucleus specific signaling modification that affects protein-protein as well as protein-DNA interactions by various nuclear factors (e.g. Armadillo and T-cell factor, Importin α and β) (26Bannister A.J. Miska E.A. Gorlich D. Kouzarides T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 467-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 27Waltzer L. Bienz M. Nature. 1998; 395: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Although the biological role of this modification is not well understood, we show that it affects multiple activities of KLF5. A recent study showed that acetylation of Sp1, a close relative of KLF5 that we previously showed to be acetylated (28Suzuki T. Muto S. Miyamoto S. Aizawa K. Horikoshi M. Nagai R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28758-28764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29Suzuki T. Aizawa K. Matsumura T. Nagai R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Further, as deacetylase (6Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) as well as acetylase and its activity (32Miyamoto S. Kawamura T. Morimoto T. Ono K. Wada H. Kawase Y. Matsumori A. Nishio R. Kita T. Hasegawa K. Circulation. 2006; 113: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have been implicated in the cardiovascular remodeling response in the heart, this signaling pathway may have general implications for regulating the cardiovascular cell phenotype in response to pathological stress. KLF5, therefore, through acting on apoptotic pathways, may tip the balance between survival/repair and death/apoptosis under cardiovascular pathophysiological settings. We thank Dr. M. Satoh for PARP-1 constructs."
https://openalex.org/W1980976063,"The existence of interactions between many cellular proteins and various polyanionic surfaces within a cell is now well established. The functional role of such interactions, however, remains to be clearly defined. The existence of protein arrays, with a large selection of different kinds of proteins, provides a way to better address a number of aspects of this question. We have therefore investigated the interaction between five cellular polyanions (actin, tubulin, heparin, heparan sulfate, and DNA) and ∼5,000 human proteins using protein microarrays in an attempt to better understand the functional nature of such interaction(s). We demonstrate that a large number of polyanion-binding proteins exist that contain multiple positively charged regions, are often disordered, are involved in phosphorylation processes, and appear to play a role in protein-protein interaction networks. Considering the crowded nature of cellular interiors, we propose that polyanion-binding proteins interact with a wide variety of polyanionic surfaces in cells in a functionally significant manner.

Considering the crowded nature of cellular interiors, we propose that polyanion-binding proteins interact with a wide variety of polyanionic surfaces in cells in a functionally significant manner. Our oldest view of cells as lipid bags filled with proteins and nucleic acids long ago gave way to a much more complex picture in which interior membranes and fibrous proteins create a large variety of unique environments that are critical for individual cellular functions. This picture continues to be refined, but the idea that lipid membranes are the most important structural components defining local environments continues. It is now established that many cellular proteins are capable of interacting with a wide variety of polyanions. We have recently suggested that both the interior and exterior polyanionic surfaces may also have an important role to play in the organization of cellular function. If one views the typically very crowded interior of a cell filled with microtubules, microfilament, ribosomes, lipid membranes, and other structures (1Medalia O. Weber I. Frangakis A.S. Nicastro D. Gerisch G. Baumeister W. Science. 2002; 298: 1209-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) in the light of the polyanionic nature of these molecular entities (2Jones L.S. Yazzie B. Middaugh C.R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 746-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the interior of cells can be seen as a highly polyanionic environment offering an extensive potential interaction surface. Most of our knowledge about polyanion-protein interactions stems from in vitro studies that have traditionally been conducted at low concentrations. Under these conditions, the effects of macromolecular crowding and the presence of polyanionic surfaces are neglected. The concept of macromolecular crowding refers to the presence of cell organelles, proteins, polysaccharides, cytoskeleton proteins, and membranes that produces severe steric confinement and a resultant high thermodynamic activity of the molecules present (3Spitzer J.J. Poolman B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 536-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 4Kurakin A. Dev. Genes Evol. 2005; 215: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When considering the large surface area and the importance of cellular polyanions such as actin, tubulin, and ribosomes in a crowded cellular environment, the nonspecific electrostatic interaction of proteins containing positively charged regions with these polyanions can be expected. In such cellular matrices, biochemical reaction rates, equilibria, and the diffusion of macromolecules as well as small compounds may be strongly influenced by other macromolecules that do not necessarily take part in more usual stereoscopically determined functional interactions (5Ellis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 6Minton A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10577-10580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 7Verkman A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 27-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). A large number of proteins are commonly recognized as “heparin-binding proteins” (8Conrad H.E. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar). Previous work has suggested that the interaction of many of these proteins with polyanions is remarkably nonspecific while maintaining high affinity. The possibility that cellular macromolecules may exert a potential stabilizing influence through nonspecific interactions with proteins in vivo has originated from in vitro observations that have shown stabilizing effects of polyanions on some proteins (9Dabora J.M. Sanyal G. Middaugh C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23637-23640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Volkin D.B. Tsai P.K. Dabora J.M. Gress J.O. Burke C.J. Linhardt R.J. Middaugh C.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These observations have suggested the idea that the extensive array of polyanions in cells might also play some type of organizing role. Functional consequences of such interactions could include the following: (a) bringing proteins together to participate in protein-protein interactions; (b) mediation of protein transport; (c) roles in protein folding as molecular chaperones and stabilizers; and (d) involvement in protein solubility-type diseases. In some cases it is well established that the interactions of proteins with polyanions involve regulatory functions (e.g. binding of growth factors to HS 2The abbreviations used are: HS, heparan sulfate; PABP, polyanion-binding protein; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PCE, protein continuum electrostatics; ORF, open reading frame. proteoglycans) (11Pellegrini L.

As mentioned above, it also appears that cellular polyanions may play a critical role in protein aggregation diseases (20Brimacombe D.B. Bennett A.D. Wusteman F.S. Gill A.C. Dann J.C. Bostock C.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Deleault N.R. Geoghegan J.C. Nishina K. Kascsak R. Williamson R.A. Supattapone S. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6473-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To test this general hypothesis, we previously examined the extent of intracellular polyanion-protein interactions. Using COS-7 cells and a combination of polyanion pulldown experiments and two-dimensional gels as well as antibody arrays, we found that hundreds to thousands of such interactions appear to take place (2Jones L.S. Yazzie B. Middaugh C.R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 746-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Many of these PABPs were identified, and recognition that a substantial number of these proteins are “natively unfolded” was noted, and the nature of typical polyanion-binding sites was better defined. In a much more detailed study, we used yeast protein arrays to identify the interaction of the polyanions actin, tubulin, heparin, HS, and DNA with thousands of proteins. An enrichment of several hundred PABPs that were unstructured as well as those possessing kinase substrate activity was observed (24Salamat-Miller N. Fang J. Seidel C.W. Smalter A.M. Assenov Y. Albrecht M. Middaugh C.R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 2263-2278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The charged nature of the polyanion-binding sites was further clarified, and a network analysis was performed. It was found that many PABPs appear to participate in a variety of cellular protein-protein interaction networks. In this study, we perform a similar analysis employing a human protein array, and we provide further evidence for the existence of an extensive role for polyanion-protein interactions in the activities of much more complex eukaryotic cells. Lyophilized G-actin from bovine muscle (43 kDa), heparin, HS from porcine intestinal mucosa with a mean molecular mass of 18 and 14 kDa, the metachromatic dye Azure A, and calf thymus double-stranded DNA were purchased from Sigma. Bovine brain tubulin (100 kDa) was a kind donation from Dr. Richard Himes, Division of Biological Sciences, University of Kansas. EZ-link biotin-LC-hydrazide, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)carbodiimide, MES, and EZ-link psoralen-PEO3-biotin were obtained from Pierce. Human protein array kits, including buffers and controls, were purchased from Invitrogen. All protein arrays were scanned using a Molecular Devices GenePix 4000B (Sunnyvale, CA) at 635 nm with 10-μm pixel size. Actin and Tubulin—Actin was dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline overnight to avoid a cross-reaction between the Tris salt contained in its lyophilized form and the biotinylation reagent. Tubulin was dialyzed against two exchanges of 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline for 3 h at 4°C. Actin and tubulin (∼2.0 mg/ml) were biotinylated according to the manufacturer's instructions using the biotin-XX-sulfosuccinimidyl ester (5 nmol/μl) included in the Invitrogen protein array kit. Excess biotin was removed using a gel filtration resin provided in the kit. The biotinylation efficiency was assessed by performing Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE and a Western blot of the biotinylated polyanions and the provided reference proteins according to standard protocols. Detection and visualization of samples were performed using a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and a chemiluminescent substrate, respectively. Heparin and HS—Compounds were dissolved in 0.1 m MES buffer to a final concentration of ∼4.0 mg/ml. The biotinylation reaction was conducted by addition of 25 μl of biotin hydrazide in dry Me2SO and 12.5 μl of freshly prepared 1-ethyl-3-(3-di-methylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, with final concentrations of 50 and 5.0 mm, respectively, to the MES/heparin or MES/HS solution. Solutions were stirred overnight at room temperature. The carbodiimide chemistry coupled biotin-LC-hydrazide to heparin and HS through uronic acids (carboxylate groups) (25Yu Q. Toole B.P. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 122-129PubMed Google Scholar). Excess biotin was removed using either dialysis cassettes (molecular weight cut-off of 3,500) or polyacrylamide desalting columns (Pierce). Biotinylation efficiency was assessed by performing a dot blot on nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Approximately 2 μl of each biotinylated sample was placed on the membrane, and the blot was air-dried. Biotinylated tubulin or bovine serum albumin (both at a molar ratio of 9:1) and nonbiotinylated polysaccharide or buffer were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. This procedure was repeated three times, followed by blocking and washing of the membrane according to the Western blot protocols. Detection and visualization of samples were performed as above. Calf Thymus DNA—A final concentration of 200 μm EZ-link psoralen-PEO3-biotin in doubly deionized H2O was added to a 1 mg/ml solution of DNA in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) after boiling and immediate cooling of the DNA solution. The reaction centrifuge tube was placed on ice and irradiated with a long wavelength UV source (Mini Ralight lamp, UVP Inc., San Gabriel, CA) for 40 min. The biotinylated solutions of DNA were stored at –20 °C. Detection and visualization of biotinylated DNA were performed through a dot-blot procedure as described above. Actin and Tubulin—Final concentrations were determined by UV absorbance spectroscopy at 290 nm for actin and 280 nm for tubulin, using extinction coefficients of 2.66 × 104 (26Apgar J. Tseng Y. Fedorov E. Herwig M.B. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1095-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and 1.15 × 105 m–1cm–1 for actin and tubulin, respectively, and a cell path length of 1.0 cm. 3T. Mitchison, personal website. Heparin and HS—For concentration determination of carbohydrates, azure A, a metachromatic dye, was utilized (27Templeton D.M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1988; 10: 131-136Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A stock solution of Azure A was prepared in 0.2% (v/v) aqueous formic acid, pH 3.5, at a final concentration of 5.04 × 10–5 m. One ml of the dye stock solution was titrated with 1–10 μl of 1.0 mg/ml carbohydrate solution prepared in phosphate-buffered saline and vortexed (28Wollin A. Jaques L.B. Thromb. Res. 1973; 2: 377-382Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The absorbance of each sample was measured at 620 nm, where the extent of disappearance of Azure A was followed as a function of carbohydrate concentration. In each case, the nonbiotinylated heparin and HS were used as standards for the biotinylated samples. The absorbance spectroscopy confirmed that Azure A was bound to both biotinylated and nonbiotinylated heparin and HS. These experiments were conducted after observing that biotinylated HS failed to bind to another metachromatic dye, 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue. This is in contrast to the nonbiotinylated form that shows binding to this dye. Calf Thymus DNA—DNA was quantified using an optical density of 1.0 for a 50 μg/ml solution at 260 nm. The human arrays employed contain 4,985 doubly spotted proteins on a proprietary polymer coating. These proteins were derived from the human Ultimate™ ORF Clone Collection (Invitrogen) and expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system as N-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (29Schweitzer B. Predki P. Snyder M. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 2190-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The human proteins are classified by the Gene Ontology consortium and contained a range of proteins from the cytoplasm, nucleus, plasma membrane, and extracellular matrix. These proteins are involved in variety of functions, including cell communications, cell growth and/or maintenance, cell proliferation, metabolism, apoptosis, development, and transcription (Fig. 1). Experiments were conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, protein arrays were probed with 120 μl of 50 μg/ml of each polyanion in the presence and absence of 0.15 m NaCl in the probing solution at pH 7.4. After subsequent washings, the arrays were exposed to streptavidin-Alexa Fluor® 647. The arrays were then washed, dried, and scanned with the GenePix® 4000B at 635 nm to acquire a fluorescence image. The resultant files were produced using GenePix® Pro 5.0 software. Each image was analyzed using the appropriate grid down-loaded from Invitrogen. For all of the scanned images, a program available through Invitrogen (ProtoArray™ Prospector, version 3.1.1) was used to obtain the identity of the proteins that demonstrated significant interaction with the probes. Interactions were considered statistically significant when they displayed a mean signal greater than the median signal of all protein spots on the array plus one times the standard deviation (+1S.D.). This +1S.D. threshold has a Z-score that is greater than 1. For such threshold values, polyanion-binding proteins with low, medium, and high confidence levels are included in the data set. Proteins that bound the polyanions at the +2 and +3S.D. level demonstrate a higher confidence level. However, we decided to generally include the greatest number of proteins involved in any type of binding to polyanions (specific or nonspecific), and we therefore chose to study PABPs at the level of +1S.D., unless otherwise indicated. An in-house MATLAB program was used to search for basic amino acids (lysine, arginine, and histidine) in human PABPs and to calculate their frequency in percent for each protein. Additionally, this program was used to analyze the percent of basic amino acids in the overall population of human proteins on the array. The sequence of each protein was supplied by Invitrogen. We employed a one sample t test to statistically analyze the results between the means of one particular amino acid percentage for proteins that interacted with the polyanionic probes (PABPs) and the same amino acid in a general population set. Similarly sized 1,000 random sets of general population proteins were generated, and the percent of basic amino acids was also calculated for these sets. In addition, we investigated whether the enrichment of positive residues was more pronounced within a sequence locally. To this end, we used a perl script to calculate the number of positive pitches in human PABPs as well as the entire protein population on the array. Positive pitches were defined as a sequence run containing three or more positive residues out of any five continuous residues. The program code for theoretical pI calculations was obtained through personal communications with the code author. 4C. Putnam, personal communication. This program was used to generate and compare the theoretical pI values for the identified set of PABPs as well as the human protein population on the array. The results of the PABPs and general population sets were compared utilizing a one-sample t test. By employing an in-house MATLAB program, the list of human PABPs generated from the human array experiments was compared with a list of human proteins with solved three-dimensional structures in ExPASY server. Consequently, a PCE web tool based on macroscopic electrostatics with atomic details was used to calculate the electrostatic surface potential of these structures. The PCE server calculates surface potentials and electrostatic energies via an infinite differences solution to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (30Miteva M.A. Tuffery P. Villoutreix B.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W372-W375Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Default values of 4.0, 80.0, and 0.1 were used for protein internal and solvent dielectric constants and ionic strength, respectively. Sequence Signature Analysis—A sequence signature is defined as a highly conserved region, a recurring theme or pattern that is found in a group of related sequences. By this definition, a sequence signature could be a protein family, functional domain, functional site, or any conserved region of unknown function. Thus, the actual physical manifestation of a signature can vary greatly in size (31Fang J. Haasl R.J. Dong Y. Lushington G.H. BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this study, signature analysis was performed for the sequences of the human PABPs binding to each polyanion probe using MEME (version 3.0.10) (32Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar). MEME implements an unsupervised learning algorithm for discovering gapless signatures in a group of related protein sequences. We chose the maximum number of signatures to be 50 and the minimum and maximum width of the signatures to range from 5 to 300 amino acids, respectively. The E value cut-off was set to 0.1 to report only statistically significant results. In addition, the type of distribution was set to 0 or 1 occurrence per sequence, and the minimum number of sites was set to 3. Therefore, only signatures that were shared by three or more PABPs were discovered by the MEME search. Sequence Signature Characterization—The consensus sequence of each signature model was searched for in all InterPro member data bases using a local version of InterProScan. Inter-Pro is an integrated collection of the most commonly used data bases of protein families, domains, and functional sites (33Mulder N.J. Apweiler R. Attwood T.K. Bairoch A. Bateman A. Binns D. Bradley P. Bork P. Bucher P. Cerutti L. Copley R. Courcelle E. Das U. Durbin R. Fleischmann W. Gough J. Haft D. Harte N. Hulo N. Kahn D. Kanapin A. Krestyaninova M. Lonsdale D. Lopez R. Letunic I. Madera M. Maslen J. McDowall J. Mitchell A. Nikolskaya A.N. Orchard S. Pagni M. Ponting C.P. Quevillon E. Selengut J. Sigrist C.J. Silventoinen V. Studholme D.J. Vaughan R. Wu C.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D201-D205Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The program InterProScan allows a user to search for sequence signatures in any number of these data bases simultaneously. The list of known human protein kinases (kinome) was obtained from the supplemental information published by Manning et al. (34Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6312) Google Scholar) and was compared with the list of human PABPs and non-PABPs (control). All of the phosphorylated proteins are represented in official gene symbol format in this data set. We used a BatchSearch tool to transform our accession numbers to gene symbols. Unfortunately, not all proteins that are represented by accession numbers possess known gene symbols. Thus, we were unable to identify gene symbols for all of the human PABPs. The statistical analysis of the results was conducted using Fisher's exact test. Phospho.ELM is an experimentally verified data base of the phosphorylation sites in eukaryotic proteins (35Diella F. Cameron S. Gemund C. Linding R. Via A. Kuster B. Sicheritz-Ponten T. Blom N. Gibson T.J. BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 79Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This data set (version 5.0) contains 2,540 substrate proteins from different species covering 7,206 phosphorylation sites at tyrosines, serines, and threonines. A query was made between proteins in this data set and the human PABPs to obtain the number of phosphorylated PABPs. A similar analysis was also performed between this data base and the entire pool of human proteins on the array. All of the phosphorylated proteins are represented in UniProt nomenclature in this data set. Accession number transformation of PABPs to this appropriate format was performed using a BatchSearch tool. The statistical analysis of the results was conducted as above using Fisher's exact test. DisEMBL was utilized for a sequence analysis of PABPs to estimate the extent of their disorderliness (36Linding R. Jensen L.J. Diella F. Bork P. Gibson T.J. Russell R.B. Structure. 2003; 11: 1453-1459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Based on artificial neural networks, which are trained on three different data sets, this program predicts several definitions of disorder. Because no formal definition for protein disorder exists, we decided to use the “hot loops” definition to calculate the percent disorderliness for human PABPs as well as non-PABPs. These loops are defined as sections of a protein with a high degree of mobility as determined from C-α temperature factors (B-factors) (36Linding R. Jensen L.J. Diella F. Bork P. Gibson T.J. Russell R.B. Structure. 2003; 11: 1453-1459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). An unpaired, two-sampled unequal variance t test was used to investigate the statistical difference between the means of percent hot loops for PABPs and non-PABPs. A human interactome was compiled by combining predicted protein-protein interactions from HiMAP from human physical protein interaction networks in IntAct, the human protein reference data base, BioGrid, and the data base of interacting proteins. Because these data sets use different accession numbers, we have converted all to NCBI Entrez Gene identifiers, leading to slightly different numbers of PABPs in the reported tables. To probe specific topological properties of sub-networks formed by PABP data sets, we investigated the number of protein-protein interactions involving at least one PABP. We constructed 50,000 random sub-networks by arbitrarily picking the same number of proteins in the respective PABP data set and including their interaction partners. This is represented as a histogram in which the horizontal axis displays the different values obtained for the number of interactions in the generated sub-networks, and the vertical axis shows how many random sub-networks contain the given number of interactions. We used the resulting histogram of the number of interactions contained in each random sub-network to estimate a p value quantifying the significance of the sub-network for the respective PABP data set. Additionally, a 95% binomial confidence interval for the p value was calculated. To give a concrete example of our analysis, there were 149 PABPs in the data set detected at the statistical level of +3S.D., and 90 of them were present in the compiled human interactome. Thus, we generated 50,000 different random sub-networks of 90 proteins and their direct interaction partners. Then we counted the protein-protein interactions in each sub-network to derive a histogram. In sub-networks formed exclusively by PABPs, we additionally investigated the number of clusters of interacting proteins, also referred to as connected components in graph theory (37Albert R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Two interacting proteins belong to the same cluster if and only if there exists a path of interactions between the proteins. Similar to the case of the topological property described above, a p value was estimated for each PABPs data set by generating 50,000 random sub-networks and computing a histogram for the number of clusters in them. Every p value estimation includes the calculation of a 95% binomial confidence interval. We have also determined the yeast homologs of human PABPs (see below). Thus, for each human PABP data set, we could use a corresponding set of homologous yeast proteins. Again, we have performed the topological analyses described above on the resulting sets of yeast proteins using the compiled yeast interactome discussed in our previous paper (24Salamat-Miller N.

Identifying Orthologs—We inquired about the PABPs, which are common between human and yeast, and used the Inparanoid data base (38O'Brien K.P. Remm M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D476-D480Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 39Remm M. Storm C.E. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar) to accomplish this task. This program detects orthologs based on all-versus-all sequence comparison between two species. The stand-alone Inparanoid program (version 1.35) was downloaded. This data base consists of 22,216 and 5,777 analyzed proteins for human and yeast, respectively. The program was used with the default settings with a score cutoff of 50 bits and a sequence overlap cutoff of 0.5. The ortholog sequence pairs with a bootstrap value of 100% and a score of 1.00"
https://openalex.org/W1992755274,"Rapsyn, a cytoplasmic receptor-associated protein, is required for the clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Although AChR dynamics have been extensively studied, little is known about the dynamics of rapsyn. Here, we used a rapsyn-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein and quantitative fluorescent imaging to study the dynamics of rapsyn in transfected C2C12 myotubes. First, we found that rapsyn-GFP expression at clusters did not alter AChR aggregation, function, or turnover. Quantification of rapsyn immunofluorescence indicated that the expression of rapsyn-GFP proteins at clusters does not increase the overall rapsyn density compared with untransfected myotube clusters. Using time lapse imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we demonstrated that the recovery of rapsyn-GFP fluorescence at clusters was very fast, with a halftime of about ∼1.5 h (∼3 times faster than AChRs). Inhibition of protein kinase C significantly altered receptor insertion, but it had no effect on rapsyn insertion. When cells were treated with the broad spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine, receptor insertion was decreased even further. However, inhibition of protein kinase A had no effect on insertion of either rapsyn or receptors. Finally, when cells were treated with neural agrin, rapsyn and AChRs were both directed away from preexisting clusters and accumulated together in new small clusters. These results demonstrate the remarkable dynamism of rapsyn, which may underlie the stability and maintenance of the postsynaptic scaffold and suggest that the insertion of different postsynaptic proteins may be operating independently.

These results demonstrate the remarkable dynamism of rapsyn, which may underlie the stability and maintenance of the postsynaptic scaffold and suggest that the insertion of different postsynaptic proteins may be operating independently. The efficacy of synaptic transmission depends upon the high density and number of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors at sites of neurotransmitter release (1Carroll R.C. Zukin R.S.

Neurosci. 2001; 2: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). This density can be maintained in several ways. For example, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events mediated by different kinases are able to alter receptor synthesis and dynamics (2Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Nat. Rev.

Among the molecules involved in the clustering of AChRs 2The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; BTX, bungarotoxin; BTX-488, bungarotoxin-Alexa 488. 2The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; BTX, bungarotoxin; BTX-488, bungarotoxin-Alexa 488. is rapsyn. Rapsyn (43 kDa) was initially purified from the torpedo electric organ and is thought to be associated with AChRs in a 1:1 stoichiometry at the muscle surface (12Frail D.E. McLaughlin L.L. Mudd J. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15602-15607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Noakes P.G. Phillips W.D. Hanley T.A. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Rapsyn is responsible for mediating the effect of agrin, a neuronal clustering factor that activates the muscle-specific kinase and initiates AChR clustering in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner (14Apel E.D.

In mice lacking rapsyn, receptor clustering does not occur, and neuromuscular junctions fail to form (19Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Mudd J. Nichol M. Chu G.C. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Nature. 1995; 377: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Rapsyn mutations also cause AChR deficiency in patients with congenital myasthenia syndrome (20Muller J.S. Baumeister S.K.

Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of rapsyn for the formation and organization of the postsynaptic receptor density. Although the availability of highly specific receptor ligands has enabled the study of AChR dynamics on the living muscle in vitro and in vivo (23Bruneau E.G. Macpherson P.C. Goldman D. Hume R.I. Akaaboune M. Dev. Biol. 2005; 288: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Akaaboune M. Culican S.M. Turney S.G. Lichtman J.W. Science. 1999; 286: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), the study of scaffolding protein dynamics at postsynaptic density has been hindered by their inaccessibility to extracellular ligands.In this study, we investigated the dynamics of rapsyn at individual clusters on cultured myotubes. Our interest specifically in rapsyn stems from its close association with AChRs and its role in receptor clustering at the postsynaptic membrane. By monitoring the fluorescence of rapsyn-GFP fusion proteins clustered on the surface of transfected C2C12 myotubes, we were able to determine that rapsyn is markedly more dynamic than AChRs and is not affected by pharmacological manipulation that alters AChR dynamics, although both rapsyn and AChRs are similarly modulated by the nerve clustering factor, agrin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGFP Fusion Construct—The rapsyn-GFP fusion construct was kindly provided by Dr. Jonathan Cohen (Harvard Medical School).Cell Culture—To generate laminin-coated dishes, 5 μg/ml polyornithine (Sigma) was added to 35-mm culture dishes and allowed to evaporate overnight. The following day, 10 μg/ml of EHS laminin (Invitrogen) in L-15 medium supplemented with 0.2% sodium bicarbonate was added to the dishes, and they were placed in an incubator overnight until ready for plating. C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were plated and then grown in 20% fetal bovine serum with penicillin and streptomycin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were transfected at 70–100% confluence with 1 μg of rapsyn-GFP using FUGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were then differentiated by replacing the fetal bovine serum solution with 5% horse serum medium with penicillin and streptomycin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Medium was changed every 2 days, and cells were imaged 3–4 days after differentiation.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Transfected myotubes were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and then treated for 20 min with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered solution. Cells were then incubated with mouse anti-rapsyn primary (monoclonal antibody 1234; Sigma) and goat anti-mouse Alexa 594 secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). After extensive washing, cells were imaged. Background fluorescence was approximated by selecting a boundary region around the cluster and subtracting it from the original image, and the mean of the total fluorescence intensity (which corresponds to density) was measured. Image analysis was performed by using a procedure written for Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick, MA) (25Martinez-Pena y Valenzuela I. Hume R.I. Krejci E. Akaaboune M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The acquisition and quantification of images were done with the experimenter blind to rapsyn-GFP expression at each cluster.Electrophysiology—A rapsyn-GFP-transfected myotube was located, and a whole cell patch clamp recording was obtained under voltage clamp. The AChR agonist carbachol (100 μm) was then ejected into the medium with a puffer pipette placed near the patched cell, and the resulting inward current was measured. As a control for the specificity of carbachol, the AChR antagonist curare (10 μm) was applied by perfusion into the cell medium to block these inward currents. Measurements were made as above on untransfected myotubes for comparison.Receptor Loss—AChR loss was determined by labeling AChRs of untransfected myotubes or myotubes expressing rapsyn-GFP with bungarotoxin-Alexa 594 (5 μg/ml, 1 h). Initial images of rapsyn-GFP and/or clustered receptors were taken, and 4 h later, the same clusters were found and reimaged. The loss of fluorescence was then assayed using quantitative fluorescence imaging (24Akaaboune M. Culican S.M. Turney S.G. Lichtman J.W. Science. 1999; 286: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 26Turney S.G. Culican S.M. Lichtman J.W. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1996; 64: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Clusters expressing different levels of GFP were then grouped into three categories according to mean GFP expression: low (0–25th percentile of mean fluorescence), medium (26–49th percentile), and high (50–100th percentile).Fluorescent Recovery after Photobleaching—To determine the insertion of rapsyn into receptor clusters over time, the green fluorescence at individual rapsyn-GFP-expressing clusters was removed by illuminating the cluster with an argon laser passed through a neutral density filter that blocked 50% of the light. Laser illumination of myotube clusters has been shown previously not to affect receptor dynamics or muscle cell integrity (8Akaaboune M. Grady R.M. Turney S. Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Neuron. 2002; 34: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 23Bruneau E.G. Macpherson P.C. Goldman D. Hume R.I. Akaaboune M. Dev. Biol. 2005; 288: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The recovery of fluorescence was assayed, and the amount of fluorescence recovered at each cluster was measured.To determine the insertion of AChRs into clusters over time, receptors on untransfected myotubes were saturated with bungarotoxin-Alexa 488 (BTX-488) (5 μg/ml, 1 h) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and the green fluorescence was completely removed with an argon laser. Since newly synthesized receptors inserted into the cluster over time were unlabeled, BTX-488 was then added before each time point to label these receptors, excess BTX-488 was washed away, and the clusters were again imaged (as described by Bruneau et al. (23Bruneau E.G. Macpherson P.C. Goldman D. Hume R.I. Akaaboune M. Dev. Biol. 2005; 288: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)). In this way, the total insertion of receptors (both previously labeled receptors that had laterally migrated into the cluster and the newly labeled receptors that had been inserted into the cluster) could be determined and compared with the insertion and lateral migration of rapsyn-GFP. For the purposes of this paper, “insertion” will refer to the accumulation of proteins at clusters both through direct incorporation from intracellular locations and from the lateral migration of surface-associated proteins.Agrin Treatment—To determine the effect of agrin on rapsyn-GFP expression at clusters, myotubes grown on laminin-coated dishes transfected with rapsyn-GFP were incubated with BTX-594 to label all AChRs. After initial images were taken, 100 ng/ml C-terminal agrin (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added to the culture dish. At 4 and 8 h, images were taken to determine the location of rapsyn-GFP and AChRs.Kinase Inhibition—To determine the effect of various kinase inhibitors on rapsyn-GFP insertion over time, the GFP signal from clusters on myotubes transfected with rapsyn-GFP was carefully removed with an argon laser, and one of the following drugs was added to the medium: 100 nm H-89 (to block PKA), 20 μm H-89 (to inhibit both PKA and PKC), 10 nm calphostin C (to inhibit PKC), or 20 nm staurosporine (to block a broad spectrum of kinases, including PKA and PKC) (drug specificity obtained from the manufacturer, Sigma). Images were taken immediately before and after photobleaching, and 4 h later, the same clusters were reimaged, and the fluorescent intensity at bleached and nonbleached clusters was determined. Rapsyn-GFP recovery was determined by comparing the GFP signal at bleached clusters after 4 h with their fluorescence immediately prior to bleaching. Since the expression of rapsyn-GFP was variable over time and between different myotubes in these experiments, rapsyn-GFP insertion at each cluster was normalized to the changes in expression (if any) at control, unbleached clusters on the same myotube. Overall changes in expression in each culture dish were comparable across all treatment groups.We also performed a series of experiments to determine the loss and insertion of receptors at individual clusters in the presence of the same pharmacological agents. To measure the insertion rate of receptors, untransfected myotubes were saturated with BTX-488 (5 μg/ml, 1 h), and the fluorescence was carefully removed from individual clusters with an argon laser. Initial images were taken, and one of the above kinase inhibitors was added to the cultures. Four hours later, after incubating with new BTX-488 to label new receptors inserted since initial imaging, the same clusters were found and imaged. The insertion of AChRs was determined by comparing cluster fluorescence at 4 h with the original fluorescence prior to bleaching.To measure the loss rate of receptors, untransfected myotubes were saturated with BTX-488 (5 μg/ml, 1 h), and individual clusters were immediately imaged and incubated with one of the above mentioned inhibitors. The same clusters were then reimaged 4 h later, and their fluorescence intensity was measured.RESULTSRapsyn-GFP Does Not Affect Acetylcholine Receptor Clustering, Function, or Removal Rate—First, in order to verify that rapsyn-GFP was able to localize to laminin-associated AChR clusters on our cultured myotubes, we transiently transfected C2C12 myoblasts with a rapsyn-GFP fusion protein (27Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Three to four days after differentiation into myotubes, cultured cells were bathed with bungarotoxin conjugated to Alexa 594 (BTX-594) to label AChRs, and receptor clusters were imaged. Rapsyn-GFP clusters were found to always perfectly co-localize with AChRs (Fig. 1A).We also wanted to determine if the insertion and accumulation of rapsyn-GFP at laminin-induced receptor clusters affected AChR function. To examine this question, we compared inward current across the muscle membrane in response to the application of the AChR agonist, carbachol, on myotubes expressing rapsyn-GFP and nontransfected myotubes. Under direct visual control, we obtained a whole cell patch on a myotube, clamped voltage, and stimulated with carbachol. We found that the inward currents were similar in both transfected and untransfected cells and were both completely blocked by the addition of the AChR antagonist curare (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the surface expression of rapsyn-GFP does not disrupt receptor function.Next, we asked whether the overall density of rapsyn molecules at clusters (endogenous rapsyn plus exogenous rapsyn-GFP) was increased by rapsyn-GFP expression in transfected myotubes. To examine this, myotube cultures that were transfected with rapsyn-GFP were fixed and permeabilized and then immunostained with an anti-rapsyn antibody. We used an anti-rapsyn antibody that has been shown previously to recognize both rapsyn and rapsyn-GFP fusion proteins (28Gervasio O.L. Phillips W.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 562: 673-685Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since transfection efficiency of myotubes in each culture dish was variable, we were able to use the same culture dish to determine the relative number of rapsyn molecules at nontransfected clusters and at rapsyn-GFP-expressing clusters over a wide range of expression levels (Fig. 1C). Quantitative analysis of the mean fluorescence intensity of anti-rapsyn immunostaining revealed that the average density of total rapsyn at rapsyn-GFP-expressing clusters was 12.5 ± 3.2 (S.D.) (arbitrary units), n = 198. This is nearly identical to the density at clusters containing only endogenous rapsyn (11.8 ± 3.2 (S.D., n = 123) (Fig. 1, C–E). Even over a nearly 10-fold range of rapsyn-GFP expression at clusters, the difference in total rapsyn density was negligible (Fig. 1E). It is possible that the number of rapsyn-GFP molecules at transfected clusters is negligible compared with the total number of endogenous rapsyn molecules. In this case, the presence of exogenous rapsyn-GFP would not detectably alter overall rapsyn density. Alternatively, it is possible that exogenous rapsyn-GFP replaces the endogenous rapsyn, allowing overall rapsyn density at clusters to remain constant (see “Discussion”).Finally, we wanted to determine whether rapsyn-GFP expression levels at clusters had any effect on AChR stability. To do this, transfected myotubes were saturated with BTX-594, and receptor loss was monitored at clusters expressing low, medium, and high levels of rapsyn-GFP on two separate myotube cultures. After 4 h, we found that 65 ± 15% (S.D., n = 29) of fluorescently labeled AChRs remained at clusters expressing low rapsyn-GFP fluorescence, 60 ± 13% (S.D, n = 42) remained at clusters expressing medium rapsyn-GFP, and 62 ± 15% (S.D., n = 44) remained at clusters expressing high rapsyn-GFP. These results are similar to fluorescence remaining after 4 h at AChR clusters expressing no rapsyn-GFP (63 ± 17% (S.D., n = 77)) (Fig. 2, A–C). This indicates that rapsyn-GFP expression has no effect on AChR stability in our culture system.FIGURE 2The cluster expression of rapsyn-GFP has no effect on AChR removal. Nontransfected myotubes and myotubes transfected with rapsyn-GFP were labeled with BTX-Alexa 594, and the loss of AChR-BTX-594 was monitored over 4 h. A, example of clustered AChRs on rapsyn-GFP transfected myotubes that were labeled with BTX-594, imaged, and imaged again 4 h later to determine the receptor loss rate. B, clustered AChRs on untransfected myotubes were labeled as above and also followed over 4 h. C, histogram summarizes data obtained from many clusters on transfected and untransfected myotubes. Note that the change in fluorescently labeled AChR levels monitored over 4 h on untransfected myotubes and at myotube clusters expressing a wide range of rapsyn-GFP were not significantly different (p > 0.3). All values represent mean ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recovery Rate of Rapsyn-GFP at Individual Myotube Clusters— Having found that rapsyn-GFP has no effect on the clustering, function, or turnover of AChRs, we wanted to determine the lifetime of rapsyn at individual clusters. To do this, transfected myotubes expressing rapsyn-GFP were imaged, and then the GFP at individual clusters was removed with an argon laser. Confirmation of the removal of fluorescence was done by acquiring a second image (Fig. 3A). We then monitored the recovery of fluorescence at bleached clusters over time from a number of cultures (data from 3–5 culture dishes at each time point). We found that rapsyn clusters recovered fluorescence very rapidly, gaining 61 ± 11% (S.D., n = 40) of original fluorescence after only 2 h, 71 ± 19% (S.D., n = 56) after 4 h, and 75 ± 18% (S.D., n = 58) after 6 h (Fig. 3, A and B). The recovery at each data point was nearly identical for rapsyn-GFP clusters from myotubes not grown on laminin (2 h: 63 ± 12% (S.D., n = 35); 4 h: 73 ± 17% (S.D., n = 15); 6 h: 78 ± 21% (S.D., n = 33)) (Fig. 3, A and B). This recovery was not due to reversible bleaching of GFP, because no fluorescence was observed after bleaching rapsyn-GFP clusters on fixed myotubes. In addition, we found that the recovery of rapsyn-GFP over 4 h was not affected by rapsyn-GFP expression levels (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Rapsyn is inserted rapidly into individual clusters. A, the insertion of rapsyn-GFP into individual clusters on myotubes grown either on laminin-coated dishes or uncoated dishes was measured by determining the fluorescent recovery after photobleaching using quantitative fluorescent imaging. The insertion of rapsyn-GFP into bleached laminin-associated clusters (top panels) and nonlaminin clusters (middle panels) is rapid and nearly identical over 2 h in both cases. In contrast, acetylcholine receptor clusters that were labeled with bungarotoxin-Alexa 488, bleached, and then incubated in new bungarotoxin-488 (bottom panels) show far fewer inserted AChRs over the same time period. B, graph summarizes the data from the recovery of rapsyn and AChRs at 2, 4, and 6 h time points. C, the rate of rapsyn-GFP insertion is independent of the level of rapsyn-GFP expression. D, sample images from a time lapse experiment in which the fluorescent recovery at a number of clusters was determined every 15 min for 60 min. E, results from three experiments performed as in D (n = 15 clusters). Note that the recovery of fluorescence is >25% after 1 h, although cells were maintained at room temperature for the duration of the experiment. All graph points for B and E represent mean ± S.E., and all data were fit well by single exponential curves. Scale bars, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given this rapid rate of rapsyn insertion and past reports suggesting that rapsyn is co-transported with AChRs to the cell surface (29Marchand S. Bignami F. Stetzkowski-Marden F. Cartaud J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 521-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Marchand S. Devillers-Thiery A. Pons S. Changeux J.P. Cartaud J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8891-8901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to determine the rate of AChR insertion into individual clusters using the same fluorescence recovery after photobleaching method. To do this, myotubes were bathed with a single saturating dose of BTX-488, and then all fluorescence was carefully removed from individual clusters with an argon laser. After 2, 4, or 6 h, a second dose of BTX-488 was added to label all AChRs that had been inserted into clusters over this time. We found that 15 ± 4% (S.D., n = 30) of original fluorescence was returned to the clusters after 2 h, 25 ± 7% (S.D., n = 54) after 4 h, and 28 ± 9% (S.D., n = 39) after 6 h (data obtained from 3–5 cultures per data point) (Fig. 3, A and B). The number of AChR molecules inserted over time was therefore significantly lower than the number of rapsyn-GFP molecules inserted over the same time period (see “Discussion”).Given the large amount of rapsyn-GFP recovery during the first 2 h, we wanted to monitor more closely the insertion of rapsyn-GFP immediately after photobleaching. To do this, rapsyn-GFP clusters on transfected myotubes were bleached, and time lapse imaging was used to monitor the fluorescent recovery every 15 min at room temperature. We found that rapsyn-GFP recovery was 11 ± 4, 17 ± 5, 23 ± 9, and 27 ± 11% at 15, 30, 45, and 60 min (S.D., n = 15 clusters/3 culture dishes) (Fig. 3, D and E). The rapid recovery of fluorescence observed in clusters is not due to reversible bleaching of the fluorophore, since rapsyn-GFP clusters on fixed myotubes that are bleached show no spontaneous fluorescence recovery, even over days (data not shown). We also found that the labeling of AChRs with BTX-647 had no effect on rapsyn insertion dynamics, since rapsyn insertion measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was identical at rapsyn-GFP-expressing clusters that were not labeled with any BTX and at rapsyn-GFP-expressing clusters that were saturated with BTX-647 prior to photobleaching (data not shown).The Clustering of AChRs and Rapsyn Are Altered Similarly by Agrin Treatment—In order to determine if rapsyn and AChRs are regulated similarly despite the difference in dynamics, we attempted to manipulate AChR stability and insertion using the neuronal clustering factor, agrin. Our previous results showed that when agrin was added to myotubes grown on a laminin substrate, most new receptors were not directed into preexisting laminin-induced clusters but instead formed numerous small aggregates on the entire muscle surface (23Bruneau E.G. Macpherson P.C. Goldman D. Hume R.I. Akaaboune M. Dev. Biol. 2005; 288: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Since rapsyn is required for the clustering of AChRs, and its interaction with the receptor is highly regulated and increased by agrin (31Moransard M. Borges L.S. Willmann R. Marangi P.A. Brenner H.R. Ferns M.J. Fuhrer C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7350-7359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we wanted to know whether newly inserted rapsyn molecules are also directed away from preexisting laminin-associated clusters and into new, agrin-induced clusters when agrin is added to the cultures. To investigate this issue, transfected myotubes expressing rapsyn-GFP were labeled with BTX-594, imaged, treated with agrin, and then imaged again 4 and 8 h later. Over the time course of our study, we found that rapsyn clustering was altered similarly to AChRs, being directed away from the same regions on laminin-associated clusters and inserted into the same agrin-induced clusters (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Agrin redirects both AChRs and rapsyn away from preexisting laminin clusters and into new agrin-induced clusters. Myotubes expressing rapsyn-GFP were incubated with BTX-594 to label all AChRs. Agrin was then added to the culture medium, and rapsyn and receptors were imaged 4 and 8 h later. Note that both AChRs and rapsyn were directed away from some locations on the preexisting laminin-associated clusters (arrowheads) and were also aggregated"
https://openalex.org/W2075211054,"ERp57, a member of the protein-disulfide isomerase family, although mainly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum is here shown to have a nuclear distribution. We previously showed the DNA-binding properties of ERp57, its association with the internal nuclear matrix, and identified the C-terminal region, containing the a′ domain, as being directly involved in the DNA-binding activity. In this work, we demonstrate that its DNA-binding properties are strongly dependent on the redox state of the a′ domain active site. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments on the first cysteine residue of the -CGHC-thioredoxin-like active site lead to a mutant domain (C406S) lacking DNA-binding activity. Biochemical studies on the recombinant domain revealed a conformational change associated with the redox-dependent formation of a homodimer, having two disulfide bridges between the cysteine residues of two a′ domain active sites. The formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges rather than intramolecular oxidation of active site cysteines is important to generate species with DNA-binding properties. Thus, in the absence of any dedicated motif within the protein sequence, this structural rearrangement might be responsible for the DNA-binding properties of the C-terminal domain. Moreover, NADH-dependent thioredoxin reductase is active on intermolecular disulfides of the a′ domain, allowing the control of dimeric protein content as well as its DNA-binding activity. A similar behavior was also observed for whole ERp57.

As for PDI, ERp57 consists of four domains named a, b, b′, and a′, with a and a′ containing the thioredoxin-like active site sequence WCGHCK, whereas domains b and b′ are redox inactive (4Ferrari D.M.

Physiol. 2002; 193: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Although not associated to a direct experimental observation, ERp57 occurrence in the nucleus was derived from its isolation from the internal nuclear matrix of chicken hepatocytes (24Altieri F. Maras B. Eufemi M. Ferraro A. Turano C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 992-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), from nuclei of spermatidis and spermatozoa (25Othani H. Wakui H. Ishino T. Komatsuda A. Miura A.B. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as well as from the nuclear fraction of lymphocytes and monocytes (26Gerner C. Holzmann K. Meissner M. Gotzmann J. Grimm R. Sauermann G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 145-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, ERp57 was found complexed to DNA in a variety of mammalian cell nuclei by the use of in vivo cross-linking agents (acting on intact cultured cells) such as UV radiation, cis-platinum (27Coppari S. Altieri F. Ferraro A. Chichiarelli S. Eufemi M. Turano C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and formaldehyde (28Eufemi M. Coppari S. Altieri F. Grillo C. Ferraro A. Turano C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, ERp57 was found in a multiprotein nuclear complex, also containing high mobility group proteins B1/B2, involved in the recognition of damaged DNA (29Krynetski E.Y. Krynetskaia N.F. Bianchi M.E. Evans W.E. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 100-106PubMed Google Scholar). ERp57 has been found in the cytosol, associated with nuclear protein STAT3 in HepB2 cells (30Ndubuisi M.I. Guo G.G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25499-25509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and with the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (31Wyse B. Ali N. Ellison D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F424-F430Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Its presence in the cytosol provides further evidence that this protein can escape, in a still unknown way, from ER. In this case, its import into the nucleus may be related to the occurrence of a nuclear localization signal at the protein C-terminal region. ERp57 showed in vitro DNA-binding properties that are strongly dependent on the protein redox state, the oxidized form being the competent one (27Coppari S. Altieri F. Ferraro A. Chichiarelli S. Eufemi M. Turano C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 32Ferraro A. Altieri F. Coppari S. Eufemi M. Chichiarelli S. Turano C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A study on intact recombinant protein and several deletion mutants, all obtained as glutathione S-transferase-fused products expressed in Escherichia coli, led us to identify the C-terminal a′ domain as being responsible for ERp57 DNA-binding activity (33Grillo C. Coppari S. Turano C. Altieri F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Today, the molecular basis of ERp57-DNA interaction remains unknown, as well as its correlation with the reductase activity and other biological functions. To gain a more detailed understanding of the biological role of ERp57, the C-terminal domain and a site-specific mutant were expressed and investigated for their biochemical and spectroscopic properties, in relation to structural changes induced by different redox states. This study provides information suggesting ERp57-specific functions within the nuclear compartment in relation with its redox activity and DNA-binding properties. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of the C-terminal Domain of ERp57—The coding sequence of the ERp57 C-terminal region (residues 377–505) containing the a′ domain was amplified from a plasmid containing the full-length cDNA of human ERp57, as previously described (33Grillo C. Coppari S. Turano C. Altieri F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Reaction was performed using two synthetic primers flanking the domain coding region. The forward primer P1 (CCGGATCCCCTGTGAAGGTAGTGGTAG) contained a BamHI site; the reverse primer P2 (CCGAATTCTGCTTTAGAGATCCTCCTGTGC) contained an EcoRI site. PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and the amplified DNA fragment was purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and then ligated into BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pET29a vector (Novagen). Cloning was performed in the JM109 E. coli by standard procedures (34Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and, after confirmation by sequencing, the protein was expressed in BL21 E. coli. Transformed cells were grown in 2YT medium containing 0.03 mg/ml kanamycin at 30 °C with shaking until the A600 reached 0.6 OD. Cell induction was obtained with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, at 30 °C, for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in NEN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA) containing 5 mm DTT, 0.25% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell suspension was lysed by sonication and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The fraction from 30 to 75% saturation was redissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm NaCl and dialyzed against the same buffer. Proteins were loaded onto a MacroPrep Q column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm NaCl and eluted with the same buffer. The flow-through fraction was collected and loaded onto a heparin column (Affi-Prep Heparin, Bio-Rad) eluted with 15 volumes of a linear 40–1000 mm NaCl gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl. The protein was further purified on a heparin column using a narrow NaCl gradient, dialyzed, and finally concentrated by using a Vivaspin concentrator (VivaScience). The residue numbers of ERp57 here reported refer to the human cDNA sequence, including the N-terminal signal peptide. Recombinant protein contained a N-terminal pre-sequence coded by the pET29 vector, useful for obtaining fully soluble products. Site-directed Mutagenesis on the C-terminal Domain of ERp57—The ERp57 C-terminal domain was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to convert the first cysteine residue of the thioredoxin-like active site in a serine one (C406S mutant). Preparation of the C406S mutant was performed by overlap extension (35Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar), using three PCR and four primers. Primers P1 and P2 were the same as reported above, whereas primers P3 (GCCCCTTGGTCTGGTCATTGTAAG) and P4 (CTTACAATGACCAGACCAAGGGGC) were complementary, overlapping the mutation site and containing the base substitution. At first, two different PCR were used to amplify the pSVL-ERp57 vector producing two DNA fragments partially overlapping. Fragment A, corresponding to the coding region of the C-terminal domain from the beginning to the mutation site, was amplified by using primers P1 and P4. Fragment B, corresponding to the coding region of the C-terminal domain from the mutation site to the C-terminal end, was amplified by using primers P2 and P3. Amplified DNA fragments were purified and used in a third PCR using primers P1 and P2 to produce the DNA fragment C coding for the mutated C-terminal domain. Amplified DNA was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and then ligated into BamHI and EcoRI sites of pET29a vector. Mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. All PCR were performed with a proofreading enzyme (AqquTaq La Polymerase, Sigma) and for a limited number of amplification cycles. Protein corresponding to the C406S mutant contained, as the wild type domain, a N-terminal pre-sequence coded by the pET29 vector and was expressed and purified as described above. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Mobility shift assay was performed with a 79-bp AT-rich DNA fragment, obtained by PCR as previously described (33Grillo C. Coppari S. Turano C. Altieri F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and with a 34-bp AT-rich DNA (GGGATCCTTTAAAATTGGAAAAAATTTGGATCCC) obtained by annealing two complementary synthetic oligonucleotides. DNA binding was performed in a 20-μl incubation mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 ng of DNA and different amounts of protein. Binding mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C and then resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer (22.5 mm Tris borate, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). After electrophoretic separation, performed at 180 V, the gels were stained for 30 min in TBE buffer containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide and images were recorded by a Kodak Image System equipped with a 304-nm UV lamp. Quantification of Free Thiol Groups—Analysis of free thiol groups in ERp57 was carried out by Ellmans reagent (36Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 74: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). A 50-μl aliquot of protein (1 mg/ml concentration) was added to 1 ml of 150 μm 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) SDS. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the absorbance at 412 nm was recorded; the amount of free thiol groups was determined using a fresh solution of reduced glutathione to generate a standard curve. Alkylation of Protein Samples with Iodoacetamide—Wild type C-terminal domain and C406S mutant (200 μg) were denatured in 6 m guanidinium chloride, 0.25 m Tris-HCl, 1.25 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, in the absence of reducing agents, and quickly alkylated by the addition of iodoacetamide (1.1 m final concentration) at room temperature for 1 min, in the dark (37Vilardo P. Scaloni A. Amodeo P. Barsotti C. Cecconi I. Cappiello M. Lopez Mendez B. Rullo R. Dal Monte M. Del Corso A. Mura U. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11985-11994Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Protein samples were freed from salt and reagent excess by passing the reaction mixture through an analytical Vydac C4 column using an isocratic elution of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid for 35 min and then a linear gradient from 0 to 60% (v/v) of acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid over a period of 45 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Protein samples were manually collected and freeze-dried. Enzymatic Hydrolysis and Peptide Purification—Trypsin digestion was performed by incubating carboxyamidomethylated wild type C-terminal domain and C406S mutant samples (100 μg) at 37 °C overnight in 0.4% ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, at a enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100. Aliquots of the digest were directly separated on a narrow bore Vydac C18 column using a linear gradient from 5 to 70% (v/v) of acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, over a period of 65 min, at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Peptides were manually collected and further analyzed. Mass Spectrometry—Accurate molecular mass of protein and peptide samples was measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a Voyager DE MALDI-TOF instrument (Applied Biosystems) in a linear mode. Samples were loaded on the instrument target, using the dried droplet techniques and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. Mass calibration was performed using the molecular ions from different internal standards added to each sample. Data were reported as average values. Peptides were identified within the ERp57 sequence on the basis of their molecular mass and enzyme specificity. Protein Sequencing—Automated N-terminal degradation of the purified peptides was performed using a Procise 491 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a 140C microgradient apparatus and a 785A UV detector (Applied Biosystems) for the automated identification of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives. Cystine-containing peptides were analyzed according to Ref. 38Haniu M. Acklin C. Kenney W. Rohde M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1994; 43: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar. Spectroscopic Techniques—All spectroscopic measurements were performed with a solution of the C-terminal domain initially reduced with 25 mm DTT, for 30 min at room temperature, and then re-oxidized throughout prolonged dialysis either in 5 mm Mes, 10 mm NaCl, pH 6.5 (buffer at pH 6.5), or 5 mm Hepes, 10 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 (buffer at pH 8.0). The C406S mutant was analyzed after dialysis in buffer at pH 6.5 and 8.0. Intrinsic fluorescence emission and light scattering measurements were carried out with a LS50B PerkinElmer spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), using a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette. Fluorescence emission spectra (300–450 nm and 1-nm sampling interval) were recorded at 20 °C and at a protein concentration of 0.12 mg/ml, with the excitation wavelength set at 295 nm. Light scattering was measured at 20 °C with both excitation and emission wavelengths set at 480 nm. Far UV CD spectra of the C-terminal domain and C406S mutant were recorded in a 0.1-cm quartz cuvette at 0.12 mg/ml protein concentration (200–250 nm) and in a 0.01-cm quartz cuvette at 1.5 mg/ml protein concentration (190–250 nm). Measurements were performed in both conditions to check if protein concentrations could have an effect on the dichroic activity; no differences were observed in the 200–250-nm region and only the spectra recorded in the 0.01-cm cuvette were reported. Near UV CD (250–350 nm) spectra of the C-terminal domain and the C406S mutant were recorded in a 1.0-cm quartz cuvette at 1.5 mg/ml protein concentration. All CD spectra were recorded at 20 °C on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. The results are expressed as the mean residue ellipticity assuming a mean residue weight of 110 per amino acid residue. In all the spectroscopic measurements 100 μm EDTA was present unless otherwise stated. UV-visible spectra were recorded with a double-beam Lambda 16 PerkinElmer spectrometer equipped with a Peltier thermocontroller set at 20 °C. Experiments with the fluorescent dye anilinonaphtalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS) were performed at 20 °C by adding ANS (50 μm) to a solution of the C-terminal domain (0.08 mg/ml) reduced and then re-oxidized either in buffer at pH 6.5 or 8.0, and to a solution of the C406S mutant (0.08 mg/ml). After 5 min, fluorescence emission spectra (400–600 nm) were recorded with the excitation wavelength set at 390 nm. Maximum fluorescence emission wavelength and intensity of the hydrophobic probe ANS depend on the environmental polarity, e.g. on the hydrophobicity of protein accessible surface (39Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas' A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). Fluorescence quenching was carried out by adding increasing amounts of acrylamide (0–100 mm) to a solution of the C-terminal domain (0.1 mg/ml) re-oxidized either in buffer at pH 6.5 or 8.0. Emission spectra (300–450 nm) were recorded at 20 °C, 10 min after each acrylamide addition with the excitation wavelength set at 290 nm. The effective quenching constants were obtained from modified Stern-Vollmer plots by analyzing F0/ΔF versus 1/[acrylamide] (25 data points) (40Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Human ERp57—The DNA fragment coding for mature human ERp57, devoid of the N-terminal pre-sequence (residues 1–24) and obtained by BamHI and EcoRI digestion of the pGEX-2T-ERp57 plasmid (33Grillo C. Coppari S. Turano C. Altieri F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), was inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pTriEx-1.1 vector (Novagen) giving the pTriEx-1.1-ERp57 vector. The protein was expressed in BL21 E. coli and purified as previously described (41Grillo C. D'Ambrosio C. Scaloni A. Maceroni M. Merluzzi S. Turano C. Altieri F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mature ERp57 was also purified from pig liver (32Ferraro A. Altieri F. Coppari S. Eufemi M. Chichiarelli S. Turano C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Transfection and Overexpression of ERp57—For the mammalian expression of fusion protein GFP-ERp57, the plasmid pTriEx-GFP-ERp57 was constructed by inserting the GFP coding DNA sequence into the BamHI restriction site of pTriEx-1.1-ERp57 vector. Cloning was performed with the procedure previously described (41Grillo C. D'Ambrosio C. Scaloni A. Maceroni M. Merluzzi S. Turano C. Altieri F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with pTriEx-GFP-ERp57 and cultured for 4 weeks in the presence of G418 to produce stable transfectant cell lines (41Grillo C. D'Ambrosio C. Scaloni A. Maceroni M. Merluzzi S. Turano C. Altieri F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% (w/v) formaldehyde, and mounted in 90% (w/v) glycerol containing 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine. Cells were examined under an epifluorescence Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a CCD camera and an Argus-20 image processor (Hamamatsu). Confocal images were taken under a TCS-SP2 (Leica) microscope using a 488-nm laser line for excitation and a 500–537-nm band pass filter for emission. Emission signals were collected using a ×40 (NA = 1.25) or ×100 (NA = 1.4) objective. Cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation. Cytosol and the fraction containing membrane proteins and proteins from the lumen of organelles (e.g. the ER and mitochondria) were obtained with the Qproteome Cell Compartment Kit (Qiagen), whereas nuclear lysates were obtained as previously described (41Grillo C. D'Ambrosio C. Scaloni A. Maceroni M. Merluzzi S. Turano C. Altieri F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were developed by chemiluminescence with ECL substrates (Amersham Biosciences) and subjected to quantitative analysis with a Kodak Image Station 2000R. ERp57 overexpressing HeLa cells were also analyzed for their susceptibility to H2O2-induced cell killing. HeLa wild type and stably transfected cells were plated and, after incubation for 24 h, 0.5 or 2.5 mm H2O2 was added to the medium. The cultures were maintained for an additional 24 h and the cells surviving after incubation were examined. Other Procedures—Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out on the C-terminal domain reduced and re-oxidized in buffer at pH 6.5 or buffer at pH 8.0, and on C406S mutant analyzed in buffer at pH 6.5. All protein solutions were diluted to 0.8 mg/ml protein concentration. Ultracentrifugation runs were performed at 40,000 rpm and 20 °C for 4 h using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics and an An60-Ti rotor. The concentration of protein was determined from absorbance at 280 nm by using the molar extinction coefficient calculated by the method of Gill and von Hippel (42Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions by diluting samples with a 4-fold concentrated SDS sample buffer containing or not 100 mm DTT. Samples were added with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide before dilution with concentrated SDS-sample buffer to prevent any reactivity of free thiol groups. ERp57 and the C-terminal domain were subjected to enzymatic reduction with rat liver thioredoxin reductase (Sigma). Samples (1 mg/ml) were incubated with thioredoxin reductase (0.05 mg/ml), 1.2 mm NADPH for 30 min, at 37 °C, in 20 mm Hepes, 20 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. Control samples were incubated in the absence of both thioredoxin reductase and NADPH, with thioredoxin reductase or NADPH separately, and with 25 mm DTT. Aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and EMSA. Expression and DNA-binding Properties of ERp57 C-terminal Do"
https://openalex.org/W2018473684,"GATA-4 is a key member of the GATA family of transcription factors involved in cardiac development and growth as well as in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Our previous studies suggest that GATA-4 protein synthesis may be translationally regulated. We report here that the 518-nt long 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the GATA-4 mRNA, which is predicted to form stable secondary structures (–65 kcal/mol) such as to be inhibitory to cap-dependent initiation, confers efficient translation to monocistronic reporter mRNAs in cell-free extracts. Moreover, uncapped GATA-4 5′-UTR containing monocistronic reporter mRNAs continue to be well translated while capped reporters are insensitive to the inhibition of initiation by cap-analog, suggesting a cap-independent mechanism of initiation. Utilizing a dicistronic luciferase mRNA reporter containing the GATA-4 5′-UTR within the intercistronic region, we demonstrate that this leader sequence confers functional internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity. The activity of the GATA-4 IRES is unaffected in trans-differentiating P19CL6 cells, however, is strongly stimulated immediately following arginine-vasopressin exposure of H9c2 ventricular myocytes. IRES activity is then maintained at submaximal levels during hypertrophic growth of these cells. Supraphysiological Ca2+ levels diminished stimulation of IRES activity immediately following exposure to vasopressin and inhibition of protein kinase C activity utilizing a pseudosubstrate peptide sequence blocked IRES activity during hypertrophy. Thus, our data suggest a mechanism for GATA-4 protein synthesis under conditions of reduced global cap-dependent translation, which is maintained at a submaximal level during hypertrophic growth and point to the regulation of GATA-4 IRES activity by sarco(ER)-reticular Ca2+ stores and PKC.

The family of GATA transcription factors regulates differentiation, growth, and survival of a wide range of cell types (1Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). GATA-4 is a zinc finger-containing transcription factor, which is expressed, in various mesoderm-derived tissues such as the lung, liver, gonad, and gut where it regulates tissue-specific gene expression (2Peterkin T. Gibson A. Loose M. Patient R. Sem. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 3Pikkarainen S. Tokola H. Kerkela R. Ruskoaho H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63: 196-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Consistent with the observed expression patterns, targeted disruption of GATA-4 in mice has elucidated important functions in each of these tissues. GATA-4 is also essential for proper cardiac morphogenesis and also plays an important role as one of the transcriptional factors, which regulates the hypertrophic response in cardiac myocytes (4Liang Q.

Several studies suggest that GATA-4 can be regulated at both the transcriptional level and by phosphomodulation during hypertrophy (1Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 7Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N.

In cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes, electrical pacing-induced hypertrophy is associated with a significant increase in GATA-4 mRNA, suggesting a mechanism whereby total GATA-4 content is up-regulated during hypertrophy (9Xia Y. McMillin J.B. Lewis A. Moore M. Zhu W.G. Williams R.S. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1855-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Increases in GATA-4 phosphorylation mediated by Raf/Mek/Erk signaling subsequent to hypertrophic agonist administration have also been demonstrated (10Morimoto T. Hasegawa K. Kaburagi S. Kakita T. Wada H. Yanazume T. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13721-13726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Our previous data (11Gera J.F. Mellinghoff I.K. Shi Y.

Merrick W.C. The Pathway and Mechanism of Initiation of Protein Synthesis. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). However, the leaders of some cellular mRNAs are long, highly structured, and can contain multiple upstream AUG or CUG codons such that scanning ribosomes are unlikely to efficiently initiate translation. In a number of these mRNAs, translation initiation is mediated by cap-independent mechanisms via an internal ribosome entry site (13Hellen C.U.T. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). IRES-mediated translation initiation can occur during a variety of physiological conditions and has been reported to promote initiation for several mRNAs during cell-cycle progression, differentiation, apoptosis, and during stress responses (14Spriggs K.A. Bushell M. Mitchell S.A. Willis A.E. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 15Komar A.A. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol.

Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Previously, we identified several mRNAs which either increased or continued to be well translated during conditions when cap-dependent translation initiation was inhibited (11Gera J.F. Mellinghoff I.K. Shi Y. Rettig M.B. Tran C. Hsu J.-H. Sawyers C.L. Lichtenstein A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2737-2746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 19Shi Y. Sharma A. Wu H. Lichtenstein A. Gera J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10964-10973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). One of these mRNAs, GATA-4, increased its translational efficiency markedly following exposure of cells to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Treatment with rapamycin results in the global inhibition of cap-dependent translation via a blockade to the formation of productive eIF4F initiation complexes (20Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). The human GATA-4 transcript has a 518 nucleotide 5′-UTR and contains 18 upstream initiation codons (21Huang W.-Y. Cukerman E. Liew C.-C. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate the possibility of whether this mRNA could initiate translation in a cap-independent fashion and contain an IRES within its leader. Because GATA-4 has a prominent role in the regulation of muscle cell-specific differentiation and IRES-mediated translation may be enhanced during differentiation (22Gerlitz G. Jagus R. Elroy-Stein O. FEBS J. 2002; 269: 2810-2819Google Scholar, 23Krichevsky A.M. Metzer E. Rosen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14295-14305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we analyzed the ability of this leader to mediate internal initiation during this process. We utilized the P19CL6 cell line model to investigate the possibility that the GATA-4 mRNA could initiate IRES-mediated translation during differentiation. The P19CL6 cell line is a clonal derivative of the P19 embryonal carcinoma cell line which efficiently differentiates into beating cardiomyocytes and produces characteristic muscle proteins (24Habara-Ohkubo A. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). GATA-4 is expressed in these cells, is induced upon differentiation, and is required to trans-activate muscle-specific genes (25Monzen K. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Oka T. Takimoto E. Hayashi D. Hosoda T. Habara-Ohkubo A. Nakaoka T. Fujita T. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7096-7105Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Additionally, because GATA-4 is known to be required for cardiac hypertrophy we determined whether IRES-mediated translation initiation of GATA-4 mRNA could occur following vasopressin-induced hypertrophy of H9c2 cardiomyocytes. We report here that the GATA-4 5′-UTR contains IRES activity, which is stimulated during hypertrophy but not during differentiation. Our data also suggest that GATA-4 IRES activity is enhanced coincident with elevated eIF-2α phosphorylation during hypertrophy. We propose that IRES-mediated translational initiation of GATA-4 mRNA allows continued protein synthesis under conditions of reduced cap-dependent initiation potential during the initial response to vasopressin and continues during hypertrophic growth. Moreover, our data suggest that sarco (endo)plasmic Ca2+ flux may play a role in the stimulation of GATA-4 IRES activity through a protein kinase C-dependent pathway during hypertrophy. Cell Lines and DNA Constructs—All cell lines were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) and maintained in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. P19CL6 cell lines expressing the dicistronic reporter mRNAs were generated by co-transfection with pcDNA3.1 and pRGATA-4F followed by G418 selection and subsequent screening for stable expression by Northern analysis. Stable clones were induced to differentiate under adherent conditions by plating at a density of 3.7 × 105 cells in a 60-mm culture dish with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide. The medium was changed every 2 days. Days of differentiation were numbered consecutively, with the first day of Me2SO treatment as day 0. The protein kinase C cell permeable myristoylated pseudosubstrate peptide 20–28 (12 μm) and nifedipine (1 μm) was obtained from Calbiochem, and Arg-vasopressin (1 μm) was from Sigma. 5′-RACE analysis of the GATA-4 mRNA was performed on total RNA from H9c2 or HeLa cells using the 5′/3′-RACE kit, 2nd Generation, as described by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). To construct the dicistronic reporters, the entire human GATA-4 5′-UTR (accession number NM_002052) was amplified from IMAGE clone 5744870 and inserted into the NcoI site of pRF (kindly provided by A. Willis, University of Nottingham, UK). The construction of pRmycF has been described previously (19Shi Y. Sharma A. Wu H. Lichtenstein A. Gera J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10964-10973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The GATA-4 5′-UTR was also inserted into a promoterless version of pRF (26Han B. Zhang J.-T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7372-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), (–)pRF (kindly provided by J.-T. Zhang, Indiana University) to generate –(p)RGATA-4F. A 46-bp HindIII-BamHI fragment containing a hairpin structure containing an 18-bp stem (ΔG =–61 kcal/mol) was liberated from pSP64-hp7 (27Belgrader P. Cheng J. Maquat L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by L. Maquat, Roswell Park Cancer Institute) and inserted immediately upstream of the Renilla ORF in pRGATA-4F to generate phpRGATA-4F. To generate the constructs used in the monocistronic analysis of RNAs in vitro, the firefly luciferase ORF or the GATA-4 5′-UTR-firefly luciferase ORF sequences were amplified from pRGATA-4F and subcloned into the pSP64 poly(A) vector (Promega) to generate pSPpA and pSPGATA-4pA, respectively. Similarly, the dicistronic constructs used in the in vitro analyses were generated by amplifying a fragment spanning the Renilla ORF, the intercistronic region and the firefly ORF from pRF and subcloning this into pSP64 poly(A) to create cRFpoly(A)30. cRGATA-4Fpoly(A)30 and cRp27Fpoly(A)30 were created by amplification of the dicistronic regions of pRGATA-4F and pRp27F (19Shi Y. Sharma A. Wu H. Lichtenstein A. Gera J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10964-10973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), respectively, and subcloning into pSP64 poly(A) as before. The encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) IRES sequences were amplified from pIREShyg (Clontech) and inserted into the NcoI site of cRFpoly(A)30. All constructs were sequenced to confirm their integrity and primer information is available upon request. In Vitro Translation of Mono- and Dicistronic mRNA Reporters—The moncistronic and dicistronic plasmids were linearized and used as templates to in vitro transcribe the indicated RNAs using SP6 polymerase (19Shi Y.

These mRNAs were capped and subsequently used to program extracts of the indicated cell lines as described previously (19Shi Y. Sharma A. Wu H. Lichtenstein A. Gera J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10964-10973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The translation reactions were performed with the cap analog m7GpppG (Ambion) when indicated. Transient DNA and Dicistronic mRNA Transfections—The indicated reporter constructs were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) and normalized for transfection efficiency by co-transfection with pSVβGal (Promega). Cells were harvested 18 h following transfection and Renilla, firefly, and β-galactosidase activities were determined (Dual-Glo luciferase and β-galactosidase assay systems, Promega). RNA transfection was performed as previously described (26Han B. Zhang J.-T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7372-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 12 h following RNA transfection, and luciferase activities determined. Relative luciferase values are expressed as activity per μg of protein. RNAi Analysis—Knockdown experiments targeting the pRF transcript were accomplished based on the strategy of Van Eden et al. (28Van Eden M.E. Byrd M.P. Sherrill K.W. Lloyd R.E. RNA. 2004; 10: 720-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A pool of double-stranded RNAs were synthesized (Dharmacon) targeting the Renilla luciferase ORF were annealed and co-transfected with the indicated mono or dicistronic plasmids into HeLa cells. The targeting sequences within the Renilla ORF used were 5′-AAAGTTTATGATCCAGAACAA-3′and 5′-AACAAAGGAAACGGATGATAA-3′. Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and in Vitro PKC Activity Assays—P19CL6 or H9c2 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cystine at a final concentration of 100 μCi/ml. Cells were harvested following the indicated treatments and lysates prepared in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) with protease inhibitors added (Halt™ Protease Inhibitor Mixture EDTA-Free, Pierce). GATA-4 protein was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg of anti-GATA-4 antibody and then collected with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The immunoprecipitate was washed four times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and fresh protease inhibitors and the complex pelleted for resuspension in SDS sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, the gels dried and visualized using a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Phosphor-densitometry was performed using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics) software. Collectively, immunoprecipitation controls included equal numbers of cells plated per flask and equal amounts of quantitated total protein lysate per sample with equivalent amounts of antibody. PKC activity was determined using the SignaTECT® Protein Kinase C assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, cell lysates were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and PKC-biotinylated peptide substrate in substrate buffer at 30 °C for 5 min and subsequently spotted onto SAM biotin capture membrane (Promega). Membranes were washed and incorporated label measured by a scintillation counter. RNA and Protein Analysis—Northern analysis was performed as previously described (19Shi Y. Sharma A. Wu H. Lichtenstein A. Gera J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10964-10973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) with RNA purified from the indicated cell lines or in vitro translation reactions. Following extraction with TRIzol, 3 μg of total RNA was loaded per lane in 1.4% formaldehyde-containing agarose gels, separated by electrophoresis and transferred to nylon membranes. Hybridization to riboprobes specific for the indicated transcripts was performed in ULTRAhyb hybridization buffer (Ambion). Blots were visualized by exposure to film or by a phosphorimager. RT-PCR was performed using the ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Polysome analysis was performed as previously described (11Gera J.F. Mellinghoff I.K. Shi Y. Rettig M.B. Tran C. Hsu J.-H. Sawyers C.L. Lichtenstein A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2737-2746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in buffer containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide at 4 °C. Following removal of mitochondria and nuclei, supernatants were layered onto 15–50% sucrose gradients and spun at 38,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C in a SW 40 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Gradients were fractionated into eleven 1-ml fractions using an ISCO Density Gradient Fractionator at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The profiles of the gradients were monitored via UV absorbance at 260 nm. RNAs from the individual fractions were pooled into a non-ribosomal and monosomal containing pool and a polysomal pool. These RNAs (100 ng) were subsequently used in real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses of the indicated transcripts using the QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) in an Eppendorf Mastercycler equipped with a realplex2 optical module (Eppendorf AG, Germany). Transcript-specific oligonucleotides for the indicated mRNAs were designed to amplify 150-bp fragments. Immunoblots were performed using standard procedures. Briefly, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Samples were resolved on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (0.2 μm) membranes and probed with antibodies to the following proteins: phospho-eIF-2α and eIF-2α (Cell Signaling), Cdk1 (Abcam), BiP (Imgenex), actin (Sigma), GATA-4, MLC-2, and α-MHC antibodies were all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The GATA-4 Leader Confers the Efficient Translation of Uncapped mRNA Reporters in Translationally Competent Cell Extracts—To begin to study the translational control of the human GATA-4 mRNA the transcriptional start site had to be determined and validated. We used 5′-RACE to isolate and characterize potential leaders. A single 5′-RACE product was amplified from total RNA extracted from either U87-MG or HeLa cells. The sequence was 518 nucleotides in length and was consistent with the previously published human 5′-UTR (21Huang W.-Y. Cukerman E. Liew C.-C. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The GATA-4 leader is 67% G-C rich and contains 18 upstream initiation codons, several of which are in appropriate sequence context to support initiation by a scanning mechanism. Secondary structure prediction using the MFOLD algorithm of Zuker (29Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10253) Google Scholar), predicted a highly stable structure with free energy values greater than –65 kcal/mol. We thus expected that the GATA-4 5′-UTR would be inhibitory to cap-dependent ribosomal scanning and may be translated in a cap-independent fashion. To determine if this was the case, we fused the GATA-4 5′-UTR immediately upstream of the firefly luciferase open reading frame in a SP6 promoter-based construct to generate pSPGATA-4pA as shown in Fig. 1A. In vitro transcribed mRNAs from the pSPGATA-4pA construct were either capped or not and used to program translation-competent cell-free extracts (30Carroll R. Lucaslenard J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, uncapped pSPpA in vitro transcribed mRNA was poorly translated as compared with capped pSPpA mRNAs. However, when in vitro transcribed pSPGATA-4pA mRNAs were tested in an identical manner, uncapped transcripts containing the GATA-4 5′-UTR were translated efficiently at nearly the same levels as capped pSPGATA-4pA mRNAs or capped pSPpA mRNAs (Fig. 1B). Additionally we tested whether or not the cap-analog m7GpppG would effectively inhibit initiation of capped pSPpA or pSPGATA-4pA mRNAs in extracts. As can be seen in Fig. 1C, pSPpA RNA translation was inhibited by ∼80% in the presence of cap-analog, while pSPGATA-4pA was translated well at a comparable concentration of the analog. Northern analysis showed that similar amounts of pSPpA and pSPGATA-4pA mRNAs of the expected size could be detected in the in vitro translation reactions (Fig. 1D). These data suggested that the GATA-4 5′-UTR sequences present in the pSP-GATA-4pA construct do not affect steady-state mRNA levels, or are likely to contain splice sequences. Thus, the 5′-UTR of GATA-4 can confer efficient translation of uncapped reporter mRNAs. The Leader of the GATA-4 mRNA Enhances Translation in Vivo When Cap-dependent Translation Is Inhibited in cis—Because we had previously observed that the GATA-4 mRNA was well translated under conditions of reduced eIF-4F complex formation (11Gera J.F. Mellinghoff I.K. Shi Y. Rettig M.B. Tran C. Hsu J.-H. Sawyers C.L. Lichtenstein A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2737-2746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether a similar affect could be seen if its translation were inhibited in cis. We introduced a stable hairpin structure (ΔG =–61 kcal/mol) (27Belgrader P. Cheng J. Maquat L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) immediately distal to the SV40 promoter sequences in pGL to generate phpGL (Fig. 2A). This cis-acting structural element reduced the translation of the parental construct by 85% when transfected into HeLa cells (Fig. 2B). To assess whether the GATA-4 5′-UTR could mediate translation if cap-dependent translation was inhibited in this manner, we inserted the GATA-4 5′-UTR between the hairpin and the translation start site generating phpGATA-4L. This construct expressed 5-fold more luciferase activity in HeLa cell transfectants then the parental construct phpGL suggesting that the GATA-4 5′-UTR can promote translation initiation when cap-dependent scanning is reduced (Fig. 2B). To address whether cryptic promoters were present within the hairpin or GATA-4 5′-UTR sequences we removed the SV40 promoter sequences from phpGATA-4L to generate –(p)hpGATA-4L and tested HeLa transfectants for luciferase activity. As can be seen (Fig. 2B), no significant luciferase activity was detected suggesting that these sequences, in the context of the monocistronic reporter plasmid, do not support promoter activity. Dicistronic Reporter mRNAs Containing the GATA-4 5′-UTR within the Intercistronic Region Demonstrate IRES Activity—To determine whether the GATA-4 5′-UTR could function as an IRES in vivo, we introduced it into the intercistronic region within the dicistronic mRNA reporter plasmid pRF to generate pRGATA-4F (Fig. 3A). This plasmid contains the Renilla luciferase ORF as the first cistron and the firefly luciferase ORF as the second downstream cistron. In all the cell lines transfected with the pRGATA-4F construct downstream firefly luciferase activity was 6–10-fold higher as compared with values obtained for the control plasmid pRF (Fig. 3B). As a positive control, transfection with a construct baring the c-myc IRES in these lines also yielded firefly luciferase activities which were comparable to those obtained with pRGATA-4F. Renilla luciferase levels were comparable in all the cell lines tested, suggesting that the steady-state mRNA levels and the relative levels of cap-dependent translation of the dicistronic constructs were similar. Furthermore, Northern analysis revealed a single stable luciferase mRNA species of the expected size for each construct (Fig. 3C). In an effort to more carefully examine the possibility of monocistronic RNAs containing the firefly luciferase ORF being generated in vivo from these dicistronic mRNAs via aberrant splicing events we attempted to detect splice variants by RT-PCR. The integrity of the mRNAs was determined using primers spanning the Renilla and firefly cistrons (shown in Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3D, a single RNA species of the expected molecular mass was amplified from HeLa cells transfected with pRGATA-4F. No other RNAs were observed suggesting that no aberrant splicing was taking place. These results support the notion that the GATA-4 5′-UTR can initiate translation internally and that the firefly luciferase activity observed is not likely because of cap-dependent initiation of shorter monocistronic reporter transcripts. Ribosomal Readthrough Does Not Occur in Dicistronic Constructs Containing the GATA-4 5′-UTR—To determine if the GATA-4 5′-UTR could function in a dicistronic construct by facilitating termination codon readthrough of the Renilla ORF through the intercistronic region we inserted the hairpin structure (Fig. 2A) upstream of the Renilla ORF within the dicistronic construct pRGATA-4F to generate phpRGATA-4F (Fig. 4A). If the GATA-4 5′-UTR sequences were mediating ribosomal readthrough of the Renilla termination codon, inhibiting translation of the upstream ORF should also result in a p"

However, the sequences of individual TM domains vary considerably. Although some general effects of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions have been observed, it is still not clear what features of diverse sequences influence TM domain orientation. Here we utilized the ability of the prion protein (PrP) to be synthesized in multiple topological forms to assay the effects of substitutions and mutations on TM domain orientation. Several of the TM domains we tested appear to contain no inherent information regulating orientation. In contrast, we found that the middle region of the PrP TM domain significantly reduces the ability of the chain to invert its orientation in the translocon. We also observed that the C-terminal region of the PrP TM domain influences orientation, and we characterized the orientation differences between two forms of a physiologically relevant polymorphism in this region. Specifically, we found that the identity of a single amino acid, that at position 129, can significantly alter PrP TM domain orientation. Because position 129 is the location of the disease-associated Met/Val polymorphism, we discuss both how this small change may affect TMD orientation and the larger biological implications of these results.

Nascent membrane proteins are synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes and targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 4The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CD28, T-cell specific surface protein; IgM, immunoglobulin M; pk, proteinase K; PrP, prion protein; TM, transmembrane; CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; vCJD, variant; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; ASGP-R, asialoglycoprotein receptor. 4The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CD28, T-cell specific surface protein; IgM, immunoglobulin M; pk, proteinase K; PrP, prion protein; TM, transmembrane; CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; vCJD, variant; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; ASGP-R, asialoglycoprotein receptor. co-translationally through the interaction of signal or signal-anchor sequences with the signal recognition particle (1Shan S.O. Walter P. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). At the ER membrane the ribosome-nascent chain complex associates with the translocon, a proteinaceous pore in the ER lipid bilayer. Signal and signal-anchor sequences are first inserted into the translocon with the N terminus near the ER lumen (2Goder V. Spiess M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3645-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Inversion of the signal sequence is necessary for proper translocation of secretory proteins and subsequent cleavage of the signal sequence. Signal-anchor sequences, which integrate into the lipid bilayer and become transmembrane (TM) domains, can integrate before or after signal inversion occurs (generating proteins with the majority of the amino acids in the cytoplasm or exoplasm, respectively) (2Goder V. Spiess M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3645-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 3Goder V. Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Single-spanning membrane proteins without signal-anchors contain internal TM domains, which are recognized within the ribosome exit channel and at the translocon (4Liao S. Lin J. Do H. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Like signal-anchor sequences, these TM domains can integrate in either orientation. Regulation of signal-anchor and TM domain orientation is essential for proper membrane protein biosynthesis. Several features of the nascent chain that influence TM domain orientation have been identified. Charged residues adjacent to the TM domain usually orient on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane (the positive-inside rule) due to electrostatic interactions (5Von Heijne G.V. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Beltzer J.P. Fiedler K. Fuhrer C. Geffen I. Handschin C. Wessels H.P. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 973-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the hydrophobicity of the TM domain is thought to influence orientation (3Goder V. Spiess M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It has been observed that more hydrophobic TM domains flip orientations more slowly and presumably less frequently (2Goder V. Spiess M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3645-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Secondary structure can also influence orientation. Residues that increase flexibility promote TM domain re-orientation, whereas rigid structures are sterically hindered from inverting (8Higy M. Gander S. Spiess M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2039-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although these features can be used to help predict the orientation of transmembrane domains, error rates in prediction algorithms suggest additional features of the translocon and nascent chain influence orientation (9Ott C.M. Lingappa V.R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2003-2009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have utilized model signal-anchor proteins (composed of long stretches of leucine residues) to characterize the properties of the nascent chain that influence orientation (2Goder V. Spiess M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3645-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8Higy M. Gander S. Spiess M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2039-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although this model system has been very informative, it also has limitations. Because signal-anchor sequences are used for targeting the nascent chain and engaging the translocon in addition to mediating orientation and integration (10Rutkowski D.T. Ott C.M. Polansky J.R. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30365-30372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Rutkowski D.T. Lingappa V.R. Hegde R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2002; 2: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), it is difficult to be certain that changes in the signal-anchor sequence affect only orientation. An additional limitation is due to the highly regular sequence of the model signal-anchor. An amazing feature of the translocon is the ability to reproducibly process proteins with highly diverse sequences. How is so much variability between TM domain sequences tolerated? What are the features of individual TM domains that influence orientation? We have employed a different system to try to address these questions. The prion protein (PrP) can be synthesized in multiple topological forms (15Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R.

Yost C.S. Prusiner S.B. Myers R.M. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1990; 248: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). During co-translational translocation at the ER, some PrP nascent chains pass completely through the translocon to generate secretory PrP (SecPrP), others integrate into the lipid bilayer with their N terminus in the ER lumen (NtmPrP), and still others integrate in the opposite orientation (CtmPrP; see Fig. 1A). The ability of PrP to be made in multiple topological forms has made it an ideal candidate for studying regulation of membrane protein biosynthesis. Previously it was used to examine the ability of the signal sequence to effect the partitioning of the TM domain into the lipid bilayer (19Ott C.M. Lingappa V.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11973-11982Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here we use PrP as a model to examine the effect of TM domain substitutions and mutations on orientation. To generate the different topological variants of PrP, the nascent polypeptide must exist in at least two intermediate states in the translocon (depicted in Fig. 1A). In the first the signal sequence has an Ncyt/Cexo orientation (the N terminus is cytoplasmic, and the C terminus is exoplasmic), the transmembrane domain has the opposite orientation (Nexo/Ccyt), and the connecting sequence is in the lumen of the ER. NtmPrP is generated upon integration of the TM domain in this orientation, whereas SecPrP results if the TM domain does not integrate. The alternate intermediate state is the precursor for CtmPrP and cytoplasmic PrP. In this intermediate state the signal and connecting sequences are in the cytosol, and the TM domain has an Ncyt/Cexo orientation (this is consistent with the observation that CtmPrP contains an uncleaved signal sequence). Movement of the nascent chain between the two intermediate states requires inversion of the transmembrane domain. Presumably all TM domains begin with an Nexo/Ccyt orientation and only re-orient after a sufficient length of polypeptide has been synthesized to span the length of the translocon and connect the C-terminal end of the TM domain to the ribosome. In these studies we use the topological distribution of full-length PrP as a read out for the distribution of the nascent chains in the intermediate stages and the ability of the TM domain to re-orient in the translocon. We utilized substitutions and mutations in different regions of the PrP TM domain to characterize the features that influence orientation. In addition to providing important information about the role of the TM domain sequence in determining orientation, we were able to gain insights into how the biosynthesis of PrP is regulated, which is especially important for understanding prion pathology. SecPrP in the ER is the precursor of both PrPC and PrPSc, the normal and scrapie-associated forms of PrP which do not contain integrated TM domains but associate with the membrane through a glycolipid anchor (20Prusiner S.B. Science. 1997; 278: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). NtmPrP has been observed in vivo on the plasma membrane of platelets (21Barclay G.R. Hope J. Birkett C.R. Turner M.L. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 107: 804-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Generation of CtmPrP has been shown to occur in both infectious and familial prion disease (15Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A.

Because we characterized the affect of amino acid substitutions on nascent chain orientation, we were able to detect differences in the topological distribution between two polymorphic forms of wild type PrP. This disease-associated polymorphism is located in the C-terminal region of the PrP TM domain at position 129 (23Collinge J. Beck J. Campbell T. Estibeiro K. Will R.G.

Plasmid Construction—Constructs used in in vitro transcriptions were derived from the pSP64 hamster PrP (haPrP), mouse PrP (moPrP), and human PrP (huPrP) constructs published previously (14Kim S.J.

To generate the TM domain chimeric constructs, the amyloid precursor protein (APP), immunoglobulin M (IgM), vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG), T-cell specific surface protein (CD28), Cop-coated vesicle membrane protein p24 (p24), interleukin 2 receptor (ILZR), and asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) TM domains were PCR-amplified, digested, and ligated into NdeI and NsiI sites outside the PrP TM domain. All other mutants and chimeras were generated by site directed mutagenesis. Transfection vectors were in the pCDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). In Vitro Transcription, Translation, Translocation, and Proteolysis—In vitro transcription and translation were performed as described previously (26Chuck S.L. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 9-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). During cell-free translation 35S-labeled Met was incorporated into the nascent chain. Translations were carried out at 34 °C for 30 min. Glycosylation was inhibited by 0.2 mm tripeptide competitor (26Chuck S.L. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 9-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Microsomal membrane isolation has been described previously (10Rutkowski D.T. Ott C.M. Polansky J.R. Lingappa V.R. J.

The protease was inactivated by incubation with 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 5 min and boiling in 10 volumes of 0.1 m Tris, 1% SDS. Cell Culture—CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 complete medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). For each 35-mm well, 3 μg of DNA was incubated with 125 μl of serum-free media and 7.5 μl of Plus reagent for 15 min. In parallel, 5 μl of Lipofectamine was incubated with 125 μl of serum-free media. The two solutions were then mixed and incubated for an additional 15 min at room temperature. This mixture was then added to the well containing 1 ml of fresh serum free media. After 3 h the media was replaced with complete media. Before pulsing with [35S]Met, the cells were incubated for 30 min in Ham's F-12 Cys/Met-free media with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells were labeled with 30 μl of 35S EasyTag (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) per well 24 h after transfection for a duration of 4 h. 5S. Sagafi and V. Lingappa, unpublished methods. Cell Harvesting, Lysis, and Proteolysis—After a 10-min incubation on ice, cells were harvested by scraping and transferred to a 15-ml Falcon tube. They were then pelleted for 5 min at 3000 rpm (2060 × g) and 4 °C in a Beckman GS6R centrifuge. The medium was removed, and hypotonic lysis was carried out in 0.6 ml of 4 °C 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. For homogenization, the cells were passed through a 27-gauge needle 10 times. 1/10 volume of 10× physiologic salt buffer (0.5 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m potassium acetate, 50 mm magnesium acetate) was then added.4 For proteolysis, samples were split into three 200-μl aliquots. One sample was treated with both 8 μl of 10 mg/ml pk and 10 μl of 20% Triton X-100, another was treated only with pk, and the third was left untreated. All samples were incubated on ice at 4 °C for 1 h, treated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then transferred to 4 volumes of boiling 1% SDS, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0. Immunoprecipitation and N-Glycosidase F Treatment—400 μl of proteolyzed sample was added to 1.25 ml of 1.5× Doc TXSWB (75 mm potassium acetate, 75 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 0.75% deoxycholate, 1.5%Triton X-100), 20 μl of packed protein A beads, and 1 μl of 3F4 or 20 μl of packed protein G beads and 2 μl of 13A5 ascites.4 Samples were mixed gently overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed 3 times with 1× Doc TXSWB and 1 time with 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8. The beads were then boiled to evaporate liquid and boiled in 50 μl of 0.5–1% SDS, 0.1 m Tris acetate, pH 8, to release the PrP from the beads. For N-glycosidase F treatment 50 μl of 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8, was added to each sample, and the tubes were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C then boiled for 2 min. 2.5 μl of 20% Triton X-100 was added, and the samples were mixed by vortexing. The samples were split into two 45-μl aliquots; to one, 1 μl of N-glycosidase F was added. The samples were then left at least 6 h at 37 °C. Calculations and Statistical Analysis—Because NtmPrP has not been detected in cell culture, % CtmPrP in the cell culture experiments was calculated as 100 × (CtmPrP/(CtmPrP + SecPrP)). In all other experiments it was calculated as 100 × (CtmPrP/(CtmPrP + SecPrP + NtmPrP)). In Figs. 4 and 5 some data are shown as normalized % CtmPrP. The normalized value was calculated as the % CtmPrP of the sample divided by the % CtmPrP of wild type Met-129 PrP. Normalization enabled us to compare internally consistent data that varied slightly between experiments.FIGURE 5Residue 129 influences TM domain orientation in cell culture. A, CHO-1 cells were transfected with hamster PrP constructs containing the CtmPrP favoring A120L mutation, the SecPrP favoring G123P mutation, the indicated amino acids at position 129, or a mutation of residues 128 and 129 to Ser (YM to SS). 24 h after transfection cells were labeled with [35S]Met for 4 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed. The samples were split and incubated in the absence or presence of pk and detergent (det). After inactivation of the protease, PrP was immunoprecipitated from the reactions, and N-linked glycosylation was removed by treatment with N-glycosidase F. The samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE. SecPrP is indicated by the open circle, and CtmPrP is indicated by the asterisk. CtmPrP is identifiable because the protease protected fragment is also protease-resistant in the presence of mild detergent (15Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). B, the percent CtmPrP from several experiments was quantified and normalized to the value of wild type Met-129 PrP, which enabled us to compare data from different experiments. For all mutants, the value of CtmPrP was found to be significantly different from hamster Met-129 (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mean values and S.D. were obtained from at least three independent experiments and graphed as histogram bars. Student's t test was used to test for differences between the means of two samples. Statistically significant differences are indicated by the corresponding p value. In Fig. 4C, we claim a difference in percent CtmPrP generated by the Met-129 and Val-129 variants of A117V. This difference is minor and statistically insignificant, possibly because A117V is intrinsically highly Ctm favoring. Nonetheless, this difference is reproducible in all experiments. Miscellaneous—15% Tricine and 15% Tris-glycine gels were used for SDS-PAGE. Autoradiographs were scanned using an Agfa Arcus II flatbed scanner and quantitated using NIH Image 1.63. The sequence of the hamster PrP TM domain and surrounding regions is shown in Fig. 1B. Although there are charged residues on either side of the TM domain, one might predict that the TM domain would be more likely to orient Ncyt/Cexo and generate CtmPrP because there are more positively charged residues N-terminal to the TM domain. However, wild type PrP generates less than 10% CtmPrP as shown in Fig. 1C. Surprisingly, substitution of the Lys and His residues at positions 109 and 110 with two Ile causes CtmPrP levels to increase substantially and leads to neurodegeneration (15Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the positive inside rule is not providing the overriding information to determine PrP TM domain orientation. We, therefore, proposed that there must be information inherent in the PrP TM domain and possibly other TM domains that influence orientation. To test this hypothesis we substituted the PrP TM domain with the TM domains from proteins, which in their native context integrate in either the Ntm (vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG), amyloid precursor protein (APP), IgM, CD28, interleukin 2 receptor (IL2R), and p24), or the Ctm (asialoglycoprotein receptor ASGP-R) orientation (sequences shown in Fig. 1B). We intentionally chose sequences that vary in length, hydrophobicity, and presumably, structure. To assess the effect of the substitutions on TM domain orientation, we transcribed and translated the constructs in vitro in the presence of microsomal membranes. The microsomal membranes were then isolated, resuspended, and incubated in the presence or absence of pk. After inactivation of the protease, the different PrP isoforms were separated by SDS-PAGE on Tricine gels. After exposure of the gels to film, the fraction of chains in each topology was quantitated. SecPrP, which translocates fully into the microsomal lumen, is protected from the protease, whereas CtmPrP and NtmPrP can be identified by characteristic shifts in molecular weight upon protease addition. We used the increase in CtmPrP as an indicator of shifts in the equilibrium of the two intermediate states. This is valid even without quantitating cytosolic PrP because wild type PrP favors the Nexo/Ccyt intermediate. For some samples the total number of chains appears to decrease upon protease treatment (for example, see – CD28 and + pk in Fig. 1C). It is possible that the missing population is cytosolic PrP that somehow remains associated with the microsomal membranes when they are pelleted but then is completely digested by protease. However, we used only the relative amounts of SecPrP, NtmPrP, and CtmPrP in the + pk lanes for our calculations. Again, this gives us a good barometer for shifts in the integration intermediates because wild type PrP strongly favors the Nexo/Ccyt intermediate. When we examined the TM domain chimeras we were surprised to find that all constructs generated considerably more CtmPrP than wild type PrP (see Fig. 1C). This was true regardless of the orientation of the TM domain in its native context. Therefore, in the presence of the foreign TM domains the balance between the two states is shifted toward the Ncyt/Cexo intermediate. This suggests that the contextual information outside the PrP transmembrane domain favors the Ncyt/Cexo intermediate according to the positive inside rule. What then are the features of the PrP TM domain that cause it to favor the Nexo/Ccyt intermediate? It has been speculated that the ability of PrP to be made in multiple topological forms is due in large part to the unique features of the TM domain (18Lopez C.D. Yost C.S. Prusiner S.B. Myers R.M. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1990; 248: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Unlike conventional TM domains, the PrP TM domain contains many glycines and alanines. The presence of Ala and Val residues in a model signal-anchor sequence has been shown to alter the orientation of the TM region, perhaps by affecting the flexibility of the nascent chain. Because the initial state of all PrP TM domains is Nexo/Ccyt, one might hypothesize that amino acids that increase the flexibility of the chain would promote re-orientation and formation of the Ncyt/Cexo intermediate (and, thus, more CtmPrP), which does not appear to be the case. To dissect this puzzling situation we decided to substitute smaller regions of the PrP TM domain with the amino acid sequence of the IgM TM domain. We defined three regions within each TM domain, an N-terminal region, a middle region, and a C-terminal region (shown in Fig. 2A). We then generated a series of six new constructs that contain all possible combinations of the different TM regions (Fig. 2A). Constructs were named with the letters representing each domain present. For example, PIP has the middle region from IgM and the PrP N- and C-terminal domains. We then assayed the topological distribution of these constructs and calculated the percent CtmPrP generated. The data from these experiments are represented in Fig. 2, B–D. In Fig. 2B we compare the effect of the IgM and PrP N-terminal regions on PrP topology. Several disease-associated mutations in the PrP TM domain have been found to significantly increase the generation of CtmPrP (15Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 22Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2212-2220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These mutations are all in the N-terminal region of the TM domain, suggesting that this region may be important for determining TM domain orientation. However, we found that substituting this region of PrP with IgM had little effect on the topology of an otherwise wild type PrP chain (PPP versus IPP). The effect of the IgM sequence in the middle region of the PrP TM domain was much more striking (see Fig. 2C). In all cases the presence of the IgM middle region leads to an increase in CtmPrP production. This portion of the TM domain is, therefore, very important for maintenance of the Nexo/Ccyt intermediate. The role of the C-terminal region in TM domain orientation was less obvious. However, we noticed that in the presence of the PrP middle region the IgM C-terminal region significantly reduced CtmPrP (compare PPP and PPI or IPP and IPI, Fig. 2D). The C-terminal region has not been previously implicated in studies of disease causing mutations that alter topology. This result indicates that in the presence of the PrP middle region, the C-terminal region is essential for inversion of the Nexo/Ccyt intermediate. We next decided to investigate the features of this C-terminal region that are responsible for mediating TM domain re-orientation. We searched through sequence databases and identified two TM domains with features similar to the corresponding region of PrP or IgM; the sixth predicted TM domain from the human growth hormone-inducible transmembrane (GHIT) protein, which has some similarities to the C-terminal region of the PrP TM domain, and the last eight amino acids of the TM domain from the human myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG), which contains several amino acids with similar properties to those found in IgM. We used site-directed mutagenesis to replace these sequences into wild type PrP. In addition we substituted the C-terminal region of the PrP TM domain with eight central hydrophobic amino acids and, separately, the last eight amino acids of the asialoglycoprotein receptor because this TM domain orients Ncyt/Cexo in its native context. When we assayed PrP topology we found that all of these chimeras generated levels of CtmPrP well below wild type (see Fig. 3). We were surprised that the growth hormone-inducible transmembrane protein sequence, which has several of the same amino acids as those found in PrP, caused such a significant reduction in the levels of CtmPrP integration. Although these results confirm that a feature of the C-terminal region of the PrP TM domain is important for TM domain inversion, they d"

The resulting mutant proteins are unstable, forming insoluble aggregates that are associated with components of the ubiquitin system, including ubiquitin, ubiquitin-like proteins, and proteins that bind to ubiquitin. Given the presence of these ubiquitin-binding proteins in the insoluble aggregates, we examined whether heterologous expression of short motifs that bind ubiquitin, termed ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs), altered the aggregation of polyQ-expanded huntingtin (Htt), the protein product of the Huntington disease gene. We found that a subset of UIMs associated with mutant Htt. The ability to interact with ubiquitin was necessary, but not sufficient, for interaction with mutant Htt. Furthermore, we found that expression of single, isolated UIMs inhibited aggregation of mutant Htt.

Several neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington disease (HD) 4The abbreviations used are: HD, Huntington disease; UIM, ubiquitin-interacting motif; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; SIM, SUMO-interacting motif; GFP, green fluorescent protein; polyQ, polyglutamine. and Machado-Joseph disease, result from the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the disease gene. In the case of HD, expansion of the CAG repeat in Htt results in a polyQ tract in the extreme NH2 terminus of the protein that destabilizes the protein, leading to the formation of SDS-insoluble protein aggregates also known as inclusion bodies in vitro and in vivo (1Wanker E.E. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 2Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Adjacent to the polyQ repeat is a Pro-rich region that recruits WW domain- and Src homology 3 domaincontaining proteins followed by 36 predicted HEAT repeats. Although the role of Htt in disease pathology is still unclear, the age of disease onset is directly correlated with the length of the polyQ tract (i.e. the longer the polyQ tract, the earlier the onset of the disease). Indeed, an expansion of 70 or more glutamines results in the juvenile form of the disease (3Myers R.H. MacDonald M.E. Koroshetz W.J. Duyao M.P. Ambrose C.M. Taylor S.A. Barnes G. Srinidhi J. Lin C.S.

Ubiquitin is one of several proteins that is localized to insoluble aggregates formed by polyQ-expanded proteins, such as mutant Htt. This interaction has been hypothesized to contribute to the pathogenesis of HD, possibly through the recruitment or sequestration of ubiquitin-binding proteins into these aggregates (4Donaldson K.M. Li W. Ching K.A. Batalov S. Tsai C.C. Joazeiro C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Recently, several domains have been demonstrated to bind to ubiquitin, including the ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM), a short peptide sequence consisting of a highly conserved ΦXXAXXXSXXAc core, where Φ represents a hydrophobic residue and Ac is an acidic residue (5Hofmann K. Falquet L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). This motif not only binds noncovalently to ubiquitinated proteins but also has the ability to promote ubiquitination of a region located NH2-terminal to the UIMs (6Miller S.L. Malotky E. O'Bryan J.P.

Given these properties of the UIM and the presence of ubiquitinated proteins within polyQ-containing aggregates, we examined whether UIMs were able to alter aggregation of mutant Htt. In this study, we demonstrate that a subset of UIMs co-localized with mutant Htt but with different patterns of localization. Interestingly, the ability to bind ubiquitin was necessary but not sufficient for Htt-Q65 interaction. Using a cell-based aggregation assay, we demonstrate that UIMs from ataxin-3 and S5a specifically inhibited aggregation of mutant Htt. These data suggest that isolated UIMs may be efficacious inhibitors of Htt aggregation, thus attenuating Htt-induced toxicity in vivo. Cells and Reagents—Human embryonic kidney cells (293 and 293T) were cultured as previously described (8Oldham C.E. Mohney R.P. Miller S.L. Hanes R.N. O'Bryan J.P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1112-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). COS cells were cultured similar to 293T cells. Antibodies used for these studies include the following: anti-GST and anti-Hsp70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); full-length A.V. polyclonal antibody, Living Colors peptide antibody to GFP and its variants (Clontech); monoclonal antibody against ubiquitin (Covance); and anti-His and anti-small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-1 (Boston Biochem). Constructs—pEFG-UIM, pGEX-UIM, and YFP-UIM constructs were described previously (6Miller S.L. Malotky E. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33528-33537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Htt-Q65-CFP, cyan fluorescent protein, was kindly provided by Dr. Peter Reinhardt and consists of 17 amino acids upstream of the polyQ region followed by 65 Qs and 130 amino acids following the polyQ region containing the proline-rich region of the full-length Htt. The following separate UIM constructs were created by PCR amplification of the pEFG S5A UIM or ataxin-3 UIM described previously: S5a UIM1 with 5′HS5_UIM and 3′S5A-UIM1 (GACGATATCTGCCCGCCGGGCCTCCTCCT); S5a UIM2 with 5′S5A-UIM2 (GACGGATCCATGACCATCAGCCAGCAAGAGTTT) and 3′S5A-UIM2 (GACGATATCGTCTGCTGATTCCGCCTGGCCAAA); ATAXIN-3 UIM1 with 5′ATAXIN-3correct and 3′ATAXIN-3-UIM1 (GACGATATCTTCCATGTCAATTTCTTGGCGA); ATAXIN-3 UIM2 with 5′ATAXIN-3-UIM2 (GACGGATCCGATGAGGAAGCAGATCTCCGCA) and 3′ATAXIN-3-UIM2 (GACGATATCGTTTCTGGAACTACCTTGCAT); ATAXIN-3-UIM3 with 5′ATAXIN-3-UIM3 (GACGGATCCAGTGAAGAAGACATGCTTCA) and 3′ATAXIN-3_UIM; ATAXIN-3 UIM1-2 with 5′ATAXIN-3correct and 3′ATAXIN-3-UIM2; ATAXIN-3 UIM1-3 with 5′ATAXIN-3-UIM2 and 3′ATAXIN-3_UIM (6Miller S.L. Malotky E. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33528-33537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The resulting products were digested with BamHI and EcoRV and subcloned into pEFG (8Oldham C.E. Mohney R.P. Miller S.L. Hanes R.N. O'Bryan J.P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1112-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) digested with BamHI and EcoRV and pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) digested with BglII and SmaI. All constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis. The purified pDEST566 His-maltose-binding protein (MBP) Htt-Q65 was created by PCR amplification of Htt-Q65-CFP with 5′HTT (CACCACGATGGCGACCCTGGAAAAGCTGATG) and 3′HTT-STOP (CACCTCATAGCTCGAGCTGTAACCTTGGAAG). The resulting blunt-end fragment was then cloned into the pENTR/TEV/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and verified by DNA sequencing. Next, the pENTR/TEV/D-TOPO Htt-Q65 was mixed with the plasmid pDEST566 using the Gateway® system (Invitrogen) to obtain His-MBP-tagged Htt-Q65. Confocal Imaging—COS cells (7 × 104) were plated onto glass bottom plates and were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) with YFP-UIMs/UIM-YFPs alone or with Htt-Q65-CFP. Forty-eight hours following transfection, confocal images were acquired using a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 mounted on an Axiovert 100M microscope. Images were obtained using the 514-nm argon laser for YFP and 458 nm for CFP with the Plan-Apochromat ×63/1.4 oil immersion objective lens. The bandpass filter 531-595 was used for YFP emission, and bandpass filter 470-500 was used for CFP with a pinhole of 0.7 Airy units, which provides a z-resolution of ∼0.6 μm. Images were imported into Photoshop. For a set of images of YFP, CFP, and overlap, the brightness and contrast were equally adjusted for each panel so as not to bias the images. Immunoprecipitation Assay—HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of GST or GST-UIM constructs. Lysates were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GSH), fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and then immunoblotted with anti-GST antibody to detect expression of the GST-tagged proteins. Binding to endogenous heat shock protein 70, Hsp70, was determined by immunoblotting with anti-Hsp70. For the GST-UIMs and Htt-Q65-CFP immunoprecipitation assay, 293 HEK cells were transiently transfected with 3 μg of GST-UIMs and 1 μg of Htt-Q65-CFP. Following precipitation with GSH beads, the precipitate was fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted with α-GST to detect expression of GST-UIMs or with Living Colors peptide antibody for evaluating binding of the Htt-Q65-CFP. Supernatant recovered after precipitation with GSH beads was then immunoprecipitated with the full-length A.V. polyclonal antibody, fractionated on a gel, and probed with Living Colors peptide antibody to evaluate expression of the Htt-Q65-CFP. Cell Aggregation Assay—Htt-Q65-CFP was co-expressed with GST or GST-UIMs at various doses ranging from 0 to 3 μg in 293 HEK cells. Two days following transfection, 20 fluorescence images were acquired for each DNA amount using an Olympus 1X70 microscope system. An observer blind to dose quantified the percentage of aggregate formation by counting the number of cells with fluorescent aggregates and dividing by the total number of fluorescent cells. Relative aggregate formation was calculated by normalizing the percentage of aggregates to the aggregate percentage at a dose of 0 μg. For each experiment done in triplicate, 800-1000 cells were counted for each dose. Cells were then lysed with PLC-LB as described previously (8Oldham C.E. Mohney R.P. Miller S.L. Hanes R.N. O'Bryan J.P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1112-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Lysates were precipitated with GSH beads for several hours and spun down, and then the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with the full-length A.V. polyclonal antibody. Precipitates were washed five times with PLC-LB, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. Membranes were either probed with α-GST to verify increased expression of the GST/GST-UIMs with increased dose or with Living Colors peptide antibody to detect similar expression of the Htt-Q65-CFP. In Vitro Binding Assay—Binding assays were performed as described previously (6Miller S.L. Malotky E. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33528-33537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-UIM constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using GSH beads. 200 pmol of the GST fusion proteins were incubated with 200 pmol of His-MBP-tagged Htt-Q65, 1 μl of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains ranging from 2-7 ubiquitins, purified SUMO-1, or purified His-tagged NEDD8 at a concentration of 0.25 μg/μl (Boston Biochemical) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted and washed twice. Given that GST nonspecifically bound the mutant Htt, samples were treated with thrombin as described previously for 3 h at 22 °C (8Oldham C.E. Mohney R.P. Miller S.L. Hanes R.N. O'Bryan J.P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1112-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Samples were spun down, and the supernatant was transferred to another tube to obtain the soluble fraction. After the addition of sample buffer, the bead portion and soluble portion were fractionated on gels, and the GST or UIMs were detected via Gel Code© Blue Coomassie stain. Alternatively, gels were transferred to an Immobilon-P filter and probed with the His antibody for detection of His-MBP Htt-Q65 or NEDD8, α-ubiquitin for detection of Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains, or α-SUMO-1 for detection of SUMO. S5A, ataxin-3, Hrs, and Eps15 UIMs Are Recruited to Mutant Htt Aggregates—To evaluate the interaction of UIMs with polyQ-expanded proteins, we expressed individual YFP-UIM chimeras in COS cells in the absence or presence of the first exon of Htt containing a polyQ expansion of 65 Qs fused to CFP (Htt-Q65-CFP) (Fig. 1). When expressed alone, most UIMs localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus. However, the Eps15 UIM localized exclusively to the cytoplasm. Co-expression of Htt-Q65-CFP resulted in recruitment of ataxin-3, Eps15, S5a, and Hrs UIMs into inclusion bodies. In contrast, the distribution of KIAA1594, epsin, USP25, HSJ1, and KIAA1386 UIMs was unaffected by the presence of mutant Htt-Q65 (Fig. 1; data not shown). Although interaction of ataxin-3 UIMs with polyQ-expanded aggregates correlated with ubiquitin binding (4Donaldson K.M. Li W. Ching K.A. Batalov S. Tsai C.C. Joazeiro C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the observed difference in UIM recruitment could not be accounted for by the affinity of the particular UIMs for ubiquitin. For example, KIAA1594 binds Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains as well as if not better than ataxin-3 (6Miller S.L. Malotky E. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33528-33537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) but, in contrast to ataxin-3, did not co-localize with Htt-Q65 aggregates. UIMs Are Not Recruited to Htt-Q65 Aggregates through Binding to Htt-Q65, Hsp70, Lys63-linked Polyubiquitin Chains, or Ubiquitin-like Proteins—To determine the mechanism responsible for localization of specific UIMs to Htt-Q65 aggregates, we evaluated the binding of UIMs to several proteins present in polyQ-expanded aggregates, including mutant, expanded Htt-Q65. HEK293T cells were transiently co-transfected with GST or GST-UIMs along with Htt-Q65-CFP. GST fusion proteins were then purified from lysates using GSH-agarose beads. Western blot analysis of purified GST proteins revealed no interaction between any UIM and Htt-Q65-CFP (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, an in vitro binding assay using purified GST or GST-UIMs and purified His-MBP Htt-Q65 failed to detect a specific interaction between Htt-Q65 and any GST-UIM. Since GST alone nonspecifically bound mutant Htt, samples were treated with thrombin to determine if this association was mediated by the GST or UIM portion of the chimeric protein. Upon thrombin cleavage, His-MBP-Htt-Q65 remained bound to the GSTcontaining beads (Fig. 2B, left). There was no evidence of binding between any UIMs and His-MBP-Htt-Q65 (Fig. 2B, right). Although the interaction of the UIMs with Htt-Q65 did not correlate with the affinity for Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains, recent data suggest that Lys63-linked chains may be important in aggregate formation (10Lim K.L. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Using an in vitro ubiquitin binding assay (6Miller S.L. Malotky E. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33528-33537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we evaluated the ability of different UIMs to bind purified Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains (Fig. 3). Although different UIMs bound Lys63-ubiquitin chains to varying degrees, there was no correlation between the recognition of Lys63-linked chains and the association with Htt-Q65-CFP. In addition to ubiquitin, there exist several additional ubiquitinlike proteins in the human proteome, including the SUMO and NEDD8. Like ubiquitin, SUMO is also present in mutant Htt aggregates, and sumoylation of mutant Htt leads to increased neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of Htt-induced neurodegeneration (11Steffan J.S. Agrawal N. Pallos J. Rockabrand E. Trotman L.C. Slepko N. Illes K. Lukacsovich T. Zhu Y.Z. Cattaneo E. Pandolfi P.P. Thompson L.M. Marsh J.L. Science. 2004; 304: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). To determine whether an interaction with SUMO contributed to UIM recruitment to polyQ aggregates, we evaluated the binding of UIMs to SUMO using an in vitro assay. GST-UIM fusion proteins bound to purified SUMO to varying degrees (Fig. 4A). However, the ability to bind SUMO did not depend on the number of UIMs; nor did it correlate with aggregate recruitment, similar to results with Lys48- and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. We also determined whether UIMs bound the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8, which has been found in aggregates formed by polyQ expansion of the androgen receptor in spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (12Stenoien D.L. Cummings C.J. Adams H.P. Mancini M.G. Patel K. DeMartino G.N. Marcelli M. Weigel N.L. Mancini M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In contrast to ubiquitin and SUMO, none of the UIMs tested bound NEDD8 (Fig. 4B). We recently demonstrated that the UIMs of epsin interacted with heat shock protein Hsp/Hsc70 (13Timsit Y.E. Miller S.L. Mohney R.P. O'Bryan J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 550-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This protein has been implicated in aggregate formation due to its localization to aggregates, ability to transiently move in and out of polyQ aggregates, and effect on aggregate formation and/or neurodegeneration (14Kim S. Nollen E.A. Kitagawa K. Bindokas V.P. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that UIMs may be recruited to aggregates via an interaction with Hsp70. To determine whether the interaction with Hsp70 mediates the recruitment of UIMs to polyQ-expanded proteins, we examined the interaction of the various UIMs with endogenous Hsp70. As expected, the UIMs of epsin bound very well to Hsp70. In addition, the S5A, ataxin-3, and Eps15 UIMs also bound to Hsp70 but to a lesser degree as compared with the epsin UIM chimera. However, we did not observe a correlation between the ability of a UIM protein to bind Hsp70 and its recruitment to polyQ aggregates, suggesting that recruitment to the aggregate is not mediated by Hsp70 binding (Fig. 4C). Expression of Ataxin-3 and S5A UIMs Decreased the Total Number of Aggregates Formed by Htt-Q65—Given the recruitment of S5A, ataxin-3, Hrs, and Eps15 UIMs to inclusion bodies, we examined whether the UIMs had any effect on aggregate formation by Htt-Q65-CFP using a cell-based assay. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with GST or GST-UIMs at varying doses along with Htt-Q65-CFP. Forty-eight hours following transfection, cells were examined for aggregate formation. Expression of either ataxin-3 or S5A UIMs resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the percentage of CFP-positive cells containing visible aggregates, whereas expression of GST alone did not affect aggregate formation (Fig. 5A). This effect on aggregate formation was specific to a subset of UIMs and did not result from altered expression of Htt-Q65 (Fig. 5B). Although both Eps15 and Hrs UIMs co-localized to Htt-Q65 aggregates (Fig. 1), expression of these UIMs did not affect aggregate formation (Fig. 5A). Similarly, UIMs that did not colocalize with Htt-Q65 aggregates had no significant effect on the formation of aggregates. Individual UIMs of S5a and Ataxin-3 Have Distinct Properties—Further analysis was undertaken to determine whether the individual UIMs of S5a and ataxin-3 were capable of localizing to the polyQ aggregates. S5a possesses two UIMs, whereas ataxin-3 has three UIMs with the second and third UIM separated by a polyQ region (Fig. 6A). Each of the separate UIMs for S5a and ataxin-3 was co-transfected into COS cells along with Htt-Q65-CFP. The second UIM of S5A co-localized with Htt-Q65 aggregates, whereas the first UIM did not (Fig. 6B). Similarly, the second UIM of ataxin-3 co-localized with Htt-Q65 aggregates, whereas the first and third UIMs did not (Fig. 6D). In both cases, however, the localization pattern of the individual UIMs was distinct from that of the full UIM region. Whereas the full UIM constructs from S5a and ataxin-3 were localized throughout the aggregate, UIM2 of ataxin-3 localized in a ring pattern surrounding the aggregate. In the case of UIM2 of S5A, two distinct patterns of localization were observed: a ring pattern similar to UIM2 of ataxin-3 and a punctate pattern (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, in the S5a UIM2 expressing cells, the localization of Htt-Q65-CFP was punctate and cytosolic, suggesting that UIM2 may inhibit or disrupt aggregation, resulting in smaller polyQ aggregates (Fig. 6B). Expression of combinations of ataxin-3 UIMs resulted in different patterns of localization with Htt-Q65-CFP compared with the individual UIMs. Although UIM2 localized in a ring pattern to Htt-Q65-CFP, the presence of UIM1 blocked the interaction of UIM1-2 with Htt-Q65. UIM2-3 localized in a ring pattern within the Htt-Q65 aggregate (Fig. 6D). Given the effect of S5a and ataxin-3 UIMs on Htt aggregation, we next examined whether the individual UIMs or combinations of UIMs retained the ability to inhibit polyQ aggregate formation. Expression of UIM2 of S5a resulted in a 50% decrease in the number of cells with aggregates similar to the effect of expressing both UIMs of S5a (Fig. 6C). In contrast, the first UIM did not affect aggregate formation (Fig. 6C). In the case of ataxin-3, expression of the second UIM resulted in a 20% decrease in the fraction of cells with aggregates, whereas expression of the first or third UIMs was without effect (Fig. 6E). Since the individual UIMs of ataxin-3 did not reduce aggregate formation to the same extent as all three UIMs together, we transfected combinations of the UIMs of ataxin-3 with the Htt-Q65-CFP. Expression of UIM1-2 led to a similar decrease as UIM2 alone. However, UIM2-3 had no significant effect on aggregate formation (Fig. 6E). Thus, in the case of ataxin-3, all three UIMs are required for the maximal reduction in aggregate formation, whereas the isolated UIM2 of S5a is sufficient for maximal inhibition. Recent work has demonstrated that ubiquitin binding proteins are recruited to aggregates formed by polyQ-expanded proteins (4Donaldson K.M. Li W. Ching K.A. Batalov S. Tsai C.C. Joazeiro C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 15Doi H. Mitsui K. Kurosawa M. Machida Y. Kuroiwa Y. Nukina N. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Wang G. Sawai N. Kotliarova S. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Davidson J.D. Riley B. Burright E.N. Duvick L.A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the case of ataxin-3, the ubiquitin binding activity of UIMs appeared necessary for recruitment to the aggregates, since mutation of conserved residues in the UIM that are necessary for ubiquitin binding inhibited co-localization of ataxin-3 with the polyQ aggregates (4Donaldson K.M. Li W. Ching K.A. Batalov S. Tsai C.C. Joazeiro C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that the UIMs of S5A, ataxin-3, Hrs, and Eps15 localized to polyQ-expanded Htt, although the pattern of localization varied between different UIMs (Fig. 1). This difference in co-localization may reflect when the UIM interacts with the misfolded polyQ protein during aggregate formation. In the early stages of aggregate formation, the polyQ monomer undergoes misfolding to form a nucleus (i.e. the core of the aggregate). Following a fast extension phase, additional monomers are added to the nucleus to form the insoluble aggregate (18Chen S. Ferrone F.A. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11884-11889Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that aggregates consist of a central core region containing the insoluble protease-resistant mutant Htt fibrils and a nonprotease resistant shell region containing soluble mutant Htt (19Qin Z.H. Gu Z.L. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2004; 25: 1243-1249PubMed Google Scholar, 20Matsumoto G. Kim S. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4477-4485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our data support the hypothesis that the aggregate consists of different regions with specific characteristics that allow recruitment of different UIMs. Both ataxin-3 and S5A UIMs are found throughout Htt aggregates. However, the Hrs and Eps15 UIM chimeras are not found within the central region of the aggregate but rather localize in a ring pattern surrounding the aggregate. These different patterns of localization may signify the early recruitment of the S5A and ataxin-3 versus a later recruitment of the Hrs and Eps15 UIMs during aggregate formation. This difference in recruitment may account for the differential inhibition of aggregate formation by ataxin-3 and S5a UIMs versus Hrs and Eps15 UIMs. In contrast to the S5a, Hrs, Eps15, and ataxin-3 UIMs, other UIMs were not recruited to aggregates, although several of these UIMs bind avidly to polyubiquitin chains (Fig. 1) (6Miller S.L. Malotky E. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33528-33537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that UIMs bind purified Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains but with varying affinities (6Miller S.L. Malotky E. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33528-33537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similar results were seen when evaluating the ability of UIMs to bind purified Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains (Fig. 3). The UIMs from KIAA1594 bound to Lys48- and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains as well as or better than the UIMs from S5A, ataxin-3, Eps15, and Hrs. Similarly, KIAA1594 UIMs bound to ubiquitinated cellular proteins as well as or better than the UIMs from Hrs, ataxin-3, and Eps15 (6Miller S.L. Malotky E. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33528-33537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the KIAA1594 UIMs were not recruited to Htt-Q65 aggregates. These data demonstrate that although ubiquitin binding may be necessary for recruitment of UIMs to polyQ-expanded aggregates (4Donaldson K.M. Li W. Ching K.A. Batalov S. Tsai C.C. Joazeiro C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), this property is not sufficient for recruitment to the aggregates. Comparison of the binding pattern of UIMs to Lys48-linked versus Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains revealed both similarities and differences in UIM recognition of these different species. As with recognition of Lys48-linked chains, the degree of binding to Lys63-linked chains did not directly correspond to the number of UIMs in a given protein. For example, S5a bound Lys63-linked chains better than ataxin-3, although it has one less UIM than ataxin-3. However, binding to shorter Lys63-linked chains inversely corresponded to the number of UIMs; the more UIMs present, the greater the binding to shorter Lys63-linked chains. In support of this observation, the single UIM-containing chimeras (Hrs, KIAA1386, or USP25) bound to di-, tri-, or tetraubiquitin chains to a far lesser degree than the multiple UIM-containing chimeras. This phenomenon is most likely due to the difference in structure between Lys48- and Lys63-linked chains. The Lys48-linked diubiquitin chain has a closed conformation with the hydrophobic binding surface located on the interdomain interface (21Varadan R. Walker O. Pickart C. Fushman D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, the structure of the Lys63 diubiquitin chain has an open extended conformation with no interaction between the hydrophobic binding surfaces of the two ubiquitins. Thus, the presence of multiple UIMs may lead to increase contact with the single ubiquitins located within the Lys63-linked chains. To determine the protein(s) responsible for recruitment of UIMs to Htt-Q65 aggregates, we examined the interaction of the UIMs with a variety of proteins, including mutant Htt-Q65, Hsp70, and several ubiquitin-like proteins, and found no direct correlation between binding and recruitment (Figs. 2 and 4). Recently, Regan-Klapisz et al. (22Regan-Klapisz E. Sorokina I. Voortman J. de Keizer P. Roovers R.C. Verheesen P. Urbe S. Fallon L. Fon E.A. Verkleij A. Benmerah A. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4437-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) indicated that Eps15 and Hrs are recruited into cytoplasmic aggregates through an interaction with ubiquilin, another ubiquitin-like protein. This interaction may be responsible for localization of these two UIMs into the shell region of the polyQ aggregate. However, the recruitment differences between S5a, ataxin-3, Hrs, and Eps15 UIMs suggest ubiquilin is not responsible for the recruitment of S5a and ataxin-3 UIMs to the central region of the aggregate. These data also imply that there are distinct differences between mutant Htt aggregates and aggregates induced upon proteasome inhibition, since Eps15 localized differently in these aggregates (22Regan-Klapisz E. Sorokina I. Voortman J. de Keizer P. Roovers R.C. Verheesen P. Urbe S. Fallon L. Fon E.A. Verkleij A. Benmerah A. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4437-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We demonstrate for the first time that a subset of UIMs (epsin, ataxin-3, S5a, Hrs, and USP25) interact with SUMO in addition to ubiquitin (Fig. 4). Recent studies have uncovered a short peptide motif that binds to SUMO (23Minty A. Dumont X. Kaghad M. Caput D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the SUMO-interacting motif (SIM)-SUMO binding surface is separate and distinct from the UIM-ubiquitin interface (24Hecker C.M. Rabiller M. Haglund K. Bayer P. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16117-16127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). These observations raise the intriguing possibility that SUMO may be able to either simultaneously interact with a subset of UIM-as well as SIM-containing proteins or that UIM- and SIM-containing proteins compete for binding to SUMO. Future studies will be needed to address these possibilities. In contrast to the interaction with ubiquitin and SUMO, we did not observe binding of any of the UIMs tested to the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8. This result suggests that UIMs exhibit some selectivity in the interactions with different ubiquitin-like proteins. A recent study by Yarden and co-workers (25Oved S. Mosesson Y. Zwang Y. Santonico E. Shtiegman K. Marmor M.D. Kochupurakkal B.S. Katz M. Lavi S. Cesareni G. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21640-21651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) suggests that the UIMs of Hgs binds the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8; however, this interaction was not shown to be a direct UIM-NEDD8 interaction. Thus, it is possible that the UIM-dependent interaction of Hgs with NEDD8 may be indirect and mediated by one or more proteins. The in vitro binding data demonstrate striking differences between UIMs in their protein/protein interactions despite their small size and highly conserved core residues. These differences further highlight the importance of nonconserved amino acids in determining the protein/protein interactions of a UIM (6Miller S.L. Malotky E. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33528-33537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and suggest that UIMs may be further classified by their interactions with SUMO, Hsp70, or ubiquilin. The S5a and ataxin-3 UIMs not only co-localized to polyQ aggregates but also decreased aggregate formation. Surprisingly, the Eps15 and Hrs UIMs had no effect on aggregate formation despite their association with the aggregate (Fig. 5). This difference may be due to the specific localization of the UIM. Both ataxin-3 and S5A UIMs are uniformly distributed throughout the aggregate, suggesting that these UIMs are either recruited during the early phases of aggregate formation or penetrate the insoluble core of the aggregate. Evaluation of the separate UIMs of ataxin-3 further supports this hypothesis. The first and third UIMs of ataxin-3 when expressed alone did not co-localize to the mutant Htt aggregates and had no effect on aggregate formation. The second UIM displayed a ring pattern of co-localization similar to Eps15 but did not affect aggregation as significantly as UIM1 to -3 of ataxin-3 (Fig. 6D). Thus, in the case of the ataxin-3, all three UIMs work in combination for reducing aggregate formation. This chimera was the only one that was recruited throughout the aggregate, further supporting the premise that an interaction within the central region of the aggregate is responsible for the extensive inhibition of aggregation. Although ataxin-3 contains a polyQ repeat between UIM2 and UIM3, this region does not appear to contribute to localization with polyQ-expanded proteins (4Donaldson K.M. Li W. Ching K.A. Batalov S. Tsai C.C. Joazeiro C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Evaluation of the separate UIMs of S5A revealed several differences from the ataxin-3 chimeras. Similar to the first and third UIMs of ataxin-3, the first UIM of S5A did not co-localize and had no effect on aggregate formation. However, expression of the second UIM of S5a decreased aggregate formation to a similar level as the two UIMs of S5a (Fig. 6C). Thus, a single UIM was sufficient to decrease Htt-Q65 aggregates. Furthermore, the second UIM of S5A demonstrated two different patterns of recruitment. In the first pattern, the UIM localized in a ring surrounding the central portion of the aggregate. In the second pattern, the UIM was localized in a punctate pattern as if there were miniaggregates. Thirty-eight percent of aggregate positive cells exhibited this second pattern of localization. It has been suggested that quasiaggregates are formed prior to the appearance of mature aggregates (26Garcia-Mata R. Bebok Z. Sorscher E.J. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 27Garcia-Mata R. Gao Y.S. Sztul E. Traffic. 2002; 3: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). These quasiaggregates are transported by microtubules to the microtubule organizing center, where they are assembled into a spherical aggregate known as the aggresome (27Garcia-Mata R. Gao Y.S. Sztul E. Traffic. 2002; 3: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 28Johnston J.A. Illing M.E. Kopito R.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2002; 53: 26-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These data suggest that UIM2 of S5a may disrupt the transport of miniaggregates into the aggresome. However, it remains to be determined whether UIM2 prevents formation of the mature aggregates, disrupts mature aggregates once formed, or both. These data also suggest that the mechanism for decreasing aggregation may vary between UIMs. A recent study by Bonini and co-workers (29Warrick J.M. Morabito L.M. Bilen J. Gordesky-Gold B. Faust L.Z. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) demonstrates that overexpression of wild type ataxin-3 decreased aggregation of polyQ-expanded proteins and suppressed polyQ-mediated neurodegeneration. These effects were dependent on the ubiquitin-binding activity of the UIMs. Thus, both isolated UIMs as well as UIMs in the context of the wild type protein inhibit polyQ aggregation. These findings raise the intriguing possibility that expression of isolated UIMs may alter the toxicity of polyQ-expanded proteins, such as Htt. Future studies will be necessary to evaluate this possibility. We thank Dr. Peter Reinhart for providing the CFP-tagged Htt constructs and members of the O'Bryan laboratory for many helpful comments and suggestions."
