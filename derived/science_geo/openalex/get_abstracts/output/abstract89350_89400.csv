https://openalex.org/W2112531993,"The theory and instrumentation for Fourier transform infrared spectrometry are discussed. These instruments measure infrared spectra of the same quality as spectra measured on grating spectrometers in about one thousandth of the time. Their sensitivity advantage for spectra measured in equal times is between a factor of 10 and 100. Commercial spectrometers are now available from nine vendors in North America. Important areas of chemistry include atmospheric monitoring, surface chemistry, and on-line identification of chromatographically separated materials. Many new biochemical and biomedical applications are also becoming apparent, including investigations of phase transitions in lipids and studies of the biocompatibility of implant polymers."
https://openalex.org/W2160502870,"SUMMARY Capillary electrophoresis offers the possibility of rapid and effective separations in an instrumental format. The two most serious obstacles for future development are the present insufficient detector sensitivity and residual adsorption of solutes to the capillary surface. Capillaries offer some advantages over traditional gel systems. Efficient heat dissipation from capillaries permits the application of unusually high voltages which results in fast and efficient separations. On-line sample injection and detection along with the reusable nature of capillaries makes this format suitable for automation. This could be a significant advantage in situations where repetitive analyses must be run. Capillaries lend themselves to collection of accurate physico-chemical data such as mobilities from migration times and diffusion coefficients from zone widths. They are also an ideal system in which to investigate non-aqueous separation media (ref. 14). Forming gels in a variety of non-aqueous solvents might be difficult, and capillaries offer an uncomplicated approach to the problem. Non-aqueous solvents, although not traditional in electrophoresis, offer exciting possibilities. The wider range of acid and base strengths possible in solvents other than water, as well as the ability to solvate very hydrophobic solutes, could greatly expand the range of substances amenable to electrophoretic separation and analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2079533282,Fluoride is one of the most potent but least well understood stimulators of bone formation in vivo. Bone formation was shown to arise from direct effects on bone cells. Treatment with sodium fluoride increased proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity of bone cells in vitro and increased bone formation in embryonic calvaria at concentrations that stimulate bone formation in vivo.
https://openalex.org/W1992673531,Blink-startle responses to vibroacoustic stimulation were monitored ultrasonically in human fetuses of known gestational age. Responses were first elicited between 24 and 25 weeks of gestational age and were present consistently after 28 weeks. Defining the developmental sequence for audition provides a foundation for diagnosing deafness and recognizing aberrant responses antenatally.
https://openalex.org/W2080773262,"We have studied assembly of acetylcholine receptor in vivo using subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies and immunoprecipitation with alpha-bungarotoxin and antitoxin. We have identified three distinct forms of the alpha subunit. The newly synthesized alpha subunit species has a sedimentation coefficient of 5S and is recognized only by antibody specific for SDS-denatured alpha subunit. We have called this species alpha 61. The 5S alpha Tx species is not associated with beta subunits and is probably monomeric. alpha Tx is formed from alpha 61 with a half-time of 15 min and an efficiency of approximately equal to 30%. Formation of alpha Tx involves a conformational change, and we suggest that this conformation is dependent upon or stabilized by disulfide bond formation. The assembly of alpha Tx with beta subunits (and probably gamma and delta) into a 9S complex appears to be an efficient but slow process requiring more than 90 min. Unassembled alpha 61 subunits are degraded rapidly. However, subunit degradation is a result of failure to assemble, rather than its cause."
https://openalex.org/W1509083776,"Using an assay of the rate of crystal growth of calcium [14C]oxalate monohydrate, we ascertained that the factor responsible for more than 90% of the crystal growth inhibition in human urine is a nondialyzable macromolecule. We have purified this factor using DEAE-cellulose chromatography, followed by Bio-Gel P-10 column chromatography with 50% formamide as the eluent, and finally by gel permeation chromatography. About 5 mg of the inhibitor was obtained from normal 24-h adult urine, with 16% recovery of the original inhibitory activity. The inhibitor isolated was found to be a highly acidic glycoprotein with Mr = 1.4 X 10(4). It is rich in acidic amino acids, including gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, and contains few aromatic and basic amino acids. Two or three phosphate groups are covalently linked to the inhibitor. In the presence of the inhibitor, the kinetics of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystal growth inhibitor showed that the macromolecule binds to the crystal surface according to a Langmuir adsorption isotherm with a dissociation constant, Kd = 5.3 X 10(-7) M. The inhibitor readily formed an insoluble monolayer at the air-water interface and showed an unusually high surface stability with a collapse pressure of 41.5 dynes/cm. The urinary inhibitor closely resembled in all properties the calcium oxalate monohydrate crystal growth inhibitor that we had isolated from human embryonic kidney tissue culture medium (Nakagawa, Y., Margolis, H. C., Yokoyama, S., Kezdy, F. J., Kaiser, E. T., and Coe, F. L. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3936-3944)."

The final product was purified approximately 260-fold from the starting material and was maximally active in assays of cell spreading-promoting activity at 300 ng/ml. The isolated human SF preparation consisted of two proteins of apparent molecular weights approximately 65,000 (SF65) and 75,000 (SF75). Both SF65 and SF75 have been shown previously to exhibit cell spreading-promoting activity and to bind monoclonal antibody to human serum SF."
https://openalex.org/W2136219225,"Ultraviolet irradiation (UV) of cadmium-sensitive S49 mouse cells induces a large increase in cadmium-resistant variants. About 30%-40% of these variants make metallothionein (MT)-I mRNA while S49 cells do not. S49 cells contain two copies of the MT-I gene; both alleles are heavily methylated but can be conveniently distinguished by the methylation status of a single Hpa II site. In lines expressing MT-I, one allele becomes completely demethylated at all methylation-sensitive restriction sites examined over at least a 2.5 kb region spanning the MT-I gene. Activation of a quiescent gene by UV has implications for understanding the initiation of carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2021594721,"We have injected plasmids containing a repeating unit (spacer plus gene) of Xenopus laevis ribosomal DNA into fertilized eggs. Transcription on these plasmids begins at the same time as transcription on the endogenous ribosomal genes (late blastula stage). Previous work defined the ribosomal gene promoter as the region from −140 to +6 around the site of transcription initiation ( Reeder et al., 1982 Reeder R.H. Wilkinson J. Bakken A. Morgan G. Busby S.J. Roan J. Sollner-Webb B. Evidence for two functional regions in the Xenopus laevis RNA polymerase I promoter. in: Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Cell. 1982; 30: 835-842 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar ; Sollner-Webb et al., submitted). We show here that the level of transcription of the injected ribosomal genes is strongly affected by spacer sequences far upstream of the promoter. Deletion of spacer sequences over 1150 by from the initiation site reduces the transcription signal from injected plasmids by a factor of 5–10. We propose that the upstream spacer sequences act to influence the frequency of promoter activation."
https://openalex.org/W1992207507,"Male and female rats exhibit sex differences in binding by serotonin 1 receptors in discrete areas of the brain, some of which have been implicated in the control of ovulation and of gonadotropin release. The sex-specific changes in binding, which occur in response to the same hormonal (estrogenic) stimulus, are due to changes in the number of binding sites. Castration alone also affects the number of binding sites in certain areas. The results lead to the conclusion that peripheral hormones modulate binding by serotonin 1 receptors. The status of the serotonin receptor system may affect the reproductive capacity of an organism and may be related to sex-linked emotional disturbances in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2010060497,"The response properties of hair cells and nerve fibers in the alligator lizard cochlea are frequency selective and tonotopically organized with longitudinal position in the organ. The lengths of the hair-cell hair bundles also vary monotonically with longitudinal position. In this study, quantitative measurements were made of the motion of individual hair bundles in an excised preparation of the cochlea stimulated at auditory frequencies. The angular displacement of hair bundles is frequency selective and tonotopically organized, demonstrating the existence of a micromechanical tuning mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1978365731,"A pseudomemory of having been awakened by some loud noises during a night of the previous week was suggested to 27 highly hypnotizable subjects during hypnosis. Posthypnotically, 13 of them stated that the suggested event had actually occurred. This finding has implications for the investigative use of hypnosis in a legal context."
https://openalex.org/W2030355915,"A series of near-diploid embryonal carcinoma-like hybrid cells were obtained from polyethylene glycol mediated cell fusion between murine embryonal carcinoma cells (PSA-6TG1 or OTF9-63) having one X chromosome and thymocytes or bone marrow cells from female mice carrying Cattanach's or Searle's translocation. Prior to fusion with EC cells the somatic cells are presumed to contain only one active X chromosome. Following hybrid formation, the chronology of X chromosome replication and the expression of X-linked gene Pgk-1 indicated that all X chromosomes contributed by both parents were active in these hybrids. Experiments were performed to rule out the possibility that the hybrids were formed by fusion of EC cells with rare somatic cells in which both X chromosomes were active. Taken together the data indicate that within four days of fusion there is reactivation of the entire inactive X chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2006612594,"Plasmids have been constructed containing reiterated copies of a 66 bp fragment, loosely referred to as the ribosome binding site, that includes the AUG initiator codon of preproinsulin. The extreme test involved plasmid 255/17, which carried four tandem copies of the ribosome binding site, with all four AUG triplets in the same reading frame as the preproinsulin coding sequence downstream. Initiation at any potential start site would generate a polypeptide precipitable with anti-insulin antiserum, and its size would reveal the AUG(s) active in initiation. One insulin-related polypeptide was synthesized in cells transfected by p255/17; its size corresponded to the product initiated at the first ribosome binding site in the tandem array. In as much as the three downstream AUG triplets, which are not used, occur in a sequence context identical with that around the 5′-proximal AUG triplet, which is used, the position of an AUG triplet relative to the 5′ end of the mRNA appears to be important in identifying it as a functional initiator codon."

Variations in the electromechanical effect with acoustic stimulus parameters and observed physiological vulnerability suggest that cochlear hair cells are the biophysical origin of the process. Cochlear hair cells have traditionally been thought of as passive receptor cells, but they may play an active role in cochlear micromechanics."
https://openalex.org/W1596666497,"Abstract Ascorbic acid transport by bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells in primary cultures has been characterized. Ascorbic acid uptake can be measured by either high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection or radiometric techniques with L-[1-14C]ascorbic acid. The transport system is temperature- and energy-dependent and exhibits Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent Km of 29 microM when the external Na+ concentration is 150 mM. Uptake of ascorbate by chromaffin cells is ouabain-sensitive and dependent on the presence of external Na+. Ascorbate transport by chromaffin cells is, thus, an active process driven by the Na+ electrochemical gradient. The kinetics of this co-transport system fits an type model where binding of Na+ to the carrier increases the affinity to ascorbate and vice versa. Thus, the data suggest that binding of either Na+ or ascorbate induces a conformational change in the transporter, which results in a change in the association constant for the second ligand while the mobility of the carrier remains unchanged. Cellular uptake of ascorbate into adrenomedullary chromaffin cells appears to be followed by its distribution into several subcellular compartments. One subcellular compartment for concentration of ascorbate is the chromaffin vesicle where it accumulates at a relatively slow rate. The interrelationships between ascorbate transport and other aspects of ascorbate metabolism and chromaffin vesicle function and dopamine beta-hydroxylation are also considered."
https://openalex.org/W1601482124,"Glucose deprivation induces the major glucose regulated proteins (GRPs) in Chinese hamster ovary cells. When these cells are then returned to a glucose containing environment, GRP synthesis is repressed while concurrently other proteins, identified as heat shock proteins, are induced. The induction of the GRPs is found to mark precisely the onset of a decline in the cell's ability to survive a thermal stress while the expression of heat shock proteins, when glucose is restored, is paralleled by significant increases in survival protection or thermotolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1590074770,The in vivo unidirectional flux between creatine phosphate and ATP was determined in the leg and head of the anesthetized rat using a two-dimensional NMR technique. The unidirectional flux of creatine phosphate to ATP was 13 mumol/s/g-weight in the leg and 2 mumol/s/g-weight in the head. The unidirectional flux between ATP and inorganic phosphate was too slow to be detected and was estimated to be less than 0.1 mumol/s/g-weight.
https://openalex.org/W1502685532,"Removal of calcium from thrombospondin with EDTA results in a decrease in the intensity of the negative CD peak between 200 and 250 nm. Quantitative analysis of the CD spectrum of thrombospondin indicates that thrombospondin contains approximately 11% alpha-helix, 43% beta-sheet, and 46% random coil in the presence of calcium and that a small change in secondary structure may occur upon removal of calcium with EDTA. When the change in the CD at 220 nm is measured as a function of calcium concentration, a sigmoidal curve with a transition midpoint of 120 microM is obtained, indicating that the binding is cooperative. Analysis of Hill plots of the data revealed a Hill coefficient of 12.3. Calcium was also found to affect the peptide pattern produced by limited tryptic digestion of thrombospondin, with some portions of the molecule being resistant to trypsin in the presence of calcium. When the change in quantity of a 65,000-dalton tryptic fragment was measured as a function of calcium concentration, a sigmoidal curve was again obtained. The midpoint of this transition is achieved at a free calcium concentration of 45 microM at 0 degrees C and 103 microM at 25 degrees C. These data indicate that thrombospondin contains at least 12 binding sites for calcium and that cooperative interactions between sites are associated with a conformational change in the thrombospondin molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1582030318,"X-ray absorption edge and extended x-ray absorption fine structure studies have been undertaken on resting (ferric) horseradish peroxidase, HRP compound I (HRP-I), HRP compound II (HRP-II), and several highly oxidized synthetic iron porphyrins that may have relevance as models for the iron site in horseradish peroxidase. The energies of the absorption edges are consistent with an Fe(IV) formulation for the highly oxidized species. The shapes of the absorption edges further support the assignment of HRP-I and one of the model compounds as Fe(IV)-porphyrin pi-cations. The edge shapes also demonstrate that the iron sites in the model porphyrins are not identical to the iron sites in the enzyme. Preliminary curve fitting analysis of the extended x-ray absorption fine structure clearly indicates the presence of two different nearest neighbor distances for the iron, both in HRP-I and HRP-II, as well as in two of the highly oxidized model porphyrins. These distances are interpreted as an iron-porphyrin nitrogen distance and as a short (approximately 1.6 A) iron-oxygen distance."
https://openalex.org/W2036643534,"Fluorinated anesthetics were observed noninvasively in the brain of intact rabbits with fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. High-resolution fluorine-19 spectra of halothane, methoxyflurane, and isoflurane were obtained with a surface coil centered over the calvarium. Elimination of halothane from the brain was also monitored by this technique. Residual fluorine-19 signals from halothane (or a metabolite) could be detected as long as 98 hours after termination of anesthesia. These observations demonstrate the feasibility of using this technique to study the fate of fluorinated anesthetics in live mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1499528718,"The toxic peptide from Conus magus venom (conotoxin MI) is a 14-amino acid peptide (McIntosh, M., Cruz, L. J., Hunkapiller, M. W., Gray, W. R., and Olivera, B. M. (1982) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 218, 329-334) which inhibits the acetylcholine receptor. In this work we have confirmed the primary structure and established the disulfide bonding configuration (Cys 3-Cys 8; Cys 4-Cys 14) by direct chemical synthesis of the toxin with specific disulfide bridges. Natural and synthetic toxins were compared by several methods. Fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy confirmed that the synthetic product had the expected molecular mass and number of exchangeable hydrogens. Ultraviolet CD spectra were closely comparable in shape and magnitude for the two materials, which were also identical in biological activity and chromatographic behavior. We have also established that, although the peptide is highly cross-linked with two disulfide bridges, it can slowly equilibrate between two conformations. A simulation analysis suggests that the conformers have half-lives of approximately 12 and approximately 72 min at 0 degrees C, decreasing approximately 2-fold for every 10 degrees C increase in temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1555953993,"Thymidylate synthase-negative mutants of cultured mouse cells were immediately committed to cell death upon thymidine deprivation, especially when the cells were synchronized in the S phase. Thymidylate deprivation induced single strand breaks in chromosome-size DNA strands, as measured by alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation, giving rise to two peaks, one with large and the other with small fragments, the latter about the size of T4 DNA. An increase in the small DNA fragments paralleled that of thymineless death. Thymidine deprivation also produced double strand DNA fragments as determined by a method of neutral filter elution, and their extent paralleled that of cell death. Double-stranded DNA eluted through the filter sedimented as a single peak both in a neutral and in an alkaline sucrose gradient that coincided with that of the above small DNA fragments. Therefore, the strand breaks seemed to occur in some defined portions of the genome and in a specific manner compared to breaks induced by x-rays, which occurred rather randomly. Cycloheximide blocked both thymineless death and the production of the small DNA fragments. The strand breaks induced by thymidine starvation were not repaired but instead advanced on subsequent incubation of the cells in growth medium containing thymidine."
https://openalex.org/W1980545305,"After subcutaneous injection, monoclonal antibodies directed against a tumor can enter local lymphatic vessels, pass to the draining lymph nodes, and bind to metastases there. Lymphatic delivery of antibody to early metastases is more efficient than intravenous administration, and the lymphatic route can be used to image smaller metastatic deposits. Perhaps more important, the lymphatic route minimizes binding of antibodies to circulating tumor antigens and to cross-reactive antigens present on normal tissues. Antibodies inappropriate for intravenous use because of binding to normal tissues may therefore be useful against lymph node metastases when injected subcutaneously or directly into lymphatic vessels."
https://openalex.org/W100090922,"Spontaneous calcium release from purified light sarcoplasmic reticulum has been previously described (Palade, P., Mitchell, R. D., and Fleischer, S. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8098-8107) and found to be distinct from several other forms of Ca2+ release. Ca2+ release occurs after a lag period following active Ca2+ preloading and depletion of extravesicular Ca2+. In the present study, we find that local anesthetics inhibit spontaneous Ca2+ release, in a time-dependent manner, varying considerably in the preincubation time required to exert maximal effect. At pH 7.0, hydrophilic and mostly charged local anesthetics, such as procaine, procainamide, and N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl carbamoyl methyl)triethyl ammonium bromide, inhibit Ca2+ release only after long preincubations (hours), whereas more hydrophobic local anesthetics are effective after only a short incubation (minutes) with sarcoplasmic reticulum. The more hydrophobic anesthetics take somewhat longer to reach equilibrium, as studied by inhibition of unidirectional Ca2+ efflux, and there is a direct relationship between hydrophobic partition coefficient and half-time to reach equilibrium. Agents known to inhibit permeability pathways for monovalent cations i.e. K+ channel blockers (decamethonium and n-dodecane-1, 12-N,N,N,N',N',N'-hexamethyl-bis-ammonium) or the anion blocker (4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid), do not inhibit spontaneous Ca2+ release. Carbonyl cyanide m-fluorophenylhydrazone, a protonophore, and gramicidin D, a monovalent cation ionophore, have no effect on Ca2+ release whether local anesthetics are present or not, while the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 relieves inhibition of Ca2+ release by local anesthetics. Ruthenium red does not inhibit spontaneous Ca2+ release. These findings suggest that the binding site(s) for local anesthetics is located on the inner face of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane and that local anesthetics interact directly with a Ca2+ channel rather than with other permeability pathways which might indirectly influence Ca2+ channel gating."
https://openalex.org/W1500297678,"The fourth component of complement (C4) was found to incorporate radiolabel from [35S]O4 during synthesis in murine peritoneal macrophages and the human hepatoma-derived cell line, HepG2. The sulfate label was localized to the COOH-terminal autolytic fragment of the C4 alpha-chain. No label was seen associated with intracellular pro-C4. The structurally similar third and fifth components of complement, and alpha 2-macroglobulin, did not incorporate labeled sulfate. Tryptic peptides from [35S]O4-labeled C4 alpha-chain were analyzed by reversed phase liquid chromatography and found to elute in a single, homogeneous peak, suggesting a unique sulfation site in the C4 alpha-chain. Thin layer chromatography of a base hydrolysate of [35S]O4-labeled C4 alpha-chains, or C4 isolated from human plasma, revealed the presence of tyrosine-O-sulfate. The possible significance of this unusual amino acid modification for the function of C4 is unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1972257245,"Some homeotic genes of Drosophila are active only in particular developmental compartments (""selector"" genes) whereas others are active in all compartments and are responsible for regulating selector gene expression. Using pole cell transplants to generate mosaic females with mutant germ lines, we examine the extent to which genes of both classes are required during oogenesis. We find that none of four selector genes (Ultrabithorax+, Antennapedia+, Sex combs reduced+, and engrailed+) is required for the development of viable eggs, and none contributes detectable product to the fertilized zygote. Similarly, neither of two regulatory genes (Polycomb+ and extra sex combs+) are required for normal oogenesis. However, both are active in the germ line and contribute functional gene product to the embryo. These results suggest that selector genes are inactive in the germ line where they may be regulated by a different mechanism than in the soma."
https://openalex.org/W2084021257,"Massive dendritic sprouting was induced in identified giant reticulospinal neurons of the lamprey by axotomy close to the soma. An axonal lesion slightly farther from the cell body induced new growth from both dendrites and axon. The amount of new growth per cell was the same whether it originated from the dendrites alone or from axonal and dendritic compartments. The location of the axonal lesion therefore determines where, in the neuron, membrane is inserted to produce the new neurites. The dendritic tree of a differentiated vertebrate central neuron was shown to have sufficient plasticity to extend new growth for several millimeters beyond the normal dendritic domain."
https://openalex.org/W1514308108,"The current studies were undertaken to characterize the localization and regulation of cholesterol synthesis and acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity in rat intestinal crypt and villus cells. Both parameters were determined in groups of animals with widely varying sterol fluxes across the intestinal mucosa. In animals on control diet the rates of cholesterol synthesis, measured by the incorporation of [3H]water per mg of protein, were similar along the villus/crypt axis in the jejunum, whereas in the ileum, villus cells were significantly more active than crypt cells. In both areas, however, the majority of total synthetic activity was found in cells from the crypts and lower villi. In contrast, the highest specific and total acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity was recovered in the villus cells of the jejunum and ileum. Dietary cholesterol did not affect sterol synthesis in any of the cell fractions but increased acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity approximately 2-fold in jejunal cell fractions. Inhibition of cholesterol absorption or sequestration of intestinal bile acids stimulated sterol synthetic activity up to 7-fold, and this occurred mainly in the lower villus and crypt cells in both jejunum and ileum. An increased demand for lipoprotein cholesterol, generated by triglyceride feeding, similarly was associated with enhanced synthetic rates. However, unlike cholesterol feeding, these manipulations did not increase acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity in any of the villus cell fractions. These studies suggest, therefore, that the intracellular pools of cholesterol that regulate the rate of cholesterol synthesis and the rate of cholesterol esterification are functionally distinct."
https://openalex.org/W1563015144,"The complete amino acid sequence of the NH2-terminal domain obtained after trypsin digestion of human plasma fibronectin has been determined. It contains residues 1-259 and has a Mr of 29,000. The 29-kDa fragment was isolated from the other major tryptic cleavage products of 200, 180, and 31 kDa by affinity chromatography on gelatin- and heparin-Sepharose columns. The two high Mr fragments bound to gelatin and were easily removed; the 31-kDa fragment failed to bind to heparin while the 29-kDa fragment did and was eluted with 0.15 M NaCl. The 29-kDa domain has a blocked NH2-terminal (pyrrolidone carboxylic acid) which was removed by digestion with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase, and the amino acid sequence of the first 36 residues was obtained. The sequence showed a glutamine residue at position 3 which is probably the acceptor site for transglutaminase as reported for bovine fibronectin. Extensive trypsin digestion of the completely reduced and alkylated 29-kDa fragment yielded twenty-four peptides which were separated and purified by high performance liquid chromatography; their amino acid composition and amino acid sequence has been determined and the arrangement of peptides was achieved by comparison with the sequence recently reported for bovine fibronectin. The sequences in human and bovine fibronectin were nearly identical with only nine amino acid differences which can all be explained by single base substitutions. Apparently this domain is highly conserved in the two species studied thus far."
https://openalex.org/W1521280325,"Abstract We have investigated the effect of size and location of the oligosaccharide chain on protease degradation of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease. The sensitivity of nonglycosylated RNase A to trypsin and chymotrypsin was compared with three glycosylated species of RNase B which differed with respect to the size of the carbohydrate chain. Two forms of glycosylated RNase B were isolated by concanavalin A-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and each was shown to contain a single carbohydrate chain composed of GlcNAc2Man1 (RNase B) or GlcNAc2Man5-8 (RNase B). A third form (RNase B'), with oligosaccharide composed of GlcNAc2Man4, was prepared by partial digestion of RNase B with alpha-mannosidase. Fully glycosylated RNase B was found to be 6-10 times more resistant to trypsin digestion than nonglycosylated RNase A. RNase B' and B, with intermediate chain sizes, were 3.0- and 1.3-fold more resistant to trypsin digestion than RNase A, respectively. With chymotrypsin, however, differences in rates of digestion were much less marked, with a maximum difference of 3-fold between RNase A and B. In addition, we found that the specificity of the primary trypsin (Arg 33-Asp 34 bond) or chymotrypsin (Tyr 25-Cys 26 bond) cleavage site was not affected by the presence or size of the oligosaccharide chain. These results are consistent with the view that the size of the oligosaccharide chain and its proximity to the primary or rate-limiting cleavage site are important for expression of the carbohydrate protection against proteolytic degradation, which thus appears to be mediated by steric hindrance."
https://openalex.org/W1553893018,"Studies from several laboratories have shown that ATP is required for DNA excision repair in UV-irradiated mammalian cells. Using permeable human fibroblasts, we have investigated this ATP requirement in detail. We find that ATP is required for specific incision of UV-damaged DNA in permeable cells. No ATP-dependent incision is seen in UV-irradiated permeable xeroderma pigmentosum (complementation group G) fibroblasts, indicating that the ATP-dependent incision observed in normal cells is part of the normal excision repair process. We conclude that, in mammalian cells, ATP is required for specific incision of UV-damaged DNA or for some obligatory step preceding incision in the excision repair pathway. ATP also protects the permeable cells from loss of the capacity to perform excision repair, probably in a nonspecific fashion. The actual synthesis of repair patches can proceed in the absence of ATP; however, our data do not exclude the possibility that ATP can also stimulate repair synthesis directly."
https://openalex.org/W1592655316,"We have demonstrated in this paper the isolation and identification of two new metabolites of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) from the kidney of the vitamin D-replete rat. These are 24-oxo-23(25-(OH)2D3 and 24,25,26,27-tetranor-23(OH)D3. Both compounds logically fit on the same metabolic pathway. 25(OH)D3 leads to 24(R),25-(OH)2D3 leads to 24-oxo-25(OH)D3 leads to 24-oxo-23,25-(OH)2D3 leads to leads to 24,25,26,27-tetranor-23(OH)D3 Each metabolite on this pathway was isolated and identified from kidneys perfused with pharmacological concentrations of 25(OH)D3. All metabolites were identified by techniques involving high performance liquid chromatography, UV spectrophotometry, and mass spectrometry. Use of 24(R),25-(OH)2D3 as the substrate gave rise to increased amounts of 24-oxo-25(OH)D3, 24-oxo-23,25-(OH)2D3, and 24,25,26,27-tetranor-23(OH)D3. In vitro studies involving perfusion of a vitamin D-replete kidney with 25(OH)D3 at a concentration of 25 nM suggest that 24-oxo-23,25-(OH)2D3 is also formed under physiological conditions. At this substrate concentration, 24(R),25-(OH)2D3 represented the major metabolite accumulating in the perfusate over the initial 2-h period but at subsequent times the concentration of 24-oxo-23,25-(OH)2D3 increased so that by the end of 6 h it was the major product remaining in the perfusate. Our work also suggests that the rate of synthesis of 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone is measurable in the intact mammalian kidney but that it is slower than the synthesis of 24(R),25-(OH)2D3 and its metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W1551716997,"Some recent studies suggest that eukaryotic cells may respond to glucocorticoids, heavy metals, or heat shock by selective increases in the synthesis of a common set of stress-related proteins, implying the existence of a common initiating mechanism. This circumstance could alter the interpretation of the mechanisms involved in other protein inductions that seemed to reflect agent-specific inductions of individual genes. To rule out the possibility of such a common induction mechanism, nearly 3,000 cellular proteins from normal rat thymic lymphocytes were separated by two-dimensional giant gel electrophoresis and examined for changes in rates of synthesis after the cells were exposed to dexamethasone, cadmium, or elevated temperatures. The three agents each induce characteristic, nonoverlapping sets of gene products. Dexamethasone increases six proteins, four within the first 15 to 45 min, and another two after 1 h; typically, these reach a 5- to 10-fold level of induction by 4 h. Cadmium induces two proteins: metallothionein (7-fold by 4 h) and a 27,000-dalton protein (appearing after 1 h, 4-fold induction by 4 h). Heat shock, besides inducing the 70,000-dalton heat shock protein often reported by others, also substantially increases at least 24 other proteins (typically 50- to 200-fold). In no case was a protein found to be inducible by more than one agent. These observations demonstrate that each agent initiates its characteristic response through a separate gene-induction mechanism. In addition to demonstrating that the heavy metal and heat shock responses are more extensive than previously realized, the results imply an agent specificity for the recently observed rapid glucocorticoid inductions that is consistent with their proposed function as initiators of the earliest metabolic hormone effects."
https://openalex.org/W2039064708,"Extracts of liver from hemizygous affected mice with the X-linked spfash mutation have 5 to 10 percent of normal ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) activity, yet the homogeneous enzyme isolated from these extracts is identical to that in controls. The OTC messenger RNA from mutant livers programs the synthesis of two distinct OTC precursor polypeptides--one normal in size, the other distinctly elongated. Both precursors are imported and proteolytically processed by mitochondria, but only the normal one is assembled into active trimer. This novel phenotype may result from a mutation in the structural gene for OTC leading, primarily, to aberrant splicing of OTC messenger RNA and, secondarily, to formation of a structurally altered precursor whose posttranslational pathway is ultimately futile because its mature mitochondrial form is not capable of assembly and functional expression."
https://openalex.org/W75241576,"Abstract Three independent mutants of the Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line (MDCK) have been isolated which were capable of growth in media containing low concentrations of potassium. All three mutants were deficient to varying extents in furosemide- and bumetanide-sensitive 22Na+, 86+b+, and 36Cl- uptake. The two mutants most resistant to low K+ media had lost essentially all of the 22Na+, 86Rb+, and 36Cl- uptake activities of this system. The third mutant was partially resistant to low K+ media and had reduced levels of bumetanide-sensitive uptake for all three ions. Extrapolated initial uptake rates for 22Na+, 86Rb+, and 36Cl- revealed that the partial mutant exhibited approximately 50% of the parental uptake rates for all three ions. The stoichiometries of bumetanide-sensitive uptake in both the parental cell line and the partial mutant approximated 1 Rb+:1 Na+:2 Cl-. The results of this study provide genetic evidence for a single tightly-coupled NaCl/KCl symporter in MDCK cells. The correlation between the ability to grow in low K+ media and decreased activity of the bumetanide-sensitive co-transport system suggests that the bumetanide-sensitive transport system catalyzes net K+ efflux from cells in low K+ media. The results of 86Rb+ efflux studies conducted on ouabain-pretreated mutant and parental cells are consistent with this interpretation. Cell volume measurements made on cells at different densities in media containing normal K+ concentrations showed that none of the mutants differed significantly in volume from the parental strain at a similar cell density. Furthermore, all three mutants were able to readjust their volume after suspension in hypotonic media. These results suggest that in the MDCK cell line, the bumetanide-sensitive NaCl/KCl symport system does not function in the regulation of cell volume under the conditions employed."

https://openalex.org/W1535079329,"It is shown that the mutagen base analogue 2-aminopurine is hydrogen-bonded at its 1-ring position when annealed with cytosine in DNA. The presence of stably hydrogen-bonded regions proximal to the 2-aminopurine-cytosine base mispair is a prerequisite for the occurrence of two hydrogen bonds coupling the bases at their 1-3- and 2-2-positions. We consider the possibility that, in the resulting heteroduplex base mispair, 2-aminopurine or cytosine may be present as a disfavored imino tautomer."
https://openalex.org/W1584958270,"Proteoglycan monomer and link protein isolated from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma both contain glycosylamine-linked oligosaccharides. In monomer, these N-linked oligosaccharides are concentrated in a region of the protein core which interacts specifically with both hyaluronate and link protein to form proteoglycan aggregates present in cartilage matrix. Chondrocyte cultures were treated with tunicamycin to inhibit synthesis of the N-linked oligosaccharides, and the ability of the deficient proteoglycan and link protein to form aggregates was studied. Cultures were pretreated with tunicamycin for 3 h and then labeled with either [3H]mannose, [3H]glucosamine, [3H]serine, or with [35S]sulfate for 6 h in the presence of tunicamycin. Formation of link protein-stabilized proteoglycan aggregates in the culture medium was inhibited by up to 40% when the cells were treated with 3 micrograms of tunicamycin/ml, a concentration which inhibited 3H incorporation with mannose as a precursor by about 90%, but by only 15% with glucosamine as a precursor. When exogenous proteoglycan aggregate was added to the culture medium, however, it was found that both endogenous monomer and link protein synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin were fully able to form link-stabilized aggregates. This suggests that glycosylamine-linked oligosaccharides on monomer and on link protein are not necessary for their specific interactions with hyaluronate and with each other. Further, although tunicamycin did not inhibit net synthesis of hyaluronate, transfer of hyaluronate from the cell layer to the culture medium was retarded. This phenomenon accounted for most if not all of the decrease in the amount of proteoglycan which formed aggregates in the medium of cultures treated with tunicamycin."

The pH investigation has been extended to the CO-binding rates of Chironomus thummi thummi erythrocruorin and Aplysia limacina Mb, whose pH rate profile is different from that of sperm whale Mb. Besides the base dissociation mechanism previously invoked, the iron atom-heme plane distance is discussed as a possible determinant of the CO reactivity in these monomeric heme proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1488023480,"Previous in vitro studies demonstrated that ATP-citrate lyase is phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase at peptide A, containing a phosphoserine residue, and by ATP-citrate lyase kinase at peptide B, containing both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues (Ramakrishna, S., Pucci, D. L., and Benjamin, W. B. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 4950-4956). In the present study, trypsin-digested, radiolabeled ATP-citrate lyase from rat epididymal fat pads was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Phosphorylation occurred at three amino acid residues within two different peptide sequences; one (peptide a) contained phosphoserine and the other (peptide b) contained phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. The retention times and molecular weights were the same for peptides a and A and peptides b and B. Isoproterenol action increased peptide a phosphorylation and, to a lesser extent, peptide b phosphorylation. Insulin action also increased peptide a phosphorylation, but did not increase peptide b phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1490326695,"The beta-ketoacyl synthetase site of eukaryotic fatty acid synthetases is comprised in part of a pantetheinyl residue on one subunit juxtapositioned with a cysteinyl residue on the adjacent subunit. The present study has confirmed this arrangement and has identified 2 additional residues in the site. The active site residues were identified as summarized below. Sodium borohydride reduction of the keto derivatives of the dibromopropanone cross-linked residues yielded the alcohol derivatives which were amenable to isolation in good yields. The active enzyme yielded primarily a cysteinecysteamine derivative of 2-propanol, demonstrating that a cystyl and the pantetheinyl residues were cross-linked by dibromopropanone. However, in the cold-inactivated enzyme, the primary product of the cross-linking reaction was the dicystyl derivative. In addition, cross-linking between the cystyl and pantetheinyl residues, but not the two cystyl residues, resulted in the cross-linking of the two subunits. Therefore, it is proposed that there are two cystyl residues on one subunit juxtapositioned with the pantetheinyl residue on the adjacent subunit. The cystyl residues are highly reactive toward alkylating agents at pH 6.5, suggesting the presence of a cationic residue interacting with the thiolate anion. This proposal was supported using the bifunctional reagent o-phthalaldehyde which was found to cross-link the epsilon-amino group of lysine with the pantetheinyl-SH or the cystyl-SH in the beta-ketoacyl synthetase site to form a thioisoindole ring. The dialdehyde inhibited the enzyme by inactivating the beta-ketoacyl synthetase activity, and the inhibition could be prevented by malonyl-CoA and to a lesser extent by acetyl-CoA. Blocking the reactive thiol groups with dibromopropanone or 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) reduced the formation of the fluorescent thioisoindole ring. The close arrangement of a cystyl-SH, the pantetheinyl-SH, and the epsilon-amino group of lysine led us to propose that the positive epsilon-amino group may serve as an electron sink in a general acid-catalyzed decarboxylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2059735291,"Phenotypic revertants were isolated from an S49 mouse lymphoma tissue culture cell mutant that lacks cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cA-PK) activity (kin-). The mutant phenotype is trans-dominant and results from a lesion that probably lies outside the cA-PK subunit structural genes. The nature of the event that produces the kin- phenotype is unknown. However, the mechanism that is responsible for its behavior is genetically encoded because: spontaneous revertants arise at low frequency; reversion frequency is increased by mutagen treatment; mutagen-specific classes of revertant phenotypes are induced; and some revertants are temperature-sensitive for expression of cA-PK subunit polypeptides. Additional evidence is provided that argues against structural lesions in cA-PK catalytic (C) subunits as explanatory of the kin- phenotype. Kin- cells do not express an immunologically detectable C polypeptide, whereas C expression is restored in revertant cells. Revertants in which phenotype and cA-PK activity levels are only partially restored to that of wild-type cells contain a commensurately reduced amount of C polypeptide. Finally, the structure of C polypeptide in partial revertants is unaltered from that of wild-type C. The evidence supports the hypothesis that the kin- lesion defines a regulatory gene responsible for setting intracellular levels of cA-PK C subunit expression."

https://openalex.org/W1580691236,"The binding site of the chicken hepatic lectin involved in the clearance of N-acetylglucosamine-terminated serum glycoproteins was explored by a competitive binding assay using 3H-labeled agalacto-orosomucoid and various glycoproteins, polysaccharides, monosaccharides, and glycosides as inhibitors. The binding site is relatively small, involving a terminal nonreducing DGlcNAc structure with an equatorial N-acetamido group on carbon 2 and an equatorial hydroxyl group on carbon 4. Among the mono- and oligosaccharides tested, benzyl alpha DGlcNAc was the best inhibitor, being three times as effective as DGlcNAc; and in general, all alpha-anomeric glycosides were better than beta-glycosides. All oligosaccharides with terminal nonreducing beta DGlcNAc have almost the same inhibitory power, whereas those with nonreducing DGlc or DGal were relatively inactive. Among the serum and blood group glycoproteins, a Smith degraded human H substance with several exposed terminal nonreducing beta DGlcNAc residues was the most active and twice as effective as agalacto-orosomucoid and an A substance, Hog 75 10% precipitate. Almost all hog preparations, some with A or with H activity, were equally effective. A glycopeptide with terminal DGlcNAc was twice as active as one with terminal nonreducing DMan and DGlcNAc residues and almost three times as potent as one with terminal nonreducing DGal; a glycopeptide with terminal sialic acid was inactive. The slopes of the inhibition lines differed, reflecting the heterogeneity of the various determinant groups on the glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1583608223,"We described recently the purification and preliminary characterization of human hepatic betaine: homocysteins S-methyltransferase (Skiba, W. E., Taylor, M. P., Wells, M. S., Mangum, J. H., and Awad, W. M., Jr. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 14944-14948) where it was shown that isovalerate and 3,3-dimethylbutyrate, analogs of dimethylglycine and betaine, respectively, were good inhibitors. The present study demonstrates that butyrate is a modest competitive inhibitor, binding at the betaine site. This led to the consideration and synthesis of a putative dual-substrate analog, S(delta-carboxybutyl)-DL-homocysteine, which bound with high affinity to the active site of the methyltransferase; presumably this effect is due to the L-isomer only. Homologs, S(gamma-carboxypropyl)-DL-homocysteine and S(beta-carboxyethyl)-DL-homocysteine, do not inhibit at concentrations 100-fold higher than where inhibition is noted with the dual-substrate analog, indicating the latter's specificity. These findings support the hypothesis that methyl transfer in this enzyme occurs directly from one substrate to the other."

https://openalex.org/W1576564424,"In crude extracts, the molecular form of adenylosuccinate lyase is pH-dependent as studied by gel filtration and sucrose gradient centrifugation. At pH values of 8.7 and 6.5, the enzyme exhibits molecular forms of 200 kDa and larger than 500 kDa, respectively. At pH values of 7.0-7.5, forms of intermediate molecular weight were detected. Interconversion among the different molecular forms of adenylosuccinate lyase was not achieved when the enzyme was subjected to two successive chromatographic steps on Sepharose CL-6B using elution buffers at two different pH values. A unique form of 200 kDa was observed, regardless of the pH of the buffer used, upon either gel filtration or sucrose gradient centrifugation in the presence of 1 M NaCl. The enzyme from Artemia cysts was purified to homogeneity. It had molecular mass of 200 kDa and gave a single band of 56 kDa upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Km values for adenylosuccinate, AMP, and fumarate were 1, 36, and 350 microM, respectively. The enzyme exhibits a Uni Bi-ordered mechanism and is maximally active at a pH value of 8.0-8.5. For maximum activity, the enzyme requires an ionic strength equivalent to 80 mM KCI. The isoelectric point determined by chromatofocusing was 5.04."
https://openalex.org/W1506628519,"Qualitative and quantitative changes occurring in the myelin marker glycolipids, cerebrosides, sulfatides, and monogalactosyl diglyceride, in the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, and tail) of Xenopus laevis during its metamorphic stages were analyzed by normal and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The concentration of these glycolipids increased rapidly in brain until the tadpole reached the middle of metamorphosis, fluctuated slightly, decreased until metamorphosis was completed, and increased once more as the frog matured. Similar changes were observed in the spinal cord, but the decrease of glycolipids occurred at a later stage of metamorphosis. The glycolipid level in tail nerve reached a peak at the beginning of metamorphosis and then rapidly decreased. The ratios of hydroxycerebroside and hydroxysulfatide to respective nonhydroxylipids in brain, spinal cord, and tail remained constant throughout the metamorphic change but differed in each tissue. The tail contained the highest ratio. The glycolipids in sciatic nerve generated during the metamorphosis had an even higher hydroxyl lipid/nonhydroxy lipid ratio. The cerebrosides contained extremely high concentrations of monounsaturated fatty acids with very long carbon chains (C22-C25) and this homolog composition remained almost unchanged throughout metamorphosis. These results indicate that active degradation of these glycolipids, and probably of myelin, occurs but the glycolipid composition of myelin appears to remain the same throughout the metamorphic process. The significance of these findings is discussed from a morphological standpoint."

One-half mole of the peptide is obtained from 1 mol of the high molecular weight glycoprotein. The dissociation of the peptide is accompanied by the appearance of an intense absorption band which has a maximum at 264 nm. The absorption band is associated exclusively with the 26,000-Da peptide. The amino acid composition of the peptide differs from 19 S thyroglobulin by having no cysteine and higher contents of serine, alanine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, lysine, glycine, isoleucine, and histidine. The peptide also has a high thyroxine content. There were no detectable carbohydrates in the peptide. The fluorescence spectrum of the 26,000-Da peptide shows an emission maximum at 405 nm which we have recently assigned to iodotyrosine-iodotyrosine interactions (Shifrin, S., Consiglio, E., and Kohn, L.
