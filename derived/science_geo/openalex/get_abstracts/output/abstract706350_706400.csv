https://openalex.org/W4312090043,"The development of highly stable and efficient wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on bromine-iodine (Br–I) mixed-halide perovskite (with Br greater than 20%) is critical to create tandem solar cells. However, issues with Br–I phase segregation under solar cell operational conditions (such as light and heat) limit the device voltage and operational stability. This challenge is often exacerbated by the ready defect formation associated with the rapid crystallization of Br-rich perovskite chemistry with antisolvent processes. We combined the rapid Br crystallization with a gentle gas-quench method to prepare highly textured columnar 1.75–electron volt Br–I mixed WBG perovskite films with reduced defect density. With this approach, we obtained 1.75–electron volt WBG PSCs with greater than 20% power conversion efficiency, approximately 1.33-volt open-circuit voltage ( V oc ), and excellent operational stability (less than 5% degradation over 1100 hours of operation under 1.2 sun at 65°C). When further integrated with 1.25–electron volt narrow-bandgap PSC, we obtained a 27.1% efficient, all-perovskite, two-terminal tandem device with a high V oc of 2.2 volts."
https://openalex.org/W4312090027,"Advances in solid-state batteries have primarily been driven by the discovery of superionic conducting structural frameworks that function as solid electrolytes. We demonstrate the ability of high-entropy metal cation mixes to improve ionic conductivity in a compound, which leads to less reliance on specific chemistries and enhanced synthesizability. The local distortions introduced into high-entropy materials give rise to an overlapping distribution of site energies for the alkali ions so that they can percolate with low activation energy. Experiments verify that high entropy leads to orders-of-magnitude higher ionic conductivities in lithium (Li)-sodium (Na) superionic conductor (Li-NASICON), sodium NASICON (Na-NASICON), and Li-garnet structures, even at fixed alkali content. We provide insight into selecting the optimal distortion and designing high-entropy superionic conductors across the vast compositional space."
https://openalex.org/W4312097796,"The capacity of transition metals to bind and transform carbon monoxide (CO) is critical to its use in many chemical processes as a sustainable, inexpensive C1 building block. By contrast, only few s- and p-block element compounds bind and activate CO, and conversion of CO into useful carbonyl-containing organic compounds in such cases remains elusive. We report that metalated phosphorus ylides provide facile access to ketenyl anions ([RC=C=O]-) by phosphine displacement with CO. These anions are very stable and storable reagents with a distinctive electronic structure between that of the prototypical ketene (H2C=C=O) and that of ethynol (HC≡C-OH). Nonetheless, the ketenyl anions selectively react with a range of electrophiles at the carbon atom, thus offering high-yielding and versatile access to ketenes and related compounds."
https://openalex.org/W4312191285,"A major challenge in nanotechnology is the fabrication of complex three-dimensional (3D) structures with desired materials. We present a strategy for fabricating arbitrary 3D nanostructures with a library of materials including metals, metal alloys, 2D materials, oxides, diamond, upconversion materials, semiconductors, polymers, biomaterials, molecular crystals, and inks. Specifically, hydrogels patterned by femtosecond light sheets are used as templates that allow for direct assembly of materials to form designed nanostructures. By fine-tuning the exposure strategy and features of the patterned gel, 2D and 3D structures of 20- to 200-nm resolution are realized. We fabricated nanodevices, including encrypted optical storage and microelectrodes, to demonstrate their designed functionality and precision. These results show that our method provides a systematic solution for nanofabrication across different classes of materials and opens up further possibilities for the design of sophisticated nanodevices."

https://openalex.org/W4312191131,"Developing high-efficiency cooling with safe, low–global warming potential refrigerants is a grand challenge for tackling climate change. Caloric effect–based cooling technologies, such as magneto- or electrocaloric refrigeration, are promising but often require large applied fields for a relatively low coefficient of performance and adiabatic temperature change. We propose using the ionocaloric effect and the accompanying thermodynamic cycle as a caloric-based, all–condensed-phase cooling technology. Theoretical and experimental results show higher adiabatic temperature change and entropy change per unit mass and volume compared with other caloric effects under low applied field strengths. We demonstrated the viability of a practical system using an ionocaloric Stirling refrigeration cycle. Our experimental results show a coefficient of performance of 30% relative to Carnot and a temperature lift as high as 25°C using a voltage strength of ~0.22 volts."
https://openalex.org/W4312115129,"The deep magmatic architecture of the Hawaiian volcanic system is central to understanding the transport of magma from the upper mantle to the individual volcanoes. We leverage advances in earthquake monitoring with deep learning algorithms to image the structures underlying a major mantle earthquake swarm of nearly 200,000 events that rapidly accelerated after the 2018 Kīlauea caldera collapse. At depths of 36 to 43 kilometers, we resolve a 15-kilometers-long collection of near-horizontal sheeted structures that we identify as a sill complex. These sills connect to the lower depths of Kīlauea’s plumbing by a 25-kilometers-long belt of seismicity. Additionally, a column of seismicity links the sill complex to a shallow décollement near Mauna Loa. These findings implicate the mantle sill complex as a nexus for magma transport beneath Hawai‘i and furthermore indicate widespread magmatic connectivity in the volcanic system."
https://openalex.org/W4312190896,"The primary motor cortex (M1) is involved in the control of voluntary movements and is extensively mapped in this capacity. Although the M1 is implicated in modulation of pain, the underlying circuitry and causal underpinnings remain elusive. We unexpectedly unraveled a connection from the M1 to the nucleus accumbens reward circuitry through a M1 layer 6-mediodorsal thalamus pathway, which specifically suppresses negative emotional valence and associated coping behaviors in neuropathic pain. By contrast, layer 5 M1 neurons connect with specific cell populations in zona incerta and periaqueductal gray to suppress sensory hypersensitivity without altering pain affect. Thus, the M1 employs distinct, layer-specific pathways to attune sensory and aversive-emotional components of neuropathic pain, which can be exploited for purposes of pain relief."
https://openalex.org/W4312190854,"Transparency in animals is a complex form of camouflage involving mechanisms that reduce light scattering and absorption throughout the organism. In vertebrates, attaining transparency is difficult because their circulatory system is full of red blood cells (RBCs) that strongly attenuate light. Here, we document how glassfrogs overcome this challenge by concealing these cells from view. Using photoacoustic imaging to track RBCs in vivo, we show that resting glassfrogs increase transparency two- to threefold by removing ~89% of their RBCs from circulation and packing them within their liver. Vertebrate transparency thus requires both see-through tissues and active mechanisms that “clear” respiratory pigments from these tissues. Furthermore, glassfrogs’ ability to regulate the location, density, and packing of RBCs without clotting offers insight in metabolic, hemodynamic, and blood-clot research."
https://openalex.org/W4312097927,"Delirium is recognized as a severe complication of coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19-associated delirium has been linked to worse patient outcomes and is considered to be of multifactorial origin. Here we sought to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of delirium in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, along with its impact on clinical outcome.Consecutive adult COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary academic referral hospital between March 1st and December 31st, 2020 were included. Potential risk factors for delirium were evaluated, including: age, gender, disease severity (as per the highest WHO grading reached during admission), laboratory parameters for infection and renal function (as per their most extreme values), and presence of comorbidities. To assess the relative strength of risk factors for predicting the occurrence of delirium, we performed a random-forest survival analysis.347 patients with positive COVID-19 PCR test and median age 68.2 [IQR 55.5, 80.5] years were included. Of those, 79 patients (22.8%) developed delirium, 81 (23.3%) were transferred to ICU, 58 (16.7%) died. 163 (73.8%) patients were discharged home, 13 (5.9%) to another hospital, 32 (14.5%) to nursing homes, 13 (5.9%) to rehabilitation with an overall median admission-to-discharge time of 53 [IQR 14, 195] days. The strongest predictors for the occurrence of delirium were blood urea nitrogen (minimal depth value (MD): 3.33), age (MD: 3.75), disease severity (as captured by WHO grading; MD: 3.93), leukocyte count (MD: 4.22), the presence of a neurodegenerative history (MD: 4.43), ferritin (MD: 4.46) and creatinine (MD: 4.59) levels.The risk of delirium in COVID-19 can be stratified based on COVID-19 disease severity and-similar to delirium associated with other respiratory infections-the factors advanced age, neurodegenerative disease history, and presence of elevated infection and renal-retention parameters. Screening for these risk factors may facilitate early identification of patients at high-risk for COVID-19-associated delirium."
https://openalex.org/W4312097911,"Canine splenic hemangiosarcoma (HSA) is an aggressive tumor with a short overall survival time (OST) despite treatment with splenectomy and adjuvant doxorubicin. Modulation of the immune system has been shown to be effective for a variety of human tumors, and may be effective for canine tumors, including HSA. Immunocidin® is a non-specific immunotherapy based on a mycobacterial cell wall fraction. Preliminary work suggests Immunocidin® is safe to give intravenously (IV) in tumor-bearing dogs. This work aimed to evaluate the safety of doxorubicin and Immunocidin® combination in dogs with naturally occurring splenic HSA. A secondary aim of this study was to collect preliminary efficacy data to support a subsequent comprehensive, prospective clinical trial in canine patients with HSA, if the combination of doxorubicin and Immunocidin® was found to be safe. Eighteen dogs with stage II-III splenic HSA were recruited to receive 5 doses of sequential IV doxorubicin and Immunocidin® at two-week intervals following splenectomy. Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group v1.1 (VCOG) scheme. Overall survival time was calculated from the date of splenectomy to date of death or loss to follow-up. AEs during administration were infrequent, the most common being hypertension. One patient developed limb and facial twitching and was removed from the study. After infusion, common AEs included lethargy, hyporexia, and diarrhea. One patient developed VCOG grade 5 diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Modifications in the treatment regimen were made to prevent these signs in subsequent patients. The median OST in dogs treated with the combination therapy was estimated at 147 days (range: 39–668 days). Although generally safe, the combination of doxorubicin and Immunocidin® appeared to cause more gastrointestinal effects than doxorubicin alone, and no apparent improvement in OST was noted in this population of dogs."
https://openalex.org/W4312097943,"In community-based research projects, needs assessments are one of the first steps to identify community priorities. Access-related issues often pose significant barriers to participation in research and evaluation for rural and remote communities, particularly Indigenous communities, which also have a complex relationship with academia due to a history of exploitation. To bridge this gap, work with Indigenous communities requires consistent and meaningful engagement. The prominence of digital devices (i.e., smartphones) offers an unparalleled opportunity for ethical and equitable engagement between researchers and communities across jurisdictions, particularly in remote communities.This paper presents a framework to guide needs assessments which embed digital platforms in partnership with Indigenous communities. Guided by this framework, a qualitative needs assessment was conducted with a subarctic Métis community in Saskatchewan, Canada. This project is governed by an Advisory Council comprised of Knowledge Keepers, Elders, and youth in the community. An environmental scan of relevant programs, three key informant interviews, and two focus groups (n = 4 in each) were conducted to systematically identify community priorities.Through discussions with the community, four priorities were identified: (1) the Coronavirus pandemic, (2) climate change impacts on the environment, (3) mental health and wellbeing, and (4) food security and sovereignty. Given the timing of the needs assessment, the community identified the Coronavirus pandemic as a key priority requiring digital initiatives.Recommendations for community-based needs assessments to conceptualize and implement digital infrastructure are put forward, with an emphasis on self-governance and data sovereignty."

https://openalex.org/W4312090183,"Background Evidence has suggested that maternal use of skilled birth attendant is the most important factor to reduce maternal mortality because of more than three-fourths of maternal deaths occur during child delivery or within 24 hours after delivery due to hemorrhage, hypertension, ruptured uterus and sepsis. In Ethiopia, more than 42% of pregnant women with 4+ antenatal care (ANC) visit did not deliver by skilled birth attendant. The factors for women not using skilled birth attendant after any ANC visit is not well-studied yet. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess effect of quality antenatal care service on maternal use of skilled birth attendant after any antenatal care visit. Methods This study was initiated using performance monitoring for action Ethiopia longitudinal panel survey datasets. A total of 1,511 postnatal women were included in the analysis. Generalized estimating equation Poisson regression model was used to assess the effect of quality ANC service on maternal use of skilled birth attendant by accounting the clustering nature of the data using Stata vers.16 software. Results This study showed that about 54% of women used skilled birth attendant during the current baby delivery (rate = 53.6%, 95% UI = 51–56%). Nearly, 39% of the women received quality (more than 75 th percentile) ANC service (rate = 39.05%, 95% UI = 36–42%). The highest and the lowest antenatal care service the women received, respectively, were blood pressure measure (91.9%) and syphilis test (12.4%). Women who received better quality ANC service were 20% higher more likely to use skilled birth attendant compared to women who received low quality ANC service (adjusted IRR = 1.20, 95% UI = 1.11, 1.31). Conclusion Maternal use of skilled birth attendant can be improved by providing quality ANC service during subsequent ANC visits. Improving ANC service delivery may encourage or positively reinforce women’s and partner’s decision to use skilled birth attendant."
https://openalex.org/W4312097794,"Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are atom-scale defects with long spin coherence times that can be used to sense magnetic fields with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. Typically, the magnetic field projection at a single point is measured by averaging many sequential measurements with a single NV center, or the magnetic field distribution is reconstructed by taking a spatial average over an ensemble of many NV centers. In averaging over many single-NV center experiments, both techniques discard information. Here we propose and implement a new sensing modality, whereby two or more NV centers are measured simultaneously, and we extract temporal and spatial correlations in their signals that would otherwise be inaccessible. We analytically derive the measurable two-point correlator in the presence of environmental noise, quantum projection noise, and readout noise. We show that optimizing the readout noise is critical for measuring correlations, and we experimentally demonstrate measurements of correlated applied noise using spin-to-charge readout of two NV centers. We also implement a spectral reconstruction protocol for disentangling local and nonlocal noise sources, and demonstrate that independent control of two NV centers can be used to measure the temporal structure of correlations. Our covariance magnetometry scheme has numerous applications in studying spatiotemporal structure factors and dynamics, and opens a new frontier in nanoscale sensing."
https://openalex.org/W4312098012,"Background Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a still highly relevant problem and is known to be a distressing side effect in patients. The aim of this study was to develop a machine learning model to predict PONV up to 24 h with fentanyl-based intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA). Methods From July 2019 and July 2020, data from 2,149 patients who received fentanyl-based IV-PCA for analgesia after non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia were applied to develop predictive models. The rates of PONV at 1 day after surgery were measured according to patient characteristics as well as anesthetic, surgical, or PCA-related factors. All statistical analyses and computations were performed using the R software. Results A total of 2,149 patients were enrolled in this study, 337 of whom (15.7%) experienced PONV. After applying the machine-learning algorithm and Apfel model to the test dataset to predict PONV, we found that the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve using logistic regression was 0.576 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.520–0.633), k-nearest neighbor was 0.597 (95% CI, 0.537–0.656), decision tree was 0.561 (95% CI, 0.498–0.625), random forest was 0.610 (95% CI, 0.552–0.668), gradient boosting machine was 0.580 (95% CI, 0.520–0.639), support vector machine was 0.649 (95% CI, 0.592–0.707), artificial neural network was 0.686 (95% CI, 0.630–0.742), and Apfel model was 0.643 (95% CI, 0.596–0.690). Conclusions We developed and validated machine learning models for predicting PONV in the first 24 h. The machine learning model showed better performance than the Apfel model in predicting PONV."
https://openalex.org/W4312098019,"The increasing prevalence of mental health difficulties amongst adolescents is a worldwide concern. Poor mental health in adolescence is associated with a range of mental, physical and social problems in later life. In sub-Saharan Africa, limited data suggests that mental disorders amongst adolescents are common. It is important that interventions to address this are rooted in an understanding of the unique local context and culture. Yet, the current use, development, and effectiveness of adolescent mental health interventions in sub-Saharan Africa is unclear. In response, this paper presents a protocol for two scoping reviews that together will examine the available evidence on promotive, preventive, and treatment interventions for adolescent mental health in sub-Saharan Africa.The scoping reviews will follow the five-step methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley, with further recommendations from the Joanna Briggs Institute. They will review scientific and grey literature published between 2000 and 2021, without restrictions in language or study type. A wide range of sources, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, Global Health, PsychINFO, Cochrane and Google Scholar will be searched. Eligibility screening and data extraction will be done by two independent reviewers, and disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. Data will be summarised in two phases. A narrative synthesis will provide a descriptive profile of all studies included and will explore key concepts related to intervention types, target populations and adaptations to local context. A systematic review element will collate evidence of intervention effectiveness from (cluster) Randomised Controlled Trials.To the best of our knowledge, these scoping reviews are the first to synthesise a wide range of available evidence on promotive, preventive and treatment interventions for adolescent mental health in sub-Saharan Africa. The results will be published in peer-reviewed publications and will be presented as an evidence base for future intervention development and implementation."
https://openalex.org/W4312204037,"How the vascular and neural compartment cooperate to achieve such a complex and highly specialized structure as the central nervous system is still unclear. Here, we reveal a crosstalk between motor neurons (MNs) and endothelial cells (ECs), necessary for the coordinated development of MNs. By analyzing cell-to-cell interaction profiles of the mouse developing spinal cord, we uncovered semaphorin 3C (Sema3C) and PlexinD1 as a communication axis between MNs and ECs. Using cell-specific knockout mice and in vitro assays, we demonstrate that removal of Sema3C in MNs, or its receptor PlexinD1 in ECs, results in premature and aberrant vascularization of MN columns. Those vascular defects impair MN axon exit from the spinal cord. Impaired PlexinD1 signaling in ECs also causes MN maturation defects at later stages. This study highlights the importance of a timely and spatially controlled communication between MNs and ECs for proper spinal cord development."
https://openalex.org/W4312052520,"The reticular network of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is formed by connecting ER tubules through three-way junctions and undergoes constant remodeling through formation and loss of the three-way junctions. Transmembrane and coiled-coil domain family 3 (TMCC3), an ER membrane protein localizing at three-way junctions, has been shown to positively regulate formation of the reticular ER network. However, elements that negatively regulate TMCC3 localization have not been characterized. In this study, we report that 14-3-3γ, a phospho-serine/phospho-threonine-binding protein involved in various signal transduction pathways, is a negative regulator of TMCC3. We demonstrate that overexpression of 14-3-3γ reduced localization of TMCC3 to three-way junctions and decreased the number of three-way junctions. TMCC3 bound to 14-3-3γ through the N terminus and had deduced 14-3-3 binding motifs. Additionally, we determined that a TMCC3 mutant substituting alanine for serine to be phosphorylated in the binding motif reduced binding to 14-3-3γ. The TMCC3 mutant was more prone than wildtype TMCC3 to localize at three-way junctions in the cells overexpressing 14-3-3γ. Furthermore, the TMCC3 mutant rescued the ER sheet expansion caused by TMCC3 knockdown less than wild-type TMCC3. Taken together, these results indicate that 14-3-3γ binding negatively regulates localization of TMCC3 to the three-way junctions for the proper reticular ER network, implying that the negative regulation of TMCC3 by 14-3-3γ would underlie remodeling of the reticular network of the ER.

Mammalian cells have been shown to employ some additional ER membrane proteins in order to shape the ER membrane. In addition to reticulons and REEPs/DP1/Yop1, mammalian cells employ Arl6IP1 for formation of the ER tubules and the ER sheets (32Yamamoto Y. Yoshida A. Miyazaki N. Iwasaki K. Sakisaka T. Arl6IP1 has the ability to shape the mammalian ER membrane in a reticulon-like fashion.Biochem. J. 2014; 458: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that Arl6IP1 is the ER membrane protein that has the wedge-like transmembrane domains homologous to reticulons and generates and stabilizes the ER tubules and the edges of the ER sheets in the same manner as reticulons (32Yamamoto Y. Yoshida A. Miyazaki N. Iwasaki K. Sakisaka T. Arl6IP1 has the ability to shape the mammalian ER membrane in a reticulon-like fashion.Biochem.

Lee S. Blackstone C. Protrudin binds atlastins and endoplasmic reticulum-shaping proteins and regulates network formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Arl6IP1 and protrudin are also known as SPG (spastic paraplegias) 61 and SPG33, respectively, because hereditary spastic paraplegias, a group of inherited neurological disorders whose pathology is characterized by axonal degeneration of corticospinal motor neurons, is caused by pathogenic mutations in Arl6IP1 and Protrudin genes (35Mannan A.U.

TMEM170A also regulates formation of the reticular ER network by binding to reticulons (39Christodoulou A. Santarella-Mellwig R. Santama N. Mattaj I.W. Transmembrane protein TMEM170A is a newly discovered regulator of ER and nuclear envelope morphogenesis in human cells.J. Cell Sci. 2016; 129: 1552-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that TMCC3 (transmembrane and coiled-coil domain family 3) is involved in shaping the ER membrane in mammalian cells (40Wisesa S. Yamamoto Y. Sakisaka T. TMCC3 localizes at the three-way junctions for the proper tubular network of the endoplasmic reticulum.Biochem. J. 2019; 476: 3241-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). TMCC3 is a higher eukaryote-specific ER membrane protein composed of the large N-terminal cytoplasmic region containing two coiled-coil domains and the short C-terminal region containing two transmembrane domains (40Wisesa S. Yamamoto Y. Sakisaka T. TMCC3 localizes at the three-way junctions for the proper tubular network of the endoplasmic reticulum.Biochem. J. 2019; 476: 3241-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). TMCC3 specifically localizes to three-way junctions and binds to atlastins through the C-terminal transmembrane domains, regulating formation of the reticular ER network (40Wisesa S. Yamamoto Y. Sakisaka T. TMCC3 localizes at the three-way junctions for the proper tubular network of the endoplasmic reticulum.Biochem. J. 2019; 476: 3241-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). TMCC3 has been shown to be associated with formation of the membrane contact sites between ER and endosomes (41Hoyer M.J. Chitwood P.J. Ebmeier C.C. Striepen J.F. Qi R.Z. Old W.M. et al.A novel class of ER membrane proteins regulates ER-associated endosome fission.Cell. 2018; 175: 254-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells (42Wang Y.H.

These evidences underscore the biological importance of the mammalian-specific mechanisms to shape the ER membrane. The reticular network of the ER tubules is not static but undergoes constant remodeling through regulation of the three-way junctions. While new three-way junctions are frequently generated, a subpopulation of the existing three-way junctions slides along the intersecting ER tubules, leading to loss of the ER polygons (ring closure) (28Chen S. Desai T. McNew J.A. Gerard P. Novick P.J. Ferro-Novick S. Lunapark stabilizes nascent three-way junctions in the endoplasmic reticulum.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Prinz W.A. Voeltz G.K. Form follows function: © importance of endoplasmic reticulum shape.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2015; 84: 791-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Lunapark has been shown to regulate sliding of the existing three-way junctions and loss of the ER polygons (28Chen S. Desai T. McNew J.A. Gerard P. Novick P.J. Ferro-Novick S. Lunapark stabilizes nascent three-way junctions in the endoplasmic reticulum.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 29Shemesh T. Klemm R.W.

A. 2014; 111: E5243-E5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the molecular mechanism of how three-way junction formation is regulated for the constant remodeling still remains unclear. One potential regulator for this would be TMCC3, because we have recently demonstrated that TMCC3 is upstream of atlastins (40Wisesa S. Yamamoto Y. Sakisaka T. TMCC3 localizes at the three-way junctions for the proper tubular network of the endoplasmic reticulum.Biochem. J. 2019; 476: 3241-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). While TMCC3 knockdown decreases the number of three-way junctions and expands the ER sheets, overexpression of altastin-2, but not overexpression of lunapark, rescues the phenotypes of the TMCC3-knockdown cells (40Wisesa S. Yamamoto Y. Sakisaka T. TMCC3 localizes at the three-way junctions for the proper tubular network of the endoplasmic reticulum.Biochem. J. 2019; 476: 3241-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), indicating that TMCC3 regulates formation of the three-way junctions by enhancing the atlastin activity. Given that TMCC3 localizes to three-way junctions independently of binding to atlastins (40Wisesa S. Yamamoto Y. Sakisaka T. TMCC3 localizes at the three-way junctions for the proper tubular network of the endoplasmic reticulum.Biochem. J. 2019; 476: 3241-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), molecular mechanisms that regulates localization of TMCC3 to three-way junctions would play important roles in formation of the three-way junction during the constant remodeling. We have shown that the first coiled-coil domain of TMCC3 positively regulates localization of TMCC3 to the three-way junctions (40Wisesa S. Yamamoto Y. Sakisaka T. TMCC3 localizes at the three-way junctions for the proper tubular network of the endoplasmic reticulum.Biochem. J. 2019; 476: 3241-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, it still remains unknown how localization of TMCC3 to the three-way junctions is negatively regulated. An earlier study has identified 14-3-3 proteins as proteins that bind to TMCC3 (46Sohn W.J. Kim J.Y. Kim D. Park J.A. Lee Y. Kwon H.J. Expression and characterization of transmembrane and coiled-coil domain family 3.BMB Rep. 2016; 49: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W4312053816,"Photosystem II (PSII) is the water-splitting enzyme central to oxygenic photosynthesis. To drive water oxidation, light is harvested by accessory pigments, mostly chlorophyll (Chl) a molecules, which absorb visible light (400–700 nm). Some cyanobacteria facultatively acclimate to shaded environments by altering their photosynthetic machinery to additionally absorb far-red light (FRL, 700–800 nm), a process termed far-red light photoacclimation or FaRLiP. During far-red light photoacclimation, FRL-PSII is assembled with FRL-specific isoforms of the subunits PsbA, PsbB, PsbC, PsbD, and PsbH, and some Chl-binding sites contain Chls d or f instead of the usual Chl a. The structure of an apo-FRL-PSII monomer lacking the FRL-specific PsbH subunit has previously been determined, but visualization of the dimeric complex has remained elusive. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of a dimeric FRL–PSII complex. The site assignments for Chls d and f are consistent with those assigned in the previous apo-FRL-PSII monomeric structure. All sites that bind Chl d or Chl f at high occupancy exhibit a FRL-specific interaction of the formyl moiety of the Chl d or Chl f with the protein environment, which in some cases involves a phenylalanine sidechain. The structure retains the FRL-specific PsbH2 subunit, which appears to alter the energetic landscape of FRL-PSII, redirecting energy transfer from the phycobiliprotein complex to a Chl f molecule bound by PsbB2 that acts as a bridge for energy transfer to the electron transfer chain. Collectively, these observations extend our previous understanding of the structure-function relationship that allows PSII to function using lower energy FRL.

Photosystem II (PSII) in oxygenic phototrophs is the multisubunit membrane protein complex that couples light absorption with water oxidation to generate reducing equivalents for carbon fixation (1Blankenship R.E. Molecular Mechanisms of Photosynthesis.3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd, Southern Gate2021Google Scholar, 2Vinyard D.J. Ananyev G.M. Charles Dismukes G. Photosystem II: the reaction center of oxygenic photosynthesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82: 577-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). A complete PSII holocomplex is typically found in a dimeric configuration, each monomer comprising about 20 subunits that bind many cofactors (3Shen J.-R. The structure of photosystem II and the mechanism of water oxidation in photosynthesis.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2015; 66: 23-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll (Chl) molecules account for 35 of these cofactors, most of which serve primarily to harvest light. Upon light absorption, energy is transferred through Chl molecules until its arrival at a series of cofactors that comprise the electron transfer chain. Charge separation occurs when an electron is transferred to a plastoquinone on the acceptor side of the complex. The hole left on the donor side triggers the catalytic advancement of a Mn4CaO5-6 metallocofactor called the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) that extracts electrons from water (4Lubitz W. Chrysina M.

Many characteristics and properties of PSII are highly conserved and nearly invariant among all oxygen-evolving phototrophs, but like all bioenergetic systems, some differences have evolved among species, typically due to environmental pressures within specific ecological niches (6Sheridan K.J.

Whereas most oxygenic phototrophs use primarily visible light (VL, 400–700 nm) to drive PSII function, some cyanobacteria have evolved to additionally use lower energy, far-red light (FRL, 700–800 nm) for this purpose (7Viola S. Roseby W. Santabarabara S. Nürnberg D. Assunção R.

The best characterized of these strategies is a facultative response mechanism to shaded environments called far-red light-photoacclimation or FaRLiP (8Gan F. Zhang S. Rockwell N.C. Martin S.S.

Cyanobacteria capable of FaRLiP contain a unique gene cluster, most of which encodes proteins involved in Chl f biosynthesis and FRL-specific paralogs of photosystem subunits. Upon expression of the FaRLiP gene cluster, five subunits of PSII become FRL-specific: the subunits PsbA (i.e., D1), PsbB (i.e., CP47), PsbC (i.e., CP43), PsbD (i.e., D2), and also PsbH, a PSII subunit with a single transmembrane α-helix (FRL-specific isoforms of these subunits are called PsbA3, PsbB2, PsbC2, PsbD3, and PsbH2, respectively) (8Gan F.

Additionally, whereas all 35 Chls bound by PSII (per monomer) are Chl a when cells are grown in VL, the FRL-specific PSII complex (FRL-PSII) binds a mixture of different Chl types in those same positions: about 30 Chl a, 4 Chl f, and 1 Chl d (8Gan F.

To identify directly the sites to which Chls d and f bind, the structure of a monomeric apo-FRL-PSII complex isolated from a marine, mesophilic cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7335 (hereafter Synechococcus 7335), was solved at a global resolution of 2.25 Å using single-particle cryo-EM (18Gisriel C.J. Shen G. Ho M.-Y. Kurashov V. Flesher D.A.

Chem. 2022; 298101424Google Scholar). Compared to a monomer of a typical PSII holocomplex found in a dimeric configuration, the monomeric apo-FRL-PSII complex lacked various transmembrane subunits, the extrinsic subunits (i.e., PsbO, PsbQ, PsbU, and PsbV), and the OEC; however, it contained all four Chl-binding subunits which allowed for the identification of 33 of the 35 Chl sites. By comparing sequences to determine FRL-specific residues, identifying common Chl d/f chemical environments and employing quantitative map assessments, four Chl f molecules and one Chl d molecule were assigned, which was consistent with the content of those pigments determined by cofactor analysis (18Gisriel C.J.

The assignments were subsequently corroborated by a larger phylogenetic comparison of FRL-PSII sequences, which also provided insight into their evolution (17Gisriel C.J. Cardona T. Bryant D.A.

A disadvantage of the apo-FRL-PSII structure was that it lacked PsbH2, the FRL-specific isoform of PsbH. Because all other PSII and photosystem I (PSI) subunits encoded by the FaRLiP gene cluster have associated molecular structures (18Gisriel C.J. Shen G. Ho M.-Y. Kurashov V. Flesher D.A.

Chem. 2022; 298101408Google Scholar), PsbH2 is therefore the last FaRLiP-specific protein to have its structure determined. To gain insight into the molecular structure of the FRL-PSII holocomplex, we have altered the purification procedure of FRL-PSII from Synechococcus 7335 allowing us to isolate a dimeric complex that maintains the PsbH2 subunit, and we solved its cryo-EM structure to a global resolution of 2.6 Å. Whereas PsbH found in VL-absorbing PSII is involved in tuning the energy of the lowest energy Chl a molecule found in PSII, PsbH2 lacks this interaction. This suggests that during FaRLiP, the energetic landscape of the antenna Chls is altered to favor energy transfer to Chl f. Because identifying Chls d and f in cryo-EM maps is challenging (24Gisriel C.J. Wang J. Brudvig G.W. Bryant D.A. Opportunities and challenges for assigning cofactors in cryo-EM density maps of chlorophyll-containing proteins.Commun. Biol. 2020; 3: 408Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the new cryo-EM map allows for a reassessment of the Chl type assignments. We performed the strategies previously utilized for this purpose, and observe that two sites in FRL-PSII exhibit CH-O interactions with the formyl moiety of Chl f. Because all Chl d and Chl f molecules exhibit FRL-specific interactions between their formyl moiety and the protein environment, we additionally developed a Python-based tool that can be used to search any set of Chl-containing atomic coordinates for potential H-bond donors to similar formyl moieties. The H-bond search tool is useful for making an initial assessment of structures that bind formylated Chl molecules among the “bulk” Chl a. The structural observations are interpreted in the context of other FaRLiP investigations that enhance our understanding of this widespread photobiological acclimation mechanism. FRL-PSII was isolated by immobilized metal affinity chromatography from Synechococcus 7335-psbC2-[His]10 cells as described in the Experimental procedures. The room temperature absorbance spectrum shows a FRL absorbance peak maximal at 724 nm, and the 77 K fluorescence emission spectrum (excitation wavelength, 440 nm) shows maximal emission at 739 nm, both characteristic of FRL-PSII complexes characterized previously (Fig. S1) (8Gan F.

SDS-PAGE showed bands typical for PSII complexes including core subunits, extrinsic subunits, small peripheral transmembrane subunits, and assembly factors (Fig. S2). Mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides was performed which identified various PSII subunits (Table S1). It showed that the FRL-specific subunits PsbA3, PsbB2, PsbC2, PsbD3, and PsbH2 were far more abundant than were their VL-subunit isoforms. It also showed that the PsbO1, PsbV1, and PsbF2 isoforms were more abundant than PsbO2, PsbV2, and PsbF1, respectively, none of which are encoded in a FaRLiP gene cluster. To make an initial assessment of the oligomeric state, the FRL-PSII complexes were negatively stained with uranyl acetate and imaged by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. S3). The images showed relatively monodisperse single particles whose size was similar to those in a sample of dimeric PSII from the mesophilic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis 6803), suggesting that the FRL-PSII sample had maintained a dimeric configuration. Finally, pigment analysis was performed by solvent extraction and subsequent HPLC (Fig. S4). The results were consistent with previously published pigment analyses (8Gan F. Zhang S. Rockwell N.C.

The FRL-PSII sample was plunge-frozen in dim green light and imaged for single-particle cryo-EM as described in Experimental procedures (Fig. S5). Micrographs showed monodisperse single particles that after processing yielded a 3D-reconstruction with a global resolution of 2.6 Å with local resolutions spanning the range 2.4 to 4.0 Å (Fig. S6). The map exhibited an obvious dimeric configuration and was therefore processed using C2 symmetry. In each monomer of the FRL-PSII dimer, the following subunits were identified and modeled: PsbA3, PsbB2, PsbC2, PsbD3, PsbE, PsbF2, PsbH2, PsbI, PsbK, PsbL, PsbM, PsbO1, PsbT, PsbU, PsbV1, and PsbX (Fig. S7). These subunits were modeled to coordinate 35 Chl molecules, eight carotenoids, 11 diacyl lipids, two pheophytin a molecules, two plastoquinones, two Cl anions, one heme b, one heme c, one non-heme Fe cation, one bicarbonate anion, one OEC, one n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside (β-DM) molecule, and 296 water molecules. The overall structure and three representative map regions are shown in Figure 1. The cryo-EM data and modeling statistics are reported in Table S2. Relative to previously determined structures of dimeric cyanobacterial PSII holocomplexes (25Umena Y. Kawakami K. Shen J.-R. Kamiya N.

The extrinsic subunits PsbO1, PsbU, and PsbV1, and the OEC exhibit heterogeneity in their occupancy and positions (Text S1, Figs. S8, S9 and Table S3); therefore, their atomic coordinates should be considered unreliable. In the 2.25-Å global resolution structure of apo-FRL-PSII, one site that binds a Chl d molecule at high occupancy was assigned in the ChlD1 position of the electron transfer chain (18Gisriel C.J. Shen G. Ho M.-Y. Kurashov V. Flesher D.A.

Chem. 2022; 298101424Google Scholar). This is also observed in the dimeric FRL-PSII structure, in which the formyl moiety of Chl d accepts an H-bond from the hydroxyl moiety of the sidechain from PsbA3-Thr155 (Fig. 1C), which is in turn H-bonded to PsbA3-Tyr120. Importantly, both PsbA3-Thr155 and Tyr120 are FRL-specific and are conserved in the PsbA3 sequences from all cyanobacterial species for which data are available (17Gisriel C.J. Cardona T. Bryant D.A. Brudvig G.W. Molecular evolution of far-red light-acclimated photosystem II.Microorganisms. 2022; 10: 1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The presence of Chl d in the ChlD1 site, and additionally the FRL-specific H-bond to PD2 (18Gisriel C.J. Shen G. Ho M.-Y. Kurashov V. Flesher D.A. Wang J. et al.Structure of a monomeric photosystem II core complex from a cyanobacterium acclimated to far-red light reveals the functions of chlorophylls d and f.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298101424Google Scholar) which is also conserved in the dimeric FRL-PSII structure (Fig. 1B), seem likely to be essential for tuning the redox potentials of the electron transfer chain cofactors so that FRL can drive water oxidation. Four sites that bind Chl f molecules at high occupancy were assigned in the apo-FRL-PSII structure: three in the PsbB2 subunit in sites 605, 608, and 614 and one in the PsbC2 subunit in site 507. To identify possible Chl f molecules in the dimeric FRL-PSII map, we performed cone scans as described previously (22Gisriel C.J. Huang H.-L. Reiss K.M. Flesher D.A. Batista V.S. Bryant D.A. et al.Quantitative assessment of chlorophyll types in cryo-EM maps of photosystem I acclimated to far-red light.BBA Adv. 2021; 1100019Google Scholar) (Fig. S10). In brief, the cryo-EM map around each Chl is scanned at the C7 substituent (always a methyl moiety) and the C2 substituent (a formyl moiety in Chl f or a methyl moiety in Chl a) at a defined bond geometry and distance (Fig. S11). The C7 cone scan data are used to generate a 3σ null distribution representative of a methyl moiety. When the C2 cone scan data exceed this null distribution, it suggests the presence of a formyl moiety (rather than methyl) and that the site may thus be occupied by Chl f. In PsbB2, all three previously assigned sites, 605, 608, and 614, had C2 cone scan signals greater than the null distribution, and all exhibit FRL-specific interactions that confer Chl f–binding specificity (Fig. 2). Near the C2 position of Chl 605, the sidechain of PsbB2-Phe33 is found which in PsbB1 (VL-PSII) is instead a Trp residue. It was previously proposed that the smaller Phe33 allows additional space for the presence of a formyl moiety of the Chl f at site 605 (18Gisriel C.J. Shen G. Ho M.-Y. Kurashov V. Flesher D.A. Wang J. et al.Structure of a monomeric photosystem II core complex from a cyanobacterium acclimated to far-red light reveals the functions of chlorophylls d and f.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298101424Google Scholar). The dimeric FRL-PSII structure is consistent with this hypothesis, but we additionally note that the oxygen atom of the formyl moiety is nearly in-plane and within H-bonding distance of the PsbB2-Phe33 aromatic ring. We propose that Chl f–binding affinity is conferred by the protein for site 605 by a CH-O interaction via the Phe sidechain. Interestingly, another CH-O interaction may also confer some binding affinity for Chl f. In the cone scan analysis of site 614, the profile shows two peaks, only one of which is greater than the methyl distribution. This direction corresponds to a formyl moiety positioned to accept an H-bond from the indole nitrogen atom of the FRL-specific residue PsbB2-Trp462. However, the second peak in the cone scan corresponds to a position toward another Phe sidechain, PsbB2-Phe245, which is also FRL-specific. Modeling the formyl moiety in this direction places its oxygen atom in plane and within H-bonding distance of the aromatic ring, consistent with a CH-O interaction. We hypothesize that the formyl moiety of Chl f 614 occupies two configurations: a primary one directed toward PsbB2-Trp462 and a secondary one that is lower occupancy directed toward PsbB2-Phe245 (Fig. 2A). Thus, it may be that two CH-O interactions participate in Chl f-binding in FRL-PSII, in sites 605 and 614. Another interesting observation is that in structures of FRL-PSI, there was only one Chl f molecule that did not exhibit an obvious H-bond, that in site B38 (22Gisriel C.J. Huang H.-L. Reiss K.M.

Chem. 2022; 298101408Google Scholar). This site was suggested to form a Chl f dimer that had been observed spectroscopically with the Chl in site B37 (27Tros M. Mascoli V. Shen G. Ho M.-Y. Bersanini L. Gisriel C.J. et al.Breaking the red limit: efficient trapping of long-wavelength excitations in chlorophyll-f-containing photosystem I.Chem. 2020; 7: 155-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Near the C2 position of B38, a Trp found in VL sequences is instead a Phe found in FRL sequences (Fig. S12). Rather than a CH-O interaction, the orientation of the Phe sidechain is more consistent with a CHO–π interaction between the formyl oxygen atom of the Chl f and the conjugated system of the Phe sidechain. Thus, it appears that Phe sidechains may commonly participate in conferring Chl f–binding specificity. Consistent with previous observations, both Chls PsbB2 608 and PsbC2 507 also exhibit FRL-specific H-bonding interactions near their C2 positions (17Gisriel C.J. Cardona T. Bryant D.A. Brudvig G.W.

https://openalex.org/W4312090085,"The estimation of concrete characteristics through artificial intelligence techniques is come out to be an effective way in the construction sector in terms of time and cost conservation. The manufacturing of Ultra-High-Performance Concrete (UHPC) is based on combining numerous ingredients, resulting in a very complex composite in fresh and hardened form. The more ingredients, along with more possible combinations, properties and relative mix proportioning, results in difficult prediction of UHPC behavior. The main aim of this research is the development of Machine Learning (ML) models to predict UHPC flowability and compressive strength. Accordingly, sophisticated and effective artificial intelligence approaches are employed in the current study. For this purpose, an individual ML model named Decision Tree (DT) and ensembled ML algorithms called Bootstrap Aggregating (BA) and Gradient Boosting (GB) are applied. Statistical analyses like; Determination Coefficient (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are also employed to evaluate algorithms' performance. It is concluded that the GB approach appropriately forecasts the UHPC flowability and compressive strength. The higher R2 value, i.e., 0.94 and 0.95 for compressive and flowability, respectively, of the DT technique and lesser error values, have higher precision than other considered algorithms with lower R2 values. SHAP analysis reveals that limestone powder content and curing time have the highest SHAP values for UHPC flowability and compressive strength, respectively. The outcomes of this research study would benefit the scholars of the construction industry to quickly and effectively determine the flowability and compressive strength of UHPC."

Second, we use machine learning prediction models on these multimorbid patients characteristics to predict rehospitalization within 30 and 365 days and their length of stay.This study was conducted on 8 882 anonymized patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Saint-Étienne. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed to better understand the characteristics of the patient population. Multimorbidity was measured using raw diagnoses information and two specific scores based on clusters of diagnoses: the Hospital Frailty Risk Score and the Calderon-Larrañaga index. Based on these variables different machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random forest and k-nearest Neighbors) were used to predict near future rehospitalization and length of stay (LoS).The use of random forest algorithms yielded better performance to predict both 365 and 30 days rehospitalization and using the diagnoses ICD-10 codes directly was significantly more efficient. However, using the Calderon-Larrañaga's clusters of diagnoses can be used as an efficient substitute for diagnoses information for predicting readmission. The predictive power of the algorithms is quite low on length of stay indicator.Using machine learning techniques using patients' diagnoses information and Calderon-Larrañaga's score yielded efficient results to predict hospital readmission of multimorbid patients. These methods could help improve the management of care of multimorbid patients in hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W4312097857,"In 2020, schools in England closed for six months due to COVID-19, resulting in children being home-schooled. There is limited understanding about the impacts of this on children's mental and physical health and their education. Therefore, we explored how families coped with managing these issues during the school closures. We conducted 30 qualitative interviews with parents of children aged 18 years and under (who would usually be in school) between 16 and 21 April 2020. We identified three themes and eight sub-themes that impacted how families coped whilst schools were closed. We found that family dynamics, circumstances, and resources (Theme 1), changes in entertainment activities and physical movement (Theme 2) and worries about the COVID-19 pandemic (Theme 3) impacted how well families were able to cope. A key barrier to coping was struggles with home-schooling (e.g., lack of resources and support from the school). However, parents being more involved in their children's personal development and education were considered a benefit to home-schooling. Managing the lack of entertainment activities and in-person interactions, and additional health worries about loved ones catching COVID-19 were challenges for families. Parents reported adverse behaviour changes in their children, although overall, they reported they were coping well. However, pre-existing social and educational inequalities are at risk of exacerbation. Families with more resources (e.g., parental supervision, access to green space, technology to facilitate home-schooling and no special educational needs) were better able to cope when schools were closed. On balance, however, families appeared to be able to adapt to the schools being closed. We suggest that policy should focus on supporting families to mitigate the widening health and educational gap between families with more and less resources."
https://openalex.org/W4312097898,"The prevalence of colorectal neoplasm in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has increased twice as high as that in the general population. FibroScan is a new modality for evaluating hepatic steatosis. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the risk of high-risk colorectal neoplasia and hepatic steatosis examined using FibroScan. This was a cross sectional study of prospectively enrolled subjects who were scheduled to undergo index colonoscopy as a health screening between March 2018 and February 2019. The severity of steatosis was graded as normal, mild, moderate, or severe using FibroScan. A total of 140 consecutive subjects were enrolled and sequentially examined using FibroScan and colonoscopy. Subjects with hepatic steatosis had more high-risk colorectal neoplasia than those without hepatic steatosis. In addition, tumor size was larger in subjects with hepatic steatosis. In multivariable analysis, severe hepatic steatosis was an independent risk factor for high-risk colorectal neoplasia (adjusted odds ratio: 3.309, confidence interval: 1.043-10.498, p = 0.042). Alcohol consumption was also identified as a risk factor for high-risk colorectal neoplasia. In conclusion, severe hepatic steatosis on FibroScan is associated with the development of high-risk colorectal neoplasia. Thus, physicians should be aware of the association between colorectal neoplasia and hepatic steatosis assessed by FibroScan and its clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W4312097921,"Background A major unmet need for Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) clinical management is the lack of biomarkers for the early diagnosis of patients with Raynaud’s Phenomenon at high risk of evolving into SSc. Objective To identify proteins contained within serum exosomes employing an aptamer proteomic analysis that may serve to reveal patients with Raynaud’s Phenomenon at risk of developing SSc. Methods Exosomes were isolated from serum samples from patients with Primary Raynaud’s Phenomenon and from patients with Raynaud’s Phenomenon harbouring serum antinuclear antibodies (ANA) who may be at high risk of evolving into SSc. The expression of 1,305 proteins was quantified using SOMAscan aptamer proteomics, and associations of the differentially elevated or reduced proteins with the clinical subsets of Raynaud’s Phenomenon were assessed. Results Twenty one differentially elevated and one differentially reduced (absolute fold change &gt;|1.3|) proteins were identified. Principal component analysis using these 22 most differentially expressed proteins resulted in excellent separation of the two Raynaud’s Phenomenon clinical subsets. Remarkably, the most differentially elevated proteins are involved in enhanced inflammatory responses, immune cell activation and cell migration, and abnormal vascular functions. Conclusion Aptamer proteomic analysis of circulating exosomes identified differentially elevated or reduced proteins between Raynaud’s Phenomenon at high risk of evolving into SSc and Primary Raynaud’s Phenomenon patients. Some of these proteins are involved in relevant biological pathways that may play a role in SSc pathogenesis including enhanced inflammatory responses, immune cell activation, and endothelial cell and vascular abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W4312097932,"Sodium Fluoride (NaF) can change the expression of skeletal muscle proteins. Since skeletal muscle is rich in mitochondrial and contractile (sarcomeric) proteins, these proteins are sensitive to the effects of NaF, and the changes are dose-and time-dependent. In the current study, we have analysed the effect of high concentration s of NaF (80ppm) on mouse skeletal muscle at two different time points, i.e., 15 days and 60 days. At the end of the experimental time, the animals were sacrificed, skeletal muscles were isolated, and proteins were extracted and subjected to bioinformatic (Mass Spectrometric) analysis. The results were analysed based on changes in different mitochondrial complexes, contractile (sarcomeric) proteins, 26S proteasome, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The results showed that the mitochondrial proteins of complex I, II, III, IV and V were differentially regulated in the groups treated with 80ppm of NaF for 15 days and 60 days. The network analysis indicated more changes in mitochondrial proteins in the group treated with the higher dose for 15 days rather than 60 days. Furthermore, differential expression of (sarcomeric) proteins, downregulation of 26S proteasome subunits, and differential expression in proteins related to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway lead to muscle atrophy. The differential expression might be due to the adaptative mechanism to counteract the deleterious effects of NaF on energy metabolism. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD035014."
https://openalex.org/W4312097961,"In Portugal, the genetic diversity, origin of HBV and the Portuguese role in the dissemination of HBV worldwide were never investigated. In this work, we studied the epidemic history and transmission dynamics of HBV genotypes that are endemic in Portugal. HBV pol gene was sequenced from 130 patients followed in Lisbon. HBV genotype A was the most prevalent (n = 54, 41.5%), followed by D (n = 44, 33.8%), and E (n = 32, 24.6%). Spatio-temporal evolutionary dynamics was reconstructed in BEAST using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, with a GTR nucleotide substitution model, an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model, a Bayesian skyline plot, and a continuous diffusion model. HBV subgenotype D4 was the first to be introduced in Portugal around 1857 (HPD 95% 1699-1931) followed by D3 and A2 a few decades later. HBV genotype E and subgenotype A1 were introduced in Portugal later, almost simultaneously. Our results indicate a very important role of Portugal in the exportation of subgenotypes D4 and A2 to Brazil and Cape Verde, respectively, in the beginning of the XX century. This work clarifies the epidemiological history of HBV in Portugal and provides new insights in the early and global epidemic history of this virus."

https://openalex.org/W4312052549,"In mammalian cells, Smad2 and Smad3, two receptor-regulated Smad proteins, play crucial roles in the signal transmission of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and are involved in various cell regulatory processes, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated cell responses, that is, cell morphological changes, E-cadherin downregulation, stress fiber formation, and cell motility enhancement. Smad2 contains an additional exon encoding 30 amino acid residues compared with Smad3, leading to distinct Smad2 and Smad3 functional properties. Intriguingly, Smad2 also has an alternatively spliced isoform termed Smad2Δexon3 (also known as Smad2β) lacking the additional exon and behaving similarly to Smad3. However, Smad2Δexon3 and Smad3 signaling properties have not yet been compared in detail. In this study, we reveal that Smad2Δexon3 rescues multiple TGF-β-induced in vitro cellular responses that would become defective upon SMAD3 KO but does not rescue cell motility enhancement. Using Smad2Δexon3/Smad3 chimeric proteins, we identified that residues Arg-104 and Asn-210 in Smad3, which are not conserved in Smad2Δexon3, are key for TGF-β-enhanced cell motility. Moreover, we discovered that Smad2Δexon3 fails to rescue the enhanced cell motility as it does not mediate TGF-β signals to downregulate transcription of ARHGAP24, a GTPase-activating protein that targets Rac1. This study reports for the first time distinct signaling properties of Smad2Δexon3 and Smad3."
https://openalex.org/W4312089993,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus, the agent of COVID-19, caused unprecedented loss of lives and economic decline worldwide. Although the introduction of public health measures, vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics disrupted the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, the emergence of variants poses substantial threat. This study traced SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in Uganda by July 2021 to inform the necessity for refinement of the intervention medical products. A comprehensive in silico analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes detected in clinical samples collected from COVID-19 patients in Uganda revealed occurrence of structural protein variants with potential of escaping detection, resisting antibody therapy, or increased infectivity. The genome sequence dataset was retrieved from the GISAID database and the open reading frame encoding the spike, envelope, membrane, or nucleocapsid proteins was translated. The obtained protein sequences were aligned and inspected for existence of variants. The variant positions on each of the four alignment sets were mapped on predicted epitopes as well as the 3D structures. Additionally, sequences within each of the sets were clustered by family. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to assess relationship between the encountered spike protein sequences and Wuhan-Hu-1 wild-type, or the Alpha , Beta , Delta and Gamma variants of concern. Strikingly, the frequency of each of the spike protein point mutations F157L/Del, D614G and P681H/R was over 50%. The furin and the transmembrane serine protease 2 cleavage sites were unaffected by mutation. Whereas the Delta dominated the spike sequences (16.5%, 91/550), Gamma was not detected. The envelope protein was the most conserved with 96.3% (525/545) sequences being wild-type followed by membrane at 68.4% (397/580). Although the nucleocapsid protein sequences varied, the variant residue positions were less concentrated at the RNA binding domains. The dominant nucleocapsid sequence variant was S202N (34.5%, 205/595). These findings offer baseline information required for refining the existing COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W4312090039,"Workers' heat tolerance plays a crucial role in maintaining their health and performance in hot environments. This study aimed to empirically analyze the body heat tolerance of workers under a simulated warm environment. Twenty healthy male workers from the typical light metal industry (age: 23.15±2.45 years) were participated in the experimental study. Workers were exposed to two thermal environments (Ta = 22°C, RH = 35%, and Ta = 35°C, RH = 35%) in a simulated moderate workload in a climate-controlled room. The maximal aerobic capacity (VO2 max) and body fat mass of workers were determined. The heat tolerance indicators were determined based on heart rate (HR) and ear temperature (ET) before and after each experiment. A linear mixed model was employed to analyze body heat tolerance indicators using the SPSS statistical package. All physiological responses significantly increased in the warm air condition compared to the thermoneutral condition. The HR and ET increased by an average of 14 bpm and 0.75°C, respectively (p<0.05). The mixed model could accurately predict heat tolerance indicators (r = 0.95 and r = 0.97) so that the VO2 max and body fat mass were identified as the main individual influential factors. The VO2 max showed significant correlation with urinary specific gravity (r = -0.55, p<0.05), HR (r = -0.59, p<0.05), and ET (r = -0.57, p<0.05) in warm environment. The model confirmed that physical fitness is critical in increasing heat tolerance in warm environments. It can be a helpful screening tool for properly selecting workers in occupational medical examinations for working in warm air conditions. It is proposed that workers' regular exercise and lifestyle modifications can strengthen their heat tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W4312090121,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can differentiate into chondrocytes. Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3) is differentially expressed during chondrogenic differentiation and can be produced by MSC. EBI3 is also a subunit of interleukin (IL)-27 and IL-35, and it accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when its partners, such as IL-27 p28 and IL-35 p35, are insufficient. ER stress induced by protein accumulation is responsible for chondrogenic differentiation. However, the role of EBI3 and its relevance to the ER stress in chondrogenic differentiation of MSC have never been addressed. Here, we demonstrate that EBI3 protein is expressed in the early stage of chondrogenic differentiation of MSC. Additionally, knockdown, overexpression, or induction of EBI3 through IL-1β inhibits chondrogenesis. We show that EBI3 localizes and accumulates in the ER of MSC after overexpression or induction by IL-1β and TNF-α, whereas ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid decreases its accumulation in MSC. Moreover, EBI3 modulates ER stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1 α (IRE1α) after induced by IL-1β, and MSC-like cells coexpress EBI3 and IRE1α in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissue. Altogether, these data demonstrate that intracellular EBI3 commits to chondrogenic differentiation by regulating ER stress sensor IRE1α."
https://openalex.org/W4312090185,"Many African countries quickly responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 with lockdowns of public life. Yet, many have large numbers of dense informal settlements where infrastructure is shared, houses are small, and residents live on low incomes. These conditions make complying with curfews extraordinarily difficult. Using pedestrian motion sensors installed throughout an informal settlement in Cape Town, South Africa, we study how the lockdown affected mobility in the evenings, early mornings, and during the nights between February 14 and June 18, 2020. We find that mobility was already decreasing in March prior to the start of lockdown by 23% in paths-about half of the overall decline-and by 19% in shared courtyards. Starting with the lockdown on March 27, pedestrian activity decreased by 48% in comparison to February 2020 across paths and by 61% in shared courtyards. We notice the biggest changes on weekends, normally key leisure times, and between 6:00 pm and 9:00 pm and between 6:00 am and 8:00 am, spanning typical commute hours, though these hours continue to have the most activity indicating some people continue to commute. The results show that mobility reduction is large, though generally smaller than reductions observed in high-income countries. We find that residents of informal settlements comply with state-mandated lockdowns to the best of their ability given the circumstances, but that awareness of COVID-19 with less strict regulations prior to lockdown also led to mobility declines."
https://openalex.org/W4312090242,"Removal of excess dideoxy terminators from the sequencing mix after the enzymatic reaction is a key process affecting the dideoxy/Sanger sequencing quality. Ethanol precipitation may be the most popular clean-up method because of its low cost; however, it takes a long centrifugation time and frequently results in low quality sequence data. Commercially available clean-up kits provide high quality sequence data, while they generally have high cost. Here, we describe rapid, effective and low-cost dideoxy terminator clean-up method using a home-made magnetic beads suspension, MagNA, and magnetic separator. We found that MagNA enables rapid and efficient clean-up at ~1/100 of the cost of commercially available kits. The magnetic separator made using low-cost neodymium magnets worked well for the MagNA separation, representing a rapid, efficient and cost-effective dideoxy terminator clean-up system."

Linear and modified Poisson regression was used to examine the association between quality of life, changes in quality of life and other factors.The number of participants was 1583 (response rate 43%). Among 8 dimensions of the SF-36 (ranged 0-100), Vitality had the lowest score with a median score of 46. The median physical composite score (PCS) of the sample was 40.6 (IQR:20.8-53.2), 33.5% of the sample had an above-population average PCS score. The median mental composite score (MCS) of the sample was 20.3 (IQR:3.8-31.7), and 98.2% had an MCS score below average. 9.9% (95%CI:8.5%-11.4%) of the population reported a significant negative change in the quality of life. Fear of COVID-19 was not associated with significant changes in quality of life, nor MCS while having some association with PCS (Coef:-5.39;95%CI:-3to-7.8). Perceived reduction in quality of life was also associated with: being on clinical rotation COVID-19 (PR:1.5;95%CI:1.05-2.2), difficulties affording health services (PR:1.4;95%CI:1.02-1.95), obesity (PR:2.38;95%CI:1.08-5.25) and chronic disease (PR:1.92;95%CI:1.23-3), typical symptoms (PR:1.85; 95%CI:1.23-2.78) and atypical symptoms of COVID-19 (PR:2.32;95%CI:1.41-3.81).The majority of medical and nursing students had below average quality of life, with lower vitality and mental composite health score in the settings of COVID-19. Perceived decrease in quality of life was associated with clinical rotation, difficulties affording healthcare services and was not associated with Fear of COVID-19."

https://openalex.org/W4312097923,"The population's antibody response is a key factor in comprehending SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. This is especially important in African settings where COVID-19 impact, and vaccination rates are relatively low. This study aimed at characterizing the Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) in both SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals in Kisumu and Siaya counties in western Kenya using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. The IgG and IgM overall seroprevalence in 98 symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in western Kenya between December 2021-March 2022 was 76.5% (95% CI = 66.9-84.5) and 29.6% (95% CI = 20.8-39.7) respectively. In terms of gender, males had slightly higher IgG positivity 87.5% (35/40) than females 68.9% (40/58). Amidst the ongoing vaccination roll-out during the study period, over half of the study participants (55.1%, 95% CI = 44.7-65.2) had not received any vaccine. About one third, (31.6%, 95% CI = 22.6-41.8) of the study participants had been fully vaccinated, with close to a quarter (13.3% 95% CI = 7.26-21.6) partially vaccinated. When considering the vaccination status and seroprevalence, out of the 31 fully vaccinated individuals, IgG seropositivity was 81.1% (95% CI = 70.2-96.3) and IgM seropositivity was 35.5% (95% CI = 19.22-54.6). Out of the participants that had not been vaccinated at all, IgG seroprevalence was 70.4% (95% CI 56.4-82.0) with 20.4% (95% CI 10.6-33.5) seropositivity for IgM antibodies. On PCR testing, 33.7% were positive, with 66.3% negative. The 32 positive individuals included 12(37.5%) fully vaccinated, 8(25%) partially vaccinated and 12(37.5%) unvaccinated. SARs-CoV-2 PCR positivity did not significantly predict IgG (p = 0.469 [95% CI 0.514-4.230]) and IgM (p = 0.964 [95% CI 0.380-2.516]) positivity. These data indicate a high seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in western Kenya. This suggests that a larger fraction of the population was infected with SARS-CoV-2 within the defined period than what PCR testing could cover."
https://openalex.org/W4312097929,"In the search for alternatives to wood fuel, to meet the bio-energy requirement of an ever-increasing global population, the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan has supported farmers in many tropical countries to establish plantations of Beema bamboo (a tissue-cultured clone from Bambusa vulgaris) and Oxytenanthera abyssinica for bio-energy production. The quality of these species as solid biofuels is unknown due to the absence of data on their physico-thermal and emission characteristics. Using the American Standard for Testing and Materials and other internationally accepted standards, their ultimate and proximate analysis, and physico-thermal and emission properties were evaluated. Beema bamboo and O. abyssinica have high Hydrogen, organic and fixed Carbon contents and low quantities of ash, moisture content, volatile matter, Oxygen, Nitrogen and Sulphur. This will contribute to their heating values and low oxide emissions. Based on their High Heating Values (Beema bamboo = 23.22 MJ/kg; O. abyssinica = 23.26 MJ/kg), the species will be suitable for high energy-using applications. The Particulate Matter and Carbon Monoxide concentrations (Beema bamboo: 90 ug/m3 and 2.83 ppm respectively; O. abyssinica: 77.33 ug/m3 and 3.20 ppm respectively) are lower than the threshold (35000 ug/m3 and 9 ppm respectively) approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. These properties make the species good raw materials for solid biofuel which is safe for indoor use. Their use will contribute to reducing pressure on tropical forests for wood fuel and the health hazards associated with fossil fuel use."
https://openalex.org/W4312097951,"Invasive species are a pervasive driver of global change with increasing media coverage. Media coverage and framing can influence both invasive species management and policies, as well as shed light on research needs. Using the wild boar (Sus scrofa) invasion in Argentina as a case study, we conducted a content analysis of media coverage and scientific articles. Specifically, we compared news and scientific articles based on their emphasis: ecological, economic, and health impacts and the overall perception portrayed in the news: ""positive"" when the articles emphasized benefits from wild boar and ""negative"" when focused on damage and/or loss. A literature search using Google news, Web of Science, Scielo, and Google Scholar yielded a total of 194 news articles and 37 research papers on wild boar in Argentina. More than half of the news articles focused on economic impacts of wild boar (56%) such as sport hunting, illegal hunting, and road accidents; while 27% focused on ecological impacts, and 10% on health impacts. In contrast, the majority of the scientific articles (65%) focused on ecological impacts of wild boar on native species and ecosystems; while 21% were related to health impacts and only 8.3% of scientific articles were related to economic impacts. This mismatch between media and science reveals a disconnection between social and scientific interests in wild boar and their management in Argentina, and it provides insights to research needs and prevention of management conflicts. Additionally, we found that 66.8% of news articles focused on ""negative"" aspects of wild boar, while 33.2% of news articles portrayed ""positive"" perceptions. This finding is very important because the management of invasive species such as wild boar usually requires lethal techniques, and the success of the programs depend on favorable social and political support. Good science communication is therefore key to helping scientists and managers perform more effective management actions."
https://openalex.org/W4312097991,"Healthcare-acquired infections (HAI) pose vast health and economic burdens. Proper hand-hygiene is effective for reducing healthcare-acquired infections (HAI) incidence, yet staff compliance is generally low. This study assessed the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effect of employing medical clowns to enhance hand-hygiene among physicians and nurses. Staff perception of the intervention and its impact on hand-hygiene was assessed via self-report questionnaires. Nearly 1,500 hand-hygiene compliance observations were conducted in accordance with WHO guidelines before, during and after the intervention. In each of three hospitals in Israel, two departments were selected—one in which medical clowns routinely operate and one clown-naive department. Professional medical clowns acted as hand-hygiene promoters employing humorous tactics to encourage hand-sanitizing based on the WHO ""5 Moments"" model. The clown appeared in each department seven times during the 2-week intervention phase. Pre-intervention hand-hygiene compliance ranged from just over 50% to 80% across hospitals and departments. Overall, about 70% of nurses (N = 132) and 80% of physicians (N = 49) felt the intervention improved personal and departmental hand-hygiene, with large inter-department variation. Pre- to post-intervention hand-hygiene compliance increased by 4% -25% (3.5–14.8 percentage points) in four departments, three of which had low baseline compliance levels. Results of this feasibility study suggest that employing medical clowns as hand-hygiene promoters as a novel approach toward HAI prevention is feasible and welcome by hospital staff."
https://openalex.org/W4312098013,"Health disparities in heart failure (HF) show that Black patients face greater ED utilization and worse clinical outcomes. Transitional care post-HF hospitalization, such as 7-day early follow-up visits, may prevent ED returns. We examine whether early follow-up is associated with lower ED returns visits within 30 days and whether Black race is associated with receiving early follow-up after HF hospitalization. This was a retrospective cohort analysis of all Black and White adult patients at 13 hospitals in Michigan hospitalized for HF from October 1, 2017, to September 30, 2020. Adjusted risk ratios (aRR) were estimated from multivariable logistic regressions. The analytic sample comprised 6,493 patients (mean age = 71 years (SD 15), 50% female, 37% Black, 9% Medicaid). Ten percent had an ED return within 30 days and almost half (43%) of patients had 7-day early follow-up. Patients with early follow-up had lower risk of ED returns (aRR 0.85 [95%CI, 0.71-0.98]). Regarding rates of early follow-up, there was no overall adjusted association with Black race, but the following variables were related to lower follow-up: Medicaid insurance (aRR 0.90 [95%CI, 0.80-1.00]), dialysis (aRR 0.86 [95%CI, 0.77-0.96]), depression (aRR 0.92 [95%CI, 0.86-0.98]), and discharged with opioids (aRR 0.94 [95%CI, 0.88-1.00]). When considering a hospital-level interaction, three of the 13 sites with the lowest percentage of Black patients had lower rates of early follow-up in Black patients (ranging from 15% to 55% reduced likelihood). Early follow-up visits were associated with a lower likelihood of ED returns for HF patients. Despite this potentially protective association, certain patient factors were associated with being less likely to receive scheduled follow-up visits. Hospitals with lower percentages of Black patients had lower rates of early follow-up for Black patients. Together, these may represent missed opportunities to intervene in high-risk groups to prevent ED returns in patients with HF."

Results Sixty-seven snakebite victims and 147 other household members were interviewed during a household survey. All snakebite cases reported to having visited a health facility after snakebite with the majority 55/67 (82.1%) reporting the use, prior attendance to medical care, of some form of local treatment such as tourniquets 13 (19.4%), local incision 11 (16.4%), and snakestone 7 (10.4%). None of the public health facilities in Monduli District attended a snakebite case and had never stocked anti-snake venom products. In this area, 45 snakebite cases were reported to be managed at Meserani snake park clinic where anti-snake venom products were available and provided for free in the period between January 2017 and December 2017. Conclusion Majority of the snakebite cases at Meserani Juu relied on local methods for the management of snake bites of which most are of unknown efficacy and safety. Furthermore, none of the primary public health facilities in Monduli District stocked antivenom despite being a habitat for different kinds of venomous snakes. The government and local non-government organizations should collaborate so as to improve the anti-snake venom availability and the provision of snakebite preventive and management awareness programs, especially to the rural communities."

Chuck was a unique scientist who effortlessly spanned disciplines to improve our understanding of the brain in fundamental ways. He touched an astonishing array of people in science whose lives are now irreversibly impoverished by his absence. Chuck received his BA in Psychology from Harvard University and an MD from Yale University. During that time, he became interested in research and decided to get a PhD at the (then) Rockefeller Institute (combining mathematics, physics, and biology). Thus began his lifelong scientific voyage that somehow managed to magically meld both mechanistic, detail-oriented biology and big-picture, mathematically driven ideas. Chuck was on the faculty of the University of Washington in Seattle from 1963 to 1975, and then at Yale University until 1990. At Yale, he was also the chair of the Molecular Neurobiology section for 7 years and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. He moved to the Salk Institute in 1990 and remained there for the rest of his life. Chuck’s research touched on many of the core principles of brain function—electrical excitability, synaptic transmission and plasticity, neural circuit organization, and computation. Throughout his remarkable career, Chuck combined theory and experiment in seamless ways. Starting with clear assumptions, Chuck always scaled his way up the reasoning ladder with mathematical rigor. In this progression, he never shied away from biological detail, whether it was about the specific amino acids involved in ion channel gating, the details of morphological diversity in neurons and synapses, or the connectivity maps across different cortical areas. Chuck’s doctoral work with H. Keffer Hartline on inhibition in the Limulus eye, although only published as a thesis, was referred to in Hartline’s Nobel lecture. Remarkably, Chuck wrote a textbook on neurophysiology just two years after completing his PhD. Chuck’s work at the University of Washington in the Department of Physiology & Biophysics centered on synaptic physiology and biophysics. Interestingly, Chuck also worked on olfactory circuits there, to which he would return in the last decade of his career. Presciently, he found evidence for anatomical and functional hierarchy in the 3-layer olfactory cortex, which is now an active subject of inquiry. Chuck’s research in Seattle involved creative use of fluctuation analysis to uncover properties of synapses. This work was done during the remarkable golden age of the study of transmitter release, much of it at the neuromuscular junction, leading to the Nobel Prize in 1970 for Axelrod, Katz, and von Euler. Seattle was where he discovered the so-called A current, the first of many potassium currents beyond the classic delayed-rectifier current in the Hodgkin-Huxley explication of the action potential. Not content with simply reporting the discovery of a new ionic current, Chuck made a computational model that predicted repetitive spike firing in the molluscan neuron under study with the help of complex numerical integration using digital computers back in 1971. In reporting of these discoveries, Chuck’s papers offered a precise and quantitative description (in effect, an explanation) of many features of electrical activity in neurons. He also summarized all of his ionic current work in reviews that were as easy to read as they were deep, where he repeatedly displayed an ability to artfully strip away the details and get to the core insights from any experiment or series of experiments. His short News & Views “reportage” pieces explaining key advances seemed to free him from the staid writing style we academics adopt when communicating our primary research. After Chuck’s move to Yale in 1975, a flurry of influential papers on detailed biophysical descriptions of ion channel function emerged. In our current enchantment with single-molecule biophysics, often associated with optical imaging, it is easy to forget that ion channels were the first proteins to have been studied at the single molecule level using electrical measurements. Chuck’s work, along with that of many others, revealed an astonishing array of kinetic features of ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels such as ion selectivity, permeation, activation, and inactivation. Glutamate receptors then became a primary focus of Chuck’s research starting in the 1980s, where he was in the thick of things with elegant studies from his group and others showing that different ligands could activate different conductances. This observation was initially interpreted as a result of the same molecular entity entering different states before the later realization that there are distinct types of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The ongoing analysis of glutamate receptors seamlessly merged with the study of glutamatergic synapses in Chuck’s group, which had now moved to the sunny shores of La Jolla at the Salk Institute. Fluctuation analysis remained a key conceptual tool for Chuck in the study of glutamatergic synapses. His work showed that trial-to-trial variability of synaptic responses at single central synapses is rather substantial and is due to fluctuations in transmitter release as well as postsynaptic receptor activation. Unreliable synapses are still underappreciated in neural network research where weights are treated as simple deterministic scalars—real synaptic weights are unreliable for any given event but remain statistically predictable and fill a large dynamic range. Chuck’s interest in synapses also extended to the phenomenon of long-term synaptic plasticity and its underlying mechanisms. Chuck dove headlong into the study of the mechanisms of transmitter release, readily collaborating with leading molecular neuroscientists, notably Susumu Tonegawa and Thomas Südhof. The papers from that period are wonderful examples of molecular-level explanations of long-observed physiological phenomena such as the calcium dependence of transmitter release, short-term synaptic dynamics, and long-term potentiation. Chuck was entangled in the vigorous debate on the locus of long-term synaptic plasticity at the time, his elegant papers always filled with creative ideas even when evidence accumulated for a different view from his own. While the study of neurotransmitter release has always had a rich biophysical and physiological history, vesicle endocytosis and traffic had a decidedly cell-biological flavor in the early days of their study. In the final decades of the 20th century, exciting technical developments facilitated a wave of physiological and biophysical studies on synaptic vesicle recycling in which Chuck was intimately involved (including in the debate about the so-called kiss-and-run vesicle recycling). It was during this time that I was fortunate to have begun my own scientific relation with Chuck as a postdoctoral fellow. It was life-altering to be in his orbit, absorbing his acute intelligence, bottomless generosity with time and ideas, his infectious enthusiasm, and the disarming humility with which he approached every interaction. In his last years at the Salk, Chuck’s intellectual wanderlust led him to more theoretical work. His papers on scaling of neural circuits and their elements offer creative insights into the potential design principles at work in the brain. This period also brought him back to olfactory circuits, half a century after his earliest work in cat olfactory cortex! The sheer delight he got from thinking about problems from scratch was such a refreshing sight in a well-established scientist. Not everyone today may be aware that Chuck always listed authors in alphabetical order in his papers (exceptions were in collaborations led by other established life scientists). This was a common practice some decades ago, essentially signaling that all authors contributed approximately equally. Chuck was also gracious about not listing himself in papers to which he felt he hadn’t made significant contributions, even when it involved notable developments such as the patch clamp technique. In his Nobel Prize biography, Erwin Neher states, “In 1976, we published the first single channel records while I spent a year in the laboratory of Charles F. Stevens at Yale University.” Of course, the “we” there refers to Neher and Bert Sakmann, but one suspects that Chuck’s contribution to the Prize-winning work was not insubstantial. Chuck was recognized for his contributions in many ways, including some notable prizes such as the Gerard Prize and the Karl Spencer Lashley Award as well as induction into the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. While these formal recognitions may be reasonable validations of scientific worth, it is Chuck’s influence as a gifted thinker as well as a mentor to and supporter of a staggering number of younger scientists that should be the centerpiece of his legacy. Chuck was driven to make discoveries, and it is hard to imagine his imaginative and restless mind ever settling on one topic. I recall Chuck mentioning somewhat wistfully during a summer sojourn at the Santa Fe Institute that if he had worked on one thing for a long time, perhaps he would have gotten greater recognition—but I am not sure whether he actually believed it or cared about big prizes. Rather, his diverse interests are the very reason for his enormous influence—a glance at Neurotree.org gives a sense of his influential academic mentorship. But there was so much more—countless students and scholars have been touched by Chuck, coming away the richer from the generous attention he would give to even brief encounters. Chuck was unfailingly unpretentious and kind, sparkling and sharp, witty and wise. Chuck had some idiosyncratic habits. He seemed to never miss getting breakfast with his spouse, Jane (an accomplished historian of 18th and 19th century Western classical music), while reading his newspaper. Lunch was invariably a few crackers with cheese (often brie), which he would toast, accompanied by a glass of red wine, followed by a café latte and a piece of chocolate. For this routine, he half-seriously gave the reason of a purported correlation of longevity with red wine and chocolate. Another quintessential Chuck thing was the deliberate mathematical scrawling with dry-erase markers on the glass walls surrounding his Salk office (or any other writing surface when he was elsewhere) as he discussed science with others. His penchant for giving talks using real-time writing on transparencies that were reflected onto the screen by an overhead projector always brought smiles. He would begin with simple drawings, slow-burning his way through an introduction that would set the stage for deeper insights conveyed with a light touch. What made them so compelling, I think, was Chuck’s ability to strip away all the detail and get at the core concept—one might disagree with the conclusions, but at least the logic was there for all to see. Amusingly, when electronic writing devices became available, Chuck would set them up to be projected and would methodically write on them the way he would on transparencies. In an unusual practice for a life scientist, Chuck used to leave his (largely) experimental lab in the summer and spend mini-sabbaticals in theoretically oriented places such as the Aspen Center for Physics (as a general member, and earlier as chair of the board), the Santa Fe Institute (where he was an external faculty member and on its science board), and the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara (where he was an advisor for some years). In these stimulating spaces, he would think about scientific problems more broadly using pen and paper. He said he went to these places to learn new (usually theoretical) subjects and to think deeply about questions he became interested in. Reciprocally, with his expansive brain power, Chuck attracted a sizeable cadre of quantitatively minded scientists to think about problems in biophysics and neuroscience. We often assign value to and praise people who make specific discoveries that are often fortuitous or result from reaching the finish line first in a dense race. Chuck was that rare type of empirically grounded scientist who spent time thinking carefully and explaining things in a logical manner from axiomatic assumptions—essentially building models and theories that help us situate and evaluate scientific data broadly. It is heartwarming to see that he was so well respected and admired, presenting a marvelous role model for younger scholars to emulate. This unicorn of a scientist will be sorely missed. I am grateful to Gary Yellen and Martyn Goulding for their thoughtful comments."
