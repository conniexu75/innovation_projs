https://openalex.org/W2074515322,"Corpora allata control mating in females principally by inducing feeding on the tergum of a displaying male. Mating induces an inhibitory nervous mechanism, the seat of which is posterior to the last abdominal ganglion, causing an immediate loss of receptivity by suppressing feeding behavior. After parturition, females may again be receptive. Transection of the nerve cord before or just after mating causes excessive sexual behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2022747397,"To simulate glacial conditions, a mixture of ice and quartz grains was subjected to grinding under hydrostatic pressure of 500 bars. Electron microphotographs of these ""synthetic"" glaciated surfaces were then compared with electron microphotographs of grain surfaces which had been abraded and crushed by glacial action, and the correspondence was found to be good. Thus it appears possible to distinguish glacial sands from beach and eolian sands by examining the surface textures of these grains with the electron microscope."

https://openalex.org/W2019537173,The fact that samples of Odontaster validus from the Balleny Islands (67 degrees S) and Robertson Bay (71 degrees S) closely resembled reproductively samples taken from McMurdo Sound (77 degrees S) indicates reproductive synchrony in this species over much or all of their circumcontinental antarctic distribution. This synchrony suggests that the reproductive periodicities of O. validus are both adapted to and synchronized by the summer period of phytoproduction and that neither light nor temperature changes have any direct synchronizing role.

https://openalex.org/W2019649918,"Beauveria tenella, an insect pathogen, grows well and sporulates freely in submerged culture. Enzymes that loosened bovine hair that were found in broth cultures were not produced in the presence of chitin, and substitution of peptone broth for peptone-glucose broth did not increase their concentration. Under certain conditions, oxalic acid was the main metabolic product in the peptone medium."
https://openalex.org/W2043861082,Diamond was found by x-ray diffraction techniques in the Dyalpur stone; this is the fourth meteorite in which this mineral has been discovered. The diamond crystallites resemble those of Novo-Urei more than those of Goalpara.
https://openalex.org/W1985935889,Complete larval and pupal development occur in colonies of honeybees when adult bees are allowed to feed upon an artificial diet containing gibberellic acid. In the absence of gibberellic acid larvae die in the 3rd or 4th day of development.

https://openalex.org/W2064884847,Wounded excised shoots of Coleus blumeni (Benth.) were geotropically stimulated by rotation on a klinostat at 3 rev/min at right angles to the horizontal axis and placed alternately in inverted and upright positions at 24-hour intervals. These treatments resulted in the differentiation of significantly greater numbers of wound vessel members. The pattern of wound-vessel formation was altered by rotation on the klinostat but remained unaffected by 24-hour inversion.
