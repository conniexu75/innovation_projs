https://openalex.org/W1994540310,"Synthesis of monodisperse iron-platinum (FePt) nanoparticles by reduction of platinum acetylacetonate and decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl in the presence of oleic acid and oleyl amine stabilizers is reported. The FePt particle composition is readily controlled, and the size is tunable from 3- to 10-nanometer diameter with a standard deviation of less than 5%. These nanoparticles self-assemble into three-dimensional superlattices. Thermal annealing converts the internal particle structure from a chemically disordered face-centered cubic phase to the chemically ordered face-centered tetragonal phase and transforms the nanoparticle superlattices into ferromagnetic nanocrystal assemblies. These assemblies are chemically and mechanically robust and can support high-density magnetization reversal transitions."
https://openalex.org/W2156643487,"Dendritic cells (DC) capture microorganisms that enter peripheral mucosal tissues and then migrate to secondary lymphoid organs, where they present these in antigenic form to resting T cells and thus initiate adaptive immune responses. Here, we describe the properties of a DC-specific C-type lectin, DC-SIGN, that is highly expressed on DC present in mucosal tissues and binds to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120. DC-SIGN does not function as a receptor for viral entry into DC but instead promotes efficient infection in trans of cells that express CD4 and chemokine receptors. We propose that DC-SIGN efficiently captures HIV-1 in the periphery and facilitates its transport to secondary lymphoid organs rich in T cells, to enhance infection in trans of these target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1981659539,"Selective chemical reactions enacted within a cellular environment can be powerful tools for elucidating biological processes or engineering novel interactions. A chemical transformation that permits the selective formation of covalent adducts among richly functionalized biopolymers within a cellular context is presented. A ligation modeled after the Staudinger reaction forms an amide bond by coupling of an azide and a specifically engineered triarylphosphine. Both reactive partners are abiotic and chemically orthogonal to native cellular components. Azides installed within cell surface glycoconjugates by metabolism of a synthetic azidosugar were reacted with a biotinylated triarylphosphine to produce stable cell-surface adducts. The tremendous selectivity of the transformation should permit its execution within a cell's interior, offering new possibilities for probing intracellular interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2163570329,"Contact between dendritic cells (DC) and resting T cells is essential to initiate a primary immune response. Here, we demonstrate that ICAM-3 expressed by resting T cells is important in this first contact with DC. We discovered that instead of the common ICAM-3 receptors LFA-1 and alphaDbeta2, a novel DC-specific C-type lectin, DC-SIGN, binds ICAM-3 with high affinity. DC-SIGN, which is abundantly expressed by DC both in vitro and in vivo, mediates transient adhesion with T cells. Since antibodies against DC-SIGN inhibit DC-induced proliferation of resting T cells, our findings predict that DC-SIGN enables T cell receptor engagement by stabilization of the DC-T cell contact zone."

Here, we report the identification of a stem cell in the adult mouse eye, which represents a possible substrate for retinal regeneration. Single pigmented ciliary margin cells clonally proliferate in vitro to form sphere colonies of cells that can differentiate into retinal-specific cell types, including rod photoreceptors, bipolar neurons, and Müller glia. Adult retinal stem cells are localized to the pigmented ciliary margin and not to the central and peripheral retinal pigmented epithelium, indicating that these cells may be homologous to those found in the eye germinal zone of other nonmammalian vertebrates."

https://openalex.org/W2045444647,"The formation of a single product from terminal functionalization of linear alkanes from a transition metal-catalyzed reaction is reported. The rhodium complex Cp*Rh(eta(4)-C(6)Me(6)) (Cp*, C(5)Me(5); Me, methyl) catalyzes the high-yield formation of linear alkylboranes from commercially available borane reagents under thermal conditions. These reactions now allow catalytic, regiospecific functionalization of alkanes under thermal conditions. The organoborane products are among the most versatile synthetic intermediates in chemistry and serve as convenient precursors to alcohols, amines, and other common classes of functionalized molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2082178034,"During development, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins regulate formation of neurons from multipotent progenitor cells. However, bHLH factors linked to gliogenesis have not been described. We have isolated a pair of oligodendrocyte lineage genes (Olg-1 and Olg-2) that encode bHLH proteins and are tightly associated with development of oligodendrocytes in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). Ectopic expression of Olg-1 in rat cortical progenitor cell cultures promotes formation of oligodendrocyte precursors. In developing mouse embryos, Olg gene expression overlaps but precedes the earliest known markers of the oligodendrocyte lineage. Olg genes are expressed at the telencephalon-diencephalon border and adjacent to the floor plate, a source of the secreted signaling molecule Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Gain- and loss-of-function analyses in transgenic mice demonstrate that Shh is both necessary and sufficient for Olg gene expression in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2052130134,"Efficient electrophilic metalation of aromatic C-H bonds leading to new C-C bond formation through regio- and stereoselective addition to alkynes and alkenes has been realized by a catalytic amount (0.02 to 5 mole percent) of palladium(II) or platinum(II) compounds in a mixed solvent containing trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature. Various arenes undergo unexpected selective trans hydroarylation to terminal or internal C&cjs0812;C bonds inter- and intramolecularly with high efficiency (up to a turnover number of 4500 for palladium), especially for electron-rich arenes, giving thermodynamically unfavorable cis-alkenes, and the oxygen- and nitrogen-containing heterocycles. The simplicity, generality, and efficiency of this process should be very attractive to the possible industrial application for the functionalization of arenes."
https://openalex.org/W1979447754,"Axonal regeneration in the lesioned mammalian central nervous system is abortive, and this causes permanent disabilities in individuals with spinal cord injuries. In adult rats, olfactory ensheathing glia (OEG) transplants successfully led to functional and structural recovery after complete spinal cord transection. From 3 to 7 months post surgery, all OEG-transplanted animals recovered locomotor functions and sensorimotor reflexes. They presented voluntary hindlimb movements, they supported their body weight, and their hindlimbs responded to light skin contact and proprioceptive stimuli. In addition, relevant motor axons (corticospinal, raphespinal, and coeruleospinal) regenerated for long distances within caudal cord stumps. Therefore, OEG transplantation provides a useful repair strategy in adult mammals with traumatic spinal cord injuries. Our results with these cells could lead to new therapies for the treatment of spinal cord lesions in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1979610420,"Examination of human bladder, head and neck, and lung primary tumors revealed a high frequency of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations. The majority of these somatic mutations were homoplasmic in nature, indicating that the mutant mtDNA became dominant in tumor cells. The mutated mtDNA was readily detectable in paired bodily fluids from each type of cancer and was 19 to 220 times as abundant as mutated nuclear p53 DNA. By virtue of their clonal nature and high copy number, mitochondrial mutations may provide a powerful molecular marker for noninvasive detection of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2129605816,"Basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factors have been identified for neurons and their precursors but not for glial cells. We have identified two bHLH factors, Oligo1 and Oligo2, that are specifically expressed in zones of neuroepithelium from which oligodendrocyte precursors emerge, as well as in the precursors themselves. Expression of Oligo2 in the spinal cord precedes that of platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα), the earliest known marker of oligodendrocyte precursors, by several days. Ectopic expression of Oligo2 in vivo causes ectopic expression of Sox10, an HMG-box transcription factor expressed in oligodendrocyte and other glial precursors. These data identify Oligo genes as the earliest known markers of oligodendrocyte lineage determination and suggest they play a causal role in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2130414223,"Allergic asthma is caused by the aberrant expansion in the lung of T helper cells that produce type 2 (T H 2) cytokines and is characterized by infiltration of eosinophils and bronchial hyperreactivity. This disease is often triggered by mast cells activated by immunoglobulin E (IgE)–mediated allergic challenge. Activated mast cells release various chemical mediators, including prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2 ), whose role in allergic asthma has now been investigated by the generation of mice deficient in the PGD receptor (DP). Sensitization and aerosol challenge of the homozygous mutant (DP −/− ) mice with ovalbumin (OVA) induced increases in the serum concentration of IgE similar to those in wild-type mice subjected to this model of asthma. However, the concentrations of T H 2 cytokines and the extent of lymphocyte accumulation in the lung of OVA-challenged DP −/− mice were greatly reduced compared with those in wild-type animals. Moreover, DP −/− mice showed only marginal infiltration of eosinophils and failed to develop airway hyperreactivity. Thus, PGD 2 functions as a mast cell–derived mediator to trigger asthmatic responses."
https://openalex.org/W2004191360,"Synapse formation requires changes in cell morphology and the upregulation and localization of synaptic proteins. In the cerebellum, mossy fibers undergo extensive remodeling as they contact several granule cells and form complex, multisynaptic glomerular rosettes. Here we show that granule cells secrete factors that induce axon and growth cone remodeling in mossy fibers. This effect is blocked by the WNT antagonist, sFRP-1, and mimicked by WNT-7a, which is expressed by granule cells. WNT-7a also induces synapsin I clustering at remodeled areas of mossy fibers, a preliminary step in synaptogenesis. Wnt-7a mutant mice show a delay in the morphological maturation of glomerular rosettes and in the accumulation of synapsin I. We propose that WNT-7a can function as a synaptogenic factor."

https://openalex.org/W2134005234,"The effects of increasing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and climate on net carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems of the conterminous United States for the period 1895–1993 were modeled with new, detailed historical climate information. For the period 1980–1993, results from an ensemble of three models agree within 25%, simulating a land carbon sink from CO 2 and climate effects of 0.08 gigaton of carbon per year. The best estimates of the total sink from inventory data are about three times larger, suggesting that processes such as regrowth on abandoned agricultural land or in forests harvested before 1980 have effects as large as or larger than the direct effects of CO 2 and climate. The modeled sink varies by about 100% from year to year as a result of climate variability."
https://openalex.org/W2077574127,"Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as precursor proteins with a cleavable N-terminal presequence and are imported into mitochondria. We report here the NMR structure of a general import receptor, rat Tom20, in a complex with a presequence peptide derived from rat aldehyde dehydrogenase. The cytosolic domain of Tom20 forms an all alpha-helical structure with a groove to accommodate the presequence peptide. The bound presequence forms an amphiphilic helical structure with hydrophobic leucines aligned on one side to interact with a hydrophobic patch in the Tom20 groove. Although the positive charges of the presequence are essential for import ability, presequence binding to Tom20 is mediated mainly by hydrophobic rather than ionic interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1990841830,"The function of Akt (protein kinase B) is regulated by phosphorylation on two sites conserved within the AGC kinase family: the activation loop (Thr-308) in the kinase core and a hydrophobic phosphorylation site on the carboxyl terminus (Ser-473). Thr-308 is phosphorylated by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, (PDK-1), whereas the mechanism of phosphorylation of the hydrophobic site, tentatively referred to as the PDK-2 site, is unknown. Here we report that phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif requires catalytically competent Akt. First we show that a kinase-inactive construct of Akt fails to incorporate phosphate at Ser-473 following IGF-1 stimulation in vivo but does incorporate phosphate at Thr-308 and a second carboxyl-terminal site, Thr-450; this ligand triggers the phosphorylation of both sites in wild-type enzyme. Neither does a catalytically inactive construct in which phosphorylation at the activation loop is blocked, T308A, become phosphorylated on the hydrophobic site in response to stimulation. Second, we show that Akt autophosphorylates on the hydrophobic site in vitro: phosphorylation of the activation loop by PDK-1 triggers the phosphorylation of the hydrophobic site in kinase-active, but not thermally inactivated, Akt α.

Many members of this superfamily are controlled by two phosphorylation switches, one on a segment near the entrance to the active site and a second on the carboxyl terminus. Phosphorylation at one or both positions appears to be required to correctly align residues to create a catalytically competent conformation. For kinases such as protein kinase A and the conventional protein kinase Cs (PKC),1 phosphorylation of these positions is constitutive and part of the processing of the enzyme (1.Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphorylation of kinases such as p70 S6 kinase is tightly regulated by specific stimuli (2.Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal switch contains two motifs: a turn motif, typically rich in Pro, which, in the case of protein kinase A, is positioned at the apex of a tight turn (Ser-338) (3.Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), and a hydrophobic motif (FXXS/TXF) first identified in protein kinase C and p70 S6 kinase (4.Keranen L.M.

The membrane-localized enzyme becomes rapidly phosphorylated at two positions, the activation loop (Thr-308) and the hydrophobic phosphorylation motif (Ser-473). The activation loop reaction is catalyzed by the recently discovered PDK-1 (14.Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr.

The phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif is tightly coupled to that of the activation loop; however, the mechanism of this phosphorylation is unknown. The mitogen sensitivity of this site, like that of the activation loop, has led to the proposal that it, too, is phosphorylated by an agonist-sensitive kinase, tentatively named PDK-2 (14.Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, such a kinase has remained refractory to molecular or biochemical identification (17.Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R521-R524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this regard, protein kinase C βII has recently been shown to be regulated by autophosphorylation, and not by a heterologous kinase, at its hydrophobic phosphorylation motif (19.Behn-Krappa A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 728-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20.Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In addition to the mitogen-sensitive sites,32P labeling studies have revealed that Akt is constitutively phosphorylated at Thr-450 in vivo (18.Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). This position corresponds to the turn motif in the protein kinase Cs as it has the consensus motif T/SPXD (21.Edwards A.S. Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6461-6468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This contribution addresses the mechanism of phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal sites of Akt. Specifically, we ask which sites depend on the intrinsic catalytic activity of the enzyme in order to dissect the contribution of autophosphorylation versusheterologous phosphorylation in the regulation of Akt. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylinositol tris-3,4,5-phosphate (PtdIns-3,4,5-P3) was obtained from Matreya, palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (PC), and bovine brainl-α-phosphatidylserine (PS) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Microcystin and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were from Calbiochem. Protein kinase C βII (rat) was purified from the baculovirus expression system as described (22.Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Baculoviral expressed, homogeneously pure mouse Akt α was a generous gift from Dr. Frank Sicheri, Samuel Lunenefeld Research Institute. An antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated Thr-641 in the turn motif of protein kinase C βII (23.Sweatt J.D. Atkins C.M. Johnson J. English J.D. Roberson E.D. Chen S.J. Newton A. Klann E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was provided by David Sweatt (Baylor College of Medicine). Antibodies, which recognize phosphorylated Thr-308 or phosphorylated Ser-473 were obtained from New England Biolabs. In one experiment, an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated hydrophobic motif of Akt and all the protein kinase C isozymes was used (New England Biolabs, PAN-PKC antibody). The catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 was a generous gift from Dr. Anna DePaoli-Roach (Indiana University). All other chemicals were reagent-grade. The murine Akt T308A and K179M mutants were a kind gift of Philip Tsichlis (Thomas Jefferson University). The Akt T450A mutant was made by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis using the Pfu Quickchange methodology (Stratagene). Human embryonic kidney HEK 293E cells and HepG2 cells expressing the β subunit of the wild-type platelet-derived growth factor-receptor (β-PDGF-R, a kind gift of Andrius Kazlauskas, Harvard Medical School) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Purified Akt (80 nm) was incubated with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1, in the presence of lipid vesicles, as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Incubation mixtures included PC vesicles (100 μm total lipid) containing no other lipid, 10 mol % PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, or 10 mol % PtdIns-3,4,5-P3and 45 mol % PS. Microcystin (4 μm) was included in some experiments. Protein kinase C βII (45 nm) was treated similarly except that lipid was presented in the form of sonicated dispersions of phosphatidylserine (140 μm) and diacylglycerol (4 μm) and 200 nmCaCl2 was present. Reactions were quenched by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and samples analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide) followed by silver staining or Western blot analysis. HEK 293E and HepG2 cells were transiently transfected either by the calcium-phosphate procedure (24.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar) or by the LipofectAMINE procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (25.Chou M.M. Hou W.

Cells were serum-starved for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with no added serum. Cells were stimulated with either IGF-1 (20 ng ml−1, Life Technologies, Inc.) or with PDGF-BB (50 ng ml−1, Life Technologies, Inc.), typically for 10 min. Immunoprecipitated Akt proteins were assayed for protein kinase activity using histone H2B as substrate, as described by Franke et al. (26.Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). A highly purified insect cell-expressed recombinant Akt preparation was used to detect phosphorylation of relevant sites by PDK-1 in vitro. Recombinant human PDK-1 was expressed as a fusion protein in insect cells. For in vitro assays, 0.1 μg of each protein was mixed in a nonradioactive kinase assay reaction (using 80 μm [ATP]) either in the presence or absence of PS:PC:PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 vesicles (see above). The carboxyl terminus of Akt is phosphorylated at two positions: Thr-450 is constitutively phosphorylated (18.Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar, 27.Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) and Ser-473 is phosphorylated in a mitogen-sensitive manner (18.Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). Alignment of the carboxyl-terminal residues of Akt isozymes with those of protein kinase C βII revealed the Thr-450 corresponds to the turn motif described for the protein kinase Cs (Fig.1 A). The mechanism of phosphorylation of both positions is autophosphorylation for protein kinase C (19.Behn-Krappa A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 728-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Given the high sequence similarity between these two kinases, we explored whether such a mechanism accounted for the phosphorylation of the corresponding sites in Akt. First, we tested whether unstimulated Akt is phosphorylated on the turn motif. Homogeneously pure Akt from the baculoviral expression system was used for this study; mass spectrometric analysis revealed there was no phosphate on either the activation loop or the hydrophobic site. 2F. Sicheri, personal communication. Pure Akt was treated with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a phosphatase that dephosphorylates the turn motif of protein kinase C (4.Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The silver stain in Fig. 1 B shows that untreated Akt migrated as a major band with an apparent molecular mass of 64 KDa, with a minor (<10%) faster migrating species (apparent molecular mass of 62 kDa). Treatment with PP1 resulted in disappearance of the upper band and accumulation of the faster migrating species. Samples from this experiment were also probed with an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated, but not unphosphorylated, turn motif of protein kinase C (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 1 B, lower panel, shows that this antibody cross-reacted with untreated Akt (lane 1). However, it did not react with the faster migrating species resulting from phosphatase treatment. These data reveal that unstimulated Akt is almost quantitatively phosphorylated on the turn motif. For comparison, lanes 6 and7 show the migration of purified, baculoviral-expressed protein kinase C βII before (lane 6) and after treatment with PP1 (lane 7). The shift in electrophoretic mobility following PP1 treatment arises from loss of phosphate at the turn motif and the hydrophobic motif; a smaller shift, similar to that observed for Akt above, results from loss of phosphate at the hydrophobic motif only (4.Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The increased electrophoretic mobility and loss of immunoreactivity with the phospho-specific antibody did not result from proteolysis: the presence of microcystin in the incubation medium (lane 10) prevented both the shift and loss of immunoreactivity revealing that phosphatase activity was required for these effects. To address whether autophosphorylation or phosphorylation by an upstream kinase regulates the two carboxyl-terminal positions of Akt, we first examined the agonist-dependent protein kinase activities of wild-type and mutant Akt alleles in vivo. HA-tagged constructs of Akt were expressed in HepG2 cells expressing the wild-type β PDGF-R or in HEK 293E cells (18.Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar, 26.Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N.

HEK 293E cells (Fig. 2 A) or HepG2 cells (Fig.2 B) were stimulated for 10 min with IGF-1 or PDGF-BB, respectively, and Akt activity from HA immunoprecipitates was assayed using histone H2B as substrate. Fig. 2 A, lower panel, shows that wild-type Akt was activated 12.5-fold by treatment of HEK 293 cells with IGF-1. Importantly, the activity of T450A was similarly (10.7-fold) stimulated by IGF-1. Identical results were obtained with PDGF-stimulation of HepG2 cells: PDGF induced an 8.3-fold increase in wild-type Akt activity and a 7.5-fold increase in the activity of the T450A mutant (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). Thus, the effect of the T450A mutation in Akt was not restricted to one cell type alone. In contrast, neither the K179M (lanes 8 and 9) or the T308A (lanes 4and 5) constructs had any detectable activity in the absence or presence of mitogens. These data reveal that negative charge at position 450 does not influence either the basal or stimulated activity of Akt. Previous studies have indicated that the turn motif in Akt, Thr-450, is constitutively phosphorylated in serum-starved cells and that phosphorylation of this site does not contribute to the activity of the enzyme (18.Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar, 27.Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The mechanism of regulation of this site has not been examined to date. The Western blots in Fig. 2, Aand B, show the expression of wild-type Akt, the activation loop mutant T308A, the turn motif mutant T450A, and the kinase-inactive mutant K179M in HEK 293E cells detected using anti-HA antibodies (upper panels). Wild-type Akt migrated as a doublet (lanes 2 and 3). The upper band comigrated with Akt that is phosphorylated on Thr-450 and was labeled with the phospho-turn motif antibody (Fig. 3, α-P450), whereas the lower band comigrated with completely dephosphorylated Akt (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). Importantly, the T450A mutant (lanes 6 and7) comigrated with the faster migrating wild-type species consistent with lack of negative charge at position 450 (see Fig.1 B). Similar to wild-type Akt, the kinase-inactive mutant K179M (lanes 8 and 9) migrated as a doublet, consistent with partial phosphorylation of Thr-450. Similarly, the activation loop mutant, T308A (lanes 4 and 5) also comigrated with wild-type enzyme, although it was enriched in upper band. This mutant was labeled with the anti-phospho-turn antibody (Fig. 3, α-P450). These data reveal that Thr-450 is phosphorylated by a reaction that depends neither on the catalytic competence of Akt nor on the phosphorylation state of Thr-308. These results indicate that both wild-type Akt as well as the T450A mutant retain full catalytic competency, whereas both T308A and K179M are completely inactive. We next explored whether phosphorylation of the hydrophobic site depended on the intrinsic catalytic activity of Akt. The Western blot in Fig. 3 shows immunoprecipitated Akt proteins from control and IGF-1-stimulated HEK 293 cells probed with an antibody that specifically labels phosphorylated Thr-473 (α-P473). This antibody strongly labeled wild-type Akt from stimulated (lane 3), but not unstimulated (lane 2), cells. Similarly, it labeled the T450A construct in stimulated (lane 7), but not unstimulated (lane 6), cells. For both wild-type and the T450A construct, IGF-1 stimulation resulted in a 13–15-fold increase in immunoreactivity. In contrast, IGF-1 treatment had no detectable effect on the immunoreactivity of the two catalytically inactive constructs, T308A (lanes 4 and 5) or K179M (lanes 8 and 9). Based on the sensitivity of the detection method, any phosphorylation of Ser-473 would be less than 5% that observed for wild-type enzyme. Thus, phosphorylation of Ser-473 requires the catalytic competence of Akt. One possibility is that Thr-473 phosphorylation requires phosphorylation of Thr-308. Thus, we addressed the phosphorylation state of the activation loop in the kinase-inactive constructs using an antibody that specifically labels phosphorylated Thr-308 (α-P308). Fig. 3, lower panel, shows that IGF-1 caused a marked increase in the phosphorylation of the activation loop of wild-type enzyme (lane 3), T450A (lane 7), but not T308A (lane 5), which has an alanine at the phosphoacceptor position. Importantly, the K179M mutant was phosphorylated on the activation loop to comparable levels as wild-type enzyme following IGF-1 stimulation. Thus, despite having a phosphate on the activation loop, the K179M mutant was unable to incorporate phosphate at position Ser-473. Identical results were obtained upon expression of kinase-inactive mutants in PDGF-stimulated HepG2 cells (data not shown). These data reveal that phosphorylation of the hydrophobic site requires the intrinsic catalytic competence of Akt. We next tested whether the phosphorylation of Thr-308 by PDK-1 in vitro triggered the autophosphorylation of pure Akt. Homogeneously pure Akt and PDK-1 were incubated with Mg2+/ATP, in the presence of PS:PC:PtdIns-3,4,5-P3vesicles. The electrophoretic mobility and phosphorylation of specific residues was assessed by immunoblotting with either anti-HA, anti-P308, or anti-P473 antibodies. Two forms of Akt were used for this experiment: untreated Akt or Akt that had been thermally inactivated by sonication. Fig. 4 A,middle panel, shows that both forms of Akt were phosphorylated on Thr-308, with maximal phosphorylation catalyzed within 5 min. Thus, the untreated and thermally inactivated forms of Akt were equally good substrates for PDK-1, indicating that the sonication had not grossly perturbed the structure of the kinase. Analysis with the P473 antibody revealed incubation with Mg2+/ATP resulted in phosphorylation of Ser-473. The kinetics of phosphorylation mirrored those of Thr-308, with maximal phosphorylation observed within the first 5 min of the reaction. Note that a mobility shift to a slower migrating species (single arrow) lagged behind the phosphorylation of Thr-308/Ser-473; this shift likely represents additional autophosphorylations that follow the two priming events. A more detailed analysis of the initial phosphorylation (Fig. 4 C) revealed that phosphorylation of Ser-473 closely followed that of Thr-308, with Thr-308 being the first phosphorylation event (compare 20-s time points). Fig. 4 B,left panels, shows that the phosphorylation of Ser-473 was abolished in the thermally inactivated sample. This reveals that the Ser-473 phosphorylation requires the activity of Akt and cannot result from contaminating kinases or from phosphorylation by PDK-1, as suggested recently (28.Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic site has generally been accepted to be regulated by a heterologous kinase, referred to as PDK-2 (14.Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Ser-473 kinase (9.Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a yeast two-hybrid screen led to the identification of the carboxyl terminus of the protein kinase C-related kinase, PRK2, as a module interacting with PDK-1 (28.Balendran A.

In vitro studies revealed that a peptide based on this sequence, PIF (PDK-1 interacting fragment), promoted the incorporation of phosphate onto Ser-473 of Akt in the presence of PDK-1. This led to the proposal that PDK-2 is actually PDK-1 which undergoes a dramatic, and unprecedented, switch in substrate specificity through its interaction with PIF. Because this study did not examine whether kinase-inactive constructs of Akt are phosphorylated by PIF-bound PDK-1, it did not address whether autophosphorylation was promoted by binding of PDK-1 to PIF. One possibility is that PDK-1 binding to Akt sterically or conformationally blocks the hydrophobic site, thus preventing autophosphorylation. Autophosphorylation may be triggered by release of PDK-1 from Akt, an event that may be promoted by PIF."

One was resistant to single-strand nuclease digestion and displayed the mobility properties of coupled leading- and lagging- strand replication products. Intermediates of coupled, unidirectional mtDNA replication were found in mouse liver and human placenta and were the predominant species in cultured cells recovering from transient mtDNA replication. Replication intermediates sensitive to single-strand nuclease were most abundant in untreated cultured cells. These are presumed to derive from the orthodox, strand-asynchronous mode of mtDNA replication. These findings indicate that two modes of mtDNA replication operate in mammalian cells and that changes in mtDNA copy number involve an alteration in the mode of mtDNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2006355149,"Inhibition of ""leak"" potassium (K+) channels is a widespread CNS mechanism by which transmitters induce slow excitation. We show that TASK-1, a two pore domain K+ channel, provides a prominent leak K+ current and target for neurotransmitter modulation in hypoglossal motoneurons (HMs). TASK-1 mRNA is present at high levels in motoneurons, including HMs, which express a K+ current with pH- and voltage-dependent properties virtually identical to those of the cloned channel. This pH-sensitive K+ channel was fully inhibited by serotonin, norepinephrine, substance P, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, a group I metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist. The neurotransmitter effect was entirely reconstituted in HEK 293 cells coexpressing TASK-1 and the TRH-R1 receptor. Given its expression patterns and the widespread prevalence of this neuromodulatory mechanism, TASK-1 also likely supports this action in other CNS neurons."

Nova-1 null mice show specific splicing defects in two inhibitory receptor pre-mRNAs, glycine alpha2 exon 3A (GlyRalpha2 E3A) and GABA(A) exon gamma2L. Nova protein in brain extracts specifically bound to a previously identified GlyRalpha2 intronic (UCAUY)3 Nova target sequence, and Nova-1 acted directly on this element to increase E3A splicing in cotransfection assays. We conclude that Nova-1 binds RNA in a sequence-specific manner to regulate neuronal pre-mRNA alternative splicing; the defect in splicing in Nova-1 null mice provides a model for understanding the motor dysfunction in POMA."

Comparison of double-stranded RNA regions and positions of proteins identified in both cryo-EM and X-ray maps indicates good overall agreement but points to rearrangements of ribosomal components required for the subunit association. Fitting of known components of the 50S stalk base region into the map defines the architecture of the GTPase-associated center and reveals a major change in the orientation of the alpha-sarcin-ricin loop.

https://openalex.org/W2087358641,"Phospholipase C and two inositol polyphosphate (IP) kinases constitute a signaling pathway that regulates nuclear messenger RNA export through production of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6). The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate kinase of this pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, designated Ipk2, was found to be identical to Arg82, a regulator of the transcriptional complex ArgR-Mcm1. Synthesis of inositol 1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate, but not IP6, was required for gene regulation through ArgR-Mcm1. Thus, the phospholipase C pathway produces multiple IP messengers that modulate distinct nuclear processes. The results reveal a direct mechanism by which activation of IP signaling may control gene expression."

These findings indicate that pharmacological modulation of the D1 signaling pathway can produce long-lasting changes in functional circuits underlying working memory. Resetting this pathway by brief exposure to the agonist may provide a valuable strategy for therapeutic intervention in schizophrenia and other dopamine dysfunctional states."
https://openalex.org/W2000791321,"The neurotrophin survival dependence of peripheral neurons in vitro is regulated by the proapoptotic BCL-2 homolog BAX. To study peripheral neuron development in the absence of neurotrophin signaling, we have generated mice that are double null for BAX and nerve growth factor (NGF), and BAX and the NGF receptor TrkA. All dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons that normally die in the absence of NGF/TrkA signaling survive if BAX is also eliminated. These neurons extend axons through the dorsal roots and collateral branches into the dorsal horn. In contrast, superficial cutaneous innervation is absent. Furthermore, rescued sensory neurons fail to express biochemical markers characteristic of the nociceptive phenotype. These findings establish that NGF/TrkA signaling regulates peripheral target field innervation and is required for the full phenotypic differentiation of sensory neurons."

Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate in vivo associations of the SCN mPER proteins with each other and with the mCRY proteins, and of mCRY proteins with mTIM, but no mPER/mTIM interactions. Examination of the effects of weak and strong resetting light pulses on SCN clock proteins highlights a central role for mPER1 in photic entrainment, with no acute light effects on either the mCRY or mTIM proteins.

Here, we have examined whether hippocampal NMDARs are also needed for temporal memory. We applied trace fear conditioning to knockout mice lacking NMDARs only in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. This paradigm requires temporal processing because the conditional and unconditional stimuli are separated by 30 s (trace). We found that knockout mice failed to memorize this association but were indistinguishable from normal animals when the trace was removed. Thus, NMDARs in CA1 are crucial for the formation of memories that associate events across time."

We experimentally induced death of specific HVC neuron types in adult male zebra finches using targeted photolysis. Induced death of a projection neuron type that normally turns over resulted in compensatory replacement of the same type. Induced death of the normally nonreplaced type did not stimulate their replacement. In juveniles, death of the latter type increased recruitment of the replaceable kind. We infer that neuronal death regulates the recruitment of replaceable neurons. Song deteriorated in some birds only after elimination of replaceable neurons. Behavioral deficits were transient and followed by variable degrees of recovery. This raises the possibility that induced neuronal replacement can restore a learned behavior."

Clones of cells homozygous for null RhoA mutations were specifically labeled in the mushroom body (MB) neurons of mosaic brains. We found that RhoA is required for neuroblast (Nb) proliferation but not for neuronal survival. Surprisingly, RhoA is not required for MB neurons to establish normal axon projections. However, neurons lacking RhoA overextend their dendrites, and expression of activated RhoA causes a reduction of dendritic complexity. Thus, RhoA is an important regulator of dendritic morphogenesis, while distinct mechanisms are used for axonal morphogenesis."

We also analyzed double and triple mutants lacking other cytoskeletal DGC components (utrophin and dystrophin) and myotubes lacking a alpha-DB or a transmembrane DGC component (dystroglycan). Our results suggest that alpha-DB acts via its linkage to the DGC to enhance the stability of postsynaptic specializations following their DGC-independent formation; dystroglycan may play additional roles in assembling synaptic basal lamina. Together, these results demonstrate involvement of distinct protein complexes in the formation and maintenance of the synapse and implicate the DGC in the latter process."

This rapid physiological change is ultimately accompanied by a matching anatomical loss of input from the deprived eye. This remodeling is thought to be initiated at the thalamocortical synapse. Ocular dominance plasticity after brief (24 hours) monocular deprivation was analyzed by intrinsic signal optical imaging and by targeted extracellular unit recordings. Deprived-eye responsiveness was lost in the extragranular layers, whereas normal binocularity in layer IV was preserved. This finding supports the hypothesis that thalamocortical organization is guided by earlier changes at higher stages."

We have addressed this using rings with various combinations of wild-type and binding-defective mutant apical domains, enabled by their production as single polypeptides. A wild-type extent of binary complex formation with two stringent substrate proteins, malate dehydrogenase or Rubisco, required a minimum of three consecutive binding-proficient apical domains.

The mammalian homolog FAST-2 activates the hox gene goosecoid where formation of a higher order complex of FAST-2-Smad2-Smad4 is also essential for transactivation (17.Labbe E. Silvestri C.

Transcription factor μF3 (TFE3) binds to the E-box of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter, whereas Smad3 and Smad4 bind to a sequence adjacent to the TFE3 binding site to cooperatively activate PAI-1 gene transcription (10.Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).We have reported that Smad1 interacts with homeodomain transcription factor Hoxc-8 in response to BMP signaling (8.Shi X.M.

Hoxc-8 belongs to a highly conserved hox gene family and is expressed in limbs, backbone rudiments, the neural tube of mouse mid-gestation embryos, and in the cartilage and skeleton of newborns (19.Simeone A.

The interaction domains between the two proteins were characterized. Two regions within the amino-terminal 87 amino acid residues of Smad1 were mapped to interact with the homeodomain of Hoxc-8. Stable expression of recombinant cDNAs encoding the Hoxc-8 interaction domains of Smad1 in 2T3 osteoblast precursor cells stimulated osteoblast differentiation-related gene expression and lead to mineralized bone matrix formation. In this communication we show that Smad6 interacts Hoxc-8 as a complex when binding to DNA, thereby inhibiting Smad1-mediated transcriptional activity as negative feedback loop in the nucleus.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have previously demonstrated that Smad1 interacts with Hoxc-8 in response to BMP stimulation (8.Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Hoxc-8 functions as a transcription repressor in BMP signaling. The interaction of Smad1 with Hoxc-8 dislodges Hoxc-8 binding from its element resulting in initiation of gene transcription (8.Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To characterize the Hoxc-8-mediated transcription mechanism in BMP-induced gene activation, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to identify transcription factors that interact with Hoxc-8. An intact Hoxc-8 cDNA fused with the Gal4 DNA binding domain was used as a bait plasmid to screen a human U2 OS osteoblast-like cell cDNA library constructed in pACT2 plasmid. After two rounds of screening, we obtained 26 positive clones. DNA sequence analysis identified one clone as Smad6 (Table 1) . Smad6 and Smad7 are immunolocalized in the nucleus of rat epiphyseal plate (22.Sakou T. Onishi T. Yamamoto T. Nagamine T. Sampath T.K. ten Dijke P. J. Bone Miner.

The interaction of Smad6 with Hoxc-8 suggests that Smad6 may have a novel antagonistic function in the nucleus.Table ISpecific interaction of Smad6 with Hoxc-8 in a yeast two-hybrid systemGroupBaitPreyβ-Gal activity1pGBT9pACT212pGBT9pACT2-Smad633pGBT9pACT2-Smad6c84pGBT9-Hoxc-8pACT225pGBT9-Smad1pACT2-Hoxc-8596pGBT9-Hoxc-8pACT2-Smad62867pGBT9-Hoxc-8pACT2-Smad6c1957The interaction was assayed in liquid culture of mutant yeast strain Y190, which requires His, Leu, and Trp to grow. pGBT9-Hox c-8 and pACT2-Smad6 plasmids carry Trp and Leu as their selective markers, respectively. The interaction between Smad6 and Hoxc-8 enables the yeast to synthesize His and induces β-gal expression. The arbitrary units of β-gal activities for yeast bearing different plasmids were plotted as shown. Open table in a new tab The initial Smad6 cDNA clone (Smad6C in Table 1) encodes amino acids 281 to 496 of a 496-amino acid protein. The interaction between Hoxc-8 and Smad6 was further confirmed with a β-gal filter lift assay (data not shown) and quantified by a liquid β-gal assay (Table 1). When the full length of Smad6 fused with the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain was tested in the two-hybrid system, it showed a weaker interaction with Hoxc-8 in comparison with the carboxyl-terminal domain (Smad6C). Deletion of the Smad6 amino-terminal domain may change the protein conformation in a way that the carboxyl-terminal region becomes easier to interact with Hoxc-8. The assays of both empty bait vector (pGBT9) with Smad6C or Smad6 full-length cDNAs in prey plasmids and empty prey vector (pACT2) with full-length Hoxc-8 in bait vector showed very little activity. Compared with the interaction between Smad1 and Hoxc-8, the interaction of Smad6 with Hoxc-8 is about 5 times stronger (Table 1).To investigate the interaction of Smad6 with Hoxc-8 in mammalian cells and the effect of BMP stimulation on this interaction, COS-1 cells were transiently co-transfected with expression plasmids for FLAG-Smad6, HA-Hoxc-8, and/or constitutively active BMP type IA receptor ALK3 (Q233D). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. The results represented in Fig. 1 demonstrate that Smad6 (see Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8) was co-immunoprecipitated with HA-Hoxc-8. BMP induces Smad6 mRNA expression (25.Afrakhte M. Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Heldin N.E. ten Dijke P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 26.Takase M. Imamura T. Sampath T.K. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and overexpression of ALK3 (Q233D) did not significantly change the interaction of Smad6 with Hoxc-8 (lane 8), indicating that BMP stimulation is not required for the interaction between Smad6 and Hoxc-8. Our initial Smad6 clone only encodes the carboxyl-terminal domain, indicating that this region of the protein may be involved in the interaction with Hoxc-8. To further investigate this observation, two FLAG-tagged Smad6 truncation expression plasmids were constructed. As shown in Fig.1, Smad6C exhibits a strong interaction with Hoxc-8 (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, the Smad6 amino-terminal with the linker region (Smad6NL) failed to bind to Hoxc-8 in immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 1, lane 6). Smad proteins contain highly conserved amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains (referred to as MH1 and MH2 domains, respectively). The MH1 domain inhibits biological activities of the MH2 domain because of interactions between these two distal sites (27.Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Like other regulatory Smads, Smad6 also contains a conserved MH2 domain and short segments of MH1 domain homology (28.Newfeld S.J. Wisotzkey R.G. Kumar S. Genetics. 1999; 152: 783-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, our results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal domain of Smad6 interacts with Hoxc-8 and that the amino terminus negatively regulates interaction between the two proteins.We examined the effect of the interaction between Hoxc-8 and Smad6 on Hoxc-8 DNA binding activity. Gel shift assays were performed with purified GST-Smad6 and GST-Hoxc-8 fusion proteins using osteopontin Hoxc-8 DNA binding element as a probe. As expected, Hoxc-8 protein binds to the DNA probe, which is inhibited by Smad1 (Fig.2 a, lanes 5 and6). Smad6 alone did not bind to the DNA element (lane 4). Interestingly, Incubation of both Hoxc-8 and Smad6 proteins yields a distinct shifted band with a molecular weight higher than Hoxc-8 binding alone, indicating that Hoxc-8 and Smad6 bind to the DNA element as a complex (lane 7). More importantly, the formation of the Smad6-Hoxc-8 complex eliminated the inhibitory effects of Smad1 on Hoxc-8 DNA binding (lane 8). Yeast two-hybrid assays already demonstrated that the interaction between Hoxc-8 and Smad6 is much stronger than that between Hoxc-8 and Smad1 (Table 1).Hox proteins have been demonstrated to interact with Smad1, but not Smad2 and -3, in response to BMP stimulation (8.Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To examine whether the interaction between Smad6 and Hoxc-8 is also specifically involved in the BMP signaling pathway, Smad7 was tested for its interaction with Hox proteins (Fig. 2 b). Like Smad2 and -3, Smad7 did not interact with either Hoxc-8 or Hoxa-9 (Fig. 2 b, lanes 4, 7, and 10). Considering Smad6 as only interacting with phosphorylated Smad1 in the cytoplasm (14.Hata A. Lagna G. Massague J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), our results also suggest that Smad6 be preferentially involved in BMP signaling. Smad4, the common partner for all receptor-regulated Smads and interaction with Hoxc-8, was examined for the same purpose (Fig.2 c). In comparison with Smad1, the complex of Smad6 and Hoxc-8 did not block the interaction of Smad4 with Hoxc-8 completely (Fig. 2 c, lanes 7 and 9). In fact, Smad4 can only be passively translocated into the nucleus by forming hetero-oligomers with any of the receptor-regulated Smads (29.Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Again, these results support that Smad6 is an important antagonist preferentially for the BMP signaling pathway.To investigate whether the Smad6-Hoxc-8 complex inhibits the interaction of Smad1 with Hoxc-8 in activating gene transcription, we utilized the model described in our earlier studies (8.Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the Smad1-Hoxc-8 interaction domain linked to a nuclear localization signal (Smad1B) stimulates BMP downstream gene expression and induces osteoblast differentiation from osteogenic cells (8.Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 30.Yang X. Ji X. Shi X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). When the BMP-inducible construct (Hox-pGL3) was co-transfected in Mv1Lu cells with the Smad1B expression plasmid, the luciferase activity was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 a). This model provides an ideal assay to directly examine the Smad6 antagonistic function in the nucleus. Because Smad1B mimics BMP-induced gene transcription without BMP receptor phosphorylation involving and interaction with Smad6 of Smad1 (13.Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 14.Hata A. Lagna G. Massague J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), this assay avoids Smad6 inhibitory function in the cytoplasm. Hox-pGL3 construct was co-transfected in Mv1Lu cells with Hoxc-8 and/or Smad6 expression plasmid. As shown in Fig. 3 b, overexpression of Hoxc-8 or Smad6 alone moderately inhibited Smad1B-induced transcription activity. Most importantly, co-transfection of both Hoxc-8 and Smad6 plasmids completely abolished the Smad1B-induced luciferase activity. To validate this observation, we transfected Mv1Lu cells with a mutated construct, mHox-pGL3, in which the core nucleotides of the Hoxc-8 binding site were mutated from TAAT to GCCG. Transfection of the mutant construct dramatically reduced Smad1B-induced reporter activity. As expected, the inhibition mediated by co-transfection of Smad6 and Hoxc-8 was also reduced (Fig.3 c).Figure 3The Hoxc-8 DNA binding site is required for Smad6-mediated transcription inhibition. a, Smad1-Hoxc-8 interaction domain (Smad1B) induces transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Hox-pGL3 construct (500 ng), containing the osteopontin Hox binding site linked to the SV40 promoter, was co-transfected in Mv1lu cells with different amounts of Smad1B expression plasmid. b, Smad6 inhibits Smad1B-induced transcription in the presence of Hoxc-8. Hox-pGL3 construct was co-transfected with Smad1B (300 ng), Hoxc-8 (25 ng), and/or Smad6 (100 ng) expression plasmids. c, mutation of the Hox binding site abolishes Smad1B stimulation. mHox-pGL3 (500 ng), containing the mutated osteopontin Hox binding site in Hox-pGL3 construct, was co-transfected with Smad1B (300 ng), Hoxc-8 (25 ng), and/or Smad6 (100 ng) plasmids. Cell lysates in a,b, and c were assayed for luciferase activity normalized to Renilla luciferase levels 48 h after transfection. Experiments were repeated 3 times in triplicate.d, both Smad6 and Hoxc-8 are localized in the nucleus. Mv1Lu cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged Hoxc-8 and GFP-Smad6 in the presence or absence of BMP-4. 48 h after transfection, cells were stained with monoclonal antibody against HA tag. Hoxc-8 was detected with secondary antibody conjugated to Cy3. Cells transfected with GFP expression plasmid alone serve as the control. All images are magnified by 1000.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Finally, protein localization analysis demonstrated that both Smad6 and Hoxc-8 are highly expressed in the nucleus (Fig. 3 d). Differing from Smad7, Smad6 nuclear exportation was not induced with BMP-4. Taken together with immunocoprecipitation of Smad6 with Hoxc-8 and formation of the Smad6-Hoxc-8 complex in gel shift assays, these data suggest co-localization of Smad6 and Hoxc-8 in the nucleus. Thus, our results are the first to demonstrate that Smad6 has an antagonistic function toward BMP signaling in the nucleus in addition to its interaction with BMP type I receptor and Smad1 in the cytoplasm. Members of TGF-β1superfamily transduce their signals into the cell through a family of mediator proteins called Smads. Receptor-regulated Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 mediate BMP signaling, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 respond to TGF-β (1.Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

In addition, Smad6 has also been demonstrated to interact with phosphorylated Smad1 to prevent the formation of an active signaling complex of Smad1 and Smad4, preferentially inhibiting the signaling pathways activated by BMPs (14.Hata A.

Studies on the mechanism by which Smads mediate TGF-β-/activin-regulated gene transcription have led to the discovery of several Smad-interacting nuclear transcription factors and their cis-acting DNA elements. In particular, the Xenopus forkhead activin signal transducer-1 (FAST-1) binds to an activin response element upstream of the homeobox gene mix2. The transcription activation requires the presence of activin and assembly of a FAST-1-Smad2-Smad4 complex (9.Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The mammalian homolog FAST-2 activates the hox gene goosecoid where formation of a higher order complex of FAST-2-Smad2-Smad4 is also essential for transactivation (17.Labbe E. Silvestri C.

The results represented in Fig. 1 demonstrate that Smad6 (see Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8) was co-immunoprecipitated with HA-Hoxc-8. BMP induces Smad6 mRNA expression (25.Afrakhte M. Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Heldin N.E. ten Dijke P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 26.Takase M. Imamura T. Sampath T.K. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and overexpression of ALK3 (Q233D) did not significantly change the interaction of Smad6 with Hoxc-8 (lane 8), indicating that BMP stimulation is not required for the interaction between Smad6 and Hoxc-8. Our initial Smad6 clone only encodes the carboxyl-terminal domain, indicating that this region of the protein may be involved in the interaction with Hoxc-8. To further investigate this observation, two FLAG-tagged Smad6 truncation expression plasmids were constructed. As shown in Fig.1, Smad6C exhibits a strong interaction with Hoxc-8 (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, the Smad6 amino-terminal with the linker region (Smad6NL) failed to bind to Hoxc-8 in immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 1, lane 6). Smad proteins contain highly conserved amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains (referred to as MH1 and MH2 domains, respectively). The MH1 domain inhibits biological activities of the MH2 domain because of interactions between these two distal sites (27.Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Like other regulatory Smads, Smad6 also contains a conserved MH2 domain and short segments of MH1 domain homology (28.Newfeld S.J. Wisotzkey R.G. Kumar S. Genetics. 1999; 152: 783-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, our results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal domain of Smad6 interacts with Hoxc-8 and that the amino terminus negatively regulates interaction between the two proteins.We examined the effect of the interaction between Hoxc-8 and Smad6 on Hoxc-8 DNA binding activity. Gel shift assays were performed with purified GST-Smad6 and GST-Hoxc-8 fusion proteins using osteopontin Hoxc-8 DNA binding element as a probe. As expected, Hoxc-8 protein binds to the DNA probe, which is inhibited by Smad1 (Fig.2 a, lanes 5 and6). Smad6 alone did not bind to the DNA element (lane 4). Interestingly, Incubation of both Hoxc-8 and Smad6 proteins yields a distinct shifted band with a molecular weight higher than Hoxc-8 binding alone, indicating that Hoxc-8 and Smad6 bind to the DNA element as a complex (lane 7). More importantly, the formation of the Smad6-Hoxc-8 complex eliminated the inhibitory effects of Smad1 on Hoxc-8 DNA binding (lane 8). Yeast two-hybrid assays already demonstrated that the interaction between Hoxc-8 and Smad6 is much stronger than that between Hoxc-8 and Smad1 (Table 1).Hox proteins have been demonstrated to interact with Smad1, but not Smad2 and -3, in response to BMP stimulation (8.Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To examine whether the interaction between Smad6 and Hoxc-8 is also specifically involved in the BMP signaling pathway, Smad7 was tested for its interaction with Hox proteins (Fig. 2 b). Like Smad2 and -3, Smad7 did not interact with either Hoxc-8 or Hoxa-9 (Fig. 2 b, lanes 4, 7, and 10). Considering Smad6 as only interacting with phosphorylated Smad1 in the cytoplasm (14.Hata A. Lagna G. Massague J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), our results also suggest that Smad6 be preferentially involved in BMP signaling. Smad4, the common partner for all receptor-regulated Smads and interaction with Hoxc-8, was examined for the same purpose (Fig.2 c). In comparison with Smad1, the complex of Smad6 and Hoxc-8 did not block the interaction of Smad4 with Hoxc-8 completely (Fig. 2 c, lanes 7 and 9). In fact, Smad4 can only be passively translocated into the nucleus by forming hetero-oligomers with any of the receptor-regulated Smads (29.Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Again, these results support that Smad6 is an important antagonist preferentially for the BMP signaling pathway.To investigate whether the Smad6-Hoxc-8 complex inhibits the interaction of Smad1 with Hoxc-8 in activating gene transcription, we utilized the model described in our earlier studies (8.Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the Smad1-Hoxc-8 interaction domain linked to a nuclear localization signal (Smad1B) stimulates BMP downstream gene expression and induces osteoblast differentiation from osteogenic cells (8.Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 30.Yang X. Ji X. Shi X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). When the BMP-inducible construct (Hox-pGL3) was co-transfected in Mv1Lu cells with the Smad1B expression plasmid, the luciferase activity was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 a). This model provides an ideal assay to directly examine the Smad6 antagonistic function in the nucleus. Because Smad1B mimics BMP-induced gene transcription without BMP receptor phosphorylation involving and interaction with Smad6 of Smad1 (13.Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 14.Hata A. Lagna G. Massague J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 30.Yang X. Ji X. Shi X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), this assay avoids Smad6 inhibitory function in the cytoplasm. Hox-pGL3 construct was co-transfected in Mv1Lu cells with Hoxc-8 and/or Smad6 expression plasmid. As shown in Fig. 3 b, overexpression of Hoxc-8 or Smad6 alone moderately inhibited Smad1B-induced transcription activity. Most importantly, co-transfection of both Hoxc-8 and Smad6 plasmids completely abolished the Smad1B-induced luciferase activity. To validate this observation, we transfected Mv1Lu cells with a mutated construct, mHox-pGL3, in which the core nucleotides of the Hoxc-8 binding site were mutated from TAAT to GCCG. Transfection of the mutant construct dramatically reduced Smad1B-induced reporter activity. As expected, the inhibition mediated by co-transfection of Smad6 and Hoxc-8 was also reduced (Fig.3 c).Finally, protein localization analysis demonstrated that both Smad6 and Hoxc-8 are highly expressed in the nucleus (Fig. 3 d). Differing from Smad7, Smad6 nuclear exportation was not induced with BMP-4. Taken together with immunocoprecipitation of Smad6 with Hoxc-8 and formation of the Smad6-Hoxc-8 complex in gel shift assays, these data suggest co-localization of Smad6 and Hoxc-8 in the nucleus. Thus, our results are the first to demonstrate that Smad6 has an antagonistic function toward BMP signaling in the nucleus in addition to its interaction with BMP type I receptor and Smad1 in the cytoplasm. We have previously demonstrated that Smad1 interacts with Hoxc-8 in response to BMP stimulation (8.Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Hoxc-8 functions as a transcription repressor in BMP signaling. The interaction of Smad1 with Hoxc-8 dislodges Hoxc-8 binding from its element resulting in initiation of gene transcription (8.Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To characterize the Hoxc-8-mediated transcription mechanism in BMP-induced gene activation, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to identify transcription factors that interact with Hoxc-8. An intact Hoxc-8 cDNA fused with the Gal4 DNA binding domain was used as a bait plasmid to screen a human U2 OS osteoblast-like cell cDNA library constructed in pACT2 plasmid. After two rounds of screening, we obtained 26 positive clones. DNA sequence analysis identified one clone as Smad6 (Table 1) . Smad6 and Smad7 are immunolocalized in the nucleus of rat epiphyseal plate (22.Sakou T. Onishi T. Yamamoto T. Nagamine T. Sampath T.K. ten Dijke P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), Xenopus embryo (23.Nakayama T. Gardner H. Berg L.K. Christian J.L. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and Mink lung epithelial (Mv1Lu) cells (24.Itoh S. Landstrom M. Hermansson A. Itoh F. Heldin C.H. Heldin N.E. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29195-29201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The interaction of Smad6 with Hoxc-8 suggests that Smad6 may have a novel antagonistic function in the nucleus. The interaction was assayed in liquid culture of mutant yeast strain Y190, which requires His, Leu, and Trp to grow. pGBT9-Hox c-8 and pACT2-Smad6 plasmids carry Trp and Leu as their selective markers, respectively. The interaction between Smad6 and Hoxc-8 enables the yeast to synthesize His and induces β-gal expression. The arbitrary units of β-gal activities for yeast bearing different plasmids were plotted as shown. The initial Smad6 cDNA clone (Smad6C in Table 1) encodes amino acids 281 to 496 of a 496-amino acid protein. The interaction between Hoxc-8 and Smad6 was further confirmed with a β-gal filter lift assay (data not shown) and quantified by a liquid β-gal assay (Table 1). When the full length of Smad6 fused with the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain was tested in the two-hybrid system, it showed a weaker interaction with Hoxc-8 in comparison with the carboxyl-terminal domain (Smad6C). Deletion of the Smad6 amino-terminal domain may change the protein conformation in a way that the carboxyl-terminal region becomes easier to interact with Hoxc-8. The assays of both empty bait vector (pGBT9) with Smad6C or Smad6 full-length cDNAs in prey plasmids and empty prey vector (pACT2) with full-length Hoxc-8 in bait vector showed very little activity. Compared with the interaction between Smad1 and Hoxc-8, the interaction of Smad6 with Hoxc-8 is about 5 times stronger (Table 1). To investigate the interaction of Smad6 with Hoxc-8 in mammalian cells and the effect of BMP stimulation on this interaction, COS-1 cells were transiently co-transfected with expression plasmids for FLAG-Smad6, HA-Hoxc-8, and/or constitutively active BMP type IA receptor ALK3 (Q233D). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. The results represented in Fig. 1 demonstrate that Smad6 (see Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8) was co-immunoprecipitated with HA-Hoxc-8. BMP induces Smad6 mRNA expression (25.Afrakhte M. Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Heldin N.E. ten Dijke P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 26.Takase M. Imamura T. Sampath T.K. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 26-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and overexpression of ALK3 (Q233D) did not significantly change the interaction of Smad6 with Hoxc-8 (lane 8), indicating that BMP stimulation is not required for the interaction between Smad6 and Hoxc-8. Our initial Smad6 clone only encodes the carboxyl-terminal domain, indicating that this region of the protein may be involved in the interaction with Hoxc-8. To further investigate this observation, two FLAG-tagged Smad6 truncation expression plasmids were constructed. As shown in Fig.1, Smad6C exhibits a strong interaction with Hoxc-8 (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, the Smad6 amino-terminal with the linker region (Smad6NL) failed to bind to Hoxc-8 in immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 1, lane 6). Smad proteins contain highly conserved amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains (referred to as MH1 and MH2 domains, respectively). The MH1 domain inhibits biological activities of the MH2 domain because of interactions between these two distal sites (27.Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Like other regulatory Smads, Smad6 also contains a conserved MH2 domain and short segments of MH1 domain homology (28.Newfeld S.J. Wisotzkey R.G. Kumar S. Genetics. 1999; 152: 783-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, our results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal domain of Smad6 interacts with Hoxc-8 and that the amino terminus negatively regulates interaction between the two proteins. We examined the effect of the interaction between Hoxc-8 and Smad6 on Hoxc-8 DNA binding activity. Gel shift assays were performed with purified GST-Smad6 and GST-Hoxc-8 fusion proteins using osteopontin Hoxc-8 DNA binding element as a probe. As expected, Hoxc-8 protein binds to the DNA probe, which is inhibited by Smad1 (Fig.2 a, lanes 5 and6). Smad6 alone did not bind to the DNA element (lane 4). Interestingly, Incubation of both Hoxc-8 and Smad6 proteins yields a distinct shifted band with a molecular weight higher than Hoxc-8 binding alone, indicating that Hoxc-8 and Smad6 bind to the DNA element as a complex (lane 7). More importantly, the formation of the Smad6-Hoxc-8 complex eliminated the inhibitory effects of Smad1 on Hoxc-8 DNA binding (lane 8). Yeast two-hybrid assays already demonstrated that the interaction between Hoxc-8 and Smad6 is much stronger than that between Hoxc-8 and Smad1 (Table 1). Hox proteins have been demonstrated to interact with Smad1, but not Smad2 and -3, in response to BMP stimulation (8.Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To examine whether the interaction between Smad6 and Hoxc-8 is also specifically involved in the BMP signaling pathway, Smad7 was tested for its interaction with Hox proteins (Fig. 2 b). Like Smad2 and -3, Smad7 did not interact with either Hoxc-8 or Hoxa-9 (Fig. 2 b, lanes 4, 7, and 10). Considering Smad6 as only interacting with phosphorylated Smad1 in the cytoplasm (14.Hata A. Lagna G. Massague J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), our results also suggest that Smad6 be preferentially involved in BMP signaling. Smad4, the common partner for all receptor-regulated Smads and interaction with Hoxc-8, was examined for the same purpose (Fig.2 c). In comparison with Smad1, the complex of Smad6 and Hoxc-8 did not block the interaction of Smad4 with Hoxc-8 completely (Fig. 2 c, lanes 7 and 9). In fact, Smad4 can only be passively translocated into the nucleus by forming hetero-oligomers with any of the receptor-regulated Smads (29.Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J.

Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the Smad1-Hoxc-8 interaction domain linked to a nuclear localization signal (Smad1B) stimulates BMP downstream gene expression and induces osteoblast differentiation from osteogenic cells (8.Shi X.M. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 30.Yang X. Ji X. Shi X. Cao X. J. Biol.

When the BMP-inducible construct (Hox-pGL3) was co-transfected in Mv1Lu cells with the Smad1B expression plasmid, the luciferase activity was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 a). This model provides an ideal assay to directly examine the Smad6 antagonistic function in the nucleus. Because Smad1B mimics BMP-induced gene transcription without BMP receptor phosphorylation involving and interaction with Smad6 of Smad1 (13.Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J.

Hox-pGL3 construct was co-transfected in Mv1Lu cells with Hoxc-8 and/or Smad6 expression plasmid. As shown in Fig. 3 b, overexpression of Hoxc-8 or Smad6 alone moderately inhibited Smad1B-induced transcription activity. Most importantly, co-transfection of both Hoxc-8 and Smad6 plasmids completely abolished the Smad1B-induced luciferase activity. To validate this observation, we transfected Mv1Lu cells with a mutated construct, mHox-pGL3, in which the core nucleotides of the Hoxc-8 binding site were mutated from TAAT to GCCG. Transfection of the mutant construct dramatically reduced Smad1B-induced reporter activity. As expected, the inhibition mediated by co-transfection of Smad6 and Hoxc-8 was also reduced (Fig.3 c). Finally, protein localization analysis demonstrated that both Smad6 and Hoxc-8 are highly expressed in the nucleus (Fig. 3 d). Differing from Smad7, Smad6 nuclear exportation was not induced with BMP-4. Taken together with immunocoprecipitation of Smad6 with Hoxc-8 and formation of the Smad6-Hoxc-8 complex in gel shift assays, these data suggest co-localization of Smad6 and Hoxc-8 in the nucleus. Thus, our results are the first to demonstrate that Smad6 has an antagonistic function toward BMP signaling in the nucleus in addition to its interaction with BMP type I receptor and Smad1 in the cytoplasm.

Here, we implicate A subfamily ephrins in this topographic mapping. First, developing muscles express all five of the ephrin-A genes. Second, rostrally and caudally derived motor axons differ in sensitivity to outgrowth inhibition by ephrin-A5. Third, the topographic map of motor axons on the gluteus muscle is degraded in transgenic mice that overexpress ephrin-A5 in muscles. Fourth, topographic mapping is impaired in muscles of mutant mice lacking ephrin-A2 plus ephrin-A5. Thus, ephrins mediate or modulate positionally selective synapse formation. In addition, the rostrocaudal position of at least one motor pool is altered in ephrin-A5 mutant mice, indicating that ephrins affect nerve–muscle matching by intraspinal as well as intramuscular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2036337401,"Synchronous activity among synaptically connected interneurons is thought to organize temporal patterns such as gamma and theta rhythms in cortical circuits. Interactions between distinct interneuron circuits may underlie more complex patterns, such as nested rhythms. Here, we demonstrate such an interaction between two groups of CA1 interneurons, GABAA,slow and GABAA,fast cells, that may contribute to theta and gamma rhythms, respectively. Stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SL-M) stimuli that activate GABAA,slow inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in pyramidal cells simultaneously depress the rate and amplitude of spontaneous GABAA,fast IPSCs for several hundred milliseconds. This suppression has a similar pharmacological profile to GABAA,slow IPSCs, and SL-M stimuli elicit GABAA,slow IPSCs in interneurons. We conclude that GABAA,slow cells inhibit both pyramidal cells and GABAA,fast interneurons and postulate that this interaction contributes to nested theta/gamma rhythms in hippocampus."

How and where changes in the structure of the voltage-sensing domains couple to the pore domain so as to gate ion conduction is not understood. The crystal structure of KcsA, a bacterial K+ channel homologous to the pore domain of voltage-gated K+ channels, provides a starting point for addressing this question. Guided by this structure, we used tryptophan-scanning mutagenesis on the transmembrane shell of the pore domain in the Shaker voltage-gated K+ channel to localize potential protein-protein and protein-lipid interfaces. Some mutants cause only minor changes in gating and when mapped onto the KcsA structure cluster away from the interface between pore domain subunits. In contrast, mutants producing large changes in gating tend to cluster near this interface. These results imply that voltage-sensing domains interact with localized regions near the interface between adjacent pore domain subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2041571676,"In the primary visual cortex of macaque monkeys, laminar and columnar axonal specificity are correlated with functional differences between locations. We describe evidence that embedded within this anatomical framework is finer specificity of functional connections. Photostimulation-based mapping of functional input to 31 layer 3B neurons revealed that input sources to individual cells were highly diverse. Although some input differences were correlated with neuronal anatomy, no 2 neurons received excitatory input from the same cortical layers. Thus, input diversity reveals far more cell types than does anatomical diversity. This implies relatively little functional redundancy; despite trends related to laminar or columnar position, pools of neurons contributing uniquely to visual processing are likely relatively small. These results also imply that similarities in the anatomy of circuits in different cortical areas or species may not indicate similar functional connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2063373327,"The Galileo orbiter's close pass by Io in 1995 produced evidence for extensive mass loading of the plasma torus through the ionization of SO2. On 11 October 1999, Galileo passed even closer to Io, this time across the upstream side relative to the flow of magnetospheric plasma that corotates with Jupiter. On the first flyby, ion cyclotron waves gave direct evidence for the production of SO2+ ions. On the second flyby, ion cyclotron waves associated with SO+ were stronger and more persistent. Moreover, SO+ emissions were seen closer to Io than SO2+ emissions, suggesting that the exosphere was spatially inhomogeneous. The location of the waves suggests a fan-shaped region of ion pickup extending in the anti-Jupiter direction. Because the wave spectra were different even where the 1995 and 1999 trajectories crossed, we infer that Io's exosphere is temporally variable."
https://openalex.org/W1979065624,"A number of second messenger pathways propagate inductive signals via protein-protein interactions that are phosphorylation-dependent. The second messenger, cAMP, for example, promotes cellular gene expression via the protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) at Ser133, and this modification in turn stimulates the association of CREB with the co-activator, CREB-binding protein (CBP). The solution structure of the CREB·CBP complex, using relevant interaction domains, kinase inducible domain and kinase-induced domain interacting domain, referred to as KID and KIX, respectively, shows that KID undergoes a coil to helix transition, upon binding to KIX, that stabilizes complex formation.

By contrast, the kinase inducible domain (KID) stimulates target gene expression, following its phosphorylation at Ser133, by associating with the KIX domain of the co-activator CBP (5.Arias J.

The solution structure of the KID·KIX complex reveals that Ser133-phosphorylated KID undergoes a random coil to helix transition upon complex formation with KIX, and this transition in turn stabilizes the interaction between CREB and CBP and its paralog P300 (8.Radhakrishnan I.

However, these pathways are unable to promote target gene expression via CREB per se, reflecting a block either in recruitment of CBP or in the subsequent assembly of the transcriptional apparatus (10.Brindle P. Nakajima T. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10521-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).A number of methodologies, including co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), have been employed to evaluate protein-protein interactions (15.Zhou G. Cummings R. Li Y. Mitra S. Wilkinson H.A. Elbrecht A. Hermes J.D. Schaeffer J.M. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1594-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Such procedures are limited by technical manipulations, such as protein extraction (co-IP) or over-expression (FRET), that may influence the recovery or detection of protein complexes.Here we employ a novel complex-specific antiserum to monitor the CREB·CBP interaction following exposure to various stimuli. Immunocytochemical experiments reveal that CREB·CBP complex formation, in response to cAMP, is limited to discrete compartments within the nucleus. Remarkably, other stimuli were found to have distinct effects on complex formation, even in light of comparable potency at the level of Ser133 phosphorylation. Our results illustrate a novel mechanism for signal discrimination in the nucleus at the level of co-activator recruitment.RESULTSTo evaluate CREB·CBP complex formation in vivo, we developed a complex-specific antiserum using glutaraldehyde cross-linked phospho-(Ser133) KID·KIX complexes as immunogen. αKK antiserum was initially purified from crude serum of immunized rabbits by chromatography over separate KID and KIX resins to remove antibodies that could recognize either phospho-(Ser133) KID or KIX peptides independently (Fig.1 A). Flow-through fractions from these columns were then passed over resin containing cross-linked KID·KIX peptides, and the bound antibody fraction, referred to as αKK antiserum, was acid eluted.In Western blot assays, αKK antiserum could recognize cross-linked KID·KIX complexes but not KIX or phospho-(Ser133) KID peptides alone (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with the notion that αKK antiserum is also competent to detect complex formation between full-length phospho-(Ser133) CREB and CBP/P300 proteins, P300 was recovered from immunoprecipitates of recombinant P300 and phospho-(Ser133) CREB but not of P300 plus unphosphorylated CREB (Fig. 1 C, top panel). αKK antiserum also detected the phospho-(Ser133)-dependent recruitment of CBP in immunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating the capacity of this antiserum to recognize complexes formed with both co-activators (Fig. 1 C, bottom panel).The KID domain is highly conserved among CREB family members, particularly in residues that function in protein-protein interactions with KIX (8.Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). In gel mobility shift assays, for example, αKK antiserum was also capable of binding to KIX complexes formed with the mammalian CREB homolog, CREM, but not with the more distantly relatedCaenorhabditis elegans CREB polypeptide (eCREB) 2M. Montminy, manuscript in preparation. (Fig.2 A). Compared with its mammalian counterpart, eCREB contains a number of amino acid substitutions within its KID domain (amino acids 40–65) (Fig.2 B), prompting us to evaluate which of these constituted an important epitope for αKK recognition.Figure 2CREB·CBP-specific antiserum recognizes a conformational change in CREB that accompanies complex formation.

Mutation of residues 127 and 129 (M2) or 136 and 139 (M3) in KID partially disrupted interaction with KIX by gel shift assay (Fig. 2, Band C; compare WT, M2, andM3). Although these residues do not appear to form surface contacts with KIX (8.Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), mutation at these amino acids may impose structural constraints on the mutant KID peptides that make complex formation less favorable. Nevertheless, complexes formed with mutant M2 KID were supershifted by αKK antiserum, but complexes formed with mutant M3 KID containing Lys136 → Met and Asn139 → Lys substitutions in the αB region were not (Fig. 2 C; compare WT, M2, andM3). Taken together, these results indicate that residues Lys136 and Asn139 are critical for recognition by αKK antiserum.Lys136 and Asn139 are directly aligned on the solvent face of helix αB, a region in KID that undergoes a random coil to helix transition upon complex formation with KIX (Fig.2 D). The importance of these residues for recognition by αKK suggests that the antiserum detects, in part, the conformational change in KID that accompanies complex formation with KIX. Moreover, the ability of αKK to recognize full-length CREB·CBP complexes suggests that the structural change detected by NMR analysis with KID and KIX peptides also occurs in the context of the full-length proteins.In addition to cAMP, other stimuli such as the phorbol ester TPA can promote Ser133 phosphorylation of CREB, yet these stimuli are unable to induce target gene activation via CBP, reflecting a block either in CREB·CBP complex formation or in the subsequent recruitment of the transcriptional apparatus. To evaluate formation of CREB·CBP complexes in vivo, we employed NIH 3T3 cells expressing chromosomal copies of the rat somatostatin gene, hereafter referred to as D5 cells (17.Montminy M.R. Low M.J. Tapia-Arancibia L. Reichlin S. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 803-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treating D5 cells with TPA induced Ser133phosphorylation of CREB with comparable stoichiometry to forskolin by Western blot assay with phospho-specific CREB antiserum 5322 (Fig.3 A). Forskolin stimulated somatostatin mRNA accumulation 5-fold in D5 cells, whereas TPA had no discernible effect (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Signal discrimination at the level of CREB· CBP complex formation. The effect of TPA and forskolin on signaling and target gene activation via CREB is shown.A , Western blot assay of total CREB and phospho-(Ser133) CREB (P-CREB) levels in control (C) or treated D5 cells exposed to either forskolin (F) or TPA (T), as indicated, for 30 min.B, Northern blot assay of somatostatin (SOM) and tubulin (TUB) mRNA levels in control D5 cells (C) and in D5 cells treated with forskolin (F) or TPA (T) for 4 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Consistent with the absence of phospho-(Ser133) CREB staining under basal conditions, no CREB·CBP complexes were detected in untreated D5 cells by immunofluorescence analysis with αKK antiserum (Fig. 4). Treatment with forskolin induced accumulation of phospho-(Ser133) CREB and correspondingly promoted the appearance of CREB·CBP complexes (Fig.4 A). By contrast with forskolin, however, no CREB·CBP complexes were detected in TPA-treated cells despite comparable levels of Ser133 phosphorylation.Figure 4cAMP stimulates the formation of CREB· CBP complexes in situ.

Tafuri A. Gass P. Hammerling G. Arnold B. Schütz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Compared with cells from wild-type littermates, which showed abundant nuclear staining following treatment with cAMP agonist, only background cytoplasmic staining was observed in CREB −/− cells (Fig. 4 B). These results demonstrate that CREB is indeed an important epitope for recognition by αKK antibody. Under higher magnification, a punctate staining pattern was noted with αKK antiserum in forskolin-stimulated cells, suggesting that CREB·CBP complexes are formed in discrete loci within the nucleus (Fig. 4 C).DISCUSSIONOur results illustrate a novel approach to the study of cellular signaling; to our knowledge, this is the first report documenting the formation of nuclear protein-protein complexes in situ. αKK antiserum binds in part to residues in KID that undergo a conformational change following complex formation with KIX. The ability of αKK antiserum to recognize full-length CREB·CBP complexes strongly supports the notion that this helical transition also occurs within the context of the full-length CREB protein. Structural transitions in transcription activators like CREB may therefore be integral to the process of recruiting the transcriptional machinery.Other complex-specific antisera have been described, most notably against human immunodeficiency virus gp120 bound to its cellular receptor, CD4 (19.Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar, 20.Lee S. Peden K. Dimitrov D.S. Broder C.C. Manischewitz J.

Virology. 1995; 211: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). gp120 appears to undergo a conformational change, upon binding to CD4, that exposes an epitope for recognition by complex-specific antiserum. Indeed, a number of proteins appear to undergo structural changes upon complex formation with their cognate receptor or co-activator (22.Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), suggesting that the development of complex-specific antisera may be generally useful for studies of cellular signaling.CREB·CBP complexes appear to be formed at discrete regions within the nucleus. Although the constituents of these speckles are unknown aside from CREB and CBP, it is tempting to speculate that they may contain other components of the transcriptional apparatus. In this regard, CBP has been found to associate with RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complexes (23.Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S. Parvin J. Montminy M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 24.McKenna N. Nawaz Z. Tsai S. Tsai M. O'Malley B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5355-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) as well as promyelocytic protein-containing nuclear bodies (26.LaMorte V.J. Dyck J.A. Ochs R. Evans R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4991-4996Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Further analyses with appropriate antisera may reveal which of these complexes is recruited to CREB in response to cAMP but not other signaling pathways.The ability of αKK antiserum to distinguish between different signaling pathways demonstrates the utility of this reagent in monitoring cellular activity compared with phospho-(Ser133) CREB antiserum. PhosphoCREB-specific antisera have been widely used, particularly in neuronal cells, to evaluate cellular responses to various stimuli. Our data suggest that some subset of these signals may not elicit a transcriptional response, at least via the same pathway as cAMP.Phosphorylation of CREB in response to TPA is likely to be indirect and likely to involve extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and pp90RSK. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway may inhibit CREB·CBP complex formation by inducing phosphorylation of CREB at other inhibitory sites. In this regard, phosphorylation of CREB at Ser142 has been shown to block target gene activation in part by blocking CREB·CBP complex formation (9.Parker D. Jhala U. Radhakrishnan I. Yaffe M. Reyes C. Shulman A. Cantley L. Wright P. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 353-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 27.Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P. Maurer R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to determine the mechanism by which CREB discriminates between cAMP and other second messenger pathways. A number of signaling pathways modulate cellular gene expression via the phosphorylation of specific nuclear factors. The second messenger, cAMP, for example, promotes target gene expression via the phosphorylation of CREB1 at Ser133 (1.Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation appears to enhance the nuclear import, multimerization, or DNA binding activities of certain factors, CREB belongs to a group of activators whose trans-activation potential is specifically affected (2.Brindle P. Linke S. Montminy M. Nature. 1993; 364: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The CREB trans-activation domain is bipartite, consisting of constitutive and inducible activators that function synergistically in response to cAMP stimulation (2.Brindle P. Linke S. Montminy M. Nature. 1993; 364: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 3.Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16999-17009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Mutation of residues 127 and 129 (M2) or 136 and 139 (M3) in KID partially disrupted interaction with KIX by gel shift assay (Fig. 2, Band C; compare WT, M2, andM3). Although these residues do not appear to form surface contacts with KIX (8.Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M. Wright P.E.

Nevertheless, complexes formed with mutant M2 KID were supershifted by αKK antiserum, but complexes formed with mutant M3 KID containing Lys136 → Met and Asn139 → Lys substitutions in the αB region were not (Fig. 2 C; compare WT, M2, andM3). Taken together, these results indicate that residues Lys136 and Asn139 are critical for recognition by αKK antiserum.Lys136 and Asn139 are directly aligned on the solvent face of helix αB, a region in KID that undergoes a random coil to helix transition upon complex formation with KIX (Fig.2 D).

Tafuri A. Gass P. Hammerling G. Arnold B. Schütz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Compared with cells from wild-type littermates, which showed abundant nuclear staining following treatment with cAMP agonist, only background cytoplasmic staining was observed in CREB −/− cells (Fig. 4 B). These results demonstrate that CREB is indeed an important epitope for recognition by αKK antibody. Under higher magnification, a punctate staining pattern was noted with αKK antiserum in forskolin-stimulated cells, suggesting that CREB·CBP complexes are formed in discrete loci within the nucleus (Fig. 4 C). To evaluate CREB·CBP complex formation in vivo, we developed a complex-specific antiserum using glutaraldehyde cross-linked phospho-(Ser133) KID·KIX complexes as immunogen. αKK antiserum was initially purified from crude serum of immunized rabbits by chromatography over separate KID and KIX resins to remove antibodies that could recognize either phospho-(Ser133) KID or KIX peptides independently (Fig.1 A). Flow-through fractions from these columns were then passed over resin containing cross-linked KID·KIX peptides, and the bound antibody fraction, referred to as αKK antiserum, was acid eluted. In Western blot assays, αKK antiserum could recognize cross-linked KID·KIX complexes but not KIX or phospho-(Ser133) KID peptides alone (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with the notion that αKK antiserum is also competent to detect complex formation between full-length phospho-(Ser133) CREB and CBP/P300 proteins, P300 was recovered from immunoprecipitates of recombinant P300 and phospho-(Ser133) CREB but not of P300 plus unphosphorylated CREB (Fig. 1 C, top panel). αKK antiserum also detected the phospho-(Ser133)-dependent recruitment of CBP in immunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating the capacity of this antiserum to recognize complexes formed with both co-activators (Fig. 1 C, bottom panel). The KID domain is highly conserved among CREB family members, particularly in residues that function in protein-protein interactions with KIX (8.Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). In gel mobility shift assays, for example, αKK antiserum was also capable of binding to KIX complexes formed with the mammalian CREB homolog, CREM, but not with the more distantly relatedCaenorhabditis elegans CREB polypeptide (eCREB) 2M. Montminy, manuscript in preparation. (Fig.2 A). Compared with its mammalian counterpart, eCREB contains a number of amino acid substitutions within its KID domain (amino acids 40–65) (Fig.2 B), prompting us to evaluate which of these constituted an important epitope for αKK recognition. Mutation of residues 121–123 (M1) in the αA region of rat CREB (amino acids 121–129) to corresponding amino acids of C. elegans CREB had no effect on either complex formation with KIX or recognition by αKK by gel shift assay (Fig. 2, B andC; compare WT and M1). Mutation of residues 127 and 129 (M2) or 136 and 139 (M3) in KID partially disrupted interaction with KIX by gel shift assay (Fig. 2, Band C; compare WT, M2, andM3). Although these residues do not appear to form surface contacts with KIX (8.Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), mutation at these amino acids may impose structural constraints on the mutant KID peptides that make complex formation less favorable. Nevertheless, complexes formed with mutant M2 KID were supershifted by αKK antiserum, but complexes formed with mutant M3 KID containing Lys136 → Met and Asn139 → Lys substitutions in the αB region were not (Fig. 2 C; compare WT, M2, andM3). Taken together, these results indicate that residues Lys136 and Asn139 are critical for recognition by αKK antiserum. Lys136 and Asn139 are directly aligned on the solvent face of helix αB, a region in KID that undergoes a random coil to helix transition upon complex formation with KIX (Fig.2 D). The importance of these residues for recognition by αKK suggests that the antiserum detects, in part, the conformational change in KID that accompanies complex formation with KIX. Moreover, the ability of αKK to recognize full-length CREB·CBP complexes suggests that the structural change detected by NMR analysis with KID and KIX peptides also occurs in the context of the full-length proteins. In addition to cAMP, other stimuli such as the phorbol ester TPA can promote Ser133 phosphorylation of CREB, yet these stimuli are unable to induce target gene activation via CBP, reflecting a block either in CREB·CBP complex formation or in the subsequent recruitment of the transcriptional apparatus. To evaluate formation of CREB·CBP complexes in vivo, we employed NIH 3T3 cells expressing chromosomal copies of the rat somatostatin gene, hereafter referred to as D5 cells (17.Montminy M.R. Low M.J. Tapia-Arancibia L. Reichlin S. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 803-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treating D5 cells with TPA induced Ser133phosphorylation of CREB with comparable stoichiometry to forskolin by Western blot assay with phospho-specific CREB antiserum 5322 (Fig.3 A). Forskolin stimulated somatostatin mRNA accumulation 5-fold in D5 cells, whereas TPA had no discernible effect (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with the absence of phospho-(Ser133) CREB staining under basal conditions, no CREB·CBP complexes were detected in untreated D5 cells by immunofluorescence analysis with αKK antiserum (Fig. 4). Treatment with forskolin induced accumulation of phospho-(Ser133) CREB and correspondingly promoted the appearance of CREB·CBP complexes (Fig.4 A). By contrast with forskolin, however, no CREB·CBP complexes were detected in TPA-treated cells despite comparable levels of Ser133 phosphorylation. To confirm the specificity of the αKK antiserum, we employed fibroblasts from CREB −/− mice (18.Rudolph D. Tafuri A. Gass P. Hammerling G. Arnold B. Schütz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Compared with cells from wild-type littermates, which showed abundant nuclear staining following treatment with cAMP agonist, only background cytoplasmic staining was observed in CREB −/− cells (Fig. 4 B). These results demonstrate that CREB is indeed an important epitope for recognition by αKK antibody. Under higher magnification, a punctate staining pattern was noted with αKK antiserum in forskolin-stimulated cells, suggesting that CREB·CBP complexes are formed in discrete loci within the nucleus (Fig. 4 C). DISCUSSIONOur results illustrate a novel approach to the study of cellular signaling; to our knowledge, this is the first report documenting the formation of nuclear protein-protein complexes in situ. αKK antiserum binds in part to residues in KID that undergo a conformational change following complex formation with KIX. The ability of αKK antiserum to recognize full-length CREB·CBP complexes strongly supports the notion that this helical transition also occurs within the context of the full-length CREB protein. Structural transitions in transcription activators like CREB may therefore be integral to the process of recruiting the transcriptional machinery.Other complex-specific antisera have been described, most notably against human immunodeficiency virus gp120 bound to its cellular receptor, CD4 (19.Kwong P.D.

Virology. 1995; 211: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). gp120 appears to undergo a conformational change, upon binding to CD4, that exposes an epitope for recognition by complex-specific antiserum. Indeed, a number of proteins appear to undergo structural changes upon complex formation with their cognate receptor or co-activator (22.Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), suggesting that the development of complex-specific antisera may be generally useful for studies of cellular signaling.CREB·CBP complexes appear to be formed at discrete regions within the nucleus. Although the constituents of these speckles are unknown aside from CREB and CBP, it is tempting to speculate that they may contain other components of the transcriptional apparatus. In this regard, CBP has been found to associate with RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complexes (23.Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S. Parvin J. Montminy M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 24.McKenna N. Nawaz Z. Tsai S. Tsai M. O'Malley B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Further analyses with appropriate antisera may reveal which of these complexes is recruited to CREB in response to cAMP but not other signaling pathways.The ability of αKK antiserum to distinguish between different signaling pathways demonstrates the utility of this reagent in monitoring cellular activity compared with phospho-(Ser133) CREB antiserum. PhosphoCREB-specific antisera have been widely used, particularly in neuronal cells, to evaluate cellular responses to various stimuli. Our data suggest that some subset of these signals may not elicit a transcriptional response, at least via the same pathway as cAMP.Phosphorylation of CREB in response to TPA is likely to be indirect and likely to involve extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and pp90RSK. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway may inhibit CREB·CBP complex formation by inducing phosphorylation of CREB at other inhibitory sites. In this regard, phosphorylation of CREB at Ser142 has been shown to block target gene activation in part by blocking CREB·CBP complex formation (9.Parker D. Jhala U. Radhakrishnan I. Yaffe M.
