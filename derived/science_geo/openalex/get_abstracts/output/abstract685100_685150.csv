We have generated dense single-cell and spatial reference maps of the human uterus and three-dimensional endometrial organoid cultures. We dissect the signaling pathways that determine cell fate of the epithelial lineages in the lumenal and glandular microenvironments. Our benchmark of the endometrial organoids reveals the pathways and cell states regulating differentiation of the secretory and ciliated lineages both in vivo and in vitro. In vitro downregulation of WNT or NOTCH pathways increases the differentiation efficiency along the secretory and ciliated lineages, respectively. We utilize our cellular maps to deconvolute bulk data from endometrial cancers and endometriotic lesions, illuminating the cell types dominating in each of these disorders. These mechanistic insights provide a platform for future development of treatments for common conditions including endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W3217061287,"One week after fertilization, human embryos implant into the uterus. This event requires the embryo to form a blastocyst consisting of a sphere encircling a cavity lodging the embryo proper. Stem cells can form a blastocyst model that we called a blastoid1. Here we show that naive human pluripotent stem cells cultured in PXGL medium2 and triply inhibited for the Hippo, TGF-β and ERK pathways efficiently (with more than 70% efficiency) form blastoids generating blastocyst-stage analogues of the three founding lineages (more than 97% trophectoderm, epiblast and primitive endoderm) according to the sequence and timing of blastocyst development. Blastoids spontaneously form the first axis, and we observe that the epiblast induces the local maturation of the polar trophectoderm, thereby endowing blastoids with the capacity to directionally attach to hormonally stimulated endometrial cells, as during implantation. Thus, we propose that such a human blastoid is a faithful, scalable and ethical model for investigating human implantation and development3,4."

We developed an organoid assembly approach starting with cells from the three primary germ layers—enteric neuroglial, mesenchymal, and epithelial precursors—that were derived separately from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). From these three cell types, we generated human antral and fundic gastric tissue containing differentiated glands surrounded by layers of smooth muscle containing functional enteric neurons that controlled contractions of the engineered antral tissue. Using this experimental system, we show that human enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) promote mesenchyme development and glandular morphogenesis of antral stomach organoids. Moreover, ENCCs can act directly on the foregut to promote a posterior fate, resulting in organoids with a Brunner’s gland phenotype.

All organs of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are assembled from cells derived from the three primary germ layers during embryonic development. These diverse cell types are required for proper execution of the GI tract’s complex functions. For example, the key functions of the stomach to chemically and mechanically break down orally ingested nutrients depend on a complex interaction of the epithelium to produce acid and proteases (Furness et al., 2020Furness J.B.

These three main components of the stomach develop separately from the three primary germ layers but then assemble into a tissue that is functional by birth, with the endoderm forming the epithelial lining, the mesoderm contributing to stromal cells and smooth muscle layers, and the ectoderm giving rise to the enteric nervous system (ENS). During organ development, the ENS, mesenchyme, and epithelium communicate with each other to regulate regional identity, assembly, morphogenesis, and differentiation into specific cell types (Le Guen et al., 2015Le Guen L. Marchal S. Faure S. de Santa Barbara P. Mesenchymal-epithelial interactions during digestive tract development and epithelial stem cell regeneration.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2015; 72: 3883-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For example, neural progenitors of the ENS, enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs), migrate to the foregut in response to signals from the surrounding mesenchyme as this mesenchyme is differentiating into multiple organized layers of smooth muscle. Reciprocal signaling between germ layers is observed across species. For example, sonic hedgehog (Shh) is secreted by the epithelium of several GI organs and regulates expression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) in adjacent mesenchyme. BMP activation in the hindgut promotes posterior mesenchyme patterning (Roberts et al., 1995Roberts D.J. Johnson R.L. Burke A.C. Nelson C.E. Morgan B.A. Tabin C.

Epithelial Shh is also known to indirectly regulate ENCC proliferation and differentiation through manipulation of key extracellular matrix proteins within the gut mesenchyme (Nagy et al., 2016Nagy N. Barad C. Graham H.K. Hotta R. Cheng L.S. Fejszak N. Goldstein A.M.

Reciprocal signaling from ENCCs regulate the growth, pattering, and maturation of developing stomach mesenchyme (Faure et al., 2015Faure S. McKey J. Sagnol S. de Santa Barbara P. Enteric neural crest cells regulate vertebrate stomach patterning and differentiation.Development. 2015; 142: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Finally, epithelial Shh-induced BMP signaling and ENCC-produced BMP antagonists work in concert to regulate the radial position of the gut’s smooth muscle layers (Huycke et al., 2019Huycke T.R. Miller B.M. Gill H.K. Nerurkar N.L. Sprinzak D. Mahadevan L. Tabin C.J.

Congenital and acquired disorders of the proximal GI tract include esophageal atresia, gastroparesis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which can arise from improper epithelial, ENS, or smooth muscle development (Westfal and Goldstein, 2017Westfal M.L.

Although animal models have been invaluable to study gastroesophageal development and disease (de Santa Barbara et al., 2002de Santa Barbara P. van den Brink G.R. Roberts D.J. Molecular etiology of gut malformations and diseases.Am. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 115: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), there are major structural and functional differences in this organ between different species. For example, rodents have a forestomach that does not exist in humans. The avian stomach contains a proventriculus, a proximal glandular compartment somewhat paralleling the human fundus, and a gizzard, a more distal grinding compartment that is vastly different from the human antrum (Kim and Shivdasani, 2016Kim T.H. Shivdasani R.A. Stomach development, stem cells and disease.Development. 2016; 143: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). There are also developmental differences at the molecular level; Hedgehog signaling has different roles in development of GI smooth muscle in chick and mouse embryos (Huycke et al., 2019Huycke T.R. Miller B.M. Gill H.K. Nerurkar N.L. Sprinzak D. Mahadevan L. Tabin C.J.

Each of the existing model systems has experimental strengths and weaknesses; frog and chick embryos are easy to manipulate in vitro, and mouse embryos are a strong genetic model. However, creation of genetically tractable, complex human GI tissue models that can be manipulated in vitro could accelerate studies of development and discovery of drugs that improve gastroesophageal function. Current gastric and esophageal organoid models are limited in that they only contain epithelium (McCracken et al., 2014McCracken K.W. Catá E.M. Crawford C.M. Sinagoga K.L. Schumacher M. Rockich B.E. Tsai Y.H. Mayhew C.N. Spence J.R. Zavros Y. Wells J.M.

We reasoned that we could engineer added complexity into gastroesophageal organoids by incorporating progenitor cells from the other 2 germ layers in vitro. By so doing, we could construct a more complex organoid and study human organ development in a way not possible previously. In this study, we incorporated human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived splanchnic mesenchyme and ENCCs into developing human antral and fundic gastric organoids (hAGOs and hFGOs, respectively) to recapitulate normal gastric development. The resulting gastric organoids were composed of epithelial glands surrounded by multiple layers of functionally innervated smooth muscle. The technology was readily transferrable to other types of organoids and used to engineer esophageal organoids containing all 3 germ layers. The tractability of this approach allowed us to study germ layer communication during stomach development. We found that human ENCCs promote gastric mesenchymal development and glandular morphogenesis and that the presence of an adequate amount of gastric mesenchyme is essential for maintaining gastric regional identity. One of the first and most critical steps in GI development is assembly of epithelium and mesenchyme into a primitive gut tube. Although PSC-derived human gastric organoids have a full complement of epithelial cell types (McCracken et al., 2014McCracken K.W. Catá E.M. Crawford C.M. Sinagoga K.L. Schumacher M. Rockich B.E. Tsai Y.H. Mayhew C.N. Spence J.R. Zavros Y. Wells J.M.

Wnt/β-catenin promotes gastric fundus specification in mice and humans.Nature. 2017; 541: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), they do not intrinsically develop a robust mesenchyme. To develop an approach to generate GI mesenchyme, we used a method identified recently to direct differentiation of hPSCs into splanchnic mesenchyme (SM), the source of gastric mesenchyme (Han et al., 2020Han L. Chaturvedi P. Kishimoto K. Koike H. Nasr T. Iwasawa K. Giesbrecht K. Witcher P.C. Eicher A. Haines L. et al.Single cell transcriptomics identifies a signaling network coordinating endoderm and mesoderm diversification during foregut organogenesis.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This method was based on the signaling pathways that drive normal development of GI mesenchyme in the mouse. Briefly, hPSCs were differentiated into lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) with transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) inhibition, Wingless/Integrated (WNT) inhibition, and BMP activation, as described previously (Figure 1A; Han et al., 2020Han L. Chaturvedi P. Kishimoto K. Koike H. Nasr T. Iwasawa K. Giesbrecht K. Witcher P.C. Eicher A.

Because LPM can give rise to cardiac mesenchyme and SM, the LPM was treated with retinoic acid (RA) to induce a SM fate, resulting in loss of cardiac markers like ISL1 and, thus, expansion of a FOXF1+/ISL1− SM cell population (Figures 1B and 1C; Han et al., 2020Han L. Chaturvedi P. Kishimoto K. Koike H. Nasr T. Iwasawa K. Giesbrecht K. Witcher P.C. Eicher A. Haines L. et al.Single cell transcriptomics identifies a signaling network coordinating endoderm and mesoderm diversification during foregut organogenesis.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We investigated several approaches to incorporate mesenchyme into developing gastric organoids, including combining mesenchyme and epithelium at different epithelial developmental stages (i.e., at day 6 or day 9 of the hAGO protocol), testing a single-cell aggregation method versus using intact epithelial organoids and utilizing differently patterned mesenchymal populations, including SM and cardiac, septum transversum, and gastric-esophageal mesenchyme. We initially compared incorporation of varying concentrations of SM and septum transversum (STM) mesenchyme expressing GFP on day 6 and found that 50,000 cells/well at a 2:1 ratio of SM cells to foregut epithelial cells resulted in hAGO with a robust layer of mesenchyme surrounding the epithelium (Figure S1A). We then repeated this with regionally patterned gastric-esophageal mesenchyme (GEM) on day 9 of the hAGO protocol (Figures 1D and S1B). In all cases, SM formed an organized layer of GFP+ mesenchymal cells expressing the early SM marker FOXF1 surrounding the gastric epithelium (Figure 1D). Between a third to a half of all cells in hAGO+SM were mesenchyme, representing a 3- to 5-fold increase over control organoids (Figures 1E and S1C). In contrast, STM or GEM did not form a uniform layer of mesenchyme (Figure S1B), with less than a fourth of all cells being mesenchyme (Figure S1C). Finally, we observed GFP+ mesenchymal cells that expressed α-Smooth muscle actin (αSMA), suggesting potential for differentiation into smooth muscle (Figure 1F). We have shown previously that transplantation of PSC-derived intestinal and colonic organoids under the mouse kidney capsule allowed continued growth and development. To determine whether hAGOs with ENS and mesenchyme can grow and form tissue more comparable with human stomach, all organoids were transplanted into mice and grown for an additional 10–12 weeks (Table S1), and the resulting tissues were compared with sections from a 38-week fetal and adult human stomach. At the end of 4 weeks in vitro, most transplanted hAGOs (thAGOs) averaged between 1–2 mm in diameter and had a glandular epithelial morphology and a single lumen. For growth in vivo, one organoid per mouse was transplanted under the kidney capsule and grown for 8–12 weeks. Most thAGOs without added mesenchyme did not survive (∼60%), and those that did were small, containing only a simple, one-cell-layer-thick cuboidal epithelium that did not fully differentiate (Figure 2B). In contrast, thAGOs with exogenous mesenchyme had a high survival rate (100%) and grew from a few millimeters to 0.5–1.5 cm in diameter, exhibiting up to a 1,000× increase in volume in some cases. The mesenchyme differentiated into layers of poorly organized αSMA+ smooth muscle that surround a simple layer of hAGO epithelium (Figure 2B). These data suggest that incorporation of exogenous mesenchyme promotes engraftment and growth of hAGOs but does not result in normal gastric tissue with glandular units of simple columnar epithelium. Although SM improved the growth of hAGOs, the smooth muscle was poorly organized, and there was no evidence of epithelial development into glandular structures similar to human stomach. We therefore investigated whether incorporation of the ectodermally derived ENCCs, in combination with SM, might result in more normal stomach development (Figure 2A). Although there are several published protocols to derive NCC aggregates from hPSCs (Barber et al., 2019Barber K. Studer L. Fattahi F. Derivation of enteric neuron lineages from human pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Protoc. 2019; 14: 1261-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we used a protocol that allowed us to harvest migrating ENCCs (Workman et al., 2017Workman M.J. Mahe M.M. Trisno S. Poling H.M. Watson C.L. Sundaram N. Chang C.F. Schiesser J. Aubert P. Stanley E.G. et al.Engineered human pluripotent-stem-cell-derived intestinal tissues with a functional enteric nervous system.Nat.

CHD7 cooperates with PBAF to control multipotent neural crest formation.Nature. 2010; 463: 958-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) with the rationale that, in the embryo, migrating ENCCs colonize the gut. Red fluorescent protein (RFP)-expressing ENCCs were generated, harvested, and recombined with or without GFP-expressing SM with hAGO spheroids. Recombinants were grown for 4 weeks in vitro (Figures S2A and S3G) and then transplanted into mice for an additional 10–12 weeks. Although thAGO+SM and thAGO+SM+ENCCgrew to over 1 cm in diameter, only thAGO+SM+ENCC recombinants formed the stereotypic glandular structures found in the human stomach (Figures 2B, 3A, and 3 B). In addition, thAGO+SM+ENCChad distinct layers of smooth muscle that were organized like the 38-week human fetal stomach, which contains a muscularis mucosa and muscularis externa, comprising inner circular and outer longitudinal layers of smooth muscle (Figures 2B, 3A, 3B, S2E, and S2F). Quantitative comparison showed that the muscle layers of thAGO+SM+ENCCformed at a similar distance from the epithelium as the 38-week human stomach (Figures S2E and S2F). Embedded within the smooth muscle fibers was a network of enteric neurons arranged in characteristic plexuses (Figure 2B; Video S1). One plexus layer arranged in the muscularis mucosa-like muscle layer, and the other arranged in the muscularis externa-like muscle layer. The organization of different ENS layers in hAGOs is spatially similar to the neuronal plexuses of the human stomach, with ENS neurons embedded in submucosa and muscularis externa-like muscle layers. Although the thAGOs that contained all 3 germ layers were similar to the fetal stomach, they were not as architecturally mature as the adult human stomach (Figures 3A, 3B, S2E, and S2F). https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/42550e8f-8b64-438c-96ff-f5622da6fee3/mmc2.mp4Loading ...

Video corresponds to Figure 2A, bottom right panel. The epithelium of thAGO+SM+ENCCexpressed the gastric marker CLDN18 and lacked the intestinal epithelial marker CDH17 (Figure 2C; data not shown) and contained the expected antral cell types, including surface mucous cells (MUC5AC), gland mucous cells (MUC6), and endocrine cells expressing ghrelin, serotonin, histamine, and gastrin (Figures 2C and 3E). The GFP+ neurons formed a plexus-like structure that was embedded within the layers of smooth muscle. We also observed GFP+ choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)+ and dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase [TH]+) neurons. The spatial organization of the neurons relative to the epithelium in the hAGO tissue was similar to the 38-week human stomach, where they were approximately 120–160 μm away from the glands and in close proximity to endocrine cells such as ghrelin and gastrin (Figures 2C–2E). This association in vivo is important because neurotransmitters control secretion of a variety of stomach hormones, including ghrelin and gastrin (Breit et al., 2018Breit S. Kupferberg A. Rogler G. Hasler G. Vagus Nerve as Modulator of the Brain-Gut Axis in Psychiatric and Inflammatory Disorders.Front. Psychiatry. 2018; 9: 44Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). One of the most prominent domains of the human stomach is the corpus, which contains fundic (oxyntic) glands with acid-producing parietal cells and digestive enzyme-secreting chief cells. The glands are also in close proximity to enteric neurons that, along with gastric endocrine cells, help to regulate acid production. We investigated whether the 3-germ-layer recombination approach could also be used to engineer human fundic tissue with the above properties. We generated early-stage hFGOs as described previously (McCracken et al., 2017McCracken K.W. Aihara E. Martin B. Crawford C.M. Broda T. Treguier J. Zhang X. Shannon J.M. Montrose M.H. Wells J.M. Wnt/β-catenin promotes gastric fundus specification in mice and humans.Nature. 2017; 541: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and recombined them with SM and GFP+ ENCCs. After 4 weeks, we observed SM and ENCCs incorporated into hFGOs (Figure S2H), similar to hAGOs (Figures S2A–S2D) and confirmed fundic identity by the presence of ATP4B+ parietal cells and very low expression of PDX1 (Figure S2H; data not shown). We next investigated whether 3-germ-layer hFGOs engrafted under the murine kidney capsule would form more mature fundic tissues (Figure S2G). After 10–12 weeks, transplanted hFGOs (thFGOs) grew up to 1 cm in size (Figures S2C and S2G) and had a histological architecture similar to that of 38-week human fundic tissues, with glandular epithelium surrounded by multiple layers of innervated smooth muscle (Figures 3A–3D). thAGOs and thFGOs maintained their regional identity after transplantation, and the proportions of cell types that normally distinguish the human corpus/fundus from the antrum also distinguished thAGOs from thFGOs. Specifically, thAGOs expressed higher levels of PDX1, antrum-specific gastrin-expressing endocrine cells, and MUC5AC+ surface mucus cells compared with thFGOs (Figures 3E–3H). Conversely, thFGOs contained more ATP4B+/Gastric intrinsic factor (Gastric Intrinsic factor) GIF+ parietal cells than the hAGOs, and hFGOs had fundus-specific PGA3+ chief cells that were absent in hAGOs (Figures 3E, 3I, and 3J). Ghrelin-expressing endocrine cells and pepsinogen C (PGC)+ cells at the bases of the glands were observed in both regions of the stomach, with higher ghrelin expression observed in hFGOs (Figures 3E and 3K). In general, the extent of glandular morphogenesis of hFGOs was less than that of thAGOs (Figures 3C–3E). We demonstrated previously that differentiation of parietal cells in vitro required BMP signaling and Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition (Figure S2H; McCracken et al., 2017McCracken K.W. Aihara E. Martin B. Crawford C.M. Broda T. Treguier J. Zhang X. Shannon J.M. Montrose M.H. Wells J.M. Wnt/β-catenin promotes gastric fundus specification in mice and humans.Nature. 2017; 541: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar); however, thFGOs required no additional factors for robust parietal cell differentiation (Figures 3E, 3I, 3L, and 3M), demonstrating that the signaling processes that control gastric cell type specification occur normally in engineered tissue. As observed in human stomach biopsies, engineered antral tissue does contain parietal cells but at lower numbers than in fundic glands (Figures 3E, 3I, 3L, and 3M; Choi et al., 2014Choi E. Roland J.T. Barlow B.J. O’Neal R. Rich A.E. Nam K.T. Shi C. Goldenring J.R. Cell lineage distribution atlas of the human stomach reveals heterogeneous gland populations in the gastric antrum.Gut. 2014; 63: 1711-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, parietal cells in hFGOs in vitro only expressed the ATP4B+ subunit of the H+/K+ ATPase, and the cellular localization is primarily cytoplasmic (Figure S2H), whereas hFGOs matured in vivo expressed much higher levels of the ATP4A and ATP4B subunits, which colocalize on the apical membrane (Figure 3L), suggesting that these parietal cells are more mature than their in vitro counterparts. These data show that engineering mesenchyme and ENS cells into hAGOs and hFGOs results in formation of gastric tissues that more closely resemble human stomach. The stomach plays an essential role in mechanical breakdown of food and in emptying it into the duodenum. This gastric motility involves the ENS, which functionally controls smooth muscle contractions. To investigate whether the ENS and smooth muscle in the 3-germ-layer hAGOs formed a functional neuromuscul"

https://openalex.org/W3215253112,"Abstract Learned associations between stimuli in different sensory modalities can shape the way we perceive these stimuli. However, it is not well understood how these interactions are mediated or at what level of the processing hierarchy they occur. Here we describe a neural mechanism by which an auditory input can shape visual representations of behaviorally relevant stimuli through direct interactions between auditory and visual cortices in mice. We show that the association of an auditory stimulus with a visual stimulus in a behaviorally relevant context leads to experience-dependent suppression of visual responses in primary visual cortex (V1). Auditory cortex axons carry a mixture of auditory and retinotopically matched visual input to V1, and optogenetic stimulation of these axons selectively suppresses V1 neurons that are responsive to the associated visual stimulus after, but not before, learning. Our results suggest that cross-modal associations can be communicated by long-range cortical connections and that, with learning, these cross-modal connections function to suppress responses to predictable input."

However, how the brain encodes the reinforcing properties of social interactions remains unclear. In this study, using in vivo recording in freely moving mice, we show that dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) increase their activity during interactions with an unfamiliar conspecific and display heterogeneous responses. Using a social instrumental task, we then show that VTA DA neuron activity encodes social prediction error and drives social reinforcement learning. Thus, our findings suggest that VTA DA neurons are a neural substrate for a social learning signal that drives motivated behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3215663653,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been influencing travel behaviour in many urban areas around the world since the beginning of 2020. As a consequence, bike-sharing schemes have been affected—partly due to the change in travel demand and behaviour as well as a shift from public transit. This study estimates the varying effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the London bike-sharing system (Santander Cycles) over the period March–December 2020. We employed a Bayesian second-order random walk time-series model to account for temporal correlation in the data. We compared the observed number of cycle hires and hire time with their respective counterfactuals (what would have been if the pandemic had not happened) to estimate the magnitude of the change caused by the pandemic. The results indicated that following a reduction in cycle hires in March and April 2020, the demand rebounded from May 2020, remaining in the expected range of what would have been if the pandemic had not occurred. This could indicate the resiliency of Santander Cycles. With respect to hire time, an important increase occurred in April, May, and June 2020, indicating that bikes were hired for longer trips, perhaps partly due to a shift from public transit."
https://openalex.org/W3215208697,"Chromosome loops shift dynamically during development, homeostasis, and disease. CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is known to anchor loops and construct 3D genomes, but how anchor sites are selected is not yet understood. Here, we unveil Jpx RNA as a determinant of anchor selectivity. Jpx RNA targets thousands of genomic sites, preferentially binding promoters of active genes. Depleting Jpx RNA causes ectopic CTCF binding, massive shifts in chromosome looping, and downregulation of >700 Jpx target genes. Without Jpx, thousands of lost loops are replaced by de novo loops anchored by ectopic CTCF sites. Although Jpx controls CTCF binding on a genome-wide basis, it acts selectively at the subset of developmentally sensitive CTCF sites. Specifically, Jpx targets low-affinity CTCF motifs and displaces CTCF protein through competitive inhibition. We conclude that Jpx acts as a CTCF release factor and shapes the 3D genome by regulating anchor site usage."

https://openalex.org/W3217139077,"Adaptation to mechanical load, leading to enhanced force and power output, is a characteristic feature of skeletal muscle. Formation of new myonuclei required for efficient muscle hypertrophy relies on prior activation and proliferation of muscle stem cells (MuSCs). However, the mechanisms controlling MuSC expansion under conditions of increased load are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that interstitial mesenchymal progenitors respond to mechanical load and stimulate MuSC proliferation in a surgical mouse model of increased muscle load. Mechanistically, transcriptional activation of Yes-associated protein 1 (Yap1)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (Taz) in mesenchymal progenitors results in local production of thrombospondin-1 (Thbs1), which, in turn, drives MuSC proliferation through CD47 signaling. Under homeostatic conditions, however, CD47 signaling is insufficient to promote MuSC proliferation and instead depends on prior downregulation of the Calcitonin receptor. Our results suggest that relayed signaling between mesenchymal progenitors and MuSCs through a Yap1/Taz-Thbs1-CD47 pathway is critical to establish the supply of MuSCs during muscle hypertrophy."

The apoptolidin family of glycomacrolides are distinguished by their selective cytotoxicity towards oncogene-transformed cells, yet their molecular mechanism remains uncertain. We used photoaffinity analogs of the apoptolidins to identify the F1 subcomplex of mitochondrial ATP synthase as the target of apoptolidin A. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of apoptolidin and ammocidin-ATP synthase complexes revealed a novel shared mode of inhibition that was confirmed by deep mutational scanning of the binding interface to reveal resistance mutations which were confirmed using CRISPR-Cas9. Ammocidin A was found to suppress leukemia progression in vivo at doses that were tolerated with minimal toxicity.

https://openalex.org/W3214801705,"The resilience and vulnerability of airport networks are significant challenges during the COVID-19 global pandemic. Previous studies considered node failure of networks under natural disasters and extreme weather. Herein, we propose a complex network methodology combined with data-driven to assess the resilience of airport networks toward global-scale disturbance using the Chinese airport network (CAN) and the European airport network (EAN) as a case study. The assessment framework includes vulnerability and resilience analyses from the network- and node-level perspectives. Subsequently, we apply the framework to analyze the airport networks in China and Europe. Specifically, real air traffic data for 232 airports in China and 82 airports in Europe are selected to form the CAN and EAN, respectively. The complex network analysis reveals that the CAN and the EAN are scale-free small-world networks, that are resilient to random attacks. However, the connectivity and vulnerability of the CAN are inferior to those of the EAN. In addition, we select the passenger throughput from the top-50 airports in China and Europe to perform a comparative analysis. By comparing the resilience evaluation of individual airports, we discovered that the factors of resilience assessment of an airport network for global disturbance considers the network metrics and the effect of government policy in actual operations. Additionally, this study also proves that a country’s emergency response-ability towards the COVID-19 has a significantly affectes the recovery of its airport network."
https://openalex.org/W3215570913,"Abstract Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) superfamily signaling is a prime inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) that foster cancer cell invasion and metastasis, a major cause of cancer-related deaths. Yet, TGFβ signaling is frequently inactivated in human tumor entities including colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) with a high proportion of mutations incapacitating SMAD4 , which codes for a transcription factor (TF) central to canonical TGFβ and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Beyond its role in initiating EMT, SMAD4 was reported to crucially contribute to subsequent gene regulatory events during EMT execution. It is therefore widely assumed that SMAD4 -mutant ( SMAD4 mut ) cancer cells are unable to undergo EMT. Here, we scrutinized this notion and probed for potential SMAD4-independent EMT execution using SMAD4 mut CRC cell lines. We show that SMAD4 mut cells exhibit morphological changes, become invasive, and regulate EMT marker genes upon induction of the EMT-TF SNAIL1. Furthermore, SNAIL1-induced EMT in SMAD4 mut cells was found to be entirely independent of TGFβ/BMP receptor activity. Global assessment of the SNAIL1-dependent transcriptome confirmed the manifestation of an EMT gene regulatory program in SMAD4 mut cells highly related to established EMT signatures. Finally, analyses of human tumor transcriptomes showed that SMAD4 mutations are not underrepresented in mesenchymal tumor samples and that expression patterns of EMT-associated genes are similar in SMAD4 mut and SMAD4 wild-type ( SMAD4 wt ) cases. Altogether, our findings suggest that alternative TFs take over the gene regulatory functions of SMAD4 downstream of EMT-TFs, arguing for considerable plasticity of gene regulatory networks operating in EMT execution. Further, they establish that EMT is not categorically precluded in SMAD4 mut tumors, which is relevant for their diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation."

The fracturing fluid used in the process plays a substantial role in determining the results. Hence, several research and development efforts have been geared towards developing more sustainable, efficient, and improved fracturing fluids. Herein, we present a dynamic binary complex (DBC) solution, with potential to be useful in the hydraulic fracturing domain. It has a supramolecular structure formed by the self-assembly of low molecular weight viscosifiers (LMWVs) oleic acid and diethylenetriamine into an elongated entangled network under alkaline conditions. With less than 2 wt% constituents dispersed in aqueous solution, a viscous gel that exhibits high viscosities even under shear was formed. Key features include responsiveness to pH and salinity, and a zero-shear viscosity that could be tuned by a factor of ~280 by changing the pH. Furthermore, its viscous properties were more pronounced in the presence of salt. Sand settling tests revealed its potential to hold up sand particles for extended periods of time. In conclusion, this DBC solution system has potential to be utilized as a smart salt-responsive, pH-switchable hydraulic fracturing fluid."
https://openalex.org/W3215884870,"Blood-based biomarkers including systemic inflammation (SI) indicators or circulating factors (cytokines, chemokines, or growth factors) are associated with a poor prognosis for lung cancer patients. Collectively these biomarkers can predict the immune state of a patient. We wanted to define and compare the immune states of small cell and non-small cell lung cancer patients, in the hopes that the information gained could lead to overall improvements in patient care and outcomes. Specimens and data from 235 patients was utilized, 49 surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with no evidence of disease (DF), 135 advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 51 small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SI markers neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte (PLR), systemic inflammation index (SII), and systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) were determined from blood counts. Forty-seven plasma cytokines were measured using a multiplex bead-based assay. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox Proportional Hazards models. NSCLC patients had significantly high levels of SI markers than SCLC and DF patients, while NLR, PLR and SII were also higher in SCLC than DF patients. SI optimized marker values to differentiate SI value were; 6.04 (NLR), 320 (PLR), 1615 (SII), and 7.3 (SIRI). Elevated levels NLR (p&lt;0.001), PLR (p&lt;0.001), and SII (p = 0.018) were associated with a worse PFS and OS in NSCLC, while none of the markers were associated with PFS in SCLC patients. NSCLC patients with a poor outcome displayed heterogeneous immune states relative to systemic inflammation and circulating IL-6 markers. These groups could be distinguished based on the cytokines IL-8, TNFα, and IL-27. We identified heterogeneity of immune states in SCLC and NSCLC patients and in NSCLC patients with the poorest prognosis. This heterogeneity could be exploited to improve outcomes for these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3216308046,"Contact between people with similar opinions and characteristics occurs at a higher rate than among other people, a phenomenon known as homophily. The presence of clusters of unvaccinated people has been associated with increased incidence of infectious disease outbreaks despite high population-wide vaccination rates. The epidemiological consequences of homophily regarding other beliefs as well as correlations among beliefs or circumstances are poorly understood, however. Here, we use a simple compartmental disease model as well as a more complex COVID-19 model to study how homophily and correlation of beliefs and circumstances in a social interaction network affect the probability of disease outbreak and COVID-19-related mortality. We find that the current social context, characterized by the presence of homophily and correlations between who vaccinates, who engages in risk reduction, and individual risk status, corresponds to a situation with substantially worse disease burden than in the absence of heterogeneities. In the presence of an effective vaccine, the effects of homophily and correlation of beliefs and circumstances become stronger. Further, the optimal vaccination strategy depends on the degree of homophily regarding vaccination status as well as the relative level of risk mitigation high- and low-risk individuals practice. The developed methods are broadly applicable to any investigation in which node attributes in a graph might reasonably be expected to cluster or exhibit correlations."
https://openalex.org/W3215632925,"An extensive simulation program is used in this study to discover the best ANN model for predicting the compressive strength of concrete containing Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS). To accomplish this purpose, an experimental database of 595 samples is compiled from the literature and utilized to find the best ANN architecture. The cement content, water content, coarse aggregate content, fine aggregate content, GGBFS content, carboxylic type hyper plasticizing content, superplasticizer content, and testing age are the eight inputs in this database. As a result, the optimal selection of the ANN design is carried out and evaluated using conventional statistical metrics. The results demonstrate that utilizing the best architecture [8-14-4-1] among the 240 investigated architectures, and the best ANN model, is a very efficient predictor of the compressive strength of concrete using GGBFS, with a maximum R2 value of 0.968 on the training part and 0.965 on the testing part. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed over 500 Monte Carlo simulations using the best ANN model to determine the reliability of ANN model in predicting the compressive strength of concrete. The findings of this research may make it easier and more efficient to apply the ANN model to many civil engineering challenges."

However, studies on the benefit of vitamin D supplementation in MS show inconclusive results. Here, we explore whether vitamin D-associated SNPs and MS risk alleles confound serological response to vitamin D supplementation.34 participants from the SOLARIUM study consented to genotyping, of which 26 had vitamin D data available. The SOLARIUM study randomised relapsing-remitting MS patients to placebo or 14,000 IU vitamin D3 for 48 weeks. Participants were categorised as either 'carriers' or 'non-carriers' of the risk allele for 4 SNPs: two related to D binding protein (DBP) and associated with lower 25(OH)D levels (rs4588 and rs7041), and two related to vitamin D metabolism enzymes CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 and associated with a higher risk of MS (rs12368653; rs2248359, respectively). 25(OH)D levels were determined at baseline and after 48 weeks.The DBP-related SNPs showed no difference in 25(OH)D status at baseline, but carriers of the rs7041 risk allele showed lower 25(OH)D-levels compared to non-carriers after 48 weeks of supplementation (median 224.2 vs. 332.0 nmol/L, p = 0.013). For CYP related SNPs, neither showed a difference at baseline, but carriers of the rs12368653 risk allele showed higher 25(OH)D-levels compared to non-carriers after 48 weeks of supplementation (median 304.1 vs. 152.0 nmol/L, p = 0.014).Vitamin D-related SNPs affect the serological response to high-dose vitamin D supplementation. The effects on more common doses of vitamin D, as well as the clinical consequence of this altered response, need to be investigated further."

Yet, it is important to investigate which individuals are likely to accept nudges, as those who are supposed to benefit from the implementation should not oppose it. The main objective of this study was to integrate research on self-regulation and nudging, and to examine acceptability of nudges as a function of self-regulation capacity and motivation.Participants (N = 301) filled in questionnaires about several components of self-regulation capacity (self-control, proactive coping competence, self-efficacy, perceived control and perceived difficulty) and motivation (autonomous motivation and controlled motivation). To evaluate nudge acceptability, we used three vignettes describing three types of nudges (default, portion size, and rearrangement) that stimulated either a pro-self behavior (healthy eating) or pro-social behavior (sustainable eating) and asked participants to rate the nudges on (aspects of) acceptability.Results revealed that there were substantial differences in acceptability between the three types of nudges, such that the default nudge was seen as less acceptable and the rearrangement nudge as most acceptable. The behavior that was stimulated did not affect acceptability, even though the nudges that targeted healthy eating were seen as more pro-self than the nudges targeting sustainable eating. From all self-regulation components, autonomous motivation was the only measure that was consistently associated with nudge acceptability across the three nudges. For self-regulatory capacity, only some elements were occasionally related to acceptability for some nudges.The current study thus shows that people are more inclined to accept nudges that target behaviors that they are autonomously motivated for, while people do not meaningfully base their judgments of acceptability on self-regulatory capacity."
https://openalex.org/W4226147753,"Cell adhesion molecule L1 regulates multiple cell functions and L1 deficiency is linked to several neural diseases. Proteolytic processing generates functionally decisive L1 fragments, which are imported into the nucleus. By computational analysis, we found at L1's C-terminal end the chromo shadow domain-binding motif PxVxL, which directs the binding of nuclear proteins to the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) isoforms α, β, and ɣ. By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we show that the intracellular L1 domain binds to all HP1 isoforms. These interactions involve the HP1 chromo shadow domain and are mediated via the sequence 1158 KDET1161 in the intracellular domain of murine L1, but not by L1's C-terminal PxVxL motif. Immunoprecipitation using nuclear extracts from the brain and from cultured cerebellar and cortical neurons indicates that HP1 isoforms interact with a yet unknown nuclear L1 fragment of approximately 55 kDa (L1-55), which carries ubiquitin residues. Proximity ligation indicates a close association between L1-55 and the HP1 isoforms in neuronal nuclei. This association is reduced after the treatment of neurons with inhibitors of metalloproteases, β-site of amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1), or ɣ-secretase, suggesting that cleavage of full-length L1 by these proteases generates L1-55. Reduction of HP1α, -β, or -ɣ expression by siRNA decreases L1-dependent neurite outgrowth from cultured cortical neurons and decreases the L1-dependent migration of L1-transfected HEK293 cells in a scratch assay. These findings indicate that the interaction of the novel fragment L1-55 with HP1 isoforms in nuclei affects L1-dependent functions, such as neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration."
https://openalex.org/W4226419794,"The important role of hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) as a novel gasotransmitter in inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) has been widely recognized. The dopamine D1 receptor (DR1), a G protein coupled receptor, inhibits atherosclerosis by suppressing VSMC proliferation. However, whether DR1 contributes to VSMC apoptosis via the induction of endogenous H2 S in diabetic mice is unclear. Here, we found that hyperglycemia decreased the expressions of DR1 and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE, a key enzyme for endogenous H2 S production) and reduced endogenous H2 S generation in mouse arteries and cultured VSMCs. DR1 agonist SKF38393 increased DR1 and CSE expressions and stimulated endogenous H2 S generation. Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, a H2 S donor) increased CSE expressions and H2 S generation but had no effect on DR1 expression. In addition, high glucose (HG) increased VSMC apoptosis, up-regulated IGF-1-IGF-1R and HB-EGF-EGFR, and stimulated ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt pathways. Overexpression of DR1, the addition of SKF38393 or supply of NaHS further promoted VSMC apoptosis and down-regulated the above pathways. Knock out of CSE or the addition of the CSE inhibitor poly propylene glycol diminished the effect of SKF38393. Moreover, calmodulin (CaM) interacted with CSE in VSMCs; HG increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration and induced CaM expression, further strengthened the interaction of CaM with CSE in VSMCs, which were further enhanced by SKF38393. CaM inhibitor W-7, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3 ) inhibitor 2-APB, or ryanodine receptor inhibitor tetracaine abolished the stimulatory effect of SKF38393 on CaM expression and intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Taken together, these results suggest that DR1 up-regulates CSE/H2 S signaling by inducing the Ca2+ -CaM pathway followed by down-regulations of IGF-1-IGF-1R and HB-EGF-EGFR and their downstream ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt, finally promoting the apoptosis of VSMCs in diabetic mice."
https://openalex.org/W3215880665,"Several human-produced volatiles have been reported to mediate the host-seeking process under laboratory conditions, yet no effective lure or repellent has been developed for field application. Previously, we found a gradation of the attractiveness of foot odors of different malaria free individuals to Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto Giles. In this study, foot odor of the individual with the most attractive 'smelly' feet to the An. gambiae was collected, analyzed and attractive blend components identified.The foot odor of the individual with the most attractive 'smelly' feet to the An. gambiae was trapped on Porapak Q and analyzed by gas chromatography-linked mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Specific constituents perceived by the insect olfactory system were then identified by GC-linked to electro-antennography detector (GC-EAD) and characterized by GC-MS. The contribution of each constituent to the behavioral response of An. gambiae was assessed through subtractive assays under semi-field conditions in a screen-house using Counter Flow Geometry (CFG traps) baited with (i) the blend of all the EAD-active and (ii) other blends containing all components with exclusion of one component at a time. The number of mosquitoes trapped in the baited CFG traps were compared with those in the control traps.Eleven major and minor constituents: 2 carboxylic acids, six aldehydes, two ketones and one phenolic compound, were confirmed to be EAD-active. The contribution of each constituent to the behavioral response of An. gambiae was assessed through subtractive assays under semi- field conditions. Exclusion/ subtraction of one of the following compounds: i-butyric acid, i-valeric acid, n-octanal, n-nonanal, n-decanal, n-dodecanal, undecanal or n-tridecanal, from each blend led to reduction in the attractiveness of all the resulting blends, suggesting that all of them are critical/important for the attractiveness of the foot odor to An. gambiae mosquitoes. However, exclusion/subtraction of 4-ethoxyacetophenone, 4-ethylacetophenone and/or 2-methylphenol, led to significant enhancements in the attractiveness of the resulting blends, suggesting that each of these compounds had repellent effect on An. gambiae ss. Undecanal exhibited kairomonal activity at low natural concentrations under semi-field conditions but repellent activity at high unnatural conditions in the laboratory. Furthermore, the comparison of the mean mosquito catches in traps baited with the nine-component blend without 4-ethoxyacetophenone, 4-ethylacetophenone and the complete foot odor collection revealed that the former is significantly more attractive and confirmed the repellent effect of the two carbonyl compounds at low natural concentration levels.These results suggest that differential attractiveness of An. gambiae to human feet is due to qualitative and/or qualitative differences in the chemical compositions of the foot odors from individual human beings and relative proportions of the two chemical signatures (attractants versus repellents) as observed from the ratios of the bioactive components in the foot odors of the most attractive and least attractive individuals. Chemical signature means the ensemble of the compounds released by the organism in a specific physiological state. The chemical signature is emitter-dependent, but does not depend on receiver response. Thus, there is only one chemical signature for one individual or species that may eventually include inactive, attractive and repellent components for another organism. The nine-component attractive blend has a potential as an effective field bait for trapping of malaria vectors in human dwellings."
https://openalex.org/W3216609923,"The Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) is composed of cycles of two different electroencephalographic features: an activation A-phase followed by a B-phase representing the background activity. CAP is considered a physiological marker of sleep instability. Despite its informative nature, the clinical applications remain limited as CAP analysis is a time-consuming activity. In order to overcome this limit, several automatic detection methods were recently developed. In this paper, two new dimensions were investigated in the attempt to optimize novel, efficient and automatic detection algorithms: 1) many electroencephalographic leads were compared to identify the best local performance, and 2) the global contribution of the concurrent detection across several derivations to CAP identification. The developed algorithms were tested on 41 polysomnographic recordings from normal (n = 8) and pathological (n = 33) subjects. In comparison with the visual CAP analysis as the gold standard, the performance of each algorithm was evaluated. Locally, the detection on the F4-C4 derivation showed the best performance in comparison with all other leads, providing practical suggestions of electrode montage when a lean and minimally invasive approach is preferable. A further improvement in the detection was achieved by a multi-trace method, the Global Analysis-Common Events, to be applied when several recording derivations are available. Moreover, CAP time and CAP rate obtained with these algorithms positively correlated with the ones identified by the scorer. These preliminary findings support efficient automated ways for the evaluation of the sleep instability, generalizable to both normal and pathological subjects affected by different sleep disorders."

Although GC-A is highly phosphorylated, and dephosphorylation inactivates the enzyme, the significance of GC-A phosphorylation to heart structure and function remains unknown. To identify in vivo processes that are regulated by GC-A phosphorylation, we substituted glutamates for known phosphorylation sites to make GC-A8E/8E mice that express an enzyme that cannot be inactivated by dephosphorylation. GC-A activity, but not protein, was increased in heart and kidney membranes from GC-A8E/8E mice. Activities were threefold higher in female compared to male cardiac ventricles. Plasma cGMP and testosterone were elevated in male and female GC-A8E/8E mice, but aldosterone was only increased in mutant male mice. Plasma and urinary creatinine concentrations were decreased and increased, respectively, but blood pressure and heart rate were unchanged in male GC-A8E/8E mice. Heart weight to body weight ratios for GC-A8E/8E male, but not female, mice were 12% lower with a 14% reduction in cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area. Subcutaneous injection of fsANP, a long-lived ANP analog, increased plasma cGMP and decreased aldosterone in male GC-AWT/WT and GC-A8E/8E mice at 15 min, but only GC-A8E/8E mice had elevated levels of plasma cGMP and aldosterone at 60 min. fsANP reduced ventricular ERK1/2 phosphorylation to a greater extent and for a longer time in the male mutant compared to WT mice. Finally, ejection fractions were increased in male but not female hearts from GC-A8E/8E mice. We conclude that increased phosphorylation-dependent GC-A activity decreases cardiac ERK activity, which results in smaller male hearts with improved systolic function."
https://openalex.org/W3217562506,"To determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of participants with glaucoma attending a public eye care facility in Nigeria.Hospital based retrospective study of glaucoma participants aged 50 years and above seen over a 5-year period. Descriptive statistics summarized the demographic, clinical characteristics and treatment of the participants and determined the association of variables with gender and age. Prevalence of the glaucoma by type, and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were also calculated.Of the 5482 case files that were reviewed, 995 (18.15%, 95% Cl 17.15-19.19%) had glaucoma particularly primary open angle glaucoma (11.55%, 95%CI 10.73-12.42%) and were mostly females (564, 56.7%) aged 69 ± 12 years (range, 50-103 years). In contrast to other glaucoma types, the prevalence of primary angle closure glaucoma (3.68, 95%CI 3.22-4.22) increased by 15% over 5 years. The mean intraocular pressure ranged from 15-50 mmHg but higher in females than males (27.8 ± 6.1mmHg versus 26.6 ± 6.0 mmHg, P <0.05) who had comparable VA (0.58 ± 0.4 Log MAR) and cup-disc ratios (P >0.05). On presentation, the glaucoma hemi field test (GHFT) was outside the normal limits in 45.5% and 54.5% of males and females, respectively. The type of visual field defect was associated with glaucoma type (P = 0.047). Arcuate scotoma was most common (35.5%) across glaucoma types, paracentral scotoma more common in Secondary glaucoma while Seidel scotoma was highest in NTG (19.3%). Beta-blocker was the mainstay of management (42.2%) but more likely to be prescribed to males while more females received carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.The high prevalence of glaucoma in older people remains a public health problem in Nigeria. The fact that about half of the participants presented with visual field defect suggests there is a need for public health messages to emphasize on early glaucoma screening, detection and management."

The current study aimed to assess the diagnostic value and accuracy of different methods of cervical lesion screening. A total of 1622 females who visited the Outpatient Department of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region People’s Hospital between January and December 2018 were consecutively enrolled. All participants underwent separate high-risk human papilloma virus (HR-HPV) DNA detection, ThinPrep cytology testing (TCT) and colposcopic biopsy. Their medical records were retrospectively analyzed. While considering biopsy outcomes as the gold standard, the diagnostic values of TCT, HR-HPV testing, and TCT+HR-HPV testing for cervical cancer screening were compared. The sensitivity, specificity and Youden index of each method were calculated. Among the different methods, TCT+HR-HPV testing had the highest sensitivity (89.8%), followed by TCT (79.9%) and HR-HPV testing (49.2%). The combined method also had the highest Youden value, and its screening outcomes exhibited the highest consistency with those of biopsy. In addition, the combined method had the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which was 0.673 (0.647, 0.699), compared with any other screening method. Compared with TCT or HR-HPV testing alone, TCT+HR-HPV testing serves as a better screening method for cervical cancer and precancerous lesions."

https://openalex.org/W3217432971,"The COVID-19 is one of the worst pandemics in modern history. We applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the daily time series of the COVID-19 death cases and confirmed cases for the top 25 countries from April of 2020 to February of 2021. We calculated the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the cross-correlation matrix of the changes in daily accumulated data over monthly time windows. The largest eigenvalue describes the overall evolution dynamics of the COVID-19 and indicates that evolution was faster in April of 2020 than in any other period. By using the first two PC coefficients, we can identify the group dynamics of the COVID-19 evolution. We observed groups under critical states in the loading plot and found that American and European countries are represented by strong clusters in the loading plot. The first PC plays an important role and the correlations (C 1 ) between the normalized logarithmic changes in deaths or confirmed cases and the first PCs may be used as indicators of different phases of the COVID-19. By varying C 1 over time, we identified different phases of the COVID-19 in the analyzed countries over the target time period."
https://openalex.org/W3217492522,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disease and variations in multispecific membrane transporter functions may affect T2DM development, complications or treatment. In this work we have analyzed the potential effects of a major polymorphism, the Q141K variant of the ABCG2 transporter in T2DM. The ABCG2 protein is a multispecific xeno- and endobiotic transporter, affecting drug metabolism and playing a key role in uric acid extrusion. The ABCG2-Q141K variant, with reduced expression level and function, is present in 15-35% of individuals, depending on the genetic background of the population, and has been shown to significantly affect gout development. Several other diseases, including hypertension, chronic renal failure, and T2DM have also been reported to be associated with high serum uric acid levels, suggesting that ABCG2 may also play a role in these conditions. In this work we have compared relatively small cohorts (n = 203) of T2DM patients (n = 99) and healthy (n = 104) individuals regarding the major laboratory indicators of T2DM and determined the presence of the SNP rs2231142 (C421A), resulting the ABCG2-Q141K protein variant. We found significantly higher blood glucose and HbA1c levels in the T2DM patients carrying the ABCG2-Q141K variant. These findings may emphasize the potential metabolic role of ABCG2 in T2DM and indicate that further research should explore how prevention and treatment of this disease may be affected by the frequent polymorphism of ABCG2."
https://openalex.org/W3217556109,"Camels are vital to food production in the drylands of the Horn of Africa, with milk as their main contribution to food security. A major constraint to camel milk production is mastitis, inflammation of the mammary gland. The condition negatively impacts milk yield and quality as well as household income. A leading cause of mastitis in dairy camels is Streptococcus agalactiae , or group B Streptococcus (GBS), which is also a commensal and pathogen of humans and cattle. It has been suggested that extramammary reservoirs for this pathogen may contribute to the occurrence of mastitis in camels. We explored the molecular epidemiology of GBS in camels using a cross-sectional study design for sample collection and phenotypic, genomic and phylogenetic analysis of isolates. Among 88 adult camels and 93 calves from six herds in Laikipia County, Kenya, GBS was detected in 20% of 50 milk samples, 25% of 152 nasal swabs, 8% of 90 oral swabs and 3% of 90 rectal swabs, but not in vaginal swabs. Per camel herd, two to four sequence types (ST) were identified using Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST). More than half of the isolates belonged to ST617 or its single-locus variant, ST1652, with these STs found across all sample types. Capsular serotype VI was detected in 30 of 58 isolates. In three herds, identical STs were detected in milk and swab samples, suggesting that extramammary sources of GBS may contribute to the maintenance and spread of GBS within camel herds. This needs to be considered when developing prevention and control strategies for GBS mastitis. The high nasal carriage rate, low recto-vaginal carriage rate, and high prevalence of serotype VI for GBS in camels are in stark contrast to the distribution of GBS in humans and in cattle and reveal hitherto unknown ecological and molecular features of this bacterial species."
https://openalex.org/W3217574954,"Accurate segmentation of retinal vessels is critical to the mechanism, diagnosis, and treatment of many ocular pathologies. Due to the poor contrast and inhomogeneous background of fundus imaging and the complex structure of retinal fundus images, this makes accurate segmentation of blood vessels from retinal images still challenging. In this paper, we propose an effective framework for retinal vascular segmentation, which is innovative mainly in the retinal image pre-processing stage and segmentation stage. First, we perform image enhancement on three publicly available fundus datasets based on the multiscale retinex with color restoration (MSRCR) method, which effectively suppresses noise and highlights the vessel structure creating a good basis for the segmentation phase. The processed fundus images are then fed into an effective Reverse Fusion Attention Residual Network (RFARN) for training to achieve more accurate retinal vessel segmentation. In the RFARN, we use Reverse Channel Attention Module (RCAM) and Reverse Spatial Attention Module (RSAM) to highlight the shallow details of the channel and spatial dimensions. And RCAM and RSAM are used to achieve effective fusion of deep local features with shallow global features to ensure the continuity and integrity of the segmented vessels. In the experimental results for the DRIVE, STARE and CHASE datasets, the evaluation metrics were 0.9712, 0.9822 and 0.9780 for accuracy (Acc), 0.8788, 0.8874 and 0.8352 for sensitivity (Se), 0.9803, 0.9891 and 0.9890 for specificity (Sp), area under the ROC curve(AUC) was 0.9910, 0.9952 and 0.9904, and the F1-Score was 0.8453, 0.8707 and 0.8185. In comparison with existing retinal image segmentation methods, e.g. UNet, R2UNet, DUNet, HAnet, Sine-Net, FANet, etc., our method in three fundus datasets achieved better vessel segmentation performance and results."

First, is an analysis of anticholinergic AEs using spontaneous adverse drug event databases possible? Second, what is the main drug suspected of inducing anticholinergic AEs in the databases? Third, do database differences yield different results?We used two databases: the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database (FAERS) and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database (JADER) recorded from 2004 to 2020. We defined three types of anticholinergic AEs: central nervous system (CNS) AEs, peripheral nervous system (PNS) AEs, and a combination of these AEs. We counted the number of cases and evaluated the ratio of drug-anticholinergic AE pairs between FAERS and JADER. We computed reporting odds ratios (RORs) and assessed the drugs using Beers Criteria®.Constipation was the most reported AE in FAERS. The ratio of drug-anticholinergic AE pairs was statistically significantly larger in FAERS than JADER. Overactive bladder agents were suspected drugs common to both databases. Other drugs differed between the two databases. CNS AEs were associated with antidementia drugs in FAERS and opioids in JADER. In the assessment using Beers Criteria®, signals were detected for almost all drugs. Between the two databases, a significantly higher positive correlation was observed for PNS AEs (correlation coefficient 0.85, P = 0.0001). The ROR was significantly greater in JADER.There are many methods to investigate AEs. This study shows that the analysis of anticholinergic AEs using spontaneous adverse drug event databases is possible. From this analysis, various suspected drugs were detected. In particular, FAERS had many cases. The differences in the results between the two databases may reflect differences in the reporting countries. Further study of the relationship between drugs and CNS AEs should be conducted."
https://openalex.org/W3216635616,"Background “Sleep Low-Train Low” is a training-nutrition strategy intended to purposefully reduce muscle glycogen availability around specific exercise sessions, potentially amplifying the training stimulus via augmented cell signalling. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a 3-week home-based “sleep low-train low” programme and its effects on cycling performance in trained athletes. Methods Fifty-five trained athletes (Functional Threshold Power [FTP]: 258 ± 52W) completed a home-based cycling training program consisting of evening high-intensity training (6 × 5 min at 105% FTP), followed by low-intensity training (1 hr at 75% FTP) the next morning, three times weekly for three consecutive weeks. Participant’s daily carbohydrate (CHO) intake (6 g·kg -1 ·d -1 ) was matched but timed differently to manipulate CHO availability around exercise: no CHO consumption post- HIT until post-LIT sessions [Sleep Low (SL), n = 28] or CHO consumption evenly distributed throughout the day [Control (CON), n = 27]. Sessions were monitored remotely via power data uploaded to an online training platform, with performance tests conducted pre-, post-intervention. Results LIT exercise intensity reduced by 3% across week 1, 3 and 2% in week 2 ( P &lt; 0.01) with elevated RPE in SL vs. CON ( P &lt; 0.01). SL enhanced FTP by +5.5% vs. +1.2% in CON ( P &lt; 0.01). Comparable increases in 5-min peak power output (PPO) were observed between groups ( P &lt; 0.01) with +2.3% and +2.7% in SL and CON, respectively ( P = 0.77). SL 1-min PPO was unchanged (+0.8%) whilst CON improved by +3.9% ( P = 0.0144). Conclusion Despite reduced relative training intensity, our data demonstrate short-term “sleep low-train low” intervention improves FTP compared with typically “normal” CHO availability during exercise. Importantly, training was completed unsupervised at home (during the COVID-19 pandemic), thus demonstrating the feasibility of completing a “sleep low-train low” protocol under non-laboratory conditions."

BBTD epidemiology has been little studied, mixed landscape smallholder systems. The relative risks associated with this disease vary between geographical areas and landscapes. This work analyzed the management and vegetation conditions in smallholder gardens to assess the factors linked to landscape-level BBTV transmission and management. Mapping was done in this study area which is in a BBTD-endemic region, involving farmers actively managing the disease, but with household-level decision making. A spatial scanning statistic was used to detect and identify spatial groups at the 5% significance threshold, and a Poisson regression model was used to explore propagation vectors and the effect of surrounding vegetation and crop diversity. Spatial groups with high relative risk were identified in three communities, Dangbo, Houéyogbé, and Adjarra. Significant associations emerged between the BBTD prevalence and some crop diversity, seed systems, and BBTD management linked factors. The identified factors form important candidate management options for the detailed assessment of landscape-scale BBTD management in smallholder communities."
https://openalex.org/W3215999119,"A distinct boundary exists between the progenitor cells in the basal limbal epithelium and the more differentiated corneal epithelial basal cells. We have shown that reciprocal expression patterns of EphA2 and Ephrin-A1 are likely to contribute to normal limbal-corneal epithelial compartmentalization as well as play a role in response to injury. How this signaling axis is regulated remains unclear. We have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in corneal epithelial wound healing and several miRNAs (e.g. miR-210) have been predicted to target ephrins. Previous expression profiling experiments demonstrated that miR-210 is prominently expressed in corneal epithelial cells. RNA-seq data acquired from miR-210-depleted HCECs showed up-regulation of genes involved in cellular migration. In addition, miR-210 is decreased after corneal injury while EphA2 is increased. Moreover, antago-210-treated HCECs markedly enhanced wound closure in a scratch wound assay. Antago-210 treatment resulted in increased EphA2 protein levels as well as pS897-EphA2, the pro-migratory form of EphA2. As expected, Ephrin-A1 levels were reduced, while levels of a well-known target of miR-210, Ephrin-A3, were increased by antago-210 treatment. The increase in migration with antago-210 could be inhibited by Ephrin-A1 overexpression, Ephrin-A1-Fc treatment or siRNA depletion of EphA2. However, depletion of Ephrin-A3 did not have effects on the antago-210-induced increase in migration. In addition, Ephrin-A1 overexpression and siEphA2 dampened EGFR signaling, which is increased by antago-210. Our data clearly demonstrate a link between miR-210 and EphA2/Ephrin-A1 signaling that regulates, in part, corneal epithelial migration. This interaction might potentially control the limbal-corneal epithelial boundary."

These systems are used for solving the difficulties encountered in engineering management with frequent cross-specialties and are vital tools for data exchange and service sharing among multiple departments. Currently, most engineering management and control systems are based on service-oriented architectures (SOAs). The integration mechanism and high coupling of SOAs leads to the reduction in system expansibility, service quality and service safety of the engineering system, making it difficult for these architectures to serve the construction of long-span valve hall engineering. To address these concerns, the management and application technology of the multidisciplinary data of valve hall engineering based on a microservice architecture (MSA) is proposed to improve the management efficiency of engineering data. A 3D integration modeling method for valve hall engineering structures and geological environments is proposed to establish the topological association between engineering structures and geological environments, without increasing the amount of model data required. A 3D intelligent engineering management and control technology for the entire process of the construction of long-span valve hall engineering is proposed, which realizes the entire process simulation and control of engineering construction based on WebGL technology. Accordingly, a three-dimensional intelligent engineering management and control system for the entire construction process of a long-span valve hall project in Southeast China is established, which can effectively manage and apply the data, display and analyze the three-dimensional model, and control and make decisions regarding the construction schedule.

https://openalex.org/W3214917458,"Low frequency electric fields were exposed to various water samples using platinum electrodes mounted near the water surface. Responses were monitored using a spectro-radiometer and a contact-angle goniometer. Treatment of DI (deionized), EZ (Exclusion Zone), and bulk water with certain electromagnetic frequencies resulted in a drop of radiance persisting for at least half an hour. Compared to DI water, however, samples of EZ and bulk water showed lesser radiance drop. Contact-angle goniometric results confirmed that when treated with alternating electric fields (E = 600 ± 150 V/m, f = 7.8 and 1000 Hz), droplets of EZ and bulk water acquired different charges. The applied electric field interacted with EZ water only when electrodes were installed above the chamber, but not beneath. Further, when DI water interacted with an electric field applied from above (E = 600 ± 150 V/m, f = 75 Hz), its radiance profile became similar to that of EZ water. Putting these last two findings together, one can say that application of an electric field on DI water from above (E = 600 ± 150 V/m, f = 7.8 to 75 Hz) may induce a molecular ordering in DI water similar to that of EZ water."
https://openalex.org/W3215148016,"The trade-up hypothesis is a female behavioral strategy related to mating with multiple males. In this hypothesis, females can produce high-quality offspring while avoiding the risk of losing reproductive opportunities by non-selective mating with males at first mating and then re-mating with more attractive males. As an internal mechanism to realize this behavioral strategy, we predicted that females would immediately fertilize their eggs when they mated with attractive males, whereas females would delay fertilization when they mated with unattractive males to trade-up sires of offspring. The guppy (Poecilia reticulata) is an ovoviviparous fish with internal fertilization, and females show a clear mate preference based on the area of orange coloration on the bodies of males. In addition, it is known that females show a re-mating strategy consistent with the trade-up hypothesis. We tested whether the attractiveness of mated males affected the gestation period and the timing of fertilization. Females were paired with either colorful males or drab males, and the gestation periods (the number of days from mating to parturition) were compared. In addition, we dissected the abdomens of the females at intervals of several days after mating and observed whether the eggs were fertilized. The gestation period in females that were paired with attractive colorful males was significantly shorter than that in females that were paired with drab males. We found that females that mated with colorful males also had their eggs fertilized earlier than those that mated with drab males. Our findings show that differences in the timing of fertilization according to attractiveness of the mate increase the opportunity for cryptic female choice and trading up."

Based on these data, we describe the epidemiology of the pandemic at national and sub-national levels and the performance of the laboratory network.We included surveillance data for individuals tested and the number of tests from March 2020 to January 2021. We calculated the incidence of COVID-19 by age, gender and state and tests per 100,000 population, the proportion of symptomatic individuals among those tested, the proportion of repeat tests and test positivity. We computed median (Interquartile range-IQR) days needed for selected surveillance activities to describe timeliness.The analysis included 176 million individuals and 188 million tests. The overall incidence of COVID-19 was 0.8%, and 12,584 persons per 100,000 population were tested. 6.1% of individuals tested returned a positive result. Ten of the 37 Indian States and Union Territories accounted for about 75.6% of the total cases. Daily testing scaled up from 40,000 initially to nearly one million in March 2021. The median duration between symptom onset and sample collection was two (IQR = 0,3) days, median duration between both sample collection and testing and between testing and data entry were less than or equal to one day. Missing or invalid entries ranged from 0.01% for age to 0.7% for test outcome.The laboratory network set-up by ICMR was scaled up massively over a short period, which enabled testing a large section of the population. Although all states and territories were affected, most cases were concentrated in a few large states. Timeliness between the various surveillance activities was acceptable, indicating good responsiveness of the surveillance system."
https://openalex.org/W3217015900,"Men are currently underrepresented in traditionally female care-oriented (communal) engagement such as taking parental leave, whereas they are overrepresented in traditionally male (agentic) engagement such as breadwinning or leadership. We examined to what extent different prototypical representations of men affect men's self-reported parental leave-taking intentions and more generally the future they can imagine for themselves with regard to work and care roles (i.e., their possible selves). We expected prototypes of men that combine the two basic stereotype dimensions of agency and communion to increase men's communal intentions. In two experiments (N1 = 132, N2 = 233), we presented male participants with contrived newspaper articles that described the ideal man of today with varying degrees of agency and communion (between-subjects design with four conditions; combined agentic and communal vs. agentic vs. communal vs. control condition). Results of Experiment 1 were in line with the main hypothesis that especially presenting a combination of agency and communion increases men's expectations for communal engagement: As compared to a control condition, men expected more to engage in caretaking in the future, reported higher parental leave-taking intentions, and tended to expect taking longer parental leave. Experiment 2 only partially replicated these findings, namely for parental leave-taking intentions. Both experiments additionally provided initial evidence for a contrast effect in that an exclusive focus on agency also increased men's self-reported parental leave-taking intentions compared to the control condition. Yet, exclusively emphasizing communion in prototypes of men did not affect men's communal intentions, which were high to begin with. We further did not find evidence for preregistered mechanisms. We discuss conditions and explanations for the emergence of these mixed effects as well as implications for the communication of gendered norms and barriers to men's communal engagement more broadly."
https://openalex.org/W3217287546,"Enrichment of rearing environment with natural elements has been suggested to improve the welfare and post-release survival of cultured fish. We studied the combined effects of shelter structures, periodical water flow and water level changes on pre- and post-release performance of critically endangered landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar m. sebago). Relative to standard (plain) rearing tanks, provision of enrichment improved fish condition factor and survival during the first year of rearing when most mortality was attributable to parasitic and bacterial infections. The consequent higher density in enriched tanks probably induced greater growth variation and more dorsal fin damages than found in fish of standard tanks. Possibly this was partly due to the applied changes in water level. Experimentally determined smolt migration tendency at age 3 did not differ, on average, between the rearing groups, but enriched-reared fish showed clearly less variation in total movement activity than standard-reared fish. Experimental angling in earthen ponds did not suggest divergent vulnerability between the differentially reared fish at age 3, but decreased condition during the preceding growth season increased vulnerability to fishing. Based on long-term post-stocking tag returns in large-lake fisheries, fish length at release but not rearing method affected the capture rates of fish released at age 2. When released at age 3 the fish grown in enriched environment had a higher risk to be captured with stationary gears and earlier by hook and line gears compared to standard-reared conspecifics. Earlier time of maximal smolt migration activity was associated with an increased risk of being captured. We suggest that environmental enrichment may modulate growth- and behavior-related qualities that indirectly increased the vulnerability to fishing in natural conditions but not in experimental setting. The favorable effects of enrichment on early survival encourages adopting enriched rearing practices in supportive breeding of landlocked salmon."

The purpose of the present study was to compare common pulmonary obstruction scores in PE in regard of time efficiency and interreader agreement based upon a representative patient sample.Overall, 50 patients with acute PE were included in this single center, retrospective analysis. Two readers scored the CT images blinded to each other and assessed the scores proposed by Mastora et al., Qanadli et al., Ghanima et al. and Kirchner et al. The required time was assessed of each reading for scoring.For reader 1, Mastora score took the longest time duration, followed by Kirchner score, Qanadli score and finally Ghanima score (every test, p<0.0001). The interreader variability was excellent for all scores with no significant differences between them. In the Spearman's correlation analysis strong correlations were identified between the scores of Mastora, Qanadli and Kirchner, whereas Ghanima score was only moderately correlated with the other scores. There was a weak correlation between time duration and Mastora score (r = 0.35, p = 0.014). For the Ghanima score, a significant inverse correlation was found (r = -0.67, p<0.0001).For the investigated obstruction scores, there are significant differences in regard of time consumption with no relevant differences in regard of interreader variability in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. Mastora score requires the most time effort, whereas the score by Ghanima the least time."
