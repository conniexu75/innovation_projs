https://openalex.org/W2023726634,"In sediments spanning the last 9000 years from Saanich Inlet L enantiomers of amino acids are most abundant, but the percentages of D enantiomers increase with age, apparently because of partial racemization. Of the amino acids measured, glutamic acid and alanine show the greatest degree of racemization; leucine, isoleucine, and valine show the least."
https://openalex.org/W1989069754,Many of the most interesting developments in semiconductor physics that have occurred in the last few years and that are anticipated in the next few years appear to lie in the realm between physics and chemistry. In this article I have tried to show how this realm can be treated accurately and realistically within the framework of theory.
https://openalex.org/W2069091563,"The seismic signal caused by the Apollo 12 lunar module is interpreted in terms of propagation between source and receiver through a layer of powder in which sound velocity increases with depth. This increase, which is due to compaction, extends over several kilometers and leads to a concentration of seismic waves toward the surface. Computer simulations with the use of ray acoustics and on the assumption of a randomly undulating lunar surface approximate well the observed signal. Seismic amplitudes are greatly enhanced in such a medium compared to solid rock, so that the observed signal requires less power to be transmitted than previously estimated."

Approximate calculations show such phase change instabilities are possible for both the 400-kilometer olivine-spinel phase transition and also for partial melting at shallower depths. The resulting flow patterns may provide a driving mechanism for the new global tectonics."
https://openalex.org/W2062778373,Evidence from leg 2 of the Deep Sea Drilling Project suggests a constant spreading rate for the floor of the North Atlantic over the past 80 million years; a major lowering of the carbonate dissolution level during the early Pliocene; and an early to middle Eocene age for horizon A.
https://openalex.org/W2014737614,"The number of plant deaths which occurred over 8 years of chronic gamma irradiation (20 hours/day) of 11 species of woody plants indicated a decline in the rate of death with increasing exposure time. This suggests that a highly effective repair system may develop, at least in the range of exposure which reduces survival by 50 percent. The inverse relationship previously found between interphase chromosome volume and radiosensitivity for single 16-hour exposures was confirmed for chronic exposures by construction of appropriate regressions. Radiosensitivity of a species can be predicted from these regressions if the interphase chromosome volume is known. The distributions of interphase chromosome volumes and predicted sensitivities are given for 215 species of woody plants."
https://openalex.org/W2002280217,"A mutant form was found in an M(2) population of wheat Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell. (aestivum group) 'Seneca'. The population was derived from soaked grains treated with 3.2 kilorads of gamma rays. The first and second internodes below the spike were reduced in length 33 and 15 percent, respectively, and the total height was 18 percent shorter than the prototype. The flag leaf sheath was normal in length resulting in spike placement below the flag leaf lamina. Segregation data suggest that one dominant gene controls this character. The canopy structure of a population of mutant plants is different from that of the normal type; therefore, this mutant can be used to evaluate light interception and physiological aspects of crop productivity."

https://openalex.org/W1977958955,"This raises a fundamental question about the management, in its largest sense, of the U.S. space program and the other activities undertaken in response to the Sputnik experience. Has the whole operation represented but another highly successful one-shot exercise in crisis management, or has it represented incorporation into American society of a new way to organize, systematically and purposefully, the development and use of scientific and technological resources to the furtherance of national goals? It is too early to discern the answer to this question. But how it is answered will heavily weight any final appraisal of the comparative results of the U.S. and Soviet space programs."
