https://openalex.org/W2409522603,"The formation of thymidine triphosphate in cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli was reported in 1957 to require deoxyuridylate, formaldehyde, dZ,n-tetrahydrofolate, Mg++, and adenosine triphosphate (1). It soon became apparent through use of chromatographic procedures that ATP was not involved in the primary conversion of deoxyuridylate to thymidylate, and that the over-all reaction could be represented as follows."

https://openalex.org/W1969796682,"Estimates of daily total fluid intake and of tap-water consumption of normal children were made in four dissimilar geographic areas in the United States. (Total fluid intake increased and, relatively speaking, tap-water consumption decreased, with age.) Of basic importance in fluoridation programs was the observation that even older children rarely drank as much as 500 ml (about 1 pint) of tap water daily."

https://openalex.org/W2039848390,The effects of deprivation of dietary sodium chloride on operant behavior reinforced by water and sodium chloride were studied. Rats responded at high rates for sodium chloride reinforcements only after they had been fed an inadequate diet for 40 days. These effects were specific to the deprived element of the diet.

The decline in chickens is due to a lowered vascular resistance and blood volume. These circulatory adjustments may be related to the fact that excess heat in birds is dissipated through the respiratory system rather than through the skin."

These results suggest that the repository activity of CI-501 is due to drug release from the injection site and that the probability of toxic effects resulting from storage or accumulation of the drug in vital organs is remote."

https://openalex.org/W2327196609,"SPINAL cord convulsions can be elicited by direct spinal cord stimulation in 1-day-old rats1. In contrast, the tonic–clonic seizure pattern of adult rats produced by electroshock stimulation of the brain2 usually does not appear until the 21st day of age. Thus, the spinal cord matures more rapidly, functionally, than do higher centres of the nervous system."

Methane or P-10 gas (90% argon, 10% methane), passed first into the manometric chamber, then into the counter, completely washes C0/sub 2/ into the counter with the latter at room temperature. Applications in counting C/sup 14/0/sub 2/ are discussed. (C.H.)"

Experimental work revealed that the granulosa cells assume a role in transporting hormonal1–4 and nutritional5 substances towards the oocyte. Furthermore, morphological evidence of a pathway between both was given recently4."
