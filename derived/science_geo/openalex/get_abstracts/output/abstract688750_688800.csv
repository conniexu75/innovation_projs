https://openalex.org/W4212843503,"Germinal centres (GC) are lymphoid structures in which B cells acquire affinity-enhancing somatic hypermutations (SHM), with surviving clones differentiating into memory B cells (MBCs) and long-lived bone marrow plasma cells1-5 (BMPCs). SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination induces a persistent GC response that lasts for at least six months in humans6-8. The fate of responding GC B cells as well as the functional consequences of such persistence remain unknown. Here, we detected SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific MBCs in 42 individuals who had received two doses of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 six month earlier. Spike-specific IgG-secreting BMPCs were detected in 9 out of 11 participants. Using a combined approach of sequencing the B cell receptors of responding blood plasmablasts and MBCs, lymph node GC B cells and plasma cells and BMPCs from eight individuals and expression of the corresponding monoclonal antibodies, we tracked the evolution of 1,540 spike-specific B cell clones. On average, early blood spike-specific plasmablasts exhibited the lowest SHM frequencies. By contrast, SHM frequencies of spike-specific GC B cells increased by 3.5-fold within six months after vaccination. Spike-specific MBCs and BMPCs accumulated high levels of SHM, which corresponded with enhanced anti-spike antibody avidity in blood and enhanced affinity as well as neutralization capacity of BMPC-derived monoclonal antibodies. We report how the notable persistence of the GC reaction induced by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in humans culminates in affinity-matured long-term antibody responses that potently neutralize the virus."
https://openalex.org/W4212845006,"Prevalence of research misconduct, questionable research practices (QRPs) and their associations with a range of explanatory factors has not been studied sufficiently among academic researchers. The National Survey on Research Integrity targeted all disciplinary fields and academic ranks in the Netherlands. It included questions about engagement in fabrication, falsification and 11 QRPs over the previous three years, and 12 explanatory factor scales. We ensured strict identity protection and used the randomized response method for questions on research misconduct. 6,813 respondents completed the survey. Prevalence of fabrication was 4.3% (95% CI: 2.9, 5.7) and of falsification 4.2% (95% CI: 2.8, 5.6). Prevalence of QRPs ranged from 0.6% (95% CI: 0.5, 0.9) to 17.5% (95% CI: 16.4, 18.7) with 51.3% (95% CI: 50.1, 52.5) of respondents engaging frequently in at least one QRP. Being a PhD candidate or junior researcher increased the odds of frequently engaging in at least one QRP, as did being male. Scientific norm subscription (odds ratio (OR) 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.00) and perceived likelihood of detection by reviewers (OR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.88) were associated with engaging in less research misconduct. Publication pressure was associated with more often engaging in one or more QRPs frequently (OR 1.22, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.30). We found higher prevalence of misconduct than earlier surveys. Our results suggest that greater emphasis on scientific norm subscription, strengthening reviewers in their role as gatekeepers of research quality and curbing the ""publish or perish"" incentive system promotes research integrity."
https://openalex.org/W4213062237,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease responsible for millions of deaths worldwide. Effective vaccines against COVID-19 are now available, however, an extreme form of vaccine hesitancy known as anti-vax attitudes challenge vaccine acceptance and distribution efforts. To understand these anti-vax attitudes and their associated psychological characteristics, we examined several predictors of vaccine hesitancy for COVID-19 and anti-vax attitudes generally. We surveyed 1004 adults (M = 47.0 years, SD = 17.1 years, range 18-98 years) in September-October 2020 across the United States (51% female, 49% male; 76.5% White, 23.5% non-White), prior to widespread availability of the COVID-19 vaccines. Attitudes toward vaccinations were influenced by a variety of factors, especially political attitudes. We should therefore anticipate and attempt to mitigate these challenges to achieving widespread vaccination to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and other communicable diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4212910026,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant re-organisation of healthcare delivery in hospitals, with repercussions on all professionals working in healthcare. We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of professionals working in health care institutions and to identify individual and environmental factors influencing the risk of mental health disorders. From 4 June to 22 September 2020, a total of 4370 professionals responded to an online questionnaire evaluating psychological distress, severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms, stress factors, and coping strategies. About 57% of the professionals suffered from psychological distress, and 21% showed symptoms of potential post-traumatic stress. Professionals working in radiology, those working in quality/hygiene/security and nurses' aides were the most affected groups. The media focus on the crisis, and a high workload were the most prevalent stress factors, followed by uncertainty regarding the possibility of containing the epidemic, the constantly changing hygiene recommendations/protocols, and the lack of personal protective equipment. The use of coping strategies, notably positive thinking, helped to mitigate the relation between perceived stress and mental health disorders. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching negative repercussions for all professionals, with some sectors more markedly affected. To prevent mental health disorders in professionals during a public health crisis, support services and management strategies within hospitals should take account of the importance of positive thinking and social support."
https://openalex.org/W4212793572,"The absence of reliable registration of Covid-19 deaths in India has prevented proper assessment and monitoring of the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, India's relatively young age structure tends to conceal the severity of Covid-19 mortality, which is concentrated in older age groups. In this paper, we present four different demographic samples of Indian populations for which we have information on both their demographic structures and death outcomes. We show that we can model the age distribution of Covid-19 mortality in India and use this modeling to estimate Covid-19 mortality in the country. Our findings point to a death toll of approximately 3.2-3.7 million persons by early November 2021. Once India's age structure is factored in, these figures correspond to one of the most severe cases of Covid-19 mortality in the world. India has recorded after February 2021 the second outbreak of coronavirus that has affected the entire country. The accuracy of official statistics of Covid-19 mortality has been questioned, and the real number of Covid-19 deaths is thought to be several times higher than reported. In this paper, we assembled four independent population samples to model and estimate the level of Covid-19 mortality in India. We first used a population sample with the age and sex of Covid-19 victims to develop a Gompertz model of Covid-19 mortality in India. We applied and adjusted this mortality model on two other national population samples after factoring in the demographic characteristics of these samples. We finally derive from these samples the most reasonable estimate of Covid-19 mortality level in India and confirm this result using a fourth population sample. Our findings point to a death toll of about 3.2-3.7 million persons by late May 2021. This is by far the largest number of Covid-19 deaths in the world. Once standardized for age and sex structure, India's Covid-19 mortality rate is above Brazil and the USA. Our analysis shows that existing population samples allow an alternative estimation of deaths due to Covid-19 in India. The results imply that only one out of 7-8 deaths appear to have been recorded as a Covid-19 death in India. The estimates also point to a very high Covid-19 mortality rate, which is even higher after age and sex standardization. The magnitude of the pandemic in India requires immediate attention. In the absence of effective remedies, this calls for a strong response based on a combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions and the scale-up of vaccination to make them accessible to all, with an improved surveillance system to monitor the progression of the pandemic and its spread across India's regions and social groups."
https://openalex.org/W4213065471,"Early stone tools, and in particular sharp stone tools, arguably represent one of the most important technological milestones in human evolution. The production and use of sharp stone tools significantly widened the ecological niche of our ancestors, allowing them to exploit novel food resources. However, despite their importance, it is still unclear how these early lithic technologies emerged and which behaviours served as stepping-stones for the development of systematic lithic production in our lineage. One approach to answer this question is to collect comparative data on the stone tool making and using abilities of our closest living relatives, the great apes, to reconstruct the potential stone-related behaviours of early hominins. To this end, we tested both the individual and the social learning abilities of five orangutans to make and use stone tools. Although the orangutans did not make sharp stone tools initially, three individuals spontaneously engaged in lithic percussion, and sharp stone pieces were produced under later experimental conditions. Furthermore, when provided with a human-made sharp stone, one orangutan spontaneously used it as a cutting tool. Contrary to previous experiments, social demonstrations did not considerably improve the stone tool making and using abilities of orangutans. Our study is the first to systematically investigate the stone tool making and using abilities of untrained, unenculturated orangutans showing that two proposed pre-requisites for the emergence of early lithic technologies-lithic percussion and the recognition of sharp-edged stones as cutting tools-are present in this species. We discuss the implications that ours and previous great ape stone tool experiments have for understanding the initial stages of lithic technologies in our lineage."
https://openalex.org/W4213386231,"We investigate how subjective well-being varied over the course of the global COVID-19 pandemic, with a special attention to periods of lockdown. We use weekly data from YouGov's Great Britain Mood Tracker Poll, and daily reports from Google Trends, that cover the entire period from six months before until eighteen months after the global spread of COVID-19. Descriptive trends and time-series models suggest that negative mood associated with the imposition of lockdowns returned to baseline within 1-3 weeks of lockdown implementation, whereas pandemic intensity, measured by the rate of fatalities from COVID-19 infection, was persistently associated with depressed affect. The results support the hypothesis that country-specific pandemic severity was the major contributor to increases in negative affect observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that lockdowns likely ameliorated rather than exacerbated this effect."
https://openalex.org/W4213238780,"Spinosaurids are some of the most enigmatic Mesozoic theropod dinosaurs due to their unique adaptations to aquatic environments and their relative scarcity. Their taxonomy has proven to be especially problematic. Recent discoveries from Western Europe in general, specifically Iberia, provide some of the best specimens for the understanding of their phylogeny, leading to the description of the spinosaurid Vallibonavenatrix cani and the recognition of the Iberian dinosaur Camarillasaurus cirugedae as one of them. Portuguese associated spinosaurid remains (ML1190) from the Papo Seco Formation (early Barremian) were previously assigned to Baryonyx walkeri but new material recovered in 2020 along with new phylogenetic analyses suggests a different phylogenetic placement, making their revision necessary. Here we show that these remains are not attributable to Baryonyx walkeri, but to a new genus and species, Iberospinus natarioi, gen. et sp. nov. The new taxon is characterized by the presence of a single Meckelian foramen in the Meckelian sulcus, a straight profile of the ventral surface of the dentary and a distal thickening of the acromion process of the pubis between other characters. Iberospinus natarioi is recovered as a sister taxon of the clade formed by Baryonyx and Suchomimus, and outside Spinosaurinae when Vallibonaventrix cani is excluded from the analysis. The description of this taxon reinforces Iberia as a hotspot for spinosaur biodiversity, with several endemic taxa for the region. As expected for the clade, the dentary displays a highly vascularized neurovascular network. The morphometric analysis of parts of the skeleton (pedal phalanx and caudal vertebrae, among others) shows an intermediate condition between basal tetanurans and spinosaurines."
https://openalex.org/W4213112222,"Despite twelve rounds of school-based preventive chemotherapy for schistosomiasis in endemic areas of Tanzania such as Mtama district, Lindi: the burden of Schistosoma haematobium infection has remained highly conceivable due to re-infections. The factors associated with continuity of S.haematobium transmission in Mtama district, Lindi have not been fully established. This study investigated the burden and factors contributing to the ongoing transmission of S.haematobium infection in the endemic district of Mtama, Lindi.A quantitative cross-sectional survey was carried out among 649 school-age children in the Mtama district to determine the burden and factors associated with continuity of S.haematobium infection transmission. A single urine specimen was obtained from each pupil and tested for macro- and microhaematuria, presence of S.haematobium ova, as well intensity of infection; this was complemented with a survey of Bulinus spp snail intermediate hosts and their infectivity. A structured questionnaire was employed to gather information on individual and environmental risk factors for S.haematobium transmission. Summary statistics were computed for individual variables; while a univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between risk factors with S.haematobium infection.Prevalence of S.haematobium infection by macro- and microhaematuria was 13.1% and 46.2% respectively. The prevalence of S.haematobium ova was 52.7%; intensity of infection was light in 53.1%, and heavy in 46.9%. Snail intermediate hosts were Bulinus globosus and B.nasutus, whose infectivity was 2.2% and 1.3%, respectively. Among the assessed risk factors, long residency (10-13 years) in the area was a significant risk factor for the continuity of S.haematobium transmission (AOR: 21.79, 95% CI: 1.37-346.4).The observed 52.7% prevalence of S.haematobium infection represents unacceptably high prevalence after 12 rounds of preventive chemotherapy. Therefore, an urgent need for the implementation of integrated multiple control interventions in the Mtama district; is considered to be imperative."
https://openalex.org/W4211157960,"μ-Conotoxins are components of cone snail venom, well-known for their analgesic activity through potent inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV) subtypes, including NaV1.7. These small, disulfide-rich peptides are typically stabilized by three disulfide bonds arranged in a 'native' CysI-CysIV, CysII-CysV, CysIII-CysVI pattern of disulfide connectivity. However, μ-conotoxin KIIIA, the smallest and most studied μ-conotoxin with inhibitory activity at NaV1.7, forms two distinct disulfide bond isomers during thermodynamic oxidative folding, including Isomer 1 (CysI-CysV, CysII-CysIV, CysIII-CysVI) and Isomer 2 (CysI-CysVI, CysII-CysIV, CysIII-CysV), but not the native μ-conotoxin arrangement. To date, there has been no study on the structure and activity of KIIIA comprising the native μ-conotoxin disulfide bond arrangement. Here, we evaluated the synthesis, potency, sodium channel subtype selectivity, and 3D structure of the three isomers of KIIIA. Using a regioselective disulfide bond-forming strategy, we synthetically produced the three μ-conotoxin KIIIA isomers displaying distinct bioactivity and NaV subtype selectivity across human NaV channel subtypes 1.2, 1.4, and 1.7. We show that Isomer 1 inhibits NaV subtypes with a rank order of potency of NaV1.4 > 1.2 > 1.7 and Isomer 2 in the order of NaV1.4≈1.2 > 1.7, while the native isomer inhibited NaV1.4 > 1.7≈1.2. The three KIIIA isomers were further evaluated by NMR solution structure analysis and molecular docking with hNaV1.2. Our study highlights the importance of investigating alternate disulfide isomers, as disulfide connectivity affects not only the overall structure of the peptides but also the potency and subtype selectivity of μ-conotoxins targeting therapeutically relevant NaV subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W4212793876,"Biofilm-associated infections with Staphylococcus aureus are difficult to treat even after administration of antibiotics that according to the standard susceptibility assays are effective. Currently, the assays used in the clinical laboratories to determine the sensitivity of S. aureus towards antibiotics are not representing the behaviour of biofilm-associated S. aureus, since these assays are performed on planktonic bacteria. In research settings, microcalorimetry has been used for antibiotic susceptibility studies. Therefore, in this study we investigated if we can use isothermal microcalorimetry to monitor the response of biofilm towards antibiotic treatment in real-time. We developed a reproducible method to generate biofilm in an isothermal microcalorimeter setup. Using this system, the sensitivity of 5 methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and 5 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains from different genetic lineages were determined towards: flucloxacillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, gentamicin, rifampicin, vancomycin, levofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, linezolid, fusidic acid, co-trimoxazole, and doxycycline. In contrast to conventional assays, our calorimetry-based biofilm susceptibility assay showed that S. aureus biofilms, regardless MSSA or MRSA, can survive the exposure to the maximum serum concentration of all tested antibiotics. The only treatment with a single antibiotic showing a significant reduction in biofilm survival was rifampicin, yet in 20% of the strains, emerging antibiotic resistance was observed. Furthermore, the combination of rifampicin with flucloxacillin, vancomycin or levofloxacin was able to prevent S. aureus biofilm from becoming resistant to rifampicin. Isothermal microcalorimetry allows real-time monitoring of the sensitivity of S. aureus biofilms towards antibiotics in a fast and reliable way."
https://openalex.org/W4212764148,"Despite their clear lesser vulnerability to COVID-19, the extent by which children are susceptible to getting infected by SARS-CoV-2 and their capacity to transmit the infection to other people remains inadequately characterized. We aimed to evaluate the role of school reopening and the preventive strategies in place at schools in terms of overall risk for children and community transmission, by comparing transmission rates in children as detected by a COVID-19 surveillance platform in place in Catalonian Schools to the incidence at the community level.Infections detected in Catalan schools during the entire first trimester of classes (September-December 2020) were analysed and compared with the ongoing community transmission and with the modelled predicted number of infections. There were 30.486 infections (2.12%) documented among the circa 1.5M pupils, with cases detected in 54.0% and 97.5% of the primary and secondary centres, respectively. During the entire first term, the proportion of ""bubble groups"" (stable groups of children doing activities together) that were forced to undergo confinement ranged between 1 and 5%, with scarce evidence of substantial intraschool transmission in the form of chains of infections, and with ~75% of all detected infections not leading to secondary cases. Mathematical models were also used to evaluate the effect of different parameters related to the defined preventive strategies (size of the bubble group, number of days of confinement required by contacts of an index case). The effective reproduction number inside the bubble groups in schools (R*), defined as the average number of schoolmates infected by each primary case within the bubble, was calculated, yielding a value of 0.35 for primary schools and 0.55 for secondary schools, and compared with the outcomes of the mathematical model, implying decreased transmissibility for children in the context of the applied measures. Relative homogenized monthly cumulative incidence ([Formula: see text]) was assessed to compare the epidemiological dynamics among different age groups and this analysis suggested the limited impact of infections in school-aged children in the context of the overall community incidence.During the fall of 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 cases detected in Catalan schools closely mirrored the underlying community transmission from the neighbourhoods where they were set and maintaining schools open appeared to be safe irrespective of underlying community transmission. Preventive measures in place in those schools appeared to be working for the early detection and rapid containment of transmission and should be maintained for the adequate and safe functioning of normal academic and face-to-face school activities."
https://openalex.org/W4212953007,"Psychoeducational courses focused on positive psychology interventions have been shown to benefit student well-being. However, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying social restrictions, many educators have had to deliver their courses online. Given that online teaching presents a very different university experience for students, do psychoeducational courses provide similar well-being benefits in an online format? In this pre-registered study ( https://osf.io/3f89m ), we demonstrate that despite the challenges of remote learning, first year university students (N = 166) taking an online “Science of Happiness” course during the first term experienced positive benefits to mental well-being in comparison to a wait-list control group (N = 198) registered to take the course in the second term. Specifically, university students currently taking the course maintained their mental well-being over the semester relative to the wait-list control who showed a significant decline in well-being and increase in anxiety during the same period. Our findings suggest that the online-administered “Science of Happiness” course delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a protective effect on mental well-being. We also observed that engagement with the course was high, though there was no evidence that this factor mediated the positive effects we observed. However, we did find evidence that prior interest in increasing well-being influenced the effects of the course; participants with lower well-being interest showed less of a benefit. Our results suggest that online psychoeducational courses might provide a relatively cheap, flexible, and efficient means of providing support as part of an integrated approach to student mental well-being."
https://openalex.org/W4213214481,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is one of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs)as well as a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Around 80% diabetic patients live in low- and middle-income countries. In Bangladesh, there is a scarcity of data on the quality of DM management within health facilities. This study aims to describe service availability and readiness for DM at all tiers of health facilities using the World Health Organization's (WHO) Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) standard tool.This cross-sectional survey was conducted in 266 health facilities all across Bangladesh using the WHO SARA standard tool. Descriptive analyses for the availability of DM services was carried out. Composite scores for facility readiness index (RI) were calculated in four domains: staff and guideline, basic equipment, diagnostic capacity, and essential medicines. Indices were stratified by facility level and a cut off value of 70% was considered as 'ready' to manage diabetes at each facility level.The mean RI score of tertiary and specialized hospitals was above the cutoff value of 70% (RI: 79%), whereas for District Hospitals (DHs), Upazila Health Complexes (UHCs) and NGO and Private hospitals the RI scores were other levels of 65%, 51% and 62% respectively. This indicating that only the tertiary level of health facilities was ready to manage DM. However, it has been observed that the RI scores of the essential medicine domain was low at all levels of health facilities including tertiary-level.The study revealed only tertiary level facilities were ready to manage DM. However, like other facilities, they require an adequate supply of essential medicines. Alongside the inadequate supply of medicines, shortage of trained staff and unavailability of guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of DM also contributed to the low RI score for rest of the facilities."
https://openalex.org/W4213252311,"Detecting and monitoring dental plaque is an important issue in research and clinical practice. In this context, new digital imaging methods that permit permanent documentation of the clinical findings could be promising tools. The aim of the study was therefore to investigate whether disclosed plaque can be reliably visualised on 2D and 3D images captured with digital intraoral imaging devices. Clinical examination was the reference method. Twenty subjects (27.5±1.2 years) were included and plaque was measured at three different stages: habitual plaque (T1), after 72 h without oral hygiene (T2) and after a subsequent habitual brushing exercise (T3). At each time point, plaque was disclosed followed by the clinical examination and capturing the 2D and 3D images (intraoral-camera CS 1500 and intraoral-scanner CS 3600; Carestream Dental, Germany). Plaque amounts were recorded on oral and vestibular surfaces of the Ramfjord-teeth (16, 21, 24, 36, 41, 44) using the Rustogi-modified-Navy-Plaque-Index (RMNPI) and expressed as percentage of plaque-containing RMNPI areas of all RMNPI areas. At T1, percentages (mean±SD) obtained from the clinical examination, 2D and 3D images were 62.2±10.6, 65.1±10.0 and 64.4±10.6 resp. increasing to 76.9±8.0, 77.9±8.6 and 77.5±9.4 resp. at T2. After toothbrushing (T3), values decreased to 56.3±11.1, 58.2±12.1 and 61.2±10.8 resp. All methods were able to show statistically significant changes in plaque amounts at the different time points with in part statistically significant but minor differences between them. The Bland-Altmann analysis revealed a good agreement between values from both 2D and 3D images with the clinical examination. The agreement of the scores obtained with the both image-based methods for the single RMNPI areas with the clinical examination was mainly classified as substantial to almost perfect. Amounts of plaque can be reliably detected and monitored on 2D images from an intraoral camera and on 3D images from an intraoral scanner."
https://openalex.org/W4213330451,"Immune dysregulation can involve invasion and survival of endometrial glands inside the myometrium of the adenomyosis. There is limited available data concerning alterations of the bacterial microbiome in the reproductive tract of adenomyosis women. The present cross-sectional age-matched study aims to compare vaginal microbiota between women with and without adenomyosis. We recruited women with adenomyosis (N = 40) and age-matched women without adenomyosis (N = 40) from the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Ramathibodi Hospital Mahidol University, from August 2020 to January 2021. Vaginal swab samples were collected from the participants. DNA isolation and bacterial 16s rDNA gene sequencing and data analyses were then performed. Comparison of the diversity of vaginal microbiota, microbiota composition, and the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) between adenomyosis and non-adenomyosis (control) groups were undertaken. Data from 40 and 38 women with and without adenomyosis, respectively, were analyzed. Alpha-diversity analysis (Chao1 index) at the species level showed higher vaginal microbial richness in the adenomyosis group when compared with the control group (p = 0.006). The linear discriminant analysis effect size technique (LeFSe) indicated an elevated abundance of several vaginal microbial taxa in the adenomyosis group, including Alloscardovia, Oscillospirales, Ruminoccoccaceae, UCG_002, Oscillospiraceae, Enhydrobacter, Megamonas, Moraxellaceae, Subdoligranulum, Selenomonadaceae, and Faecalibacterium. On the other hand, an increase in the abundance of Megaspehera, Fastidiosipila, Hungateiclostridiaceae, and Clostridia was identified in the control group. Vaginal community state type (CST)-III and -IV were dominated in adenomyosis, while only CST-IV was dominated in the non-adenomyosis group. Lactobacillus was the most abundant vaginal microbial in both groups. In this study, the differences in vaginal microbiome profile were noted between adenomyosis and non-adenomyosis group. The increasing of microbial richness was associated with adenomyosis. Nevertheless, further investigations were required to elucidate the mechanisms and apply them for clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W4226126716,"Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a primary liver cancer that most commonly arises in adolescents and young adults in a background of normal liver tissue and has a poor prognosis due to lack of effective chemotherapeutic agents. The DNAJB1-PRKACA gene fusion (DP) has been reported in the majority of FLC tumors; however, its oncogenic mechanisms remain unclear. Given the paucity of cellular models, in particular FLC tumor cell lines, we hypothesized that engineering the DP fusion gene in HEK293T cells would provide insight into the cellular effects of the fusion gene. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to engineer HEK293T clones expressing DP fusion gene (HEK-DP) and performed transcriptomic, proteomic, and mitochondrial studies to characterize this cellular model. Proteomic analysis of DP interacting partners identified mitochondrial proteins as well as proteins in other subcellular compartments. HEK-DP cells demonstrated significantly elevated mitochondrial fission, which suggests a role for DP in altering mitochondrial dynamics. Transcriptomic analysis of HEK-DP cells revealed a significant increase in LINC00473 expression, similar to what has been observed in primary FLC samples. LINC00473 overexpression was reversible with siRNA targeting of PRKACA as well as pharmacologic targeting of PKA and Hsp40 in HEK-DP cells. Therefore, our model suggests that LINC00473 is a candidate marker for DP activity."
https://openalex.org/W4212772212,"Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) display poor prognosis, have a high risk of tumour recurrence, and exhibit high resistance to drug treatments. Based on their gene expression profiles, the majority of TNBCs are classified as basal-like breast cancers. Currently, there are not available widely-accepted prognostic markers to predict outcomes in basal-like subtype, so the selection of new prognostic indicators for this BC phenotype represents an unmet clinical challenge.Here, we attempted to address this challenging issue by exploiting a bioinformatics pipeline able to integrate transcriptomic, genomic, epigenomic, and clinical data freely accessible from public repositories. This pipeline starts from the application of the well-established network-based SWIM methodology on the transcriptomic data to unveil important (switch) genes in relation with a complex disease of interest. Then, survival and linear regression analyses are performed to associate the gene expression profiles of the switch genes with both the patients' clinical outcome and the disease aggressiveness. This allows us to identify a prognostic gene signature that in turn is fed to the last step of the pipeline consisting of an analysis at DNA level, to investigate whether variations in the expression of identified prognostic switch genes could be related to genetic (copy number variations) or epigenetic (DNA methylation differences) alterations in their gene loci, or to the activities of transcription factors binding to their promoter regions. Finally, changes in the protein expression levels corresponding to the so far identified prognostic switch genes are evaluated by immunohistochemical staining results taking advantage of the Human Protein Atlas.The application of the proposed pipeline on the dataset of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA) patients affected by basal-like subtype led to an in silico recognition of a basal-like specific gene signature composed of 11 potential prognostic biomarkers to be further investigated."

After feeding for 6 hours, B. lactis BL-99 was fully retained in the larval zebrafish intestinal tract and stayed for over 24 hours. B. lactis BL-99 promoted the intestinal motility and effectively alleviated aluminum sulfate-induced larval zebrafish constipation (p < 0.01). Irregular high glucose diet induced adult zebrafish intestinal functional and metabolic disorders. After fed with B. lactis BL-99, IL-1β gene expression was significantly down-regulated, and IL-10 and IL-12 gene levels were markedly up-regulated in this model (p < 0.05). The intestinal lipase activity was elevated in the adult zebrafish intestinal functional disorder model after B. lactis BL-99 treatment (p < 0.05), but tryptase content had no statistical changes (p > 0.05). B. lactis BL-99 improved the histopathology of the adult zebrafish intestinal inflammation, increased the goblet cell numbers, and up-and-down metabolites were markedly recovered after treatment of B. lactis BL-99 (p < 0.05). These results suggest that B. lactis BL-99 could relieve intestinal inflammation and promote intestinal functions, at least in part, through modulating intestinal and microbial metabolism to maintain intestinal health."

This was followed by additional treatment with empagliflozin or glimepiride for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in the FMD measurement (ΔFMDs) at 24 weeks of additional treatment. Secondary outcomes comprised changes in metabolic markers and body composition. The empagliflozin group (n = 33) and glimepiride group (n = 30) showed no significant differences in ΔFMDs (empagliflozin, -0.11 [95%CI: -1.02, 0.80]%; glimepiride, -0.34 [95%CI: -1.28, 0.60]%; P = 0.73). Additionally, changes in glycated hemoglobin were similar between the two groups. However, a significant difference in body weight change was observed (empagliflozin, -0.58 [95%CI: -1.60, 0.43] kg; glimepiride, 1.20 [95%CI: 0.15, 2.26] kg; P = 0.02). Moreover, a body composition analysis revealed that body fluid volume significantly decreased after empagliflozin treatment (baseline, 35.8 ± 6.8 L; after 12 weeks, -0.33 ± 0.72 L; P = 0.03). Hence, although empagliflozin did not improve endothelial function compared with glimepiride for patients with type 2 diabetes, it did decrease body fluid volumes. Thus, the coronary-protective effect of empagliflozin is not derived from endothelial function protection, but rather from heart failure risk reduction. Trial registration: This trial was registered on September 13, 2016; UMIN000024001."
https://openalex.org/W4212828223,"The role played by certain domestic species such as dogs as a translational model in comparative oncology shows great interest to develop new therapeutic strategies in brain tumors. Gliomas are a therapeutic challenge that represents the most common form of malignant primary brain tumors in humans and the second most common form in dogs. Gene-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy using adipose mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) expressing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) has proven to be a promising alternative in glioblastoma therapy, through its capacity to migrate and home to the tumor and delivering local cytotoxicity avoiding other systemic administration. In this study, we demonstrate the possibility for canine Ad-MSCs (cAd-MSCs) to be genetically engineered efficiently with a lentiviral vector to express TK (TK-cAd-MSCs) and in combination with ganciclovir (GCV) prodrug demonstrated its potential antitumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo in a mice model with the human glioblastoma cell line U87. TK-cAd-MSCs maintained cell proliferation, karyotype stability, and MSCs phenotype. Genetic modification significantly affects its secretory profile, both the analyzed soluble factors and exosomes. TK-cAd-MSCs showed a high secretory profile of some active antitumor immune response cytokines and a threefold increase in the amount of secreted exosomes, with changes in their protein cargo. We also found that the prodrug protein is not released directly into the culture medium by TK-cAd-MSCs. We believe that our work provides new perspectives for glioblastoma gene therapy in dogs and a better understanding of this therapy in view of its possible implantation in humans."
https://openalex.org/W4213115234,"When hospitals are at capacity, accurate deterioration indices could help identify low-risk patients as potential candidates for home care programs and alleviate hospital strain. To date, many existing deterioration indices are based entirely on structured data from the electronic health record (EHR) and ignore potentially useful information from other sources.To improve the accuracy of existing deterioration indices by incorporating unstructured imaging data from chest radiographs.Machine learning models were trained to predict deterioration of patients hospitalized with acute dyspnea using existing deterioration index scores and chest radiographs. Models were trained on hospitalized patients without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and then subsequently tested on patients with COVID-19 between January 2020 and December 2020 at a single tertiary care center who had at least one radiograph taken within 48 hours of hospital admission.Patient deterioration was defined as the need for invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, heated high flow nasal cannula, IV vasopressor administration or in-hospital mortality at any time following admission. The EPIC deterioration index was augmented with unstructured data from chest radiographs to predict risk of deterioration. We compared discriminative performance of the models with and without incorporating chest radiographs using area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), focusing on comparing the fraction and total patients identified as low risk at different negative predictive values (NPV).Data from 6278 hospitalizations were analyzed, including 5562 hospitalizations without COVID-19 (training cohort) and 716 with COVID-19 (216 in validation, 500 in held-out test cohort). At a NPV of 0.95, the best-performing image-augmented deterioration index identified 49 more (9.8%) individuals as low-risk compared to the deterioration index based on clinical data alone in the first 48 hours of admission. At a NPV of 0.9, the EPIC image-augmented deterioration index identified 26 more individuals (5.2%) as low-risk compared to the deterioration index based on clinical data alone in the first 48 hours of admission.Augmenting existing deterioration indices with chest radiographs results in better identification of low-risk patients. The model augmentation strategy could be used in the future to incorporate other forms of unstructured data into existing disease models."

We first focus on the detail description of the model, and then we present mathematical analysis of the proposed model, starting from the simplified model without resistance and ending on the full model with two resistance mechanisms present. We make a step towards personalization proposing an underlying tumor growth law base on a cohort of patients from Mayo hospital. We conclude that the model is able to reflect reality, that is in clinical scenarios the level of testosterone in HSPC patients inevitably rises leading to the failure of ADT."

These bivalents are subsequently separated in the first meiotic division. In a mutant lacking the newly identified Tetrahymena gene APRO1 (Anaphase promoting 1), meiosis is arrested by the end of prophase. Mature chiasmata are not formed but bivalents are connected via a molecular precursor structure. In-depth analysis of this arrested intermediate structure may help to elucidate the noncanonical molecular recombination pathway in Tetrahymena."
https://openalex.org/W4212999182,"The survival rate of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients with secondary primary malignancy (SPM) showed no significant improvement for decades, however, the impact of advances in diagnostic tools is rarely mentioned. This study investigated the clinical characteristic of HNSCC with SPM over a 27-year period especially from the perspective of diagnostic tools.This study evaluated 157 HNSCC patients with SPM. The patients were divided into two groups according to the time of SPM diagnosis (Group A:1992-2003; Group B: 2004-2014). Age, gender, stage of first primary malignancy (FPM), SPM interval, overall survival, and disease-free survival were compared between groups.Group B had significantly more SPM developed rate (p = 0.002), more SPM patients with advanced stage of FPM (p = 0.001), synchronous SPM (p = 0.006), and shorter SPM interval (p<0.001) compared to Group A. The survival rate in Group B was not significantly better than Group A.Among patients diagnosed with HNSCC recently, more SPMs are diagnosed in a shorter time interval and in a more advanced stage. The overall advances in diagnostic tools cannot significantly improve SPM survival, however, it enables more patients to receive corresponding treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4213073115,"Nurse educators and nurse preceptors play a fundamental role in facilitating nursing students' acquisition and utilization of professional competencies. Previous studies about key elements for teaching and learning about pain in nursing education programs include students' personal characteristics and previous experiences; educators' knowledge, skills, and beliefs; learners' exposure to leaders in pain education; and curricular pain content and delivery approaches. These studies were mainly carried out in developed countries, with a context of educational and health care systems different from those of developing countries. The current study explores academics', clinical nurse preceptors', and nursing students' perceptions about factors influencing the facilitation of nursing students' competency for paediatric pain management in Rwanda. A qualitative descriptive exploratory design was used in this study that utilized in-depth interviews with six nurse educators and eight nurse preceptors, and focus group discussions with nineteen senior year nursing students. The study setting included five sites: two academic institutions and three clinical settings. Narratives from participants were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. The analysis yielded six themes describing factors that affected the facilitation of students' learning about paediatric pain management. The themes included student motivation, facilitators' attributes, collaboration between academics and clinicians, nurses' limited autonomy for decision-making regarding PPM practices, shortage of human and material resources, and educational qualification. Knowing these factors is essential as it provides an opportunity to design targeted interventions aimed to enhance the capacity of nurse educators and clinical nurse preceptors involved in teaching nursing students about paediatric pain management."
https://openalex.org/W4213081220,"Older individuals with chronic health conditions are at highest risk of adverse clinical outcomes from COVID-19, but there is widespread belief that risk to younger, relatively lower-risk individuals is negligible. We assessed the rate and predictors of life-threatening complications among relatively lower-risk adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Of 3766 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 to three hospitals in New York City from March to May 2020, 963 were relatively lower-risk based on absence of preexisting health conditions. Multivariable logistic regression models examined in-hospital development of life-threatening complications (major medical events, intubation, or death). Covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, hypertension, weight, insurance type, and area-level sociodemographic factors (poverty, crowdedness, and limited English proficiency). In individuals ≥55 years old (n = 522), 33.3% experienced a life-threatening complication, 17.4% were intubated, and 22.6% died. Among those <55 years (n = 441), 15.0% experienced a life-threatening complication, 11.1% were intubated, and 5.9% died. In multivariable analyses among those ≥55 years, age (OR 1.03 [95%CI 1.01-1.06]), male sex (OR 1.72 [95%CI 1.14-2.64]), being publicly insured (versus commercial insurance: Medicare, OR 2.02 [95%CI 1.22-3.38], Medicaid, OR 1.87 [95%CI 1.10-3.20]) and living in areas with relatively high limited English proficiency (highest versus lowest quartile: OR 3.50 [95%CI 1.74-7.13]) predicted life-threatening complications. In those <55 years, no sociodemographic factors significantly predicted life-threatening complications. A substantial proportion of relatively lower-risk patients hospitalized with COVID-19 experienced life-threatening complications and more than 1 in 20 died. Public messaging needs to effectively convey that relatively lower-risk individuals are still at risk of serious complications."
https://openalex.org/W4213169777,"Healthcare outpatient visits have increased in recent years, and young adults are often given as an explanatory factor for many avoidable visits.The objective of this study was to explore how young adults perceive seeking first-line healthcare.The study utilized a grounded theory design with data collection at primary healthcare centres and emergency departments in southeast Sweden.Data were collected during individual interviews and patient observations with subsequent interviews during the years 2017-2018. The analysis was performed using grounded theory.The main concern when young adults are seeking healthcare is that their worries are taken seriously. It is a four-part process: becoming aware of, verifying, communicating, and receiving an opinion about one's symptoms. The process includes external factors, clarity of symptoms, behavioural approaches, healthcare know-how, enabling self-management, and prior healthcare experience(s). When communicating symptoms, the clearer the symptoms, the less there needs to be communicated. When symptoms are unclear, the importance of different behavioural approaches and healthcare know-how increases. When receiving a medical opinion about symptoms, young adults want to learn how to self-manage their symptoms. Depending on previous healthcare experience, the healthcare visit can either harm or help the patient in their healthcare-seeking process.This study reflects several insights in the healthcare-seeking process from a young adult perspective. Based on the results, we suggest that healthcare providers focus on the final step in the healthcare-seeking process when giving their medical opinion about symptoms. Having extra minutes to give support for future self-care regardless of diagnosis could increase positive healthcare experiences and increase future self-care among young adults."
https://openalex.org/W4213248245,"The world is experiencing one of the most severe viral outbreaks in the last few years, the pandemic infection by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 disease. As of December 10th 2021, the virus has spread worldwide, with a total number of more than 267 million of confirmed cases (four times more in the last year), and more than 5 million deaths. A great effort has been undertaken to molecularly characterize the virus, track the spreading of different variants across the globe with the aim to understand the potential effects in terms of transmission capability and different fatality rates. Here we focus on the genomic diversity and distribution of the virus in the early stages of the pandemic, to better characterize the origin of COVID-19 and to define the geographical and temporal evolution of genetic clades. By performing a comparative analysis of 75401 SARS-CoV-2 reported sequences (as of December 2020), using as reference the first viral sequence reported in Wuhan in December 2019, we described the existence of 26538 genetic variants, the most frequent clustering into four major clades characterized by a specific geographical distribution. Notably, we found the most frequent variant, the previously reported missense p.Asp614Gly in the S protein, as a single mutation in only three patients, whereas in the large majority of cases it occurs in concomitance with three other variants, suggesting a high linkage and that this variant alone might not provide a significant selective advantage to the virus. Moreover, we evaluated the presence and the distribution in our dataset of the mutations characterizing the so called ""british variant"", identified at the beginning of 2021, and observed that 9 out of 17 are present only in few sequences, but never in linkage with each other, suggesting a synergistic effect in this new viral strain. In summary, this is a large-scale analysis of SARS-CoV-2 deposited sequences, with a particular focus on the geographical and temporal evolution of genetic clades in the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4213272094,"In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) which contains the greatest area of the second largest rainforest on Earth, people have long been connected to the forest for subsistence and livelihood from wild animals and bushmeat. This qualitative study sought to characterize the bushmeat movement-from hunting wild animals to market sale-and the roles of participants in the animal value chain, as well as their beliefs surrounding zoonotic disease and occupational risk. Actors in in eight bushmeat markets and two ports in Kinshasa, DRC completed semi-structured interviews between 2016 and 2018 in which they expressed belief in transmission of illness from domestic animals to humans, but not from wild animals to humans. Wild animals were viewed as pure and natural, in contrast to domestic animals which were considered tainted by human interference. Participants reported cutting themselves during the process of butchering yet did not consider butchering bushmeat to be a risky activity. Instead, they adopted safety practices learned over time from butchering experts and taught themselves how to butcher in a fashion that reduced the frequency of cutting. In general, butcherers rejected the idea of personal protective equipment use. Port markets were identified as important access points for meat coming from the Congo river and plane transport was identified as important for fresh and live meat coming from Équateur province. Most participants reported having heard about Ebola, but their mistrust in government messaging privileged a word-of-mouth story of witchcraft to be propagated about Ebola's origins. It is critical to better understand how public health messaging about outbreaks can successfully reach high risk communities, and to develop creative risk mitigation strategies for populations in regular contact with animal blood and body fluids. In this paper, we offer suggestions for formal and informal trusted channels through which health messages surrounding zoonotic risk could be conveyed to high-risk populations in Kinshasa."
https://openalex.org/W4212895553,"Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is a common cancer of which mortality is increasing continuously. Our study conducted a series of analyses on the clinical significance of Serine/threonine kinase 17B (STK17B) in SKCM to provide a new biomarker for diagnosis and treatment. The RNA-sequence data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression databases. The data of 468 SKCM patients were divided into STK17B high- and low-expression groups and analyzed by Bioconductor package to identify the differential expressed genes. The R package of “clusterProfiler” was used for Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis analyses. A protein-protein interaction network and immune infiltration landscape were respectively constructed via STRING database and ssGSEA. STK17B had lower expression in SKCM than normal tissues. Besides, STK17B expression was significantly related to some clinicopathological characteristics in SKCM patients including T stage, Breslow depth, radiation therapy, melanoma Clark level, and pathologic stage. The Kaplan-Meier curve analyses revealed that the low expression of STK17B was correlated with poor overall survival and disease-specific survival. We constructed nomograms to predict the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival of SKCM patients. The function enrichment analyses showed STK17B-related differential expressed genes were enriched in cellular differentiation and immune-related progress. STK17B expression level were positively correlated with infiltrating level of immune cells. In this study, we found that STK17B, which played an important role in immune infiltration, could be a new biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in SKCM patients."
https://openalex.org/W4212896938,"Background The Brief Measure of Emotional Preoperative Stress (B-MEPS) was developed to evaluate the preoperative individual vulnerability to emotional stress. To obtain a refined version of B-MEPS suitable for an app approach, this study aimed: (i) to identify items with more discriminant properties; (ii) to classify the level of preoperative emotional stress based on cut-off points; (iii) to assess concurrent validity through correlation with the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) score; (iv) to confirm whether the refined version of B-MEPS is an adequate predictive measure for identification of patients prone to intense postoperative pain. Methods We include 1016 patients who had undergone surgical procedures in a teaching hospital. The generalized partial credit model of item response theory and latent class model were employed, respectively, to reduce the number of items and to create cut-off points. We applied the CSI and assessed pain by Visual Analog Scale (0–10) and by the amount of postoperative morphine consumption. Results The refined B-MEPS shows satisfactory reliability (Cronbach’s alpha 0.79). Preoperative emotional stress, according to the cut-off points, is classified into categories: low, intermediate or high stress. The refined B-MEPS exhibited a linear association with the CSI scores (r2 = 0.53, p &lt; 0.01). Patients with higher levels of emotional stress displayed a positive association with moderate to severe pain and greater morphine consumption. Conclusion The refined version of B-MEPS, along with an interface of easy applicability, assess emotional vulnerability at the bedside before surgery. This app may support studies focused on intervening with perioperative stress levels."

The incidence of this disease was growing exponentially and affects millions of the world population that leads to expose thousands of peoples for death. Thus, this study was targeted to assess the practice of people on COVID-19 infections prevention strategies in the region.A community based cross sectional study design was conducted in Benishangul Gumuz Region from May 25 -June 15, 2020. Multistage sampling technique was carried out to select 21 kebeles/ketena and 422 study participants. Data were collected by face to face interview using semi-structured questionnaires. The collected data were entered, cleaned and analyzed using STATA software version 14.0. Descriptive, bi-variable and multivariable multilevel models were applied. Variables with p value < 0.25 in bi-variable analysis were selected as candidates for multivariable analysis. Finally, the variables with p-value < 0.5 were considered as statistically significant, then variables with odds ratio, 95% CI were used to interpret the effect of association.The magnitude of good practice on prevention strategies of COVID- 19 infections was 62.1%. The most frequently practiced prevention strategies for COVID-19 infections were hand washing with water and soap (80.7%), alcohol-based hand rub (68.8%), maintaining social/physical distance (74.2%) and avoiding touching eyes. Individual and community level factors that affecting practice of COVID- 19 infection prevention strategies were discovered. Hence, community level factor was place of origin (AOR = 0.1; 95%CI: 0.03, 0.35) whereas individual level factors were able to read and write (AOR = 0.18; 95%CI: 0.04, 0.81) and being merchant (AOR = 2.07; 95%CI: 1.01, 4.28).The level of practice of community towards COVID-19 infections prevention strategies were low as compared with the expected outcome. Individual and community level factors were identified. This implies that social mobilization and community engagement was not effective. Thus, designing appropriate strategies to improve of practice prevention strategies are strongly recommend."
https://openalex.org/W4213021402,"Background The therapeutic landscape for spinal muscular atrophy has changed in the last few years, encompassing respiratory/motor function and life expectancy benefits. However, physicians still have the challenge of tailoring individuals’ treatment to therapeutic goals, disease progression, patient/caregiver’s preferences, and personal experience to achieve an optimal risk/benefit balance. This study aims to provide insight into the preferred treatment choices of pediatric neurologists managing spinal muscular atrophy in their daily practice and to recognize behavioral factors that may influence decision-making. Methods This is a noninterventional, cross-sectional pilot study involving 50 pediatric neurologists managing spinal muscular atrophy in Spain. We designed an online platform that contains 13 simulated case scenarios of common presentations of patients with spinal muscular atrophy. The primary study outcome will be treatment preferences according to the percentages of participants who select treatment initiation when recommended, switch therapies when there is evidence of disease progression, and select treatment discontinuation when disease progression puts patients outside treatment recommendation (11 case scenarios). Secondary outcomes include therapeutic inertia prevalence (11 case scenarios), herding phenomenon prevalence (2 case scenarios), care-related regret prevalence (specific questions) and intensity (10-item Regret Intensity Scale), occupational burnout prevalence (nonproprietary single-item measure), and risk preferences (uncertainty test and risk aversion assessment). Conclusions The study findings will contribute to better understand relevant factors associated with therapeutic decisions of pediatric neurologists in spinal muscular atrophy, identifying treatment preferences and evaluating the role of behavioral aspects such as therapeutic inertia, herding, regret, and workplace burnout."

Objective—to compare different extraction methods for total lipids and to evaluate the effect of these methodologies on the quantitative composition of fatty acids in milk of lactating ewes raised in tropical pastures. The methodologies used were simple direct transesterification, using the HPLC grade organic solvent n-hexane, Bligh; Dyer (cold extraction, extracting mixture proportions 5, 10, and 15 mL in a ratio of 2:1:1 (v/v/v) of chloroform-methanol-water). The fatty acid methyl esters were separated by gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The results show that there was no significant difference (p &lt;0.05) in the total lipid content between the extraction methods. However, the Bligh’s method; Dyer obtained the best yield of lipids to be extracted from ewe’s milk, since the volume with 15 mL of the extraction solution was able to identify 87% of the chromatographic peaks. It was also observed that ewe’s milk has a higher percentage of palmitic, stearic and oleic fatty acids, with percentages of 20.1%, 15.5% and 33.1%, respectively. Therefore, an extraction mixture with a volume of 15 mL used in this study may be an alternative to perform the extraction of milk fat from high lactating ewes in tropical pastures as a routine method, as it expresses the best lipid content of this food."

Working individuals in same-sex couples are significantly less likely to drive to work than working men and women in different-sex couples. This gap is particularly stark among men: on average, almost 12 percentage point (or 13%) lower likelihood of driving to work for men in same-sex couples. Working individuals in same-sex couples are also more likely to use public transport, walk, or bike to work. Men and women are 7 and 3 percentage points more likely, respectively, to take public transportation to work than those in different-sex couples. Working men are also more likely to work from home–while working women are less likely–than those in different-sex couples. These differences persist after controlling for demographic characteristics, partner’s characteristics, location, fertility, marital status, occupation or industry, and family income. Additional evidence from the General Social Survey 2008–2018 suggests that these disparities by sexual orientation may be due to lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals valuing the environment more than straight individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4213223771,"Due to the circumstances of their early lives, young refugees are at risk of experiencing adverse labour market and health outcomes. The post-settlement environment is thought to play a decisive role in determining how this vulnerability plays out. This study compared trends in labour market marginalisation in young refugees and their majority peers during early adulthood in two national contexts, Denmark and Sweden, and explored the mediating role of common mental disorders and secondary school completions.Using registry data, 13,390/45,687 refugees were included in Denmark/Sweden and 1:5 matched to majority peers. Inequalities in labour market marginalisation were investigated during 2012-2015 in each country using linear probability models and mediation analysis. Country trends were standardised to account for differences in observed population characteristics.The risk of marginalisation was 2.1-2.3 times higher among young refugees compared with their majority peers, but the risk decreased with age in Sweden and increased in Denmark for refugees. Birth-cohort differences drove the increase in Denmark, while trends were consistent across birth-cohorts in Sweden. Differences in population characteristics did not contribute to country differences. Common mental disorders did not mediate the inequality in either country, but secondary school completions did (77-85% of associations eliminated).The findings document both the vulnerability of young refugees to labour market marginalisation and the variability in this vulnerability across post-settlement contexts. While the contrast in policy climates in Denmark and Sweden sharpened over time, the risk of marginalisation appeared more similar in younger cohorts, pointing to the importance of factors other than national immigration and integration policies. Institutional efforts to assist young refugees through secondary education are likely to have long-lasting consequences for their socio-economic trajectories."
https://openalex.org/W4213334408,"There is a substantial geographical variation in the rates of pacemaker (PM), implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device implantation across European countries. We assessed the extent of regional variation and potential determinants of such variation.We conducted a population-based analysis using discharge data for PM/ICD/CRT implantations from all Swiss acute care hospitals during 2013-2016. We derived hospital service areas (HSA) by analyzing patient flows. We calculated age- and sex-standardized rates and quantified variation using the extremal quotient (EQ) and the systemic component of variation (SCV). We estimated the reduction in variance of crude implantation rates across HSAs using multilevel regression models, with incremental adjustment for age and sex, language, socioeconomic factors, population health, diabetes mellitus, and the density of cardiologists on the HSA level.We analyzed implantations of 8129 PM, 1461 ICD, and 1411 CRT from 25 Swiss HSAs. The mean age- and sex-standardized implantation rate was 29 (range 8-57) per 100,000 persons for PM, 5 (1-9) for ICD, and 5 (2-8) for CRT. There was a very high variation in PM (EQ 7.0; SCV 12.6) and ICD (EQ 7.2; SCV 11.3) and a high variation in CRT implantation rates (EQ 3.9; SCV 7.1) across HSAs. Adjustments for age and sex, language, socioeconomic factors, population health, diabetes mellitus, and density of cardiologists explained 94% of the variance in ICD and 87.5% of the variance in CRT implantation rates, but only 36.3% of the variance in PM implantation rates. Women had substantially lower PM/ICD/CRT implantation rates than men.Switzerland has a very high regional variation in PM/ICD implantation and a high variation in CRT implantation rates. Women had substantially lower implantation rates than men. A large share of the variation in PM procedure rates remained unexplained which might reflect variations in physicians' preferences and practices."
https://openalex.org/W4213334905,"Background Overweight/obesity is a well-defined risk factor for a variety of chronic cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Sleep duration has been associated with overweight/obesity and other cardio metabolic and neurocognitive problems. Notably, overweight/obesity and many of the associated comorbidities are prevalent in Indigenous Australians. Generally, sleep duration has been associated with BMI for Australian adults but information about Australian Indigenous adults’ sleep is scant. A recent report established that sleep is a weak predictor of obesity for Indigenous Australian adults. Aim To determine whether sleep remains a predictor of obesity when physical activity, diet and smoking status are accounted for; and to determine whether sleep duration plays a mediating role in the relationship between Indigenous status and BMI. Methods Statistical analyses of 5,886 Australian adults: 5236 non-Indigenous and 650 Indigenous people aged over 18 years who participated in the Australian Health Survey 2011–2013. Demographic and lifestyle characteristics were described by χ 2 and t-tests. ANOVA was used to determine the variables that significantly predicted BMI and sleep duration. Stepwise regression analyses were performed to determine the strongest significant predictors of BMI. Sleep duration was self-reported; BMI was calculated from measurement. Results The study revealed two main findings: (i) short sleep duration was an independent predictor of obesity (adjusted- R 2 = 0.056, p &lt;0.0001); and (ii) controlling for sleep duration and other possible confounders, Indigenous status was a significant predictor of BMI overweight/obesity. Sleep duration played a weak, partial mediator role in this relationship. Increased BMI was associated with lower socioeconomic status and level of disadvantage of household locality for non-remote Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Conclusion Indigenous status strongly predicted increased BMI. The effect was not mediated by the socioeconomic indicators but was partially mediated by sleep duration."
https://openalex.org/W4213371371,"The Non-adherence Academic Research Consortium (NARC) has recently developed a consensus-based standardized classification for medication non-adherence in cardiovascular clinical trials. We aimed to assess the prevalence of NARC-defined self-reported non-adherence to P2Y12 inhibitors and its impact on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).Using a standardized questionnaire administered at 1 year after PCI, we assessed the 4 NARC-defined non-adherence levels including type, decision-maker, reasons, and timing within the Bern PCI registry. The primary endpoint was the patient-oriented composite endpoint (POCE) defined as a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and any revascularization at 1 year. The recommended P2Y12 inhibitor duration was 12 months. Among 3,896 patients, P2Y12 inhibitor non-adherence was observed in 647 (17%) patients. Discontinuation was permanent in the majority of patients (84%). The decision was mainly driven by a physician (94%), and rarely by patients (6%). The most frequent reason was risk profile change (43%), followed by unlisted reasons (25%), surgery (17%), and adverse events (14%). Non-adherence occurred early (<30 days) in 21%, late (30-180 days) in 45%, and very late (>180 days) in 33%. The majority of POCE events (n = 421/502, 84%) occurred during adherence to the prescribed P2Y12 inhibitor. Permanent discontinuation, doctor-driven non-adherence, and risk profile change emerged as independent predictors for POCE.In real-world PCI population treated with 1-year DAPT, non-adherence was observed in nearly one-fifth of patients. Non-adherence to P2Y12 inhibitors was associated with worse clinical outcomes, while the risk was related to underlying contexts.NCT02241291."
https://openalex.org/W4212812988,"Understanding how we see the world is different from how other people see it is a crucial part of social cognition and is known as visual perspective-taking. Although previous studies have demonstrated that 14-month-old infants have the capacity to compute the visual perspectives of others, it remains unknown whether infants under 12 months also have this ability. In this study, we modified a conventional gaze-following experimental setting in which one toy was placed in front of a model and was hidden by a barrier (Blocked Line of Sight Condition), and another toy was placed without a barrier (Clear Line of Sight Condition). We examined the visual perspective-taking abilities of 48 infants aged 7 and 12 months by measuring the infants' gaze shift towards the gaze-cued toy object with and without a barrier. The results demonstrated that 12-month-old infants could correctly follow a model's gaze if the model's line of sight was clear. In contrast, 7-month-old infants showed no evidence of such capacity. Our findings indicate that 12-month-old infants seem to have the capacity to compute the visual perspective of others."

https://openalex.org/W4213159005,"Mineral soda alumina (m-Na-Al) glass is a common glass production group found around the Indo-Pacific region. In Iron Age Taiwan, its presence dates back to the early 1st millennium AD. This research discusses m-Na-Al glass beads excavated from Iron Age sites in Taiwan. No production sites for m-Na-Al have been found, but microstructural analysis suggests m-Na-Al glass appears to originate around South Asia and is exchanged widely. SEM-EDS and EPMA were used to analyse red, orange, yellow, green and blue m-Na-Al glass. The microstructure of the glass shows the presence of plagioclase and alkali feldspar relics in the glass, suggesting a low manufacturing temperature. Copper-based colourants are identified in red, orange, blue and green glass, while lead tin oxide is used in yellow and green glass. It appears that various types of copper-containing raw materials were procured by craftspeople, and a self-reduction process for producing red and orange glass is tentatively proposed. Additionally, the microstructure of yellow glass reveals different colouring paths were used. These results increase our understanding of the selection of raw materials, and provide an impetus for further research on the cross craft interaction between glass and copper production."
https://openalex.org/W4213316324,"There is an increasing number of cancer patients undertaking treatment-focused genetic testing despite not having a strong family history or high a priori risk of being carriers because of the decreasing cost of genetic testing and development of new therapies. There are limited studies on the psychosocial outcome of a positive result among breast cancer patients who are at low a priori risk, particularly in women of Asian descent. Breast cancer patients enrolled under the Malaysian Breast Cancer Genetic Study between October 2002 and February 2018 were tested for BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2 genes. All 104 carriers identified were invited by a research genetic counsellor for result disclosure. Of the 104 carriers, 64% (N = 66) had low a priori risk as determined by PENN II scores. Psychosocial, risk perception and health behaviour measures survey were conducted at baseline (pre-result disclosure), and at two to six weeks after result disclosure. At baseline, younger carriers with high a priori risk had higher Cancer Worry Scale scores than those with low a priori risk but all scores were within acceptable range. Around 75% and 55% of high a priori risk carriers as well as 80% and 67% of low a priori risk carriers had problems in the ""living with cancer"" and ""children"" psychosocial domains respectively. All carriers regardless of their a priori risk demonstrated an improved risk perception that also positively influenced their intent to undergo risk management procedures. This study has shown that with sufficient counselling and support, low a priori risk carriers are able to cope psychologically, have improved perceived risk and increased intent for positive health behaviour despite having less anticipation from a family history prior to knowing their germline carrier status."
https://openalex.org/W4213364639,"In this study, to investigate whether infants showed face-specific brain activity to a cartoon human face, we conducted a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) experiment and a behavioral experiment. In the fNIRS experiment, we measured the hemodynamic responses of 5- and 6-month-old infants to cartoon female and cartoon character faces using fNIRS. The results showed that the concentration of oxy-Hb increased for cartoon female faces but not for cartoon character faces. This indicates that face-specific brain activity occurred for cartoon female faces but not cartoon character faces, despite the fact that both are faces. In the behavioral experiment, we examined whether the 5- and 6-month-old infants preferred cartoon female faces to cartoon character faces in the upright and inverted conditions. The results showed a preference for cartoon female faces in the upright but not in the inverted condition. This indicates that 5- and 6-month-old infants can perceive cartoon female faces, but not cartoon character faces, as faces. The results of the two experiments indicated that face-specific brain activity occurred for cartoon female faces. This indicates that infants can perceive cartoon female faces as faces."
