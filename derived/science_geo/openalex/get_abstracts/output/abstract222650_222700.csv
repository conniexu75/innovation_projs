https://openalex.org/W2149507322,"Climate change over the past ∼30 years has produced numerous shifts in the distributions and abundances of species1,2 and has been implicated in one species-level extinction3. Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20% of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15–37% of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be ‘committed to extinction’. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction (∼18%) than mid-range (∼24%) and maximum-change (∼35%) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration."

https://openalex.org/W2015776459,"Primary T-cell responses in lymph nodes (LNs) require contact-dependent information exchange between T cells and dendritic cells (DCs). Because lymphocytes continually enter and leave normal LNs, the resident lymphocyte pool is composed of non-synchronized cells with different dwell times that display heterogeneous behaviour in mouse LNs in vitro. Here we employ two-photon microscopy in vivo to study antigen-presenting DCs and naive T cells whose dwell time in LNs was synchronized. During the first 8 h after entering from the blood, T cells underwent multiple short encounters with DCs, progressively decreased their motility, and upregulated activation markers. During the subsequent 12 h T cells formed long-lasting stable conjugates with DCs and began to secrete interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma. On the second day, coinciding with the onset of proliferation, T cells resumed their rapid migration and short DC contacts. Thus, T-cell priming by DCs occurs in three successive stages: transient serial encounters during the first activation phase are followed by a second phase of stable contacts culminating in cytokine production, which makes a transition into a third phase of high motility and rapid proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2071215075,"Sleep is present in all species where it has been studied, but its functions remain unknown. To investigate what benefits sleep may bring at the cellular level, we profiled gene expression in awake and sleeping rats by using high-density microarrays. We find that approximately 10% of the transcripts in the cerebral cortex change their expression between day and night and demonstrate that half of them are modulated by sleep and wakefulness independent of time of day. We also show that molecular correlates of sleep are found in the cerebellum, a structure not known for generating sleep rhythms. Finally, we show that different functional categories of genes are selectively associated with sleep and wakefulness. The approximately 100 known genes whose expression increases during sleep provide molecular support for the proposed involvement of sleep in protein synthesis and neural plasticity and point to a novel role for sleep in membrane trafficking and maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2011303819,"beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the beta-secretase enzyme required for generating pathogenic beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides in Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACE1 knockout mice lack Abeta and are phenotypically normal, suggesting that therapeutic inhibition of BACE1 may be free of mechanism-based side effects. However, direct evidence that BACE1 inhibition would improve cognition is lacking. Here we show that BACE1 null mice engineered to overexpress human APP (BACE1(-/-).Tg2576(+)) are rescued from Abeta-dependent hippocampal memory deficits. Moreover, impaired hippocampal cholinergic regulation of neuronal excitability found in the Tg2576 AD model is ameliorated in BACE1(-/-).Tg2576(+) bigenic mice. The behavioral and electrophysiological rescue of deficits in BACE1(-/-).Tg2576(+) mice is correlated with a dramatic reduction of cerebral Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels and occurs before amyloid deposition in Tg2576 mice. Our gene-based approach demonstrates that lower Abeta levels are beneficial for AD-associated memory impairments, validating BACE1 as a therapeutic target for AD."
https://openalex.org/W2023441280,"Reelin is a secreted glycoprotein that regulates neuronal positioning in cortical brain structures through the VLDLR and ApoER2 receptors and the adaptor protein Dab1. In addition to cellular disorganization, dendrite abnormalities are present in the brain of reeler mice lacking Reelin. It is unclear whether these defects are due primarily to cellular ectopia or the absence of Reelin. Here we examined dendrite development in the hippocampus of normal and mutant mice and in dissociated cultures. We found that dendrite complexity is severely reduced in homozygous mice deficient in Reelin signaling both in vivo and in vitro, and it is also reduced in heterozygous mice in the absence of cellular ectopia. Addition of Reelin interfering antibodies, receptor antagonists, and Dab1 phosphorylation inhibitors prevented dendrite outgrowth from normal neurons, whereas addition of recombinant Reelin rescued the deficit in reeler cultures. Thus, the same signaling pathway controls both neuronal migration and dendrite maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1971374859,"The life span of C. elegans is extended by mutations that inhibit the function of sensory neurons. In this study, we show that specific subsets of sensory neurons influence longevity. We find that certain gustatory neurons inhibit longevity, whereas others promote longevity, most likely by influencing insulin/IGF-1 signaling. Olfactory neurons also influence life span, and they act in a distinct pathway that involves the reproductive system. In addition, we find that a putative chemosensory G protein-coupled receptor that is expressed in some of these sensory neurons inhibits longevity. Together our findings imply that the life span of C. elegans is regulated by environmental cues and that these cues are perceived and integrated in a complex and sophisticated fashion by specific chemosensory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2146267034,"The ventral premotor cortex (VPC) is involved in the transformation of sensory information into action, although the exact neuronal operation is not known. We addressed this problem by recording from single neurons in VPC while trained monkeys report a decision based on the comparison of two mechanical vibrations applied sequentially to the fingertips. Here we report that the activity of VPC neurons reflects current and remembered sensory inputs, their comparison, and motor commands expressing the result; that is, the entire processing cascade linking the evaluation of sensory stimuli with a motor report. These findings provide a fairly complete panorama of the neural dynamics that underlies the transformation of sensory information into an action and emphasize the role of VPC in perceptual decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2049500340,"The massive star that underwent a collapse of its core to produce supernova (SN)1993J was subsequently identified as a non-variable red supergiant star in images of the galaxy M81 taken before explosion. It showed an excess in ultraviolet and B-band colours, suggesting either the presence of a hot, massive companion star or that it was embedded in an unresolved young stellar association. The spectra of SN1993J underwent a remarkable transformation from the signature of a hydrogen-rich type II supernova to one of a helium-rich (hydrogen-deficient) type Ib. The spectral and photometric peculiarities were best explained by models in which the 13-20 solar mass supergiant had lost almost its entire hydrogen envelope to a close binary companion, producing a 'type IIb' supernova, but the hypothetical massive companion stars for this class of supernovae have so far eluded discovery. Here we report photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN1993J ten years after the explosion. At the position of the fading supernova we detect the unambiguous signature of a massive star: the binary companion to the progenitor."

https://openalex.org/W1984596133,"N-type calcium channels are critical for pain transduction. Inhibitors of these channels are powerful analgesics, but clinical use of current N-type blockers remains limited by undesirable actions in other regions of the nervous system. We now demonstrate that a unique splice isoform of the N-type channel is restricted exclusively to dorsal root ganglia. By a combination of functional and molecular analyses at the single-cell level, we show that the DRG-specific exon, e37a, is preferentially present in CaV2.2 mRNAs expressed in neurons that contain nociceptive markers, VR1 and NaV1.8. Cell-specific inclusion of exon 37a correlates closely with significantly larger N-type currents in nociceptive neurons. This unique splice isoform of the N-type channel could represent a novel target for pain management."

https://openalex.org/W1966149222,"The human telomeric protein POT1 is known to bind single-stranded telomeric DNA in vitro and to participate in the regulation of telomere maintenance by telomerase in vivo. We examined the in vitro DNA binding features of POT1. We report that deleting the oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding fold of POT1 abrogates its DNA binding activity. The minimal binding site (MBS) for POT1 was found to be the telomeric nonamer 5′-TAGGGTTAG-3′, and the optimal substrate is [TTAGGG]n (n ≥ 2). POT1 displays exceptional sequence specificity when binding to MBS, tolerating changes only at position 7 (T7A). Whereas POT1 binding to MBS or [TTAGGG]2 was enhanced by the proximity of a 3′ end, POT1 was able to bind to a [TTAGGG]5 array when positioned internally. These data indicate that POT1 has a strong sequence preference for the human telomeric repeat tract and predict that POT1 can bind both the 3′ telomeric overhang and the displaced TTAGGG repeats at the base of the t-loop. The human telomeric protein POT1 is known to bind single-stranded telomeric DNA in vitro and to participate in the regulation of telomere maintenance by telomerase in vivo. We examined the in vitro DNA binding features of POT1. We report that deleting the oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding fold of POT1 abrogates its DNA binding activity.

These data indicate that POT1 has a strong sequence preference for the human telomeric repeat tract and predict that POT1 can bind both the 3′ telomeric overhang and the displaced TTAGGG repeats at the base of the t-loop. Human telomeres are composed of 6-10 kbp of double-stranded TTAGGG repeats that end in a single-stranded overhang of several hundred nucleotides. The 3′ end of the telomeric overhang is the substrate of telomerase, the cellular reverse transcriptase that synthesizes telomeric repeats. The telomere can adopt a “t-loop” configuration, in which the 3′ overhang strand-invades the duplex (1Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). The strand invasion results in a displacement loop (D-loop) of single-stranded TTAGGG repeats; these single-stranded repeats are not at a 3′ end. The actual 3′ end of the chromosome is predicted to be base-paired to the C-strand and therefore inaccessible to telomerase when telomeres are in the t-loop configuration. Proteins that bind to the double-stranded portion of human telomeres have been studied extensively (reviewed in Ref. 4Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, TRF1 binds as a dimer through a MYB-type helix-loop-helix domain. The MYB domains of TRF1 dimers bind to two double-stranded 5′-YTAGGGTTR-3′ half-sites independent of spacing or orientation (2Bianchi A. Stansel R.M. Fairall L. Griffith J.D. Rhodes D. de Lange T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5735-5744Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 3Bianchi A. Smith S. Chong L. Elias P. de Lange T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Other proteins such as tankyrase 1 and 2, Tin2, PINX1, and POT1 are recruited to telomeres by TRF1 (4Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The TRF1 complex is involved in the regulation of telomere length by cis-inhibition of telomerase. In telomerase-positive cells, the overexpression of TRF1 leads to telomere shortening, and the expression of a dominant negative form leads to telomere elongation (5van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The relationship between TRF1 and telomerase regulation at the 3′ telomere terminus is poorly understood. The human single-stranded telomeric DNA-binding protein POT1 was identified based on its sequence similarity to the Oxytricha nova TEBPα, known to be associated to the 16-base single-stranded telomeric extension in this organism (6Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Orthologs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Arabidopsis, mouse, human, and other eukaryotes have been identified by homology to the N-terminal OB 1The abbreviations used are: OB fold, oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding fold; MBS, minimal binding site; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RPA, replication protein A; nt, nucleotide(s). (oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding) fold, a structural domain involved in DNA binding (7Baumann P. Podell E. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8079-8087Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of TEBPα revealed three OB folds, two involved in DNA binding and the third one necessary for a protein interaction with TEBPβ (8Horvath M.P. Schweiker V.L. Bevilacqua J.M. Ruggles J.A. Schultz S.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 963-974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). TEBPα, -β, and the DNA form a ternary complex in which the α/β dimer forms a cage around the DNA, which itself is folded into a hairpin structure (8Horvath M.P. Schweiker V.L. Bevilacqua J.M. Ruggles J.A. Schultz S.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 963-974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). No ortholog of TEBPβ has been found in mammals. In S. pombe, Pot1 (spPot1) is essential for the protection of chromosome ends (6Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Deletion of the pot1+ gene leads to rapid telomere degradation. Survivors of this telomere loss have circularized chromosomes that lack all telomeric DNA. Binding studies have determined that spPot1 binds to a sequence representing fission yeast telomeric DNA (repeats of GGTTACA) but not to the human telomeric sequence (TTAGGG). The minimal binding site for the isolated DNA binding domain consists of six nucleotides, GGTTAC, with a binding constant of 83 nm (9Lei M. Baumann P. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14560-14568Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cooperative binding occurs on oligonucleotides containing multimeric sites, and spPot1 displays a preference for sequences close to a 3′ end. Taken together these data are consistent with a model in which the protein initially binds the very 3′ end of chromosomes and subsequently coats the entire telomeric overhang. Human POT1 has two important domains required for its function: an N-terminal OB fold, predicted to be necessary for DNA binding, and a protein interaction domain, mediating association with the TRF1 complex (10Loayza D. de Lange T. Nature. 2003; 424: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Thus, POT1 is a good candidate for providing the link between TRF1 on the duplex telomeric portion and the 3′ overhang where telomerase acts. It is still unclear whether DNA binding is a primary event in POT1 targeting to telomeres or if it occurs after recruitment by TRF1. POT1 can be detected by immunofluorescence at telomeres, and can associate with telomeres through its interaction with the TRF1 complex (10Loayza D. de Lange T. Nature. 2003; 424: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The exact role of the DNA binding activity of POT1 is unknown, but the expression of a mutant form of POT1 missing the OB fold (POT1ΔOB) leads to extensive telomere elongation in telomerase-positive cells (10Loayza D. de Lange T. Nature. 2003; 424: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The simplest model is that POT1 lies downstream of the TRF1 complex in the telomere length regulation pathway. POT1 is proposed to inhibit telomerase in cis at chromosome ends in response to the length of the duplex portion and as such could play a role in the counting mechanism performed by the TRF1 complex. POT1 has also been implicated as a positive factor for telomere length control. In some settings, overexpression of full-length POT1 (with short N-terminal and C-terminal extensions) was found to lead to telomere elongation (11Colgin L.M. Baran K. Baumann P. Cech T.R. Reddel R.R. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 942-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It is possible that POT1 has a dual mode of function at telomeres; one would be inhibitory to telomerase, and the other promoting telomere elongation. Such a dual role in telomere length regulation has been proposed for the distantly related protein Cdc13p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Chandra A. Hughes T.R. Nugent C.I. Lundblad V. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The main form of POT1 detected by Western blotting is the full-length protein (10Loayza D. de Lange T. Nature. 2003; 424: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). However, POT1 transcripts are subject to alternative splicing, possibly leading to the expression of C-terminal truncations in certain cell types (7Baumann P. Podell E. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8079-8087Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In vitro, one of the variants (variant 2), corresponding to the N-terminal 38 kDa of the protein, displays an 8-fold higher binding affinity than full-length POT1. It is not known whether the alternatively spliced transcripts yield stable proteins or what the role of these variants in telomere biology might be. Human POT1 binds to single-stranded human telomeric TTAGGG repeats but not to double-stranded telomeric DNA nor to the C-rich telomeric repeat strand (6Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). POT1 only binds efficiently to the human telomeric sequence and not to the S. pombe telomeric DNA nor to the O. nova TTTTGGGG sequence (6Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). To date, the minimal binding site, sequence specificity, and 3′ end dependence of POT1 have not been studied in detail. Here, we address these and other aspects of the DNA binding features of POT1. Purification of Escherichia coli or Baculovirus-expressed POT1—The cloning of the POT1 and POT1ΔOB cDNAs was described previously (10Loayza D. de Lange T. Nature. 2003; 424: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The full-length POT1 cDNA was cloned as a BamHI-XhoI fragment in FastBac HTb (Clontech), adding a His6 tag to the N terminus and the transfections, and virus amplifications and protein production were performed as described in the manufacturer's protocols. The protein was purified out of 100 ml of Sf21 cells 48 h after infection (m.o.i. = 5). For protein purification from E. coli, the POT1 and POT1ΔOB cDNAs were cloned in the BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Biosciences), resulting in N-terminal GST fusions. GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione beads as directed by the manufacturer. After purification, the protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 500 mm KCl (150 mm for GST fusions), and 20% glycerol, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. The binding affinity of POT1 declined 3-5-fold over a period of 2 weeks and was stable afterward. Oligonucleotides and Probe Labeling—All oligonucleotides were obtained from Genelink as gel-purified 50-mers with indicated random and telomeric sequences (see Table I). Oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′ end with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and purified through a Sephadex G50 column in 10 mm Tris-Hcl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS. The labeled oligos were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, precipitated with 0.2 m NaAc, pH 5.5, and 2 volumes of EtOH (-20 °C overnight) and dissolved in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0.Table ISequences of POT1 binding substratesNameSequence (5′ to 3′)aNon-telomeric portions of the oligonucleotides are: A, GCAAGCT-TTA; B, CCGATACAGC; C, CGCTCA; D, GACTGA; E, CTCGAA; F, GAACTC; G, CAC; H, GAACTCGATCC; J, CACTGCAACT; K, GAACTCGAC; L, CACTGCAAC.tel-1A-B-C-D-E-F- (TTAGGG)tel-2A-B-C-D-E- (TTAGGG)2tel-3A-B-C-D- (TTAGGG)3tel-4A-B-C- (TTAGGG)4tel-5A-B- (TTAGGG)5int-5A- (TTAGGG)5-Bint-2A-K- (TTAGGG)2-L-Bint-MBSA-H- (TAGGGTTAG) -J-B5′-5(TTAGGG)5-A-BMBSA-B-C-D-E-G-TAGGGTTAGMBS+1A-B-C-D-E-CCTTAGGGTTAGPermut1A-B-C-D-E-G-AGGGTTAGGPermut2A-B-C-D-E-G-GGGTTAGGGPermut3A-B-C-D-E-G-GGTTAGGGTPermut4A-B-C-D-E-G-GTTAGGGTTPermut5A-B-C-D-E-G-TTAGGGTTAMBS-T1AA-B-C-D-E-G-CAGGGTTAGMBS-A2TA-B-C-D-E-G-TTGGGTTAGMBS-G3CA-B-C-D-E-G-TACGGTTAGMBS-G4CA-B-C-D-E-G-TAGCGTTAGMBS-G5CA-B-C-D-E-G-TAGGCTTAGMBS-T6AA-B-C-D-E-G-TAGGGATAGMBS-T7AA-B-C-D-E-G-TAGGGTAAGMBS-A8TA-B-C-D-E-G-TAGGGTTTGMBS-G9CA-B-C-D-E-G-TAGGGTTACMBS-G9AA-B-C-D-E-G-TAGGGTTAAa Non-telomeric portions of the oligonucleotides are: A, GCAAGCT-TTA; B, CCGATACAGC; C, CGCTCA; D, GACTGA; E, CTCGAA; F, GAACTC; G, CAC; H, GAACTCGATCC; J, CACTGCAACT; K, GAACTCGAC; L, CACTGCAAC. Open table in a new tab Band Shift Assays—The binding reactions were performed in 20 μl of the following buffer: 20 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 9.0, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 2% glycerol, 50 ng of β-casein, 0.5 μg of sonicated and denatured E. coli DNA (mean size ∼400 nt), and 0.25 nm probe. The protein was added last, and the binding reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For direct binding, a range of 0.1-5 μg of protein was used. For competition assays, 0.5-1 μg of protein was added to the reactions containing up to 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide. Electrophoresis was performed in 0.6% agarose gels run in 0.1× Tris borate EDTA. The gels were run for 40 min at 160 V, dried on Whatman DE81 paper at 80 °C and exposed on phosphorimaging screens. Quantitation was performed using the ImageQuant software. Purification of POT1 and Band Shift Assay Conditions—POT1 was expressed in insect cells (His-tagged) or in E. coli (GST-tagged) and purified on affinity matrix (Fig. 1, A and B). Band shift assays were performed with end-labeled single-stranded DNA probes (Table I). All binding substrates were kept at a constant length of 50 nt by changing the length of the random sequence at the 5′ end of the probes to compensate for variations in the length of the telomeric sequences. POT1 did not bind to any of the random subsequences (see below). Various conditions for POT1 binding to TTAGGG repeat probes were tested, and optimal binding occurred at pH 9.0 in the presence of casein and 0.5 μg of single-stranded sheared E. coli DNA competitor (data not shown). Reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and fractionated on 0.6% agarose gels in 0.1× Tris borate EDTA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Purified Bac-POT1 or GST-POT1 (Fig. 1A) was able to shift a probe containing two, three, or five TTAGGG repeats equally well (Figs. 1, B and C, and 2A). For most preparations of protein, the Kapp was as low as 20 nm as determined from the concentration of protein required to bind 50% of the probe. To determine whether the N-terminal OB fold was required for the in vitro DNA binding activity of POT1, we tested a truncated protein (POT1ΔOB) lacking the first 126 amino acids of the POT1 open reading frame, including the amino acids that make up the putative OB fold. This deletion mutant had no detectable DNA binding activity under our assay conditions (Fig. 1, C and D). From protein titration experiments, we estimated that POT1ΔOB was at least 30-fold less active than the full-length POT1 protein (Fig. 1D and data not shown), indicating that the N terminus of POT1 is essential for DNA binding in vitro. No binding was detected with POT1ΔOB on probes presenting two (Fig. 1C) or five (Fig. 1D) TTAGGG repeats. POT1 Binds [TTAGGG]n ≥ 2 but Not a Single TTAGGG Site at a 3′ End—In initial experiments, we found that POT1 bound probes with two or five TTAGGG repeats at a 3′ end (tel-2 or tel-5) equally well, whereas a probe with only one 3′-terminal TTAGGG sequence (tel-1) was not bound (Fig. 2). This result was obtained both by direct binding assays and by monitoring the competition of various DNAs for the binding of POT1 to tel-2 (Fig. 2, A and B; Table II). Thus, the minimal binding site for POT1 is longer than 6 nt (one repeat) and shorter than or equal to 12 nt (two repeats).Table IIPreference of POT1 for 3′-terminal position of short but not long repeal arraysa Random sequences are represented by open boxes, telomeric repeats by arrowheads.b Direct binding was tested with 0.1-5 μg of POT1 protein.c Competition experiments were done with tel-2 as a probe. The values are derived from 2-3 experiments. Open table in a new tab a Random sequences are represented by open boxes, telomeric repeats by arrowheads. b Direct binding was tested with 0.1-5 μg of POT1 protein. c Competition experiments were done with tel-2 as a probe. The values are derived from 2-3 experiments. Annealing the tel-2 probe to its complementary oligonucleotide, thereby rendering the telomeric part double-stranded, abolished POT1 binding (Fig. 2C). In contrast, a probe having only the nontelomeric portion in double-stranded form bound as well as the purely single-stranded probe (Fig. 2C). These findings are consistent with previously published results (6Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar), indicating that POT1 binds only to single-stranded telomeric sequences. We subsequently used competition for POT1 binding to tel-2 to determine the ability of POT1 to interact with various substrates. We placed the telomeric repeats internally in the oligonucleotide flanked by random sequences (see Table I). An oligonucleotide with five repeats placed internally (int-5) competed efficiently for POT1 binding to tel-2 (Fig. 2B). The competition efficiency, as measured by the molar excess of the competitor required for 50% reduction in POT1 binding to the labeled tel-2 probe, was similar when the five telomeric repeats were placed at the 3′ end of the binding substrate (tel-5) or internally (int-5) (Table II, 1.2- versus 1.7-fold). However, with substrates containing only two repeats, there was a significant difference when the telomeric sequence was placed internally; int-2, containing two internal TTAGGG repeats, did not compete for POT1 binding to the tel-2 probe (Fig. 2D), whereas tel-2 itself (carrying the TTAGGG repeats at the 3′ end) showed the expected competition (50% reduction in binding upon addition of 1.5-fold molar excess of cold probe) (Table II). This result was the first indication that, on short substrates, POT1 displays a preference for binding sites present at a free 3′ end (more than a 100-fold for substrates with two TTAGGG repeats) (Table II). Because no preference for the 3′ end was detected with substrates containing five TTAGGG repeats (Table II; Fig. 2, A and B), we concluded that a free 3′ end is not strictly required for POT1 binding, but the binding to short sites is facilitated when they are present at a 3′ end. Placing the TTAGGG repeats at the 5′ end did not significantly affect the binding either, as a substrate with five TTAGGG repeats placed at the 5′ end (5′-5) competed well for binding to the tel-2 probe (molar excess = 2.9) (Table II). The Minimal POT1 Binding Site—A nonamer binding site for POT1 was identified by testing oligonucleotides with permutations of one and a half TTAGGG repeats positioned at a free 3′ end (Table III). Of all possible permutations, only one (the sequence 5′-TAGGGTTAG-3′) was capable of competing efficiently for POT1 (Fig. 3, A-C; Table III). The molar excess required for 50% competition was about 2-fold more than for tel-2 itself (Tables II and III). Direct binding assays confirmed the binding of POT1 to the TAGGGTTAG sequence and the lack of binding to other permutations (Fig. 3B). Omitting the first T of the TAGGGTTAG site reduced its ability to compete for tel-2 by more than 50-fold (see Table III). In contrast, the addition of one T residue 5′ (resulting in TTAGGGTTAG) did not improve binding significantly as observed by direct binding (data not shown). These data indicated that the sequence TAGGGTTAG represented the minimal binding site (MBS) sequence for POT1. By direct binding, there was no significant difference in affinity between tel-2 and MBS (Fig. 3C).Table IIIPOT1 binds to a single permutation of a telomeric nonamera Random sequences are represented by open boxes and telomeric repeats by arrowheads.b Direct binding was tested with 0.1-5 μg of POT1 protein.c Competition experiments were done with tel-2 as a probe.

The values are derived from 2-3 experiments. n.d., not determined. To determine whether POT1 needed a 3′ end to bind to MBS, we placed this sequence internally in a 50-nt probe flanked 5′ and 3′ by random sequences. As was the case for the probe with two internal TTAGGG repeats, POT1 did not bind to the internally placed MBS either by direct binding or by competition assay (Fig. 3D). Thus, the lack of binding to short sequences (≤12 nt) at internal sites is not due to the particular permutation used. We concluded that the sequence TAGGGTTAG represents the minimal binding for POT1 when present at the 3′ end of the DNA. POT1 Binds with High Sequence Specificity—The minimal binding site provided a simplified context for the analysis of the sequence specificity of POT1. A-T, T-A, G-C, or C-G transversions were introduced at each of the nine positions in MBS, and the resulting MBS variants were tested by competition for POT1 binding to tel-2 (Fig. 4A, Table IV). High affinity POT1 binding occurred with only one MBS variant, the sequence 5′-TAGGGTAAG-3′, a change of T to A at position 7 (referred to as MBS-T7A) (Fig. 4B, Table IV). Based on competition assays, POT1 bound to MBS-T7A with an affinity about 2-fold lower than to MBS (molar excess of 4 for MBS-T7A compared with 2.7 for MBS, Table IV). By direct binding, POT1 also bound to MBS and MBS-T7A (Fig. 4B). The sequence TAGGCTTAG (MBS-G5C), containing a G to C change at position 5 (in bold), was also tolerated but with a significant loss of affinity compared with MBS (Table IV) All of the other changes greatly reduced the binding of POT1 to MBS (Fig. 4A and Table IV).Table IVSequence specificity of POT1 when binding to MBSName3′-Terminal sequenceDirect bindingaDirect binding was tested with 0.1-5 μg of POT1 protein.Molar excess at 50% competitionbCompetition experiments were done with tel-2 as a probe.

The values are derived rom 2-3 experiments. Open table in a new tab As a test for the relevance of the sequence specificity displayed by POT1 when binding to MBS, we tested the binding of POT1 to repeats of the sequence GGTTAC, a change that should abolish binding based on the lack of binding of POT1 to MBS-G3C and MBS-G9C (TACGGTTAG and TAGGGTTAC, respectively) (Table IV). Consistent with the results of the MBS studies, the substrate containing five tandem GGTTAC repeats could not compete effectively with tel-2 for POT1 binding (Fig. 4C). However, a DNA substrate with the same G-C change only in the 3′-terminal repeat (resulting in [GGTTAG]4GGTTAC-3′) was an effective competitor (Fig. 4C). This result exemplifies the internal binding activity of POT1 and shows that changes in the telomeric repeat must occur at multiple binding sites to significantly affect binding activity. We conclude that POT1 displays high sequence specificity in the context of the minimal binding site. The characterization of the DNA binding properties of POT1 is important for understanding its function at telomeres. In this study, we have defined the minimal binding site for human POT1 and determined the nucleotides important for binding to this sequence. The sequence 5′-TAGGGTTAG-3′ constitutes the only nonamer permutation that bound POT1 with comparable affinity to longer telomeric repeat arrays. The same sequence placed internally lost its affinity for POT1, suggesting a preference for 3′ end binding on short sites. However, human and mouse telomeres have been shown to contain long tandem arrays of TTAGGG repeats, which can contain 20-30 overlapping MBS sequences. According to our analysis, POT1 binds very well to such long TTAGGG repeat arrays even when they are not directly at a 3′ terminus. This predicts that much of the 3′ overhang and most of the telomeric D-loop could be coated by POT1. The POT1 site is at least 9 nt in length, which is long considering that OB folds usually interact with short sites (2-5 nt). One possibility is that POT1 either binds as a dimer or contains multiple OB folds each recognizing part of the MBS. As OB folds lack strong primary sequence signatures, it is not excluded that POT1 contains two or even three of these motifs. Another possibility is that POT1 acts similarly to Cdc13, which interacts with an 11-nt site using a single OB fold (13Hughes T.R. Weilbaecher R.G. Walterscheid M. Lundblad V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6457-6462Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Mitton-Fry R.M. Anderson E.M. Hughes T.R. Lundblad V. Wuttke D.S. Science. 2002; 296: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this case, the most 5′ GTGT sequence constitutes a “hot spot” of binding affinity. Additional weaker interactions, in part facilitated by a 30-amino acid loop, extend the preferred binding substrate to 11 nt (14Mitton-Fry R.M. Anderson E.M. Hughes T.R. Lundblad V. Wuttke D.S. Science. 2002; 296: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 15Anderson E.M. Halsey W.A. Wuttke D.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3751-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A final possibility is that human POT1 recognizes the telomeric TAGGGTTAG site through both protein DNA interactions and DNA-DNA interactions, a mode of substrate recognition exemplified by the TEBPα/β complex (8Horvath M.P. Schweiker V.L. Bevilacqua J.M. Ruggles J.A. Schultz S.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 963-974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The DNA-DNA interactions in the POT1-DNA complex could involve stacking interactions and higher order folding of the single-stranded DNA. Thus, the MBS sequence could be a good POT1 substrate both because it provides the optimal base and backbone contacts and has the ability to adopt the proper configuration for POT1 binding. The resolution of the crystal structure of human POT1 bound to the DNA will shed light on these issues. Similarly, the role of the 3′ terminus in the formation of the POT1-DNA complex could involve protein-DNA contacts, as in the TEBPα/β complex, and/or DNA-DNA contacts, which could explain the preference of POT1 for its minimal binding site at a 3′ end. We have shown previously that an N-terminal deletion mutant, POT1ΔOB, which lacks the DNA binding domain, can still localize to telomeres (10Loayza D. de Lange T. Nature. 2003; 424: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). This indicates that the DNA binding function is not necessary for targeting POT1 to telomeres per se. If POT1 is primarily recruited to telomeres by protein interaction through the TRF1 complex, it could associate with its cognate DNA binding site as a secondary event. Therefore, the specific positioning of POT1 at chromosome ends would rely on two highly specific events, its interaction with the TRF1 complex and its ability to engage TAGGGTTAG sites. In this context, recognition of the 3′ terminus, which is a third hallmark of the telomere, may not be an important factor. POT1 discriminates effectively between MBS and variant sites that have single nucleotide changes. This ability of POT1 to distinguish between telomeric repeats and closely related sequences could be highly relevant to its biological function in vertebrates. Many vertebrates contain sequences closely resembling telomeric DNA at chromosome internal sites (16Meyne J. Baker R.J. Hobart H.H. Hsu T.C. Ryder O.A. Ward O.G. Wiley J.E. Wurster-Hill D.H. Yates T.L. Moyzis R.K. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1990; 99: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In some cases, these sequences are highly repetitive, forming a major class of mini-satellite DNA (17Southern E.M. Nature. 1970; 227: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The sequence specificity of POT1 may be sufficient to prevent binding to these pseudo-telomeric repeats. This distinction is especially important because the TRF1 complex can be loaded on the chromosome-internal pseudo-telomeric repeats (18Smogorzewska A. van Steensel B. Bianchi A. Oelmann S. Schaefer M.R. Schnapp G. de Lange T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1659-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), potentially recruiting POT1 to these sites. Thus, the high sequence specificity displayed by POT1 may not be important for actual targeting and localization of the protein to telomeres but may be important for preventing POT1 from binding to nontelomeric sites in the genome during S-phase. In this context, it would be interesting to compare the affinities of POT1 and replication protein A (RPA), the single-stranded DNA-binding protein involved in DNA replication (19Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar), to telomeric and nontelomeric probes. It is expected that the affinity of RPA for the telomeric sequence is lower than that of POT1, which would result in the exclusion of RPA by POT1 from the telomeric overhang. On the other hand, because RPA does not display sequence specificity on single-stranded DNA, it could effectively compete off POT1 from nontelomeric sites, which may be important during DNA replication. In addition, RPA would presumably have to displace POT1 from telomeric DNA during the replication of telomeres. It is likely that specific regulatory pathways function to facilitate this exchange.

Zinc is a micronutrient essential for the growth, development, and differentiation of cells by contributing to a number of important biological processes, including gene expression, DNA synthesis, enzymatic catalysis, hormone storage and release, neurotransmission, memory, and apoptosis (1Beyersmann D. Haase H. Biol. Metals. 2001; 14: 331-341Google Scholar). The function of zinc in metalloenzymes attributes to its inherent chemical properties as an acid catalyst, a structural ion, and a regulatory co-factor (2Frausto da Silva J. Williams R. The Biological Chemistry of the Elements. Oxford University Press, Oxford2001: 315-340Google Scholar, 3Kimura E. Kikuta E. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 4Outten C. O'Halloran T. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Consequently, cellular processes are critically dependent on the maintenance of zinc at optimal physiological levels, ranging from about 10–11m in the cytoplasm of many cells to 10–3m in some vesicles (5Choi D. Koh J. Annu. Rev. Neuroscience. 1998; 21: 347-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). In bacteria and eukaryotic cells, zinc homeostatic control mechanisms have evolved based on a complex network of transport, chelation, and sequestration processes to maintain zinc within narrow physiological ranges and sustain zinc concentration gradients across membranes of different cellular compartments (6Blencowe D. Morby A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 291-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 7Eide D. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 1532-1535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Vasak M. Hasler D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Several families of membrane proteins have been identified as zinc uptake or efflux transporters, responsible for zinc homeostasis by moving zinc into and out of cells or intracellular vesicles (9Harris E. Nutr. Rev. 2002; 60: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Of all zinc transporters identified so far, mechanisms by which zinc transporters bind and transport metal ions have not yet been defined in molecular detail. In Escherichia coli, zinc homeostasis is accomplished largely through the transcriptional control of four zinc transporter systems, including two uptake transporters, the high affinity ABC transporter ZnuABC (10Patzer S. Hantke K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), and the ZIP transporter ZupT (11Grass G. Wong M. Rosen B. Smith R. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 864-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The efflux of zinc is mediated by two efflux transporters, the P-type ATPase ZntA (12Beard S. Hashim R. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Hughes M. Poole R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fan B. Rosen B. Franke S. Nies D. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4664-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). CDF is a ubiquitous family of metal transporters found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (15Paulsen I. Saier M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis suggests that CDF proteins contain a hydrophobic N-terminal domain followed by a hydrophilic C-terminal domain with large variations both in size and sequence. The number of transmembrane domains and the oligomeric structure of CDF proteins have not yet been established experimentally, but hydropathy profiles of CDF sequences suggest that this family of transporters may contain five to six membrane-spanning domains. Mammalian and yeast CDF transporters have been localized to the plasma and vesicular membranes. They are involved in the removal of cytoplasmic zinc through efflux out of cells or sequestration into intracellular vesicular compartments (16Palmiter R. Findley S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 17Palmiter R. Cole T. Findley S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 18Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19MacDiarmid C. Gaither L. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Like many homologous eukaryotic CDF transporters, the expression of E. coli ZitB was found to be inducible by zinc (14Grass G. Fan B. Rosen B. Franke S. Nies D. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4664-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). ZitB was implicated in a role of an efflux pump by the observations that overexpression of ZitB increased zinc tolerance and reduced zinc uptake, whereas double ΔzitB and ΔzntA deletion resulted in zinc hypersensitivity (14Grass G. Fan B. Rosen B. Franke S. Nies D. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4664-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A Zn2+/K+/H+ antiport mechanism was proposed for CDF based on genetic complementation experiments in which ZitB and CzcD, a Bacillus subtilis CDF transporter, were shown to complement K+ uptake deficiency of a mutant E. coli stain in the presence of zinc (20Guffanti A. Wei Y. Rood S. Krulwich T. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21Lee S. Grass G. Haney C. Fan B. Rosen B. Anton A. Nies D. Rensing C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 215: 273-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, evidence for an antiport mechanism is indirect, because the observed Zn2+ efflux could simply reflect a mixed contribution of different transport systems residing in the plasma membrane. The apparent K+ and H+ dependences of CzcD and ZitB functions could result from the interplay of many H+ and K+-linked pumps in cells. Therefore, the transport mechanism of CDF remains obscure. An explicit mechanistic description can only come from a direct kinetic study using a purified reconstitution system. Here we describe the kinetic analysis of the purified and reconstituted ZitB using Zn2+-sensitive fluorescent indicator fluozin-1 to monitor the Zn2+ transport in response to transmembrane chemical gradients and electrical potentials. Fluozin-1 is a single wavelength fluorophore that exhibits more than 200-fold fluorescence enhancement upon Zn2+ or Cd2+ binding with essentially no change in absorption or emission wavelengths (Molecular Probes Handbook). It has been used for detection of rapid synaptic Zn2+ transients in the 0.1–100 μm range (22Gee K. Zhou Z. Ton-That D. Sensi S. Weiss J. Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To quantify the transport kinetics of ZitB, we have established a linear relationship between the fluozin-1 response and the total intravesicular Zn2+ concentration and used a stopped-flow apparatus to determine kinetic parameters of ZitB transport under controlled conditions of proton gradients and membrane electrical potentials. These experiments led to the conclusion that ZitB is an obligatory Zn2+/H+ antiporter. Cloning and Expression Plasmid Construct—The entire open reading frame sequence of ZitB was obtained by PCR using the genomic DNA of E. coli BL21 strain as a template and a pair of ZitB-specific primers with an XhoI and a BamHI site incorporated into the 5′-ends of the forward and reverse primer, respectively (forward primer, 5′-ATGCTCGAGGCGCACTCACACTCAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCGGATCCTTAATGGTGATGATGTGAATG-3′). The resulting PCR product was double-digested using XhoI and BamHI (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) and subsequently inserted between the same sites in an expression vector, pET15b (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI), in frame with an N-terminal His6 affinity tag followed by a thrombin proteolytic cleavage site. The resulting expression construct, pHis-TB-ZitB, was verified by automatic sequencing of both strands. Overexpression of ZitB—pHis-TB-ZitB was transformed into a host strain BL21(DE3)pLysS for overexpression of ZitB (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI). A single colony of transformed cells was inoculated into the LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was grown overnight at 37 °C and diluted 100-fold to a 6-liter fresh LB broth. The large culture was grown to an A600 of 0.17 absorbance units, whereupon expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with vigorous shaking for an additional 4 h and then harvested by centrifugation. Membrane Preparation and Solubilization—Cell pellets were resuspended in a Tris buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 0.1% ethanol-saturated phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed by three passages through an ice-chilled microfluidizer (Microfluidics Co., Newton, MA) at 1000 p.s.i., and the resulting membrane vesicles were collected by centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 45 min. The membrane pellet was washed with Tris buffer, and then membrane proteins were extracted by a detergent buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 7% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM; Anatrace, Maumee, OH), 20% (w/v) glycerol, 2.0 mm β-ME). Insoluble cellular debris was pelleted from the supernatant by an additional centrifugation step at 140,000 × g for 30 min. Purification and Thrombin Digestion—Solubilized materials were applied to a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column (Amersham Biosciences), pre-equilibrated with 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 2 mm β-ME, and 0.05% DDM. The flow-through from the DEAE column was loaded to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The Ni2+ column was washed exhaustively using a wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% DDM, 2.0 mm β-ME, 30 mm imidazole), and then His-ZitB was eluted by the same wash buffer with additional imidazole added to 500 mm. The imidazole in the purified His-ZitB sample was removed by gel filtration chromatography using a Sephadex G-50 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) that was preequilibrated with a desalting buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.05% DDM, 2.0 mm β-ME). The N-terminal His tag of the purified His-ZitB was proteolytically cleaved by overnight incubation with thrombin at a ratio of one unit of thrombin for each mg of ZitB (Novagen, Madison, WI). The resulting ZitB was concentrated to 10–20 mg/ml and then further purified by size exclusion HPLC using a TSK 3000SWXL column (TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA), preequilibrated with a detergent mobile phase (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 12.5% glycerol, 0.05% DDM, 2.0 mm β-ME). The protein peaks were detected using a System-Gold HPLC system (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA), and ZitB was collected as a discrete peak using a Beckman SC100 fraction collector. The concentration of the purified ZitB was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Mass Spectrometric Analysis—α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix was prepared as a saturated solution in a 2:1 mixture of acetonitrile and water. Aliquots of protein in a series of 1:2 dilutions were mixed with matrix solution and then spotted onto the sample plate using the sandwich method (23Beavis R. Chait B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 270: 519-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF spectrometric data were collected using a Voyager Biospectrotometry work station, operated in linear mode. The spectra were externally calibrated with a calibrant mixture containing cytochrome c and bovine serum albumin. Reconstitution—Liposomes were prepared from E. coli polar lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL) hydrated to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml in a BTM buffer (2 mm Bis-Tris-MES (BTM), 2 mm β-ME, pH 6.8) by vigorous mixing on a vortex mixer. The suspension of multilamellar liposomes was sonicated under argon in an ice-chilled bath sonicator (Misonix Inc., Farmingdale, NY) until a clear lipid suspension was obtained. Depending on experimental designs, the purified ZitB, typically at a concentration of 10 mg/ml, was diluted to a final concentration ranging from 0.01 to 0.25 mg/ml, using an n-octyl-β-d-glucoside (β-OG) buffer (20 mm BTM, pH 6.8, 1% β-OG, 2 mm β-ME, and 50 mm either K2SO4 or TEA2SO4 when indicated). Using the freshly prepared sonicated lipid and ZitB dilution, reconstitution of ZitB proceeded with sequential additions of 100 μl of 10% β-OG to 130 μl of sonicated lipid, followed by the addition of 770 μl of ZitB. At this ratio, lipids were completely solubilized by β-OG, as indicated by the disappearance of turbidity. The resulting ZitB-lipid-detergent mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then applied to an Econo-Pac 10 DG desalting column (Bio-Rad), preequilibrated with an assay buffer (20 mm BTM or 20 mm Tris2SO4 with 50 mm K2SO4 or 50 mm TEA2SO4, when indicated). The cloudy void faction was collected and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 140,000 g for 45 min to pellet proteoliposomes. The control liposomes were prepared following exactly the same procedure without adding ZitB. Encapsulation of Membrane-impermeable Fluorescent Indicators— Proteoliposome and control liposome pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of assay buffer. An aliquot of 2 mm Zn2+-sensitive indicator fluozin-1 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) or pH-sensitive indicator pyranine (Molecular Probes) was added to the proteoliposome resuspension to a final concentration of 200 μm. The samples were sonicated for 10 s and subjected to one cycle of freeze-thaw (liquid nitrogen, room temperature), followed by an additional 10-s sonication. The untrapped indicator exterior to proteoliposomes was removed using an Econo-Pac 10 DG desalting column, preequilibrated with assay buffer. The indicator-loaded proteoliposomes were eluted in the void fraction. Stopped-flow Fluorescence Measurement—Kinetic experiments were performed in florescence mode on a stopped-flow apparatus (KinTeK, Clarence, PA). The dead time of the instrument was about 2 ms. The reaction temperature was set at 8 °C using a circulating water bath to maintain a constant temperature through jackets surrounding mixing syringes and the mixing cell. Proteoliposome samples and an assay buffer containing varying concentrations of ZnSO4 or CdSO4 were loaded into two separate mixing syringes of equal volume, and transport reactions were initiated by pushing 60 μl of fresh reactants at a 1:1 ratio through the 12-μl mixing cell at a flow rate of 20 ml/s. Fluorescence was monitored at 90° to the incident excitation beam. For measurements of fluozin-1 fluorescence changes, samples were excited at 490 nm, and emissions were monitored at 525 nm using a 10-nm band pass cut-off filter. For measurements of intravesicular pH changes by the ratiometric fluorescent indicator pyranine, proteoliposome samples were excited alternately by a pair of wavelengths at 450 and 410 nm, and emissions were recorded at 525 nm. The ratio of emission intensities (F450/F405) at two excitation wavelengths was calculated. For measurements of transmembrane potential changes, the voltage-sensitive lipophilic indicator oxonol VI (Molecular Probes) was added directly to the proteoliposome sample to a final concentration of 1 μm. Oxonol fluorescence was excited at 615 nm, and the emission was recorded at 646 nm. The base-line fluorescence for each indicator was set by flushing reactants through the mixing cell and adjusting the photomultiplier tube voltage to a level that would give a 5-V signal in the middle of the 0–10-V detectable range. Data were collected by an IBM work station with sensitivity, offset, and gain kept constant for the duration of each set of experiments. Kinetic traces were recorded using two equal time partitions, with the first half allocated for the fast kinetic component (0–500 ms) and the second half for the slow kinetic component (0.5–500 s). All traces were the cumulative average of 5–10 successive recordings. Data Analysis—A concentration of fluozin-1 at 200 μm was chosen to achieve a linear fluorescent response (ΔF) to the total intravesicular metal concentration (Δ[M]). This linear relationship is derived by the following equations. The concentration of the entrapped metal indicator complex ([I-M]) (24Dineley K. Malaiyandi L. Reynolds I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) is given by Equation 1, [I-M]=([I]+Kd+[M])-([I]+Kd+[M])2-4[I][M]2(Eq. 1) where [I] represents the total indicator concentration, [M] is the total metal ion concentration, and Kd is the binding affinity of fluozin-1 for the metal ion. The differential of Equation 1 produces Equation 2. Δ[I-M]=(I-[I]-[M]-Kd([I]+Kd+[M])2-4[I][M])×Δ[M]2(Eq. 2) If it is assumed that [I] ≫ Kd, Equation 2 can be simplified to the following. Δ[I-M]≈(1+[I]-[M]|[I]-[M]|)×Δ[M]2(Eq. 3) When[M]<[I],Δ[I-M]≈Δ[M](Eq. 4) When[M]>[I],Δ[I-M]≈0(Eq. 5) Kd of M binding to fluozin-1 is about 8 μm according to the Molecular Probes handbook. [I] at 200 μm is more than 20-fold higher than the Kd of fluozin-1. Therefore, the approximation Δ[I-M] ≈ Δ[M] holds. The observed ΔF is predominantly determined by Δ[I-M], which approximately equals Δ[M] when [M] < [I]. Hence, Δ[M] is given by Equation 6, Δ[M]≈kΔF/ΔFmax(Eq. 6) where k is a converting factor. ΔF is normalized to the maximum fluorescence change (ΔFmax) when the entrapped indicator is fully exposed to 2 mm external metal ion by detergent solubilization of proteoliposomes. In principal, the useful metal ion concentration range for this linear relationship, as suggested by Equation 5, is up to the concentration of the encapsulated fluozin-1 (200 μm). Calibration of Equation 6 was performed by exposing fluozin-1-loaded proteoliposomes to a series of controlled Zn2+ concentrations in the presence of 20 μm zinc ionophore pyrithione. Linear regression of the calibration curve yielded the converting factor k. All stopped-flow traces were normalized either to a maximum response elicited by detergent solubilization or to a quasistationary response when indicated. Background traces collected from liposome samples were subtracted, yielding net fluorescence responses that were fit to a biexponential function, A1(1 – exp(–k1t)) + A2(1 – exp(–k2t)), where A1, A2, k1, and k2 are amplitudes and rate constants, respectively. The initial rate of transport, Vi = (ΔF/ΔFmax)/Δt(t→0)), was calculated as A1k1 + A2k2. Concentration dependence data were analyzed by least squares fits of the normalized initial transport rate, Vi/Vmax, to a hyperbola defined by Equation 7, ViVmax=[M][M]+Km(Eq. 7) where [M] represents the metal ion concentration, Vmax is the maximum initial transport rate when the rate of transport approaches a quasistationary state, and Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant. Fits of experimental data were preformed using the data analysis software SIGMAPLOT 4.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Overexpression and Purification—The overexpression of ZitB was driven by a T7 promoter in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. The optimal A600 for isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside induction was found to be 0.17, and the log phase of growth was arrested 4 h after isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside induction to reach an A600 of 1.8. Cells were harvested, and the membrane fraction was isolated and then solubilized using DDM at a detergent-to-cell ratio of 1:10 (w/w). His-tagged ZitB could be purified to homogeneity by a single step nickel chelate affinity chromatography (Fig. 1A). Overnight incubation of the purified His-ZitB with thrombin at 20 °C resulted in a complete removal of the His tag, as confirmed by Western blot analysis using a His tag-specific antibody (data not shown). The molecular identity of the purified ZitB was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric measurements. Molecular masses of 37,067 ± 7 and 35,179 ± 9 Da were obtained for the purified His-ZitB before and after thrombin digestion. The expected and experimentally measured molecular masses agreed within 23 Da (expected mass: 37,084 and 35,202 Da, respectively). The thrombin-digested ZitB was concentrated to about 10–20 mg/ml, and further purification was achieved by preparative size exclusion HPLC. Analytical size exclusion HPLC analysis indicated that the purified ZitB was free of high molecular weight aggregates, showing a major monodisperse species followed by a minor species with retention times corresponding to apparent molecular masses of 140 and 45 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1B). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of these two peak fractions revealed a single mass peak at 35179 Da for the major species and a cluster of mass peaks between 700–800 Da for the minor species, indicating the lipidic nature of the minor species. The monodispersity of the 140-kDa fraction was confirmed by dynamic light scattering analysis. These results indicated that ZitB was purified as a single oligomeric species; however, the order of ZitB oligomerization is yet to be determined. Functional Reconstitution—The detergent-mediated reconstitution of ZitB was achieved using a detergent removal method as described under “Experimental Procedures.” DDM in the purified ZitB sample was diluted 40–1000-fold with 1% β-OG prior to reconstitution. Encapsulation of fluozin-1 in reconstituted vesicles was found to be stable over the period of a few days. Exposing ZitB proteoliposomes to 2 mm Zn2+ exterior to proteoliposomes caused a rapid rise of fluozin-1 fluorescence. The background Zn2+ leakage across the membrane was measured using control liposomes and was subtracted to yield a net Zn2+ response attributable to the ZitB-catalyzed Zn2+ influx (Fig. 2A). The initial rate of fluozin-1 response increased linearly with the ZitB-to-lipid ratio (Fig. 2B), demonstrating a linear relationship between the amount of the reconstituted ZitB and the initial rate of the fluorescence response. At a ZitB-to-lipid molar ratio of 8:11,517 (equal to 1:1440), the background Zn2+ leakage is negligible. Hence, this ZitB-to-lipid ratio was used thereafter for all stopped-flow measurements unless otherwise indicated. Furthermore, the quasistationary fluorescence responses also increased with ZitB-to-lipid ratios (Fig. 2A), indicative of the presence of a mixed population of proteoliposomes and liposomes in the reconstituted suspension. Increasing the ZitB-to-lipid ratio resulted in an increase of the proteoliposome population and a consequent increase of the quasistationary response. The quasistationary fluorescence was normalized to the maximum florescence, measured by adding β-OG to 1% at the end of each experiment to solubilize both proteoliposomes and liposomes. The resulting relative fluorescence varied from 0.05 to 0.5 depending on ZitB-to-lipid ratios (Fig. 2A). To determine the specific activity of ZitB, the relationship between the intravesicular Zn2+ concentration and the fluorescent response was calibrated based on Equation 6 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteoliposomes were prepared at three ZitB-to-lipid ratios: 4:11,517, 8:11,517, and 16: 11,517. Correspondingly, relative quasistationary responses were 0.43, 0.61, and 0.52. The maximum quasistationary response occurred at a ZitB-to-lipid ratio of 8:11,517. The reduced response at a lower ratio was due to the presence of empty liposomes, whereas the decline at a higher ratio might be caused by the presence of multiple copies of ZitB in one proteoliposome. A calibration curve was obtained using the optimal ZitB-to-lipid ratio of 8:11,517 (Fig. 2C). Under this condition, ΔF/ΔFmax was linearly related to [Zn2+] up to a value of 0.28, corresponding to a zinc concentration of 50 μm. Although this experimentally determined linear range was narrower compared with the theoretical prediction, it was sufficient to quantify initial zinc responses that fell within the range of 0–20% of the ΔFmax. The specific activity was calculated by converting the normalized initial Zn2+ response (ΔF/ΔFmax)/Δt to Δ[Zn2+]/Δt (μm/s), multiplying by the total proteoliposome internal volume (μl) and then normalizing to the total ZitB (μmol) in the reconstitution system. Using the calibration curve obtained from the same sample, the specific activity was determined to be 2.36 ± 0.42 (n = 3) μmol of Zn2+/s/μmol of ZitB, giving an average turnover number of 2.36 s–1 at 8 °C. Substrate Concentration Dependence—The initial rate of Zn2+ influx was measured in a zinc concentration range between 0 and 4 mm exterior to proteoliposomes. Proteoliposomes preloaded with fluozin-1 were rapidly mixed with an assay buffer containing various concentrations of Zn2+, resulting in an inward Zn2+ diffusion gradient that drove Zn2+ influx (Fig. 2A). Due to the low internal volume of membrane vesicles, Zn2+ influx may rapidly build up a transmembrane electrochemical gradient against the imposed Zn2+ diffusion gradient. Therefore, only the initial rate of the Zn2+ filling kinetics was analyzed. The relative initial rate of the fluorescence responses increased in a hyperbolic manner with the Zn2+ concentration and a fit of the relative rate data to a single hyperbolic function yielded a Km of 104.9 ± 5.4 μm (Fig. 3A). This kinetic behavior is consistent with a two-step process shown in Scheme 1, M+T1↔k-1/k1MT1→k2T2+MScheme 1 where T1 and T2 are different conformational states of ZitB, and M is the substrate. The first step is a rapid equilibrium with a binding constant k–1/k1, followed by a rate-limiting conformational transition from T1 to T2 with a rate constant k2. The relationship among k1, k–1, and k2 is defined as Km = (k2 + k–1)/k1. This kinetic scheme suggests that ZitB catalyzes Zn2+ transport with a stoichiometry of one ZitB for one Zn2+. In a parallel set of experiments, the Cd2+ concentration dependence of ZitB transport was investigated. The ZitB-mediated Cd2+ influx showed a rapid rise of fluozin-1 fluorescence upon the mixing of proteoliposomes with an assay buffer containing varying concentrations of Cd2+ ranging form 0 up to 4 mm. The initial rate of the fluorescence response increased in a hyperbolic manner with the Cd2+ concentration. The concentration dependence of the relative initial rate, when fitted to a single hyperbolic function, yielded a Km of 90.1 ± 3.7 μm (Fig. 3B). Therefore, Cd2+ transport can also be interpreted with a two-step process as described above for the Zn2+ transport. These results indi"

Deficiency in α-l-fucosidase activity is associated with fucosidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by rapid neurodegeneration, resulting in severe mental and motor deterioration. To gain insight into α-l-fucosidase function at the molecular level, we have determined the crystal structure of Thermotoga maritima α-l-fucosidase.

The structures of an enzyme-product complex and of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, coupled with kinetic and mutagenesis studies, allowed us to identify the catalytic nucleophile, Asp244, and the Brønsted acid/base, Glu266. Because T. maritima α-l-fucosidase occupies a unique evolutionary position, being far more closely related to the mammalian enzymes than to any other prokaryotic homolog, a structural model of the human enzyme was built to document the structural consequences of the genetic mutations associated with fucosidosis.

Decreased α-l-fucosidase activity is related to a number of pathological conditions such as inflammation, cancer, and cystic fibrosis (1Johnson S.W. Alhadeff J.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol.

Severe deficiency of α-l-fucosidases causes fucosidosis, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease resulting in the lethal accumulation of fucosylated glycoconjugates in the lysosomes of most tissues, including the peripheral and central nervous systems (4Willems P.J. Seo H.C. Coucke P. Tonlorenzi R. O'Brien J.S. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 7: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). α-l-Fucosidases are also of considerable interest because fucosidase activity in serum can be used in the diagnosis of patients with early colorectal and hepatocellular cancers (5Hutchinson W.L. Johnson P.J. Du M.Q. Williams R. Clin. Sci. 1991; 81: 177-182Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). α-l-Fucosidases have received much attention due to the central role of fucosylated glycoconjugates in many biological events. The latter are widely distributed in the animal kingdom, where they can be encountered in a variety of tissues, including liver, brain, and spleen, in human amniotic fluid, and as a discriminative feature of ABO and Lewis blood group antigens (6Greenwell P. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Accordingly, fucosylated glycans play a crucial role in many physiological and pathological processes, including immune response (7Delves P.J.

Fucose also appears to be an important immune modulator for the interactions between the selectin family of cell adhesion molecules and the sialyl Lewis X antigen of their glycoconjugate counterreceptors, enabling the rolling of leukocytes on the endothelium and subsequent extravasation (16Lowe J.B. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 19-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). α-l-Fucosidases are found exclusively in family GH29 of the classification of glycosidases based on sequence similarities, which reflect the folds, active site architecture, molecular mechanism, and, to a minor extent, substrate specificity (17Henrissat B.

We have determined the crystal structure of the α-l-fucosidase from the marine hyperthermophilic bacterium T. maritima (TM aFuc). 2The abbreviations used are: TM aFuc, T. maritima α-l-fucosidase; pNP-Fuc, p-nitrophenyl fucoside; MAD, multiple anomalous dispersion. 2The abbreviations used are: TM aFuc, T. maritima α-l-fucosidase; pNP-Fuc, p-nitrophenyl fucoside; MAD, multiple anomalous dispersion. Currently, this enzyme is the closest bacterial relative of mammalian α-l-fucosidases and shares 38% identity with its human counterpart. The true biological role of TM aFuc and its natural substrate is not known. However, this bacterium appears to have evolved a remarkably large repertoire of enzymes dedicated to the breakdown of plant pectin and xyloglucan. These hemicelluloses often carry α-l-fucose side chains, and it is thus tempting to speculate that TM aFuc operates synergistically with other glycosidases to degrade these polymers. Alternatively, it is also conceivable that TM aFuc may participate in the degradation of algal fucoidan by removing α-1,2- and α-1,4-linked fucosyl side chains from the polysaccharide. The crystal structures of complexes of TM aFuc with α-l-fucose and with a mechanism-based inhibitor, 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-l-fucopyranosyl fluoride (fucosyl fluoride), allowed us to delineate the substrate-binding pocket and the covalent 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-l-fucosyl-enzyme intermediate. Together with kinetic and mutagenesis experiments, these structures reveal for the first time the overall fold of glycoside hydrolase family GH29, allow the identification of the two catalytic residues, and provide a structural template to understand the molecular basis of fucosidosis. Cloning—The coding sequence of the T. maritima gene (TM0306) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA, and the PCR product was subcloned into the pDEST17 prokaryotic expression vector (Gateway, Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. This vector encodes an N-terminal His6 tag fused to the entire coding region of α-l-fucosidase. Sequence analysis revealed a single base difference compared with GenBank™/EBI accession number NC_000853, which resulted in a Y271C mutation. Expression and Purification—Expression was carried out using Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells grown in LB medium at 37 °C to A600 = 0.6 and induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the cells were sedimented, resuspended in 200 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and lysed with a French press. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated for 15 min at 60 °C, and precipitated E. coli proteins were eliminated by centrifugation. The enzyme was further purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography, and a gel filtration step yielded highly purified enzyme as judged by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy analysis. Selenomethionine-substituted enzyme was produced using the same bacterial strain grown in minimal M9 medium and supplemented, before induction, with selenomethionine and amino acids known to inhibit methionine biosynthesis (23Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis and Kinetic Assays—The E66A, D224A, and E266A mutants were generated using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were verified by DNA sequencing. These mutants, expressed under the conditions described above, were insoluble, and the coding sequences of the mutants, together with that of wild-type TM aFuc as a control, were therefore subcloned from pDEST17 into the expression vector His-pKM596, a derivative of pKM596 (24Fox J.D. Routzahn K.M. Bucher M.H. Waugh D.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 537: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), resulting in four His-maltose-binding protein-α-l-fucosidase-pKM596 expression constructs. Expression and purification of these uncleaved fusion proteins were carried out as described above for the wild-type TM aFuc construct, and Michaelis-Menten parameters for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl fucoside (pNP-Fuc) and fucosyl fluoride were obtained as described previously (22Tarling C.A.

Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C from protein solution at 5.0 mg/ml mixed with 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 5% Jeffamine M-600. Crystals belong to space group H32 and contain two molecules/asymmetric unit. Crystals of the fucose complex and the inhibitor complex were obtained by short soaks in the crystallization solution supplemented with 0.5 m fucose and/or a small amount of inhibitor powder, respectively. All data sets were collected at 100 K on flash-frozen crystals. Cryosolutions were of the same composition as the crystallization/harvesting solutions with the addition of increasing amounts of Jeffamine M-600 and supplemented with 5% (v/v) glycerol in the case of native, selenomethionylated, and inhibitor complex crystals and with the addition of 0.5 m fucose in the case of the fucose complex. Data were indexed and integrated with DENZO (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab Structure Solution and Refinement—The structure of α-fucosidase was solved by the selenomethionine three-wavelength multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) method using the program SOLVE (27Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar). The initial MAD phases had mean figures of merit of 0.45 for data to 2.8-Å resolution and of 0.62 after 10 cycles of density modification using DM, implementing solvent flattening and histogram matching (28Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). Despite the fact that only 6 selenium atoms of 12 could be located, with 6 selenomethionine residues being located either at the N terminus or in disordered loop regions, the resulting experimental map was of good quality and could be further improved by NCS averaging and phase combination techniques. Both protein chains were manually traced and fitted with the program TURBO-FRODO (29Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics Corp., 1991: 81Google Scholar). Refinement was carried out against data of the native crystal with CNS (30Bruenger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Weak data in the outmost resolution shell were included in the refinement, as they improved considerably sigmaA weighted electron density maps. A random 7% (2642) of reflections were set aside for cross-validation purposes. BUSTER (32Roversi P. Blanc E. Vonrhein C. Evans G. Bricogne G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1316-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was used to determine ill defined regions of the model. Automated solvent building was performed with ARP/wARP (33Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar). The two complex structures were subjected to rigid body refinement with REFMAC (31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar), and further refinement was carried out as described above. Ligands were included only toward the end of refinement, and no torsion angle restraints were applied to avoid imposition of a given pyranose ring conformation. The two molecules present in the asymmetric unit encompass Arg7-Pro46, Asp56-His268, and Asp274-Val447. Six N-terminal residues as well as the N-terminal His6 tag and the linker used for cloning and purification, 2 C-terminal residues, and surface loops Thr47-Met55, Val269-Gly273, and Gly297-His300 in chain B could not be built due to either diffuse or totally absent electron density. These surface regions, devoid of crystal-packing interactions, were also missing in the structures of the l-fucose complex and the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. Two solvent-exposed Cys residues, Cys364 and Cys365, form a rare disulfide bridge between consecutive residues. The linked l-fucosyl moiety and the product refined to occupancies of 0.4 and 0.6, respectively, in one molecule of the asymmetric unit and 0.6 and 0.4, respectively, in the second molecule. The stereochemistry of the final models was verified with the program PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Refinement and structure quality statistics are listed in Table I. The global B-factors given in the Protein Data Bank files were calculated from TLS tensors and the residual B-factors after refinement with REFMAC (31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). Model Building—The structure of the catalytic domain of human α-l-fucosidase encompassing Pro6-Trp347 was modeled with the protein homology modeling SWISS-MODEL server using the crystal structure of apo-TM aFuc as template. Given the difficulties in producing an accurate sequence alignment of some particular regions of members of the GH29 family, the accuracy of the resulting model was adjusted manually using the graphics program TURBO-FRODO (29Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics Corp., 1991: 81Google Scholar). Overall Fold—The crystal structure of TM aFuc was determined at 2.5-Å resolution by the MAD method, taking advantage of the anomalous scattering of selenium, and the model was refined against a native data set at 2.4-Å resolution. Complexes with l-fucose, the reaction product, and fucosyl fluoride, a mechanism-based inhibitor, were obtained by soaking experiments and were refined to 2.8- and 2.25-Å resolution, respectively. Clear unbiased electron density could be observed for both l-fucose and the inhibitor prior to their incorporation in the refinement (Fig. 1, A and B). TM aFuc is a two-domain protein with overall dimensions of 75 × 65 × 55 Å (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal domain (residues 7-359) adopts a (β/α)8-barrel-like fold, with eight parallel β-strands packed around a central axis and surrounded by six α-helices. A depression at the C-terminal ends of the β-strands hosts the active site. The helix corresponding to helix 5 in the classical triose-phosphate isomerase barrel fold is missing in TM aFuc and is replaced by a small loop region, whereas the structural equivalent of helix 6 corresponds to the disordered region Val269-Gly273, which could not be modeled. Despite being located close to the active site, this region does not become structured upon substrate/product binding, as previously observed in related enzyme systems (35Varrot A. Schulein M. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8884-8891Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Varrot A. Schulein M. Davies G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The core comprising the eight alternating β-strands and six α-helices is decorated by a considerable number of additional α-helices, 310 helices, and extended surface loop regions. The first β-strand is preceded by two small α-helices (residues 11-16 and 21-28) and followed by a long insertion comprising three 310 helices (residues 36-40, 64-66, and 92-94) and three α-helices (residues 68-74, 77-87, and 96-100). A long loop region (residues 128-151) is inserted after β-strand 2 and spatially contiguous to the insertions after β-strand 1. Finally, β-strand 3 is followed by an insertion comprising a 310 helix (residues 188-192). The C-terminal domain of TM aFuc (residues 360-447) is constructed of eight antiparallel β-strands packed into two β-sheets of five and three strands, respectively, forming a two-layer β-sandwich containing a Greek key motif and a small α-helix. The N-terminal domains of the three TM aFuc crystal structures are very similar, with a root mean square deviation for 330 C-α positions in the range of 0.3 Å. Slightly greater differences, ∼0.45 Å for 85 C-α positions, can be observed for the C-terminal domains. Significant differences can be also detected at the level of the relative arrangement of the two domains, indicating that the domain junction is, in fact, a flexible hinge. DALI searches (37Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar) performed with the isolated TM aFuc catalytic domain identified several relatives, the top ranked hit being β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (Protein Data Bank code 1hp4) (223 equivalent C-α positions with a root mean square deviation of 3.7 Å). In contrast, the C-terminal domain shares only limited similarity with other proteins, such as the N-terminal domain of Serratia marcescens chitobiase (Protein Data Bank code 1qba) (70 equivalent C-α positions with a root mean square deviation of 2.9 Å) and, with lower scores, with several carbohydrate-binding modules. Whereas the DALI search identified structurally similar modules encountered in a number of glycosidases from various families (GH13, GH15, GH17, GH20, GH27, and GH38), a BLAST search conducted with the C-terminal module alone did not produce any statistically significant hit, not even within GH29 family enzymes. Whether this module has a carbohydrate-binding function in TM aFuc remains unclear, but the lack of significant sequence similarity to other GH29 family enzymes suggests that the C-terminal domain of TM aFuc might have evolved another function. The assignment of a specific function to this domain is rendered particularly difficult by the fact that a number of proteins of diverse function, such as human leukotriene A4 hydrolase (Protein Data Bank code 1hs6), a proteolytic fragment of peptidylprolyl isomerase TLP2 (code 1tul), or the anthrax protective antigen (code 1acc), also fall in the same range of structural similarity. Oligomeric State—In the crystal, TM aFuc assembles into a compact hexameric arrangement, with overall dimensions of 110 × 120 × 140 Å (Fig. 2B). This assembly can be divided into two trimers that stack on each other and are rotated by ∼30°. Upon hexamer formation, the buried surface area (1.6-Å probe radius) per TM aFuc monomer lies between 2380 and 2520 Å2, a value in the highest range compared with other multimeric edifices (38Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). The interactions stabilizing the trimers are established exclusively between the catalytic domains, notably between the N-terminal residues, α-helices A3 and A4, and the loop region preceding α-helix A3. The C-terminal domains are projected toward the outer limits of the trimers. The interactions between two trimers involve the N-terminal α-helix, the surface loop regions following β-strands B5 and B6, and a very minor contact area in the C-terminal domain. No covalent bonds are formed between the monomers, even though a cysteine residue, Cys380, is located very close to its counterpart in a neighboring molecule; these two residues are too far apart to form a disulfide bridge. Size exclusion chromatography at low and high ionic strength (100 and 500 mm NaCl, respectively) gave essentially identical elution profiles corresponding to Mr values of ∼300,000, indicating that the hexameric form also prevails in solution. The significance of the hexameric state of TM aFuc is unclear at present. On the one hand, oligomerization is a frequent stabilizing feature of proteins from hyperthermophilic organisms such as T. maritima. On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that oligomerization may have a functional significance in TM aFuc, since most α-l-fucosidases so far characterized, whether from mesophilic or thermophilic organisms, are oligomeric. 3Available at www.brenda.uni-koeln.de. However, the active sites of the single monomers constituting the TM aFuc multimer are well separated, by ∼40 Å, and no interactions between bound substrate and neighboring subunits are detectable. The stability of the hexameric assembly is not disrupted by the introduction of maltose-binding protein at the N terminus. The resulting fusion protein also displays an enzymatic activity comparable with that of native TM aFuc. This suggests that the flexible linker is sufficiently long to allow the accommodation of maltose-binding protein on the outside of the core of the hexameric assembly. Substrate-binding Site—The crystal structures of TM aFuc in complex with l-fucose, the reaction product, allowed us to identify the active site, located in a small pocket formed by the C-terminal ends of the central β-strands of the (β/α)8-domain. The size of the pocket allows a single l-fucose residue to bind, consistent with the exoglycosidase action of α-l-fucosidases. In the product complex, l-fucose is present in the standard 1C4 chair conformation, and its 1-hydroxyl group adopts a β-anomeric configuration, presumably as a result of mutarotation in solution. The sugar is tightly enveloped by the enzyme, and each functional group makes direct contacts with one or more protein side chains, emphasizing a specific substrate recognition pattern for l-fucose (Fig. 1C). The 2-hydroxyl is hydrogen-bonded to the invariant His129 and Trp67 residues. The latter is, in turn, involved in a bidentate hydrogen-bonding network with O-3, together with the conserved side chain of Glu66. The conserved His128 residue stabilizes the axial 4-hydroxyl group, together with the invariant His34 residue, whereas the 1-hydroxyl group is hydrogen-bonded to Asp224. The exocyclic C-6 methyl group is enclosed within a hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of the largely conserved residues Phe32, Tyr171, Trp222, and Phe290. No structured water molecules could be observed in the vicinity of the ligand. No major structural rearrangements of the enzyme occur upon ligand binding. The most striking difference can be observed for Phe290, which rotates ∼25° around χ2, and for Tyr64, which flips its side chain by 90° around χ2. This latter movement brings the aromatic ring close to the hydrophobic face of the sugar ring; but instead of establishing a classical “stacking” interaction, often observed in sugar-binding proteins, the plane of the ring is placed perpendicular to the hydrophobic face of the sugar, favoring only very weak van der Waals interactions at a distance of ∼4.5 Å. This situation is often observed at the -1 subsite of glycosidases (subsite nomenclature of Re"

The proteinases responsible for the breakdown of cartilage aggrecan include ADAMTS-4 (aggrecanase 1) and ADAMTS-5 (aggrecanase 2). Post-translational inhibition of ADAMTS-4/-5 activity may be important for maintaining normal homeostasis of aggrecan metabolism, and thus, any disruption to this inhibition could lead to accelerated aggrecan breakdown. To date TIMP-3 (tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-3) is the only endogenous inhibitor of ADAMTS-4/-5 that has been identified. In the present studies we identify α2-macroglobulin (α2M) as an additional endogenous inhibitor of ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5. α2M inhibited the activity of both ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 in a concentration-dependent manner, demonstrating 1:1 stoichiometry with second-order rate constants on the order of 106 and 105m-1 s-1, respectively. Inhibition of the aggrecanases was mediated by proteolysis of the bait region within α2M, resulting in physical entrapment of these proteinases. Both ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 cleaved α2M at Met690/Gly691, representing a novel proteinase cleavage site within α2M and a novel site of cleavage for ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5. Finally, the use of the anti-neoepitope antibodies to detect aggrecanase-generated α2M-fragments in synovial fluid was investigated and found to be uninformative.

Loss of aggrecan from the cartilage extracellular matrix is an early and sustained feature of osteoarthritis (OA). 1The abbreviations used are: OA, osteoarthritis; MMP, matrix metalloproteinases; ADAMTS, adisintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs; α2M, α2-macroglobulin; TIMP-3, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-3; SF, synovial fluid. Aggrecan, the major proteoglycan in cartilage, consists of a protein backbone of 210–250 kDa containing 3 globular domains referred to as G1 (located at the N terminus), followed by G2 and G3 (located at the C terminus) (1Paulsson M. Morgolin M. Wiedemann H. Beardmore-Gray M. Dunham D. Hardingham T.E. Heinegard D. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Attached to the core protein between G2 and G3 are the glycosaminoglycans, chondroitin sulfate, and keratan sulfate. The chondroitin sulfate chains (100–125 per monomer) are located in the C-terminal portion of the core protein, whereas the keratan sulfate chains (25–50 per monomer) are preferentially located toward the N terminus (2Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. Dudhia J. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R Peyton J.G. Hascall V.C. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 5-20Google Scholar). Multiple aggrecan monomers interact with hyaluronic acid via their G1 domain to form aggregates of very high molecular weight. The negatively charged glycosaminoglycan chains are responsible for the extremely high osmotic swelling pressure of cartilage, which is counteracted by the resistance of type II collagen fibers (the other major macromolecule of cartilage). Thus, aggrecan provides cartilage with the ability to resist compressive forces, and its loss will have a severe effect upon the functionality of the cartilage. The cleavage of cartilage aggrecan in OA has been attributed primarily to aggrecanase 1 and 2 (3Ilic M.Z. Handley C.J. Robinson H.C. Mok M.T. Arch. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). TIMP-3 was found to have a greater affinity for ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 than for MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-3, suggesting that a primary physiological function for TIMP-3 is inhibition of the aggrecanases (19Kashiwagi M. Tortorella M.D. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12501-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Moreover, TIMP-3 has been detected in cartilage (21Su S.

Int. 1999; 18: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and shown to have a high binding affinity for chondroitin sulfate polysaccharides, a binding affinity not found in the other 3 members of the family (TIMP-1, -2, -4) (22Pavloff N. Staskus P. Kishnani N. Hawkes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17321-17326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Yu W.-H. Yu S.C. Meng Q. Brew K. Woessner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31226-31232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Whether TIMP-3 is a physiologically relevant inhibitor of aggrecanase activity in cartilage has yet to be established. Recently, Mort et al. (24Mort, J. S., Smookler, D., Khokha, R., and Mahmoodi, M. 2003. 49th Annual Meeting of the Orthopaedic Research Society, New Orleans, February 2–5, 2003, Abstract 0742, Transactions of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Orthopaedic Research SocietyGoogle Scholar) show that aggrecan turnover involving MMP and aggrecanase activity are not under effective TIMP-3 control in an inflammatory arthritis model induced in TIMP-3 null mice, as both wild type and TIMP-3 -/- mice showed similar long term cartilage destruction (24Mort, J. S., Smookler, D., Khokha, R., and Mahmoodi, M. 2003. 49th Annual Meeting of the Orthopaedic Research Society, New Orleans, February 2–5, 2003, Abstract 0742, Transactions of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Orthopaedic Research SocietyGoogle Scholar). These data suggest that other inhibitors may be important in the regulation of aggrecanase activity. To date no other protein inhibitors of ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 have been identified. α2-Macroglobulin (α2M), a general endoproteinase inhibitor, is a noncovalent tetramer of two 370-kDa disulfide-linked homodimers that circulates in blood at concentrations of ∼2–4 mg/ml and is also found in the joint fluid at similar concentrations (25Hadler N. Johnson A. Spitznagel J. Quinet R. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1981; 40: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Chu C. Howard G. Misra U. Pizzo S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 291-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). α2M is active against most endoproteinases. Each subunit of the α2M molecule contains a region referred to as the “bait region,” a short stretch of amino acids (beginning at Pro667 and ending at Thr705) that is very susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. When cleaved by an enzyme the macroglobulin changes shape in such a way as to trap the proteinase inside, resulting in inhibition of proteolytic activity by preventing substrate access to the active site of the proteinases through steric hindrance (27Barrett A. Starkey P. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 28Sottrup-Jensen L. Stepanik T.M. Kristensen T. Wierbzbicki D.M. Jones C.M. Lonblad P.B. Magnusson S.

The conformational changes initiated by bait region cleavage also cause activation of internal thiol esters formed from Cys949 and Glx952 in each subunit of α2M (30Sottrup-Jensen L. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. FEBS Lett. 1980; 121: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The activated thiol esters provide α2M with a potential for covalent cross-linking of the activating proteinase through ϵ-lysyl (proteinase)-γ glutamyl-(α2M) bonds and also for binding of other nucleophils present at activation (31Salvesen G.S. Sayers C.A. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 32Sottrup-Jensen L. Petersen T. Magnusson S. FEBS Lett. 1981; 128: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). α2M does not inhibit endoproteinases that are highly specific for one or a limited number of sequences, such as tissue kallikrein, urokinase, coagulation factor XIIa, and endoproteinase Lys-C (27Barrett A. Starkey P. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Whether α2M can inhibit ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 activity by proteolysis of the bait region has not been investigated, although it has been shown that a related enzyme, ADAMTS-1, which can cleave purified aggrecan in vitro in the IGD at Glu373, forms an SDS-stable complex with α2M (14Sandy J. Westling J. Kenagy R. Iruela-Arispe M. Verscharen C. Rodriguez-Mazaneque J. Zimmermann D. Lemire J. Fischer J. Wight T. Clowes A. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Analysis of the 39 amino acids representing the bait region reveals 5 glutamic acids, Glu673, Glu678, Glu686, Glu701, and Glu702, raising the possibility that ADAMTS-4/-5 may cleave α2M. Therefore, the goals of the present studies were to determine 1) if α2M can inhibit ADAMTS-4/-5 cleavage of aggrecan, 2) if inhibition is triggered by proteolysis of the bait region within the macroglobulin molecule, and 3) the aggrecanase site of cleavage within α2M. Materials—α2M was purchased from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). Full-length ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 were cloned and expressed in Drosophila Sf9 cells at Pfizer as previously described (6Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.C. Abbaszade I. Hollis J.M. Liu R.

A truncated form of ADAMTS-4 beginning with residue Met1, ending with residue Pro431, and lacking the disintegrin and thrombospondin motifs was expressed at Dupont Pharmaceuticals in Drosophila cells, as described previously (34Tortorella M.

The hydroxamic acids XS309 ([3S-[3R*,2-[2R*,2-(R*,S*)]-hexahydro-2-(2-[2-(hydroxyamino)-1-methyl-2-oxyethyl]-4-methyl-1-oxypentyl]-N-methyl]-3-pyridazinecarboxamide) and BB-16 (2S,2R,6S-3-aza-4-oxo-10-oxa-5-hexyl-2-(methylcarboxamido)-10-paracyclophane-6-N-hydroxycarboxamide) were synthesized at DuPont Pharmaceuticals. XS309 is a nanomolar inhibitor of a large number of MMPs but is inactive at <10 μm in blocking ADAMTS-4/ADAMTS-5. In contrast, BB-16 is a nanomolar inhibitor of both MMPs and ADAMTS-4/ADAMTS-5 (35Tortorella M.D. Malfait A.M. Decicco C. Arner E. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 539-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Compound SC81956 (s)-2-dimethylamino-N-hydroxy-3,3-dimethyl-4-[(4-phenoxyphenyl)sulfonyl]butanamide) was synthesized at Pfizer and is a potent nanomolar inhibitor of both ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5. Methylamine and EDTA were purchased from Sigma. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, 8% and 4–12% gels were purchased from Invitrogen. Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain and destain were purchased from Bio-Rad. TIMP-3 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). A polyclonal antibody that recognizes native and denatured α2M was purchased from RDI (Flanders, NJ). MMP-3 and MMP-13 were cloned and expressed at Pfizer. MMP-25 was a kind gift from Dr. Duanqing Pei (University of Minnesota). Human osteoarthritic synovial fluids were obtained from Dr. Kosei Ijiri (Orthopaedic Surgery Department, Kagoshima University, Japan). Samples were spun to remove cells and frozen at -80 °C for shipment to the United States. Neoepitope Antibodies—Polyclonal neoepitope antibodies were prepared (Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Hopkinton, MA) to the peptide sequences YESDVM and GRGHAR that are present on the C terminus and N terminus of the α2M subunit, respectively, generated by cleavage at the Met690/Gly691 bond. A polyclonal neoepitope antibody to the peptide sequence AGEGPSGI that is present on the N terminus of aggrecan fragments generated by cleavage at the Glu1771/Ala1772 bond was prepared as described previously (10Tortorella M.D. Pratta M. Liu R.Q. Austin J. Ross O.H. Abbaszade I. Burn T. Arner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18566-18573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Intact undigested aggrecan was not detected by the anti-AGEGPSGI antibody. Only the immunizing peptide for the antibody blocked binding to the antigen, whereas the spanning peptide (TQAPTAQEAGEGPSGI) did not block binding, indicating that the antibody does not recognize the same sequence when present within uncleaved aggrecan. Inhibition of ADAMTS-4/-5 by α2M—45 μl of 2× buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm CaCl2, and 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) were added to 25 μl of buffer (5 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing ADAMTS-4 or -5 followed by 25 μl of buffer (5 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing α2M at a range of concentrations (concentrations based on the Mr of the tetramer). After incubation of samples for 2 h at 37 °C, 5 μl of aggrecan in water were added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The concentration of aggrecan was determined in the dimethylmethylene blue assay as previously described (36Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2905) Google Scholar). Final concentrations in the reaction mixture were 25 nm ADAMTS-4 or ADAMTS-5, 500 nm aggrecan, and α2M at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 27.5, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100, and 150 nm. Reactions were quenched by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm. The products were analyzed for cleavage of aggrecan at Glu1771 by Western blot analysis using the 1772AGEG neoepitope antibody. The densitometric response was found to be linear over the density ranges required for the blots as assessed by loading varying amounts of AGEG product and quantifying the immunoreactive bands by scanning densitometry using the software OneDscan. Active site concentrations were determined by fitting these data to the equation y = ymax (Eo - Io)/(Eo - Ioexp(kit(Io - Eo))) (37Downing M. Bloom J. Mann K. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2649-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), where y is the measured 1772AGEG product, ymax is the amount of product in the absence of α2M, ki is the second-order rate constant, t is time, and Eo and Io are the initial concentrations of enzyme and α2M, respectively. For this purpose the nonlinear curve-fitting program “the nonlinear regression software package GraFit” (Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK) was used, and the second-order rate constants were fixed at 105 and 104m-1 s-1 for ADAMTS-4 and -5, respectively. Time-dependent inhibition of ADAMTS-4/-5 by α2M—45 μl of 2 × buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm CaCl2, and 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) were added to 25 μl of buffer containing ADAMTS-4 at 2 nm or -5 at a concentration of 20 nm followed by 25 μl of buffer containing α2M at 10 or 30 nm (ADAMTS-4 experiment) or α2M at 100 or 300 nm (ADAMTS-5 experiment). After the incubation for various times at 37 °C, aggrecan was added to a final concentration of 500 nm in a volume of 5 μl, and samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm, and the products were analyzed for cleavage of aggrecan at Glu1771 by Western blot analysis using the 1772AGEG neoepitope antibody. Control experiments showed no inhibition of ADAMTS-4 or -5 activity if α2M and aggrecan were added at the same time without any preincubation. Thus, aggrecan appeared to be a completely effective inhibitor of α2M action under these conditions. Calculation of Second Order Rate Constants—Time-dependent inhibition data was analyzed by several different methods to estimate second-order rate constants for the reaction between α2M and ADAMTS-4 and -5. The time course of inactivation at each concentration of enzyme and α2M was fit to a single exponential to yield observed inactivation rates of 0.109 and 0.330 min-1 for 0.5 nm ADAMTS-4 in the presence of 2.5 and 7.5 nm α2M and 0.115 and 0.328 min-1 for 5 nm ADAMTS-5 in the presence of 25 and 75 nm α2M, respectively. The linear dependence of inactivation rate on α2M concentration suggested that at these concentrations it was proper to analyze this reaction as a simple second-order process. Dividing these observed rates by the α2M concentration gave estimates for the second-order rate constants for ADAMTS-4 and -5, respectively. Inactivation data was also fit globally using the numerical integration software package, DYNAFIT (38Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar) using the simple second-order model E + I → EI to yield estimates for ADAMTS-4 and -5, respectively. Finally, because of the scarcity of data points during the 0–10-min time range when most of the inactivation took place, the second-order rate constant was calculated directly (i.e. without curve fitting) from the extent of inactivation observed at 5 and/or 10 min using the equation ki = ln(([E0([I]0 - [EI]))/([I]0([E]0 - [EI])))/(t([I]0 - [E]0)), where ki is the second-order rate constant, [E]0 is the total enzyme concentration, [I]0 is the total α2M concentration, and [EI] is the concentration of enzyme-α2M complex at time t (37Downing M. Bloom J. Mann K. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2649-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Inactivation of α2M by Methylamine—10 mg/ml α2M was incubated with 100 mm sodium borate, pH 8.6, in the presence or absence of 400 mm methylamine for 2 h at 37 °C (39Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Sayers C.A. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the untreated and methylamine-treated α2M were tested for their ability to inhibit ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5. Cleavage of α2M by ADAMTS-4/-5—ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 at a concentration of 200 or 112 nm, respectively, were incubated with 250 nm α2M in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, for 4 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the products were analyzed for total protein by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Cleavage of α2M by Truncated ADAMTS-4 —250 nm α2M was incubated with 200 mm mature truncated ADAMTS-4 (Phe213-Pro431) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, for 2 h at 37 °C. After the digestions cleaved α2M was detected by SDSPAGE using an 8% gel followed by Coomassie staining. Truncated ADAMTS-4, lacking the C-terminal disintegrin-like and thrombospondin domains (Met1-Pro431), was expressed in Drosophila cells. When truncated or full-length ADAMTS-4 are expressed in these cells, the prodomain is removed by cleavage at Arg212/Phe213 by a furin-like activity found in insect cells, resulting in the production of active enzyme. No latent form of the enzyme was detected in the conditioned media. Aggrecan Isolation—Nasal septa were removed from bovine noses obtained fresh from the slaughterhouse (Covance, Denver, PA). The cartilage was sliced, and aggrecan was extracted by stirring at 4 °C for 48 h in 10 volumes of 4 m guanidinium-HCl in 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.8, containing the protease inhibitors, 0.01 m EDTA, 0.1 m 6-aminohexanoic acid, 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05 m benzamidine HCl. Aggrecan monomers were isolated by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation in cesium chloride, and the bottom fraction of this gradient (d > 1.54 g/ml) containing aggrecan monomers was dialyzed at 4 °C against water, lyophilized, and stored at -20 °C. Deglycosylation of Aggrecan Products—For analysis of fragments by Western blot aggrecan was enzymatically deglycosylated with chondroitinase ABC (0.1 unit/10 μg of aggrecan), keratanase (0.1 unit/10 μg of aggrecan), and keratanase II (0.002 unit/10 μg of aggrecan) for 3 h at 37 °C in buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 6.5. After digestion the aggrecan was precipitated with 5 volumes of acetone and reconstituted in 30 μl of Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer containing 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol and heated for 10 min at 95 °C. Western Blot Analysis—α2M or aggrecan product for each sample was loaded on a 4–12% Tris-glycine gel and separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunolocated with a 1:1000 dilution of YESDVM690 or 691GRGHAR (for detecting α2M) or 1772AGEG (for detecting aggrecan) neoepitope antibody. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate as the secondary antibody. Products were visualized by developing the blots in nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color developing reagent. Overnight transfer resulted in complete transfer of both low and high molecular fragments, and the densitometric response was found to be linear over the density ranges required for the blots. N-terminal Sequencing—α2M at a concentration of 1 μm was incubated with ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 at a concentration of 200 or 448 nm, respectively for 4 h at 37 °C. After the incubation, the products were separated by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The proteins were detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and the bands of interest were excised, placed onto a polystyrene-treated glass filter, and sequenced in an Applied Biosystem 477A plus liquid sequencer with on-line 120A phenylthiohydantoin analysis. Cleavage of α2M Peptides—The following peptides were synthesized on an ABI solid phase peptide synthesizer using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protection chemistry: MGRG, VMGRGH, DVMGRGHA, SDVMGRGHAR, ESDVMGRGHAR, and YESDVMGRGHAR. 10 μm of each peptide (100 μl of total volume) in buffer containing 100 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35, pH 7.5, were incubated with ADAMTS-4 or ADAMTS-5 at a concentration of 50 nm. The digests were carried out for 18 h at 37 °C and analyzed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography followed by electrospray mass spectrometry to verify cleavage and determine the site of cleavage from the mass of the fragments if generated. Detection of the GRGH Neoepitope in Osteoarthritic Synovial Fluid— Synovial fluids were collected from patients with radiographic and symptomatic knee OA. Synovial fluids were diluted 100-fold in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, and either analyzed for the presence of the GRGH neoepitope by Western blot analysis or incubated with ADAMTS-4 at a concentration of 50 nm for 1 h at 37 °C. After the reactions cleavage of endogenous α2M at Met690/Gly691 was monitored by Western blot analysis using the polyclonal antibody against α2M or the 691GRGHAR neoepitope antibody. Inhibition of ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 by α2M—We first examined the ability of α2M to block ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 cleavage of aggrecan. ADAMTS-4 or ADAMTS-5 at a concentration of 25 nm (determined by active site titration with TIMP-3) were preincubated with α2M at varying concentrations for 2 h at 37 °C. After the preincubation aggrecan was added to a final concentration of 500 nm, and the reactions were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were subsequently analyzed for aggrecan products generated by cleavage at the Glu1771/Ala1772 bond by Western blot analysis using the 1772AGEG neoepitope antibody. α2M effectively inhibited both ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 cleavage of aggrecan in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B), showing"

The mechanism of Hxk2-dependent glucose repression pathway is not well understood, but the Mig1-dependent part of the pathway has been elucidated in great detail. Here we report that Hxk2 has a glucose-regulated nuclear localization and that Mig1, a transcriptional repressor responsible for glucose repression of many genes, is required to sequester Hxk2 into the nucleus. Mig1 and Hxk2 interacted in vivo in a yeast two-hybrid assay and in vitro in immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments. We found that the Lys6-Met15 decapeptide of Hxk2, which is necessary for nuclear localization of the protein, is also essential for interaction with the Mig1 protein. Our results also show that the Hxk2-Mig1 interaction is of physiological significance because both proteins have been found interacting together in a cluster with DNA fragments containing the MIG1 site of SUC2 promoter. We conclude that Hxk2 operates by interacting with Mig1 to generate a repressor complex located in the nucleus of S. cerevisiae during growth in glucose medium.

We conclude that Hxk2 operates by interacting with Mig1 to generate a repressor complex located in the nucleus of S. cerevisiae during growth in glucose medium. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can use different carbon sources for growth, but evolution has selected mechanisms for the preferential and efficient utilization of glucose. In this yeast, glucose regulates carbon utilization mainly by the repression or activation of the transcription of numerous genes that encode enzymes implicated in carbon metabolism (1Gancedo J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 334-361Google Scholar, 2Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Google Scholar). Although several of the genes implicated in the pathways that control glucose repression have been identified, a complete mechanistic picture of the process is not yet available. The Hxk2 and Mig1 proteins participate as important repressors in the glucose signaling pathway (3Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2891-2898Google Scholar, 4Entian K.D. Zimmermann F.K. Scheel I. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 156: 99-105Google Scholar). Hxk2 is the protein that initiates the intracellular metabolism of glucose by its phosphorylation at C-6, but in addition it plays a vital role in glucose repression (5Moreno F. Herrero P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 83-90Google Scholar). In hxk2 mutants repression of several genes by glucose is no longer operative (6Rose M. Albig W. Entian K.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 19: 511-518Google Scholar, 7Entian K.D. Barnett J.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1992; 17: 506-510Google Scholar). If Hxk2 acts as a transcriptional repressor, it should be found in the cell nucleus at least under certain conditions. In fact, results obtained using different approaches have demonstrated that about 15% of the protein is localized in the nucleus (8Randez-Gil F. Herrero P. Sanz P. Prieto J.A. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 475-478Google Scholar, 9Herrero P. Martínez-Campa C. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 71-76Google Scholar) and that this localization is required for glucose repression of SUC2, HXK1, and GLK1 genes (9Herrero P. Martínez-Campa C. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 71-76Google Scholar, 10Rodríguez A. de la Cera T. Herrero P. Moreno F. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 625-631Google Scholar). Moreover it has been shown that the nuclear Hxk2 is involved in the formation of specific DNA-protein complexes during glucose-dependent repression of these genes (9Herrero P. Martínez-Campa C. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 71-76Google Scholar, 10Rodríguez A. de la Cera T. Herrero P. Moreno F. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 625-631Google Scholar). Mig1 is a C2H2 zinc finger protein that binds to the motif WWWWWN(G/C)(C/T)GGGG in several promoters (11Lundin M. Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1979-1985Google Scholar). Once bound to this MIG1 element, it recruits the Tup1-Cyc8 (Ssn6p) complex that represses gene transcription during growth in glucose (12Treitel M.A. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3132-3136Google Scholar). The activity of Mig1 is regulated by phosphorylation and subcellular localization. In high glucose, Mig1 is dephosphorylated by the Glc7-Reg1 protein phosphatase complex (13Alms G.R. Sanz P. Carlson M. Haystead T.A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4157-4168Google Scholar) and is located in the nucleus where it can repress transcription; upon glucose removal, Mig1 is rapidly phosphorylated by Snf1 protein kinase complex (14Treitel M.A. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6273-6280Google Scholar, 15DeVit M.J. Johnston M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1231-1241Google Scholar) and translocated into the cytoplasm (16DeVit M.J. Waddle J.A. Johnston M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1603-1618Google Scholar). The functions of both Hxk2 and Mig1 have been extensively studied, but there is no information about possible interactions among them in the repression pathway. It has been shown that a DNA fragment of the SUC2 promoter that interacts with Mig1 is also able to interact with Med8 (9Herrero P. Martínez-Campa C. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 71-76Google Scholar, 17de la Cera T. Herrero P. Moreno-Herrero F. Chaves R.S. Moreno F. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 703-714Google Scholar). Since it is known that Hxk2 interacts with Med8 (17de la Cera T. Herrero P. Moreno-Herrero F. Chaves R.S. Moreno F. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 703-714Google Scholar) it was a logical question to ask whether Hxk2 and Mig1 could interact. We approached this question using different techniques, and we demonstrate here that Hxk2 interacts specifically with Mig1 both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore we mapped the interacting domain of Hxk2 and show that its Lys6-Met15 decapeptide is necessary both for nuclear localization and for the interaction with Mig1. We also show that the nuclear localization of Hxk2 is regulated by glucose and depends on Mig1. Strains and Growth Media—Yeast two-hybrid experiments utilized strain Y187 (MATα ura3-52 his3-200 ade2-101 trp1-901 leu2-3,112 gal4Δ gal80Δ URA3::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-lacZ). Co-precipitation experiments utilized yeast strain DBY2184 (MATα hxk2-202 ura3-52 leu2-3,2-112 lys2-801 gal2) (18Ma H. Botstein D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4046-4052Google Scholar). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence experiments utilized yeast strains DBY2184, H250 (MATα SUC2 ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1 mig1-δ2::LEU2) (3Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2891-2898Google Scholar), and FMY301 (MATα mig1::LEU2 hxk2-202 ura3-52 leu2-3,2-112 lys2-801 gal2). FMY301 strain was created by homologous recombination with the loxP-LEU2-loxP marker by using the method of PCR synthesis of marker cassettes (19Gueldener U. Heinisch J. Koehler G.J. Voss D. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e23Google Scholar). Escherichia coli MC1061 (hsdR mcrB araD139Δ(araABC-leu)7679Δlacx74 galU galK rpsL thi) was the host bacterial strain for the recombinant plasmid constructions. Fusion protein expression was performed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Promega). Yeast cells were grown in the following media: YEPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, and 1% yeast extract), YEPE (3% ethanol, 2% peptone, and 1% yeast extract), and synthetic media containing the appropriate carbon source and lacking appropriate supplements to maintain selection for plasmids (2% glucose (SD) or 3% ethanol and 0.05% glucose (SE) and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids). Amino acids and other growth requirements were added at a final concentration of 20-150 μg/ml. The solid media contained 2% agar in addition to the components described above. Enzymatic Analysis—Invertase activity was assayed in whole cells as described previously (20Gascón S. Lampen J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1567-1572Google Scholar) and expressed as micromoles of glucose released/minute/100 mg of cells (dry weight). General DNA Techniques—Routine DNA manipulations were essentially performed as described previously (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Construction of Plasmid DNAs—The plasmids used in this study are described in Table I. Hxk2 is numbered from residues 1 to 485 (22Entian K.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 178: 633-637Google Scholar), and Mig1 is numbered from residues 1 to 504 (23Tettelin H. Agostoni Carbone M.L. Albermann K. Albers M. Arroyo J. Backes U. Barreiros T. Bertani I. Bjourson A.J. Bruckner M. Bruschi C.V. Carignani G. Castagnoli L. Cerdan E. Clemente M.L. Coblenz A. Coglievina M. Coissac E. Defoor E. Del Bino S. Delius H. Delneri D. de Wergifosse P. Dujon B. Kleine K. et al.Nature. 1997; 387: 81-84Google Scholar). In Hxk2, residue 1 is a valine because the initiator methionine is cleaved off in the primary translation product. In Mig1, residue 1 is the initiator methionine in the primary translation product. The plasmids carrying partial segments of a gene and the encoded products are named according to the codons/amino acids that are retained in the constructs. Plasmid pACT2/HXK2 carried a 1458-bp EcoRI/BamHI fragment with the complete coding region of HXK2 gene in pACT2 (24Li L. Elledge S.J. Peterson C.A. Bales E.S. Legerski R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5012-5016Google Scholar). The HXK2 insert was synthesized by PCR using plasmid pSP73-HG (9Herrero P. Martínez-Campa C. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 71-76Google Scholar) as the template with the primer pair OL1 + OL2 (Table II). Plasmid pGBKT7/MIG1 carried a 1515-bp BamHI-BamHI fragment with the complete coding region of MIG1 gene in pGBKT7 (Clontech).

To make plasmid pGADT7/HXK2-136 a 408-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment, obtained from pGADT7/HXK2 and carrying a 1050-bp deletion in the 3′-end of HXK2 DNA, was first subcloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pUK21 and then isolated as an EcoRI-BamHI fragment and ligated into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGADT7. To make plasmid pGADT7/HXK2-87 a 261-bp EcoRI-Asp718 fragment, obtained from pGADT7/HXK2 and carrying a 1197-bp deletion in the 3′-end of HXK2 DNA, was first subcloned into the EcoRI and Asp718 sites of pSP73 and then isolated as an EcoRI-BamHI fragment and ligated into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGADT7. Plasmid pGADT7/HXK2ΔK6M15 carried a 1428-bp EcoRI/BamHI fragment containing a HXK2 mutant gene (HXK2ΔK6M15) with a 30-bp deletion between nucleotides +19 and +48 in pGADT7 (Clontech). The expression of this mutant gene generates a truncated Hxk2 protein with specific activity similar to the wild-type hexokinase 2 but without the amino acids from Lys6 to Met15 (9Herrero P. Martínez-Campa C. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 71-76Google Scholar). The HXK2ΔK6M15 insert was synthesized by PCR using plasmid pSP73/HXK2ΔK6M15 (9Herrero P. Martínez-Campa C. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 71-76Google Scholar) as the template with the primer pair OL5 + OL6 (Table II). The Gal4 activation domain (GAD) 1The abbreviations used are: GAD, Gal4 activation domain; HA, hemagglutinin; GBD, Gal4 binding domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Ura, uracil. fusion plasmids were constructed in the vectors pACT2 or pGADT7 and have an HA epitope tag at the N terminus of the inserted DNA. GST fusions vectors pGEX/HXK2, pGEX/HXK2ΔK6M15, and pGEX/MIG1 were constructed as follows. Plasmids pGEX/HXK2 and pGEX/HXK2ΔK6M15 were constructed by subcloning EcoRI-XhoI fragments obtained, respectively, from plasmids pGADT7/HXK2 and pGADT7/HXK2ΔK6M15 in-frame into the same sites of pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmid pGEX/MIG1 was constructed by subcloning a BamHI-BamHI fragment from plasmid pGBKT7/MIG1 in-frame into the same site of pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA sequence of all PCR-generated constructs was verified by sequencing. The yeast expression vectors YEp352/HXK2, /HXK2ΔK6M15, YEp352/HXK2::gfp, YEp352/HXK2ΔK6M15::gfp, and YEp351/MIG1 were constructed as follows. Plasmids YEp352/HXK2 and YEp352/HXK2ΔK6M15 were constructed as described previously (8Randez-Gil F. Herrero P. Sanz P. Prieto J.A. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 475-478Google Scholar). Plasmids YEp352/HXK2::gfp and YEp352/HXK2ΔK6M15::gfp were constructed as follows. A 969-bp BamHI-BglII fragment containing the gfp gene was subcloned into YEp352/HXK2 or YEp352/HXK2ΔK6M15 (8Randez-Gil F. Herrero P. Sanz P. Prieto J.A. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 475-478Google Scholar) plasmids first cleaved with BamHI. Plasmid YEp351/MIG1 was constructed as follows. A 2774-bp SacI-SacI fragment containing the complete coding region of MIG1 gene and 565 bp of the 5′-non-coding region promoter was subcloned into previously SacI-cleaved vector YEp351. The resulting plasmid YEp351/MIG1 contains in a 2.77-kb SacI-SacI fragment the complete MIG1 gene under the control of its own promoter. All the clones used were verified by sequencing analysis of fusion points. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—The yeast two-hybrid analysis (25Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Google Scholar) utilized yeast vectors pGADT7, pACT2, and pGBKT7 and host strain Y187 (described above) as supplied in the Matchmaker two-hybrid system 3 from Clontech. Yeasts were grown in SD-Leu-,Trp- medium. Assays for β-galactosidase activity followed protocols described in the Clontech manual. Qualitative assessment of expression from the lacZ reporter gene was made using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) as a chromogenic substrate for β-galactosidase in a colony lift filter assay. For quantitative determination of β-galactosidase activity, the absorbance at 420 nm of o-nitrophenol released from the substrate o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside was normalized to total protein and is reported as milliunits/mg of protein. Expression levels of the GAD and Gal4 binding domain (GBD) fusion proteins were controlled by Western blot analysis for each experiment. Experiments were performed a minimum of three times. Values shown are representative results from individual experiments. Antibodies and Immunological Methods—GBD and GAD fusion proteins were detected using c-Myc monoclonal antibody and HA tag polyclonal antibody, respectively. Native and recombinant Hxk2p were detected using polyclonal antibody anti-Hxk2 (8Randez-Gil F. Herrero P. Sanz P. Prieto J.A. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 475-478Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed by using whole cell extracts prepared as reported previously (26Chaves R.S. Herrero P. Moreno F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 345-350Google Scholar). Extracts were incubated with antibody anti-Hxk2p for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were then added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washes with Staph A buffer (150 mm NaCl, 101 mm Na2HPO4, 18 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3, 20% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 5% deoxycholate), immunoprecipitated samples were boiled in SDS loading buffer. The supernatant was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot using anti-HA antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A by the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). GST Pull-down Experiments—GST fusion protein expression vectors (pGEX/HXK2, pGEX/HXK2ΔK6M15, and pGEX/MIG1) were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells were grown to A600 0.5-0.8, induced with 0.6 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h, and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 101 mm Na2HPO4, 18 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3) and sonicated. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (17,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) beads were incubated with soluble extracts for 1 h at 4 °C, washed extensively with PBS buffer, and resuspended in the same buffer. The GST-Hxk2 and GST-Hxk2ΔK6M15 fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 2.5 units of thrombin (2 h at 4 °C) for site-specific separation of the GST affinity tag from Hxk2 and Hxk2ΔK6M15 proteins. Equal amounts of GST-Mig1p coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with Hxk2 and Hxk2ΔK6M15 purified proteins for 1 h at 4 °C in PBS buffer. Beads were gently washed five times with 2.5 ml of PBS buffer, boiled in 25 μl of sample loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot using anti-Hxk2p antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A. Bound antibodies were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence Microscopy—Yeast strains expressing the Hxk2-GFP or Hxk2ΔK6M15-GFP fusion proteins were grown to early log phase (A600 of less than 0.7) in synthetic media containing the appropriate carbon source and lacking the appropriate supplements to maintain selection plasmids. Nuclei of cells from 1-ml cultures were stained by addition of 2 μg of DAPI to the media and incubated at 28 °C for 60 min. Cells were washed with water, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 10 μl of water, and then 4 μl of the suspension was placed on a microscope slide. GFP and DAPI localization in live cultures was monitored by direct fluorescence using a Leica DMR-XA fluorescence microscope. Images were taken with a Leica Q550 camera using Leica QWin software and processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. DNA Probes and Gel Retardation Assays—To investigate interaction of Mig1 with the sequence carrying the MIG1 element of SUC2 promoter we reconstituted the fragment from two complementary oligonucleotides (MIG1SUC2 sense, 5′-tcgaGGAAATTATCCGGGGGCGA-3′; MIG1SUC2 antisense, 5′-tcgaTCGCCCCCGGATAATTTCC-3′). The complementary strands were annealed and either end was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by fill-in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The labeled double-stranded DNA was used as probe, and the unlabeled double-stranded DNA was used as competitor in gel retardation assays. In all cases the oligonucleotides were synthesized with an added TCGA nucleotide overhang at the 5′-terminal end. Binding reactions contained 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1-5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.5 ng of end-labeled DNA in a volume of 25 μl. When unlabeled competitor DNA was added, its amount was 20 ng. The binding reaction mixtures included 3 μg (6 μl) of the corresponding purified protein, and after 30 min of incubation at room temperature they were loaded onto 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was carried out at 10 V/cm of gel for 45 min-1 h in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). Gels were dried and autoradiographed at -70 °C with an intensifying screen. Hxk2 Interacts with Mig1 in Vivo and in Vitro—Hxk2, Mig1, and Med8 form part of the same protein complex that interacts with a regulatory element of the SUC2 promoter (9Herrero P. Martínez-Campa C. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 71-76Google Scholar, 17de la Cera T. Herrero P. Moreno-Herrero F. Chaves R.S. Moreno F. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 703-714Google Scholar, 26Chaves R.S. Herrero P. Moreno F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 345-350Google Scholar, 27Moreno-Herrero F. Herrero P. Colchero J. Baró A.M. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 427-432Google Scholar). However, an interaction between Hxk2 and Mig1 proteins has not been demonstrated. To test this possibility, we used a yeast two-hybrid assay. The pGBKT7/MIG1 plasmid (see “Experimental Procedures”) was co-transformed with a plasmid expressing a fusion of the Gal4 activation domain with Hxk2 into an appropriate reporter strain. The interaction between both proteins was monitored by β-galactosidase expression levels with a filter assay and a liquid culture assay. As shown in Fig. 1, the full-length Mig1 produced a strong interaction with Hxk2 (Fig. 1B). As control for the expression of the various constructs, the full-length Hxk2 or its truncated versions fused to the GAD were individually co-transformed into a yeast strain with a construct encoding the GBD alone (Fig. 1B), and the full-length Mig1 fused to the GBD was co-transformed into a yeast strain with a construct encoding the GAD alone (Fig. 1C). To identify the domains of Hxk2 that are important for interaction with Mig1, subfragments of Hxk2 were similarly tested for interaction with Mig1. As shown in Fig. 1B, Hxk2-416, Hxk2-136, and Hxk2-87 proteins were able to interact with the full-length Mig1. These results indicate that the interacting domain of Hxk2 might include a motif of its N-terminal region. Since the N-terminal region of Hxk2 contains a decapeptide (Lys6-Met15), which is necessary for the nuclear localization of the protein (9Herrero P. Martínez-Campa C. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 71-76Google Scholar), we tested whether this motif is necessary for Mig1 interaction. As can be seen in Fig. 1B a truncated Hxk2 version lacking those 10 residues (Hxk2ΔK6M15) did not shown interaction with Mig1 in our assay. The lack of interaction cannot be attributed to lack of expression as the GAD-Hxk2ΔK6M15 fusion protein was detected by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2). The interaction between Hxk2 and Mig1 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays in cells expressing HA-Mig1 as a fusion protein and Hxk2 or Hxk2ΔK6M15 as the only hexokinase 2 isoenzyme. Cell extracts from an hxk2 mutant strain transformed with plasmid YEp352/HXK2 or YEp352/HXK2ΔK6M15 were immunoprecipitated with the antibodies indicated in Fig. 3A. The resulting immunoprecipitates were assayed for the presence of Mig1 by immunoblot analysis with anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3A, a strong and specific signal of Mig1 was observed only with samples immunoprecipitated with anti-Hxk2 antibody in the strain expressing the full-length Hxk2; no signals were observed when the experiment was done using the strain expressing the Hxk2ΔK6M15 protein, although as can be seen in Fig. 3B, lane 1, HXK2ΔK6M15 protein is recognized by the anti-Hxk2 antibody. When an anti-Pho4 antibody or no antibody was used to detect unspecific immunoprecipitation and unspecific protein binding to anti-HA-Mig1 antibody, respectively, no signals were observed. Thus, this interaction is dependent on the production of HA-tagged Mig1 and full-length Hxk2 as well as anti-Hxk2 antibody. Since it could be thought that some unknown proteins in the extract could mediate the interaction between Hxk2 and Mig1 we tried to show direct interaction of Mig1 with Hxk2 using purified proteins in pull-down assays. We used purified Hxk2 and Hxk2ΔK6M15 proteins and a bacterially produced GST-Mig1 fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 3B, a strong and specific retention was observed in the case of full-length Hxk2, while no retention was detected with the sample containing the truncated protein Hxk2ΔK6M15. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Hxk2 interacts directly with Mig1 in vivo and in vitro and that the 10-amino acid motif, previously identified as essential for Hxk2 translocation to the nucleus, is required for Hxk2-Mig1 interaction. The Nuclear Localization of Hxk2 Is Regulated by Glucose and Is Mig1-dependent—The subcellular localization of Hxk2 in relation with the growth conditions was monitored by fusing the GFP of Aqueora victoria (28Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Google Scholar) to the C-terminal end of Hxk2. The fusion was expressed in several yeast strains from the HXK2 promoter on YEp352/HXK2::gfp plasmid. In cells grown overnight in 2% glucose (SD-Ura-), Hxk2 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, although a small fraction is located in the nucleus (Fig. 4A) in accordance with previous results (8Randez-Gil F. Herrero P. Sanz P. Prieto J.A. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 475-478Google Scholar, 9Herrero P. Martínez-Campa C. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 71-76Google Scholar). In cells grown overnight on 3% ethanol (SE-Ura-), conditions under which repression does not occur, Hxk2 is found in the cytoplasm, apparently excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the cell modulates the Hxk2 regulatory function by controlling the transport of the protein into and out the nucleus. To determine whether Mig1 participates in the regulation of Hxk2 localization, we examined it in a mig1 mutant strain (Fig. 4C). In glucose-grown cells, Hxk2-GFP was in the cytoplasm and was largely excluded from the nucleus, suggesting that in these conditions Mig1 either retains Hxk2 in the nucleus or is necessary to translocate the Hxk2 protein into it. Since it is known that glucose causes a rapid translocation of Mig1 to the nucleus and removal of the sugar results in cytoplasm localization (16DeVit M.J. Waddle J.A. Johnston M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1603-1618Google Scholar) it could be thought that the amount of Hxk2 located in the nucleus under glucose-grown conditions could be dependent on the Mig1 level. To check this, we increased the amount of Mig1 in the cell expressing it from a 2-μm plasmid and examined Hxk2 localization during glucose growth (SD-Ura-Leu-). As can be seen in Fig. 4D, Hxk2-GFP was intensely enriched in the nucleus, and scarce fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm. As a control of this experiment we also used a fusion of the GFP to the C-terminal end of Hxk2ΔK6M15. The construct was expressed in a yeast strain from the HXK2 promoter on YEp352/Hxk2ΔK6M15::gfp plasmid. In cells expressing Mig1 from a 2-μm plasmid during glucose growth (SD-Ura-Leu-), HXK2ΔK6M15 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, apparently excluded from the nucleus.

https://openalex.org/W2001223958,"Long-term synaptic modifications in afferent inputs to the amygdala underlie fear conditioning in animals. Fear conditioning to a single sensory modality does not generalize to other cues, implying that synaptic modifications in fear conditioning pathways are input specific. The mechanisms of pathway specificity of long-term potentiation (LTP) are poorly understood. Here we show that inhibition of glutamate transporters leads to the loss of input specificity of LTP in the amygdala slices, as assessed by monitoring synaptic responses at two independent inputs converging on a single postsynaptic neuron. Diffusion of glutamate (“spillover”) from stimulated synapses, paired with postsynaptic depolarization, is sufficient to induce LTP in the heterosynaptic pathway, whereas an enzymatic glutamate scavenger abolishes this effect. These results establish active glutamate uptake as a crucial mechanism maintaining the pathway specificity of LTP in the neural circuitry of fear conditioning."
https://openalex.org/W2094465035,"Differential adhesion between migrating neurons and transient radial glial fibers enables the deployment of neurons into appropriate layers in the developing cerebral cortex. The identity of radial glial signals that regulate the termination of migration remains unclear. Here, we identified a radial glial surface antigen, SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine)-like 1, distributed predominantly in radial glial fibers passing through the upper strata of the cortical plate (CP) where neurons end their migration. Neuronal migration and adhesion assays indicate that SPARC-like 1 functions to terminate neuronal migration by reducing the adhesivity of neurons at the top of the CP. Cortical neurons fail to achieve appropriate positions in the absence of SPARC-like 1 function in vivo. Together, these data suggest that antiadhesive signaling via SPARC-like 1 on radial glial cell surfaces may enable neurons to recognize the end of migration in the developing cerebral cortex."

https://openalex.org/W2017128903,"Cerebellar Purkinje neurons maintain high firing rates but their synaptic terminals depress only moderately, raising the question of how vesicle depletion is minimized. To identify mechanisms that limit synaptic depression, we evoked 100 Hz trains of GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in cerebellar nuclear neurons by stimulating Purkinje axons in mouse brain slices. The paired-pulse ratio (IPSC(2)/IPSC(1)) of the total IPSC was approximately 1 and the steady-state ratio (IPSC(20)/IPSC(1)) was approximately 0.5, suggesting a high response probability of postsynaptic receptors, without an unusually high release probability. Three-dimensional electron microscopic reconstructions of Purkinje boutons revealed multiple active zones without intervening transporters, suggestive of ""spillover""-mediated transmission. Simulations of boutons with 10-16 release sites, in which transmitter from any site can reach all receptors opposite the bouton, replicated multiple-pulse depression during normal, high, and low presynaptic Ca influx. These results suggest that release from multiple-site boutons limits depletion-based depression, permitting prolonged, high-frequency inhibition at corticonuclear synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2084589403,"Protein kinase C (PKC), a Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, is known as a key enzyme in various cellular responses, including apoptosis. However, the functional role of PKC in apoptosis has not been clarified. In this study, we focused on the involvement of PKCδ in ceramide-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells and examined the importance of spatiotemporal activation of the specific PKC subtype in apoptotic events. Ceramide-induced apoptosis was inhibited by the PKCδ-specific inhibitor rottlerin and also was blocked by knockdown of endogenous PKCδ expression using small interfering RNA. Ceramide induced the translocation of PKCδ to the Golgi complex and the concomitant activation of PKCδ via phosphorylation of Tyr311 and Tyr332 in the hinge region of the enzyme. Unphosphorylatable PKCδ (mutants Y311F and Y332F) could translocate to the Golgi complex in response to ceramide, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is not necessary for translocation. However, ceramide failed to activate PKCδ lacking the C1B domain, which did not translocate to the Golgi complex, but could be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation. These findings suggest that ceramide translocates PKCδ to the Golgi complex and that PKCδ is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in the compartment. Furthermore, we utilized species-specific knockdown of PKCδ by small interfering RNA to study the significance of phosphorylation of Tyr311 and Tyr332 in PKCδ for ceramide-induced apoptosis and found that phosphorylation of Tyr311 and Tyr332 is indispensable for ceramide-induced apoptosis. We demonstrate here that the targeting mechanism of PKCδ, dual regulation of both its activation and translocation to the Golgi complex, is critical for the ceramide-induced apoptotic event.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2346) Google Scholar). The classical PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ), which have a Ca2+-binding region (C2 region) and two cysteine-rich regions, are activated by Ca2+, phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol, or phorbol esters (4Ono Y.

The novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, η, and θ), which lack the C2 region, are activated by phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol or phorbol esters without Ca2+ (5Osada S. Mizuno K. Saido T.-C. Suzuki K. Kuroki T. Ohno S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3930-3938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The atypical PKCs (ζ and ι/λ), which lack the C2 region and have only one cysteine-rich region, are dependent on phosphatidylserine, but are not affected by diacylglycerol, phorbol esters, or Ca2+ (6Ono Y.

Among multiple subtypes of PKC, PKCδ has been implicated as a pro-apoptotic kinase, mostly by acting as a target of caspase-3 (8Blass M. Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), whereas PKCα and PKCϵ inhibit apoptosis by phosphorylating Bcl-2 or by increasing the expression of Bcl-2, respectively (9Gubina E.

Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of PKCδ Protein in HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were purchased from the Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan) and cultured in minimal essential medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin with 10% fetal bovine serum. For lipofection, cDNAs (∼5.5 μg) were transfected into 5 × 106 HeLa cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. Observation of PKCδ-GFP Translocation—HeLa cells expressing PKCδ-GFP fusion proteins were spread onto glass-bottomed culture dishes (Mattek Corp., Ashland, MA) and cultured for at least 16 h before observation. The culture medium was replaced with normal HEPES buffer composed of 135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.3). The fluorescence of GFP was monitored under a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope at 488 nm excitation with a 505/550-nm bandpass barrier filter. All experiments were performed at 37 °C. Data Analysis of PKCδ-GFP Translocation—After treatment with C2-ceramide, the time course of translocation was recorded as a time series of 30 images at 1-min intervals for each experiment. Fluorescence in the Golgi complex, cytoplasm, or nucleoplasm was measured using Zeiss LSM 510 software. Because the PKCδ distribution in the nucleoplasm scarcely changed, the fluorescence intensity in the nucleoplasm was used as spontaneous photobleaching of GFP fluorescence by scanning. The fluorescence intensity in each region is defined as the fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm or Golgi complex divided by the fluorescence intensity in the nucleoplasm in a 5–10-μm2 region of interest. For each time point, the Golgi or cytoplasmic fluorescence was calculated in at least five different regions of interest. These values were averaged and plotted to generate a time course of translocation. Co-detection of Tyrosine Phosphorylation and PKCδ-GFP Translocation by Ceramide—HeLa cells were fixed before or after ceramide treatment with a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in 0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:200) and with Alexa 546-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:1000) for 30 min. The fluorescence of GFP and Alexa 546 was observed under the confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscope. Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells expressing various types of PKCδ were harvested with 1 ml of homogenate buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 200 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4 (pH 7.4)) and centrifuged at 2000 × g. The cells were resuspended in 300 μl of buffer composed of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4 (pH 7.8) containing 1% Triton X-100 and sonicated (output 5, 50% duty, 10 times at 4 °C; UD-210, Tomy Seiko Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and the supernatant was used after centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 15 min. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatant of the total fraction was incubated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody or anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:100) for 2 h at 4 °C and then with protein A-Sepharose for an additional 2 h. Samples were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and pellets were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ or Mg2+. Finally, the pellets were suspended in 30 μl of phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ or Mg2+ and used for phosphorylation or immunoblot studies as described below. Immunoblot Analysis—The samples were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The polyvinylidene difluoride filters were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:1000), anti-PKCδ polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:1000), anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:2000), or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:1000) for 1 h at 25 °C. The immunoreactive bands were visualized with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:10,000) using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Kinase Assay of PKCδ—PKC activity was assayed by measuring the incorporation of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP into substrate as described (34Konishi H. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. Yamamoto T. Matsuzaki H.

In brief, the kinase activities of FLAG-PKCδ or PKCδ-GFP fusion proteins immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells after stimulation with C2-ceramide or H2O2 (10 μl of suspended pellet) were measured with calf thymus histone H1 as the substrate without any PKC activators such as phosphatidylserine or diolein. The reaction mixture contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 15–50 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP, and 200 μg/ml histone H1. The incubation was carried out for 10 min at 30 °C. RNA Preparation and Endogenous PKCδ Knockdown—21-Nucleotide double-stranded RNAs of human PKCδ were synthesized as described previously (38Irie N. Sakai N. Ueyama T. Kajimoto T. Shirai Y. Saito N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were assayed after 48 h of small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection. For expression of exogenous PKCs, cDNA was transfected after 24 h of siRNA transfection. Measurement of Cell Apoptosis—After various treatments in serumfree minimal essential medium for 24 h, HeLa cells were collected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid for 15 min. The cells were then stained with 1 ml of bisbenzimide (16 μg/ml) in phosphatebuffered saline, and the number of cells showing apoptotic chromatin changes in their nuclei was counted under a fluorescence microscope. Cells with two or more condensed chromatin fragments were considered to be apoptotic. For detection of cytochrome c release from mitochondria, the cells were incubated with anti-cytochrome c antibody and with Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). Role of PKCδ in the Apoptotic Effect of Ceramide—We first investigated the morphological changes in HeLa cells in response to C2-ceramide, a membrane-permeable analog of ceramide. As shown in Fig. 1A, >80% of the ceramide-treated HeLa cells, but not the C2-dihydroceramide (an inactive form of C2-ceramide)-treated cells, showed an altered nuclear structure with condensed chromatin fragments upon bisbenzimide staining), indicating the specificity of the apoptotic action of C2-ceramide. Possible involvement of PKCδ in ceramide-induced apoptosis was examined using the PKCδ-specific inhibitor rottlerin and knockdown of PKCδ by siRNA. Rottlerin significantly inhibited the apoptotic effect of C2-ceramide, reducing the number of apoptotic cells to 23.5% (Fig. 1A) without affecting the basal level of cell apoptosis. Knockdown of endogenous PKCδ in HeLa cells using siRNA from human PKCδ (38Irie N. Sakai N. Ueyama T. Kajimoto T. Shirai Y. Saito N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) significantly inhibited the apoptotic response to C2-ceramide in HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (27Sumitomo M. Ohba M. Asakuma J. Asano T. Kuroki T. Hayakawa M. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) by C2-ceramide treatment was also blocked by knockdown of endogenous PKCδ (Fig. 1C). These findings strongly suggest that activation of PKCδ is indispensable for ceramide-induced apoptosis. PKCδ can be cleaved by a caspase-dependent process during apoptosis (8Blass M. Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 39Koriyama H. Kouchi Z. Umeda T. Saido T.C. Momoi T. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the ability of the cell-permeable caspase-3-specific inhibitor Ac-DMQD-CHO (100 μm) to block the apoptosis induced by C2-ceramide in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, pretreatment of the cells for 1 h with Ac-DMQD-CHO failed to inhibit the apoptotic effect of C2-ceramide. In addition, we examined whether active caspase-3 is expressed in C2-ceramide-treated HeLa cells. Using Western blot analysis, we found that the active form of caspase-3 was expressed in the etoposide-treated cells, but not in the C2-ceramide-treated cells (Fig. 2B). PKCδ Tyrosine Phosphorylation Sites in Ceramide-treated Cells—To determine the phosphorylation sites responsible for ceramide-induced PKCδ activation, we mutated four tyrosine residues (Tyr187, Tyr311, Tyr332, and Tyr512) in PKCδ to phenylalanine, as these tyrosine residues have been identified as the phosphorylation sites responsible for PKCδ activation in response to various stimuli, such as etoposide, platelet-derived growth factor, and H2O2 (8Blass M. Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 31Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Lorenzo P.S. Garfield S.H. Blumberg P.M.

The Y187F and Y512F mutants showed significant phosphorylation by ceramide (as much as wild-type PKCδ), whereas mutation of Tyr311 or Tyr332 evidently reduced the ceramide-induced phosphorylation, and phosphorylation was undetectable in the double mutant Y311F/Y332F (Fig. 3A). Antibodies against phosphopeptides corresponding to each phosphorylation site (Tyr311 or Tyr332) demonstrated that both Tyr311 and Tyr332 were phosphorylated after ceramide treatment (Fig. 3B). Ceramide-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ was blocked by herbimycin A and PP2, inhibitors of Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (Fig. 3C). To study the correlation between phosphorylation of Tyr311 and Tyr332 and the kinase activity of PKCδ, we measured the kinase activities of immunoprecipitated PKCδ and its mutants in HeLa cells with and without ceramide treatment. As shown in Fig. 4, C2-ceramide increased by 1.5-fold the kinase activities of wild-type PKCδ and the Y187F and Y512F mutants, but the kinase activities of the Y311F, Y332F, and Y311F/Y332F mutants were not altered. As each single mutation of Tyr311 or Tyr332 abolished the ceramide-induced activation, simultaneous phosphorylation of Tyr311 and Tyr332 may be essential for PKCδ activation. Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Activation of PKCδ in the Golgi Complex—We have demonstrated the ceramide-induced activation of PKCδ concomitant with its translocation to the Golgi complex (28Kajimoto T. Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1769-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To determine whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ is required for translocation of PKCδ to the Golgi complex, we investigated the ceramide-induced translocation of GFP-tagged PKCδ, Y311F, Y332F, and Y311F/Y332F in HeLa cells. Similar to wild-type PKCδ, the unphosphorylatable mutants also translocated to the Golgi complex in response to ceramide (Fig. 5). We concluded that the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PKCδ are not necessary for the translocation of PKCδ by ceramide stimulation. As tyrosine phosphorylation is not necessary for the translocation of PKCδ to the Golgi complex, it is possible that PKCδ is tyrosine-phosphorylated after its accumulation in the Golgi complex. To investigate whether PKCδ in the Golgi complex or cytoplasm is tyrosine-phosphorylated after stimulation with C2-ceramide, we visualized the tyrosine phosphorylation in HeLa cells expressing PKCδ-GFP after C2-ceramide treatment for 20 min using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Immunoreactivity for phosphotyrosine (pTyr) accumulated in the perinuclear region and was also found on the plasma membrane as dots (Fig. 6A). pTyr in the perinuclear region co-localized with PKCδ-GFP, but the green fluorescence of PKCδ-GFP in the cytoplasm did not overlap with the red fluorescence of pTyr. This finding suggests that PKCδ is tyrosine-phosphorylated in the perinuclear region. However, pTyr was also observed in the perinuclear region in ceramide-treated HeLa cells expressing Y311F/Y332F PKCδ-GFP. Because a pTyr immunoreaction was also seen in HeLa cells not expressing Y311F/Y332F PKCδ-GFP (Fig. 6A, arrows), it is possible that the tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous PKCδ was detected by anti-pTyr antibody. To distinguish between endogenous and exogenous PKCδ, we utilized the siRNA technique, which reduces the expr"

https://openalex.org/W2072799387,"Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in the hippocampus is critical for memory formation. However, generation of cAMP signals within an optimal range for memory may require a balance between stimulatory and inhibitory mechanisms. The role of adenylyl cyclase inhibitory mechanisms for memory has not been addressed. One of the mechanisms for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase is through activation of Gi-coupled receptors, a mechanism that could serve as a constraint on memory formation. Here we report that ablation of Giα1 by gene disruption increases hippocampal adenylyl cyclase activity and enhances LTP in area CA1. Furthermore, gene ablation of Giα1 or antisense oligonucleotide-mediated depletion of Giα1 disrupted hippocampus-dependent memory. We conclude that Giα1 provides a critical mechanism for tonic inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity in the hippocampus. We hypothesize that loss of Giα1 amplifies the responsiveness of CA1 postsynaptic neurons to stimuli that strengthen synaptic efficacy, thereby diminishing synapse-specific plasticity required for new memory formation."
https://openalex.org/W2016698582,"Synaptotagmins 1 and 7 are candidate Ca(2+) sensors for exocytosis localized to synaptic vesicles and plasma membranes, respectively. We now show that the N-terminal intraluminal sequence of synaptotagmin 1, when transplanted onto synaptotagmin 7, redirects synaptotagmin 7 from the plasma membrane to secretory vesicles. Conversely, mutation of the N-terminal N-glycosylation site of synaptotagmin 1 redirects synaptotagmin 1 from vesicles to the plasma membrane. In cultured hippocampal neurons, the plasma membrane-localized mutant of synaptotagmin 1 suppressed the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles, whereas wild-type synaptotagmin 1 did not. In addition to the intraluminal N-glycosylation site, the cytoplasmic C(2) domains of synaptotagmin 1 were required for correct targeting but could be functionally replaced by the C(2) domains of synaptotagmin 7. Our data suggest that the intravesicular N-glycosylation site of synaptotagmin 1 collaborates with its cytoplasmic C(2) domains in directing synaptotagmin 1 to synaptic vesicles via a novel N-glycosylation-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2019755339,"Oxidative stress frequently leads to altered function of membrane proteins. Isoketals are highly reactive products of the isoprostane pathway of free radical-induced lipid peroxidation that rapidly form covalent protein adducts and exhibit a remarkable proclivity to form protein cross links in vitro. Examination of isoketal adducts from an animal model of oxidative injury revealed that initial adducts were formed by isoketals esterified in phospholipids, representing a novel oxidative injury-associated modification of proteins by phospholipids. Maturation of adducts involved cleavage from phospholipids and conversion of adducts to a more stable chemical form that can be detected for extended periods. Because initial adducts were formed by phospholipid-esterified isoketals, the functional consequence of isoketal adduction was examined using a model membrane protein (a cardiac K+ channel). These studies revealed that isoketal adduction profoundly altered protein function, inhibiting potassium current in a dose-dependent manner. These findings indicate that phospholipid-esterified isoketals rapidly adduct membrane proteins and that such modification can alter protein function, suggesting a generalized cellular mechanism for alteration of membrane function as a consequence of oxidative stress.

These findings indicate that phospholipid-esterified isoketals rapidly adduct membrane proteins and that such modification can alter protein function, suggesting a generalized cellular mechanism for alteration of membrane function as a consequence of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress from the generation of free radicals has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of human diseases including atherosclerosis, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Google Scholar, 2Gutteridge J.M.C. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 1819-1828Google Scholar, 3Butterfield D.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 495-506Google Scholar). Fatty acids esterified in membrane phospholipids are a major target of attack by free radicals (4Cerutti P.A. Science. 1985; 227: 375-381Google Scholar, 5Kagan V.E. Lipid Peroxidation in Biomembranes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1988Google Scholar, 6Dix T.A. Aikens J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 2-18Google Scholar). We have described previously the formation of a series of highly electrophilic γ-ketoaldehyde isomers in vitro, which we term isoketals (IsoKs) 1The abbreviations used are: IsoK, isoketal; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. (7Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts II., L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13139-13146Google Scholar), by rearrangement of endoperoxide intermediates in the isoprostane pathway of free radical-induced peroxidation of phospholipid-esterified arachidonic acid (8Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Google Scholar). Incorporation of oxygen at different sites of arachidonyl radical formation results in the formation of 8 structural isomers, each of which is composed of 4 racemic diastereoisomers (see Fig. 1A). Analogous molecules, termed neuroketals, are formed from the free radical-catalyzed oxidation of docosahexanoic acid and form protein adducts analogous to those described below for IsoKs (9Bernoud-Hubac N. Davies S.S. Boutaud O. Montine T.J. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30964-30970Google Scholar). IsoKs adduct covalently with the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues in vitro within seconds, which is orders of magnitude faster than has been reported for other products of lipid peroxidation, including 4-hydroxynonenal (7Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts II., L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13139-13146Google Scholar). This remarkable reactivity has precluded the detection of free IsoKs in vivo because of their sequestration as adducts. Therefore, we elucidated the nature of IsoK protein adducts in vitro as an initial step toward identifying the formation of IsoK adducts in vivo (7Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts II., L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13139-13146Google Scholar, 10Boutaud O. Brame C.J. Roberts II, L.J. Oates J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9389-9396Google Scholar). IsoKs initially form reversible Schiff base adducts which irreversibly cyclize to pyrroles. The pyrroles then undergo facile autoxidation to stable lactam and hydroxylactam adducts (see Fig. 1B) (7Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts II., L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13139-13146Google Scholar, 10Boutaud O. Brame C.J. Roberts II, L.J. Oates J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9389-9396Google Scholar). Consistent with this process, Schiff base adducts form rapidly and then undergo a rapid decline that is accompanied by an accumulation of lactam adducts (10Boutaud O. Brame C.J. Roberts II, L.J. Oates J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9389-9396Google Scholar). Accordingly, Schiff base adduct levels provide an indicator of early immediate adduction, whereas levels of lactam adducts provide an index of more chronic ongoing adduct formation. Here we report that in an animal model of oxidative injury, phospholipid-esterified IsoKs rapidly form Schiff base adducts, presumably with adjacent membrane proteins. The initial adducts are cleaved from the phospholipid backbone, resulting in IsoK adducts that are found to accumulate in plasma from normal humans and rats. Furthermore, IsoK adduction is found to alter the function of a model membrane protein, a cardiac K+ channel. Preparation and Analysis of Rat Liver Proteins—Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fasted overnight and then given carbon tetrachloride (1 ml/kg diluted 1:1 with corn oil) intragastrically. Four h later, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (65 mg/ml) and then exsanguinated. Livers were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Liver (1–2 g) was ground in ice-cold Folch solution (20 ml/g) containing 5 mg of butylated hydroxytoluene and 50 mg of triphenylphosphine/100 ml and incubated for 30 min at room temperature under argon. Proteins were then collected by vacuum filtration and washed with 100 ml each of Folch solution and ethanol (each containing butylated hydroxytoluene and triphenylphosphine). Proteins were suspended in 3 ml of methanol (5 mg of butylated hydroxytoluene/100 ml) and 3 ml of 0.4 n sodium hydroxide and hydrolyzed at room temperature under argon for 2 h. In samples in which Schiff base adducts were measured, proteins were reduced with 0.1 volume sodium borohydride (1 m in dimethylformamide for 30 min) before base treatment. Proteins were then reprecipitated and washed as above before resuspension at 2 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Labeled ([3H2,13C6]) IsoK lysyl lactam (14.48 ng) and reduced anhydro Schiff base adduct standards (47.80 ng) (synthesis, see below) were added, and the proteins were heated to 95 °C for 10 min. After cooling, Pronase (Calbiochem) was added (0.1 volume at 1 mg/ml), and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C under argon. The digest was then heated to 95 °C for 10 min. After cooling, aminopeptidase M (1 mg/ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C under argon. The digest was applied to Oasis cartridges (Waters Associates). Adducts were eluted with 10 ml of methanol and dried under N2. Adducts were purified by isocratic HPLC (45% methanol in 20 mm ammonium acetate with 0.1% acetic acid) on a 4.6- × 250-mm Macrosphere 300 C18 column (Alltech Association). One-ml fractions were collected, and fractions containing radioactivity were combined, re-extracted with Oasis cartridges, and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry as previously reported (7Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts II., L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13139-13146Google Scholar, 10Boutaud O. Brame C.J. Roberts II, L.J. Oates J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9389-9396Google Scholar). Standards were synthesized as follows. The IsoK enclosed in the box in Fig. 1 was obtained from a 15-R,S epimeric mixture of the methyl ester, O-tert-butyl-dimethylsilyl ether, an isopropylidine precursor (11Miller D.B. Raychaudhuri S.R. Avasthi K. Lal K. Levison B. Salomon R.G. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 3164-3175Google Scholar). The IsoK (1 μm) was incubated with [3H2,13C6]lysine (3.5 × 1014 dpm/mol) for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline. The mixture was then reduced (10Boutaud O. Brame C.J. Roberts II, L.J. Oates J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9389-9396Google Scholar) and extracted using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (7Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts II., L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13139-13146Google Scholar). The eluate was dried and subjected to HPLC using a 2.1- × 500-mm C8 column (MAC-MOD Analytical) at 0.5 ml/min. After 1 min, fractions were collected, and aliquots containing radioactivity were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry as previously reported (10Boutaud O. Brame C.J. Roberts II, L.J. Oates J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9389-9396Google Scholar). Preparation and Analysis of Serum Proteins—Plasma from normal rats and humans was delipidated in Folch solution containing butylated hydroxytoluene and triphenylphosphine at –20 °C (1 ml of plasma/20 ml). Proteins were precipitated and further treated as above. Electrophysiology—Electrophysiological recordings were performed at room temperature using an Axopatch-200A patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.) in the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. To record Ikr, Tyrode's solution was used as the extracellular solution. The intracellular pipette filling solution contained 145 mm K+. Pulses of a 1-s duration from a holding potential of –40 mV were used. Tail currents were measured as the difference between current recorded immediately after a –40-mV step and holding current. We addressed whether highly reactive IsoKs are formed in vivo in rats treated with CCl4, a well established model of oxidant injury to the liver that is associated with marked overproduction of isoprostanes (8Morrow J.D.

J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 2502-2507Google Scholar). Analysis of IsoK protein adducts involves quantification of IsoK-lysyl adducts following enzymatic digestion of proteins to individual amino acids. A unique aspect of isoprostane and, thus also, IsoK formation is that they are initially formed in situ esterified to phospholipids followed by phospholipase release (13Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Google Scholar). Because of their high reactivity, we considered that IsoKs might rapidly adduct to membrane proteins while still esterified to phospholipids, forming a heterotrimeric complex consisting of phospholipid-IsoK-protein. If this occurs, adducts would not be detected unless the complex is hydrolyzed to free the protein adduct from the phospholipid. Hence, IsoK protein adducts were analyzed in liver with and without base hydrolysis. Lysyl adducts of proteins were isolated, purified, and then quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using selected reaction monitoring of fragmentation of the MH+ ion to specific daughter ions for the lactam and reduced Schiff base adducts as described previously (7Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts II., L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13139-13146Google Scholar, 10Boutaud O. Brame C.J. Roberts II, L.J. Oates J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9389-9396Google Scholar). Representative selected reaction monitoring ion current chromatograms obtained from the analysis of IsoK lactam and Schiff base adducts in liver are shown in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. The chromatogram in Fig. 2A was obtained from analysis of liver from a control untreated rat, and the chromatogram in Fig. 2B was from the liver of a CCl4-treated rat. Schiff base adducts were not detected in normal rat liver (Fig. 2D). However, lactam adducts were detected at a level of 3.5 ± 0.2 ng/g of tissue (mean ± S.E.; n = 4), and none were esterified to phospholipids (Fig. 2C). This indicated that IsoK lactam adducts accumulate in the normal state because of ongoing lipid peroxidation, as has been found for isoprostanes (8Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Google Scholar, 12Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Kato T. Takahashi K. Badr K.F. Roberts II, L.J. Burk R.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 2502-2507Google Scholar, 13Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Google Scholar). A very different picture emerged in rats treated with CCl4. Four h following administration of CCl4, lactam adduct levels in the liver were 6.4 ± 0.3 ng/g (n = 4), representing an increase of 82% above the levels in normal livers (p = 0.0003). Again, phospholipid-esterified adducts were not observed (Fig. 2C). Although Schiff base adducts were undetectable in normal liver, abundant quantities were present in livers from rats treated with CCl4. In striking contrast to lactam adducts, >97% of Schiff base adducts were esterified to phospholipids. In the absence of treatment of proteins with base to release phospholipids, the level detected was 0.5 ± 0.1 ng/g of tissue (n = 4). When proteins were treated with base, the level detected increased dramatically by a mean of 42-fold to 21 ± 4 ng/g of tissue (n = 8) (Fig. 2D). This finding suggests that IsoKs esterified in phospholipids rapidly adduct as Schiff bases to adjacent proteins, presumably membrane-associated, and then convert to lactams and are hydrolyzed from the phospholipid backbone. This is consistent with our finding that phospholipid-esterified lactam adducts are substrates for snake and bee venom phospholipase A2 enzymes in vitro. 2C. J. Brame and L. J. Roberts II, unpublished observations. Because IsoK lactam protein adducts were detected in normal liver and were not sequestered as a complex with phospholipids, we hypothesized that they may also accumulate in the circulation. Therefore, we analyzed normal plasma for IsoK lactam adducts and found levels of 199 ± 78 pg/ml (n = 4) in rat plasma and levels of 561 ± 101 pg/ml (n = 5) in human plasma. This provides evidence that IsoK adducts are formed chronically in physiologically unperturbed rodents and humans. Because membrane-associated proteins are presumably the preferential target for adduction by IsoKs, we tested the functional consequence of adduction using a model integral membrane potassium channel that is relevant to oxidative ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced cardiac dysrhythmias (14Yang T. Wathen M.S. Felipe A. Tamkun M.M Snyders D.J. Roden D.M. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 870-878Google Scholar, 15Shattock M.J. Matsuura H. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 91-101Google Scholar). We tested the effect of a synthetic IsoK (box-enclosed compound Fig. 1A) on the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (Ikr) expressed in AT-1 cells, an atrial tumor myocyte cell line (14Yang T. Wathen M.S. Felipe A. Tamkun M.M Snyders D.J. Roden D.M. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 870-878Google Scholar, 15Shattock M.J. Matsuura H. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 91-101Google Scholar). Whole cell patch-clamp experiments following addition of the IsoK revealed a pronounced dose-dependent inhibition of Ikr (IC50 = 2.2 μm) (Fig. 3, A and C). This occurred despite the fact that addition of free IsoK does not mimic the formation of Schiff base protein adducts esterified to membrane phospholipids, which would be expected to have more disruptive effects on protein structure and function. Activating and deactivating currents were suppressed equally, suggesting that these effects were neither voltage- nor gating-dependent. Moreover, Ikr was not restored with washing, suggesting that the inhibition was not caused by a reversible allosteric effect but rather an irreversible covalent modification of channel proteins (Fig. 3B). The inhibition was not manifested immediately, requiring 60 min to achieve full inhibition when tested at a concentration of 10 μm IsoK. Because IsoKs adduct to proteins within seconds, the more prolonged time course for Ikr inhibition may be caused by time-dependent diffusion into the membrane and/or cross-linking of channel proteins. The latter possibility would be consistent with the observation that these compounds exhibit a remarkable proclivity to cross-link proteins after the initial adduct is formed (7Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts II., L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13139-13146Google Scholar). Oxidative stress has been found to induce alterations in the function of a number of membrane proteins including ion channels, enzymes, and receptors (16Gill J.S. McKenna W.J. Camm A.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 292: 337-340Google Scholar, 17Ueda K. Shinohara S. Yagami T. Asakura K. Kawasaki K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 265-271Google Scholar, 18Antione S. Lefevre T. Coraboeuf E. Nottin R.

Physiol. 1996; 271: H478-H489Google Scholar). Electrophilic short chain aldehydes produced by lipid peroxidation have been shown to be capable of producing some of these effects when added to cells (21Liu W. Akhand A.A. Kato M. Yokoyama I. Miyata T. Kurokawa K. Uchida K. Nakashima I. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2409-2417Google Scholar, 22Mark R.J. Lovell M.A. Markesbery W.R. Uchida K. Mattson M.P. J.

Pharmacol. 1995; 292: 233-240Google Scholar). However, IsoKs are more likely to mediate these effects for a number of reasons. First, the short chain aldehydes are scission products of oxidized fatty acids in phospholipids and thus are released from the fatty acid backbone as they are formed (27Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Google Scholar). Furthermore, these short chain aldehydes are orders of magnitude less reactive and are more hydrophilic than IsoKs, which would permit their diffusion from the membrane before adducting to proteins. Consistent with this hypothesis, these short chain aldehydes, unlike IsoKs, can be detected as free unadducted compounds in biological fluids and tissues (27Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Google Scholar). In summary, these findings provide evidence that IsoKs are formed in vivo and rapidly adduct to membrane proteins while still esterified to phospholipids. This novel protein modification by phospholipids provides new insights into potential underlying mechanisms by which oxidative stress can induce structural and functional modification of membrane proteins, ultimately causing cellular dysfunction."

However, the role of sphingolipids, another major component of lipid rafts, in APP processing remains undetermined. Here we report the effect of sphingolipid deficiency on APP processing in Chinese hamster ovary cells treated with a specific inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase, which catalyzes the first step of sphingolipid biosynthesis, and in a mutant LY-B strain defective in the LCB1 subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase. We found that in sphingolipid-deficient cells, the secretion of soluble APPα (sAPPα) and the generation of C-terminal fragment cleaved at α-site dramatically increased, whereas β-cleavage activity remained unchanged, and the ϵ-cleavage activity decreased without alteration of the total APP level. The secretion of amyloid β-protein 42 increased in sphingolipid-deficient cells, whereas that of amyloid β-protein 40 did not. All of these alterations were restored in sphingolipid-deficient cells by adding exogenous sphingosine and in LY-B cells by transfection with cLCB1. Sphingolipid deficiency increased MAPK/ERK activity and a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase, PD98059, restored sAPPα level, indicating that sphingolipid deficiency enhances sAPPα secretion via activation of MAPK/ERK pathway. These results suggest that not only the cellular level of cholesterol but also that of sphingolipids may be involved in the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease by modulating APP cleavage.

APP is metabolized via at least two post-translational pathways, one of which is a nonamyloidogenic pathway mediated by α-secretase proteolytically producing soluble APP (sAPPα), the dominant processing product; this cleavage generates the residual 10-kDa CTF (CTFα). Previous studies have shown that the activation of signal transduction pathways including protein kinase C (PKC) (1Buxbaum J.D. Oishi M. Chen H.I. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Jaffe E.A. Gandy S.E.

The other cleavage is mediated by β-secretase, generating several proteolytic C-terminal fragments (CTFs), namely, CTFβ and CTFϵ, and γ-secretase, producing either a 40-residue protein (Aβ40) or a 42-residue protein (Aβ42) from CTFβ. The cleavages at residues 40-42 are referred to as γ-cleavage, and the cleavage at residues 49-52 are referred to as ϵ-cleavage (6Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G.

In addition, several studies showed that sphingolipids modulate raft functions; the reduction in the cellular sphingolipid level renders glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins more sensitive to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (22Hanada K. Izawa K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol.

These studies indicate that the cellular levels of cholesterol and sphingolipids modulate the functions of lipid rafts. Therefore, the evidence that the cholesterol level in lipid rafts can modulate APP processing reasonably raises the question of whether cellular sphingolipids also modulate APP processing and Aβ generation. However, the participation of sphingolipids in APP processing remains undetermined.To address this issue, we examined the alterations in APP processing and Aβ generation in sphingolipid-deficient cells using ISP-1 (myriocin), a potent inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) (28Hanada K. Nishijima M. Fujita T. Kobayashi S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1211-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and a CHO-K1-cell-derived mutant cell line, the LY-B strain, which has a defect in the LCB1 subunit of SPT and is therefore incapable of de novo synthesis of any sphingolipid species (29Hanada K.

Our findings indicate that not only the cellular cholesterol level but also the sphingolipid level modulates APP processing.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies—The monoclonal antibody 22C11, which recognizes amino acids 66-81 of the N terminus of APP, was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecura, CA). The monoclonal antibodies used were BA27, which is specific for the Aβ1-40 terminal site; BC05, which is specific for the Aβ42 terminal site; and BNT77, which was raised against Aβ11-28 but recognizes Aβ11-16; all of these antibodies have been characterized previously (30Asami-Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kikuchi T. Kitada C. Suzuki N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody 6E10 (raised against Aβ1-17) was purchased from Senetek PLC (Maryland, MO). The rabbit polyclonal antibody, UT-18 (raised against APP695-(676-695)) was used to detect cellular APP and its C-terminal fragments (31Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antibody, G530, which was raised against rat Aβ1-16, was used to detect rodent sAPPα (32Oishi M. Nairn A.C. Czernik A.J. Lim G.S. Isohara T. Gandy S.E. Greengard P. Suzuki T. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 111-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognize phospho-independent PKCα, PKCδ, PKCϵ, and PKCγ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).Cell Culture—The CHO-K1 cell-derived mutant cell line, the LY-B strain, has been previously established (29Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). LY-B/cLCB1, a corrected revertant of the LY-B strain, was previously obtained by the stable transfection of LY-B cells with the cDNA encoding the hamster LCB1 subunit of SPT (29Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was used as the normal culture medium. CHO-K1 cells stably expressing APP751 (APP-CHO-K1) were used for determining APP processing and Aβ generation. To deplete sphingolipids, APP-CHO-K1 cells were treated with 1 μm myriosin (ISP-1; purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories). The Nutridoma-BO medium (Ham's F-12 medium containing 1% Nutridoma-SP (Roche Applied Science), 0.1% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 10 μm sodium oleate-bovine serum albumin complex) was used as the sphingolipid-deficient medium. For cultivation in sphingolipid-deficient medium, the cells were seeded, incubated in the normal culture medium at 37 °C for 1 day, and, after washing twice with serum-free Ham's F-12 medium, were cultured in the Nutridoma-BO medium for 2 days. In the experiment on the pharmacological inhibition of SPT in APP-CHO-K1 cells, the Nutridoma-BO medium was supplemented with 1 μm ISP-1, and the levels of sphingolipids were recovered with concurrent treatment with 1 μmd-erythro-sphingosine (Matreya, Inc., Pleasant Gap, PA) as described previously (28Hanada K. Nishijima M. Fujita T. Kobayashi S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1211-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).ELISA—Two-site ELISA for Aβ40 and Aβ42 was carried out as previously described (30Asami-Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kikuchi T.

BNT77 was coated as the capture antibody, whereas BA27 (for Aβ40) and BC05 (for Aβ42) were used as the detection antibodies following conjugation with horseradish peroxidase.Protein Preparation—Cultured cells grown in 10-cm2 dishes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then collected by scraper. The cells were then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the cell pellet was homogenized in Tris saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Complete), followed by homogenization using a motor-driven Teflon homogenizer. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in a TLX ultracentrifuge (Beckman). The supernatants were collected for biochemical analyses. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). Aliquots of the supernatant samples containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to 7.5% or 4-20% SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis as described previously (34Sawamura N. Gong J.S. Garver W.S.

The rate of lipid labeling was corrected for each protein concentration.Immunoblot Analysis—The proteins separated using SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% fat-free milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. The blots were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. For the detection of both primary monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used in conjunction with SuperSignal Chemiluminesence (Pierce) to obtain images that were saved on film. The primary antibodies used were as follows: monoclonal antibodies; 22C11, at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml; 6E10, at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml; polyclonal antibodies, G530, which recognizes rodent sAPPα, diluted at 1:1,000; and UT-18, which recognizes the C terminus of APP, diluted at 1: 500. The membrane fractions were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-PKCα, PKCδ, PKCϵ, and PKCγ antibodies diluted at 1:1000.Preparation of Membrane Fractions—APP C-terminal fragment generation was performed in cell-free systems as described previously (36Gu Y.

CHO-K1 cells were suspended in Buffer H (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (Complete), and thereafter the postnuclear supernatant was collected. The microsomal membrane was precipitated from the postnuclear supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and resuspended in Buffer H containing protease inhibitors and incubated 37 °C for 2 h to generate CTFϵ. The aliquots of the samples kept on ice for 2 h were used as negative controls. At the end of the assay, the microsomal membrane samples were separated into pellet and supernatant fractions by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Each pellet fraction was suspended in SDS sample buffer, and each supernatant fraction was diluted with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer to be used for immunoblot analysis.PKC Translocation Assay—The PKC translocation assay was carried out as described previously (37Piiper A. Elez R. You S.J. Kronenberger B. Loitsch S. Roche S. Zeuzem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7065-7072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). APP-CHO-K1 cells were incubated for 2 days in the Nutridoma-BO medium in the absence or presence of 1 μm ISP-1 or 1 μm ISP-1 plus 1 μm sphingosine for 48 and 73 h as indicated. Wild-type CHO, LY-B, and LY-B/cLCB1 cells were also incubated in Nutridoma-BO medium for 48 h. Thereafter, the cells were washed and scraped into 200 μl of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, protease inhibitors (Complete)), lysed by homogenizer, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellets were resonicated in 200 μl of homogenization buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, yielding solubilized particulate fractions. The protein concentration was determined, and the fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies, which recognize phosphorus-independent PKCα, PKCδ, PKCϵ, and PKCγ.Purification of the Lipid Raft Fraction—The lipid raft fraction was obtained from each cell line according to an established method previously reported (33Sawamura N. Morishima-Kawashima M. Waki H. Kobayashi K. Kuramochi T. Frosch M.P. Ding K. Ito M. Kim T.W. Tanzi R.E. Oyama F. Tabira T. Ando S. Ihara Y. J. Biol.

The extraction of lipids and subsequent determination of the amount of cholesterol and phospholipids in each sample were carried out according to previously described methods (39Michikawa M. Fan Q.W. Isobe I. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was carried out using StatView computer software (Macintosh, version 5.0; Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA). A p value < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.RESULTSSphingolipid Deficiency Induced by SPT Enhanced sAPPα Secretion in CHO-K1 Cell Lines—We used CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with human APP751 cDNA (APP-CHO-K1) (40Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and treated these cells with myriosin (designated as ISP-1), which is a potent inhibitor of SPT. Using this inhibitor, we obtained the pharmacological cell model of sphingolipid deficiency (28Hanada K. Nishijima M. Fujita T. Kobayashi S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1211-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We determined the level of sphingolipid synthesis in APP-CHO-K1 cells treated with ISP-1 in a sphingolipid-deficient medium. Fig. 1a shows that the rate of de novo sphingomyelin synthesis in ISP-1-treated APP-CHO-K1 cells decreased significantly as previously reported (28Hanada K. Nishijima M. Fujita T. Kobayashi S.

Using this culture system, we determined APP levels secreted from ISP-1-treated and nontreated APP-CHO-K1 cells and cellular APP levels in these cells. Immunoblot analysis using the 6E10 antibody, which recognizes the C terminus of human sAPPα, showed that the secreted sAPPα level in sphingolipid-deficient cells is significantly higher (about 3.1-fold) than that in nontreated cells (Fig. 1, b and c). These results indicate that α-cleavage is activated in CHO-K1 cells treated with ISP-1. The immunoblot analysis of cellular APP using the 22C11 antibody, which recognizes the N terminus of APP, and the UT-18 antibody, which recognizes the C terminus of APP, showed that treatment with ISP-1 does not seem to affect cellular total APP level but significantly reduces the levels of the mature forms (N- and O-glycosylated forms) of APP (Fig. 1, b and c). Treatment with ISP-1 does not affect the cellular α-tubulin level.Effect of Sphingolipid Deficiency on Generation of CTFα, CTFβ, and CTFϵ in CHO-K1 Cell Lines—Next, we determined the sAPPβ levels in the conditioned media of the SPT-treated and nontreated APP-CHO-K1 cells. We first immunoprecipitated sAPPα in the conditioned media of APP-CHO-K1 cells using the 6E10 antibody, and the remaining supernatant was used for sAPPβ detection. The immunoblot analysis of the remaining supernatant using the 22C11 antibody showed that ISP-1 treatment does not have any significant effect on sAPPβ levels (Fig. 2a). We next examined whether the level of C-terminal fragments of APP differ between ISP-1-treated and nontreated APP-CHO-K1 cells. We prepared microsomal fractions from each cell line and incubated them at 0 or 37 °C for 2 h. In APP-CHO-K1 cells, CTFα was mainly detected at 10 kDa, and CTFβ was weakly detected (Fig. 2b). When the cells were treated with ISP-1, the intensity of the band representing CTFα increased significantly at 4 °C (Fig. 2, b and c). Compatible with the data shown in Figs. 1b and 2a, these findings indicate that α-cleavage is activated in CHO-K1 cells treated with the SPT inhibitor. It was reported that the incubation of the microsomal fraction generates CTFϵ detected at ∼6.5 kDa, which migrates below the major APP C-terminal fragments arising from CTFα and CTFβ (6Weidemann A.

We also observed that CTFϵ was generated in the microsomal membranes of APP-CHO-K1 cells after a 2-h incubation (Fig. 2b). The level of CTFϵ generated in the membrane fraction of the ISP-1-treated APP-CHO-K1 cells decreased significantly compared with that of the nontreated cells (Fig. 2b), and the level of CTFϵ in the ISP-1-treated cells decreased to 40% of that of the nontreated cells (Fig. 2c). These results indicate that the extent of ϵ-cleavage decreases in CHO-K1 cells treated with the SPT inhibitor.Fig. 2Effect of sphingolipid deficiency on secretion of sAPPβand generation of CTFs in APP-CHO-K1 cells treated with ISP-1. APP-CHO-K1 cells were seeded in the 10% FBS-containing medium in 10-cm2 culture dishes. Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were refed with the Nutridoma-BO medium, treated with or without 1 μm ISP-1, and maintained for another 48 h. a, the culture media were harvested to detect sAPPα and sAPPβ as described under “Materials and Methods.” sAPPα in each culture medium was immunoprecipitated with the 6E10 antibody. The resultant supernatant was analyzed to detect sAPPβ by immunoblot analysis using the 22C11 antibody. b, the pellet and supernatant fractions from microsomal membrane were obtained by further ultracentrifugation as described under “Materials and Methods.” The generation of CTFα and CTFβ were detected by immunoblot analysis with the UT18 antibody at ∼10 kDa in the pellet fraction sample, and the generation of CTFϵ was detected with the UT18 antibody at ∼6 kDa in the samples of the supernatant fraction after 2 h of incubation. c, the intensities of the bands for CTFα at 4 °C (left panel) and CTFϵ at 37 °C (right panel) after 2 h incubation were determined using a Macintosh computer with software (National Institutes of Health Image) for densitometric analysis.

As shown in Fig. 3a, when exogenous sphingosine was concurrently treated with ISP-1, the sAPPα level decreased to that of the nontreated cells. Similarly, the CTFϵ level decreased in the ISP-1-treated cells, which was also restored by adding exogenous sphingosine (Fig. 3a). There was no difference in the cellular α-tubulin level between these cultures. We further determined the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the nontreated and ISP-1-treated cultures by two-site ELISA. ISP-1 treatment increased Aβ42 level (about 1.6-fold that of the nontreated cells), whereas it had no effect on the Aβ40 level (Fig. 3b). When exogenous sphingosine was concurrently treated with ISP-1, the Aβ42 level in the culture medium was restored to that of the nontreated cells (Fig. 3b).Fig. 3Cellular sphingolipid level modulated sAPPαsecretion, the cellular CTFϵlevel, and the secretion of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in APP-CHO-K1 cells.

https://openalex.org/W1990366850,"Previous work using soluble fibrin surrogates or very dilute fibrin indicate that inhibition of plasmin by antiplasmin is attenuated by fibrin surrogates; however, this phenomenon has not been quantified within intact fibrin clots. Therefore, a novel system was designed to measure plasmin inhibition by antiplasmin in real time within an intact clot during fibrinolysis. This was accomplished by including the plasmin substrate S2251 and a recombinant fluorescent derivative of plasminogen (S741C-fluorescein) into clots formed from purified components. Steady state plasmin levels were estimated from the rates of S2251 hydrolysis, the rates of plasminogen activation were estimated by fluorescence decrease over time, and residual antiplasmin was deduced from residual fluorescence. From these measurements, the second order rate constant could be inferred at any time during fibrinolysis. Immediately after clot formation, the rate constant for inhibition decreased 3-fold from 9.6 × 106m–1 s–1 measured in a soluble buffer system to 3.2 × 106m–1 s–1 in an intact fibrin clot. As the clot continued to lyse, the rate constant for inhibition continued to decrease by 38-fold at maximum. To determine whether this protection was the result of plasmin exposure of carboxyl-terminal lysine residues, clots were formed in the presence of activated thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa). In the presence of TAFIa, the initial protective effect associated with clot formation occurred; however, the secondary protective effect associated with lysine residue exposure was delayed in a TAFIa concentration-dependent manner. This latter effect represents another mechanism whereby TAFIa attenuates fibrinolysis.

This latter effect represents another mechanism whereby TAFIa attenuates fibrinolysis. As a fibrin clot forms in response to a vascular injury, it regulates its own degradation by serving as cofactor for plasminogen (Pgn) 1The abbreviations used are: Pgn, plasminogen; Pn, plasmin; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; AP, antiplasmin; TAFI, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor; TAFIa, activated TAFI; TAFI-T, TAFI variant with Thr-325; TAFI-I, TAFI variant with Ile-325; 5IAF-Pgn, fluorescein-labeled recombinant (S741C) Pgn; 5IAF-Pn, fluorescein-labeled recombinant (S741C) Pn; rform, rate of formation; rinh, rate of inhibition; dF, change in fluorescence; dt, change in time. activation to plasmin (Pn) (1Lucas M.A. Fretto L.J. McKee P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4249-45256Google Scholar). Once formed, Pn directly catalyzes clot breakdown by cleaving fibrin. In the process, carboxyl-terminal lysine residues are exposed that serve to enhance Pgn activation through a positive feedback mechanism for Pn formation (2de Vries C. Veerman H. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12604-12610Google Scholar). Once formed, Pn is quickly inhibited by the potent serine protease inhibitor antiplasmin (AP), which forms a tight nearly irreversible complex with Pn. Therefore, Pn levels and consequently the rate of fibrinolysis are determined by the balance between the kinetics of Pn formation and inhibition. Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a recently identified plasma zymogen (3Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Google Scholar, 4Tan A.K. Eaton D.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Google Scholar), free thrombin (3Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Google Scholar, 7Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Google Scholar), or plasmin (3Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Google Scholar, 8Mao S.S. Cooper C.M. Wood T. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35046-35052Google Scholar). In the context of a fibrin clot, TAFIa removes carboxyl-terminal lysine residues from Pn-modified fibrin (9Wang W. Boffa M.B. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Google Scholar). Although no naturally occurring inhibitors of TAFIa have been identified in human plasma, TAFIa is thermally unstable and this instability is probably how TAFIa is regulated once it is activated (10Boffa M.B. Bell R. Stevens W.K. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12868-12878Google Scholar, 11Marx P.F. Hackeng T.M. Dawson P.E. Griffin J.H. Meijers J.C.M. Bouma B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12410-12415Google Scholar). Previously, a naturally occurring polymorphism at amino acid position 325 (Thr/Ile) was identified that substantially affects the thermal stability of TAFIa (12Schneider M. Boffa M. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1021-1030Google Scholar). The more stable TAFI variant with Ile-325 (TAFI-I) had a half-life of 15 min at 37 °C, whereas the less stable TAFI variant with Thr-325 (TAFI-T) had a half-life of 8 min at 37 °C. When studied using an in vitro plasma clot lysis assay, this increased stability also corresponded to a more potent clot-stabilizing effect. TAFIa-T can prolong clot lysis time by 2.7-fold at saturation, whereas TAFIa-I can prolong clot lysis by 4-fold (12Schneider M. Boffa M. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1021-1030Google Scholar). Therefore, the carboxypeptidase B-like activity of TAFIa stabilizes fibrin clots and thermal stability is a potent regulator of this antifibrinolytic potential. Carboxyl-terminal lysine residues are important to the regulation of fibrinolysis because many key members of the fibrinolytic cascade, such as Pgn, Pn, and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), contain kringle domains that mediate binding to the fibrin surface through exposed lysine residues (1Lucas M.A. Fretto L.J. McKee P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4249-45256Google Scholar, 2de Vries C. Veerman H. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12604-12610Google Scholar, 13Ny T. Elgh F. Lund B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5355-5359Google Scholar, 14Hoylaerts M. Rijken R.C. Lignen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2912-2919Google Scholar). Previously, it was shown that TAFIa removal of these carboxyl-terminal lysine residues from fibrin removes the positive feedback for Pgn activation on a Pn modified fibrin surface (9Wang W. Boffa M.B. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Google Scholar). Thus, TAFIa modulates fibrinolysis, in part at least, by regulating Pn levels through attenuation of Pgn activation. Studies using soluble fibrin derivatives have demonstrated that when Pn is bound to fibrin, it is much less susceptible to inhibition by AP (15Wiman B. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 84: 573-578Google Scholar, 16Wiman B. Boman L. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 143-146Google Scholar, 17Wang H. Yu A. Wiman B. Pap S. Eur. J.

Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 502-508Google Scholar). Although Pn protection from AP is potentially an important mechanism for regulating Pn levels, previous work has been hampered by the gel-like nature of native fibrin. In this study, we have designed a novel system to study protection within an intact fibrin clot in real time. To do this, identical clots were formed in the presence of the chromogenic Pn substrate S2251 and in the presence of a fluorescent Pgn derivative in which the active site serine was mutated to cysteine and labeled with fluorescein (5IAF-Pgn) (20Horrevoets A.J.G. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 2183-2191Google Scholar, 21Horrevoets A.J.G. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2176-2182Google Scholar). One clot was monitored by fluorescence, which can be used to estimate the rate of Pn formation and the residual concentration of AP. The other clot was monitored by absorbance, which can be used to estimate the concentration of Pn at any time. By knowing the rate of Pn formation and the concentrations of Pn and AP, the second order rate constant for Pn inhibition by AP can be calculated during fibrinolysis. With this model, it was found that modification of fibrin by Pn dramatically increased the ability of fibrin to protect Pn from inhibition. This protective effect was further characterized by forming clots in the presence of TAFIa, and it was found that TAFIa could effectively attenuate protection in a manner that depends on the concentration and thermal stability of the TAFIa isoform used. Therefore, for the first time, Pn protection from AP was measured in an intact clot and the relative roles of intact fibrin, Pn-modified fibrin, or TAFIa treated fibrin were quantified. Materials—Human thrombin was prepared from plasma-derived prothrombin as described previously (22Bajzar L. Fredenburgh J.C. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16948-16954Google Scholar, 23Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5201-5212Google Scholar). Pgn was isolated from human plasma as described previously, some of which was used to prepare human Pn (23Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5201-5212Google Scholar). Baby hamster kidney cells and the pNUT expression vector were a kind gift from Dr. Ross MacGillivray (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Recombinant human antiplasmin was expressed in baby hamster kidney cells and isolated as described previously (3Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Google Scholar). The recombinant human Pgn (S741C) described by Horrevoets et al. (20Horrevoets A.J.G. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 2183-2191Google Scholar, 21Horrevoets A.J.G. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2176-2182Google Scholar) was active sitelabeled with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein to form the fluorescent catalytically inactive Pgn derivative, 5IAF-Pgn. Solulin, a soluble derivative of thrombomodulin, was a kind gift from Dr. Oliver Kops (Paion, GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Recombinant human tPA was a kind gift from Dr. Gordon Vehar (Genentech, Inc. South San Francisco, CA). d-Val-PheLys chloromethyl ketone and 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-d-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone were purchased from Calbiochem. Isolation of Fibrinogen from Human Plasma—Human fibrinogen was isolated from fresh frozen human plasma using the method described by Walker et al. (23Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5201-5212Google Scholar) with the following modification. Instead of a 2% polyethylene glycol 8000 cut subsequent to the β-alanine precipitation, a final concentration of 1.2% polyethylene glycol 8000 was used. After isolation, Fgn was dialyzed into 0.02 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, aliquoted, and stored at –70 °C until use. Recombinant TAFI Isolation and Activation—Two variants of wild-type human TAFI, the less stable TAFI-T variant (TAFI with a threonine at position 325) and the more stable TAFI-I variant (TAFI with an isoleucine at position 325), were expressed in baby hamster kidney cells using the pNUT expression vector as described previously (7Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Google Scholar, 24Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27176-27181Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was collected, and the TAFI variants were isolated using affinity column chromatography (12Schneider M. Boffa M. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1021-1030Google Scholar), aliquoted, and stored at –20 °C until use. To form TAFIa, 1 μm TAFI-T or TAFI-I was incubated with thrombin (25 nm), solulin (100 nm), and CaCl2 (5 mm) for 15 min at 25 °C. The mixture was then placed on ice until use to eliminate the spontaneous thermal inactivation of the enzyme. Determination of the Moment to Moment Second Order Rate Constant for Pn Inhibition during Fibrinolysis—In this study, a novel system was designed for monitoring the second order rate constant for Pn inhibition by AP (k2) within an intact fibrin clot during the course of clot lysis. To do this, identical 120-μl fibrin clots were formed from purified components in the wells of a clear 96-well plate and in the wells of an opaque 96-well Microfluor plate. In each case, clots were formed by adding thrombin (5 nm) and CaCl2 (5 mm) to fibrinogen (4 μm), AP (0.5 μm), Pgn (0.5 μm), 5IA-Pgn (0.5 μm), S2251 (400 μm), and tPA (2 nm). Clots formed in the clear plate were monitored by absorbance in a Spectramax Plus plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 405 and 650 nm simultaneously, and from these measurements, the moment to moment steady state Pn concentration in the clot can be inferred from the rate of S2251 hydrolysis during clot lysis. At the same time, clots formed in the opaque Microfluor plate were monitored by fluorescence of the recombinant 5IA-Pgn derivative using 490-nm excitation and 535-nm emission wavelengths with a 530 nm emission wavelength cutoff filter in a Spectramax Gemini XS plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Because 5IA-Pgn cleavage to 5IA-Pn by tPA resulted in a substantial loss of fluorescence (typically 45–50%), this derivative can be used to estimate the moment to moment rates of Pn formation and the residual AP concentration during fibrinolysis. Because of the large turbidity changes associated with clot formation and clot lysis, k2 was estimated only within the intact clot subsequent to complete clot formation and prior to the beginning of clot lysis. All of the reactions were covered to minimize evaporation and were incubated at 25 °C. Model—This model assumes a steady state Pn level within a fibrin clot over short time intervals. In the presence of Pgn, AP, and tPA, Pn is continually being formed on the fibrin and simultaneously consumed by AP. Therefore, the rate of change in the concentration of Pn at any time during clot lysis is a result of the difference between the rate of formation (rform) and the rate of inhibition (rinh) by AP, which is described by Equation 1. Pgn→rformPn+AP→rinhPn-AP(Eq. 1) Therefore, the rate of change in Pn concentration within a clot over time is as shown in Equation 2. dPndt=rform-rinh(Eq. 2) Because rinh depends on the concentrations of AP and Pn, the equation can be expressed as shown in Equation 3. dPndt=rform-k2×[Pn]×[AP](Eq. 3) In the steady state, the concentration of Pn within the clot is designated [Pn]ss and Equation 3 can be expressed as follows in Equation 4. 0≅rform-k2×[Pn]ss×[AP](Eq. 4) Finally, rearranging Equation 4 gives k2, the second order rate constant for Pn inhibition in terms of [Pn]ss, the rform, and residual AP concentration as shown in Equation 5. k2=rform[Pn]ss×[AP](Eq. 5) Because rform, [AP], and [Pn]ss can be measured during the course of fibrinolysis, k2 can be calculated in real time within an intact fibrin clot. Determination of the Steady State Concentration of Pn—The fibrin clot, monitored by absorbance, exhibited changes in the absorbance measured at 405 nm because of both S2251 hydrolysis and turbidity associated with changes in clot structure as it lysed. Therefore, to determine the change in absorbance due only to S2251 hydrolysis, the absorbance of the clot was measured at both 405 and 650 nm and the change in absorbance at 650 nm was used to decouple the rate of S2251 hydrolysis from the turbidity of the clot. Turbidity measured at 405 nm was empirically found to be 2.75 times greater than turbidity measured at 650 nm. To determine the corrected rate of change at 405 nm only due to substrate hydrolysis, the rate of change measured at 650 nm was multiplied by the 2.75 correction ratio and subtracted from the rate of change measured at 405 nm. To be able to correlate the rate of S2251 hydrolysis to the total Pn present within an unknown clot at any time, a standard curve was made by forming clots in the presence of known concentrations of Pn and in the absence of AP. To do this, a series of clots were formed in a clear microtiter plate by adding thrombin (5 nm) and CaCl2 (5 mm) to Fgn (4 μm), S2251 (400 μm), and increasing concentrations of purified human Pn (0–20 nm). The clots were monitored by absorbance at 405 and 650 nm, and the rates of S2251 hydrolysis were found by determining the slope of the change in absorbance versus change in time ratio at 405 nm over a 600-s interval subsequent to complete clot formation. The turbidity-corrected rate of change in absorbance was calculated as described and plotted against time. The slope of the relationship could then be used to derive the [Pn] from the rate of substrate hydrolysis at any time in a lysing fibrin clot. In the assay, Pn concentrations were calculated at 300-s time intervals. The [Pn] at each point was approximated by linear regression of all of the points from ±300 s from each point. The 600-s interval proved small enough that the regressed points were always nearly linear. By comparing the calculated slopes to the standard curve, the corrected rates of S2251 hydrolysis can be used to determine the [Pn] in a fibrin clot at any time. Equation 6 can then be used to estimate the [Pn]ss from the total [Pn] estimated from the standard curve where Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant for the interaction of Pn and S2251. [Pn]ss=1-[S2251]Km+[S2251]×[Pn](Eq. 6) The conditions of the assay have been chosen so that the change in substrate concentration was no more than 15% over the course of fibrinolysis, and the concentration of S2251 was assumed to be constant. Although the assay was performed in a system of purified components, thrombin was another serine protease present that could slowly hydrolyze S2251 and skew the results slightly, especially when there was little Pn present. Therefore, for each set of experiments, a control clot was formed by adding thrombin (5 nm) and CaCl2 (5 mm) to Fgn (4 μm) and S2251 (400 μm) in the absence of tPA to control the potential substrate hydrolysis by thrombin. Determination of the Rate of Pn Formation—The clot monitored by fluorescence showed a decrease associated with conversion of 5IAF-Pgn to 5IAF-Pn. In a fibrin clot, the rate of the change in fluorescence versus change in time (dF/dt) was measured every 300 s. The dF/dt at each point was approximated by linear regression of all of the points ±300 s from each point. The 600-s interval proved small enough that the regressed points were always nearly linear. The measured dF/dt can be used to calculate rform as follows where Fmax is the initial fluorescence and [5IAF-Pgn]0 is the initial 5IAF-Pgn concentration as shown in Equation 7. rform=dFdt×2×[5IA-Pgn]0Fmax(Eq. 7) Because Pgn and 5IA-Pgn are cleaved with similar kinetics, the rform can be used to estimate to the rate of Pn formation and the rate of 5IAF-Pn formation. Determination of the Residual Concentration of AP—The residual fluorescence can also be used to estimate the amount of AP present. Complete cleavage of the 5IAF-Pgn corresponds to complete activation of the Pgn to Pn. Once formed, the Pn is quickly inhibited by AP and most of the Pgn that has been activated will already have been inhibited. Therefore, the residual fluorescence can be measured at any time (Fmeasured) to approximate the amount of AP remaining as shown in Equation 8. [AP]=Fmeasured-(0.5)×Fmax0.5×Fmax×[AP]0(Eq. 8) The Effect of TAFIa on k2 within Intact Clots—Either TAFIa-T or TAFIa-I was activated as described and placed on ice until use. A series of fibrin clots were formed as described in the presence of increasing concentrations of TAFIa-T (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 nm) or TAFIa-I (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 nm). Identical clots were monitored in each case by absorbance and fluorescence, and the rform, [AP] and [Pn]ss values were measured within the intact clots at 300-s intervals as described. Using Equation 5, k2 values were calculated during the course of clot lysis. A limitation of the current study was the constraints placed on the concentrations of the reagents used; specifically, the concentrations of tPA and TAFIa that were added. By the nature of the system, there was very little Pn present during the initial part of the experiment, and in the presence of TAFIa, there was notably less. Therefore, measuring substrate hydrolysis at this stage was difficult unless an appreciable concentration of activator was used. However, although increased concentrations of tPA made the initial rates of Pn formation easy to measure reliably, Pgn was also consumed faster, resulting in slower rates near the end of the experiment. Therefore, the tPA concentration and TAFIa concentrations were decided upon by titrations that determined conditions that allowed reliable measurements of all of the variables during the entire course of the experiment both in the presence and absence of TAFIa. It was for this reason that only half of the concentration range of TAFIa-I compared with TAFIa-T was used in the experiment. Higher concentrations of either TAFIa variant (greater than 1 nm TAFIa-T and greater than 0.5 nm TAFIa-I) in the presence of the 2 nm tPA resulted in initial rates of substrate hydrolysis that were very small and difficult to measure reliably. The concentrations were chosen to allow both the progress of k2 within an intact clot to be measured and the effect of TAFIa to be measured over a concentration that is likely to be physiologically relevant (clot lysis assays show a half-maximal effect at approximately 1 nm TAFIa-T). To observe Pn inhibition by AP, clots were formed from purified components in the presence of the Pn substrate S2251 and the fluorescent catalytically inactive plasminogen derivative, 5IAF-Pgn. By monitoring identical clots by absorbance and fluorescence in tandem rform, [Pn]ss and the [AP] could be measured within an intact clot and, from this, k2 could be calculated in real time using Equation 5. An example of the raw data obtained by monitoring the change in absorbance of the clot at 405 and 650 nm is shown in Fig. 1 where Fig. 1A is the absorbance profile in the absence of TAFIa and Fig. 1B is the absorbance profile in the presence of TAFIa-T. In both cases, clot formation was associated with a large increase in turbidity that can be seen at both 405 and 650 nm. In the first 600 s, as the fibrin clot formed, it was difficult to consistently measure S2251 hydrolysis against the large background change in turbidity. Similarly, as the clot lysed, there was a pronounced decrease in turbidity, which is apparent in Fig. 1A, after approximately 14,000 s. Therefore, to reliably measure [Pn]ss, all of the inhibition studies were confined to the time interval subsequent to clot formation and prior to clot lysis. An example of the raw data obtained for clots monitored by fluorescence is shown in Fig. 2. As the fluorescent plasminogen derivative 5IAF-Pgn was cleaved to form the fluorescent Pn derivative 5IAF-Pn, there was a pronounced decrease in fluorescence that corresponded to the conversion. Comparing the profile of 5IAF-Pgn cleavage in the absence of TAFIa-T (Fig. 2A) to the profile obtained in the presence of TAFIa (Fig. 2B), it is clear that TAFIa alters the rate of Pgn cleavage by removing the positive feedback associated with Pn modification of the fibrin clot (9Wang W. Boffa M.B. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Google Scholar). From the fluorescence data, the rform and the residual [AP] can be estimated at any time as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protection of Pn from AP within an Intact Fibrin Clot—Using the raw absorbance data shown in Fig. 1 and the raw fluorescence data shown in Fig. 2, [Pn]ss, rform, and [AP] were determined during the course of clot lysis. These are shown in Fig. 3, A–C, respectively. The data from Fig. 3, A–C, were also used to calculate k2 in real time using Equation 5 as described. This is shown as Fig. 3D. In the absence of TAFIa, subsequent to clot formation, k2 was found to be 3.2 × 106m–1 s–1. The k2 obtained in the absence of fibrin was also measured in a soluble buffer system and was found to 9.6 × 106m–1 s–1 (data not shown), which is very similar to values measured for this interaction previously (15Wiman B. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 84: 573-578Google Scholar, 16Wiman B. Boman L. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 143-146Google Scholar, 17Wang H. Yu A. Wiman B. Pap S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2023-2039Google Scholar, 25Longstaff C. Gaffney P.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 979-986Google Scholar, 26Christensen U. Bangert K. Thorsen S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 58-62Google Scholar). Therefore, intact fibrin, prior to modification by Pn, mediated a 3-fold protective effect. As clot lysis progressed, k2 continued to decrease dramatically. At maximum, k2 diminished to 0.25 × 106m–1 s–1, corresponding to a 38-fold protective effect. Therefore, although intact fibrin mediates only a modest protective effect, Pn-modified fibrin is a potent protector of Pn, dramatically slowing the rate of inhibition. The progress of k2 in the presence of TAFIa-T is very different. Upon clot formation, the k2 is estimated to be 3 × 106m–1s–1, similar to clots formed in the absence of TAFIa; however, in the presence of TAFIa-T, the dramatic increase in the protective effect associated with Pn modification of the clot was delayed. Presumably, as Pn exposed carboxyl-terminal lysine residues, TAFIa-T removed them and the protective capacity of this TAFIa treated fibrin was similar to fibrin prior to Pn modification. Therefore, within an intact fibrin clot, TAFIa not only slowed the rate of Pn formation but also made the fibrin surface less able to protect Pn from AP. As expected, this attenuation of the protective properties of Pn-modified fibrin did not persist indefinitely. Even at 25 °C, TAFIa-T was thermally unstable and the enzyme had a half-life of 75 min. Eventually, the attenuation of protection was lost, and a point was reached where the concentration of active enzyme was not high enough to remove all of the lysine residues being exposed by Pn. At this point, k2 began to decrease and the protection of Pn by fibrin increased to a magnitude similar to the clots lysed in the absence of TAFIa. A comparison of Fig. 3, C and D, shows that as the TAFIa activity was lost, the steady state Pn levels began to increase in the clot, most probably corresponding to the increased cofactor activity of the fibrin surface and protection of Pn from inhibition. The Effect of TAFIa-T and TAFIa-I on Pn Protection by Fibrin—The thermal stability of TAFIa has been shown to modulate its antifibrinolytic effect when studied using in vitro clot lysis models (3Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Google Scholar, 12Schneider M. Boffa M. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1021-1030Google Scholar, 14Hoylaerts M. Rijken R.C. Lignen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2912-2919Google Scholar). Therefore, with respect to altering the protective properties of Pn modified fibrin, the ability of TAFIa should depend on both the concentration and the thermal stability of the TAFIa variant used. To study this effect, a series of experiments were performed with increasing concentrations of the less stable TAFIa-T variant that had a half-life of 75 min at 25 °C and the more stable TAFIa-I variant that had a half-life of 147 min at 25 °C (12Schneider M. Boffa M. Stewart R. Rahman M. Koschinsky M. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1021-1030Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the dramatic effect that TAFIa had on suppressing the [Pn]ss within fibrin clots. It is interesting to note that although parts A and B of Fig. 4 appear similar, there is only half as much of the more stable TAFIa-I variant used to mediate nearly the same effect as the less stable TAFIa-T variant. Therefore, TAFIa suppressed Pn formation in fibrin clots in a manner that depended on the overall activity of the TAFIa added. More TAFIa or TAFIa with a prolonged half-life was more able to suppress [Pn]ss. Data from the same experiments were also used to compare the effects of the less stable TAFIa-T variant (Fig. 5A) and the more stable TAFIa-I variant (Fig. 5B) on the k2 during clot lysis. In each case, subsequent to clot formation, the k2 decreased roughly 3-fold (2.5–3.5 × 106m–1 s–1), and in each case, the protection eventually increased 30–40-fold at maximum. However, the time scale of this decrease depended on the concentration of TAFIa added and the thermal stability of the variant used. For example, 0.2 nm TAFIa-T attenuated the increase in protection only modestly, whereas 0.2 nm TAFIa-I attenuated the protection much more efficiently. Nearly, the same effect on protection was observed in Fig. 5, compare A with B, even though we have used only half of the concentrations of the more stable TAFIa-I variant. To highlight this TAFIa concentration dependence, the time to the half-maximal protective effect was plotted against the TAFIa concentrations in Fig. 6.Fig. 6Concentration dependence of the TAFIa-mediated alteration of k2. The ability of TAFIa-T (closed circles) or TAFIa-I (open circles) to attenuate the decrease in k2 was estimated from the plots shown in Fig. 5. The time to half-maximal protection was estimated graphically and plotted against TAFIa concentration for each variant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In this study, an intact fibrin clot model was designed to study Pn protection from inhibition by AP. Subsequent to fibrin clot formation, k2 decreased 3-fold from 9.6 × 106m–1 s–1 to 3 × 106m–1 s–1. As clot lysis continued, k2 eventually decreased by 38-fold overall to 0.25 × 106m–1 s–1. To demonstrate that this increase in protection was attributed to Pn exposure of carboxyl-terminal lysine residues, experiments were also performed in the presence of TAFIa. It was found that TAFIa can attenuate protection in a lysing fibrin clot, and this attenuation depends on the concentration and thermal stability of the TAFIa variant added. In the presence of TAFIa, k2 decreased 3-fold, similar to clots lysed in the absence of TAFIa; however, TAFIa then attenuated the progressive decrease in the k2, maintaining the protective properties of the clot at those of intact unmodified fibrin. This attenuation of protection was not absolute, and eventually, protection increased after a delay that depended on the concentration of TAFIa added. Because TAFIa was thermally unstable, activity of the enzyme will be lost over time and, eventually, there will not be enough TAFIa activity present to remove the lysine residues as they are exposed. In corroboration of this finding, a comparison of assays done with the more stable TAFIa-I variant compared with the less stable TAFIa-T variant shows that TAFIa-I has an enhanced ability to attenuate protection. Under the conditions used in the assay, the maximum protection was found to be 38-fold, which is in close agreement with previous work that has found that soluble fibrin surrogates can protect Pn by 10–45-fold (15Wiman B. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 84: 573-578Google Scholar, 16Wiman B. Boman L. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 143-146Google Scholar, 17Wang H. Yu A. Wiman B. Pap S. Eur. J.

Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 502-508Google Scholar). A model using immobilized fibrin was also used to study protection; however, with this model, the protection was found to be 398-fold (27Kolev K. Lerant I. Tenekejiev K. Machovich R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17030-17034Google Scholar), which is 10 times more potent than the effect measured with the intact clot model. Until now, studies on the protection of Pn from AP have been essentially end point studies on a single fibrin state. An advantage of this work is that the end result of the dynamic balance of Pn formation and inhibition and how this changes during the course of fibrin modification and breakdown can be observed. By measuring the k2 in real time, the dramatic role that carboxyl-terminal lysine residue exposure has on protecting Pn becomes apparent. Under the conditions used in this assay, the modified fibrin surface is 10 times better at protecting Pn than the unmodified surface. Moreover, by including TAFIa, the effect of lysine residue exposure can be countered. Previous work has demonstrated that AP has a critical carboxyl-terminal lysine residue that can be removed by carboxypeptidase B and is therefore a potential target for TAFIa. The original work on this phenomenon used peptides corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the AP (28Hortin G.L. Gibson B.L. Fok K.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 591-596Google Scholar); however, more recent work with recombinant AP variants that have the carboxyl-terminal lysine mutated still retains much of the ability of the AP to inhibit Pn (17Wang H. Yu A. Wiman B. Pap S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2023-2039Google Scholar). If TAFIa removal of lysine from the carboxyl terminus of AP were affecting the inhibitory potential of AP in this system, increased concentrations of TAFIa would correspondingly decrease k2; however, the opposite effect was observed within the intact clots studied here. TAFIa maintained the system in a decreased protective state, and the greater the concentration of TAFIa added, the longer this decreased protection can be maintained. In the context of this study, either TAFIa was not included at high enough concentrations to appreciably modify the large AP pool or, alternatively, TAFIa may have had little or no activity toward AP. In either case, this potential side reaction was not observed. Therefore, this work provides some functional corroboration to the idea that TAFIa has little effect on the inhibitory capacity of AP, which makes sense when the antifibrinolytic role of TAFIa is considered. For the first time, the protection of Pn from AP within an intact fibrin clot has been characterized and how this dramatically alters steady state Pn levels within a clot has been demonstrated. This work shows that while intact fibrin is able to modestly protect Pn, modification of fibrin by Pn serves as a potent protective surface, further emphasizing the importance of this feedback mechanism to fibrinolysis. In addition, these studies have demonstrated that increased protection associated with the exposure of the lysine residues is reversible and a novel means by which TAFIa could modulate clot stability has been identified."

It has been proposed that this peroxin may: (i) act as a cycling PMP receptor protein, (ii) facilitate the insertion of newly synthesized PMPs into the peroxisomal membrane, or (iii) function as a chaperone to associate and/or dissociate complexes comprising integral PMPs already in the peroxisomal membrane. We previously demonstrated that human Pex19p binds peroxisomal integral membrane proteins at regions distinct from their sorting sequences. Here we demonstrate that a mutant of Pex13p that fails to bind to Pex19p nevertheless targets to and integrates into the peroxisomal membrane. In addition, through in vitro biochemical analysis, we show that Pex19p competes with Pex5p and Pex13p for binding to Pex14p, supporting a role for this peroxin in regulating assembly/disassembly of membrane-associated protein complexes. To further examine the molecular mechanism underlying this competition, six evolutionarily conserved amino acids in the Pex5p/Pex13p/Pex19p binding domain of Pex14p were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis and the corresponding mutants functionally analyzed. Our results indicate that the physically overlapping binding sites of Pex14p for Pex5p, Pex13p, and Pex19p are functionally distinct, suggesting that competition occurs through induction of structural changes, rather than through direct competition. Importantly, we also found that amino acid substitutions resulting in a strongly reduced binding affinity for Pex13p affect the peroxisomal localization of Pex14p.

Despite the fact that substantial progress has been made in peroxin identification, the function of most of these proteins in the biogenesis process is still only partially understood. Significant interest has developed in recent years regarding the essentially open question of how PMPs find their way to the organelle (3Sparkes I.A. Baker A. Mol. Membr.

These results argue against a role of Pex19p as a general cycling PMP receptor protein. Besides being connected with a transport function, Pex19p might function directly (i) in maintaining the solubility of integral PMPs before insertion into the peroxisome membrane (9Jones J.M.

In this study, we employed a Pex13p protein displaying no detectable affinity for Pex19p but still possessing peroxisomal targeting information to demonstrate that Pex19p is not directly implicated in the membrane insertion process of this PMP. In addition, we provide evidence that Pex19p can alter the binding properties of the Pex14p docking complex, supporting a role for this peroxin in regulating assembly/disassembly of membrane-associated protein complexes.

After transfer to coverslips, the cells were transiently transfected by the polyethylenimine transfection method (22Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P.

The peroxisomal localization of the GFP (direct fluorescence) and protein A (indirect fluorescence) fusion proteins were confirmed by co-localization studies with the peroxisome-targeted DsRed-KSKL reporter protein (10Fransen M.

Fluorescence was observed under a Leica DMR microscope equipped with FITC/RSGFP/Bodipy/Fluo3/DIO and Texas Red filters. To isolate a membranous fraction containing only integral membrane proteins, transfected cells, grown in culture dishes to 90% confluency, were freed from these dishes by scraping, resuspended in 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.5), homogenized (20 strokes) with a Teflon-glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (Kontes), and subjected to a 100,000 × g spin for 1 h. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.5) and the entire procedure was repeated. This procedure resulted in a combined supernatant fraction yielding soluble and peripheral membrane proteins, and a pellet fraction containing the integral membrane proteins (24Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). To isolate integral membrane proteins of a purified peroxisomal fraction, the freed cells were resuspended in homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.2), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1%(v/v) ethanol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and homogenized (20 strokes) using a stainless steel tissue grinder (Kontes). A postnuclear supernatant resulting from a low speed centrifugation (500 × g, 10 min) was further separated by density gradient centrifugation using a Nycodenz step gradient (25Verheyden K. Fransen M. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The obtained fractions were analyzed by Western blotting and the peroxisomal peak fractions were pooled, 10-fold diluted in 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.5), and processed as described above. Antibodies—The production and characterization of the rabbit antisera against His6-Pex13p/SH3, His6-Pex14p, His6-Pex19p, and peroxisomal matrix proteins is described elsewhere (10Fransen M. Wylin T.

Sakai, Kyoto, Japan) were generated as previously described (10Fransen M. Wylin T. Brees C. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4413-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The rabbit antisera against Pex5p and PMP70 and the mouse monoclonal anti-TY antibody were kindly provided by Dr. M. Baes (Leuven, Belgium), Dr. S. Subramani (San Diego, CA) and Dr. K. Gull (Manchester, United Kingdom), respectively. The mouse monoclonal anti-His6 antibody was purchased from Clontech. The rabbit antibodies raised against catalase (Rockland), cytochrome P450 4A (Affinity Bioreagents Inc.), glutamate dehydrogenase (Rockland), human serum albumin (Sigma), and protein A (Sigma) were also commercially obtained. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgGs were obtained from Sigma. Expression of Recombinant Proteins and Preparation of Bacterial Lysates—Top10F′ cells transformed with plasmids encoding the appropriate GST-, biotin-, or His6-tagged fusion proteins were cultured overnight. 5 ml of each culture of E. coli was diluted in 50 ml of yeast extract-tryptone medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. After culture for 1 h at 37 °C, the cells were further grown for 3 h at 33 °C in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (or 2% (w/v) arabinose) to induce the expression of the tagged proteins. The cells were harvested and resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold binding buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml α2-macroglobulin, and 1 μg/ml chymostatin). Lysates were prepared by sonicating the cells with a Branson Sonifier B15 P cell disrupter, equipped with a microtip (output 5, duty 50%, 10 times 15 s). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 15 min, 4 °C). In Vitro Binding Assays—The pull-down assays employed to study the interactions between bacterially expressed peroxins were basically performed as described by Fujiki and coworkers (26Otera H. Setoguchi K. Hamasaki M. Kumashiro T. Shimizu N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1639-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, in a first step glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) or Immuno-Pure immobilized streptavidin (Pierce) beads were coated with the appropriate fusion proteins. Therefore, 30–500 μl of the bacterial lysates was mixed with 500 μl of a 50% slurry of the beads. After being rotated for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed five times with ice-cold binding buffer, resuspended in 500 μl of this buffer, and divided into 50-μl aliquots. In a next step, aliquots of the coated beads were incubated, by rotation for 1 h at 4 °C, with various bacterial lysates. The beads were washed five times with the ice-cold binding buffer, and five times with the same buffer minus glycerol. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min in 200 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and, after removing the beads, 20-μl fractions were loaded on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. To study the interaction between protein A, Pex13p(WT)-protein A, Pex13p(V178E)-protein A, and Pex19p-GFP, CHO cells co-transfected with plasmids coding for the corresponding fusion proteins (three tissue culture dishes (150 mm × 20 mm) per condition) were freed from the dishes by scraping, lysed in 1600 μl of ice-cold binding buffer, and homogenized by using a stainless steel tissue grinder (20 strokes). After centrifugation (13,000 × g, 15 min), the supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of rabbit IgG-beads (Sigma) and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed and further processed as described for the bacterially expressed proteins. A Pex13p Mutant That Fails to Bind to Pex19p Nevertheless Targets to and Integrates into the Peroxisomal Membrane—It has been postulated that Pex19p may be involved in the insertion process of PMPs into the peroxisomal membrane (6Sacksteder K.A. Jones J.M. South S.T. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated whether or not Pex13p(V178E), a mutant of Pex13p displaying a peroxisomal distribution pattern but no detectable affinity for Pex19p in the yeast two-hybrid system (10Fransen M. Wylin T. Brees C. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4413-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), still achieves stable insertion into the peroxisomal membrane. To accomplish this, first, we confirmed the peroxisomal localization of the employed Pex13p-TY-GFP and Pex13p-protein A fusion proteins in CHO cells by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1). As we could not exclude that Pex19p and Pex13p(V178E) do not interact in mammalian cells, we incubated rabbit IgG-agarose with cell lysates derived from CHO-cells co-transfected with plasmids coding for GFP-Pex19p and protein A, Pex13p(WT)-protein A or Pex13p(V178E)-protein A. Analysis of the bound proteins revealed that GFP-Pex19p was retained on the beads in the presence of Pex13p(WT)-protein A, but not in the presence of Pex13p(V178E)-protein A (Fig. 2). These observations, which extend our previous findings obtained with the yeast two-hybrid system (10Fransen M. Wylin T. Brees C. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4413-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggest that Pex19p does also not form a complex with Pex13p(V178E) in mammalian cells. Next, we lysed cells transfected with plasmids encoding GFP, Pex13p(WT)-TY-GFP, and Pex13p(V178E)-TY-GFP in 0.1 m sodium carbonate - a treatment that releases soluble and peripheral membrane proteins (24Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar), and immunoblotted the soluble and insoluble fractions with the anti-TY1 epitope tag monoclonal antibody BB2 (27Bastin P. Bagherzadeh Z. Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the wild-type and mutated Pex13p-TY-GFP fusion proteins were carbonate-inextractable; that is, were very tightly associated with the organelle membrane (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained with extraction by Triton X-114 (data not shown). In another experiment fractions enriched for peroxisomes were employed for carbonate treatment (Fig. 4). These fractions were obtained by density gradient centrifugation of the postnuclear supernatant of cells transfected with Pex13p(WT)-protein A or Pex13p(V178E)-protein A (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, also under these conditions the Pex13p(WT) and Pex13p(V178E) fusion proteins were carbonate-inextractable. Combined with our controls showing that soluble peroxisomal matrix proteins, but not peroxisomal integral membrane proteins, can be completely separated from the membrane fraction (Figs. 3B and 4B), these results indicate that Pex19p is not directly involved in the insertion process of Pex13p into the peroxisomal lipid bilayer.Fig. 2Pex19p displays a different affinity for Pex13p(WT) and Pex13p(V178E) in mammalian cells. CHO cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-Pex19p and protein A, Pex13p(WT)-protein A or Pex13p(V178E)-protein A. After 24 h, the cells were processed for (in)direct fluorescence microscopy (A) or the IgG-agarose pull-down assay (B) (see “Experimental Procedures”). After thorough washing, the proteins bound to the IgG-agarose beads were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized using rabbit antibodies specific for protein A and GFP. The heavy chains of the rabbit IgGs released from the agarose beads are marked with an asterisk.

An anti-tumor polysaccharide has been isolated from the boiling water extract of the Tice substrain of BCG and tentatively characterized as consisting primarily of repeating units of 6-linked-glucosyl residues. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacterial species produce a glycogen-like α-glucan composed of repeating units of 4-linked glucosyl residues substituted at some 6 positions by short oligoglucosyl units that also exhibits an anti-tumor activity. Therefore, the impression prevails that mycobacteria synthesize different types of anti-neoplastic glucans or, alternatively, the BCG substrains are singular in producing a unique type of glucan that may confer to them their immunotherapeutic property. The present study addresses this question through the comparative analysis of α-glucans purified from the extracellular materials and boiling water extracts of three vaccine substrains. The polysaccharides were purified, and their structural features were established by mono- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of the enzymatic and chemical degradation products of the purified compounds. The glucans isolated by the two methods from the three substrains of BCG were shown to exhibit identical structural features shared with the glycogen-like α-glucan of M. tuberculosis and other mycobacteria. Incidentally, we observed an occasional release of dextrans from Sephadex columns that may explain the reported occurrence of 6-substituted α-glucans in mycobacteria.

Tuberculosis, an infectious disease that has plagued man over the last several centuries, remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with 2–3 million people dying of the disease annually. It is estimated that almost 2 billion people, one-third of the world's population, are or have been infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. To date the only effective vaccine strain against the disease is the so-called Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). 1The abbreviations used are: BCG, Bacille Calmette-Guérin; APTS, 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid; BWG, boiling-water glucan; CFG, culture filtrate glucan; COSY, homonuclear (1H-1H) COSY; DEPT, distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer; GC, gas chromatography; HMQC, heteronuclear (1H-13C) multiple quantum correlation; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; RD, Region of deletion; TOCSY, two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy.

Science. 1999; 284: 1520-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). BCG has also shown efficacy against tumors, notably as an immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of superficial bladder cancer, the fourth most common cancer among men (6Nseyo U.O. Lamm D.L. Semin. Surg. Oncol. 1997; 13: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because the use of the whole BCG is sometimes associated with significant morbidity, the search for immunologically active BCG subcomponents is an attractive alternative. With the underlying idea of identifying defined components responsible for the anti-neoplastic properties of the BCG vaccine, an α-glucan with the expected activity was isolated from a boiling water extract of the Tice substrain of M. bovis BCG (7Wang R. Klegerman M.E. Marsden I. Sinnott M. Groves M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The polysaccharide exhibited a molecular mass estimated between 65 and 87 kDa by gel filtration and consisted primarily of repeating units of →6-α-d-glucosyl residues; it also contained a few →4-α-d-glucosyl residues substituted at position 6 with a monoglucosyl residues (Fig. 1A). In other mycobacterial species, however, no such polysaccharide has been described to date. Rather, an α-d-glucan, a d-arabino-d-mannan, and a d-mannan were isolated from culture filtrates of surface-exposed materials of M. tuberculosis and some other pathogenic mycobacterial species (8Lemassu A.

Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Structural studies demonstrate that these α-glucans are glycogen-like polysaccharides (Fig. 1B), with an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa, and are composed of repeating units of 5–6 →4-α-d-glucosyl residues substituted at position 6 with short oligoglucosyl residues (9Lemassu A. Daffé M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Ortalo-Magné A. Dupont M.-A. Lemassu A. Andersen A.B. Gounon P. Daffé M. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These polysaccharides are also produced by tubercle bacilli inside macrophages (11Schwebach J.R. Glatman-Freedman A. Gunther-Cummins L. Dai Z. Robbins J.B. Schneerson R. Casadevall A. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2566-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and are involved in the nonopsonic binding of M. tuberculosis to mammalian cells through the complement receptor 3 (12Cywes C. Hoppe H.C. Daffé M. Ehlers M.R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4258-4266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, polysaccharides with similar chromatographic behavior were purified from the Pasteur substrain of BCG and were shown to exhibit an anti-tumor activity against superficial bladder cancer (13Zlotta A.R. Van Vooren J.-P. Denis O. Drowart A. Daffé M. Lefevre P. Schandene L. De Cock M. De Bruyn J. Vandenbussche P. Jurion F. Palfliet K. Simon J. Schulman C.C. Content J. Huygen K. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 844-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Finally, glycogen-like α-glucans have been characterized from the cell wall preparations of an unspecified substrain of M. bovis BCG (14Misaki A. Yukawa S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1966; 59: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Consequently, the impression prevails that mycobacteria or at least M. bovis BCG contain two types of glucans with different cell locations and/or extractabilities, (i) glycogen-like α-glucans loosely attached to the bacterium and partly released in the culture fluid (9Lemassu A. Daffé M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Ortalo-Magné A. Dupont M.-A. Lemassu A. Andersen A.B. Gounon P. Daffé M. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and (ii) →6-α-d-glucans present in deeper compartments of the cell envelope and extractable only with boiling water (7Wang R. Klegerman M.E. Marsden I. Sinnott M. Groves M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) but not with mild mechanical extraction (10Ortalo-Magné A. Dupont M.-A.

Marchal G. Daffé M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the latter polysaccharides may typify the BCG substrains, thereby explaining their greater ability to protect against both tuberculosis and cancer than other mycobacterial strains. The present study was undertaken to address this question. For this purpose, the α-glucans from the culture filtrates (CFG) and boiling water extracts (BWG) of three substrains of M. bovis BCG were purified and comparatively analyzed by mono-and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), and conventional chemical techniques. Strains and Growth Conditions—The Tice, Pasteur, and Connaught substrains of M. bovis BCG examined in this study were grown on the synthetic Sauton's medium (16Sauton B. C. R. Acad. Sci. Ser. III Life Sci. 1912; 155: 860-863Google Scholar) (100 ml/flask) either as surface pellicles or on an orbital shaker at 37 °C. Primers and RT-PCR Analysis—Chromosomal DNA was extracted from BCG Connaught, Pasteur, and Tice substrains as previously described by Torrea et al. (17Torrea G. Levée G. Grimont P. Martin C. Chanteau S. Gicquel B. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 10 ml of log phase cultures of M. bovis BCG were centrifuged, and the bacterial cells were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis solution containing sucrose (25% w/v), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm EDTA, and 500 μg of lysozyme/ml. The suspension was incubated overnight at 37 °C, and 500 μl of proteinase K (400 μg/ml in 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 1% SDS) were added. After a 4-h incubation at 55 °C, 200 μl of 5 m NaCl were added, and DNA was extracted with phenol and chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Pellets were then resuspended in water and stored at -20 °C before use. PCR were performed in a final 50-μl volume and contained per reaction 10–50 ng of DNA template, 100 nm concentrations of each primer, 4 μl of nucleotide mix (10 mm), 5 μl of buffer 10× (AmpliTaq Gold buffer, Applied Biosystems), 4 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 5 μl of Me2SO, and 0.25 units of Taq polymerase (AmpliTaq Gold Applied Biosystems). An initial denaturation step of 1 min at 95 °C was followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 58 °C, 1 min at 72 °C and terminated by 1 elongation step of 10 min at 72 °C.

High molecular weight carbohydrates and proteins were precipitated overnight at 4 °C with 6 volumes of cold ethanol. The precipitates were collected after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1 h, dissolved in distilled water, dialyzed for 1 day against water to eliminate traces of salts, lyophilized, and weighed. The polymers were dissolved in distilled water, and the α-glucans were purified as previously described (9Lemassu A. Daffé M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). BCG cells were suspended in 100 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged twice at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The washed cells were extracted in a boiling water flask by refluxing with 100 ml of distilled water for 2 h as described (7Wang R. Klegerman M.E. Marsden I. Sinnott M. Groves M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The extracts were filtered through a sterile Nalgene 0.22-μm filter (Nalge, NY). The filtrates were concentrated by rotary evaporation under vacuum, and the concentrated filtrates were precipitated overnight at 4 °C with 6 volumes of cold ethanol. The precipitates were collected after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1 h, dissolved in distilled water, and dialyzed overnight against 5 liters of distilled water, lyophilized, and weighed. Purification and Chemical Characterization of Glucans—The ethanol precipitates originated from the culture filtrates, and the boiling water extracts were separately chromatographed first on a column (55 × 1.8 cm) of DEAE-Trisacryl (IBF, Villeneuve-La-Garenne, France) gel, and the neutral fractions were re-chromatographed either on a Bio-Gel P-100 (Bio-Rad) or a Sephadex G-200 (Amersham Biosciences) column (90 × 1.8 cm) using 0.5% acetic acid or 0.1 m NaCl in 1% acetic acid as eluent. The elution profiles of the gel filtration chromatography were monitored by refractive index detection, and the collected fractions were assessed for their carbohydrate content (18Dische Z. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1962; 1: 488-494Google Scholar). Samples of purified polysaccharides were O-methylated (19Finne J. Krusius T. Rauvala H. Carbohydr. Res. 1980; 80: 336-339Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar); portions of the per-O-methylated products were hydrolyzed with 2 m CF3COOH at 110 °C for 2 h, reduced with NaBH4, and acetylated. The different partially O-methylated and partially O-acetylated glucitols were identified by gas chromatography (GC) and GC-MS. Lipid Analysis—Wet cells were first extracted with chloroform-methanol (1:2, v/v) then five times with chloroform-methanol (1:1, v/v) and finally once with chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v). These extracts were pooled, dried under vacuum, and partitioned between water and chloroform (1:1, v/v); the organic phase was extensively washed with distilled water, evaporated to dryness to yield the crude lipid extract, and weighed. The washed lipid extract was redissolved in chloroform and analyzed by TLC on silica gel Durasil 25-precoated plates (0.25 mm thickness; Macheray-Nagel). Lipid spots were resolved by TLC run in the solvent mixtures petroleum ether-diethyl ether (9:1, v/v) for analyzing phthiocerol dimycocerosates and triacylglycerol (15Ortalo-Magné A. Lemassu A.

Sugar-containing compounds were visualized by spraying the plates with 0.2% anthrone in concentrated sulfuric acid followed by heating at 110 °C. The Dittmer-Lester reagent was used to detect phosphorus-containing substances. The ninhydrin reagent was used to reveal the presence of free amino groups; a spray with 10% molybdophosphoric acid in ethanol solution followed by heating at 110 °C was used to detect all of the lipid spots. Mycolates were obtained by saponification of delipidated cells with 5% KOH in methanol/benzene (8:2, v/v) for 16 h at 80 °C (21Daffé M. Lanéelle M.A. Asselineau C. Lévy-Frébault V. David H.L. Ann. Microbiol. (Inst. Pasteur). 1983; 134: 241-256Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar); after acidification with sulfuric acid, fatty acids were extracted with diethyl ether, extensively washed with water, and then methylated with diazomethane. Pullulanase Digestion of Glucans—Samples (2 mg) of purified mycobacterial glucans, pullulan (positive control, Pfanstiehl, Laboratories Inc., Waukegan, IL), and maltoheptaose (negative control, Sigma) were dissolved in 200 μl of CH3COONa (0.5 m, pH 5.6). Twenty μl of pullulanase (4.2 mg/ml, EC 3.2.1.41, Sigma) from Klebsiella pneumoniae were added to the reaction mixtures and incubated for 24 h at 40 °C. The enzyme was inactivated by heating at 100 °C for 10 min, and the reaction mixtures were dried and analyzed by 1H NMR for the completeness of the digestion (the absence of signal resonances at 4.99 ppm assigned to Glc p-(1→6)-residues, see below, under “Results”). Per-O-acetylation of the oligosides released by enzyme digestion were performed by adding a mixture of acetic anhydride/anhydrous pyridine (1:1, v/v) to the samples; the reaction mixtures were left at 37 °C for 90 min and then dried. Dichloromethane (2 ml) and distilled water (2 ml) were added followed by thorough mixing. The organic phases were removed and washed 4 times, dried, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Acetolysis—Dry polysaccharide samples (1 mg) were acetolysed as previously described (22Stewart T.S. Ballou C.E. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 1855-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 1-ml sample of a mixture of acetic acid/acetic anhydride/sulfuric acid (10:10:1, by volume) was added to the samples, and the mixtures were left at 40 °C for 3 h. Anhydrous pyridine (1 ml) and methylene chloride (1 ml) were added followed by thorough mixing. The organic phases were removed and washed three times with water (1 ml), dried, and analyzed. Sugar Analysis—Samples (200 μg) were hydrolyzed with 2 m CF3COOH at 100 °C for 1 h. The resulting materials were dried and dissolved in 200 μl of anhydrous pyridine (Riedel-de Haën, RdH Laborchemikalien GmbH Co., Seelze, Germany) followed by the addition of 100 μl of hexamethyldisilazane (Aldrich) and 50 μl of trimethylchlorosilane (Aldrich) as described (23Sweeley C. Bentley R. Makita M. Wells W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2497-2507Crossref Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The mixture was dried under nitrogen, and the trimethylsilyl derivatives were solubilized in diethyl ether and analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Aminopyrene Trisulfonic Acid Derivatization of Polysaccharides— Samples (250 μg) of glucans were derivatized with 8-aminopyrene 1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (APTS) by adding a large excess (0.55 μl of a 15% acetic acid solution (0.12 m)) of APTS trisodium salts (Fluka) and 30 μl of 1 m NaBH3CN (Aldrich) in an Eppendorf tube. The reaction mixture was heated at 55 °C under a ventilated hood for 24 h. The APTS derivatives of polysaccharides were purified by gel filtration chromatography on a PD10 (Amersham Biosciences) column using distilled water as eluent. The elution profile was monitored by spectrophotometry (λ 450 nm), and the monosaccharide composition of the fractions was determined by acid hydrolysis, trimethylsilylation, and GC. Miscellaneous Analytical Techniques—1H NMR spectra of purified glucans and dextran (Amersham Biosciences) were obtained in D2O (99.9% D) on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer in 5-mm tubes at 500.13 MHz for 1H and at 125.77 MHz for 13C using a 5-mm BBI probe. The temperature was maintained at 343 K to obtain a reasonable line width. The double quantum-filtered COSY experiment was performed using the standard Bruker® pulse-field gradient program cosydfprtp, with presaturation during relaxation delay on HOD signal, 1.5-s recycle delay, 0.41-s acquisition time, 4096 data points in the F2 dimension, and 512 increments in the F1 dimension. The data matrix was zero-filled in the F1 dimension to give a matrix of 4096 × 4096 points, and a shifted sine-bell apodization function was interactively optimized and applied before Fourier transformation. The two-dimensional TOCSY spectra (clmlevprtp) were recorded with an effective spin lock time of 112 and 160 ms using MLEV17 sequence for mixing, a 1.5-s recycle delay, and a 1.46-s acquisition time. The parameters for the two-dimensional heteronuclear (1H-13C) multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) spectra were as follows: inv4gptp standard Bruker® program, 1.5-s recycle delay, 0.68-s acquisition time, GARP 13C decoupling during acquisition. 13C-NMR spectra were obtained using the Bruker® DEPT (distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer) sequence. MALDI-TOF mass spectra (in the positive mode) were acquired on a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser emitting at 337 nm. Samples were analyzed in the reflector mode using an extraction delay time set at 100 ns and an accelerating voltage operating in positive ion mode of 20 kV. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, 150 single shots were averaged for each mass spectrum, and typically, four individual spectra were accumulated to generate a summed spectrum. Mass spectrum calibration was performed using the calibration mixture 1 of Sequazyme™ peptide mass standards kit (Perseptive Biosystems), including known peptide standards in a mass range from 900 to 1600 Da. Internal mass calibration was performed as previously described (24Laval F. Lanéelle M.-A. Déon C. Monsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The stock solutions of peracetylated oligosides were prepared in chloroform at a concentration of 1 mm and were directly applied on the sample plate as 1-μl droplets followed by the addition of 0.5 μl of matrix solution (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 mg/ml) in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v)). Samples were allowed to crystallize at room temperature. The diffusion parameters of the purified polysaccharide solutions (1 mg/ml in distilled water) were determined by dynamic light scattering. The apparatus consisted of a DynaPro-MS/X dynamic light scattering instrument (ProteinSolutions, Charlottesville, VA), providing a 830 nm light beam. Samples were analyzed in a 12-μl quartz sample cell at 20 °C. Using the Dynamic V6 software, dynamic light scattering autocorrelation function data were collected at a scattering angle of 90° with a data acquisition time of 200 s. GC of monosaccharide derivatives was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II apparatus equipped with an OV1 capillary column (0.30 × 25m) using helium gas. The temperature separation program involved an increase from 60 to 100 °C at the rate of 20 °C/min followed by an increase from 100 to 300 °C at the rate of 5 °C/min. GC-MS analyses were performed on a HP 5889X mass spectrometer (electron energy, 70 eV) coupled to a HP 5890 series II gas chromatograph fitted with a column identical to that used for GC; GC-MS analyses were realized in the electron impact mode. The structural differences between the glucans obtained from the CFGs and surface-exposed materials of mycobacteria, including an unspecified BCG substrain (14Misaki A. Yukawa S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1966; 59: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and those derived from the BWG of the Tice substrain of M. bovis BCG (Fig. 1), raised the question of the relatedness of the Tice substrain to other BCG daughter substrains. It was, thus, important to re-examine some of the well defined characters of this strain to clarify its taxonomic status before the structural analysis of its polysaccharide content. Molecular Characterization of BCG Substrains—The Tice substrain of BCG is believed to have derived from the original vaccine strain after 1931, as revealed by comparative genomics of BCG daughter substrains (5Behr M.A. Wilson M.A. Gill W.P. Salamon H. Schoolnik G.K. Rane S. Small P.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1520-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). We investigated the relatedness of the Tice substrain to two other BCG daughter substrains, namely the Pasteur and Connaught substrains, which have also previously been used for the isolation of anti-neoplastic glucans (13Zlotta A.R. Van Vooren J.-P. Denis O. Drowart A. Daffé M. Lefevre P. Schandene L. De Cock M. De Bruyn J. Vandenbussche P. Jurion F. Palfliet K. Simon J. Schulman C.C. Content J. Huygen K. Int. J.

Cytobios. 1997; 90: 47-65PubMed Google Scholar), by well established molecular techniques. Among these is lipid analysis, a method routinely used for the identification and reclassification of mycobacterial strains, because of the diversity and uniqueness of mycobacterial lipids (26Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, li"
https://openalex.org/W1981376791,"Endocytosis of synaptic vesicles follows exocytosis, and both processes require external Ca(2+). However, it is not known whether Ca(2+) influx through one route initiates both processes. At larval Drosophila neuromuscular junctions, we separately measured exocytosis and endocytosis using FM1-43. In a temperature-sensitive Ca(2+) channel mutant, cacophony(TS2), exocytosis induced by high K(+) decreased at nonpermissive temperatures, while endocytosis remained unchanged. In wild-type larvae, a spider toxin, PLTXII, preferentially inhibited exocytosis, whereas the Ca(2+) channel blockers flunarizine and La(3+) selectively depressed endocytosis. None of these blockers affected exocytosis or endocytosis induced by a Ca(2+) ionophore. Evoked synaptic potentials were depressed regardless of stimulus frequency in cacophony(TS2) at nonpermissive temperatures and in wild-type by PLTXII, whereas flunarizine or La(3+) gradually depressed synaptic potentials only during high-frequency stimulation, suggesting depletion of synaptic vesicles due to blockade of endocytosis. In shibire(ts1), a dynamin mutant, flunarizine or La(3+) inhibited assembly of clathrin at the plasma membrane during stimulation without affecting dynamin function."
https://openalex.org/W2143974166,"Angiogenesis is a critical component of the inflammatory response associated with a number of conditions. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) is an angiogenic growth factor that promotes the chemotaxis of endothelial cells and facilitates the maturation of new blood vessels. Ang-1 expression is up-regulated in response to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). To begin to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms by which Ang-1 gene expression is regulated during inflammation, we isolated 3.2 kb of the Ang-1 promoter that contain regulatory elements sufficient to mediate induction of the promoter in response to TNF-α, interleukin-1β, and endotoxin. Surprisingly, sequence analysis of this promoter failed to reveal binding sites for transcription factors that are frequently associated with mediating inflammatory responses, such as NF-κB, STAT, NFAT, or C/EBP. However, putative binding sites for ETS and AP-1 transcription factor family members were identified. Interestingly, among a panel of ETS factors tested in a transient transfection assay, only the ETS factor ESE-1 was capable of transactivating the Ang-1 promoter. ESE-1 binds to specific ETS sites within the Ang-1 promoter that are functionally important for transactivation by ESE-1. ESE-1 and Ang-1 are induced in synovial fibroblasts in response to inflammatory cytokines, with ESE-1 induction slightly preceding that of Ang-1. Mutation of a high-affinity ESE-1 binding site leads to a marked reduction in Ang-1 transactivation by ESE-1, inducibility by inflammatory cytokines, and DNA binding to the ESE-1 protein. Transcriptional profiling of cells transiently transfected with an ESE-1 expression vector demonstrates that the endogenous Ang-1 gene is directly inducible by ESE-1. Finally, Ang-1 and ESE-1 exhibit a similar and strong expression pattern in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Our results support a novel paradigm for the ETS factor ESE-1 as a transcriptional mediator of angiogenesis in the setting of inflammation. Inflammation is an important component of several pathological conditions, including wound healing, atherosclerosis, and arthritis. Inflammation is often associated with the development of granulation tissue consisting of infiltrating mononuclear cells and blood vessels (1Jackson J.R. Seed M.P. Kircher C.H. Willoughby D.A. Winkler J.D. Faseb J. 1997; 11: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 2Koch A.E. Harlow L.A. Haines G.K. Amento E.P. Unemori E.N. Wong W.L. Pope R.M. Ferrara N. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4149-4156PubMed Google Scholar). As this tissue proliferates there are zones of relative hypoxia where growth of the tissue has outstripped the blood vessel supply, triggering signals for further blood vessel development (3Walsh D.A. Rheumatology (Oxford). 1999; 38: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The angiogenesis that results from these signals provides the necessary blood supply, oxygen, and nutrients to support the proliferating tissue, and plays an active role in the transport of inflammatory cells to the site of inflammation (4Koch A.E. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The endothelial cells themselves also provide a source of proinflammatory cytokines.One of the first steps in this process is the induction of angiogenic growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) 1The abbreviations used are: bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; FCS, fetal calf serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; Ang-1, angiopoietin-1; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; RT, reverse transcriptase; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; FCS, fetal calf serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; Ang-1, angiopoietin-1; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; RT, reverse transcriptase; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (5Senger D.R. Claffey K.P. Benes J.E. Perruzzi C.A. Sergiou A.P. Detmar M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). These growth factors promote the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells to sites of inflammation, which is facilitated by the expression of matrix degrading enzymes and integrins on activated endothelial cells (6Senger D.R. Ledbetter S.R. Claffey K.P. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Peruzzi C.A. Detmar M. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 293-305PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelial cells that have migrated to sites of inflammation then organize into small tubes. The formation of stable blood vessels requires the recruitment of surrounding mesenchymal cells and their differentiation into vascular smooth muscle cells. Vessel maturation is facilitated by the angiopoietins (7Suri C. Jones P.F. Patan S. Bartunkova S. Maisonpierre P.C. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar).Ang-1 has the unique property of enhancing the stability of new blood vessels by recruiting surrounding mesenchymal cells and promoting their differentiation to vascular smooth muscle cells (7Suri C.

In contrast to other angiogenic substances like VEGF or bFGF, Ang-1 is not a potent mitogen for endothelial growth. However, Ang-1 is a potent chemoattractant of endothelial cells and enhances endothelial cell migration. Other properties of Ang-1 include its ability to promote the adhesion of endothelial cells to fibronectin, as well as its ability to prevent endothelial cell death by inhibiting apoptosis (8Huang X.L.

Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that Ang-1 mRNA and protein are expressed in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Ang-1 is expressed at low levels in primary human synovial fibroblasts obtained from patients with RA, and can be markedly up-regulated in response to inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α. However, the transcriptional mechanisms by which Ang-1 gene expression is regulated are currently unknown.The purpose of this study was to begin to identify the molecular mechanisms of Ang-1 gene regulation in the setting of inflammation. Our findings support a central role for the ETS transcription factor ESE-1 during this process. ESE-1 was originally identified as a transcription factor that, under basal conditions, is highly restricted to cells of epithelial origin (13Oettgen P. Alani R.M. Barcinski M.A. Brown L. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Munger K. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4419-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, in response to inflammatory stimuli, this factor can be induced in a variety of non-epithelial cells, including vascular smooth muscle cells, chondrocytes, synovial fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (14Rudders S. Gaspar J. Madore R. Voland C. Grall F. Patel A. Pellacani A. Perrella M.A. Libermann T.A. Oettgen P. J. Biol.

We recently demonstrated that ESE-1 is highly expressed in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (15Grall F. Gu X. Tan L. Cho J.Y. Inan M.S. Pettit A.R. Thamrongsak U. Choy B.K. Manning C. Akbarali Y. Zerbini L. Rudders S. Goldring S.R. Gravallese E.M. Oettgen P. Goldring M.B. Libermann T.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this study we present direct evidence indicating a role for ESE-1 in Ang-1 gene regulation. ESE-1 can bind to specific ETS sites within the Ang-1 promoter that are functionally important for the transactivation by ESE-1, expression of ESE-1 in cultured cells leads to induction of the endogenous Ang-1 gene, and Ang-1 exhibits a similar and strong expression pattern in the synovium of patients with RA. In summary, our results support a role for the ETS factor ESE-1 as a novel transcriptional regulator of Ang-1 gene regulation in the setting of inflammation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTissue Culture and Reagents—The cell lines HEK293 (human embryonic kidney), NIH3T3 (mouse fibroblast), and MCF-7 (human breast cancer) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Hyclone, Logan, UT) and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin; Invitrogen). Synovial tissue and bone were obtained at the time of arthroplasty or joint replacement surgery from patients with the clinical diagnosis of RA. Tissue procurement was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Dispersed synovial tissues were prepared by a previously published method (16Gravallese E.M. Manning C. Tsay A. Naito A. Pan C. Amento E. Goldring S.R. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Briefly, synovial tissues were minced on tissue culture plates and treated with Type I collagenase (4 mg/ml; Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ), in DMEM (Invitrogen), incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, treated with 0.25% trypsin for 30 min, harvested, and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min. Pellets were suspended in 0.05% trypsin-0.02% EDTA, centrifuged, and resuspended in 50% phosphate-buffered saline (Ca2+/Mg2+-free), 50% DMEM containing 10% FCS (Sigma). Cells were then centrifuged and suspended in DMEM, 10% FCS, and plated at a density of 10 × 106 cells/10-cm plate. Cells were initially grown for 7–10 days and subsequently subjected to 2–4 passages. TNF-α and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).Expression Vector and Luciferase Reporter Gene Constructs—3239-, 1998-, and 1020-bp fragments corresponding to nucleotides -3040 to +199, -1799 to +199, and -821 to +199 of the human Ang-1 promoter were cloned from human genomic DNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by PCR and subcloned into the pGL2 luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The 1998- and 1020-bp fragments were inserted into the XhoI-HindIII site and the 3239-bp fragment was inserted into the HindIII site upstream of the luciferase gene of the pGL2 vector.DNA Transfection Assays—Cotransfections of 2 × 105 HEK293 or NIH3T3 cells were carried out with varying amounts of reporter gene construct DNA and expression vector DNA using 4 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described (17Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Best J. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5091-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 16 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity. Transfections for every construct were performed independently in duplicates. Cotransfection of a second plasmid for determination of transfection efficiency was omitted because potential artifacts with this technique have been reported and because many commonly used viral promoters contain potential binding sites for ETS factors (18Farr A. Roman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 920Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of the Ang-1 promoter was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In brief, PCR primers encoding the Ang-1 promoter ETS site, -1565 to -1562, and flanking sequences were used, with ATAT substituted for ATCC: 5′-TGTGAATTACATATTGTTAGCCTT-3′ and 3′-AAGGCTAACAATATGTAATTCACA-5′. PCR was performed with Turbo polymerase using the wild type Ang-1 promoter fragment C luciferase reporter construct as a template. The PCR reaction was digested with DpnI, and the undigested plasmids were transformed into DH5α bacteria. Individual minipreps were sequenced to verify incorporation of the ETS site mutation.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—These were performed as described previously (19Dube A. Akbarali Y. Sato T.N. Libermann T.A. Oettgen P. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In brief, whole cell extracts were made from primary human synovial fibroblasts after incubation with TNF-α or IL-1β for 0, 2, 6, 18, 24, and 48 h, using as lysis buffer 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Whole cell extracts were obtained instead of nuclear extracts because the number of cells were limited and the primary synovial fibroblasts do not maintain their phenotype after 4–5 passages. 10 μg of whole cell extract or 2 μl of in vitro translation product and 0.1–0.2 ng of [32P]dATP-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes (5,000–20,000 cpm) in the presence or absence of antibody were run on 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5× TBE buffer. For supershift assays, 1 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-ESE-1 antibody raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the N terminus of human ESE-1 (East Acres Biologicals, Southbridge, MA) was used.Oligonucleotides used as probes are as follows (ETS consensus binding sites underlined: 1) human Ang-1 promoter site -2586 to -2567, 5′-TTTAATGCATCCTGAATTCT-3′ and 3′-AGAATTCAGGATGCATTAAA-5′; 2) human Ang-1 promoter site -2207 to -2188, 5′-TTCCCTCAGGAAATTGTGCA-3′ and 3′-TGCACAATTTCCTGAGGGAA-5′; 3) human Ang-1 promoter site -1573 to -1554, 5′-TGAATTACATCCTGTTAGCC-3′ and 3′-GGCTAACAGGATGTAATTCA-5′; 4) human Ang-1 promoter mutated site -1573 to -1554, 5′-GCTCTGTTGAATTACATATTGTTAGCCTTTC-3′ and 3′-GAAAGGCTAACAATATGTAATTCACAGAGC-5′.RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNAs were generated from 2 μg of mRNA isolated from human synovial fibroblasts using oligo(dT)12–18 priming (Invitrogen) and Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). ESE-1, AML-1, and GAPDH RT-PCRs used equivalent amounts of 0.1 ng of cDNA, 4 ng/μl of each primer, 0.25 units of Taq polymerase (Promega), 150 μm of each dNTP, 3 mm of MgCl2, reaction buffer, and water to a final volume of 25 μl. Ang-1 RT-PCRs used equivalent amounts of 0.1 ng of cDNA, 4 ng/μl of each primer, 0.25 units of Advantage cDNA polymerase mix (Clontech), 150 μm of each dNTP, reaction buffer, and water to a final volume of 25 μl.The sequences of the primers used in this study are as follows: 1) Human ESE-1: sense, 5′-ACCTGGATCCCACTGATGGCAAGCTC-3′ and antisense, 5′-GGAGGAAGAGGTTCTCCAGAGTCGG-3′, with an expected amplification product of 457 bp. 2) Human Ang-1: sense, 5′-TTTCCTCGCTGCCATTCTGACTC-3′, and antisense, 5′-TATGGATGTCAATGGGGGAGGTT-3′, with an expected amplification product of 947bp. 3) Human AML-1: sense, 5′-AAGTCGCCACCTACCACAG-3′ and antisense, 5′-CTCAGCCTCAGAGTCAGATGC-3′, with an expected amplification product of 248 bp (21Niini T. Vettenranta K. Hollmen J. Larramendy M.L. Aalto Y. Wikman H. Nagy B. Seppanen J.K. Ferrer Salvador A. Mannila H. Saarinen-Pihkala U.M. Knuutila S. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 4) Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH): sense, 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′ and antisense, 5′-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3′, with an expected amplification product of 200 bp.RT-PCR amplifications were carried out using a MJ Research thermal cycler PTC-100 as follows: ESE-1, 32 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C and 1 min 30 s at 68 °C followed by 7 min at 68 °C; Ang-1, 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, and 1 min 30 s at 64 °C followed by 7 min at 64 °C; AML-1, 32 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min 30 s at 72 °C followed by 10 min at 72 °C; GAPDH, 32 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 56 °C, and 1 min 30 s at 72 °C followed by 10 min at 72 °C. 5 μl of the amplification product was analyzed on a 2% agarose gel.Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates (50 μg) of MCF7 cells were boiled in Laemmli buffer and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE acrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred on Hybond-polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunoblotted using the ECL Western blotting Detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit polyclonal anti-ESE-1 antibody raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the N terminus of human ESE-1 (East Acres Biologicals, Southbridge, MA) was used at a dilution of 1:1,000, and revealed with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxydase antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) at a dilution of 1:1,000.cDNA Microarrays—Microarray experiments were performed as previously described (22Gu X. Shin B.H. Akbarali Y. Weiss A. Boltax J. Oettgen P. Libermann T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9421-9436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 × 106 human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected in duplicates with 8 μg of PCI-ESE-1 or PCI plasmid using the LipofectAMINE Plus system (Invitrogen). Total RNA was isolated separately from each plate 24 h after transfection using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Atlas Human Cancer 1.2 cDNA microarray nylon membranes (Clontech), each containing 1176 different genes, were hybridized with [32P]dATP-labeled cDNAs derived from 4 μg of total RNA according to the manufacturer at 68 °C in ExpressHyb solution (Clontech) using a Model 2000 Micro Hybridization Incubator (Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA). The filters were washed according to the user's instruction and exposed to Bio-Max MS film (Fisher) for different exposure times. Hybridizations were performed with duplicate experiments. The spot intensities reflecting gene expression levels on the Atlas human cDNA array were quantified using the Atlas Image 2.0 Software (Clontech). The transcriptional profiles in the cells overexpressing ESE-1 were compared with those in the cells transfected with parental PCI vector, normalizing spot intensities based on the average of the intensities of all spots. Genes up-regulated or down-regulated by ESE-1 were validated by RT-PCR.Immunohistochemistry—RA synovial soft tissue and bone were fixed for 48 h in 4% paraformaldehyde and specimens containing bone were subsequently decalcified for at least 2 weeks in 14% EDTA. Specimens were processed for paraffin embedding (Citadel 1000; Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA) and 4- or 5-μm serial sections were cut for immunohistochemical staining using an immunoperoxidase technique with diaminobenzidine (DAB; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) as the chromogen. Briefly, sections were deparaffinized followed by microwave antigen retrieval (GE Sensor convection microwave oven) in 10 mm EDTA pH 7.5 at 93 °C for 10 min and allowed to cool for at least 2 h. Sections were washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and incubated for 60 min in serum block (10% fetal bovine serum and 10% normal rabbit serum diluted in TBS). Sections were then incubated with an affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti-human Ang-1 antibody (L41309M, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., Tarrytown, NY), purified rabbit polyclonal anti-human ESE-1 antibody (AB3482, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), or with an isotype matched control antibody (polyclonal Rabbit IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, CA) for 60 min. All incubations were carried out at room temperature. Sections were washed between every subsequent step with TBS. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating the sections in 3% H2O2 (diluted in TBS) for 30 min. Sections were subsequently incubated for 30 min with a biotinylated F(ab′)2 fragment of swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Dako), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Dako), and developed with DAB (Dako) chromogen to the manufacturer's specifications. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin (Sigma Diagnostics). Slides were examined and photographed using a transmitted light microscope and camera (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).RESULTSIsolation and Characterization of the Human Ang-1 Promoter— The molecular mechanisms required for the induction of Ang-1 in response to inflammatory cytokines are currently unknown. To begin to identify potential mechanisms of Ang-1 gene regulation we isolated a series of genomic fragments (Fig. 1, A–C) of the human Ang-1 promoter, up to 3.2 kb in length, by long range PCR using human genomic DNA. The entire sequence of the Ang-1 gene is published in the human genome data base (accession NT 008046). Verification of the sequence was performed by automated sequencing. Comparison of the mouse and human Ang-1 promoter sequences revealed a relatively high overall degree of sequence homology. We examined the human Ang-1 promoter sequence for potential binding sites for transcription factors known to be involved in inflammation, such as NF-κB, JAK/STAT, PPAR, NFAT, and C/EBP. Surprisingly, no obvious binding site for any of these transcription factor families was identified. However, putative binding sites for members of the AP-1 and ETS families were identified. In addition, putative AML-1 and CBF-β binding sites were identified in the Ang-1 promoter.Induction of the Ang-1 Promoter by Inflammatory Cytokines—To evaluate whether the Ang-1 promoter contains regulatory elements capable of mediating induction in response to inflammatory cytokines the three genomic fragments encoding the Ang-1 promoter (A–C) were incorporated into the pGL2 luciferase reporter construct. NIH3T3 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with each Ang-1 reporter construct, followed by stimulation with TNF-α (Fig. 2A). We have previously demonstrated that TNF-α consistently induces Ang-1 mRNA expression in cultured synovial fibroblasts (10Gravallese E.M. Pettit A.R. Lee R. Madore R. Manning C. Tsay A. Gaspar J. Goldring M.B. Goldring S.R. Oettgen P. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2003; 62: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the 3.2-kb Ang-1 promoter construct C (-3040/+199) with TNF-α resulted in a 4-fold induction of the promoter. Similarly, stimulation of the 2-kb construct B (-1799/+199) with TNF-α led to a 4-fold increase in transactivation. However, further deletion to a 1-kb construct (Ang-1 A, -821/+199) markedly reduced the inducibility of the promoter to TNF-α, suggesting that the main regulatory elements responsible for mediating induction of the Ang-1 gene reside in the nucleotide region between -1799 and -821. We also examined the inducibility of constructs A and B in NIH3T3 fibroblasts after stimulation with IL-1β and LPS (Fig. 2, B and C). A 4–5-fold level of induction of the activity of construct B was seen in response to IL-1β and LPS, but no induction was seen with construct A, suggesting the importance of regulatory elements between nucleotides -1799 and -821 in mediating this induction of Ang-1 gene expression. This region contains putative AP-1 and ETS binding sites (Fig. 1).Fig. 2Transactivation of the Ang-1 promoter in response to inflammatory stimuli. Transactivation studies of Ang-1 luciferase reporter constructs A (-821/+199), B (-1799/+199), and C (-3040/+199) (300 ng each) in NIH3T3 fibroblasts after stimulation with TNF-α (50 ng/ml) (A), IL-1β (1 ng/ml) (B), or LPS (1 ng/ml) (C). The change in luciferase activity of the promoter construct after stimulation is expressed as fold induction compared with the activity of the promoter construct in unstimulated cells (DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Transactivation of the Ang-1 Promoter by ETS Factors—As shown in Fig. 1, there are several putative binding sites for members of the ETS transcription factor family in the Ang-1 promoter. Selected members of the ETS transcription factor family have been shown previously to mediate the induction of other genes associated with inflammatory responses (23Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 24Kramer B. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6577-6583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We therefore postulated that ETS factors might also be involved in the regulation of Ang-1 in response to inflammatory stimuli and tested the ability of a panel of ETS factors to transactivate the full-length Ang-1 promoter. Cotransfection experiments using mammalian expression plasmids encoding a panel of ETS factors and the 3.2-kb Ang-1 promoter luciferase construct were performed in HEK293 cells. We chose HEK293 cells because they do not express Ang-1 and can be transfected with high efficiency. As is shown in Fig. 3, only one of the ETS factors tested, ESE-1, was able to transactivate the Ang-1 promoter by ∼3-fold. These results suggest that ESE-1 is a potential transcriptional regulator of the Ang-1 promoter.Fig. 3Transactivation of the Ang-1 promoter by a panel of ETS factors. Transactivation of the 3.2-kb Ang-1 luciferase reporter construct C (-3040/+199) (300 ng) by a panel of ETS transcription factors (150 ng each) compared with the empty mammalian expression plasmid (PCI, 150 ng) in HEK293 cells.

Three putative ETS binding sites were identified in the Ang-1 promoter corresponding to regions beginning at -2578, -2199, and -1565 (Fig. 1). The binding of in vitro translated ESE-1 protein was compared with control extracts in a gel mobility shift assay using radiolabeled oligonucleotides encoding the three putative ETS binding sites (Fig. 4). Whereas weak binding of ESE-1 to the first two sites (lanes 2 and 4) compared with the control extract (lanes 1 and 3) was observed, ESE-1 bound with high affinity to the third site (lane 6). Interestingly, this high affinity ESE-1 binding site (-1565/-1562) is located within the region of the Ang-1 promoter that is required for induction by inflammatory cytokines, whereas the low affinity sites are not.Fig. 4Gel mobility shift assays for ESE-1 binding to putative ETS sites in the Ang-1 promoter. In vitro translated ESE-1 protein (lanes 2, 4, 6) or control extract (lanes 1, 3, 5) was used with end-labeled oligonucleotide probes encoding putative ETS sites starting at positions -2578 (lanes 1 and 2), -2199 (lanes 3 and 4), and -1565"
https://openalex.org/W2042100538,"The three mammalian nitric-oxide synthases produce NO from arginine in a reaction requiring 3 electrons per NO, which are supplied to the catalytic center from NADPH through reductase domains incorporating FAD and FMN cofactors. The isoforms share a common reaction mechanism and requirements for reducing equivalents but differ in regulation; the endothelial and neuronal isoforms are controlled by calcium/calmodulin modulation of the electron transfer system, while the inducible isoform binds calmodulin at all physiological Ca2+ concentrations and is always on. The thermodynamics of electron transfer through the flavin domains in all three isoforms are basically similar. The major flavin states are FMN, FMNH·, FMNH2, FAD, FADH·, and FADH2. The FMN/FMNH· couple is high potential (∼100 mV) in all three isoforms and is unlikely to be catalytically competent; the other three flavin couples form a nearly isopotential group clustered around -250 mV. Reduction of the flavins by the pyridine nucleotide couple at -325 mV is thus moderately thermodynamically favorable. The ferri/ferroheme couple in all three isoforms is ∼-270 mV in the presence of saturating arginine. Ca2+/calmodulin has no effect on the potentials of any of the couples in endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) or neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS).

Nitric-oxide synthases (NOS) comprise a family of complex, modular enzymes, including three isoforms expressed in mammals. The endothelial and neuronal isoforms (eNOS and nNOS) are signal generators under the control of calcium/calmodulin (5Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The generation of NO from arginine and oxygen by nitricoxide synthases requires the delivery of three pyridine nucleotide derived electrons to the catalytic site per mol of NO formed. The electron transfer system in endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS, NOSIII) utilizes one flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and one flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor (10Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M.

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6627-6631Google Scholar). The electron transfer pathway is closely related to the NADPH P450 reductase/P450 system, and significant sequence homology exists between the flavoprotein binding domains in the two systems (10Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Google Scholar). The details of electron transfer differ significantly in FAD/FMN flavoprotein reductases related by homology and function. The two flavin cofactors have the capacity to accept four electrons. In mammalian P450 reductase, extensive studies have revealed that the system operates between the one and three electron reduced states (18Iyanagi T. Makino N. Mason H.S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1701-1710Google Scholar, 19Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1956-1963Google Scholar). The FMN/FMNH· couple has a relatively high potential (∼-50 to -100 mV) and is not a kinetically competent reductant in the catalytic cycle. The FMNH·/FMNH2 and FAD/FADH· couples are intermediate in potential between the pyridine nucleotide pool and the physiological acceptor and are the primary functional one-electron couples in the catalytic cycle. The FADH·/FADH2 couple is too negative to be readily reduced by NADPH. Recently, the homologous reductase domains of cytochrome P450 BM3, which contains both flavin and P450 heme domains in a single polypeptide, have been shown to cycle primarily between the one- and two-electron reduced states; in this system, the order of the FMN potentials is reversed, and the FMN semiquinone stability constant is slightly less than unity. Both FMN one-electron couples appear to be good enough reductants to participate in the catalytic cycle (20Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Turner K.L. Holt R.A. Govindaraj S. Poulos T.L. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13816-13823Google Scholar). In enzymes of the P450 superfamily, it is well known that binding of “type I” substrates shifts the spin state equilibrium of ferriheme toward the high spin form, while simultaneously raising the midpoint potential (21Sligar S.G. Cinti D.L. Gibson G.G. Schenkman J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 90: 925-932Google Scholar, 22Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5399-5406Google Scholar, 23Gunsalus I.C. Sligar S.G. Biochimie (Paris). 1976; 58: 143-147Google Scholar). This is an important step in the catalytic cycle, since it makes the heme a competent acceptor of pyridine nucleotide-derived electrons. The phenomenon has been especially well studied in P450cam and has been discussed in terms of “spin state control” of redox equilibria (23Gunsalus I.C. Sligar S.G. Biochimie (Paris). 1976; 58: 143-147Google Scholar). An increase in the reduction of NOS ferriheme by NADPH has been reported after arginine addition (24Stuehr D.J. Abu-Soud H.M. Rousseau D.L. Feldman P.L. Wang J. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 34: 207-213Google Scholar), suggesting that a similar coupling of substrate binding and heme midpoint potential plays a role in that system as well. Previous studies of independently expressed reductase and oxygenase domains using potentiometric and stoichiometric titration have produced important information about the midpoint potentials of the heme and flavin components (25Noble M.A. Munro A.W. Rivers S.L. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Yellowlees L.J. Shimizu T. Sagami I. Guillemette J.G. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16413-16418Google Scholar, 26Du M. Yeh H.C. Berka V. Wang L.H. Tsai A.L. J.

These results provide indications of redox equilibria in intact enzymes and indicate that at least in separate domains heme and flavin potentials are calmodulin-independent. We have reported preliminary results from NOS holoenzymes (e.g. Refs. 28Salerno J.C. Gao Y.T. Smith S.M.E. Montgomery H.J. Guillemette J.G. Wilson D.L. Weinberg J.B. Ghosh D.K. Nitric Oxide Biol.

Materials—All chemicals used for purification were obtained from Sigma. N-hydroxy-l-arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin were from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, ME). Expression and Purification of iNOS—The human iNOS Δ70 enzyme fused to a histidine tag at the amino end was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by a combination of metal chelating and affinity chromatography as previously described (30Ghosh D.K.

Enzyme sample concentrations were determined on the basis of heme concentration. Expression and Purification of Rat nNOS—Rat nNOS was expressed in E. coli and purified as previously described (32Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Potentiometric Titrations—Titrations were carried out under nitrogen essentially as described by Dutton (33Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Google Scholar) using a titration vessel with a platinum/calomel combination electrode calibrated by titrating redox mediators of known potential. Titrations were monitored optically with an Aminco DW2000 scanning dual wavelength spectrophotometer. Mediators used in the default system were: methyl viologen, 5 μm; benzyl viologen, 5 μm; safranine o, 2 μm; anthroquinone 2-sulfonate, 10 μm; anthroquinone 2,6-disulfonate, 10 μm; resorufin, 2 μm; pyocyanine, 2 μm; phenazine, 5 μm; and 1,4-hydroxynapthoquinone, 5 μm. Titrations of optical bands were simulated using summed contributions from two heme redox states and six flavin redox states. At any wavelength these contributions are of the following forms. ODheme_ox=Cheme⋅εheme_ox⋅10(Eh-Em(heme))F/RT/(1+10(Eh-Em(heme))F/RT)(Eq. 1) ODheme_red=Cheme⋅εheme_red/(1+10(Eh-Em(heme))F/RT)(Eq. 2) ODFMN=CFMN⋅εFMN/(1+10(Eh-E1FMN)F/RT+10(Eh-E1FMN)F/RT10(Eh-E2FMN)F/RT)(Eq. 3) ODFMNH=CFMN⋅εFMNH⋅10(Eh-E1FMN)F/RT/(1+10(Eh-E1FMN)F/RT+10(Eh-E1FMN)F/RT10(Eh-E2FMN)F/RT)(Eq. 4) ODFMNH2=CFMN⋅εFMNH2⋅10(Eh-E1FMN)F/RT10(Eh-E2FMN)F/RT/(1+10(Eh-E1FMN)F/RT+10(Eh-E1FMN)F/RT10(Eh-E2FMN)F/RT)(Eq. 5) In these expressions R is the gas constant, F is the Faraday constant, and T is the Kelvin temperature. The value of RT/F at 25 °C is ∼59.6 mV. The variables of the form ϵFMN represent extinction coefficients of the redox states of the hemes and flavins at wavelengths chosen for analysis; OD values are the contributions of individual components to the optical density. Variables of the form cheme represent the total concentration of all heme (or, equivalently, flavin) states, including redox, spin, and conformational states, in rapid equilibrium on the time scale of redox equilibration in the experiment. Eh is the standard potential relative to the hydrogen electrode as measured potentiometrically. The midpoint potentials of the one-electron couples are specified by the parameters Em(heme), E1FMN, and E2FMN. E1FMN, E2FMN, E1FAD, and E2FAD are the midpoint potentials for the first and second one-electron reductions of the FMN and FAD. In some cases multiple heme components that differ in concentration, extinction coefficient, and midpoint potential have been introduced for simulation purposes. Analogous expressions are included for the three FAD reduction states. Both the apparent midpoint potentials (e.g. Em(heme), E1FMN) and the extinction coefficients at wavelength λ are dependent on experimental conditions such as ligand concentration. Each redox state is composed of multiple ligation, conformational, and protonation states which behave as a single state in the potentiometric titration as long as they are in rapid equilibrium on the time scale of the experiment (minutes). Simulation of a titration at any wavelength is accomplished by stepping the Eh and calculating the total and component ODs at each potential. Simulations can be simplified by choosing wavelengths at which the extinction coefficients of several states are negligible or by choosing isosbestic points so that the absorbance from one or more chromophores is independent of potential. The redox titration of the flavin cofactors at a single pH thus can be described in terms of six flavin redox states, neglecting protonation, if the flavins are well described as independent electron carriers. Inclusion of cooperativity between the flavins requires nine states, but the current titrations could be well described without cooperative effects. The pH dependence of the system was modeled by inclusion of two protonation states for each flavin redox state; one state was insufficient to simulate the results. Simulation of the dependence of midpoint potential on pH was accomplished by incrementing the pH and calculating the apparent midpoint potential at each pH as previously described (34Ohnishi T. King T.E. Salerno J.C. Blum H. Bowyer J.R. Maida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5577-5582Google Scholar). The pH dependence of midpoint potentials is derived from ionizable groups with different pK values in the oxidized and reduced states. For a one-electron couple with a single associated ionizable group, the pH dependence is of the following form. Em=E0+RT/Flog10(1+10(pH-pKR)1+10(pH-pKO))(Eq. 6) For a one-electron couple with two such groups, in the absence of cooperativity the expression is of the following form. Em=E0+RT/Flog10(1+10(pH-pKR1)+10(pH-pKR2)+10(pH-pKR1)10(pH-pKR2)1+10(pH-pKO1)+10(pH-pKO2)+10(pH-pKO1)10(pH-pKO2))(Eq. 7) The factor RT/F introduces characteristic pH dependence values, which are multiples of 59.6 mV except in the vicinity of a pK. Interactions between the ionizable groups designated by the subscripts 1 and 2 can be introduced by multiplying the cross terms by factors δox and δr which modify the equilibrium constant for the protonation of one group when the other is protonated. Potentiometric Titration of nNOS Holoenzyme—Changes in the redox state of cofactors are evaluated using their spectral features in the UV-visible region. The optical spectrum of the enzyme is dominated by the Soret band of the ferriheme at 400 nm. The Soret band is sensitive to redox and spin state and in nNOS as isolated includes contributions from high and low spin heme. Oxidized flavins absorb at 380, 470, and 520 nm; the 380 nm band is obscured by the heme Soret band, and the 520 nm band is visible as a prominent shoulder on the 470 nm band. The disappearance of these bands is a measure of the reduction of FMN and FAD. Both flavin semiquinones contribute bands at 600–650 and 520 nm. The band at 650 nm is overlapped by a charge transfer band from high spin ferriheme. We routinely take spectra at a few points during an initial reductive titration of the sample, followed by a more detailed oxidative titration. Spectra taken at the same potential during the oxidative and reductive phases are nearly identical except for a small dilution correction. NNOS and eNOS have each been titrated more than 10 times with reproducible results. Fig. 1 shows spectra obtained during a titration at pH 7. The reduction of the heme causes the Soret maximum to shift with a midpoint potential of slightly above -300 mV. As the potential is lowered the oxidized flavin bands in the 450–500 nm region are bleached, and a reduced heme α band complex becomes prominent near 560 nm. Spectra shown have had mediator contributions, obtained from independent titrations, subtracted. The maximum corrections for mediators in the spectral and potential regions covered are about 0.25 OD units in the Soret due to the sharp viologen bands at 400 nm and 0.1 OD units elsewhere. The spectra of fully oxidized and fully reduced enzyme so corrected are very similar to the spectra of oxidized and reduced enzymes without mediators, and titrations were conducted with concentrations of individual mediators 10-fold lower without significantly altering the spectra produced. The cost of lowering the mediator concentration is visibly slower equilibration and greater uncertainty in potential measurement. The region with the highest information content includes the overlapped bands at 600–650 nm. Because these bands are due to flavin semiquinones and high spin ferriheme, they contain information about all five one-electron Em values. Equivalent information can be extracted by simulations of other wave-lengths, but the blue neutral semiquinone absorbance is followed most easily in the 600–650 nm region. The semiquinones also absorb near 520 nm. A plot of the absorbance at 650 nm during a titration is shown in Fig. 2 together with a simulation, which includes the individual contributions of heme, FAD and FMN. The simulation makes use of the known properties of the heme and flavin chromophores. The oxidized and reduced flavins do not contribute in this region, and the heme contribution is solely from the charge transfer band of the high spin ferric state; this allows us to set the extinction coefficients of the five non-contributing states to zero. The high potential absorbance is thus primarily due to oxidized heme, establishing the extinction coefficient for simulation purposes. The flavin semiquinone extinction coefficients, together with the potentials E1 and E2 for each flavin, determine the magnitude and potential dependence of the flavin radical contribution. In a typical titration 15–20 data points contribute to the determination of the five unknown parameters, including the heme midpoint potential. Initial simulations assume equivalent contributions from FMN and FAD semiquinones in that the concentrations and extinction coefficients are set equal. Fine adjustments to simulations sometimes produce the best fit with one flavin in slight excess (10% or less) over the other. At low potentials the bands in this region disappear, but as the potential is raised heme oxidation and FAD radical formation contribute to the absorbance. At slightly higher potential FMN semiquinone formation becomes significant; since the FMN radical is more stable than the FAD radical, the maximum intensity of the band is reached above the Em values of the FMN/FMNH· and FADH·/FADH2 couples, which are similar. Since the FMN radical is quite stable the maximum intensity plateaus before falling to the intensity of the heme charge transfer band as FMN is formed. The potentials of the five one-electron couples for nNOS are given in Table I. The flavin couples are -250 mV for the FAD/FADH· couple (E1FAD), -260 mV for the FADH·/FADH2 couple (E2FAD), -220 mV for the FMNH·/FMNH2 couple (E2FMN), and -120 mV for the FMN/FMNH· couple (E1FMN). The midpoint potential (Em(7.0)) of the heme is -290 mV when fitted as a single component but can also be well described by two components as described later.Table IMidpoint potentials at pH 7 for arginine and biopterin replete mammalian NOS holoenzymes and related systems Heme potentials in the single column reflect the best single component fits to the data.

The titration of the flavin absorbance around 480 nm is shown in Fig. 3. The data are well described by the heme and flavin potentials given above, but the contribution of the radicals is not significant enough to determine the E2 potentials of FMN and FAD from this spectral region. A simulation of nNOS titration data at 560 nm is shown in Fig. 4. The 560 nm band can be simulated in much the same way as the 650 nm band, but the contributions from the overlap of the 520 nm semiquinone band are weak, so the flavin potentials are less reliable. As indicated by the simulation, the titration is consistent with the Table I values for the flavin potentials. The data are described better by including two heme components, one of which is significantly lower in potential than the best single heme component fits obtained at other wavelengths. Fig. 5, a and b, show plots of the same titration monitored in the Soret region. The heme Soret band titration has a midpoint consistently 15–20 mV above the value obtained from the 650 nm band when fit as a single component as in Fig. 5a. While this difference is at the edge of resolution primarily because of the range of acceptable simulation fits to the data, the consistently lower potential obtained in comparison to other bands in the same titration makes us confident in the discrepancy. As shown in Fig. 5b, a two (heme)-component fit significantly improves the simulation. The majority component in the simulation shown has a midpoint of -250 mV, while the minority component, accounting for about 20% of the heme contribution, has a potential of -350 mV; reasonable fits can be obtained with potentials down to -400 mV for the low potential component because of end point uncertainty for the minor component. The heme component of the 650 nm band is the result of high spin ferriheme only, while the formation of the 560 nm band can be the sum of the reduction of ferric high spin and low spin components. A reasonable hypothesis explains the titration in terms of a majority, primarily high spin component titrating at -250 to -270 mV with the 650 nm band, and a minor primarily low spin component titrating at ∼-350 mV, which contributes at 650 nm only to the extent that it equilibrates rapidly with a high spin form. In the absence of arginine the titration of (primarily low spin) nNOS heme is heterogeneous, and the midpoint potential is around -350 mV. Titrations of nNOS preparations without arginine or tetrahydrobiopterin are very heterogeneous. This can be observed spectrally in the Soret and elsewhere and in the titration of the heme as multiple components (data not shown). The heme is primarily low potential and low spin and heterogeneity reflects the existence of a variety of states not in rapid equilibrium. In general agreement with previous results obtained with reductase domains (25Noble M.A. Munro A.W. Rivers S.L. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Yellowlees L.J. Shimizu T. Sagami I. Guillemette J.G. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16413-16418Google Scholar) and with our results from eNOS holoenzyme, no effect on either heme or flavin potentials was observed from the addition of Ca2+/calmodulin to the titrations. This is significant since NO synthesis is controlled by regulation of electron transfer from NADPH to heme. Potentiometric Titration of iNOS Holoenzyme—The spectra of iNOS during potentiometric titration are similar to the nNOS spectra shown in Fig. 1 and have been omitted to save space. As in nNOS, oxidized flavin bands are clearly visible around 500 nm in oxidized samples. As the potential is lowered, oxidized flavin bands decrease in intensity, to be replaced by longer wavelength species characteristic of blue neutral flavosemiquinones at 600–650 nm. This species decreases as the potential is lowered further. A ferriheme charge transfer band contributes to the absorbance in the 600–650 nm region; it is visible without the flavin contribution in very oxidized samples and decreases as the heme is reduced. In the Soret region the initial change during reduction is due to the loss of the bands of the oxidized flavins, followed by a red shift in the heme Soret maximum concurrent with the latter stages of flavin reduction. In Fig. 6 the absorbance at 650 nm is plotted as a function of Eh. The results are similar to those obtained with nNOS. The simulation of the data again includes contributions of heme, FAD, and FMN. The maximum intensity at intermediate potentials is due to FMN semiquinone formation; since as in nNOS the FMN radical is more stable than the FAD radical, producing maximum semiquinone concentration above the Em values of the FMN/FMNH· and FADH·/FADH2 couples. The maximum intensity of the 650 nm band again has a broad peak as the potential is raised before falling to the intensity of the heme charge transfer band as oxidized FMN is formed. The potentials of the five one-electron couples for iNOS are given in Table I. The flavin couples are -240 mV for the FAD/FADH· couple (E1FAD), -270 mV for the FADH·/FADH2 couple (E2FAD), -245 mV for the FMNH·/FMNH2 couple (E2FMN), and -105 mV for the FMN/FMNH· couple (E1FMN). The midpoint potential (Em(7.0)) of the heme is -270 mV. These results are consistent with measurements at other wavelengths (plots not shown). Two titrations of iNOS gave consistent results, but because of limitations on the amount of available material the data are of lower quality than the nNOS and eNOS results. Potentiometric Titration of eNOS; pH Dependence of Holoenzyme Midpoint Potentials—Potentiometric titration of eNOS produced absorbance spectra very similar to the spectra of nNOS shown in Fig. 1 and have been previously presented by us in preliminary form (28Salerno J.C. Gao Y.T. Smith S.M.E. Montgomery H.J. Guillemette J.G. Wilson D.L. Weinberg J.B. Ghosh D.K. Nitric Oxide Biol. Chem. 2002; 6: 458Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows plots of the titration of the 600 and 650 nm bands of eNOS holoenzyme at three pH values. The data can be readily simulated using the potentials shown in Table I, which are generally similar to the nNOS and iNOS results. The most notable feature of these plots is the extension of the potential range at which radicals can be observed on the low potential side of the titration as the pH is raised from 7 to 9. High quality simulations, generally consistent with these values but s"

The five M2 membrane-spanning segments largely line the channel. In the present work we probed the water surface accessibility of the β1 subunit M2 segment using the substituted cysteine accessibility method. We assayed the reaction of the negatively charged sulfhydryl-specific reagent, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS–), by its effect on subsequent currents elicited by EC50 and saturating GABA concentrations. pCMBS–, applied with GABA, reacted with 14 of the 19 residues tested. At the M2 cytoplasmic end from 2′ to 6′ only β1A252C (2′) and β1T256C (6′) were pCMBS–-reactive in the presence of GABA. We infer that the M2 segments are tightly packed in this region. Toward the extracellular half of M2 all residues from β1T262C (12′) through β1E270C (20′) reacted with pCMBS– applied with GABA. We infer that this region is highly mobile and loosely packed against the rest of the protein. Based on differences in pCMBS– reaction rates two domains can be distinguished on the putative channel-lining side of M2. A faster reacting domain includes the 2′, 9′, 12′, 13′, and 16′ residues. The slower reacting face contains the 6′, 10′, and 14′ residues. We hypothesize that these may represent the channel-lining faces in the closed and open states and that gating involves an 80–100° rotation of the M2 segments. These results are consistent with the loose packing of the M2 segments inferred from the structure of the homologous Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.

In the case of GABAA receptors the most common subunit stoichiometry is 2α, 2β, and 1γ subunit (6Chang Y. Wang R. Barot S. Weiss D.S. J.

The 4 Å resolution structure of the homologous Torpedo ACh receptor membrane-spanning domain solved by cryoelectron microscopy of two-dimensional crystals provides a view of the closed state of the transmembrane, channel-forming domain (11Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). This latter study showed that the five M2 segments form an inner ring of helices that line the closed channel. The M2 segments appear to be loosely packed against the outer ring of helices formed by the M1, M3, and M4 segments.To probe the protein packing around the M2 segment we assayed the accessibility of cysteines (Cys) substituted for the GABAA receptor β1 subunit M2 segment residues to react with the sulfhydryl-specific reagent, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS–). pCMBS– is a rigid, negatively charged molecule that will fit into a right cylinder that is ∼6 Å in diameter and ∼10 Å in length. pCMBS– reacts with Cys and covalently couples HgC6H4SO3- onto the sulfhydryl. pCMBS– is membrane-impermeant (20VanSteveninck J.

Masden N.B. Avramovic-Zikic O. Can. J. Biochem. 1971; 49: 742-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); thus, a reaction is much more likely with water-accessible Cys that can ionize. To facilitate comparisons with the residues in the M2 segments of other superfamily members an index numbering system is used (23Miller C. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1195-1205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) where the absolutely conserved positively charged residue at the cytoplasmic end of M2, β1Arg251, is 0′, and the residue aligned with the extracellular ring of charge (24Imoto K. Busch C. Sakmann B. Mishina M. Konno T. Nakai J. Bujo H. Mori Y. Fukuda K. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 335: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), β1Glu270, is 20′ (Fig. 1). In the substituted-cysteine-accessibility method (SCAM) reaction of sulfhydryl reagents with engineered Cys is usually assayed by their effects on subsequent functional responses of the channel (25Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Previous substituted cysteine accessibility studies of the GABAA receptor α1 and ACh receptor α subunit were performed using saturating concentrations of agonist for the test pulses before and after application of the sulfhydryl reagents (15Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 26Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). It has become apparent that modification at some positions alters currents elicited by EC50 concentrations of agonist but not saturating concentrations (27Horenstein J. Akabas M.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 870-877PubMed Google Scholar, 28Zhang H. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7952-7964Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Williams D.B. Akabas M.H. Biophys.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42035-42042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This presumably arises because covalent modification at these positions alters channel gating but does not alter single channel conductance or maximal open probability. Alternatively, it may arise from counteracting/compensating effects on gating/desensitization and conductance. Thus, screening with only saturating agonist test pulses results in failure to identify all of the reactive Cys.In the present study we screened the reactivity of pCMBS– with Cys replacing the GABAA receptor β1 subunit M2 segment residues from β1Ala252 (2′) to β1Glu270 (20′) using both EC50 and saturating GABA test pulses. We found that pCMBS– reacted with Cys substituted for all residues between the 12′ and 20′ levels. This implies that all of the residues are at least transiently water-accessible. Toward the cytoplasmic end of the channel reactivity is much more limited, suggesting tighter protein packing around the cytoplasmic end of the channel.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutagenesis and Oocyte Expression—PCR mutagenesis of the rat β1 subunit in the pGEMHE vector, in vitro mRNA transcription, and preparation and injection of Xenopus oocytes were performed as described previously (27Horenstein J. Akabas M.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 870-877PubMed Google Scholar). All mutants were sequenced to confirm mutation and rule out secondary mutations. For certain mutants, cDNA was prepared from mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR (One-Step RT-PCR Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and sequenced separately. The β1Cys mutants were coexpressed with wild type α1 and γ2S subunits by injecting oocytes with 50 nl of RNA (200 pg/nl) mixed in a ratio of 2:1:2 α1:β1:γ2 to discourage the formation of β1 homopentamers. Oocytes were incubated at 16–17 °C for 2–3 days before use (31Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).Electrophysiology—Currents were recorded under two-electrode voltage clamp from oocytes continuously perfused at 5 ml/min with Ca2+-free Frog Ringer buffer (115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES pH 7.5 with NaOH) using equipment and procedures described previously (27Horenstein J. Akabas M.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 870-877PubMed Google Scholar). The perfusion chamber volume was ∼200 μl. Agarose cushion electrodes (32Schreibmayer W. Lester H.A. Dascal N. Pflügers Arch. 1994; 426: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) were filled with 3 m KCl and had a resistance of less than 2 megohms. The ground electrode was connected to the bath by a 3 m KCl/agar bridge. The holding potential was maintained at –45 mV unless otherwise specified.To determine EC50 and maximal GABA concentrations, GABA concentration-response relationships were fitted to the Hill equation, I=(Imax[A]n)/(EC50n+[A]n)(Eq. 1) where Imax is the maximal peak current, [A] is the agonist concentration, and n is the Hill coefficient, using Prism3 software (GraphPad, San Diego) as we have done previously (33Bera A.K. Chatav M. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43002-43010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).To determine the irreversible effects of pCMBS– on the GABA-induced currents, test pulses of GABA were applied at EC50 and saturating concentrations before and after application of pCMBS–. The following series of GABA applications preceded and followed the pCMBS– application: 10 × EC50 GABA, 20 s; 10 × EC50 GABA, 20 s; EC50 GABA, 20 s; EC50 GABA, 20 s. To ensure stability of the responses, if paired current responses either before or after pCMBS– were not within 10% of each other the oocyte was not used. The GABA applications were separated by 3–5-min washes with Ca2+-free Frog Ringer buffer to allow complete recovery from desensitization. The percent effect was determined by %effect=((IGABA,after/IGABA,before)-1)*100(Eq. 2) where IGABA, after is the average peak current of the GABA test pulses after pCMBS– application, and IGABA, before is the average peak current of the initial GABA applications. Data are given as means ± S.E.For screening, pCMBS– was applied for 1 min at 0.5 mm either in the absence or in the presence of a saturating concentration of GABA. This combination of time and concentration was chosen because they were the maximal concentration and duration that caused no significant increase in the leak conductance of uninjected Xenopus oocytes. This limits our ability to detect reactive residues. As discussed below, given the variability of responses, application of a reagent must cause a net change in current greater than ∼30% to be significantly different from wild type by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (for n between 3 and 6). With this threshold and the pCMBS– reaction conditions (0.5 mm applied for 1 min), if complete reaction caused 100% inhibition of the GABA-induced current we would detect reactive positions with a second order reaction rate >12 liters/mol/s.Measurement of Reaction Rates—pCMBS– reaction rates were determined by the effect of sequential brief applications of pCMBS– as we have done previously (29Williams D.B. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2563-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Reeves D.C. Goren E.N. Akabas M.H. Lummis S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42035-42042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A test pulse of GABA was applied to measure the GABA-induced current. pCMBS– (2 μm–0.5 mm) ± GABA was applied for 15–60 s. Following washout a GABA test pulse was applied, and the induced current was measured. The effect of five to eight brief, sequential applications of pCMBS– ± GABA were determined. The magnitudes of the GABA test currents were normalized relative to the initial test current. The normalized current was plotted as a function of the cumulative duration of pCMBS– application and fitted with a single exponential function using Prism3 software (GraphPad). The second order rate constant was calculated by dividing the pseudo-first order rate constant obtained from the exponential fit by the pCMBS– concentration. For a given mutant, second order rate constants were independent of the pCMBS– concentration used. For two Cys mutants, S265C and R269C, reaction rates were calculated by fitting an exponential function to the pCMBS–-activated inward current induced in these mutants.Statistics—Data are expressed as the percent change of current after modification ± S.E. The significance of differences between each mutant and wild type was determined by one way ANOVA using the Dunnett's post hoc test (Prism3). Reaction rates are given as the mean ± S.E.RESULTSCharacterization of the Mutants—All of the β1 subunit Cys mutants were expressed with wild type α1 and γ2S subunits in Xenopus oocytes. GABA-induced currents were recorded from oocytes expressing each of the Cys mutants. For wild type receptors the maximum GABA-induced currents were 1,163 ± 181 nA (n = 6). For the mutants the maximum currents ranged from 118 ± 27 nA (n = 6) for β1V258C (8′) to 1,454 ± 202 nA (n = 6) for β1G254C (4′). Oocytes expressing α1β1L259Cγ2S (9′) had a large holding current in the absence of GABA. The β1L259C channels have a high spontaneous open probability and significant decrease in agonist EC50 as has been reported for 9′ mutations in this and other gene superfamily members (34Mortensen M.

Thus, during pCMBS– application in the presence of GABA the channels occupy multiple conformational states, and we cannot distinguish whether the reaction is occurring in one or more of these states.A 1-min application of 0.5 mm pCMBS– in the presence of 100 μm GABA irreversibly altered the subsequent GABA-induced test currents in 14 of the 19 mutants tested but had no effect on wild type (Fig. 2). At eight of the positions (T256C, V258C, L259C, T260C, T262C, I264C, S265C, and E270C) the reaction significantly altered both EC50 and saturating test pulses. At three positions (A252C, T266C, and L268C) only currents elicited by saturating GABA test pulses were significantly altered, and at three other positions (T257C, H267C, and R269C) only currents elicited by EC50 GABA test pulses were significantly altered. At four positions (T257C, H267C, R269C, and E270C) a reaction with the negatively charged pCMBS– caused potentiation of the subsequent GABA-induced currents. In contrast, at the other 10 positions covalent modification by pCMBS– resulted in inhibition of the subsequent GABA-induced currents.Fig. 2Average effect of a 1-min application of 0.5 mm pCMBS– in the presence of saturating GABA on subsequent currents of wild type α1β1γ2S receptors and of the β1M2 segment Cys mutants. Black bars indicate effects significantly different from wild type by one way ANOVA; white bars indicate effects that were not significantly different from wild type. A negative effect indicates inhibition of subsequent GABA-induced currents. A positive effect indicates potentiation of subsequent GABA-induced currents. The mean ± S.E. is shown.

This presumably occurred because of an increase in spontaneous opening probability following covalent modification of the Cys.At the other five positions (L253C, G254C, I255C, M261C, and T263C) pCMBS– application did not significantly alter the subsequent GABA-induced currents or the holding current. We cannot distinguish whether these positions are not reactive with pCMBS– or whether reaction at these positions had no functional effect on the macroscopic currents elicited by EC50 and saturating GABA. We were surprised that pCMBS– application to T263C had no functional effect. In all other Cys-loop receptor subunits tested the 13′ position reacted with sulfhydryl reagents (15Xu M. Akabas M.H. J.

To ensure that the T263C mutant was correct we have sequenced both the plasmid DNA and the product of a reverse transcription-PCR on the in vitro transcribed mRNA. Both confirm that the Cys mutant is correct (data not shown). Application of a larger sulfhydryl-reactive methanethiosulfonate (MTS) derivative, MTS-benzophenone, inhibited subsequent currents in oocytes expressing the T263C mutant (data not shown). Thus, we infer that T263C is a sulfhydryl-reactive position but that reaction with pCMBS– had no functional effect.pCMBS– Reaction Rates in the Presence of GABA—The reaction rates of pCMBS– applied in the presence of GABA with the engineered Cys mutants were measured as illustrated in Fig. 3. The reaction rates are summarized in Table II. The reaction rates ranged between 40 ± 10 m–1 s–1 with β1T257C (7′) and 31,978 ± 12,251 m–1 s–1 with β1T262C (12′). To investigate whether the negative charge at the 20′ position (β1Glu270) affected the pCMBS– reaction rate with the Cys substituted at the adjacent 17′ position, β1H267C (Table II), we constructed a double mutant β1H267C/E270N. Removal of the negative charge at the 20′ position did not significantly alter the pCMBS– reaction rate with the 17′ Cys (data not shown).Fig. 3Measurement of the pCMBS– reaction rate with β1T256C. A, consecutive applications of 100 μm GABA and 100 μm GABA + 250 μm pCMBS– are indicated by the black bars above the current traces. The holding potential was –45 mV. Each current trace is separated by a 5-min wash with Ca2+-free Frog Ringer buffer to allow complete recovery from desensitization. B, the GABA test current amplitudes between the pCMBS– applications were normalized by the initial GABA current and plotted as a function of the cumulative pCMBS– application duration. The data were fitted with a single exponential decay function. The second order reaction rate constant is 855 m–1 s–1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IISecond order reaction rates for pCMBS– applied in the presence of GABA with the Cys mutantsMutantSecond order rate of reactionnm-1 s-1β1E270C597 ± 2444β1R269C872 ± 3044β1L268CNDaND, not determined.β1H267C641 ± 1003β1T266C21,319 ± 6,4993β2S265C9,500 ± 8008β1I264C3,614 ± 1,1224β1T263CNDβ1T262C31,978 ± 12,2514β1M261CNRbNR, no reaction.β1T260C2,925 ± 3143β1L259C7,000 ± 1,2853β1V258C2,324 ± 8163β1T257C40 ± 106β1T256C1,304 ± 2356β1I255CNRβ1G254CNRβ1L253NDβ1A252C16,663 ± 4,8265a ND, not determined.b NR, no reaction. Open table in a new tab We were unable to measure the pCMBS– reaction rate with β1L268C because it produced biphasic effects at low concentrations (data not shown). Initially the GABA test responses were potentiated, and after further pCMBS– application they were inhibited. Because there are two β subunits in each functional receptor we infer that for the L268C mutant the reaction rates with the two Cys were different leading to the biphasic effects.Effect of pCMBS– Applied in the Absence of GABA—Ideally, by determining whether pCMBS– reacted in the absence of GABA we would be determining accessibility in the closed state of the receptor. In the absence of GABA, the wild type receptors are largely in the closed state because of their very low spontaneous open probability. The spontaneous open probability of the Cys mutants, however, is not known. For all of the mutants except β1L259C the initial holding current was not significantly greater than the current from oocytes expressing wild type receptors.A 1-min application of 0.5 mm pCMBS– in the absence of GABA irreversibly altered the subsequent GABA currents of eight of the 18 Cys mutants (Fig. 4). At four positions (V258C, T262C, I264C, and L268C) both EC50 and saturating test pulses were altered. At two positions (T266C and R269C) only the subsequent saturating GABA currents were altered, and at two other positions (T256C, S265C) only the subsequent EC50 GABA currents were significantly altered. The pCMBS– reaction at all of these positions caused inhibition of the subsequent GABA-induced currents. At R269C there was a significant increase in the holding current after pCMBS– application in the absence of GABA. This was presumably because of an increase in the spontaneous open probability following covalent modification. This was not observed when R269C was modified by pCMBS– in the presence of GABA.Fig. 4Average effect of a 1-min application of 0.5 mm pCMBS– in the absence of GABA on subsequent currents of wild type α1β1γ2S receptors and of the β1M2 segment Cys mutants.

Among the various types of substances secreted by the dermal granular amphibian glands, there is a wide range of peptides and proteins, often displaying potent antimicrobial activities and providing an effective defense system against parasite infection. In the present work, we report the NMR solution structure and the biological activity of a cationic 14-residue amphiphilic α-helical polypeptide named Hylaseptin P1 (HSP1), isolated from the skin secretion of the hylid frog Hyla punctata. The peptide antimicrobial activity was verified against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas no significant lytic effect was detected toward red or white blood cells."
https://openalex.org/W1994148496,"Oxidative stress has been shown to underlie a diverse range of neuropathological conditions. Glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity is a well described model of oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration that relies upon the ability of extracellular glutamate to inhibit a glutamate/cystine antiporter, which results in a depletion of intracellular cysteine and the blockade of continued glutathione synthesis. Glutathione depletion leads to a gradual toxic accumulation of reactive oxygen species. We have previously determined that glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity is accompanied by a robust increase in activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) member extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) and that this activation is essential for neuronal cell death. This study demonstrates that delayed ERK activation is dependent upon the activity of phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and that transient but not sustained PI3K inhibition leads to significant protection of neurons from oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we show that transient PI3K inhibition prevents the delayed activation of MEK-1, a direct activator of ERK, during oxidative stress. Thus, this study is the first to demonstrate a novel level of cross-talk between the PI3K and ERK pathways in cultured immature cortical neuronal cultures that contributes to the unfolding of a cell death program. The PI3K pathway, therefore, may serve opposing roles during the progression of oxidative stress in neurons, acting at distinct kinetic phases to either promote or limit a slowly developing program of cell death.

The MAPK family member ERK is activated by a vast array of stimuli that impinge upon the cell and acts on a diverse range of cellular targets (7Davis R.J. J. Biol.

We have previously demonstrated in immature primary cortical neurons that activation of ERK is necessary for glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity (6Stanciu M. Wang Y. Kentor R. Burke N. Watkins S.

We now demonstrate that this ERK activation is PI3K-dependent and that transient but not sustained PI3K inhibition leads to significant protection of neurons. Thus, the PI3K pathway may serve opposing roles during the progression of oxidative stress in neurons, acting at distinct kinetic phases to either promote or limit a slowly developing program of cell death. Primary Cortical Cultures—Cortices from embryonic day 17 Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses (Hilltop Lab Animals, Scottdale, PA) were dissected and manually dissociated by repeated trituration using fire-polished glass pipettes in Hanks' balanced salt solution (5.4 mm KCl, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 137 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4) without Ca2+ or Mg2+ (Invitrogen) followed by passage through a 40-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences) to remove clumped cells. Cells were counted and plated on 50 μg/ml poly-d-lysine-treated culture plates at a density of ∼2.1 × 104 cells/cm2. Cell viability was routinely greater than 80% as assessed by uptake of trypan blue dye upon plating. Cultures were maintained for 3–4 days in medium (DMEM (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 10% Ham's F-12 nutrient supplement (Invitrogen), 1.9 mm glutamine, 24 mm Hepes, and 4.5 mg/ml glucose) at 37°C and 5% CO2. All of the experiments were performed on DIV 3–4-day-old cultures to avoid the confounding effect of functional ionotropic glutamate receptor expression, which is not present in immature cultures but which begins soon after this time period (30Mizuta I. Katayama M. Watanabe M. Mishina M. Ishii K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, all of the chemicals and reagents used were purchased from Sigma. Cell Line Culture—HT22 cells, a hippocampal cell line that is particularly sensitive to glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity (31Davis J.B. Maher P. Brain Res. 1994; 652: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cell Viability—18 h following the initiation of all of the treatments, cultures were incubated for 10 min with 2 μl (1:1000 dilution) of a 6.25 mg/ml solution of propidium iodide (PI) to visualize dead or dying PI-positive cells. Cells were observed under an inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with phase-contrast optics (Nikon Eclipse TE200), and PI-labeled and unlabeled cells were counted. The percentage of labeled cells in each field was then calculated (∼200 cells/field at ×400). Three random fields were counted for each condition in at least three separate cultures. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were treated as described, scraped and collected into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), pelleted at 2–3 × 103 rpm for 5 min, and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm NaVO4, 100 μm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 5 μl of protease inhibitor mixture/ml of lysis buffer. Total protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad kit. Equivalent amounts of total protein (either 20 or 30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in PBS, 0.1% v/v Tween 20. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-phospho-ERK, anti-total ERK, anti-phospho-Akt, and anti-total-Akt, all from Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) overnight at 4 °C with 3% dry milk or 5% bovine serum albumin, washed 3 × 10 min with PBS, 0.1% v/v Tween 20, and then exposed to the appropriate horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were again washed 3 × 10 min with PBS, 0.1% v/v Tween 20, and immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) using standard x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Several different exposure times were used for each blot to ensure linearity of band intensities. MEK Kinase Activity Assay—MEK kinase activity was determined via the ability of immunoprecipitated MEK to phosphorylate purified unphosphorylated glutathione S-transferase-ERK2 protein using 32P-labeled ATP. 400 μg of total lysate protein from primary immature cortical cultures were pre-cleared with 50 μl of a 100 mg/ml stock of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating shaker. The supernatants were then immunocomplexed with a nonspecific rabbit IgG antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep) or a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the N-terminal region of MEK-1 (anti-MEK-1 NT, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) overnight at 4 °C on a rotating shaker. The immunocomplexes were absorbed to 80 μl of the 100 mg/ml stock of protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating shaker and subsequently washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer (see above). The pelleted beads were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer (lysis buffer + 50 mm MgCl2 and 100 μm ATP) supplemented with 10 μCi of 32P-labeled ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and 0.250 μg of non-phosphorylated glutathione S-transferase-ERK2 (Upstate Biotechnology) per reaction. The kinase reaction was maintained at 37 °C for 25 min and terminated by pelleting the Sepharose beads and adding 10 μlof6× Laemmli buffer to the individual supernatant fractions, which were then placed on ice. After boiling for 10 min, 20 μl of each of the samples was loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 150 V for 1 h. Autoradiographic exposures of the gels were performed for 4–12 h at –80 °C. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Cortical cells were plated directly onto 0.05 mg/ml poly-d-lysine coated 12-well tissue culture plates. Cells were treated with or without 5 μm cytosine-arabinoside (Ara-C) at DIV 2. On DIV 4, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 18 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked for 1 h with PBS supplemented with 10% goat serum (Invitrogen) at room temperature. The fixed cells were incubated with anti-GFAP (1:500) in PBS with 10% goat serum overnight at 4 °C and washed three times with PBS before incubation with a fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody (1:1000 anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and the nuclear stain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:1000). Images were viewed with a Zeiss Axiophot inverted fluorescence microscope, and the number of glial cells was counted in three random fields and calculated as a percentage of total cells. Detection of Intracellular ROS—Intracellular ROS was measured as described previously (32Hsieh H. Cheng C. Wu S. Chiu J. Wung B. Wang D. J. Cell Physiol. 1998; 175: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Primary cortical cells were treated as described, and the dye DCFH-DA (50 μm) (Molecular Probes) was added for 1 h to establish a stable intracellular level of the probe. DCFH-DA is taken up by cells where it is converted by esterases to DCFH, and is in turn oxidized to DCF in the presence of ROS. The extent of DCF fluorescence is therefore a direct readout of intracellular oxidative stress. After 1 h, cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, scraped from their plates, and measured for DCF fluorescence intensity (excitation 475, emission 525) in a fluorometer (Wallac Victor2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell counts from each sample were used to normalize the DCF signal intensity. A 500 μm dose of H2O2 (2 h) was used as a positive control for the detection of oxidative stress. Data were expressed as the fold-change in DCF signal intensity compared with control cells within each independent experiment. Statistics—One-way ANOVA was performed with Bonferroni's post-hoc correction for multiple comparisons. p values <0.05 were taken to be significant. LY294002 Protects Primary Mixed Cortical Cultures from Glutamate-induced Oxidative Toxicity—Primary immature cortical neuronal cultures (DIV 3–4) underwent an apoptotic cell death within 24 h of exposure to 5 mm glutamate (4Ratan R.R. Murphy T.H. Baraban J.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 376-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). This glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity has been extensively used as a model for oxidative stress in neurons (3Murphy T.H. Schnaar R.L. Coyle J.T. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1624-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 4Ratan R.R. Murphy T.H. Baraban J.M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 376-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 5Li Y.

Angiolieri M.R. Johnson J.W. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12200-12206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). We have previously determined that glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity can be abrogated in cortical cultures by administration of the MEK inhibitor U0126 (10 μm) (6Stanciu M. Wang Y. Kentor R. Burke N. Watkins S. Kress G. Reynolds I. Klann E. Angiolieri M.R. Johnson J.W. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12200-12206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Mixed cultures of immature cortical cells (DIV 3) were either left untreated, treated with 5 mm glutamate, or treated with 5 mm glutamate administered with 10 μm U0126 for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, U0126 protects these cells from glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity. To examine the role of PI3K-Akt in glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity, we used various doses of the specific PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. Because the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway has been so reliably associated with neuroprotection in a wide variety of neurotoxicity models, we anticipated that the administration of LY294002 would not be able to prevent glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity. Surprisingly, LY294002 conferred significant neuroprotection against glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity at doses ranging from 10 to 40 μm (Fig. 1B, 20 and 40 μm doses shown). To quantify the ability of these inhibitors to abrogate glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity, we employed the PI-uptake assay, which utilizes the property of this fluorescent dye to be taken up selectively by dying or dead cells but not by viable cells. PI-labeled and unlabeled cells were counted in three random fields per experimental condition in at least three separate cultures 18 h after the initial exposure to glutamate. At this time point, cells destined to die have begun to retract their processes, to have shrunken cell bodies, and to display condensed nuclei. The vast majority of cells treated with glutamate displayed all of these features within 20–24 h and became detached from the plate soon after this time. Fig. 2 demonstrates the dose dependence for the neuroprotective effects of LY294002. Doses of LY294002 ranging from 1 to 5 μm did not abrogate glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity, whereas higher doses (e.g. 10–30 μm) significantly protected cells (p < 0.001). The highest dose of LY294002 (e.g. 40 μm) had a slightly less protective effect, which approached significance. The administration of 20 μm alone did not lead to cell death (Fig. 4C), but 40 μm LY294002 alone exhibited some toxicity (Fig. 2A). Wortmannin, which inhibits PI3K through a different mechanism than LY294002 but is much less stable in aqueous solution (33Walker E.H. Pacold M.E. Perisic O. Stephens L. Hawkins P.T. Wymann M.P. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 909-919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar), also protected against glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity and was not toxic when administered alone (Fig. 2C).Fig. 4LY294002 is metabolized or sequestered by glial cells in mixed cortical cultures. Western blots were performed using whole cell lysate protein (20 μg/lane) from neuron-enriched cultures and HT22 cells (a hippocampal cell line). Blots were probed with anti-phospho-Akt-specific antibodies, stripped, and reprobed with anti-total Akt antibodies. A, the transient inhibition of PI3K (as assessed by phosphorylated Akt) observed in mixed cortical cultures is not seen in neuron-enriched cultures. Neuron-enriched cultures were obtained by treating mixed cultures (DIV 2) with 5 μm cytosine-β-d-Ara-C for 2 days. These cultures were then treated with a 20 μm dose of LY294002 for either 1 or 10 h, and whole cell lysate protein was collected for Western blot analysis. B, LY294002-induced PI3K inhibition is prolonged in HT22 cells. HT22 cells were treated with 10 μm LY294002 for 1, 2, 4, 6, or 9 h, and whole cell lysates were collected for Western blot analysis. C, the toxicity of various doses of LY294002 in mixed- and neuron-enriched cortical cultures was assessed by PI uptake (see Fig. 2) 18 h after treatment. Neither 20 μm LY294002 administered in one single dose or in two repeated doses 6 h apart were toxic to mixed-cortical cultures. However, single doses of LY294002 (10–30 μm) were significantly toxic to neuron-enriched cultures. Ara-C represent neuron-enriched cultures. ***, p < 0.001; LY, LY294002.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether a subthreshold 0.5 μm U0126 dose (i.e. a dose that did not by itself protect neurons from glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity; Fig. 2B) could potentiate the neuro-protective effect of LY294002, 0.5 μm U0126 and increasing doses of LY294002 (1–40 μm) were co-administered to cortical cultures with 5 mm glutamate. In the presence of this subthreshold dose of U0126, the minimum dose of LY294002 that was found to be significantly neuroprotective was 5 μm, a 2-fold lower dose than observed in the absence of U0126 (Fig. 2B). However, the 1 μm LY294002 dose approached significance (p < 0.012 before the stringent Bonferroni post-hoc correction for multiple comparisons) in its neuroprotective effect. These results suggest that some cross-talk between the PI3K-Akt and MEK-ERK pathways may be operating in these neurons undergoing oxidative stress. The manner in which LY294002 was administered was critical for its neuroprotective effect. For example, one bolus of inhibitor (40 μm) given at the initiation of glutamate treatment led to some protection from toxicity (p < 0.034 before post-hoc correction, Fig. 2A). However, administering one 20 μm dose of LY294002 at the initiation of glutamate treatment and a subsequent 20 μm dose 6 h later completely abolished the neuroprotective effect of the drug (Fig. 2A). This phenomenon was also observed for an analagous 30–30 μm LY294002-dosing schedule (Fig. 2A). The administration of two 20 μm doses of LY294002 6 h apart by itself was not toxic to the cells (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, delaying the administration of LY294002 by 6 h after the addition of glutamate abolished any protective effect of the compound (Fig. 2C). This evidence would suggest that some critical PI3K-dependent event occurs within 6 h, but not later, that is necessary for glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity. Both LY294002 and Wortmannin Only Transiently Inhibit PI3K in Mixed Cortical Cultures—To confirm that LY294002 and wortmannin were indeed inhibiting the PI3K-Akt pathway in our cultures, we administered the drugs for various amounts of time and monitored levels of phosphorylated Akt as an output measure of PI3K activity. As shown in Fig. 3A, in primary immature mixed cortical cultures, a single LY294002 treatment (20 μm) only transiently inhibited Akt phosphorylation. This dose had conferred significant neuroprotection from glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity (Figs. 1B and 2A). This was similarly observed in wortmannin-treated cultures (Fig. 3B). Consistently, phosphorylated Akt returned to base-line levels within ∼6 h after the initial administration of both drugs. Thus, LY294002 and wortmannin administration to mixed primary cortical cultures both inhibit PI3K transiently and have no long term effect (i.e. beyond 6 h) on the PI3K-Akt pathway. LY294002 Is Sequestered or Metabolized by Glial Cells in Mixed Cortical Cultures—Because LY294002 is known to be stable in aqueous solution, the apparent loss after 6 h of its efficacy to inhibit PI3K action on one of its downstream targets (i.e. Akt) would be consistent with metabolism or sequestration of the compound. To further explore this phenomenon of transient PI3K inhibition in our culture system, we asked whether the presence of glial elements in the system was responsible for this apparent LY294002 inactivation. Our cultures typically contained ∼20–25% GFAP-positive cells at DIV 3–4 as determined by immunocytochemical staining (20.3% ± 7.2 S.E.). The anti-mitotic agent Ara-C was added to the mixed cultures, and LY294002 was administered 2 days later after the vast majority of glial cells were eliminated. The efficacy of Ara-C in eliminating GFAP-positive cells was verified by immunocytochemistry (i.e. fewer than 1% of cells were GFAP-positive). As shown in Fig. 4A, a single administration of 20 μm LY294002 to these enriched neuronal cultures was very effective in inhibiting PI3K activity for a prolonged period of time (i.e. 10 h). This implies that the transient inhibition of PI3K activity in mixed cultures given a single dose of LY294002 may be due to glial metabolism or sequestration of the drug. To further test this hypothesis, we administered a lower dose of LY294002 (10 μm) to the hippocampal cell line, HT22. These cultures are devoid of glial cells, and therefore, we expected LY294002 to have a prolonged effect in inhibiting PI3K. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 4B, a single dose of LY294002 (10 μm) was sufficient to inhibit PI3K for extended periods of time. Furthermore, low doses of LY294002 were toxic to HT22 cells (data not shown), which confirms that prolonged maintenance of PI3K activity plays an important role in neuronal cell survival. To further confirm that the maintenance of PI3K activity is important to the survival of primary cortical neurons, we measured the viability of cells in Ara-C-treated neuron-enriched cultures following treatment with LY294002. As shown in Fig. 4C, 20 μm LY294002, administered in one single dose or two doses 6 h apart to mixed cortical cultures, shows no toxic effect. However, in neuron-enriched cultures, single doses of LY294002 ranging from 10 to 30 μm showed significant neurotoxicity (Fig. 4C, p < 0.001). Thus, prolonged PI3K inhibition alone is sufficient to undermine cell survival in our cultures. Transient Early PI3K Inhibition Prevents the Development of a Delayed ERK Activation—We have previously determined that glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity is associated with a delayed chronic activation"
https://openalex.org/W2045234628,"Capacitative calcium influx plays an important role in shaping the Ca2+ response of various tissues and cell types. Inhibition by heavy metals is a hallmark of store-operated calcium channel (SOCC) activity. Paradoxically, although zinc is the only potentially physiological relevant ion, it is the least investigated in terms of inhibitory mechanism. In the present study, we characterize the inhibitory mechanism of the SOCC by Zn2+ in the human salivary cell line, HSY, and rat salivary submandibular ducts and acini by monitoring SOCC activity using fluorescence imaging. Analysis of Zn2+ inhibition indicated that Zn2+ acts as a competitive inhibitor of Ca2+ influx but does not permeate through the SOCC, suggesting that Zn2+ interacts with an extracellular site of SOCC. Application of the reducing agents, dithiothreitol (DTT) and β-mercaptoethanol, totally eliminated Zn2+ and Cd2+ inhibition of SOCC, suggesting that cysteines are part of the Zn2+ and Cd2+ binding site. Interestingly, reducing conditions failed to eliminate the inhibition of SOCC by La3+ and Gd3+, indicating that the Zn2+ and lanthanides binding sites are distinct. Finally, we show that changes in redox potential and Zn2+ are regulating, via SOCC activity, the agonist-induced Ca2+ response in salivary ducts. The presence of a specific Zn2+ site, responsive to physiological Zn2+ and redox potential, may not only be instrumental for future structural studies of various SOCC candidates but may also reveal novel physiological aspects of the interaction between zinc, redox potential, and cellular Ca2+ homeostasis.

The release of Ca2+ from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores is followed in many cell types by the opening of store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCC) 1The abbreviations used are: SOCC, store-operated calcium channel(s); LTCC, l-type calcium channel(s); DTT, dithiothreitol; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid, Type A; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; TG, thapsigargin. that refill the Ca2+ stores (1Parekh A.B.

Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The genes linked to SOCC activity have not been clearly identified. However, an accumulating body of evidence indicates that members of the family of membrane proteins, Trp, first discovered in Drosophila but with many mammalian homologues, are mediating the store-operated Ca2+ flux (6Minke B. Cook B. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 429-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The cation influx mediated by SOCC is highly Ca2+-specific. Other divalent cations such as Ba2+ and Sr2+ are also permeable albeit at a much slower rate (3Hoth M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 7Itagaki K. Kannan K.B. Livingston D.H. Deitch E.A. Fekete Z. Hauser C.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4063-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the absence of divalent cations, it has been reported that the SOCC becomes permeable to Na+ (8Bakowski D. Parekh A.B. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 487-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have indicated that this mono-valent cation influx is not mediated by the SOCC but rather by MIC channels (10Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Calcium influx mediated by the SOCC participates in refilling of internal Ca2+ stores in addition to modulating the Ca2+ response triggered by various agonists (2Zitt C. Halaszovich C.R. Luckhoff A. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 2002; 66: 243-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Such regulation of the Ca2+ response has been suggested to control a wide range of processes including secretion, cell growth, and proliferation (11Minke B. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 21: 629-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The opening of the SOCC under metabolic stress, it should be added, results in a prolonged rise of intracellular Ca2+, an important element in the signaling cascade leading to cell death (12Kunzelmann-Marche C. Freyssinet J.M. Martinez M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5134-5139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Chetham P.M. Babal P. Bridges J.P. Moore T.M. Stevens T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L41-L50PubMed Google Scholar). Trivalent cations such as La3+ and Gd3+ and the divalent cations Cd2+ and Zn2+ have been employed previously as inhibitors of the SOCC and have contributed to understanding of this entry route for cations (14Ebisawa T. Kondo I. Masaki E. Hori S. Kawamura M. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 15Kawamura M. Terasaka O. Ebisawa T. Kondo I. Masaki E. Ahmed A. Kagata M. J.

Paradoxically, La3+,Gd3+, and Cd2+, which are not physiologically relevant, have been the most commonly studied cations, whereas zinc, which is highly relevant physiologically, is the least understood with respect to the mechanism by which it affects inhibition (1Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Endogenous Zn2+, by virtue of its interactions with specific Zn2+ binding sites, modulates a number of ion channels, including NMDA and GABA receptors, as well as regulating transporters such as the dopamine transporter (17Choi Y. Chen H.V. Lipton S.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 392-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Choi D.W. Koh J.Y. Annu. Rev.

Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Zinc inhibition of Ca2+ influx, mediated by SOCC, has been shown to modulate intracellular Ca2+ signals, thereby modifying cellular functions (14Ebisawa T. Kondo I. Masaki E. Hori S. Kawamura M. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The majority of zinc ions are complexed to metalloproteins such as enzymes, metallothioneins, and transcription factors. It is, therefore, unclear whether the minute concentrations of free zinc, found in most organs, are sufficient to block SOCC-mediated Ca2+ influx. It is also not known whether zinc binding sites are allosteric or whether they are associated with the cation permeation pathway. In the present study, we describe the basic characteristics of the Zn2+ inhibitory site on the SOCC. Our results indicate that Zn2+, at physiological concentrations, competitively blocks the Ca2+ flux via SOCC, without permeating through this pathway. We further show that the SOCC inhibition by zinc, but not by lanthanides, is completely eliminated by an increase in redox potential, indicating that cysteines are part of the Zn2+ inhibitory site that is distinct from the lanthanide site. Such interplay between zinc and redox, shown previously with regard to sequestration and release of zinc ions by cysteine-rich metallothioneins (21Sensi S.L. Ton-That D. Weiss J.H. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 10: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), may have important physiological implications with respect to the regulation of the Ca2+ response in salivary submandibular acini and duct cells. Cell and Tissue Preparation—HSY (human salivary gland cell line) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (22Moran A. Turner R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1405-C1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Min-6 cells (a mouse insulinoma cell line) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% l-glutamine, 71.5 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 15% calf serum bovine donor (23Gomez E. Pritchard C. Herbert T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48146-48151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Rat submandibular ducts and acini were prepared essentially as described previously (24Dehaye J.P. J. Trace Elem. Med. Biol. 1995; 9: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The preparations were mounted on glass coverslips that were coated with CellTak (BD Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions, 30 min prior to the Fura-2 loading. Fluorescent Calcium Imaging—Cells grown on coverslips were loaded for 30 min at room temperature with 5 μm Fura-2 AM (1 mm stock in Me2SO, Tef Labs, Austin, TX) in Ringer's solution composed of (in mm): 120 NaCl; 5.4 KCl; 1.8 CaCl2; 0.8 MgCl2; 10 HEPES; 10 glucose; pH 7.4, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Ducts and acini were loaded by 2.5 μm Fura-2 AM in the presence of 0.025% pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes). Fura-2-loaded cells were washed twice in Ringer's solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated for an additional 15 min at room temperature to facilitate the hydrolysis of the dye. Coverslips were then mounted in a perfusion chamber placed on the microscope stage, and Ca2+ imaging was carried out as described previously (25Hershfinkel M. Grossman N. Moran A. Sekler I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11749Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The zinc-dependent Ca2+ rise triggered by ZnR (25Hershfinkel M. Grossman N. Moran A. Sekler I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11749Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) was eliminated by pretreating HSY cells with 80 μm zinc for 30 min and then thoroughly washing with zinc-free Ringer's. All the results shown are the average of at least 120 cells, from at least three independent experiments. For the sake of clarity, only every 4–5th data point is shown in the graphs. Zinc Acts as a Competitive Inhibitor of Ca2+ Permeation through SOCC—The opening of the SOCC following depletion of intracellular stores plays an important role in the physiology of exocrine glands (14Ebisawa T. Kondo I. Masaki E. Hori S. Kawamura M. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 26Liu X. Rojas E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C571-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To activate and monitor SOCC in HSY cells, loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fura-2, we depleted intracellular calcium stores using 200 nm thapsigargin (TG, Alomone Labs) in nominally calcium-free Ringer's solution. Application of TG was followed by a slow rise of [Ca2+]i, leaking from the intracellular pools, and recovery of Ca2+ to resting levels. The subsequent addition of Ca2+ to the perfusing solution was followed by a massive calcium influx (Fig. 1a), which was totally blocked by application of 20 μm Gd3+ or La3+ (Fig. 1b), indicating that it is mediated by SOCC (1Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Application of 20 μm Zn2+ had a similar inhibitory effect (Fig. 1b). The free Zn2+ concentration in extracellular fluids is estimated to be in the range of 10–7-10–5 molar (27Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to assess the physiological significance, it was important to determine the concentration range at which Zn2+ strongly inhibits the SOCC. Varying concentrations of Zn2+ were applied, and the maximal initial calcium influx rate was determined at different Ca2+ concentrations. To quantify the inhibitory effect of Zn2+, d[Ca2+]i/dt was plotted against the Zn2+ concentration in the perfusing solution (Fig. 2a). Fitting the data with a Michaelis-Menten equation yielded apparent Ki for each calcium concentration. The Ki values of Zn2+ inhibition of SOCC suggest that Zn2+ ions have the potential to inhibit SOCC activity at concentrations found not only in exocrine glands but also in many other tissues, including pancreatic islets of Langerhans (28Gee K.R. Zhou Z.L. Qian W.J. Kennedy R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 776-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), brain (29Frederickson C.J. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 10Crossref Google Scholar), colon (30Knudsen E. Jensen M. Solgaard P. Sorensen S.S. Sandstrom B. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 1274-1282PubMed Google Scholar), and the male reproductive system (27Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol.

The calcium influx rate at the indicated zinc concentrations was expressed as the percentage of maximal influx rate (no zinc added) for each calcium concentration used. The line is a fit to a Michaelis-Menten equation, yielding an apparent Ki for each Ca2+ concentration. The inset shows the full range of Zn2+ concentration that was used. In b, the apparent Ki exhibits linear dependence on Ca2+ concentration. The extrapolated Ki for Zn2+ at the absence of Ca2+ is 0.2 ± 0.1 μm. The linear relationship between the Ki values for Zn2+ and extracellular Ca2+ concentration indicates that Zn2+ competitively inhibits Ca2+ influx.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Zinc modulates the activity of channels and transporters such as the dopamine transporter, GABA, and NMDA channels by interacting with allosteric sites (31Hosie A.M.

Brain Res. 2001; 910: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). On other proteins such as the glycine receptor, CIC chloride channel, and the l-type Ca2+ channel, zinc acts as a competitive inhibitor of ion permeation (33Kerchner G.A. Canzoniero L.M. Yu S.P.

To distinguish between these two modes of inhibition, the Ki for Zn2+ inhibition of Ca2+ influx through the SOCC was plotted versus extracellular Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 2b). The linear dependence indicates that Zn2+ acts as a competitive inhibitor of Ca2+ influx through the SOCC. Zn2+ Does Not Permeate through the SOCC—The permeation of Zn2+ through several types of cationic channels, most notably glutamate channels, purinergic P2X receptor, and the l-type Ca2+ channels, has important physiological and pathophysiological implications (36Frederickson C.J. Suh S.W. Silva D. Thompson R.B. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1471S-1483SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Weiss J.H. Sensi S.L. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 365-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In contrast to these, Zn2+ does not permeate through, but rather modulates channels such as the GABA receptor and the dopamine transporter (31Hosie A.M. Dunne E.L. Harvey R.J. Smart T.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 38Norregaard L. Visiers I. Loland C.J. Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Gether U.

To determine whether Zn2+ modulation of the SOCC also involves permeation through the SOCC, we used a similar experimental paradigm to that described in Fig. 1a but replaced the Ca2+ applied following the depletion of the stores with 80 μm Zn2+ (Fig. 3a). Because Fura-2 is ∼100-fold more sensitive to Zn2+ than to Ca2+, it can be effectively used to determine whether Zn2+ permeates into cells (40Atar D. Backx P.H. Appel M.M. Gao W.D. Marban E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2473-2477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 41Canzoniero L.M. Sensi S.L. Choi D.W. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3a, no change in Fura-2 fluorescence was observed following the opening of the SOCC in the presence of zinc, suggesting that the SOCC is impermeable to this ion. To confirm that this result in HSY cells did not stem from insufficient sensitivity, we monitored Zn2+ permeation in Min-6 insulinoma cells that functionally express both SOCC and LTCC (23Gomez E. Pritchard C. Herbert T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48146-48151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 42Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M. Yu S.P. Ying H.S. Koh J.Y.

As shown in Fig. 3b, depolarization that triggers the opening of LTCC was followed by a robust Zn2+ influx. Using the SOCC opening paradigm, no change in the fluorescent signal was observed when Zn2+ was applied (Fig. 3b), although Ca2+ permeation is monitored. Our results, therefore, indicate that the SOCC is impermeable to Zn2+. The Zn2+ Inhibitory Site—The amino acid residues that are involved in the Zn2+ inhibitory sites on the SOCC are unknown. Previous work on several membrane proteins including the purinergic receptors subunits P2X2 and P2X4 (44Li C. Peoples R.W. Weight F.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 641-653Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), glycine receptor (45Shan Q. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W. J. Biol.

The role of cysteines in Zn2+ inhibition of SOCC was assessed, therefore, under reducing and non-reducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 4a, application of the Zn2+ in the presence of the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol (5 mm) totally eliminated the inhibitory effect of Zn2+. Cadmium is another known inhibitor of the SOCC, although at a much lower affinity than Zn2+, and it also does not permeate cells via this channel (46Olivi L. Bressler J. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similarly to Zn2+, this ion is known to interact with cysteine residues of membrane proteins. Although application of Cd2+, at a concentration range shown previously to inhibit SOCC (14Ebisawa T. Kondo I. Masaki E. Hori S. Kawamura M. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), completely blocked Ca2+ permeation, the addition of β-mercaptoethanol (5 mm) eliminated the SOCC inhibition by Cd2+ (Fig. 4a). A similar effect was observed in the presence of DTT (not shown). This indicates that cysteines, affected by the change in redox potential, are involved in Zn2+ inhibition of the SOCC and that the inhibitory site may also interact with Cd2+. A small degree of permeation by Cd2+ was monitored by Fura-2 fluorescence, and its rate was similar when Cd2+ was applied following the opening of SOCC (Fig. 4a) or when Cd2+ was applied prior to the opening of SOCC (not shown). This Cd2+ flux is known to be mediated by the maitotoxin-sensitive pathway, which is distinct from the SOCC (46Olivi L. Bressler J. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We next asked whether an increase in redox potential may reverse the zinc-mediated block of the SOCC. This is of potential physiological importance, considering the changes in redox potential that are monitored in multiple cell types (47Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7425) Google Scholar). Following the block of SOCC by Zn2+ and Cd2+, application of DTT restored Ca2+ permeation (Fig. 4b). Using this experimental paradigm, we found that as little as 60 μm DTT was sufficient to totally eliminate zinc inhibition of the SOCC. Although Ca2+ permeates strongly in the presence of DTT, no apparent increase in Fura-2 fluorescence was observed when Ca2+ was replaced with zinc, suggesting that DTT treatment does not render SOCC more permeable to zinc (Fig. 4b). Our results, therefore, suggest that the zinc inhibitory site precedes the cation selectivity region on the SOCC. To determine whether redox potential will have an effect on SOCC inhibition by lanthanides, we determined their inhibition potency in the presence and absence of reducing agents. In contrast to the striking effects that reducing conditions had on Zn2+ inhibition, both DTT (Fig. 5a) and β-mercaptoethanol (data not shown) failed to eliminate the inhibition of SOCC by 20 μm La3+ or Gd3+. To address the possibility that DTT is acting by chelating the metal ions, thereby affecting SOCC inhibition, we determined the inhibitory effect of 2 μm La3+ or 1 mm zinc in the presence of 4 mm DTT. As shown in Fig. 5b, La3+ at a minute concentration (2 μm) was still effective in inhibiting SOCC, and the elimination of zinc inhibition by DTT persisted even in the presence of 1 mm Zn2+. Thus, our results indicate that it was the change in the redox potential induced by DTT and β-mercaptoethanol and not the chelation of zinc that eliminated the inhibition of SOCC. The effect of DTT on zinc inhibition of SOCC suggests that the Zn2+ inhibitory site may involve cysteines. Furthermore, the lack of effect on lanthanide inhibition of SOCC following the change in redox potential suggests that the inhibitory sites for Zn2+ and lanthanides are distinct. Changes in Redox Potential Have a Physiological Effect on Agonist-induced Ca2+ Response by Altering the Zn2+ Sensitivity of SOCC—Changes in redox potential play a fundamental physiological and pathophysiological role in salivary secretion (48Nagler R.M. Kitrossky N. Chevion M. Arch. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. 1997; 123: 989-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that redox potential is involved in shaping the agonist-induced calcium response by modulating the zinc inhibitory effect of the SOCC. To test this, we first monitored the Ca2+ response in Fura-2-loaded rat submandibular salivary ducts attached to glass coverslips (Fig. 6a) following depletion of intracellular stores using TG, in the presence and absence of Zn2+ (50 μm). A similar inhibition of SOCC was apparent when stores were depleted using TG or carbachol in ducts (Fig. 6, a and b). This experimental paradigm was also applied to acini and yielded similar results (not shown). We then determined the Ki for the inhibitory effects of Zn2+ in both acini and ducts, by monitoring Ca2+ influx following the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores using TG in the presence of varying zinc concentrations (Fig. 6c). The apparent Ki of both acini and duct was similar. The physiological effect on agonist-induced Ca2+ response in the presence of 50 μm Zn2+, a concentration sufficient to inhibit the SOCC, was next determined. Ducts were superfused with Ca2+ Ringer's solution, and SOCC opening was induced using carbachol (100 μm). As shown in Fig. 6d, application of zinc was followed by a rapid return of Ca2+ to resting levels within 1 min and eliminated the elevated plateau triggered by SOCC. Similar results were obtained using 20 μm La3+ (not shown). In contrast, the addition of zinc in the presence of DTT significantly prolonged the Ca2+ response (to about 3 min) and re-established the elevated plateau, completely reversing the inhibitory effect of zinc. The application of DTT in the absence of zinc did not significantly change the Ca2+ response, indicating that it is not the DTT which modulates the Ca2+ response. These results show that under conditions of increased redox potential, the zinc inhibition of SOCC is totally eliminated, thereby dynamically regulating the profile of the Ca2+ response. Interestingly, the duration of the Ca2+ response in the presence of DTT (in the absence or presence of zinc) was even slightly longer than in the control, suggesting that endogenous zinc is present in a concentration sufficient to partially inhibit the SOCC. The main goal of the present study was to characterize the mechanism by which Zn2+ blocks SOCC. Because of the prominent role of SOCC in shaping the Ca2+ response in exocrine cells following stimulation, we focused on the rat salivary ductal and acinar cells as well as the HSY cell line. We found that Zn2+ inhibits Ca2+ influx through SOCC with an apparent Ki of 0.5–2 ± 0.1 μm in salivary gland and HSY cells, which is well within the concentration of extracellular Zn2+ (27Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that although Zn2+ acts as a competitive inhibitor of Ca2+ influx, it does not permeate through this pathway. An important finding of this work is that Zn2+ inhibition is eliminated by reducing conditions, whereas the inhibition by the lanthanides is not affected, indicating that the SOCC harbors a redox-sensitive Zn2+ inhibitory site that is distinct from the lanthanides site. Zinc and cadmium share similar physico-chemical characteristics, the most notable of which is the interaction with thiolate groups. Indeed, Cd2+ and Zn2+ interact strongly with cysteines of numerous proteins, e.g. metallothioneins (49Hamada T. Tanimoto A. Sasaguri Y. Apoptosis. 1997; 2: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 50Coyle P. Philcox J.C. Carey L.C. Rofe A.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 627-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). The elimination of SOCC inhibition by Zn2+ and Cd2+, under similar reducing conditions, suggests that both metal ions interact with cysteine residues on the SOCC. On the other hand, the striking difference in the affinity of Cd2+ or Zn2+ to the SOCC may indicate that their binding sites do not completely overlap. Resolving this issue will involve the scanning of cysteine mutagenesis along the SOCC followed by affinity analysis of Cd2+ and Zn2+ inhibition. It has been argued that chelation of heavy metals by DTT may play a role in elimination of Zn2+ inhibition by DTT of NMDA channels, rather than a reducing effect on the cysteine residues (51Paoletti P. Ascher P. Neyton J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5711-5725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies on the purinergic receptors (44Li C. Peoples R.W. Weight F.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 641-653Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and on NMDA receptors (17Choi Y. Chen H.V. Lipton S.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 392-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that redox potential regulates the interaction of Zn2+ with cysteines in Zn2+ inhibition of SOCC. Several findings of the present study would appear to lend strong support for a mechanism involving redox regulation of the Zn2+ binding site on SOCC by DTT. First, although DTT may also chelate La3+ and Gd3+, it does not have any effect on the inhibition of SOCC by these metals (Fig. 5a). Second, β-mercaptoethanol, a potentially weaker chelator of Zn2+, eliminated zinc inhibition of SOCC as effectively as DTT (Fig. 4a). Third, application of zinc at widely varying concentrations (i.e. 10–1000 μm), which would have dramatically changed its free concentration, did not attenuate the capacity of DTT to eliminate Zn2+ inhibition (Figs. 4, 5). Also, a range of La3+ concentrations (2–20 μm) in the presence of DTT did not change its effectiveness viz. SOCC inhibition (Fig. 5). Thus, we suggest that the effect of the reducing agents on zinc inhibition is related to a change in redox and is not mediated by zinc chelation. Both characterization of Zn2+ binding sites and insertion of an artificial Zn2+ site into the sequence of membrane proteins are powerful approaches available today to those studying their structure-function aspects (31Hosie A.M. Dunne E.L. Harvey R.J. Smart T.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 52Voss J. Salwinski L. Kaback H.R. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12295-12299Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This may be particularly useful for SOCC since very little is known about domains or residues playing a functional role in ion permeation through this pathway (53Voets T. Nilius B. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To this end, our results can provide a working model, illustrated in Fig. 7, on the nature of the Zn2+ inhibitory site of SOCC. According to our results, Zn2+ acts as a competitive inhibitor of Ca2+ permeation, indicating that the Zn2+ inhibitory site is at, or near, the permeation pathway and is not an allosteric site. In contrast to the LTCC, studies by this (Fig. 3b) and other laboratories (1Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar) indicate that SOCC is impermeable to zinc. Thus, we propose that Zn2+ interacts with an extracellular site, perhaps at a vestibule preceding the cation selectivity domain of SOCC. Zinc is often coordinated in its binding site by cysteines, histidines, or both. Our data, supporting a role for cysteines in the Zn2+ inhibition site (Figs. 4, 5), do not exclude the participation of other residues such as histidines. The properties of the zinc inhibitory site on the SOCC and the CIC chloride channel are similar. On the latter, zinc ions interact with 3 cysteines on the extracellular site of the ion permeation pathway (35Kurz L.L. Klink H. Jakob I. Kuchenbecker M. Benz S. Lehmann-Horn F. Rudel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11687-11692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether there are common structural motives on CIC channel and Trps, related to the zinc inhibitory site. Future studies, combining chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis of susceptible cysteines, will be required for the identification of the residue coordinating Zn2+ to its inhibitory site in the various Trp proteins. Such analysis may be helpful not only in identifying the Zn2+ binding site but also in providing a clue to the specific role played by various Trps in SOCC activity, a question that is still hotly debated (54Voets T. Nilius B. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 192: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The redox-dependent regulation of the SOCC by zinc is a novel functional aspect of this channel. Such regulation may be of particular physiological interest in salivary glands because of the dramatic effects that changes in redox potential trigger there, e.g. after exposure to secretagogues such as isoproterenol (55Barroso A.S. Quissell D.O. Colepicolo P. Arch. Oral Biol. 2003; 48: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 56Schmidt H.W. Herzog V. Miller F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 24: 85-87PubMed Google Scholar). This, together with the pivotal role played by sustained calcium rise in regulating ionic content and pH of salivary secretions (57Carmel Z. Amsallem H. Metioui M. Dehaye J.P. Moran A. Arch. Oral Biol. 1999; 44: S63-S66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 58Dehaye J.P. Moran A. Marino A. Arch. Oral Biol. 1999; 44: S39-S43Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), points toward the potential importance of this novel mode of regulation. Interestingly, although duct and HSG cells express similar Trp proteins, they exhibit altered sensitivity to zinc; the mechanism for this striking difference is not understood (26Liu X. Rojas E. Ambudkar I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C571-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59Chauthaiwale J.V. Lockwich T.P. Ambudkar I.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 162: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A mechanism involving redox potential may provide a plausible explanation.

https://openalex.org/W1967945355,"Activated thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa) is a carboxypeptidase B-like plasma enzyme that can slow clot lysis by removing lysine residues exposed on fibrin as it is cleaved by plasmin. Previously, it was shown that fibrin treated with TAFIa is less able to promote plasminogen activation by tissue-type plasminogen activator. In this study, the effect of TAFIa modification of a fibrin surface on the rate of plasmin inhibition by antiplasmin was studied using high molecular weight fibrin degradation products (HMw-FDPs) as a soluble model for intact plasmin-modified fibrin. To quantify the inhibition, a novel end point assay was employed where plasmin, antiplasmin, and cofactors were mixed in the presence of a chromogenic substrate and the end point in the substrate hydrolysis reaction was used to measure the second order rate constant of inhibition. When HMw-FDPs were titrated in the presence of plasmin and antiplasmin, the rate constant for inhibition decreased by 16-fold at saturation (9.6 × 10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> to 0.59 × 10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>). When HMw-FDPs were pretreated with TAFIa, nearly two-thirds of the protective effect was lost. When 730 nm HMw-FDPs were treated for 20 min with TAFIa, the rate constant for plasmin inhibition was increased 3-fold from 1.9 × 10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> to 6.2 × 10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>. Therefore, a novel mechanism was identified whereby TAFIa can modulate plasmin levels by increasing the susceptibility of plasmin to inhibition by antiplasmin."

The somatic theory of cancer holds that carcinogens are mutagens, at least with regard to what are classically termed tumor initiators (1Bauer K.H. Mutationstheorie der Geschwulstenstehung.

In a general model, cells are initiated by damage resulting from a DNA-alkylating agent, yielding mutations that are fixed by subsequent rounds of replication. Mutation spectra are generally observed when chemical damage to the DNA occurs; i.e. the sites of the mutation are not random and are often characteristic of the DNA-damaging agent (4Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 403-416Google Scholar, 5Rogozin I.B. Pavlov Y.I. Mutat. Res. 2003; 544: 65-85Google Scholar). Sometimes mutant spectra can be measured in tumors (in experimental animals or humans), although the existence of any “hotspots” for mutations does not necessarily indicate that the particular mutation is the cause of the tumor. The biochemical basis for where mutations occur (i.e. the mutant spectrum) is generally not well understood. Mutation resulting from chemical damage to DNA is a multistep process, and the observed mutant spectrum may be the result of events occurring during five or possibly more individual processes: (i) reaction of the chemical with DNA, (ii) further non-enzymatic reactions of the DNA adduct (e.g. opening of the imidazole ring in the case of guanyl-N7 alkyl adducts), (iii) DNA repair (or, more specifically, resistance to repair), (iv) the action of DNA polymerases, and (v) the biological effect of a particular nucleotide/amino acid change in the phenotypic assay used.Ethylene dibromide (1,2-dibromoethane, BrCH2CH2Br) was extensively used as an insecticide, fumigant, and anti-knock agent in leaded gasoline prior to its classification as a carcinogen in the 1970s (6Olson W.A.

Pegg A.E. Williams K.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37920-37928Google Scholar).The GSH half-mustard (GSCH2CH2Cl) forms primarily S-(2-(N7-guanyl)ethyl)GSH adducts (17Koga N. Inskeep P.B. Harris T.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2192-2198Google Scholar, 18Inskeep P.B. Koga N. Cmarik J.L. Guengerich F.P. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2839-2844Google Scholar) and also the minor adducts S-[2-(N2-guanyl)ethyl]GSH, S-[2-(O6-guanyl)ethyl]GSH, and S-[2-(N1-adenyl)ethyl]GSH (12Cmarik J.L. Humphreys W.G. Bruner K.L.

This reactive half-mustard can be synthesized, under anhydrous conditions, and used as a model for GSCH2CH2Br, with similar results in terms of DNA alkylation and mutagenesis (15Humphreys W.G. Kim D.-H. Cmarik J.L. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10342-10350Google Scholar). This mustard was used in some previous work on sequence selectivity with the lacZ gene in a bacteriophage M13mp18/Salmonella typhimurium system. The patterns of both DNA alkylation and mutation were determined in the lacZ sequence. Some similarity between the patterns of highest alkylation and mutation was seen, although the overlap was not particularly strong (12Cmarik J.L. Humphreys W.G. Bruner K.L. Lloyd R.S. Tibbetts C. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6672-6679Google Scholar).These results with the GSH half-mustard can be considered in context of the general question of the role of DNA adduct profiles and their influence on mutation spectra (20Horsfall M.J.

In the case of damage by UV light, a role for differential rates of DNA repair along the gene has been concluded to be a dominant factor in explaining the mutation spectra that appear in human tumors (26Pfeifer G.P. Drouin R. Riggs A.D. Holmquist G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1374-1378Google Scholar, 27Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Science. 1994; 263: 1436-1438Google Scholar, 28Yoon J.H. Lee C.S. O–Connor T.R. Yasui A. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 681-693Google Scholar). With PAHs, the initial sites of DNA modification seem more important and are explained at least partly by C-5 methylation patterns at CpG sites in mammalian systems (29Denissenko M.F. Pao A. Tang M. Pfeifer G.P. Science. 1996; 274: 430-432Google Scholar, 30Smith L.E. Denissenko M.F. Bennett W.P. Li H. Amin S. Tang M. Pfeifer G.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 803-811Google Scholar, 31Yoon J.H.

A. 1995; 92: 3963-3967Google Scholar). This yeast system has been used previously with several physical and chemical agents (35Moshinsky D.J. Wogan G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2266-2271Google Scholar, 36Moshinsky D.J. Wogan G.N. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2000; 35: 31-38Google Scholar, 37Fronza G. Inga A. Monti P. Scott G. Campomenosi P. Menichini P. Ottaggio L. Viaggi S. Burns P.A. Gold B. Abbondandolo A. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 293-301Google Scholar). We developed a variation of an LMPCR method to identify and quantify sites of DNA damage. This mutagen has some advantages, in the context of general questions about sequence selectivity, in that DNA alkylation by GSCH2CH2Cl is largely (but not exclusively) restricted to guanine N7 atoms, in contrast to UV- and PAH-derived DNA modifications.We found differences in the damage patterns for isolated DNA and the same DNA harbored inside of yeast cells. The FLMPCR method also allowed the quantitation of piperidine-labile sites in DNA in cells as a function of time. Our results provide evidence that the mutation sites are highly localized to regions of persistent DNA adducts (i.e. regions of slow repair).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIn Vivo Exposure to S-(2-Chloroethyl)glutathione or ENU–The yDM56p strain uses a double selection for mutant p53 transactivation activity. Both Can1 and Ade2 gene expression are regulated by a p53-responsive promoter. Cells with wild type p53 express the Can1 (arginine permease) gene, resulting in the uptake of canavanine, which is toxic to the cells and limits growth on selective media. Cells with mutant p53 that cannot drive expression of Ade2 accumulate an adenine metabolic intermediate and are red in color.S. cerevisiae yDM56p strain was grown to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.3; 3 × 106 cells/ml) in 250 ml of high adenine complete minimal medium as described (36Moshinsky D.J. Wogan G.N. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2000; 35: 31-38Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with 30 ml of PBS buffer and resuspended in 4 ml of PBS buffer (2 × 108 cells/ml). ENU (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 100 mm as described (38Lee G.S. Blonsky K.S. Van On D.L. Savage E.A. Morgan A.R. von Borstel R.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 617-626Google Scholar). S-(2-Chloroethyl)GSH (GSCH2CH2Cl), synthesized as described (15Humphreys W.G. Kim D.-H. Cmarik J.L. Shimada T. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10342-10350Google Scholar), was freshly dissolved in chilled 0.10 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7, containing 1 mm EDTA) to a final concentration of 1 m and immediately added to yeast cells to a final concentration of 120 mm. In both cases, incubation was at 30 °C for 30 min with shaking. Cells were washed three times with 10 ml of PBS buffer, resuspended in 4 ml of PBS buffer, and diluted in the same buffer. Appropriate dilutions (100 μl, usually 10–4 to 10–6 dilutions) were spread onto high adenine complete minimal medium plates to determine total colony number and on selective plates (low adenine complete minimal medium, containing 0.73 mm canavanine (Ref. 36Moshinsky D.J. Wogan G.N. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2000; 35: 31-38Google Scholar)) to determine the mutant fraction. Incubation was at 30 °C until red colonies appeared (usually 3–4 days).For in vivo adduct detection experiments (see below), yeast cells were exposed to 200 mm GSCH2CH2Cl and DNA was immediately extracted after washing the cells.p53 DNA Preparation–Total DNA from the yDM56p yeast strain was purified using a DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Purified DNA was employed as a template for p53 cDNA amplification (exons 3–10) using the primers P3 and P4 (Operon Technologies, Alameda, CA) and conditions reported by Flaman et al. (34Flaman J.M. Frebourg T. Moreau V. Charbonnier F. Martin C. Chappuis P. Sappino A.P. Limacher I.M. Bron L. Benhattar J. Tada M. van Meir E.G. Estreicher A. Iggo R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3963-3967Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was purified using a High Pure PCR Purification System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and collected with two 30-μl washes of elution buffer.This PCR product was employed either as a template for detection of mutations by the yeast functional assay described by Moshinsky et al. (36Moshinsky D.J. Wogan G.N. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2000; 35: 31-38Google Scholar), for in vivo adduct detection by FLMPCR (after insertion into yeast cells and subsequent modification by GSCH2CH2Cl), or for in vitro exposure to GSCH2CH2Cl, and further detection of adducts as described below.In Vitro Exposure of Isolated p53 cDNA to GSCH2CH2Cl–Samples containing 1.5 μg of purified wild-type p53 PCR product were exposed to GSCH2CH2Cl (0 or 2 mm, final concentrations) in a 100-μl reaction for 20 min at 37 °C. As a positive control, a parallel reaction done with dimethylsulfate (Aldrich) was run for 10 min at 25 °C. Piperidine (Fisher Scientific) was added to give a final concentration of 1 m, as well as 100 μl of Nujol mineral oil (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated for 30 min at 90 °C (39Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Google Scholar, 40Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Google Scholar, 41Kohn K.W. Hartley J.A. Mattes W.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 10531-10549Google Scholar). After piperidine treatment, DNA fragments (a collection of DNA molecules of variable size) were purified using the Roche kit (see above). These fragments served as templates for FLMPCR.FLMPCR–A general scheme of the FLMPCR technique is shown in Fig. 1. Piperidine-treated DNA fragments were used as templates in a first primer extension assay. P3 and P4 primers were employed in separate reactions for adduct detection on the transcribed and on the non-transcribed strands of p53, respectively. This procedure generated a family of variably sized, blunt-ended duplex molecules, which were substrates for T4 DNA ligase-catalyzed addition of an asymmetric linker (42Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Google Scholar). This linker provided each DNA fragment with a common defined end. The bulk of the DNA was then denatured and used as template in a second primer extension reaction with the same oligonucleotides (P3 or P4), so that the extension products included the sequence complementary to the added linker. After each member of the bulk DNA pool had two defined ends, the mixture was used as templates in an exponential PCR reaction (30 cycles) using as primers the largest oligonucleotide of the common linker, and one of four different internal (LA) primers, 5′ end-labeled with 6-FAM (Operon). Primers LA1 (5′-CCCAGAAAACCTACCAGGGCAGCTACGG) and LA2 (5′-CCGAGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAG) were used to localize the adducts on the transcribed strand of p53; primers LA3 (5′-GCCGCCCATGCAGGAACTGTTACACATG) and LA4 (5′-TCATTCAGCTCTCGGAACATCACGAAGCG) were used for adduct detection on the non-transcribed strand. After every step of the FLMPCR assay, the DNA fragments generated were purified using the Roche kit (see above). Finally, an aliquot (1.0%) of the exponential PCR reactions was mixed with appropriate amounts of loading buffer, deionized formamide, and ROX-350-labeled size markers (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), loaded onto an 4% (w/v) acrylamide sequencing gel, and analyzed using an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the Vanderbilt facility.Adduct Quantitation–The GeneScan software of the ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer generated an image of the fluorescent bands in the acrylamide gel. The analysis of this image resulted in a profile (electropherogram) of peaks (the DNA fragments labeled with 6-FAM) and size markers (labeled with ROX-350), and the corresponding tabular display of data indicated the size (in base pairs) and the height (in arbitrary units) of each peak. The position of the peaks relative to the markers in these profiles revealed the nucleotide position where each GSCH2CH2Cl adduct was formed. Furthermore, by calculating the ratio between the heights of a given peak in the GSCH2CH2Cl-treated sample and its equivalent in the negative control, it was possible to establish the relative adduction level of every nucleotide along both p53 strands (exons 5–8).Adduct t½–After in vivo exposure of yDM56p yeast cells to 200 mm GSCH2CH2Cl, washed cells were either processed immediately (time 0) or incubated at 37 °C in 10 ml of YPD broth (43Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995Google Scholar). Cells were collected at 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h and processed for adduct quantification by FLMPCR. From the adduction level data measured at each time point, a repair time course was established for each G nucleotide in exons 5–8 of p53. Adduct t½ (the time at which 50% of the initial damage was removed was then determined from a semi-logarithmic plot, i.e. log10 [adduct] versus t) was determined for every damaged G in both strands in exons 5–8.RESULTSMutagenesis with Alkylating Agents–Experiments were done with S. cerevisiae yDM56p to determine the mutation frequency in the p53 gene induced by two alkylating agents, ENU and GSCH2CH2Cl. Cells were exposed to 100 mm ENU or 120 mm GSCH2CH2Cl as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Survival in nonselective medium at these doses rendered similar results (∼17% survival with respect to non-exposed, control cells). Exposure of yDM56p yeast to ENU produced a 20-fold increase in the induced mutant fraction. However, the mutant fraction resulting from GSCH2CH2Cl treatment was only 2.3-fold higher than the spontaneous fraction (Table I). This increase was less than the 10-fold level previously observed in the M13mp18 bacteriophage study (12Cmarik J.L. Humphreys W.G. Bruner K.L. Lloyd R.S. Tibbetts C. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6672-6679Google Scholar), where the bacterial cells were deficient in nucleotide excision repair. It has been reported that a combined treatment with a given cytotoxic agent and the canavanine present in the selective medium kills a larger proportion of cells than the cytotoxic agent alone (36Moshinsky D.J. Wogan G.N. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2000; 35: 31-38Google Scholar). The present results, therefore, are probably an underestimate of induced mutant fractions.Table ISpontaneous and induced mutant frequencies in yDM56pTreatmentDoseRed/total coloniesMutant fractionNo. of mutants in functional assayNo. of mutants in p53mm%%None02 × 103/2 × 1081 × 10-517/23 (74Wei S.J.C.

Wogan G.N. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2000; 35: 31-38Google Scholar). PCR products that rendered red colonies were considered p53 mutants, whereas those that produced white colonies were presumed to contain mutations outside the p53 region (e.g. in the Ade2 reporter gene). All PCR products from red colonies were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to detect the presence of large insertions and deletions. Two out of 10 (20%) spontaneous red colonies were found to contain large insertions (20 and 70 bp long, determined by further sequencing; Table II). In contrast, only 2 of 32 (6%) ENU-induced clones had large deletions (Table II), and only 1 of 45 (2%) GSCH2CH2Cl-induced red colonies contained a deletion (13 bp, determined by nucleotide sequencing, Table III).Table IISequence alterations in spontaneous and ENU-induced p53 mutantsCloneMutationSequence contextaThe sequence is presented 5′ to 3′ for the strand where the mutated base is a purine.

Open table in a new tab Results of the p53 functional assay are presented in Table I. Of 23 spontaneous red colonies tested, 17 (74%) contained mutant p53, and the sequencing of exons 5–8 revealed that 10 of them (59%) harbored mutations in this region of the gene. Among ENU-induced colonies, 51 of 71 (72%) contained mutant p53 as judged by the functional assay, and 34 (67%) of these had detectable mutations in the DNA binding domain of the gene. Of the GSCH2CH2Cl-induced red colonies, 95 of 133 (71%) were mutants in p53, but only 46 of these 95 (48%) harbored mutations in the central domain of the gene. Spontaneous and ENU-induced mutations found in the sequenced region of the gene are listed in Table II and the GSCH2CH2Cl-induced mutations in Table III. In the spontaneous mutants (in addition to the two large insertions), there were two 2-bp deletions, three transitions, and three transversions. In the ENU- and GSCH2CH2Cl-induced mutants, the vast majority of p53 mutations (78 and 87%, respectively) were G to A transitions. Mutations were observed in a similar number of codons after exposure to ENU and GSCH2CH2Cl (25 and 24, respectively) in the region between the 3′ end of exon 4 and the 5′ end of exon 9.

Aggregation of this receptor by IgE and antigen leads to a signaling cascade resulting in the secretion of histamine, in the synthesis of other pro-inflammatory mediators such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins, and in the production of various cytokines, all of which participate in the development of the allergic reaction. In the last years, growing evidence accumulated that binding of IgEs to FcϵRI in itself induces active signals leading to mast cell survival, increased expression of FcϵRI, transient induction of histidine decarboxylase synthesis, and increased cell adhesion. The mechanisms underlying monomeric IgE signaling in the absence of receptor aggregation are still poorly understood. Here, we show that a protein of 28 kDa (p28) is physically and constitutively associated with FcϵRI in mast cells. Coimmunoprecipitation studies from 125I surface-labeled cells demonstrated that this association involves at least 50% of membrane-expressed FcϵRI. After the addition of monomeric IgE to the cells, the p28·FcϵRI complex dissociates almost completely in less than 2 min. This dissociation is temperature-sensitive and is not due to the recruitment of additional proteins to the complex. Stripping bound IgE from the cells by acidic treatment promotes a rapid reassociation between p28 and FcϵRI. Altogether, these data are consistent with a conformational regulation of the complex. Thus, p28 is a sensor for FcϵRI occupation by IgE on mast cells, and its dissociation from the receptor could represent an early step of monomeric IgE signaling.

Mast cells are now recognized as important players in innate and adaptive immunity (1Mekori Y.A. Metcalfe D.D. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Indeed mast cells have the capacity to phagocytose bacteria (2Malaviya R. Ross E.A. MacGregor J.I. Ikeda T. Little J.R. Jakschik B.A. Abraham S.N. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1907-1914PubMed Google Scholar) and to internalize antigen through fluid phase (3Frandji P. Tkaczyk C. Oskeritzian C. Lapeyre J. Peronet R. David B. Guillet J.G. Mecheri S.

Nature. 1996; 381: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), to migrate to lymph nodes (5Wang H.W. Tedla N. Lloyd A.R. Wakefield D. McNeil P.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and to activate lymphocytes both specifically through antigen presentation and nonspecifically (6Tkaczyk C. Villa I.

Today. 1997; 18: 212-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).In addition to these physiologic roles, mast cells are involved in allergic reactions. They express the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcϵRI), a tetrameric receptor composed of an αβγ2 complex (8Blank U. Ra C. Miller L. White K. Metzger H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1989; 337: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The α chain is responsible for the high affinity binding of IgE (KD = 10–9 to 10–10m), which represents the sensitization step, whereas the β and γ2 subunits are involved in signal transduction (9Nadler M.J. Matthews S.A. Turner H. Kinet J.P. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 76: 325-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aggregation of this receptor by IgE and antigen leads to a signaling cascade that involves kinases, phosphatases, G proteins, and calcium mobilization (9Nadler M.J. Matthews S.A. Turner H. Kinet J.P. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 76: 325-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This results in the secretion of histamine, in the synthesis of other proinflammatory mediators such as leukotrienes and prostaglandins, and in the production of various cytokines, all of which participate in the development of the allergic reaction and of innate inflammatory responses to invading pathogens.Constitutive associations between a fraction of FcϵRI and various signaling molecules have been reported. These signaling effectors include the tyrosine kinases Lyn (10Eiseman E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and Fyn (11Parravicini V. Gadina M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23102-23107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all of which show increased association after receptor aggregation. Other effectors, such as the tyrosine kinase Syk, are recruited to the aggregated and tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor after stimulation (14Benhamou M. Ryba N.J. Kihara H. Nishikata H.

However, in the last years, growing evidence accumulated that binding of IgE to FcϵRI in itself induces active signals leading to increased expression of FcϵRI (18Furuichi K. Rivera J. Isersky C.

Krystal G. Blood. 2003; 102: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved in these signals are poorly understood. Indeed, whereas some authors have reported that monomeric IgEs are capable of inducing significant receptor phosphorylation, synthesis of cytokines, and protection of Bcl-XL from degradation (23Kalesnikoff J. Huber M. Lam V. Damen J.E. Zhang J. Siraganian R.P. Krystal G. Immunity. 2001; 14: 801-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), others found no such signaling events (22Asai K. Kitaura J. Kawakami Y. Yamagata N. Tsai M. Carbone D.P. Liu F.T. Galli S.J. Kawakami T.

Immunity. 2001; 14: 801-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Therefore, the critical question of the mechanisms leading from monomeric IgEs binding to cell activation is still an unresolved controversy.Here, we show that a protein of 28 kDa (p28) is physically and constitutively associated with a majority of membrane-expressed FcϵRI in the absence of IgEs in the RBL-2H3 mast cell line. After binding of monomeric IgEs, p28 dissociates very rapidly from FcϵRI. These data were confirmed in nontumoral rat bone marrow-derived mast cells. Further, we provide indirect evidence that this association/dissociation mechanism is regulated by the conformational state of the receptor. Thus, p28 is a sensor of FcϵRI occupation by IgEs, and its dissociation from the receptor could represent an early step of the monomeric IgE signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—Monoclonal anti-rat phospholipid scramblase (rPLSCR) 1The abbreviations used are: rPLSCR, rat phospholipid scramblase; HBT, Hanks' buffer saline solution supplemented with bovine serum albumin and Tris; IP, immunoprecipitation; IB, immunoblotting; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; IL, interleukin. antibody 129.2, monoclonal anti-rPLSCR and anti-p28 antibody 17.3, and monoclonal anti-FcϵRIβ antibody 30.9 have been produced in the laboratory as described (26Pastorelli C.

For monomeric IgE DNP-48 preparation, IgE was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, filtered, and separated by gel filtration through an S-200 Superdex™ column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to an HPLC ÄKTA-Basic automated liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Murine dinitrophenyl-specific clone 26.82 IgE was kindly provided by Dr. F.-T. Liu (La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, San Diego, CA) (30Liu F.T. Bohn J.W. Ferry E.L. Yamamoto H.

In sensitization experiments, the cells were washed twice in 37 °C Hanks' buffer saline solution supplemented with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (HBT pH 7.2), and incubated at 37 °C in the same medium for the time indicated with or without IgE.For rat bone marrow-derived mast cells, femurs and tibias from Wistar rats (6–13 weeks old) were flushed, and myeloid cells were cultured for 3 weeks in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml recombinant rat IL-3β (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ), 20% fetal calf serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, nonessential amino acids, streptomycin, and penicillin. Over 90% cells were positive for FcϵRI by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis.Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Sensitized or unsensitized cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer per million cells (50 mm HEPES or Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 10 min on ice. Then the cells were scraped, and the soluble cell lysates were recovered after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C.For immunoprecipitation, the cell lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel with the indicated antibodies directly coupled to Sepharose-4B beads prepared following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences) for mAbs 17.3, 129.2, BC4, and 30.9 and for mouse serum IgG. In some instances, effluent proteins were subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation as described above. In all cases after immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed six times in lysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in 10% or 12% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked in 4% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.05% Tween 20. The membranes were then successively probed with the desired primary antibody and an appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody in the same buffer and visualized by enhanced chemoluminescence and exposure to X-Omat films (Eastman Kodak Co.).Dissociation of IgE from RBL-2H3 Cells—Bound IgEs were removed from sensitized RBL-2H3 cells as described before (33Isersky C. Rivera J. Mims S. Triche T.J. J. Immunol. 1979; 122: 1926-1936PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were sensitized as described above. After sensitization, the cells were washed twice in HBT pH 7.2, then washed twice in HBT pH 6.0, washed once more in 50 mm glycine, pH 2.9, containing 150 mm NaCl, and incubated in the same buffer for 4 min. Then the cells were washed again in HBT pH 6.0, followed by HBT pH 7.2. After incubation in HBT pH 7.2 for various time lengths, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in the lysis buffer.Iodine Cell Surface Labeling and Quantification of FcϵRIα—Twenty million RBL-2H3 cells were surface-labeled with Na-125I (1 mCi; Amersham Biosciences) using the lactoperoxidase method. After labeling, the cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitations with mAbs 17.3, BC4, and 30.9 and with irrelevant mouse IgG were performed on lysates from 5 × 106 cells each. After 2 h of immunoprecipitation, the effluents were subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation with mAb BC4-coupled beads to collect the residual FcϵRIα. The first and second immunoprecipitations were washed six times in lysis buffer and eluted by boiling in Laemmli's sample buffer. After resolution by SDS-PAGE, autoradiographies were performed with BioMax MR-1 films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Some gels were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blotted with mAb 30.9, as described above, to examine the presence of FcϵRIβ. After autoradiography, FcϵRIα gel spots were cut, and the radioactivity was counted in a γ counter. For each experimental point, 100% corresponds to the addition of FcϵRIα counts recovered in the two rounds of immunoprecipitations. The percentage of FcϵRIα precipitated in each first round is calculated by comparison with the corresponding 100%.All surface-expressed rat FcϵRIα are associated with FcϵRIβ (8Blank U. Ra C. Miller L. White K. Metzger H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1989; 337: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Therefore, FcϵRIα recovered in anti-FcϵRIβ immunoprecipitation is a marker of the efficiency of co-immunoprecipitation of FcϵRIα with receptor-associated proteins in our stringent experimental conditions. Thus, additional calculations were made taking FcϵRIα co-precipitated with anti-FcϵRIβ as a new 100% to obtain a corrected value for FcϵRIα co-precipitated with mAb 17.3.Statistical Analysis—The results of Fig. 5B were analyzed by independent sample two-tailed Student's test. The results are presented as the means ± S.D. (*, p < 0.003; **, p < 0.0005; NS, not significant).RESULTSFcϵRI Is Constitutively Associated with a 28-kDa Protein—As we described in a previous report, two monoclonal antibodies, 129.2 and 17.3, recognize the rPLSCR (26Pastorelli C.

Phospholipid scramblase activity results in a redistribution of phospholipids between the two leaflets of the plasma membrane when cells are activated or enter apoptosis (34Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 35Williamson P. Schlegel R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The rPLSCR is tyrosine-phosphorylated after FcϵRI engagement (26Pastorelli C. Veiga J. Charles N. Voignier E. Moussu H. Monteiro R.C. Benhamou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20407-20412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Reassessment of the specificity of the anti-rPLSCR antibodies confirmed that both mAbs 129.2 and 17.3 bind the 37-kDa rPLSCR. However, it appeared that mAb 17.3 recognizes by immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunoblotting (IB) an additional protein of 28 kDa (p28) (Fig. 1).Fig. 1p28, but not rPLSCR, is constitutively associated with the FcϵRIγ. Upper panel, lane 1, rPLSCR and p28 immunoprecipitated by mAb 17.3. Lane 2, rPLSCR immunoprecipitated by mAb 129.2.

This experiment is representative of three.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our initial aim was to determine whether rPLSCR was physically associated with FcϵRI. To that end, immunoprecipitations with mAb 17.3 or mAb 129.2 (IP 17.3 or IP 129.2) were carried out on RBL-2H3 cell lysates under stringent conditions (lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS). Immunoblots revealed the presence of the FcϵRIγ chain in mAb 17.3, but not in mAb 129.2, immunoprecipitates. This was not due to direct interaction between mAb 17.3 and FcϵRIγ, because mAb 17.3 did not bind FcϵRIγ by immunoblotting nor immunoprecipitated it when lysates depleted of both p28 and rPLSCR were used (data not shown). These observations indicated that FcϵRIγ was co-precipitated by virtue of an association with either p28 or rPLSCR. To determine which of these two proteins was involved in this interaction, the cell lysates were first depleted of rPLSCR by an IP 129.2. FcϵRIγ was still recovered in 17.3 immunoprecipitates from these depleted lysates (Fig. 1), suggesting an association between p28 and FcϵRI. To confirm this association, the FcϵRI was purified by immunoprecipitation with IgE-coupled beads. p28, but not rPLSCR, was recovered together with FcϵRIγ (Fig. 1) and FcϵRIβ (data not shown) in the immunoprecipitated material. Therefore, p28 is part of a complex that includes FcϵRIγ and FcϵRIβ. In the figures that will follow, although rPLSCR is present in each IP 17.3, it will not be represented to allow for a better comprehension.To examine whether p28 was associated with the complete αβγ2 FcϵRI complex, the membrane proteins of RBL-2H3 cells were radiolabeled with 125I. Immunoprecipitations with mAb 17.3, anti-FcϵRIα chain mAb BC4, anti-FcϵRIβ chain mAb 30.9, and control IgG were performed. Radiolabeled material comigrating with FcϵRIα in SDS-PAGE (as seen with mAb BC4 immunoprecipitates) was recovered together with FcϵRIβ in mAb 17.3 and mAb 30.9, but not IgG, immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2). Therefore, p28 is constitutively associated with membrane-expressed FcϵRI complex. No other radiolabeled protein was detected in the immunoprecipitates. More precisely, no band corresponding to p28 was observed, suggesting that this protein did not contain an extended extracellular domain that could be radiolabeled with iodine and that its association with FcϵRI took place in the transmembrane or in the intracellular compartment. To determine the fraction of FcϵRI that was associated with p28, the effluent of each immunoprecipitation was subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation with anti-FcϵRIα mAb BC4, and the recovered radiolabeled FcϵRIα chain was counted in a γ counter. The total counts recovered in each set of two successive immunoprecipitations were comparable with one another. Calculations indicated that 43% of membrane FcϵRIα had been recovered in mAb 17.3 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2). 77% of FcϵRIα were co-immunoprecipitated with FcϵRIβ. Because every membrane-expressed FcϵRIα chain is associated with FcϵRIβ (8Blank U. Ra C. Miller L. White K. Metzger H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1989; 337: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 9Nadler M.J. Matthews S.A. Turner H. Kinet J.P. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 76: 325-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the latter data show that under our stringent experimental conditions, no more than 77% of the α chain was co-immunoprecipitable with a protein that is constitutively associated with it. Taking this value as the 100% and correcting the data to take into account this parameter, gave an estimate of 54% of membrane FcϵRIα that were associated with p28. Under the same conditions, no FcϵRIα chain was detectable after an IP 129.2 (data not shown), and less than 0.5% was detectable after an IP performed with mouse irrelevant IgG as a negative control (Fig. 2). In another experiment, the calculated percentages of FcϵRIα co-immunoprecipitated with p28 were of 37 and 46%, before and after correction, respectively. Therefore, despite our stringent experimental conditions, nearly 50% of membrane FcϵRI were found to be constitutively associated with p28.Fig. 2More than 50% of the membrane-expressed FcϵRI are associated with p28. A, autoradiography of the surface expressed 125I-iodinated proteins precipitated or co-precipitated with the monoclonal antibodies indicated (lanes 1–3, where BC4 is an anti-FcϵRIα and 30.9, an anti-FcϵRIβ) and with mouse irrelevant polyclonal IgG (lane 4). B, anti-FcϵRIβ immunoblot (mAb 30.9) analysis of the samples analyzed in A. C, effluents of the immunoprecipitations analyzed in A and B were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-FcϵRIα mAb BC4 and resolved in SDS-PAGE, and the gel was autoradiographed.

RBL-2H3 cells were incubated with different concentrations of the monoclonal IgE DNP-48. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), the association between p28 and the FcϵRI was abolished after sensitization with IgE in a dose-dependent manner. At 1 μg/ml of IgE, the association was strongly reduced, and at 10 μg/ml of IgE, the association was barely detectable. An identical dissociation was induced by the anti-FcϵRIα mAb BC4 (data not shown). These data indicate that the association of p28 with the receptor is dependent of the occupation state of the FcϵRI at the cell surface. When RBL-2H3 cells were sensitized with an ascitis dilution titrated to less than 0.5 μg/ml of anti-DNP IgE, no detectable dissociation of the complex was observed (data not shown). Under these conditions, when RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated with antigen (dinitraphenyl-coupled human serum albumin), 80% of β-hexosaminidase were released, and the association remained identical to that observed after or before sensitization alone (data not shown). Therefore, the association between p28 and FcϵRI is not significantly modulated by the IgE-induced activation of the cell. In sensitization time course with 10 μg/ml IgE, the dissociation was detected in less than 30 s and complete within 2 min after the addition of IgE (Fig. 3, C and D). Therefore, this dissociation is an early event following IgE binding to FcϵRI.Fig. 3IgE sensitization of the receptor induces p28·FcϵRI dissociation with a time-and dose-dependent manner. A, dose response of IgE. RBL-2H3 cells were incubated for the indicated time length with increasing concentrations of IgE DNP-48, and proteins in the lysates were immunoprecipitated with mAb 17.3. The presence of p28·FcϵRI complexes was examined by mAb 17.3 (upper panel) and by anti-FcϵRIγ (lower panel) IB. The gel was 12% polyacrylamide. This experiment is representative of three. B, quantification of IgE-induced FcϵRI dissociation from p28. Blots from three dose-response experiments conducted as in A were scanned, and the bands were quantified with National Institutes of Health Image software. The data are the means ± S.D. C, time course of sensitization. RBL-2H3 cells were incubated for various time lengths with the indicated concentrations of IgE DNP-48, and proteins in the lysates were immunoprecipitated with mAb 17.3. The presence of p28·FcϵRI complexes was examined by mAb 17.3 (upper panel) and by anti-FcϵRIγ (lower panel) IB. The gel was 12% polyacrylamide. This experiment is representative of three. D, quantification of IgE-induced FcϵRI dissociation from p28. Blots from three time course experiments conducted as in C were scanned, and the bands were quantified with National Institutes of Health Image software.

https://openalex.org/W1992333361,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 is a highly abundant nuclear enzyme implicated in transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair through binding of nascent RNA and interactions with various factors. We found that purified fractions of recombinant human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> possess yet another activity, a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent DNA supercoil relaxation activity. Cleavage of recombinant poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 by caspase-3, an apoptotic protease, reduced this activity, as did the removal of either of the two zinc finger motifs located in the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1. In addition, this activity was separated from <i>E. coli</i> topoisomerase I by gel-filtration column chromatography, suggesting that this activity is specifically associated with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1. Because this relaxation activity did not require ATP and was resistant to VP16, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, this activity is closer to that of topoisomerase I. However, the supercoiled DNA relaxation activity associated with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 is distinct from that of human or <i>E. coli</i> topoisomerase I, as this activity could not completely remove superhelical tensions from plasmid DNA. Thus, we referred to this activity as topoisomerase I-like activity. This Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent DNA supercoil relaxation activity was found to be sensitive to camptothecin, a mammalian topoisomerase I inhibitor."
