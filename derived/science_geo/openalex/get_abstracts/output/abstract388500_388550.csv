https://openalex.org/W2062796550,"The antibacterial activity of streptomycin in infusion agar plate cultures of E. coli and other bacteria is diminished by anaerobic incubation. The bacteriostatic activity of this antibiotic for E. coli is reduced in the presence of cysteine, sodium thioglycollate, stannous chloride, sodium bisulfite, sodium hydrosulfite, sodium formate, and sodium thiosulfate. Cysteine was the most active of the agents tested. Further investigation is necessary to determine the nature of this interference. It is possible that this phenomenon is related to the mode of action of streptomycin."

Reactions, consisting of fever, arthralgias, and skin rashes as well as histamine-like effects, are believed to be due to impurities retained in the preparations of streptomycin employed in these studies."
https://openalex.org/W1964066519,"IN connexion with our work1 on antibiotics against Mycobact. tubercul. the need of a rapid standardization method led us to try the Warburg technique for measuring the oxygen consumption. This method has been generally used for similar investigations on faster growing bacteria. We have found the method very satisfactory with Mycobact. tubercul. if a large amount of bacteria (1.5-6 mgm. wet weight) is used in each vessel. The slow growth of these bacteria seems to have discouraged previous workers on antituberculous substances from using this method. However, it has been shown that the oxygen consumption of Mycobact. tubercul. is conveniently measurable with the Warburg technique2,3."

Thirty of the sera (85 per cent) inhibited Bacillus subtilis in dilutions varying up to 1:32, but in no instance was Staphylococcus aureus inhibited. The data presented would indicate that Bacillus subtilis is not a suitable organism for use in the assay of antibiotics in the presence of serum."

https://openalex.org/W2008259709,"Like pantothenic acid, pantolactone, and the pantoate ion, pantoyltaurine and other pantothenic acid analogues of this type antagonize the inhibitory effect of salicylate on E. coli. It is suggested that the active antagonist in a solution of such an analogue is pantolactone or pantoate. These (particularly the former) could conceivably be contaminants of the analogues. However, the liberation of pantoate by hydrolysis, appears to be a more likely explanation for the antisalicylate effect. The presence of pantolactone or pantoate in a solution of pantoyltaurine and similar analogues of pantothenic acid provides a possible explanation for the ineffectiveness of these drugs in inhibiting the growth of microorganisms which can utilize pantolactone or pantoate for the synthesis of pantothenic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2007555010,"IN July last Dr. H. W. Howard forwarded to me a specimen of Armadillidium vulgare (Latreille) in which he pointed out that the styles were very small, On examination, this was confirmed, and I also noted that the oostegites had commenced to form. The specimen was carefully watched for eleven weeks, when it died ; no further development had taken place. On examining the specimen internally, I found that the two ovaries were present, but only about half the size of those normally present. The two oviducts were quite normal. Moreover, on the animal's right side there was a duct, which opened on to the first appendage of the metasome, but no trace of testes. The anterior portion of this duct was slightly wider (vesicular semmalis) than the longer posterior half (vas deferens). Legrand1 has described a case in this same species."
https://openalex.org/W2017331893,"THE discovery of the elements 95 and 96 was announced on November 16, 1945, by Prof. G. T. Seaborg, of the University of California, now working at the 'Metallurgical Laboratory' of Chicago University (Ind. and Eng. Chem., News Edition, 2085 and 2190 ; 1945). Isotopes of the two elements-as yet nameless, apparently owing to lack of 'transplutonic' planets-have been produced by bombarding uranium 238 and plutonium 239 with 40 MeV. a-particles in the Berkeley. 60-inch cyclotron. Enough material has been made for chemical studies by tracer technique in the way in which the properties of element 93 (neptunium ; Np) and 94 (plutonium ; Pu) were first investigated in 1940. Nuclear properties of the new elements, including action of neutrons on them, are not discussed in the lecture."
https://openalex.org/W2069571341,"Dr. Clement Webb and Prof. Bernard Cohen discuss in Nature of February 16, p. 196, the origins of two anecdotes associated with Faraday's demonstration of magneto-electricity mentioned in my book “Discovery”, published in 1916. In correspondence with Sir Henry Tizard a short time ago, I suggested that Faraday was aware of Franklin's apt reply, “What is the use of a new-born child?” when asked the use of an invention, and he quoted it in connexion with his own discovery when asked a similar question. In my book, the inquiry was said to have been made at the end of a lecture at the Royal Institution whereas, as Prof. Cohen shows, the occasion was a lecture at the City Philosophical Society and the subject was not magneto-electricity but the discovery of chlorine by Scheele."
