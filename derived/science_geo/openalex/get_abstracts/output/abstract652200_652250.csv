https://openalex.org/W3022655122,"It is now common practice for video game companies to not just sell copies of games themselves, but to also sell in-game bonuses or items for a small real-world fee. These purchases may be purely aesthetic (cosmetic microtransactions) or confer in-game advantages (pay to win microtransactions), and may also contain these items as randomised contents of uncertain value (loot boxes). The growth of microtransactions has attracted substantial interest from both gamers, academics, and policymakers. However, it is not clear either how frequently exposed players are to these features in desktop games, or when any growth in exposure occurred. In order to address this, we analysed the play history of the 463 most-played Steam desktop games from 2010 to 2019. Results of exploratory joinpoint analyses suggested that cosmetic microtransactions and loot boxes experienced rapid growth during 2012-2014, leading to high levels of exposure by April 2019: 71.2% of the sample played games with loot boxes at this point, and 85.89% played games with cosmetic microtransactions. By contrast, pay to win microtransactions did not appear to experience similar growth in desktop games during the period, rising gradually to an exposure rate of 17.3% by November 2015, at which point growth decelerated significantly (p<0.001) to the point where it was not significantly different from zero (p = 0.32)."
https://openalex.org/W3022574897,"Malnutrition linked to noncommunicable diseases presents major health problems across Europe. The World Health Organisation encourages countries to conduct national dietary surveys to obtain data to inform public health policies designed to prevent noncommunicable diseases.Data on 27334 participants aged 19-64y were harmonised and pooled across national dietary survey datasets from 12 countries across the WHO European Region. Weighted mean nutrient intakes were age-standardised using the Eurostat 2013 European Standard Population. Associations between country-level Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and key nutrients and nutrient densities were investigated using linear regression. The potential mitigating influence of participant-level educational status was explored.Higher GDP was positively associated with total sugar intake (5·0% energy for each 10% increase in GDP, 95% CI 0·6, 9·3). Scandinavian countries had the highest vitamin D intakes. Participants with higher educational status had better nutritional intakes, particularly within lower GDP countries. A 10% higher GDP was associated with lower total fat intakes (-0·2% energy, 95% CI -0·3, -0·1) and higher daily total folate intakes (14μg, 95% CI 12, 16) in higher educated individuals.Lower income countries and lower education groups had poorer diet, particularly for micronutrients. We demonstrate for the first time that higher educational status appeared to have a mitigating effect on poorer diet in lower income countries. It illustrates the feasibility and value of harmonising national dietary survey data to inform European policy regarding access to healthy diets, particularly in disadvantaged groups. It specifically highlights the need for strong policies supporting nutritional intakes, prioritising lower education groups and lower income countries."
https://openalex.org/W3023977080,"Although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) for all young children, disparities in ASD diagnosis and intervention in minority children persist. One potential contributor to disparities could be whether physicians take different actions after an initial positive screen based on patient demographics. This study estimated factors associated with physicians completing the follow-up interview for the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers with Follow-up (M-CHAT-F), and referring children to diagnostic services, audiology, and Early Intervention (EI) immediately after a positive screen.Children seen in a large primary care network that has implemented universal ASD screening were included if they screened positive on the M-CHAT parent questionnaire during a 16-30 month well child visit (N = 2882). Demographics, screening results, and referrals were extracted from the electronic health record.Children from lower-income families or on public insurance were more likely to have been administered the follow-up interview. Among children who screened positive, 26% were already in EI, 31% were newly referred to EI, 11% were referred each to audiology and for comprehensive ASD evaluation. 40.2% received at least one recommended referral; 3.7% received all recommended referrals. In adjusted multivariable models, male sex, white versus black race, living in an English-speaking household, and having public insurance were associated with new EI referral. Male sex, black versus white race, and lower household income were associated with referral to audiology. Being from an English-speaking family, white versus Asian race, and lower household income were associated with referral for ASD evaluation. A concurrent positive screen for general developmental concerns was associated with each referral.We found low rates of follow-up interview completion and referral after positive ASD screen, with variations in referral by sex, language, socio-economic status, and race. Understanding pediatrician decision-making about ASD screening is critical to improving care and reducing disparities."
https://openalex.org/W3022670484,"Geographical variation may likely influence the effectiveness of prevention efforts for malaria across Indonesia, in addition to factors at the individual level, household level, and contextual factors. This study aimed to describe preventive practices at individual and a household levels applied by rural communities in five provinces in eastern Indonesia and its association with the incidence of malaria among adult (≥15 years) populations.This study analyzed a subset of data of nationally representative community-based survey 2018 Riset Kesehatan Dasar (Riskesdas). Data for socio-demographic (age, gender, education and occupation) and preventive behaviors (use of mosquito bed nets while slept, insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs), mosquito repellent, mosquito electric rackets, mosquito coil/electric anti-mosquito mats, and mosquito window screen) were collected. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression model.Total of 56,159 respondents (n = 23,070 households) living in rural areas in Maluku (n = 8044), North Maluku (n = 7356), East Nusa Tenggara (n = 23,254), West Papua (n = 5759) and Papua (n = 11,746) were included in the study. In the multivariable models, using a bed net while slept likely reduced the odds of self-reported malaria among Maluku participants. Reduced odds ratios of self-reported malaria were identified in those participants who used ITNs (North Maluku, ENT, Papua), repellent (Maluku, West Papua, Papua), anti-mosquito racket (ENT), coil (Maluku, North Maluku, Papua) and window screen (West Papua, Papua).Our study concluded that the protective effects of preventive practices were varied among localities, suggesting the need for specific intervention programs."
https://openalex.org/W3022269645,"Obesity is a constantly increasing health problem worldwide. It is associated with a systemic low-grade inflammation, which contributes to the development of metabolic disorders and comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes. Diet has an important role in the prevention of obesity and its adverse health effects; as a part of healthy diet, polyphenol-rich berries, such as lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.) have been proposed to have health-promoting effects. In the present study, we investigated the effects of lingonberry supplementation on high-fat diet induced metabolic and inflammatory changes in a mouse model of obesity. Thirty male C57BL/6N mice were divided into three groups (n = 10/group) to receive low-fat (LF), high-fat (HF) and lingonberry-supplemented high-fat (HF+LGB) diet for six weeks. Low-fat and high-fat diet contained 10% and 46% of energy from fat, respectively. Lingonberry supplementation prevented the high-fat diet induced adverse changes in blood cholesterol and glucose levels and had a moderate effect on the weight and visceral fat gain, which were 26% and 25% lower, respectively, in the lingonberry group than in the high-fat diet control group. Interestingly, lingonberry supplementation also restrained the high-fat diet induced increases in the circulating levels of the proinflammatory adipocytokine leptin (by 36%) and the inflammatory acute phase reactant serum amyloid A (SAA; by 85%). Similar beneficial effects were discovered in the hepatic expression of the inflammatory factors CXCL-14, S100A10 and SAA by lingonberry supplementation. In conclusion, the present results indicate that lingonberry supplementation significantly prevents high-fat diet induced metabolic and inflammatory changes in a murine model of obesity. The results encourage evaluation of lingonberries as a part of healthy diet against obesity and its comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W3022994147,"Cytokinin is an indispensable phytohormone responsible for physiological processes ranging from root development to leaf senescence. The term “cytokinin” refers to several dozen adenine-derived compounds occurring naturally in plants. Cytokinins (CKs) can be divided into various classes and forms; base forms are generally considered to be active while highly abundant cytokinin-N-glucosides (CKNGs), composed of a CK base irreversibly conjugated to a glucose molecule, are considered inactive. However, results from early CK studies suggest CKNGs do not always lack activity despite the perpetuation over several decades in the literature that they are inactive. Here we show that exogenous application of trans-Zeatin-N-glucosides (tZNGs, a specific class of CKNGs) to Arabidopsis results in CK response comparable to the application of an active CK base. These results are most apparent in senescence assays where both a CK base (tZ) and tZNGs (tZ7G, tZ9G) delay senescence in cotyledons. Further experiments involving root growth and shoot regeneration revealed tZNGs do not always have the same effects as tZ, and have largely distinct effects on the transcriptome and proteome. These data are in contrast to previous reports of CKNGs being inactive and raise questions about the function of these compounds as well as their mechanism of action."
https://openalex.org/W3021931749,"For an antibody to be a successful therapeutic many competing factors require optimization, including binding affinity, biophysical characteristics, and immunogenicity risk. Additional constraints may arise from the need to formulate antibodies at high concentrations (>150 mg/ml) to enable subcutaneous dosing with reasonable volume (ideally <1.0 mL). Unfortunately, antibodies at high concentrations may exhibit high viscosities that place impractical constraints (such as multiple injections or large needle diameters) on delivery and impede efficient manufacturing. Here we describe the optimization of an anti-PDGF-BB antibody to reduce viscosity, enabling an increase in the formulated concentration from 80 mg/ml to greater than 160 mg/ml, while maintaining the binding affinity. We performed two rounds of structure guided rational design to optimize the surface electrostatic properties. Analysis of this set demonstrated that a net-positive charge change, and disruption of negative charge patches were associated with decreased viscosity, but the effect was greatly dependent on the local surface environment. Our work here provides a comprehensive study exploring a wide sampling of charge-changes in the Fv and CDR regions along with targeting multiple negative charge patches. In total, we generated viscosity measurements for 40 unique antibody variants with full sequence information which provides a significantly larger and more complete dataset than has previously been reported."
https://openalex.org/W3021213516,"Trust is a key ingredient of almost all market interactions. Much of the literature on the relationship between trust and market activity, however, has focused on how trust facilitates market activity rather than on how market activity affects trust. In this study, however, we investigate whether market interactions can affect the subsequent trusting and reciprocating behavior of former trading partners. Additionally, we explore the effect of personal and impersonal exchange on the trusting and reciprocating behavior of former trading partners. We find experimental evidence that suggests that positive and negative market interactions can affect such behavior. Further, we find that past market dealings only affect the trusting and reciprocating behavior of subjects who participated in an experimental market where exchanges were more personal, but did not affect trust and reciprocity between trading partners who participated in an experimental market where exchanges were more impersonal. In the market where exchanges are more personal, people exhibit higher levels of trust and reciprocity to trading partners with whom they have mostly positive market interactions than with whom they have mostly negative market interactions. However, in the market where exchanges are more impersonal, people exhibit the same levels of trust and reciprocity to trading partners regardless of the nature of their previous market interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3021574974,"Pectus excavatum is the most common chest wall skeletal deformity. Although commonly evaluated in adolescence, its prevalence in adults is unknown.Radiographic indices of chest wall shape were analyzed for participants of the first (n = 2687) and second (n = 1780) phases of the population-based Dallas Heart Study and compared to clinical cases of pectus (n = 297). Thoracic computed tomography imaging studies were examined to calculate the Haller index, a measure of thoracic axial shape, and the Correction index, which quantitates the posterior displacement of the sternum relative to the ribs. At the level of the superior xiphoid, 0.5%, 5% and 0.4% of adult Dallas Heart Study subjects have evidence of pectus excavatum using thresholds of Haller index >3.25, Correction index >10%, or both, respectively. Radiographic measures of pectus are more common in females than males and there is a greater prevalence of pectus in women than men. In the general population, the Haller and Correction indices are associated with height and weight, independent of age, gender, and ethnicity. Repeat imaging of a subset of subjects (n = 992) demonstrated decreases in the mean Haller and Correction indices over seven years, suggesting change to a more circular axial thorax, with less sternal depression, over time.To our knowledge, this is the first study estimating the prevalence of pectus in an unselected adult population. Despite the higher reported prevalence of pectus cases in adolescent boys, this study demonstrates a higher prevalence of radiographic indices of pectus in adult females."
https://openalex.org/W3023894157,"Exosomes are 40-100 nm nano-sized extracellular vesicles. They are released from many cell types and move into the extracellular space, thereby transferring their components to recipient cells. Exosomes are receiving increasing attention as novel structures participating in intracellular communication. RAB27B is one of the leading proteins involved in exosome secretion, and oncogenic effects have been reported in several cancers. In recent years, molecularly targeted agents typified by sunitinib are widely used for the treatment of metastatic or recurrent renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, intrinsic or acquired resistance to sunitinib has become a major issue. The present study aimed to elucidate the role of RAB27B in RCC including sunitinib-resistant and its role in exosomes. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that high expression of RAB27B correlates with progression of RCC. The expression of RAB27B protein in RCC cell lines was significantly enhanced compared with that in normal kidney cell lines. Furthermore, RAB27B protein expression was enhanced in all of the tested sunitinib-resistant RCC cell lines compared to parental cells. Although no specific effect of RAB27B on exosomes was identified in RCC cells, loss-of-function studies demonstrated that knockdown of RAB27B suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasive activities. Moreover, anti-tumor effects of RAB27B downregulation were also observed in sunitinib-resistant RCC cells. RNA sequence and pathway analysis suggested that the oncogenic effects of RAB27B might be associated with MAPK and VEGF signaling pathways. These results showed that RAB27B is a prognostic marker and a novel therapeutic target in sunitinib-sensitive and -resistant RCCs. Further analyses should improve our understanding of sunitinib resistance in RCC."
https://openalex.org/W3021582099,"Analyzing cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a source of circulating tumor DNA is useful for diagnosing or monitoring patients with cancer. However, the concordance between cfDNA within liquid biopsy and genomic DNA (gDNA) within tumor tissue biopsy is still under debate. To evaluate the concordance in a clinical setting, we enrolled 54 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and analyzed their plasma cfDNA, gDNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and gDNA from available matched tumor tissues using ultra-deep sequencing targeting 10 genes (38-kb size) recurrently mutated in colorectal cancer. We first established a highly reliable cut-off value using reference material. The sensitivity of detecting KRAS hotspot mutations in plasma was calculated as 100%, according to digital droplet PCR. We could selectively detect clinically important somatic alterations with a variant allele frequency as low as 0.18%. We next compared somatic mutations of the 10 genes between cfDNA and genomic DNA from tumor tissues and observed an overall 93% concordance rate between the two types of samples. Additionally, the concordance rate of patients with the time interval between liquid biopsy and tumor tissue biopsy within 6 months and no prior exposure to chemotherapy was much higher than those without. The patients with KRAS mutant fragments in plasma had poor prognosis than those without the mutant fragments (33 months vs. 63 months; p<0.05). Consequently, the profiling with our method could achieve highly concordant results and may facilitate the surveillance of the tumor status with liquid biopsy in CRC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3020854777,"Pulse wave attenuation characteristics reflect compliance and resistance properties of the vessel wall as well as initial pulse generation factors. Recently, it has become possible to measure and map the retinal vessel wall pulse wave amplitudes. Predictable pulse wave amplitude distribution may allow inferences to be made concerning vascular compliance and resistance. Twenty-eight eyes from sixteen subjects (8 male and 8 female) were examined using modified retinal photoplethysmography with simultaneous ophthalmodynamometry. This allowed the assessment of vessel wall pulsation amplitudes under a dynamic range of intraocular pressures. Pulse amplitudes were calculated using harmonic regression analysis. The pulse wave attenuation was measured under different ranges of ophthalmodynamometric force (ODF) as a function of distance along the vessel (VDist), which in turn was calculated in disc diameters (DD) from the center of the optic disc. A linear mixed-effects model with randomized slopes and intercepts was used to estimate the correlations between the logarithmically transformed harmonic regression wave amplitude (HRWa) and the Fourier trigonometric coefficients with the predictors (VDist and ODF). The retinal venous harmonic regression wave attenuation (coefficient value±standard error) -0.40±0.065/DD, (p-value < 0.00001, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.53 to -0.27), which was approximately twice that of the arterial -0.17±0.048/DD, (p-value < 0.0004, 95% CI = -0.27 to -0.08). There was a positive correlation between attenuation of the harmonic regression wave and ophthalmodynamometric force in both vascular systems. The attenuation of all but the sine coefficient of the second Fourier harmonic (bn2) achieved statistical significance in the correlation with VDist. The cosine coefficient of the first Fourier harmonic an1 was the only coefficient to achieve statistical significance in the correlation with the predictors VDist and ODF in both vascular systems. The an1 coefficient value in the correlation with VDist was -3.79±0.78 and -1.269±0.37 (p < 0.0006), while this coefficient value in the correlation with ODF was 0.026±0.0099 and 0.009±0.04 (p < 0.01) in both the retinal veins and arteries respectively. The predictable attenuation characteristics in normal subjects suggest that this technique may allow the non-invasive quantification of retinal vascular compliance and other hemodynamic parameters."
https://openalex.org/W3021835304,"Background In China, the disease burden of cervical cancer remains substantial. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are expensive and not yet centrally funded. To inform immunization policy, understanding the economic burden of the disease is necessary. This study adopted a societal perspective and investigated costs and quality of life changes associated with cervical cancer from diagnosis to one year after final discharge in Henan province, China. Methods Inpatient records of cervical cancer patients admitted to the largest cancer hospital in Henan province between Jan. 2017 and Dec. 2018 were extracted. A telephone interview with four modules was conducted in Jun.-Jul. 2019 with a 40% random draw of patients to obtain direct non-medical costs and indirect costs associated with inpatients, costs associated with outpatient visits, and changes in quality of life status using the EQ-5D-5L instrument. Direct medical expenditures were converted to opportunity costs of care using cost-to-charge ratios obtained from hospital financial reports. For each clinical stage (IA-IV), total costs per case from diagnosis to one year after final discharge were extrapolated based on inpatient records, responses to the telephone interview, and recommendation on outpatient follow-ups by Chinese cervical cancer treatment guidelines. Loss in quality-adjusted life years was obtained using the ‘under the curve’ method and regression predictions. Results A total of 3,506 inpatient records from 1,323 patients were obtained. Among 541 randomly selected patients, 309 completed at least one module of the telephone interview. The average total costs per case associated with cervical cancer from diagnosis to one year after final discharge ranged from $8,066-$22,888 (in 2018 US Dollar) and the quality-adjusted life years loss varied from 0.05–0.26 for IA-IV patients. Conclusions The economic burden associated with cervical cancer is substantial in Henan province. Our study provided important baseline information for cost-effectiveness analysis of HPV immunization program in China."
https://openalex.org/W3023711770,"Bemisia tabaci (sensu latu) is a group of >40 highly cryptic whitefly species that are of global agricultural importance, both as crop pests and plant-virus vectors. Two devastating cassava diseases in East and Central Africa are spread by abundant populations of one of these species termed Sub-Saharan Africa 1 (SSA1). There is a substantive risk that these whitefly-borne pandemics will continue to spread westwards and disrupt cassava production for millions of smallholder farmers in West Africa. We report here, therefore, the first comprehensive survey of cassava B. tabaci in eastern Nigeria, a West African region likely to be the first affected by the arrival of these whitefly-borne pandemics. We found one haplotype comprising 32 individuals with 100% identical mtCO1 sequence to the East African SSA1 populations (previously termed SSA1-SG1) and 19 mtCO1 haplotypes of Sub-Saharan Africa 3 (SSA3), the latter being the most prevalent and widely distributed B. tabaci species in eastern Nigeria. A more divergent SSA1 mtCO1 sequence (previously termed SSA1-SG5) was also identified in the region, as were mtCO1 sequences identifying the presence of the MED ASL B. tabaci species and Bemisia afer. Although B. tabaci SSA1 was found in eastern Nigeria, they were not present in the high abundances associated with the cassava mosaic (CMD) and cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) pandemics of East and Central Africa. Also, no severe CMD or any CBSD symptoms were found in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3021191305,"Introduction Ethnobotanical studies that include participatory methods aim to engage residents in different steps to promote the strengthening and perpetuation of local culture, and empowerment in making decisions about the use of available environmental resources. Thus, the aim of this project was to perform an ethnobotanical survey based on traditional knowledge of medicinal plants with the active participation of residents living in Bairro do Cambury, Ubatuba, São Paulo State, Brazil. Materials and methods During meetings held between the researchers and community members, locally used plants were regarded as an important means for preserving local knowledge for future generations. Some residents showed interest in participating as local partners, and training courses for collecting ethnobotanical data were offered. Local partners and researchers from São Paulo Federal University (Universidade Federal de São Paulo) utilized ethnobotanical methods to select and interview the specialists in medicinal plants for 80 days between 2016 and 2018. Data on plant use were recorded, and plants were collected and deposited in two herbaria. Furthermore, participant observation and fieldwork diaries were used by the researchers, aiding the data analysis. Results Three local partners participated in objective definitions, data collection, analysis and publication. Nine local specialists were interviewed by the local partners and indicated the use of 82 plant species in 90 recipes for 55 therapeutic uses. These uses were grouped into 12 categories. In addition, a video and booklet were created. Conclusions Data obtained during participatory research show that training local communities in the registration of their own knowledge is feasible and necessary since they register knowledge based on local perceptions, as well as valuing knowledge and approaching the current discussion about intellectual property is a global concern."
https://openalex.org/W3022341458,"Smoking is a potentially causal behavioral risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D), but not all smokers develop T2D. It is unknown whether genetic factors partially explain this variation. We performed genome-environment-wide interaction studies to identify loci exhibiting potential interaction with baseline smoking status (ever vs. never) on incident T2D and fasting glucose (FG). Analyses were performed in participants of European (EA) and African ancestry (AA) separately. Discovery analyses were conducted using genotype data from the 50,000-single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) ITMAT-Broad-CARe (IBC) array in 5 cohorts from from the Candidate Gene Association Resource Consortium (n = 23,189). Replication was performed in up to 16 studies from the Cohorts for Heart Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium (n = 74,584). In meta-analysis of discovery and replication estimates, 5 SNPs met at least one criterion for potential interaction with smoking on incident T2D at p<1x10-7 (adjusted for multiple hypothesis-testing with the IBC array). Two SNPs had significant joint effects in the overall model and significant main effects only in one smoking stratum: rs140637 (FBN1) in AA individuals had a significant main effect only among smokers, and rs1444261 (closest gene C2orf63) in EA individuals had a significant main effect only among nonsmokers. Three additional SNPs were identified as having potential interaction by exhibiting a significant main effects only in smokers: rs1801232 (CUBN) in AA individuals, rs12243326 (TCF7L2) in EA individuals, and rs4132670 (TCF7L2) in EA individuals. No SNP met significance for potential interaction with smoking on baseline FG. The identification of these loci provides evidence for genetic interactions with smoking exposure that may explain some of the heterogeneity in the association between smoking and T2D."
https://openalex.org/W3022473528,"Background The proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (HBMScs) are modulated by a variety of microRNAs (miRNAs). SATB homeobox 2 (SATB2) is a critical transcription factor that contributes to maintain the balance of bone metabolism. However, it remains unclear how the regulatory relationship between miR-103 and SATB2 on HBMScs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. Methods HBMScs were obtained from Cyagen Biosciences and successful induced osteogenic differentiation. The proliferation abilities of HBMScs after treatment with agomiR-103 and antagomiR-103 were assessed using a cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and osteogenic differentiation was determined using alizarin red S staining and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay. The expression levels of miR-103, SATB2, and associated osteogenic differentiation biomarkers, including RUNX family transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein (BGLAP), and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), were evaluated using real-time qPCR and Western blot. The regulatory sites of miR-103 on SATB2 were predicted using bioinformatics software and validated using a dual luciferase reporter assay. The underlying mechanism of miR-103 on SATB2-medicated HBMScs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were confirmed by co-transfection of antagomiR-103 and SATB2 siRNA. Results The expression of miR-103 in HBMScs after induction of osteogenic differentiation was reduced in a time-dependent way. Overexpression of miR-103 by transfection of agomiR-103 suppressed HBMScs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation, while silencing of miR-103 by antagomiR-103 abolished these inhibitory effects. Consistently, RUNX2, BGLAP and SPP1 mRNA and protein expression were decreased in agomiR-103 treated HBMScs compared with those in agomiR-NC group. Meanwhile, antagomiR-103 upregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of RUNX2, BGLAP and SPP1 in HBMScs. Further studies revealed that SATB2 was a direct target gene of miR-103. BMSCs transfected with agomiR-103 exhibited significantly downregulated protein expression level of SATB2, whereas knockdown of miR-103 promoted it. Additionally, rescue assays confirmed that silencing of SATB2 partially reversed the effects of antagomiR-103 induced HBMScs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. Conclusions The present results suggested that miR-103 negatively regulates SATB2 to serve an inhibitory role in the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of HBMScs, which sheds light upon a potential therapeutic target for treating bone-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3022556466,"Insomnia has been associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk, which may be linked to sympathetic activation. Non-invasive overnight pulse wave analysis may be a useful tool to detect early signs of autonomic changes during sleep in insomniacs. Fifty-two participants (26 men, 37±13 years, BMI: 24±5 kg/m2, 26 insomniacs/ 26 controls) underwent overnight polysomnography with pulse oximetry and pulse wave analysis including pulse rate, vascular stiffness (pulse propagation time, PPT), and a composite cardiac risk index based on autonomic function and overnight hypoxia. We identified two subgroups of insomniacs, with and without objectively disturbed sleep (sleep efficiency SE≤80%, n = 14 vs. SE>80%, n = 12), and observed increased pulse rate and vascular stiffness in insomnia cases when diagnosis was based on both, subjective and objective criteria. Both insomnia groups were associated with higher overnight pulse rate than controls (median/ IQR: low-SE (low sleep efficiency): 67/ 58-70bpm; high-SE: 66/ 63-69bpm; controls: 58/ 52-63bpm; p = 0.01). Vascular stiffness was higher (reduction of PPT) in low-SE insomniacs compared with high-SE insomniacs and controls (169/ 147-232ms; 237/ 215-254ms; 244/ 180-284ms; p = 0.01). The cardiac risk index was increased in low-SE insomniacs (0.2/ 0.0-0.7; 0.0/ 0.0-0.4; 0.0/ 0.0-0.3; p = 0.05). Our results suggest a hyperarousal state in young and otherwise healthy insomniacs during sleep. The increased pulse rate and vascular stiffness in insomniacs with low SE suggest early signs of rigid vessels and potentially, an elevated CV risk. Overnight pulse wave analysis may be feasible for CV risk assessment in insomniacs and may provide a useful tool for phenotyping insomnia in order to provide individualized therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3023071799,"Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa pregnant women. HBV Infection has high tendency of vertical transmission and have adverse effect on both the mother and child. However, there is no evidence on prevalence of hepatitis B virus among pregnant women in Wolaita Zone. Therefore, this study aims to determine prevalence and associated factors of hepatitis B virus infection among pregnant attending Antenatal clinics of public Hospitals of Wolaita Zone. Method An institution based cross sectional study was conducted among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics of Wolaita Zone from October—November, 2018. Systematic random sampling was used to get respondents. A pretested, structured questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic characteristics and other variables. In addition, 5 ml of venous blood was collected from each study participants and serum was tested for Hepatitis B surface antigen. Data was entered to Epidata 3.1 version and exported Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 20.0 for descriptive and logistic regression analysis. All variables in bivariate analysis with p<0.25 were taken to multivariable analysis. P-value and Odds ratio with 95% CI was used to measure the presence and strength of the association respectively. Result The prevalence of Hepatitis B surface Antigen among pregnant women was 49(7.3%). History of multiple sexual partners (AOR = 2.675, 95%CI = 1.107–6.463), surgical procedure (AOR = 3.218, 95%CI = 1.446–7.163), genital mutilation (AOR = 2.72, 95% CI = 1.407–5.263), and tooth extraction (AOR = 2.049, 95%CI = 1.061–3.956) were statistically associated with HBV. Conclusion and recommendation Intermediate endemicity of Hepatitis B Virus (7.3%) was observed among mothers attending antenatal clinics of Wolaita Zone. History of tooth extraction, history of surgical procedure, history of genital mutilation and history multiple sexual partners were factors associated with acquisition of Hepatitis B Virus infection. Therefore, we recommend that the health education programs should be done to avoid traditional and non-sterile tooth extraction methods, female genital mutilation and avoiding having multiple sexual partner and its consequences to community and to raise the awareness of mothers attending antenatal clinics. Facilities should strictly follow sterile procedures in every surgical procedure."

The infaunal clam Arctica islandica regulates pO2 of hemolymph and mantle cavity water to mean values of <5 kPa, even in a completely oxygen-saturated environment of 21 kPa. These low internal pO2 values support a longer NO lifespan and NO accumulation in the body fluids and can thus trigger a depression of metabolic rate in the clams. Measurable amounts of NO formation were detected in hemocyte cells (~110 pmol NO 100−1 hemocytes h-1 at 6 kPa), which was not prevented in the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME, and in the gill filaments of A. islandica. Adding a NO donor to intact gills and tissue homogenate significantly inhibited gill respiration and CytOx activity below 10 kPa. Meanwhile, the addition of the NO-oxidation product nitrite did not affect metabolic rates. The high nitrite levels found in the hemolymph of experimental mussels under anoxia do not indicate cellular NO production, but could be an indication of nitrate reduction by facultative anaerobic bacteria associated with tissue and/or hemolymph biofilms. Our results suggest that NO plays an important role in the initiation of metabolic depression during self-induced burrowing and shell closure of A. islandica. Furthermore, NO appears to reduce mitochondrial oxygen radical formation during surfacing and cellular reoxygenation after prolonged periods of hypoxia and anoxia."
https://openalex.org/W3023868056,"Introduction Although Italy’s NHS is funded through general taxation, the private sector plays an important role in health service provision and financing. The aim of this paper was to identify the sociodemographic and health service organizational factors associated with the propensity to seek specialist care in the private sector. Materials and methods Data were retrieved from the national Istat survey “Health conditions and use of health services” carried out in 2012–2013. We selected adults with a specialty visit in the previous 12 months in the four most frequent medical specialties: ophthalmology, cardiology, obstetrics/gynecology and orthopedics. The study outcome was the choice to use a private service. In order to investigate the determinants of private use, we adopted the socio-behavioral model by Andersen and Newman, making a distinction between sociodemographic and healthcare organizational factors. The associations with the outcome were analyzed using chi-squared test, t-test and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results and discussion Use of private care varied widely, from 26.3% for cardiology to 53.6% for obstetrics/gynecology. Females, patients with higher educational levels and patients with higher self-reported economic resources sought more frequently private healthcare for all specialties; younger patients and employed patients were more likely to seek private care for ophthalmic conditions. Exemption from copayment for public services reduced more than half the propensity to seek private care. Trust in this healthcare service was the main reason for private users (52.5%) followed by waiting time (26.7%) and physician choice (20.1%). Conclusion The attitude of the population to use private services for specialist visits is linked both to sociodemographic and health services organizational factors: the former are unmodifiable while the latter are susceptible to managerial and health policy actions. In a public-financed, universal coverage system, policy makers may act upon the organizational factors that make private health facilities more attractive in order to reduce private care use."
https://openalex.org/W3021411227,"To analyze types and patterns of greening trends across a city, this study seeks to identify a method of creating very high-resolution urban vegetation maps that scales over space and time. Vegetation poses unique challenges for image segmentation because it is patchy, has ragged boundaries, and high in-class heterogeneity. Existing and emerging public datasets with the spatial resolution necessary to identify granular urban vegetation lack a depth of affordable and accessible labeled training data, making unsupervised segmentation desirable. This study evaluates three unsupervised methods of segmenting urban vegetation: clustering with k-means using k-means++ seeding; clustering with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM); and an unsupervised, backpropagating convolutional neural network (CNN) with simple iterative linear clustering superpixels. When benchmarked against internal validity metrics and hand-coded data, k-means is more accurate than GMM and CNN in segmenting urban vegetation. K-means is not able to differentiate between water and shadows, however, and when this segment is important GMM is best for probabilistically identifying secondary land cover class membership. Though we find the unsupervised CNN shows high degrees of accuracy on built urban landscape features, its accuracy when segmenting vegetation does not justify its complexity. Despite limitations, for segmenting urban vegetation, k-means has the highest performance, is the simplest, and is more efficient than alternatives."
https://openalex.org/W3023828162,"Bacterial live cell sensors are potentially powerful tools for the detection of environmental toxins. In this work, we have established and validated a flow cytometry readout for an existing bacterial arabinose sensor system with DNA methylation based memory function (Maier et al., 2017, Nat. Comm., 8:15336). Flow cytometry readout is convenient and enables a multiparameter analysis providing information about single-cell variability, which is beneficial for further development of sensor systems of this type in the future. We then designed a tetracycline sensor system, because of the importance of antibiotics pollution in the light of multi-resistant pathogens. To this end, a tetracycline trigger plasmid was constructed by replacing the araC repressor gene and the ara operator of the arabinose trigger plasmid with the tetR gene coding for the tetracycline repressor and the tet operon. After combination with the memory plasmid, the tetracycline sensor system was shown to be functional in E. coli allowing to detect and memorize the presence of tetracycline. Due to a positive feedback between the trigger and memory systems, the combined whole-cell biosensor showed a very high sensitivity for tetracycline with a detection threshold at 0.1 ng/ml tetracycline, which may be a general property of sensors of this type. Moreover, acute presence of tetracycline and past exposure can be detected by this sensor using the dual readout of two reporter fluorophores."
https://openalex.org/W3021302678,"Ageing is associated with declines in cognitive functions and physical fitness (PF). Physical exercise training and physical activity (PA) have been shown to have positive effects on cognitive functions and brain plasticity. This study aims to establish a practical equation for evaluating cognitive functions using PF parameters in healthy older adults. One-hundred and two older subjects were physically and clinically evaluated. Participants performed the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and handgrip test (HG); general cognitive functions were examined using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). For all of them, a multiple regression analysis was used to predict MMSE from age, SPPB and HG variables. The new equation was cross validated to determine its prediction accuracy. Considering that SPPB and MMSE reference score are not different between genders, only one equation was developed for females and males. Age, SPPB and HG correlated significantly (p<0.01) with the MMSE score. The developed equation was MMSE = 19.479 + (1.548 x SPPB)-(0.130 x age) (R2 = 0.72 and root mean square errors of 3.6). The results of PF are useful for exercise specialists to achieve the best physical exercise training and PA in older adults. In conclusion, this study showed for the first time that our new equation can be used to predict subjects' cognitive functions based on SPPB results and subject age. We suggest its use when patients' cognitive functions or more appropriate clinical tests cannot be pursued."
https://openalex.org/W3021982283,"Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of coronary artery disease (CAD). Several observational studies have examined the association of traditional CAD risk factors with the progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC). In our study we investigated the effect of 11 different genetic risk scores associated with CAD and CAD risk factors on the progression of CAC.We included 3097 participants from the Heinz Nixdorf Recall study who had available CAC measurements at baseline (CACb) and at the 5-year follow-up (CAC5y). A weighted genetic risk score for CAD and each of the CAD-associated risk factors was constructed. Multiple regression analyses were applied to i) the difference between the observed log(CAC5y+1) (log(obs)) and expected log(CAC5y+1) (log(exp)) at the 5-year follow-up following the individual's log(CACb+1) percentile for the time between scans (log(obs)-log(exp)) and ii) the 5-year CAC progression, defined as 5*(log(CAC5y+1)-log(CACb+1))/time between the scans, adjusted for age, sex, and log(CACb+1) as well as for risk factors. The median percent deviation from the expected (CAC5y+1) and the 5-year progression of (CAC+1) in our study were 0 (first quartile: Q1; third quartile: Q3: -0.32; 0.48) and 45.4% (0%; 171.0%) respectively. In the age-, sex- and log(CACb+1)-adjusted model, the per-standard deviation (SD) increase in CAD genetic risk score was associated with the percent deviation from the expected (CAC5y+1) (9.7% (95% confidence interval: 5.2%; 14.5%), p = 1.6x10-5) and the 5-year progression of CAC (7.1% (3.0%; 11.4%), p = 0.0005). The CAD genetic risk score explains an additional 0.6% of the observed phenotypic variance for ""log(obs)-log(exp)"" and 0.4% for 5-year progression of CAC. Additionally, the per-SD increase in the CAC genetic risk score was associated with the percent deviation from the expected (CAC5y+1) (6.2% (1.9%; 10.8%, p = 0.005)) explaining an additional 0.2% of the observed phenotypic variance. However, the per-SD increase in the CAC genetic risk score was not associated with the 5-year progression of CAC (4.4% (0.4%; 8.5%), p = 0.03) after multiple testing. Adjusting for risk factors did not change the results. None of the other genetic risk scores showed an association with the percent deviation from the expected (CAC5y+1) or with the 5-year progression of CAC.The association of the CAC genetic risk score and the CAD genetic risk score provides evidence that genetic determinants for CAC and CAD influence the progression of CAC."
https://openalex.org/W3022742009,"To explore the relationship between the viral load reflected by the Ct value of Cobas 4800 HPV test and cervical lesions, and the effectiveness of the viral load for secondary triage of HPV-positive women.The Chinese Multi-Center Screening Trial (CHIMUST) evaluated both self-collected samples and physician-collected samples from women, aged 30 to 59, who were screened for cervical cancer in 6 regions across China. Using physician collected samples, the relationship between the HPV-Ct values of different subtypes and the cervical lesions was analyzed. Then the combined use of the HPV-Ct values with the HPV subtypes was evaluated as a secondary screening algorithm for the women who were HPV positive.The Ct values of HPV16 and 12 other HPV subtypes(12-type pool), tested with Cobas decreased with the progression of cervical lesion (HPV16: r = -0.429, P<0.001; 12 other HR-HPV subtypes: r = -0.099, P<0.01). The HPV18-Ct value was not correlated with cervical lesion(P>0.05). Compared with HPV16/18 and cytology (HPV16/18 positive and 12-type pool plus cytology ≥ ASC-US), the sequential secondary screening using HPV16/18 and the viral load of 12-type pool (cut-point HPV-Ct≤31) had equal sensitivities for CIN2+ and CIN3+ (83.1%vs.80.3%,100%vs.92.6%,P>0.05), with slightly lower specificities (96.2%vs.94.4%,96.5%vs.93.9%,P<0.001) and higher colposcopy referral rate (4.90%vs.6.59%, P<0.05), but required no cytology.Type-specific HPV viral load is closely related to cervical lesions severity. It is feasible and efficient to use HPV16/18 and the viral load of 12 other HPV subtypes (with cut-point HPV-Ct≤31) as the secondary screening for HPV positive women. This algorithm may be useful in low resource regions."
https://openalex.org/W3023714422,"Background 
A low proportion of P. vivax-exposed individuals acquire protective strain-transcending neutralizing IgG antibodies that are able to block the interaction between the Duffy binding protein II (DBPII) and its erythrocyte-specific invasion receptor. In a recent study, a novel surface-engineered DBPII-based vaccine termed DEKnull-2, whose antibody response target conserved DBPII epitopes, was able to induce broadly binding-inhibitory IgG antibodies (BIAbs) that inhibit P. vivax reticulocyte invasion. Toward the development of DEKnull-2 as an effective P. vivax blood-stage vaccine, we investigate the relationship between naturally acquired DBPII-specific IgM response and the profile of IgG antibodies/BIAbs activity over time.


Methodology/principal findings 
A nine-year follow-up study was carried-out among long-term P. vivax-exposed Amazonian individuals and included six cross-sectional surveys at periods of high and low malaria transmission. DBPII immune responses associated with either strain-specific (Sal1, natural DBPII variant circulating in the study area) or conserved epitopes (DEKnull-2) were monitored by conventional serology (ELISA-detected IgM and IgG antibodies), with IgG BIAbs activity evaluated by functional assays (in vitro inhibition of DBPII–erythrocyte binding). The results showed a tendency of IgM antibodies toward Sal1-specific response; the profile of Sal1 over DEKnull-2 was not associated with acute malaria and sustained throughout the observation period. The low malaria incidence in two consecutive years allowed us to demonstrate that variant-specific IgG (but not IgM) antibodies waned over time, which resulted in IgG skewed to the DEKnull-2 response. A persistent DBPII-specific IgM response was not associated with the presence (or absence) of broadly neutralizing IgG antibody response.


Conclusions/significance 
The current study demonstrates that long-term exposure to low and unstable levels of P. vivax transmission led to a sustained DBPII-specific IgM response against variant-specific epitopes, while sustained IgG responses are skewed to conserved epitopes. Further studies should investigate on the role of a stable and persistent IgM antibody response in the immune response mediated by DBPII."
https://openalex.org/W3022942924,"The brain's biological clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus and generates circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior. The circadian clock needs daily adjustment by light to stay synchronized (entrained) with the astronomical 24 h light/dark cycle. Light entrainment occurs via melanopsin expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) and two neurotransmitters of the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT), PACAP and glutamate, which transmit light information to the SCN neurons. In SCN neurons, light signaling involves the immediate-early genes Fos, Egr1 and the clock genes Per1 and Per2. In this study, we used PACAP deficient mice to evaluate PACAP's role in light induced gene expression of EGR1 in SCN neurons during early (ZT17) and late (ZT23) subjective night at high (300 lux) and low (10 lux) white light exposure. We found significantly lower levels of both EGR1 mRNA and protein in the SCN in PACAP deficient mice compared to wild type mice at early subjective night (ZT17) exposed to low but not high light intensity. No difference was found between the two genotypes at late night (ZT23) at neither light intensities. In conclusion, light mediated EGR1 induction in SCN neurons at early night at low light intensities is dependent of PACAP signaling. A role of PACAP in shaping synaptic plasticity during light stimulation at night is discussed."

Greece has emerged as a country with high macrolide use. However, studies suggest a gradual reduction in macrolide consumption after 2007.During a 7-year period (2011-2017), 604 GAS isolates were recovered from consecutive children presenting with pharyngeal or nonpharyngeal infections in Central Greece; 517 viable isolates underwent molecular analysis, including emm typing.Isolates belonged to 20 different emm types (in decreasing order of prevalence: 1, 89, 4, 12, 28, 3, 75 and 6, accounting for 88.2% of total isolates). The emm types comprised 10 emm clusters (five most common clusters: E4, A-C3, E1, A-C4 and A-C5). The emm89 isolates were acapsular ('new clade'). Overall macrolide resistance rate was 15.4%, and cMLSB emerged as the predominant resistance phenotype (56.4%). The lowest annual resistance rates occurred in 2014 (13.1%), 2016 (5.5%) and 2017(8.0%) (P for trend = 0.002). Consumption of macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin B declined by 22.6% during 2011-2017. Macrolide resistance and emm28 and emm77 types were associated (both P<0.001). The most frequently identified genetic lineages of macrolide-resistant GAS included emm28/ST52, emm77/ST63, emm12/ST36, emm89/ST101 and emm4/ST39. We estimated that 98.8% of the isolates belonged to emm types incorporated into a novel 30-valent M protein vaccine.In Central Greece during 2011-2017, the acapsular emm89 isolates comprised the second most prevalent type. Susceptibility testing and molecular analyses revealed decreasing GAS macrolide resistance rates, which may be attributed to the reduction in the consumption of macrolides and/or the reduced circulation of macrolide-resistant clones in recent years. Such data may provide valuable baseline information in targeting therapeutic intervention and the formulation of type-specific GAS vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3021843838,"Background In pregnant women with gestational diabetes, glyburide can be an alternative to insulin despite concerns about its transplacental transfer. However, transplacental transfer of glyburide is poorly quantified and the relationship between cord blood glyburide concentration and hypoglycemia has not been studied. Our objective was to quantify the transplacental transfer of glyburide at delivery and to study the association between the cord blood glyburide concentration and the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia in patients with gestational diabetes treated with glyburide. Methods and findings INDAO was a multicenter, noninferiority, randomized trial conducted between May 2012 and November 2016 in 914 women with singleton pregnancies and gestational diabetes. An ancillary study was conducted in the 87 patients of the Bicêtre University Hospital Center. The sample consisted of 46 patients with utilizable assays at delivery. The relationships between glyburide concentration and the time since the last intake of glyburide and between fetal glyburide concentration and neonatal hypoglycemia were modeled with linear or logistic regressions using fractional polynomials. There was placental transfer of glyburide at a fetal to maternal ratio of 62% (95% CI [50; 74]). Umbilical cord blood glyburide concentration decreased steeply after the last maternal glyburide intake. After 24 hours, the mean umbilical cord blood concentration was less than 5 ng/mL. Neonatal hypoglycemia risk was increased with an odds ratio of hypoglycemia equal to 3.70 [1.40–9.77] for each 10 ng/mL increase in the cord blood glyburide concentration. However, no newborns were admitted to the NICU because of clinical signs of hypoglycemia or for treatment of hypoglycemia. Conclusion Considering that neonatal glyburide exposure may be limited by stopping treatment a sufficient time before labor, there may still be a place for glyburide in the management of gestational diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3023652002,"Membrane transporters carry key metabolites across the cell membrane and, from a resource standpoint, are hypothesized to be produced when necessary. The expression of membrane transporters in metabolic pathways is often upregulated by the transporter substrate. In E. coli, such systems include for example the lacY, araFGH, and xylFGH genes, which encode for lactose, arabinose, and xylose transporters, respectively. As a case study of a minimal system, we build a generalizable physical model of the xapABR genetic circuit, which features a regulatory feedback loop via membrane transport (positive feedback) and enzymatic degradation (negative feedback) of an inducer. Dynamical systems analysis and stochastic simulations show that the membrane transport makes the model system bistable in certain parameter regimes. Thus, it serves as a genetic ""on-off"" switch, enabling the cell to only produce a set of metabolic enzymes when the corresponding metabolite is present in large amounts. We find that the negative feedback from the degradation enzyme does not significantly disturb the positive feedback from the membrane transporter. We investigate hysteresis in the switching and discuss the role of cooperativity and multiple binding sites in the model circuit. Fundamentally, this work explores how a stable genetic switch for a set of enzymes is obtained from transcriptional auto-activation of a membrane transporter through its substrate."
https://openalex.org/W3021224297,"Raqqa Governorate has been grappling with dual crisis-related burdens from the civil conflict and ISIS occupation. As part of a response to support households within this area, a three-month, unconditional cash assistance program was implemented by the International Rescue Committee to help households meet their basic needs. A quantitative, pre-posttest with 512 women at baseline (n = 456 at endline) was conducted in northern Raqqa Governorate between March-August 2018 to determine their experiences in this cash assistance program and to understand perceived change over time in food insecurity, perceived household serious needs and daily stressors, and depressive symptoms before and after cash was delivered. Forty women also completed in-depth interviews using a life line history technique at endline. Linear household fixed effects models demonstrated significant reductions in food insecurity (β = -0.95; 95%CI: -1.19--0.71), no change in perceived serious household needs and daily stressors (β = 0.12; 95%CI: -0.24-0.48), and increases in depressive symptoms (β = 0.89; 95%CI: 0.34-1.43) before and after the period of cash distribution. Although no causality can be inferred, short-term emergency cash assistance programming yielded significant improvements in food security, was highly acceptable and viewed favorably, and assisted women and their families to meet their basic needs in this emergency setting. However, before and after this form of cash assistance was implemented, no meaningful changes in the perceived levels of serious needs and stressors amongst households were observed, but potential increases in depressive symptoms for women were reported during this time period. Further work is needed to determine appropriate targeting, length, and dosage of cash, alongside any potential livelihood, psychosocial, or structural complementary programming to yield potential positive mental health benefits of a cash assistance program focused on meeting a population's basic needs while not inadvertently delaying or decreasing reach of life-saving cash assistance programming in emergencies."

In this study, we examined the influence of S100B gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) on acute and chronic pain variability in SCD.Composite pain index (CPI) scores captured chronic pain. Painful crisis related emergency care utilization recorded acute pain incidence. Genotyping was performed using MassARRAY iPLEX platform.Regression analysis revealed associations of increased CPI with rs9722 A allele in additive (p = 0.005) and dominant (p = 0.005) models. Rs1051169 G allele on the other hand was associated with decreased CPI in additive (p = 0.001), and dominant (p = 0.005) models. Sex-specific analysis found that these associations were significant in females but not males in this cohort. Linkage analysis identified two haploblocks. Block 1 (rs9983698-rs9722) haplotype T-A was associated with increased CPI (p = 0.002) while block 2 (rs1051169-rs11911834) haplotype G-G was associated with decreased CPI (p = 0.001). Both haplotypic associations were only significant in females. No association of S100B SNPs with utilization reached statistical significance.S100B SNPs and haplotypes are associated with chronic pain in female, but not male, patients with SCD, implicating a potential role of S100B polymorphism in SCD pain heterogeneity in a sex-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W3022470159,"Customized foot orthoses (FOs) are designed based on foot posture and function, while the interaction between these metrics and FO deformation remains unknown due to technical problems. Our aim was to predict FO deformation under dynamic loading using an artificial intelligence (AI) approach, and to report the deformation of two FOs of different stiffness during walking.Each FO was fixed on a plate, and six triad reflective markers were fitted on its contour, and 55 markers on its plantar surface. Manual loadings with known magnitude and application point were applied to deform ""sport"" and ""regular"" (stiffer) FOs in all regions (training session). Then, 13 healthy male subjects walked with the same FOs inside shoes, where the triad markers were visible by means of shoe holes (walking session). The marker trajectories were recorded using optoelectronic system. A neural network was trained to find the dependency between the orientation of triads on FO contour and the position of markers on its plantar surface. After tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the performance of the model, marker positions on FOs surfaces were predicted during walking for each subject. Statistical parametric mapping was used to compare the pattern of deformation between two FOs.Overall, the model showed an average error of <0.6 mm for predicting the marker positions on both FOs. The training setup was appropriate to simulate the range of triads' displacement and the peak loading on FOs during walking. Sport FO showed different pattern and significantly higher range of deformation during walking compared to regular FO.Our technique enables an indirect and accurate estimation of FO surface deformation during walking. The AI model was capable to make a distinction between two FOs with different stiffness and between subjects. This innovative approach can help to optimally customize the FO design."
https://openalex.org/W3022592753,"Providing compassionate and respectful maternity services in order to bring satisfaction to service users is one of the health extension services packages in Ethiopia. Though the service utilization and its associated factors have been well documented so far, yet there is a dearth of information on client satisfaction; particularly among rural women who are mostly the target groups of health extension services within the Ethiopia. Thus, this study aimed to assess mothers' satisfaction with health extension services and the associated factors in the Gamo Goffa Zone, of Southern Ethiopia.A community based cross sectional study was conducted among 478 women from February 1st to February 28th of 2018. A pre-tested and interviewer administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. The study participants were selected using a systematic random sampling technique by allocating a proportion to each rural kebeles. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to identify associated factors. Odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval was used to determine the degree of association. Level of statistical significance was set at a p-value of less than 0.05.The overall proportion of mothers who were satisfied with health extension services was 37.4% with 95% CI (33-44%). Mothers who had good family monthly income [AOR = 4.66 (95% CI: 1.1, 20.6)], whose husbands participated in the health extension program [AOR = 4.02 (95% CI: 2.0, 8.1)], who had recent participation in planning of health extension programs [AOR = 5.75 (95% CI: 2.0, 16.5)], who were recognized as a model family [AOR = 2.23 (95% CI: 1.1, 4.6)] had higher odds of satisfaction with health extension services.Satisfaction with the health extension services was low among women in the study area. A better household monthly income, women's and their husbands' participation in health extension services and being a member of a model family were positively associated with their satisfaction. Interventions to enhance women's satisfaction in the health extension service need to focus on household-based involvement of them and their husbands in planning and implementing the services. Likewise, expansion of experiences of model families in the community would raise satisfaction levels."
https://openalex.org/W3023303780,"Objectives To compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters of small, deeply located non-malignant and malignant soft-tissue tumors (STTs). Methods Between May 2011 and December 2017, 95 MRIs in 95 patients with pathologically proven STTs of small size (<5 cm) and deep location (66 non-malignant and 29 malignant) were identified. For qualitative parameters, consensus reading was performed by three radiologists for presence of necrosis, infiltration, lobulation, and the tail sign. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was analyzed by two other radiologists independently. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to determine the diagnostic performances of MRI parameters in differentiating non-malignancy and malignancy, and for non-myxoid, non-hemosiderin STTs and myxoid STTs as subgroups. Interobserver agreement for ADC measurement was calculated with the intraclass correlation coefficient. Results Interobserver agreement on ADC measurement was almost perfect. On univariable analysis, the malignant group showed a significantly larger size, lower ADC, and higher incidence of all qualitative MRI parameters for all STTs. Size (p = 0.012, odds ratio [OR] 2.57), ADC (p = 0.041, OR 3.85), and the tail sign (p = 0.009, OR 6.47) were independently significant on multivariable analysis. For non-myxoid, non-hemosiderin STTs, age, size, ADC, frequency of infiltration, lobulation, and the tail sign showed significant differences between non-malignancy and malignancy on univariable analysis. Only ADC (p = 0.032, OR 142.86) retained its independence on multivariable analysis. For myxoid STTs, only size and tail sign were significant on univariable analysis without independent significance. Conclusions Size, ADC, and incidence of qualitative MRI parameters were significantly different between small, deeply located non-malignant and malignant STTs. Only ADC was independently significant for both overall analysis and the non-myxoid, non-hemosiderin subgroup."

This study examines the completeness of maternal death reporting by the district health office (DHO) system in Banten Province.We used a nested-control study design to compare data on maternal deaths in 2016 from the DHO reporting system and the MADE-IN/MADE-FOR method in two districts and one municipality in Banten Province, with the aim of identifying and characterizing missed deaths in the DHO reporting system. The capture-recapture method was used to assess the magnitude of underreporting of maternal deaths by both systems.A total of 169 maternal deaths were reported in the MADE-IN/MADE-FOR study for calendar year 2016 in the three study areas. The DHO system reported 105 maternal deaths for the same period, of which 90 cases were found in both data sources. Capture-recapture analyses suggest that the MADE-IN/MADE-FOR approach identified 92% (95% CI: 87%-95%) of all maternal deaths, while the DHO system captured 57% (95% CI: 50%-64%) of all maternal deaths. Deaths of women who resided in urban areas had four times higher odds (OR 4.3, 95% CI: 1.52-12.3) of being missed by the DHO system compared to deaths among women who lived in rural or remote areas after adjusting for other covariates.The DHO reporting system missed approximately half of the maternal deaths in the 3 study areas, suggesting that the DHO system is likely to grossly underestimate the maternal mortality ratio. The DHO reporting system needs to be improved to capture and characterize all maternal deaths."

A secondary objective was to validate and replicate the findings by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a second independent cohort.Women undergoing a mid-trimester genetic amniocentesis at Sahlgrenska University Hospital/Östra between September 2008 and September 2011 were enrolled in this study, designed in three analytical stages; 1) an unbiased proteomic discovery phase using LC-MS analysis of 22 women with subsequent spontaneous preterm delivery (cases) and 37 women who delivered at term (controls), 2) a validation phase of proteins of interest identified in stage 1, and 3) a replication phase of the proteins that passed validation using a second independent cohort consisting of 20 cases and 40 matched controls.Nine proteins were nominally significantly associated with both spontaneous preterm delivery and gestational duration, after adjustment for gestational age at sampling, but none of the proteins were significant after correction for multiple testing. Several of these proteins have previously been described as being associated with spontaneous PTD etiology and six of them were thus validated using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Two of the proteins passed validation; Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, but the results could not be replicated in a second cohort.Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 are potential biomarkers of spontaneous preterm delivery and gestational duration but the findings could not be replicated. The negative findings are supported by the fact that none of the nine proteins from the exploratory phase were significant after correction for multiple testing."
https://openalex.org/W3021992450,"Allergic asthma is the most common phenotype of the pathology, having an early-onset in childhood and producing a Th2-driven airways remodeling process that leads to symptoms and pathophysiological changes. The avoidance of aeroallergen exposure in early life has been shown to prevent asthma, but without repeated success and with the underlying preventive mechanisms at the beginning of asthma far to be fully recognized. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate if neonatal LPS-induced boost in epithelial host defenses contribute to prevent OVA-induced asthma in adult mice. To this, we focused on the response of bronchiolar club cells (CC), which are highly specialized in maintaining the epithelial homeostasis in the lung. In these cells, neonatal LPS administration increased the expression of TLR4 and TNFα, as well as the immunodulatory/antiallergic proteins: club cell secretory protein (CCSP) and surfactant protein D (SP-D). LPS also prevented mucous metaplasia of club cells and reduced the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-dependent mucin overproduction, with mice displaying normal breathing patterns after OVA challenge. Furthermore, the overexpression of the epithelial Th2-related molecule TSLP was blunted, and normal TSLP and IL-4 levels were found in the bronchoalveolar lavage. A lower eosinophilia was detected in LPS-pretreated mice, along with an increase in phagocytes and regulatory cells (CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ and CD4+IL-10+), together with higher levels of IL-12 and TNFα. In conclusion, our study demonstrates stable asthma-preventive epithelial effects promoted by neonatal LPS stimulation, leading to the presence of regulatory cells in the lung. These anti-allergic dynamic mechanisms would be overlaid in the epithelium, favored by an adequate epidemiological environment, during the development of asthma."
https://openalex.org/W3022004272,"Human mobility, both short and long term, are important considerations in the study of numerous systems. Economic and technological advances have led to a more interconnected global community, further increasing the need for considerations of human mobility. While data on human mobility are better recorded in many developed countries, availability of such data remains limited in many low- and middle-income countries around the world, particularly at the fine temporal and spatial scales required by many applications. In this study, we used 5-year census-based internal migration microdata for 32 departments in Colombia (i.e., Admin-1 level) to develop a novel spatial interaction modeling approach for estimating migration, at a finer spatial scale, among the 1,122 municipalities in the country (i.e., Admin-2 level). Our modeling approach addresses a significant lack of migration data at administrative unit levels finer than those at which migration data are typically recorded. Due to the widespread availability of census-based migration microdata at the Admin-1 level, our modeling approach opens up for the possibilities of modeling migration patterns at Admin-2 and Admin-3 levels across many other countries where such data are currently lacking."
https://openalex.org/W3022110845,"One of the most important and exclusive characteristics of mycobacteria is their cell wall. Amongst its constituent components are two related families of glycosylated lipids, diphthioceranates and phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) and its variant phenolic glycolipids (PGL). PGL have been associated with cell wall impermeability, phagocytosis, defence against nitrosative and oxidative stress and, intriguingly, biofilm formation. In bacteria from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), the biosynthetic pathway of the phenolphthiocerol moiety of PGL depends upon the expression of several genes encoding type I polyketide synthases (PKS), namely ppsA-E and pks15/1 which constitute the PDIM + PGL locus, and that are highly conserved in PDIM/PGL-producing strains. Consensus has not been achieved regarding the genetic organization of pks15/1 locus and knowledge is lacking on its transcriptional signature. Here we explore publicly available datasets of transcriptome data (RNA-seq) from more than 100 MTBC experiments in 40 growth conditions to outline the transcriptional structure and signature of pks15/1, using a differential expression approach to infer the regulatory patterns involving these and related genes. We show that pks1 expression is highly correlated with fadD22, Rv2949c, lppX, fadD29 and, also, pks6 and pks12, with the first three putatively integrating into a polycistronic structure. We evidence dynamic transcriptional heterogeneity within the genes involved in phenolphtiocerol and phenolic glycolipid production, most exhibiting up-regulation upon acidic pH and antibiotic exposure and down-regulation under hypoxia, dormancy, and low/high iron concentration. We finally propose a model based on transcriptome data in which σD positively regulates pks1, pks15 and fadD22, while σB and σE factors exert negative regulation at an upper level."
https://openalex.org/W3021276099,"Many studies on Heracleum have shown poor correspondence between observed molecular clusters and established taxonomic classification amongst closely related species. This might reflect both unresolved taxonomy but perhaps also a lack of good genetic markers. This lack of appropriate and cost effective species-specific genetic markers hinders a resolved relationship for the species complex, and this in turn causes profound management challenges for a genus that contains both endemic species, with important ecological roles, and species with an invasive potential. Microsatellites are traditionally considered markers of choice for comprehensive, yet inexpensive, analyses of genetic variation, including examination of population structure, species identity, linkage map construction and cryptic speciation. In this study, we have used double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) to develop microsatellite markers in Heracleum rechingeri. Genomic DNA from three individuals were digested with Sbf1 and Nde1 and size selected for library construction. The size-selected fragments were sequenced on an Ion Torrent sequencer and a total of 54 microsatellite sequences were bioinformatically confirmed. Twenty five loci were then tested for amplification, resulting in 19 of these being successfully amplified across eight species, comprising both the so-called thick-stemmed species (H. persicum, H. rechingeri, H. gorganicum and H. lasiopetalum), and thin-stemmed species (H. anisactis, H. pastinasifolium and H. transcaucasicum). Both Bayesian and distance-based clustering, and principal coordinate analyses clearly separated these into two groups. Surprisingly, three H. pastinacifolium populations were not separated from populations of the morphologically similar endemic species, H. anisactis, suggesting lack of genetic differentiation. Likewise, high genetic similarity was found between H. persicum and H. rechingeri populations, questioning taxonomic separation at the species level between these taxa. Further analyses are needed to re-evaluate the taxonomic significance of observed morphological variability currently applied to distinguish these sister taxa. Nevertheless, our results represent progress in the effort to develop cost-efficient molecular tools for species discrimination in this genus."
https://openalex.org/W3021283935,"Safety critical events in robotic applications can often be characterized by forces between the robot end-effector and the environment. One application in which safe interaction between the robot and environment is critical is in the area of medical robots. In this paper, we propose a novel Compact Form Dynamic Linearization Model-Free Prediction (CFDL-MFP) technique to predict future values of any time-series sensor data, such as interaction forces. Existing time series forecasting methods have high computational times which motivates the development of a novel technique. Using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) forecasting as benchmark, the performance of the proposed model was evaluated in terms of accuracy, computation efficiency, and stability on various force profiles. The proposed algorithm was 11% more accurate than ARIMA and maximum computation time of CFDL-MFP was 4ms, compared to ARIMA (7390ms). Furthermore, we evaluate the model in the special case of predicting needle buckling events, before they occur, by using only axial force and needle-tip position data. The model was evaluated experimentally for robustness with steerable needle insertions into different tissues including gelatin and biological tissue. For a needle insertion velocity of 2.5mm/s, the proposed algorithm was able to predict needle buckling 2.03s sooner than human detections. In biological tissue, no false positive or false negative buckling detections occurred and the rates were low in artificial tissue. The proposed forecasting model can be used to ensure safe robot interactions with delicate environments by predicting adverse force-based events before they occur."
https://openalex.org/W3021478525,"Platelet factor 4 is a cytokine released into the bloodstream by activated platelets where it plays a pivotal role in etiology and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Therefore, a sustainable source of recombinant PF4 with structural and functional similarity to its native form is urgently needed to be used in diagnostic procedures. To this end, a three-in-one primary construct was designed from which three secondary constructs can be derived each capable of employing either type I, type II secretory or cytoplasmic pathways. Protein expression and secretion were performed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To further enhance protein secretion, the effect of several controllable chemical factors including IPTG, Triton X-100, sucrose, and glycine were individually investigated at the outset. In the next step, according to a fractional factorial approach, the synergistic effects of IPTG, Triton X-100, and glycine on secretion were further investigated. To ascertain the structure and function of the secreted recombinant proteins, dynamic light scattering was utilized to confirm the rPF4 tetramerization and heparin-mediated ultra-large complex formation. Moreover, Raman spectroscopy and Western blotting were exploited to evaluate the secondary and quaternary structures, respectively. The type II secretory pathway was proven to be superior to type I in the case of rPF4 secretion. Supplementation with chemical enhancers improved the protein secretion mediated by the Type II system to approximately more than 500 μg/mL. Large quantities of native rPF4 up to 20 mg were purified as the culture medium was scaled up to 40 mL. Western blotting confirmed the formation of dimers and tetramers in the secreted rPF4 proteins. Dynamic light scattering revealed the rPF4 oligomerization into of larger complexes of approximately 100-1200 nm in size following heparin supplementation, implying proper protein folding and tetramerization. Moreover, the rPF4 secondary structure was found to be 43.5% Random coil, 32.5% β-sheet, 18.6% α-helix and 4.9% Turn, which is in perfect agreement with the native structure. Our results indicate that the gram-negative type II bacterial secretory system holds a great promise as a reliable protein production strategy with industrial applications. However, further efforts are required to realize the full potential of secretory pathways regarding their application to proteins with distinct characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3022604699,"Economic recessions occur with varying duration and intensity and may entail substantial losses in terms of GDP, employment, household income, and investment spending. In this work, we propose a statistical model for the time intervals between recessions that accounts for the state of the economy and the impact of market adjustments and regulatory changes. The model uses a generalized renewal process based on the Gumbel distribution (GuGRP) in which times between consecutive events are conditionally independent. We also present a novel goodness of fit test tailored to the GuGRP that validates the use of the statistical model for the analysis of recessions. Analyzing recessions in the U.S. and Europe, we demonstrate that the statistical model characterizes well recession inter-arrival times and that the model performs better than simpler, commonly used distributions. In addition, the presented statistical model enables us to compare the adjustment processes in different economies and to forecast the occurrence of future recessions."
https://openalex.org/W3023286455,"This article introduces a new formulation of, and method of computation for, the projection median. Additionally, we explore its behaviour on a specific bivariate set up, providing the first theoretical result on form of the influence curve for the projection median, accompanied by numerical simulations. Via new simulations we comprehensively compare our performance with an established method for computing the projection median, as well as other existing multivariate medians. We focus on answering questions about accuracy and computational speed, whilst taking into account the underlying dimensionality. Such considerations are vitally important in situations where the data set is large, or where the operations have to be repeated many times and some well-known techniques are extremely computationally expensive. We briefly describe our associated R package that includes our new methods and novel functionality to produce animated multidimensional projection quantile plots, and also exhibit its use on some high-dimensional data examples."
https://openalex.org/W3023938588,"The Food and Drug Administration's menu labeling rule requires chain restaurants to prominently display calories, while leaving other nutritional information (e.g., fat, sodium, sugar) to the request of consumers. We use rich micronutrient data from 257 large chain brands and 24,076 menu items to examine whether calories are correlated with widely used ""nutrient profile"" scores that measure healthfulness based on nutrient density. We show that calories are indeed statistically significant predictors of nutrient density. However, as a substantive matter, the correlation is highly attenuated (partial R2 < 0.01). Our findings (a) suggest that the promise of calorie labeling to improve nutrient intake quality at restaurants is limited and (b) clarify the basis for transparency of nutrient composition beyond calories to promote healthy menu choices."
https://openalex.org/W3021508534,"Localization of the components of the cardiac conduction system (CCS) is essential for many therapeutic procedures in cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology. While histological studies provided fundamental insights into CCS localization, this information is incomplete and difficult to translate to aid in intraprocedural localization. To advance our understanding of CCS localization, we set out to establish a framework for quantifying nodal region morphology. Using this framework, we quantitatively analyzed the sinoatrial node (SAN) and atrioventricular node (AVN) in ovine with postmenstrual age ranging from 4.4 to 58.3 months. In particular, we studied the SAN and AVN in relation to the epicardial and endocardial surfaces, respectively. Using anatomical landmarks, we excised the nodes and adjacent tissues, sectioned those at a thickness of 4 μm at 100 μm intervals, and applied Masson’s trichrome stain to the sections. These sections were then imaged, segmented to identify nodal tissue, and analyzed to quantify nodal depth and superficial tissue composition. The minimal SAN depth ranged between 20 and 926 μm. AVN minimal depth ranged between 59 and 1192 μm in the AVN extension region, 49 and 980 μm for the compact node, and 148 and 888 μm for the transition to His Bundle region. Using a logarithmic regression model, we found that minimal depth increased logarithmically with age for the AVN (R2 = 0.818, P = 0.002). Also, the myocardial overlay of the AVN was heterogeneous within different regions and decreased with increasing age. Age associated alterations of SAN minimal depth were insignificant. Our study presents examples of characteristic tissue patterns superficial to the AVN and within the SAN. We suggest that the presented framework provides quantitative information for CCS localization. Our studies indicate that procedural methods and localization approaches in regions near the AVN should account for the age of patients in cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology."
https://openalex.org/W3023943943,"The ParB-parS partition complexes that bacterial replicons use to ensure their faithful inheritance also find employment in visualization of DNA loci, as less intrusive alternatives to fluorescent repressor-operator systems. The ability of ParB molecules to interact via their N-terminal domains and to bind to non-specific DNA enables expansion of the initial complex to a size both functional in partition and, via fusion to fluorescent peptides, visible by light microscopy. We have investigated whether it is possible to dispense with the need to insert parS in the genomic locus of interest, by determining whether ParB fused to proteins that bind specifically to natural DNA sequences can still assemble visible complexes. In yeast cells, coproduction of fusions of ParB to a fluorescent peptide and to a TALE protein targeting an endogenous sequence did not yield visible foci; nor did any of several variants of these components. In E.coli, coproduction of fusions of SopB (F plasmid ParB) to fluorescent peptide, and to dCas9 together with specific guide RNAs, likewise yielded no foci. The result of coproducing analogous fusions of SopB proteins with distinct binding specificities was also negative. Our observations imply that in order to assemble higher order partition complexes, ParB proteins need specific activation through binding to their cognate parS sites."
