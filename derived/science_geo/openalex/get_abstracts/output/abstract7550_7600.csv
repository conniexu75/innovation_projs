https://openalex.org/W1598530978,"Relative rates of ovalbumin and conalbumin mRNA transcription were measured in isolated oviduct nuclei by allowing endogenous RNA polymerases to synthesize [32P]RNA that was then hybridized to immobilized recombinant DNA containing the respective gene sequences. Administration of either estrogen or progesterone to withdrawn birds increased the rate of conalbumin mRNA (mRNA,,,) transcription 2- to 3-fold within 30 min. The rate of ovalbumin mRNA (mRNA,,) transcription was undetectable before hormone administration and increased at least 20-fold during the first 12 h. The maximum rates of transcription achieved after 12 h of hormonal stimulation are only 10 to 25% of those observed after several days of hormone treatment; these transcription rates are consistent with the low levels of nuclear estrogen or progesterone receptors measured during the first 12 h of induction. The induction of mRNA, and mRNAcon in oviduct explant cultures was quantitatively comparable to that observed in vivo. Relative rates of transcription were also measured in this system by pulse-labeling with [3H]uridine. In addition, absolute rates of transcription were determined by measuring the specific activity of the UTP pool during the labeling period. The accumulation of mRNA., sequences was consistent with the absolute rate of transcription measurements, indicating that this mRNA has a long"

https://openalex.org/W1522223877,"The [3H]-triamcinolone acetonide-labeled glucocorticoid receptor from rat liver cytosol was purified to 85% homogeneity according to sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. It consisted of one subunit with a molecular weight of 89,000 and had one ligand-binding site per molecule. The purification involved sequential chromatography on phosphocellulose, DNA-cellulose twice, and Sephadex G-200. Between the two chromatography steps on DNA-cellulose, the receptor was heat activated. The receptor was affinity eluted from the second DNA-cellulose column with pyrodixal 5'-phosphate. The purification achieved in the first three chromatographic steps varied between 60 and 95% homogeneity in different experiments. After chromatography on the second DNA-cellulose column, the steroid.receptor complex had a Stokes radius of 6.0 nm and a sedimentation coefficient of 3.4 S in 0.15 M KCl. In the absence of KCl, the sedimentation coefficient was 3.6 S. After concentration on hydroxylapatite, the steroid.receptor complex was analyzed by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel. The radioactivity was shown to focus together with the major protein band with pI 5.8. Following limited proteolysis with trypsin, the radioactivity, together with the major protein band, focused at pI 6.2 as previously described for the unpurified steroid.receptor complex."

A key step in post-glycosylation processing is the sequential removal of glucose residues from the protein-linked oligosaccharide. We have studied rat liver preparations which catalyze removal of glucose from Glc3Man9GlcNAc, Glc2Man9GlcNAc, and Glc1Man9GlcNAc. Detergent solubilization studies, inhibitor studies, and temperature-activity profiles indicate that at least two distinct glucosidases are present in the membranes. One of these glucosidases removes the distal glucose from Glc3Man9GlcNAc, and the other glucosidase sequentially removes glucose from Glc2Man9GlcNAc and Glc1Man9GlcNAc. The latter glucosidase has been solubilized from the microsomal memrbranes and purified 12-fold. The glucosidases, which are integral membrane proteins, are localized in the rough and smooth microsomes and appear to be located on the cisternal surface of the microsomal vesicles. These glucosidases are suggested to be of biological importance in catalyzing the initial events in the post-glycosylation processing of cellular glycoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W1585457099,"In addition to the well known insulin-like effects of certain concentrations of H2O2 on glucose transport and oxidation in isolated rat adipocytes, the present work demonstrates that lipid synthesis from glucose is also enhanced over a narrow range of H2O2 concentrations (0.15 to 0.5 mM) added to the incubation medium. As in the case of insulin, H2O2 was found to stimulate greater glucose incorporation into glyceride-fatty acid than incorporation into glyceride-glycerol. As part of a multifaceted regulation of lipogenesis, H2O2, like insulin, increased the amount of pyruvate dehydrogenase in the active form without increasing the total amount of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity increased within 5 min of H2O2 incubation, reached a maximum at 15 min and declined thereafter as the H2O2 disappeared from the incubation medium. While medium glucose per se was found to activate the enzyme, it is unlikely that the effect of H2O2 was mediated by the known enhancement of glucose transport since the effects on the enzyme were maximal in the absence of glucose in the incubation medium. These findings add to the growing list of insulin effects that are reproduced by H2O2, and strengthen the hypothesis that assigns H2O2 the role of second messenger of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1537836578,"Rat liver lysosomal preparations incubated with 10(-5) M L-[4,5-3H]leucine methyl ester hydrolyzed the methyl ester and accumulated radioactivity within a particulate compartment. The acculated radioactivity was identified as free leucine by thin layer chromatography. Free leucine was not itself taken up by the lysosomal preparations. The capacity to accumulate leucine was identified as a specific property of lysosomes and was thought to result from the trapping of the free amino acid within the lysosome following the hydrolysis of the methyl ester. Lysosomes also accumulated phenylalanine, serine, and alanine when incubated with the corresponding methyl esters. Leucine accumulation was inhibited by submillimolar concentrations of chloroquine, by the protease inhibitor L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, and by lowering the pH below 7.0. Efflux of leucine from the lysosomes was highly temperature dependent (activation energy 33 kcal/mol). No evidence was found to suggest that leucine efflux was a carrier-mediated process. The results provide a new methodology for the study of amino acid movements across lysosomal membranes."

Chem. 254, 8768-8771, 8772-8776) describe the isolation and characterization of glycopeptides from human plasminogen affinity chromatography variants 1 and 2. Plasminogen variant 1 contains an asparagine288-based branched carbohydrate structure, which has been established in the immediately preceding manuscript. This structure is absent in variant 2. Plasminogen variants 1 and 2 contain a threonine-based glycoconjugate. This latter structure has been established by combination of methylation data, glycosidase digestions, periodate oxidations, and Smith degradations of the beta-eliminated reduced oligosaccharides. One glycopeptide unit, isolated from both plasminogen variants 1 (1D) and 2 (2D) possessed the following structure: Sia alpha 2 yields 3Gal beta 1 yields 3GalNAc-Thr. The threonine was found to be residue 345 in the Glu-plasminogen sequence. Another glycopeptide unit was also found to be present, in lower yields in both variants 1 (1E) and 2 (2E). The structure of this unit was: Sia alpha 2 yields 3Gal beta1 yields 3GalNAc-Thr. : formula: (see text), alpha 2,6 Sia. Again Thr 345 was the glycosylated amino acid. The amino acid sequence around the glycosylated threonine was found to be NH2-Ala.Pro.Thr(CHO).Ala.Pro.Pro.Glu."

https://openalex.org/W1482330285,"Adenylate cyclase activity was studied in a CHO-Kl somatic cell mutant that is defective in the regulation of plasma membrane cholesterol content. Changes in cholesterol content lead to parallel changes in membrane acyl chain ordering as assessed by electron spin resonance techniques. Both prostaglandin El (PGE1) and sodium fluoride (NaF) increase adenylate cyclase activity in membrane preparations from these cells. Increasing membrane order by increasing the amount of cholesterol in the membrane also led to an increase in basal adenylate cyclase activity. However, the relative stimulation by PGEl and NaF was significantly decreased in cells with increased membrane ordering. This was presumably due to the higher basal activity. The potency of these compounds in activating adenylate cyclase was unchanged with increased membrane ordering. Cholera toxin also activated adenylate cyclase when added to intact cells. Although the lag period for activation was unchanged by increased membrane ordering, the relative stimulation was again decreased. Thermodynamic analysis of the activation of adenylate cyclase by PGEl and NaF revealed increases in both enthalpy and entropy of activation. The activation caused by increased membrane ordering resulted in similar thermodynamic parameters, again resulting in an increased enthalpy and entropy of activation. The thermodynamic parameters suggest that PGE1, NaF, and increased acyl chain ordering all activate adenylate cyclase by stabilizing the enzyme in a more reactive conformation. Since the thermodynamic parameters of the activation by increased membrane acyl chain ordering are similar to those seen with activation by PGEl and NaF, it is possible that the effects of these substances are mediated through increases in acyl chain ordering."
https://openalex.org/W1538567869,"Abstract We have previously described the reconstitution of functional membrane vesicles with lipid content similar to that of the normal sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane (approximately 1.0 mumol of phospholipid/mg of protein). The present study describes methodology to prepare reconstituted membrane vesicles with defined phospholipid to protein ratio, both lower and higher than that of the original membrane. The Ca2+ loading rate and efficiency are greatest in the membranes of highest protein content (0.38 mumol of phospholipid/mg of protein), decline slowly as the lipid content is quadrupled, and decrease markedly as the lipid content is quadrupled again. Such membranes of defined composition can be used to study lipid-protein interaction and to correlate membrane structure with composition. The number of particles observed by freeze-fracture electron microscopy can be correlated with protein content, whereas the percentage of smooth domain is proportional to the lipid content of the reconstituted membrane. Since 90% or more of the protein of the reconstituted membrane is the calcium pump protein, the number of particles observed by freeze-fracture is directly proportional to the amount of calcium pump protein in the membrane. The number of pump molecules calculated to be in the membrane is greater by a factor of two than the number of particles which we observed. This multiplicity ratio could be greater depending upon the assumptions made regarding the width of the membrane (see Appendix). Thus, it would appear that the particles consist of two or more molecules of pump protein. The change in protein concentration of the membrane is reflected also in thin sections and by negative staining. In thin sections, the broad inner and outer 70 A bands become discontinuous and patchy and, in the limit, approach a symmetrical 20,20,20 A trilayer as the protein content of the membrane becomes small. In an analogous fashion, the concentration of particles at the surface of the membrane, observed by negative staining, decreases with increasing lipid concentration in the membrane. Thus, the correlation of composition with structure can be observed by each of the three methods of sample preparation for electron microscopic analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2151734103,"In the course of work on a systematic structural mapping of nonacid glycosphingolipids of human meconia, special attention was given to a major component preliminarily identified as an isomer of neolactotetraosylceramide (paragloboside). This component was isolated in its pure form from meconium of a blood group O individual and subjected to detailed structural analyses, using mass spectrometry and proton NMR spectroscopy on intact permethylated and permethylated-reduced (LiAlH4) derivatives, and gas liquid chromatography on degradational products of native, permethylated, and permethylated-reduced derivatives. The isolated compound was conclusively shown to have the structure Galp beta 1 yields 3GlcNAcp beta 1 yields 3Galp beta 1 yields 4Glcp beta 1 yields 1Cer, and is thus identified as lactotetraosylceramide. The major fatty acids were 2-hydroxy fatty acids with 16 and 20 to 24 carbon atoms, and the bases were sphingosine and phytosphingosine. This glycolipid, although not isolated and structurally characterized before, has long been thought of as a precursor substance of the Lewis active glycolipids and of ABH-active glycolipids with a type 1 saccharide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1559990487,"Adenylate deaminase from rat skeletal muscle has been studied with the objective of understanding how the activity of the enzyme is regulated in vivo. ATP and GTP inhibit the enzyme at low concentrations in the presence of 150 mM KCl. The ATP inhibition is reversed as the ATP concentration is raised to physiological levels. The GTP inhibition is reversed as the GTP concentration is raised to unphysiologically high levels. In the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP, the GTP inhibition is also greatly diminished, but inhibition by orthophosphate remains strong. The apparent affinities of the enzyme for GTP, ATP, and orthophosphate are reduced as the pH is decreased from 7.0 to 6.2. ADP also reduces the apparent affinities of the enzyme for the inhibitors. The regulatory effects of GTP, ATP, and ADP are produced primarily by their unchelated forms. Comparison of the kinetic behavior of the enzyme in vitro with metabolite concentrations in vivo indicates that the major variables that regulate the activity of adenylate deaminase of muscle in vivo are the concentrations of AMP, ADP, orthophosphate, and H+."

The nature of this transfer reaction and the galactose-containing trisaccharide-lipid product have been partially characterized. Using galactosyltransferase as a probe, the topolical arrangement of chitobiosyl-lipid in both artificial and natural membranes has been examined. When incorporated into unilamellar liposomes made from phosphatidylcholine, the disaccharide residue of chitogiosyl-lipid adopts a random transbilayer orientation. Furthermore, no significant mobility in the transverse plane of the membrane (i.e. flip-flop) is detectable. Using both sealed total microsomes or isolated rough microsomes from hen oviduct, the topology of chitobiosyl-lipid after its biosynthesis in the membrane has been determined. The results suggest that, once formed, chitobiosyl-lipid is a relatively static component of the membrane and is oriented with its disaccharide residue facing the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum."

This dissociation factor is distinct from initiation factor eIF-3 and its chromatographic properties permit its separation from the known wheat germ initiation factors. Under certain conditions, eIF-6 stimulates the incorporation of amino acids into polypeptides in a partially fractionated wheat germ cell-free system. The eight-step purification procedure developed includes chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, Sephadex G-75, and hydroxyapatite and yields a dissociation factor more than 80% pure. The purified factor is composed of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of approximately 23,000 as determined by gel filtration chromatography and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It is an acidic protein which is heat labile and is inactivated by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide. The dissociation factor is much more effective in preventing the reassociation of 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits than in directly dissociating 80 S ribosomes. Like Escherichia coli IF-3, about 10 pmol of the dissociation factor are required to dissociate 1 pmol of ribosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1530070374,"Abstract Adenine nucleotide breakdown to nucleosides and purine bases was measured in cultures of human lymphoblastoid cells following: 1) the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation in the absence of glucose or 2) the addition of 2-deoxyglucose. A mutant cell line, deficient in adenosine kinase, in the presence of an adenosine deaminase inhibitor was used to measure utilization of the two pathways of AMP catabolism involving initial action of either purine 5'-nucleotidase or AMP deaminase. In such a system the appearance of adenosine induced by the oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor, rotenone, implies that approximately 70% of AMP breakdown occurs via dephosphorylation. By the same method, deamination accounts for 82% of AMP breakdown when 2-deoxyglucose is added. The occurrence of AMP dephosphorylation is not correlated with elevated concentrations of substrate or with decreased concentrations of the inhibitors of 5'-nucleotidase, ATP and ADP. Dephosphorylation occurs if, and only if, the adenylate energy charge decreases to about 0.6 in these experiments. In cultures deprived of glucose and oxygen, adenine nucleotide degradation via dephosphorylation results in recovery of normal energy charge values."
https://openalex.org/W1554043220,"In this report we present an initial determination of the biochemical defect present in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line selected for resistance to concanavalin A. Membranes of this mutant, B211, incorporated at least 10-fold less mannose from GDP-[14C]mannose into oligosaccharide-lipid than membranes of the wild type. In the presence of dolichol phosphate, membranes of the mutant and wild type exhibited similar rates of synthesis of number of early intermediates, namely, mannosylphosphoryldolichol, N-acetylglucosaminyl- and N,N'-diacetylchitobiosylpyrophosphoryldolichol, glucosylphosphoryldolichol, and mannosyloligosaccharide-lipid. The membranes of B211 did not incorporate glucose from UDP-[3H]glucose into oligosaccharide-lipid or protein. Comparison by gel filtration chromatography of oligosaccharides derived from the oligosaccharide-lipids of B211 and wild type cells labeled with [2-3H]mannose revealed that B211 cells incorporated little if any label into an oligosaccharide corresponding to the most excluded oligosaccharide labeled by wild type cells.

https://openalex.org/W1558220390,"A new bifunctional maleimide that contains a disulfide bond has been synthesized. This maleimide, dithiobis-N-ethylmaleimide (DTEM), like another bifunctional maleimide, o-phenylenebismaleimide, is about 500-fold more effective as an inhibitor of photophosphorylation than N-ethylmaleimide. Thylakoids must be illuminated in the presence of DTEM before the assay of phosphorylation for the inhibition to occur. Phosphoryalation in thylakoids treated with DTEM in the light is uncoupled and proton permeability of the treated thylakoids is enhanced. This uncoupling of photophosphorylation in thylakoids treated with DTEM can be reversed by thiol compounds. The addition of 50 mM dithiothreitol restores H+ uptake in thylakoids treated with DTEM in the light to control levels and partially reverses the inhibition of phosphorylation. Evidence is provided to show that DTEM cross-links groups within the gamma subunit of the coupling factor 1, and that the cross-link is broken by high concentrations of thiols. These results suggest that cross-linking is the cause for the increased proton permeability in thylakoids treated with bifunctional maleimides in the light."

https://openalex.org/W1670317903,"Physical-chemical studies of pyruvate carboxylase from Pseudomonas citronellolis demonstrate that the enzyme has an alpha 4 beta 4 structure. The individual polypeptides, alpha (Mr = 65,000) and beta (Mr = 54,000), were separated and isolated by preparative gel electrophoresis. Analysis of the relationship between Coomassie blue staining and protein quantity for each polypeptide indicated that the alpha and beta subunits are present in a 1:1 stoichiometry in the native enzyme. Determinations of the molecular weight of the protein by sedimentation equilibrium (Mr = 454,000), gel filtration analysis (Mr = 510,000), disc gel electrophoresis (Mr = 530,000), and mass measurement from the Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (Mr = 530,000) are consistent with the proposed alpha 4 beta 4 structure. Disc gel electrophoresis studies revealed that under certain circumstances the enzyme may dissociate to a smaller molecular weight species (Mr = 228,000). This dissociation phenomenon could explain the earlier reported observation of Taylor et al. ((1972) J. Biol. Chem 22, 7388-8390) that the enzyme had a molecular weight of 265,000. Evidence from electron microscopic studies shows that the three-dimensional structure of this enzyme is quite distinct from other species of pyruvate carboxylase. The enzyme does not show the typical rhombic appearance which has been noted for chicken liver, sheep liver, and yeast pyruvate carboxylase."

It has been found that in these media the rate of hybrid formation is markedly affected by pH and decreases by an order of magnitude between pH 7.3 and 8.3. At pH greater than 10, t = -40 degrees C, the hybrid between alpha 2 beta 2A and alpha 2 beta 2C is stable for several hours.

https://openalex.org/W1505578898,"ATP-induced endocytosis in human erythrocyte ghosts has been studied, and a procedure for the isolation of the endocytotic vesicles is described. Under isotonic conditions and 37 degrees C, optimal endocytosis occurs with concentrations of 4 to 10 mM MgATP. Within 30 min, up to 45% of the membrane is removed from the surface and converted into sealed inside-out vesicles. Local anesthetics, such as chlorpromazine, potentiate ATP-induced endocytosis in ghosts. Forcing cells containing endocytotic vesicles through a hypodermic needle leads to the exclusive fragmentation of the outermost plasma membrane. The endocytosed vesicles can then be separated from these fragments by centrifugation on a gradient of dextran T70. Biochemical analyses indicate that endocytotic vesicles contain full complements of the major membrane proteins (i.e. also spectrin and actin), common phospholipids, fatty acids, and cholesterol. Furthermore, they exhibit a fully intact spectrin component 2 phosphorylation machinery. In contrast, MgATPase activity is largely excluded from these vesicles. The novel inside-out vesicles described have properties different from those of previously analyzed fragments of the erythrocyte membrane. They will permit a detailed study of a native spectrin-actin network now exposed to the outside."

The reaction is reversible in the presence of coenzyme A and has an equilibrium constant of 0.040. The product is an anhydride that is an analog of the intermediate that has been postulated in the normal catalytic pathway; it is inactive because coenzyme A does not react with the acyl group of the hydroxamic acid. The equilibrium constant for formation of the anhydride from the thil ester of enzyme and methyl 3-mercaptopropionate is 75 times larger than the equilibrium constant of 2.2 for the formation of N,O-diacetylhydroxylamine from acetohydroxamic acid and acetyl-CoA. This shows that the enzyme stabilizes the anhydride at the active site by at least -2.6 kcal mol-1. Succinomonohydroxamic acid reacts with enzyme-CoA as both a substrate and an inactivator, with relative rate constants of 25:1. The inactivation is irreversible, indicating that the enzyme provides a larger stabilization of at least -5.9 kcal mol-1 for the anhydride of an analog of the specific substrate, succinate. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the enzyme stabilizes an anhydride that is formed at the active site during turnover of normal substrates through a stepwise reaction mechanism."

The defining feature of enzymic memory is the occurrence of different rates of transfer for a common transferable group from the substituted enzymes obtained with different donor substrates. Memory behavior was previously demonstrated for both the bovine and human liver rhodaneses (EC 2.8.1.1). Steady state kinetic tests for enzymic memory have now been done with ascorbate oxidase (EC 1.10.3.3) and aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1). The results were positive with ascorbate oxidase, which showed an oxygen reactivity ratio of 1:20:300 for the reduced enzymes obtained with reductate, araboascorbate, and ascorbate, respectively. Results were negative for the aminotransferase tested with the alternate donors glutamate and cysteine sulfinate, with oxaloacetate as the common acceptor. The structural basis of the ascorbate oxidase results was probed by comparison of both the ultraviolet absorption and fluorescence spectra of the oxidized enzyme with those of the reduced forms obtained with ascorbate and reductate.

Analysis of these curves indicates that, from 0.05 to 0.80 mM bile salt, surface structure is dependent only on the surface concentration of the diglyceride. The limiting areas for dicaprin in the presence and absence of bile salt were about 38 A2/molecule. Subjecting the monolayers to hydrolysis by pancreatic lipase yielded kinetic data which, together with the physical studies, support a model for monolayer glyceride molecules undergoing discrete changes of state. In the absence of bile salt, the relatively expanded state exhibits an area of 75 A2/diglyceride molecule and is not a substrate for pancreatic lipase B. The more condensed state exhibits an area of 38 A2/diglyceride molecule and is hydrolyzed at a rate proportional to its concentration in the monolayer.

The spectra of ferric low spin derivatives of the isolated subunits were approximately superimposable on the corresponding hemoglobin spectra. On the other hand, the high spin spectra of the isolated subunits were greatly different from each other. The spectral anomaly in the ferric high spin complexes of the isolated beta subunit were interpreted to indicate other structural change than the hemichrome formation in the beta heme pocket. Difference in the subunit association effect between the high and low spin complexes of the isolated beta subunit was interpreted on the basis of a conformational change of the apoprotein dependent on the spin state of the beta heme iron."

Tyrosine 119 was identified as the residue most susceptible to iodination. There was no difference in susceptibility to iodination of N-DSK (A alpha 1-51, B beta 1-118, gamma 1-78)2, Ho1-DSK (first hydrophobic disulfide knot), and Hi2-DSK (second hydrophobic disulfide knot). Tyrosines 18 and 32 of the gamma chain of N-DSK were not significantly iodinated in fibrinogen, but tyrosines 1 and 68 were labeled, as was the tyrosine of the A alpha chain. The data indicate that there are regions of the hydrophobic disulfide knot, Ho1-DSK, which are surface-oriented. The distribution of iodine as mono- and diiodotyrosine in N-DSK and Ho1-DSK reflected the percentage (83 and 17, respectively) found in iodinated fibrinogen from which these fragments were prepared. In contrast the segments of the B beta chain extending beyond Met118 contained 46% of the iodine in diiodotyrosine, while the A alpha chain fragment, Hi2-DSK, contained 28% as diiodotyrosine. No significant iodination of histidine was detected."
