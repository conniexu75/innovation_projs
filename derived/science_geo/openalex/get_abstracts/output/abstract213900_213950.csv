https://openalex.org/W1987674015,"NITROSAMINES could be formed in cigarette smoke by reactions between secondary amines and oxides of nitrogen1,2. Several secondary amines, including anabasine, nornicotine, dimethylamine, diethylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine and proline, have been detected in cigarette smoke, which also contains about 200 parts per million of oxides of nitrogen (as the sum of NO and NO2) (refs. 3 and 4). The nitrosamine derivatives of some of these amines have already been shown to be carcinogenic5,6. We have reported that nitrosoanabasine administered in the drinking water induced benign and malignant tumours of the œsophagus of rats1. In parallel with these biological investigations, attempts have been made to detect nitrosoanabasine and nitrosonornicotine in cigarette smoke. So far these attempts have not been successful, although methods capable of detecting small amounts (for example, 5 µg) of specific nitrosamines have been developed1. Lack of success may be due either to instability of nitrosamines under the conditions prevailing in cigarette smoke or to interference in their detection by other constituents of the smoke. Nitrosoanabasine could not be detected in cigarette smoke condensates to which it had been deliberately added nor in the smoke of cigarettes which had been impregnated with the substance before smoking. If these negative results are due to instability of the nitrosamines, the possibility of their biological importance is only ruled out if their half-lives are very short. Further investigations into these problems are in progress."

https://openalex.org/W2092607709,"IN the course of investigations on MG positive blood samples with an anti-N serum, A.P.1, which, when used undiluted at room temperature, agglutinates NN but not MN red cells, attention was directed to a blood donor, Mrs. E. W.-K., whose cells were being used as a control: Mrs. W. had previously been grouped as M− N+, and her genotype was therefore thought to be NN, but her cells, contrary to expectation, were not agglutinated by serum A.P., which suggested that her true genotype was heterozygous rather than homozygous. Strong support for this was obtained when it was found that the red cells of Mrs. W.'s daughter gave the reactions M+ N−, since these are usually interpreted as representing the genotype MM, which, if it were the daughter's true genotype, would exclude Mrs. W.'s maternity. Such an exclusion, however, is not supported by the other blood groups of mother and daughter (and of Mr. W.), and it is rendered highly improbable by the fact that the daughter's cells, when tested with suitable anti-M sera, give a ‘single dose’ of M."

https://openalex.org/W2093661756,"WHEN bacteria are sprayed into the air their ability to survive depends on a large number of factors. The usual criterion for deciding if they are alive or dead depends on the appearance of visible colonies on an agar plate after the organisms have been recovered from the air and subjected to certain laboratory handling techniques. Since, by this method, it is usually difficult or impossible to determine the cause of death, it would be an advantage to be able to distinguish between death resulting from a breakdown of the cell's productive capacity (for example, its enzyme systems) or loss of its reproductive power (for example, nucleoprotein integrity). Attempts have been made to produce a laboratory technique enabling this differentiation to be made. The principle is to label the organisms with a suitable phage. Following aerosolization and recovery of the cells a comparison is made between the degree of lysis of the test cells (containing phage) and the survival of control (phage-free) cells. If the extent of lysis in the test cells is different from the survival-level of control cells then deductions can be made as to whether death is attributable to failure of the cell's productive or reproductive powers. The argument is best demonstrated by example."

https://openalex.org/W1978954152,"ALTHOUGH the α-amino-N content of human peripheric venous blood in health and liver disease is well known, the amino-acid content of the hepatic venous blood has been investigated only in the lower animals. Comparative quantitative analyses of peripheric and hepatic venous blood of human beings have not been carried out. Such analyses could clarify the protein synthesis in the liver. The differences between the inflow of amino-acids by the portal vein and hepatic artery, and as an analogue to this, peripheral circulation on one hand and the excretion of amino-acids by the hepatic vein on the other, are a partial measurement for the protein synthesis from amino-acids by the liver."

https://openalex.org/W2027617152,"THE papers by McKay et al.1–3, the recent publications by Bartone4, and others5, suggest that interest is increasing in embryological histochemistry. Consequently, it was felt it would be of value to note briefly the aortic histochemical polysaccharide investigations made on 12 human embryos ranging from 2.5 to 20.0 mm, crown-rump length. Serial sections from 10 per cent buffered formalin-fixed material, prepared by the paraffin process, were made from normal embryos of 2.5, 3.0, 5.5, 5.6, 6.5, 6.6, 10.0, 13.0, 14.4, 17.0, 19.0, and 20.0 mm, crown-rump measurements. The bulk of the embryos were obtained incident to hysterectomies with two of the older specimens coming from spontaneous abortions. The sections were serially stained for examination by the following microtechnical6 and histochemical techniques7: (1) hæmotoxylin and eosin; (2) Goldner connective tissue stain; (3) periodic acid–Foot stain for reticular tissues; (4) orcein elastic tissue stain; (5) Best carmine method for glycogen (diastase controlled); (6) original and Rinehart–Abu'l Haj modification of the Hale colloidal iron procedure for acid polysaccharides; (7) alcian blue method for acid polysaccharides; (8) McManus periodic acid–Schiff technique for neutral polysaccharides; (9) catalysed glacial acetic acid lead tetraacetate procedure, also for neutral polysaccharides. Metachromatic localizations8 were used, but not for the entire series. In the light of the form of fixation and the routine mounting, it was felt best not to include these sections in this discussion (these localizations resembled those obtained with the alcian blue technique). It was felt that this series of methods would adequately disclose the polysaccharide picture in the developing aorta and the relationship of these localizations to the forming connective tissue components of the embryonic vessel wall."
