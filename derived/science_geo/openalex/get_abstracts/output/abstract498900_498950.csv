https://openalex.org/W1971059614,"α-Synuclein (αSyn) aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction both contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD). Although recent studies have suggested that mitochondrial association of αSyn may disrupt mitochondrial function, it is unclear what aggregation state of αSyn is most damaging to mitochondria and what conditions promote or inhibit the effect of toxic αSyn species. Because the neuronal populations most vulnerable in PD are characterized by large cytosolic Ca(2+) oscillations that burden mitochondria, we examined mitochondrial Ca(2+) stress in an in vitro system comprising isolated mitochondria and purified recombinant human αSyn in various aggregation states. Using fluorimetry to simultaneously measure four mitochondrial parameters, we observed that soluble, prefibrillar αSyn oligomers, but not monomeric or fibrillar αSyn, decreased the retention time of exogenously added Ca(2+), promoted Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial swelling and depolarization, and accelerated cytochrome c release. Inhibition of the permeability transition pore rescued these αSyn-induced changes in mitochondrial parameters. Interestingly, the mitotoxic effects of αSyn were specifically dependent upon both electron flow through complex I and mitochondrial uptake of exogenous Ca(2+). Our results suggest that soluble prefibrillar αSyn oligomers recapitulate several mitochondrial phenotypes previously observed in animal and cell models of PD: complex I dysfunction, altered membrane potential, disrupted Ca(2+) homeostasis, and enhanced cytochrome c release. These data reveal how the association of oligomeric αSyn with mitochondria can be detrimental to the function of cells with high Ca(2+)-handling requirements."

https://openalex.org/W1973049378,"Expression of multiple reporter or effector transgenes in the same cell from a single construct is increasingly necessary in various experimental paradigms. The discovery of short, virus-derived peptide sequences that mediate a ribosome-skipping event enables generation of multiple separate peptide products from one mRNA. Here we describe methods and vectors to facilitate easy production of polycistronic-like sequences utilizing these 2A peptides tailored for expression in Drosophila both in vitro and in vivo. We tested the separation efficiency of different viral 2A peptides in cultured Drosophila cells and in vivo and found that the 2A peptides from porcine teschovirus-1 (P2A) and Thosea asigna virus (T2A) worked best. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we used the P2A peptide to co-express the red fluorescent protein tdTomato and the genetically-encoded calcium indicator GCaMP5G in larval motorneurons. This technique enabled ratiometric calcium imaging with motion correction allowing us to record synaptic activity at the neuromuscular junction in an intact larval preparation through the cuticle. The tools presented here should greatly facilitate the generation of 2A peptide-mediated expression of multiple transgenes in Drosophila."

Because a modulation of GPR55 activity by cannabinoids has been suggested, we analyzed whether this receptor participates in cannabinoid effects on cancer cells. Here we show that CB2R and GPR55 form heteromers in cancer cells, that these structures possess unique signaling properties, and that modulation of these heteromers can modify the antitumoral activity of cannabinoids in vivo. These findings unveil the existence of previously unknown signaling platforms that help explain the complex behavior of cannabinoids and may constitute new targets for therapeutic intervention in oncology.

G protein-coupled receptors participate in the control of many different physiological processes, and their deregulation contributes to numerous human diseases (1.Dorsam R.T. Gutkind J.S.

Rev. 2010; 62: 588-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). They are part of the endocannabinoid system, which consists at least of these two receptors, their endogenous ligands (the endocannabinoids), and the enzymes that produce and metabolize these signaling lipids (3.Pertwee R.G. Howlett A.C. Abood M.E. Alexander S.P. Di Marzo V. Elphick M.R. Greasley P.J. Hansen H.S. Kunos G. Mackie K. Mechoulam R. Ross R.A.

Rev. 2006; 58: 389-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been described that cannabinoids, in most cases via CB1R and/or CB2R, direct cells toward proliferation, differentiation, or death, depending on the cell type and its specific context (5.Guzmán M. Sánchez C. Galve-Roperh I. Cannabinoids and cell fate.Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 95: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In tumor cells in particular, these compounds usually produce proliferation-inhibiting and death-inducing effects both in vitro and in vivo (6.Velasco G. Sánchez C. Guzmán M. Towards the use of cannabinoids as antitumour agents.Nat Rev Cancer. 2012; 12: 436-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), making them promising therapeutic options for the management of cancer. More recently, another G protein-coupled receptor, G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55), has been related to cannabinoids (7.Brown A.J. Novel cannabinoid receptors.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In this case, the pharmacology of the receptor is controversial, and, although some authors have reported cannabinoid actions via GPR55, to date, this receptor does not formally belong to the cannabinoid receptor family (8.Ross R.A. The enigmatic pharmacology of GPR55.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2009; 30: 156-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Several publications support that lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), another signaling lipid, is a putative GPR55 endogenous ligand (9.Oka S. Nakajima K. Yamashita A. Kishimoto S. Sugiura T.

Receptors and channels targeted by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and antagonists.Curr. Med. Chem. 2010; 17: 1360-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Like its close relatives CB1R and CB2R, GPR55 has been implicated in the control of cancer cell fate (11.Henstridge C.M. Balenga N.A. Kargl J. Andradas C. Brown A.J. Irving A. Sanchez C. Waldhoer M. Minireview: recent developments in the physiology and pathology of the lysophosphatidylinositol-sensitive receptor GPR55.Mol. Endocrinol. 2011; 25: 1835-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Specifically, this receptor promotes cancer cell proliferation both in cell cultures and in animal models of cancer (12.Andradas C. Caffarel M.M. Pérez-Gómez E. Salazar M. Lorente M. Velasco G.

However, the mechanistic details behind these effects remain unclear, in part because of the lack of clarity regarding the pharmacology of the receptor. type 1 cannabinoid receptor type 2 cannabinoid receptor lysophosphatidylinositol bioluminescence resonance energy transfer Renilla luciferase proximity ligation assay dynamic mass redistribution Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol pertussis toxin cholera toxin 4-[4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(4-methylphenyl)-6-oxo-1H,4H,5H,6H-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazol-5-yl] benzoic acid forskolin analysis of variance. The classical pharmacological paradigm associating one ligand with one receptor and one receptor with one signaling pathway is being replaced with the view that G protein-coupled receptor-receptor interactions are an important mechanism that can modulate the pharmacological properties of each protomer (15.Rozenfeld R. Devi L.A. Receptor heteromerization and drug discovery.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2010; 31: 124-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Here we aimed to determine whether CB2R and GPR55, two receptors that are overexpressed in most human tumors and control cancer cell fate (6.Velasco G. Sánchez C. Guzmán M. Towards the use of cannabinoids as antitumour agents.Nat Rev Cancer. 2012; 12: 436-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 12.Andradas C. Caffarel M.M. Pérez-Gómez E. Salazar M. Lorente M.

HEK293 AD cells stably expressing CB2R (HEK-CB2) or HA-GPR55 (HEK-GPR55) or coexpressing both receptors (HEK-CB2-GPR55) were developed as described previously (16.Balenga N.A. Aflaki E. Kargl J.

All HEK293-derived cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, minimal essential medium non-essential amino acid solution (1/100), and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen) in the presence of the corresponding selection antibiotic (0.2 mg/ml of zeocin for HEK-CB2 cells, 0.3 mg/ml of G418 for HEK-GPR55 cells, or 0.2 mg/ml of zeocin and 0.3 mg/ml of G418 for HEK-CB2-GPR55 cells).

Human glioblastoma T98G cells endogenously expressing CB2R and GPR55 (at similar levels as BT474 cells)7 or stably transfected with selective CB2R or GPR55 shRNAs (Genecopoeia, Rockville, MD) and selected by FACS were grown in DMEM supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, minimal essential medium non-essential amino acid solution (1/100), and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS in the presence of the corresponding selection antibiotic (5 μg/ml puromycin for T98G-shGPR55 and T98G-shCB2). For transient transfections, HEK293 and BT474 cells were transfected with the corresponding fusion protein cDNA by the PEI (Sigma) method (18.González S. Rangel-Barajas C. Peper M. Lorenzo R. Moreno E. Ciruela F. Borycz J. Ortiz J. Lluís C. Franco R. McCormick P.J. Volkow N.D. Rubinstein M. Floran B. Ferré S.

Psychiatry. 2012; 17: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For BRET, GPR55-Rluc, CB2R-YFP, and Ghrelin 1a receptor-YFP fusion proteins were obtained as follows. The human cDNAs for CB2R, GPR55, or the Ghrelin 1a receptor were cloned into pcDNA3.1 and amplified without their stop codons using sense and antisense primers harboring unique EcoRI and BamHI sites for CB2R or the ghrelin receptor or harboring HindIII and BamHI for GPR55. The amplified fragments were subcloned to be in-frame with Renilla luciferase (Rluc) into the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites of the pcDNA3.1-RLuc vector (pRLuc-N1, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or the pEYFP-N1 vector (enhanced yellow variant of GFP, Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) to generate the plasmids that express proteins fused to RLuc or YFP on the C-terminal end (GPR55-RLuc, CB2R-YFP, and Ghrelin 1a receptor-YFP). The expression of the constructs was tested as described previously (19.Callén L. Moreno E. Barroso-Chinea P. Moreno-Delgado D. Cortés A. Mallol J. Casadó V. Lanciego J.L. Franco R. Lluis C. Canela E.I. McCormick P.J. Cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 form functional heteromers in brain.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 20851-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). HEK293 or BT474 cells were transiently cotransfected with a constant amount of cDNA encoding for proteins fused to Rluc as a BRET donor and with increasing amounts of the cDNA corresponding to proteins fused to YFP as a BRET acceptor. The fusion protein expression and BRET values were quantified as described previously (20.Carriba P. Navarro G. Ciruela F. Ferré S. Casadó V. Agnati L. Cortés A. Mallol J. Fuxe K. Canela E.I. Lluís C. Franco R. Detection of heteromerization of more than two proteins by sequential BRET-FRET.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) using a Mithras LB 940 that allows the integration of the signals detected in the short wavelength filter at 485 nm (440–500 nm) and the long wavelength filter at 530 nm (510–590 nm) (20.Carriba P. Navarro G. Ciruela F. Ferré S. Casadó V. Agnati L. Cortés A. Mallol J. Fuxe K. Canela E.I. Lluís C. Franco R. Detection of heteromerization of more than two proteins by sequential BRET-FRET.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The net BRET is defined as [(long wavelength emission)/(short wavelength emission)] − Cf, where Cf corresponds to [(long wavelength emission)/(short wavelength emission)] for the donor construct expressed alone in the same experiment. Data were fitted to a non-linear regression equation, assuming a single phase saturation curve with GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). BRET is expressed as milliBRET units (net BRET × 1000). In saturation curves, the relative amount of BRET is given as a function of 100 × the ratio between the fluorescence of the acceptor (YFP) and the luciferase activity of the donor (Rluc). Cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS containing 20 mm glycine, permeabilized with the same buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100, and washed successively with PBS. CB2R-GPR55 heteromers were detected using the Duolink II in situ PLA detection kit (Olink, Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden). After 1 h of incubation at 37°C with the blocking solution in a preheated humidity chamber, cells were incubated overnight in the antibody dilution medium with a mixture of equal amounts of mouse anti-HA antibody (1:100, Sigma) or rabbit anti-GPR55 antibody (1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) coupled directly to a DNA minus chain to detect HA-GPR55 or endogenous GPR55 and rabbit anti-CB2R antibody (1:100, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) coupled directly to a DNA plus chain. Cells were washed with wash buffer A at room temperature and incubated in a preheated humidity chamber for 30 min at 37°C with the ligation solution (Duolink II ligation stock, 1:5, and Duolink II ligase, 1:40) to induce annealing and ligation of the two DNA probes. Amplification was done with the Duolink II detection reagents red kit, which contains fluorescence nucleotides. After exhaustive washing at room temperature with wash buffer B, cells were mounted using mounting medium with DAPI. The samples were observed under a Leica SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). Red fluorescent images were processed with ImageJ software. PLA requires that both receptors be close enough to allow the two different antibody-DNA probes to be able to ligate (<17 nm) (21.Söderberg O. Leuchowius K.J. Gullberg M. Jarvius M. Weibrecht I.

If the receptors are within sufficient proximity, a punctate fluorescent signal can be detected by confocal microscopy. The agonist-induced cell global signaling signature was determined by label-free technology measuring the DMR using an EnSpire® multimode plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (23.Schröder R. Janssen N. Schmidt J. Kebig A. Merten N. Hennen S. Müller A. Blättermann S. Mohr-Andrä M. Zahn S. Wenzel J. Smith N.J. Gomeza J. Drewke C. Milligan G. Mohr K. Kostenis E. Deconvolution of complex G protein-coupled receptor signaling in live cells using dynamic mass redistribution measurements.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Refractive waveguide grating optical biosensors, integrated in 384-well microplates, allowed measurements of changes in local optical density in a detection zone up to 150 nm above the surface of the sensor. Cellular mass movements induced upon receptor activation were detected by illuminating the underside of the biosensor with polychromatic light and measured as changes in wavelength of the reflected monochromatic light that is a function of the index of refraction. The magnitude of this wavelength shift (in picometers) is directly proportional to the amount of cell movement. Briefly, 24 h before the assay, cells (10,000 cells/well) were seeded in 384-well sensor microplates and cultured to obtain 70–80% confluent monolayers. Before the assay, cells were washed twice with assay buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.15)) and incubated for 2 h in assay buffer with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide in the reader at 24 °C. Thereafter, the sensor plate was scanned, and a baseline optical signature was recorded before adding the test compounds dissolved in assay buffer containing 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide. DMR responses were monitored for at least 2000 s. Kinetic results were analyzed using EnSpire workstation software version 4.10. Homogeneous time-resolved (TR) fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) assays were performed using the Lance Ultra cAMP kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on the basis of the competitive displacement of a europium chelate-labeled cAMP tracer bound to a specific antibody conjugated to acceptor beads. We first established the optimal cell density for an appropriate fluorescent signal. This was done by measuring the TR-FRET signal, determined as a function of forskolin concentration using different cell densities. The forskolin dose-response curves were related to the cAMP standard curve to establish which cell density provides a response that covers most of the dynamic range of the cAMP standard curve. Cells (1000 cells/well) were pretreated with the antagonists or the corresponding vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) in white ProxiPlate 384-well microplates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 25 °C for 20 min and stimulated with agonists for 15 min before adding 0.5 μm forskolin or vehicle and incubating for an additional 15-min period. Fluorescence at 665 nm was analyzed on a PHERAstar Flagship microplate reader equipped with a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer optical module (BMG Lab Technologies, Offenburg, Germany). Cells (35,000 cells/well) seeded in 96-well poly-d-lysine-coated plates (Sigma-Aldrich) were pretreated at 25 °C for 20 min with the antagonists and stimulated for an additional 7 min with the indicated agonists. Phosphorylation was determined in white ProxiPlate 384-well microplates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by α-screen bead-based technology using the amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the Enspire multimode plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Phosphorylation is expressed in arbitrary units, ALPHA counts, as measured by light emission at 520–620 nm by the acceptor beads. To evaluate phospho-ERK-1/2 expression in tumors, a Western blot analysis was performed. Tumor lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Blots were incubated with anti-phospho-ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), anti-ERK (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies. Luminograms were obtained with the Amersham Biosciences enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare), and the densitometric analysis was performed with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). HEK-GPR55 cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, detached from dishes by incubation with a buffer containing 5.6 mm glucose, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.4), and collected by centrifugation (500 × g) at 4 °C. The pellets were then resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.2 mm MgSO4, 0.38 mm KH2PO4, 0.61 mm Na2HPO4, and 0.5% PMSF (pH 7.4)) and homogenized by vortexing. HEK-GPR55 membranes were isolated by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 20 min), and pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). Protein concentration was determined by detergent compatible protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Membranes were stored at −80 °C until used for analysis of LPI-induced stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding. For this analysis, we followed a procedure published previously (24.Mato S. Vidal R. Castro E. Díaz A. Pazos A. Valdizán E.M. Long-term fluoxetine treatment modulates cannabinoid type 1 receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in the rat prefrontal cortex through 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A receptor-dependent mechanisms.Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 77: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in which cell membranes (20 μg of protein/ml) were incubated for 120 min at 30 °C in assay buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 μm GDP, and 1 mg/ml BSA (pH 7.4)) containing 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS and increasing concentrations of LPI (10−10-10−5 m) in the presence or absence of 10−6 m Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, The Health Concept, Richelbach, Germany). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled GTPγS. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration performed by a Harvester Filtermate (PerkinElmer) with Filtermate A GF/C filters. Filters were rinsed nine times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mg/ml BSA (pH 7.4)) and left to dry, and melt-on scintillation pads (Meltilex A, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) were melted onto them. The bound radioactivity was quantified by a liquid scintillation spectrophotometer (Wallac MicroBeta Trilux, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Results were normalized as percent change over basal level (set at 100%) and corresponded to three separate experiments, each performed in triplicate. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis of sigmoidal dose-response curves using GraphPad Prism 5.01. Tumors were induced in 6-week-old athymic male mice (n = 6/experimental group; Harlan Interfauna Iberica, Barcelona, Spain) by subcutaneous injection of 10 × 106 T98G human glioblastoma cells in PBS supplemented with 0.1% glucose. Half of the animals were treated with double-stranded RNA duplexes for human GPR55 (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpools) from Dharmacon-Thermo Scientific (Lafayette, CO). The sequences were 5′-GAAUUCCGCAUGAACAUCAUU-3′, 5′-GAGAAACAGCUUUAUCGUAUU-3′, 5′-AAGAACAGGUGGCCCGAUUUU-3′, and 5′-GCUACUACUUUGUCAUCAAUU-3′. The other half was treated with a non-targeted control siRNA from Applied Biosystems-Ambion (Austin, TX). The sequence was 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUtt-3′. siRNA was mixed with AteloGene (Koken, Tokyo, Japan) and injected locally when tumors reached approximately 200 mm3 (day 1) and on day 7. At the same time, each group was treated peritumorally with THC (1.5 or 15 mg/kg/day) (The Health Concept) or the corresponding vehicle (PBS supplemented with 5% BSA) for 15 days. Tumors were measured routinely with external calipers, and the volume was calculated as (4π/3) × (width/2)2 × (length/2). At the end of the treatment, animals were sacrificed, and tumors were collected. To analyze the possible molecular interaction between CB2R and GPR55, BRET experiments were performed. HEK293 cells expressing a fixed amount of GPR55-Rluc as the BRET donor and increasing amounts of CB2R-YFP as the BRET acceptor generated a hyperbolic and saturable BRET signal (Fig. 1A) with a BRETmax of 257 ± 18 milliBRET units and a BRET50 of 7.3 ± 1.2 that was not evident in cells expressing equivalent amounts of GPR55-Rluc and Ghrelin 1a receptor-YFP as a negative control (Fig. 1A). These results support that CB2R and GPR55 form heteromers in cotransfected cells. We then analyzed whether the formation of these complexes alters the signaling properties of the individual protomers. To test which G proteins are coupled to the receptors when expressed alone, we used a label-free approach that measures DMR in the bottom 150 nm of a cell monolayer through detection of changes in light diffraction (23.Schröder R. Janssen N. Schmidt J. Kebig A. Merten N. Hennen S. Müller A. Blättermann S. Mohr-Andrä M. Zahn S. Wenzel J. Smith N.J. Gomeza J. Drewke C. Milligan G. Mohr K. Kostenis E.

Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In HEK293 cells expressing CB2R only (HEK-CB2), the CB2R-selective agonist HU-308 produced a robust DMR signal (Fig. 1B) that was sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTX) but not to cholera toxin (CTX) (Fig. 1C). This is in line with many previous reports showing coupling of CB2R to Gi heterotrimeric proteins (3.Pertwee R.G. Howlett A.C. Abood M.E. Alexander S.P. Di Marzo V. Elphick M.R. Greasley P.J. Hansen H.S. Kunos G. Mackie K. Mechoulam R. Ross R.A. International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology: LXXIX: cannabinoid receptors and their ligands: beyond CB and CB.Pharmacol. Rev. 2010; 62: 588-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). In HEK293 cells expressing GPR55 only (HEK-GPR55), we observed that the GPR55 agonist LPI produced a strong response (Fig. 1D) that was insensitive to CTX or PTX treatment (Fig. 1E), suggestive of coupling to G proteins other than Gi and Gs, as reported previously (8.Ross R.A. The enigmatic pharmacology of GPR55.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2009; 30: 156-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Importantly, neither LPI nor HU-308 showed any activity in non-transfected cells (Fig. 1J), and both CB2R and GPR55 agonists and antagonists showed selectivity for their respective receptors with no agonist activation or antagonist blockade of the partner receptor in single receptor-expressing cells (Fig. 1, B and D). Interestingly, in HEK293 cells overexpressing both receptors (HEK-CB2-GPR55), we observed a similar coupling to G proteins but a different pharmacological behavior. In these cells, LPI induced a robust DMR signal (Fig. 1F) that was insensitive to CTX or PTX treatment (Fig. 1, H and I), again suggesting coupling to G proteins different from Gi and Gs, and HU-308 induced a signal (Fig. 1G) that was blocked by PTX but not by CTX (Fig. 1, H and I), indicating a Gi coupling. Surprisingly, the signal induced by LPI was completely blocked by the CB2R antagonist AM630 (Fig. 1F), and the signaling induced by HU-308 was blocked by the GPR55 antagonist 4-[4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(4-methylphenyl)-6-oxo-1H,4H,5H,6H-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazol-5-yl] benzoic acid (HBA) (Fig. 1G). This cross-antagonism phenomenon suggests that, through the heteromer, one receptor can be targeted by using the partner receptor antagonist. Because DMR experiments are indicative of global receptor signaling, we next investigated heteromer function in specific signaling pathways. In HEK-CB2 cells, HU-308 (Fig. 2A), but not LPI (Fig. 2B), prevented the increase in cAMP levels elicited by forskolin (FK), an effect that was blocked by PTX but not by CTX (Fig. 2A) and by AM630 but not by HBA (Fig. 2C). In HEK-GPR55 cells, LPI produced no effect on FK-induced cAMP levels (Fig. 2D), supporting coupling of this receptor to G proteins different from Gi or Gs. HU-308 did not induce any effect in these cells either (Fig. 2E). As observed in the label-free assays, HEK-CB2-GPR55 cells showed a different pharmacological behavior. HU-308 alone was still able to block the FK-induced cAMP increase through a PTX-sensitive mechanism (Fig. 1F). As expected in these cells, LPI was not able to increase or decrease (Fig. 1G) FK-stimulated cAMP levels. However, simultaneous activation of CB2R and GPR55 prevented HU-308 action (Fig. 1G), which is indicative of a negative cross-talk between both receptors. Moreover, in HEK-CB2-GPR55 cells, HU-308 effects on cAMP levels were blocked not only by AM630 but also by HBA (Fig. 1G). Similar negative cross-talk and cross-antagonism were detected in ERK-1/2 signaling. When expressed alone, activation of each receptor by its selective ligand resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in ERK-1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B). In cells expressing both receptors simultaneously, the activation of any of the protomers individua"
https://openalex.org/W2043295482,"Gap1, the yeast general amino acid permease, is a convenient model for studying how the intracellular traffic of membrane transporters is regulated. Present at the plasma membrane under poor nitrogen supply conditions, it undergoes ubiquitylation, endocytosis, and degradation upon activation of the TORC1 kinase complex in response to an increase in internal amino acids. This down-regulation is stimulated by TORC1-dependent phosphoinhibition of the Npr1 kinase, resulting in activation by dephosphorylation of the arrestin-like Bul1 and Bul2 adaptors recruiting the Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase to Gap1. We report here that Gap1 is also down-regulated when cells are treated with the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin or subjected to various stresses and that a lack of the Tco89 subunit of TORC1 causes constitutive Gap1 down-regulation. Both the Bul1 and Bul2 and the Aly1 and Aly2 arrestin-like adaptors of Rsp5 promote this down-regulation without undergoing dephosphorylation. Furthermore, they act via the C-terminal regions of Gap1 not involved in ubiquitylation in response to internal amino acids, whereas a Gap1 mutant altered in the N-terminal tail and resistant to ubiquitylation by internal amino acids is efficiently down-regulated under stress via the Bul and Aly adaptors. Although the Bul proteins mediate Gap1 ubiquitylation of two possible lysines, Lys-9 and Lys-16, the Aly proteins promote ubiquitylation of the Lys-16 residue only. This stress-induced pathway of Gap1 down-regulation targets other permeases as well, and it likely allows cells facing adverse conditions to retrieve amino acids from permease degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2100101522,"Numerous theoretical and empirical studies have shown that wildfire activity (e.g., area burned) at regional to global scales may be limited at the extremes of environmental gradients such as productivity or moisture. Fire activity, however, represents only one component of the fire regime, and no studies to date have characterized fire severity along such gradients. Given the importance of fire severity in dictating ecological response to fire, this is a considerable knowledge gap. For the western US, we quantify relationships between climate and the fire regime by empirically describing both fire activity and severity along two climatic water balance gradients, actual evapotranspiration (AET) and water deficit (WD), that can be considered proxies for fuel amount and fuel moisture, respectively. We also concurrently summarize fire activity and severity among ecoregions, providing an empirically based description of the geographic distribution of fire regimes. Our results show that fire activity in the western US increases with fuel amount (represented by AET) but has a unimodal (i.e., humped) relationship with fuel moisture (represented by WD); fire severity increases with fuel amount and fuel moisture. The explicit links between fire regime components and physical environmental gradients suggest that multivariable statistical models can be generated to produce an empirically based fire regime map for the western US. Such models will potentially enable researchers to anticipate climate-mediated changes in fire recurrence and its impacts based on gridded spatial data representing future climate scenarios."

Zinc is a known inhibitor of pMMO, but the details of zinc binding and the mechanism of inhibition are not understood. Metal binding and activity assays on membrane-bound pMMO from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) reveal that zinc inhibits pMMO at two sites that are distinct from the copper active site. The 2.6 Å resolution crystal structure of Methylocystis species strain Rockwell pMMO reveals two previously undetected bound lipids, and metal soaking experiments identify likely locations for the two zinc inhibition sites. The first is the crystallographic zinc site in the pmoC subunit, and zinc binding here leads to the ordering of 10 previously unobserved residues. A second zinc site is present on the cytoplasmic side of the pmoC subunit. Parallels between these results and zinc inhibition studies of several respiratory complexes suggest that zinc might inhibit proton transfer in pMMO."

This study examined the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a novel gasotransmitter, in the regulation of AR signaling as well as its mediation in androgen-independent cell growth in prostate cancer cells. Here we found that H2S inhibits cell proliferation of both androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and antiandrogen-resistant prostate cancer cells (LNCaP-B), with more significance on the latter, which was established by long term treatment of parental LNCaP cells with bicalutamide. The expression of cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), a major H2S-producing enzyme in prostate tissue, was reduced in both human prostate cancer tissues and LNCaP-B cells. LNCaP-B cells were resistant to bicalutamide-induced cell growth inhibition, and CSE overexpression could rebuild the sensitivity of LNCaP-B cells to bicalutamide. H2S significantly repressed the expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and TMPRSS2, two AR-targeted genes. In addition, H2S inhibited AR binding with PSA promoter and androgen-responsive element (ARE) luciferase activity. We further found that AR is post-translationally modified by H2S through S-sulfhydration. Mutation of cysteine 611 and cysteine 614 in the second zinc finger module of AR-DNA binding domain diminished the effects of H2S on AR S-sulfhydration and AR dimerization. These data suggest that reduced CSE/H2S signaling contributes to antiandrogen-resistant status, and sufficient level of H2S is able to inhibit AR transactivation and treat castration-resistant prostate cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2066535535,"Marine bacteria are the main consumers of freshly produced organic matter. Many enzymatic processes involved in the bacterial digestion of organic compounds were shown to be pH sensitive in previous studies. Due to the continuous rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration, seawater pH is presently decreasing at a rate unprecedented during the last 300 million years but the consequences for microbial physiology, organic matter cycling and marine biogeochemistry are still unresolved. We studied the effects of elevated seawater pCO2 on a natural plankton community during a large-scale mesocosm study in a Norwegian fjord. Nine Kiel Off-Shore Mesocosms for Future Ocean Simulations (KOSMOS) were adjusted to different pCO2 levels ranging initially from ca. 280 to 3000 µatm and sampled every second day for 34 days. The first phytoplankton bloom developed around day 5. On day 14, inorganic nutrients were added to the enclosed, nutrient-poor waters to stimulate a second phytoplankton bloom, which occurred around day 20. Our results indicate that marine bacteria benefit directly and indirectly from decreasing seawater pH. During the first phytoplankton bloom, 5–10% more transparent exopolymer particles were formed in the high pCO2 mesocosms. Simultaneously, the efficiency of the protein-degrading enzyme leucine aminopeptidase increased with decreasing pH resulting in up to three times higher values in the highest pCO2/lowest pH mesocosm compared to the controls. In general, total and cell-specific aminopeptidase activities were elevated under low pH conditions. The combination of enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis of organic matter and increased availability of gel particles as substrate supported up to 28% higher bacterial abundance in the high pCO2 treatments. We conclude that ocean acidification has the potential to stimulate the bacterial community and facilitate the microbial recycling of freshly produced organic matter, thus strengthening the role of the microbial loop in the surface ocean."

In order to evaluate the relationship of these SNPs and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk, we conducted a case-control study with 1109 ESCC patients and 1275 control subjects to examine the potential association of these pri/pre-miRNA polymorphisms with ESCC susceptibility. As a result, two SNPs were associated with a significant risk of ESCC.

https://openalex.org/W2061470990,"The magnetic interaction between two electrons is measured at the micrometre scale, exhibiting spin entanglement generation over 15 seconds of coherent evolution; varying the inter-electron separation shows a distance dependence consistent with the inverse-cube law. Every electron carries an intrinsic magnetic dipole moment, so any two electrons should therefore exert magnetic forces on one another. The forces involved are very small, and at atomic scale Coulomb interaction is dominant, so it is extremely difficult to observe the magnetic interaction. However, Shlomi Kotler et al. have now done just that, measuring the interaction between two electrons, in separate trapped strontium-88 ions. The two electrons exhibit spin entanglement generation over 15 seconds of coherent evolution, and by varying inter-electron separation the authors demonstrate distance dependence that is consistent with the known inverse-cube law. Electrons have an intrinsic, indivisible, magnetic dipole aligned with their internal angular momentum (spin). The magnetic interaction between two electronic spins can therefore impose a change in their orientation. Similar dipolar magnetic interactions exist between other spin systems and have been studied experimentally. Examples include the interaction between an electron and its nucleus and the interaction between several multi-electron spin complexes1,2,3,4,5. The challenge in observing such interactions for two electrons is twofold. First, at the atomic scale, where the coupling is relatively large, it is often dominated by the much larger Coulomb exchange counterpart1. Second, on scales that are substantially larger than the atomic, the magnetic coupling is very weak and can be well below the ambient magnetic noise. Here we report the measurement of the magnetic interaction between the two ground-state spin-1/2 valence electrons of two 88Sr+ ions, co-trapped in an electric Paul trap. We varied the ion separation, d, between 2.18 and 2.76 micrometres and measured the electrons’ weak, millihertz-scale, magnetic interaction as a function of distance, in the presence of magnetic noise that was six orders of magnitude larger than the magnetic fields the electrons apply on each other. The cooperative spin dynamics was kept coherent for 15 seconds, during which spin entanglement was generated, as verified by a negative measured value of −0.16 for the swap entanglement witness. The sensitivity necessary for this measurement was provided by restricting the spin evolution to a decoherence-free subspace that is immune to collective magnetic field noise. Our measurements show a d−3.0(4) distance dependence for the coupling, consistent with the inverse-cube law."
https://openalex.org/W2075474494,"Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is a widespread disease of amphibians responsible for population declines and extinctions. Some bacteria from amphibians' skins produce antimicrobial substances active against Bd. Supplementing populations of these cutaneous antifungal bacteria might help manage chytridiomycosis in wild amphibians. However, the activity of protective bacteria may depend upon environmental conditions. Biocontrol of Bd in nature thus requires knowledge of how environmental conditions affect their anti-Bd activity. For example, Bd-driven amphibian declines have often occurred at temperatures below Bd's optimum range. It is possible these declines occurred due to reduced anti-Bd activity of bacterial symbionts at cool temperatures. Better understanding of the effects of temperature on chytridiomycosis development could also improve risk evaluation for amphibian populations yet to encounter Bd. We characterized, at a range of temperatures approximating natural seasonal variation, the anti-Bd activity of bacterial symbionts from the skins of three species of rainforest tree frogs (Litoria nannotis, Litoria rheocola, and Litoria serrata). All three species declined during chytridiomycosis outbreaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s and have subsequently recovered to differing extents. We collected anti-Bd bacterial symbionts from frogs and cultured the bacteria at constant temperatures from 8 °C to 33 °C. Using a spectrophotometric assay, we monitored Bd growth in cell-free supernatants (CFSs) from each temperature treatment. CFSs from 11 of 24 bacteria showed reduced anti-Bd activity in vitro when they were produced at cool temperatures similar to those encountered by the host species during population declines. Reduced anti-Bd activity of metabolites produced at low temperatures may, therefore, partially explain the association between Bd-driven declines and cool temperatures. We show that to avoid inconsistent antifungal activity, bacteria evaluated for use in chytridiomycosis biocontrol should be tested over a range of environmental temperatures spanning those likely to be encountered in the field."

A prediction model was developed based on independent clinicopathological and miRNA covariates. The prognostic value of the model was further validated in a separate set of 41 TNBC patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2008.Only lymph node status was marginally significantly associated with poor prognosis of TNBC (P = 0.054), whereas other clinicopathological factors, including age, tumor size, histological grade, lymphovascular invasion, P53 status, Ki-67 index, and type of surgery, were not. The expression levels of miR-27b-3p, miR-107, and miR-103a-3p were significantly elevated in the metastatic group compared with the disease-free group (P value: 0.008, 0.005, and 0.050, respectively). The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that lymph node status and miR-27b-3p were independent predictors of poor prognosis (P value: 0.012 and 0.027, respectively). A logistic regression model was developed based on these two independent covariates, and the prognostic value of the model was subsequently confirmed in a separate validation set.

Recent studies reported that knockdown of miR-92a could attenuate ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial injury. In the present study, we examined the potential anti-apoptotic effects of miR-92a in a rat myocardiocyte cell line, and the possible role of Smad7 in such actions. Methodology and Results In a preliminary bioinformatic analysis, we identified SMAD family member 7 (Smad7) as a potential target for miR-92a. A luciferase reporter assay indeed demonstrated that miR-92a could inhibit Smad7 expression. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion was simulated in rat H9c2 cells with 24-h hypoxia followed by 12-h reoxygenation. Prior to hypoxia/reoxygenation, cells were transfected by miR-92a inhibitor. In some experiments, cells were co-transfected with siRNA-Smad7. The miR-92a inhibitor dramatically reduced the release of lactate dehydrogenase and malonaldehyde, and attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The miR-92a inhibitor increased SMAD7 protein level and decreased nuclear NF-κB p65 protein. Effects of the miR-92a inhibitor were attenuated by co-transfection with siRNA-Smad7. Conclusion Inhibiting miR-92a can attenuate myocardiocyte apoptosis induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation by targeting Smad7."

However, the role of autophagy in trabecular meshwork patho-physiology has not yet been examined in vivo in human ocular tissues. The purpose of the herein presented study is to evaluate autophagy occurrence in ex-vivo collected human trabecular meshwork specimens and to evaluate the relationship between autophagy, oxidative stress, and aging in this tissue. Fresh trabecular meshwork specimens were collected from 28 healthy corneal donors devoid of ocular pathologies and oxidative DNA damage, and LC3 and p62 protein expression analyzed. In a subset of 10 subjects, further to trabecular meshwork proteins, the amounts of cathepesin L and ubiquitin was analyzed by antibody microarray in aqueous humor. Obtained results demonstrate that autophagy activation, measured by LC3II/I ratio, is related with. oxidative damage occurrence during aging in human trabecular meshwork. The expression of autophagy marker p62 was lower in subjects older than 60 years as compared to younger subjects. These findings reflect the occurrence of an agedependent increase in the autophagy as occurring in the trabecular meshwork. Furthermore, we showed that aging promotes trabecular-meshwork senescence due to increased oxidative stress paralleled by autophagy increase. Indeed, both oxidative DNA damage and autophagy were more abundant in subjects older than 60 years. These findings shed new light on the role of oxidative damage and autophagy during trabecular-meshwork aging."

Recent evidence demonstrates that dysregulation of fat-derived hormones, also known as adipokines, is linked with the pathogenesis of obesity-related disorders including coronary artery disease (CAD). Here, we investigated whether circulating level of an adipokine C1q/TNF-related protein (CTRP) 1 is associated with the prevalence of CAD. Methods and Results Consecutive 76 male CAD patients were enrolled from inpatients that underwent coronary angiography. Sixty four healthy male subjects served as controls. Plasma CTRP1 concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CTRP1 levels were correlated positively with systolic blood pressure (BP) and triglyceride levels, and negatively with HDL cholesterol levels in all subjects. Plasma levels of CTRP1 were significantly higher in CAD patients than in control subjects (CAD: 443.3±18.6 ng/ml, control: 307.8±21.5 ng/ml, p<0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis with body mass index, systolic BP, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride, adiponectin and CTRP1 revealed that CTRP1 levels, together with systolic BP and HDL cholesterol, correlated with CAD. Conclusions Our data indicate the close association of high CTRP1 levels with CAD prevalence, suggesting that CTRP1 represents a novel biomarker for CAD."
https://openalex.org/W2003232860,"The first x-ray crystal structure has been solved for an activated transition-state analog-bound form II ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). This enzyme, from Rhodopseudomonas palustris, assembles as a unique hexamer with three pairs of catalytic large subunit homodimers around a central 3-fold symmetry axis. This oligomer arrangement is unique among all known Rubisco structures, including the form II homolog from Rhodospirillum rubrum. The presence of a transition-state analog in the active site locked the activated enzyme in a ""closed"" conformation and revealed the positions of critical active site residues during catalysis. Functional roles of two form II-specific residues (Ile(165) and Met(331)) near the active site were examined via site-directed mutagenesis. Substitutions at these residues affect function but not the ability of the enzyme to assemble. Random mutagenesis and suppressor selection in a Rubisco deletion strain of Rhodobacter capsulatus identified a residue in the amino terminus of one subunit (Ala(47)) that compensated for a negative change near the active site of a neighboring subunit. In addition, substitution of the native carboxyl-terminal sequence with the last few dissimilar residues from the related R. rubrum homolog increased the enzyme's kcat for carboxylation. However, replacement of a longer carboxyl-terminal sequence with termini from either a form III or a form I enzyme, which varied both in length and sequence, resulted in complete loss of function. From these studies, it is evident that a number of subtle interactions near the active site and the carboxyl terminus account for functional differences between the different forms of Rubiscos found in nature."
https://openalex.org/W1970880865,"Mutations in the gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are a common genetic cause of Parkinson disease, but the mechanisms whereby LRRK2 is regulated are unknown. Phosphorylation of LRRK2 at Ser910/Ser935 mediates interaction with 14-3-3. Pharmacological inhibition of its kinase activity abolishes Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding, and this effect is also mimicked by pathogenic mutations. However, physiological situations where dephosphorylation occurs have not been defined. Here, we show that arsenite or H2O2-induced stresses promote loss of Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation, which is reversed by phosphatase inhibition. Arsenite-induced dephosphorylation is accompanied by loss of 14-3-3 binding and is observed in wild type, G2019S, and kinase-dead D2017A LRRK2. Arsenite stress stimulates LRRK2 self-association and association with protein phosphatase 1α, decreases kinase activity and GTP binding in vitro, and induces translocation of LRRK2 to centrosomes. Our data indicate that signaling events induced by arsenite and oxidative stress may regulate LRRK2 function. Mutations in the gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are a common genetic cause of Parkinson disease, but the mechanisms whereby LRRK2 is regulated are unknown. Phosphorylation of LRRK2 at Ser910/Ser935 mediates interaction with 14-3-3. Pharmacological inhibition of its kinase activity abolishes Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding, and this effect is also mimicked by pathogenic mutations. However, physiological situations where dephosphorylation occurs have not been defined. Here, we show that arsenite or H2O2-induced stresses promote loss of Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation, which is reversed by phosphatase inhibition. Arsenite-induced dephosphorylation is accompanied by loss of 14-3-3 binding and is observed in wild type, G2019S, and kinase-dead D2017A LRRK2.

LRRK2 is constitutively phosphorylated at Ser910 and Ser935, and phosphorylation is required for binding of 14-3-3 proteins, which in turn control the cellular localization of LRRK2 (13Dzamko N.

Several pathogenic mutants, including R1441C and Y1699C, show markedly diminished phosphorylation at these sites and decreased 14-3-3 interaction (14Nichols R.J. Dzamko N. Morrice N.A. Campbell D.G.

Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity leads to decreased Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation, resulting in a concomitant decrease in 14-3-3 binding and inducing translocation of LRRK2 into discrete cytoplasmic pools (15Deng X.

This suggests a feedback loop whereby inhibition of active LRRK2 kinase alters activity of unidentified kinases or phosphatases, which impacts the phosphorylation status of LRRK2 itself. A recent study has suggested that Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation is mediated by IκB kinases in response to activation of the Toll-like receptor pathway, but this is not blocked by inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity (17Dzamko N. Inesta-Vaquera F. Zhang J. Xie C. Cai H. Arthur S. Tan L. Choi H. Gray N. Cohen P. Pedrioli P. Clark K. Alessi D.R.

These studies suggest the existence of diverse pathways that regulate LRRK2 phosphorylation status not related to its kinase activity, which remain largely unexplored (18Lobbestael E. Zhao J.

Oxidative stress is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of PD, with the parkinsonism-linked genes PARK2, PINK1, and DJ1 being associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased reactive oxygen species-linked cellular effects (reviewed in Ref. 19Gandhi S.

Dopaminergic cell loss, characteristic of PD, can be mimicked in vivo by exposure to toxins such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (20Korecka J.A. Eggers R. Swaab D.F. Bossers K.

LRRK2 has been linked to protection from mitochondrial stress through interaction with kinases of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (24Hsu C.H. Chan D. Greggio E. Saha S.

Neurochem. 2010; 112: 1593-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), whereas recent studies suggest that G2019S LRRK2 causes uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (25Papkovskaia T.D.

Based on these data, we hypothesized that LRRK2 is involved in the oxidative stress response and explored this using the oxidative stressor arsenite. We assessed changes in phosphorylation, self-association, kinase activity, GTP binding, and cellular localization of LRRK2 under arsenite stress. We found that both arsenite and H2O2-induced stress promoted the loss of LRRK2 phosphorylation at sites Ser910/Ser935 in stable inducible expression cell lines as well as of endogenous LRRK2 in a lymphoblastoid cell line, whereas this was rescued by inhibition of protein phosphatases. WT LRRK2 and the variants R1441C, D2017A (kinase-dead), and G2019S responded to oxidative stress in a similar manner with loss of constitutive phosphorylation and loss of 14-3-3 binding. Arsenite stress induced LRRK2 self-association as well as accumulation of very high molecular mass forms of LRRK2. Treatment with arsenite resulted in attenuation of kinase activity in LRRKtide phosphorylation and autophosphorylation assays and a decrease in LRRK2 binding to GTP in vitro. Arsenite stress also induced LRRK2 translocation to ubiquitin proteasomal centers localizing at centrosomes. Our data collectively support a role of oxidative stress in modulating LRRK2 activity and suggest a sequence of signaling events induced by arsenite stress. Inducible HEK-293T cell lines expressing different GFP LRRK2 variants were grown and cultured as described previously (14Nichols R.J. Dzamko N. Morrice N.A. Campbell D.G. Deak M. Ordureau A.

The 3×FLAG-tagged construct of LRRK2 in pCHMWS plasmid was a gift from Dr. J. M. Taymans (KU Leuven, Belgium) (27Civiero L. Vancraenenbroeck R. Belluzzi E. Beilina A. Lobbestael E. Reyniers L. Gao F.

Treatments with oxidative stressors were carried out with the described concentrations of sodium arsenite or H2O2 for 45 min. The LRRK2 inhibitor LRRK2-IN1 was used at 1 μm for 2 h. MG132, lactacystin, and nocodazole were used at 50 μm for 6 h. In the combination treatment experiments, cells were primed with IN-1 for 75 min or with MG132 or nocodazole for 5 h before the addition of arsenite for the last 45 min of the treatment. In the calyculin A experiments, cells were pretreated with 10 nm calyculin A for 15 min before the addition of arsenite, IN-1, or H2O2 and incubation for an additional 30 min. HEK-293T cells stably expressing GFP WT LRRK2 were transfected with 3×FLAG-LRRK2 variants using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.3% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce). Lysates were centrifuged at 21,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatants were analyzed for protein concentration (Pierce). 20 μg of total protein from each supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE for expression of the proteins in question. 400 μg of each sample was precleared with protein G beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 4 °C, and subsequently, GFP-LRRK2 was immunoprecipitated with Chromotek-GFP-Trap-agarose resin (Allele Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C. The GFP-agarose was gently washed six times with buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl (all from KD Medical), and 0.1% Triton X-100. The washed beads were boiled for 10 min in 4× NuPAGE loading buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1.4 m β-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Each co-immunoprecipitation was repeated in three independent experiments, and quantification was performed by estimating the ratio of immunoprecipitated binding partner to the amount of LRRK2 construct pulled down on the beads. Following treatment with sodium arsenite or vehicle control, LRRK2IN-1, or sodium arsenite plus LRRK2IN-1, HEK-293T cells were harvested in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science and Pierce) and lysed using five freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen. Lysates were centrifuged at 21,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatants were then passed through 0.45-μm filters (Nanosep MF, Pall Life Sciences) by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 3 min to remove any insoluble material. Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a BioAssist G4SWXL column (7.8 mm × 30.0 cm; Tosoh Bioscience) with PBS as the mobile phase as described before (16Rudenko I.N. Kaganovich A.

The collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis for GFP-LRRK2. The distribution of LRRK2 in each fraction was estimated by quantitation densitometry of the bands corrected to the total amount of immunoreactivity in all fractions. Standard Western blot protocols were used with the following antibodies: anti-phospho-Ser910 LRRK2 (UDD1 15(3)), anti-phospho-Ser935 LRRK2 (UDD2 10(12)), anti-phospho-Thr1410 LRRK2 (MJFR4-25-5), and anti-LRRK2 (C41-2) from Abcam; anti-phospho-Ser51 eIF2α from Epitomics; anti-eIF2α and anti-ubiquitin from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; and anti-β-actin from Sigma-Aldrich. The GTP binding properties of LRRK2 were assessed as described previously (28Greggio E. Lewis P.A. van der Brug M.P. Ahmad R. Kaganovich A. Ding J. Beilina A. Baker A.K. Cookson M.R.

Neurochem. 2007; 102: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-293T cells were treated with 0.5 mm sodium arsenite for 45 min and lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce), by 1 h of rotation at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at 21,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min, and supernatants were precleared with agarose beads for 1 h, rotating at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g, 4 °C for 5 min to separate the lysate from beads. Subsequently, equal amounts of protein were incubated with 30 μl of GTP-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich, G9768) with rotation for 2 h at 4 °C with some samples supplemented with 10 mm GTP as a competitive inhibitor of binding to the beads. GTP-agarose beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, eluted with 4× NuPAGE loading buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In a separate experiment, a titration of increasing concentrations of GTP was used to elute LRRK2 from GTP-agarose beads before analysis by Western blot. In vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (10Greggio E. Jain S. Kingsbury A. Bandopadhyay R. Lewis P. Kaganovich A. van der Brug M.P. Beilina A. Blackinton J. Thomas K.J. Ahmad R.

For the LRRKtide assay, FLAG-tagged LRRK2 was transiently expressed in HEK293 FT cells for 24 h, and proteins were purified in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce) with FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma). In vitro autophosphorylation kinase assays in the presence of different concentrations of sodium arsenite were performed with 10 nm recombinant GST-LRRK2(970–2527) (Life Technologies) or recombinant GST-CK1α (Signal Chem) in 1× kinase buffer (Cell Signaling), 6 μCi of [33P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 10 μm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding 4× NuPAGE loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, whereas incorporated 33P was detected by autoradiography. In the LRRKtide phosphorylation assay, incorporation of 33P was detected by liquid scintillation counting. HEK-293T cells were seeded at 7 × 104 cells/well on 12-mm coverslips precoated with laminin/poly-d-lysine (Millicell EZ slide, Millipore) and cultured as described before (14Nichols R.J. Dzamko N.

J. 2010; 430: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde/PBS, blocked in 5% (v/v) FBS in PBS, and stained in blocking solution for 2 h. Primary antibodies were anti-LRRK2 (Abcam), anti-γ-tubulin (Abcam), anti-α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich). After three washes in PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h with FITC- and TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies and TO-PRO-3 nuclear stain (Invitrogen). After additional washing steps, the cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 710). Experiments examining phosphorylation levels of LRRK2 under oxidative stress, LRRK2 self-association experiments, and centrosomal localization experiments were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test. A two-tailed Student's t test was used in the GTP binding experiments. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Mean values ± S.E. are indicated. To investigate how oxidative stress alters phosphorylation of endogenous LRRK2, we treated human lymphoblastoid cells with arsenite or H2O2. We observed a concentration-dependent reduction in Ser935 phosphorylation with arsenite (>100 μm), and with H2O2 (>200 μm) (Fig. 1A). Arsenite stress promotes translational arrest by mediating phosphorylation of the mammalian translation initiation factor eIF2α. Activation of this cellular stress response was therefore verified by monitoring the concentration-dependent increase in eIF2α phosphorylation under the same conditions (Fig. 1A). To examine whether these effects were also seen with mutant forms of LRRK2, we repeated these experiments in stably expressing LRRK2-inducible HEK-293T cell lines (10Greggio E. Jain S. Kingsbury A.

H2O2 (Fig. 1B) or arsenite (Fig. 1C) induced loss of Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation of WT as well as R1441C, D2017A, and G2019S mutants in a concentration-dependent manner. LRRK2 Y1699C displayed greatly reduced constitutive Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation, in agreement with previous studies (14Nichols R.J. Dzamko N. Morrice N.A. Campbell D.G. Deak M. Ordureau A.

To further evaluate the requirement of kinase activity, LRRK2-expressing cells were treated with arsenite in the presence or absence of the LRRK2 kinase inhibitor LRRK2IN-1. As with endogenous LRRK2, treatment with 0.5 mm arsenite caused a reduction in Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation for WT, R1441C, G2019S, and the kinase-dead D2017A. Treatment with LRRK2IN-1 induced a comparable loss of phosphorylation but, crucially, not in the kinase-dead D2017A mutant (Fig. 1, C and D). We also looked at Thr1410 autophosphorylation of immunoaffinity-purified GFP-LRRK2 (Fig. 1, C and E) (32Pungaliya P.P. Bai Y. Lipinski K. Anand V.S. Sen S. Brown E.L. Bates B. Reinhart P.H. West A.B.

Identification and characterization of a leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) consensus phosphorylation motif.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e13672Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We observed increased Thr(P)1410 signal in G2019S compared with WT, whereas arsenite treatment induced loss of Thr1410 phosphorylation in WT LRRK2 in a similar fashion to treatment with LRRK2IN-1 but had a lesser effect on G2019S Thr(P)1410 (Fig. 1E). Loss of Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation should decrease LRRK2 binding to 14-3-3 proteins. To test this, we immunoprecipitated LRRK2 from cells expressing WT LRRK2 or mutants after treatment with arsenite and/or LRRK2IN-1. In all cases, loss of Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation was accompanied by decreased co-immunoprecipitation of 14-3-3 (Fig. 1C). The differential effects of LRRK2IN-1 and arsenite stress on phosphorylation at Ser910/Ser935 of kinase-inactive D2017A suggest that the underlying mechanism does not rely on LRRK2 kinase activity. Because a recent study suggested that LRRK2 phosphorylation at Ser910/Ser935 is modulated by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (18Lobbestael E. Zhao J. Rudenko I.N. Beylina A. Gao F. Wetter J. Beullens M. Bollen M. Cookson M.R. Baekelandt V. Nichols R.J. Taymans J.-M. Identification of protein phosphatase 1 as a regulator of the LRRK2 phosphorylation cycle.Biochem. J. 2013; 456: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we tested whether arsenite-induced dephosphorylation was reversed by phosphatase inhibition. Calyculin A treatment of lymphoblastoid cells in the presence of arsenite, H2O2, or LRRK2IN-1 kinase inhibitor restored Ser935 phosphorylation of endogenous LRRK2 protein (Fig. 2, A and B). Arsenite promoted the association of LRRK2 with PP1α in a co-immunoprecipitation assay in cells transiently overexpressing FLAG LRRK2, whereas this effect was not observed for LRRK2IN-1 or H2O2 (Fig. 2, C and D). These results suggest that oxidative stress can modulate LRRK2 constitutive phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding through a pathway that is largely independent of the kinase activity of LRRK2 but depends on PP1/PP2A phosphatase activity and that arsenite can act to stabilize the interaction of LRRK2 with PP1α. Although LRRK2 is believed to be largely monomeric in cells, it can also form dimers that may have enhanced in vitro enzymatic activity (7Greggio E. Zambrano I. Kaganovich A. Beilina A. Taymans J.-M.

In this study we assessed whether fusion of the malarial antigen, ME-TRAP, to Ii could increase the vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell response. Following single or heterologous prime-boost vaccination of mice with a recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus vector, ChAd63, or recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), higher frequencies of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were observed, with the largest increases observed following a ChAd63-MVA heterologous prime-boost regimen. Studies in non-human primates confirmed the ability of Ii-fusion to augment the T cell response, where a 4-fold increase was maintained up to 11 weeks after the MVA boost. Of the numerous different approaches explored to increase vectored vaccine induced immunogenicity over the years, fusion to the invariant chain showed a consistent enhancement in CD8+ T cell responses across different animal species and may therefore find application in the development of vaccines against human malaria and other diseases where high levels of cell-mediated immunity are required."
https://openalex.org/W2122816722,"Antimicrobial peptides are important as the first line of innate defense, through their tendency to disrupt bacterial membranes or intracellular pathways and potentially as the next generation of antibiotics. How they protect wet epithelia is not entirely clear, with most individually inactive under physiological conditions and many preferentially targeting Gram-positive bacteria. Tears covering the surface of the eye are bactericidal for Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Here we narrow much of the bactericidal activity to a latent C-terminal fragment in the prosecretory mitogen lacritin and report that the mechanism combines membrane permeabilization with rapid metabolic changes, including reduced levels of dephosphocoenzyme A, spermidine, putrescine, and phosphatidylethanolamines and elevated alanine, leucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, proline, glycine, lysine, serine, glutamate, cadaverine, and pyrophosphate. Thus, death by metabolic stress parallels cellular attempts to survive. Cleavage-dependent appearance of the C-terminal cationic amphipathic α-helix is inducible within hours by Staphylococcus epidermidis and slowly by another mechanism, in a chymotrypsin- or leupeptin protease-inhibitable manner. Although bactericidal at low micromolar levels, within a biphasic 1-10 nM dose optimum, the same domain is mitogenic and cytoprotective for epithelia via a syndecan-1 targeting mechanism dependent on heparanase. Thus, the C terminus of lacritin is multifunctional by dose and proteolytic processing and appears to play a key role in the innate protection of the eye, with wider potential benefit elsewhere as lacritin flows from exocrine secretory cells."
https://openalex.org/W1996477014,"Background Primary human airway epithelial cells cultured in an air-liquid interface (ALI) develop a well-differentiated epithelium. However, neither characterization of mucociliar differentiation overtime nor the inflammatory function of reconstituted nasal polyp (NP) epithelia have been described. Objectives 1st) To develop and characterize the mucociliar differentiation overtime of human epithelial cells of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in ALI culture system; 2nd) To corroborate that 3D in vitro model of NP reconstituted epithelium maintains, compared to control nasal mucosa (NM), an inflammatory function. Methods Epithelial cells were obtained from 9 NP and 7 control NM, and differentiated in ALI culture for 28 days. Mucociliary differentiation was characterized at different times (0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days) using ultrastructure analysis by electron microscopy; ΔNp63 (basal stem/progenitor cell), β-tubulin IV (cilia), and MUC5AC (goblet cell) expression by immunocytochemistry; and mucous (MUC5AC, MUC5B) and serous (Lactoferrin) secretion by ELISA. Inflammatory function of ALI cultures (at days 0, 14, and 28) through cytokine (IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IL-12p70) and chemokine (RANTES, MIG, MCP-1, IP-10, eotaxin-1, and GM-CSF) production was analysed by CBA (Cytometric Bead Array). Results In both NP and control NM ALI cultures, pseudostratified epithelium with ciliated, mucus-secreting, and basal cells were observed by electron microscopy at days 14 and 28. Displaying epithelial cell re-differentation, β-tubulin IV and MUC5AC positive cells increased, while ΔNp63 positive cells decreased overtime. No significant differences were found overtime in MUC5AC, MUC5B, and lactoferrin secretions between both ALI cultures. IL-8 and GM-CSF were significantly increased in NP compared to control NM regenerated epithelia. Conclusion Reconstituted epithelia from human NP epithelial cells cultured in ALI system provides a 3D in vitro model that could be useful both for studying the role of epithelium in CRSwNP while developing new therapeutic strategies, including cell therapy, for CRSwNP."
https://openalex.org/W2042385880,"The impact of cell cycle on plant immunity was indicated by the enhancement of disease resistance with overexpressing OSD1 and UVI4 genes that are negative regulators of cell cycle controller APC (anaphase promoting complex). CPR5 is another gene that is implicated in cell cycle regulation and plant immunity, but its mode of action is not known. Here we report the analysis of genetic requirement for the function of UVI4 and OSD1 in cell cycle progression control and in particular the involvement of CPR5 in this regulation. We show that the APC activator CCS52A1 partially mediates the function of OSD1 and UVI4 in female gametophyte development. We found that the cpr5 mutation suppresses the endoreduplication defect in the uvi4 single mutant and partially rescued the gametophyte development defect in the osd1 uvi4 double mutant while the uvi4 mutation enhances the cpr5 defects in trichome branching and plant disease resistance. In addition, cyclin B1 genes CYCB1;1, CYCB1;2, and CYCB1;4 are upregulated in cpr5. Therefore, CPR5 has a large role in cell cycle regulation and this role has a complex interaction with that of UVI4 and OSD1. This study further indicates an intrinsic link between plant defense responses and cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2051672408,"γ-Tubulin is an important cell division regulator that arranges microtubule assembly and mitotic spindle formation. Cytosolic γ-tubulin nucleates α- and β-tubulin in a growing microtubule by forming the ring-shaped protein complex γTuRC. Nuclear γ-tubulin also regulates S-phase progression by moderating the activities of E2 promoter-binding factors. The mechanism that regulates localization of γ-tubulin is currently unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the human Ser/Thr kinase SadB short localizes to chromatin and centrosomes. We found that SadB-mediated phosphorylation of γ-tubulin on Ser(385) formed chromatin-associated γ-tubulin complexes that moderate gene expression. In this way, the C-terminal region of γ-tubulin regulates S-phase progression. In addition, chromatin levels of γ-tubulin were decreased by the reduction of SadB levels or expression of a non-phosphorylatable Ala(385)-γ-tubulin but were enhanced by expression of SadB, wild-type γ-tubulin, or a phosphomimetic Asp(385)-γ-tubulin mutant. Our results demonstrate that SadB kinases regulate the cellular localization of γ-tubulin and thereby control S-phase progression."
https://openalex.org/W2137946088,"In many regions, large proportions of the naturalized and invasive non-native floras were originally introduced deliberately by humans. Pest risk assessments are now used in many jurisdictions to regulate the importation of species and usually include an estimation of the potential distribution in the import area. Two species of Asian grass (Miscanthus sacchariflorus and M. sinensis) that were originally introduced to North America as ornamental plants have since escaped cultivation. These species and their hybrid offspring are now receiving attention for large-scale production as biofuel crops in North America and elsewhere. We evaluated their potential global climate suitability for cultivation and potential invasion using the niche model CLIMEX and evaluated the models’ sensitivity to the parameter values. We then compared the sensitivity of projections of future climatically suitable area under two climate models and two emissions scenarios. The models indicate that the species have been introduced to most of the potential global climatically suitable areas in the northern but not the southern hemisphere. The more narrowly distributed species (M. sacchariflorus) is more sensitive to changes in model parameters, which could have implications for modelling species of conservation concern. Climate projections indicate likely contractions in potential range in the south, but expansions in the north, particularly in introduced areas where biomass production trials are under way. Climate sensitivity analysis shows that projections differ more between the selected climate change models than between the selected emissions scenarios. Local-scale assessments are required to overlay suitable habitat with climate projections to estimate areas of cultivation potential and invasion risk."

https://openalex.org/W1977153765,"We present a simple bench-top method to fabricate enclosed circular channels for biological experiments. Fabricating the channels takes less than 2 hours by using glass capillaries of various diameters (from 100 µm up to 400 µm) as a mould in PDMS. The inner surface of microchannels prepared in this way was coated with a thin membrane of either Matrigel or a layer-by-layer polyelectrolyte to control cellular adhesion. The microchannels were then used as scaffolds for 3D-confined epithelial cell culture. To show that our device can be used with several epithelial cell types from exocrine glandular tissues, we performed our biological studies on adherent epithelial prostate cells (non-malignant RWPE-1 and invasive PC3) and also on breast (non-malignant MCF10A) cells We observed that in static conditions cells adhere and proliferate to form a confluent layer in channels of 150 µm in diameter and larger, whereas cellular viability decreases with decreasing diameter of the channel. Matrigel and PSS (poly (sodium 4-styrenesulphonate)) promote cell adhesion, whereas the cell proliferation rate was reduced on the PAH (poly (allylamine hydrochloride))-terminated surface. Moreover infusing channels with a continuous flow did not induce any cellular detachment. Our system is designed to simply grow cells in a microchannel structure and could be easily fabricated in any biological laboratory. It offers opportunities to grow epithelial cells that support the formation of a light. This system could be eventually used, for example, to collect cellular secretions, or study cell responses to graduated hypoxia conditions, to chemicals (drugs, siRNA, …) and/or physiological shear stress."
https://openalex.org/W1986578634,"The human hyaluronan (HA) receptor for endocytosis (HARE; the 190-kDa C terminus of Stab2) is a major clearance receptor for multiple circulating ligands including HA, heparin (Hep), acetylated LDL (AcLDL), dermatan sulfate (DS), apoptotic debris, and chondroitin sulfate types A, C, D, and E. We previously found that HARE contains an N-glycan in the HA binding Link domain (at Asn(2280)), and cells expressing membrane-bound HARE(N2280A) bind and endocytose HA normally (Harris, E. N., Parry, S., Sutton-Smith, M., Pandey, M. S., Panico, M., Morris, H. R., Haslam, S. M., Dell, A., and Weigel, P. H. (2010) Glycobiology 20, 991-1001). Also, NF-κB-mediated signaling is activated by HARE-mediated endocytosis of HA, Hep, AcLDL, or DS but not by chondroitin sulfates (Pandey, M. S., and Weigel, P. H. (2014) J. Biol. Chem. 289, 1756-1767). Here we investigated the role of Link N-glycans in ligand uptake and NF-κB and ERK1/2 signaling. HA·HARE-mediated ERK1/2 activation was HA size- dependent, as found for NF-κB activation. HARE(N2280A) cells internalized HA, Hep, AcLDL, and DS normally. No ERK1/2 activation occurred during HA endocytosis by HARE(N2280A) cells, but activation did occur with Hep. Dual-luciferase recorder assays showed that NF-κB-mediated gene expression occurred normally in HARE(N2280A) cells endocytosing Hep, AcLDL, or DS but did not occur with HA. Activation of NF-κB by endogenous degradation of IκB-α was observed for HARE(N2280A) cells endocytosing Hep, AcLDL, or DS but not HA. We conclude that a Link domain complex N-glycan is required specifically for HARE·HA-mediated activation of ERK1/2 and NF-κB-mediated gene expression and that this initial activation mechanism is different from and independent of the initial mechanisms for HARE-mediated signaling in response to Hep, AcLDL, or DS uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2045035521,"To guide achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, we used the Lives Saved Tool to provide a novel simulation of potential maternal, fetal, and newborn lives and costs saved by scaling up midwifery and obstetrics services, including family planning, in 58 low- and middle-income countries. Typical midwifery and obstetrics interventions were scaled to either 60% of the national population (modest coverage) or 99% (universal coverage).Under even a modest scale-up, midwifery services including family planning reduce maternal, fetal, and neonatal deaths by 34%. Increasing midwifery alone or integrated with obstetrics is more cost-effective than scaling up obstetrics alone; when family planning was included, the midwifery model was almost twice as cost-effective as the obstetrics model, at $2,200 versus $4,200 per death averted. The most effective strategy was the most comprehensive: increasing midwives, obstetricians, and family planning could prevent 69% of total deaths under universal scale-up, yielding a cost per death prevented of just $2,100. Within this analysis, the interventions which midwifery and obstetrics are poised to deliver most effectively are different, with midwifery benefits delivered across the continuum of pre-pregnancy, prenatal, labor and delivery, and postpartum-postnatal care, and obstetrics benefits focused mostly on delivery. Including family planning within each scope of practice reduced the number of likely births, and thus deaths, and increased the cost-effectiveness of the entire package (e.g., a 52% reduction in deaths with midwifery and obstetrics increased to 69% when family planning was added; cost decreased from $4,000 to $2,100 per death averted).This analysis suggests that scaling up midwifery and obstetrics could bring many countries closer to achieving mortality reductions. Midwives alone can achieve remarkable mortality reductions, particularly when they also perform family planning services--the greatest return on investment occurs with the scale-up of midwives and obstetricians together."
https://openalex.org/W2056187570,"Interleukin-7 (IL7) is a pleiotropic cytokine that is actively involved in the immune system. The Chinese tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) has been proposed as an alternative experimental animal to primates in biomedical research. However, there is a lack of biological knowledge about the immune system of the tree shrew. In this study, we cloned the IL7 gene (tIL7) in the Chinese tree shrew and quantified the expression of mRNA transcripts in eight tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, intestine, skeletal muscle and brain) from 20 individuals. Eleven tIL7 mRNA transcripts were identified in different tissues. The canonical form (tIL7c) had a length of 1817 bp and encoded a predicted gene product with 177 amino acids. Phylogenetic analyses based on the amino acid sequences revealed a considerably large genetic difference between tree shrew and human. Quantification of mRNA expression of transcripts tIL7c, tIL7-sv1, tIL7-sv2 and tIL7-sv3 showed that these transcripts were expressed in all tissues, albeit the expression levels varied in different tissues. Transcripts tIL7c, tIL7-sv1, and tIL7-sv2 had the lowest expression in brain, and tIL7-sv3 had a dramatically high mRNA expression in skeletal muscle and heart. The mRNA expression levels of tIL7c and tIL7-sv1 were significantly increased upon ploy(I:C) stimulation in tree shrew primary renal cells. As with human full-length IL7, tIL7c, tIL7-sv1, tIL7-sv2 and tIL7-sv3 showed similar a subcellular localization pattern. Our results identified diverse tIL7 transcripts in the Chinese tree shrew, which may play a potential role in modulating IL7-regulated biological effects."

The present study sought to identify which cells in tumors and remodeling tissues express Cthrc1 and investigate the range of circulating human Cthrc1 levels in health and disease.Highly specific monoclonal antibodies were generated to detect Cthrc1 by ELISA in plasma and in tissues by immunohistochemistry. In human colon, gastric, breast, endometrial, pancreatic, kidney, lung and skin cancer, Cthrc1 was expressed by activated stromal cells and not the cancer cells themselves. Similarly, conditions evoking tissue remodeling, such as wound repair or angiotensin II-mediated hypertension, induced Cthrc1 expression in interstitial and adventitial fibroblasts and perivascular stromal cells. Levels of Cthrc1 in plasma from healthy subjects were near the lower detection limit except for individuals with red hair, who had up to several hundred fold higher levels. Elevated Cthrc1 was also found in patients with diabetes, inflammatory conditions, and infections, but not solid tumors. Transgenic mouse studies suggested that Cthrc1 expression by stromal cells does not contribute to circulating levels. In human pituitaries, Cthrc1 was expressed in the anterior and intermediate lobes with unencapsulated Cthrc1 accumulations typically surrounded by chromophobe cells.We identify Cthrc1 as a marker for activated stromal cells. Cthrc1 is a pituitary hormone with significantly elevated levels in subjects carrying variant alleles of the melanocortin-1 receptor as wells as in patients with inflammatory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1991165630,"Rediscovered in the wild twenty years ago, the breeding biology of wild Blue-throated Macaws remains largely unexplored, yet is essential to its effective conservation and recovery. Here, we analyse reproductive parameters in an intensively managed wild population of Blue-throated Macaws, providing the first data on the breeding biology of this critically endangered species. During the six-year study period, 2007–2012, the number of active breeding pairs either remained constant or decreased, depending on the site, and no new breeding pairs were discovered despite extensive searching. We documented nesting attempts in natural cavities in dead palms or live hardwoods, and artificial nest boxes. Egg-laying was concentrated during the end of dry season and the beginning of the wet season, August through December. Hatching failure was the greatest cause of egg losses. Half of the breeding attempts of Blue-throated Macaws produced at least one fledging, on average two, after a 85 days nestling period. An average of 4.3 nestlings per year fledged from all known wild nests combined. Each pair lost roughly 65% of its initial reproductive investment at each nesting attempt. In most successful nesting attempts of individualized pairs, a new nesting attempt was not detected the following year. All monitored breeding pairs showed high nest site fidelity, reusing hardwood-tree cavities and nest boxes. Our findings will aid conservation efforts by refining current actions and prompting new approaches towards the conservation and recovery of the Blue-throated Macaw."

The present study is focused on the interaction of paraquat with the mouse erythroid system.

A marked surge in the blood reticulocyte count was observed in paraquat treated mice that also subsided by 28th day. Young erythrocytes in circulation were randomly eliminated from blood circulation in paraquat treated mice and a significant elevation in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also observed maximally the erythrocytes of this age group. Cells representing various stages of erythroid differentiation in bone marrow and spleen were identified and enumerated flow cytometrically based on their expression of Ter119 and transferrin (CD71) receptor. Proliferative activity of erythroid cells, their relative proportion as well as their absolute numbers fell significantly in bone marrow of paraquat treated mice but all these parameters were significantly elevated in spleens of paraquat treated mice. These changes were essentially restricted to the cells belonging to the two earliest stages of erythroid differentiation. Taken together our results indicate that paraquat treatment causes a transient anemia in mice resulting from random elimination of young circulating erythrocytes as well as depressed erythropoietic activity in bone marrow. Spleen erythropoietic activity however was elevated in paraquat treated mice."
https://openalex.org/W2140626606,"It is known that HIV-related stigma hinders prevention efforts. Previous studies have documented that HIV-related stigma may be associated with socioeconomic and socioecological factors. Mass media use may moderate this association, but there is limited research addressing that possibility. In this study, based on cross-sectional data pooled from the 2006–2011 Demographic and Health Surveys of 11 sub-Saharan African countries (N = 204,343), we investigated the moderating effects of exposure to mass media on HIV-related stigma. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that HIV-related stigma tends to be higher among rural residents and individuals with low levels of education and HIV knowledge, as well as those who do not know people living with HIV. Media use was generally associated with low levels of HIV-related stigma, and attenuated the gap between individuals with high and low educational levels. However, the effect of mass media was found to be stronger among urbanites rather than among rural residents, which could lead to a widening gap between the two groups in endorsement of HIV-related stigma. The implication of this study regarding the effect of media use on HIV-related stigma in sub-Saharan Africa is twofold: 1) mass media may have the potential to minimize the gap in HIV-related stigma between individuals with high and low educational levels, and hence future efforts of reducing HIV-related stigma in the region may benefit from utilizing media; 2) due perhaps to low media penetration to rural sub-Saharan Africa, mass media could have the unintended effect of widening the urban-rural gap further unless other more customized and rural-focused communication interventions are put in place."

This resistance to parasite infection is a dominant characteristic during crossbreeding with susceptible B. tenagophila strains. These experiments also identified a 350 bp molecular marker that is exclusive to the Taim strain and does not occur in other geographic strains of this snail species. The Taim strain (Taim/RS) of Biomphalaria tenagophila was bred on a large scale, physically marked and introduced into a stream in which previous malacological analyses had revealed the presence of only parasite-susceptible B. tenagophila. Samples of offspring captured 4, 11 and 14 months after the introduction of the Taim strain were examined, and the susceptibility of the snails to S. mansoni infection dropped from 38.6–26.5% to 2.1% during the 14 months after the introduction of the Taim snail strain. A significant correlation was also observed between the absence of infection and the identification of the Taim molecular marker. These results demonstrate that the genetic marker from the Taim strain was successfully introduced into the wild snail population. In addition, a significant relationship exists between the marker and resistance to infection."
https://openalex.org/W2028879735,"Thyroid cancer-1 (TC-1), a natively disordered protein, is widely expressed in vertebrates and overexpressed in many kinds of tumors. However, its exact role and regulation mechanism in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are still unclear. In the present study, we found that TC-1 is highly expressed in NSCLC and that its aberrant expression is strongly associated with NSCLC cell proliferation. Exogenous TC-1 overexpression promotes cell proliferation, accelerates the cell G1-to-S-phase transition, and reduces apoptosis in NSCLC. The knockdown of TC-1, however, inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation, cycle transition, and apoptosis resistance. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that PD173074, which functions as an inhibitor of the TC-1 in NSCLC, decreases the expression of TC-1 and inhibits TC-1 overexpression mediated cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Nevertheless, the inhibition function of PD173074 on NSCLC cell proliferation was eliminated in cells with TC-1 knockdown. These results suggest that PD173074 plays a significant role in TC-1 overexpression mediated NSCLC cell proliferation and may be a potential intervention target for the prevention of cell proliferation in NSCLC."

Although functional characterization of the Wolbachia peptidoglycan assembly has not been fully explored, the Wolbachia genome provides evidence for coding all of the genes involved in lipid II biosynthesis, a part of peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway. UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA) is one of the lipid II biosynthesis pathway enzymes and it has inevitably been recognized as an antibiotic target. In view of the vital role of MurA in bacterial viability and survival, MurA ortholog from Wolbachia endosymbiont of Brugia malayi (wBm-MurA) was cloned, expressed and purified for further molecular characterization. The enzyme kinetics and inhibition studies were undertaken using fosfomycin. wBm-MurA was found to be expressed in all the major life stages of B. malayi and was immunolocalized in Wolbachia within the microfilariae and female adults by the confocal microscopy. Sequence analysis suggests that the amino acids crucial for enzymatic activity are conserved. The purified wBm-MurA was shown to possess the EPSP synthase (3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase) like activity at a broad pH range with optimal activity at pH 7.5 and 37°C temperature. The apparent affinity constant (Km) for the substrate UDP-N-acetylglucosamine was found to be 0.03149 mM and for phosphoenolpyruvate 0.009198 mM. The relative enzymatic activity was inhibited ∼2 fold in presence of fosfomycin. Superimposition of the wBm-MurA homology model with the structural model of Haemophilus influenzae (Hi-MurA) suggests binding of fosfomycin at the same active site.

We treated newborn male rats with monosodium glutamate (MSG), a total growth hormone (GH) blocker, and, using cultured hepatocytes, examined expression of adult CYP2C11, the predominant cytochrome-P450 expressed only in males, as well as the signal transduction pathway by which episodic GH solely regulates the isoform's expression. In addition, adolescent hypophysectomized (hypox) male rats served as controls in which GH was eliminated after the critical imprinting period. Whereas renaturalization of the masculine episodic GH profile restored normal male-like levels of CYP2C11, as well as CYP2C12, in hepatocytes from hypox rats, the cells derived from the MSG-treated rats were completely unresponsive. Moreover, GH exposure of hepatocytes from hypox rats resulted in normal induction, activation, nuclear translocation, and binding to the CYP2C11 promoter of the signal transducers mediating GH regulation of CYP2C11 expression, which dramatically contrasted with the complete unresponsiveness of the MSG-derived hepatocytes, also associated with hypermethylation of GH-response elements in the CYP2C11 promoter. Lastly, neonatal MSG treatment had no adverse effect on postnatal and adult testosterone levels. The results demonstrate that the sexually dimorphic expression of CYP2C11 is irreversibly imprinted shortly after birth by a hormone other than the customary testosterone, but likely by GH.—Das, R.

https://openalex.org/W2077392306,"Assessing allele-specific gene expression (ASE) on a large scale continues to be a technically challenging problem. Certain biological phenomena, such as X chromosome inactivation and parental imprinting, affect ASE most drastically by completely shutting down the expression of a whole set of alleles. Other more subtle effects on ASE are likely to be much more complex and dependent on the genetic environment and are perhaps more important to understand since they may be responsible for a significant amount of biological diversity. Tools to assess ASE in a diploid biological system are becoming more reliable. Non-diploid systems are, however, not uncommon. In humans full or partial polyploid states are regularly found in both healthy (meiotic cells, polynucleated cell types) and diseased tissues (trisomies, non-disjunction events, cancerous tissues). In this work we have studied ASE in the medaka fish model system. We have developed a method for determining ASE in polyploid organisms from RNAseq data and we have implemented this method in a software tool set. As a biological model system we have used nuclear transplantation to experimentally produce artificial triploid medaka composed of three different haplomes. We measured ASE in RNA isolated from the livers of two adult, triploid medaka fish that showed a high degree of similarity. The majority of genes examined (82%) shared expression more or less evenly among the three alleles in both triploids. The rest of the genes (18%) displayed a wide range of ASE levels. Interestingly the majority of genes (78%) displayed generally consistent ASE levels in both triploid individuals. A large contingent of these genes had the same allele entirely suppressed in both triploids. When viewed in a chromosomal context, it is revealed that these genes are from large sections of 4 chromosomes and may be indicative of some broad scale suppression of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2071323909,"Acutobin isolated from Deinagkistrodon acutus venom has been used to prevent or treat stroke in patients. This defibrinogenating serine protease is a 39 kDa glycoprotein containing terminal disialyl-capped N-glycans. After sialidase treatment, the enzyme showed similar catalytic activities toward chromogenic substrate, and cleaved the Aα chain of fibrinogen as efficiently as the native acutobin did. However, the level of fibrinogen degradation products in mice after i.p.-injection of desialylated-acutobin was significantly lower than the level after acutobin injection, suggesting that the disialyl moieties may improve or prolong the half-life of acutobin. Two recombinant enzymes with identical protein structures and similar amidolytic activities to those of native acutobin were expressed from HEK293T and SW1353 cells and designated as HKATB and SWATB, respectively. Mass spectrometric profiling showed that their glycans differed from those of acutobin. In contrast to acutobin, HKATB cleaved not only the Aα chain but also the Bβ and γ chains of human fibrinogens, while SWATB showed a reduced α-fibrinogenase activity. Non-denaturing deglycosylation of these proteases by peptide N-glycosidase F significantly reduced their fibrinogenolytic activities and thermal stabilities. The in vivo defibrinogenating effect of HKATB was inferior to that of acutobin in mice. Taken together, our results suggest that the conjugated glycans of acutobin are involved in its interaction with fibrinogen, and that the selection of cells optimally expressing efficient glycoforms and further glycosylation engineering are desirable before a recombinant product can replace the native enzyme for clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2026204003,"[NiFe] hydrogenases are key enzymes for the energy and redox metabolisms of different microorganisms. Synthesis of these metalloenzymes involves a complex series of biochemical reactions catalyzed by a plethora of accessory proteins, many of them required to synthesize and insert the unique NiFe(CN)2CO cofactor. HypC is an accessory protein conserved in all [NiFe] hydrogenase systems and involved in the synthesis and transfer of the Fe(CN)2CO cofactor precursor. Hydrogenase accessory proteins from bacteria-synthesizing hydrogenase in the presence of oxygen include HupK, a scaffolding protein with a moderate sequence similarity to the hydrogenase large subunit and proposed to participate as an intermediate chaperone in the synthesis of the NiFe cofactor. The endosymbiotic bacterium Rhizobium leguminosarum contains a single hydrogenase system that can be expressed under two different physiological conditions: free-living microaerobic cells (∼12 μm O2) and bacteroids from legume nodules (∼10–100 nm O2). We have used bioinformatic tools to model HupK structure and interaction of this protein with HypC. Site-directed mutagenesis at positions predicted as critical by the structural analysis have allowed the identification of HupK and HypC residues relevant for the maturation of hydrogenase. Mutant proteins altered in some of these residues show a different phenotype depending on the physiological condition tested. Modeling of HypC also predicts the existence of a stable HypC dimer whose presence was also demonstrated by immunoblot analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2078552723,"Life history of organisms is exposed to uncertainty generated by internal and external stochasticities. Internal stochasticity is generated by the randomness in each individual life history, such as randomness in food intake, genetic character and size growth rate, whereas external stochasticity is due to the environment. For instance, it is known that the external stochasticity tends to affect population growth rate negatively. It has been shown in a recent theoretical study using path-integral formulation in structured linear demographic models that internal stochasticity can affect population growth rate positively or negatively. However, internal stochasticity has not been the main subject of researches. Taking account of effect of internal stochasticity on the population growth rate, the fittest organism has the optimal control of life history affected by the stochasticity in the habitat. The study of this control is known as the optimal life schedule problems. In order to analyze the optimal control under internal stochasticity, we need to make use of ""Stochastic Control Theory"" in the optimal life schedule problem. There is, however, no such kind of theory unifying optimal life history and internal stochasticity. This study focuses on an extension of optimal life schedule problems to unify control theory of internal stochasticity into linear demographic models. First, we show the relationship between the general age-states linear demographic models and the stochastic control theory via several mathematical formulations, such as path-integral, integral equation, and transition matrix. Secondly, we apply our theory to a two-resource utilization model for two different breeding systems: semelparity and iteroparity. Finally, we show that the diversity of resources is important for species in a case. Our study shows that this unification theory can address risk hedges of life history in general age-states linear demographic models."

https://openalex.org/W2333558537,"Objectives Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection has been detected in all provinces of China. Although epidemiological and phylogenetic studies have been conducted in many regions, such analyses are lacking from Jilin province in northeastern China. Method Epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses, as well as detection of drug-resistant mutations, were conducted on 57 HIV-1 infected patients from Changchun city identified and confirmed through annual surveillance by local Centers for Disease Control in Jilin province of northeastern China in 2012. Results Sexual contact was determined to be the major pathway for HIV-1 transmission in Jilin, where hetero- and homosexual activities contributed almost equally. Phylogenetic analyses detected multiple subtypes of HIV-1 including subtype G circulating in Jilin, with multiple origins for each of them. Both subtype B and CRF01_AE were dominant, and evidence of subtype B transmitting between different high-risk groups was observed. Mutations in the viral protease at position 71 indicated the presence of a selective pressure. Several drug-resistant mutations were detected, although they were predicted with low-level resistance to antiviral treatments. Conclusions Information from this study fills the gap in knowledge of HIV-1 transmission in Changchun city, Jilin province, China. By revealing the origin and evolutionary status of local HIV-1 strains, this work contributes to ongoing efforts in the control and prevention of AIDS."
