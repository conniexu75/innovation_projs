https://openalex.org/W2087657646,"Differential access to cocaine self-administration produced two patterns of drug intake in rats. With 1 hour of access per session, drug intake remained low and stable. In contrast, with 6 hours of access, drug intake gradually escalated over days. After escalation, drug consumption was characterized by an increased early drug loading and an upward shift in the cocaine dose-response function, suggesting an increase in hedonic set point. After 1 month of abstinence, escalation of cocaine intake was reinstated to a higher level than before. These findings may provide an animal model for studying the development of excessive drug intake and the basis of addiction."

The result is a 50,000-year-long temperature history at GRIP and a 7000-year history at Dye 3. The Last Glacial Maximum, the Climatic Optimum, the Medieval Warmth, the Little Ice Age, and a warm period at 1930 A.D. are resolved from the GRIP reconstruction with the amplitudes –23 kelvin, +2.5 kelvin, +1 kelvin, –1 kelvin, and +0.5 kelvin, respectively. The Dye 3 temperature is similar to the GRIP history but has an amplitude 1.5 times larger, indicating higher climatic variability there. The calculated terrestrial heat flow density from the GRIP inversion is 51.3 milliwatts per square meter."
https://openalex.org/W2168084973,"p53 acts as a tumor suppressor by inducing both growth arrest and apoptosis. p53-induced apoptosis can occur without new RNA synthesis through an unknown mechanism. In human vascular smooth muscle cells, p53 activation transiently increased surface Fas (CD95) expression by transport from the Golgi complex. Golgi disruption blocked both p53-induced surface Fas expression and apoptosis. p53 also induced Fas-FADD binding and transiently sensitized cells to Fas-induced apoptosis. In contrast, lpr and gld fibroblasts were resistant to p53-induced apoptosis. Thus, p53 can mediate apoptosis through Fas transport from cytoplasmic stores."
https://openalex.org/W1965079106,The routing and interconnection of optical signals through narrow channels and around sharp corners are important for large-scale all-optical circuit applications. A recent computational result suggests that photonic crystals may offer a novel way of achieving this goal by providing a mechanism for guiding light that is fundamentally different from traditional index guiding. Waveguiding in a photonic crystal and near 100 percent transmission of electromagnetic waves around sharp 90 degree corners were observed experimentally. Bending radii were made smaller than one wavelength.

The behavior of adsorbed water is particularly important and poorly understood. Simulations of hydrated α-alumina (0001) surfaces with ab initio molecular dynamics elucidate many aspects of this problem, especially the complex dynamics of water dissociation and related surface reactions. At low water coverage, free energy profiles established that molecularly adsorbed water is metastable and dissociates readily, even in the absence of defects, by a kinetically preferred pathway. Observations at higher water coverage revealed rapid dissociation and unanticipated collective effects, including water-catalyzed dissociation and proton transfer reactions between adsorbed water and hydroxide. The results provide a consistent interpretation of the measured coverage dependence of water heats of adsorption, hydroxyl vibrational spectra, and other experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1723227640,"For patients with extensive burns, wound coverage with an autologous in vitro reconstructed skin made of both dermis and epidermis should be the best alternative to split-thickness graft. Unfortunately, various obstacles have delayed the widespread use of composite skin substitutes. Insufficient vascularization has been proposed as the most likely reason for their unreliable survival. Our purpose was to develop a vascular-like network inside tissue-engineered skin in order to improve graft vascularization. To reach this aim, we fabricated a collagen biopolymer in which three human cell types keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and umbilical vein endothelial cells were cocultured. We demonstrated that the endothelialized skin equivalent (ESE) promoted spontaneous formation of capillary-like structures in a highly differentiated extracellular matrix. Immunohistochemical analysis and transmission electron microscopy of the ESE showed characteristics associated with the microvasculature in vivo (von Willebrand factor, Weibel-Palade bodies, basement membrane material, and intercellular junctions). We have developed the first endothelialized human tissue-engineered skin in which a network of capillary-like tubes is formed. The transplantation of this ESE on human should accelerate graft revascularization by inosculation of its preexisting capillary-like network with the patient's own blood vessels, as it is observed with autografts. In addition, the ESE turns out to be a promising in vitro angiogenesis model."

Here it is shown that small molecule aptamers also bound their ligand in vivo, enabling development of a method for controlling gene expression in living cells. Insertion of a small molecule aptamer into the 5' untranslated region of a messenger RNA allowed its translation to be repressible by ligand addition in vitro as well as in mammalian cells. The ability of small molecules to control expression of specific genes could facilitate studies in many areas of biology and medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2064899851,"Desiccation of plants during drought can be detrimental to agricultural production. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) reduces water loss by triggering stomatal pore closure in leaves, a process requiring ion-channel modulation by cytoplasmic proteins. Deletion of the Arabidopsis farnesyltransferase gene ERA1 or application of farnesyltransferase inhibitors resulted in ABA hypersensitivity of guard cell anion-channel activation and of stomatal closing. ERA1 was expressed in guard cells. Double-mutant analyses of era1 with the ABA-insensitive mutants abi1 and abi2 showed that era1 suppresses the ABA-insensitive phenotypes. Moreover, era1 plants exhibited a reduction in transpirational water loss during drought treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2021029116,"The PPP2R1B gene, which encodes the β isoform of the A subunit of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), was identified as a putative human tumor suppressor gene. Sequencing of the PPP2R1B gene, located on human chromosome 11q22-24, revealed somatic alterations in 15% (5 out of 33) of primary lung tumors, 6% (4 out of 70) of lung tumor–derived cell lines, and 15% (2 out of 13) of primary colon tumors. One deletion mutation generated a truncated PP2A-Aβ protein that was unable to bind to the catalytic subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme. The PP2R1B gene product may suppress tumor development through its role in cell cycle regulation and cellular growth control."

https://openalex.org/W2060184827,"The anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2 is located in the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum membranes as well as the nuclear envelope. Although its location has not been as rigorously defined, the pro-apoptotic molecule Bax appears to be mainly a cytosolic protein which translocates to the mitochondria upon induction of apoptosis. Here we identify a protease activity in mitochondria-enriched membrane fractions from HL-60 cells capable of cleaving Bax which is absent from the cytosolic fraction. Bax protease activity is blocked in vitro by cysteine protease inhibitors including E-64 which distinguishes it from all known caspases and granzyme B, both of which are involved in apoptosis. Protease activity is also blocked by inhibitors against the calcium-activated neutral cysteine endopeptidase calpain. Partial purification of the Bax protease activity from HL-60 cell membrane fractions by column chromatography revealed that a calpain-like activity was the protease responsible for Bax cleavage. In addition, purified calpain enzymes cleaved Bax in a calcium-dependent manner. Pretreatment of HL-60 cells with the specific calpain inhibitor calpeptin effectively blocked both drug-induced Bax cleavage and calpain activation, but not PARP cleavage or cell death. These results suggest that calpains and caspases are activated during drug-induced apoptosis and that calpains, along with caspases, may be involved in modulating cell death by acting selectively on cellular substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2004123711,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) activate protein kinase PKB (also termed Akt), and PI3Kγ activated by heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate–binding protein can stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Exchange of a putative lipid substrate-binding site generated PI3Kγ proteins with altered or aborted lipid but retained protein kinase activity. Transiently expressed, PI3Kγ hybrids exhibited wortmannin-sensitive activation of MAPK, whereas a catalytically inactive PI3Kγ did not. Membrane-targeted PI3Kγ constitutively produced phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and activated PKB but not MAPK. Moreover, stimulation of MAPK in response to lysophosphatidic acid was blocked by catalytically inactive PI3Kγ but not by hybrid PI3Kγs. Thus, two major signals emerge from PI3Kγ: phosphoinositides that target PKB and protein phosphorylation that activates MAPK."

https://openalex.org/W2099270219,"Differences between the carbon isotopic values of carbonates secreted by planktic and benthic organisms did not recover to stable preextinction levels for more than 3 million years after the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction. These decreased differences may have resulted from a smaller proportion of marine biological production sinking to deep water in the postextinction ocean. Under this hypothesis, marine production may have recovered shortly after the mass extinction, but the structure of the open-ocean ecosystem did not fully recover for more than 3 million years."
https://openalex.org/W1993170631,"All nucleated mammalian cells synthesize phosphatidylcholine from choline via the CDP-choline pathway. Hepatocytes have a second pathway for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, a stepwise methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine, catalyzed by phosphatidylethanolamineN-methyltransferase and encoded by the Pemptgene. We report that when Pempt-deficient mice were fed a choline-deficient diet for 3 days, severe liver pathology occurred apparently due to a lack of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. The hepatic concentration of phosphatidylcholine decreased by 50% compared with wild type mice on the diet. The levels of plasma triacylglycerols and cholesterol were decreased by greater than 90% in thePempt-deficient mice. We suggest that the Pemptgene has been maintained during evolution to provide phosphatidylcholine when dietary choline is insufficient, as might occur during starvation or pregnancy.

Hepatocytes in liver have abundant activity for the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT)1 pathway, whereas other cells and tissues express minimal activities for this enzyme (1Bremer J. Greenberg D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 37: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2Bremer J. Figard P.H. Greenberg D.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Since the liver possesses the CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis (5Kennedy E.P. Vance D.E. Phosphatidylcholine Metabolism. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 1-8Google Scholar), why PEMT has been retained during evolution is not obvious. One clue to the importance of PEMT function arises from studies on choline deficiency. When fed a choline-deficient (CD) diet, rats survive with minimal adverse effects, but develop fatty livers (6Zeisel S.H. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1990; 1: 332-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, PEMT might function to maintain PC synthesis and generate choline when dietary supply is insufficient. However, the quantitative significance of the PEMT pathway for production of choline as a catabolic product of PC is unclear, and an alternative pathway for synthesis of choline in mammals has been described in which phosphoethanolamine is methylated to yield phosphocholine (7Andriamampandry C. Freysz L. Kanfer J.N. Dreyfus H. Massarelli R. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Andriamampandry C. Freysz L. Kanfer J.N. Dreyfus H. Massarelli R. J.

To gain insight into the physiological significance of PE methylation, we created mice that completely lacked PEMT activity by targeted disruption of the Pempt gene (10Walkey C.J. Donohue L.R. Bronson R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12880-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that both hepatic isoforms of PEMT, PEMT1 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and PEMT2 recovered on the mitochondria associated membrane, were encoded by the same gene and absent fromPempt −/− mice. Under standard laboratory conditions, PEMT-deficient mice are indistinguishable from their normal and heterozygous littermates with respect to development, behavior, and fecundity. Microscopic examination of liver slices from 8-week-old mice revealed no obvious histological abnormalities. No significant differences in the composition of plasma lipoproteins or bile, both of which contain large amounts of PC, were observed. Hepatic phospholipid composition, including the level of PC, was minimally affected by the absence of PEMT. Thus, apparently, the PC generated via the CDP-choline pathway can replace PEMT-derived PC, revealing no obvious physiological role for PE methylation under normal conditions. An important test of the function of the PEMT pathway would be to restrict dietary choline and thereby decrease PC production via the CDP-choline pathway. Would the other pathways that have been reported to make phosphocholine (7Andriamampandry C. Freysz L. Kanfer J.N. Dreyfus H. Massarelli R. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Andriamampandry C. Freysz L. Kanfer J.N. Dreyfus H. Massarelli R. J.

We now report that severe liver pathology rapidly occurs in PEMT-deficient mice after withdrawal of dietary choline for only 3 days. The genotypes of the mice were determined by DNA blotting as described (10Walkey C.J. Donohue L.R. Bronson R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12880-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Mice of all three genotypes (Pempt +/+,Pempt +/−, and Pempt −/−) had a mixed 129/J and C57Bl/6 genetic background. The colony was maintained on a reversed 12-h light/dark cycle. At 8 weeks of age, mice of both sexes were switched to either a CD semisynthetic diet (ICN, catalog number 901387) or a choline-supplemented (CS) diet (CD diet + 0.4% choline chloride) and fed ad libitum for 60 h, then fasted for 12 h before sacrifice. Liver pieces were fixed in 10% formalin, and sections were stained with hemotoxylin and eosin according to standard methods. Alternatively, liver pieces were fixed by flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections were stained with Oil Red O. Blood was extracted from the mice by cardiac puncture and plasma separated by centrifugation. All instruments were pretreated with EDTA to prevent coagulation. Plasma from mice fed either diet was pooled according to genotype and assayed for aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase activities, using the GP and GO transaminase kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Bile acids in individual plasma samples were assayed using diagnostic kit 450-A (Sigma-Aldrich) adapted for microtiter plate analysis. Livers were homogenized with a motorized glass-Teflon homogenizer in 5 volumes of homogenizing buffer (11Houweling M. Cui Z. Tessitore L. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Protein was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Lipids were extracted from the homogenates in chloroform-methanol (12Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43088) Google Scholar) and separated by thin-layer chromatography. The bands corresponding to PC and triacylglycerol were scraped and assayed (13Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Snyder F. Stephens N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 244-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), using inorganic phosphate and triolein as standards. The concentration of triacylglycerol in plasma was measured using a diagnostic kit (Sigma-Aldrich) adapted for microtiter analysis. Plasma samples from mice were pooled according to genotype and lipoproteins were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superose 6 column attached to a Beckman System Gold apparatus as described (15Kieft K.A. Bocan T.M.A. Krause B.R. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 859-866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative amounts of total glycerol (primarily derived from triacylglycerol) and total cholesterol were determined with an in-line enzymatic assay by mixing column effluent with assay reagents (Sigma-Aldrich diagnostic reagent 337-B for glycerol or reagent 352 for cholesterol) and incubation in a postcolumn reactor. Peaks were identified by comparison with lipoprotein standards. To examine the importance of PE methylation for production of PC and choline (as a catabolic product of PC) in the absence of dietary choline, we fed mice of all three genotypes (Pempt +/+, Pempt +/−, and Pempt −/−) a CD or a CS diet. InPempt −/− mice fed the CD diet, the net biosynthesis of PC could occur only from residual dietary choline already present in the animal or from endogenously synthesized choline (7Andriamampandry C. Freysz L. Kanfer J.N. Dreyfus H. Massarelli R. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Andriamampandry C. Freysz L. Kanfer J.N. Dreyfus H. Massarelli R. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1845-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 9Andriamampandry C. Massarelli R. Kanfer J.N. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After 3 days, 8-week-old mice of all three genotypes fed the CS diet, and mice fed a CD diet and expressing PEMT activity (Pempt +/+ and Pempt +/−), exhibited a 5–10% weight gain. In contrast,Pempt −/− mice fed a CD diet lost between 5 and 10% of their total body weight and appeared indolent and uncoordinated. At necropsy the livers from thePempt −/− mice were grossly enlarged (∼50% by weight), with a distinct pale color. The gall bladders were also engorged (Fig. 1 A). Other tissues were not visibly altered. The rapid development of the CD-mediated pathology in the Pempt −/− mice was such that the experiments had to be terminated after 3 days to avoid pain or death. Pempt +/+ and Pempt +/− mice fed a CD diet displayed slight peripheral discoloration of the liver (Fig. 1 A), whereas none of the murine genotypes fed a CS diet displayed any abnormal hepatic morphology. Liver sections from mice with and without PEMT, fed CS and CD diets, were examined histopathologically. Livers from thePempt −/− mice fed a CD diet displayed severe vacuolization (Fig. 1 D). Much less vacuolization was observed in Pempt +/+ and Pempt +/− animals fed the CD diet (Fig. 1,B and C). No vacuolization was observed in the livers of any mice fed a CS diet including thePempt −/− mice (Fig. 1 E). Staining of frozen liver sections with lipophilic Oil Red O confirmed the presence of lipids in vacuoles of hepatocytes in all mice fed a CD diet (data not shown). Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase normally reside in hepatocytes but leak into the bloodstream upon liver injury. Therefore, the activities of these enzymes in the plasma is a useful indicator of hepatic damage (16Marshall W.J. Clinical Chemistry. Mosby, London1995: 231Google Scholar). The level of alanine aminotransferase activity in pooled plasma was increased 12.5-fold in Pempt −/− mice on a CD diet compared with normal mice on the same diet (Table I).Pempt −/− mice fed a CS diet had an undetectable plasma alanine aminotransferase activity. A similar pattern was observed for aspartate aminotransferase (Table I). The level of bile acids in the plasma, another indicator of liver damage, was elevated 5.6-fold in Pempt −/− mice fed the CD diet compared with Pempt +/+ mice fed a CD diet (Table I). Moreover, the plasma of Pempt −/− mice fed the CD diet was bright yellow, indicating jaundice. The challenge of PEMT-deficient mice with the CD diet resulted in severe liver damage and clearly demonstrated the importance of PC biosynthesis for proper maintenance of liver function. The presence of low levels of aminotransferases and bile acids in plasma from Pempt +/+ and Pempt +/− mice on the CD diet is consistent with the observed death of cells in livers from rats fed a CD diet (17Shin O.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 196-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Albright C.D. Liu R. Bethea T.C. Da Costa K.-A. Salganik R.I. Zeisel S.H.

Plasma bile acids were also measured. ND = not detectable. Analysis of the hepatic lipids by thin-layer chromatography revealed that the only lipid accumulating in livers of Pempt −/− mice was triacylglycerol. The level of triacylglycerol in the livers from Pempt −/−mice fed a CD diet was increased 3.9-fold (p < 0.05) compared with Pempt −/− mice fed a CS diet (Fig. 2 A). Significant amounts of triacylglycerol did not accumulate in the livers of Pempt +/+ mice fed a CD diet compared with a CS diet even though the gross liver morphology and histology indicated what appeared to be fat deposits (Fig. 1, A and B). This result contrasted with previous studies in which hepatic triacylglycerol accumulated by 6.5-fold in rats fed the CD diet compared with the CS diet (19Yao Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 2C. J. Walkey, L. Yu, L. B. Agellon, and D. E. Vance, unpublished results. The rise in bile acid concentration in the plasma of Pempt −/− mice fed the CD diet suggests an increase in hepatic bile acid levels. Previously, the formation of large vacuoles devoid of lipids in response to elevation of intracellular bile acid levels was documented in hepatoma cells (20Torchia E.C. Agellon L.B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 190-196PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the unusual liver morphology of thePempt −/− mice fed a CD diet is not solely a consequence of fat accumulation. Moreover, the gross liver morphology of the Pempt −/− mice is distinct from that observed for livers from mice that overexpress a truncated sterol response element binding protein-1a, which was attributed to massive accumulation of lipid (21Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). The livers of these latter animals also did not exhibit signs of cell death, which occurred in the livers fromPempt −/− mice on the CD diet. The consequences of impaired PC biosynthesis, through the simultaneous elimination of both dietary choline and PE methylation, on the amounts of hepatic phospholipids were determined. After 3 days, total hepatic phospholipids decreased by 41.6% (p < 0.05) from 125.4 to 73.2 nmol/mg of protein for Pempt −/−mice fed the CS compared with the CD diet. The amount of hepatic PC was even more dramatically decreased (56.4%) in Pempt −/− mice (from 63.3 on the CS diet to 27.6 nmol/mg of protein on the CD diet) (Fig. 2 B). PC is an important component of lipoproteins, forming a monolayer around the neutral lipid core of the particles, enhancing their solubility in plasma. The fatty liver observed in rats fed a CD diet could be, at least partially, ascribed to a defect in secretion of triacylglycerol-rich very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) from the liver, resulting in hepatic triacylglycerol accumulation (22Haines D.S.M. Can. J. Biochem. 1966; 44: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Yao Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma VLDL from Pempt +/− mice contained less triacylglycerol than did VLDL from wild type mice (Fig. 3 A), a result that matches the total plasma triacylglycerol values. The amount of plasma triacylglycerol in Pempt −/− mice on the CS diet was 43.6 ± 12.3 mg/dl, and the values forPempt +/+ and Pempt +/−mice on a CS diet, and of Pempt +/+ mice on a CD diet, were similar. The values for plasma triacylglcyerol forPempt +/− mice (30.2 ± 8.0 mg/dl) and Pempt −/− mice (28.6 ± 7.3 mg/dl) on the CD diet were significantly different (p < 0.05) from the Pempt +/+ mice on a CD diet.Pempt −/− mice contained very little triacylglycerol in the VLDL fraction. Instead, triacylglycerol was detected in a more dense fraction of lipoproteins having the same density as low density lipoproteins. Whether or not the reduction in circulating triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins is due to decreased VLDL secretion from the liver or increased clearance of lipoproteins is not known. As in Pempt +/+ mice, the majority of plasma cholesterol in Pempt +/− mice fed the CD diet is found in high density lipoprotein (HDL) (Fig. 3 B).Pempt −/− mice had greatly reduced levels of HDL cholesterol, which might be due to defective formation of nascent HDL as a result of decreased availability and/or efflux of PC from tissues. In addition, formation of HDL in the plasma might be impaired as a result of decreased levels of VLDL and chylomicrons, which act as lipid donors for HDL (24Glickman R.M. Sabesin S.M. Arias I.M. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 391-414Google Scholar). The rapid onset of damage to the liver, but not to other tissues, can be ascribed to the high demand for choline and PC for normal hepatic function. Hepatic choline can be phosphorylated and enter the CDP-choline biosynthetic pathway or, in liver, can be oxidized to betaine, which is an important source of methyl groups for other metabolic pathways (25Zeisel S.H. Blusztajn J.K. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 269-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The liver also secretes lipoproteins and bile, which require large amounts of PC as the major phospholipid. For example, the amount of biliary PC that is secreted from the liver is ∼23 mg/day for a 20 g mouse (26Kuipers F. Elferink R.P.J.O. Verkade H.J. Groen A.K. Bitman R. Subcellular Biochemistry. 28. Plenum Press, New York1997: 295-318Google Scholar). The weight of liver in a 20-g mouse is ∼2 g, and the total amount of PC in this liver would be ∼20 mg. Apparently, the mouse liver secretes into bile the equivalent of its entire hepatic pool of PC during a 24-h period. Some of that PC is reabsorbed by the intestine as lyso-PC and is returned to the liver and other tissues (26Kuipers F. Elferink R.P.J.O. Verkade H.J. Groen A.K. Bitman R. Subcellular Biochemistry. 28. Plenum Press, New York1997: 295-318Google Scholar). Hence, the utilization of PC for bile secretion might be a major reason for the 50% decline in PC levels in liver after only 3 days. In addition, secretion of PC with lipoproteins and oxidation of choline to betaine will also impact on the PC concentrations in liver. The evolutionary pressure to retain PEMT in liver probably derives from an important role for this enzyme during starvation and during pregnancy/lactation. Humans and other animals store fat and glycogen as energy sources but do not store phospholipids. The concentration of plasma choline in healthy humans decreased from 9.5 ± 0.5 μmol/liter to 7.8 μmol/liter (p < 0.01) after a 7 day fast (27Savendahl L. Mar M.-H. Underwood L.E. Zeisel S.H. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1997; 66: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When animals undergo periods of starvation and, therefore, experience choline deficiency, the function of thePempt gene is likely to become important for provision of adequate PC for crucial metabolic processes. The current experiments show that the elimination of PE methylation greatly amplifies the consequences of choline deficiency. These results also prove that no alternative pathway, other than phospholipid methylation or the CDP-choline pathway, is of quantitative significance for generating PC or choline in mice. Thus, the decreased PC biosynthesis in Pempt −/− mice fed the CD diet results in the depletion of hepatic PC which rapidly leads to liver failure. We hypothesize that a key function of PE methylation is to sustain both hepatic synthesis of PC and production of the choline moiety derived from PC catabolism during starvation. Several years ago Zeisel et al. (28Zeisel S.H. Mar M.-H. Zhou Z. da Costa K.A. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 3049-3054PubMed Google Scholar) reported that pregnancy and lactation put a severe stress on the levels of choline-containing compounds in the female rat liver. For example, during pregnancy the concentrations of hepatic phosphocholine, betaine, and choline decreased by 50% or more in CD compared with CS rats. The decrease in these metabolites was even more striking in lactating animals. Even though PEMT deficiency does not decrease fecundity of these mice under laboratory conditions, most likely the possession of PEMT would be a significant advantage for survival of mother and pups, especially if choline intake were inadequate. We conclude that PEMT provides PC and choline when dietary choline is insufficient. The PEMT-deficient mice are also a valuable model for generating liver dysfunction, since the condition is experimentally controllable and, therefore, will allow the onset of disease to be precisely defined.

https://openalex.org/W1642886682,"It is essential to identify the exact location of the linker histone within nucleosomes, the fundamental packing units of chromatin, in order to understand how condensed, transcriptionally inactive chromatin forms. Here, using a site-specific protein-DNA photo-crosslinking method, we map the binding site and the orientation of the globular domain of linker histone H5 on mixed-sequence chicken nucleosomes. We show, in contrast to an earlier model, that the globular domain forms a bridge between one terminus of chromatosomal DNA and the DNA in the vicinity of the dyad axis of symmetry of the core particle. Helix III of the globular domain binds in the major groove of the first helical turn of the chromatosomal DNA, whereas the secondary DNA-binding site on the opposite face of the globular domain of histone H5 makes contact with the nucleosomal DNA close to its midpoint. We also infer that helix I and helix II of the globular domain of histone H5 probably face, respectively, the solvent and the nucleosome. This location places the basic carboxy-terminal region of the globular domain in a position from which it could simultaneously bind the nucleosome-linking DNA strands that exit and enter the nucleosome."

Whereas type I (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) implies ss-cell destruction, type II (non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), responsible for 75% of diabetic syndromes, involves diminished glucose-dependent secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells. Although a clear demonstration of a direct effect of 17beta-estradiol on the pancreatic ss-cell is lacking, an in vivo insulinotropic effect has been suggested. In this report we describe the effects of 17beta-estradiol in mouse pancreatic ss-cells. 17beta-Estradiol, at physiological concentrations, closes K(ATP) channels, which are also targets for antidiabetic sulfonylureas, in a rapid and reversible manner. Furthermore, in synergy with glucose, 17beta-estradiol depolarizes the plasma membrane, eliciting electrical activity and intracellular calcium signals, which in turn enhance insulin secretion. These effects occur through a receptor located at the plasma membrane, distinct from the classic cytosolic estrogen receptor. Specific competitive binding and localization of 17beta-estradiol receptors at the plasma membrane was demonstrated using confocal reflective microscopy and immunocytochemistry. Gaining deeper knowledge of the effect induced by 17beta-estradiol may be important in order to better understand the hormonal regulation of insulin secretion and for the treatment of NIDDM. receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2121582872,"Overexpression of the murine agouti gene results in obesity. The human homologue of agouti is expressed primarily in human adipocytes, and we have shown recombinant agouti protein to increase adipocyte intracellular Ca2+([Ca2+]i) and thereby stimulate lipogenesis. However, since recent data demonstrate that increasing adipocyte [Ca2+]i may also inhibit lipolysis, we have investigated the role of agouti-induced [Ca2+]i increases in regulating lipolysis in human adipocytes. Short-term (1 h) exposure to recombinant agouti (100 nM) protein had no effect on basal lipolysis, although longer term treatment (24 h) caused a 60% decrease in basal lipolysis (P<0.0001). Short-term agouti treatment totally inhibited ACTH-induced lipolysis (P<0.05). Since melanocortin receptors (MCR) are involved in some actions of agouti, we next determined whether agouti's antilipolytic effect is exerted through competitive antagonism of the ACTH receptor (MCR-2). Forskolin (1 microM), an adenylate cyclase activator, induced a 48% increase in lipolysis in human adipocytes (P<0.05); this effect was reversed by 100 nM agouti (P<005), demonstrating that the antilipolytic effect of agouti is distal to the ACTH receptor. To determine the role of [Ca2+]i in the antilipolytic effect of agouti, human adipocytes were treated with KCl or arginine vasopressin to stimulate voltage- and receptor-stimulated Ca2+ influx, respectively. Both agents caused inhibition of forskolin-induced lipolysis (P<0.005). Furthermore, agouti's antilipolytic effect was also blocked by the Ca2+ channel blocker nitrendipine. These data demonstrate that agouti exerts a potent antilipolytic effect in human adipocytes via a Ca2+-dependent mechanism. This effect, combined with agouti-induced lipogenesis, represents a coordinate control of adipocyte lipid metabolism that may contribute to an agouti-induced obesity syndrome."

This method led to a new evaluation of the concentration of osmium in seawater; the mean concentration of osmium and the 187Os/186Os ratio are equal to 10.86 +/- 0.07 picograms per kilogram and 8.80 +/- 0.07, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2011465438,"p53 tumor suppressor gene controls cell response to a variety of stresses inducing growth arrest or apoptosis in damaged cells. It largely determines the sensitivity of tumor and normal cells to radiation and chemotherapy, and, therefore, defines both the efficacy and limitations of anti-cancer treatment. To determine molecular mechanisms of p53-dependent stress response in normal tissues we identified and compared the spectra of radiation-responsive genes in cells of different origin and p53 status using a cDNA array hybridization technique. The majority of genes identified were p53-dependent and cell type specific. Several of the new p53 responders encode known secreted growth inhibitory factors. This suggests that p53, in addition to its intrinsic antiproliferation activity, can cause `bystander effect' by inducing export of growth suppressive stimuli from damaged cells to neighboring cells. Consistently, a p53-dependent accumulation of factors, which causes growth inhibitory effects in a variety of cell lines, was found after gamma irradiation in the media from established and primary cell cultures and in the urine of irradiated mice. Moreover, p53-dependent factors released by normal human fibroblasts potentiated the cytotoxic effect of a chemotherapeutic drug on co-cultivated tumor cells. This suggests a previously unknown role for normal cells in chemo- and radiation therapy of cancer."

To understand the role of the hormone, 3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyronine (T<sub>3</sub>), in the nuclear translocation and targeting of TRs to the regulatory sites in chromatin, we appended green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the human TR subtype β1 (TRβ1). The fusion of GFP to the amino terminus of TRβ1 protein did not alter T<sub>3</sub> binding or transcriptional activities of the receptor. The subcellular localization of GFP-TRβ1 in living cells was visualized by laser-scanning confocal microscopy. In the presence of T<sub>3</sub>, the expressed GFP-TRβ1 was predominately localized in the nucleus, exhibiting a nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of ∼5.5. No GFP-TRβ1 was detected in the nucleolus.

In these cells, cytoplasmic GFP-TRβ1 could be induced to enter the nucleus by T<sub>3</sub>.

https://openalex.org/W1849889294,"4F2hc is an almost ubiquitous transmembrane protein in mammalian cells; upon expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes, it induces amino acid transport with characteristics of system y+L. Indirect evidence fostered speculation that function requires the association of 4F2hc with another protein endogenous to oocytes and native tissues. We show that expression of system y+L-like amino acid transport activity by 4F2hc in oocytes is limited by an endogenous factor and that direct covalent modification of external cysteine residue(s) of an oocyte membrane protein blocks system y+L/4F2hc transport activity, based on the following. 1) Induction of system y+L-like activity saturates at very low doses of human 4F2hc cRNA (0.1 ng/oocyte). This saturation occurs with very low expression of 4F2hc at the oocyte surface, and further increased expression of the protein at the cell surface does not result in higher induction of system y+L-like activity. 2) Human 4F2hc contains only two cysteine residues (C109 and C330). We mutated these residues, singly and in combination, to serine (C109S; CS1, C330S; CS2 and C109S-C330S, Cys-less). Mutation CS2 had no effect on the expressed system y+L-like transport activity, whereas C109S-containing mutants (CS1 and Cys-less) retained only partial y+L-like transport activity (30 to 50% of wild type). 3) Hg2+, the organic mercury compounds pCMB, and the membrane-impermeant pCMBS almost completely inactivated system y+L-like induced by human 4F2hc wild type and all the mutants studied. This was reversed by ss-mercaptoethanol, indicating that external cysteine residue(s) are the target of this inactivation. 4) Sensitivity to Hg2+ inactivation is increased by pretreatment of oocytes with ss-mercaptoethanol or in the C109S-containing mutants (CS1 and Cys-less). The increased Hg2+ reactivity of C109S-containing mutants supports the possibility that C109 may be linked by a disulfide bond to the Hg2+-targeted cysteine residue of the associated protein. These results indicate that 4F2hc is intimately associated with a membrane oocyte protein for the expression of system y+L amino acid transport activity. To our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence for a heteromultimeric protein structure of an organic solute carrier in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2037474591,"LOH analysis suggests that multiple tumor suppressor genes play a role in the development of human TCC. The human homolog of the Drosophila PTCH was recently cloned and mapped to the BCNS locus on 9q22.3, a chromosomal region commonly deleted in TCCs. We first examined the steady state mRNA transcription of the PTCH, SMOH and GLI3 genes of the HH signal transduction pathway in TCC cell lines and normal urothelium. Normal urothelium and TCC cell lines express these three genes within the PTCH signal transduction pathway. We then screened for PTCH mutations in `hot spot' exons 6, 8, 13 and 16 by PCR/SSCP analysis of genomic DNAs from 54 TCC tumor samples and control autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes. DNA sequence analysis confirmed TCC-specific mutations in two of 54 patients (3.7%). These mutations resulted a single amino acid substitution and two frame shifts. One tumor had PTCH mutations in exon 16 as well as exon 13 and one tumor had a mutation in exon 13 alone. Both TCC tumors that contained PTCH mutations had a loss of heterozygosity at 9q. Although the PTCH protein has an unknown function in urothelial cells, the detection of the PTCH, SMOH and GLI3 transcripts in normal urothelium and TCC cell lines and rare PTCH mutations in tumor samples suggest that the HH pathway may have a role in controlling the proliferation of urothelial cells and that PTCH mutations may contribute to the development of a subset of TCCs."

We have examined a large panel of microsatellite markers on 8p for LOH in 53 ovarian adenocarcinomas. LOH was observed in 27 tumours (51%), with a significant trend towards a higher frequency of LOH in more advanced tumours. Detailed examination of nine tumours with partial deletions defined three regions of overlap, two in 8p23 and one in 8p22, which suggests that there might be as many as three tumour or metastasis suppressor genes on 8p which are inactivated during ovarian tumorigenesis. LOH on 8p was significantly associated with 9p LOH which suggests that inactivation of target genes on these chromosomes may be cooperative events."

Blots were autoradiographed using intensifying screens at −70 °C for 12 h. The mRNAs of control 293 and WT1-6 cells were extracted with the QuickPrep mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mRNAs were further purified by passing through a second oligo(dT) spin column (5 Prime → 3 Prime Inc., Boulder, CO). Two μg of each mRNA were used to perform SSH-PCR with the PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (CLONTECH) according to the method recommended by the manufacturer.

Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin). The cell lysates in SDS gel loading buffer were boiled for 5 min and separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (BA85, Schleicher & Schüll). The filter was probed with antibodies and visualized with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. Anti-WT1 antibody (C-180) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Anti-RbAp46 polyclonal antibody was prepared as a custom service from Alpha Diagnostic International by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 15 amino acids of RbAp46, the region that shows the least homology to RbAp48. Both antibodies were used at a concentration of 1:1000. To seek physiological target genes of WT1, we established a human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line that expresses an exogenous WT1 isoform without alternative splicing. The 293 cell line was chosen because it is derived from human embryonic kidney and therefore is likely to provide the necessary genetic background for WT1 to function. The 293 cells were transfected by a CMV-IE promoter-driven expression vector containing a full-length cDNA encoding WT1. One clone expressed WT1 at a level comparable with that of endogenous WT1 in promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells as determined by Western analysis (Fig. 1 a). Reverse transcription PCR amplification and DNA sequencing of the exogenous WT1 mRNA in this clone did not reveal any mutations (data not shown), and this cell line (WT1-6) was used for further investigation. WT1-6 cells also displayed a 2-fold lower growth rate compared with CMV-293 control cells (293 cells transfected with empty expression vector) (Fig. 1 b). These data are consistent with other reports that WT1 can inhibit cell proliferation (6Werner H. Shen-Orr Z. Rauscher III., F.J. Morris J.F. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3516-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 11Kudoh T. Ishidate T. Moriyama M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30760-30764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and indicate that exogenous WT1 is functionally active in the WT1-6 cells. Since WT1-6 and CMV-293 cells share a similar genetic background, a subtraction analysis of expressed genes between these two cell lines is likely to eliminate most genes expressed in common and identify the genes that are subject to regulation by WT1. We performed SSH-PCR with mRNAs from these two cell lines to identify genes that are up-regulated in WT1-6 cells. After two rounds of subtraction by SSH-PCR, we obtained multiple distinct cDNA fragments. More than eight DNA fragments corresponded to different regions of wt1cDNA, indicating that the subtraction was successful. Three cDNA fragments did not match any DNA sequences in GeneBankTM. Two of the other fragments were known genes; one was human fragile X mental retardation protein (FMR-1) and the other was RbAp46, a protein first identified as one that physically interacts with Rb. The levels of RbAp46 transcripts were about 15-fold higher in the WT1-6 cells than in the CMV-293 cells, as demonstrated by Northern analysis with the SSH-PCR product as a probe (Fig. 2 a). However, the expression of RbAp48, a protein that co-purifies with RbAp46 in an Rb affinity column and shares 89.4% amino acid sequence identity with RbAp46 (16Qian Y.W. Lee E.H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25507-25513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), was the same in these two cell lines (Fig. 2 b), indicating that the up-regulation of RbAp46 in the WT1-6 cells is gene-specific. To obtain the full-length cDNA of RbAp46, we screened a human placenta cDNA library with a cDNA fragment generated by SSH-PCR as a probe. Four positive clones were obtained after tertiary screening, and the longest one (∼1.9 kb) was fully sequenced. The clone starts at residue 80 of the published RbAp46 cDNA in the 5′-untranslated region and ends at the same position (data not shown). DNA sequencing of the RbAp46 cDNA revealed a single open reading frame coding for 425 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 47.8 kDa. Homologues of RbAp46 have been cloned from tomato and Arabidopsis thaliana that share 65% amino acid sequence identity with the human protein (21Ach R.A. Taranto P. Gruissem W. Plant Cells. 1997; 9: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The high degree of conservation of the RbAp46 gene during the course of evolution indicates its biological importance. To examine whether RbAp46 can mediate some of the functions previously ascribed to WT1, we performed a colony formation assay in several cell lines, including two osteosarcoma cell lines (U2OS and Saos-2), whose growth is known to be suppressed by WT1 (12Englert C. Hou X.-Y. Maheswaran S. Bennett P. Ngwu C. Re G.G. Garvin A.J. Rosner M.R. Haber D.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4662-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), CV-1 cells derived from African green monkey kidney and whose growth is also inhibited by WT1 (11Kudoh T. Ishidate T. Moriyama M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4517-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and 293 cells, which have not been tested before. Cells were transfected with expression vectors containing cDNA for WT1 or RbAp46 (driven by the CMV-IE promoter) and the neomycin-resistant (neo R) gene and selected with G418 for 3 weeks. Table I summarizes the results of several independent experiments. In CV-1, 293, U2OS, and Saos-2 cells, both WT1 and RbAp46 suppressed the emergence of neo Rcolonies to a similar degree. These data suggest that like WT1, RbAp46 has growth-inhibiting activity. The functional similarity between WT1 and RbAp46 also suggests that RbAp46 is a downstream mediator of WT1's function. Interestingly, RbAp48, the RbAp46 homologue, also suppressed the emergence of drug-resistant colonies (albeit with lower efficiency) in the two osteosarcoma cell lines (Table I), indicating that RbAp48 also has growth inhibiting activity.Table ISuppression of colony formation by RbAp46, WT1, and RbAp48Cell lineG418-resistant colonies/dishMockVectorRbAp46WT1RbAp48U2OS0456 ± 25136 ± 12191 ± 5274 ± 5Saos-20 ± 187 ± 918 ± 229 ± 345 ± 2CV-1061 ± 418 ± 523 ± 7ND2930467 ± 14194 ± 9170 ± 15NDAll cells were transfected by calcium-phosphate/DNA precipitation with CMV-IE promoter-driven constructs containing wild type WT1 and RbAp46 (20 μg) linked to the neomycin-resistant gene and selected with G418 for 3 weeks.

Open table in a new tab All cells were transfected by calcium-phosphate/DNA precipitation with CMV-IE promoter-driven constructs containing wild type WT1 and RbAp46 (20 μg) linked to the neomycin-resistant gene and selected with G418 for 3 weeks. G418-resistant colonies were stained and counted. The numbers of colonies/dish shown were derived from a representative experiment (±S.D.). To determine whether the reduced growth rate of WT1-6 cells results from the induced expression of RbAp46, we transfected 293 cells with a CMV promoter-driven expression vector of RbAp46 and selected transfected cells with G418. The clonally isolated colonies were examined by Northern analysis using RbAp46 cDNA as a probe. A distinct 2.0-kb transcript was highly expressed in the RbAp46-transfected cells (Fig. 3 a). Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibody raised against the final 15 amino acids of RbAp46 confirmed that the RbAp46 (∼50 kDa) protein was highly expressed in the cloned cells (Fig. 3 b). Two clones expressed RbAp46 at levels comparable with that in the WT1-6 cells, as determined by Western analysis (Fig. 3 b). Furthermore, Western analysis indicated that the levels of WT1 expression in these two cell lines were similar to that of control CMV-293 cells (data not shown). This result excludes the possibility that overexpression of RbAp46 up-regulates WT1 expression due to a feedback mechanism. These two cell clones (p46-1 and p46-2) were then used for further investigation. The p46-1, p46-2, and control CMV-293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. The growth rate of each cell line was determined by counting the number of cells daily. The cell lines expressing high levels of exogenous RbAp46 (p46-1 and p46-2) had a 2-fold lower growth rate than CMV-293 cells (Fig. 3 c), similar to the patterns observed with WT1-6 cells (Fig. 1 b). These data indicate that the high levels of RbAp46 reduce growth of transfected 293 cells and suggest that the reduced growth rate of WT1-6 cells may be a result of the up-regulation of RbAp46. Since WT1 is required for urogenital development (22Kreidberg J.A. Sariola J.M. Loring J.M. Maeda M. Pelletier J. Housman D.E. Jaenish R. Cell. 1993; 74: 679-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar), we investigated whether RbAp46 is co-expressed with WT1 in the developing kidney and gonad. We examined developing kidney from a 13-day postcoitus mouse embryo by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Our results demonstrated that RbAp46 is highly expressed in condensed metanephric mesenchyme (Fig. 4, B and C), a site of WT1 expression (23Pelletier J. Schalling M. Buckler A.J. Rogers A. Haber D.A. Housman D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 24Pritchard-Jones K. Fleming S. Davidson D. Bickmore W. Porteous D. Gosden C. Bard J. Buckler A. Pelletier J. Housman D. van Heyningen V. Hastie N. Nature. 1990; 346: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). However, unlike WT-1, RbAp46 is not detected in the metanephric epithelial structures or the prospective podocyte layers in S-shaped bodies (Fig. 4 C). Whole-mount in situ hybridization also revealed a high level of RbAp46 expression at day 13 postcoitus in the developing gonad (Fig. 4 A), another site of WT1 expression. These data suggest that WT1 may up-regulate the expression of RbAp46 during urogenital development and that RbAp46, as a mediator of WT1's function, may play an important role in modulating cell growth and differentiation during the development of the urogenital system. Using SSH-PCR, we cloned the RbAp46 gene as a candidate target gene of WT1. The transcript levels of RbAp46 were up-regulated about 15-fold in 293 cells that express high levels of exogenous WT1. However, the mechanism by which RbAp46 is up-regulated in the WT1-expressing cells is not clear. WT1 may directly up-regulate the transcription of RbAp46 by binding to the promoter region of the RbAp46 gene or may act indirectly by activating an intermediate transcription factor. RbAp46 strongly inhibits colony formation and reduces the growth rate of transfected 293 cells to a degree similar to WT1, indicating that RbAp46 may be a downstream mediator of WT1's function. However, apoptosis of cells was not observed in the RbAp46 transfected cells, suggesting that RbAp46 may only mediate the function of WT1 as a growth inhibitor. The induction of p21 and suppression of epidermal growth factor receptor by WT1 may explain the induction of apoptosis by WT1 (10Englert C. Maheswaran S. Garvin A.J. Kreidberg J. Haber D.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1429-1434PubMed Google Scholar, 12Englert C. Hou X.-Y. Maheswaran S. Bennett P. Ngwu C. Re G.G. Garvin A.J. Rosner M.R. Haber D.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4662-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). What is the mechanism by which RbAp46 inhibits cell growth? The observation that RbAp46 interacts with Rb both in vivo and in vitro (16Qian Y.W. Lee E.H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25507-25513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Qian Y.W. Wang C.-Y. Hollingsworth R.E.J. Jones D. Ling N. Lee E.H.P. Nature. 1993; 364: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) suggests that RbAp46 may inhibit cell growth through an Rb-dependent pathway. However, this possibility is unlikely because the growth of Saos-2 cells is strongly suppressed by the expression of exogenous RbAp46 (Table I), even though Saos-2 cells express a nonfunctional Rb protein lacking the C-terminal region that interacts with RbAp46 (16Qian Y.W. Lee E.H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25507-25513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These data suggest that inhibition of cell growth by RbAp46 is not dependent on a functional Rb protein. Interestingly, RbAp46 has recently been demonstrated to exist with human histone deacetylases HDAC1, HDAC2, and RbAp48 in the mammalian transcriptional repressor mSin3 complex (25Zhang Y. Iratni R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Cell. 1997; 89: 357-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), suggesting that RbAp46 may be involved in histone metabolism related to the regulation of transcription. One hypothesis is that RbAp46 and/or RbAp48 may regulate histone metabolism by modulating the activities of HDAC1 and HDAC2, which are required for proper regulation of transcription. In this way, overexpression of regulatory components of mSin3 such as RbAp46 and/or RbAp48 may lead to titration of factors such as other components of the mSin3 complex and misregulation of subsets of genes, which ultimately alters the rate of cell growth. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that RbAp48 also has growth-inhibiting activity. The observation that RbAp46 is primarily localized in the developing kidney within similar structures that highly express WT1 further supports a role for RbAp46 as a downstream mediator of WT1 function during urogenital development. It is interesting that RbAp46 is expressed with WT1 in the condensed mesenchyme but not in differentiating epithelial structures. WT1 has been postulated to regulate stem cell survival and early differentiation in the metanephric blastema (22Kreidberg J.A. Sariola J.M. Loring J.M. Maeda M. Pelletier J. Housman D.E. Jaenish R. Cell. 1993; 74: 679-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). The pattern of RbAp46 expression in the developing kidney and the growth suppression properties of the protein might suggest that it functions to limit cell proliferation of induced mesenchyme and thus permit cell differentiation to proceed."

https://openalex.org/W1499698480,"The 'antioxidant hypothesis' proposes that vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, and other antioxidants occurring in fruit and vegetables afford protection against heart disease and cancer by preventing oxidative damage to lipids and to DNA, respectively. To test elements of this hypothesis, we have measured blood levels of dietary antioxidants, and 8-oxodeoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) concentrations in lymphocyte DNA, in healthy men and women from five European countries: France, Ireland, The Netherlands, Spain, and the U.K. Volunteers, aged 25 45, all nonsmokers, gave blood samples before and after a 12-wk carotenoid supplementation regime. Vitamin C was measured in plasma and vitamin E and carotenoids were measured in serum by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 8-oxo-dG was assayed by HPLC (with coulometric detection) in DNA isolated from lymphocytes from the same blood samples. Mean values were calculated for groups of volunteers at each sampling time according to country, sex, and supplementation (between 9 and 24 individual samples contributing to each mean). We found that 8-oxo-dG levels in lymphocyte DNA vary significantly according to sex and country. A low mean 8-oxo-dG concentration is seen in DNA of women from all five countries, and of men from France and Spain. 8-oxo-dG is significantly higher (up to about threefold) in lymphocyte DNA from men in Ireland and the U.K. Oxidative DNA damage is not significantly affected by carotenoid supplementation; nor is there any association with mean baseline levels of antioxidants, which are generally similar in the five countries. The five countries sampled lie on an axis from northern to southern Europe with a steep gradient in terms of premature heart disease. There is a strong association between premature coronary heart disease mortality in men and the mean levels of 8-oxo-dG for the five countries (r = 0.95, P < 0.01). Women have low coronary heart disease mortality rates, which do not correlate with 8-oxo-dG. In terms of cancer deaths, only colorectal cancer in men shows a significant positive correlation (r = 0.91, P < 0.05), and stomach cancer in women is negatively correlated with DNA oxidation (r = -0.92, P = 0.01)."

The presequence is removed by a stromal processing peptidase (SPP)1upon import of the precursor (3Robinson C. Ellis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 330-342Google Scholar). Some imported proteins are subsequently directed to the thylakoid membrane or lumen. Transit peptides of lumen proteins contain, in addition to the stromal-targeting domain, a thylakoid-targeting domain that is removed by TPP while crossing the thylakoid or immediately thereafter (2Cline K.

A partially purified SPP acted on several precursors of plastid proteins (3Robinson C. Ellis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 330-342Google Scholar).

A consensus cleavage site, (Ile/Val)-X-(Ala/Cys)-↓-Ala, was derived from comparing precursors of chloroplast proteins (10von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). However, this motif was absent in many cases. In general, SPP cleavage sites lack significant primary sequence similarity or a conserved secondary structure motif (1de Boer A.D. Weisbeek P.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Differences exist between the consensus domain mentioned above and the ones preceding SPP cleavage sites in precursors of lumen (OE23, OE33, and PC) and thylakoid (LHCPII) proteins, in which a Lys residue is often present immediately before the cleavage site. Thus, whereas SPP appears to have a wide specificity, it is possible that several peptidases exist with preference toward subsets of plastid precursors and partial overlap in activity toward various substrates. The SPP cleavage sites in precursors of three lumen proteins (plastocyanin, OE23, and OE33) were determined by Edman degradation after processingin vitro of precursors labeled with specific3H-labeled amino acids (12Bassham D.C. Bartling D. Mould R.M. Dunbar B. Weisbeek P. Herrmann R.G. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23606-23610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all cases, cleavage occurred immediately after a positively charged residue. Otherwise, the site exhibited no common elements of either primary or secondary structure (12Bassham D.C. Bartling D.

However, the charged residue was not essential for cleavage. PPOs (polyphenol oxidases, or benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductase (EC1.10.3.2)) are copper metaloproteins that catalyze the oxidation of o-dihydroxy phenols to quinones (13Mayer A.M. Harel E.

A 67-kDa tomato pPPO was routed to the lumen in two steps by plastids from a variety of plants (22Sommer A. Ne'eman E. Steffens J.C. Mayer A.M. Harel E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Import to the stroma was followed by removal of the N-terminal domain of the transit peptide. The resulting 62-kDa intermediate continued to the thylakoid lumen by a light-dependent reaction and accumulated as the 59-kDa mature protein (22Sommer A. Ne'eman E. Steffens J.C. Mayer A.M. Harel E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We report on the purification and some properties of a SPP from pea plastids. It differs in apparent size and other properties from stromal peptidases reported earlier. This SPP was able to process the precursors of tomato PPOs as well as other lumen and stromal proteins. However, it was inactive toward precursors of LHCPs and phytoene desaturase and did not react with antibodies for CPE. It is shown that the in vitro cleavage site of pPPO by the purified SPP is identical to the one observed in the stroma of intact plastids, as determined by Edman degradation. The stromal processing site appears to differ from the ones reported for other lumen proteins. Pea and tomato seedlings were grown as described previously (22Sommer A. Ne'eman E. Steffens J.C. Mayer A.M. Harel E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All transcription plasmids contained the entire coding sequence, including the transit peptide, of the respective genes. The coding sequence of tomato ppoA (23Newman S.M. Eannetta N.T., Yu, H.

The latter vector was formed by changing theEcoRI site of pSP64poly(A) (Promega) to a XmnI site, to enable linearization. ppoC and ppoE from tomato were cloned into the SmaI site of pSP64poly(A)XmnI. The L68M mutant of pPPOA had a Met instead of Leu at position 68 of the transit peptide. It was prepared by replacing nucleotides 176–662 of the coding sequence (23Newman S.M. Eannetta N.T., Yu, H.

The gene encoding pSSU of Rubisco was cloned in pSP81/4 (32Lubben T.H. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5502-5506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cesium chloride-purified plasmid DNAs were linearized with the appropriate restriction enzyme, except for the plasmids harboring the OE23 and OE33 clones. Linearized DNA was purified and transcribed as described (22Sommer A. Ne'eman E. Steffens J.C. Mayer A.M. Harel E.

The resulting RNAs were purified and translated using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (PPO precursors and pPDS) or wheat germ system (all other precursors) as described (22Sommer A. Ne'eman E. Steffens J.C. Mayer A.M. Harel E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The coding region of ppoAwas cloned into pDS12-RBSII-2 (33Paulsen H. Ruemler U. Rudiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). pPPOA was overexpressed, and inclusion bodies were purified as described (33Paulsen H. Ruemler U. Rudiger W. Planta. 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Radioactively labeled pPPOA was prepared by adding a 35S-labeledl-cysteine/l-methionine mixture (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to bacteria grown on a sulfur-deficient medium. pPPOA was solubilized using 8 m urea, 8 mmdithiothreitol and diluted to 400 mm urea, 3 mmdithiothreitol immediately before use. Chloroplasts isolation, import of radioactively labeled precursors by intact plastids, and the subsequent analysis of suborganelle fractions, including thermolysin treatment, were performed as described previously (22Sommer A. Ne'eman E. Steffens J.C. Mayer A.M. Harel E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Translocation across thylakoids was assayed with membranes obtained after lysing intact plastids as described (34Brock I.W. Hazel L. Michl D. Nielsen V.S. Møller B.L. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 23: 717-725Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), using 10 μg of chlorophyll, 1 mml-methionine, and 30,000 cpm of35S-labeled pPPOA in a total volume of 20 μl in light. Purification from stromal extracts, obtained after lysing intact plastids, is described in the legend to Fig. 2. Processing was determined after incubating enzyme fractions in 50 mm Hepes/KOH buffer pH 7 at 25o for 30 min, with 30,000 cpm of 35S-labeled pPPOA. Activity was estimated by densitometry of fluorograms after SDS-PAGE. It was expressed as cpm in the intermediate band (iPPO) derived from the density of the translation products band and occasionally verified by extracting and counting the radioactivity in gel strips as described previously (35Yalovsky S. Ne'eman E. Schuster G. Paulsen H. Harel E. Nechushtai R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20689-20693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled pPPOA or pPPOE was prepared by in vitro translation of the respective mRNAs in the presence of high specific radioactivity (40–190 Ci/mmol) 3H-labeled amino acid (l-[2,3,4,5-3H]proline,l-[4,5-3H]leucine,l-[4,5-3H]lysine,l-[2,3,5,6-3H]tyrosine, andl-[3,4(n)-3H]valine) or withl-[35S]methionine. The labeled precursor was processed in vitro by purified SPP or in the stroma of intact plastids in the presence of 5 mm MgATP and 15 μm CCCP in the dark, to prevent translocation to the lumen and further processing. The resulting intermediate was purified by SDS-PAGE (while adding thioglycolate to 100 μm to the upper buffer) and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride filter (Immobilon-PSQ, pore size, 0.45 μm, Millipore Membranes) in 100 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11, containing 10% methanol. The 62-kDa band was located by autoradiography or by counting strips of the filter for radioactivity. It was excised and lysozyme (25 pmol per analyzed band) added as a reference for the fidelity of degradation. The radiolabeled polypeptide was analyzed with a 476A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) equipped with an on-line phenyl thiohydantion analyzer linked to a fraction collector. Each cycle fraction was counted for3H or 35S radioactivity. SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (22Sommer A. Ne'eman E. Steffens J.C. Mayer A.M. Harel E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 35Yalovsky S. Ne'eman E. Schuster G. Paulsen H. Harel E. Nechushtai R. J. Biol.

Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3742) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll and protein determination were carried out as described earlier (37Chitnis P.R. Harel E. Kohorn B.D. Tobin E.M. Thornber J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 982-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed as described (22Sommer A. Ne'eman E. Steffens J.C. Mayer A.M. Harel E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) using the anti-FtsH antibodies described by Lindahl et al. (38Lindahl M. Tabak S. Cseke L. Pichersky E. Andersson B.

Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7177-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for visualization. The 62-kDa intermediate of pPPOA processing by intact plastids was readily observed when import was slowed down or thylakoid translocation interfered with. When plastids were incubated with MgATP, either in the dark with CCCP or with nigericin in light to collapse the ΔpH, only iPPOA was formed (Fig. 1 A). When the factor blocking thylakoid translocation was removed,e.g. by illuminating plastids that had carried out import in the dark, or removing CCCP with bovine serum albumin followed by illumination (39Creighton A. Hulford A. Mant A. Robinson D. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1663-1669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), iPPOA that had accumulated in the stroma was converted to the lumenal 59-kDa mature form (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2). Results also suggested that light was required for translocation across thylakoids or processing by TPP, not for the interaction of iPPO with the membrane (Fig. 1 A). Lysed plastids converted iPPO that had accumulated in darkness to mature PPO in light. The latter remained bound to thylakoids upon fractionation (Fig. 1 B) and was resistant to thermolysin (not shown). Preparations of stromal proteins from pea, tobacco, or tomato cleaved the 67-kDa precursor of PPOA to a form that co-migrated in SDS-PAGE with iPPOA produced by intact plastids (not shown). Stromal extracts from pea plastids were most active, as they were toward precursors of other plastid proteins: PC, PsaD, SSU, OE23, and OE33 (not shown). The SPP presumed to be involved in the first processing step of pPPO routing was purified from pea chloroplasts. The stromal extract obtained by lysing intact plastids was fractionated on a sucrose gradient that separated SPP from Rubisco and other major plastid proteins (Fig. 2 A). SPP was further purified by two consecutive HPLC runs on Resource Q (Fig. 2,B and C), resulting in an overall purification of 4800-fold in the purest fraction (Table I). This value is probably an overestimate because iPPO degradation by stromal proteinases takes place in crude extracts. When fractions 6–8 (Fig. 2 C) were pooled and rerun on SDS-PAGE, the silver-stained gel showed a major band (estimated molecular mass, 75–80 kDa) and few minor contaminants upon overstaining (Fig. 2 D). This fraction was not recognized by antibodies prepared against FtsH and CPE, which did react with a doublet of thylakoid proteins in the first case and another doublet around 140 kDa in stromal extracts, in the other (not shown). The product of pPPOA cleavage by purified SPP co-migrated with in organelle-accumulated iPPO (Fig. 2 E).Table IPurification of the SPP from pea chloroplastsPurification stepSPP activityProteinSpecific activityPurificationConcentrationContentcpm in iPPO/μl/minμg/mlμgcpm/mg of protein/minfoldStroma4.014,60024,0900.271Sucrose gradient (fractions 3 and 4)30.0271065041141Resource Q, 1st run (fractions 7–9)32.72801260117432Resource Q, 2nd run (fraction 7)46.3365313144811Data for the three purification steps are shown in Fig. 2. Open table in a new tab Data for the three purification steps are shown in Fig. 2. The highly purified SPP cleaved all six precursors of tomato PPO (four are shown in Fig. 3). It was also active toward precursors of other nuclear-encoded plastid proteins, targeted to either the stroma (the SSU of Rubisco), thylakoid membrane (PsaD), or lumen (PC, OE23, and OE33), forming products of the expected size. The purified SPP was unable to process precursors of thylakoid proteins, e.g. PDS, LHCPI, and LHCPII (Fig. 3). It seemed possible that intrinsic thyalkoid proteins require interaction with a stromal factor or proper integration into the membrane before processing by SPP could take place. However, adding stromal proteins did not facilitate processing of pLHCPII. When pLHCPI and pLHCPII were first inserted into isolated thylakoids and then exposed to purified SPP, no processing was observed (not shown). Up to 90% of pPPOA was converted to the 62-kDa intermediate during a 1-h incubation with purified SPP (not shown). The enzyme was active over a wide pH range with maxima around pH 7.0 and 8.5 (not shown). It was inhibited by 1,10-o-phenantroline and α,α′-dipyridyl but not by EDTA and inhibitors of serine- or thiol-proteases (Table II). Processing of all pPPOs was inhibited by low concentrations of Cu2+ (cf.Table II for pPPOA). Inhibition was probably due to interaction with the copper binding domains of PPO and prevention of unfolding (40Sommer A. Ne'eman E. Koussevitzky S. Hunt M.D. Steffens J.C. Mayer A.M. Harel E. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1995: 827-830Google Scholar). A similar effect was observed for the import of PPO by isolated chloroplasts (22Sommer A. Ne'eman E. Steffens J.C. Mayer A.M. Harel E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 40Sommer A. Ne'eman E. Koussevitzky S. Hunt M.D. Steffens J.C. Mayer A.M. Harel E. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1995: 827-830Google Scholar). The 62-kDa form produced in vitro by the action of purified SPP was converted to the mature form by isolated thylakoids from pea and tomato (Fig. 4). In tomato, some degradation to a 45-kDa form (cf. Ref. 14Steffens J.C. Harel E. Hunt M.D. Ellis B.E. Stafford H.A. Genetic Engineering of Plant Secondary Metabolism. Plenum Press, New York1994: 275-312Crossref Google Scholar) was observed (Fig. 4 B).

Results are the average of two independent experiments. The site at which pPPO was cleaved in vitro by purified SPP was determined by Edman degradation of the 62-kDa form. The intermediate was isolated by SDS-PAGE, after purified SPP was allowed to process pPPOA or pPPOE labeled with specific 3H-labeled amino acids, and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Results are shown for pPPOA and three of the3H-labeled amino acids employed (Fig. 5, B and C). Cleavage clearly occurred before a Val residue. Alignment of the sequence of the transit peptide with results of the Edman degradation pointed to Val67 as the residue immediately after the processing site. However, the radioactivity peaks in analyses employing [3H]Val (Fig. 5 B) suggested that the precursor might have been cleaved also before Val49.Similar results were obtained with pPPOE and tritiated Tyr or Val (not shown). The major processing site (Lys66-↓-Val67) seemed unusual compared with that of other lumen proteins (see under “Discussion”). Furthermore, the use of 3H-labeled amino acids resulted in low counts per degradation cycle, which added to the uncertainty regarding the apparent cleavage site. We resorted, therefore, to labeling with [35S]Met of much higher specific activity to enable sequencing of iPPO formed within intact plastids. Because no tomato pPPO contains Met residues in suitable positions, Leu68 was replaced by Met in pPPOA, and the iPPO formed in vitro by purified SPP or within plastids in darkness, in the presence of CCCP, was analyzed. Fig. 5 Dshows that the mutant PPOL68M precursor was imported, processed, and sorted by pea plastids similarly to the wild type and cleaved by purified SPP. Edman degradation of the resulting iPPOAs confirmed that Lys66-↓-Val67 is the major processing site both in vitro and in the intact organelle (Fig. 5 E). A secondary peak at cycle 20 of the purified SPP reaction corresponded with additional cleavage before Val49. The routing of PPOs follows the pattern of other nuclear-encoded lumen proteins (22Sommer A. Ne'eman E. Steffens J.C. Mayer A.M. Harel E.

https://openalex.org/W1586931401,"I-kappaBalpha is an intracellular protein that functions as a primary inhibitor of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB. Induction of the stress response with heat shock was previously demonstrated to induce I-kappaBalpha gene expression. Because the stress response can also be induced by nonthermal stimuli, we determined whether induction of the stress response with prostaglandin A1 (PGA1) would induce I-kappaBalpha gene expression. Treatment of human bronchial epithelium (BEAS-2B cells) with PGA1 induced nuclear translocation of heat shock factor 1, thus confirming that PGA1 induces the stress response in BEAS-2B cells. Induction of the stress response with PGA1 increased I-kappaBalpha mRNA expression in a time-dependent manner and increased I-kappaBalpha peptide expression. Transient transfection assays involving a human I-kappaBalpha promoter-luciferase reporter construct demonstrated that induction of the stress response with PGA1 activated the I-kappaBalpha promoter. Induction of the stress response with PGA1 and concomitant induction of I-kappaBalpha were associated with inhibition of TNF-alpha-mediated secretion of interleukin 8 and with inhibition of TNF-alpha-mediated nuclear translocation and activation of NF-kappaB. These data demonstrate that induction of the stress response, by a nonthermal stimulus, increases I-kappaBalpha gene expression by a mechanism involving activation of the I-kappaBalpha promoter. Coupled with previous data demonstrating heat shock-mediated induction of I-kappaBalpha gene expression, these data suggest that I-kappaBalpha may be considered to be one of the stress proteins. The functional consequences of stress response-mediated I-kappaBalpha gene expression may involve attenuation of cellular proinflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2011061517,"δ-Atracotoxins from the venom of Australian funnel-web spiders are a unique group of peptide toxins that slow sodium current inactivation in a manner similar to scorpion α-toxins. To analyze their interaction with known sodium channel neurotoxin receptor sites, we studied their effect on [3H]batrachotoxin and 125I-Lqh II (where Lqh is α-toxin II from the venom of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus) binding and on alkaloid toxin-stimulated 22Na+ uptake in rat brain synaptosomes. δ-Atracotoxins significantly increased [3H]batrachotoxin binding yet decreased maximal batrachotoxin-activated 22Na+ uptake by 70–80%, the latter in marked contrast to the effect of scorpion α-toxins. Unlike the inhibition of batrachotoxin-activated22Na+ uptake, δ-atracotoxins increased veratridine-stimulated 22Na+ uptake by converting veratridine from a partial to a full agonist, analogous to scorpion α-toxins. Hence, δ-atracotoxins are able to differentiate between the open state of the sodium channel stabilized by batrachotoxin and veratridine and suggest a distinct sub-conductance state stabilized by δ-atracotoxins. Despite these actions, low concentrations of δ-atracotoxins completely inhibited the binding of the scorpion α-toxin, 125I-Lqh II, indicating that they bind to similar, or partially overlapping, receptor sites. The apparent uncoupling between the increase in binding but inhibition of the effect of batrachotoxin induced by δ-atracotoxins suggests that the binding and action of certain alkaloid toxins may represent at least two distinguishable steps. These results further contribute to the understanding of the complex dynamic interactions between neurotoxin receptor site areas related to sodium channel gating. δ-Atracotoxins from the venom of Australian funnel-web spiders are a unique group of peptide toxins that slow sodium current inactivation in a manner similar to scorpion α-toxins.

Recently, the three-dimensional solution structure for δ-atracotoxin-Hv1 (8Fletcher J.I. Chapman B.E. Mackay J.P. Howden M.E.H. King G.F.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) has been determined. Both display a small three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet with an “inhibitor cystine knot” motif (10Pallaghy P.K. Neilsen K.J. Craik D.J. Norton R.S. Protein Sci. 1993; 3: 1833-1839Crossref Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Interestingly the three-dimensional fold of these toxins is different from the previously determined structures of the scorpion α-toxins AaH II (11Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Almassy R.J. Suddath F.L. Bugg C.E. Toxicon. 1982; 20: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and LqhαIT (12Tugarinov V. Kustanovich I. Zilberberg N. Gurevitz M. Anglister J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) despite similar actions on sodium current inactivation (13Strichartz G.R. Wang G.K. J. Gen.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5941-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Out of the seven identified neurotoxin receptor sites on the voltage-gated sodium channel, determined by direct radiolabeled toxin studies, at least two receptor sites were shown to bind various peptide toxins from different animal venoms that inhibit sodium current inactivation. Scorpion α-toxins and sea anemone toxins such as ATX II bind to the so-called neurotoxin receptor site 3 and δ-conotoxins which bind to receptor site 6 on the α-subunit of the sodium channel (Refs. 15Fainzilber M.

Both of these receptor sites have been shown to have complex allosteric interactions with neurotoxin receptor site 2 shown to bind several alkaloid toxins such as batrachotoxin and veratridine (17Gordon D. Lazarowici P. Gutman Y. Toxins and Signal Transduction. Harwood Press, Amsterdam1997: 119-149Google Scholar). The alkaloid toxins induce persistent activation of sodium channels by shifting the voltage dependence of activation to very negative membrane potentials and inhibiting the inactivation process (18Hille B. Leibowitz M.D. Sutro J.B. Schwarz J.R. Holan G. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1987; 41: 109-124PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 308-328Google Scholar). Scorpion α-toxins were shown to cooperatively enhance the effect of alkaloid toxins by increasing their binding affinity and activity (20Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8669-8676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ray R. Morrow C.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7307-7313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on apparent similarity in the effect of scorpion α-toxins and δ-atracotoxins, the aim of the present study was to determine the likely receptor binding site of funnel-web spider toxins on the sodium channel and their possible interaction with alkaloid toxin binding and action using both 22Na+ uptake and radiolabeled neurotoxin binding assays. We report that δ-atracotoxins interact with nanomolar affinities with neurotoxin receptor site 3 in rat brain synaptosomes but exhibit unusual allosteric interactions with the site 2 alkaloid toxin receptor. Colonies of male A. robustus and female H. versuta spiders were “milked” by direct aspiration from the chelicerae of live spiders using glass pipettes. Collected crude venom was flushed from pipettes using 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and initial fractionation performed via reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Vydac semi-preparative column (C18, 10.4 × 250 mm, 15 μm) on a Waters HPLC system. Elution of venom components was performed using a linear gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 36 min with a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The fraction containing δ-atracotoxin-Ar1 eluted with approximately 43% acetonitrile, whereas δ-atracotoxin-Hv1 eluted with 40% acetonitrile. These fractions were lyophilized and then resuspended in 25% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in preparation for further purification on a Vydac analytical column (C18, 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm). The funnel-web spider toxins were eluted from the analytical column using a linear gradient of 25–50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Purity of eluted toxins was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing and alkylating conditions with a Tris/Tricine buffer system. Protein concentration was determined using amino acid composition analysis. Toxins were stored lyophilized at −20 °C until required, at which time they were dissolved in 20 mm HEPES-Tris (pH 6.0, 4 °C). AaH II and Lqh II were purified according to the methods of Miranda et al. (22Miranda F. Kopeyan C. Rochat H. Rochat C. Lissitzky S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 16: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and Sautièreet al. (23Sautière P. Cestèle S. Kopeyan C. Martinage A. Drobecq H. Doljansky Y. Gordon D. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1141-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) respectively. Batrachotoxin was a generous gift from Dr. John Daly (Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Lqh II (catalogue number LTX001) was purchased from Latoxan (AP-1724, 05150 Rosans, France). Tetrodotoxin was purchased from Calbiochem (Alexandria, New South Wales, Australia), and veratridine was obtained from Sigma. [3H]BTX and carrier-free 22Na+ were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. All other chemicals were of analytical or HPLC grade. Whole cell patch clamp recordings of tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium currents were made from both dorsal root ganglion and periaqueductal gray neurons. Acutely dissociated dorsal ganglion neurons were prepared from 4- to 12-day-old Wistar rats according to the methods of Nicholson et al. (5Nicholson G.M. Willow M. Howden M.E.H. Narahashi T. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 428: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,6Nicholson G.M. Walsh R. Little M.J. Tyler M.I. Pfluegers Arch. 1998; 436: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Micropipettes (0.67–2 megohms) were pulled from borosilicate glass capillary tubing and were filled with (in mm) CsF 135, NaCl 10, HEPES 5 with the pH adjusted to 7.0 with 1 m CsOH. The external solution contained (in mm) NaCl 30, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1.8, CsCl 5, KCl 5,d-glucose 25, HEPES 5, tetraethylammonium (TEA) chloride 20, tetramethylammonium chloride 70, with the pH adjusted to 7.4 with 1m TEA hydroxide. Membrane current recordings were made at ambient room temperature (22–25 °C). Large round light dorsal root ganglion cells with diameters of 20–40 μm were selected for experiments. Acutely dissociated periaqueductal gray neurons from adult Sprague- Dawley rats were prepared according to the methods of Connor and Christie (24Connor M. Christie M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 509: 47-58Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar) based on procedures outlined in Ingram et al. (25Ingram S. Wilding T.J. McCleskey E.W. Williams J.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, horizontal midbrain slices (between 270 and 300 μm thick) containing the periaqueductal gray were cut with a vibratome. Slices were then incubated for 2 min at 35 °C in 20 units/ml papain (pH 7.3). The slices were then placed in fresh solution containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and the periaqueductal gray region was subdissected from each slice with a fine tungsten wire and cells dissociated from the slices by gentle trituration. Micropipettes (2–4 megohms) were pulled from borosilicate glass capillary tubing and were filled with (in mm) CsCl 110, NaCl 20, EGTA 10, CaCl2 2, MgATP 2, HEPES 10 with the pH adjusted to 7.3 with 1 m CsOH. The external solution contained (in mm) NaCl 80, TEA chloride 60, MgCl2 5, CsCl 5, d-glucose 10; HEPES 10 with the pH adjusted to 7.4 with 1 m TEA hydroxide. Membrane current recordings were made at room temperature (21–25 °C). The experiments used in this study were rejected if there were large leak currents or currents showed signs of poor space clamping such as an abrupt activation of currents upon relatively small depolarizing pulses. Stimulation and recording were both controlled by an AxoData or pClamp data acquisition system (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data were filtered at 5 kHz (low pass Bessel filter), and digital sampling rate was 25–50 kHz. Leakage and capacitative currents were digitally subtracted with P-P/4 procedures, and series resistance compensation was >80% for all cells. Synaptosomes for22Na+ uptake and [3H]BTX binding assays were prepared from brains of male Wistar rats (4–8 weeks, 250–350 g) using a combination of homogenization and differential and density gradient centrifugation according to the method of Gray and Whittaker (26Gray E.G. Whittaker V.P. J. Anat. 1962; 96: 79-87PubMed Google Scholar) as described by Tamkun and Catterall (27Tamkun M.M. Catterall W.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 19: 78-86PubMed Google Scholar). Synaptosomes were suspended in a solution consisting of (in mm) choline chloride 130, KCl 5.4, MgSO4 0.8, d-glucose 5.5, and HEPES-Tris 50 (pH 7.4, 37 °C) and were stored in liquid nitrogen until required for 22Na+ uptake assays, or used within 3 h of preparation for [3H]BTX binding assays. For 125I-Lqh II binding studies, rat brain synaptosomes were prepared according to the method of Kanner (28Kanner B.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1207-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) using (in mm) d-mannitol 300, EDTA 10, HEPES 10 (pH 7.4, 4 °C), and Ficoll (type 400 Sigma) gradients (14Eitan M. Fowler E. Herrmann R. Duval A. Pelhate M. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5941-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A combination of proteinase inhibitors consisting of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (50 μg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μm), iodoacetamide (1 mm), and 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mm) was present in all buffers used for this procedure. Synaptosomes were frozen at −80 °C in mannitol buffer until use. Membrane protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay with BSA as a standard. The effect of δ-atracotoxins on 22Na+ uptake in rat brain synaptosomes was measured using the method described by Tamkun and Catterall (27Tamkun M.M. Catterall W.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 19: 78-86PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, rat brain synaptosomes (500 μg of membrane protein) were preincubated for 10 min with toxins in 100 μl of sodium-free preincubation medium at 37 °C. The preincubation22Na+ uptake medium contained (in mm) choline chloride 130, KCl 5.4, MgSO4 0.8, glucose 5.5, HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4) 50, and 1 mg/ml BSA. Uptake was initiated by adding 150 μl of assay medium containing (in mm) choline chloride 128, KCl 5.4, MgSO4 0.8, glucose 5.5, HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4) 50, NaCl 2.66, ouabain 5, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.9 μCi/ml carrier-free 22NaCl. After 5 s at 37 °C, uptake was terminated by the addition of 4 ml of ice-cold wash solution and rapid filtration through 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane filters (Millipore, Sydney, Australia). The wash solution consisted of (mM) choline chloride 163, CaCl2 1.8, MgSO4 0.8, HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4) 5, and 1 mg/ml BSA. Maximal22Na+ uptake was determined in the presence of 1 μm batrachotoxin, whereas uptake not mediated by the voltage-gated sodium channel was determined in the presence of 1 μm TTX. Nonspecific 22Na+ uptake was typically less than 35% of total uptake. Equilibrium competition and saturation assays were performed using increasing concentrations of the unlabeled toxin in the presence of a constant low concentration of the radiolabeled toxin. In order to obtain saturation curves (“cold” saturation), the specific radioactivity and the amount of bound toxin were calculated and determined for each toxin concentration. Equilibrium saturation or competition experiments were analyzed by the iterative computer program LIGAND, using “Cold saturation” and “Drug” analysis, respectively (Elsevier Biosoft, UK). The composition of the binding medium for 125I-Lqh II binding was (in mm) choline Cl 140, CaCl2 1.8, KCl 5.4, MgSO4 0.8, HEPES 25 (pH 7.4); d-glucose 10, BSA 2 mg/ml. Wash buffer composition was (in mm) choline Cl 140, CaCl2 1.8, KCl 5.4, MgSO4 0.8, HEPES 25 (pH 7.4), BSA 5 mg/ml. [3H]BTX binding experiments used the preincubation medium and wash solution as for22Na+ uptake experiments (see above). After incubation, reactions were terminated by dilution with 4 ml of ice-cold wash solution for [3H]BTX binding experiments or 2 ml of ice-cold wash solution for125I-Lqh II binding experiments. Separation of free from bound toxin was achieved by rapid filtration under vacuum using Whatman GF/C filters. The filter discs were washed with a further 2 × 4 ml of wash solution for [3H]BTX binding or 2 × 2 ml washes for125I-Lqh II binding. Experiments were performed according to a modification of the method described by Catterall and colleagues (29Catterall W.A. Morrow C.S. Daly J.W. Brown G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8922-8927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat brain synaptosomes (350 μg of protein/ml) were suspended in 0.2 ml of buffer containing 15 nm [3H]BTX (0.8 μCi). After incubation for 50 min at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was diluted with 4 ml of ice-cold wash buffer and filtered. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 300 μm veratridine and was typically 5–15% of total binding. Equilibrium saturation experiments were analyzed using EBDA and LIGAND computer programs (Elsevier Biosoft, UK). Lqh II was iodinated by IODO-GEN (Pierce) using 5 μg of toxin and 0.5 mCi of carrier-free Na125I according to Gordon and Zlotkin (30Gordon D. Zlotkin E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Competition binding experiments using 125I-Lqh II were performed according to the methods of Gordon et al. (31Gordon D. Martin-Eauclaire M.-F. Cestèle S. Kopeyan C. Carlier E. Ben Khalifa R. Pelhate M. Rochat H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8034-8045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The monoiodotoxin was purified via reverse-phase HPLC using a Vydac C18 column and a gradient of 5–90% B (A = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, B = acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, as described by Cestèleet al. (32Cestèle S. Ben Khalifa R. Pelhate M. Rochat H. Gordon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15153-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The concentration of the radiolabeled toxins was determined according to the specific activity of the125I corresponding to 4200–3450 dpm/fmol monoiodotoxin, depending on the time of use (the age of the iodine). Rat brain synaptosomes (40–50 μg protein/ml) were suspended in 0.2 ml of binding buffer, containing 125I-Lqh II. After incubation for 15 min at 22 °C, the reaction mixture was diluted with 2 ml of ice-cold wash buffer and filtered. Nonspecific toxin binding was determined in the presence of 100 nm unlabeled Lqh II and consisted typically of 5–10% of total binding. The IC 50 values obtained for inhibition of 125I-Lqh II binding were converted to K i values according to the relationship described by Cheng and Prusoff (33Cheng Y.-C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12221) Google Scholar). Equilibrium saturation of [3H]BTX binding data was fitted according to the following single-site hyperbolic equation mathematically equivalent to the Langmuir isotherm.[3H]BTX bound (nM)=Bmax×xKd+x(Eq. 1) where B max is the maximal number of moles of [3H]BTX bound, K d is the dissociation constant for [3H]BTX, and x is the total concentration of batrachotoxin. Mathematical curve fitting was accomplished using SigmaPlot version 4.14 for Macintosh. All curve fitting routines used a nonlinear least squares method and splining routines. All data are presented as means ± S.E. All experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate. Electrophysiological studies using whole cell patch clamp of dorsal root ganglion neurones have shown that δ-atracotoxins slow sodium current inactivation and shift the voltage dependence of activation in a manner similar to scorpion α-toxins (5Nicholson G.M. Willow M. Howden M.E.H. Narahashi T. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 428: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 6Nicholson G.M. Walsh R. Little M.J. Tyler M.I. Pfluegers Arch. 1998; 436: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, 30 nm δ-atracotoxin-Hv1 slows TTX-sensitive sodium current inactivation in both dorsal root ganglion neurons and periaqueductal gray neurons from rat brain. In addition, 30 nm δ-atracotoxin-Hv1 shifts the threshold of sodium channel activation by approximately 10 mV to more negative membrane potentials (Fig. 1, C and D). These actions are similar to those reported for scorpion α-toxins (13Strichartz G.R. Wang G.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 88: 413-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 34Couraud F. Martin-Moutot N. Koulakoff A. Berwald-Netter Y. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 192-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, δ-atracotoxin-Hv1 caused differential actions on peak sodium current amplitude in these two populations of neurons. In dorsal root ganglion neurons δ-atracotoxin-Hv1 caused a marked reduction in peak sodium current (Fig. 1 A), whereas in periaqueductal gray neurons there was no significant change in peak sodium current (Fig. 1 B). This is in contrast to scorpion α-toxins that typically increase peak sodium current (5Nicholson G.M. Willow M. Howden M.E.H. Narahashi T. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 428: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 6Nicholson G.M. Walsh R. Little M.J. Tyler M.I. Pfluegers Arch. 1998; 436: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Strichartz G.R. Wang G.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 88: 413-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Gonoi T. Hille B. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 2836-2842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Strichartz G.R. Rando T. Wang G.K. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1987; 10: 237-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given these similar actions on sodium currents, we further compared the actions of δ-atracotoxins with those of scorpion α-toxins to produce positive cooperativity with [3H]BTX binding, enhancement of alkaloid toxin-stimulated 22Na+ uptake, and competition in radioiodinated scorpion toxin binding assays. Scorpion α-toxins have been shown to act in a positive allosteric fashion to increase the binding of site 2 alkaloid toxins such as batrachotoxin (27Tamkun M.M. Catterall W.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 19: 78-86PubMed Google Scholar, 29Catterall W.A. Morrow C.S. Daly J.W. Brown G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8922-8927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore assessed the ability of δ-atracotoxins to enhance [3H]BTX binding to rat brain synaptosomes. δ-Atracotoxin-Hv1 was found to significantly enhance the binding of [3H]BTX approximately 12-fold with a concentration required for half-maximal enhancement (EC50) of 25.2 ± 4.5 nm(n = 4, Fig. 2 A). In comparison, AaH II-enhanced [3H]BTX binding under the same conditions gave a 5.6-fold increase in the maximal response (E max) with an EC50 of 14.4 ± 2.3 nm (Fig. 2 A, inset). In order to show that the enhancement of [3H]BTX binding represents an increase in binding to neurotoxin receptor site 2, δ-atracotoxin-Hv1-enhanced [3H]BTX binding was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled batrachotoxin or veratridine. Both alkaloid toxins were able to completely inhibit [3H]BTX binding enhanced by 3 μmδ-atracotoxin-Hv1 in a concentration-dependent manner indicating the enhancement is specifically mediated through receptor site 2 (Fig. 2 B). Analysis of batrachotoxin binding indicated that in the presence of 100 nm AaH II, 20 nm δ-atracotoxin-Hv1, or 3 μm δ-atracotoxin-Hv1, [3H]BTX binds to a single class of high affinity binding sites (Table I) in agreement with earlier studies (29Catterall W.A. Morrow C.S. Daly J.W. Brown G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8922-8927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of scorpion α-toxins or sea anemone toxins, the estimated K d for [3H]BTX was reported to be 700 nm (29Catterall W.A. Morrow C.S. Daly J.W. Brown G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8922-8927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the present conditions, theK d of [3H]BTX in the absence of enhancement was 862 ± 310 nm. The addition of either AaH II or δ-atracotoxin-Hv1 reduced the K dapproximately 3.2-fold while not significantly altering the total number of binding sites (see Table I). To examine if AaH II and δ-atracotoxin-Hv1 enhance [3H]BTX binding by interacting with closely related or distinct receptor sites, the increase in [3H]BTX binding was determined in the simultaneous presence of the two polypeptide toxins (Fig. 2 B, inset). Addition of increasing concentrations of AaH II in the presence of saturating concentrations of δ-atracotoxin-Hv1 (10 μm) did not further enhance [3H]BTX binding as compared with δ-atracotoxin-Hv1 alone. These data indicate that δ-atracotoxin-Hv1 and AaH II may bind to a common receptor site and enhance [3H]BTX binding in a similar manner.Table IEffect of AaH II and δ-atracotoxin-Hv1 on [3H]BTX bindingToxinConcentrationBTXK dBTX B maxmnmpmol/mg proteinAaH II10 × 10−8267 ± 534.4 ± 0.7δ-Atracotoxin-Hv12 × 10−8241 ± 174.3 ± 0.5δ-Atracotoxin-Hv13 × 10−6196 ± 376.1 ± 0.5Rat brain synaptosomes were incubated with 15 nm[3H]BTX and increasing concentrations of unlabeled batrachotoxin in the presence of the indicated concentrations of AaH II or δ-atracotoxin-Hv1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data have been presented as the means ± S.E.

https://openalex.org/W1927221034,"Susceptibility to drug-induced coronary vasospasm in rhesus monkeys increases after removal of the ovaries and can be normalized by adding back physiological levels of estradiol-17ss (E2) and/or natural progesterone (P) in vivo as reported recently by our group. Furthermore, the reactivity status (Ca2+ and protein kinase C responses) of freshly isolated and primary culture coronary artery vascular muscle cells (VMC) mimic the intact coronary artery responses to 5-HT + U46619. Since coronary reactivity is maintained in the isolated VMC, we hypothesized that the reactivity state inherent in the VMC was modulated directly by ovarian steroids in vitro as in the whole animal. To test this hypothesis, we treated hyperreactive VMC from ovariectomized (ovx) monkeys in vitro with E2 or P and measured VMC reactivity to combined stimulation with 5-HT and U46619, as determined by the amplitude and especially the duration of intracellular Ca2+ signals, as well as protein kinase C (PKC) activation/translocation. VMC were treated for 12 96 h with 3 100 pg/ml E2 (10 365 pM) and/or 0.3 3 ng/ml P (0.95 9.5 nM). Hyperreactive responses to the combination of 5-HT and U46619 in untreated VMC were significantly and dose-dependently reduced by treatment in vitro with physiological levels of either E2 or P for at least 24 h. Both the early transient and late sustained increases in intracellular Ca2+ and PKC translocation were blunted, and the effects of 0.2 nM E2 and 3.2 nM P were specifically antagonized by the receptor blockers ICI 182,780 (200 nM) and RU486 (15 nM), respectively. Antibodies to the estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor labeled nuclei in VMC, which were also positively labeled by a smooth muscle myosin heavy chain monoclonal antibody. These data indicate that natural ovarian steroids directly reduce hyperreactive 5-HT and thromboxane A2-stimulated Ca2+ and PKC responses of coronary artery VMC from surgically menopausal rhesus macaques. We hypothesize that vascular hyperreactivity, which may be a critical factor involved in the increased incidence of coronary artery vasospasm and ischemic heart disease in postmenopausal women, can be normalized by E2 and/or P through direct actions on coronary artery vascular muscle cells."

We show that in 7TD1 mouse hybridoma cells a DMSO-induced reversible G1 arrest involves inactivation of Rb kinases, cyclin D2/CDK4 and cyclin E/CDK2. This occurs by at least three distinct mechanisms. Inhibition of cyclin D2 neosynthesis leads to a dramatic decrease of cyclinD2/CDK4 complexes. This in turn enables the redistribution of p27[KIP1] from cyclin D2/CDK4 to cyclin E/CDK2 complexes. In addition, the simultaneous accumulation of p21[CIP1] entails increasing association with cyclin D3/CDK4 and cyclin E/CDK2. Thus, p21[CIP1] and p27[KIP1], act in concert to inhibit cyclin E/CDK2 activity which, together with CDK4 inactivation, confers a G1-phase arrest."

To define the transport pathways of proteins involved in the celiac immune response, we wished to determine the subcellular compartments of the intestinal mucosa where wheat gliadin peptides colocalize with receptors of T lymphocytes, including alpha/beta-TCR, gamma/delta-TCR, and CD8. Semithin and ultrathin frozen section of jejunal biopsies from CD patients and controls were used to perform immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling as well as in situ hybridization experiments. In patients with active CD, we detected gliadin peptides in vacuoles and Golgi complexes of enterocytes. CD8, alpha/beta-TCR, and gamma/delta-TCR were found in vacuoles and Golgi complexes within these gliadin-containing enterocytes in addition to the surface of intraepithelial and mucosal T lymphocytes. In contrast, we observed that the localization of CD4, CD3, T cell-restricted intracellular antigen (TIA), and leukocyte common antigen (LCA) was restricted to lymphocytes in CD patients. We further detected labeling signals for gliadin peptides, CD8, alpha/beta-TCR, and gamma/delta-TCR at the basal membrane of enterocytes that were interdigitated by extensions of lymphocytes. In situ hybridization experiments revealed that CD8 and gamma/delta-TCR were not expressed by CD enterocytes. We conclude that CD8, alpha/beta-TCR, and gamma/delta-TCR are targeted to Golgi complexes and vacuoles of small intestinal enterocytes in active CD. The observed process may be involved in the pathogenesis of CD enterocytes. We propose a mechanism for the uptake of CD8, alpha/beta-TCR, and gamma/delta-TCR by the basolateral membrane of small intestinal enterocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2004007812,"TSG101 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene whose deletion in NIH3T3 cells leads to spontaneous lung metastases in nude mice. Aberrant transcripts of TSG101 have been identified in 47% of primary breast carcinomas, without evidence of intragenic deletions at the TSG101 locus on 11p15. To investigate the possible role of TSG101 in lung cancer, which often shows 11p allele loss, we performed transcript analysis and mutational analysis of TSG101 in lung cancer cell lines. Reverse transcriptase RT–PCR and Northern analysis detected a common TSG101 transcript, shortened because of an internal deletion, which was expressed simultaneously with the wild-type transcript in 89% of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) lines. In contrast, the wild-type transcript was expressed alone in normal tissues, primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens, and the majority of NSCLC cell lines. Sequence of the shortened SCLC transcript was identical to that of the most common aberrant transcript identified in breast cancer, consisting of a deletion of exons 2–4 and part of 1 and 5. Southern analysis of SCLC lines expressing the shortened transcript did not detect any intragenic deletions. Single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct sequencing of TSG101 cDNAs also identified no mutations or deletions. These results suggest that TSG101 is not mutated in lung cancer but that aberrant splicing of TSG101 occurs in SCLC."

Little is known, however, about mechanisms that control expression of genes encoding the four enzymes that determine the catecholaminergic phenotype.V-1 is a novel soluble protein consisting of 117 amino acids that contains 2.5 tandem repeats of the cdc10/SWI6 motif, also known as the ankyrin repeat (see Fig. 1 A) (20Taoka M.

During embryonic stages, expression of the V-1 gene is detectable but weak. After birth, expression of V-1 mRNA gradually increases to reach a maximal level during the first to second postnatal weeks, declining thereafter to adult levels by postnatal day 28. 2S.-Y. Song, unpublished observations.2S.-Y. Song, unpublished observations. However, strong expression of the V-1 gene persists in regions of synaptic plasticity even after the second postnatal week (24Fujigasaki H. Song S.-Y. Kobayashi T. Yamakuni T. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have established stable transfectants that overexpress V-1 using the catecholamine-producing neuronal cell line PC12D to examine functional roles of V-1 in neuronal cells and analyzed the neuronal phenotypes of these cells using techniques of molecular biology, neurochemistry, biochemistry, and electrophysiology. In this study, we also demonstrate that the V-1 protein is intensely co-expressed with TH protein in catecholamine-producing tissues in situ and provide evidence that V-1 functions in the control of the catecholaminergic transmitter phenotype.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOur extensive immunohistochemical analyses indicated that the V-1 protein is expressed in a wide variety of different central neurons (24Fujigasaki H. Song S.-Y. Kobayashi T. Yamakuni T. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) as well as in rat ovary (25Song S.-Y. Asakai R. Kenmotsu N. Taoka M. Isobe T. Yamakuni T. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1423-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and other rat tissues including thymus, spleen, and kidney.2 Interestingly, strong expression of the V-1 protein coincided with TH expression in the cytoplasm of catecholaminergic cells, including adrenergic chromaffin cells of adrenal gland (Fig. 1 B) and noradrenergic neurons of the sympathetic ganglia and locus coeruleus.2 To examine the potential role of the V-1 protein in the regulation of the catecholaminergic phenotype, we generated stable transfectants that overexpress the V-1 protein using PC12D cells. Among stable transfectants harboring V-1-expression constructs, two clones V1–46 and V1–69 were chosen for phenotype analyses. V-1 protein levels of the V-1-overexpressing clones were 5–6-fold higher than that of the parent cell, which also endogenously expresses the V-1 protein. Increases in the V-1 protein result from an increase in V-1 mRNA level as demonstrated by Northern analysis (Fig. 2). On the other hand, there were no significant changes in the V-1 protein levels in control clones stably transfected with the vector alone (C-7 and C-9) compared with the parent cell (Fig. 2, A and B).Figure 2Analyses of the V-1 protein (Aand B) and its mRNA levels (C) in V-1-overexpressing clones (V1–46 and V1–69), two control clones (C-7 and C-9), and parental cells (D). A, proteins of cell lysates prepared from the transfectants or parent cells (45 μg/lane) were separated on 18% SDS-PAGE and assayed by Western blot analysis with anti-V-1 antibody (upper panel), followed by reprobing with anti-14-3-3 β protein antibody (as an internal control; lower panel).

Levitt M. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2910-2917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), AADC (37Lovenberg W. Weissbach H. Udenfriend S. J. Biol.

Acta. 1957; 24: 658-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which catalyze the four synthetic successive steps from tyrosine to dopa, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), mRNA expression of the first enzyme, TH, was increased in both V-1-overexpressing clones from 2.4- to 8.1-fold compared with those in the two control clones. Two sizes of mRNA species of the second enzyme AADC could be detected (Fig. 3,A and B). Levels of the larger AADC mRNA species were increased 20.2–68.2-fold in V-1-overexpressing clones compared with those of the control clones, where AADC mRNA expression appeared to be down-regulated in comparison with that of parent cell (Fig. 3, A and B). 3T. Yamakuni, unpublished observations. Three mRNA species of the third enzyme DBH were detected in all transfectants. The expression of two DBH mRNA species of higher molecular weight was differentially up-regulated 6.2–19.3-fold in the V-1-overexpressing clones compared with those in the control clones (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, no mRNA expression of the fourth enzyme PNMT was detectable in the parent cell by Northern analysis,3 consistent with previous data showing that there is no detectable level of PNMT enzymatic activity in PC12 cells (41Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). PNMT mRNA was also not detected in the V-1-overexpressing clones.3 These results suggest that the V-1 protein positively controls the coordinate expression of TH, AADC, and DBH mRNA in PC12D cells.Figure 3Up-regulation of TH, AADC, and DBH mRNAs (A and B), and TH protein levels (Cand D) in the V-1-overexpressing clones. Each photograph is representative of three and five independent Northern and Western analyses, respectively. The histograms (B and D) indicate results compiled from these experiments. Data represent the means ± S.E. A, two autoradiographic images for DBH mRNA were obtained at different exposure times. Total cellular RNAs (10 μg) of transfectants were subjected to Northern blotting. Staining gels with ethidium bromide (bottom panel) and reprobing blots with mouse Phox2 cDNA were performed to confirm equivalent loading. B, differences in TH, AADC, and DBH mRNA levels among the V-1-overexpressing clones and control clones are significant at p < 0.05.C, cell lysates (1.2 μg of protein) of these clones were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with anti-TH antibody and successively with anti-erk 2 (as an internal control) antibody. Differences in TH protein levels among the V-1-overexpressing clones and control clones are significant at p < 0.05 (paired ttest).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To obtain additional evidence at the enzymatic and functional levels, we assayed protein levels and enzymatic activities of TH and the catecholamine contents of cells. Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for TH showed that the levels of TH protein were 1.8–5.3 times higher in the V-1-overexpressing clones compared with control clones (Fig. 3, C and D). TH enzymatic activities in homogenates prepared from the V-1-overexpressing clones were also 1.8–3.8-fold higher than those prepared from control clones (Fig. 4 A), indicating that increases in TH enzymatic activities parallel the changes in the protein and mRNA levels of TH. Dopamine levels in V-1-overexpressing clones were 6–36-fold higher, and norepinephrine levels were 10–100-fold higher compared with those in the control cells (Fig. 4 B). The results of our biochemical and neurochemical experiments suggest that up-regulation of the expression of TH, AADC and DBH mRNAs observed in the V-1-overexpressing clones is indeed responsible for the increases in dopamine and norepinephrine production.Figure 4Effects of V-1 overexpression on TH enzymatic activity and catecholamine biosynthesis.

Konishi, unpublished observations. We therefore conclude that the remarkable increases in catecholamine production observed in both V1–46 and V1–69 clones are the result of a change in phenotype induced by V-1 overproduction.To our knowledge, the present study is the first to indicate the involvement of V-1 in the control of a neuronal function,i.e. regulation of catecholamine biosynthesis. The fact that the V-1 protein is expressed in various rat tissues as described above raises the possibility that V-1 may have additional functions. There are neither putative DNA binding domains nor other functional domains that seem to be involved in gene expression regulation within the V-1 protein (20Taoka M. Yamakuni T. Song S.-Y. Yamakawa Y. Seta K. Okuyama T. Isobe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Taoka M. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Yamakawa Y. Ozawa F. Hishinuma F. Kubota M. Minegishi A. Song S.-Y. Yamakuni T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9946-9951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The V-1 protein also could not be detected in nuclear extracts prepared from the V-1-overexpressing clones, as assayed by Western blot analysis,3 which suggests that the V-1 protein may function in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, overexpression of V-1 resulted in an increase in mRNA expression for three enzymes that determine the catecholaminergic phenotype. An unusual characteristic of the V-1 protein is that about 73% of the entire molecule is composed of 2.5 contiguous repeats of the cdc10/SWI6 motif (Fig. 1 A). It is now widely recognized that the cdc10/SWI6 motif serves as an interface for protein-protein interactions between cdc10/SWI6 motif-containing transcription regulators and transcription factors (22Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israel A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 23Inoue J.-I. Kerr L.D. Rashid D. Davis N. Bose Jr., H.R. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is quite possible that up-regulation of the expression of TH, AADC, and DBH mRNAs observed in the two independently isolated V-1-overexpressing clones results from the co-interactive action of V-1 with an as-yet-unidentified partner protein. Furthermore, our results of Northern blot analysis of DBH mRNA raise the possibility that V-1 might be involved in regulation of RNA processing after transcription of the DBH gene. Control of gene expression occurs by transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. The steady state level of mRNA is known to be regulated post-transcriptionally (3Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 42Vyas S. Biguet N.F. Mallet J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3707-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that stimulation of cytolasmic Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase enhances the stability of TH mRNA, and resultantly the steady state level of TH mRNA is increased (42Vyas S. Biguet N.F. Mallet J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3707-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that V-1 stabilizes TH, AADC, and DBH mRNAs. It seems likely that V-1 acts as a protein/protein adapter in the cytoplasm of cells and indirectly influences mechanisms that control the coordinate regulation of TH, AADC, and DBH genes through an intracellular signaling pathway to the nucleus. This model is supported by the observations that strong expression of V-1 occurs in the cytoplasm of norepinephrine-2 and epinephrine-producing cells (Fig. 1 B).Our present data suggest an important role for V-1 in catecholamine biosynthesis control, whereas the precise mechanism by which V-1 regulates gene expression of TH, AADC, and DBH remains to be revealed. The elucidation of an intracellular signaling pathway linked with the V-1-mediated phenotype regulation may offer new approaches to therapy for neurological and cardiovascular diseases.

Little is known, however, about mechanisms that control expression of genes encoding the four enzymes that determine the catecholaminergic phenotype. V-1 is a novel soluble protein consisting of 117 amino acids that contains 2.5 tandem repeats of the cdc10/SWI6 motif, also known as the ankyrin repeat (see Fig. 1 A) (20Taoka M. Yamakuni T.

This motif has been demonstrated to be crucial for protein-protein interactions (22Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israel A. Trends Biochem.

During embryonic stages, expression of the V-1 gene is detectable but weak. After birth, expression of V-1 mRNA gradually increases to reach a maximal level during the first to second postnatal weeks, declining thereafter to adult levels by postnatal day 28. 2S.-Y. Song, unpublished observations.2S.-Y. Song, unpublished observations. However, strong expression of the V-1 gene persists in regions of synaptic plasticity even after the second postnatal week (24Fujigasaki H. Song S.-Y. Kobayashi T. Yamakuni T. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have established stable transfectants that overexpress V-1 using the catecholamine-producing neuronal cell line PC12D to examine functional roles of V-1 in neuronal cells and analyzed the neuronal phenotypes of these cells using techniques of molecular biology, neurochemistry, biochemistry, and electrophysiology. In this study, we also demonstrate that the V-1 protein is intensely co-expressed with TH protein in catecholamine-producing tissues in situ and provide evidence that V-1 functions in the control of the catecholaminergic transmitter phenotype. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOur extensive immunohistochemical analyses indicated that the V-1 protein is expressed in a wide variety of different central neurons (24Fujigasaki H. Song S.-Y. Kobayashi T. Yamakuni T. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) as well as in rat ovary (25Song S.-Y. Asakai R. Kenmotsu N. Taoka M. Isobe T. Yamakuni T. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1423-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and other rat tissues including thymus, spleen, and kidney.2 Interestingly, strong expression of the V-1 protein coincided with TH expression in the cytoplasm of catecholaminergic cells, including adrenergic chromaffin cells of adrenal gland (Fig. 1 B) and noradrenergic neurons of the sympathetic ganglia and locus coeruleus.2 To examine the potential role of the V-1 protein in the regulation of the catecholaminergic phenotype, we generated stable transfectants that overexpress the V-1 protein using PC12D cells. Among stable transfectants harboring V-1-expression constructs, two clones V1–46 and V1–69 were chosen for phenotype analyses. V-1 protein levels of the V-1-overexpressing clones were 5–6-fold higher than that of the parent cell, which also endogenously expresses the V-1 protein. Increases in the V-1 protein result from an increase in V-1 mRNA level as demonstrated by Northern analysis (Fig. 2). On the other hand, there were no significant changes in the V-1 protein levels in control clones stably transfected with the vector alone (C-7 and C-9) compared with the parent cell (Fig. 2, A and B).We initially examined the functional role of V-1 in the regulation of expression of genes encoding TH (36Nagatsu T. Levitt M. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2910-2917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), AADC (37Lovenberg W. Weissbach H. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 89-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), DBH (38Friedman S. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4763-4773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PNMT (39Axelrod J. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1657-1660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Kirshner N. Goodall M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 658-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which catalyze the four synthetic successive steps from tyrosine to dopa, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), mRNA expression of the first enzyme, TH, was increased in both V-1-overexpressing clones from 2.4- to 8.1-fold compared with those in the two control clones. Two sizes of mRNA species of the second enzyme AADC could be detected (Fig. 3,A and B). Levels of the larger AADC mRNA species were increased 20.2–68.2-fold in V-1-overexpressing clones compared with those of the control clones, where AADC mRNA expression appeared to be down-regulated in comparison with that of parent cell (Fig. 3, A and B). 3T. Yamakuni, unpublished observations. Three mRNA species of the third enzyme DBH were detected in all transfectants. The expression of two DBH mRNA species of higher molecular weight was differentially up-regulated 6.2–19.3-fold in the V-1-overexpressing clones compared with those in the control clones (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, no mRNA expression of the fourth enzyme PNMT was detectable in the parent cell by Northern analysis,3 consistent with previous data showing that there is no detectable level of PNMT enzymatic activity in PC12 cells (41Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). PNMT mRNA was also not detected in the V-1-overexpressing clones.3 These results suggest that the V-1 protein positively controls the coordinate expression of TH, AADC, and DBH mRNA in PC12D cells.Figure 3Up-regulation of TH, AADC, and DBH mRNAs (A and B), and TH protein levels (Cand D) in the V-1-overexpressing clones. Each photograph is representative of three and five independent Northern and Western analyses, respectively. The histograms (B and D) indicate results compiled from these experiments. Data represent the means ± S.E. A, two autoradiographic images for DBH mRNA were obtained at different exposure times. Total cellular RNAs (10 μg) of transfectants were subjected to Northern blotting. Staining gels with ethidium bromide (bottom panel) and reprobing blots with mouse Phox2 cDNA were performed to confirm equivalent loading. B, differences in TH, AADC, and DBH mRNA levels among the V-1-overexpressing clones and control clones are significant at p < 0.05.C, cell lysates (1.2 μg of protein) of these clones were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with anti-TH antibody and successively with anti-erk 2 (as an internal control) antibody. Differences in TH protein levels among the V-1-overexpressing clones and control clones are significant at p < 0.05 (paired ttest).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To obtain additional evidence at the enzymatic and functional levels, we assayed protein levels and enzymatic activities of TH and the catecholamine contents of cells. Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for TH showed that the levels of TH protein were 1.8–5.3 times higher in the V-1-overexpressing clones compared with control clones (Fig. 3, C and D). TH enzymatic activities in homogenates prepared from the V-1-overexpressing clones were also 1.8–3.8-fold higher than those prepared from control clones (Fig. 4 A), indicating that increases in TH enzymatic activities parallel the changes in the protein and mRNA levels of TH. Dopamine levels in V-1-overexpressing clones were 6–36-fold higher, and norepinephrine levels were 10–100-fold higher compared with those in the control cells (Fig. 4 B). The results of our biochemical and neurochemical experiments suggest that up-regulation of the expression of TH, AADC and DBH mRNAs observed in the V-1-overexpressing clones is indeed responsible for the increases in dopamine and norepinephrine production.Figure 4Effects of V-1 overexpression on TH enzymatic activity and catecholamine biosynthesis.

Konishi, unpublished observations. We therefore conclude that the remarkable increases in catecholamine production observed in both V1–46 and V1–69 clones are the result of a change in phenotype induced by V-1 overproduction.To our knowledge, the present study is the first to indicate the involvement of V-1 in the control of a neuronal function,i.e. regulation of catecholamine biosynthesis. The fact that the V-1 protein is expressed in various rat tissues as described above raises the possibility that V-1 may have additional functions. There are neither putative DNA binding domains nor other functional domains that seem to be involved in gene expression regulation within the V-1 protein (20Taoka M. Yamakuni T. Song S.-Y. Yamakawa Y. Seta K. Okuyama T. Isobe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Taoka M. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Yamakawa Y. Ozawa F.

The V-1 protein also could not be detected in nuclear extracts prepared from the V-1-overexpressing clones, as assayed by Western blot analysis,3 which suggests that the V-1 protein may function in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, overexpression of V-1 resulted in an increase in mRNA expression for three enzymes that determine the catecholaminergic phenotype. An unusual characteristic of the V-1 protein is that about 73% of the entire molecule is composed of 2.5 contiguous repeats of the cdc10/SWI6 motif (Fig. 1 A). It is now widely recognized that the cdc10/SWI6 motif serves as an interface for protein-protein interactions between cdc10/SWI6 motif-containing transcription regulators and transcription factors (22Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israel A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 23Inoue J.-I. Kerr L.D. Rashid D. Davis N. Bose Jr., H.R. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is quite possible that up-regulation of the expression of TH, AADC, and DBH mRNAs observed in the two independently isolated V-1-overexpressing clones results from the co-interactive action of V-1 with an as-yet-unidentified partner protein. Furthermore, our results of Northern blot analysis of DBH mRNA raise the possibility that V-1 might be involved in regulation of RNA processing after transcription of the DBH gene. Control of gene expression occurs by transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. The steady state level of mRNA is known to be regulated post-transcriptionally (3Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 42Vyas S. Biguet N.F. Mallet J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3707-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that stimulation of cytolasmic Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase enhances the stability of TH mRNA, and resultantly the steady state level of TH mRNA is increased (42Vyas S. Biguet N.F. Mallet J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3707-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that V-1 stabilizes TH, AADC, and DBH mRNAs. It seems likely that V-1 acts as a protein/protein adapter in the cytoplasm of cells and indirectly influences mechanisms that control the coordinate regulation of TH, AADC, and DBH genes through an intracellular signaling pathway to the nucleus. This model is supported by the observations that strong expression of V-1 occurs in the cytoplasm of norepinephrine-2 and epinephrine-producing cells (Fig. 1 B).Our present data suggest an important role for V-1 in catecholamine biosynthesis control, whereas the precise mechanism by which V-1 regulates gene expression of TH, AADC, and DBH remains to be revealed. The elucidation of an intracellular signaling pathway linked with the V-1-mediated phenotype regulation may offer new approaches to therapy for neurological and cardiovascular diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2047742783,"The major components of transcription factor AP-1 (Activator Protein 1) are encoded by the two families of genes related to the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun. The fos-related antigen-2 (fra-2) gene is the most recently described member of the Fos family. To determine the oncogenic potential of fra-2, transgenic mice were generated which over-express fra-2 in a number of tissues. No tumours were evident in any transgenic mice up to 18 months of age, although eye development was severely disrupted in these animals. Corneal abnormalities could be observed histologically as early as embryonic day 15.5 and eyelid fusion failed to occur. Adult eyes were characterized by generalized anterior segment dysgenesis similar to that previously reported in transgenic mice over-expressing transforming growth factor α (TGFα), and occasionally microphthalmia. Expression of fra-2 was shown to increase following TGFα treatment of cells in vitro, suggesting that AP-1 complexes containing Fra-2 contribute to TGFα signalling events."
https://openalex.org/W2032219019,"The proto-oncogene Fli-1, a member of Ets family is rearranged or activated through proviral integration in erythroleukemias, induced by Friends' Murine Leukemia Virus. The DNA binding domain (ETS domain) of Fli-1 is fused to the RNA binding domain of EWS by t(11q24:22q12) chromosomal translocation in Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors. Screening of human cDNA libraries has identified two different 5'-termini and alternatively spliced forms of the human Fli-1 gene (Fli-1b), suggesting the possible existence of two independent promoters. The genomic sequence adjacent to the alternate exon of human Fli-1b gene shows functional promoter activity when cloned in promoter-less CAT expression vector and transfected into QT-6 cells. The transcription initiation (CAP) site and minimum promoter region necessary for function were localized. The 5'-flanking regions of human Fli-1b and mouse Fli-1 show 80% homology suggesting conserved promoter regulatory elements. The Fli-1b 5'-flanking sequence lacks canonical TATA or CCAAT boxes but contains a partially conserved TATA-like sequence at position 242. Several transcription factor binding sequences like ATF/CREB, E2A-PBX1, EBP, PEA-3, ETS-2, Sp-1, c-Myc, TBP, GATA-1 and Oct-3 were conserved in the promoter sequence. Functional promoter assays revealed that Fli-1b promoter shows very strong transcriptional activation compared to Fli-1 promoter. We also showed that variant Fli-1b has transcriptional activation properties similar to those of Fli-1. Fli-1b and Fli-1 show differential expression in various hematopoietic cell lines. This differential expression and promoter activities of Fli-1 and Fli-1b suggests that several mechanisms are involved in Fli-1 gene regulation which are mediated by many transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2033527884,"The tyrosine kinase receptor Met and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/scatter factor are involved in the etiology and progression of a number of human cancers. Coexpression of Met and HGF in mesenchymal cells increases the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of the cells. In the studies described here, we used differential display screening to identify changes in gene expression that are initiated by Met/HGF, and that may lead to these phenotypes. We learned that Met/HGF signaling resulted in greatly decreased fibronectin mRNA production in three different human and mouse tumor cell lines; these decreases in fibronectin mRNA were paralleled by decreases in fibronectin protein. We also found a progressive decrease in fibronectin in tumor explants and metastases derived from the Met/HGF transformed cells. The absence of fibronectin expression is a frequent cancer phenotype; our results indicate that decreases in fibronectin correlate with, but are not essential for, MetHGF/SF-mediated tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2315833439,"Erythroleukemia induced by the anemia strain of Friend virus occurs in two stages. The first stage results in rapid expansion of pre-leukemic proerythroblasts (FVA cells) dependent on erythropoietin (Epo) for differentiation and survival in vitro. The second stage is characterized by emergence of erythroleukemic clones (MEL cells) which typically bear activation of the ets-oncogene, PU.1/spi.1, and loss of functional p53. We developed a Friend virus-sensitive, p53-deficient mouse model to investigate the biological advantage conferred by p53-loss during tumor progression. Here we report p53 was not required for cell survival or growth arrest during differentiation of FVA cells, nor was p53 required for induction of apoptosis upon Epo withdrawal. However, we detected induction of the p21Cip1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene during differentiation, which was markedly enhanced in the presence of p53. p53-dependent expression of p21Cip1 occurred in the absence of an increase in p53 mRNA and protein levels and was specific for p21Cip1, since expression of gadd45, mdm-2, cyclin G and bax were unaffected by p53. In contrast, treatment of FVA cells with DNA damaging agents led to rapid accumulation of p53 protein resulting in transcription of multiple p53-regulated genes, leading to either apoptosis or growth arrest, depending on the agent used. These data demonstrate that p53-dependent activities during differentiation of preleukemic erythroblasts are distinct from those observed in response to genotoxic agents. We propose that enhancement of p53-dependent gene expression during differentiation may represent a tumor suppressor function which is necessary to monitor differentiation of preleukemic cells and which is selected against during tumor progression."

If the 5′UTR of AC914 mRNA is substituted for the 5′UTR of Actin 15 mRNA, the latter accumulates only in aggregated cells. Pactamycin, but not other inhibitors of protein synthesis, prevents AC914 mRNA from being destabilized in disaggregated cells, suggesting a role of 40 S subunits in the destabilization. This has been confirmed by using an in vitro system in which the in vivo stability of different mRNAs is reproduced. A protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 determines whether 40 S subunits are capable or not of destabilizing AC914 mRNA in the in vitro system. AC914 mRNA, a pre-spore-specific mRNA that accumulates only in the post-aggregation stage of development, is transcribed constitutively as shown by nuclear run-off experiments and by fusing its promoter to the luciferase reporter gene. The same mRNA disappears quickly from disaggregated cells.

About 5000 genes are expressed both during growth and development of Dictyostelium discoideum (the so-called constitutive genes). A few hundred genes are expressed only in the pre-aggregation stage of development (early genes), and about 3000 genes are expressed only after the formation of tight cell aggregates (late genes) (1Blumberg D.D. Lodish H.F. Dev. Biol. 1980; 78: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 2Mangiarotti G. Chung D. Zuker C. Lodish H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The last group can be subdivided into genes expressed preferentially or exclusively in pre-spore or in pre-stalk cells and genes expressed in both cell types (pre-spore-specific, pre-stalk-specific, and common genes, respectively) (3Barklis E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1983; 32: 1139-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In vivo 32P-labeling experiments have indicated that the expression of a large fraction of pre-spore genes is controlled mainly at the level of mRNA stability (4Mangiarotti G. Giorda R. Perlo C. Ceccarelli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Transcription of these mRNAs occurs in vegetative cells or is induced by cell starvation at the very beginning of development and continues at a relatively constant rate throughout development. However, these mRNAs fail to accumulate in the pre-aggregation stage because they are highly unstable. They become stable and start to accumulate when formation of tipped aggregates begins, their stabilization being probably dependent on this process (5Bozzaro S. Perlo C. Ceccarelli A. Mangiarotti G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 193-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If aggregates are dispersed, the same mRNAs are destabilized and disappear quickly from the dissociated cells (6Chung S. Landfear S. Blumberg D.D. Cohen N. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1981; 24: 785-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Mangiarotti G. Lefebvre P. Lodish H.F. Dev. Biol. 1982; 9: 82-91Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The addition of cAMP to the disaggregated cells prevents mRNA destabilization (8Mangiarotti G. Ceccarelli A. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1983; 301: 616-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Mangiarotti G. Bulfone S. Giorda R. Morandini P. Ceccarelli A. Hames B.D. Development. 1989; 106: 473-481PubMed Google Scholar). Since the mRNA molecules that are in the cytoplasm in aggregated cells as stable molecules are the same molecules that are destabilized upon cell disaggregation and restabilized if cells are allowed to reaggregate (9Mangiarotti G. Bulfone S. Giorda R. Morandini P. Ceccarelli A. Hames B.D. Development. 1989; 106: 473-481PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that they contain an element (a specific sequence or a sequence with a defined secondary structure) that targets them as mRNA species whose stability has to be regulated. On the other hand the control must be mediated by one or more cytoplasmic factors, which in turn must be responsive to cell-cell contacts and/or to the extracellular concentration of cAMP. In order to consolidate our previous findings and to try to unravel the mechanism of mRNA stabilization/destabilization, we have studied in detail some of the parameters of this process for the AC914 mRNA, which has been chosen as representative of the class of pre-spore-specific mRNAs. The findings reported here indicate that a critical step involved in the control of mRNA stability is the interaction between the 5′UTR of the mRNA and the 40 S ribosomal subunit. The outcome of this interaction is dependent on the state of phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. D. discoideum strain AX2 was grown, allowed to develop, and disaggregated as previously described (9Mangiarotti G. Bulfone S. Giorda R. Morandini P. Ceccarelli A. Hames B.D. Development. 1989; 106: 473-481PubMed Google Scholar). Where specified, cells disaggregated at the stage of first finger were shaken in suspension in the presence of 200 μg/ml pactamycin (The Upjohn Co.), 1 mg/ml puromycin (Sigma), or 200 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). Total RNA was extracted by using Ultraspec II-RNA, following the instructions given by the manufacturer (Biotex Laboratories). 6 μg of total RNA per lane were run onto a 1.2% agarose gel in denaturing conditions as described previously (9Mangiarotti G. Bulfone S. Giorda R. Morandini P. Ceccarelli A. Hames B.D. Development. 1989; 106: 473-481PubMed Google Scholar), until the migrating dye reached the front of the gel. At the end of the run the amount and integrity of rRNA in each lane were evaluated by ethidium bromide staining. After blotting for 18 h in 10× SSC onto Hybond-N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), RNA was covalently linked to the membrane by 3 min exposure to UV light as described in Ref. 10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.

Radioactive membranes were washed four times for 15 min in 250 ml of 2× SSC, 1% SDS at 65 °C and exposed for autoradiography or analyzed with the Bio-Rad PhosphorImager. c-myc oligonucleotide was end-labeled with 32P incubating at 37 °C for 1 h with 200 ng of DNA, 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 50 μCi of [32P]ATP at 3000 Ci/mmol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT in 25-μl volume. The labeled oligonucleotide was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by two ethanol precipitations. RNA blots were hybridized with oligonucleotide probes for 18 h in 5× SSC, 2% SDS, 2% BSA, 2% Ficoll, 2% PVP at 37 °C and washed at the same temperature in 2× SSC, 1% SDS.

Ceccarelli from a partial Sau3A1 D. discoideumgenomic library inserted into BamHI-cut pAT153. The clone contains 1.1 kbp of sequence upstream of the Cap site of theAC914 gene 2G. Mangiarotti, unpublished work. and the coding sequence flanked by 1.4 kbp of sequences downstream of the stop codon. In order to test the AC914 promoter activity during growth and development, a 1.0-kbp SspI fragment from the AC914 promoter region was cloned into the filled in BamHI site of the vector A15 Bluc (11Lloyd M. Ceccarelli A. Williams J.G. Dev. Genet. 1988; 11: 391-395Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) in which the A15 promoter sequences had been deleted in order to inactivate it. The resulting AC914 luciferase construct directs expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene under the control of the AC914 promoter fused to the A15 Cap site and 5′UTR.

Biol. 1982; 9: 82-91Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Vegetative and developing Dictyosteliumcells (at 3 h and at first finger stages) were lysed by vortexing at 0 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgOAc, 10% sucrose, 2% Nonidet P-40 at 108 cells/ml. Nuclei were isolated by centrifugation for 10 min at 6000 rpm in a JA 14.1 Kontron rotor and washed twice in the same buffer. Nuclei resuspended at 108/ml in storage buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol) were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C in 200-μl aliquots. Run-off transcription was performed by adding 200 μl of 2× transcription buffer (80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, GTP, 5 μm cold UTP, and 100 μCi of [32P]UTP at 3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml). Samples were incubated at 23 °C for 30 min, extracted twice with phenol/chloroform, 1:1, and ethanol-precipitated twice. Each reaction product was hybridized at 37 °C for 24 h in nuclear run-off hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 2% SDS, 2% BSA, 2% Ficoll, 2% PVP) to 3 μg of DNA denatured and spotted as in Ref. 9Mangiarotti G. Bulfone S. Giorda R. Morandini P. Ceccarelli A. Hames B.D. Development. 1989; 106: 473-481PubMed Google Scholar onto Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After hybridization, the membranes were washed 4 times for 15 min in 250 ml of 2× SSC, 1% SDS at 55 °C. The quantitative analysis of nuclear run-off assays was performed using the Bio-Rad PhosphorImager system and Phosphoroanalyst software. Cells at the first finger stage of development were lysed by vortexing them for 15 s at 2 °C in cold buffer containing 2% Tergitol, 10% sucrose, 20 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The lysate was centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge at maximum speed for 6 min to obtain the post-lysosomal supernatant. This was centrifuged in a SW40 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 90 min through a 15–35% sucrose gradient containing the same salts as the lysis buffer. The top half of the gradient was discarded, and the bottom half was used directly as a source of polyribosomes. To measure the stability of the endogenous mRNAs, 5 A 260/ml polyribosomes, containing 0.1 A 260 of total poly(A)+ mRNA, but unknown amounts of each specific mRNA, were incubated at 22 °C in the presence of 1 μg of soluble proteins (16Mangiarotti G. Chiaberge S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19682-19687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), 2 mg/ml ATP, 2 mg/ml GTP, and 1 mg/mlDictyostelium tRNA. Polyribosomes were translationally active as shown by the addition of 250 μm each of 19 amino acids and 0.2 mCi [35S]methionine per ml of final reaction volume, which led to the incorporation of 35S label into hot trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. However the addition of the 20 amino acids decreased the stability of the tested mRNAs by at least a factor 2 (data not shown), and therefore the amino acids were omitted. At the end of the incubation, total RNA was extracted from polyribosomes by using UltraspecII-RNA and submitted to Northern analysis as described above. Cells were lysed in the same buffer described above but containing a higher concentration of KCl (0.5 m). The same buffer (without Tergitol) was used for the centrifugation on sucrose gradients. The procedure described in Ref. 16Mangiarotti G. Chiaberge S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19682-19687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar was followed. The procedure described in Ref. 17Juliani M.H. da Costa Maia J.C. Bonato M.C.M. FEBS Lett. 1983; 154: 400-406Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar was followed. Phosphorylated protein S6 was eluted from a gel similar to the one shown in Fig. 4 B, following the procedure described (17Juliani M.H. da Costa Maia J.C. Bonato M.C.M. FEBS Lett. 1983; 154: 400-406Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). By rerunning a sample of the eluted protein by two-dimensional electrophoresis, we could infer that we had succeeded in solubilizing about 50% of the S6 protein contained in the original gel. The solubilized S6 protein was dialyzed against 6m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and added to a 40 S subunit reconstitution mixture (16Mangiarotti G. Chiaberge S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19682-19687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) containing an amount of ribosomal RNA and unlabeled proteins (derived from vegetative cells) equal to 1/20 of the amount used to display phosphorylated protein S6 on the original gel. At the end of the incubation, the reconstituted 40 S subunits were purified by centrifugation on a sucrose gradient and their protein analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The intensity of the autoradiographic spots corresponding to protein S6 was compatible with the incorporation of a molecule of phosphorylated S6 per 40 S subunit. AC914 mRNA accumulates only late in development starting at the stage of tipped aggregates or first finger (Table I, line 1). Nuclear run-off experiments indicate that AC914 transcription is already in process in vegetative cells and declines during development (Fig. 1, solid circles). This is in agreement with the finding that luciferase mRNA transcribed from the AC914 promoter is present both in vegetative and developing cells (Table I, line 2). To confirm that the kinetics of accumulation of AC914 mRNA depends on the modulation of its stability, we have fused the AC914 gene to the Actin 15 (A15) promoter, generating line 3 listed in Table I. To be able to distinguish the mRNA transcribed from the heterologous promoter and the mRNA transcribed from the endogenous gene, we have inserted in the coding region of construct 3 a 33-mer oligonucleotide derived from c-myc (13Jermyn K.A. Duffy K.T. Williams J.G. Nature. 1989; 340: 144-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). By using this oligonucleotide as a 32P-labeled probe, we were able to detect the AC914 mRNA transcribed from the A15 promoter by Northern analysis. The kinetics of accumulation of this mRNA (Table I, line 3) is similar to that of the mRNA transcribed from the endogenous gene (Table I, line 1). Since the run-off transcription activity of the A15 promoter (Fig. 1, solid circles) parallels the one of the AC914 promoter, this result reinforces the notion that the accumulation of AC914 mRNA is controlled during development at the level of mRNA stability. The coding region and the 3′UTR of AC914 gene were fused to the A15 promoter joined to the A15 5′UTR and to the nine nucleotides coding for the first three A15 amino acids (construct 4, Table I, line 4). Also in these cases a 33-mer oligonucleotide from c-myc was inserted in frame in the coding region of the gene, to allow detection only of the mRNA transcribed from the A15 promoter. The mRNAs transcribed from A15 promoter was already present in vegetative cells and did not accumulate further during development (Table I, line 4). The endogenous AC914 mRNA in the same cells (distinguishable by Northern analysis because of its smaller size) maintained its regulation and was detectable only after 9 h of development (data not shown). The decay of the endogenous AC914 mRNA and of that transcribed from construct in Table I, line 4 in disaggregated cells was monitored by Northern blot analysis. As expected the first one decayed rapidly (Table I, line 1), and the latter one remained stable (Table I, line 4). These results indicate that the 5′UTR of AC914 mRNA is necessary for the mRNA to be destabilized during growth and early development and in disaggregated cells. To determine whether the 5′UTR of AC914 mRNA was capable of destabilizing an mRNA intrinsically stable, we substituted the 5′UTR of A15 mRNA, which is stable when transcribed both from its own promoter and from the AC914 promoter (Table I, lines 5 and 6) with the 5′UTR of the AC914 mRNA. The hybrid mRNA began to accumulate at the stage of tipped aggregates and was destabilized in disaggregated cells (Table I, line 7). We conclude that the 5′UTR of AC914 is not only necessary but also sufficient to destabilize a stable mRNA in non-aggregated cells. The fact that the AC914 mRNA containing A15 5′UTR cannot be destabilized whereas A15 mRNA containing AC914 5′UTR has a regulated stability may be interpreted in different ways. One possibility is that the interaction between the 5′UTR of the mRNA and the small ribosomal subunit plays a crucial role in the destabilization mechanism. To test whether the 40 S subunit-5′UTR interaction is involved in the control of mRNA stability, cells were disaggregated in the presence of pactamycin, a drug that blocks the movement of 40 S ribosomal subunits from the mRNA Cap site to the first AUG codon. The addition of 200 μg/ml pactamycin (a concentration sufficient to inhibit completely the incorporation of [35S]methionine into polypeptides (data not shown)) prevented completely the decay of the endogenous AC914 mRNA (Table I, line 8). Destabilization of AC914 mRNA occurred normally in the presence of 1 mg/ml puromycin or of 200 μg/ml cycloheximide, concentrations sufficient to block 98% of incorporation of [35S]methionine in disaggregated cells (data not shown). Hence the effect of pactamycin cannot be due to the inhibition of protein synthesis per se but must be related to direct interaction between the 40 S subunit and the 5′UTR of AC914 mRNA. To test the putative role of 40 S subunits in the control of mRNA stability, we searched for an in vitro system in which the differential stability of AC914 during development could be reproduced. Fig. 2, A and B, shows the in vivo stability of the two test mRNAs, AC914 and SC253. Both mRNAs are stable at the first finger stage. Upon disaggregation, the pre-stalk-specific SC253 mRNA remains stable, whereas the pre-spore-specific AC914 mRNA is destabilized and disappears rapidly. To measure the in vitro stability of the two test mRNAs, polyribosomes were isolated from cells at the first finger stage and incubated in vitro as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Neither of the two test mRNAs was degraded significantly for at least 120 min (Fig. 2 C). In polyribosomes isolated from disaggregated cells and incubated in vitro, AC914 mRNA disappeared with a half-life of about 15 min (Fig. 2 D). SC253 mRNA remained stable as in polyribosomes derived from aggregated cells. When disaggregated cells were replated and allowed to reaggregate (9Mangiarotti G. Bulfone S. Giorda R. Morandini P. Ceccarelli A. Hames B.D. Development. 1989; 106: 473-481PubMed Google Scholar) before polyribosome isolation, both test mRNAs were stable upon subsequent incubation in vitro (Fig. 2 E). Thus the stability of these two mRNAs in vitro reproduces exactly that observed in vivo. We have exchanged components between in vitro systems consisting of polyribosomes isolated from aggregated and from disaggregated cells to determine which was involved in controlling mRNA stability. The addition of 40 S ribosomal subunits from polyribosomes isolated from disaggregated cells destabilized AC914 mRNA contained in polyribosomes isolated from aggregated cells, while having no effect on SC253 mRNA stability (Table II, line 4). The exchange of any other component (soluble proteins, 60 S subunits, tRNA, and mRNAs) had no effect on AC914 mRNA stability (data not shown). The addition of 40 S ribosomal subunits derived from vegetative AX2 cells or from cells in the pre-aggregation stage to polyribosomes derived from aggregated cells also destabilized selectively AC914 mRNA (Table II, lines 1 and 2).Table IIEffect of the addition of 40 S ribosomal subunits on the in vitro stability of AC914 and SC253 mRNAs contained in polyribosomes from aggregated cellsSource of 40 S subunitsHalf-lifeAC914SC253minVegetative AX2 cells15180Pre-aggregative AX2 cells15180Aggregated AX2 cells180180Disaggregated AX2 cells15180K cells just disaggregated15180K cells disaggregated for 15 min180180 Open table in a new tab We have recently described the in vitroreconstitution of ribosomal subunits from free Dictyosteliumribosomal RNA and proteins (16Mangiarotti G.

Hybrid 40 S subunits containing pre-17 S rRNA from vegetative cells and ribosomal proteins derived from vegetative, pre-aggregated, aggregated, and disaggregated cells were constructed and tested for their ability to destabilize AC914 mRNA contained in polyribosomes derived from aggregated cells. All types of particles were active in this respect, except those containing proteins from aggregated cells (Table III).Table IIIEffect of hybrid 40 S ribosomal subunits on the in vitro stability of AC914 mRNA contained in polyribosomes from aggregated cellsSource of ribosomal proteinsHalf-life of mRNAminVegetative cells15Pre-aggregative cells15Aggregated cells180Disaggregated cells15 Open table in a new tab Since cAMP prevents mRNA destabilization induced by cell disaggregation (8Mangiarotti G.

Development. 1989; 106: 473-481PubMed Google Scholar), it was reasonable to suppose that cAMP-dependent protein kinase A might be involved in the stability of control mechanisms. The availability of transformedDictyostelium cells which overexpress the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (K cells) (18Anjard C. Pinaud S. Kay R.R. Reymond C.D. Development. 1992; 115: 785-790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hopper N.A. Anjard C. Reymond C.D. Williams J.G. Development. 1993; 119: 147-154PubMed Google Scholar) allowed this hypothesis to be tested. When K cells were disaggregated, AC914 mRNA was destabilized and decayed in vivo by about a factor of 1.5 in the first 15 min but then became stable again and no longer decayed (Fig. 3). Overexpression of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A therefore is not sufficient to prevent mRNA destabilization initially, but it rapidly overcomes the destabilization and reimposes mRNA stability. 40 S subunits derived from K cells lysed immediately after cell disaggregation destabilized AC914 mRNA in our in vitrosystem when added to polyribosomes derived from aggregated cells. However 40 S subunits derived from K cells lysed 15 min after disaggregation did not destabilize this mRNA (Table II, lines 5 and 6). Thus the overexpression of protein kinase A appears to cause a functional alteration of 40 S subunits with regard to mRNA destabilization. It has been reported (17Juliani M.H. da Costa Maia J.C. Bonato M.C.M. FEBS Lett. 1983; 154: 400-406Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) that the only modification of ribosomal proteins which consistently occurs during development of Dictyostelium is the phosphorylation of protein S6, which occurs on three residues of serine during cell aggregation. To determine the relevance of S6 phosphorylation on mRNA stability, the proteins of 40 S ribosomal subunits labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in vivo were extracted and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described (17Juliani M.H. da Costa Maia J.C.

From Fig. 4 A, it is apparent that no 40 S protein is phosphorylated in the pre-aggregation stage of development, whereas three phosphorylated derivatives of protein S6 are visible in the post-aggregation stage (Fig. 4 B). They disappear if cells are disaggregated in the absence of cAMP (Fig. 4 C) but remain if cells are disaggregated in the presence of 1 mm cAMP (Fig. 4 D). The three phosphorylated derivatives reappear if cells are allowed to reaggregate (Fig. 4 E). Finally in a mutant in which development is blocked before the formation of tight aggregates (Agg−), protein S6 is not phosphorylated even at late times of development (Fig. 4 F). The trypsin fingerprint analysis of protein S6 was altered in the mutant, indicating that the mutation had occurred in protein S6 gene. Phosphorylation of protein S6 may therefore play a crucial role in the progress of Dictyostelium development. Table IV shows the correlation between the stability of seven pre-spore mRNAs and the state of phosphorylation of protein S6 in different cell physiological conditions. All the seven mRNAs are unstable when protein S6 is not phosphorylated, whereas they are stable when the protein is phosphorylated. In the Agg− mutant all the seven tested mRNAs were synthesized already at the time of starvation, as judged by the32P pulse-labeling technique described previously (4Mangiarotti G. Giorda R. Perlo C. Ceccarelli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and continue to be synthesized at a comparable rate for the 24 h required for the wild type to complete development (data not shown). However, they never accumulate at a level to be detectable by Northern blot. By the rate of decay of incorporated 32P, they appear to remain highly unstable at any time after starvation (Table IV). Phosphorylation of protein S6 appears to be directly or indirectly required for the stabilization of these mRNAs.Table IVHalf-lifes of mRNAs in the presence of phosphorylated or dephosphorylated 40 S ribosomal subunitsIn vivo 4-aThe half-lives of mRNAs were determined in the indicated conditions as described (4, 7).

In the presence of 40 S subunits reconstituted from pre-17 S RNA and ribosomal protein from growing cells, all the tested mRNA were unstable. However, all of them were stable if in the reconstitution mixture for the 40 S subunits tested in the in vitro system a 10-fold excess of the phosphorylated form of protein S6 was added, so that the reconstituted particles contained all components derived from growing cells, except protein S6 derived from aggregated cells. Phosphorylation of protein S6 is clearly the only modification that modulates the ability of 40 S subunits to destabilize pre-spore-specific mRNAs. We have shown that AC914 mRNA undergoes two major changes in its stability, one during the formation of tight cell aggregates and the other when cells are disaggregated. The nuclear run-off data for the endogenous gene show that it is already active during vegetative growth. The accumulation of a reporter gene coupled to the AC914 promoter shows clearly that the control elements present in this fragment of DNA can direct transcription in a similar way to the endogenous promoter. These results consolidate our previous findings based on 32P-labeling kinetics (4Mangiarotti G. Giorda R. Perlo C. Ceccarelli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 7Mangiarotti G. Lefebvre P. Lodish H.F. Dev. Biol. 1982; 9: 82-91Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 9Mangiarotti G. Bulfone S.

Development. 1989; 106: 473-481PubMed Google Scholar) showing that the expression of a group of pre-spore genes is regulated at the level of mRNA stability. Both transitions in stability require that the 5′UTR of AC914 mRNA is present and is not substituted by the 5′UTR of a constitutively stable mRNA. On the other hand the 5′UTR of AC914 fused in front of a stable mRNA is sufficient to destabilize this mRNA in non-aggregated cells. The 5′UTR of AC914 therefore contains all the elements in cis required to modulate the stability of an mRNA as a function of cell aggregation. This is the first example in the literature of destabilizing elements located in the 5′UTR of an mRNA, rather than in the 3′ or more rarely in the coding region (20Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). More work will be required to define these elements. The 5′UTR of an mRNA interacts only with the small ribosomal subunit and with some initiation factors. Our results with AC914 mRNA thus suggest that 40 S ribosomal subunits can interact with the 5′UTR of AC914 to form a specific complex with the destabilizing elements, but this interaction is not possible if the 5′UTR of AC914 is replaced by A15 5′UTR. In line with this interpretation, AC914 mRNA destabilization is inhibited by pactamycin, which prevents the movement of 40 S ribosomal subunits from the Cap toward the first AUG codon, but not by other inhibitors of protein synthesis. The role of 40 S ribosomal subunits in AC914 mRNA destabilization is clearly shown by the in vitro experiments reported in this paper. Several in vitro systems to study mRNA stability have been described (21Ross J. Kobs G. Brewer G. Peltz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9374-9380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 23Vreken P. Buddelmejer N. Raue H.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and have given useful information concerning the mechanism of stability control of specific mRNAs. Our finding that a given molecule of mRNA may be stable or unstable in vitro following the exchange of 40 S subunits between polyribosomes isolated from aggregated and disaggregated cells strongly implicates 40 S subunits as at least one of the trans-acting factors in this mechanism. The fact that 40 S subunits derived from cells in growth or in the pre-aggregation stage of development also destabilize AC914 mRNA suggests that the shift in stability occurring at the time of tight aggregation may be due to a mechanism opposite to that involved in mRNA destabilization following cell disaggregation. The component of 40 S subunits involved in the stability control is protein. This suggests the possibility that the mRNA stabilization/destabilization mechanism is based on phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of one or several ribosomal proteins, as implied by the involvement in the process of protein kinase A indicated by our results with K cells. This suggestion has been confirmed by the finding that the state of phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 is responsible for the activity of 40 S subunits in destabilizing pre-spore-specific mRNAs. This is clearly indicated by the inability of pre-spore-specific mRNAs to become stable if the S6 phosphorylation is prevented by a mutation in the same protein and proven by the fact that in vitro reconstituted 40 S subunits which differ only in the absence or the presence of phosphate groups on protein S6 can or cannot destabilize prespore-specific mRNAs. However, we do not know whether S6 phosphorylation is directly carried out by protein kinase A or is mediated by some other protein kinase. As we have mentioned before, if disaggregated cells are allowed to reaggregate, the same molecules of mRNA which had become unstable recover stability. To explain the reversibility of the destabilization process, one has to admit that the interaction between the destabilizing elements in the 5′UTR and the destabilizing form of 40 S subunits is not always productive. One possibility is that this interaction determines the decapping of the mRNA, but this event would not be obligatory and could occur only on a fraction of mRNAs. Another possibility is that only a fraction of 40 S ribosomes carry an mRNase. We recall that the hypothesis of a fraction of ribosomes devoted to the degradation of mRNA was advanced years ago for Escherichia coli (24Mangiarotti G. Kwano M. Schlessinger D. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Since mRNA destabilization apparently involves the interaction between the 5′UTR and 40 S ribosomal subunits, the latter must function as independent particles, not joined to 60 S subunits. When the cyclic dissociation of ribosomal subunits was discovered (25Mangiarotti G. Schlessinger D. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 29: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26Schlessinger D.

Nature. 1970; 278: 534-539Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it was interpreted as due to the modality of the initiation and termination stages of the synthesis of polypeptide chains. The data presented in this paper suggest that at least in some cases 40 S subunits have a function in which they act alone and which is not strictly related to protein synthesis (destabilizing a class of mRNA). It has been reported (29Sommerman J. Banenle A. Winckler T. Mutzel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23091-23096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that calmodulin binds to a protein of 60 S ribosomal subunits and presumably in so doing participates in the regulation of the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+.

Perhaps we should consider that ribosomal subunits may have functions different from protein synthesis. We thank Drs. D. Hayes and V. Ingram for critical reading of the manuscript."
