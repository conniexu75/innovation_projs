https://openalex.org/W1559117436,"Cytosolic DNA induces type I interferon via activation of STING; the immediate STING activator is produced by the recently identified DNA sensor cGAS and is shown here to be an unorthodox cyclic dinucleotide harbouring a 2′-5′ linkage between guanosine and adenosine. The mechanism of sensing and signalling of cytosolic DNA by the innate immune system is a topic of intense research interest as it is the means by which invading bacteria and viruses are detected. Cytosolic DNA is known to induce type I interferon through activation of the DNA sensor cyclic-GMP-AMP synthetase (cGAS), which catalyses the synthesis of a cyclic dinucleotide which in turn activates a protein known as STING (stimulator of interferon genes). Karl-Peter Hopfner and co-workers present the crystal structures of a C-terminal fragment of cGAS alone, in complex with UTP, and as a DNA–ATP–GTP complex. In a complementary paper [in this issue], Veit Hornung and coworkers show that the product of cGAS is distinct from previously characterized cyclic dinucleotides. Rather it is an unorthodox cyclic dinucleotide with a 2′–5′ linkage between guanosine and adenosine. This two-step synthesis of cGAMP(2′–5′) could be a focus for the development of specific inhibitors for the treatment of autoimmune diseases that engage the cGAS–STING axis. Detection of cytoplasmic DNA represents one of the most fundamental mechanisms of the innate immune system to sense the presence of microbial pathogens1. Moreover, erroneous detection of endogenous DNA by the same sensing mechanisms has an important pathophysiological role in certain sterile inflammatory conditions2,3. The endoplasmic-reticulum-resident protein STING is critically required for the initiation of type I interferon signalling upon detection of cytosolic DNA of both exogenous and endogenous origin4,5,6,7,8. Next to its pivotal role in DNA sensing, STING also serves as a direct receptor for the detection of cyclic dinucleotides, which function as second messenger molecules in bacteria9,10,11,12,13. DNA recognition, however, is triggered in an indirect fashion that depends on a recently characterized cytoplasmic nucleotidyl transferase, termed cGAMP synthase (cGAS), which upon interaction with DNA synthesizes a dinucleotide molecule that in turn binds to and activates STING14,15. We here show in vivo and in vitro that the cGAS-catalysed reaction product is distinct from previously characterized cyclic dinucleotides. Using a combinatorial approach based on mass spectrometry, enzymatic digestion, NMR analysis and chemical synthesis we demonstrate that cGAS produces a cyclic GMP-AMP dinucleotide, which comprises a 2′-5′ and a 3′-5′ phosphodiester linkage >Gp(2′-5′)Ap(3′-5′)>. We found that the presence of this 2′-5′ linkage was required to exert potent activation of human STING. Moreover, we show that cGAS first catalyses the synthesis of a linear 2′-5′-linked dinucleotide, which is then subject to cGAS-dependent cyclization in a second step through a 3′-5′ phosphodiester linkage. This 13-membered ring structure defines a novel class of second messenger molecules, extending the family of 2′-5′-linked antiviral biomolecules."

The mature human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) capsid is best described by a 'fullerene cone' model, in which hexamers of the capsid protein are linked to form a hexagonal surface lattice that is closed by incorporating 12 capsid-protein pentamers. HIV-1 capsid protein contains an amino-terminal domain (NTD) comprising seven α-helices and a β-hairpin, a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) comprising four α-helices, and a flexible linker with a 310-helix connecting the two structural domains. Structures of the capsid-protein assembly units have been determined by X-ray crystallography; however, structural information regarding the assembled capsid and the contacts between the assembly units is incomplete. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a tubular HIV-1 capsid-protein assembly at 8 Å resolution and the three-dimensional structure of a native HIV-1 core by cryo-electron tomography. The structure of the tubular assembly shows, at the three-fold interface, a three-helix bundle with critical hydrophobic interactions. Mutagenesis studies confirm that hydrophobic residues in the centre of the three-helix bundle are crucial for capsid assembly and stability, and for viral infectivity. The cryo-electron-microscopy structures enable modelling by large-scale molecular dynamics simulation, resulting in all-atom models for the hexamer-of-hexamer and pentamer-of-hexamer elements as well as for the entire capsid. Incorporation of pentamers results in closer trimer contacts and induces acute surface curvature. The complete atomic HIV-1 capsid model provides a platform for further studies of capsid function and for targeted pharmacological intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2119864130,"Cytosolic DNA arising from intracellular bacterial or viral infections is a powerful pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that leads to innate immune host defence by the production of type I interferon and inflammatory cytokines. Recognition of cytosolic DNA by the recently discovered cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) induces the production of cGAMP to activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Here we report the crystal structure of cGAS alone and in complex with DNA, ATP and GTP along with functional studies. Our results explain the broad DNA sensing specificity of cGAS, show how cGAS catalyses dinucleotide formation and indicate activation by a DNA-induced structural switch. cGAS possesses a remarkable structural similarity to the antiviral cytosolic double-stranded RNA sensor 2′-5′oligoadenylate synthase (OAS1), but contains a unique zinc thumb that recognizes B-form double-stranded DNA. Our results mechanistically unify dsRNA and dsDNA innate immune sensing by OAS1 and cGAS nucleotidyl transferases. Cytosolic DNA arising from intracellular bacterial or viral infections induces type I interferon through activation of the DNA sensor cGAS, which catalyses the synthesis of cyclic dinucleotide which in turn activates STING; here the crystal structures of a carboxy-terminal fragment of cGAS alone and in complex with UTP and DNA–ATP–GTP complex are determined.

https://openalex.org/W2068052762,"Immunotherapy Packs a One-Two Punch Despite the immune system's best efforts, cancer always seems to be one step ahead. One example of this is that tumor cells express CD47 on their cell surface. CD47 acts as a “don't eat me” signal to phagocytic macrophages. A potential therapeutic strategy could thus be to block this signal. Weiskopf et al. (p. 88 , published online 30 May; see the Perspective by Kershaw and Smyth ) created variants of the CD47 receptor, SIRPα, that could act as high-affinity antagonists of CD47. Although the antagonists blocked CD47 effectively in tumor-bearing mice, on their own they did not induce macrophages to phagocytose the tumor cells. When paired with a variety of therapeutic antitumor antibodies, however, the CD47 antagonists were very effective in treating several mouse tumor models."

https://openalex.org/W2021253771,"Female mosquitoes of some species are generalists and will blood-feed on a variety of vertebrate hosts, whereas others display marked host preference. Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti have evolved a strong preference for humans, making them dangerously efficient vectors of malaria and Dengue haemorrhagic fever. Specific host odours probably drive this strong preference because other attractive cues, including body heat and exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2), are common to all warm-blooded hosts. Insects sense odours via several chemosensory receptor families, including the odorant receptors (ORs), membrane proteins that form heteromeric odour-gated ion channels comprising a variable ligand-selective subunit and an obligate co-receptor called Orco (ref. 6). Here we use zinc-finger nucleases to generate targeted mutations in the orco gene of A. aegypti to examine the contribution of Orco and the odorant receptor pathway to mosquito host selection and sensitivity to the insect repellent DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide). orco mutant olfactory sensory neurons have greatly reduced spontaneous activity and lack odour-evoked responses. Behaviourally, orco mutant mosquitoes have severely reduced attraction to honey, an odour cue related to floral nectar, and do not respond to human scent in the absence of CO2. However, in the presence of CO2, female orco mutant mosquitoes retain strong attraction to both human and animal hosts, but no longer strongly prefer humans. orco mutant females are attracted to human hosts even in the presence of DEET, but are repelled upon contact, indicating that olfactory- and contact-mediated effects of DEET are mechanistically distinct. We conclude that the odorant receptor pathway is crucial for an anthropophilic vector mosquito to discriminate human from non-human hosts and to be effectively repelled by volatile DEET."

https://openalex.org/W2086993468,"Here, we show that apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), the major protein component of high density lipoprotein (HDL), through both innate and adaptive immune processes, potently suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in multiple animal tumor models, including the aggressive B16F10L murine malignant melanoma model. Mice expressing the human apoA1 transgene (A1Tg) exhibited increased infiltration of CD11b(+) F4/80(+) macrophages with M1, anti-tumor phenotype, reduced tumor burden and metastasis, and enhanced survival. In contrast, apoA1-deficient (A1KO) mice showed markedly heightened tumor growth and reduced survival. Injection of human apoA1 into A1KO mice inoculated with tumor cells remarkably reduced both tumor growth and metastasis, enhanced survival, and promoted regression of both tumor and metastasis burden when administered following palpable tumor formation and metastasis development. Studies with apolipoprotein A2 revealed the anti-cancer therapeutic effect was specific to apoA1. In vitro studies ruled out substantial direct suppressive effects by apoA1 or HDL on tumor cells. Animal models defective in different aspects of immunity revealed both innate and adaptive arms of immunity contribute to complete apoA1 anti-tumor activity. This study reveals a potent immunomodulatory role for apoA1 in the tumor microenvironment, altering tumor-associated macrophages from a pro-tumor M2 to an anti-tumor M1 phenotype. Use of apoA1 to redirect in vivo elicited tumor-infiltrating macrophages toward tumor rejection may hold benefit as a potential cancer therapeutic."

Using state-of-the-art simulation codes, Melosh et al. (p. 1552 , published online 30 May; see the Perspective by Montesi ) developed a model to explain the formation of mascons, linking the processes of impact cratering, tectonic deformation, and volcanic extrusion."
https://openalex.org/W2052849118,"Cholesterol is a structural component of the cell and is indispensable for normal cellular function, although its excess often leads to abnormal proliferation, migration, inflammatory responses and/or cell death. To prevent cholesterol overload, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters mediate cholesterol efflux from the cells to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and the apoA-I-containing high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Maintaining efficient cholesterol efflux is essential for normal cellular function. However, the role of cholesterol efflux in angiogenesis and the identity of its local regulators are poorly understood. Here we show that apoA-I binding protein (AIBP) accelerates cholesterol efflux from endothelial cells to HDL and thereby regulates angiogenesis. AIBP- and HDL-mediated cholesterol depletion reduces lipid rafts, interferes with VEGFR2 (also known as KDR) dimerization and signalling and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis in vitro and mouse aortic neovascularization ex vivo. Notably, Aibp, a zebrafish homologue of human AIBP, regulates the membrane lipid order in embryonic zebrafish vasculature and functions as a non-cell-autonomous regulator of angiogenesis. aibp knockdown results in dysregulated sprouting/branching angiogenesis, whereas forced Aibp expression inhibits angiogenesis. Dysregulated angiogenesis is phenocopied in Abca1 (also known as Abca1a) Abcg1-deficient embryos, and cholesterol levels are increased in Aibp-deficient and Abca1 Abcg1-deficient embryos. Our findings demonstrate that secreted AIBP positively regulates cholesterol efflux from endothelial cells and that effective cholesterol efflux is critical for proper angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2059610488,"The role of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL in regulating mitochondrial Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]mito) handling was examined in wild-type (WT) and Bcl-xL knock-out (Bcl-xL-KO) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-generating agonist evoked cytosolic Ca(2+) transients that produced a larger [Ca(2+)]mito uptake in WT cells compared with Bcl-xL-KO. In permeabilized cells, stepping external [Ca(2+)] from 0 to 3 μm also produced a larger [Ca(2+)]mito uptake in WT; moreover, the [Ca(2+)]mito uptake capacity of Bcl-xL-KO cells was restored by re-expression of mitochondrially targeted Bcl-xL. Bcl-xL enhancement of [Ca(2+)]mito uptake persisted after dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential but was absent in mitoplasts lacking an outer mitochondrial membrane. The outer membrane-localized voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is a known Ca(2+) permeability pathway that directly interacts with Bcl-xL. Bcl-xL interacted with VDAC1 and -3 isoforms, and peptides based on the VDAC sequence disrupted Bcl-xL binding. Peptides reduced [Ca(2+)]mito uptake in WT but were without effect in Bcl-xL-KO cells. In addition, peptides reduced [Ca(2+)]mito uptake in VDAC1 and VDAC3 knock-out but not VDAC1 and -3 double knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, confirming that Bcl-xL interacts functionally with VDAC1 and -3 but not VDAC2. Thus, an interaction between Bcl-xL and VDAC promotes matrix Ca(2+) accumulation by increasing Ca(2+) transfer across the outer mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2052404695,"Many neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and polyglutamine diseases, share a common pathogenic mechanism: the abnormal accumulation of disease-causing proteins, due to either the mutant protein's resistance to degradation or overexpression of the wild-type protein. We have developed a strategy to identify therapeutic entry points for such neurodegenerative disorders by screening for genetic networks that influence the levels of disease-driving proteins. We applied this approach, which integrates parallel cell-based and Drosophila genetic screens, to spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), a disease caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract in ataxin 1 (ATXN1). Our approach revealed that downregulation of several components of the RAS-MAPK-MSK1 pathway decreases ATXN1 levels and suppresses neurodegeneration in Drosophila and mice. Importantly, pharmacological inhibitors of components of this pathway also decrease ATXN1 levels, suggesting that these components represent new therapeutic targets in mitigating SCA1. Collectively, these data reveal new therapeutic entry points for SCA1 and provide a proof-of-principle for tackling other classes of intractable neurodegenerative diseases."

(p. 1475 , published online 30 May) demonstrate that compartmentalized calcium transients in dendrites function as the spatiotemporal cue for pruning of unwanted branches. Such a localized calcium signal, induced by a local elevation of branch excitability, activates calcium-dependent proteinases and eventually causes branch death."
https://openalex.org/W2076828451,"Magnetars are neutron stars with X-ray and soft γ-ray outbursts thought to be powered by intense internal magnetic fields. Like conventional neutron stars in the form of radio pulsars, magnetars exhibit 'glitches' during which angular momentum is believed to be transferred between the solid outer crust and the superfluid component of the inner crust. The several hundred observed glitches in radio pulsars and magnetars have involved a sudden spin-up (increase in the angular velocity) of the star, presumably because the interior superfluid was rotating faster than the crust. Here we report X-ray timing observations of the magnetar 1E 2259+586 (ref. 8), which exhibited a clear 'anti-glitch'--a sudden spin-down. We show that this event, like some previous magnetar spin-up glitches, was accompanied by multiple X-ray radiative changes and a significant spin-down rate change. Such behaviour is not predicted by models of neutron star spin-down and, if of internal origin, is suggestive of differential rotation in the magnetar, supporting the need for a rethinking of glitch theory for all neutron stars."
https://openalex.org/W1975602384,"Macrophages not only initiate and accentuate inflammation after tissue injury, but they are also involved in resolution and repair. This difference in macrophage activity is the result of a differentiation process to either M1 or M2 phenotypes. M1 macrophages are pro-inflammatory and have microbicidal and tumoricidal activity, whereas the M2 macrophages are involved in tumor progression and tissue remodeling and can be profibrotic in certain conditions. Because mitochondrial Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD)-mediated H2O2 is crucial for development of pulmonary fibrosis, we hypothesized that Cu,Zn-SOD modulated the macrophage phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate that Cu,Zn-SOD polarized macrophages to an M2 phenotype, and Cu,Zn-SOD-mediated H2O2 levels modulated M2 gene expression at the transcriptional level by redox regulation of a critical cysteine in STAT6. Furthermore, overexpression of Cu,Zn-SOD in mice resulted in a profibrotic environment and accelerated the development of pulmonary fibrosis, whereas polarization of macrophages to the M1 phenotype attenuated pulmonary fibrosis. Taken together, these observations provide a novel mechanism of Cu,Zn-SOD-mediated and Th2-independent M2 polarization and provide a potential therapeutic target for attenuating the accelerated development of pulmonary fibrosis."

In addition, localization studies place KEG at the trans-Golgi network, whereas ABI5 is nuclear. Here we show that KEG interacts directly with ABI5 via its conserved C3 region. Interactions between KEG and ABI5 were observed in the cytoplasm and trans-Golgi network only when the RING domain of KEG was inactivated or when ABI5 was stabilized via mutations. Deletion of the C-terminal region of ABI5 or substituting lysine 344 for alanine (K344A) prohibited protein turnover.

In particular, AP-1 has been implicated in controlling MMP-9 gene transcription (10.Kaczmarek L. Lapinska-Dzwonek J. Szymczak S. Matrix metalloproteinases in the adult brain physiology. A link between c-Fos, AP-1 and remodeling of neuronal connections?.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6643-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24.Rylski M. Amborska R. Zybura K. Michaluk P. Bielinska B.

Neurosci. 2009; 40: 98-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, regulation of neuronal MMP-9 transcription, in particular in vivo, after fear conditioning is virtually unknown. In this study, we show that fear conditioning-enhanced MMP-9 enzymatic activity follows its mRNA accumulation in different mouse brain structures pivotal for fear circuitry. Furthermore, we show that increased expression of MMP-9 mRNA is preceded by enhanced expression of c-Fos and c-Jun, major components of the AP-1 transcription factor that has been implicated in MMP-9 gene regulation. Moreover, AP-1 binding was also increased after the training. Finally, we mutated the promoter sequence of mouse MMP-9 gene at four proximal AP-1 putative sites by in vitro mutagenesis, and then we introduced all those reporter constructs, by means of electroporation, into the brains of newly born mouse pups, aiming at the medial prefrontal cortex. As a result, we have found that two specific AP-1 binding sites in the MMP-9 gene promoter (-42/-50 and −478/-486) mediate its activation following fear conditioning. Hence, our data implicate AP-1 as a positive regulator of MMP-9 gene transcription in neurons after fear learning. The experiment was performed on adult, experimentally naïve male C57BL/6 mice (25–30 g) supplied by the Nencki Institute Animal House. For 1 month before the experiment, the animals were housed in pairs in standard home cages (23.0 × 18.0 × 12.5 cm) with food and water provided ad libitum. The mice were habituated to the hand of the experimenter for 5 days preceding the experiment. The experiment was carried out in accordance with the Polish Act on Animal Welfare after obtaining specific permission from the First Warsaw Ethical Committee on Animal Research. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals and their suffering. The mice were randomly divided into two groups (non-shocked (NS) and shocked (S)). In the behavioral experiments, all animals were habituated for 3 days (one 20-min session/day) to the experimental room and marking process. The training was performed in MedAssociates fear conditioning chambers housed in a sound-attenuating room. In the S group, mice were put into the experimental cages where, after an 180-s adaptation period, a single foot shock (US) was delivered (0.7 mA of 50-Hz pulses for 2 s). Then, after 60 s, mice were removed from the experimental cage (25.Knapska E. Nikolaev E. Boguszewski P. Walasek G. Blaszczyk J. Kaczmarek L. Werka T. Between-subject transfer of emotional information evokes specific pattern of amygdala activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3858-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the NS group, mice were merely exposed to the experimental cages for an equivalent amount of time (242 s). Then the mice were sacrificed at 0, 0.5, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h following the training/exposure. Twelve animals were used per each experimental group. The mouse MMP-9 gene promoter fragment −1625/+595 bp (with first exon and intron, ExIn WT, 2220 bp) and −1625/+19 bp (transcription start site, Tss WT, 1644 bp) from the MMP-9 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector (RP23-449M22) was replaced in place of the CMV promoter into the p-eGFP-N1 plasmid. Here, two PCR steps were conducted by one common foreword and two different overlapping PCR primers (RF-ExIn/Tss-F, 5′-CCTGATTCTGTGGATAACCGTATTACCGCCATGCATGCCTTGGCAGTCATGGATGTGTGTCC-3′, 65.6/62.7 °C; Exin-R, 5′-CTCGCCCTTGCTCACCATGGTGGCGATATGCCTGTGGATGGAGGAAGGGGC-3′, 65.8/62.6 °C; Tss-R, 5′-CTCGCCCTTGCTCACCATGGTGGCGAGGTGAGGACCGCAGCTTCTGGCTAA-3′: 65.8/62.6 °C; the promoter sequences are underlined) followed by DpnI digestion at the last step (26.Van den Ent F. Lowe J. RF cloning. A restriction-free method for inserting target genes into plasmids.J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 2006; 67: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). To enhance the GFP expression from the eGFP initiation codon, point mutations were carried out in the ExIn WT plasmid at the Tss of the MMP-9 gene by a phosphorylated (*) primer pair (ExIn M forward, 5′*-CGGTCCTCACCATCAGTCCCTGGCAG-3′, 65.8 °C and reverse, 5′*CAGCTTCTGGCTAACGCGCCTTTGCAGAG-3′, 65.7 °C). Point mutations in the core of four AP-1 binding motifs of the MMP-9 gene promoter were generated with a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the protocol of the manufacturer using the following phosphorylated primer pairs: AP-1a forward, 5′*-GGCGGGGTCACTGATAACGTTTTACTGCCTCT-3′, 65.7 °C and reverse, 5′*-GCCTCCCCTCCAGGCTTATGCTGACTCA-3′, 65.8 °C; AP-1b forward, 5′*-CACACACACACGCTGAGAAAGCATA AGCCTGGAGGG-3′, 69 °C and reverse, 5′*-TGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTTTACA-3′, 69 °C; AP-1c forward, 5′*-GCCAGGAGAGGAAGCTGAGAAAAAGACTCTATCAGG-3′, 66.7 °C and reverse, 5′*-CTCTGGGAGCAGGCTCTTTGAGGCAGGATTTG-3′, 67.0 °C; and AP-1d forward, 5′*-GGCACACAGGAGGCTTAGAAAGAACAGCTTGCTGAAG-3′, 67.8 °C and reverse, 5′*-AGACCTTCATGTGCTTCCCAACGAACAGACCTGTGAG-3′, 67.8 °C; mutated nucleotides are underlined). General and HPLC-grade oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genomed (Poland) and Metabion (Germany), respectively. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing by Genomed (ABI377, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The WT-mmp-9-e-GFP promoter and EF-1β-galactosidase constructs were purified with the Endo Free plasmid isolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and were in vivo-electroporated into zero day postnatal (P0) MMP-9 WT mouse pups according to the protocol of Swartz et al. (27.Swartz M. Eberhart J. Mastick G.S. Krull C.E. Sparking new frontiers. Using in vivo electroporation for genetic manipulations.Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). One month following plasmid delivery, the mice were randomly divided into two groups (S and NS) and subjected to behavioral training as described earlier. After 6 h the mice were sacrificed, and the brains were fixed and processed for either immunochemistry or a GFP reporter assay. The immunofluorescence studies were carried out with anti-GFP-specific primary and secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The procedure was essentially as described by Gawlak et al. (28.Gawlak M. Górkiewicz T. Gorlewicz A. Konopacki F.A. Kaczmarek L. Wilczynski G.M. High resolution in situ zymography reveals matrix metalloproteinase activity at glutamatergic synapses.Neuroscience. 2009; 158: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The sections were dewaxed in absolute ethanol (37 °C, twice, for 5 min and 10 min, respectively). Afterward, the alcohol was removed, and slices were hydrated with PBS (pH 7.4), and in situ zymography was performed as follows. The specimens were first preincubated in water at 37 °C for 40 min and then overlaid with a fluorogenic substrate dye quenched gelatin (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted 1:100 in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer for 40 min at 37 °C. Then they were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. Next, the slides were mounted directly in Vectashield (Vector, Burlingame, CA) (29.Ganguly K. Swarnakar S. Chronic gastric ulceration causes matrix metalloproteinases-9 and -3 augmentation. Alleviation by melatonin.Biochimie. 2012; 94: 2687-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The analysis of gelatinase (green channel) were captured as a single plane of confocal images at six to eight Z-stacks using a 63× objective (oil immersion, 1.3 NA) with a zoom factor of six. The settings of photomultipliers were adjusted to obtain the maximal dynamic ranges of pixels in each channel. We designed an optimized program for all the images as described in the image processing sections of the text using a macro program and ran the recorded macro program for all the obtained images within ImageJ software. Using an unbiased counting frame in each picture, at each time point we estimated the mean number of objects/unit area of the tissue, the ratio of the number of objects to the number of all gelatinolytic-immunopositive objects, and the mean fluorescence intensity of the objects, defined as the product of the mean area of the localizing objects times the mean brightness. At least four animals were analyzed at each time point. Brains were rapidly removed, and the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala were dissected separately on a cold plate. The sets of samples (S and NS) were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitors (Sigma), minced, and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was collected in new centrifuge tubes marked as PBS extracts. The pellet was extracted in the lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min to obtain the Triton X-100 extract. Tissue extracts were preserved at −70 °C and used later. PBS and Triton X-100 extracts from all types of tissue were used for purification of gelatinase. Briefly, an extract was mixed with gelatin-agarose beads, incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, and followed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min. The pellet was washed twice with PBS through centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min, and MMP-2 and -9 were eluted by incubating the pellet with Laemmli sample loading buffer for 10 min at room temperature (14.Nagy V.

Samples were equalized on the basis of the direct protein concentration measurements using the BCA method (Thermo Scientific). For assay of MMP-9 and -2 activities, tissue extracts were electrophoresed in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 1 mg/ml gelatin (Sigma) under non-reducing conditions. The gels were washed twice in 2.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and then incubated in calcium assay buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2) for 18 h at 37 °C. The bands of gelatinolytic activity appeared as negative staining (14.Nagy V. Bozdagi O. Matynia A. Balcerzyk M. Okulski P. Dzwonek J. Costa R.M. Silva A.J. Kaczmarek L. Huntley G.W.

High resolution in situ zymography reveals matrix metalloproteinase activity at glutamatergic synapses.Neuroscience. 2009; 158: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A variation of gel zymography using acrylamide gel copolymerized with 0.4% FITC-labeled gelatin was used. This method allows real-time monitoring of enzymatic activity under UV light and shows a higher sensitivity than Coomassie staining. Quantification of zymographic bands was done using densitometry linked to proper software (Lab Image). The coding sequence of MMP-9 mRNA (ATG probe) and 3′ UTR (UTR probe) were reverse-transcribed and cloned into a pDrive plasmid (Qiagen PCR cloning kit). Sense and antisense fluorescein-labeled riboprobes were generated from plasmids with SP6 or T7 polymerase sites. For in situ hybridization studies, the animals were lethally anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were removed, post-fixed in the same fixative, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose, and snap-frozen in isopentane cooled on dry ice. The staining was performed on 40 μm-thick, free-floating sections. Acetylation buffer (0.1 m triethanolamine, 0.25% HCl, 0.25% acetic anhydride) was applied for 15 min at room temperature. Next, sections were prehybridized for 3 h in prehybridization solution (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by overnight hybridization at 72 °C in hybridization solution (Sigma-Aldrich) containing a 1:1 mixture of ATG and UTR sense or antisense probes. Afterward, cells were washed in 0.2× SSC, with the first two washes carried out for 1 h at 70 °C and then five consecutive washes for 30 min at room temperature. Then, 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate blocking solution (TSA Plus System, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was applied for 1 h (30.Dziembowska M. Milek J. Janusz A. Rejmak E. Romanowska E. Gorkiewicz T. Tiron A. Bramham C.R. Kaczmarek L. Activity dependent local translation of matrix metalloproteinase-9.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 14538-14547Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with mouse anti-MAP-2 antibody (Sigma), 1:200, overnight in 4 °C, washed with PBS with Tween 20 (PBST), incubated with secondary antibody (1:1000 Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, Invitrogen), and mounted in Vectashield after nuclear-specific TO-PRO staining (Vector Laboratories). Cells were also incubated with anti-c-Fos- and anti-P-c-Jun-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 1:200 overnight in 4 °C, washed with PBST, and incubated with secondary antibody (1:1000, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen)) and mounted in Vectashield after nuclear-specific TO-PRO staining (Vector Laboratories). The hybridization signal was amplified with the Cy3 TSA Plus System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The analysis of MMP-9 mRNA localization (red channel) were captured as a single plane of confocal images of six to eight Z-stacks using a ×100 objective (oil immersion, 1.3 NA) with a zoom factor of three. Images were processed as described previously under “Experimental Procedures.” Total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer and quantified by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. Complementary DNA was synthesized using 1 μg of total RNA from each sample in a 20-μl reaction buffer using Superscript II reverse transcriptase with an oligo(dT)15 primer (-24). Complementary DNA was amplified against forward and reverse primers of MMP-9: forward, 5′-CTTCTGGCGTGTGAGTTTCCA-3′ and reverse, 5′-ACTGCACGGTTGAAGCAAAGA-3′; eGFP forward, 5′-GTCCAGGAGCGCACCATCT-3′ and reverse, 5′-GCTTGTGCCCCAGGATGTT-3′; c-Fos forward, 5′-TTCCCCAAACTTCGACCATG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGTGTTGACAGGAGAGCCCAT-3′; c-Jun forward, 5′-CATGCTAACGCAGCAGTTGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-ACCCTTGGCTTCAGTACTCGG-3′; and GAPDH forward, 5′-TGCCCCCATGTTTGTGATG-3′ and reverse, 5′-GGTCATGAGCCCTTCCACAAT-3′), respectively. The reactions were subjected to denaturation (94 °C for 30 s), annealing (60–61.5 °C for 30 s), and extension (72 °C for 60 s) for 35 cycles (24.Rylski M. Amborska R. Zybura K. Michaluk P.

Real-time PCR was carried out in a 20-μl volume in optical 96-well reaction plates containing 2 μl of cDNA, 10 pmol of each primer, and 10 μl of SYBR Green PCR master mix with a real-time PCR system 7300 (Applied Biosystems, CA).

https://openalex.org/W2071798310,"Maintaining bone architecture requires continuous generation of osteoblasts from osteoprogenitor pools. Our previous study of mice with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) specifically inactivated in osteoblast lineage cells revealed that EGFR stimulates bone formation by expanding the population of mesenchymal progenitors. EGFR ligands are potent regulators for the osteoprogenitor pool, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that activation of EGFR increases the number of osteoprogenitors by promoting cell proliferation and suppressing either serum depletion-induced or TNFα-induced apoptosis mainly through the MAPK/ERK pathway. Mouse calvarial organ culture revealed that EGF elevated the number of proliferative cells and decreased the number of apoptotic cells, which led to increased osteoblasts. Microarray analysis of MC3T3 cells, an osteoprogenitor cell line, revealed that EGFR signaling stimulates the expression of MCL1, an antiapoptotic protein, and a family of EGR transcription factors (EGR1, -2, and -3). The up-regulation of MCL1 and EGR2 by EGF was further confirmed in osteoprogenitors close to the calvarial bone surface. Overexpression of NAB2, a co-repressor for EGRs, attenuated the EGF-induced increase in osteoprogenitor number. Interestingly, knocking down the expression of EGR2, but not EGR1 or -3, resulted in a similar effect. Using inhibitor, adenovirus overexpression, and siRNA approaches, we demonstrate that EGFR signaling activates the MAPK/ERK pathway to stimulate the expression of EGR2, which in turn leads to cell growth and MCL1-mediated cell survival. Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate that EGFR-induced EGR2 expression is critical for osteoprogenitor maintenance and new bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W2036409124,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by liver steatosis; inflammation and fibrosis are features of the progressive form nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The endoplasmic reticulum stress response is postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In particular, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) is undetectable under normal conditions but is induced by cellular stress, including endoplasmic reticulum stress. Chop wild type (Chop(+/+)) and knock-out (Chop(-/-)) mice were used in these studies to elucidate the role of CHOP in the pathogenesis of fatty liver disease. Paradoxically, Chop(-/-) mice developed greater liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis than Chop(+/+) mice, with greater macrophage activation. Primary, bone marrow-derived, and peritoneal macrophages from Chop(+/+) and Chop(-/-) were challenged with palmitic acid, an abundant saturated free fatty acid in plasma and liver lipids. Where palmitic acid treatment activated Chop(+/+) and Chop(-/-) macrophages, Chop(-/-) macrophages were resistant to its lipotoxicity. Chop(-/-) mice were sensitized to liver injury in a second model of dietary steatohepatitis using the methionine-choline-deficient diet. Analysis of bone marrow chimeras between Chop(-/-) and Chop(+/+) mice demonstrated that Chop in macrophages protects from liver injury and inflammation when fed the methionine-choline-deficient diet. We conclude that Chop deletion has a proinflammatory effect in fatty liver injury apparently due to decreased cell death of activated macrophages, resulting in their net accumulation in the liver. Thus, macrophage CHOP plays a key role in protecting the liver from steatohepatitis likely by limiting macrophage survival during lipotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2082680042,"Acquired antimalarial drug resistance produces treatment failures and has led to periods of global disease resurgence. In Plasmodium falciparum, resistance is known to arise through genome-level changes such as mutations and gene duplications. We now report an epigenetic resistance mechanism involving genes responsible for the plasmodial surface anion channel, a nutrient channel that also transports ions and antimalarial compounds at the host erythrocyte membrane. Two blasticidin S-resistant lines exhibited markedly reduced expression of clag genes linked to channel activity, but had no genome-level changes. Silencing aborted production of the channel protein and was directly responsible for reduced uptake. Silencing affected clag paralogs on two chromosomes and was mediated by specific histone modifications, allowing a rapidly reversible drug resistance phenotype advantageous to the parasite. These findings implicate a novel epigenetic resistance mechanism that involves reduced host cell uptake and is a worrisome liability for water-soluble antimalarial drugs."

Upon photoexcitation, BR induces a hyperpolarization across the membrane, which, if incorporated into a nerve cell, results in its neural silencing. In this study, we show that several residues around the retinal chromophore, which are completely conserved among BR homologs from the archaea, are involved in the spectral tuning in a BR homolog (HwBR) and that the combination mutation causes a large spectral blue shift (λmax = 498 nm) while preserving the robust pumping activity. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations revealed that, compared with the wild type, the β-ionone ring of the chromophore in the mutant is rotated ∼130° because of the lack of steric hindrance between the methyl groups of the retinal and the mutated residues, resulting in the breakage of the π conjugation system on the polyene chain of the retinal. By the same mutations, similar spectral blue shifts are also observed in another BR homolog, archearhodopsin-3 (also called Arch). The color variant of archearhodopsin-3 could be successfully expressed in the neural cells of Caenorhabditis elegans, and illumination with blue light (500 nm) led to the effective locomotory paralysis of the worms. Thus, we successfully produced a blue-shifted proton pump for neural silencing.Background: Light-driven proton pumps are utilized to control the neural activity.Results: We have succeeded to produce a blue-shifted proton pump.

Light-absorbing photoactive proteins show characteristic colors originating from a species specific energy gap between their ground state and excited state, which leads to different characteristic absorption maxima (λmax). Among these proteins and their cognate chromophores, the rhodopsins are known to show a large variation in their absorption spectra depending on the interaction between the apoprotein (opsin) and the retinal chromophore, which is called the opsin shift (1.Nielsen M.B. Model systems for understanding absorption tuning by opsin proteins.Chem. Soc. Rev. 2009; 38: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Actually, microbial (type 1) rhodopsins show a wide range of λmax ranging from 485 to 590 nm while keeping the same isomeric composition, all-trans-retinal (2.Sudo Y. Transport and sensory rhodopsins in microorganisms.in: CRC Handbook of Organic Photochemistry and Photobiology. 3rd ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2012: 1173-1193Crossref Google Scholar). Three types of such microbial molecules, proton pumping rhodopsins such as archearhodopsin-3 (AR3), 2The abbreviations used are: AR3, archearhodopsin-3; BR, bacteriorhodopsin; HsBR, BR from H. salinarum; HwBR, a BR homolog from H. walsbyi; RPSB, retinal protonated Schiff base; QM/MM, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics; ChR, channelrhodopsin; HR, halorhodopsin; SR, sensory rhodopsin; MRMP2, second order multireference Møller-Plesset perturbation; FWHM, full width at half-maximum; RWFE-SCF, reweighting free energy self-consistent field. chloride pumping rhodopsins such as halorhodopsin (HR), and cation channel rhodopsins such as channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), have already been utilized as optogenetic tools for controlling the neural activity (3.Zhang F.

The ion pumps (AR3 and HR) and the ion channel (ChR2) induce a hyperpolarization used for neural silencing and a depolarization used for neural activation, respectively (3.Zhang F. Aravanis A.M.

As for fluorescent proteins, the color variants of ion-transporting rhodopsins make it possible to use various wavelengths of light. The λmax of a molecule corresponds to the most probable transition from its ground to excited state (1.Nielsen M.B. Model systems for understanding absorption tuning by opsin proteins.Chem. Soc. Rev. 2009; 38: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Empirical and theoretical studies of the spectral tuning of rhodopsins have suggested several mechanisms including the following: (i) an alteration in the strength of the electrostatic interaction between the retinal protonated Schiff base (RPSB) and its counter ion or hydrogen bond acceptor; (ii) an alteration in the polarity or polarizability of the environment of the chromophore-binding pocket, caused by the arrangement of polar or aromatic residues; and (iii) an isomerization around the 6-S bond (6,7-torsion angle) connecting the polyene chain to the β-ionone ring (1.Nielsen M.B.

Gao J. Combined QM/MM study of the opsin shift in bacteriorhodopsin.J. Comput. Chem. 2002; 23: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). By combinations of these effects, rhodopsins show various absorption maxima. All microbial rhodopsins are quite similar in their primary and tertiary structures, especially in the chromophore-binding site (13.Kouyama T. Murakami M. Structural divergence and functional versatility of the rhodopsin superfamily.Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2010; 9: 1458-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting that the λmax is mainly controlled by the slight structural difference(s) of their side chain(s). For example, the λmax value of sensory rhodopsin II (SRII) (∼ 500 nm) is remarkably different from that of other rhodopsins such as bacteriorhodopsin (BR), HR, or sensory rhodopsin I (SRI) (560–590 nm) (2.Sudo Y. Transport and sensory rhodopsins in microorganisms.in: CRC Handbook of Organic Photochemistry and Photobiology. 3rd ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2012: 1173-1193Crossref Google Scholar). This is reasonable because SRII is a negative sensor for light which contains harmful UV radiation (14.Sasaki J. Spudich J.L. Signal transfer in haloarchaeal sensory rhodopsin-transducer complexes.Photochem. Photobiol. 2008; 84: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Previously, we have investigated the color-tuning mechanism in rhodopsins experimentally (15.Shimono K. Ikeura Y. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Kamo N.

Chem. 2003; 278: 23882-23889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In those studies that aimed to determine the key residue(s) contributing to the color change of SRII, several SRII mutants were analyzed in which each residue was replaced by its corresponding residue in BR. In addition to this, we also performed similar experiments for SRI (17.Sudo Y. Yuasa Y. Shibata J. Suzuki D. Homma M. Spectral tuning in sensory rhodopsin I from Salinibacter ruber.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 11328-11336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). From the results, we have found the key residues (factors) contributing to the color change from orange (∼500 nm) to purple (∼560 nm), as well as several unique factors, as the interaction between the D- and E-helices for SRII (16.Shimono K. Hayashi T. Ikeura Y. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Kamo N. Importance of the broad regional interaction for spectral tuning in Natronobacterium pharaonis phoborhodopsin (sensory rhodopsin II).J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23882-23889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or the chloride ion binding around the β-ionone ring for SRI (18.Suzuki D. Furutani Y. Inoue K. Kikukawa T. Sakai M. Fujii M. Kandori H. Homma M. Sudo Y. Effects of chloride ion binding on the photochemical properties of Salinibacter sensory rhodopsin I.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 48-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), respectively. On the basis of this knowledge combined with other findings, we aimed, in this study, to produce blue-shifted color variants of BR (Fig. 1A). As mentioned above, it can be estimated that the introduction of polarity or polarizability around the β-ionone ring, or the removal of those around the Schiff base would cause a spectral blue shift (Asp-123 → Ala, Ser-149 → Ala, and Ala-223 → Thr in Fig. 1B). Moreover, it can be predicted that a volume change around the β-ionone ring would cause a change in interaction between the retinal and the replaced residues (Met-126 → Ala and Ser-149 → Ala in Fig. 1B), resulting in a spectral shift caused by the isomerization around the 6-S bond. According to the amino acid sequence alignment of BR homologs, we identified four candidates for the color-tuning residues, which are completely conserved among BR homologs (Fig. 1B). It should be noted that, because of the property of the well studied BR from Halobacterium salinarum (HsBR) of not forming proper functional rhodopsins outside its native halobacterial membrane, the investigation of its color-tuning mechanism has been performed using refolded HsBR salvaged from denatured Escherichia coli inclusion bodies (19.Greenhalgh D.A. Farrens D.L. Subramaniam S. Khorana H.G. Hydrophobic amino acids in the retinal-binding pocket of bacteriorhodopsin.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20305-20311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This might cause unexpected effects such as improper protein folding and improper interaction with retinal in HsBR. In contrast, a new microbial BR-like rhodopsin from Haloquadratum walsbyi (HwBR), which we have found recently, functions as a robust proton pump also in E. coli cells (20.Sudo Y. Ihara K. Kobayashi S. Suzuki D. Irieda H. Kikukawa T. Kandori H. Homma M. A microbial rhodopsin with a unique retinal composition shows both sensory rhodopsin II and bacteriorhodopsin-like properties.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 5967-5976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Utilizing this protein and another BR homolog (AR3), we achieved the production of large spectral blue-shifted orange pigments (λmax = 498 nm and λmax = 500 nm, respectively) by combination of the mutations while keeping their robust pumping activity. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, which exhibit the strengths associated with both methods (QM (accuracy) and MM (speed)), revealed that the origin of the spectral shift was in the rotation of the 6-S bond. Furthermore, these color variants provided us with a tool to control the neural activity of Caenorhabditis elegans effectively upon illumination with blue light (500 nm). Thus, neural silencing in living cells is now controllable by different wavelengths of light (500–560 nm), including those also absorbed by ChR2 and its variant. The expression plasmid for the wild-type HwBR was constructed as described previously (20.Sudo Y. Ihara K. Kobayashi S. Suzuki D. Irieda H. Kikukawa T. Kandori H. Homma M. A microbial rhodopsin with a unique retinal composition shows both sensory rhodopsin II and bacteriorhodopsin-like properties.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 5967-5976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mutant genes were constructed by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (21.Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Tyr-199 and charged residues of pharaonis phoborhodopsin are important for the interaction with its transducer.Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 427-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The gene of AR3 was amplified using PCR from the genomic DNA of Halorubrum sodomense and was inserted into the arabinose-inducible expression vector as described previously (20.Sudo Y. Ihara K. Kobayashi S. Suzuki D. Irieda H. Kikukawa T. Kandori H. Homma M. A microbial rhodopsin with a unique retinal composition shows both sensory rhodopsin II and bacteriorhodopsin-like properties.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 5967-5976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Consequently, the plasmid encodes AR3 with six histidines at the C terminus. The E. coli DH5a strain was used as a host for DNA manipulation. All constructed plasmids were analyzed using an automated sequencer to confirm the expected nucleotide sequences. The preparation of crude membranes and purification of proteins were performed using essentially the same method described previously (22.Sudo Y. Okada A. Suzuki D. Inoue K. Irieda H. Sakai M. Fujii M. Furutani Y. Kandori H. Homma M. Characterization of a signaling complex composed of sensory rhodopsin I and its cognate transducer protein from the eubacterium Salinibacter ruber.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 10136-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins with a six-histidine tag at the C terminus were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells as recombinant proteins, solubilized by n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and purified with a Ni2+ affinity column. Where necessary, the samples were further purified with an anion exchange column. The purified sample was concentrated and exchanged using an Amicon Ultra filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA), against a buffer containing 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, and 0.05% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. UV-visible spectra were recorded using a UV2450 spectrophotometer with an ISR2200 integrating sphere (Shimazu, Kyoto, Japan). The temperature was kept constant at 298 K. HPLC analysis was performed following the published procedure (23.Kitajima-Ihara T. Furutani Y. Suzuki D. Ihara K. Kandori H. Homma M. Sudo Y. Salinibacter sensory rhodopsin. Sensory rhodopsin I-like protein from a eubacterium.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23533-23541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The proton transport activity of each protein was measured by monitoring pH changes using a glass electrode. The cells of E. coli expressing HwBR were harvested by centrifugation (4,800 × g for 3 min), and then they were washed three times and resuspended in the solvent for the measurement (100 mm NaCl). 7.5 ml of cell suspension was kept in darkness and then illuminated with the output of a 100 W xenon arc lamp (LM103; Asahi Spectra, Tokyo, Japan) through a long pass glass filter for 5 min at a specific wavelength region (WT HwBR: >510 nm; M126A/S149A/A223T and D123A/M126A/S149A/A223T: >460 nm). The power of the light was controlled by ND filters (0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 W) for measuring the power dependence of the pumping activities. For the measurement of the action spectra, interference filters (full width at half-maximum (FWHM) = 10 nm) were used to obtain the light at specific wavelengths by filtering the output of the same xenon arc lamp. The photon flux of the light was measured by a calibrated multichannel detector (IRRAD-C2000+; Ocean Optics), and the initial slopes at the specific wavelengths were scaled by these fluxes to obtain the action spectrum. Because of the availability of x-ray crystallographic structures, we performed the molecular simulations for HsBR, which exhibits a close sequence similarity to HwBR especially in the RPSB-binding pocket. A starting simulation model of the protein embedded in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer environment was constructed with the x-ray crystallographic structure of HsBR determined by Luecke et al. (Protein Data Bank code 1C3W) (24.Luecke H. Schobert B. Richter H.T. Cartailler J.P. Lanyi J.K. Structure of bacteriorhodopsin at 1.55 A resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 899-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). The simulation systems of the native protein and the triple mutant (M118A/S141A/A215T, corresponding to M126A/S149A/A223T of HwBR) with a manually rotated β-ionone ring were first equilibrated by molecular dynamics simulations with molecular mechanics force fields. Molecular structures of the active site including the RPSB and the polar groups in the vicinity of protonated Schiff base, Arg-82, Asp-85, Glu-121, and three water molecules (Wat-401, Wat-402, and Wat-406) were then refined by QM/MM reweighting free energy self-consistent field (RWFE-SCF) geometry optimizations (25.Kosugi T. Hayashi S. QM/MM reweighting free energy SCF for geometry optimization on extensive free energy surface of enzymatic reaction.J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2012; 8: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The QM/MM RWFE-SCF method optimized the molecular geometries of the active site at the QM level of theory (density functional theory with B3LYP functional) on a free energy surface constructed with MM conformational statistical samples of the surrounding protein environment obtained by the molecular dynamics simulations. The method can therefore take into account the thermal relaxation of the protein environment during the geometry optimization and thus remove artifacts of structural conflicts introduced in the mutant protein model. Conformational samples of molecular dynamics simulations for 60 and 39 ns in total for the native and mutant proteins, respectively, were used in the QM/MM RWFE-SCF geometry optimization. To examine the effect of the β-ionone ring rotation in the triple mutant on the structural stability and absorption spectral shift, we performed second order multireference Møller-Plesset perturbation (MRMP2) calculations for the RPSB moiety at the free energetically optimized geometries. The MRMP2 calculations were carried out in isolated conditions. A plasmid encoding AR3 fused with GFP at the C terminus was constructed as described previously (26.Okazaki A. Sudo Y. Takagi S. Optical silencing of C. elegans cells with arch proton pump.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e35370Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The M128A/S151A/A225T mutant gene was prepared by the site-directed mutagenesis method. The C. elegans worm strain (N2) expressing AR3 under the control of a pan-neuronal promoter F25B11p was generated and grown on nematode growth medium plates seeded with a solution of E. coli OP50 and 500 μm all-trans-retinal (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (26.Okazaki A. Sudo Y. Takagi S. Optical silencing of C. elegans cells with arch proton pump.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e35370Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The animals were maintained at 20 °C in the dark unless indicated otherwise. For observation of the GFP fluorescence and of the locomotion of C. elegans, we used the apparatus and procedure for the analysis described previously (26.Okazaki A. Sudo Y. Takagi S. Optical silencing of C. elegans cells with arch proton pump.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e35370Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In short, the animals were observed under a fluorescence stereo microscope (SZX12) and were illuminated with a 100 W HBO mercury lamp through an excitation bandpass filter. In most experiments, the worms were used only once for a single series of illumination experiments with varying light intensities (0–1 milliwatt/mm2) and were then discarded unless otherwise indicated. The images were acquired with a digital CCD camera Cool SNAP HQ2 (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) using the PM Capture Pro software (Nippon Roper, Japan) and processed using the ImageJ public domain software. The intensity of 470-, 500-, and 550-nm light was measured at the object plane using an optical power meter (Model 3664, Hioki, Ueda, Japan) with an optical sensor (Model 9742, Hioki, Ueda, Japan). Various intensities of illumination were implemented by changing the magnification of the objective lens of the microscope. To calculate the intensity of illumination, we measured the radius of the illuminated area, calculated the area, and then divided the total light intensity by the area as described previously (26.Okazaki A. Sudo Y. Takagi S. Optical silencing of C. elegans cells with arch proton pump.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e35370Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In general, the worms swim well on the plate without light. The locomotion stopped completely and promptly upon photoirradiation. The stopped cells are defined as being “paralyzed” in this study. Panels a–d in Fig. 2 show the visible absorption spectra obtained for the WT and for various mutants of HwBR in which a single amino acid residue was replaced with Ala for Asp-123, Met-126, or Ser-149 or with Thr (or Asn) for Ala-223. To avoid denaturation, the spectra shown were measured immediately after purification. Their λmax values (main absorption) and retinal configurations obtained by HPLC analysis are listed in Table 1. The λmax of all of the mutants showed spectral blue shifts of 19 nm (646 cm−1) for D123A, 9 nm (300 cm−1) for M126A, 16 nm (541 cm−1) for S149A, 13 nm (437 cm−1) for A223T, and 4 nm (132 cm−1) for A223N, respectively. Furthermore, the retinal compositions of the mutants were investigated (Table 1). It is well known that one of the retinal conformations, the all-trans-isomer, is the functional form of all microbial rhodopsins studied so far. As shown in Table 1, all HwBR single mutants contain above 60% all-trans-retinal similar to WT HwBR (79%) as well as HsBR (66.4%) in n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside micelles, indicating that the mutants maintain functional proteins. To further characterize the effects of these residues, combination mutants of HwBR were constructed, and the absorption spectra and retinal compositions were measured (Fig. 2, e–j, and Table 1). All these multiple HwBR mutants contain above 53% all-trans-retinal with a minor proportion of other isomers, such as 13-cis, 11-cis, and 9-cis, similar to the single mutants, indicating that these mutants also maintain functional proteins. Panel j in Fig. 2 shows the absorption spectra of the most blue-shifted mutants, M126A/S149A/A223T, D123A/M126A/S149A/A223T, and D123A/M126A/S149A, where the λmax values are located at 498, 503, and 506 nm, respectively. These mutants have an orange color (Fig. 2j) and show a vibrational fine structure at ∼460 nm, which has also been seen in other blue-shifted microbial rhodopsins such as SRII absorbing light of ∼500 nm (27.Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Pharaonis phoborhodopsin binds to its cognate truncated transducer even in the presence of a detergent with a 1:1 stoichiometry.Photochem.

J. 1998; 75: 999-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The origin of this fine structure will be discussed later. The shift in absorption of the M126A/S149A/A223T mutant from that of the WT was 1964 cm−1, which corresponds to the difference observed between SRII and other microbial rhodopsins (BR, HR, and SRI) (∼2000 cm−1). Thus, we succeeded in the production of blue-shifted mutants of HwBR. It should also be noted that light-dark adaptation did not lead to an increase in the all-trans conformer, which was observed in the WT, except for the M126A, S149A, and A223T mutants (Table 1).TABLE 1Absorption maximum, opsin shift, and retinal configuration of the WT and of various HwBR mutants both in the dark and lightOpsin typeλmaxΔυAll-transDark-adaptedLight-adaptednmcm−1%WT (HwBR)55279 ± 290 ± 3D123A53364661 ± 260 ± 2M126A54330060 ± 475 ± 3S149A53654169 ± 276 ± 2A223N54813277 ± 281 ± 3A223T53943778 ± 296 ± 2D123A/M126A521107865 ± 358 ± 1D123A/S149A52689562 ± 369 ± 2D123A/A223T53557666 ± 270 ± 2M126A/S149A514133970 ± 271 ± 3M126A/A223T52593281 ± 273 ± 2S149A/A223T52496881 ± 277 ± 3D123A/S149A/A223T520111553 ± 148 ± 2D123A/M126A/A223T521107871 ± 256 ± 1D123A/M126A/S149A506164765 ± 258 ± 1M126A/S149A/A223T498196473 ± 266 ± 2D123A/M126A/S149A/A223T503176576 ± 172 ± 2 Open table in a new tab In contrast with fluorescent and luminescent proteins, color conversion is not sufficient for rhodopsins to work as optogenetic tools, but their function must also be maintained.

https://openalex.org/W2028188899,"Precise regulation of neurite growth and differentiation determines accurate formation of synaptic connections, whose disruptions are frequently associated with neurological disorders. Dedicator of cytokinesis 4 (Dock4), an atypical guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1, is found to be associated with neuropsychiatric diseases, including autism and schizophrenia. Nonetheless, the neuronal function of Dock4 is only beginning to be understood. Using mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a) cells as a model, this study identifies that Dock4 is critical for neurite differentiation and extension. This regulation is through activation of Rac1 and modulation of the dynamics of actin-enriched protrusions on the neurites. In cultured hippocampal neurons, Dock4 regulates the establishment of the axon-dendrite polarity and the arborization of dendrites, two critical processes during neural differentiation. Importantly, a microdeletion Dock4 mutant linked to autism and dyslexia that lacks the GEF domain leads to defective neurite outgrowth and neuronal polarization. Further analysis reveals that the SH3 domain-mediated interaction of Dock4 is required for its activity toward neurite differentiation, whereas its proline-rich C terminus is not essential for this regulation. Together, our findings reveal an important role of Dock4 for neurite differentiation during early neuronal development."
https://openalex.org/W2059639333,"The fungus Candida glabrata is an important and increasingly common pathogen of humans, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Despite this, little is known about the attributes that allow this organism to cause disease or its interaction with the host immune system. However, in common with other fungi, the cell wall of C. glabrata is the initial point of contact between the host and pathogen, and as such, it is likely to play an important role in mediating interactions and hence virulence. Here, we show both through genetic complementation and polysaccharide structural analyses that C. glabrata ANP1, MNN2, and MNN11 encode functional orthologues of the respective Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannosyltransferases. Furthermore, we show that deletion of the C. glabrata Anp1, Mnn2, and Mnn11 mannosyltransferases directly affects the structure of the fungal N-linked mannan, in line with their predicted functions, and this has implications for cell wall integrity and consequently virulence. C. glabrata anp1 and mnn2 mutants showed increased virulence, compared with wild-type (and mnn11) cells. This is in contrast to Candida albicans where inactivation of genes involved in mannan biosynthesis has usually been linked to an attenuation of virulence. In the long term, a better understanding of the attributes that allow C. glabrata to cause disease will provide insights that can be adopted for the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic approaches."

Detailed studies in various model systems including prokaryotes and single-celled and multicellular eukaryotes have revealed common underlying principles in biomineralization, which include the utilization of intracellular vesicles and protein-based organic templates. The inorganic components of the biomineral are accumulated within the vesicles and then transformed into a bioinorganic precursor phase (1.Wilt F.H. Killian C.E. Hamilton P. Croker L.

Despite the importance of these intracellular organelles, hardly any information is available on the molecular composition of eukaryotic biomineralization vesicles and the mechanisms of their biogenesis. One of the best studied eukaryotic systems for biomineralization is the formation of SiO2 (silica)-based cell walls of diatoms, a large group of single-celled aquatic microorganisms (6.Kröger N.

The cell wall of each diatom species exhibits characteristic nano- and micropatterned features demonstrating that silica formation is genetically controlled. Diatom silica is produced from silicic acid that the cells take up from the environment through specific silicic acid transporter proteins (10.Hildebrand M. Wetherbee R.

The discovery of silica-forming proteins has enabled the study of the molecular mechanism of SDV biogenesis through analyses of the intracellular transport pathways of silica-forming proteins. All diatom silica-forming proteins known to date, silaffins, silacidins, and cingulins, are derived from precursor polypeptides containing N-terminal signal peptides for co-translational import into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (6.Kröger N.

Currently, no information is available regarding the post-translational amino acid modifications of cingulins. The activity of kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of silaffin- and silacidin-derived unphosphorylated model peptides has been discovered in membrane fractions containing ER and Golgi membranes (25.Sheppard V.

Esko J.D. Colley K.J. Cellular organization of glycosylation.in: Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Freeze H.H. Stanley P. Bertozzi C.R. Hart G.W. Etzler M.E. Essentials of Glycobiology. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2009: 37-61Google Scholar). Therefore, it is assumed that intracellular transport of silica-forming proteins to the SDV involves vesicular trafficking from the ER to the cis-Golgi followed by intra-Golgi transport and sorting into vesicles that bud from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and fuse with the SDV (see Fig. 1A). This scenario is analogous to intracellular transport of proteins to the lysosome in mammalian cells (27.McVey Ward D. Shiflett S.L. Kaplan J. Lysosome biogenesis and dynamics.in: Mullins C. The Biogenesis of Cellular Organelles. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2005: 111-126Crossref Google Scholar) and to the lytic vacuole in yeast (28.Graham T.R. Nothwehr S.F. Protein transport to the yeast vacuole.in: Dalbey R.E. von Heijne G. Protein Targeting, Transport and Translocation. Academic Press, London2002: 322-357Crossref Google Scholar). In these well studied examples, specific receptor proteins, which bind only to proteins that are destined for transport to the lysosome/vacuole (“cargo proteins”), are located in the TGN. The receptor-cargo complex is then incorporated into TGN-derived vesicles that fuse with the vacuole/lysosome rather than the plasma membrane or any other intracellular organelle. The specificity of cargo-receptor interaction is crucial for correct targeting and requires the presence of a specific peptide sequence for vacuolar targeting and a specific amino acid modification (mannose 6-phosphate) for lysosomal targeting (29.Griffiths G. Hoflack B. Simons K. Mellman I. Kornfeld S. The mannose-6-phosphate receptor and the biogenesis of lysosomes.Cell. 1988; 52: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the delivery of proteins to the SDV requires a specific targeting motif for interaction with yet unknown receptor proteins that mediate vesicular transport to the SDV. Therefore, in the present study, we have investigated by in vivo fluorescence microscopy and subcellular membrane fractionation whether silaffins contain such a targeting motif. T. pseudonana (Hustedt) Hasle et Heimdal clone CCMP1335 was grown in an enriched artificial seawater medium (ESAW) according to the North East Pacific Culture Collection protocol (Canadian Center for the Culture of Microorganisms (CCCM) ESAW Recipe) at 18 °C under constant light at 5,000–10,000 lux. ESAW contains 0.55 mm NaNO3 as the sole nitrogen source (nitrate medium). Where indicated, nitrate was replaced by 0.55 mm NH4Cl (ammonium medium).

The enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene was amplified by PCR using the sense oligonucleotide 5′-GAT GGT GAG CAA GGG CGA GG-3′ and the antisense oligonucleotide 5′-CCC TTG TAC AGC TCG TCC ATG C-3′ and then introduced blunt into the SmaI site of pTpfcp/Sil1. The resulting plasmid, pTpfcp/Sil1-GFPint, generated a GFP fusion protein where the GFP is located internal of the Sil1 after amino acid position 399.

The gene construction procedures are described in the supplemental text (see supplemental Tables S1, S2 and S3 for Sil3-derived gene segments and oligonucleotide sequences). Genes were incorporated into the pTpfcp/ctGFP vector (25.Sheppard V. Poulsen N. Kröger N.

To determine whether the resulting GFP fusion proteins were incorporated into the biosilica, cells were extracted at 55 °C for 1 h with a buffer containing 1% (w/v) SDS, 0.1 m EDTA (pH 8.0), and 1 mm PMSF. The extracted cell walls were then washed by centrifugation and resuspension three times with water, once with acetone, and again three times with water. Confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging was performed using an inverted Zeiss laser scanning microscope LSM 510 (Jena, Germany). GFP fluorescence (Argon laser, 488 nm) was detected using a 505/550-nm bandpass filter. For dual imaging, chloroplast autofluorescence (HeNe laser, 543 nm) was detected with a 585-nm long pass filter in the multitrack mode of the microscope. The imaging of transformants expressing GFP fusion proteins of Sil4 and PLCart and Sil3 (under control of nitrate reductase promoter) was performed using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal equipped an argon laser (488 nm) and a 32-channel GaAsP spectral detector (acquisition between 473 and 668 nm). The GFP signal was separated from chloroplast autofluorescence by linear spectral unmixing using Zen2010 software (Zeiss). Isolated biosilica was viewed using a Zeiss Axioplan 200 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a GFP long pass filter set (excitation, 450–490 nm, beam splitter FT 510 nm; emission, LP515, Zeiss). Preparation of subcellular membrane fractions from T. pseudonana strains expressing GFP fusion proteins of Sil3-derived segments T1 and T6 was performed according to a previously described method (25.Sheppard V. Poulsen N. Kröger N. Characterization of an endoplasmic reticulum-associated silaffin kinase from the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1166-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Western blots were performed in duplicate and probed with both an anti-eGFP antibody (Living Colors full-length A.v. antibody, Clontech) and anti-tpSTK1 antibodies (25.Sheppard V. Poulsen N. Kröger N. Characterization of an endoplasmic reticulum-associated silaffin kinase from the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1166-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The genome of the diatom T. pseudonana encodes four silaffins (denoted Sil1–4), which are embedded in the biosilica of the cell wall (22.Poulsen N. Kröger N. Silica morphogenesis by alternative processing of silaffins in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42993-42999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Silica embedding is likely a direct consequence of the mechanism of silica biogenesis because silaffins are believed to be part of a silica-forming organic matrix in the lumen of the SDV onto which silica becomes deposited. Subsequently, the organic matrix remains permanently trapped inside the silica after exocytosis and deposition on the cell surface (Fig. 1B). Previously, it has been demonstrated that expression of a Sil3-GFP fusion protein (GFP was fused to the C terminus of the silaffin) in T. pseudonana led to incorporation of the fusion protein into the cell wall (Fig. 2, B1 and B2) (31.Poulsen N. Berne C. Spain J. Kröger N. Silica immobilization of an enzyme through genetic engineering of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana.Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2007; 46: 1843-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was post-translationally modified, and like endogenous Sil3, could not be extracted from the biosilica by treatment with a hot solution of SDS (Fig. 2, B3) (31.Poulsen N. Berne C. Spain J. Kröger N. Silica immobilization of an enzyme through genetic engineering of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana.Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2007; 46: 1843-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This indicated that the GFP tag did not compromise processing, intracellular sorting, and the silica-forming activity of the silaffin domain. To investigate cell wall incorporation of the other silaffins, T. pseudonana expression vectors were constructed that encoded Sil1-GFP and Sil4-GFP fusion proteins (in both cases, GFP was fused to the C terminus of the silaffin). Expression of a GFP fusion protein of Sil2, which shares 91% amino acid sequence identity with Sil1, was not attempted as it was deemed redundant. The phenotype of transformant cells expressing Sil4-GFP resembled those of Sil3-GFP-expressing transformants with the GFP fusion protein being located in all parts of the cell wall. However, the localization of Sil4-GFP in girdle bands was substantially less pronounced than for Sil3-GFP (Fig. 2, B4 and B5). Treatment with a solution of SDS did not result in Sil4-GFP extraction from the cell walls, demonstrating its entrapment in the biosilica (Fig. 2, B6). None of the transformant clones carrying the Sil1-GFP encoding gene exhibited expression of the fusion protein when analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. We speculated that the C-terminal GFP tag may have become proteolytically removed during maturation of the silaffin domain because the C-terminal region of Sil1 contains an RXL tripeptide motif (RPL: amino acids 453–455), which is a recognition site for proteolytic cleavage in some diatom cell wall proteins (6.Kröger N. Poulsen N. Diatoms—From cell wall biogenesis to nanotechnology.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 83-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 18.Scheffel A. Poulsen N. Shian S. Kröger N. Nanopatterned protein microrings from a diatom that direct silica morphogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 3175-3180Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, a new fusion gene was constructed, Sil1-GFPint, in which GFP was positioned upstream of the RXL motif. Introduction of the Sil1-GFPint encoding gene into T. pseudonana yielded GFP fluorescent transformant clones. The fusion protein was located in the two subsections of the cell wall, termed valves, and absent from all other regions of the cell wall (Fig. 2, B7 and B8). Treatment with a solution of SDS did not extract the GFP fluorescence from the biosilica, demonstrating biosilica entrapment of the fusion protein (Fig. 2, B9). To date there is no direct information available about the intracellular transport pathway of silaffins. To investigate whether silaffins become incorporated into the biosilica via an SDV-dependent pathway as depicted in Fig. 1, the location of newly expressed Sil3-GFP during the cell division cycle was analyzed. This experiment required generating a T. pseudonana strain that carried the Sil3-GFP fusion gene under control of the nitrate reductase promoter, Pnr. This promoter prevents gene expression when ammonium ions are present in the growth medium and induces gene expression when cells are transferred into medium containing nitrate (30.Poulsen N. Chesley P.M. Kröger N. Molecular genetic manipulation of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana (Bacillariophyceae).J. Phycol. 2006; 42: 1059-1065Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). As expected, cells harboring the Pnr-Sil3-GFP gene exhibited biosilica-associated GFP fluorescence only when grown in nitrate-containing medium and did not express Sil3-GFP in ammonium-containing medium (Fig. 3, A1 and A2). To investigate the fate of newly formed Sil3-GFP during silica biosynthesis, cells harboring the Pnr-Sil3-GFP gene were grown in ammonium medium thus lacking Sil3-GFP fluorescence. The cells were then transferred into silicic acid-free medium, which leads to an arrest predominantly in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 3B, Stage 1) (32.Frigeri L.G. Radabaugh T.R. Haynes P.A.

https://openalex.org/W2033624740,"Huntington disease is caused by cell death after the expansion of polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts longer than ∼40 repeats encoded by exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Prefoldin is a molecular chaperone composed of six subunits, PFD1-6, and prevents misfolding of newly synthesized nascent polypeptides. In this study, we found that knockdown of PFD2 and PFD5 disrupted prefoldin formation in HTT-expressing cells, resulting in accumulation of aggregates of a pathogenic form of HTT and in induction of cell death. Dead cells, however, did not contain inclusions of HTT, and analysis by a fluorescence correlation spectroscopy indicated that knockdown of PFD2 and PFD5 also increased the size of soluble oligomers of pathogenic HTT in cells. In vitro single molecule observation demonstrated that prefoldin suppressed HTT aggregation at the small oligomer (dimer to tetramer) stage. These results indicate that prefoldin inhibits elongation of large oligomers of pathogenic Htt, thereby inhibiting subsequent inclusion formation, and suggest that soluble oligomers of polyQ-expanded HTT are more toxic than are inclusion to cells."
https://openalex.org/W1973229609,"Toxins play a major role in the pathogenesis of Bacillus anthracis by subverting the host defenses. However, besides toxins, B. anthracis expresses effector proteins, whose role in pathogenesis are yet to be investigated. Here we present that suppressor-of-variegation, enhancer-of-zeste, trithorax protein from B. anthracis (BaSET) methylates human histone H1, resulting in repression of NF-κB functions. Notably, BaSET is secreted and undergoes nuclear translocation to enhance H1 methylation in B. anthracis-infected macrophages. Compared with wild type Sterne, delayed growth kinetics and altered septum formation were observed in the BaSET knock-out (BaΔSET) bacilli. Uncontrolled BaSET expression during complementation of the BaSET gene in BaΔSET partially restored growth during stationary phase but resulted in substantially shorter bacilli throughout the growth cycle. Importantly, in contrast to Sterne, the BaΔSET B. anthracis is avirulent in a lethal murine bacteremia model of infection. Collectively, BaSET is required for repression of host transcription as well as proper B. anthracis growth, making it a potentially unique virulence determinant."
https://openalex.org/W2169772650,"Despite high similarity in sequence and catalytic properties, the l-lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs) in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) display differences in their regulation that may arise from their adaptation to different habitats. We combined experimental and computational approaches to investigate the effects of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), phosphate (Pi), and ionic strength (NaCl concentration) on six LDHs from four LABs studied at pH 6 and pH 7. We found that 1) the extent of activation by FBP (Kact) differs. Lactobacillus plantarum LDH is not regulated by FBP, but the other LDHs are activated with increasing sensitivity in the following order: Enterococcus faecalis LDH2 ≤ Lactococcus lactis LDH2 < E. faecalis LDH1 < L. lactis LDH1 ≤ Streptococcus pyogenes LDH. This trend reflects the electrostatic properties in the allosteric binding site of the LDH enzymes. 2) For L. plantarum, S. pyogenes, and E. faecalis, the effects of Pi are distinguishable from the effect of changing ionic strength by adding NaCl. 3) Addition of Pi inhibits E. faecalis LDH2, whereas in the absence of FBP, Pi is an activator of S. pyogenes LDH, E. faecalis LDH1, and L. lactis LDH1 and LDH2 at pH 6. These effects can be interpreted by considering the computed binding affinities of Pi to the catalytic and allosteric binding sites of the enzymes modeled in protonation states corresponding to pH 6 and pH 7. Overall, the results show a subtle interplay among the effects of Pi, FBP, and pH that results in different regulatory effects on the LDHs of different LABs."

https://openalex.org/W2065437970,"A popular hypothesis for the action of metformin, the widely used anti-diabetes drug, is the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, specifically at complex I. This is consistent with metformin stimulation of glucose uptake by muscle and inhibition of gluconeogenesis by liver. Yet, mitochondrial inhibition is inconsistent with metformin stimulation of fatty acid oxidation in both tissues. In this study, we measured mitochondrial energy production in intact cells adapting an in vivo technique of phosphocreatine (PCr) formation following energy interruption (“PCr recovery”) to cell cultures. Metformin increased PCr recovery from either dinitrophenol (DNP) or azide in L6 cells. We found that metformin alone had no effect on cell viability as measured by total ATP concentration, trypan blue exclusion, or 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction. However, treatments with low concentrations of DNP or azide reversibly decreased ATP concentration. Metformin increased 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction during recovery from either agent.

In this study, we found that metformin as well as a known AMPD inhibitor increased the free AMP and ADP concentrations in these cells, but neither affected the ATP contents of the L6 muscle cells. To more directly determine how metformin affects the mitochondria in intact cells, we adapted an established in vivo method (18.Blei M.L. Conley K.E. Kushmerick M.J.

Rather, metformin increased mitochondrial energy formation, consistent with metformin stimulation of fatty acid oxidation, as well as more current findings on metformin inhibition of gluconeogenesis (20.He L.

L6 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and incubated and prepared as in our previous work (16.Ouyang J. Parakhia R.A. Ochs R.S. Metformin activates AMP kinase through inhibition of AMP deaminase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Dulbecco's minimum essential media, α-minimum essential medium, and amino acids were obtained from Invitrogen. Cell cultures and flasks were obtained from Corning Inc. (Corning, NY). Quantilium® recombinant luciferase was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Sodium azide and 2,4-dinitrophenol were obtained from Sigma. All the other chemicals, including luciferin, ATP, phosphocreatine, creatine, and MTT were obtained from VWR Scientific (Philadelphia, PA). After incubation with DNP or azide, cells were washed with 5% albumin solution and KH buffer prior to incubation in inhibitor-free incubation media (the recovery period). For the analysis of metabolites, media were removed, and cells were extracted with a lysis buffer containing 1% perchloric acid, 10 mm EDTA and 0.5% Triton X-100. After at least 20 min on ice, samples were neutralized with a solution containing 2 m KOH, 50 mm MOPS, and 2 mm EDTA. The luminometric measurement of ATP, PCr, and creatine and the calculation of free ADP and AMP values were performed by the method of Ronner et al. (22.Ronner P. Friel E. Czerniawski K. Fränkle S. Luminometric assays of ATP, phosphocreatine, and creatine for estimation of free ADP and free AMP.Anal. Biochem. 1999; 275: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Luminescence was measured with the Glomax Jr® luminometer (Promega). Lactate was measured by an enzymatic end point method using hydrazine (23.Ochs R.S. Harris R.A.

Biophys. 1978; 190: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Trypan blue (0.2% w/v) was added to cells in a 1:1 volume, and the percentage viable (excluding dye) was estimated with a hemocytometer. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) concentration in the incubation was 4 mg/ml; absorbance was recorded in an HTS bioassay plate reader at 590 nm. Protein was analyzed by the bicinchoninic acid method (24.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Measurement of protein using bicinchoninic acid.Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18581) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as an average ± S.E. with at least n = 3. Statistical evaluation was done using Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. To establish conditions for phosphocreatine recovery, we first investigated the ability of cells to recover from incubation with known energy inhibitors, the uncoupler DNP, and the respiratory chain inhibitor azide. Our procedure was to add the inhibitor, remove it through a change in medium, and then conduct a further incubation, called the recovery. Both low (0.1 mm) and high (5 mm) DNP caused a decrease in total cellular ATP concentration after an incubation of 15 min (Fig. 2A). To initiate the recovery, cells were washed with an albumin-containing medium (to assist removal of the uncoupler), and the second incubation (the recovery) was continued for a further 60 min. As shown in Fig. 2A, cellular ATP levels were depressed in the first incubation and returned to control levels with low but not high concentrations of DNP. We conducted the same experiment, except with a 30-min incubation period (Fig. 2B). Apart from a slightly greater drop in ATP concentrations in the presence of DNP (compared with the 15 min of incubation), ATP levels recovered only when low (0.1 mm) DNP was used. A similar result was obtained when azide was substituted for DNP (Fig. 3). Although ATP concentrations recovered from incubation with 4 mm azide, higher concentrations showed a sustained decrease in ATP levels after the recovery period. We tested cell viability using trypan blue exclusion under the same conditions used for the ATP measurements. As shown in Fig. 4, the low concentration of DNP did not affect trypan blue exclusion, despite the fact that this condition lowered ATP concentration (cf. FIGURE 4, FIGURE 2B). After the recovery period, only the high concentration of DNP caused a decrease in viability assessed by trypan blue (Fig. 4). A similar result was obtained for azide; the lower concentration of azide that caused a decrease in ATP (Fig. 3) did not show a decrease in cell viability as measured by trypan blue (Fig. 5). At a high concentration of azide (10 mm), cell viability was reduced in both the first incubation and after the recovery period (cf. FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). Thus, the experiments to this point established incubation times and concentrations for reversibly diminishing ATP levels with two types of mitochondrial energy perturbants. Because the cells remained viable as determined by trypan blue exclusion, the studies establish control conditions to explore the recovery period after this energy perturbation. The recovery of phosphocreatine from energy perturbation has been used as a measure of oxidative phosphorylation in muscle in vivo (18.Blei M.L. Conley K.E. Kushmerick M.J. Separate measures of ATP utilization and recovery in human skeletal muscle.J. Physiol. 1993; 465: 203-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 19.Haseler L.J. Hogan M.C. Richardson R.S. Skeletal muscle phosphocreatine recovery in exercise-trained humans is dependent on O2 availability.J. Appl. Physiol. 1999; 86: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). To establish this system for cell cultures, we measured the recovery of phosphocreatine concentrations using the conditions we established for reversible recovery from DNP and azide. The results for both DNP and azide are shown in Table 1. In the first incubation period, DNP lowered phosphocreatine levels compared with control in 15 min and was even further decreased at 30 min. A similar result was obtained with azide. Recovery from DNP was complete if the first incubation was carried out for 15 min and was partial if the first incubation was carried out for 30 min. The pattern was similar for azide, although in this case, even after 15 min of a first incubation with azide, phosphocreatine recovery was not complete; it was less so if the first incubation was conducted for 30 min.TABLE 1Phosphocreatine recovery from DNP and azideConditionControlDNPControlAzideμmol/mg proteinμmol/mg proteinFirst Inc, 15 min13.3 ± 0.69.77 ± 0.43ap < 0.05 versus control for DNP or azide.12.3 ± 0.69.08 ± 0.31ap < 0.05 versus control for DNP or azide.First Inc, 30 min13.4 ± 0.98.63 ± 0.58ap < 0.05 versus control for DNP or azide.12.3 ± 0.58.16 ± 0.50ap < 0.05 versus control for DNP or azide.Recovery (from 15 min)13.6 ± 0.512.2 ± 0.313.7 ± 0.911.3 ± 0.6ap < 0.05 versus control for DNP or azide.Recovery (from 30 min)13.2 ± 0.910.7 ± 0.7ap < 0.05 versus control for DNP or azide.12.9 ± 0.610.1 ± 0.3ap < 0.05 versus control for DNP or azide.a p < 0.05 versus control for DNP or azide. Open table in a new tab With conditions established to measure mitochondrial function by PCr recovery, we examined the influence of metformin at concentrations from 5 to 80 mm. Metformin stimulated PCr recovery when present at concentrations between 10 and 20 mm both in the case of recovery from DNP (Fig. 6) and from azide (Fig. 7). Higher concentrations of metformin led to a decline in PCr recovery from the peak stimulation by metformin (FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7).FIGURE 7Effects of metformin concentration on PCr recovery from azide. Cells were incubated for 30 min with 0.1 mm azide and subsequently incubated a further 60 min after removal of azide (recovery). The 1st bar (C) represents control without azide in the second incubation period. All other incubations had azide alone (“Azide Cont,” single hatched bar) or with the additional presence of metformin (cross-hatched bars) at millimolar concentrations indicated in parentheses. *, p < 0.05 versus DNP control; #, p < 0.05 versus 20 mm metformin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A time course of the influence of metformin (15 mm) on PCr recovery is presented in Fig. 8. Both recovery from DNP (Fig. 8A) as well as recovery from azide (Fig. 8B) were stimulated over time by the presence of metformin. We did not observe a decrease in PCr recovery by metformin at any time point examined. As a control for the results of Fig. 8, we also measured phosphocreatine levels in response to metformin without a prior incubation with inhibitor. As expected, these levels rose in keeping with establishment of the equilibrium at creatine phosphokinase. However, the response was distinct from PCr recovery; at 30 and 60 min the increase was 14 and 6.5%. Lactate was measured as an index of glycolysis during recovery from DNP or azide treatment. The results for DNP are shown in Fig. 9. Metformin alone increased lactate formation over time as has been well established previously (7.Bailey C.J. Biguanides and NIDDM.Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 755-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 16.Ouyang J. Parakhia R.A. Ochs R.S. Metformin activates AMP kinase through inhibition of AMP deaminase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with DNP itself led to an increased lactate formation over the 60-min recovery period. The further addition of metformin during the recovery period did not alter lactate concentration compared with DNP alone. The same experiment performed with azide did show a greater lactate formation when metformin was present during the recovery period (Fig. 10).FIGURE 10Effect of metformin on the time course of lactate formation during recovery from azide. After 30 min of incubation with 4 mm azide, lactate was measured at 20, 40, and 60 min. Data shown are from the recovery period; when added, metformin was only present during the recovery period.

Thus, an increased rate of reduction (absorbance) is commonly taken as an increase in cellular viability. As shown in Fig. 11, metformin alone did not affect MTT reduction during the incubation or the recovery period. DNP or azide alone depressed MTT reduction during the incubation period, but MTT reduction returned to control levels during the recovery period (when the inhibitors were removed). When metformin was present during recovery from either azide or DNP, MTT reduction increased significantly beyond the control levels. This effect was quantitatively greater during recovery from DNP than with azide. Because direct measurements of cellular ADP and AMP contents do not reflect the small fraction of free, metabolically available concentrations of these nucleotides, we used indicator reactions to estimate their free concentrations. The near-equilibrium properties of creatine phosphokinase and adenylate kinase in muscle cells permit these measurements (29.Wiseman R.W. Kushmerick M.J.

Using this technique, we found that both metformin and the AMP deaminase inhibitor EHNA increased ADP modestly and AMP substantially (Table 2).

Chem. 2006; 13: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because metformin acts to increase energy provision by cells through the activation of AMPK, these observations would be consistent with the idea that metformin might block mitochondria, lower ATP, and increase the concentration of ADP and subsequently that of AMP (the latter due to the near-equilibrium nature of adenylate kinase). ATP, ADP, and AMP are all allosteric effectors of AMPK, and the changes suggested would be in the right direction to activate it. The process of fatty acid oxidation is stimulated by metformin in both liver and muscle (10.Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N.

This is exemplified by photosynthetic carotenoids, which perform both light-harvesting and photoprotective roles essential to the photosynthetic process. However, despite a large number of scientific studies performed in this field, the mechanism(s) used to modulate the electronic properties of carotenoids remain elusive. We have chosen two specific cases, the two β-carotene molecules in photosystem II reaction centers and the two luteins in the major photosystem II light-harvesting complex, to investigate how such a tuning of their electronic structure may occur. Indeed, in each case, identical molecular species in the same protein are seen to exhibit different electronic properties (most notably, shifted absorption peaks). We assess which molecular parameters are responsible for this in vivo tuning process and attempt to assign it to specific molecular events imposed by their binding pockets."

We found that deficiency of XIAP expression resulted in a marked reduction in cyclin D1 expression. Consistently, cell cycle transition and anchorage-independent cell growth were also attenuated in XIAP-deficient cancer cells compared with those of the parental wild-type cells. Subsequent studies demonstrated that E3 ligase activity within the RING domain of XIAP is crucial for its ability to regulate cyclin D1 transcription, cell cycle transition, and anchorage-independent cell growth by up-regulating transactivation of c-Jun/AP-1. Moreover, we found that E3 ligase within RING domain was required for XIAP inhibition of phosphatase PP2A activity by up-regulation of PP2A phosphorylation at Tyr-307 in its catalytic subunit.

In this study, we use a variety of techniques to show that Rubisco activase forms a wide range of structures in solution, ranging from monomers to much higher order species, and that the distribution of these species is highly dependent on protein concentration. The data support a model in which Rubisco activase forms an open spiraling structure rather than a closed hexameric structure. At protein concentrations of 1 μM, corresponding to the maximal activity of the enzyme, Rubisco activase has an oligomeric state of 2-4 subunits. We propose a model in which Rubisco activase requires at least 1 neighboring subunit for hydrolysis of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1966433403,"MCM7 is one of the subunits of the MCM2–7 complex that plays a critical role in DNA replication initiation and cell proliferation of eukaryotic cells. After forming the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) with other components, the MCM2–7 complex is activated by DDK/cyclin-dependent kinase to initiate DNA replication. Each subunit of the MCM2–7 complex functions differently under regulation of various kinases on the specific site, which needs to be investigated in detail. In this study, we demonstrated that MCM7 is a substrate of cyclin E/Cdk2 and can be phosphorylated on Ser-121. We found that the distribution of MCM7-S121A is different from wild-type MCM7 and that the MCM7-S121A mutant is much less efficient to form a pre-RC complex with MCM3/MCM5/cdc45 compared with wild-type MCM7. By using the Tet-On inducible HeLa cell line, we revealed that overexpression of wild-type MCM7 but not MCM7-S121A can block S phase entry, suggesting that an excess of the pre-RC complex may activate the cell cycle checkpoint. Further analysis indicates that the Chk1 pathway is activated in MCM7-overexpressed cells in a p53-dependent manner.

In eukaryotes, chromosomal DNA replication is a precise event to maintain genome stability that needs to be duplicated only once in each cell cycle.

Then, the MCM2–7 complex is triggered into an active helicase at replication forks by concerted activity of cdc7/dbf4 (4Tsuji T. Ficarro S.B. Jiang W.

When cells enter into S phase, the pre-RC is disassociated by high cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity, which will cause destruction of select pre-RC components and the inhibition of pre-RC rebinding onto chromatin and prevent DNA rereplication (5Tanaka S.

Therefore, the substrates of each kinase complex are the key subjects to be investigated in detail for a comprehensive study of tight cell cycle regulation. The most important function of the MCM2–7 complex is to initiate DNA replication through replicative helicase activity at replication forks (7Maiorano D. Lutzmann M. Méchali M. MCM proteins and DNA replication.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, each MCM component functions differently in cell cycle regulation. It has been reported that only the subassembly of the MCM4/6/7 double-trimeric complex possesses DNA helicase activity, whereas MCM2/3/5 does not. The conserved ATPase motifs of MCM7 are essential for ATPase and DNA helicase activities of the MCM4/6/7 complex (8You Z. Ishimi Y. Masai H. Hanaoka F.

It has been elucidated that MCM3 phosphorylated by cyclin B/Cdk1 regulates MCM2–7 complex regulation (9Lin D.I. Aggarwal P. Diehl J.A. Phosphorylation of MCM3 on Ser-112 regulates its incorporation into the MCM2–7 complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8079-8084Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of MCM3 on Thr-722 will cause S phase checkpoint activation under regulation of cyclin E/Cdk2 (10Li J. Deng M. Wei Q. Liu T. Tong X. Ye X. Phosphorylation of MCM3 protein by cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) regulates its function in cell cycle.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 39776-39785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, there is more and more evidence to show that MCMs have other functions beyond DNA replication initiation (11Forsburg S.L. Eukaryotic MCM proteins. Beyond replication initiation.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 109-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Previous studies found that MCM2 and MCM3 can be phosphorylated directly by ataxia telangiectasia-mutated/ATR separately under genotoxic stress (12Cortez D. Glick G. Elledge S.J. Minichromosome maintenance proteins are direct targets of the ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). MCM5 was confirmed to load onto the centrosome in the association of cyclin E and regulate centrosome duplication (13Ferguson R.L. Maller J.L. Cyclin E-dependent localization of MCM5 regulates centrosome duplication.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3224-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It was also found that MCM7 participates in mRNA transcription and DNA damage regulation (12Cortez D. Glick G. Elledge S.J. Minichromosome maintenance proteins are direct targets of the ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Interaction between human MCM7 and Rad17 proteins is required for replication checkpoint signaling.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4660-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that MCM7 is a typical marker of various types of cancer and is a potential therapeutic target in human cancers (16Liu Y.Z. Jiang Y.Y. Hao J.J. Lu S.S. Zhang T.T. Shang L.

We previously identified MCM7 as one of the Cdk2-associated proteins by tandem affinity-tagged purification (19Deng M. Li F. Ballif B.A. Li S. Chen X. Guo L. Ye X. Identification and functional analysis of a novel cyclin e/cdk2 substrate ankrd17.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7875-7888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrated that MCM7 is the substrate of cyclin E/Cdk2 that phosphorylates MCM7 at Ser-121 and regulates its distribution in cells. We also found that an excess of MCM7 but not MCM7-S121A blocks S phase progression. Further analysis indicated that an excess of MCM7 can activate the Chk1-p53 checkpoint pathway through ssDNA accumulation in a p53-dependent manner. In addition, we found that MCM7 could also be phosphorylated by cyclin B/Cdk1 on Ser-121, which is essential for mitotic exit. Collectively, phosphorylations of MCM7 by cyclin/Cdks plays an important role in S phase checkpoint activation as well as in the regulation of proper M phase progression. MCM7 cDNA was obtained by PCR from human embryonic kidney cDNA and cloned into pENTR-6 (a modified form of pENTR-4, Invitrogen) and then into pDEST-FLAG by Gateway® recombination cloning technology (Invitrogen). MCM7 and its mutants MCM7-S121A, MCM7-S197A, MCM7-S365A, and MCM-T690A were cloned into pCMV FLAG, pET41b, and pGEX6p-1, respectively. The MCM7 single RXL mutants ASA, ATA, and AEA and the triple mutant 3AXA were also cloned into pCMV FLAG. Full-length MCM7, Cdk2, and Cdk1 were cloned into pET41b and pET30a (Novagen). The mammalian expression vectors for myc-tagged cyclins and Cdks were generated as described previously (19Deng M. Li F. Ballif B.A. Li S. Chen X. Guo L. Ye X. Identification and functional analysis of a novel cyclin e/cdk2 substrate ankrd17.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7875-7888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibodies against human MCM7, MCM5, and MCM3 were generated by immunizing the rabbits with GST-MCM7 (amino acids 10–30), GST-MCM5 (amino acids 644–734), or GST-MCM3 (amino acids 490–807). FLAG antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma. Myc (9E10), His (H-3), MCM7 (141–2), cdc45 (H-300), PCNA (PC-10), Lamin B (M-20), Cdk2 (d-12), cdc6 (180.2), and β-actin (1–19) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phospho-Chk1 (Ser-345) antibody (2341S) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Phospho-Cdk2-Thr-14 antibody (EP2234Y) was purchased from Abcam. PRA70 antibody (04-1521) was purchased from Millipore. Phospho-MCM7-Ser-121 antibody was generated by immunizing the rabbits with synthesized phosphopeptide (GMVRpSPQNQYPAE). myc-tagged cyclin and Cdk together with FLAG-tagged MCM7 or its RXL mutants were coexpressed in 293T cells by transient transfection. The cell lysates were harvested and immunoprecipitated with myc or FLAG antibodies and subjected to immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. For the GST pull-down assay, 1 μg of GST-MCM7 or GST as a control was incubated with the cell lysates from 293T cells overexpressing myc-tagged cyclin and Cdk or with His-Cdk purified from BL21. Glutathione beads were then added and incubated for 2 h. The bound proteins were eluted with sample loading buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with myc or Cdk antibodies. For endogenous immunoprecipitation, 293T cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with Cdk antibody or normal mouse IgG as a control, followed by incubation with protein A beads. The bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with MCM7 antibody. HEK 293T, HeLa, and HCT116 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Human normal liver cells HL-7702 (Cell Resource Center, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal calf serum. For synchronization, cells were synchronized at G1/S phase by double thymidine treatment as described previously (10Li J. Deng M. Wei Q. Liu T. Tong X. Ye X. Phosphorylation of MCM3 protein by cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) regulates its function in cell cycle.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 39776-39785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In brief, HeLa cells were incubated for 16 h in complete medium with 2 mm thymidine, released for 8 h into fresh medium, and then incubated with 2 mm thymidine for 16 h. At this point, most of the cells were synchronized at G1/S transition. To obtain cells synchronized at mitosis, HeLa cells were incubated for 16 h in the presence of 2 mm thymidine, released for 6 h, and then treated with 100 ng/ml of nocodazole for 6 h. The mitotic cells were obtained by shaking off. Cells harvested from 3.5-cm dishes were washed with PBS and extracted with CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.5% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor tablet (Roche)) for 20 min on ice and then subjected to centrifugation at 3200 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected as a CSK-soluble fraction. The pellet was washed once with CSK buffer and then dissolved in SDS loading buffer as a CSK-insoluble fraction. GST-fused, full-length MCM7, MCM7-S121A, MCM7-S197A, MCM7-S365A, and MCM7-T690A and truncated forms of MCM7, GST-cyclin E/cyclin A, and GST-Cdk2 proteins were expressed in the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli and then purified by standard procedures. Cyclin B/Cdk1-activated complex was purchased from Millipore. For the in vitro kinase assay, 1 μg of GST-MCM7 protein with 1 μg of GST-cyclin E and Cdk2, GST-cyclin A, and Cdk2 or cyclinB1/Cdk1 was incubated in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.02% BSA, 0.04 mm ATP) in the presence of 0.5 μCi of [γ32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed to x-ray film. FLAG-tagged MCM7, MCM7-S121A, and MCM7-S121D were cloned into the HindIII-NotI sites of the pcDNATM/TO vector (Invitrogen) and transfected into T-RExTM-HeLa cells (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, cells were selected with 100 μg/ml zeocin and 5 μg/ml blasticidin for 3 weeks. Monoclones were picked, and expression of MCM7 was tested by immunoblotting in the presence of tetracycline for 24 h. The knockdown of MCM7 was achieved by transfection of HeLa cells with 50 nm siRNA for 72 h. Human MCM7 siRNA target sequences were as follows: #1, GGAGCAGAACATACAGCTA; #2, CTAGTAAGGATGCCACCTA; and #3, GCTCATGAGGCGTTACATA. The control siRNA sequence was obtained from the manufacturer (RiboBio). For DNA content analysis, cells were fixed in ice-cold 75% ethanol, washed with PBS/1% BSA, and stained with 20 μg/ml of propidium in PBS/1% BSA with 100 μg/ml of RNaseA. All samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences). The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was estimated with ModFit. We have previously identified a number of novel Cdk2-associated proteins by tandem affinity tag purification (19Deng M. Li F. Ballif B.A. Li S. Chen X. Guo L. Ye X. Identification and functional analysis of a novel cyclin e/cdk2 substrate ankrd17.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7875-7888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Among them, the MCM7 protein, considered to be a potential substrate that is a subunit of the MCM2–7 complex, functions as replicative DNA helicase in eukaryotes. First, we took the approach of immunoprecipitation to confirm the association between MCM7 and Cdk2. 293T cells were transfected with pCMV FLAG-MCM7 and pCMV myc-cyclin E or Cdk2. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitate with FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with myc antibody or vice versa. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, cyclin E and Cdk2 could interact with FLAG-MCM7. We then performed a GST pull-down assay. The data indicated that GST-MCM7 can interact with myc-cyclin E and myc-Cdk2 expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 1C). We then we examined whether endogenous MCM7 and Cdk2 were associated with each other. The cell lysates from 293T cells were immunoprecipitated with Cdk2 antibody and then immunoblotted with MCM7 and cyclin E antibodies. The data showed that MCM7 could interact with Cdk2 and cyclin E (Fig. 1D). These results confirm that MCM7 can interact with Cdk2 in vivo. To examine the direct interaction between MCM7 and Cdk2, GST-MCM7 and His-Cdk2 were purified for the GST pull-down assay. As shown in Fig. 1E, MCM7 can interact with Cdk2 directly. The RXL motif has been shown previously to be the essential cyclin binding motif in a wide range of cyclin/Cdk-interacting proteins (20Sørensen C.S. Lukas C. Kramer E.R. Peters J.M. Bartek J. Lukas J. A conserved cyclin-binding domain determines functional interplay between anaphase-promoting complex-Cdh1 and cyclin A-Cdk2 during cell cycle progression.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3692-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether the interaction between MCM7 and cyclin E/Cdk2 is dependent on the RXL motif of MCM7. There are three RXL motifs in MCM7 (Fig. 1F). To find out which one is critical for its binding with cyclin E/Cdk2, we generated a set of MCM7 AXA mutants in which RXL was mutated to AXA for a coimmunoprecipitation assay. Surprisingly, the data in Fig. 1F show that the mutation on neither the single RXL nor all of the RXLs of MCM7 affected the interaction between Cdk2 and MCM7, suggesting that MCM7 interacts with Cdk2 independently of the RXL motif. To examine whether MCM7 is the substrate of Cdk2, GST-MCM7, GST-cyclin E, GST-cyclin A, and GST-Cdk2 were prepared for an in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 2A, MCM7 can be phosphorylated by cyclin E/Cdk2 much stronger than by cyclin A/Cdk2. There are four serine/threonine at MCM7 (Ser-121, Ser-197, Ser-365, and Thr-690) that are potential phosphorylation sites for cyclin E/Cdk2 (Fig. 2B). To identify the phosphorylation site(s) of MCM7 by cyclin E/Cdk2, GST-MCM7-S121A, S197A, S365A, T690A, or 4A, in which all Ser/Thr were mutated to Ala, were generated for an in vitro kinase assay. The data showed that phosphorylation of MCM7-S121A and MCM7–4A has a certain reduction compared with wild-type MCM7 (Fig. 2C). To further confirm that MCM7 Ser-121 is the phosphorylation site by cyclin E/Cdk2, we generated the MCM7 (1–129) and MCM7 (1–129) S121A mutants and performed an in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 2D, the phosphorylation of MCM7 (1–129) S121A was obviously reduced compared with that of MCM7 (1–129), indicating that MCM7 Ser-121 was phosphorylated by cyclin E/Cdk2 in vitro. To confirm the phosphorylation of MCM7 on Ser-121 in vivo, we generated antibodies against phosphor-MCM7 Ser-121 by immunizing rabbit with a specific phosphopeptide. Then, 293T cells were cotransfected with pCMV FLAG-MCM7 or pCMV FLAG-MCM7-S121A together with myc-cyclin E/Cdk2 expression plasmids. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody followed by immunoblotting with MCM7-p-Ser121 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A, the phosphorylation of the MCM7-S121A mutant is reduced dramatically compared with that of wild-type MCM7, indicating that Ser-121 of MCM7 can be phosphorylated by cyclin E/Cdk2 in vivo. To further verify that cyclin E/Cdk2 is the main kinase to phosphorylate MCM7 at Ser-121, FLAG-MCM7 and constitutively active Cdk2 (Cdk2-AF) or dominant negative Cdk2 (Cdk2-DN) were coexpressed in 293T cells. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with MCM7-p-Ser121 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B, MCM7-p-Ser-121 is detected in Cdk2-AF- but not Cdk2-DN-coexpressed cells, indicating that MCM7 Ser-121 is phosphorylated by Cdk2 in vivo. To further assure the phosphorylation of MCM7 on Ser-121 by cyclin/Cdk in vivo, we treated the cells with roscovitine or flavopiridol as Cdk inhibitors or BI2536 as Plk1 inhibitor and then analyzed the status of MCM7 phosphorylation on Ser-121. As shown in Fig. 3C, the phosphorylation of MCM7 on Ser-121 was abolished completely in roscovitine- or flavopiridol-treated cells but was not changed in BI2536-treated cells. To detect the phosphorylation of endogenous MCM7, we transfected 293T cells with constitutively active Cdk2 (Cdk2 AF) or dominant negative Cdk2 (Cdk2 DN) together with cyclin E. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with MCM7 antibody and immunoblotted with MCM7-p-Ser-121 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3D, the phosphorylation of endogenous MCM7 on Ser-121 is much higher in cyclin E/Cdk2 AF-overexpressed cells than in control and cyclin E/Cdk2 DN-overexpressed cells, which indicates that MCM7 could be phosphorylated on Ser-121 in vivo. Taken together, these data suggest that MCM7 Ser-121 is the specific phosphorylation site of cyclin/Cdks. Before DNA replication was initiated, the MCM complex was loaded onto chromatin during late M and G1 phase and then disassociated from chromatin when cells entered S phase. We wondered whether phosphorylation of MCM7 would affect its loading onto chromatin. 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged MCM7, MCM7-S121A, or MCM7-S365A expression plasmids, respectively. The cells were then treated with CSK lysis buffer. The amount of MCM7 in total cell lysates and CSK-soluble and CSK-insoluble fractions was analyzed by immunoblotting with FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, there is a significant reduction in the CSK-soluble fraction but more in the CSK-insoluble fraction of MCM7-S121A compared with that of MCM7 and MCM7-S365A. This result suggests that the phosphorylation of MCM7 at Ser-121 regulates its loading onto chromatin. During M to G1 phase, MCM2–7 forms as a complex and functions as DNA helicase at G1/S phase to initiate DNA replication (7Maiorano D. Lutzmann M. Méchali M. MCM proteins and DNA replication.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether the phosphorylation of MCM7 at Ser-121 affected the formation of the MCM2–7 complex. To address this question, we transfected 293T cells with FLAG-MCM7 or its mutants expression plasmids. Then the cell lysates were harvested for an immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 4B, the association of MCM7-S121A with MCM3 and MCM5 was reduced significantly compared with that of WT MCM7. Then we generated Tet-On inducible HeLa cell lines for expressing MCM7, MCM7-S121A, and the phosphormimic mutant MCM7 S121D and performed a similar experiment. Consistently, MCM7-S121A was less efficient when binding with MCM3 and MCM5, whereas MCM7 S121D could partially rescue the phenotype (Fig. 4C). We also found that MCM7-S121A was deficient in binding with cdc45, which was loaded onto chromatin after the MCM2–7 complex formed (Fig. 4C). We then transfected 293T cells with pCMV FLAG-MCM7 together with Cdk2 AF or Cdk2 DN. The cell lysates were harvested for immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with MCM3 and MCM5 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4D, FLAG-MCM7 can bind with MCM3 and MCM5 much better in Cdk2 AF-transfected cells than in Cdk2 DN-transfected cells. Collectively, these results suggest that phosphorylation of MCM7 at Ser-121 regulates its incorporation into the hexameric MCM2–7 complex. To further analyze whether phosphorylation of MCM7 at Ser-121 affected DNA replication, Tet-On-inducible HeLa cells expressing MCM7-WT or MCM7-S121A were generated and synchronized to the G1/S boundary by double thymidine treatment, released for 3 h, and then subjected to flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Fig. 5A, the percentage of cells that entered S phase in MCM7-overexpressed cells was much lower (nearly 15%) than that in the control cells or MCM7-S121A-overexpressed cells. We then performed similar experiment in HCT116 cells and also observed that overexpression of MCM7 but not MCM7-S121A inhibited S phase entry after double thymidine release (Fig. 5B). However, overexpression of MCM7 in HCT116 p53−/− cells did not inhibit cell cycle progression and even promoted S phase entry in some degree (Fig. 5C), which suggests that overexpression of MCM7 inhibits S phase entry in a p53-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the immunoblotting data in Fig. 5D show that Ser-121 phosphorylation of MCM7 was detected in MCM7-WT-overexpressed cells. It has been reported that knockdown of MCM7 does not block S phase entry, suggesting that only a small fraction of MCM7 is enough to form a pre-RC complex with other subunits to initiate DNA replication (21Ibarra A. Schwob E. Méndez J. Excess MCM proteins protect human cells from replicative stress by licensing backup origins of replication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8956-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Consistently, our data shown in supplemental Fig. S1 also confirms that knockdown of MCM7 in HeLa cells by siRNA does not affect S phase progression. Therefore, we propose that the excess of MCM7 may activate the checkpoint pathway to prevent S phase entry. Therefore, we examined the level of active Chk1 in MCM7-overexpressed cells. As shown in Fig. 5E, the level of Chk1-p-Ser-345 and Cdk2-p-Thr-14 were increased greatly in MCM7-WT-overexpressed cells compared with control and MCM7-S121A-overexpressed cells, which indicates that the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated/ATR-Chk1-Cdk checkpoint pathway was activated. We also observed that chromatin-bound RPA70 as an ssDNA accumulation marker was obviously increased in MCM7-WT-overexpressed cells compared with control or MCM7-S121A cells (Fig. 5F). However, the increase of Chk1-p-S345 was not detected in MCM7-WT-overexpressed HCT116 p53−/− cells (data not shown). In the HeLa-6TR stable cell line, there were also moderate increases of p53 levels when excess of MCM7-WT was induced by tetracycline (Fig. 5E), which implied that the ATR-Chk1 pathway was activated in MCM7-overexpressed cells in a p53-dependent manner. To further understand the significance of MCM7 phosphorylation of MCM7 by cyclin E/Cdk2, we performed similar experiments with the human normal liver cell line HL-7702. The coimmunoprecipitation data and in vitro kinase assay indicate that endogenous MCM7 can interact with Cdk2 (Fig. 6A) and that the phosphorylation of MCM7 on Ser-121 by cyclin E/Cdk2 occurred (B) in HL-7702 cells. To examine whether phosphorylation of MCM7 at Ser-121 affects S phase entry, we transfected MCM7-WT, MCM7-Ser121A, or empty vector into HL-7702 cells. After being synchronized at G1/S with double thymidine treatment, cells were released for 3 h and harvested for immunoblotting or flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Fig. 6, C and D, MCM7 was phosphorylated at Ser-121, and the overexpression of MCM7-WT caused the increase of Chk1-p-Ser-345 and Cdk2-p-Thr-14, indicating that the checkpoint pathway was activated. The flow cytometry data show that overexpression of MCM7-WT causes a significant S phase block compared with that of MCM7-Ser121A or control cells, which is consistent with the results observed in HeLa and HCT116 cells. Because Cdk1 is highly homologous to Cdk2, we wondered whether MCM7 is also the substrate of cyclin B/Cdk1. Therefore, we performed an in vitro kinase assay to test this. As shown in Fig. 7A, the phosphorylation of MCM7-S121A is lower than that of MCM7-WT and other MCM7 SA/TA mutants. Furthermore, we found that MCM7 (1–129) can be phosphorylated by cyclin B/Cdk1, whereas the phosphorylation of MCM7 (1–129) S121A was greatly reduced compared with the wild type of MCM7 (Fig. 7B). These data indicate that cyclin B/Cdk1 can phosphorylate MCM7 at Ser-121. We then tried to detect the phosphorylation of MCM7 at M phase in vivo. As shown in Fig. 7C, phosphorylation of MCM7 on Ser-121 was detected in MCM7-overexpressed cells after being synchronized at M phase. Considering that inhibition of Plk1 by BI2536 did not affect the phosphorylation of MCM7 on Ser-121, whereas inhibition of Cdk activity by roscovitine and flavopiridol almost abolished the MCM7 phosphorylation on Ser-121 (Fig. 3C), cyclin B/Cdk1 should be the main kinase for the phosphorylation of MCM7 during M phase. It has been reported that the MCM2–7 complex loaded onto chromatin during mitotic exit and early G1 phase. To analyze whether phosphorylation of MCM7 on Ser-121 by Cdk1 in M phase affects M-to-G1 phase progression, Tet-On-inducible HeLa cells overexpressing MCM7-WT or MCM7-S121A were synchronized at M phase, released for different time periods, and subjected to flow cytometry analysis. Interestingly, we found that the percentage of cells that entered G1 phase in MCM7-S121A-overexpressed cells was significantly lower than that in control and MCM7-overexpressed cells (nearly 20%), whereas MCM7-overexpressed cells that progressed into G1 phase were a little quicker than control cells (Fig. 7D). Because the data shown in Fig. 4C indicate that MCM7-S121A is less efficient to form a complex with other MCM members, we propose that the phosphorylation of MCM7 at Ser-121 may play an important role in regulating the formation of MCM2–7 complexes for a proper mitotic exit to prepare for pre-RC formation in G1. We previously identified MCM7 as a new interacting protein of Cdk2 using tandem affinity purification. Here we demonstrated that MCM7 Ser-121 can be phosphorylated by cyclin E/Cdk2. MCM7 is a subunit of the putative replicative DNA helicase MCM2–7 complex. The MCM complex, at replication origins, is activated by the concerted actions of cyclin-dependent kinases and the cdc7/dbf4 protein kinase (DDK), which leads to initiation of DNA synthesis. It was found that phosphorylation of MCM3 by cyclin E/Cdk2 causes an S phase delay through checkpoint activation (10Li J. Deng M. Wei Q. Liu T. Tong X. Ye X. Phosphorylation of MCM3 protein by cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) regulates its function in cell cycle.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 39776-39785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that phosphorylation of MCM4 by cyclin A/Cdk2 inhibits DNA replication through loss of MCM4/6/7 helicase activity (22Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. Phosphorylation of Mcm4 at specific sites by cyclin-dependent kinase leads to loss of Mcm4,6,7 helicase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34428-34433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. You Z. Omori A. Kitagawa M.

These data make us speculate whether MCM7 phosphorylation by cyclin E/Cdk2 functions in origin firing and replication fork progression. As shown in this study, overexpression of MCM7-WT but not MCM7-S121A will cause an obviously S phase block. However, when overexpressed in HCT116 p53−/−, MCM7-WT did not inhibit S phase entry, which implied that MCM7 activated the p53-dependent checkpoint pathway. There were already some hints to imply that MCMs could function in the p53-dependent pathway during apoptosis and DNA damage regulation (24Abe S. Kurata M. Suzuki S. Yamamoto K. Aisaki K. Kanno J.

Cell Biochem. 2012; 363: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which could explain our findings, but the detailed mechanism needs to be elucidated in further studies. It was also reported that overexpression of cdt1 and cdc6, the essential part of pre-RC, will induce ataxia telangiectasia-mutated/ATR checkpoint activation in a p53-dependent pathway (26Vaziri C. Saxena S. Jeon Y. Lee C. Murata K. Machida Y. Wagle N. Hwang D.S. Dutta A. A p53-dependent checkpoint pathway prevents rereplication.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). We found that the levels of Chk1-p-Ser-345 and p53 increased significantly in MCM7-WT-overexpressed cells. It has been reported that accumulation of RPA70 on chromatin will cause ATR activation. Consistently, we found that chromatin-bound RPA70 increased 3- to 4-fold in MCM7-overexpressed cells, which implied that an excess of MCM7 may turn on the ssDNA checkpoint pathway. It has been reported that cells with a 90% reduction of MCM7 by using RNA interference display normal S phase progression, which is in agreement with the observation in our study, suggesting that the MCM2–7 complex is overabundant and may have other functions beyond replication initiation over the minimum amount compatible with cell survival in human cells. More and more evidence supports the idea that MCM7 plays important roles in cell cycle regulation beyond DNA replication initiation. It has been found that MCM7 could interact with Rad17 for replication checkpoint regulation when cells were undergoing DNA damage (15Tsao C.C. Geisen C. Abraham R.T. Interaction between human MCM7 and Rad17 proteins is required for replication checkpoint signaling.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4660-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It was also validated that MCM7 was a direct binding partner for the ATR-associated protein ATR-interacting protein and that partial depletion of MCM7 interfered with UV-induced Chk1 activation in U2OS cells (12Cortez D. Glick G. Elledge S.J. Minichromosome maintenance proteins are direct targets of the ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Regulation of DNA replication machinery by Mrc1 in fission yeast.Genetics. 2006; 174: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Previous reports also determined that the subassembly of the MCM4/6/7 double-trimeric complex possesses DNA helicase activity, and our findings suggest that MCM7-WT could form a proper complex with other MCM subunits, whereas MCM7-S121A is much less efficient, which implied that phosphorylation of MCM7 on Ser-121 may contribute to its helicase activity through binding with other pre-RC family members. Therefore, as MCM7 is in excess and phosphorylated by cyclin E/Cdk2 at G1/S transition, there will be more activated MCM complex on the chromatin that could recruit other pre-RC components to give rise to an improper accumulation of ssDNA. Consequently, it will activate the checkpoint pathway, which is in accordance with a previous report that the engagement of the ATR pathway occurs in response to ssDNA breaks, resulting in checkpoint activation designed to arrest cells for DNA repair. The MCM2–7 complex is loaded onto chromatin in late M phase and early G1 phase, but the regulation is not quite clear. It has been reported in the database that phosphorylation of MCM7 on Ser-365 peaks in M phase but with unknown function (Phosida), which implies that MCM7 could play an important role during mitotic exit. Meanwhile, it was determined that the loading of MCM onto chromatin started at 60 min after nocodazole release (19Deng M. Li F. Ballif B.A. Li S. Chen X. Guo L. Ye X. Identification and functional analysis of a novel cyclin e/cdk2 substrate ankrd17.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7875-7888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this report, we found that MCM7 Ser-121 is also phosphorylated by cyclin B/Cdk1. We then further examined whether the Ser-121 phosphorylation of MCM7 by cyclin B/Cdk1 could regulate M phase progression. Surprisingly, we found that MCM7-S121A-overexpressed cells are less deficient for normal mitotic exit compared with control or MCM7-WT-overexpressed cells. In accordance with our findings that MCM7-WT binds with other MCM subunits better than MCM7-S121A, we proposed that cyclin B1/Cdk1 phosphorylated MCM7 at Ser-121 to regulate the formation of the MCM2–7 complex to promote mitotic exit. In conclusion, we found that both cyclin E/Cdk2 and cyclin B/Cdk1 can phosphorylate MCM7 at Ser-121 to regulate cell cycle progression through either activating the S phase checkpoint pathway or controlling MCM2–7 complex formation for proper mitotic exit.

https://openalex.org/W2154979679,"A modified invertebrate glutamate-gated Cl(-) channel (GluCl αβ) was previously employed to allow pharmacologically induced silencing of electrical activity in CNS neurons upon exposure to the anthelmintic drug ivermectin (IVM). Usefulness of the previous receptor was limited by 1) the high concentration of IVM necessary to elicit a consistent silencing phenotype, raising concern about potential side effects, and 2) the variable extent of neuronal spike suppression, due to variations in the co-expression levels of the fluorescent protein-tagged α and β subunits. To address these issues, mutant receptors generated via rational protein engineering strategies were examined for improvement. Introduction of a gain-of-function mutation (L9'F) in the second transmembrane domain of the α subunit appears to facilitate β subunit incorporation and substantially increase heteromeric GluCl αβ sensitivity to IVM. Removal of an arginine-based endoplasmic reticulum retention motif (RSR mutated to AAA) from the intracellular loop of the β subunit further promotes heteromeric expression at the plasma membrane possibly by preventing endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of the β subunit rather than simply reducing endoplasmic reticulum retention. A monomeric XFP (mXFP) mutation that prevents fluorescent protein dimerization complements the mutant channel effects. Expression of the newly engineered GluCl opt α-mXFP L9'F + opt β-mXFP Y182F RSR_AAA receptor in dissociated neuronal cultures markedly increases conductance and reduces variability in spike suppression at 1 nm IVM. This receptor, named ""GluClv2.0,"" is an improved tool for IVM-induced silencing."

https://openalex.org/W1981878531,"Mature dolichol-linked oligosaccharides (mDLOs) needed for eukaryotic protein N-glycosylation are synthesized by a multistep pathway in which the biosynthetic lipid intermediate Man5GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol (M5-DLO) flips from the cytoplasmic to the luminal face of the endoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein Rft1 is intimately involved in mDLO biosynthesis. Yeast genetic analyses implicated Rft1 as the M5-DLO flippase, but because biochemical tests challenged this assignment, the function of Rft1 remains obscure. To understand the role of Rft1, we sought to analyze mDLO biosynthesis in vivo in the complete absence of the protein. Rft1 is essential for yeast viability, and no Rft1-null organisms are currently available. Here, we exploited Trypanosoma brucei (Tb), an early diverging eukaryote whose Rft1 homologue functions in yeast. We report that TbRft1-null procyclic trypanosomes grow nearly normally. They have normal steady-state levels of mDLO and significant N-glycosylation, indicating robust M5-DLO flippase activity. Remarkably, the mutant cells have 30-100-fold greater steady-state levels of M5-DLO than wild-type cells. All N-glycans in the TbRft1-null cells originate from mDLO indicating that the M5-DLO excess is not available for glycosylation. These results suggest that rather than facilitating M5-DLO flipping, Rft1 facilitates conversion of M5-DLO to mDLO by another mechanism, possibly by acting as an M5-DLO chaperone."
https://openalex.org/W2012795074,"Polymerization of fibrin, the primary structural protein of blood clots and thrombi, occurs through binding of knobs 'A' and 'B' in the central nodule of fibrin monomer to complementary holes 'a' and 'b' in the γ- and β-nodules, respectively, of another monomer. We characterized the A:a and B:b knob-hole interactions under varying solution conditions using molecular dynamics simulations of the structural models of fibrin(ogen) fragment D complexed with synthetic peptides GPRP (knob 'A' mimetic) and GHRP (knob 'B' mimetic). The strength of A:a and B:b knob-hole complexes was roughly equal, decreasing with pulling force; however, the dissociation kinetics were sensitive to variations in acidity (pH 5-7) and temperature (T = 25-37 °C). There were similar structural changes in holes 'a' and 'b' during forced dissociation of the knob-hole complexes: elongation of loop I, stretching of the interior region, and translocation of the moveable flap. The disruption of the knob-hole interactions was not an ""all-or-none"" transition as it occurred through distinct two-step or single step pathways with or without intermediate states. The knob-hole bonds were stronger, tighter, and more brittle at pH 7 than at pH 5. The B:b knob-hole bonds were weaker, looser, and more compliant than the A:a knob-hole bonds at pH 7 but stronger, tighter, and less compliant at pH 5. Surprisingly, the knob-hole bonds were stronger, not weaker, at elevated temperature (T = 37 °C) compared with T = 25 °C due to the helix-to-coil transition in loop I that helps stabilize the bonds. These results provide detailed qualitative and quantitative characteristics underlying the most significant non-covalent interactions involved in fibrin polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W2053043208,"The apical membrane of intestinal epithelia expresses intermediate conductance K(+) channel (KCNN4), which provides the driving force for Cl(-) secretion. However, its role in diarrhea and regulation by Epac1 is unknown. Previously we have established that Epac1 upon binding of cAMP activates a PKA-independent mechanism of Cl(-) secretion via stimulation of Rap2-phospholipase Cε-[Ca(2+)]i signaling. Here we report that Epac1 regulates surface expression of KCNN4c channel through its downstream Rap1A-RhoA-Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway for sustained Cl(-) secretion. Depletion of Epac1 protein and apical addition of TRAM-34, a specific KCNN4 inhibitor, significantly abolished cAMP-stimulated Cl(-) secretion and apical K(+) conductance (IK(ap)) in T84WT cells. The current-voltage relationship of basolaterally permeabilized monolayers treated with Epac1 agonist 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2'-O- methyladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate showed the presence of an inwardly rectifying and TRAM-34-sensitive K(+) channel in T84WT cells that was absent in Epac1KDT84 cells. Reconstructed confocal images in Epac1KDT84 cells revealed redistribution of KCNN4c proteins into subapical intracellular compartment, and a biotinylation assay showed ∼83% lower surface expression of KCNN4c proteins compared with T84WT cells. Further investigation revealed that an Epac1 agonist activates Rap1 to facilitate IK(ap). Both RhoA inhibitor (GGTI298) and ROCK inhibitor (H1152) significantly reduced cAMP agonist-stimulated IK(ap), whereas the latter additionally reduced colocalization of KCNN4c with the apical membrane marker wheat germ agglutinin in T84WT cells. In vivo mouse ileal loop experiments showed reduced fluid accumulation by TRAM-34, GGTI298, or H1152 when injected together with cholera toxin into the loop. We conclude that Rap1A-dependent signaling of Epac1 involving RhoA-ROCK is an important regulator of intestinal fluid transport via modulation of apical KCNN4c channels, a finding with potential therapeutic value in diarrheal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2055246845,"The mechanisms by which mutant connexins lead to disease are diverse, including those of connexin50 (CX50) encoded by the GJA8 gene. We investigated the cellular and functional behavior of CX50fs, a mutant CX50 that has a frameshift after amino acid 255 and causes recessive congenital cataracts. Cellular levels of CX50fs were much lower than those of wild type CX50 in stably transfected HeLa cells. Whereas CX50 localized at distinct gap junction plaques and supported extensive intercellular transfer of Neurobiotin, CX50fs gap junctions were rare, and their support of Neurobiotin transfer was reduced by >90%. After inhibition of new protein synthesis with cycloheximide, CX50fs disappeared much more rapidly than CX50, suggesting increased degradation of the mutant. Treatment of cells with epoxomicin (a proteasomal inhibitor) led to a dramatic increase in CX50fs levels and in the abundance of gap junctions. Epoxomicin treatment also rescued intercellular transfer of Neurobiotin to levels similar to those in cells expressing the wild type protein. Treatment with eeyarestatin I (an inhibitor of p97-dependent protein degradation) resulted in many abundant slowly migrating CX50 and CX50fs bands consistent with polyubiquitination of the proteins. These results demonstrate that the CX50fs mutant is rapidly degraded by endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation in mammalian cells. This accelerated degradation reduces the abundance of gap junctions and the extent of intercellular communication, potentially explaining the pathogenesis of cataracts linked to this mutant. The efficacy of epoxomicin in restoring function suggests that protease inhibition might have therapeutic value for this and other diseases caused by mutants with similar defects."
https://openalex.org/W2034469970,"Pin1 and Par14 are parvulin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases. Although numerous proteins have been identified as Pin1 substrates, the target proteins of Par14 remain largely unknown. Par14 expression levels are increased in the livers and embryonic fibroblasts of Pin1 KO mice, suggesting a compensatory relationship between the functions of Pin1 and Par14. In this study, the association of Par14 with insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) was demonstrated in HepG2 cells overexpressing both as well as endogenously in the mouse liver. The analysis using deletion-mutated Par14 and IRS-1 constructs revealed the N-terminal portion containing the basic domain of Par14 and the two relatively C-terminal portions of IRS-1 to be involved in these associations, in contrast to the WW domain of Pin1 and the SAIN domain of IRS-1. Par14 overexpression in HepG2 markedly enhanced insulin-induced IRS-1 phosphorylation and its downstream events, PI3K binding with IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylation. In contrast, treating HepG2 cells with Par14 siRNA suppressed these events.

Conclusion: Par14 exhibits an insulin-sensitizing effect. Significance: This is the first report showing the roles of Par14 in metabolism and signal transduction. Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases play a role in protein folding by catalyzing the cis/trans rotation around the Xaa-Pro peptide bonds in target proteins (1.Fischer G. Wittmann-Liebold B. Lang K.

The peptidylprolyl isomerase family consists of at least three subfamilies as follows: cyclophilins, FK506-binding proteins, and parvulins. Parvulin, a small prolyl isomerase, the activity of which is not inhibited by either cyclosporin A or FK506 (5.Wang X.J. Etzkorn F.A. Peptidyl-prolyl isomerase inhibitors.Biopolymers. 2006; 84: 125-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), consists of two isoforms in mammals, termed Pin1 and Par14 (Fig. 1A) (4.Lu K.P.

Pin1 and Par14 share a highly conserved isomerase domain in their C termini. The N-terminal WW domain of Pin1 is involved in the recognition of specific motifs containing phosphorylated Pro-directed Ser/Thr (Ser(P)/Thr-Pro), and numerous target proteins have been reported (8.Lu K.P. Zhou X.Z. The prolyl isomerase PIN1: a pivotal new twist in phosphorylation signalling and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 904-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal domain of Par14 is a basic domain having no homology with the WW domain of Pin1, which indicates the target proteins of Par14 differ from those of Pin1. In turn, Par14 reportedly binds to the AT-rich segments of DNA via its basic N terminus (9.Surmacz T.A. Bayer E. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. Bayer P. The N-terminal basic domain of human parvulin hPar14 is responsible for the entry to the nucleus and high-affinity DNA binding.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which suggests a role in the process of transcription initiation. Besides DNA binding, Par14 reportedly binds to preribosomal ribonucleoprotein particles (10.Fujiyama S. Yanagida M. Hayano T. Miura Y. Isobe T. Fujimori F. Uchida T. Takahashi N. Isolation and proteomic characterization of human parvulin-associating preribosomal ribonucleoprotein complexes.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23773-23780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and it is contained in the preribosomal ribonucleoprotein complexes with fibronectin, p160 (Myb binding), p58 cyclin-dependent kinase, and α- and β-tubulin (11.Takahashi N. Yanagida M. Fujiyama S. Hayano T. Isobe T. Proteomic snapshot analyses of preribosomal ribonucleoprotein complexes formed at various stages of ribosome biogenesis in yeast and mammalian cells.Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2003; 22: 287-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Not only the target proteins but also the physiological roles of Par14 have been poorly elucidated, compared with those of Pin1. However, because the expression levels of Par14 were reportedly up-regulated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) 3The abbreviations used are: MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; Pin1, peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase 1; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; FAS, fatty-acid synthase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; Glc-6-Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; CRE, cAMP-response element. from Pin1 KO mice, it appears that Par14 compensates for some functions of Pin1. Indeed, depletion of Par14 with siRNA inhibited growth of Pin1−/− MEFs, far more strongly than in control MEFs (12.Uchida T. Takamiya M. Takahashi M. Miyashita H. Ikeda H. Terada T. Matsuo Y. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Fujimori F. Hunter T. Pin1 and Par14 peptidyl-prolyl isomerase inhibitors block cell proliferation.Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, Par14 has been proposed to compensate, at least partially, for loss of Pin1-mediating roles in cell cycle regulation and chromatin remodeling. However, it is puzzling that no study has been conducted to date using Par14 KO mice, even though precise evaluation of the tissue-specific roles of Pin1 or Par14, individually, would require conditional KO mice of either or both of these isomerases. However, we reported that Pin1 expression is higher in the fed than in the fasted state, or it is elevated by high fat diet feeding. In addition, it was revealed that Pin1 associates with IRS-1, a major substrate of the insulin receptor. IRS-1 is phosphorylated via activation of the insulin receptor and recruits several signaling proteins, including PI 3-kinase into a multicomponent complex via interaction between their phosphotyrosine-containing motifs and the Src homology 2 domains of downstream signaling molecules (13.White M.F. Kahn C.R. The insulin signaling system.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase activation in response to the association with IRS-1 or IRS-2 is considered to play a critical role in insulin-induced glucose metabolism in muscle, fat, and liver tissues (14.Pessin J.E.

IRS proteins and the common path to diabetes.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Our previous study revealed Pin1 to increase the phosphorylation level of IRS-1 and thereby enhance insulin sensitivity and adipogenesis (18.Nakatsu Y. Sakoda H. Kushiyama A. Zhang J. Ono H.

Here, we present evidence that Par14 also plays a critical role as a positive regulator of insulin action, despite having a binding domain different from that of IRS-1. This is the first report, to our knowledge, showing the roles of Par14 in metabolism and signal transduction, and the fact that hepatic overexpression of Par14 exerted a marked normalizing effect on the hyperglycemia in diabetic mice raises the possibility that these two isoforms of parvulin might be promising target molecules for treating diabetes mellitus. We speculate that the functions of Par14 are not limited to insulin signaling, and they may well extend to numerous signal transduction molecules. We thus anticipate that this will be a promising research field. Anti-Par14 antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with the peptide GDLGWMTRGSMVGPFQEAAFALPVSGMDKPVFTDPPVKTKFGYHIIMVEGRK (amino acids 105–156 of human Par14). Anti-FLAG tag, anti-hemagglutinin (HA) tag, and anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma. The antibodies against IRS-1, IRS-2, Akt, phospho-Akt (Thr-308, Ser-473), actin, and phosphorylated tyrosine (4G10) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were obtained from GE Healthcare. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was purchased from Nissui (Tokyo, Japan). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Biowest. All other reagents were of analytical grade. HepG2 hepatoma cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. The myc-tobacco etch virus-FLAG (MEF) tag cassette was generated by DNA synthesis and inserted into cloning sites in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) yielding pcDNA3-MEF, as reported previously (19.Ichimura T.

All protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hiroshima University. To create the C-terminal HA-tagged Par14 construct, human Par14 cDNA-HA was inserted into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Then the coding portion of HA-tagged Par14 was isolated from pcDNA3-Par14-HA. The recombinant adenoviruses containing the cDNA coding for HA-tagged Par14 were then constructed. Similarly, recombinant adenoviruses expressing Par14, IRS-1 and IRS-2, and LacZ were generated, and the adenovirus encoding LacZ served as a control. Recombinant adenoviruses were used for adenoviral gene transfer into HepG2 cells and the livers of ob/ob mice as described previously (21.Ono H. Shimano H. Katagiri H. Yahagi N. Sakoda H. Onishi Y. Anai M. Ogihara T. Fujishiro M. Viana A.Y. Fukushima Y. Abe M. Shojima N. Kikuchi M. Yamada N. Oka Y. Asano T. Hepatic Akt activation induces marked hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and hypertriglyceridemia with sterol regulatory element-binding protein involvement.Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2905-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The HepG2 cells and mice were used for the experiments 48 and 96 h, respectively, after adenoviral transfection. For the immunoprecipitation experiments, HepG2 cells or mouse liver tissues were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 500 μm Na3VO4, 100 KIU/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 5 μg/ml pepstatin. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with the antibody and then for 1 h with 30 μl of protein A-and G-Sepharose beads. The anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel from Sigma (catalogue number A2220) was used for the immunoprecipitation of cellular extracts from cells transfected with a FLAG-tagged protein. The pellets were washed five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was carried out. In brief, 10 μg of protein lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in a transfer buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. The membranes were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with specific antibodies, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and subjected to immunoblotting using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescence System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). The results of several immunoblots were quantitatively analyzed using LAS-3000 mini (FujiFilm). The cDNAs encoding full-length human Par14 and five deletion mutants of Par14 (amino acids 1–29 (basic domain), 30–103 (peptidylprolyl isomerase domain), and 1–30, 1–50, and 1–75) were subcloned into a pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences), which was used to transform Escherichia coli BL21 (Promega). Transformed cells were grown to an A600 of 0.6 in LB medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and stimulated for 3 h with 1.0 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. GST fusion proteins were conjugated to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and used for GST pulldown experiments. HepG2 cells overexpressing IRS-1 by adenoviral transfer were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 500 μm Na3VO4, 100 KIU/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants (2 mg/ml protein concentration) were incubated with 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 1 h at 4 °C to remove nonspecifically bound proteins, then incubated with purified GST alone, GST-Par14, and GST-Par14 deletion mutant proteins for 1 h, and finally washed six times with lysis buffer. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, which was used for the SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. HepG2 cells were transfected with siRNAs using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). siRNAs were synthesized (Invitrogen) with the following sequences (sense strands): Par14 siRNA-1 (5′-GCCUUGCCUGUAAGUGGGAUGGAUA-3′) and Par14 siRNA-2 (5′-AAAGUCUGGGAUGAGAUUCAAUGAA-3′). Briefly, siRNA was mixed with RNAiMAX in Opti-MEM. Then the siRNA mixture was added to the medium of HepG2 cells in 24- or 6-well plates. After incubation for 48 h, the cells were stimulated with 100 nm insulin for the indicated times. RNAi adenovirus vectors for mouse Par14, 5′-ACAGTGCTGACAAGAAGTCT-3′, and for control LacZ were constructed with a BLOCK-iTTM U6 RNAi entry vector kit and a BLOCK-iTTM adenoviral RNAi expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each adenovirus was amplified in HEK293 cells and concentrated using an AdenopureTM adenovirus purification kit (Puresyn). Recombinant RNAi adenoviruses were injected into the Pin1 KO mice, and 96 h later, these mice were used for the experiments. Following an overnight fast, mice received an intraperitoneal injection of glucose or pyruvate (2 mg/g body weight). Blood glucose levels were determined at base line and over time as shown in the figures. Total RNAs from tissues were isolated using Sepasol reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). Template cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using Verso cDNA synthesis kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific K.K.). Quantitative real time-PCR was performed using a SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM (Perfect Real Time) (Takara, Japan) on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primers were designed as follows: mouse SREBP-1, tctgctttggaacctcatcc and gccaggttagaagcagcaag (209 bp); mouse ACC, gagaggggtcaagtccttcc and ctgctgccgtcataagacaa (199 bp); mouse FAS, ttgctggcactacagaatgc and aacagcctcagagcgacaat (199 bp); mouse PEPCK, agcctttggtcaacaactgg and tgccttcggggttagttatg (215 bp); mouse G6Pase, tcgtggctggagtcttgtca and ggctggcaaagggtgtagtg (170 bp). Results are expressed as means ± S.E., and significance was assessed using one-way analysis of variance, unless otherwise indicated. The structures of Par14 and Pin1 are shown in Fig. 1A. Par14 with the C-terminal HA tag, IRS-1, and LacZ were overexpressed by the indicated combinations in HepG2 cells, using adenoviral gene transfer, and the expressed IRS-1 and HA-tagged Par14 in the cell lysates were detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 1, B and C). HA-tagged Par14 was detected in the anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from the cell lysates expressing HA-tagged Par14 and IRS-1 but not from those expressing HA-tagged Par14 and LacZ (Fig. 1B). Similarly, IRS-1 was detected in the anti-HA immunoprecipitates from the cell lysates expressing HA-tagged Par14 and IRS-1 but not from those expressing IRS-1 and LacZ (Fig. 1C). In contrast, there was no detectable association between IRS-2 and Par14 (Fig. 1D). Then the cell lysates prepared from the mouse liver were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-IRS-1 antibody or control IgG. As shown in Fig. 1E, Par14 was detected in the anti-IRS-1 but not in the control IgG or the anti-IRS-2 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1, E and F), indicating an endogenous association between IRS-1 and PAR14. To examine the involvement of Ser/Thr phosphorylation in IRS-1 in the association with Par14, HepG2 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml okadaic acid for 1 h (Fig. 1G) or 100 nm insulin for 5 min (Fig. 1H), and the association between endogenous IRS-1 and Par14 was then examined. Treatment with okadaic acid reduced the mobility shift of IRS-1 on SDS-PAGE indicating increased phosphorylations of IRS-1, although the association between IRS-1 and Par14 was not significantly altered (Fig. 1G). Similarly, insulin treatment for 5 min had no significant effect on the amount of IRS-1 associated with PAR14 (Fig. 1H). These results raise the possibility that Par14 associates with IRS-1, although independently of the Ser/Thr phosphorylation in IRS-1. To identify the domain in Par14 involved in the association with IRS-1, a full-length or various deletion mutants of Par14 were bacterially produced as GST fusion proteins. These GST fusion proteins or GST alone conjugated with glutathione beads were incubated with the cell lysates of HepG2 cells overexpressing IRS-1 by adenoviral gene transfer. As shown in Fig. 1I, although GST full-length Par14 bound to IRS-1, the domain of GST-peptidylprolyl isomerases or GST-basic domain failed to bind. The experiments using further GST fusion proteins revealed amino acids 1–75, but not 1–50, of Par14 to be capable of binding to IRS-1 (Fig. 1J). Thus, the basic domain (amino acids 1–29) is not sufficient, although the basic domain plus the N-terminal half of the isomerase domain of Par14 is necessary for the association with IRS-1. Next, to identify the portion of IRS-1 associating with Par14, the cDNAs coding for seven deletion mutants of IRS-1 containing the C-terminal FLAG tag were generated as the first step and inserted into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Fig. 2A). HA-tagged Par14 and one of these seven deletion IRS-1 mutants with the C-terminal FLAG tag were co-overexpressed, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-HA tag antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, amino acids 553–713 (D-5) and amino acids 711–970 (D-6) of IRS-1 associated with Par14, as detected in the anti-HA immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2B). To determine further limited binding sites in IRS-1, smaller deletion mutants, i.e. D5-1, D5-2, D6-0, D6-1, D6-2, D6-3, and D6-4, consisting of ∼110 amino acids from the 553–970 segment of the IRS-1 protein, as well as the D-5 and D-6 portions, were generated (Fig. 2C), and their abilities to associate with Par14 were examined. As shown in Fig. 2D, D5-1, but not D5-2, bound to Par14, suggesting amino acids 553–601 to be critical for the association with IRS-1. As for the other sites examined, D6-1, D6-2, and D6-3 were capable of binding to Par14, raising the possibility that the amino acids spanning ∼770–860 of IRS-1 are involved in the association with IRS-1. To investigate the effect of Par14 on insulin signaling, Par14 or control LacZ was overexpressed in HepG2 cells, and the cells were stimulated with insulin for the indicated periods (Fig. 3). The expression levels of IRS-1, p85, and Akt were not changed by this PAR14 overexpression. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and the amount of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase associated with IRS-1 were shown to be increased by insulin stimulation, and the degrees of these insulin-induced increases were markedly higher in the Par14-overexpressing cells than in those overexpressing LacZ (Fig. 3, A–C). The phosphorylations of Ser-473 and Thr-308 in Akt, located downstream from PI 3-kinase activation, were also significantly enhanced by Par14 overexpression (Fig. 3, D–F). Then the effects of full-length PAR14 and its deletion mutants were investigated. The deletion mutants consisting of amino acids 1–75 or 35–131 failed to affect the insulin-induced IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylations (Fig. 3, G–J). Subsequently, to examine the effect of PAR14 on IRS-1 dephosphorylation, IRS-1 phosphorylation levels after insulin removal were investigated in HepG2 cells overexpressing LacZ or PAR14 (Fig. 3K). Insulin-induced IRS-1 phosphorylations were time-dependently reduced in both cell types, and quantitative analysis revealed no significant difference in the dephosphorylation velocity according to PAR14 overexpression. Thus, it is likely that PAR14 enhances IRS-1 phosphorylation but does not affect dephosphorylation. To examine the role of endogenously expressed Par14 in insulin signaling, HepG2 cells were treated with Par14 siRNA-1 or control siRNA. As shown in Fig. 4, A and D, endogenous Par14 was reduced by this siRNA treatment, although the expression levels of IRS-1, p85, and Akt showed no changes in response to PAR14 siRNA treatment. Insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, association of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with IRS-1, and phosphorylations of Ser-473 and Thr-308 in Akt were all significantly reduced in the cells treated with Par14 siRNA-1, as compared with control siRNA (Fig. 4, A–F). Essentially, the same results were obtained with Par14 siRNA-2 (Fig. 4, I–L), although the gene silencing effect of siRNA-2 was somewhat weaker than that of siRNA-1. In addition, the reduction in insulin-induced IRS-1 phosphorylation was more marked with treatment using both PAR14 and Pin1 siRNAs than with PAR14 siRNA alone (Fig. 4, K–N). The ob/ob mouse is a well established rodent model of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia due to a genetic abnormality of leptin. Par14 or control LacZ was overexpressed in the livers of ob/ob mice by adenoviral gene transfer (Fig. 5A). Hyperglycemia of ob/ob mice showed remarkable normalization with hepatic Par14 overexpression with reduced expressions of gluconeogenic genes such as PEPCK and G6Pase (Fig. 5, B and C). SREBP-1 and FAS mRNAs were increased by Par14 overexpression (Fig. 5, D and E), although the mRNA level of ACC was unaltered (Fig. 5F). To investigate the role of Par14 endogenously expressed in the liver, the adenovirus expressing Par14 shRNA was generated and then injected into Pin1 KO mice. As shown in Fig. 6A, treatment with this shRNA adenovirus reduced endogenous Par14 by ∼70–80%, as compared with the normal level, in Pin1 KO mouse livers (Fig. 6A). In the Par14 shRNA-treated mice, fasting glucose levels were not significantly changed (Fig. 6B), although glucose and pyruvate tolerance tests revealed significant sustained hyperglycemia after the injection of glucose or pyruvate, as compared with the control shRNA adenovirus treatment (Fig. 6, D and E). The hepatic mRNA levels of PEPCK and G6Pase were significantly higher in the livers treated with Par14 shRNA than in those treated with control shRNA (Fig. 6C). In addition, as expected, expressions of SREBP-1 and its target genes were down-regulated by shPar14 treatment (Fig. 6, F–H). These results suggest the physiological importance of Par14 in hepatic metabolism. Although many groups, including ours, have reported the functions of Pin1 (4.Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T.

https://openalex.org/W2060378313,"Focal adhesion turnover during cell migration is an integrated cyclic process requiring tight regulation of integrin function. Interaction of integrin with its ligand depends on its activation state, which is regulated by the direct recruitment of proteins onto the β integrin chain cytoplasmic domain. We previously reported that ICAP-1α, a specific cytoplasmic partner of β1A integrins, limits both talin and kindlin interaction with β1 integrin, thereby restraining focal adhesion assembly. Here we provide evidence that the calcium and calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase type II (CaMKII) is an important regulator of ICAP-1α for controlling focal adhesion dynamics. CaMKII directly phosphorylates ICAP-1α and disrupts an intramolecular interaction between the N- and the C-terminal domains of ICAP-1α, unmasking the PTB domain, thereby permitting ICAP-1α binding onto the β1 integrin tail. ICAP-1α direct interaction with the β1 integrin tail and the modulation of β1 integrin affinity state are required for down-regulating focal adhesion assembly. Our results point to a molecular mechanism for the phosphorylation-dependent control of ICAP-1α function by CaMKII, allowing the dynamic control of β1 integrin activation and cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2063737884,"Centralspindlin is a critical regulator of cytokinesis in animal cells. It is a tetramer consisting of ZEN-4/MKLP1, a kinesin-6 motor, and CYK-4/MgcRacGAP, a Rho GTPase-activating protein. At anaphase, centralspindlin localizes to a narrow region of antiparallel microtubule overlap and initiates central spindle assembly.

Conclusion: Central spindle assembly requires a binding event that modulates the structure of the kinesin ZEN-4. Significance: Structural changes in the centralspindlin complex contribute to cell division. Cytokinesis, the final event in the cell cycle, results in the generation of two identical daughter cells from a single parental cell. In animal cells, cytokinesis requires a structure called the central spindle (1Glotzer M. The 3Ms of central spindle assembly: microtubules, motors and MAPs.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Assembly of the central spindle occurs at anaphase onset, when a set of antiparallel, nonkinetochore microtubules become bundled at their overlapping plus ends by microtubule-associated proteins and kinesin family motor proteins (1Glotzer M. The 3Ms of central spindle assembly: microtubules, motors and MAPs.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Bundling of the antiparallel microtubules that comprise the central spindle requires centralspindlin, a heterotetrameric complex comprised of two proteins: a kinesin-6 family motor protein, ZEN-4/MKLP1, and a Rho GTPase-activating protein, CYK-4/MgcRacGAP (2Mishima M.

Centralspindlin specifically localizes to the narrow region of antiparallel microtubule overlap immediately following chromosome segregation at anaphase, where it initiates central spindle assembly (3Mishima M.

Intriguingly, bundling of microtubules in vitro requires the presence of both ZEN-4/MKLP1 and CYK-4/MgcRacGAP and their ability to bind with high affinity (14Pavicic-Kaltenbrunner V. Mishima M.

Similarly, the centralspindlin complex, but not the individual subunits alone, can support microtubule bundling and central spindle assembly in vivo (11Jantsch-Plunger V. Gönczy P. Romano A.

Caenorhabditis elegans ZEN-4 is comprised of an N-terminal motor domain, an atypically long neck linker region, a parallel coiled coil, and a C-terminal globular tail domain (Fig. 1A). C. elegans CYK-4 has a short, N-terminal region followed by a parallel coiled coil, a central C1 domain, and a C-terminal RhoGAP domain (Fig. 1B) (11Jantsch-Plunger V. Gönczy P. Romano A. Schnabel H.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1391-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). ZEN-4 and CYK-4 directly interact both in vitro and in vivo, forming a stoichiometric 2:2 tetramer (2Mishima M. Kaitna S. Glotzer M. Central spindle assembly and cytokinesis require a kinesin-like protein/RhoGAP complex with microtubule bundling activity.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 41-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The binding interface between the two subunits of centralspindlin is formed by the N-terminal region of CYK-4 and a region of ∼100 amino acids in ZEN-4 positioned between the motor domain and the coiled coil (2Mishima M. Kaitna S. Glotzer M. Central spindle assembly and cytokinesis require a kinesin-like protein/RhoGAP complex with microtubule bundling activity.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 41-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). The coiled coils of CYK-4 and ZEN-4 contribute to the high affinity interaction, although they do not interact directly as they can be substituted by alternate parallel coiled coils (14Pavicic-Kaltenbrunner V. Mishima M. Glotzer M. Cooperative assembly of CYK-4/MgcRacGAP and ZEN-4/MKLP1 to form the centralspindlin complex.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4992-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). ZEN-4 is a member of the kinesin family of motor proteins. Kinesin motors use the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to translocate along microtubules and execute a variety of intracellular functions. Kinesin-1, the most well characterized, prototypical kinesin, is a dimeric molecular motor that consists of an N-terminal catalytic domain, a short, unstructured neck linker region, a region that forms a parallel coiled coil, and a C-terminal globular tail domain (15Kozielski F. Sack S. Marx A. Thormählen M. Schönbrunn E. Biou V. Thompson A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. The crystal structure of dimeric kinesin and implications for microtubule-dependent motility.Cell. 1997; 91: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Kinesin-1 motility involves a hand-over-hand mechanism (16Asbury C.L. Fehr A.N. Block S.M.

Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Whittaker M. Pate E. Cooke R. Taylor E.W. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D.

Role of the kinesin neck linker and catalytic core in microtubule-based motility.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 157-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This region is highly conserved in most N-terminal kinesins, and it makes intramolecular interactions with highly conserved residues in the motor domain (23Wade R.H. Kozielski F. Structural links to kinesin directionality and movement.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The analogous region in ZEN-4 between the motor domain and the coiled coil is atypical compared with all other kinesins with N-terminal motor domains (2Mishima M. Kaitna S. Glotzer M. Central spindle assembly and cytokinesis require a kinesin-like protein/RhoGAP complex with microtubule bundling activity.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 41-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In contrast to the neck linker of kinesin-1, the corresponding region in ZEN-4 is ∼100 residues long, and its structure and function are unclear. The linker region appears to lack the highly conserved residues that make direct contacts with the motor core, yet the corresponding residues in the motor core appear conserved (2Mishima M. Kaitna S.

This region is predicted to be partially α-helical in diverse kinesin-6 family members, although it contains several proline-rich regions, and therefore it is unlikely to be entirely α-helical. For comparison, artificial extension of the neck linker of kinesin-1 alters the step-size and processivity of the motor and impairs its ability to couple the energy from ATP hydrolysis into forward steps (25Yildiz A. Tomishige M. Gennerich A. Vale R.D.

Importantly, CYK-4 binds ZEN-4 in the linker region, raising the possibility that CYK-4 binding may allosterically modify the structural and/or the biochemical properties of ZEN-4. Indeed, one attractive model is that the ZEN-4 linker is disordered unless bound by CYK-4. Although the myriad functions of centralspindlin have been defined genetically and the molecular composition of centralspindlin has been characterized biochemically (2Mishima M. Kaitna S. Glotzer M. Central spindle assembly and cytokinesis require a kinesin-like protein/RhoGAP complex with microtubule bundling activity.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 41-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), the mechanistic details of how centralspindlin bundles antiparallel microtubules are not adequately understood. Using continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) 3The abbreviations used are: CW-EPR, continuous wave EPR; CBD, chitin binding domain; DEER, double electron-electron resonance. and double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy methods, we demonstrate that CYK-4 binding results in a conformational change in the neck linker region of ZEN-4. These changes reduce the rate of microtubule gliding by ZEN-4, and they are likely important for antiparallel microtubule bundling in vivo. These structural changes place strong constraints on potential models for centralspindlin function in central spindle assembly. Secondary structure predictions were performed with PHYRE2 (26Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J. Protein structure prediction on the Web: a case study using the Phyre server.Nat.

For EPR spectroscopy, C. elegans ZEN-4m (residues 430–555, molecular mass 17 kDa) variants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3) RIL cells as N-terminal chitin binding domain (CBD) fusions. C. elegans CYK-4m (residues 1–120, molecular mass 14 kDa) was expressed in E. coli BL-21 (DE3) RIL cells as an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Both the ZEN-4m variants and CYK-4m were expressed at 25 °C for 4 h shaking at 275 rpm. Bacteria were lysed in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 1 mm EGTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml leupeptin/pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and containing 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme 30 min prior to sonication. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm at 4 °C for 25 min in a JA-20 Beckman rotor. For all experiments, with the exception of Fig. 1C, CYK-4 and ZEN-4 were prepared as follows. Chitin beads (ZEN-4) (New England BioLabs) or glutathione-Sepharose beads (CYK-4) (BioWorld) were preequilibrated in lysis buffer without PMSF and lysozyme, added to the cleared lysates, and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with mixing for binding. Following washes, ZEN-4 derivatives were incubated overnight at 4 °C with tobacco etch virus protease for removal of the N-terminal CBD tag, and the resulting proteins were spin-labeled for EPR or stored in aliquots at −80 °C. CYK-4m was eluted with buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione, cleaved with PreScission protease to remove the N-terminal GST tag, and further purified by Mono S cation exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare). The resulting protein was used immediately in experiments or stored in aliquots at −80 °C. In Fig. 1C, lysates expressing CBD-ZEN-4 and GST-CYK-4 were mixed and bound to chitin affinity resin, eluted with tobacco etch virus protease, bound to GST affinity resin, and eluted with PreScission protease. For microtubule gliding assays, ZEN-4 (1–585, molecular mass 68 kDa) was expressed as an N-terminal CBD fusion, with a C-terminal flexible linker and biotin-acceptor sequence (28Beckett D. Kovaleva E. Schatz P.J. A minimal peptide substrate in biotin holoenzyme synthetase-catalyzed biotinylation.Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Extraction and chromatography were performed as described for the ZEN-4m variants. Purified protein was stored in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 1 mm EGTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 250 mm NaCl, 25 μm ATP, 1 mm DTT, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin/pepstatin in aliquots at −80 °C. ZEN-4m derivatives were exchanged into EPR buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 1 mm EGTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) or FPLC Fast Desalting column (GE Healthcare). ZEN-4m variants were spin-labeled with (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl) methanethiosulfonate spin label (MTSL, Toronto Research Chemicals) for ∼2 h at 4 °C. Immediately following labeling, excess spin label was removed using PD-10 desalting columns or a Superdex-200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) and further purified by Mono Q anion exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare). To assemble centralspindlinm complexes, a 1.5–2-fold excess of CYK-4m was mixed with ZEN-4m and incubated for at least 4 h at 4 °C with mixing. The successful formation of stoichiometric complexes was verified by gel filtration using a Bio-Sil SEC 125 column (Bio-Rad), in which all the ZEN-4m was observed to shift to a larger molecular mass complex in the presence of CYK-4m. Dynamic light scattering confirmed that both ZEN-4m and purified centralspindlinm complex were homogeneous and that centralspindlinm was larger than ZEN-4m alone. Recombinant ZEN-4m variants with single, unique cysteine residues at sites close to the predicted coiled coil were incubated in EPR buffer, in the presence or absence of CYK-4 and 20 mm oxidized glutathione. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 40 min with mixing and analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. ZEN-4m and centralspindlinm derivatives were concentrated to >300 μm for EPR experiments using centrifugal concentrators (Millipore). Experiments were performed in EPR buffer: 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 1 mm EGTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. X-band CW-EPR spectroscopic measurements were performed at room temperature using a Bruker ELEXYS spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA) equipped with a loop-gap resonator and a gas-permeable TPX capillary with the following parameters: 9.8-GHz frequency, 2-mW incident microwave power, 100-kHz modulation frequency, 1-G modulation amplitude, 41-ms conversion time, and 41-ms time constant. DEER measurements were carried out using a Bruker ELEXYS E580 X-band pulsed spectrometer operating near 9.7 GHz equipped with a split-ring MS2 resonator at a temperature of 55 K. Spin-labeled ZEN-4m and centralspindlinm derivatives were transferred to quartz 1.1 × 1.6 × 100-mm capillaries and flash-frozen to 55 K in the resonator at an estimated concentration of >300 μm in EPR buffer. All measurements were performed using a constant-time version of the four-pulse DEER sequence π/2(vobs) - τ1 - π(vobs) - t′ - π(vpump) - (τ1+ τ2 - t′) - π(vobs) - τ2 - echo (29Pannier M. Veit S. Godt A. Jeschke G. Spiess H.W. Dead-time free measurement of dipole-dipole interactions between electron spins.J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 142: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), where time t′ is varied, using pulseSPEL program. The resonator was overcoupled to Q < 100–200, the pump frequency (vpump) was set to the center of the resonator dip and coincided with the maximum of the nitroxide EPR spectrum, while the observer frequency (vobs) was set to 65–70 MHz higher and coincided with the low field local maximum of the spectrum. The pulse lengths for π/2 and π were 16 ns and 32 ns, respectively, and the pump pulse length was 28–36 ns. In each case, the pump pulse and inversion pump lengths were optimized using nutation experiments. In all experiments, a τ1 of 200 ns was used. Data were typically recorded at steps of 12 ns. Accumulation times for the different datasets varied between 4 and 12 h. Data were processed and analyzed using the program DeerAnalysis2008 (30Jeschke G. Zimmermann H. Godt A. Isotope selection in distance measurements between nitroxides.J. Magn. Reson. 2006; 180: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A homogeneous three-dimensional background model was used to subtract intermolecular background from the raw data. The criterion for choosing background subtraction was the frequency-domain spectrum, where neither a positive spike nor an obvious hole is present in the center of the Pake pattern. Computation of the L-curve was performed to choose the optimal value for the Tikhonov regularization parameter, which corresponded to the corner of the L-curve. For microtubule gliding assays, recombinant ZEN-4(1–585) motors, biotinylated at the C terminus, alone or in complex with GST-CYK-4(1–120), were immobilized on a coverslip sequentially coated with biotin-BSA and NeutrAvidin (Molecular Probes). Microtubules were diluted into motility buffer containing 80 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 1 mm EGTA (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 6.25 mm glucose, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.5 mg/ml casein, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 5 μm paclitaxel (Sigma-Aldrich), 1× gloxy (31Yildiz A. Forkey J.N. McKinney S.A. Ha T. Goldman Y.E. Selvin P.R.

Images were acquired every 10 s for ∼10 min. To measure velocities as a function of motor density, flow chambers containing ZEN-4 alone were assayed. Subsequently, a 10-fold excess of GST-CYK-4m (or GST alone) in motility buffer was flowed into the chamber, and the sample was reassayed. Microtubule gliding velocities were quantified using the MTrackJ (32Meijering E. Dzyubachyk O. Smal I. Methods for cell and particle tracking.Methods Enzymol. 2012; 504: 183-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar) plugin for ImageJ (33Schneider C.A. Rasband W.S. Eliceiri K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (34949) Google Scholar). CD experiments were performed using an Aviv 202 CD spectrometer (Aviv Biomedical, Lakewood NJ) with a 0.1-cm path length. Spectra were collected from 190 to 260 nm at 25 °C at a protein concentration of 1–60 μm in EPR buffer. Data were fit using CONTINLL (34Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Estimation of globular protein secondary structure from circular dichroism.Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). We created a cysteine-less ZEN-4 construct, ZEN-4m, consisting of the neck linker, the minimal CYK-4 binding region, and the first 20 amino acids of the predicted coiled coil domain (amino acids 430–555, 17 kDa) (Fig. 1A). This mutant retained the ability to form a stoichiometric complex with cysteine-light CYK-4m (1–120, 14 kDa) comprising a coiled coil homodimer containing an N-terminal extension required for ZEN-4 binding (Fig. 1, B and C). Circular dichroism measurements indicate that ZEN-4m is ∼70% helical (data not shown). For clarity, we will refer to these truncation derivatives of ZEN-4 and CYK-4 as ZEN-4m and CYK-4m, and the complex as centralspindlinm (Fig. 1D) hereafter. ZEN-4m and centralspindlinm each migrates as a homogeneous species on a size exclusion column (data not shown). We first used a cross-linking approach to define more precisely the limits of the coiled coil region and to probe for potential conformational changes. For these experiments, we introduced single, unique cysteine residues at sites close to the predicted coiled coil in ZEN-4m (Fig. 1D). ZEN-4m derivatives containing single cysteine residues were assayed for disulfide bridge formation under oxidizing conditions followed by nonreducing gel electrophoresis to measure dimer formation in the presence and absence of CYK-4m. As a positive control, we assayed the cross-linking efficiency of cysteine 547, which is predicted to lie in the internal region of the parallel coiled coil region in ZEN-4 (position a or d) (14Pavicic-Kaltenbrunner V. Mishima M. Glotzer M. Cooperative assembly of CYK-4/MgcRacGAP and ZEN-4/MKLP1 to form the centralspindlin complex.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4992-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As seen previously with ZEN-4(1–555), a cysteine at this position allows efficient formation of cross-linked dimers, both in the presence and absence of CYK-4m (Fig. 2). If the coiled coil continued with a heptad repeat, 533 would be predicted to lie in the same register as cysteine 547 (a or d) and cross-link with high efficiency. However, only a small fraction of the molecules form dimers when a cysteine residue is placed at position 533. Neighboring cysteines at residues 530, 531, 532, and 534 did not show any cross-linking in either the bound or unbound states (Fig. 2 and data not shown). In addition to analyzing cross-linking efficiency at positions predicted to lie near the coiled coil, we also determined whether selected cysteines engineered at other residues throughout the neck linker region of ZEN-4m were sufficiently close in proximity (≤0.7 nm) (35Falke J.J. Dernburg A.F. Sternberg D.A. Zalkin N. Milligan D.L. Koshland D.E. Structure of a bacterial sensory receptor: a site-directed sulfhydryl study.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14850-14858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to cross-link efficiently in the presence and absence of CYK-4m. A fraction of ZEN-4m containing cysteines at 473 or 500 formed dimers with low efficiency in presence and absence of CYK-4m. We conclude from these data that the coiled coil domain in ZEN-4m likely begins at about residue 535 and that the coiled coil domain in ZEN-4m comprises ∼20 residues, which is consistent with the minimum number of residues"
https://openalex.org/W2069381751,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β plays crucial roles in embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis by eliciting various cellular responses in target cells. TGF-β signaling is principally mediated through receptor-activated Smad proteins, which regulate expression of target genes in cooperation with other DNA-binding transcription factors (Smad cofactors). In this study, we found that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Olig1 is a Smad cofactor involved in TGF-β-induced cell motility. Knockdown of Olig1 attenuated TGF-β-induced cell motility in chamber migration and wound healing assays. In contrast, Olig1 knockdown had no effect on bone morphogenetic protein-induced cell motility, TGF-β-induced cytostasis, or epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, we observed that cooperation of Smad2/3 with Olig1 is regulated by a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase, Pin1. TGF-β-induced cell motility, induction of Olig1-regulated genes, and physical interaction between Smad2/3 and Olig1 were all inhibited after knockdown of Pin1, indicating a novel mode of regulation of Smad signaling. We also found that Olig1 interacts with the L3 loop of Smad3. Using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the L3 loop of Smad3, we succeeded in selectively inhibiting TGF-β-induced cell motility. These findings may lead to a new strategy for selective regulation of TGF-β-induced cellular responses."

This control depends on both the PDZ4 domain and the binding of SR-BI's cytoplasmic C terminus to the canonical peptide-binding sites of either the PDZ1 or PDZ3 domain (no binding to PDZ2 or PDZ4). Using transgenic mice expressing in the liver domain deletion (ΔPDZ2 or ΔPDZ3), domain replacement (PDZ2→1), or target peptide binding-negative (PDZ4(G389P)) mutants of PDZK1, we found that neither PDZ2 nor PDZ3 nor the canonical target peptide binding activity of PDZ4 were necessary for hepatic SR-BI regulatory activity. Immunohistochemical studies established that the localization of PDZK1 on hepatocyte cell surface membranes in vivo is dependent on its PDZ4 domain and the presence of SR-BI. Analytical ultracentrifugation and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry suggested that the requirement of PDZ4 for localization and SR-BI regulation is not due to PDZ4-mediated oligomerization or induction of conformational changes in the PDZ123 portion of PDZK1. However, surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that PDZ4, but not the other PDZ domains, can bind vesicles that mimic the plasma membrane. Thus, PDZ4 may potentiate PDZK1's regulation of SR-BI by promoting its lipid-mediated attachment to the cytoplasmic membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2121249363,"Homodimeric proton-translocating pyrophosphatase (H(+)-PPase; EC 3.6.1.1) is indispensable for many organisms in maintaining organellar pH homeostasis. This unique proton pump couples the hydrolysis of PPi to proton translocation across the membrane. H(+)-PPase consists of 14-16 relatively hydrophobic transmembrane domains presumably for proton translocation and hydrophilic loops primarily embedding a catalytic site. Several highly conserved polar residues located at or near the entrance of the transport pathway in H(+)-PPase are essential for proton pumping activity. In this investigation single molecule FRET was employed to dissect the action at the pathway entrance in homodimeric Clostridium tetani H(+)-PPase upon ligand binding. The presence of the substrate analog, imidodiphosphate mediated two sites at the pathway entrance moving toward each other. Moreover, single molecule FRET analyses after the mutation at the first proton-carrying residue (Arg-169) demonstrated that conformational changes at the entrance are conceivably essential for the initial step of H(+)-PPase proton translocation. A working model is accordingly proposed to illustrate the squeeze at the entrance of the transport pathway in H(+)-PPase upon substrate binding."
