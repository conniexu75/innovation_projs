https://openalex.org/W2073423268,"Abstract A new approach to study differentiation antigens by means of monoclonal xenogeneic antibodies produced by myeloma-hybrid lines in culture is described. Spleen cells from mice immunized with rat thymocyte membranes were fused with a mouse myeloma. Hybrids were selected and screened for the production of antibodies to rat thymocytes by a binding assay. A number of such antibodies was detected, and five specificities (W34, /6, /13, /15 and /25) were further investigated. Two of the hybrid myelomas were cloned, and the monoclonal antibodies were shown to contain heavy chains of molecular weight 50,000 daltons (W313) and about 70,000 daltons (W34), respectively. All antibodies were shown to detect different, previously undefined antigens on different subpopulations of lymphoid cells. The different labeling patterns on thymocytes, thoracic duct lymphocytes and bone marrow cells were investigated by the fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Antibodies W36, /13, /15 and /25 labeled most thymocytes, while W34 labeled very few. Among thoracic duct lymphocytes, W313 labeled most, if not all, of the T cells, and W325 labeled a large fraction of them; W34, on the other hand, labeled mainly B cells. In bone marrow, W313 and W315 labeled sub-populations which were largely independent of each other. Absorption studies showed that brain, but not kidney or liver, absorbed W313, while all these tissues were markedly less effective than lymphoid cells for absorption of W325. The number of antibody molecules per cell binding at saturation to thymocytes was: 5000 (W36); 17,000 (W315 and W325); 36,000 (W313). None appears, therefore, to detect major proteins in the membrane. The method is therefore extremely sensitive and allows identification down to minor membrane molecules and also of antigens on small subpopulations of a heterogeneous mixture of cells."

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) immunised against viruses2, haptens3, minor histocompatibility antigens4 or tumour antigens5, are specific for self H–2 antigens as well as for the foreign antigen. But CTL are not restricted to recognising antigens in combination with only self H–2. H–2d homozygous CTL which have matured in an irradiated H–2d/H–2k host can respond to antigen plus H–2k in addition to antigen plus H–2d (refs 6–8). It is not known whether the H–2 environment in which T cells mature influences their range of specificity, that is, whether CTL from a normal mouse can respond quantitatively as well to antigen plus foreign H–2 as they do to antigen plus self H–2. These experiments were designed to test this influence. The results suggest that host H–2 antigens do exert an effect on the specificity of T-cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W2069978012,"The clonal proliferation of the committed granulocyte-macrophage stem cell is controlled by a balance between mutually opposing factors, colony stimulating factor and prostaglandin E, both of monocyte-macrophage derivation. Increases beyond a critical concentration of colony stimulating factor within the local milieu of the mononuclear phagocyte induces the coincident elaboration of prostaglandin E, a self-regulated response which serves to limit the unopposed humoral stimulation of myelopoiesis."

https://openalex.org/W2005096752,"CELL mediated immune reactions in mice involving cytotoxic thymus derived lymphocytes have two important features; they are antigen-specific1 and the structures coded for by the major murine histocompatibility gene complex (H–2) play an important part in killer cell-target cell interaction1. This finding is not unique to mice since it has also been reported for rats, humans and chickens2–4. Two hypotheses have been suggested to explain this dual specificity of T killer cells; one proposes that T killer cells possess two separate structures, one of which recognises self H–2 structures and the other a non-H–2 antigen (dual recognition). The other hypothesis proposes that T killer cells possess one receptor which recognises an H–2 antigen modified by a non-H–2 antigen (modified self)1,5. Evidence to test these hypotheses was sought by preparing chimaeras made by reconstituting lethally irradiated F1 mice with bone marrow stem cells of one parent (Parent→F) refs 6–8) or neonatally tolerant mice9 (mice of a parental H–2 type injected with F1 cells as neonates). As a result, Parent → F1 chimaeric lymphocytes lysed infected and trinitrophenyl (TNP)-modified targets of both parental H–2 types, suggesting that H–2 antigens of the killer cells were not involved in the lytic interaction. In contrast, lymphocytes from neonatally tolerant mice did not lyse infected targets from the incompatible parent9. Although these results can be explained by postulating a single receptor, they also fit the dual recognition hypothesis6–10. Bevan has shown that irradiated bone marrow chimaeras of the type (A × B)F1 → Parental A recipient generated preferentially cytotoxic T cells against minor histocompatibility antigens in association with the H–2 haplotype of the recipient A; he concluded that the chimaeric host determines the specificity of T cell restriction either through a thymic selection process as proposed by Jerne or alternatively through an antigen presentation mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1994415652,"CHEMICAL carcinogens, for example, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), are metabolised to reactive intermediates which bind covalently to cellular macromolecules1–3 and the extent of binding seems to correlate with the carcinogenic potency of the hydrocarbons1. Through various mutagenicity, metabolism and binding studies, the intermediate which undergoes formation of a stable covalent complex with DNA has been identified as 7β,8α-dihydroxy-9α,10α-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo [a]pyrene (BaP diol epoxide)4–9. The structure of a covalent adduct formed between this hydrocarbon and poly(G) has also been established6–9. We report here the identity of several adducts obtained by reacting (±)BaP diol epoxide with tritium-labelled DNA. Four differently labelled lots of DNA were synthesised in vitro with DNA polymerase I by incorporating in each case three unlabelled and one tritium labelled nucleoside triphosphate. Through the use of this unambiguous labelling technique we have demonstrated that activated BaP forms two adducts with deoxyguanosine, two with deoxyadenosine and possibly one wtih deoxycytidine, while reaction with deoxy-thymidine was not detected. This approach also allowed the relative percentage of each adduct to be calculated. The deoxyguanosine adducts predominated and constituted 92% of the total stable covalent adducts formed."
https://openalex.org/W1518825157,"A nonspecific density labeling technique has been employed to monitor the synthesis of intracytoplasmic membrane in synchronously dividing populations of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides. The intracytoplasmic membranes of cells synchronized in D2O-based medium were found to undergo discontinuous decreases in specific density during synchronous cell growth following transfer to H2O-based medium. These abrupt decreases in membrane specific density occurred immediately prior to cell division and were not observed with intracytoplasmic membranes prepared from asynchronously dividing cells (see also Kowakowski, H., and Kaplan, S. (1974) J. Bacteriol. 118, 1144-1157). Discontinuous increases in the net accumulation of cellular phospholipid were also observed during the synchronous growth of R. sphaeroides. This is to be contrasted to the continuous insertion of protein and the photopigment components of the photosynthetic apparatus into the intracytoplasmic membrane during the cell division cycle (Fraley, R.T., Lueking, D.R., and Kaplan, S. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 458-464; Wraight, C.A., Lueking, D.R., Fraley, R.T., and Kaplan, S. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 465-471). Further, examination of the protein/phospholipid ratios of purified intracytoplasmic membrane preparations revealed that this ratio undergoes cyclical changes of 35 to 40% during a normal cycle of cell division. In contrast to the results of Ferretti and Gray ((1968) J. Bacteriol, 95, 1400-1406), DNA synthesis was found to occur in a stepwise manner in synchronously dividing cell populations of R. sphaeroides."
https://openalex.org/W1507607763,"Addition of serum to quiescent cultures of 3T3 cells rapidly increases lactic acid formation and subsequently stimulates cell division. The stimulation of lactic acid production is seen at high, saturating concentrations of extra-cellular glucose. It is dependent on the time of exposure and on the dose of serum and is not blocked by the addition of cycloheximide, puromycin, or actinomycin D. In contrast, serum only marginally affects glycolysis by rapidly growing 3T6 or SV40-3T3 cells. In addition to serum, epidermal growth factor (0.1 to 10 ng/ml) and insulin (10 to 500 ng/ml) cause a striking stimulation of glycolysis in quiescent 3T3 cells. Neither exogenous cyclic nucleotides nor ouabain effect the glycolytic response, but the presence of Ca2+ markedly influences the activation of glycolysis by epidermal growth factor and by insulin. A novel finding in this study is that homogenates prepared from quiescent cells treated with serum, epidermal growth factor, or insulin show increased glycolysis as compared with homogenates from nonstimulated cultures. This finding will allow further experimental analysis of the cause of increased glycolysis in rapidly proliferating cells."

FTS was sequentially purified and finally isolated from 1000 liters of pig serum by ultrafiltration, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography. Its amino acid composition and apparent molecular weight estimated by Sephadex G-25 chromatography, indicate that FTS is a nonapeptide of composition lysine, aspartic acid (or asparagine), serine 2, glutamic acid (or glutamine) 2, glycine 2, and alanine."

After 4 to 5 days, the daughter cells were stained and examined for immunoglobulin class with double immunofluorescent reagents. A switch of the stained color of these cells was observed, implying a switch from imunoglobulin M to immunoglobulin G production in the progeny of a single B cell."

https://openalex.org/W1514495995,"An endonuclease purified from Hemophilus influenzae made single strand breaks in DNA containing apurinic or apyrimidinic sites but had no detectable endonuclease activity on untreated native DNA. The new 5'-termini created at the cleavage sites were base-free deoxyribose 5-phosphate residues. The enzyme preparation also catalyzed the exonucleolytic release of 5'-mononucleotides from bihelical DNA and the hydrolysis of DNA 3'-terminal phosphomonoesters. The phosphatase-exonuclease activity was indistinguishable from that reported by Gunther and Goodgal (J. Biol. Chem. (1970) 245, 5341-5349) and resembled that of exonuclease III of Escherichia coli. The endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic activities could not be separated by electrophoresis, sedimentation, or gel filtration, and they were also affected simultaneously by mutation. The enzymatic activities appear to be functions of a single monomeric protein (M(r) = 30,000)."

https://openalex.org/W2077641721,"Erythropoietin or colony-stimulating factor, or both, were added to rat or mouse marrow cell cultures, and the responses to each inducer were measured. Colony-stimulating factor caused the suppression of erythropoietin-stimulated hemoglobin synthesis, and erythropoietin caused the suppression of the granulocyte-macrophage colony formation that is dependent on colony-stimulating factor. The extent of suppression by each inducer was dose-dependent. Marrow cells from plethoric rats were more sensitive to suppression of erythropoietin action by colony-stimulating factor than were normal marrow cells. These findings suggest that either (i) the receptors for erythropoietin and for colony-stimulating factor have overlapping specificities and that the ""wrong"" inducer may bind without having an inductive effect, or (ii) the target cells for erythropoietin and colony-stimulating factor are very closely related or are the same."

https://openalex.org/W91350016,"A NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase, which produces FMNH2, one of the substrates for the luciferase reaction in bioluminescent bacteria, has been purified with the aid of affinity chromatography on epsilon-aminohexanoyl-FMN-Sepharose. The purified enzyme, isolated from Beneckea harveyi, had a specific activity of 89 mumol of NADH oxidized/min/mg of protein at 23 degrees in the presence of saturating FMN and NADH and appeared homogeneous by several criteria on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A molecular weight of 24,000 was estimated both by gel filtration and and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis indicating that the enzyme is composed of a single polypeptide chain. Kinetic studies showed that the higher specificity of the enzyme for NADH than NADPH and for riboflavin and FMN than FAD was primarily due to variations in the Michaelis constants for the different substrates. Initial velocity studies with all pairs of substrates gave intersecting patterns supporting a sequential mechanism for the NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase."
https://openalex.org/W1593202625,"The effect of cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) on newly synthesized globin mRNA in cultured mouse fetal liver erythroid cells is investigated. At cordycepin concentrations that do not inhibit amino acid incorporation into acid-precipitable material, the quantity of pulse-labeled (radioactive) globin mRNA nucleotide sequences is reduced by 90%, as compared to adenosine-treated controls. The reduction of radioactivity in globin-specific RNA sequences is greater than the inhibition of total RNA synthesis in experiments in which the labeling times range from 6 to 60 min. Control experiments demonstrate that cordycepin does not reduce the recovery of total cell RNA or steady state (unlabeled) globin mRNA. The hybridization assay used to detect radioactive globin mRNA sequences is independent of the cellular location or the number of 3'-terminal adenylate residues in the mRNA-containing molecules. These data thus indicate that cordycepin inhibits newly synthesized mRNA as effectively as it inhibits ribosomal and transfer RNA synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1488024233,"The interaction of alpha1-antitrypsin with trypsin and chymotrypsin has been investigated by protease activity assays, by electrophoretic analysis, by CD and absorption difference spectra, and by gel filtration of reaction mixtures containing excess inhibitor or excess protease. When alpha1-antitrypsin is present in excess, only one stable inhibitor - protease complex is formed. In the presence of excess protease, however, this primary complex is degraded relatively rapidly to one or more secondary complexes. These latter conversions are more pronounced in the case of the antititrypsin-chymotrypsin system. The greater lability of the antitrypsin-chymotrypsin system is evidenced by the relatively rapid release of inactive chymotrypsin from the secondary antitrypsin - chymotrypsin complex. Only minimal amounts of active protease were released from the complexes on the addition of excess protease and one protease could not displace the other from the complex, although competition experiments showed that chymotrypsin reacted more rapidly with the inhibitor than trypsin."

https://openalex.org/W1547382267,"A NAD+-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase, the activity of which induces at the same time as luceriferase, has been purified from the bioluminescent bacterium Beneckea harveyi, and its chemical and physical properties have been investigated. The purification is accomplished in three steps resulting in an enzyme preparation that gives a single protein band on three different gel electrophoresis systems. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 120,000 by gel filtration. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis gave a molecular weight of 59,000 indicating that aldehyde dehydrogenase has a dimeric structure with subunits of similar molecular weight. The purified enzyme has a high specificity for long chain aliphatic aldehydes; the Michaelis constants for aldehydes decrease with increasing chain length as also observed for bacterial aldehyde dehydrogenases involved in the metabolism of hydrocarbons. The aldehyde specificity of the aldehyde dehydrogenase is similar to that of luciferase indicating that the functional role of the enzyme may be linked with the bioluminescent system."

When thrombin was added to purified normal factor VIII, there was a rapid loss of rod-shaped particles during the first 15 minutes of incubation at 37 degrees C. Purified plasma from two patients with severe hemophilia contained spherical particles measuring 10 to 50 nanometers in diameter, with no evidence of significant numbers of rod-shaped forms.

https://openalex.org/W1479969585,"The circulating red blood cells formed in bullfrog larvae, chicken embryos, and mouse embryos contain large amounts of ferritin and storage iron in excess of the need for hemoglobin. In contrast, the circulating red cells of adult animals contain little ferritin. Ferritin synthesis and iron storage are coordinated with differentiation and hemoglobin synthesis in the red cells of adults. In order to test the hypothesis that ferritin synthesis could be controlled independently of hemoglobin synthesis and differentiation in the red cells formed early in life, bullfrog larvae were injected with iron to determine if ferritin synthesis was increased in the circulating red cells. Within 17 h after the injection of iron, the synthesis of ferritin, assayed as the incorporation of [14C]leucine by cell suspensions prepared from circulating red cells, was increased from 2.9 to 10.2% of the total protein, and the specific activity of the ferritin synthesized increased from 1100 to 3000 cpm/A280. There was no change in the hematocrit of the animals nor in the specific activity of hemoglobin synthesized by suspensions of red cells (average, 720 cpm/A280). The results suggest that in mature, larval red cells, ferritin synthesis can be controlled by changes in the extracellular environment. The results also indicate that ferritin synthesis can be controlled independently of hemoglobin synthesis with which it is coordinated during erythroid differentiation in adult animals."
