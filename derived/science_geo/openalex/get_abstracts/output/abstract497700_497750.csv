https://openalex.org/W2044830131,"Naive and primed pluripotency is characterized by distinct signaling requirements, transcriptomes, and developmental properties, but both cellular states share key transcriptional regulators: Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. Here, we demonstrate that transition between these two pluripotent states is associated with widespread Oct4 relocalization, mirrored by global rearrangement of enhancer chromatin landscapes. Our genomic and biochemical analyses identified candidate mediators of primed state-specific Oct4 binding, including Otx2 and Zic2/3. Even when differentiation cues are blocked, premature Otx2 overexpression is sufficient to exit the naive state, induce transcription of a substantial subset of primed pluripotency-associated genes, and redirect Oct4 to previously inaccessible enhancer sites. However, the ability of Otx2 to engage new enhancer regions is determined by its levels, cis-encoded properties of the sites, and the signaling environment. Our results illuminate regulatory mechanisms underlying pluripotency and suggest that the capacity of transcription factors such as Otx2 and Oct4 to pioneer new enhancer sites is highly context dependent."

Here, we show that prolonged fasting reduces circulating IGF-1 levels and PKA activity in various cell populations, leading to signal transduction changes in long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) and niche cells that promote stress resistance, self-renewal, and lineage-balanced regeneration. Multiple cycles of fasting abated the immunosuppression and mortality caused by chemotherapy and reversed age-dependent myeloid-bias in mice, in agreement with preliminary data on the protection of lymphocytes from chemotoxicity in fasting patients. The proregenerative effects of fasting on stem cells were recapitulated by deficiencies in either IGF-1 or PKA and blunted by exogenous IGF-1. These findings link the reduced levels of IGF-1 caused by fasting to PKA signaling and establish their crucial role in regulating hematopoietic stem cell protection, self-renewal, and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2155870354,"The inheritance of epigenetic marks, in particular DNA methylation, provides a molecular memory that ensures faithful commitment to transcriptional programs during mammalian development. Epigenetic reprogramming results in global hypomethylation of the genome together with a profound loss of memory, which underlies naive pluripotency. Such global reprogramming occurs in primordial germ cells, early embryos, and embryonic stem cells where reciprocal molecular links connect the methylation machinery to pluripotency. Priming for differentiation is initiated upon exit from pluripotency, and we propose that epigenetic mechanisms create diversity of transcriptional states, which help with symmetry breaking during cell fate decisions and lineage commitment."
https://openalex.org/W2163282809,"Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), the rate-limiting enzyme for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) synthesis, and Sirt1, an NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase, protect the heart against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). It remains unknown whether Nampt mediates the protective effect of ischemic preconditioning (IPC), whether nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN, 500 mg/kg), a product of Nampt in the NAD+ salvage pathway, mimics the effect of IPC, or whether caloric restriction (CR) upregulates Nampt and protects the heart through a Sirt1-dependent mechanism. IPC upregulated Nampt protein, and the protective effect of IPC against ischemia (30 minutes) and reperfusion (24 hours) was attenuated at both early and late phases in Nampt +/− mice, suggesting that Nampt plays an essential role in mediating the protective effect of IPC. In order to mimic the effect of Nampt, NMN was administered by intraperitoneal injection. NMN significantly increased the level of NAD+ in the heart at baseline and prevented a decrease in NAD+ during ischemia. NMN protected the heart from I/R injury when it was applied once 30 minutes before ischemia or 4 times just before and during reperfusion, suggesting that exogenous NMN protects the heart from I/R injury in both ischemic and reperfusion phases. The protective effect of NMN was accompanied by decreases in acetylation of FoxO1, but it was not obvious in Sirt1 KO mice, suggesting that the effect of NMN is mediated through activation of Sirt1. Compared to control diet (90% calories), CR (60% calories for 6 weeks) in mice led to a significant reduction in I/R injury, accompanied by upregulation of Nampt. The protective effect of CR against I/R injury was not significant in cardiac-specific Sirt1 KO mice, suggesting that the protective effect of CR is in part mediated through the Nampt-Sirt1 pathway. In conclusion, exogenous application of NMN and CR protects the heart by both mimicking IPC and activating Sirt1."
https://openalex.org/W1999092590,"The main objective of this work is the study of the phylogeny, evolution and ecological importance of the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, the activity of which represents one of the most important and studied mechanisms used by plant growth–promoting microorganisms. The ACC deaminase gene and its regulatory elements presence in completely sequenced organisms was verified by multiple searches in diverse databases, and based on the data obtained a comprehensive analysis was conducted. Strain habitat, origin and ACC deaminase activity were taken into account when analyzing the results. In order to unveil ACC deaminase origin, evolution and relationships with other closely related pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes a phylogenetic analysis was also performed. The data obtained show that ACC deaminase is mostly prevalent in some Bacteria, Fungi and members of Stramenopiles. Contrary to previous reports, we show that ACC deaminase genes are predominantly vertically inherited in various bacterial and fungal classes. Still, results suggest a considerable degree of horizontal gene transfer events, including interkingdom transfer events. A model for ACC deaminase origin and evolution is also proposed. This study also confirms the previous reports suggesting that the Lrp-like regulatory protein AcdR is a common mechanism regulating ACC deaminase expression in Proteobacteria, however, we also show that other regulatory mechanisms may be present in some Proteobacteria and other bacterial phyla. In this study we provide a more complete view of the role for ACC deaminase than was previously available. The results show that ACC deaminase may not only be related to plant growth promotion abilities, but may also play multiple roles in microorganism's developmental processes. Hence, exploring the origin and functioning of this enzyme may be the key in a variety of important agricultural and biotechnological applications."
https://openalex.org/W2033979235,"Background Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common manifestation of polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM), and clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM); however, little is known about the factors influencing the prognosis for PM/DM/CADM-associated ILD. (PM/DM/CADM-ILD). The aim of the present study is to assess prognostic factors for PM/DM/CADM-ILD. Methods The clinical features and survival of 114 consecutive patients diagnosed with PM/DM/CADM-ILD (39 men and 75 women; median age, 56 years) were analyzed retrospectively. Results The study group included 30 PM-associated ILD, 41 DM-associated ILD, and 43 CADM-associated ILD cases. The clinical presentation of ILD was acute/subacute form in 59 patients (51.8%) and chronic form in 55 patients (48.2%). The major pulmonary symptoms were dyspnea, cough, and fever. High-resolution computed tomography frequently revealed ground-glass opacities, traction bronchiectasis, and consolidation. Most of the patients were treated with corticosteroids or corticosteroids in combination with immunosuppressive agents. The all-cause mortality was 27.2%. Acute/subacute form, % forced vital capacity (FVC), age, % of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and a diagnosis of CADM (vs. PM) were significantly associated with poor outcome in univariate Cox proportional hazards models. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis validated acute/subacute ILD, %FVC, age, and diagnosis of CADM (vs. PM) as significant predictors of overall mortality. Patients with acute/subacute ILD had a much lower survival rate than those with the chronic form (p<0.001). Patients with CADM-ILD had a lower survival rate than those with PM-ILD (p = 0.034). Conclusions Acute/subacute form, older age, lower level of FVC and diagnosis of CADM predict poor outcome in PM/DM/CADM-ILD."
https://openalex.org/W2004039379,"L-asparaginase having low glutaminase has been a key therapeutic agent in the treatment of acute lymphpoblastic leukemia (A.L.L). In the present study, an extracellular L-asparaginase with low glutaminase activity, produced by Bacillus licheniformis was purified to homogeneity. Protein was found to be a homotetramer of 134.8 KDa with monomeric size of 33.7 KDa and very specific for its natural substrate i.e. L-asparagine. The activity of purified L-asparaginase enhanced in presence of cations including Na+ and K+, whereas it was moderately inhibited in the presence of divalent cations and thiol group blocking reagents. The purified enzyme was maximally active over the range of pH 6.0 to 10.0 and temperature of 40°C and enzyme was stable maximum at pH 9.0 and −20°C. CD spectra of L-asparaginase predicted the enzyme to consist of 63.05% α- helix and 3.29% β-sheets in its native form with T222 of 58°C. Fluorescent spectroscopy showed the protein to be stable even in the presence of more than 3 M GdHCl. Kinetic parameters Km, Vmax and kcat of purified enzyme were found as 1.4×10−5 M, 4.03 IU and 2.68×103 s−1, respectively. The purified L-asparaginase had cytotoxic activity against various cancerous cell lines viz. Jurkat clone E6-1, MCF-7 and K-562 with IC50 of 0.22 IU, 0.78 IU and 0.153 IU respectively. However the enzyme had no toxic effect on human erythrocytes and CHO cell lines hence should be considered potential candidate for further pharmaceutical use as an anticancer drug."

The maintenance of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) requires LIF and serum. However, a pluripotent “ground state,” bearing resemblance to preimplantation mouse epiblasts, can be established through dual inhibition (2i) of both prodifferentiation Mek/Erk and Gsk3/Tcf3 pathways. While Gsk3 inhibition has been attributed to the transcriptional derepression of Esrrb, the molecular mechanism mediated by Mek inhibition remains unclear. In this study, we show that Krüppel-like factor 2 (Klf2) is phosphorylated by Erk2 and that phospho-Klf2 is proteosomally degraded. Mek inhibition hence prevents Klf2 protein phosphodegradation to sustain pluripotency. Indeed, while Klf2-null mESCs can survive under LIF/Serum, they are not viable under 2i, demonstrating that Klf2 is essential for ground state pluripotency. Importantly, we also show that ectopic Klf2 expression can replace Mek inhibition in mESCs, allowing the culture of Klf2-null mESCs under Gsk3 inhibition alone.

Collectively, our study defines the Mek/Erk/Klf2 axis that cooperates with the Gsk3/Tcf3/Esrrb pathway in mediating ground state pluripotency. The self-renewing pluripotent state was first captured in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) over 30 years ago (Evans and Kaufman, 1981Evans M.J. Kaufman M.H.

USA. 1981; 78: 7634-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (4318) Google Scholar). The standard culture of mESCs requires the presence of Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and serum to maintain a self-renewing and pluripotent state (Nichols and Smith, 2011Nichols J. Smith A. The origin and identity of embryonic stem cells.Development. 2011; 138: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, under LIF/Serum culture conditions, the prodifferentiation Fibroblast growth factor/Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Fgf/Mek/Erk) pathway, which initiates lineage commitment (Kunath et al., 2007Kunath T. Saba-El-Leil M.K. Almousailleakh M. Wray J. Meloche S. Smith A.

Kurek D. Blauwkamp T. Koole W. Maas A. Eroglu E. Siu R.K. Nusse R. Embryonic stem cells require Wnt proteins to prevent differentiation to epiblast stem cells.Nat.

Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Interestingly, by using two small molecules, PD0325901 and CHIR99021 (denoted as 2i), to inhibit Mek and Gsk3 signaling, it was found that mESCs could be kept pluripotent in the absence of LIF/Serum stimulation (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Importantly, the use of 2i in place of LIF/Serum is considered a major advancement for pluripotent stem cell biology because it enables the successful derivation of ESCs from previously refractory mouse strains (Blair et al., 2011Blair K. Wray J. Smith A. The liberation of embryonic stem cells.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002019Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). mESCs cultured under 2i exhibit several unique features, including uniformly high expression of several pluripotency genes (Wray et al., 2010Wray J. Kalkan T. Smith A.G. The ground state of pluripotency.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2010; 38: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), reduced expression of lineage-specific genes with a lower occurrence of bivalent domains (Marks et al., 2012Marks H. Kalkan T. Menafra R. Denissov S. Jones K. Hofemeister H. Nichols J. Kranz A. Stewart A.F. Smith A. Stunnenberg H.G. The transcriptional and epigenomic foundations of ground state pluripotency.Cell. 2012; 149: 590-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), and the possession of a genome-wide DNA hypomethylated state similar to the mouse inner cell mass (ICM) (Bagci and Fisher, 2013Bagci H. Fisher A.G. DNA demethylation in pluripotency and reprogramming: the role of tet proteins and cell division.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 13: 265-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, mESCs under 2i are proposed to exist in a distinct “ground state” of pluripotency resembling the ICM of preimplantation blastocysts (Nichols et al., 2009Nichols J. Silva J. Roode M. Smith A. Suppression of Erk signalling promotes ground state pluripotency in the mouse embryo.Development. 2009; 136: 3215-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.L.

The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Given these similar features, investigating how 2i ground state pluripotency operates should reveal new insights into the molecular design of pluripotency and preimplantation embryogenesis. How exactly then does the dual inhibition of Fgf/Mek/Erk and Gsk3/Tcf3 signaling pathways enable ground state pluripotency? Analysis of Tcf3 genomic binding sites through chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) reveals that Gsk3 signaling inhibition alleviates Tcf3-mediated transcriptional repression of Esrrb (Martello et al., 2012Martello G. Sugimoto T. Diamanti E. Joshi A. Hannah R. Ohtsuka S. Göttgens B. Niwa H. Smith A. Esrrb is a pivotal target of the Gsk3/Tcf3 axis regulating embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11: 491-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Notably, because Esrrb overexpression could replace CHIR99021 under 2i conditions, this finding demonstrates the importance of Esrrb, which is downstream of Gsk3/Tcf3 inhibition in ground state pluripotency. In contrast to the Gsk3/Tcf3 pathway, the exact mechanism by which Mek/Erk signaling inhibition affects ground state pluripotency is less clear. Here, by analyzing the change in protein expression of Krüppel-like factor 2 (Klf2), Klf4, and Klf5 under LIF/Serum and 2i, we found that Mek/Erk stimulation leads to the phosphodependent degradation of Klf2 protein. Consequently, the addition of Mek inhibitor PD0325901 halts Mek/Erk-induced Klf2 protein degradation and sustains elevated Klf2 protein levels. Importantly, we also demonstrate that Klf2 is an essential factor during ground state conditions as Klf2-null mESCs undergo cell death under 2i. Together with the report that Gsk3 inhibition acts to alleviate Tcf3-mediated repression of Esrrb (Martello et al., 2012Martello G. Sugimoto T. Diamanti E. Joshi A. Hannah R. Ohtsuka S. Göttgens B. Niwa H. Smith A. Esrrb is a pivotal target of the Gsk3/Tcf3 axis regulating embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11: 491-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), our study reveals that Mek/Erk inhibition sustains mESCs through Klf2 protein stabilization, thus completing the model for how 2i supports ground state pluripotency. We have previously shown that mESCs cultured under LIF/Serum conditions require the collective presence of Klf2, Klf4, and Klf5 to sustain self-renewal (Jiang et al., 2008Jiang J. Chan Y.S. Loh Y.H. Cai J. Tong G.Q. Lim C.A. Robson P. Zhong S. Ng H.H. A core Klf circuitry regulates self-renewal of embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested to know if this triple redundancy exists during ground state pluripotency. At the transcriptional level, we found that LIF/Serum and 2i-cultured mESCs exhibit comparable Oct4 and Nanog expression (Figure 1A). In addition, 2i-cultured mESCs expressed low levels of Klf4 and Klf5 and showed a marginal 2-fold upregulation of Klf2 expression (Figure 1B). The change in Klf4 and Klf5 expression is expected because LIF is not present under 2i conditions to induce Klf4 and Klf5 expression (Hall et al., 2009Hall J. Guo G. Wray J. Eyres I. Nichols J. Grotewold L. Morfopoulou S. Humphreys P. Mansfield W. Walker R. et al.Oct4 and LIF/Stat3 additively induce Krüppel factors to sustain embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 597-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, Niwa et al., 2009Niwa H. Ogawa K. Shimosato D. Adachi K. A parallel circuit of LIF signalling pathways maintains pluripotency of mouse ES cells.Nature. 2009; 460: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). However, 2i appears to have a modest positive effect on Klf2 expression compared to LIF/Serum conditions (Greber et al., 2010Greber B. Wu G. Bernemann C. Joo J.Y. Han D.W. Ko K. Tapia N. Sabour D. Sterneckert J. Tesar P. Schöler H.R. Conserved and divergent roles of FGF signaling in mouse epiblast stem cells and human embryonic stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 215-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We next probed into the protein level changes of these three Klfs in ground state mESCs and found that, correlating with transcriptional data, Klf4 and Klf5 protein levels were reduced under 2i (Figure 1C). However, unlike the marginal upregulation of Klf2 transcript (Figure 1B), we found a striking increase in Klf2 protein following 2i culture (Figure 1C). Because this increase in Klf2 protein levels under 2i is unlikely to be fully accounted for by the 2-fold upregulation of Klf2 mRNA (Figure 1B), we hence hypothesized that Klf2 protein may be posttranslationally regulated. In support of this hypothesis, we found the increase of Klf2 protein under 2i to be rapid and detectable within 30 min of switching from LIF/Serum (Figure 1D). Importantly, because Klf2 transcript was only increased slightly within this timeframe despite the substantial increase of Klf2 protein levels (Figure 1E), our data strongly implicate a posttranslational regulation of Klf2 under 2i. We did not however observe any changes to Klf4 and Klf5 protein or mRNA during this 30 min period (Figures 1D and 1E), suggesting that the decrease of Klf4 and Klf5 during ground state pluripotency (Figure 1C) is regulated at the transcriptional level. 2i culture contains the inhibitors PD0325901 and CHIR99021, which block the activity of Mek and Gsk3, respectively. Therefore, to determine which of these inhibitors is responsible for the increase in Klf2 protein, we added the inhibitors alone or in combination to mESCs cultured in LIF/Serum for 2 hr before protein extraction. We found that the Mek inhibitor PD0325901 alone was sufficient to elevate the Klf2 protein level to that observed in 2i (Figure 1F). Gsk3 inhibition with CHIR99021, however, did not result in any increase in Klf2 protein level (Figure 1F). Similar to the data presented in Figures 1D and 1E, Klf4 and Klf5 protein levels are refractory toward either Mek or Gsk3 signaling inhibition in this experiment (Figure 1F). Because Klf2 protein appears to be negatively regulated by Mek signaling, we next examined the effect of hyperphosphorylation on Klf proteins. Using Calyculin A (CalA) to inhibit serine/threonine protein phosphatases, we found a rapid loss of Klf2 protein within 30 min, but we did not find this loss for Klf4 and Klf5 protein (Figure 1G). This data suggest that any putative phosphorylation on Klf2 by Mek signaling could lead to the degradation of Klf2 protein. Indeed, blockade of proteosome activity by MG132 in LIF/Serum cultured mESCs was found to halt Klf2 protein degradation, leading to elevated Klf2 protein levels similar to that resulting from treatment with Mek inhibitor (Figure 1H). Taken together, these results demonstrate that active Mek signaling destabilizes Klf2 protein. By inhibiting Mek with PD0325901, this phosphodependent degradation of Klf2 is relieved, resulting in Klf2 protein accumulation under ground state conditions. To establish that Klf2 is phosphorylated, we immunoprecipitated (IP) Klf2 from mESC lysates and found the presence of phospho-serine/threonine-specific residues on Klf2 (Figure 2A). Furthermore, while comparable levels of Klf2 IP were obtained among the different mESC samples, we could only observe a strong loss of phospho-Klf2 signal following PD0325901 treatment (Figure 2A). This demonstrates that Klf2 serine/threonine phosphorylation is regulated via a Mek signaling mechanism. Because the downstream targets of Mek are the serine/threonine kinases Erk1/2 (Roberts and Der, 2007Roberts P.J. Der C.J. Targeting the Raf-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade for the treatment of cancer.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3291-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2192) Google Scholar), and because previous phosphoproteomic studies in mESCs have identified phosphoresidues at several Erk consensus phosphorylation P-X-S/T-P motifs in Klf2 protein (Li et al., 2011Li Q.R. Xing X.B. Chen T.T. Li R.X. Dai J. Sheng Q.H. Xin S.M. Zhu L.L. Jin Y. Pei G. et al.Large scale phosphoproteome profiles comprehensive features of mouse embryonic stem cells.Mol.

Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 4964-4977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 2B), we hence hypothesize that Klf2 may be phosphorylated by Erk. Given that mESCs predominantly express Erk2 (Kunath et al., 2007Kunath T. Saba-El-Leil M.K. Almousailleakh M. Wray J. Meloche S. Smith A. FGF stimulation of the Erk1/2 signalling cascade triggers transition of pluripotent embryonic stem cells from self-renewal to lineage commitment.Development. 2007; 134: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), we investigated a potential interaction between Klf2 and Erk2. As an initial trial using HEK293T cells, we found that Klf2 and Erk2 were indeed able to bind with each other. Specifically, we observed that exogenous HA-tagged Klf2 protein could be coimmunoprecipitated (co-IP) with endogenous Erk2 (Figure 2C). Likewise, the reciprocal pulldown of exogenous HA-tagged Klf2 could result in the co-IP of coexpressed Flag-tagged Erk2 or endogenous Erk2 (Figures S1A and S1B available online). To further validate the Klf2-Erk2 interaction in mESCs, we employed the proximity ligation assay (PLA) (Söderberg et al., 2006Söderberg O. Gullberg M. Jarvius M. Ridderstråle K. Leuchowius K.J. Jarvius J. Wester K. Hydbring P. Bahram F. Larsson L.G. Landegren U. Direct observation of individual endogenous protein complexes in situ by proximity ligation.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar) to detect for in situ endogenous Klf2-Erk2 association. In principle, PLA functions by exploiting the close proximity of protein-protein interactions to link their respective cognate antibodies and generate a fluorescence signal. Following PLA, we found numerous Klf2-Erk2 binding signals in mESCs, but not when either α-Klf2 or α-Erk2 antibodies were absent (Figure 2D). This indicates that the observed Klf2-Erk2 PLA signals are specific and that the Klf2 and Erk2 protein colocalize with each other. Lastly, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using [γ-32P]-ATP and found that activated recombinant Erk2 could specifically phosphorylate GST-tagged recombinant Klf2, but not the negative control GST protein (Figure 2E). Therefore, in the context of our previous data, which support a Klf2-Erk2 interaction (Figures 2A–2D), the phosphorylation of recombinant GST-Klf2 by active Erk2 clearly demonstrates a direct and functional Klf2-Erk2 relationship. Because mESCs cultured under 2i express a high level of Klf2 with a reduced level of Klf4 and Klf5 protein (Figure 1C), we hypothesized that Klf2, rather than Klf4 or Klf5, is important for ground state pluripotency. To examine the role of Klf2 during ground state conditions, we sought to generate Klf2 knockout mESCs. This was done by replacing a genomic segment covering exon 2 and 3 of the Klf2 gene with an IRES-LacZ reporter and Neo-selection cassette (Figures S2A–S2C). This targeting strategy generates a Klf2-null allele. Subsequently, single-allele targeted Klf2-heterozygous (Klf2-Het) mESCs were used to generate germ-line-transmitting chimeras, and the eventual Klf2-Het transgenic mice were used for breeding. In agreement with previous studies (Kuo et al., 1997Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M.

Loss of LKLF function results in embryonic lethality in mice.Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), our Klf2 knockout mice were all embryonic lethal due to intraembryonic hemorrhaging (Figures S2D and S2E). Additionally, because Klf2 is expressed during the development of the embryonic vasculature (Kuo et al., 1997Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. The LKLF transcription factor is required for normal tunica media formation and blood vessel stabilization during murine embryogenesis.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), we also found strong LacZ signal in the blood vessels of Klf2-null embryos (Figure S2F). Therefore, our corroborating in vivo data with the literature validates the specificity and phenotype of our Klf2 gene targeting. Because Klf2-null mice are embryonic lethal, Klf2-null blastocysts have to be isolated via the mating of Klf2-Het parents. Using LIF with knockout serum (KSR), we successfully generated 19 mESC lines. Among these obtained were 5 Klf2 wild-type (Klf2-WT), 11 Klf2-Het and 3 Klf2-null mESC lines (Figures S2G and S2H). This observed genotype ratio is consistent with the expected 1:2:1 Mendalian ratio following a Klf2-Het mating scheme (Figures S2G and S2H). Importantly, our derived Klf2-null mESCs were found to be pluripotent: they exhibited positive alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining, expression of key mESC genes and proteins except Klf2, an ability to form teratomas, and a contribution toward mouse chimeras (Figures 3A–3E and Figure S2I). Because feeder cells secrete factors that interfere with signaling pathway studies, we adapted the Klf2-null mESCs onto gelatin surfaces. These feeder-free Klf2-null mESCs were AP positive and retained an overall mESC gene expression signature (Figures 3F and 3G). PLAs of these Klf2-null mESCs using antibodies against Erk2 and Klf2 were negative (Figure S2J), demonstrating that our previously observed Klf2-Erk2 PLA signals did not arise from nonspecific interactions (Figure 2D). Importantly, although these feeder-free Klf2-null mESCs could be cultured under LIF/Serum, we found that Klf2-null mESCs cannot be maintained under 2i for more than three or four passages (Figures 3H and 3I). This nonviability of Klf2-null mESCs under 2i however can be rescued with exogenous LIF (Figures 3H and 3I). Because these Klf2-null mESCs exhibited elevated Annexin V and propidium iodide staining following culture under 2i, we propose that Klf2-null mESCs undergo cell death under ground state condition (Figure 3J). To rescue the cell death phenotype under 2i, we stably overexpressed wild-type HA-tagged Klf2 in our Klf2-null mESCs using piggybac vectors (Wang et al., 2008Wang W. Lin C. Lu D. Ning Z. Cox T. Melvin D. Wang X. Bradley A. Liu P. Chromosomal transposition of PiggyBac in mouse embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9290-9295Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that ectopic Klf2 expression was able to prevent Klf2-null mESC death, allowing the continuous culture of Klf2-null mESCs under 2i for up to 10 passages (Figure 3K). In addition, we also found that Klf2 overexpression was sufficient to replace PD0325901, enabling the culture of Klf2-null mESCs in CHIR99021 alone (1i) (Figure 3L). Because Klf2 protein is negatively regulated by Erk phosphorylation, we next generated various Klf2 serine/threonine to alanine point mutations at predicted Erk phosphorylation sites. This was to examine if Klf2 phosphomutants could confer any positive growth effects on Klf2-null mESCs under 1i. Because we observed that the single-site mutants showed modest or weak effect, we next proceeded to generate double and quadruple Klf2 serine/threonine mutants. Notably, these Klf2 double and quadruple mutants in 1i culture were found to promote a 30% and 60% increase, respectively, in Klf2-null mESC colony numbers (Figures S2K and S2L). Therefore, taken together, our data demonstrate the essentiality of Klf2 protein downstream of Mek/Erk signaling pathway inhibition. Given this necessity for Klf2 for 2i-cultured mESCs, we examined if the absence of Klf2 is detrimental toward establishing mESCs from blastocysts under 2i conditions. Starting from 85 blastocysts obtained through Klf2-Het crosses, we eventually derived 41 mESC lines under 2i with feeder conditions. Among these, we genotyped 20 Klf2-WT, 20 Klf2-Het, and a single Klf2-null mESC line (Figure 3M). This abnormally skewed Klf2 genotype frequency using the 2i derivation method far deviates from the 1:2:1 expected ratio from a standard Het × Het mating. Because 2i culture has been extremely effective in deriving mESCs from recalcitrant mouse strains (Blair et al., 2011Blair K. Wray J. Smith A. The liberation of embryonic stem cells.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002019Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), our severe inefficiency in generating Klf2-null and Klf2-Het mESCs under 2i emphasizes again this critical necessity for Klf2 in ground state pluripotency. Although 2i-cultured Klf2-null mESCs undergo cell death around 2i passage 3 (Figures 3I and 3J), expression levels of key pluripotency genes were still fairly consistent albeit with elevated Klf4, Klf5, and Nanog levels (Figures S3A and S3B). To determine the cause of Klf2-null mESC death under 2i, we performed microarray gene expression profiling of Klf2-WT and Klf2-null mESCs at 2i passage 3. Although gene ontology (GO) analysis of transcriptional changes between Klf2-WT and Klf2-null mESCs only revealed enrichment of terms related to metabolic and cellular processes (Figure S3C), closer inspection into the list of gene changes revealed elevated levels of primordial germ cell (PGC) genes such as Dppa3, c-Kit, Tcfap2c, Dnd1, Ifitm1, and Prdm1 (Figures S3D and S3E). Because Klf2 is known to synergize with the PGC factor Prdm14 to convert EpiSCs into naive pluripotency (Gillich et al., 2012Gillich A. Bao S. Grabole N. Hayashi K. Trotter M.W. Pasque V. Magnúsdóttir E. Surani M.A. Epiblast stem cell-based system reveals reprogramming synergy of germline factors.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 425-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and because Klf2 expression is associated with PGC development (Kurimoto et al., 2008Kurimoto K. Yabuta Y. Ohinata Y. Shigeta M. Yamanaka K. Saitou M. Complex genome-wide transcription dynamics orchestrated by Blimp1 for the specification of the germ cell lineage in mice.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1617-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), we next examined the relationship of Klf2 with PGC gene regulation during ground state pluripotency. In Klf2-null mESCs, we observed that elevated PGC gene expression could be detectable during the early transition phase from LIF/Serum into 2i passage 1 (Figure 4A). However, unlike 2i-cultured Klf2-WT mESCs, which gradually downregulate PGC gene expression relative to the starting LIF/Serum PGC transcript levels (Figure 4B), we noticed that Klf2-null mESCs maintained a sustained PGC gene expression despite continuous 2i culture (Figure 4B). This lead us to hypothesize that without Klf2, ground state mESCs could be potentially defective in their ability to properly suppress PGC gene expression. To examine whether Klf2 may be involved in regulating these PGC genes, we next conducted Klf2 ChIP-seq for LIF/Serum and 2i cultured mESCs. Indeed, Klf2 binding was detected at the promoters of key PGC genes such as Prdm1, Tcfap2c, and c-Kit in both LIF/Serum and 2i conditions (Figure 4C). This suggests that Klf2 may play a possible regulatory role at these PGC genes. Notably, because we observed a concurrent decrease in Klf4 binding at Prdm1, Tcfap2c, and c-Kit promoters following 2i culture (Figure S3F), it is probable that it is Klf2 rather than Klf4 that plays a role to suppress PGC gene expression under 2i. Hence in the context of Klf2-null mESCs, the loss of Klf2 without the additional support from LIF-induced Klf4 results in aberrant PGC gene transcription and potential differentiation into PGC-like lineages. However, due to the restrictive nature of 2i culture for the pluripotent ground state, any differentiating Klf2-null mESCs would not be able to survive. This may account for our observed cell death phenotype of Klf2-null mESCs under 2i (Figure 3J). In light of our findings, we propose a model for the regulation of Klf2 by Mek/Erk signaling under conventional LIF/Serum condition or 2i-induced ground state (Figure 4D). Under LIF/Serum condition, both the Fgf/Mek/Erk and LIF signaling pathways in mESCs are active. Although active Fgf-signaling is antagonistic toward Klf2 protein stability, not all Klf2 protein is degraded. As such, some Klf2 protein may continue to function with the LIF-induced Klf4/Klf5 to exert a triple-redundancy effect in mESCs (Jiang et al., 2008Jiang J. Chan Y.S. Loh Y.H. Cai J. Tong G.Q. Lim C.A. Robson P. Zhong S. Ng H.H. A core Klf circuitry regulates self-renewal of embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). However, during 2i-induced ground state, because of the absence of LIF, the level of Klf4/Klf5 protein is inadequate to sustain mESCs. Under this condition, inhibition of Mek signaling is necessary to prevent Mek/Erk phosphodependent protein degradation of Klf2, which leads to an elevated Klf2 protein level to sustain the self-renewal of mESCs. Despite the reported functional redundancy of Klf2/Klf4/Klf5 in LIF/Serum mESCs, not all Klf proteins exhibit equal potency. During somatic cell reprogramming, Klf2 is a more efficient reprogramming factor than Klf1, Klf4, or Klf5 (Feng et al., 2009Feng B. Jiang J. Kraus P. Ng J.H. Heng J.C. Chan Y.S. Yaw L.P. Zhang W.

Similarly, Prdm14, when synergized with Klf2, could rapidly drive EpiSCs into mESCs conversion, but not so for Klf4 or Klf5 (Gillich et al., 2012Gillich A. Bao S. Grabole N. Hayashi K. Trotter M.W.

Here we asked whether this variation is influenced by properties of the CS itself. In rats, we assessed both the attractiveness and conditioned reinforcing properties of two CSs: a manipulable lever CS versus an auditory (tone) CS. There was considerable individual variation in the extent to which a lever CS acquired incentive motivational properties, as indicated by whether it became attractive (evoked a sign-tracking or goal-tracking conditioned response) or acted as a conditioned reinforcer. However, with a tone CS all rats learned a goal-tracking response, and the tone CS was an equally effective conditioned reinforcer in sign-trackers and goal-trackers. Even when presented in compound (a lever-tone CS), the two elements of the compound differentially acquired motivational properties. In contrast, amphetamine and stress potentiated the conditioned reinforcing properties of both visual and auditory CSs similarly in rats that primarily sign-tracked or goal-tracked. We conclude that variation in the to the ability of CSs to acquire incentive salience, and thus their ability to act as incentive stimuli capable of motivating behavior, is determined in part by properties of the CS itself."
https://openalex.org/W2122549120,"Rationale Poor adherence to inhaler use can be due to poor temporal and/or technique adherence. Up until now there has been no way of reliably tracking both these factors in everyday inhaler use. Objectives This paper introduces a device developed to create time stamped acoustic recordings of an individual's inhaler use, in which empirical evidence of temporal and technique adherence in inhaler use can be monitored over time. The correlation between clinical outcomes and adherence, as determined by this device, was compared for temporal adherence alone and combined temporal and technique adherence. Findings The technology was validated by showing that the doses taken matched the number of audio recordings (r2 = 0.94, p<0.01). To demonstrate that audio analysis of inhaler use gives objective information, in vitro studies were performed. These showed that acoustic profiles of inhalations correlated with the peak inspiratory flow rate (r2 = 0.97, p<0.01), and that the acoustic energy of exhalations into the inhaler was related to the amount of drug removed. Despite training, 16% of participants exhaled into the mouthpiece after priming, in >20% of their inhaler events. Repeated training reduced this to 7% of participants (p = 0.03). When time of use was considered, there was no evidence of a relationship between adherence and changes in AQLQ (r2 = 0.2) or PEFR (r2 = 0.2). Combining time and technique the rate of adherence was related to changes in AQLQ (r2 = 0.53, p = 0.01) and PEFR (r2 = 0.29, p = 0.01). Conclusions This study presents a novel method to objectively assess how errors in both time and technique of inhaler use impact on clinical outcomes. Trial Registration EudraCT 2011-004149-42"
https://openalex.org/W2022545956,"Mitochondrial dysfunction caused by amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Substantial evidence has indicated that the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening is involved in Aβ-induced neuronal death and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), one of the major active constituents of Astragalus membranaceus, has been reported as an effective anti-oxidant for treating neurodegenerative diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms still need to be clarified. In this study, we investigated whether AS-IV could prevent Aβ1-42-induced neurotoxicity in SK-N-SH cells via inhibiting the mPTP opening. The results showed that pretreatment of AS-IV significantly increased the viability of neuronal cells, reduced apoptosis, decreased the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased mitochondrial superoxide in the presence of Aβ1-42. In addition, pretreatment of AS-IV inhibited the mPTP opening, rescued mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), enhanced ATP generation, improved the activity of cytochrome c oxidase and blocked cytochrome c release from mitochondria in Aβ1-42 rich milieu. Moreover, pretreatment of AS-IV reduced the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 and increased the expression of Bcl-2 in an Aβ1-42 rich environment. These data indicate that AS-IV prevents Aβ1-42-induced SK-N-SH cell apoptosis via inhibiting the mPTP opening and ROS generation. These results provide novel insights of AS-IV for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as AD."
https://openalex.org/W2093078248,"Groupers species are extremely vulnerable to overfishing and many species are threatened worldwide. In recent decades, Mediterranean groupers experienced dramatic population declines. Marine protected areas (MPAs) can protect populations inside their boundaries and provide individuals to adjacent fishing areas through the process of spillover and larval export. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of six marine reserves in the Western Mediterranean Sea to protect the populations of three species of grouper, Epinephelus marginatus, Epinephelus costae and Mycteroperca rubra, and to understand in which circumstances MPAs are able to export biomass to neighbouring areas. All the studied MPAs, except one where no grouper was observed, were able to maintain high abundance, biomass and mean weight of groupers. Size classes were more evenly distributed inside than outside MPAs. In two reserves, biomass gradients could be detected through the boundaries of the reserve as an indication of spillover. In some cases, habitat structure appeared to exert a great influence on grouper abundance, biomass and mean individual weight, influencing the gradient shape. Because groupers are generally sedentary animals with a small home range, we suggest that biomass gradients could only occur where groupers attain sufficient abundance inside MPA limits, indicating a strongly density-dependent process."

Risk factors for postoperative mortality in 266 consecutive liver transplantations were identified using univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients who were <18 years, HU-listings, and split-, living related, combined or re-transplantations were excluded from the analysis. The correlation between number of risk factors and mortality was analyzed.A labMELD ≥20, female sex, coronary heart disease, donor risk index >1.5 and donor Na+>145 mmol/L were identified to be independent predictive factors for postoperative mortality. With increasing number of these risk-factors, postoperative 90-day and 1-year mortality increased (0-1: 0 and 0%; 2: 2.9 and 17.4%; 3: 5.6 and 16.8%; 4: 22.2 and 33.3%; 5-6: 60.9 and 66.2%).In this analysis, a simple score was derived that adequately identified patients at risk after liver transplantation.

https://openalex.org/W2117971476,"A hypoxic microenvironment in tumors has been recognized as a cause of malignancy or resistance to various cancer therapies. In contrast to recent progress in understanding the acute response of cancer cells to hypoxia, the characteristics of tumor cells in chronic hypoxia remain elusive. We have identified a pancreatic cancer cell line, AsPC-1, that is exceptionally able to survive for weeks under 1% oxygen conditions while most tested cancer cell lines die after only some days under these conditions. In chronic hypoxia, AsPC-1 cells entered a state of dormancy characterized by no proliferation, no death, and metabolic suppression. They reversibly switched to active status after being placed again in optimal culture conditions. ATP turnover, an indicator of energy demand, was markedly decreased and accompanied by reduced AKT phosphorylation. Forced activation of AKT resulted in increased ATP turnover and massive cell death in vitro and a decreased number of dormant cells in vivo. In contrast to most cancer cell lines, primary-cultured colorectal cancer cells easily entered the dormant status with AKT suppression under hypoxia combined with growth factor–depleted conditions. Primary colorectal cancer cells in dormancy were resistant to chemotherapy. Thus, the ability to survive in a deteriorated microenvironment by entering into dormancy under chronic hypoxia might be a common property among cancer cells. Targeting the regulatory mechanism inducing this dormant status could provide a new strategy for treating cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1981880326,"Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) has been demonstrated to be present in several tissues and cells unrelated to systemic calcium homeostasis, where it regulates a series of diverse cellular functions. A previous study indicated that CaSR is expressed in mouse glomerular mesangial cells (MCs), and stimulation of CaSR induces cell proliferation. However, the signaling cascades initiated by CaSR activation in MCs are currently unknown. In this study, our data demonstrate that CaSR mRNA and protein are expressed in a human mesangial cell line. Activating CaSR with high extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) or spermine induces a phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Interestingly, the CaSR activation-induced increase in [Ca2+]i results not only from intracellular Ca2+ release from internal stores but also from canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC)-dependent Ca2+ influx. This increase in Ca2+ was attenuated by treatment with a nonselective TRPC channel blocker but not by treatment with a voltage-gated calcium blocker or Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inhibitor. Furthermore, stimulation of CaSR by high [Ca2+]o enhanced the expression of TRPC3 and TRPC6 but not TRPC1 and TRPC4, and siRNA targeting TRPC3 and TRPC6 attenuated the CaSR activation-induced [Ca2+]i increase. Further experiments indicate that 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), a known activator of receptor-operated calcium channels, significantly enhances the CaSR activation-induced [Ca2+]i increase. Moreover, under conditions in which intracellular stores were already depleted with thapsigargin (TG), CaSR agonists also induced an increase in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that calcium influx stimulated by CaSR agonists does not require the release of calcium stores. Finally, our data indicate that pharmacological inhibition and knock down of TRPC3 and TRPC6 attenuates the CaSR activation-induced cell proliferation in human MCs. With these data, we conclude that CaSR activation mediates Ca2+ influx and cell proliferation via TRPC3 and TRPC6 in human MCs."
https://openalex.org/W1970633886,"Mating and reproductive outcome is often determined by the simultaneous operation of different mechanisms like intra-sexual competition, mating preferences and sexual coercion. The present study investigated how social variables affected mating outcome in a pack of free-ranging dogs, a species supposed to have lost most features of the social system of wolves during domestication. We found that, although the pack comprised multiple breeding individuals, both male copulation success and female reproductive success were positively influenced by a linear combination of dominance rank, age and leadership. Our results also suggest that mate preferences affect mating outcome by reinforcing the success of most dominant individuals. In particular, during their oestrous period bitches clearly searched for the proximity of high-ranking males who displayed affiliative behaviour towards them, while they were more likely to reject the males who intimidated them. At the same time, male courting effort and male-male competition for receptive females appeared to be stronger in the presence of higher-ranking females, suggesting a male preference for dominant females. To our knowledge, these results provide the first clear evidence of social regulation of reproductive activities in domestic dogs, and suggest that some common organizing mechanisms may contribute to shape the social organization of both dogs and wolves."

Few studies have assessed beta-(1,3)-d-glucan (beta-glucan), a significant fungal cell wall constituent, in relation to asthma in adolescence. Objective To determine whether house dust-derived beta-glucan exposure at age 7–10 is associated with the development and persistence of atopic and non-atopic asthma, and bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) by age 11–14. Methods Dust samples were collected from the 1995 Study of Asthma, Genes, and Environment (SAGE) birth cohort. This cohort was derived from Manitoba provincial healthcare administrative records of children high and low risk for asthma. Samples were collected from the homes of 422 children at age 7–10 and analyzed using beta-glucan and endotoxin-specific Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate assays. Asthma, atopy, and BHR status of each child were also assessed at ages 7–10 and 11–14. Results At age 7–10, beta-glucan dust levels in the home were associated with persistent atopic asthma at age 11–14 (OR 1.79 for each unit increase in levels, 95% CI 1.14–2.81), independent of endotoxin exposure, and Alternaria or Cladosporium sensitization. The likelihood of BHR almost doubled with unit increases in dust beta-glucan in asthmatic children. In children without asthma, exposure to high beta-glucan levels at age 7–10 also elevated risk for BHR in adolescence (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.05–2.89). New-onset atopic asthma was twice more likely following high beta-glucan exposure in children without asthma but the association did not reach statistical significance. No associations were evident with concurrent asthma phenotype at age 7–10 or non-atopic asthma at age 11–14. Conclusion These findings implicate home beta-glucan exposure at school-age as a risk factor for persistent atopic asthma and new-onset BHR. The higher prevalence of BHR in urban adolescents may be propagated by this home exposure."

Fifty male and fifty female participants (‘perceivers’) completed the Autism-Spectrum Quotient and the Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale to assess autism spectrum traits and trait affective empathy, respectively. EA was assessed using a Dutch-language version of a previously developed task and involved rating the feelings of others (‘targets’) verbally recounting autobiographical emotional events. Targets varied in trait emotional expressivity, assessed using the Berkeley Expressivity Questionnaire. Perceivers with more autism spectrum traits performed worse on the EA task, particularly when their trait affective empathy was relatively low. Interpersonal deficits in autism spectrum disorder may be partially explained by low cognitive empathy. Further, they might be aggravated by a limited capacity for affective empathy."

Design and Methods A total of 1,272 overweight and obese participants (BMI: 31±5 kg/m2), aged 20 to 65 years, attending outpatient weight-loss clinics were recruited for this analysis. Emotional eating behavior was assessed by the Emotional Eating Questionnaire (EEQ), a questionnaire validated for overweight and obese Spanish subjects. Anthropometric measures, dietary intake and weight-loss progression were assessed and analyzed throughout the 30-week program. Multivariate analysis and linear regression models were performed to test for gene-environment interaction. Results Weight-loss progression during the 30-week program differed significantly according to the degree of emotional eating behavior. Participants classified as ‘very emotional eaters’ experienced more irregular (P = 0.007) weight-loss, with a lower rate of weight decline (−0.002 vs. −0.003, P<0.05) in comparison with less emotional eaters. The percentage of weight-loss was also significantly higher in ‘non-emotional eaters’ (P = 0.009). Additionally, we identified a significant gene-environment interaction associated with weight-loss at the CLOCK 3111 T/C locus (P = 0.017). By dichotomizing the emotional eating behavior score, linear regression analysis indicated that minor C allele carriers with a high emotional score (> = 11), lost significantly less weight than those C carriers with a low emotional score (<11) (P = 0.005). Conclusions Emotional eating behavior associates with weight-loss pattern, progression and total weight-loss. Additionally, CLOCK 3111 T/C SNP interacts with emotional eating behavior to modulate total weight loss. These results suggest that the assessment of this locus and emotional eating behavior could improve the development of effective, long-tern weight-management interventions."

At the end of treatment, fundoscopic findings, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the eyeball, VEGF levels in the ocular fluid, and any structural abnormalities in the retina were assessed. Glucose metabolism, serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP1), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels were also measured. Treatment with LAB prevented vascular leakage and basement membrane thickening in retinal capillaries in a dose-dependent manner. Insulin resistance and glucose intolerance were significantly improved by LAB treatment. The levels of serum hsCRP, MCP1, TNFα, and urinary 8-OHdG were lower in the LAB-treated OLETF rats than in the controls.Treatment with LAB had a preventive effect on the development of diabetic retinopathy in this animal model, probably because of its antioxidative effects and anti-inflammatory effects."

Method Thirty six rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups: PCOS rats with high-fat diet (PF, n = 24), PCOS rats with ordinary diet (PO, n = 6), and control rats with ordinary diet (CO, n = 6). Two kinds of PCOS rat model were made by adjustment diet structure and testosterone injection for 28 days. After a successful animal model, PF model rats were randomly assigned to three groups: exercise with a continuation of high-fat diet (PF-EF, n = 6), sedentary with a continuation of high-fat diet (PF-SF, n = 6), exercise with an ordinary diet (PF-EO, n = 6). Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and insulin (FINS), estrogen (E2), progesterone (P), and testosterone (T) in serum were determined by RIA, and ovarian morphology was evaluated by Image-Pro plus 6.0. Results Body weight, Lee index, FINS increased significantly in PF rat model. Serum levels of E2 and T were significantly higher in PF and PO than in CO. Ovary organ index and ovarian areas were significant lower in PF than in CO. After intervention for 2 weeks, the levels of 1 h postprandial blood glucose (PBG1), 2 h postprandial blood glucose (PBG2), FINS and the serum levels of T decreased significantly in PF-EF rats and PF-EO rats. The ratio of FBG/FINS was significant higher in PF-EO rats than in PF-SF rats. Ovarian morphology showed that the numbers of preantral follicles and atretic follicles decreased significantly, and the numbers of antral follicles and corpora lutea increased significantly in the rats of PF-EF and PF-EO. Conclusion By combination of high-fat diet and testosterone injection, the obese PCOS rat model is conformable with the lifestyle habits of fatty foods and insufficient exercise, and has metabolic and reproductive characteristics of human PCOS. This model can be applied to study exercise intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2010982696,"Quercetin is a plant-derived flavonoid that is widely distributed in nature. The present study is designed to analyze the underlying mechanism in the protection of quercetin against pyrrolizidine alkaloid clivorine-induced acute liver injury in vivo. Serum transaminases, total bilirubin analysis, and liver histological evaluation demonstrated the protection of quercetin against clivorine-induced liver injury. Terminal dUTP nick end-labeling assay demonstrated that quercetin reduced the increased amount of liver apoptotic cells induced by clivorine. Western-blot analysis of caspase-3 showed that quercetin inhibited the cleaved activation of caspase-3 induced by clivorine. Results also showed that quercetin reduced the increase in liver glutathione and lipid peroxidative product malondialdehyde induced by clivorine. Quercetin reduced the enhanced liver immunohistochemical staining for 4-hydroxynonenal induced by clivorine. Results of the Mouse Stress and Toxicity PathwayFinder RT2 Profiler PCR Array demonstrated that the expression of genes related with oxidative or metabolic stress and heat shock was obviously altered after quercetin treatment. Some of the alterations were confirmed by real-time PCR. Our results demonstrated that quercetin prevents clivorine-induced acute liver injury in vivo by inhibiting apoptotic cell death and ameliorating oxidative stress injury. This protection may be caused by the elevation of the body defense capacity induced by quercetin."
https://openalex.org/W2013712329,"In this study, we compared the influence of GDP and GTP on isolated mitochondria respiring under conditions favoring oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and under conditions excluding this process, i.e., in the presence of carboxyatractyloside, an adenine nucleotide translocase inhibitor, and/or oligomycin, an FOF1-ATP synthase inhibitor. Using mitochondria isolated from rat kidney and human endothelial cells, we found that the action of GDP and GTP can differ diametrically depending on the conditions. Namely, under conditions favoring OXPHOS, both in the absence and presence of linoleic acid, an activator of uncoupling proteins (UCPs), the addition of 1 mM GDP resulted in the state 4 (non-phosphorylating respiration)-state 3 (phosphorylating respiration) transition, which is characteristic of ADP oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast, the addition of 1 mM GTP resulted in a decrease in the respiratory rate and an increase in the membrane potential, which is characteristic of UCP inhibition. The stimulatory effect of GDP, but not GTP, was also observed in inside-out submitochondrial particles prepared from rat kidney mitochondria. However, the effects of GDP and GTP were more similar in the presence of OXPHOS inhibitors. The importance of these observations in connection with the action of UCPs, adenine nucleotide translocase (or other carboxyatractyloside-sensitive carriers), carboxyatractyloside- and purine nucleotide-insensitive carriers, as well as nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDPK) are considered. Because the measurements favoring oxidative phosphorylation better reflect in vivo conditions, our study strongly supports the idea that GDP cannot be considered a significant physiological inhibitor of UCP. Moreover, it appears that, under native conditions, GTP functions as a more efficient UCP inhibitor than GDP and ATP."
https://openalex.org/W2042609916,"Recent large-scale transcriptome analyses have found large numbers of transcripts, including that of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are aberrant in various diseases, especially cancers. However, it is not clear whether lncRNAs are involved specifically in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We investigated the expression patterns of lncRNAs in five RCC tumor samples (T) relative to those of matched adjacent non-tumor tissues (N) via microarray.A microarray with 33,045 lncRNA probes and 30,215 mRNA probes was used to identify deregulated lncRNAs in five RCC patients. Furthermore, we confirmed the relative expression levels of AK096725 and ENST00000453068 in 70 paired samples by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).The lncRNA microarray revealed 27,279 lncRNAs in RCC samples, of which 480 were significantly upregulated (P<0.05; T/N>1.5) and 417 were significantly downregulated (P<0.05; N/T>1.5) compared with the matched non-tumor samples. In addition, 19,995 mRNAs were detected, of which 458 were significantly upregulated (P<0.05; T/N>1.5) and 413 were significantly downregulated (P<0.05; N/T>1.5). The expression level changes of AK096725 (P = 0.043) and ENST00000453068 (P<0.001) in 70 paired samples were in accord with the microarray data.The study uncovered expression patterns of lncRNAs in 5 RCC patients, as well as a number of aberrant lncRNAs and mRNAs in tumor samples compared with the non-tumor tissues. The revelation of an association between AK096725 expression and RCC is especially noteworthy. These findings may help to find new biomarkers in RCC."
https://openalex.org/W2059355474,"Objectives Community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus necrotizing pneumonia is a life-threatening disease. Panton Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) has been associated with necrotizing pneumonia. PVL triggers inflammasome activation in human macrophages leading to IL-1β release. IL-1β activates lung epithelial cells to release IL-8. This study aimed to assess the relevance of this inflammatory cascade in vivo and to test the potential of an IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra/Kineret) to decrease inflammation-mediated lung injury. Methods We used the sequential instillation of Heat-killed S. aureus and PVL or S. aureus infection to trigger necrotizing pneumonia in rabbits. In these models, we investigated inflammation in the presence or absence of IL-1Ra/Kineret. Results We demonstrated that the presence of PVL was associated with IL-1β and IL-8 release in the lung. During PVL-mediated sterile pneumonia, Kineret/IL-1Ra reduced IL-8 production indicating the relevance of the PVL/IL-1/IL-8 cascade in vivo and the potential of Kineret/IL-1Ra to reduce lung inflammation. However, Kineret/IL-1Ra was ineffective in blocking IL-8 production during infection with S. aureus. Furthermore, treatment with Kineret increased the bacterial burden in the lung. Conclusions Our data demonstrate PVL-dependent inflammasome activation during S.aureus pneumonia, indicate that IL-1 signaling controls bacterial burden in the lung and suggest that therapy aimed at targeting this pathway might be deleterious during pneumonia."

This approach combines JADE source separation and binary decision tree for identification and subsequent ECG noise removal. In order to to test the efficiency of this method comparison to standard filtering a wavelet- based de-noising method was used. Freely data available at Physionet medical data storage were evaluated. Evaluation criteria was root mean square error (RMSE) between original ECG and filtered data contaminated with artificial noise. Proposed algorithm achieved comparable result in terms of standard noises (power line interference, base line wander, EMG), but noticeably significantly better results were achieved when uncommon noise (electrode cable movement artefact) were compared."
https://openalex.org/W2055423905,"Sex hormones have diverse immunomodulatory effects that may be involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis. However, the roles of serum sex hormones in predicting outcomes and the severity of organ dysfunction, especially acute kidney injury (AKI), in septic shock patients remains controversial. We prospectively enrolled 107 clinically diagnosed pneumonia-related septic shock patients and serum sex hormone levels were measured on the day of shock onset. The aim of the present study was to investigate the predictive values of serum sex hormones levels for 28-day mortality and organs dysfunction, especially AKI. Compared with survivors, serum levels of progesterone (p<0.001) and estradiol (p<0.001) were significantly elevated in non-survivors. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, serum level of estradiol >40 pg/mL (p = 0.047) and APACHE II score ≥25 (p = <0.001) were found to be independent predictors of day 28 mortality. Inclusion of estradiol levels further enhanced the ability of APACHE II scores to predict survival in patients with high mortality risk. A serum level of estradiol >40 pg/mL was also an independent predictor of concomitant AKI (p = 0.002) and correlated well with severity of renal dysfunction using RIFLE classification. Elevated serum estradiol levels also predicted the development of new AKI within 28 days of shock onset (p = 0.013). In conclusion, serum estradiol levels appear to have value in predicting 28-day mortality in septic shock patients. Increased serum estradiol levels are associated with higher severity of concomitant AKI and predict development of new AKI."
https://openalex.org/W2060769610,"In response to peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells adopt a migratory phenotype and modify the extracellular matrix to make it permissive for cell migration and axonal re-growth. Uridine 5'-triphosphate (UTP) and other nucleotides are released during nerve injury and activate purinergic receptors expressed on the Schwann cell surface, but little is known about the involvement of purine signalling in wound healing. We studied the effect of UTP on Schwannoma cell migration and wound closure and the intracellular signaling pathways involved. We found that UTP treatment induced Schwannoma cell migration through activation of P2Y2 receptors and through the increase of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activation and expression. Knockdown P2Y2 receptor or MMP-2 expression greatly reduced wound closure and MMP-2 activation induced by UTP. MMP-2 activation evoked by injury or UTP was also mediated by phosphorylation of all 3 major mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs): JNK, ERK1/2, and p38. Inhibition of these MAPK pathways decreased both MMP-2 activation and cell migration. Interestingly, MAPK phosphorylation evoked by UTP exhibited a biphasic pattern, with an early transient phosphorylation 5 min after treatment, and a late and sustained phosphorylation that appeared at 6 h and lasted up to 24 h. Inhibition of MMP-2 activity selectively blocked the late, but not the transient, phase of MAPK activation. These results suggest that MMP-2 activation and late MAPK phosphorylation are part of a positive feedback mechanism to maintain the migratory phenotype for wound healing. In conclusion, our findings show that treatment with UTP stimulates in vitro Schwannoma cell migration and wound repair through a MMP-2-dependent mechanism via P2Y2 receptors and MAPK pathway activation."
https://openalex.org/W2149870666,"The APOBEC3 family of DNA cytosine deaminases functions to block the spread of endogenous retroelements and retroviruses including HIV-1. Potency varies among family members depending on the type of parasitic substrate. APOBEC3A (A3A) is unique among the human enzymes in that it is expressed predominantly in myeloid lineage cell types, it is strongly induced by innate immune agonists such as type 1 interferon, and it has the capacity to accommodate both normal and 5-methyl cytosine nucleobases. Here we apply atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterize the interaction between A3A and single- and double-stranded DNA using a hybrid DNA approach in which a single-stranded region is flanked by defined length duplexes. AFM image analyses reveal A3A binding to single-stranded DNA, and that this interaction becomes most evident (∼80% complex yield) at high protein-to-DNA ratios (at least 100∶1). A3A is predominantly monomeric when bound to single-stranded DNA, and it is also monomeric in solution at concentrations as high as 50 nM. These properties agree well with recent, biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies. However, these characteristics contrast with those of the related enzyme APOBEC3G, which in similar assays can exist as a monomer but tends to form oligomers in a concentration-dependent manner. These AFM data indicate that A3A has intrinsic biophysical differences that distinguish it from APOBEC3G. The potential relationships between these properties and biological functions in innate immunity are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2030118095,"The development of curative therapies for genetically complex diseases such as ALS has been delayed by the lack of relevant disease models. Recent advances using induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived motoneurons from patients harboring distinct ALS mutations have recapitulated essential disease features and have identified some common pathways driving disease pathogenesis. The development of curative therapies for genetically complex diseases such as ALS has been delayed by the lack of relevant disease models. Recent advances using induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived motoneurons from patients harboring distinct ALS mutations have recapitulated essential disease features and have identified some common pathways driving disease pathogenesis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder involving the loss of motoneurons in the spinal cord and motor cortex, leading to paralysis and premature death. Whereas most ALS cases are sporadic (sALS), around 10% are considered familial and mainly inherited in a dominant manner (fALS), involving mutations in more than two dozen genes, including superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), Tar DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43), fused-in-sarcoma (FUS), and C9orf72. The biology of ALS is very complex; however, it is known that the pathology is specific to motor neurons. Multiple pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to the selective motoneuron degeneration, including alterations in RNA metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal protein aggregation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, excitotoxicity, axonal transport defects, and gliosis, among other events. Most cellular and animal models of ALS involve the expression of supraphysiological levels of human transgenes, mostly involving mutant SOD1 and TDP-43, which contrasts with the single allele alteration observed in fALS cases. Although these ALS models have been fundamental to investigate disease pathogenesis, drugs identified to abrogate or delay experimental ALS using these models have failed in clinical trials. These shortcomings underscore the need for novel model systems to assess unique events that may underlie the selective neuronal vulnerability observed in human cells. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from ALS patients and differentiated into motoneurons represent a promising new tool for studying ALS disease pathology. Using stem cell approaches, three recent studies reported in Cell Stem Cell (Kiskinis et al., 2014Kiskinis E. Sandoe J. Williams L.A. Boulting G.L. Moccia R. Wainger B.J. Han S. Peng T. Thams S.

Remarkably, common pathways of degeneration have emerged through these studies (Figure 1), opening the possibility of new and effective drug screening. Kiskinis et al., 2014Kiskinis E. Sandoe J.

Both studies developed a well-controlled cellular system by combining genetic correction of the SOD1 mutation and whole-genome sequencing to ensure the isogenic backgrounds of their samples. The authors generated highly enriched and electrophysiologically active motoneuron cultures and recapitulated the spontaneous and progressive decrease in cell viability observed in humans, verifying that the phenotype was dependent on the expression of mutant SOD1 (Kiskinis et al., 2014Kiskinis E. Sandoe J. Williams L.A. Boulting G.L. Moccia R. Wainger B.J. Han S. Peng T. Thams S.

ALS-related morphological changes were recapitulated in vitro, including the reduction in soma size and altered dendrites, which was linked to the deregulation and aggregation of neurofilaments, an event that preceded the occurrence of neuronal apoptosis (Chen et al., 2014Chen H. Qian K. Du Z. Cao J. Petersen A. Liu H. Blackbourn L.W.t. Huang C.L. Errigo A. Yin Y. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14 (this issue): 796-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Although mutant SOD1 aggregation is thought to be a key molecular event driving neurotoxicity, in these two studies the levels of mutant SOD1 aggregation were extremely low and only detected after inhibiting the proteasome or by extremely sensitive methods (e.g., immunogold staining followed by electron microscopy analysis), consistent with the idea that soluble oligomeric forms of mutant SOD1 are the pathogenic species. Membrane hyperexcitability is a characteristic and predictive feature of ALS. Wainger et al., 2014Wainger B.J. Kiskinis E. Mellin C. Wiskow O. Han S.S. Sandoe J. Perez N.P. Williams L.A. Lee S. Boulting G. et al.Cell Rep. 2014; 7: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar demonstrated that iPSC-derived motoneurons from patients carrying SOD1, C9orf72, or FUS mutations all reproduce the spontaneous hyperexcitability observed in disease in culture, making them a useful tool for future in vitro drug screenings. Importantly, pharmacological testing revealed that the clinically approved anticonvulsant drug retigabine reversed the pathogenic phenotype and improved the survival of human motoneurons expressing mutant SOD1. In an effort to define global perturbations in cell homeostasis, Kiskinis et al., 2014Kiskinis E. Sandoe J. Williams L.A. Boulting G.L. Moccia R. Wainger B.J. Han S. Peng T. Thams S. Mikkilineni S. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14 (this issue): 781-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar measured the changes in gene expression triggered in mutant SOD1-expressing motoneurons. Several gene clusters were misregulated in fALS neurons, involving proteins related to cytoskeleton, mitochondrial, and proteostasis control. The latter observation, and a vast body of functional studies in ALS (Hetz and Mollereau, 2014Hetz C. Mollereau B. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), led the authors to explore the contribution of ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) to mutant SOD1 pathogenesis, demonstrating a positive impact on neuronal survival and morphogenesis (Kiskinis et al., 2014Kiskinis E. Sandoe J. Williams L.A. Boulting G.L. Moccia R. Wainger B.J. Han S. Peng T. Thams S. Mikkilineni S. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14 (this issue): 781-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Using pharmacological approaches to modulate ion channels, a functional link between the electrical activity of motoneurons and the occurrence of basal ER stress was provided. In addition, targeting the UPR altered the conductivity of motoneurons, suggesting feedforward mechanisms. Finally, the authors confirmed that a subset of these transcriptional responses is conserved in motoneurons expressing a C9orf72 mutation, the most common genetic alteration in ALS, thus increasing the overall implications of these findings for a variety of ALS genetic subtypes. Recent studies have attempted to develop a model of sALS using iPSCs. Remarkably, iPSCs derived from sALS patients presented de novo TDP-43 intranuclear inclusions on a subgroup of clones (Burkhardt et al., 2013Burkhardt M.F. Martinez F.J. Wright S. Ramos C. Volfson D. Mason M. Garnes J. Dang V. Lievers J. Shoukat-Mumtaz U. et al.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2013; 56: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), which represents the most common histopathological hallmark of ALS. The authors used this abnormal parameter to screen a library of FDA-approved compounds. Similarly, a drug screening was performed to identify small molecules that improve survival of motoneurons expressing mutant SOD1 (Yang et al., 2013Yang Y.M. Gupta S.K. Kim K.J. Powers B.E. Cerqueira A. Wainger B.J. Ngo H.D. Rosowski K.A. Schein P.A. Ackeifi C.A. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 713-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Other studies obtained conflicting results when motoneurons were generated with iPSCs from ALS patients carrying TDP-43 mutations. In one report, ALS motoneurons underwent cell death, correlating with the accumulation of TDP-43 aggregates (Bilican et al., 2012Bilican B. Serio A. Barmada S.J. Nishimura A.L. Sullivan G.J. Carrasco M. Phatnani H.P. Puddifoot C.A. Story D. Fletcher J. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 5803-5808Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), whereas another group did not detect any spontaneous apoptosis, but observed dendrite alterations and enhanced vulnerability to oxidative stress (Egawa et al., 2012Egawa N. Kitaoka S. Tsukita K. Naitoh M. Takahashi K. Yamamoto T. Adachi F. Kondo T. Okita K. Asaka I. et al.Sci Transl Med. 2012; 4: 145ra104Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Similarly, two recent studies showed the presence of abnormal RNA foci and the accumulation of non-ATG-dependent translation peptides in iPSC-derived motoneurons from patients carrying C9orf72 mutations (Donnelly et al., 2013Donnelly C.J. Zhang P.W. Pham J.T. Heusler A.R. Mistry N.A. Vidensky S. Daley E.L. Poth E.M. Hoover B. Fines D.M. et al.Neuron. 2013; 80: 415-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, Sareen et al., 2013Sareen D. O’Rourke J.G. Meera P. Muhammad A.K. Grant S. Simpkinson M. Bell S. Carmona S. Ornelas L. Sahabian A. et al.Sci Transl Med. 2013; 5: 208ra149Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). These cells were more susceptible to glutamate toxicity and presented global alterations in RNA metabolism, which was reverted by antisense oligonucleotides to target C9orf72 mRNA. Taken together, these studies reveal that iPSC-derived motoneurons from ALS patients develop common pathological features resembling early stages of the disease that could be used to test novel therapeutic strategies, and they support the occurrence of an intrinsic vulnerability to stress. They also caution that the appearance of morphological changes does not always culminate in motoneuron loss. These reports additionally suggest a substantial prevalence of gain-of-toxic and cell-autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration in ALS. The current studies illustrate that the use of combinatorial approaches to study iPSC-derived motoneurons offers a well-controlled cell culture model of ALS. The identification of robust and inherited morphological, biochemical, and electrophysiological phenotypes in iPSC-derived neurons supports and sometimes contrasts with the well-established animal models of the disease and will open the possibility of developing novel drug screenings with therapeutic potential and the identification of novel biomarkers of ALS. These advances will also facilitate the future generation of personalized medicine through the testing of drugs to alleviate selective pathological events that may be unique to the specific genetic landscape of each patient, opening important avenues for the treatment of this fatal disease.

Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed that Peroxiredoxin-I (Prx-I) was significantly down-regulated in bladder cancer after treatment. Prx-I silencing by transfection of Prx-I shRNA significantly suppressed growth, promoted apoptosis and regulated the cell cycle in T24 cells and reduced the phospho-NF-κB p50 and p65 protein expression which revealed the links between Prx-I and NF-κB pathway implied by Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). These findings yield new insights into the therapy of bladder cancer, revealing Prx-I as a new therapeutic target and indicating BI-TK/GCV system as a prospective therapy by down-regulation of Prx-I through NF-κB signaling pathway."

Here, we demonstrate that HCV replication complex along with NS5A and Core protein was transported to the lipid droplet (LD) through microtubules, and NS5A-Core complexes were then transported from LD through early-to-late endosomes to the plasma membrane via microtubules. Further studies by cofractionation analysis and immunoelectron microscopy of the released particles showed that NS5A-Core complexes, but not NS4B, were present in the low-density fractions, but not in the high-density fractions, of the HCV RNA-containing virions and associated with the internal virion core. Furthermore, exosomal markers CD63 and CD81 were also detected in the low-density fractions, but not in the high-density fractions. Overall, our results suggest that HCV NS5A is associated with the core of the low-density virus particles which exit the cell through a preexisting endosome/exosome pathway and may contribute to HCV natural infection."
https://openalex.org/W2010263609,"Synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SCP3), a member of Cor1 family, is up-regulated in various cancer cells; however, its oncogenic potential and clinical significance has not yet been characterized. In the present study, we investigated the oncogenic role of SCP3 and its relationship with phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) in cervical neoplasias. The functional role of SCP3 expression was investigated by overexpression or knockdown of SCP3 in murine cell line NIH3T3 and human cervical cancer cell lines CUMC6, SiHa, CaSki, and HeLa both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we examined SCP3 expression in tumor specimens from 181 cervical cancer and 400 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) patients by immunohistochemistry and analyzed the correlation between SCP3 expression and clinicopathologic factors or survival. Overexpression of SCP3 promoted AKT-mediated tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Functional studies using NIH3T3 cells demonstrated that the C-terminal region of human SCP3 is important for AKT activation and its oncogenic potential. High expression of SCP3 was significantly associated with tumor stage (P = 0.002) and tumor grade (P<0.001), while SCP3 expression was positively associated with pAKT protein level in cervical neoplasias. Survival times for patients with cervical cancer overexpressing both SCP3 and pAKT (median, 134.0 months, n = 68) were significantly shorter than for patients with low expression of either SCP3 or pAKT (161.5 months, n = 108) as determined by multivariate analysis (P = 0.020). Our findings suggest that SCP3 plays an important role in the progression of cervical cancer through the AKT signaling pathway, supporting the possibility that SCP3 may be a promising novel cancer target for cervical cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2048672748,"Purpose Optical imaging techniques for measuring tissue hemoglobin concentration have been recently accepted as a way to assess tumor vascularity and oxygenation. We investigated the correlation between early optical response to single-agent bevacizumab and treatment outcome. Methods Seven patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer were treated with single-agent bevacizumab followed by addition of weekly paclitaxel. Optical imaging of patient's breasts was performed to measure tumor total hemoglobin concentration (tHb) and oxygen saturation (stO2) at baseline and on days 1, 3, 6, 8, and 13 after the first infusion of bevacizumab. To assess early metabolic response, 2-deoxy-2-(18F)-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), 18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO)-PET/CT, and magnetic resonance imaging were performed at baseline and after two cycles of the regimen. Results Seven patients were grouped as responders (n = 4) and nonresponders (n = 3) on the basis of metabolic response measured by FDG-PET/CT. The responders showed remarkable tumor shrinkage and low accumulations of FMISO tracer relative to those of the nonresponders at the completion of two cycles of chemotherapy. Tumors of both groups showed remarkable attenuation of mean tHb as early as day 1 after therapy initiation. The nonresponders had lower baseline stO2 levels compared with adjacent breast tissue stO2 levels along with a pattern of steadily low stO2 levels during the observation window. On the other hand, the responders appeared to sustain high stO2 levels with temporal fluctuation. Conclusions Low tumor stO2 level after single-agent bevacizumab treatment was characteristic of the nonresponders. Tumor stO2 level could be a predictor of an additional benefit of bevacizumab over that provided by paclitaxel."
https://openalex.org/W2145226482,"Myricaria consists of about twelve-thirteen species and occurs in Eurasian North Temperate zone, most species in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and adjacent areas.Twelve species of Myricaria plus two other genera Tamarix and Reaumuria in Tamaricaceae, were sampled, and four markers, ITS, rps16, psbB-psbH, and trnL-trnF were sequenced. The relaxed Bayesian molecular clock BEAST method was used to perform phylogenetic analysis and molecular dating, and Diva, S-Diva, and maximum likelihood Lagrange were used to estimate the ancestral area. The results indicated that Myricaria could be divided into four phylogenetic clades, which correspond to four sections within the genus, of them two are newly described in this paper. The crown age of Myricaria was dated to early Miocene ca. 20 Ma, at the probable early uplifting time of the Himalayas. The Himalayas were also shown as the center of origin for Myricaria from the optimization of ancestral distribution. Migration and dispersal of Myricaria were indicated to have taken place along the Asian Mountains, including the Himalayas, Kunlun, Altun, Hendukosh, Tianshan, Altai, and Caucasus etc., westward to Europe, eastward to Central China, and northward to the Mongolian Plateau.Myricaria spatiotemporal evolution presented here, especially the Himalayan origin at early Miocene ca. 20 Ma, and then migrated westward and eastward along the Asian mountains, offers a significant evolutionary case for QTP and Central Asian biogeography."

Method Sixteen stroke patients kept coded activity diaries and wore SenseWear Pro2 multi-sensor activity monitors during daytime hours for one day. A researcher observed the patients and completed a diary. Data from the patients' diaries were compared with observed and measured data to determine total activity (METs*minutes), activity level and total energy expenditure. Results Spearman correlations between the patients' and researchers' diaries revealed a high correlation for total METs*minutes (rs = 0.75, p<0.01) for sedentary (rs = 0.74,p<0.01) and moderate activities (rs = 0.71,p<0.01) and a very high correlation (rs = 0.92, p<0.01) for the total energy expenditure. Comparisons between the patients' diaries and activity monitor data revealed a low correlation (rs 0.29) for total METs*minutes and energy expenditure. Conclusion Coded self-monitoring activity diaries appear feasible as a low-tech alternative to labor-intensive observational diaries for determining sedentary, moderate, and total physical activity and for quantifying energy expenditure in hospitalized stroke patients. Given the poor correlation with objective measurements of physical activity, however, further research is needed to validate its use against a gold-standard measure of physical activity intensity and energy expenditure."

https://openalex.org/W1988924428,"Pregnant women become susceptible to malaria infection despite their acquired immunity to this disease from childhood. The placental sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes (IE) is the major feature of malaria during pregnancy, due to ability of these parasites to bind chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) in the placenta through the VAR2CSA protein that parasites express on the surface of IE. We collected parasites at different times of pregnancy and investigated the adhesion pattern of freshly collected isolates on the three well described host receptors (CSPG, CD36 and ICAM-1). Var genes transcription profile and VAR2CSA surface-expression were assessed in these isolates. Although adhesion of IE to CD36 and ICAM-1 was observed in some isolates, CSA-adhesion was the predominant binding feature in all isolates analyzed. Co-existence in the peripheral blood of several adhesion phenotypes in early pregnancy isolates was observed, a diversity that gradually tightens with gestational age in favour of the CSA-adhesion phenotype. Infections occurring in primigravidae were often by parasites that adhered more to CSA than those from multigravidae. Data from this study further emphasize the specificity of CSA adhesion and VAR2CSA expression by parasites responsible for pregnancy malaria, while drawing attention to the phenotypic complexity of infections occurring early in pregnancy as well as in multigravidae."
https://openalex.org/W2000001688,"Leg-extensor muscle weakness could be a key component in knee joint degeneration in the elderly because it may result in altered muscular control during locomotion influencing the mechanical environment within the joint. This work aimed to examine whether an exercise-induced enhancement of the triceps surae (TS) and quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle-tendon unit (MTU) capacities would affect mechanical and biological markers for knee osteoarthritis in the elderly.Twelve older women completed a 14-week TS and QF MTU exercise intervention, which had already been established as increasing muscle strength and tendon stiffness. Locomotion mechanics and serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) levels were examined during incline walking. MTU mechanical properties were assessed using simultaneously ultrasonography and dynamometry.Post exercise intervention, the elderly had higher TS and QF contractile strength and tendon-aponeurosis stiffness. Regarding the incline gait task, the subjects demonstrated a lower external knee adduction moment and lower knee adduction angular impulse during the stance phase post-intervention. Furthermore, post-intervention compared to pre-intervention, the elderly showed lower external hip adduction moment, but revealed higher plantarflexion pushoff moment. The changes in the external knee adduction moment were significantly correlated with the improvement in ankle pushoff function. Serum COMP concentration increased in response to the 0.5-h incline walking exercise with no differences in the magnitude of increment between pre- and post-intervention.This work emphasizes the important role played by the ankle pushoff function in knee joint mechanical loading during locomotion, and may justify the inclusion of the TS MTU in prevention programs aiming to positively influence specific mechanical markers for knee osteoarthritis in the elderly. However, the study was unable to show that COMP is amenable to change in the elderly following a 14-week exercise intervention and, therefore, the physiological benefit of improved muscle function for knee cartilage requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2066651629,"The phenazine derivative 2-hydroxyphenazine (2-OH-PHZ) plays an important role in the biocontrol of plant diseases, and exhibits stronger bacteriostatic and fungistatic activity than phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) toward some pathogens. PhzO has been shown to be responsible for the conversion of PCA to 2-OH-PHZ, however the kinetics of the reaction have not been systematically studied. Further, the yield of 2-OH-PHZ in fermentation culture is quite low and enhancement in our understanding of the reaction kinetics may contribute to improvements in large-scale, high-yield production of 2-OH-PHZ for biological control and other applications. In this study we confirmed previous reports that free PCA is converted to 2-hydroxy-phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (2-OH-PCA) by the action of a single enzyme PhzO, and particularly demonstrate that this reaction is dependent on NADP(H) and Fe3+. Fe3+ enhanced the conversion from PCA to 2-OH-PHZ and 28°C was a optimum temperature for the conversion. However, PCA added in excess to the culture inhibited the production of 2-OH-PHZ. 2-OH-PCA was extracted and purified from the broth, and it was confirmed that the decarboxylation of 2-OH-PCA could occur without the involvement of any enzyme. A kinetic analysis of the conversion of 2-OH-PCA to 2-OH-PHZ in the absence of enzyme and under different temperatures and pHs in vitro, revealed that the conversion followed first-order reaction kinetics. In the fermentation, the concentration of 2-OH-PCA increased to about 90 mg/L within a red precipitate fraction, as compared to 37 mg/L within the supernatant. The results of this study elucidate the reaction kinetics involved in the biosynthesis of 2-OH-PHZ and provide insights into in vitro methods to enhance yields of 2-OH-PHZ."
https://openalex.org/W2158581162,"Power is the ability to influence others towards the attainment of specific goals, and it is a fundamental force that shapes behavior at all levels of human existence. Several theories on the nature of power in social life exist, especially in the context of social influence. Yet, in bargaining situations, surprisingly little is known about its role in shaping social preferences. Such preferences are considered to be the main explanation for observed behavior in a wide range of experimental settings. In this work, we set out to understand the role of bargaining power in the stylized environment of a Generalized Ultimatum Game (GUG). We modify the payoff structure of the standard Ultimatum Game (UG) to investigate three situations: two in which the power balance is either against the proposer or against the responder, and a balanced situation. We find that other-regarding preferences, as measured by the amount of money donated by participants, do not change with the amount of power, but power changes the offers and acceptance rates systematically. Notably, unusually high acceptance rates for lower offers were observed. This finding suggests that social preferences may be invariant to the balance of power and confirms that the role of power on human behavior deserves more attention."
https://openalex.org/W2116074397,"The development of a rowing jellyfish biomimetic robot termed as “Robojelly”, has led to the discovery of a passive flexible flap located between the flexion point and bell margin on the Aurelia aurita. A comparative analysis of biomimetic robots showed that the presence of a passive flexible flap results in a significant increase in the swimming performance. In this work we further investigate this concept by developing varying flap geometries and comparing their kinematics with A. aurita. It was shown that the animal flap kinematics can be replicated with high fidelity using a passive structure and a flap with curved and tapered geometry gave the most biomimetic performance. A method for identifying the flap location was established by utilizing the bell curvature and the variation of curvature as a function of time. Flaps of constant cross-section and varying lengths were incorporated on the Robojelly to conduct a systematic study of the starting vortex circulation. Circulation was quantified using velocity field measurements obtained from planar Time Resolved Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (TRDPIV). The starting vortex circulation was scaled using a varying orifice model and a pitching panel model. The varying orifice model which has been traditionally considered as the better representation of jellyfish propulsion did not appear to capture the scaling of the starting vortex. In contrast, the pitching panel representation appeared to better scale the governing flow physics and revealed a strong dependence on the flap kinematics and geometry. The results suggest that an alternative description should be considered for rowing jellyfish propulsion, using a pitching panel method instead of the traditional varying orifice model. Finally, the results show the importance of incorporating the entire bell geometry as a function of time in modeling rowing jellyfish propulsion."

All patients underwent 6MWT pre- discharge and were followed up for 3 months to monitor the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the level of 6MWTD (level I>450 m, level II = 300-450 m and level III<300 m). Among the study population, the median 6MWT distance was 370 meters (interquartile range 162-462). The mean age was 60.9±10.7 years, 71.9% of them were males, 2/3 had anterior MI. only 10.5% had successful thrombolysis. Compared to patients in level I (>450 m), patients in level III (<300 m) were more likely to have clinical risk factors as hypertension, diabetes and impaired renal function. The patient's mean TIMI score was 3.4±2.2, the mean GRACE score was 150.5±27.7. There was a significant negative correlation between the 6 MWTD and GRACE risk score (r = -0.80, p<0.001). At 3 months of follow-up, 51% had MACE including 16% were dead. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that the GRACE risk score and 6MWT distance levels were the best predictors of the MACE at 3 month of follow up. The incidence of MACE was 4 times higher in patients with high GRACE risk score who couldn't walk more than 300 meters (OR = 4.66, 95% CI = 1.1-14.5, p = 0.006).In patients with STEMI treated with fibrinolysis, the addition of 6MWTD assessment pre-discharge to the traditional GRACE risk score improved the risk prediction of cardiovascular events at 3 month follow up."
https://openalex.org/W1978446971,"Background The bulk of human genes undergo alternative splicing (AS) upon response to physiological stimuli. AS is a great source of protein diversity and biological processes and is associated with the development of many diseases. Pheochromocytoma is a neuroendocrine tumor, characterized by an excessive Ca2+-dependent secretion of catecholamines. This underlines the importance of balanced control of calcium transport via regulation of gene expression pattern, including different calcium transport systems, such as plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs), abundantly expressed in pheochromocytoma chromaffin cells (PC12 cells). PMCAs are encoded by four genes (Atp2b1, Atp2b2, Atp2b3, Atp2b4), whose transcript products undergo alternative splicing giving almost 30 variants. Results In this scientific report, we propose a novel mechanism of regulation of PMCA alternative splicing in PC12 cells through cooperation of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Luciferase assays showed increased activity of NFAT in PC12 cells, which was associated with altered expression of PMCA. RT-PCR experiments suggested that inhibition of the transcriptional activity of NFAT might result in the rearrangement of PMCA splicing variants in PC12 cells. NFAT inhibition led to dominant expression of 2x/c, 3x/a and 4x/a PMCA variants, while in untreated cells the 2w,z/b, 3z,x/b,c,e,f, and 4x/b variants were found as well. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that NFAT1-HDAC4 or NFAT3-HDAC4 complexes might be involved in regulation of PMCA2x splicing variant generation. Conclusions We suggest that the influence of NFAT/HDAC on PMCA isoform composition might be important for altered dopamine secretion by PC12 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1993025430,"Background HIV patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy have undetectable viremia making it impossible to screen plasma HIV tropism if regimen change is required during suppression. We investigated the prevalence and predictors of tropism switch from CCR5-using (“R5”) to non-CCR5-using (“non-R5”) before and after viral suppression in the initially therapy-naïve HOMER cohort from British Columbia, Canada. Methods We compared pre-therapy and post-suppression viral genotypic tropism in patients who initiated on PI/NNRTI-based antiretroviral regimens between 1996-1999 (n = 462). Virologic suppression was defined as having two consecutive viral loads of <500 copies/mL, which was the sensitivity limit of most viral load assays at the time. Viral tropism was inferred by V3-loop-population-sequencing and geno2pheno[coreceptor] with cutoff at 5.75% false positive rate (FPR). Results When virologic suppression was defined as two-consecutive viral loads <500 copies/mL, 34 (9%) of the 397 patients with pre-therapy R5-virus switched to non-R5 at viral load rebound after a median of 19 months (IQR 8–41 months) of undetectable viremia. Duration of viral load suppression was not a predictor of switch, but lower CD4 count during suppression (median 400 versus 250 cells/mL) and an increased prevalence of pre-therapy non-R5 HIV by “deep” sequencing (median 0.2% versus 3.2%) were independently associated with switch (p = 0.03 and p<0.0001, respectively). Conclusion R5-to-non-R5 tropism switches in plasma virus after undetectable viremia were relatively rare events especially among patients with higher CD4 counts during virologic suppression. Our study supports the use of pre-suppression tropism results if maraviroc is being considered during virologic suppression in this subgroup of patients."

Oct4, for example, functions as a master transcription factor critical for pluripotency maintenance in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and the levels of Oct4 are tightly regulated to control cellular transitions either toward pluripotency or toward embryonic lineage commitment (Radzisheuskaya et al., 2013Radzisheuskaya A.

Recent evidence shows that pluripotency can be defined by two distinct phases: naive, a preimplantation developmental ground state; or primed, a postimplantation pluripotent state prepared for lineage specification and commitment (Nichols and Smith, 2009Nichols J. Smith A. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 487-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). Though naive and primed pluripotent cells have distinct gene expression profiles, both preimplantation- and postimplantation-derived ESCs express the same core pluripotency transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog (Tesar et al., 2007Tesar P.J.

In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Factor et al. and Buecker et al. profile enhancer and transcription factor occupancy landscapes in naive and primed stem cells, providing mechanistic insight into the dynamic regulation of key overlapping factors across distinct pluripotent states. Tesar and colleagues performed transcriptome profiling in mouse ESCs and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), representative of naive and primed pluripotent states, respectively. This analysis showed small-scale differences in transcriptional output, yet these changes are mirrored by dramatic alterations in chromatin profiles at enhancers (Factor et al., 2014Factor D. Corradin O. Zentner G.E. Saiakhova A. Song L. Chenoweth J.G. McKay R.D. Crawford G.E. Scacheri P.C. Tesar P.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14 (this issue): 854-863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In particular, nearly all genes preferentially expressed in pluripotent cells are marked by differential enhancer usage between naive and primed states. Enhancers used specifically in naive ESCs, termed naive-dominant enhancers, are characterized by high levels of enhancer histone signals H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, and these enhancers and their associated marks are lost following transition of naive ESCs into primed EpiSCs. In contrast, enhancers used exclusively in EpiSCs and not naive cells contain low but detectable levels of enhancer histone signals in ESCs. This suggests that these regulatory elements, termed “seed enhancers,” may function as placeholders in precursor cells to ensure proper enhancer usage in subsequent, differentiated cell types (Factor et al., 2014Factor D. Corradin O. Zentner G.E. Saiakhova A. Song L. Chenoweth J.G. McKay R.D. Crawford G.E. Scacheri P.C. Tesar P.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14 (this issue): 854-863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Seed enhancers were further shown to be significantly enriched for H3K27ac in subsequent embryonic and adult tissues, and in many cases they expand into multienhancer clusters, recently described as stretch enhancers or superenhancers, which are important for maintaining cellular identity (Hnisz et al., 2013Hnisz D.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 17921-17926Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In contrast to naive-dominant enhancers, seed enhancers rarely interact with pluripotency gene promoters and are comparatively depleted for factors such as the mediator and cohesin complexes that promote enhancer-promoter interactions in mouse ESCs. The reorganization of enhancer usage during the transition to primed EpiSCs suggests that regulatory transcription factors, such as Oct4, must be redirected from decommissioned naive-dominant enhancers to newly functional seed enhancers. To examine the behavior of these common regulatory factors during the transition between naive and primed pluripotency, Swigut, Wysocka, and colleagues (Buecker et al., 2014Buecker C. Srinivasan R. Wu Z. Calo E. Acampora D. Faial T. Simeone A. Tan M. Swigut T. Wysocka J. Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14 (this issue): 838-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) performed a careful analysis of transcription factor binding. The authors performed genome-wide profiling of Oct4 binding using an in vitro system modeling preimplantation to postimplantation differentiation. Consistent with the dramatic changes in enhancer usage and chromatin profiles described above, Oct4 occupancy shows substantial reorganization between naive and primed stem cell states. Naive state-specific Oct4 binding correlates with downregulation of associated transcripts following transition into a primed stem cell state, whereas primed state-specific Oct4 binding is associated with transcriptional upregulation. Changes in Oct4 localization are further mirrored by alterations in p300 binding and H3K27ac levels, suggesting that Oct4 indeed localizes to state-specific active enhancers. The levels of Oct4 expression are comparable between naive and primed states despite clear differences in binding landscapes. However, by comparing the protein-protein interaction profiles between Oct4 and other factors across these two pluripotent states, Buecker et al. provide further insight into the mechanisms driving Oct4 reorganization. Chromatin remodeling complexes, protein modification enzymes, and several transcription factors show differential interaction with Oct4 in naive versus primed stem cells. For example, Esrrb, Klf5, and Tcf3 interact with Oct4 specifically in naive ESCs, and Otx2, Zic2, Zfp281, and others were identified as interacting proteins specifically in primed epiblast-like stem cells. De novo motif identification of Oct4 binding sites also revealed differential enrichments for DNA recognition motifs corresponding to Esrrb and Klf4/5, or to Otx2 and Zic2, consistent with biochemically identified binding partners in naive and primed states, respectively. The differential protein interaction and DNA interaction profiles suggest that cooperative binding by Oct4 with cell-state-specific regulatory partners may be responsible for driving reorganization of enhancer usage during differentiation (Figure 1). Indeed, Otx2 expression levels and genomic binding events were further shown to be significantly enriched in primed stem cells, and primed state-specific Otx2 binding sites represent regions cobound by Oct4 that were previously inaccessible to this master regulatory factor in naive ESCs (Buecker et al., 2014Buecker C. Srinivasan R. Wu Z. Calo E. Acampora D. Faial T. Simeone A. Tan M. Swigut T. Wysocka J. Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14 (this issue): 838-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The Fgf5 locus, for example, is activated in the postimplantation epiblast and is regulated by a cluster of distal enhancers bound by Otx2 and Oct4 specifically in the primed stem cell state. Similar to seed enhancers, this enhancer cluster is reminiscent of large enhancer regulatory domains or superenhancers, and it appears active specifically after the transition from naive to primed pluripotency. However, in contrast to seed enhancers, nuclease sensitivity and enhancer histone signals were not detected at these sites in ESCs, and this appears to be the case among most primed-specific Otx2/Oct4 binding sites. Whether Otx2/Oct4-bound enhancers are distinct from seed enhancers, or whether this discrepancy is an artifact arising from differences in experimental systems or methodologies in data analysis, is not currently evident. Nonetheless, these data shed light on a novel mechanism underlying cell-state-specific regulatory circuitries important for defining pluripotency and lineage specification and commitment. When considered in combination with additional recent reports, this mechanism likely represents a fundamental paradigm for cell-type-specific expression patterns and cellular responses to signaling pathways. Genome-wide mapping of enhancer activity in Drosophila, for example, revealed tissue-specific localization patterns for the ecdysone receptor (EcR) in response to hormone signaling in distinct cell types (Shlyueva et al., 2014Shlyueva D. Stelzer C. Gerlach D. Yáñez-Cuna J.O. Rath M. Boryń L.M. Arnold C.D. Stark A. Mol. Cell. 2014; 54: 180-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Similar to results for Oct4, differential EcR partner motifs defined cell-type-specific target enhancers that, in most cases, represent previously inaccessible chromatin sites. Meanwhile, large-scale comparisons of DNA-binding and protein interactions across distinct human cell lines similarly revealed tissue-specific colocalization patterns dynamically regulated across conditions and cell types (Xie et al., 2013Xie D. Boyle A.P. Wu L. Zhai J. Kawli T. Snyder M. Cell. 2013; 155: 713-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that regulate protein-protein interaction networks to effect changes in cooperative transcription factor binding, as well as understanding how inaccessible regions of the genome are made accessible or otherwise regulated, are central questions for future research, and the answers to these questions have important consequences for our understanding of the regulation of pluripotent states.

https://openalex.org/W2165318569,"Mother-child interactions around a shared activity have been shown to play a key role in the development of young children’s capacity to interact cooperatively with others. This evidence is particularly germane to type 1 diabetes (T1D) management in younger children where cooperation with parental treatment efforts is crucial for treatment success and where maternal distress and child behavioural problems are risk factors for treatment management, biomedical and psychological outcomes. In 49 4-to-8 year old children with T1D, we investigated whether the association between maternal affect and child problematic behaviour is mediated by mother-child interactions in the context of a T1D-relevant collaborative problem-solving activity. Mothers completed standardised measures of maternal and child psychological adjustment and interacted with their children in the problem-solving activity, analysed for quality of interpersonal engagement based on evaluations of maternal (sensitivity and cognitive stimulation) and dyadic (joint attention and warmth) behaviours. Mediation analyses confirmed the hypothesis that interpersonal engagement mediates the relation between maternal affective state and child behavioural problems. Specifically, more negative maternal affect is associated with lower levels of interpersonal engagement; these less engaged interactions in turn are associated with more behavioural problems in children. These findings are consistent with research involving typically developing children. The implications of our findings are twofold. First, in the context of psychological adjustment to T1D, maternal affect and mother-child interactions are 2 potential targets for interventions which promote cooperative interactions. Second, understanding and caring for children at biological risk requires attention to developmental psychology theory and method; in particular, research addressing parent-child cooperation carries both conceptual and clinical relevance."

We aimed to identify a small chemical molecule as an inducer of EndoMT and find a new signal pathway by using the inducer. Safrole oxide (SFO), 50 µg/ml, could most effectively induce EndoMT within 12 h. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism, we performed microarray, quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis to find key factors involved in SFO-induced EndoMT and demonstrated the involvement of the factors by RNAi. The expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), and interleukin 8 (IL-8) was greatly increased in SFO-induced EndoMT. Knockdown of ATF4 inhibited the SFO-induced EndoMT completely, and knockdown of p75NTR or IL-8 partially inhibited the EndoMT, which suggests that all three factors were involved in the process. Furthermore, knockdown of p75NTR inhibited the SFO-increased IL-8 expression and secretion, and knockdown of ATF4 inhibited SFO-increased p75NTR level significantly. The ATF4/p75NTR/IL-8 signal pathway may have an important role in EndoMT induced by SFO. Our findings support potential novel targets for the therapeutics of cancer and fibrosis disease."
https://openalex.org/W2121006010,"With the continuous improvement in genotyping and molecular phenotyping technology and the decreasing typing cost, it is expected that in a few years, more and more clinical studies of complex diseases will recruit thousands of individuals for pan-omic genetic association analyses. Hence, there is a great need for algorithms and software tools that could scale up to the whole omic level, integrate different omic data, leverage rich structure information, and be easily accessible to non-technical users. We present GenAMap, an interactive analytics software platform that 1) automates the execution of principled machine learning methods that detect genome- and phenome-wide associations among genotypes, gene expression data, and clinical or other macroscopic traits, and 2) provides new visualization tools specifically designed to aid in the exploration of association mapping results. Algorithmically, GenAMap is based on a new paradigm for GWAS and PheWAS analysis, termed structured association mapping, which leverages various structures in the omic data. We demonstrate the function of GenAMap via a case study of the Brem and Kruglyak yeast dataset, and then apply it on a comprehensive eQTL analysis of the NIH heterogeneous stock mice dataset and report some interesting findings. GenAMap is available from http://sailing.cs.cmu.edu/genamap."
