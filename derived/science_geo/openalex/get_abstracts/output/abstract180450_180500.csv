Despite increasing evidence that high levels of IL-17 are associated with several chronic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis, the regulation of its expression is not well characterized. We observe that IL-17 production is increased in response to the recently described cytokine IL-23. We present evidence that murine IL-23, which is produced by activated dendritic cells, acts on memory T cells, resulting in elevated IL-17 secretion. IL-23 also induced expression of the related cytokine IL-17F. IL-23 is a heterodimeric cytokine and shares a subunit, p40, with IL-12. In contrast to IL-23, IL-12 had only marginal effects on IL-17 production. These data suggest that during a secondary immune response, IL-23 can promote an activation state with features distinct from the well characterized Th1 and Th2 profiles.

Although clearly produced by activated T cells, previous reports have not provided clear classification of IL-17 within the paradigm of Th1 and Th2 polarized cytokine profiles.We have examined the possibility that IL-17 is expressed in response to signals distinct from those associated with the Th1 or Th2 response. We observe a previously unrecognized activity of the recently identified cytokine IL-23 (20Oppmann B. Lesley R. Blom B. Timans J.C. Xu Y. Hunte B. Vega F. Yu N. Wang J. Singh K. Zonin F. Vaisberg E. Churakova T. Liu M. Gorman D. Wagner J. Zurawski S. Liu Y. Abrams J.S. Moore K.W. Rennick D. de W.-M.R. Hannum C. Bazan J.F. Kastelein R.A.

The initial characterization of this cytokine has suggested it can promote proliferation within the memory T cell population. Subsequent work demonstrated that transgenic over-expression of the second component of IL-23, p19, was sufficient to induce systemic inflammation and premature death (21Wiekowski M.T. Leach M.W. Evans E.W. Sullivan L. Chen S.C. Vassileva G. Bazan J.F. Gorman D.M. Kastelein R.A. Narula S. Lira S.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7563-7570Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In addition, the mice had markedly elevated levels of circulating neutrophils. Interestingly they did not exhibit consistent elevation of IFN-γ, a hallmark effect of IL-12. These data suggest that IL-23 may have a biological role substantially distinct from that of IL-12. In this report we present evidence that IL-23 acts to induce a distinct T cell activation state that produces IL-17 as a principle effector cytokine.RESULTSWe first examined the ability of various microbial products to stimulate the production of IL-17. Increased IL-17 has recently been observed by Infante-Duarte et al. (22Infante-Duarte C. Horton H.F. Byrne M.C. Kamradt T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6107-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) in response to microbial lipopeptides from a Lyme disease causing spirochete,Borrelia burgdorferi. We observed that spleen cell cultures in the presence of various microbial products including LPS (Gram-negative bacteria), lipoteichoic acid (Gram-positive bacteria) or lipopeptide (bacterial lipopeptide) resulted in the production of IL-17 (Fig. 1). Neither purified T cells alone nor purified macrophages themselves produced IL-17. Purified T cells, upon receptor cross-linking using plate-bound anti-CD3 and treatment with supernatants from activated macrophages/dendritic cells, produced increased IL-17, indicating the presence of an unidentified factor(s) released by these cells that acts on T cells to promote IL-17 production.In profiling the expression of candidate molecules that might be responsible for this IL-17 promoting activity, we observed 100–1000-fold increased mRNA expression of the IL-23 (20Oppmann B. Lesley R. Blom B. Timans J.C. Xu Y. Hunte B. Vega F. Yu N. Wang J. Singh K. Zonin F. Vaisberg E. Churakova T. Liu M. Gorman D. Wagner J. Zurawski S. Liu Y. Abrams J.S. Moore K.W.

Murine spleen cell cultures, in the presence of IL-23, resulted in high levels of IL-17 production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). However, when these cells were cultured under IL-12-stimulated Th1-inducing conditions, they resulted in marginal IL-17 production, whereas under Th2-inducing conditions there was no increased production of IL-17 over controls (Table I). IL-23 also resulted in higher levels of GM-CSF than observed under Th1-inducing conditions. In contrast, IFN-γ levels were significantly lower than those obtained under Th1-inducing conditions. Tumor necrosis factor-α levels were similar to Th1 conditions. IL-12p40 alone did not result in any IL-17 production (data not shown). IL-23 promoted elevated levels of IL-17 mRNA (Fig. 2 B). IL-17 mRNA levels were increased several hundred-fold within 6 h of IL-23 exposure and remained elevated in the continued presence of IL-23. This effect was not inhibited by the presence of an antibody against IL-17, suggesting that the IL-17 itself was not contributing to this process (not shown). In addition, mRNA for IL-17F, a recently identified IL-17 family member (23Hymowitz S.G. Filvaroff E.H. Yin J.P. Lee J. Cai L. Risser P. Maruoka M. Mao W. Foster J. Kelley R.F. Pan G.

A, mononuclear cells isolated from splenocytes were cultured with IL-2 in presence or absence of various concentrations of IL-23 (0.1–1000 ng/ml) for 6 days. Levels of IL-17 accumulated in culture supernatants were measured using ELISA. Experiments were performed at least six times with similar results. Inclusion of ConA in the culture conditions substantially increased the level of IL-17 produced in response to IL-23 but also increased basal production of IL-17 and other cytokines in the absence of IL-23 (not shown). B, changes in mRNA levels for IL-17 in response to IL-23 treatment were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Plotted is the relative change in Ct (cycle threshold) of the PCR reaction. Data for each sample is normalized to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA level present in each sample and then normalized again between samples to the level of IL-17 mRNA present in the time zero unstimulated condition. As each Ct corresponds to a PCR cycle, one Ct is approximately equal to a 2-fold change in mRNA abundance. The approximate mRNA fold difference for 5 Ct and 10 Ct changes are indicated in parenthesis. The experiment was performed with splenocytes from 4 mice, and the individual data points are represented with x and the average Ct change is indicated by bar columns. C, changes in mRNA levels of the IL-17 family member IL-17F in response to IL-23 treatment were measured by quantitative RT-PCR as in the legend to Fig. 2 B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ICytokine levels in Th cells in response to IL-23ControlIL-12IL-4IL-23IL-17N.D.58 ± 8264 ± 911191 ± 569IL-450 ± 26396 ± 173259 ± 118101 ± 100IFN-γ341 ± 02757 ± 1016489 ± 502580 ± 813GM-CSFN.D.46 ± 13365 ± 516882 ± 169TNF-αN.D.174 ± 40214 ± 314205 ± 85Purified CD4+ T cells were incubated in presence of IL-2 (100 units/ml) and activated as described under “Experimental Procedures” under Th1-inducing conditions (IL-12+ anti-IL-4), Th2-inducing conditions (IL-4+ anti-IFN-γ), or purified IL-23 (10 nm) for 3 days, following which the cultures were washed and re-stimulated with anti-CD3 for another 24 hours. Levels of various cytokines were measured using ELISA. The levels less than the lowest dilution of the standard curve range of ELISA kit were recorded as not detectable (N.D.). The results below are representative of three experiments performed independently. Open table in a new tab IL-23 has been reported to promote the proliferation of memory but not naı̈ve T cells (20Oppmann B. Lesley R. Blom B. Timans J.C. Xu Y. Hunte B. Vega F. Yu N. Wang J. Singh K.

We therefore examined the effect of IL-23 on IL-17 production from naı̈ve versus memory T cell populations. Purified CD4+ T cells were isolated from splenocytes by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The memory cell population was selected as CD4+CD44high (26Budd R.C. Cerottini J.C. Horvath C. Bron C. Pedrazzini T. Howe R.C. MacDonald J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3120-3129PubMed Google Scholar) or CD4+CD62Llow (27Jung T.M. Gallatin W.M. Weissman I.L. Dailey M.O. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 4110-4117PubMed Google Scholar), and naı̈ve cell population was selected as CD4+CD44low or CD4+CD62Lhigh. As seen in (Fig. 3), IL-23 stimulated robust IL-17 production within the memory cell population (CD44high and CD62Llow) and little or no IL-17 production within the naı̈ve (CD44low or CD62Lhigh) cell population.Figure 3IL-23 acts on memory T cells to induce IL-17 production. CD4-positive memory (CD44high/CD62Llow) or naı̈ve (CD44low/CD62Lhigh) T cells were cultured with IL-2 in the presence or absence of IL-23 (or its boiled prep as a control) and plate-bound anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml) for 3 days (6 days for naı̈ve cell population), washed, and re-stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody for another 24 h. Supernatants were collected, and IL-17 levels were measured using ELISA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)IL-23-mediated IL-17 production was completely blocked in the presence of a neutralizing IL-12 antibody (R&D Systems) that interacts with the p40 subunit shared with IL-23 (used due to unavailability of neutralizing antibodies specific to IL-23p19 or IL-23) (Fig. 4 A and 4 B,left panel). This effect was not due to ligation of Fc receptors on antigen-presenting cells as there was no change in IL-17 production in the presence of unrelated antibody. This antibody also inhibited >50% the induction of IL-17 production observed in response to conditioned media from LPS-stimulated dendritic cells (Fig. 4 B, right panel). A marked reduction, but not abrogation, of IL-17 production was seen in response to ConA stimulation from spleen cell cultures of mice lacking IL-12p40 component (strain B6.129S1-IL12btm1Jm) as compared with wild type mice or mice lacking IL-12p35 component (strain B6.129S1-IL12atm1Jm) (Fig. 4 B). Thus, IL-23 plays a substantial role in promoting IL-17 production, although it is clearly not absolutely required.Figure 4IL-12p40 antibody blocks IL-23-dependent IL-17 production. A, IL-12 antibody interacts with p40 subunit present in IL-12 and IL-23. Shown is the Western blot analysis using anti-IL-12 antibody demonstrating interaction with purified recombinant p40 and the p40 subunit present in IL-12 and IL-23. The relative positions of molecular mass markers, in kDa, are indicated. B, increasing concentrations of anti-IL-12p40 antibody or an unrelated control antibody were pre-incubated with IL-23 and then incubated for another 5–6 days with mononuclear splenocytes. Supernatant were collected and levels of IL-17 measured using ELISA (left panel). Optimum concentrations of anti-IL-12p40 antibody or control antibody were pre-incubated with conditioned media of LPS-stimulated dendritic cells and then incubated for another 5 days with mononuclear splenocytes. Supernatant were collected and levels of IL-17 measured using ELISA (right panel). C, mononuclear cells isolated from splenocytes of wild type mice (C57/BL6) or mice lacking one of the components of IL-12, i.e. IL12a−/− (p35 knockout) or IL12b−/− (p40 knockout) were cultured in the continuous presence of ConA for 3 days and IL-17 levels measured in supernatants using ELISA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Finally, to examine the role of IL-12 in IL-17 production, we added increasing amounts (0.001–1 nm) of murine IL-12 to IL-23 (1 nm) containing cultures. As seen in (Fig. 5 A), IL-12 decreased IL-17 levels in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, we treated splenocytes from mice lacking IL-12 receptor beta chain 2 (IL-12Rβ2) (28Wu C.-Y. Wang X. Gadina M. O'Shea J.J. Presky D.H. Magram J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6221-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the specific receptor component of IL-12 (29Chua A.O. Wilkinson V.L. Presky D.H. Gubler U. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4286-4294PubMed Google Scholar) with purified IL-23. Splenocytes from IL-12Rβ2−/− mice responded to IL-23 stimulus by increasing IL-17 production over the un-stimulated control (Fig. 5 B) without affecting IFN-γ levels. Surprisingly, the background levels of IL-17 in these mice were more than 10-fold elevated as compared with wild type mice, suggesting a possible negative regulation by IL-12 of IL-23-induced IL-17 production. However, in contrast to IL-12Rβ2 knockout mice, we did not observe increased IL-17 in spleen cultures from IL-12p35 knockout mice. The reasons for this difference are not known, but could relate to alteration in IL-12p40 function in the absence of p35, or differences in genetic background or pathogen exposure.Figure 5Effect of IL-12 on IL-17 production. A, mononuclear cells isolated from spleen cell cultures were incubated in the presence purified IL-23 (1 nm) and the increasing concentration of IL-12 for 5 days and then washed and re-stimulated with ConA for another 24 h. IL-17 levels were measured in cell supernatant using ELISA kits. B, mononuclear cells isolated from spleen cell cultures from wild type or mice lacking IL-12Rβ2 (IL-12Rβ2−/− KO) were incubated in the presence or absence of purified IL-23 (1 nm) for 5 days and then washed and re-stimulated with ConA for another 24 h. IL-17 and IFN-γ levels were measured in cell supernatant using ELISA kits.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONTaken together these data suggest a role for IL-23 in the promotion of a distinct T cell activation state that expresses IL-17 as an effector cytokine. The Th1 and Th2 paradigms have been described as promoting cell-mediated versus humoral immune responses. These responses provide important defense for intracellular and extracellular pathogens, respectively, and defects in either of these responses are associated with increased susceptibility to specific pathogens. In contrast, IL-23 may serve to promote an adaptive immune response to pathogens that is characterized by a heavy reliance on cells thought to function primarily as mediators of the innate immune response. IL-17, as a principle effector cytokine of this response, is able to promote the more rapid recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils through induced chemokine production. In addition, the GM-CSF production observed in response to IL-23 supports the production of additional myeloid cells. This is further augmented by high level G-CSF production from local IL-17-stimulated stromal cells. The character of this adaptive response is, however, not an exclusive reliance on phagocytic cells of the myeloid lineage as IL-17 is known to promote the induction of ICAM thereby providing important co-stimulation of further T cell responses. The actions of IL-23 appear to be restricted to memory T cells. However, it remains to be determined whether there exist co-stimulatory signals that enable action of IL-23 on naı̈ve T cell populations. Further analysis with TCR transgenic animals will help to clarify these issues.Recently several studies (30Decken K. Kohler G. Palmer-Lehmann K. Wunderlin A. Mattner F. Magram J. Gately M.K. Alber G.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 6957-6966Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) have pointed out significant differences between mice deficient in p35 and mice deficient in p40. These studies share the observation that loss of p40 is generally more deleterious than loss of p35 in the immune-mediated clearance of a variety of model organisms. For example, Elkins et al. (32Elkins K.L. Cooper A. Colombini S.M. Cowley S.C. Kieffer T.L. Infection & Immunity. 2002; 70: 1936-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) found that although p35 KO mice were readily able to clear the intracellular bacterium Francisella tularensis LVS, p40 KO mice were unable to completely clear the bacteria and exhibited chronic infection. In light of the results presented here, these observations may reflect the capacity of IL-12 and IL-23 to promote unique and complementary immune responses that facilitate the complete clearance of bacteria and perhaps other pathogens. Interestingly, recently reported p19 transgenic mice display a profound systemic inflammation and neutrophilia (21Wiekowski M.T. Leach M.W. Evans E.W. Sullivan L. Chen S.C. Vassileva G. Bazan J.F. Gorman D.M. Kastelein R.A. Narula S. Lira S.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7563-7570Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This phenotype is consistent with the results reported here and further indicates the potential of this signal to mediate profound changes in the balance of immune function. IL-17 production is not completely abrogated in p40 KO mice, indicating that there exist other IL-23-independent pathways to its expression. It will be very important to investigate whether IL-23 has similar functions in human and mice and to establish its relevant role in human immune function. A great deal of attention has been given to the Th1 paradigm and its relationship to major unmet human diseases. Given the clear association of IL-17 expression with most of these same inflammatory diseases it may be that the relationship between IL-12 and these diseases should be re-evaluated and additional work undertaken to understand the role of this new cytokine axis in human disease. Interleukin (IL)1-17 is a T cell-derived pro-inflammatory molecule that stimulates epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblastic cells to produce other inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF, and MCP-1 (1Aggarwal S.

Although clearly produced by activated T cells, previous reports have not provided clear classification of IL-17 within the paradigm of Th1 and Th2 polarized cytokine profiles.

Here, we show that hypothalamic leptin-dependent antiosteogenic and anorexigenic networks differ, and that the peripheral mediators of leptin antiosteogenic function appear to be neuronal. Neuropeptides mediating leptin anorexigenic function do not affect bone formation. Leptin deficiency results in low sympathetic tone, and genetic or pharmacological ablation of adrenergic signaling leads to a leptin-resistant high bone mass. beta-adrenergic receptors on osteoblasts regulate their proliferation, and a beta-adrenergic agonist decreases bone mass in leptin-deficient and wild-type mice while a beta-adrenergic antagonist increases bone mass in wild-type and ovariectomized mice. None of these manipulations affects body weight. This study demonstrates a leptin-dependent neuronal regulation of bone formation with potential therapeutic implications for osteoporosis."

We found that only a small subset of lysines in histones H4 and H3 are acetylated in vivo by the GCN5 acetyltransferase during activation of the IFN-β gene. Reconstitution of recombinant nucleosomes bearing mutations in these lysine residues revealed the cascade of gene activation via a point-by-point interpretation of the histone code through the ordered recruitment of bromodomain-containing transcription complexes. Acetylation of histone H4 K8 mediates recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex whereas acetylation of K9 and K14 in histone H3 is critical for the recruitment of TFIID. Thus, the information contained in the DNA address of the enhancer is transferred to the histone N termini by generating novel adhesive surfaces required for the recruitment of transcription complexes."

This acetylation can be brought about by either the SAGA or NuA4 HAT complexes. The bromodomain in the Spt7 subunit of SAGA is dispensable for this activity but will anchor SAGA if it is swapped into Gcn5, indicating that specificity of bromodomain function is determined in part by the subunit it occupies. Thus, bromodomains within the catalytic subunits of SAGA and SWI/SNF anchor these complexes to acetylated promoter nucleosomes."

Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar). The Rel family includes p65 (RelA), p105/p50, p100/p52, RelB, and c-Rel, which homo- or heterodimerize to form transcriptionally competent or repressive complexes referred to as NF-κB (3Chen F.E. Ghosh G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The most abundant form of NF-κB is a p50/p65 heterodimer in which p65 contains the transcriptional activation domain. The activity of NF-κB is regulated by its subcellular localization. In unstimulated cells, NF-κB exists in an inactive form sequestered in the cytoplasm by its inhibitor, IκB. The IκB family includes several members of which the best characterized is IκBα (2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar). Cell activation by a multitude of extracellular signals (4Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3417) Google Scholar) converges on phosphorylation of IκB by IκB kinase, which triggers its rapid ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (5Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Degradation of IκB unmasks the nuclear localization signal (NLS)1 present in NF-κB, which then enters the nucleus to activate target gene expression.A key step to controlling NF-κB activity is the regulation of NF-κB subcellular localization through its interaction with IκB in both pre-induced and post-induced cellular states. IκBα contains both a nuclear import sequence (6Sachdev S. Hoffmann A. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2524-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tam W.F. Wang W. Sen R. Mol. Cell.

One of the target genes of NF-κB is IκBα, resulting in rapid induction of newly synthesized IκBα protein, which enters the nucleus and dissociates NF-κB from κB-DNA to repress NF-κB function (13Le Bail O.

NF-κB·IκB complexes are exported to the cytoplasm where they may serve for additional rounds of activation or restore the original latent state (6Sachdev S. Hoffmann A. Hannink M. Mol. Cell.

Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). It was proposed by Chen et al. that reversible acetylation regulates the interaction between p65 and IκBα and, therefore, controls the duration of the NF-κB response. Here, we show that p65 is acetylated on dual lysine residues K122/123 by p300 and PCAF and deacetylated by HDAC3. Contrary to Chen et al., we could not demonstrate any significant effect of acetylation on the interaction between p65 and IκBα. Rather, we show that acetylation reduces binding of p65 to κB-containing DNA, facilitating its removal by IκBα and subsequent export to the cytoplasm. We propose that acetylation of p65 contributes to the mechanism of post-induction turn-off of NF-κB-mediated transcription.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we examined the functions of p300 and PCAF coactivators in NF-κB-mediated transcription. Both p300 and PCAF acetylate p65 and, moreover, target the same residues within p65: lysines 122 and 123 that are important for high affinity binding of p65 to κB-DNA. We identified HDAC3 as the histone deacetylase responsible for p65 deacetylation. Fig. 8 shows a schematic representation of the proposed role of p65 acetylation in NF-κB-mediated transcription. Following immune stimulation of cells, which results in degradation of IκBα, NF-κB is translocated to the nucleus via the newly exposed NLS in p65 and binds tightly to κB-DNA elements. Recruitment of p300 and PCAF to the promoter region results in activation of NF-κB-mediated transcription presumably through their associated histone-directed acetylase activity, which induces localized chromatin remodeling. Subsequently, acetylation of p65 by p300 or PCAF at two DNA-binding residues, lysines 122 and 123, lowers its affinity for κB-DNA. This facilitates removal of NF-κB from enhancer elements by newly synthesized IκBα whose expression is induced by NF-κB, and subsequent export of NF-κB·IκBα from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The NF-κB·IκBα cytoplasmic complex can subsequently either establish a post-induced latent state or serve for additional rounds of activation following deacetylation of p65 by HDAC3. Thus, acetylation of p65 is essential for turning off NF-κB-mediated gene expression.Recently, the reversible acetylation of p65 was reported by Chenet al. (22Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Although both studies show that reversible acetylation of p65 by p300 and HDAC3 plays a critical role in NF-κB-transcriptional activity, the function attributed to p65 acetylation contrasts sharply between the two studies. Chen et al. proposed a model in which deacetylation of p65 promotes binding between NF-κB and IκBα, which mediates export of the complex to the cytoplasm to establish the latent state. In contrast, we have shown that acetylation of p65 reduces its interaction with κB DNA and thereby promotes IκBα-mediated nuclear export. We were unable to demonstrate any significant effect of p65 acetylation on its interaction with IκBα (Fig. 3). Because Chen et al. did not identify the specific acetyl acceptor residues present in p65, their conclusions were based on experiments using the broadly acting HDAC inhibitor, TSA, to enhance acetylation. However, TSA induces global effects on acetylation in the cell and would influence the function of many acetylated substrates, which include coactivators, components of the basal transcription machinery, and proteins involved in nuclear import (34Bannister A.J. Miska E.A. Gorlich D. Kouzarides T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 467-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 35Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Chen et al. showed that cotreatment of cells with tumor necrosis factor α and TSA enhances p65 DNA-binding activity. In contrast, a direct comparison of κB-DNA binding by acetylated and non-acetylated forms of p65 showed that acetylation of p65 lowered its affinity for κB-DNA (Fig. 4), which consequently promotes its IκBα-mediated export to the cytoplasm (Figs. 5, 7, and 8). Using a GST-IκBα pull-down assay, Chenet al. showed that cotransfection of p300 and p65 reduces the ability of GST-IκBα to interact with p65 and concluded that acetylation of p65 prevents its interaction with IκBα. We directly analyzed binding of IκBα to acetylated p65 by coimmunoprecipitation analysis using extracts from either [3H]NaAc or [35S]Met/Cys-labeled cells and found that most of the acetylated p65 in cells can be found in association with IκBα. Indeed, given that acetylation of p65 occurs in the nucleus (Fig. 5), the finding that acetylated p65 accumulates in the cytoplasm in an IκBα-dependent manner indicates that the interaction between p65 and IκBα is not abolished, because studies using knock-out mice have shown that nuclear export of NF-κB depends on its interaction with IκBα. The discrepancy between the conclusions reached by the two studies may be due to differences in the experimental approaches used.The importance of IκB-mediated NF-κB export from the nucleus and consequently the termination of NF-κB-dependent transcription has been provided from studies using IκBα knockout mice (36Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar, 37Klement J.F. Rice N.R. Car B.D. Abbondanzo S.J. Powers G.D. Bhatt P.H. Chen C.H. Rosen C.A. Stewart C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2341-2349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which IκBα removes NF-κB from DNA is unknown. The p50/p65 heterodimer has a particularly high affinity for κB-DNA, between 10−10 and 10−13 (38Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 39Urban M.B. Baeuerle P.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1975-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whereas the affinity of IκBα for the p50/p65 heterodimer is 10−9 (40Phelps C.B. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29840-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, the NF-κB/κB-DNA interaction would need to be destabilized so that IκB can compete for the removal of NF-κB from DNA. In agreement with this, Munshi et al. (41Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) found that IκBα was not able to remove NF-κB from DNA in the context of the INF-β enhanceosome. The crystal structure of the p50/p65 heterodimer bound to κB-DNA revealed that, among p65 residues involved in DNA binding, lysines 122 and 123 are the only residues that contact the DNA in the minor groove (31Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Our results show that acetylation of lysines 122 and 123 within p65 by p300 and PCAF reduces its affinity to κB-DNA (Fig. 3). Thus, we propose a model in which acetylation of p65 plays a role in IκB-mediated removal of NF-κB from DNA and termination of NF-κB-mediated transcription. In agreement with this model, the acetylated form of p65 accumulated in the cytoplasm in an IκBα-dependent manner, and the p65KK-RR mutant was less sensitive to IκBα-mediated termination of transcription and removal from κΒ-DNA than wild type p65 (Fig. 7). Analogous to the function attributed to p65 acetylation in this report, acetylation of high mobility group I(Y) by CBP has been shown to destabilize its interaction with DNA, which disrupts the enhanceosome and turns off INF-β gene expression (41Munshi N.

Furthermore, acetyltransferase activity of CBP/p300 and PCAF enhance NF-κB transcriptional activity (19Sheppard K.A. Rose D.W. Haque Z.K. Kurokawa R. McInerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G.

Here, we show that p300 and PCAF HAT activities potentiate p65 transcriptional activity, whereas their FAT activities are repressive. Factor acetylation of p65 negatively regulates its transcriptional activity by lowering binding to κB-DNA and facilitating its removal and export by IκBα. Additionally, HDAC3 was more repressive toward p65KK-RR than p65 wt, suggesting that factor deacetylase activity of HDAC3 is involved in activating p65 transcriptional activity, perhaps by enhancing p65 binding to κB-DNA. Thus, p300 and PCAF acetyltransferase activities play a role in both transcriptional activation and post-induction turn-off of p65-mediated transcription. A similar functional duality has been previously demonstrated for high mobility group I(Y), which, together with other transcriptional activators, recruits HAT activity to the enhanceosome to stimulate transcription and serves itself as a target for acetylation leading to enhanceosome disassembly and turn-off of transcription (41Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar).The demonstration that p300 and PCAF are involved in both transcriptional activation and post-induction turn-off implies that their acetylation activity would need to be regulated in a temporal and substrate-dependent manner. What prevents p300 and PCAF from acetylating p65 immediately after their recruitment to the promoter? One possibility is that other substrates such as histones provide better targets for acetylation. In support of this, we have observed that acetylation of p65 by p300 and PCAF in vitrois ∼100-fold less efficient than that of nucleosomes (data not shown). Alternatively, the substrate specificity of p300 and PCAF acetylation activity may be regulated by post-translational modifications. Therefore, recruitment of p300 and/or PCAF by κB-DNA-bound p65 may lead first to chromatin derepression and transcriptional activation. Subsequently, p300 and PCAF may acetylate p65 to facilitate its removal from DNA by IκBα and its export to the cytoplasm to terminate NF-κB-mediated transcription. The NF-κB/Rel family of inducible transcription factors is involved in the expression of numerous genes involved in processes such as growth, development, apoptosis, and inflammatory and immune responses (1Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar, 2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar). The Rel family includes p65 (RelA), p105/p50, p100/p52, RelB, and c-Rel, which homo- or heterodimerize to form transcriptionally competent or repressive complexes referred to as NF-κB (3Chen F.E. Ghosh G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The most abundant form of NF-κB is a p50/p65 heterodimer in which p65 contains the transcriptional activation domain. The activity of NF-κB is regulated by its subcellular localization. In unstimulated cells, NF-κB exists in an inactive form sequestered in the cytoplasm by its inhibitor, IκB. The IκB family includes several members of which the best characterized is IκBα (2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar). Cell activation by a multitude of extracellular signals (4Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3417) Google Scholar) converges on phosphorylation of IκB by IκB kinase, which triggers its rapid ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (5Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Degradation of IκB unmasks the nuclear localization signal (NLS)1 present in NF-κB, which then enters the nucleus to activate target gene expression. A key step to controlling NF-κB activity is the regulation of NF-κB subcellular localization through its interaction with IκB in both pre-induced and post-induced cellular states. IκBα contains both a nuclear import sequence (6Sachdev S. Hoffmann A. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2524-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tam W.F. Wang W. Sen R. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). One of the target genes of NF-κB is IκBα, resulting in rapid induction of newly synthesized IκBα protein, which enters the nucleus and dissociates NF-κB from κB-DNA to repress NF-κB function (13Le Bail O. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5043-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 14Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). NF-κB·IκB complexes are exported to the cytoplasm where they may serve for additional rounds of activation or restore the original latent state (6Sachdev S. Hoffmann A. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2524-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of NF-κB is regulated by transcriptional coactivators that may function by bridging sequence-specific activators to the basal transcriptional machinery and also play a role in chromatin remodeling via their intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) or deacetylase (HDAC) activity (15Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). p65 binds to CBP (CREB-binding protein) and its homologue p300 as well as PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor), whereas p50 fails to recruit transcriptional coactivators (16Gerritsen M.E.

Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Enhancement of NF-κB transcriptional activity requires the acetyltransferase activity of CBP/p300 (20Vanden Berghe W., De Bosscher K. Boone E. Plaisance S. Haegeman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32091-32098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and PCAF (19Sheppard K.A. Rose D.W. Haque Z.K. Kurokawa R. McInerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The p65 subunit of NF-κB was recently shown to be acetylated (22Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). It was proposed by Chen et al. that reversible acetylation regulates the interaction between p65 and IκBα and, therefore, controls the duration of the NF-κB response. Here, we show that p65 is acetylated on dual lysine residues K122/123 by p300 and PCAF and deacetylated by HDAC3. Contrary to Chen et al., we could not demonstrate any significant effect of acetylation on the interaction between p65 and IκBα. Rather, we show that acetylation reduces binding of p65 to κB-containing DNA, facilitating its removal by IκBα and subsequent export to the cytoplasm. We propose that acetylation of p65 contributes to the mechanism of post-induction turn-off of NF-κB-mediated transcription. DISCUSSIONIn this report, we examined the functions of p300 and PCAF coactivators in NF-κB-mediated transcription. Both p300 and PCAF acetylate p65 and, moreover, target the same residues within p65: lysines 122 and 123 that are important for high affinity binding of p65 to κB-DNA. We identified HDAC3 as the histone deacetylase responsible for p65 deacetylation. Fig. 8 shows a schematic representation of the proposed role of p65 acetylation in NF-κB-mediated transcription. Following immune stimulation of cells, which results in degradation of IκBα, NF-κB is translocated to the nucleus via the newly exposed NLS in p65 and binds tightly to κB-DNA elements. Recruitment of p300 and PCAF to the promoter region results in activation of NF-κB-mediated transcription presumably through their associated histone-directed acetylase activity, which induces localized chromatin remodeling. Subsequently, acetylation of p65 by p300 or PCAF at two DNA-binding residues, lysines 122 and 123, lowers its affinity for κB-DNA. This facilitates removal of NF-κB from enhancer elements by newly synthesized IκBα whose expression is induced by NF-κB, and subsequent export of NF-κB·IκBα from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The NF-κB·IκBα cytoplasmic complex can subsequently either establish a post-induced latent state or serve for additional rounds of activation following deacetylation of p65 by HDAC3. Thus, acetylation of p65 is essential for turning off NF-κB-mediated gene expression.Recently, the reversible acetylation of p65 was reported by Chenet al. (22Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Although both studies show that reversible acetylation of p65 by p300 and HDAC3 plays a critical role in NF-κB-transcriptional activity, the function attributed to p65 acetylation contrasts sharply between the two studies. Chen et al. proposed a model in which deacetylation of p65 promotes binding between NF-κB and IκBα, which mediates export of the complex to the cytoplasm to establish the latent state. In contrast, we have shown that acetylation of p65 reduces its interaction with κB DNA and thereby promotes IκBα-mediated nuclear export. We were unable to demonstrate any significant effect of p65 acetylation on its interaction with IκBα (Fig. 3). Because Chen et al. did not identify the specific acetyl acceptor residues present in p65, their conclusions were based on experiments using the broadly acting HDAC inhibitor, TSA, to enhance acetylation. However, TSA induces global effects on acetylation in the cell and would influence the function of many acetylated substrates, which include coactivators, components of the basal transcription machinery, and proteins involved in nuclear import (34Bannister A.J. Miska E.A. Gorlich D. Kouzarides T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 467-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 35Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Chen et al. showed that cotreatment of cells with tumor necrosis factor α and TSA enhances p65 DNA-binding activity. In contrast, a direct comparison of κB-DNA binding by acetylated and non-acetylated forms of p65 showed that acetylation of p65 lowered its affinity for κB-DNA (Fig. 4), which consequently promotes its IκBα-mediated export to the cytoplasm (Figs. 5, 7, and 8). Using a GST-IκBα pull-down assay, Chenet al. showed that cotransfection of p300 and p65 reduces the ability of GST-IκBα to interact with p65 and concluded that acetylation of p65 prevents its interaction with IκBα. We directly analyzed binding of IκBα to acetylated p65 by coimmunoprecipitation analysis using extracts from either [3H]NaAc or [35S]Met/Cys-labeled cells and found that most of the acetylated p65 in cells can be found in association with IκBα. Indeed, given that acetylation of p65 occurs in the nucleus (Fig. 5), the finding that acetylated p65 accumulates in the cytoplasm in an IκBα-dependent manner indicates that the interaction between p65 and IκBα is not abolished, because studies using knock-out mice have shown that nuclear export of NF-κB depends on its interaction with IκBα. The discrepancy between the conclusions reached by the two studies may be due to differences in the experimental approaches used.The importance of IκB-mediated NF-κB export from the nucleus and consequently the termination of NF-κB-dependent transcription has been provided from studies using IκBα knockout mice (36Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar, 37Klement J.F. Rice N.R. Car B.D. Abbondanzo S.J. Powers G.D. Bhatt P.H. Chen C.H. Rosen C.A. Stewart C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2341-2349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which IκBα removes NF-κB from DNA is unknown. The p50/p65 heterodimer has a particularly high affinity for κB-DNA, between 10−10 and 10−13 (38Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 39Urban M.B. Baeuerle P.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1975-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whereas the affinity of IκBα for the p50/p65 heterodimer is 10−9 (40Phelps C.B. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29840-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, the NF-κB/κB-DNA interaction would need to be destabilized so that IκB can compete for the removal of NF-κB from DNA. In agreement with this, Munshi et al. (41Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) found that IκBα was not able to remove NF-κB from DNA in the context of the INF-β enhanceosome. The crystal structure of the p50/p65 heterodimer bound to κB-DNA revealed that, among p65 residues involved in DNA binding, lysines 122 and 123 are the only residues that contact the DNA in the minor groove (31Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Our results show that acetylation of lysines 122 and 123 within p65 by p300 and PCAF reduces its affinity to κB-DNA (Fig. 3). Thus, we propose a model in which acetylation of p65 plays a role in IκB-mediated removal of NF-κB from DNA and termination of NF-κB-mediated transcription. In agreement with this model, the acetylated form of p65 accumulated in the cytoplasm in an IκBα-dependent manner, and the p65KK-RR mutant was less sensitive to IκBα-mediated termination of transcription and removal from κΒ-DNA than wild type p65 (Fig. 7). Analogous to the function attributed to p65 acetylation in this report, acetylation of high mobility group I(Y) by CBP has been shown to destabilize its interaction with DNA, which disrupts the enhanceosome and turns off INF-β gene expression (41Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar).The activity of NF-κB has been shown to be regulated by transcriptional coactivators that function by bridging the sequence-specific activators to the basal transcriptional machinery and play a role in chromatin remodeling via their intrinsic HAT or HDAC activity (15Roth S.Y.

Both p300 and PCAF acetylate p65 and, moreover, target the same residues within p65: lysines 122 and 123 that are important for high affinity binding of p65 to κB-DNA. We identified HDAC3 as the histone deacetylase responsible for p65 deacetylation. Fig. 8 shows a schematic representation of the proposed role of p65 acetylation in NF-κB-mediated transcription. Following immune stimulation of cells, which results in degradation of IκBα, NF-κB is translocated to the nucleus via the newly exposed NLS in p65 and binds tightly to κB-DNA elements.

The NF-κB·IκBα cytoplasmic complex can subsequently either establish a post-induced latent state or serve for additional rounds of activation following deacetylation of p65 by HDAC3. Thus, acetylation of p65 is essential for turning off NF-κB-mediated gene expression. Recently, the reversible acetylation of p65 was reported by Chenet al. (22Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Although both studies show that reversible acetylation of p65 by p300 and HDAC3 plays a critical role in NF-κB-transcriptional activity, the function attributed to p65 acetylation contrasts sharply between the two studies.

In contrast, we have shown that acetylation of p65 reduces its interaction with κB DNA and thereby promotes IκBα-mediated nuclear export. We were unable to demonstrate any significant effect of p65 acetylation on its interaction with IκBα (Fig. 3). Because Chen et al. did not identify the specific acetyl acceptor residues present in p65, their conclusions were based on experiments using the broadly acting HDAC inhibitor, TSA, to enhance acetylation. However, TSA induces global effects on acetylation in the cell and would influence the function of many acetylated substrates, which include coactivators, components of the basal transcription machinery, and proteins involved in nuclear import (34Bannister A.J.

Chen et al. showed that cotreatment of cells with tumor necrosis factor α and TSA enhances p65 DNA-binding activity. In contrast, a direct comparison of κB-DNA binding by acetylated and non-acetylated forms of p65 showed that acetylation of p65 lowered its affinity for κB-DNA (Fig. 4), which consequently promotes its IκBα-mediated export to the cytoplasm (Figs. 5, 7, and 8). Using a GST-IκBα pull-down assay, Chenet al. showed that cotransfection of p300 and p65 reduces the ability of GST-IκBα to interact with p65 and concluded that acetylation of p65 prevents its interaction with IκBα. We directly analyzed binding of IκBα to acetylated p65 by coimmunoprecipitation analysis using extracts from either [3H]NaAc or [35S]Met/Cys-labeled cells and found that most of the acetylated p65 in cells can be found in association with IκBα. Indeed, given that acetylation of p65 occurs in the nucleus (Fig. 5), the finding that acetylated p65 accumulates in the cytoplasm in an IκBα-dependent manner indicates that the interaction between p65 and IκBα is not abolished, because studies using knock-out mice have shown that nuclear export of NF-κB depends on its interaction with IκBα. The discrepancy between the conclusions reached by the two studies may be due to differences in the experimental approaches used. The importance of IκB-mediated NF-κB export from the nucleus and consequently the termination of NF-κB-dependent transcription has been provided from studies using IκBα knockout mice (36Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar, 37Klement J.F. Rice N.R. Car B.D. Abbondanzo S.J. Powers G.D. Bhatt P.H. Chen C.H. Rosen C.A. Stewart C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2341-2349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which IκBα removes NF-κB from DNA is unknown. The p50/p65 heterodimer has a particularly high affinity for κB-DNA, between 10−10 and 10−13 (38Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 39Urban M.B. Baeuerle P.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1975-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whereas the affinity of IκBα for the p50/p65 heterodimer is 10−9 (40Phelps C.B. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29840-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, the NF-κB/κB-DNA interaction would need to be destabilized so that IκB can compete for the removal of NF-κB from DNA. In agreement with this, Munshi et al. (41Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) found that IκBα was not able to remove NF-κB from DNA in the context of the INF-β enhanceosome. The crystal structure of the p50/p65 heterodimer bound to κB-DNA revealed that, among p65 residues involved in DNA binding, lysines 122 and 123 are the only residues that contact the DNA in the minor groove (31Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Our results show that acetylation of lysines 122 and 123 within p65 by p300 and PCAF reduces its affinity to κB-DNA (Fig. 3). Thus, we propose a model in which acetylation of p65 plays a role in IκB-mediated removal of NF-κB from DNA and termination of NF-κB-mediated transcription. In agreement with this model, the acetylated form of p65 accumulated in the cytoplasm in an IκBα-dependent manner, and the p65KK-RR mutant was less sensitive to IκBα-mediated termination of transcription and removal from κΒ-DNA than wild type p65 (Fig. 7). Analogous to the function attributed to p65 acetylation in this report, acetylation of high mobility group I(Y) by CBP has been shown to destabilize its interaction with DNA, which disrupts the enhanceosome and turns off INF-β gene expression (41Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The activity of NF-κB has been shown to be regulated by transcriptional coactivators that function by bridging the sequence-specific activators to the basal transcriptional machinery and play a role in chromatin remodeling via their intrinsic HAT or HDAC activity (15Roth S.Y.

Furthermore, acetyltransferase activity of CBP/p300 and PCAF enhance NF-κB transcriptional activity (19Sheppard K.A. Rose D.W. Haque Z.K. Kurokawa R. McInerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G.

Here, we show that p300 and PCAF HAT activities potentiate p65 transcriptional activity, whereas their FAT activities are repressive. Factor acetylation of p65 negatively regulates its transcriptional activity by lowering binding to κB-DNA and facilitating its removal and export by IκBα. Additionally, HDAC3 was more repressive toward p65KK-RR than p65 wt, suggesting that factor deacetylase activity of HDAC3 is involved in activating p65 transcriptional activity, perhaps by enhancing p65 binding to κB-DNA. Thus, p300 and PCAF acetyltransferase activities play a role in both transcriptional activation and post-induction turn-off of p65-mediated transcription. A similar functional duality has been previously demonstrated for high mobility group I(Y), which, together with other transcriptional activators, recruits HAT activity to the enhanceosome to stimulate transcription and serves itself as a target for acetylation leading to enhanceosome disassembly and turn-off of transcription (41Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The demonstration that p300 and PCAF are involved in both transcriptional activation and post-induction turn-off implies that their acetylation activity would need to be regulated in a temporal and substrate-dependent manner. What prevents p300 and PCAF from acetylating p65 immediately after their recruitment to the promoter? One possibility is that other substrates such as histones provide better targets for acetylation. In support of this, we have observed that acetylation of p65 by p300 and PCAF in vitrois ∼100-fold less efficient than that of nucleosomes (data not shown). Alternatively, the substrate specificity of p300 and PCAF acetylation activity may be regulated by post-translational modifications. Therefore, recruitment of p300 and/or PCAF by κB-DNA-bound p65 may lead first to chromatin derepression and transcriptional activation. Subsequently, p300 and PCAF may acetylate p65 to facilitate its removal from DNA by IκBα and its export to the cytoplasm to terminate NF-κB-mediated transcription. We thank F. Arenzana-Seisdedos, R.

https://openalex.org/W1997467265,"At vertebrate neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), Agrin plays pivotal roles in synapse development, but molecules that activate synapse formation at central synapses are largely unknown. Members of the Wnt family are well established as morphogens, yet recently they have also been implicated in synapse maturation. Here we demonstrate that the Drosophila Wnt, Wingless (Wg), is essential for synapse development. We show that Wg and its receptor are expressed at glutamatergic NMJs, and that Wg is secreted by synaptic boutons. Loss of Wg leads to dramatic reductions in target-dependent synapse formation, and new boutons either fail to develop active zones and postsynaptic specializations or these are strikingly aberrant. We suggest that Wg signals the coordinated development of pre- and postsynaptic compartments."

Here we show that JNK mediated feedback inhibition of the insulin signal in mouse embryo fibroblasts, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and 32DIR cells. Insulin stimulation of JNK activity required phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Grb2 signaling. Moreover, activation of JNK by insulin was inhibited by a cell-permeable peptide that disrupted the interaction of JNK with cellular proteins. However, the direct binding of JNK to Irs1 was not required for its activation by insulin, whereas direct binding was required for Ser307 phosphorylation of Irs1. Insulin-stimulated Ser307 phosphorylation was reduced 80% in cells lacking JNK1 and JNK2 or in cells expressing a mutant Irs1 protein lacking the JNK binding site. Reduced Ser307phosphorylation was directly related to increased insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, Akt phosphorylation, and glucose uptake.

Irs1 and Irs2 contain many potential serine or threonine phosphorylation sites that might play regulatory roles during the insulin response. Various metabolites associated with insulin resistance stimulate serine phosphorylation of Irs1, including free fatty acids, diacylglycerol, fatty acyl CoAs, ceramides, and glucose (17Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 171-176Google Scholar). Moreover, proinflammatory cytokines, especially interferon γ, interleukin 1β, or TNFα produced during infection, injury, or chronic obesity stimulate serine phosphorylation of Irs1 and cause insulin resistance (18Hotamisligil G.S.

Although many kinases phosphorylate Irs1, JNK is especially interesting because it associates with Irs1 and phosphorylates Ser307 (11Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol.

Insulin also stimulates Ser307phosphorylation in various cultured cell lines; and the orthologous site in human Irs1 (Ser312) is phosphorylated in muscle during a hyperinsulinemic clamp (24Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 181-189Google Scholar). Ser307 is located next to the phosphotyrosine-binding domain in Irs1, and its phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of the phosphotyrosine-binding domain with the phosphorylated NPEY motif in the activated insulin receptor (20Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1531-1537Google Scholar). Because the phosphotyrosine-binding domain is important for efficient insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Irs1, Ser307 phosphorylation might contribute to insulin resistance during physiological stress.JNK is a member of the MAP kinase family of protein kinases, which also includes ERK and p38 (25Weston C.R. Lambright D.G. Davis R.J. Science. 2002; 296: 2345-2347Google Scholar, 26Davis R.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 1-12Google Scholar).

Insulin stimulates JNK in various cells and tissues, but the mechanisms involved and the role of JNK during insulin action are poorly defined (41Miller B.S. Shankavaram U.T. Horney M.J. Gore A.C.

Here we show that insulin-stimulated JNK associates with Irs1 and phosphorylates Ser307, which inhibits insulin signaling. Thus, JNK might serve a dual function as a heterologous inhibitor of insulin action during acute and chronic inflammation and as a feedback inhibitor during insulin stimulation.DISCUSSIONOur cell-based experiments reveal that recruitment of active JNK to Irs1 might be a common mechanism for feedback or heterologous inhibition of the insulin signal. JNK is a member of the MAP kinase family, which also includes the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2), p38 MAP kinases, and the ERK5 pathway (25Weston C.R. Lambright D.G. Davis R.J. Science. 2002; 296: 2345-2347Google Scholar). MAP kinases are activated by dual-specificity MAP kinase kinases that phosphorylate adjacent tyrosine and threonine residues (29Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Google Scholar). During insulin stimulation, ERK1 and ERK2 are strongly activated by the dual-specificity kinases MEK1 or MEK2, which are activated when Grb2/Sos bound to Irs1 or Shc activates the Ras → Raf cascade (53Skolnik E.Y. Lee C.H. Batzer A.G. Vicentini L.M. Zhou M. Daly R.J. Myers M.G., Jr. Backer J.M. Ullrich A. White M.F. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1929-1936Google Scholar, 54Myers M.G., Jr. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Schlessinger J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3577-3587Google Scholar); however, a molecular pathway linking the receptors for proinflammatory cytokines or insulin to JNK is difficult to establish.JNK activation is best understood during cytokine stimulation, which involves the recruitment of an upstream multilineage kinase, a dual-specificity kinase (MKK4 or MKK7), and JNK into a regulatory complex including JNK-interacting protein Jip1 or Jip2 (49Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Google Scholar, 55Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Google Scholar). By contrast, previous studies suggest that insulin stimulates JNK through PI 3-kinase, Ras, or Shp2 (56Fukunaga K. Noguchi T. Takeda H. Matozaki T. Hayashi Y. Itoh H. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5208-5213Google Scholar). These distinct pathways might converge because the permeable JNK-binding peptide that disrupts TNFα-stimulated JNK activation also inhibits insulin-stimulated JNK; whether MLK and MKK4 or MKK7 are involved during insulin stimulation is unknown. Perhaps other kinase cascades are employed during insulin stimulation and are recruited with JNK by other scaffold proteins that contain a JNK-binding motif.Irs1 is required for insulin stimulation of JNK in 32DIRcells, because insulin barely stimulates JNK in these cells lacking Irs1. In 32DIR/Irs1 cells, the PI 3-kinase and the Ras → MEK1/2 → ERK1/2 cascades appear to be involved, because LY294002 or PD98059 significantly inhibit insulin-stimulated JNK activity. Although Irs1 contains a JNK-binding motif similar to that in Jip1 or Jip2, a direct interaction between JNK and Irs1 is not involved in the JNK activation during insulin stimulation. A mutant Irs1 protein lacking the JNK-binding motif mediates JNK activation normally in insulin-stimulated 32DIR cells. By contrast, F18Irs1, which lacks all the tyrosine phosphorylation sites but retains the JNK binding motif, fails to activate JNK during insulin stimulation and fails to bind inactive JNK. Thus, Irs1-mediated activation of the PI 3-kinase and Ras → MEK1/2 cascades is required for JNK activation, and Irs1 only binds activated JNK.Our results with 32DIR cells, MEFs, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes reveal that JNK is the principle kinase that mediates Ser307 phosphorylation during insulin stimulation. However, on inhibition of JNK through various strategies, some insulin-stimulated Ser307 phosphorylation still occurs. Many kinases are known to phosphorylate Irs1. Recent evidence indicates that IKKβ can directly phosphorylate Irs1 Ser307 (57Gao Z. Hwang D. Bataille F. Lefevre M. York D. Quon M. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48115-48121Google Scholar). In addition, the possibility exists that mTOR phosphorylates Ser307. We showed previously that insulin stimulates Ser307 phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes without activating JNK (24Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 181-189Google Scholar). Apparently, unknown differences in insulin signaling in preadipocytes disrupt the link between the insulin receptor and JNK, whereas other cell lines including 32D cells, MEF cells, and adipocytes show strong activation of JNK in response to insulin. Differential coupling between the insulin receptor and JNK might play an important role in feedback regulation of the insulin signaling cascade.JNK has many effects on cellular function because it phosphorylates and activates various transcription factors, including ATF2 and ATFa, c-Jun and JunD, and Elk1 and Sap1 (28Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Google Scholar). Although insulin stimulation of JNK might play an important role in gene transcription as revealed in other systems, our results also suggest that JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Ser307 in rodent Irs1 mediates negative feedback of insulin signaling. Insulin stimulates the binding of activated JNK to Irs1 in 3T3-L1 and 32DIR/Irs1 cells, which attenuates insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. Consistent with this hypothesis, disruption of the consensus JNK-binding motif in Irs1 significantly reduces the phosphorylation of Ser307 during insulin stimulation and increases insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and Pkb/Akt activation. Moreover, inhibition of JNK activation by incubating 3T3-L1 adipocytes with a permeable TAT/JNK-binding peptide promotes insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. This result is consistent with reduced insulin-stimulated JNK activity and Ser307 phosphorylation and increased Irs1 tyrosine phosphorylation and Pkb/Akt phosphorylation. Experiments with mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking JNK1 and JNK2 also support these results. The possibility is not excluded that the binding of JNK to Irs1 itself might have some inhibitory effect in addition to Ser307phosphorylation, such as competing with other proteins for binding to Irs1. Although our attention for the moment focuses on Ser307 phosphorylation, additional serine residues might also be involved. Moreover, we have not distinguished between JNK1 or JNK2 in our experiments, because both homologs bind to Irs1 (data not shown).Insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia dysregulate many physiological processes that contribute to life-threatening metabolic, vascular, and cardiac diseases (58DeFronzo R.A. Diabetes Rev. 1997; 5: 177-269Google Scholar, 59Facchini F.S. Hua N.W. Reaven G.M. Stoohs R.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 1302-1306Google Scholar). Although new drugs are emerging to improve insulin sensitivity, the molecular mechanisms that cause insulin resistance are difficult to establish. The idea that inflammation causes insulin resistance has been known for a long time (60Baron S.H. Diabetes Care. 1982; 5: 64-71Google Scholar) and is consistent with the idea that anti-inflammatory drugs like high-dose aspirin promote insulin sensitivity (22Yuan M. Konstantopoulos N. Lee J. Hansen L., Li, Z.W. Karin M. Shoelson S.E. Science. 2001; 293: 1673-1677Google Scholar, 61Kim J.K. Kim Y.J. Fillmore J.J. Chen Y. Moore I. Lee J. Yuan M., Li, Z.W. Karin M. Perret P. Shoelson S.E. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 437-446Google Scholar). The physiological response to infection, physical or thermal trauma, or obesity invariably involves the production of proinflammatory cytokines like TNFα that activate various serine kinases (28Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Google Scholar). Considerable evidence suggests that serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor or the Irs proteins might inhibit insulin signaling and promote insulin resistance (62White M.F. Myers M.G. DeGroot L.J. Jameson J.L. Endocrinology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2001: 712-727Google Scholar). During obesity, adipocytes produce TNFα, which promotes insulin resistance and stimulates serine phosphorylation of Irs1, whereas disruption of TNFR1 partially restores insulin signaling and glucose tolerance in obese mice (18Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budvari A. Ellis R.W. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Google Scholar, 63Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Google Scholar, 64Peraldi P. Hotamisligil G.S. Buurman W.A. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13018-13022Google Scholar, 65Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Hotamisligil G.S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4832-4838Google Scholar, 66Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Marino M.W. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 610-614Google Scholar). The signaling cascades regulated by TNFα are complex and involve many branch points, including the activation of JNK, p38, and the IKKβ (28Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Google Scholar). IKKβ might also be important because high doses of salicylates that inhibit IKKβ improve glucose tolerance in obese mice (22Yuan M. Konstantopoulos N. Lee J. Hansen L., Li, Z.W. Karin M. Shoelson S.E. Science. 2001; 293: 1673-1677Google Scholar, 61Kim J.K. Kim Y.J. Fillmore J.J. Chen Y. Moore I. Lee J. Yuan M., Li, Z.W. Karin M. Perret P. Shoelson S.E. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 437-446Google Scholar). Salicylates increase insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS proteins in the liver, revealing a potential mechanism for their effect on insulin action; the effect might occur indirectly through other downstream kinases, through NFκB-regulated gene expression. or through direct phosphorylation of Irs1 (57Gao Z. Hwang D. Bataille F. Lefevre M. York D. Quon M. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48115-48121Google Scholar). By contrast, a direct role for JNK to regulate insulin signaling is compelling, because both Irs1 and Irs2 contain a JNK-binding motif. Other kinases might also bind to this motif and with JNK explain, at least in part, insulin resistance that occurs during trauma and obesity.In summary, JNK mediates feedback inhibition of insulin signaling by phosphorylation of rat/mouse Irs1 at Ser307(Ser312 in human Irs1). In addition to our experiments with 32DIR/Irs1 cells, MEF cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin is reported to stimulate JNK activity in Rat-1 fibroblast, Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human insulin receptors, L6 myotubes, and rat adipocytes (41Miller B.S. Shankavaram U.T. Horney M.J. Gore A.C. Kurtz D.T. Rosenzweig S.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8769-8775Google Scholar, 42Desbois-Mouthon C. Blivet-Van Eggelpoel M.J. Auclair M. Cherqui G. Capeau J. Caron M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 765-770Google Scholar, 43Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Antwi E.K. Farese R.V. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2145-2151Google Scholar). These results suggest that activated JNK might be an important negative feedback regulator for insulin signaling, and thus inhibiting JNK or interfering with JNK-Irs1 interaction might be a good therapeutic target to reduce insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a common problem that is associated with obesity and hypertension, infection and injury, and type 2 diabetes, in which β-cells fail to secrete sufficient insulin to compensate for peripheral insulin resistance (1Carter E.A. Nutr. Rev. 1998; 56: S170-S176Google Scholar, 2Mizock B.A. Am. J. Med. 1995; 98: 75-84Google Scholar, 3Taylor S.I. Cell. 1999; 97: 9-12Google Scholar). Insulin signaling complexes are assembled by insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of scaffold proteins, including the Irs1 1 proteins, Shc, APS and Shc, Gab1/2, Dock1/2 and cbl (4Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Google Scholar, 5Nelms K. O'Neill T.J., Li, S. Hubbard S.R. Gustafson T.A. Paul W.E. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1160-1167Google Scholar, 6Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Google Scholar). Although the role of each of these substrates merits attention, work with transgenic mice reveals the importance of Irs1 and Irs2 for somatic growth and carbohydrate metabolism (7Withers D.J. White M.F. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diab. 1999; 6: 141-145Google Scholar, 8Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Irs1 and Irs2 bind to the Src homology-2 domain in various signaling proteins that mediate the insulin response, including PI 3-kinase, Grb2, Shp2, Crk, and others (9Yenush L. White M.F. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 491-500Google Scholar). A number of mechanisms might contribute to the dysregulation of the insulin-signaling pathway, including serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor or the Irs proteins, degradation of Irs proteins, or altered activity of phosphoprotein or phospholipid phosphatases (10Rui L. Fisher T.L. Thomas J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40362-40367Google Scholar, 11Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol.

Irs1 and Irs2 contain many potential serine or threonine phosphorylation sites that might play regulatory roles during the insulin response. Various metabolites associated with insulin resistance stimulate serine phosphorylation of Irs1, including free fatty acids, diacylglycerol, fatty acyl CoAs, ceramides, and glucose (17Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 171-176Google Scholar). Moreover, proinflammatory cytokines, especially interferon γ, interleukin 1β, or TNFα produced during infection, injury, or chronic obesity stimulate serine phosphorylation of Irs1 and cause insulin resistance (18Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budvari A. Ellis R.W. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Google Scholar, 19Kanety H. Feinstein R. Papa M.Z. Hemi R. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23780-23784Google Scholar). Insulin itself induces serine phosphorylation of Irs1, suggesting that chronic compensatory hyperinsulinemia in response to stress-induced insulin resistance might exacerbate the problem (20Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1531-1537Google Scholar). More than 100 potential serine phosphorylation sites exist in Irs1, and many protein kinases phosphorylate Irs1, including JNK, protein kinase Cζ, IKKβ, mammalian target of rapamycin, MAPK, and AMPK (11Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Google Scholar, 12Liu Y.F. Paz K. Herschkovitz A. Alt A. Tennenbaum T. Sampson S.R. Ohba M. Kuroki T. LeRoith D. Zick Y.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46912-46916Google Scholar); however, the kinases and phosphorylation sites that are physiologically important for Irs1 function are difficult to resolve. Although many kinases phosphorylate Irs1, JNK is especially interesting because it associates with Irs1 and phosphorylates Ser307 (11Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Google Scholar, 20Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1531-1537Google Scholar). Insulin also stimulates Ser307phosphorylation in various cultured cell lines; and the orthologous site in human Irs1 (Ser312) is phosphorylated in muscle during a hyperinsulinemic clamp (24Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 181-189Google Scholar). Ser307 is located next to the phosphotyrosine-binding domain in Irs1, and its phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of the phosphotyrosine-binding domain with the phosphorylated NPEY motif in the activated insulin receptor (20Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1531-1537Google Scholar). Because the phosphotyrosine-binding domain is important for efficient insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Irs1, Ser307 phosphorylation might contribute to insulin resistance during physiological stress. JNK is a member of the MAP kinase family of protein kinases, which also includes ERK and p38 (25Weston C.R. Lambright D.G. Davis R.J. Science. 2002; 296: 2345-2347Google Scholar, 26Davis R.J.

Patients with OHO share similar manifestations with ADHR such as hypophosphatemia, decreased or inappropriately normal 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations, and osteomalacia. Recent studies indicated administration of the recombinant FGF23 protein reduced serum phosphate without affecting serum calcium, as well as increasing renal phosphate excretion in mice.

These results suggested FGF23 might inhibit renal sodium-dependent phosphate (Na/Pi) co-transporter activity. However, according to the results from the in vitro studies using opossum kidney cells, the FGF23 effects on Na/Pico-transporter are still controversial (4Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T.

To investigate the mechanisms of the FGF23 action on phosphate homeostasis in vivo, we transiently introduced the FGF23 mutant expression plasmids into rodents by the naked DNA injection, and examined changes in biochemical parameters, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D metabolites. Also, we examined the phosphate uptake of brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) isolated from the kidney and intestine of the naked DNA-injected animals to assess the effect of FGF23 mutant on Na/Pi co-transport activity in kidney and intestine. Furthermore, we investigated target organs of hFGF23 by using the thyroparathyroidectomized rat model and the adenine-induced rat nephritis model. Full-length human FGF23 cDNA was cloned from commercially available human heart cDNA library (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by PCR, using the forward primer (5′-GGAATTCTCGAGCCACCATGTTGGGGGCCCGCCTCAGGCTCTG-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-GGAATTCTCGAGCTACTAGATGAACTTGGCGAAGG-3′). The PCR conditions were: an initial 2-min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 60 s at 60 °C, 40 s at 94 °C, and a final 7-min extension at 72 °C. The 750-bp PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) plasmid. The identity of each cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (model 377 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Mutagenesis was performed according to a method called “recombinant polymerase chain reaction” (10Higuchi R. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar). To generate the expression vector for FGF23 mutants, DNA fragments amplified by PCR were inserted into a TA cloning vector, pCR2.1-TOPO (BD Biosciences Clontech). The DNA sequences of the obtained cDNAs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were digested with EcoRI and then the fragments were inserted into a unique EcoRI site between the CAG promoter and a 3′-flanking sequence of the rabbit β-globin gene in the pCAGGS3 expression plasmid, which was kindly provided by Dr. Miyazaki (11Miyazaki J.

The empty pCAGGS3 plasmid was used as a MOCK control. All the plasmids were grown inEscherichia coli DH5α cells, and prepared with a Qiagen EndFree Plasmid Giga kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). The quantity and the quality of the plasmids were determined by measuring absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. Naked DNA injection solution containing 10 μg of pCGF23, pCGFM1, pCGFM2, pCGFM3, pCGFM4, and pCGFM5 or MOCK plasmid was prepared using the TransIT® in vivo gene delivery system (TaKaRa, Osaka, Japan) immediately before injection. 5 × 106 of COS cells suspended in 400 μl of Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum was transfected with 10 μg of pCGFM2-F plasmid, the expression plasmid of C-terminal FLAG (residues DYKDDDDK)-tagged hFGF23R179Q, by electroporation. Transfected cells were grown in the 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium overnight and then incubated in serum-free CHO-S-SFMII (Invitrogen) medium for 3 days. The conditioned media were collected and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min to remove the cell pellets. The supernatant was applied to the anti-FLAG antibody affinity column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 80 and eluted with 0.5 m glycine/HCl (pH 3.5). Purified C-terminal FLAG-tagged hFGF32R179Q protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the Western blot using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). COS cells (5 × 106) were seeded on 100-mm culture dishes and transiently transfected in serum-free medium with the FuGENETM 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) using 1 μg of plasmid DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, the incubation was continued for an additional 48 h. Conditioned media were concentrated ∼20 times with Centricon-10 columns (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) at 4 °C. The concentrated culture media were applied to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) by semi-dry electroblotting. The expressed N-FLAG-tagged proteins were detected by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium phosphatase substrate system (KPL Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) used as a first antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (ZyMed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA) as a second antibody. Seven-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 180 g were purchased from Charles River (Tokyo, Japan) and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions with a 12-h light/dark cycle. All rats were allowed unlimited access to a normal rodent food (CE-2, CREA Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and tap water. After acclimating for 1 week, animals were intravenously injected with 12 ml of a DNA solution containing 10 μg of each expression plasmid, pCGF23, pCGFM1, pCGFM2, pCGFM3, pCGFM4, pCGFM5, pCGF23NF, pCGFM2NF, as described above, or MOCK plasmid under light anesthesia. Four days after the naked DNA injection, blood samples were obtained from the vena cava under ether anesthesia. Serum calcium, serum inorganic phosphorus, urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine were measured by an automatic analyzer (Type 7170E, Hitachi Corp., Japan). Serum concentration of the C-terminal portion of hFGF-23 was determined by the Human FGF-23 (C-term) ELISA Kit (Immunotopics Inc., San Clemente, CA). Purified C-terminal FLAG-tagged human FGF-23 protein was used as a standard. Serum 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D was determined by the radioreceptor assay (Mitsubishi BCL, Tokyo, Japan). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were measured by competitive protein binding assay (Mitsubishi BCL). Serum PTH was determined by the Rat Intact PTH ELISA Kit (Immunotopics, Inc., San Clemente, CA). In the case of mice, 7-week-old male CD-1 mice (Charles River Japan) weighing ∼30 g were maintained under the same conditions as the rats described above. 3 ml of DNA solution containing 10 μg of expression plasmid was intravenously injected into the mice. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with Chugai Pharmaceutical's ethical guidelines of animal care, and all experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the institution. Liver total RNA in naked DNA-injected animals was extracted with ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus H− reverse transcriptase (Superscript, Invitrogen), oligo(dT)12–18 primer. The relative amount of FGF23 cDNA compared with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA was determined by a Model 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). BBMVs were prepared from the rat kidney by the Ca2+ precipitation methods as previously described (12Katai K. Miyamoto K. Kishida S. Segawa H. Nii T. Tanaka H. Tani Y Arai H. Tatsumi S. Morita K.

The uptake of radiolabeled Pi was measured by the rapid filtration technique. Reaction was initiated by mixing 20 μl of the vesicle suspension with 80 μl of incubation solution (100 mm mannitol, 125 mmNaCl, 20 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1 mmKH2PO4) and incubated at 25 °C for 1 min. The measurement of Na+-dependent and Na+-independent Pi uptake was performed as described previously. The transport reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of an ice-cold stop solution (100 mm mannitol, 100 mm choline chloride, 20 mm MgSO4, 20 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.4), and 5 mmKH2PO4). The reaction mixture was immediately transferred to a premoistened filter (0.45 μm) maintained under vacuum. Seven-week-old male Wistar rats (CLEA Japan Inc.) were maintained with a CE-2 diet containing 1.18% calcium and 1.03% phosphorus. To induce adenine-induced nephritis (15Yokozawa T. Zheng P.D. Oura H. Koizumi F. Nephron. 1986; 44: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), rats were administered orally 240 mg/kg body weight of adenine dissolved in carboxymethyl cellulose, 5 days per week for 3 weeks. At Day 21, rats were intravenously injected 12 ml of DNA solution containing 10 μg of each expression plasmid, pCGF23, pCGFM2, or MOCK. From then, rats were administered the adenine solution everyday. Blood samples were obtained at Day 28 from the jugular vein under ether anesthesia. Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats purchased from Charles River (Tokyo, Japan) were thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) under ether anesthesia. After confirming that hypocalcemia was induced, rats were fixed in Ballman cages and administered either vehicle, PTH-(1–34) at a constant rate of 0.3 nmol/ml/h, or C-terminal FLAG-tagged hFGF23R179Q protein at a constant rate of 6 μg/ml/h for 6 h through an intravenous catheter (PE-50, IntramedicTM, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) placed into the femoral vein (16Horiuchi N. Rosenblatt M. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: E187-E192PubMed Google Scholar). The vehicle solution contained 0.05% Tween 80 in saline. Total blood was collected at 6 h via the vena cava under ether anesthesia. Serum inorganic phosphorus and serum calcium were determined by an automatic analyzer. Data were expressed as means ± S.E., and statistical significance was determined using SAS and Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Eight-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were intravenously administered 12 ml of the naked DNA solution containing 10 μg of pCGF23, pCGFM2, or MOCK plasmid. Animals were sacrificed to collect blood samples at Day 4. Rats injected with hFGF23R179Q mutant expression plasmid, pCGFM2, demonstrated a significantly low serum inorganic phosphorus concentration at an average of 6.2 mg/dl, compared with MOCK control of 8.5 mg/dl. However, administration of native human FGF23 expression plasmid, pCGF23, did not induce hypophosphatemia. Serum inorganic phosphorus remained at a normal value of 8.6 mg/dl (Fig. 1). Hypophosphatemic activity was compared among all ADHR mutants (R176Q, R179Q, R179W) and double mutants (R176Q/R179Q, R176Q/R179W) using naked DNA injection of mice. There was no difference in the hypophosphatemic activity among the three ADHR mutants. Also, no synergistic and/or additional effect was observed in the double mutants, suggesting one missense mutation is sufficient to produce hypophosphatemic activity (Table I). Other serum biochemical parameters such as serum calcium, serum urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine were within a normal range among all mice, as shown in Table I. Therefore, naked DNA injection of the hFGF23 mutant expression plasmids induced hypophosphatemia in both rats and mice, and it was not due to a physical impairment of the nephron caused by the rapid and transient blood volume expansion.Table ISerum biochemical parameters of the FGF23 or the FGF23 mutants injected miceInorganic phosphorusCalciumCreatinineUrea nitrogenmg/dlMOCK8.5 ± 0.29.3 ± 0.10.33 ± 0.0123.1 ± 0.8FGF238.6 ± 0.49.4 ± 0.10.41 ± 0.0631.1 ± 3.7R176Q6.9 ± 0.31-ap < 0.05, by Student's ttest.9.3 ± 0.10.33 ± 0.0122.0 ± 0.4R179Q6.2 ± 0.21-ap < 0.05, by Student's ttest.9.2 ± 0.20.30 ± 0.0122.9 ± 0.7R179W6.8 ± 0.61-ap < 0.05, by Student's ttest.9.6 ± 0.30.34 ± 0.0122.4 ± 1.5R176Q/R179Q7.4 ± 0.39.5 ± 0.20.31 ± 0.0120.8 ± 1.5R176Q/R179W7.5 ± 0.31-ap < 0.05, by Student's ttest.9.8 ± 0.20.34 ± 0.0122.9 ± 1.31-a p < 0.05, by Student's ttest. Open table in a new tab Previous reports indicated injected naked DNA plasmids were mainly incorporated in the liver and remained expressed for 2–4 weeks (17Jiang J Yamato E Miyazaki J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1088-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To assess an expression level of the injected plasmids, liver total RNA in the injected rats was isolated using ISOGEN. Expression ratio of hFGF23 or hFGF23R179Q mRNA in comparison with endogenous glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA in the liver was determined by the quantitative RT-PCR. Both hFGF23 and hFGF23R179Q mutant mRNA were highly expressed in the injected animals 100-fold more than in MOCK control animals on Day 4 (Fig. 2 A). However, as shown in Fig. 2 B, the C-terminal portion of human FGF-23 protein was detected only in the serum from the FGF23R179Q-injected rat (1109 pg/ml). The C-terminal hFGF23 level was below the detection limit in the sera from the hFGF23-injected rat and the MOCK-injected rats. The Western blot analysis revealed that the N-terminal FLAG-tagged human FGF23 was not secreted as an intact form with a putative molecular mass of 32 kDa but rather as a smaller 20-kDa peptide (Fig. 2 C) in the COS cell-conditioned media, whereas, the N-terminal FLAG-tagged human FGF23R179Q mutant was secreted in the conditioned media as an unchanged 32-kDa protein. These observations suggest that native hFGF23 protein was cleaved into a 20-kDa peptide by intracellular protease(s), presumably at the RXXR motif from residues Arg-176 to Arg-179, and then lost its hypophosphatemic activity. Serum concentration of vitamin D metabolites in the rat serum was measured by radioreceptor assay using purified calf thymus vitamin D receptor. Serum 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the FGF23R179Q-injected rats was decreased to less than the detection limit at 15 pg/ml. The hFGF23 or the MOCK-injected rats remained within the normal range at 132 and 115 pg/ml, respectively (Fig. 3). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations were also low in the hFGF23R179Q-injected rats. Thus, hFGF23R179Q inhibited vitamin D hydroxylation both in the kidney and liver. The sodium-dependent phosphate co-transport activities were determined in the isolated BBMVs from the kidney and the small intestine (jejunum). Na+-dependent phosphate uptake of the BBMVs from the kidney was suppressed ∼45% in the hFGF23R179Q-injected rats (Fig. 4 A). In the small intestine, hFGF23R179Q injection reduced Na+-dependent phosphate uptake of the BBMVs by about 30%, as shown in Fig. 4 B. To investigate the contribution of the intestinal Na/Pi co-transporters to the hypophosphatemic activity of hFGF23R179Q, we used the adenine-induced nephritis rat model. Adenine-induced nephritis rats were developed by oral administration of adenine for 3 weeks, which resulted in severe renal dysfunction with extremely elevated serum inorganic phosphorus (Fig. 5 A) and creatinine (Fig. 5 B). hFGF23R179Q had no effect on serum inorganic phosphorus of adenine-induced nephritis rats. This observation indicated that hypophosphatemic activity of the hFGF23R179Q is mainly due to the inhibition of the renal Na/Pi co-transporter, so that the hFGF23R179Q loses its hypophosphatemic activity when renal function was diminished. As shown in Table II, the serum PTH of hFGF23R179Q rats was slightly lower than that of MOCK or hFGF23 rats; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) rats were administered either vehicle, PTH-(1–34) (0.3 nmol/ml/h) or C-FLAG hFGF23R179Q protein (6 μg/ml/h) for 6 h through an intravenous catheter into the femoral vein, and then serum inorganic phosphorus and serum calcium were determined. Hyperphosphatemia induced by TPTX was cured by the infusion of hFGF23R179Q protein as well as PTH-(1–34) (Fig. 6 A). The PTH-(1–34) administration also restored serum calcium; however, hFGF23R179Q did not affect serum calcium (Fig. 6 B), suggesting that hFGF23R179Q reduces phosphate reabsorption, independent of PTH action.Table IISerum PTH concentration of the hFGF23 or the FGF23R179Q mutant-injected ratsSerum PTHpg/mlMOCK70.9 ± 15.7FGF2355.0 ± 8.8FGF23R179Q48.6 ± 5.6 Open table in a new tab Gene transfer by in vivo intravenous injection of hFGF23 expression plasmid into rodents increases the level of mRNA expression in the liver more than 100-fold compared with the MOCK control. Expression of exogenous DNA remains for 2–4 weeks (17Jiang J Yamato E Miyazaki J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1088-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that hFGF23R179Q mutant decreases serum inorganic phosphorus and inhibits low phosphate-induced 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 production in proximal tubules by naked DNA injectionin vivo. Also, we demonstrated that hFGF23R179Q inhibits the renal phosphate reabsorption without affecting parathyroid hormone secretion (18Murer H. Hernando N. Foester I. Biber J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1373-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 19Drezner M.K. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 9-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20John M.R.

However, injection of the native hFGF23 expression plasmid failed to show these effects, which may be due to the intracellular degradation of the hFGF23 protein during the secretion. Previous reports (4Shimada T. Mizutani S. Muto T. Yoneya T. Hino R. Takeda S. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6500-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the C-terminal 6xHis- or V5/6xHis-tagged hFGF23 proteins were secreted into the cell-conditioned media partly as an intact form. Injection of purified C-His-hFGF23 proteins in mice resulted in lower serum inorganic phosphorus, as is observed in the mice bearing the CHO cells overexpressing C-His-hFGF23. White et al. (8Shimada T. Muto T. Urakawa I. Yoneya T. Yamazaki Y. Okawa K. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T.

Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 2079-2086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) reported that the FGF23R176Q mutant becomes resistant to the protein processing in the secretion machinery. It was also true for the C-His-FGF23, which is partially secreted as a 32-kDa protein to the conditioned media. On the other hand, N-FLAG-tagged hFGF23 was mostly secreted as a 20-kDa degraded form (Fig. 2 C). In our study, the C-FLAG-hFGF23 was partly secreted as a 32-kDa form and had a hypophosphatemic activity (data not shown). According to these results, hFGF23 looses the hypophosphatemic activity when cleaved at a position between Arg-176 and Arg-179. Tumors isolated from patients with OHO overexpressed native hFGF23 but not the mutant form. Inoculation of the extracted tumor into nude mice induced hypophosphatemic rickets-like phenotype (21Miyauchi A. Fukase M. Tsutsumi M. Fujita T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 67: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These observations indicate FGF23 in the OHO tumor cells is not fully cleaved somehow during the secretory process. It is unlikely that an excess amount of hFGF23 overwhelms abundant intracellular subtilisin-like protein convertases, thus, it remains possible that one or more other factors expressed in the tumor cell inhibit FGF23 degradation. The hFGF23R179Q mutant suppressed the Na/Pi co-transport activity both in the kidney and in the small intestine in vivo. The hFGF23R179Q lost its ability to reduce serum phosphorus when the proximal tubules in the kidney were impaired by adenine administration, suggesting that the hFGF23R179Q-induced hypophosphatemia occurs mainly through inhibition of the phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubules, and thus, the renal Na/Pi co-transport activity seems more important for the overall Pi homeostasis in vivo. Dietary Pi, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone are three major physiological regulators of phosphate homeostasis. In particular, parathyroid hormone (PTH) induces phosphaturia by inhibiting the Na/Pi co-transport activity in kidney. Thyroparathyroidectomy leads to a moderate hyperphosphatemia with an increase in the Na/Pi co-transport activity. Whereas, the human FGF23 mRNA was expressed relatively highly in the thyroid/parathyroid tissue determined by RT-PCR, it is plausible that hFGF23 works as an autocrine/paracrine factor in the thyroid/parathyroid, and regulates hormone secretion such as PTH, thyroid hormone, and calcitonin. Our study indicates that hFGF23R179Q can act as a systemic factor, by normalizing serum phosphorus without changing serum calcium. Moreover, the hFGF23R179Q-naked DNA injection did not affect serum PTH (Table II). Therefore, the mechanism of the FGF23 action in regulating phosphate homeostasis is independent of PTH, thyroid hormone, and calcitonin. The naked DNA injection was successfully applied to evaluate thein vivo biological activity of the FGF23, because the FGF23 was a secreted protein and required only small amount to influence phosphate metabolism. This technique may be applied to other humoral factors such as peptide hormones and cytokines (22Rizzuto G. Cappelletti M. Maione D. Savino R. Lazzaeo D. Costa P. Mathiesen I. Cortese R. Ciligerto G.

Thus, a small amount of FGF23 protein is sufficient to induce hypophosphatemia in rodents. This technique would also make further in vivo studies possible with regard to investigating the relationship between FGF23 and PHEX (phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome) and/or between FGF23 and FGF receptors. Both identifying the true target organs/cells and clarification of the detailed action of FGF23 will give us new insights in understanding phosphate homeostasis, and it will lead to the development of novel diagnostic or therapeutic reagents for diseases accompanying abnormal phosphate homeostasis.

A retrotransposition assay in HeLa cells demonstrated that the 3′ conserved tail of UnaL2 is necessary for its retrotransposition. This 3′ tail is recognized in trans by the UnaL2 reverse transcriptase at a surprisingly high rate, and that of UnaSINE1 can also be recognized, thus providing experimental evidence that a SINE can be mobilized by the retrotransposition machinery of a partner LINE. We also demonstrated that short repeats at the 3′ end of UnaL2 are required for retrotransposition suggesting that UnaL2 retrotransposes in a manner reminiscent of the reverse transcriptase activity of telomerases."

We have previously demonstrated that BMP-15 regulates granulosa cell (GC) proliferation and differentiation; namely, BMP-15 promotes GC mitosis, suppresses follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor expression, and stimulates kit ligand expression. Although the role of BMP-15 in female reproduction has progressively deserved much attention, there is nothing known to date about the signaling pathway and receptors for BMP-15. Using rat primary GCs and a human GC cell line, COV434, we have now found that administration of BMP-15 causes a rapid and transient phosphorylation, thus activation, of the Smad1/5/8 pathway. BMP-15 also stimulated promoter activity of a selective BMP-responsive reporter construct, further demonstrating the stimulation of Smad1/5/8 signaling by BMP-15. In contrast, BMP-15 stimulation of Smad2 phosphorylation was very weak. To identify the receptors for BMP-15, we utilized recombinant extracellular domains of individual transforming growth factor-β superfamily receptors and found that activin receptor-like kinase-6 extracellular domain most effectively co-immunoprecipitates with BMP-15, whereas BMP receptor type II extracellular domain was most effective in inhibiting BMP-15 bioactivity on FSH-induced progesterone production and GC thymidine incorporation. We also investigated whether activation of the MAPK pathway is necessary for BMP-15 biological activity and found that the addition of U0126, an inhibitor of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suppresses BMP-15 activity on GC mitotsis but not on FSH-induced progesterone production, suggesting a selective signaling cascade in GC proliferation and differentiation.

The importance of BMP-15 in fertility in sheep was exemplified by the demonstration that naturally occurring mutations in the bmp15 gene in Inverdale (FecXI) and Hanna (FecXH) ewes caused an increase in the ovulation rate in heterozygotes due, in part, to an increased FSH sensitivity of GCs but caused infertility in homozygotes due to a block in the primary stage of folliculogenesis (9Galloway S.M. McNatty K.P. Cambridge L.M. Laitinen M.P.E. Juengel J.L. Jokiranta T.S. McLaren R.J. Luiro K. Dodds K.G. Montgomery G.W. Beattie A.E. Davis G.H. Ritvos O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Mice with targeted deletions in thebmp15 gene are subfertile, demonstrating the importance of BMP-15 in fertility in the mouse as well (10Yan C. Wang P. DeMayo J. DeMayo F.J. Elvin J.A. Carino C. Prasad S.V. Skinner S.S. Dunbar B.S. Dube J.L. Celeste A.J. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 854-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The TGF-β superfamily consists of over 30 members, which are classified into the superfamily based upon structural homology (1Dube J.L. Wang P. Elvin J. Lyons K.M. Celeste A.J. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1809-1817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Griffith D.L. Keck P.C. Sampath T.K. Rueger D.C. Carlson W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A common feature of most of the members of the TGF-β superfamily is the presence of seven conserved cysteine residues, six of which form a characteristic “cysteine knot” structure and one of which forms a disulfide bridge between two subunits, making the molecule a covalently linked dimer (12Vitt U.A. Hsu S.Y. Hsueh A.J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 681-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BMP-15 and its closest homologue, GDF-9, which is also an oocyte-derived factor, are unique among the TGF-β superfamily in that they lack the conserved fourth cysteine, which is responsible for the dimerization of the subunits (1Dube J.L. Wang P. Elvin J. Lyons K.M. Celeste A.J. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1809-1817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is not known whether BMP-15 exists as noncovalently linked dimers or as monomers. Despite the established importance of BMP-15 in female fertility, the receptors and signaling pathways for BMP-15 have yet to be identified. Receptors for the majority of TGF-β superfamily members consist of two closely related subsets of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, the type I and type II receptors (13Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). To date, seven type I and five type II receptors have been identified in mammals. Upon binding of dimeric TGF-β superfamily members to specific type I and type II receptors, the receptor complexes cause the phosphorylation of intracellular signaling molecules called Smads, which then translocate to the nucleus and regulate transcription of target genes (14Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 15Itoh S. Itoh F. Goumans M.-J. ten Dijke P. Eur. J.

The receptor-regulated Smads can be grouped into two subsets; Smad2 and Smad3 are activated by TGF-β and activin, whereas Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are activated by BMPs. For this signaling to occur, the ligand must bind both type I and type II receptors, but the specificity of the Smad signaling pathway, which is stimulated by a particular TGF-β superfamily ligand, is determined by the type I receptor (17Macias-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In addition to Smad signaling, recent studies have demonstrated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of signaling molecules can modulate the signal transduction of TGF-β superfamily members through cross-talk with the Smad pathway in certain physiological circumstances (18Von Bubnoff A. Cho K.W.Y. Dev. Biol. 2001; 239: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Currently, there is nothing known about the receptors or signaling pathway of BMP-15. Given BMP-15's unique structure compared with other TGF-β superfamily members, it is possible that BMP-15 uses unique receptors and signaling; however, it has been speculated that BMP-15 may use one or more of the established activin, TGF-β, or BMP receptors and may stimulate a subsequent Smad signaling pathway (19Wilson T., Wu, X.-Y.

In the present study, we investigate whether BMP-15 can use previously identified TGF-β superfamily receptors and can activate specific Smad signaling pathways. We also investigate whether ERK1/2 signaling molecules play a role in mediating the biological activities of BMP-15. For these studies, we use two GC models, rat primary GCs from early antral follicles and a human GC cell line, COV434 (35Van Den Berg-Bakker C.A.M. Hagemeijer A. Franken-Postma E.M. Smit V.T.H.B.M.

The rat primary GC model has been well established and used to elucidate the biological activity of recombinant BMP-15 by our laboratory (4Otsuka F. Yao Z. Lee T.H. Yamamoto S. Erickson G.F.

COV434 cells are an immortalized human GC cell line that has retained the ability to produce estradiol upon FSH stimulation, thus demonstrating the presence of functional FSH receptors (36Zhang H. Vollmer M., De Geyter M. Litzistorf Y. Ladewig A. Dürrenberger M. Guggenheim R. Miny P. Holzgreve W. De Geyter C. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2000; 6: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Diethystilbestrol was purchased from Sigma, and U0126, an inhibitor of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, was fromPromega Corp. (Madison, WI). Female Sprague-Dawley rats were from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Recombinant extracellular domains (ECDs) fused to the Fc region of human IgG (receptor-ECD/Fc chimera) of human BMPR-II, ActR-II, ALK-3 (BMPR-IA), ALK-6 (BMPR-IB), and ALK-2 (ActR-IA) were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant human BMP-6 and BMP-7 were generously provided by Dr. Kuber Sampath. Recombinant rat activin-A was produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified using a follistatin affinity column followed by two steps of reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (6Otsuka F. Shimasaki S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8060-8065Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Recombinant human BMP-15 tagged with a FLAG epitope was produced by 293 cells and purified using anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma) as reported previously (4Otsuka F. Yao Z. Lee T.H. Yamamoto S. Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39523-39528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Female Sprague-Dawley rats (23 days old) were implanted with silastic capsules containing 10 mg of diethystilbestrol to increase GC number. After 4 days of diethystilbestrol exposure, GCs were collected from the ovaries and cultured in serum-free McCoy's 5a medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and antibiotics at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. All animal protocols were approved by the University of California at San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. GCs (1 × 106 viable cells) were seeded in a 24-well plate. After a 5-h preculture, BMP-6, -7, or -15 or activin-A was added to the culture medium. COV434 cells (generously provided by Dr. Peter I. Schrier) were seeded in a 24-well plate and were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Once the cells became 80% confluent, the medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After a 3-h preculture in serum-free medium, BMP-6, -7, or -15 or activin-A was added to the culture medium. Following culture for the indicated periods of time, both GCs and COV434 cells were solubilized in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) containing Protease-Arrest (Geno Technology, Inc., St. Louis, MO), 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 2% SDS, and 4% β-mercaptoethanol. Lysates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting analysis using two previously validated rabbit antisera, anti-phospho-Smad1 (PS-1) and anti-phospho-Smad2 (PS-2), that were generously provided by Dr. Carl-Henrik Heldin. PS-1 cross-reacts specifically with phospho-Smad1, -5, and -8 (the BMP-responsive Smads), and PS-2, which is specific for phospho-Smad2, does not cross-react with phospho-Smad3 (37Faure S. Lee M.A. Keller T. ten Dijke P. Whitman M. Development. 2000; 127: 2917-2931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to confirm that there were no differences in the levels of total protein between groups, antisera that detect total ERK1/2 were used for SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting analysis as described previously (30Moore R.K. Otsuka F. Shimasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (data not shown). COV434 cells were seeded in a 24-well dish and cultured in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. When the cells became 60–70% confluent, they were co-transfected with 500 ng of pXVent2-Luc (kindly provided by Dr. Joan Massagué) and 50 ng of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase plasmid (pCMV-β-gal) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Basel, Switzerland). 12 h after transfection, the culture media were replaced with 1% fetal bovine serum medium, and BMP-15 was added to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. After culture for 24 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed with 60 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Luciferase activity in 20 μl of the cell lysate was measured with a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) using Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). β-Galactosidase activity in 10 μl of the lysate was measured using the Galacto-Light Plus System (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA) and used to normalize transfection efficiencies. The data are shown as the ratio of luciferase to β-galactosidase activity and expressed as the -fold change as compared with non-BMP-15-treated (control) cells. BMP-15 (100 ng/ml) was mixed with the indicated receptor-ECD/Fc chimera proteins (2 μg/ml) in PBS to a total volume of 250 μl and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies conjugated to agarose beads (anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel; 10 μl) in 300 μl of PBS were added, and the incubation was continued for another 2 h at 4 °C. Following incubation, the agarose beads were centrifuged and washed five times with 1 ml of PBS. Proteins bound to the agarose beads were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE fractionation and immunoblotting analysis using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antiserum to detect the receptor/Fc chimera proteins. GCs (105 viable cells) were cultured in a 96-well plate with 200 μl of serum-free medium containing one or a combination of FSH, BMP-15, various receptor-ECD/Fc chimeras, and U0126. After a 48-h culture, the culture media were collected and stored at −20 °C until assay. The levels of progesterone in the medium were measured by standard radioimmunoassay procedures (4Otsuka F.

GCs (2 × 105 viable cells) were cultured in 1.5-ml polypropylene tubes containing 200 μl (final volume) of serum-free culture medium. After a 24-h preculture period, cells were incubated with 0.5 μCi/tube of [methyl-3H]thymidine either alone or with a combination of BMP-15 and individual TGF-β superfamily receptor/Fc chimera or U0126. After another 24 h of culture, the GCs were washed with PBS, centrifuged (2000 ×g, 30 min), and incubated with 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was solubilized in 0.2m NaOH, and its radioactivity was measured (4Otsuka F. Yao Z. Lee T.H. Yamamoto S. Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol.

All results shown are mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments with triplicate determinations for each treatment. Differences between groups were analyzed for statistical significance using analysis of variance (SPSS Standard version 10.0.1, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). p values of <0.05 were accepted as statistically significant. We have previously demonstrated that recombinant BMP-15 exhibits specific biological activities in rat primary GCs (4Otsuka F. Yao Z. Lee T.H. Yamamoto S. Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol.

To investigate the signaling pathways of BMP-15, we first subjected lysates of rat primary GCs that were exposed to BMP-15, BMP-6, BMP-7, or activin-A to SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting analysis using PS-1 antiserum, which has been validated to specifically detect phospho-Smad1/5/8. Following a 1-h exposure of GCs to BMP-15 (100 ng/ml), there was a pronounced increase in phospho-Smad1/5/8, which was also observed in the lysates of GCs treated with 100 ng/ml BMP-6 and BMP-7 (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, lysates from untreated (control) GCs and GCs treated with 100 ng/ml activin-A did not display any significant amount of phospho-Smad1/5/8. A similar stimulation of the Smad1/5/8 pathway by BMP-15, BMP-6, and BMP-7, but not by activin-A, was observed in a human GC cell line, COV434 (Fig. 1 B). The same phospho-Smad1/5/8 response to these growth factors was also observed in CHO-K1 cells (data not shown), indicating that BMP-15 stimulation of this pathway is not restricted to GCs. To further characterize the BMP-15 response in COV434 cells, we analyzed the time course of the presence of phospho-Smad1/5/8 following BMP-15 administration. The presence of phospho-Smad1/5/8 was evident as early as 15 min after BMP-15 administration, increased at 30 min, and peaked at 1 h, and by 4 h it was barely detectable (Fig. 2).Figure 2Time course of PS-1 activation by BMP-15 in COV434 cells. Following treatment with BMP-15 (100 ng/ml) for the indicated incubation periods, cells were lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using PS-1 antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The lysates from primary rat GCs and COV434 cells exposed to BMP-15, BMP-6, BMP-7, or activin-A were also subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using the PS-2 antiserum, which is specific for phosphorylated Smad2. In the lysates of rat primary GCs treated with activin-A, a very weak PS-2 signal was detectable, whereas the PS-2 signals in cells treated with BMP-15, BMP-6, and BMP-7 were indistinguishable from that of untreated controls (data not shown). However, in the lysates from COV434 cells that were exposed to activin-A, there was a pronounced increase in phospho-Smad2, whereas treatment with BMP-15, -6, and -7 had little effect on levels of phospho-Smad2 (Fig. 3). To further demonstrate the functional activation of the Smad1/5/8 pathway by BMP-15, COV434 cells were transiently transfected with a transcriptional reporter construct, pXVent2-Luc, which has been shown to specifically respond to BMP signaling in P19 cells, C3H10T1/2 cells, and Xenopus embryos (38Candia A.F.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 946-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Treatment with BMP-15 at 100 ng/ml caused a 3.3-fold increase in XVent2-luciferase activity as compared with untreated controls (Fig. 4). Of the TGF-β superfamily receptors identified to date, BMPR-II, ActR-II, ALK-3, ALK-6, and ALK-2 have been implicated in the activation of the Smad1/5/8 pathway (14Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar); thus, we hypothesized that one or more of these receptors may be involved in BMP-15 activation of the Smad1/5/8 pathway. To characterize biochemical binding ability, we used receptor-ECD/Fc chimera proteins for co-immunoprecipitation studies with BMP-15. Using a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to agarose beads, we analyzed the ability of BMP-15 to bind each receptor-ECD. SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis of the receptor-ECD chimera before immunoprecipitation showed that there was a similar amount of immunoreactive ECD in each group and that the individual receptor-ECDs had unique SDS-PAGE migration patterns (Fig. 5 A). The BMPR-II-ECD migrates at 65–75 kDa, ActR-II-ECD migrates at 50–60 kDa, ALK-3-ECD migrates at 55–65 kDa, and ALK-6-ECD and ALK-2-ECD migrate at 50–55 kDa. Co-immunoprecipitation studies with BMP-15 revealed that, of the five candidate receptor-ECD chimeras, ALK-6 co-immunoprecipitation was clearly higher than the other candidates (Fig. 5 B). The relative ability of each receptor-ECD to co-immunoprecipitate with BMP-15 was found to be approximately as follows: ALK-6-ECD ≫ ALK-2-ECD = ActR-II-ECD > BMPR-II-ECD ≫ ALK-3-ECD. In order to ensure that the co-immunoprecipitation was due to the binding of the receptor-ECDs to BMP-15, and not directly to the anti-FLAG-agarose, the receptor-ECDs were immunoprecipitated in the absence of BMP-15. In these studies, there was no detectable immunoprecipitated receptor-ECDs, indicating that the observed co-immunoprecipitation was due to the specific binding of the receptor-ECDs to BMP-15. We next used the receptor-ECD/Fc chimera to determine whether these proteins can inhibit the biological effects of BMP-15 in rat primary GCs. To this end, we first evaluated the effects of BMP-15 on FSH-induced progesterone production in the presence and absence of the receptor-ECD/Fc chimera (Fig. 6). The addition of BMP-15 (30 ng/ml) caused a 38% drop in FSH-induced progesterone production compared with FSH alone. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of BMP-15 on FSH-induced progesterone synthesis was almost completely abolished by BMPR-II-ECD. ActR-II-ECD and ALK-6-ECD also reversed the effects of BMP-15; however, their effects were not as pronounced as BMPR-II-ECD. ALK-3-ECD had no effect on BMP-15 suppression of FSH-induced progesterone production. In addition, although not shown, ALK-2-ECD alone (in the absence of BMP-15) suppressed FSH-induced progesterone synthesis by 46% and had no observable effect on BMP-15 action; therefore, it was not possible to determine the effects of this receptor-ECD on BMP-15 steroidogenic properties.

Breast and ovarian carcinoma cells lacking BRCA1 show evidence of defects in Xi chromatin structure. Reconstitution of BRCA1-deficient cells with wt BRCA1 led to the appearance of focal XIST RNA staining without altering XIST abundance. Inhibiting BRCA1 synthesis in a suitable reporter line led to increased expression of an otherwise silenced Xi-located GFP transgene. These observations suggest that loss of BRCA1 in female cells may lead to Xi perturbation and destabilization of its silenced state."

Indeed, Ski disrupts the formation of a functional complex between the Co- and R-Smads, explaining how it could lead to repression of TGF-β, activin, and BMP responses. Intriguingly, the structure of the Ski fragment, stabilized by a bound zinc atom, resembles the SAND domain, in which the corresponding I loop is responsible for DNA binding."

Compared with extensive studies on peptide-bacteria interactions, little is known about peptide-human cell interactions. Using human cervical carcinoma HeLa and fibroblastic TM12 cells, we investigated the cellular uptake of fluorescent analogues of the two representative antimicrobial peptides magainin 2 and buforin 2 in comparison with the representative Arg-rich cell-penetrating Tat-(47–57) peptide (YGRKKRRQRRR). The dose, time, temperature, and energy dependence of translocation suggested that the three peptides cross cell membranes through different mechanisms. The magainin peptide was internalized within a time scale of tens of minutes. The cooperative concentration dependence of uptake suggested that the peptide forms a pore as an intermediate similar to the observations in model membranes. Furthermore, the translocation was coupled with cytotoxicity, which was larger for tumor HeLa cells. In contrast, the buforin peptide translocated within 10 min by a temperature-independent, less concentration-dependent passive mechanism without showing any significant cytotoxicity at the highest concentration investigated (100 μm). The uptake of the Tat peptide was proportional to the peptide concentration, and the concentration dependence was lost upon ATP depletion. The peptide exhibited a moderate cytotoxicity at higher concentrations. The time course did not show saturation even after 120 min. The buforin peptide, covalently attached to the 28-kDa green fluorescent protein, also entered cells, suggesting a potency of the peptide as a vector for macromolecular delivery into cells. However, the mechanism appeared to be different from that of the parent peptide. Cationic antimicrobial peptides play important roles in innate immunity.

Broad antimicrobial spectra, highly selective toxicity, as well as difficult resistance development make these compounds promising candidates as novel antibiotics for clinical use. Intensive investigations on peptide-bacteria interactions have shown that some peptides kill bacteria mainly by permeabilizing the membranes, whereas others target intracellular compounds, such as nucleic acids, although recent studies have suggested that many peptides possess both modes of action (2Tossi A. Sandri L. Giangaspero A. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 4-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 4Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6798) Google Scholar, 5Hancock R.E.W.

Magainin 2 (Table I) isolated from the skin of the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis is a representative membrane-acting peptide composed of 23 amino acid residues (6Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Addition of the peptide to bacterial cells immediately induces the permeabilization of both outer and inner membranes, leading to cell death (9Matsuzaki K. Sugishita K. Harada M. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1327: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 10Park C.B. Kim H.S. Kim S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Kim S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), although native magainin 2 was recently reported to enter cells (11Haukland H.H. Ulvante H. Sandvik K. Vorland L.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). An example of the peptides targeting intracellular substances is buforin 2, which was discovered in the stomach of the Asian toad Bufo bufo gargarizans (12Park C.B. Kim M.S. Kim S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). A fluorescent buforin 2 rapidly enters bacterial cells without perturbing the barrier properties of the membranes, binding to DNA and RNA (10Park C.B. Kim H.S. Kim S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In contrast, short Arg-rich cationic peptides have recently been shown to enter mammalian cells by an energy (ATP)-independent, non-endocytotic pathway and have been utilized as vectors for delivering membrane-impermeable drugs, oligonucleotides, and proteins into cells (23Lindgren M. Hällbrink M. Prochiantz A. Langel Ü. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Model membrane studies revealed that the membrane-acting magainin peptide also translocates across lipid bilayers (24Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 25Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12553-12559Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), although less effectively than buforin 2 (18Kobayashi S. Takeshima K. Park C.B. Kim S.C. Matsuzaki K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8648-8654Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore, cationic antimicrobial peptides, including those of the membrane-permeabilizing class, can penetrate human cells. However, although this issue has rarely been investigated, it is important for the development of novel peptides for therapeutic use as well as for understanding the roles of antimicrobial peptides in innate immunity. In this study, we investigated the translocation of fluorescent-labeled analogues of magainin 2 and buforin 2 across human cell membranes in comparison with the Tat-(47–57) peptide (Table I), a representative Arg-rich cell-penetrating peptide. Both tumor (human cervical carcinoma HeLa) and normal (human fibroblastic TM12, Ref. 26Iwahana H. Yanagisawa K. Ito-Kosaka A. Kuroiwa K. Tango K. Komatsu N. Katashima R. Itakura M. Tominaga S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) cells were used because magainin peptides are known to exhibit selective toxicity for tumor cells (19Cruciani R.A.

Jacob L.S. Herlyn M. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The dose, time, temperature, and energy dependence of translocation suggested that the three peptides crossed cell membranes through different mechanisms. Furthermore, the buforin peptide, covalently attached to the 28-kDa green fluorescent protein also entered cells, suggesting a potency of the peptide as a vector for macromolecular delivery into cells. The reagents for peptide synthesis were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). All fluorescent probes for peptide labeling were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was supplied by nacalai tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3)1 linker and MTT were purchased from Pierce and Sigma, respectively. GFP was supplied by Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). All other chemicals from Wako (Tokyo, Japan) were of special grade. The peptide was synthesized by a standard fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-based solid phase method on an Applied Biosystems Model 433A peptide synthesizer, as previously described (28Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Tokuda H. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3342-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Fluorescent labeling of the peptides was performed as follows. After cleavage from the resin, the Cys residue of the magainin peptide or the buforin analogue dissolved in 5 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was conjugated with thiol-reactive Texas Red(R) C2 maleimide in acetonitrile/methanol (1:1, v/v). The N terminus of the Tat peptide on the resin was labeled with Texas Red(R)-X succinimidyl ester inN,N-dimethylformamide and isopropylethylamine, washed with N,N-dimethylformamide and acetonitrile, and then cleaved from the resin. The purity of the synthesized peptides was determined by analytical reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and ion spray mass spectroscopy. HeLa and TM12 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were maintained under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells (1 × 104/cm2) were plated on 24-well microplates (2 cm2/well), and then incubated overnight. After removal of the medium, the cells were exposed to peptide solutions (200 μl) freshly dissolved in DMEM with 10% FBS for various periods at 37 °C, unless otherwise indicated. The peptide solutions were then aspirated, and the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) of pH 7.4 and lysed with 0.5 ml of 10% SDS in PBS. The protein content of the cells was determined by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Hercules, CA). The internalized Texas Red-labeled peptides were fluorometrically quantified with a Shimadzu RF-5300 spectrofluorometer at an excitation wavelength of 583 nm and an emission wavelength of 610 nm. The assays were performed as described above with the exception that the cells were preincubated for 30 min either at 4 °C or in the presence of 0.5% (w/v) sodium azide in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37 °C. The subsequently added peptide solution was cooled at 4 °C or contained 0.5% (w/v) sodium azide. The cells (1 × 104/cm2) were plated on 8-well chamber slides (1 cm2/well), incubated overnight, and then treated with peptide solutions as described above. For nuclear staining, 5 μm SYTO16 (Molecular Probes) was added to the peptide solutions. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, washed again with PBS, and mounted in a glycerol/PBS (9:1, v/v) solution containing 0.1% p-phenylendiamine dihydrochloride. Microscopic examination was performed on a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal laser microscope. The cells (5 × 103cells/well) were cultured in 96-well microplates and incubated overnight in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After removal of the medium, the cells were incubated with 0.1 ml of peptide dissolved in the medium for 24 h at 37 °C. Ten microliters of a 5 mg/ml MTT solution in PBS was then added, and the cells were further incubated for 5 h. Thereafter, the precipitated MTT was dissolved overnight in 0.1 ml of 20% (w/v) SDS in 0.01 m HCl. The percent cell viability was determined by 100 × (OD595 − OD655) for peptide-treated cells/(OD595 − OD655) for untreated cells. OD595 and OD655 denote absorbances at 595 and 655 nm. The N terminus of the buforin peptide dissolved in sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.3) was labeled with Rhodamine Red-X succinimidyl ester in dimethylsulfoxide. Minor byproducts were removed by RP-HPLC. The labeled peptide (65 μm) and GFP (24 μm) were mixed in PBS (pH 7.4). 30-fold excess over the protein of the amino group-reactive linker BS3 freshly dissolved in sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.0) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml was added to the mixed solution. After 30 min, the reaction was stopped with excess 1 mTris. The aggregates were precipitated by centrifugation, and then the unreacted reagents in the supernatant were removed from the buforin-GFP conjugate by Millipore Micron centrifugal filter devices (Bedford, MA). The average number of attached buforin peptide molecules per GFP was 1.77, as estimated by UV-visible absorption. The magainin 2 derivative (MG2d, TableI) was designed as follows. The translocation occurs upon the disintegration of a pore (24Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The translocation efficiency is known to be enhanced by increasing the peptide's positive charge, which destabilizes the intermediate pore (29Matsuzaki K. Nakamura A. Murase O. Sugishita K. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2104-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Glu19 residue of magainin 2 was replaced with Gln, and the C terminus was amidated. This modification increased the charge by +2. Texas Red, which is brighter and has a lower background than other commonly used red fluorescent dyes and is suited to laser excitation, was linked to the Cys residue introduced at the 23rd position. The F12W substitution was for easy quantitation of the unlabeled peptide by optical density at 280 nm. The Trp introduction to the buforin 2 analogue BF2d was for the same reason. The C-terminal extension GGC was added to link various molecules via the SH group in future studies. In this study, Texas Red was covalently attached to the peptide for laser microscopy. The Tat-(47–57) peptide includes the sequence responsible for the cellular uptake of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat protein consisting of the polycationic region 49–57 (30Wender P.A. Mitchell D.J. Pattabiraman K. Pelkey E.T. Steinman L. Rothbard J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13003-13008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). The N terminus of the peptide was also labeled with this dye. The labeling position had no effect on peptide-cell interactions: We also synthesized a BF2d analogue with the dye at the N terminus. The concentration and time dependence of peptide uptake were almost identical to those of BF2d (data not shown). The fluorescent peptides (5 μm) were incubated with HeLa or TM12 cells for 30 min at 37 or 4 °C, and the intracellular distributions of the peptides were examined by confocal laser microscopy. At 37 °C, MG2d translocated across the cell membranes of both cells (Fig. 1, A and D) and was almost uniformly distributed inside the cells except for the nuclei in which the peptide was less concentrated. This could be more clearly seen by co-labeling with the nuclear-staining dye SYTO16 (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were also obtained at 4 °C (Fig. 1 C). In contrast to the magainin analogue, the intranuclear concentrations of BF2d (Fig. 1 E) and Tat-(47–57) (Fig. 1 H) were similar to those in the cytosol. The co-labeling with SYTO16 clearly indicated that BF2d had entered the nuclei (Fig. 1 F). The uptake of these peptides was also not significantly temperature-dependent (Fig. 1, G andI). The treatment of MG2d roughened the cell surfaces compared with the other two peptides. To prove that most peptide molecules were not surface-bound but internalized, we performed the optical sectioning of HeLa cells treated with MG2d as in Fig. 1 A. The focus plane was changed from bottom to top in the vertical axis range of 32.8 μm at an interval of 1.64 μm. Representative photographs are shown in Fig. 2. Texas Red fluorescence was only observed in the central region of the cell. In addition to fluorescence microscopy, quantitative data on the cellular uptake of the peptides are useful for the elucidation of translocation mechanisms. Fluorescent flow cytometry has often been utilized for this purpose (30Wender P.A. Mitchell D.J. Pattabiraman K. Pelkey E.T. Steinman L. Rothbard J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13003-13008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). An alternative, more quantitative method was used in this study. The amount of peptide taken up was fluorometrically determined after cell solubilization. At the same time, the amount of cellular proteins was quantitated as a measure of the number of cells. The amount of peptide uptake per mg of cellular protein during a 30-min incubation at 37 °C is plotted as a function of peptide concentration for HeLa and TM12 cells in Fig. 3, A andB, respectively. Although these values include the amount of peptide bound to the cell surface, it is clear from Figs. 1 and 2 that most peptide molecules were internalized. The uptake of MG2d into both cells was apparently cooperative with respect to peptide concentration (Fig. 3, circles). The double logarithmic plots gave slopes of 1.6 (r = 0.982) and 1.4 (r = 0.995) for HeLa and TM12 cells, respectively (plots not shown). In contrast, the uptake of BF2d was much less concentration-dependent (Fig. 3, squares). The Tat-(47–57) peptide was incorporated into the cells almost linearly to the peptide concentration of at least 15 μm(Fig. 3, triangles). Endocytotic processes are known to be inhibited at lower temperatures or by ATP depletion (31Schmid S.L. Carter L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2307-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 32Sai Y. Kajita M. Tamai I. Wakama J. Wakamiya T. Tsuji A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G514-G520PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Open barsin Fig. 4 A show the peptide uptake by HeLa cells at 4 °C relative to that at 37 °C (control). The uptake of MG2d was reduced by 40% whereas those of BF2d and Tat-(47–57) were insensitive to temperature.Shaded bars in Fig. 4 A show the effects of sodium azide, which blocks ATP synthesis by inhibiting cytochrome oxidase, on peptide uptake. The internalization of MG2d was slightly (∼20%) reduced by the metabolic inhibitor while that of BF2d was not affected by the treatment. In contrast, the azide treatment largely abolished the concentration dependence of Tat uptake (Fig. 4 B). Such a phenomenon was not observed for BF2d (data not shown). Fig. 5, A and B show the time dependence of peptide uptake by HeLa and TM12 cells, respectively. For MG2d (circles), the uptake kinetics was biphasic. A 5-min incubation was sufficient for the half-maximal uptake. A longer incubation gradually increased uptake, which was saturated at 60–120 min. The time course of BF2d internalization was completely different (squares). The uptake was rapid and reached the maximum at 10 min, and then gradually decreased. In contrast to these antimicrobial peptides, the Tat-(47–57) peptide was continuously taken up at least up to 120 min (triangles). The cytotoxicities of the peptides without Texas Red labeling were evaluated by the standard MTT assay, which demonstrates active energization of cells and is conventionally used as a measure of cell viability. The percent viability is plotted as a function of the peptide concentration in Fig. 6. In the presence of MG2d, the cell viability was abruptly decreased beyond 10 and 20 μm for HeLa (open circles) and TM12 cells (closed circles), respectively. In contrast, BF2d was practically non-toxic at least up to 100 μm for both cells (squares). Upon Tat-(47–57) treatment (triangles), the cell viability was decreased as a function of peptide concentration over the range of 0.1 to 100%. The absence of any significant cytotoxicity suggests that the buforin peptide is a promising candidate as a vector for delivering macromolecules into cells. To examine this possibility, BF2d was conjugated with GFP (28 kDa) by use of the bifunctional cross-linker BS3. Fig. 7 A shows that GFP alone did not enter HeLa cells. In contrast, the conjugate was internalized into the cells, as confirmed by both GFP (protein part) and Texas Red (peptide part) fluorescence (Fig. 7 B). The conjugate was uniformly distributed within the cells and reached the nuclei, similarly to the vector peptide (Fig. 1 E). The uptake efficiency was, however, lower than that of BF2d alone (Fig. 7 D) and diminished at low temperature (Fig. 7 E) or in the presence of sodium azide (Fig. 7 F). Interactions of magainins with lipid bilayers are well characterized (for review, see Refs. 7Matsuzaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar and 8Matsuzaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The peptides preferentially bind to negatively charged phospholipids, forming amphipathic helices (28Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Tokuda H. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3342-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Their affinities for mammalian cells, on the surface of which anionic phospholipids are not exposed, have been considered to be low, although weak hydrophobic interaction drives peptide binding (34Matsuzaki K. Sugishita K. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3423-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The amounts of MG2d taken up by both cells were larger than those of BF2d and Tat-(47–57) (Fig. 3), despite having the smallest positive charge. The hydrophobicity of MG2d, which has several hydrophobic residues (2Ile, 2Phe, Trp, Leu, Val), was the largest among the three peptides (Table I). After membrane binding, several magainin helices form a toroidal pore (diameter 2–3 nm) with surrounding lipid molecules in artificial membranes (35Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11361-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Upon pore disintegration, a fraction of the peptide molecules translocates across the membrane (24Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This is reflected by a cooperativity in peptide binding, membrane permeabilization (28Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Tokuda H. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3342-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and cytotoxicity (22Haimovich B. Tanaka J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1240: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cooperativities observed in cellular uptake of MG2d (Fig. 3) and cytotoxicity (Fig. 6) suggest that the magainin derivative also forms a pore in cell membranes and that pore formation and subsequent cell entry are closely related to cell death. One possibility is that membrane permeabilization leads to cell death by dissipating membrane potential and leakage of intracellular molecules. Another possibility is that the peptide damages mitochondria (36Westerhoff H.V. Hendler R.W. Zasloff M. Jureti′c D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), resulting in apoptosis. The surface-roughening effect of MG2d (Fig. 1) also suggests membrane activity of this peptide. In studies using large unilamellar vesicles of 100 nm in diameter, the pore formation-translocation process is biphasic and reaches pseudo-equilibrium within ∼10 min (24Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In cells that are much larger and have various organelles and macromolecules that the magainin peptide can interact with, the internalization takes much longer, consistent with the kinetic uptake data (Fig. 5). The uptake of MG2d was partially inhibited at low temperature (Fig. 4 A). This observation also supports translocation via the transient formation of a toroidal pore. At low temperature, where membranes are less fluid, the formation of the peptide-lipid supramolecular complex pore that requires membrane bending will be suppressed. The entry of a synthetic cationic amphipathic helix composed of 18 amino acid residues was also partially inhibited at low temperature (37Oehlke J. Scheller A. Wiesner B. Krause E. Beyermann M. Klauschenz E. Melzig M. Bienert M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1414: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), although this observation was attributed to the presence of multiple cell permeation mechanisms. Sai et al.(32Sai Y. Kajita M. Tamai I. Wakama J. Wakamiya T. Tsuji A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G514-G520PubMed Google Scholar) reported that adsorptive-mediated endocytosis of a small basic peptide was partially inhibited at low temperature (32Sai Y. Kajita M. Tamai I. Wakama J. Wakamiya T. Tsuji A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G514-G520PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this mechanism, the peptide uptake was saturated at higher peptide concentrations. The opposite effect was observed for MG2d (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the peptide internalized by adsorptive-mediated endocytosis showed granular distribution and was completely excluded from the nuclei. Neither was observed for MG2d (Figs. 1 and 2). Our cytotoxicity data (Fig. 6) show that MG2d preferentially kills transformed HeLa cells over non-tumor TM12 cells, consistent with previous studies (19Cruciani R.A. Barker J.L. Zasloff M.

Jacob L.S. Herlyn M. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Buforin 2 effectively crosses bacterial cell membranes (10Park C.B. Kim H.S. Kim S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), although the mechanism has not yet been elucidated. The observation that peptides also translocate across model lipid bilayers without perturbing lipid organization (18Kobayashi S. Takeshima K. Park C.B. Kim S.C. Matsuzaki K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8648-8654Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) indicates that the membrane permeation occurs by a passive mechanism. Indeed, the cell entry of BF2d was neither affected by low temperature nor the metabolic inhibitor (Fig. 4). The amount of peptide entered the cells was reduced after 10 min, suggesting the presence of an efflux mechanism (Fig. 5). Similar behaviors have been reported for a rhodamine-labeled Tat-(48–60) peptide (38Suzuki T. Futaki S. Niwa M. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2437-2443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and a 99mTc-chelated Tat peptide (39Polyakov V. Sharma V. Dahlheimer J.L. Pica C.M. Luker G.D. Piwnica-Worms D. Bioconjugate Chem. 2000; 11: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The buforin derivative effectively reached the nuclei (Fig. 1 F), in keeping with a higher affinity of buforin 2 with RNA and DNA compared with magainin 2 (10Park C.B. Kim H.S. Kim S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Buforin 2 has been considered to kill bacteria by binding to nucleic acids, therefore inhibiting protein synthesis (10Park C.B. Kim H.S. Kim S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). However, BF2d did not show any significant toxicities against both HeLa and TM12 cells at least up to 100 μm(Fig. 6), probably because the amounts of the internalized peptide were the lowest among the peptides investigated (Fig. 3) and because of the presence of an efflux mechanism (Fig. 5). The absence of cytotoxicity suggests that BF2d is a promising candidate as a vector for intracellular delivery of membrane-impermeable cargo molecules. A number of Arg-rich peptides have been developed for this purpose (for review, see Ref. 23Lindgren M. Hällbrink M. Prochiantz A. Langel Ü. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Our BF2d-GFP conjugate could enter cells, although the efficiency was much lower than that of the vector peptide BF2d (Fig. 7). The observations that the cellular uptake of the conjugate was diminished at low temperature or in the presence of sodium azide suggest that the conjugate and the vector permeate the cell membranes by different mechanisms. Various short Tat peptides have been reported to permeate the cell membranes without perturbing membrane integrity and to reach the nuclei (30Wender P.A. Mitchell D.J. Pattabiraman K. Pelkey E.T.

These peptides including other Arg-rich peptides were suggested to share common non-endocytotic internalization pathway(s) (38Suzuki T. Futaki S. Niwa M. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2437-2443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). However, the effects of temperature and metabolic inhibitors and the time and concentration dependence of cellular uptake appear to depend on the peptide sequences and cell lines. Low temperature did not affect the uptake of Tat-(48–60) (40Vivés E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar) or Tat-(47–57) (Fig. 4) by HeLa cells. In contrast, the kinetics of99mTc-chelated Tat peptide internalization into Jurkat cells was largely changed by a lowering of the temperature (39Polyakov V. Sharma V. Dahlheimer J.L. Pica C.M. Luker G.D. Piwnica-Worms D. Bioconjugate Chem. 2000; 11: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The uptake of Tat-(48–60) (38Suzuki T. Futaki S. Niwa M. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2437-2443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and 99mTc-chelated Tat (39Polyakov V. Sharma V. Dahlheimer J.L. Pica C.M. Luker G.D. Piwnica-Worms D. Bioconjugate Chem. 2000; 11: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) by HeLa and Jurkat cells reached a maximum at 60–90 min and 5 min, respectively, whereas that of Tat-(47–57) by HeLa cells continued to increase at least up to 120 min (Fig. 5 A). Our Tat-(47–57) peptide was internalized proportionally to a peptide concentration of up to 15 μm (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, the uptake of Tat-(48–60) was saturated even below 10 μm (38Suzuki T. Futaki S. Niwa M. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2437-2443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Sodium azide was reported to have no effect on the uptake of Tat-(48–60) (38Suzuki T. Futaki S. Niwa M. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2437-2443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). However, in our case, the concentration dependence of uptake was completely lost by this treatment (Fig. 4 B), suggesting some involvement of energy-dependent processes. At lower peptide concentrations, the presence of sodium azide induced a slight enhancement in uptake. The reason for this is not clear at present. ATP depletion can cause various changes in cell membranes, including the inhibition of endocytosis-mediated recycling of cell surface molecules (33Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar), the blockage of transbilayer movement of phospholipids (41Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Dekkers D.W. Zwaal R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and the dissipation of transmembrane potential (42Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell 3rd Ed. Garland Publishing, New York1995Google Scholar). The partial reduction (20%) of MG2d uptake by the metabolic inhibitor (Fig. 4 A) may be related to these alterations in the cell surface. Alternatively, several translocation pathways including those that are energy-dependent may be present, as suggested for a synthetic cationic amphipathic helix (37Oehlke J. Scheller A. Wiesner B. Krause E. Beyermann M. Klauschenz E. Melzig M. Bienert M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1414: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). We investigated the cellular uptake of the analogues of the two representative antimicrobial peptides, membrane-acting magainin 2 and nuclear targeting buforin 2, in comparison with the Tat-(47–57) peptide. Together with previous reports on various cell-penetrating peptides, our data show the existence of at least three mechanisms for cell entry. 1) The magainin-class peptide crosses the cell membranes by the transient pore formation-translocation mechanism that can be reproduced in artificial lipid bilayer systems (7Matsuzaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 8Matsuzaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The process is moderately temperature-sensitive. 2) The buforin class peptide translocates into the cells without perturbing the cell membranes by an unknown mechanism. The translocation phenomenon is also observable in artificial systems (18Kobayashi S. Takeshima K. Park C.B. Kim S.C. Matsuzaki K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8648-8654Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The process is not influenced by temperature or a metabolic inhibitor, and the cytotoxicity is minimal. 3) The Tat-class peptide enters the cells by an unknown mechanism that many Arg-rich peptides may share (38Suzuki T. Futaki S. Niwa M. Tanaka S. Ueda K. Sugiura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2437-2443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The temperature and energy dependence vary among the peptide sequences and the cell lines used. The peptides show moderate cytotoxicities at higher concentrations (40Vivés E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). The membrane permeation cannot be reproduced in liposomal systems. 2K. Matsuzaki and A. Chikushi, unpublished work. It is not clear whether the Antennapedia peptides (penetratins) (43Derossi D. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 84-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) belong to this category or not because conflicting results were reported on the translocation across lipid bilayers (44Thorén P.E.G. Persson D. Karlsson M. Nordén B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 45Drin G. Déméné H. Temsamani J. Brasseur R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1824-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the attachment of a cargo molecule may change the translocation mechanism, as observed for BF2d-GFP."
https://openalex.org/W2164310798,"SR proteins constitute a family of pre-mRNA splicing factors that play important roles in both constitutive and regulated splicing. Here, we describe one member of the family, which we call SRp38, with unexpected properties. Unlike other SR proteins, SRp38 cannot activate splicing and is essentially inactive in splicing assays. However, dephosphorylation converts SRp38 to a potent, general repressor that inhibits splicing at an early step. To investigate the cellular function of SRp38, we examined its possible role in cell cycle control. We show first that splicing, like other steps in gene expression, is inhibited in extracts of mitotic cells. Strikingly, SRp38 was found to be dephosphorylated specifically in mitotic cells, and we show that dephosphorylated SRp38 is required for the observed splicing repression."

We have explored the structure-function relationship of the CXCR3 ligands, in particular of I-TAC, which has highest affinity for CXCR3 and is the most potent agonist. A potent antagonist for CXCR3 was obtained by NH2-terminal truncation of I-TAC. I-TAC (4–73), which lacks the first three residues, has no agonistic activity but competes for the binding of I-TAC to CXCR3-bearing cells and inhibits migration and Ca2+ changes in such cells in response to stimulation with I-TAC, IP10, and Mig. It does also not induce internalization of CXCR3, which is in support of the lack of agonistic effects. Hybrid chemokines between I-TAC and IP10 were used to identify regions responsible for the higher activity of I-TAC. I-TAC-like IP10 analogs are obtained by substituting the NH2 terminus (residues 1–8) or N-loop region (residues 12–17) of IP10 with those of I-TAC, suggesting that the differences in function of the CXCR3 ligands can be assigned to distinct regions and that these regions are interchangeable. Structure-activity studies with Mig showed that the extended basic COOH-terminal region, which is not present in I-TAC and IP10, is important for binding and activity.

They are divided into CXC, CC, C, and CX3C families and mediate their functions through binding to seven-transmembrane-domain receptors coupled to G proteins (5Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F.

The migration pattern and effector function of leukocytes are closely linked and largely defined by the expression of the chemokine receptors. The receptors often recognize more than one chemokine and, alternatively, several chemokines can bind to multiple receptors. The CXC chemokine receptors are generally ligand-specific. For instance, CXCR31 binds interferon-inducible T cell-α chemoattractant (I-TAC, CXCL11), interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP10, CXCL10), and monokine-induced by γ-interferon (Mig, CXCL9); CXCR4 binds stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1, CXCL12), CXCR5 binds B cell activation chemokine-1 (CXCL13); and CXCR6 binds CXCL16 (5Murphy P.M.

They mainly attract activated T lymphocytes, preferentially of the Th1 phenotype, which expresses high levels of CXCR3 (10Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I.

The involvement in Th1 responses is also supported by the observation that the production of all three ligands by blood and tissue cells is induced by interferon-γ, the typical Th1 cytokine (7Cole K.E.

Recently, it has also been shown that IP10 and CXCR3 are critically involved in the development of acute allograft rejection. Cardiac allograft survival was markedly prolonged by targeting either donor-derived IP10 production or CXCR3 expression on host leukocytes as shown in studies with IP10- or CXCR3-deficient mice and with animals treated with antibodies that neutralize IP10 or CXCR3 (23Hancock W.W., Lu, B.

In these various diseases, the expression of the CXCR3 ligands, in particular of IP10, correlates with the tissue infiltration of T lymphocytes, suggesting that these ligands play an important role in the regulation of cell recruitment to sites of inflammation. CXCR3 is expressed on a fraction of circulating blood T cells, B cells, and NK cells (18Qin S. Rottman J.B. Myers P. Kassam N. Weinblatt M. Loetscher M. Koch A.E. Moser B. Mackay C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Blood T cells positive for CXCR3 are mostly CD45RO+ memory cells, which express high levels of β1 integrins (18Qin S.

Th1 cell lines generated in vitroexpress higher levels of CXCR3 and migrate better to I-TAC, IP10, and Mig than Th2 cell lines (12Sallusto F. Lenig D. Mackay C.R. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp.

We have recently shown that I-TAC, IP10, and Mig, besides being agonists for CXCR3, act as natural antagonists for CCR3, the receptor for eotaxin, and several other CC chemokines (35Loetscher P. Pellegrino A. Gong J.H. Mattioli I. Loetscher M. Bardi G. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2986-2991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). They compete for the binding of eotaxin to CCR3 and inhibit CCR3-mediated migration and Ca2+ changes. Because CXCR3 and CCR3 are differentially expressed in Th1 and Th2 cells, the findings suggest that I-TAC, IP10, and Mig, in addition to attracting CXCR3-bearing cells, have the capacity to block migration of CCR3-bearing cells, thereby enhancing the polarization of T cell recruitment. As recently shown by NMR spectroscopy, the hydrophobic cleft, which is formed by the N-loop and 40s-loop region, may provide the basis for the ability of IP10 to bind to both CXCR3 and CCR3 (36Booth V. Keizer D.W. Kamphuis M.B. Clark-Lewis I. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10418-10425Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this study we have explored the structure-function relationship of the CXCR3 ligands, in particular of I-TAC, which has highest affinity for CXCR3 and is the most potent agonist. We show that the NH2 terminus of I-TAC is important for the agonistic and antagonistic activity. The structural motifs responsible for the higher activity of I-TAC were determined with a series of synthesized I-TAC/IP10 hybrids. The data suggest that the differences in function of the CXCR3 ligands can be assigned to distinct regions and that these regions are interchangeable. All chemokines and chemokine analogs were chemically synthesized using tBoc (tertiary butyloxycarbonyl) solid-phase chemistry (37Clark-Lewis I., Vo, L. Owen P. Anderson J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 287: 233-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). They were purified by HPLC and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry. For each chemokine used, the mass determined by mass spectrometry corresponded to the expected value. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from buffy-coats of donor blood (Central Laboratory of the Swiss Red Cross, Bern, Switzerland) by centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque (38Loetscher P. Seitz M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with phytohemagglutinin (1 μg/ml) and expanded in the presence of IL-2 (200 units/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% glutamine, non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.05 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% human serum (Swiss Red Cross Laboratory, Bern, Switzerland) for 7–15 days. Murine pre-B 300-19 cells stably expressing CXCR3 (CXCR3-B300-19 cells) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (10Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). Competition binding assays were performed with CXCR3-B300-19 cells using 125I-I-TAC or125I-IP10 labeled by the Bolton-Hunter procedure (39Gong J.-H. Uguccioni M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10521-10527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, the maximal binding of labeled I-TAC and IP10 was determined by measuring binding at saturating concentrations. 5 × 106 cells were incubated with 3 nm labeled chemokine and increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor (10−9 to 3 × 10−6m) in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing Hepes (25 mm, pH 7.4), bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml), and sodium azide (0.1%). The incubations were carried out for 30 min at 4 °C, and cell-associated radioactivity was separated by spinning the cells through a 2:3 mixture of diacetylphthalate and dibutylphthalate and measured by gamma counting. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 100-fold concentration of unlabeled ligand and subtracted from the total. Dissociation constants (K d values) were determined by Scatchard analysis (40Clark-Lewis I. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ mobilization was assayed in Fura-2 (1-[2-(5-carboxyoxazol-2-yl)-6-aminobenzofuran-5-oxyl]-2-(2′-amino-5′-methylphenoxy)-ethan-N-N-N′-N′-tetraacetic acid)-loaded cells after single or sequential stimulation with chemokines or chemokine analogs by recording [Ca2+]i-related fluorescence changes (41von Tscharner V. Prod'hom B. Baggiolini M. Reuter H. Nature. 1986; 324: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The rate of the change was expressed as percent of Fura-2 saturation per second. Chemotaxis was assessed in 48-well Boyden microchambers (Neuro Probe Inc., Cabin John, MD) using polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membranes (Poretics Corp., Livermore, CA) with 3-μm pores (38Loetscher P. Seitz M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Cell suspensions and chemokine dilutions were made in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% pasteurized plasma protein (Swiss Red Cross Laboratory, Bern, Switzerland) and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Migration was allowed to proceed for 90 min and migrated cells were counted at a 1000× magnification in five fields per well. All determinations were performed in triplicate. Chemokine-induced internalization was assayed as described (42Amara A., Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Briefly, CXCR3-B300-19 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with increasing concentrations of chemokines to be tested. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, surface-bound ligands were removed by exposure to 50 mm glycine buffer, pH 3.0, containing 100 mmNaCl for 1 min followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Receptor expression was then determined by flow cytometry using phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-CXCR3 antibody (1C6, BD Biosciences), and the relative fluorescence intensity was calculated (43Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N.C. Schlöndorff D. Proudfoot A.E.I. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). CXCR3-B300-19 cells were used to determine the effect of NH2-terminal truncation of I-TAC on the binding to CXCR3. The competition for binding of 125I-I-TAC by unlabeled I-TAC and I-TAC analogs is shown in Fig. 1, A andB. The results show that I-TAC (2–73), (3–74), and (4–73) retained almost full CXCR3-binding activity. The dissociation constant (K d) for I-TAC was 3.0 ± 1.6 nm(n = 8); for I-TAC, (2–73) 4.0 ± 1.1 nm (n = 3); for I-TAC (3–73), 6.6 ± 0.9 nm (n = 3); and for I-TAC (4–73) 8.5 ± 1.1 nm (n = 4). A 10- to 100-fold lower affinity was obtained with I-TAC (5–73) (K d = 135 ± 45 nm,n = 3), I-TAC (6–73) (K d = 121 ± 58 nm, n = 3), I-TAC (7–73) (K d = 267 ± 70 nm,n = 3), I-TAC (8–73) (K d = 30 ± 16 nm, n = 3), and I-TAC (9–73) (K d = 341 ± 90 nm,n = 3). The functional activity of the analogs was assessed by measuring chemotactic migration of PHA and IL-2 activated T lymphocytes expressing CXCR3. As shown in Fig. 1 C, sequential NH2-terminal truncation leads to a loss of chemotaxis. Compared with full-length I-TAC, the activity of I-TAC (2–73) and I-TAC (3–73) was reduced by about 60–70%. Interestingly, although I-TAC (4–73) retained marked binding affinity, it was completely inactive, suggesting that it is an antagonist. In agreement with the binding data, I-TAC (5–73) to (9–73) were devoid of agonistic activity (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). In view of the observed properties, we tested whether I-TAC (4–73) has antagonistic activity for CXCR3. The migration of PHA- and IL-2-activated T lymphocytes in response to I-TAC was inhibited by I-TAC (4–73) as shown in Fig. 2 A. The inhibition of migration induced by optimal concentrations of I-TAC, IP10, and Mig was concentration-dependent and complete at 1000 nm(Fig. 2 B). The inhibitory effect of I-TAC (4–73) was most pronounced for IP10 and somewhat less for I-TAC and Mig. In agreement with the chemotaxis assays, the [Ca2+]i rise induced by I-TAC in PHA and IL-2 activated T lymphocytes was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner by pretreatment with I-TAC (4–73) (Fig. 2 C). I-TAC (4–73) did not induce [Ca2+]i changes, even at high concentrations, confirming that it is devoid of agonistic activity. Likewise, [Ca2+]i changes induced by IP10 and Mig were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by I-TAC (4–73) (Fig. 2 D). The same results were obtained when the effect of I-TAC (4–73) was assessed with CXCR3-B300-19 cells (data not shown). These data demonstrate that I-TAC (4–73) significantly inhibits CXCR3-mediated responses. The binding of chemokines leads to a rapid receptor internalization, which is not observed on binding of antagonists (35Loetscher P. Pellegrino A. Gong J.H. Mattioli I. Loetscher M. Bardi G.

Internalization was determined in PHA- and IL-2-activated T lymphocytes and CXCR3-B300-19 cells by flow cytometry before and after ligand exposure. As shown in Fig. 3, I-TAC and I-TAC (2–73), which have agonistic activity, induced a concentration-dependent internalization. On treatment with 100 nm I-TAC and I-TAC (2–73), CXCR3 expression levels decreased to 25 and 55%, respectively. In contrast, no internalization was observed when the cells were exposed to I-TAC (4–73) and, as expected, to the inactive analog, I-TAC (8–73). Together with the functional data, these results show that I-TAC (4–73) lacks agonistic activity and acts as a pure antagonist. Of the three CXCR3 ligands, I-TAC has highest receptor affinity and is the most potent agonist as shown by chemotaxis and [Ca2+]imobilization assays (7Cole K.E. Strick C.A. Paradis T.J. Ogborne K.T. Loetscher M. Gladue R.P. Lin W. Boyd J.G. Moser B. Wood D.E. Sahagan B.G. Neote K. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 2009-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 46Cox M.A. Jenh C.H. Gonsiorek W.

As shown in Fig. 5, A andB, I-TAC potently and fully displaced both125I-labeled I-TAC or IP10 with IC50 values of 5.3 ± 1.0 nm for 125I-I-TAC (n = 10) and of 2.5 ± 0.8 nm for125I-IP10 (n = 4). In contrast, IP10 was able to fully compete with 125I-IP10 (IC50 = 5.0 ± 1.7 nm, n = 4), but it was much less effective to displace 125I-I-TAC (IC50 = 41.4 ± 16.9 nm, n = 8), indicating that I-TAC may have an additional binding site for CXCR3. To identify amino acid residues or regions responsible for this difference, we have synthesized a series of I-TAC/IP10 hybrids (Fig. 4) and assayed them for125I-I-TAC competition binding and [Ca2+]i mobilization (Fig. 5, C and D). In I-TAC-H1 the NH2 terminus (residues 1–8) of IP10 was substituted by that of I-TAC, and conversely, in I-TAC-H3, the NH2 terminus (residues 1–8) of I-TAC was substituted by that of IP10. The importance of the N-loop region was tested with I-TAC-H2, in which six residues of the IP10 N-loop (residues 12–17) were replaced by the ones of I-TAC. As shown in Fig. 5 C, all hybrid chemokines displaced labeled I-TAC with IC50 values ranging in between the ones of I-TAC and IP10. I-TAC-H3 was the most potent competitor (IC50 = 6.5 ± 1.6 nm,n = 5) followed by I-TAC-H2 (IC50 = 29.2 ± 10.2 nm, n = 8) and I-TAC-H1 (IC50 = 38.6 ± 14.8 nm, n= 8).Figure 4Sequence alignment of CXCR3 ligands and I-TAC/IP10 hybrids. Shown are the sequences of I-TAC, I-TAC-H1, I-TAC-H2, I-TAC-H3, IP10, and Mig. For the hybrid chemokines the sequence corresponding to I-TAC are underlined. The conserved cysteine residues are shown in bold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In Ca2+ mobilization assays using CXCR3-B300-19 cells (Fig. 5 D) and PHA- and IL-2-activated T lymphocytes (data not shown), I-TAC was about 15-fold more potent than IP10 with EC30 values of 2.1 ± 0.4 nm for I-TAC (n = 3) and 31.9 ± 9.7 nm for IP10 (n = 3). I-TAC was also about 1.5-fold more efficacious than IP10 to mobilize calcium. All hybrid chemokines induced [Ca2+]i rises with a potency similar to I-TAC. I-TAC-H3 was the most potent agonist (EC30 = 4.1 ± 1.5, n = 3) closely followed by I-TAC-H1 (EC30 = 5.3 ± 2.5,n = 3) and I-TAC-H2 (EC30 = 8.0 ± 4.4, n = 3). I-TAC-H2 was as efficacious as I-TAC, whereas the efficacy of I-TAC-H1 and I-TAC-H3 was similar to IP10. Together with the binding studies, these results show that the amino acid residues in the N-loop region are largely responsible for the higher activity of I-TAC compared with IP10, as shown by the data obtained with I-TAC-H2 and I-TAC-H3. They also show that the NH2 terminus contributes to the observed difference between I-TAC and IP10, because an I-TAC-like IP10 analog (I-TAC-H1) is obtained by interchanging the NH2 termini. Furthermore, I-TAC-H3 demonstrates that amino acid substitutions are allowed in NH2 terminus of I-TAC without significant loss of activity. This is in agreement with the results from single amino acid replacement analogs in the NH2 terminus of I-TAC (P2G, M3A, M3F, M3Q, M3G, F4A, R8K I-TAC) which all had high affinity for CXCR3 and wild-type activity (data not shown). In contrast to I-TAC and IP10, Mig has an extended basic COOH-terminal region (Fig. 4) (7Cole K.E. Strick C.A. Paradis T.J. Ogborne K.T. Loetscher M. Gladue R.P. Lin W. Boyd J.G. Moser B. Wood D.E.

Med. 1995; 182: 1301-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The role of this extension is unknown, but it may interact with an additional site or a glycosaminoglycan binding site. Binding competition assays show that full-length Mig (1–103) displaced 125I-labeled I-TAC with an IC50 of 200 nm, indicating that it is about 30-fold less potent than I-TAC as competitor (Fig. 6 A). The binding affinity was further decreased by a factor of about 15 when the COOH-terminal region was deleted to give the shortened Mig analog 1–73 (IC50 = 3000 nm). The COOH-terminal region itself (74–103) lacked detectable activity. Consistent with the binding data, the migration of PHA and IL-2 activated T lymphocytes was significantly reduced by COOH-terminal truncation of Mig and as expected, the COOH terminus itself was inactive (Fig. 6 B). This study shows that the NH2-terminal-truncated I-TAC analog, I-TAC (4–73) is a potent antagonist for CXCR3. It competes for the binding of the labeled I-TAC to CXCR3 and inhibits chemotaxis and Ca2+ changes induced in CXCR3-positive cells by stimulation with I-TAC, IP10, and Mig. In addition, it shows that the NH2 termini of I-TAC and IP10 are interchangeable, and that IP10 can be converted into an I-TAC-like chemokine by substituting the N-loop region that follows the second cysteine with that of I-TAC. Numerous studies of structure-activity relations have shown that chemokines have two main sites of interaction with their receptors, one in the NH2 terminus and the other in the N-loop region after the second cysteine (48Fernandez E.J. Lolis E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 469-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 49Clark-Lewis I. Kim K.S. Rajarathnam K. Gong J.H. Dewald B. Moser B. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. J.

These findings have led to the proposal of a two-step model in which receptor binding and activation are dissociated. The receptor recognizes first the binding site located in the N-loop region (“docking domain”). This initial contact facilitates the subsequent binding and proper positioning of the flexible NH2-terminal region (“triggering domain”), which activates the receptor by presumably interacting with multiple receptor helical sites and inducing a change in the receptor conformation. Thus, the N-loop region is responsible for the receptor recognition, and the NH2-terminal region triggers the receptor. For all chemokines that have been studied, minimal truncations or substitutions within the triggering domain have led to a loss of receptor activation. Often, the modified chemokines, however, retained the capacity to bind and in this way to block the receptor (51Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp.

However, the molecular mechanism of this pathway remains unclear. In this report we demonstrate that both NIK and IκB kinase α (IKKα) are involved in LTβR signaling and that the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit at serine 536 in its transactivation domain 1 (TA1) plays an essential role. We also found that NF-κB could be activated in the LTβR pathway without altering the level of the phosphorylation of IκB and nuclear localization of p65. By using a heterologous transactivation system in which Gal4-dependent reporter gene is activated by the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in fusion with various portions of p65, we found that TA1 serves as a direct target in the NIK-IKKα pathway. In addition, mutation studies have revealed the essential role of Ser-536 within TA1 of p65 in transcriptional control mediated by NIK-IKKα. Furthermore, we found that Ser-536 was phosphorylated following the stimulation of LTβR, and this phosphorylation was inhibited by the kinase-dead dominant-negative mutant of either NIK or IKKα.

It has also been shown that NIK is indispensable for LTβR signaling but not for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling (5Yin L., Wu, L. Wesche H. Arthur C.D. Michael White J. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 2162-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which NF-κB is activated by LTβR signaling has not been clarified. NF-κB represents a family of eukaryotic transcription factors participating in the regulation of immune response, cell growth, and survival (12Baldwin A.S., Jr. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 13Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Okamoto T. Sakurada S. Yang J.P.

There are five members of the NF-κB/Rel family in mammalian cells: the proto-oncogene c-Rel, RelA (p65), RelB, NF-κB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-κB2 (p52 and its precursor p100). The most prevalent form of NF-κB is a heterodimer of the p50 subunit and p65 that contains transactivation domains necessary for gene induction (17Moore P.A. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1666-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A.

In cells, NF-κB is largely cytoplasmic and therefore remains transcriptionally inactive until a cell receives an appropriate stimulus. In response to proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), the IκB proteins become phosphorylated on two serine residues located in the N-terminal region (21Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IκB proteins results in rapid ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome (15Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev.

The large molecular weight complex consisting of two catalytic subunits, IκB kinases α and β (IKKα and IKKβ), and a regulatory subunit IKKγ was identified and shown to be responsible for phosphorylating IκB proteins (24DiDonato J.A.

It has recently been shown that IKKα is not required for IκB degradation or induction of NF-κB DNA binding but essential for the generation of transcriptionally competent NF-κB (30Sizemore N. Lerner N. Dombrowski N. Sakurayi H. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3863-3869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of IKKs is induced by a wide variety of NF-κB inducers such as TNF or IL-1β, and mediated by the upstream kinases including NIK and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 1/3 (31Nakano H.

NIK was originally identified as a protein interacting with the TNF receptor-associated factor 2 component of the TNF receptor complex (35Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). NIK physically interacts via its C-terminal region with IKKα and IKKβ and stimulates their catalytic activity as an upstream effector kinase (32Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The NF-κB p65 subunit contains at least two independent transactivation (TA) domains (TA1 and TA2) within its C-terminal 120 amino acids and is responsible for binding to the basal transcription factor TFIIB and CBP/p300 coactivators (19Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7219-7226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The TNF-mediated signaling was shown to involve phosphorylation of Ser-529 within TA1 by casein kinase II (CKII) (40Wang D. Baldwin A.S., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 41Wang D. Westerheide S.D. Hanson J.L. Baldwin A.S., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32592-32597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of IKKβ induced phosphorylation of p65 at Ser-536 (42Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). These two serine residues within p65 TA1 were also shown to be essential for Ras-mediated NF-κB activation involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt serine/threonine kinase (43Madrid L.V. Mayo M.W. Reuther J.Y. Baldwin A.S., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18934-18940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). These signal-induced p65 phosphorylation events appear to induce NF-κB-dependent gene expression by augmenting the transcriptional activity of NF-κB (p65) rather than by inducing IκB phosphorylation and promoting its nuclear translocation. Interestingly, recent studies revealed the presence of NF-κB and IκB in the nucleus even in the resting unstimulated cells (44Birbach A. Gold P. Binder B.R. Hofer E. Martin R.D. Schmid J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10842-10851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 45Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), thus making NF-κB susceptible for regulatory phosphorylation in the nucleus. In this study, we have attempted to clarify the molecular mechanism by which NIK activates NF-κB and found that the TA1 domain of p65 subunit is indispensable for NF-κB transcriptional activity. We demonstrate that the phosphorylation of p65 at Ser-536, mediated by NIK-IKKα, is crucial for LTβR signaling. Mammalian expression vectors, pM-p65, pM-p65-(286–551), pM-p65-(286–520), pm-p65-(521–551), pM-p65-(286–551:Δ443–476), and pcDNA3.1-p65 were created as previously described (48Tetsuka T. Uranishi H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4383-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). pM-p65-(1–286) was generated by amplifying the corresponding p65 fragment by PCR using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-CGGGATCCCGATGGACGAACTGTTCCCCCTCAT-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGAGCGAATTCCATGGGCTCACTGAGCT-3′ containing BamHI andXbaI sites. pM-p65-(431–551) was generated by PCR using the oligonucleotides 5′-CGGGATCCCGACCCAGGCTGGGGAAGGAA-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGAGCCGCGTTAGGAGCTGATCTG-3′ containing BamHI andXbaI sites. pm-p65-(521–551:S529A) was generated by PCR using the oligonucleotides 5′-GGAATT CCCGGGGCTCCCCAATGGCCTCCTTGCAGGAGATGA-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCGC GCGTTAGGAGCTGATCTGACTCAGCAGGGCT-3′ containing EcoRI and BamHI sites. In order to construct pM-p65-(521–551:S536A), the p65-(521–551:S536A) fragment was generated by PCR using pM-p65 as a template with the oligonucleotide primers 5′-GCTCTA GAGCCCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGATGGACGAACTGTTCCCCCTCATCTTCCCGGCAGAGCCAGCCC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGTTAGGAGCT GATCTGACTCAGCAGGGCTGAGAAGTCCATGTCCGCAATGGCGGAGAAGTCTTCATCTCCTGAAAGGAGGCC-3′, and this PCR product was cut with SmaI and BamHI. These PCR fragments were inserted into the pM vector at respective restriction sites. The plasmid expressing the FLAG-tagged p65, pcDNA3.1(−)-FLAG-p65, was generated by PCR using the oligonucleotides 5′-GCTCTAGAGCCCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGAC AAGATGGACGAACTGTTCCCCCTCATCTTCCCGGCAGAGCCAGCCC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGTTAGGAGCTGATCTGACTCAGCAGGGCTGAGAAGTCCATGTCCGC-3′ containing XbaI and BamHI sites. The PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen). pCR2FL-IKKα, pCR2FL-IKKβ, pCR2FL-IKKα(KM), and pCR2FL-IKKβ(KM) expression vectors encoding the wild-type and dominant-negative mutant of IKKα and IKKβ, respectively, were kindly provided by H. Nakano (31Nakano H. Shindo M. Sakno S. Nishinaka S. Mihara M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Wallach (35Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). The N-terminal deletion mutant of IκBα (IκBαΔN) encoding amino acids 37–317 (pcDNA3-IκBαΔN) was constructed as described previously (49Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M., Qi, X.

The plasmid expressing the Myc-tagged IκB phosphorylation-defective mutant, pcDNA-Myc-IκBα(S32A/S36A), was kindly provided by S. Hatakeyama (51Shirane M. Hatakeyama S. Hattori K. Nakayama K.

The construction of luciferase (luc) reporter plasmids of 4κBw-luccontaining four tandem copies of the HIV κB sequence located upstream of minimal SV40 promoter and 4κBm-luc harboring four mutated inactive κB sites have been described previously (52Yang J.P. Hori M. Sanda T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15662-15670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Another luciferase reporter plasmid, Gal4-luc(pFR-luc, Stratagene), containing five tandem copies of the Gal4 binding site upstream of TATA box was used for the evaluation of the transcriptional activity of pM-p65 and its derivatives. All PCR amplification reactions used ExpandTM high fidelity system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All the constructs were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing using ABI PRISMTM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on an Applied Biosystems 313 automated DNA sequencer. 293 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (IBL, Maebashi, Japan). Cells were transfected using FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. HT29 cells were grown at 37 °C in McCoy's 5A Medium Modified (Sigma) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (IBL), and cells were transfected using LipofectAMINETMreagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. At 48-h post-transfection, the cells were harvested, and the cell extracts were prepared for the luciferase assay. Luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega) as described previously (52Yang J.P. Hori M. Sanda T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15662-15670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was monitored byRenilla luciferase activity using the pRL-TK plasmid (Promega) as an internal control, and the luciferase activity was normalized by the Renilla luciferase activity. For each transfection, 50 ng of the luc reporter plasmid and 25 ng of internal control plasmid pRL-TK were used. pUC19 was used to adjust the total amount of DNA (500 ng) transfected. Cells without the stimulation of TNF were lysed 48 h after transfection, and the luciferase activity was measured. Other cells, as indicated, were stimulated with 10 ng/ml of TNF after 24 h of transfection and lysed after an additional incubation for 24 h or stimulated with 2 μg/ml of agonistic anti-LTβR monoclonal antibody (mAb) (AC.H6) (53Browning J.L. Sizing I.D. Lawton P. Bourdon P.R. Rennert P.D. Majeau G.R. Ambrose C.M. Hession C. Miatkowski K. Griffiths D.A. Ngam-ek A. Meier W. Benjamin C.D. Hochman P.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3288-3298PubMed Google Scholar) 10 h before cells were harvested. The data are presented as the fold increase in luciferase activity (mean ± S.D.) relative to the control of three independent transfections. The intracellular localization of p65 in HT29 cells was examined by immunostaining as described previously (50Kajino S. Suganuma M. Teranishi F. Takahashi N. Tetsuka T. Ohara H. Itoh M. Okamoto T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, HT29 cells were cultured in 2-well chamber slides and after stimulating with 10 ng/ml of TNF for 15 min or 2 μg/ml of agonistic anti-LTβR mAb for 40 min, cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde/PBS at room temperature for 20 min and then permeabilized by 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 20 min at room temperature. They were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody against p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 37 °C, rinsed three timed with 0.05% Triton X-100/PBS, and incubated with secondary antibody, fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (CAPPEL; ICN Pharmaceuticals), for 1 h at 37 °C. The slides were rinsed three times with PBS and mounted with buffered glycerol for fluorescent microscopic examination. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted at 1:100 and 1:200 in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, respectively. In order to monitor the phosphorylation of IκB, HT29 cells were stimulated with TNF or agonist anti-LTβR mAb, and the cells were lysed in 350 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). To evaluate the protein level of p65, 293 cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Whole cell extracts were lysed in 350 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer. In order to evaluate the protein level of p65, NIK(KM), IKKα(KM), and IκB(S32A/S36A), 48 h after transfection, cells were stimulated by 2 μg/ml of agonist anti-LTβR mAb for 40 min, lysed, cleared by centrifugation, and determined for the protein concentration using Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The cell lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were incubated with antibodies to anti-IκBα (New England Biolabs), anti-phospho-IκBα (New England Biolabs), anti-β-tubulin (MONOSAN), anti-Gal4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG epitope (M2 antibody; Sigma), or anti-Myc epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemilluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). To detect the phosphorylated p65 at Ser-536, HT29 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids including pcDNA3.1(−)-FLAG-p65, treated with 2 μg/ml of anti-LTβR mAb for 40 min, and lysed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min in 2 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 300 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% of glycerol, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1× Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 5 mm sodium fluoride, 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Kodak) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer and resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Western blot was conducted by using anti-phospho-p65 NF-κB (Ser-536) antibody (Cell Signaling). In Fig. 1 A, the effects of TNF and LTβR signaling on NF-κB-mediated gene expression were compared. TNF stimulated NF-κB-dependent gene expression in both 293 and HT29 cells. However, the agonistic LTβR mAb stimulated gene expression only in the LTβR-expressing HT29 cells as reported (54Mackay F. Majeau G.R. Hochman P.S. Browning J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24934-24938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Overexpression of NIK stimulated gene expression in both cells, indicating that the differences in these cells depend on LTβR. In addition, overexpression of IKKα alone did not significantly activate the NF-κB-dependent gene expression in both cells whereas that of IKKβ activated the gene expression by 3- and 1.8-fold in 293 and HT29 cells, respectively. In fact, whereas IKKβ overexpression induced IκBα degradation, IKKα overexpression did not (data not shown). These findings suggested that the upstream signal is required for optimal activation as previously reported (24DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 26Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 1 B, TNF stimulation induced the phosphorylation of IκBα and subsequent degradation in HT29 cells. However, stimulation of LTβR did not induce either IκBα phosphorylation or its degradation, yet induced NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Moreover, whereas TNF induced the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in HT29 cells, LTβR did not (Fig. 1 C). The presence of NF-κB in the nucleus even in the resting cells has been demonstrated recently by Birbach et al. (44Birbach A. Gold P. Binder B.R. Hofer E. Martin R.D. Schmid J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10842-10851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) (see also Ref. 55Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar for review). These findings suggest that the LTβR signaling stimulates NF-κB activity without inducing IκBα degradation or NF-κB nuclear translocation as reported by Yin et al. (5Yin L., Wu, L. Wesche H. Arthur C.D. Michael White J. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 2162-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and that the activation of NF-κB by the LTβR signaling is not through alteration of intracellular localization of NF-κB but presumably by augmenting its transcriptional activity. In a series of experiments using transient κB luciferase assays, we have explored the kinase responsible for NF-κB activation in the LTβR cascade by using the dominant-negative kinase mutants of NIK (NIK(KM)), IKKα (IKKα(KM)), and IKKβ (IKKβ(KM)). As demonstrated in Fig. 2 A, when NIK(KM), IKKα(KM), or IKKβ(KM) were overexpressed in 293 cells, the TNF-induced NF-κB activation was greatly inhibited by either of these mutants, more remarkable by IKKβ(KM). A similar observation was obtained with HT29 cells (data not shown). These results are consistent with the fact that the TNF-mediated NF-κB activation was abolished in the IKKβ gene knock-out mice but could not entirely be abolished in IKKα and NIK knock-out mice (5Yin L., Wu, L.

Interestingly, the induction of NF-κB-dependent gene expression by agonist anti-LTβR mAb was strongly inhibited by NIK(KM) or IKKα(KM) in HT29 cells but not by IKKβ(KM). In Fig. 2 B, synergistic activation of gene expression was investigated. When wild-type NIK, IKKα, or IKKβ were overexpressed together with TNF signaling in 293 cells, there was no significant augmentation by IKKα as compared from TNF alone. However, either NIK or IKKβ augmented the effect of TNF in inducing NF-κB-dependent gene expression, which were statistically significant (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). On the other hand, in HT29 cells, the gene expression elicited by anti-LTβR mAb was augmented significantly by IKKα and NIK (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively) but not at all by IKKβ. These data collectively indicated that the TNF-induced NF-κB activation is mainly through IKKβ but the NF-κB activation in LTβR pathway is mediated by NIK and IKKα, which was consistent with the previous study (4Matsushima A.

The complete molecular determinants required for adhesive junction formation and their function are not completely understood. LIM domain-containing proteins have been shown to be present at cell-cell contact sites and are known to shuttle into the nucleus where they can affect cell fate and growth; however, their precise localization at cell-cell contacts, how they localize to these sites, and what their functions are at these sites is unknown. Here we show that, in primary keratinocytes, the LIM domain protein Ajuba is recruited to cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesive complexes in a regulated manner. At cadherin adhesive complexes Ajuba interacts with α-catenin, and α-catenin is required for efficient recruitment of Ajuba to cell junctions. Ajuba also interacts directly with F-actin. Keratinocytes from Ajuba null mice exhibit abnormal cell-cell junction formation and/or stability and function. These data reveal Ajuba as a new component at cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions and suggest that Ajuba may contribute to the bridging of the cadherin adhesive complexes to the actin cytoskeleton and as such contribute to the formation or strengthening of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion.

During development, cell-cell contacts provide spatial clues for cell polarity and sorting, thereby ensuring proper cellular organization within tissues. Cell surface adhesion receptor proteins direct cell-cell adhesion. The cadherins, for example, are a superfamily of receptors that display calcium-dependent adhesion between the same types of proteins (i.e. homophilic interaction). E-cadherin is one of the best studied cell-cell adhesion proteins. In epithelia, E-cadherin has an important role in the generation and maintenance of the cell morphology, polarity, and function (1Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 2Steinberg M.S. McNutt P.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). At adhesive contacts, E-cadherin receptors also provide cytosolic actin filaments with points of attachment to the membrane, from which tension and reorganization of the cortical cytoskeleton are initiated. E-cadherin-mediated adhesion triggers redistribution of membrane, cytoskeletal, and cytosolic signaling proteins to sites of cell-cell contacts, giving rise to multiprotein signaling complexes (1Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Much investigation has been directed at understanding how these supramolecular protein complexes are formed, what proteins make up the functional complex, and what their contribution is to the strength of junction formation and remodeling of the cytoskeletal network. Proteins of the catenin family indirectly mediate the binding of actin filaments to cadherin receptors. β-Catenin (or γ-catenin/plakoglobin) associates directly with the cadherin tail, and then α-catenin bridges the β-catenin-cadherin complex to actin filaments (1Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). α-Catenin is an essential component of the cadherin complex (1Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). It not only binds and bundles actin (3Rimm D.L. Koslov E.R. Kebriaei P. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8813-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) but also provides docking sites for other cytoskeletal proteins that may contribute to the cytoskeletal reorganization at junctions, such as vinculin and α-actinin (reviewed in Ref. 4Provost E. Rimm D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Cytosolic proteins containing LIM domains have also been observed to localize at cell-cell contact sites (5Crawford A.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5847-5853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Petit M.M.R. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A.Y. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J.M. Friederich E. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). LIM domains contain two tandemly repeated zinc fingers implicated in protein-protein interactions. They are found in a wide variety of proteins present in the nucleus or cytoplasm or that shuttle between these two cellular compartments (reviewed in Ref. 9Bach I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The LIM domain-containing protein family can be subdivided into different subfamilies according to sequence homology within the LIM domains, the number of LIM domains, and their organization within the proteins (9Bach I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The Zyxin subfamily of cytosolic LIM proteins is characterized by the presence of three related LIM domains at the COOH terminus and unique PreLIM regions, which are rich in proline residues (10Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Within this family, there have been five mammalian members described: Zyxin (5Crawford A.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5847-5853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), LPP (11Petit M. Mols R. Schoenmakers E. Mandahl N. Van De Ven W.

In fibroblasts, they localize to sites of attachment to the substratum (focal adhesion) and can associate with the actin cytoskeleton (6Petit M.M.R. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A.Y.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1549-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, they contain nuclear export signals and shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (6Petit M.M.R. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A.Y. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J.M. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Kanungo J. Pratt S.J. Marie H.

Whereas the significance of Zyxin and LPP nuclear localization is not clear, accumulation of Ajuba in the nucleus plays a role in growth control and differentiation (7Kanungo J. Pratt S.J. Marie H. Longmore G.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3299-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, these proteins could be ideal candidates to convey messages from adhesion sites to the nucleus. How these proteins are recruited to these disparate cellular locations and what their cellular functions are at these sites is not well understood. Ajuba is expressed in organs abundant in epithelia, such as skin, kidney, liver, lung, and the genitourinary system (13Goyal R.K. Lin P. Kanungo J. Payne A.S. Muslin A.J. Longmore G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis of embryonal carcinoma cells revealed that, as sheets of contacted cells formed, Ajuba was localized to cell-cell contacts (7Kanungo J. Pratt S.J. Marie H. Longmore G.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3299-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine how Ajuba is recruited to cell junctions in epithelia, we used primary human keratinocytes as an epithelial model. In these primary cells, we found that Ajuba preferentially co-localizes with cadherin adhesive complexes at sites of cell-cell contacts but not at focal adhesions. Recruitment of Ajuba to cell-cell junctions was regulated and occurs through a direct interaction with α-catenin. Ajuba also interacted directly with filamentous actin, suggesting that Ajuba could contribute to the bridging of the cadherin adhesive complexes to the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, in addition to its role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (7Kanungo J. Pratt S.J. Marie H. Longmore G.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3299-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Goyal R.K. Lin P. Kanungo J. Payne A.S. Muslin A.J. Longmore G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Ajuba may also function in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion. Normal human keratinocytes (strain Kb, passages 3–7) were grown in standard medium (1.8 mm calcium ions) (19Rheinwald J.G. Green H. Cell. 1975; 6: 331-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3836) Google Scholar) or in low calcium medium (20Hodivala K.J. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) (0.1 mm calcium). For induction of cell-cell contacts, confluent keratinocytes grown in low calcium medium were changed to standard medium for different periods of time. COS-7 cells, human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-468, human keratinocyte cell line HaCAT, and human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A-431 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Primary cortical glial cells were isolated from rat pups (2 days postnatal) as described (21Banker G. Goslin K. Nature. 1988; 336: 185-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Primary mouse keratinocyte growth medium contained calcium-free Eagle's minimal essential medium, 0.05 mmCaCl2, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 2 × 10−9m 3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyronine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 4% Chelex-treated fetal bovine serum. The following monoclonal antibodies were used to detect E-cadherin: mouse monoclonal HECD-1 (22Shimoyama Y. Hirohashi S. Hirano S. Nogushi M. Shimosato Y. Takeichi M. Abe O. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2128-2133PubMed Google Scholar) and rat monoclonal ECCD-2 (23Hirai Y. Nose A. Kobayashi S. Takeichi M. Development. 1989; 105: 271-277PubMed Google Scholar) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Mouse monoclonal antibodies used included anti-N-cadherin (13A9), anti-β1-integrins P5D2 and VM2 (24Dittel B.N.

Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J.M. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and Trip6 antiserum was kindly provided by M. Beckerle (University of Utah) (16Yi J. Kloeker S. Jensen C.C. Bockholt S. Honda H. Hirai H. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol.

Antiserum directed against murine LIMD1 was generated by immunizing rabbits with a baculovirus produced and purified PreLIM region of LIMD1. Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were from Jackson Laboratories (Stratech Scientific). Immunofluorescence was performed essentially as described (27Braga V.M.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 10% fetal calf serum/PBS1 for 10 min before sequential incubation with the primary and secondary antibodies. For some experiments, simultaneous fixation and permeabilization was performed using 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. In addition, prepermeabilization of the cells in 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 50 mmNaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride prior to fixation was performed (25Braga V.M.M. Hodivala K.J. Watt F.M. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1995; 3: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Images were collected using a Bio-Rad confocal microscope. Different Ajuba plasmids were microinjected into the nucleus of normal keratinocytes grown in standard medium as small colonies (28Braga V.M.M. Betson M., Li, X. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3703-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). After 2-h expression, coverslips were double labeled for E-cadherin and the Myc tag. Latex beads (15 μm; Polysciences) were coated with the mouse monoclonal anti-E-cadherin (HECD-1), anti-integrin (VM2), or bovine serum albumin as previously described (27Braga V.M.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes cultured in low calcium medium were incubated with beads (105 beads/coverslip) resuspended in low calcium medium for 15 min at 37 °C. Coverslips were washed in PBS, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, and co-stained with phalloidin and anti-Ajuba or anti-α-catenin antiserum. Amino-terminal hexa-Myc-tagged mammalian expression vectors used were pCS2-mAjuba, pCS2-PreLIM (NH2-terminal PreLIM domain of Ajuba), pCS2-LIM (COOH-terminal three LIM domains of Ajuba) (13Goyal R.K. Lin P. Kanungo J. Payne A.S. Muslin A.J. Longmore G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pCS2-hZyxin, pCS2-hLPP, and pCS2-mLIMD1. Bacterial expression plasmids (pGEX vector; Amersham Biosciences) were GST-β-catenin (full-length), GST-A907 (α-catenin full-length), GST-C447 (α-catenin COOH-terminal amino acids), GST-N228 (α-catenin NH2-terminal amino acids (3Rimm D.L. Koslov E.R. Kebriaei P. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8813-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar)), and GST-E-cadherin tail (29Lickert H. Bauer A. Kemler R. Stappert J J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5090-5095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We introduced a His-FLAG epitope tag into the baculovirus vector pBacPAK9 (Clontech). All cDNAs were then subcloned to generate NH2-terminal epitope-tagged proteins and sequenced to confirm the proper reading frame. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated using the Clontech BacPAK baculovirus expression system as described by the manufacturer. SF21 insect cells were infected with viruses, and 48 h postinfection cells were collected and lysed, and proteins were purified by passing extracts over Protein A-Sepharose beads containing bound anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Following extensive washing of the columns, bound protein was eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma), dialyzed, and concentrated. For Western blots, cultured cells were homogenized in SDS loading buffer or radioimmune precipitation buffer, sonicated, and boiled. After separation in a SDS-PAGE gel, samples were transferred to membranes, probed with primary antibodies, and revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For pull-down assays, COS-7 cells were transfected by LipofectAMINE (Clontech) with 10 μg of plasmid and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After a wash in PBS supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, cells were scraped and pooled together in solubilization buffer A (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors). After solubilization for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel, the lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Precleared supernatants were incubated with the different GST fusion proteins bound to the glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h on a wheel at 4 °C. GST was used as a negative control. The beads were then washed four times with solubilization buffer (same composition as above, but with 0.4% Nonidet P-40). Bound proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-Myc antibodies. COS-7 cells were transfected using Trans-IT LT1 (Panvera, Inc.) with 10 μg of plasmid and incubated for 24 h. Cells were harvested, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and then lysed in 500 μl of cold G-Buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm CaCl2) containing protease inhibitors. To polymerize actin, G-actin stocks (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) were diluted to 0.4 mg/ml in G-Buffer and incubated on ice for 1 h. Polymerization buffer 50× (2.5 m KCl, 100 mmMgCl2, 50 mm ATP) was diluted to 1× in the actin stock for 1 h at room temperature. F-actin (5.5 μm) was mixed with COS lysate or purified protein for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in polymerization buffer. Equivalent amounts of the supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc or anti-FLAG antibodies. Cells were harvested, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in isotonic lysis buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitors. Precleared lysates were incubated with primary antiserum for 1 h at 4 °C, Protein A/G-Sepharose was added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation and washed four times with isotonic lysis buffer. Precipitated proteins were identified by Western blots. For immunodepletion experiments, HaCAT cell extracts were prepared as described above, and a sample of preimmunoprecipitation extract was put aside. Extracts were divided into three portions and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against Ajuba, E-cadherin, or α-catenin. Following immunoprecipitation, a portion of the postimmunoprecipitation extract was put aside. Equal amounts of pre- and postimmunoprecipitation extracts were then immunoblotted with anti-Ajuba or anti-Zyxin antibodies. Immune complexes were also immunoblotted to confirm immunoprecipitation of the appropriate protein. Membranes were prepared from cells lysed in hypotonic buffer on ice. Following a low speed spin, the supernatant underwent a high speed spin (100,000 × g) to pellet membranes. Membranes were resuspended in buffer A. His-FLAG-Ajuba, His-FLAG-PreLIM, and His-FLAG-LIM protein (5 μg each) were precleared by incubation with 5 μg of GST and glutathione-agarose beads in isotonic lysis buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, each protein was incubated with 5 μg of each purified GST fusion protein with E-cadherin tail, β-catenin, full-length α-catenin, α-catenin N228, and α-catenin C447 for 1 h at 4 °C. Glutathione-agarose beads were added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation, pellets were washed four times with isotonic lysis buffer. Precipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. Prior analyses had demonstrated that Ajuba was expressed in tissues rich in epithelia (13Goyal R.K. Lin P. Kanungo J. Payne A.S. Muslin A.J. Longmore G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we determined and contrasted protein levels of Ajuba and related family members, in primary epithelial cells (mouse keratinocytes) and primary mesenchymal cells (mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)) (Fig. 1 a). Surprisingly, the level of Ajuba present in epithelial cells greatly exceeded that in MEFs (by 10–20-fold), whereas for other family members expression in MEFs was greater than (e.g. LPP, Trip6, and Zyxin) or equivalent to (e.g. LIMD1) epithelial cells. Thus, of the Zyxin family of cytosolic LIM proteins, Ajuba was preferentially expressed in epithelial cells. This analysis also demonstrated that the Ajuba antiserum did not cross-react with other family members. The multiple bands detected with the Ajuba antiserum represent differential serine/threonine phosphorylation of Ajuba (data not shown). Next, we determined the subcellular localization of endogenous Ajuba in primary epithelial cells: human keratinocytes and rat glial cells. In keratinocytes, immunostaining for Ajuba co-localized with E-cadherin staining at junctions (Fig. 1, b and c). Whereas E-cadherin staining at the cell surface was uniform, Ajuba staining was more discontinuous. The same junctional localization of Ajuba was observed in primary rat glial cells using anti-N-cadherin and anti-Ajuba antibodies (data not shown). This junctional localization of Ajuba was specific, since preabsorption of the antibody with GST-Ajuba completely abolished staining at cell-cell contacts, while not affecting E-cadherin staining (Fig. 1, d and e). Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions prepared from confluent sheets of the keratinocytes cell line, HaCAT cells, indicated that ∼10% of the cellular Ajuba was present in the membrane fraction (total cell membranes, data not shown). Thus, in primary epithelial cells, Ajuba was found to localize at membranes where neighboring cells contact each other and co-localized with cadherins at these cell-cell junctions. Zyxin, a related family member, localizes at sites of adhesion to substratum (focal contacts) in fibroblasts (5Crawford A.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5847-5853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Ajuba was also recruited to these sites in keratinocytes, cells were fixed and permeabilized simultaneously to facilitate visualization of focal adhesions. Under these conditions, β1-integrin staining was observed at both cell-cell contacts and focal adhesions (Fig. 2, a and e). Whereas Zyxin staining showed strong labeling at focal contacts (Fig. 2 f), only a minor proportion of Ajuba staining co-localized with β1 integrins at these sites (Fig. 2 b). Junctional staining of Ajuba is not well visualized in this focal plane, since it was chosen to optimize β-integrin staining. Ajuba staining was predominantly at the cell junctions and co-localized with E-cadherin (Fig. 2, c and d), whereas only faint labeling of Zyxin was seen at the keratinocyte junctions (Fig. 2,g and h). Thus, in primary keratinocytes, the localization of Ajuba was predominantly at cell-cell junctions and distinct from the localization of Zyxin, which was primarily at focal adhesion sites. Cadherins and cadherin-associated proteins present at cell-cell adhesion sites become detergent-insoluble following recruitment to cell surface adhesive complexes. To determine whether Ajuba also became detergent-insoluble after redistribution to junctions, cell-cell contacts were induced, and the total amount of cadherin and Ajuba staining at junctions was determined (Fig. 3, a and b,fixed). We tested two different extraction conditions of increasing stringency: fixed and permeabilized at the same time (Fig. 3, c and d, fixed/perm) or prepermeabilized before fixation (Fig. 3, e andf, pre-perm; see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Under both extraction conditions, the cytoplasmic staining of E-cadherin and Ajuba was mostly removed, whereas a significant proportion of the two proteins remained insoluble at the keratinocyte junctions (Fig. 3, arrows). This indicated that, under these biochemical conditions, Ajuba and E-cadherin were recruited to the same “compartment” at cell-cell junctions. A time course of induction of cell-cell contacts was studied in keratinocytes. To initiate cell-cell contacts, confluent keratinocytes were switched from low Ca2+ to standard Ca2+-containing medium, and cells were double labeled for E-cadherin and Ajuba (Fig. 4). In control cells (maintained in the absence of cell-cell adhesion), no co-localization of Ajuba and E-cadherin was observed in the cytosol (low calcium medium) (Fig. 4,a–c). However, as early as 5 min after cell-cell adhesion was stimulated by calcium addition, both Ajuba and E-cadherin accumulated at contact sites (Fig. 4, d and e), and this progressively increased over 60 min (Fig. 4, g andh). Merged images indicated that Ajuba and E-cadherin were now co-localized at cell-cell contact sites (Fig. 4, f andi). These results indicated that Ajuba recruitment to cell junctions was regulated by the initiation of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion and temporally followed E-cadherin redistribution to the cell surface. Many other cellular proteins are recruited to E-cadherin-dependent adhesive sites. To determine whether clustering of E-cadherin receptors was sufficient to recruit Ajuba, we used latex beads coated with antibodies against E-cadherin (27Braga V.M.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). This technique has been routinely used to demonstrate the recruitment of specific cytosolic proteins according to the receptor clustered (27Braga V.M.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). We incubated keratinocytes grown in the absence of cell-cell contact with anti-E-cadherin (Fig. 5,a–d), anti-integrin (Fig. 5, e andf), or bovine serum albumin-coated beads (data not shown). Under these conditions, Ajuba was recruited to anti-E-cadherin beads but not substantially to anti-integrin beads (Fig. 5, compared with f) or bovine serum albumin beads (data not shown). Both types of antibody-coated beads were able to recruit actin (Fig. 5, a, c, and e). As a positive control, α-catenin was recruited to anti-E-cadherin-coated beads (Fig. 5 b). Thus, it seems that E-cadherin clustering was sufficient to translocate cytosolic Ajuba to the adhesive complex. To determine what component(s) of the cadherin adhesive complex Ajuba interacted with, GST-fusion proteins comprising components of the cadherin adhesive complex were added to COS cell extracts prepared from cells transiently transfected with Ajuba plasm"

Recent studies have shown that alveolar epithelial cells (AECs), in addition to promoting PC attachment, also participate in lung inflammation by the release of cytokines and chemokines. Herein, we demonstrate that a PC β-glucan rich cell wall isolate (PCBG) stimulates the release of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) from isolated AECs through a lactosylceramide-dependent mechanism. The results demonstrate that MIP-2 mRNA and protein production is significantly increased at both early and late time points after PCBG challenge. Although CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1, CR3) is the most widely studied β-glucan receptor, we demonstrate that CD11b/CD18 is not present on AECs. This study instead demonstrates that preincubation of AECs with an antibody directed against the membrane glycosphingolipid lactosylceramide (CDw17) results in a significant decrease in MIP-2 secretion. Preincubation of the anti-CDw17 antibody with solubilized lactosylceramide reverses this effect. Furthermore, incubation of AECs with inhibitors of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, includingN-butyldeoxyno jirimycin andd-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol-HCl, also results in a significant decrease in AEC MIP-2 production following challenge with PCBG. These data demonstrate that PC β-glucan induces significant production of MIP-2 from AECs and that CDw17 participates in the glucan-induced inflammatory signaling in lung epithelial cells during PC infection.

Despite the availability of effective medications, the mortality from PC pneumonia ranges between 15 and 40% (1Thomas C.F., Jr. Limper A.H. Semin. Respir. Infect. 1998; 13: 289-295PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophilic lung inflammation promotes diffuse alveolar damage and contributes significantly to the respiratory failure, which is characteristic of severe PC pneumonia (2Limper A.H. Offord K.P. Smith T.F. Martin 2nd, W.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 140: 1204-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The exact mechanisms by which PC induce this lung inflammation are not fully understood, although recent studies indicate that β-glucan components of the organism cell wall drive neutrophil accumulation during this pneumonia (3Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). P. carinii has recently been classified as a fungal organism based on RNA homology and evidence that PC assembles a cell wall rich in β-glucans (4Edman J.C. Kovacs J.A. Masur H. Santi D.V.

Fungal β-glucans consisting of 1,3-linked β-d-glucopyranosyl residues with varying amounts of 1,6-linked β-d-pyranosyl side chains represent essential structural components of many fungal cell walls (6Kollar R.

Purified β-glucans from various fungal species strongly induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines from inflammatory cells (8Abel G. Czop J.K. Int. J.

Previous studies demonstrate that the PC cyst cell wall contains complex carbohydrates rich in β-glucans, chitin, and a mannose-rich major surface glycoprotein complex termed gpA (5Matsumoto Y. Matsuda S. Tegoshi T. J. Protozool. 1989; 36: 21S-22SCrossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Nollstadt K.H. Powles M.A. Fujioka H. Aikawa M. Schmatz D.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2258-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have recently purified particulate β-glucan from P. carinii and have demonstrated that alveolar macrophages produce tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) in response to this PC cell wall component (3Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar,11Hoffman O.A. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3932-3940PubMed Google Scholar). Fungal glucans have been shown to bind several different receptors. In particular, the β2 integrin CD11b/CD18 (CR3, Mac-1) has been extensively studied as a major leukocyte membrane receptor for β-glucans (12Thornton B.P. Vetvicka V. Pitman M. Goldman R.C. Ross G.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1235-1246PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ross G.D. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 20: 197-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD11b/CD18 possesses one or multiple lectin binding sites on the C-terminal domain of the CD11b/CD18 α subunit capable of interacting with complex carbohydrates (14Vetvicka V. Thornton B.P. Ross G.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Additional studies using leukocytes have further demonstrated that the cell membrane glycosphingolipid, lactosylceramide (CDw17), also interacts with β-glucans (15Zimmerman J.W. Lindermuth J. Fish P.A. Palace G.P. Stevenson T.T. DeMong D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22014-22020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Interaction of glucans with CDw17 has also been reported to promote enhancement of the oxidative burst response and NF-kB activation of neutrophils (16Wakshull E. Brunke-Reese D. Lindermuth J. Fisette L. Nathans R.S. Crowley J.J. Tufts J.C. Zimmerman J. Mackin W. Adams D.S. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 41: 89-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Histological studies consistently identify P. cariniiorganisms closely associated with the alveolar epithelium in infected human and animal tissues. Furthermore, the binding of P. carinii to alveolar epithelial cells is believed to be essential for establishment of infection (17Limper A.H. Edens M. Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1148-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, accumulating evidence demonstrates that pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells not only function as a passive barrier mediating gas exchange but also actively participate in the host immune response. Alveolar epithelial cells are capable of processing and presenting antigen to T lymphocytes (18Kallenberg C.G. Schilizzi B.M. Beaumont F. Poppema S., De Leij L. The T.H. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1987; 67: 182-190PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schneeberger E.E. DeFerrari M. Skoskiewicz M.J. Russell P.S. Colvin R.B. Lab. Invest. 1986; 55: 138-144PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, isolated alveolar epithelial cells produce and secrete various cytokines and chemokines, including TNFα and MIP-2, when stimulated with bacterial components like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or whole organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis(20Standiford T.J.

MIP-2 is of particular interest in the pathogenesis of P. carinii pneumonia, because it represents the rodent homologue of the human CXC chemokine IL-8 and is thus a potent stimulant of neutrophil accumulation and activation (24Wolpe S.D. Cerami A. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2565-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 25Schmal H. Shanley T.P. Jones M.L. Friedl H.P. Ward P.A. J.

Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although chemokine expression is an important component of the inflammatory response against PC pneumonia, exuberant expression can cause deleterious effects on respiratory system function. Bronchoalveolar lavage studies in humans demonstrate that greater degrees of lung inflammation, as evidenced by increased neutrophil burdens, are associated with worse oxygenation and increased mortality duringP. carinii pneumonia (2Limper A.H. Offord K.P. Smith T.F. Martin 2nd, W.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 140: 1204-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The current study was therefore undertaken to determine the extent to which P. carinii cell wall β-glucans, induce the expression of MIP-2 from primary AECs. We further sought to determine whether the mechanisms of AEC activation by PC β-glucans was mediated through CD11b/CD18 or through the alternate lactosylceramide (CDw17)-associated β-glucan receptor. Enhanced local production of MIP-2 by AECs may significantly promote neutrophilic lung inflammation that characterizes severe P. carinii pneumonia and contributes to respiratory failure in this infection. Unless otherwise noted, general reagents were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). P. carinii f. sp. (formae specialis) carinii was originally obtained through the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in our immunosuppressed rat colony. The following antibodies were used: anti-CD11b (M-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), FITC anti-CD45 (OX-1, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), anti-CDw17 (Huly-M13, Ancell, Bayport, MN), anti-asialoGM1 2GM1, Galβ1→3GalNAcβ1→4(NeuAcα2→3)Galβ1→4Glcβ1-Cer. (Matreya, State College, PA). We recently described the purification and characterization of a β-glucan-rich cell wall isolate from P. carinii (3Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This isolate was found to contain 95.7% carbohydrate and 4.3% protein by weight using the orcinol-sulfuric acid method and BCA protein determinations, respectively. A sample of the P. carinii cell wall isolate was largely, though not completely, hydrolyzed with 2 m HCl thereby releasing 82% of its content as d-glucose measured by the glucose oxidase method. Thus, the majority of this material represents P. carinii-derived glucose polymer, namely glucans (3Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This material was previously reported to be active in stimulating alveolar macrophages to release TNFα and was markedly degraded by β-1,3-glucanases, losing most of its stimulatory activity following digestion (3Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The β-glucan-rich P. carinii cell wall isolate was exhaustively washed with SDS (1%) and polymyxin (10 μg/ml) to remove any contaminating endotoxin. The final wash was assayed for endotoxin using a modified Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Whittaker M.A. Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD) and consistently found to contain <0.125 unit/ml endotoxin (3Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Rat alveolar epithelial cells were isolated according to the method of Dobbset al. (27Dobbs L.G. Gonzalez R. Williams M.C. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 134: 141-145PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Sprague-Dawley rats (∼250 g) were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) and exsanguinated by transfection of the inferior vena cava. Blood was evacuated from the pulmonary vasculature by perfusion with normal saline. The trachea was isolated, and the lungs were lavaged multiple times to remove alveolar macrophages. AECs were separated from the basement membrane by filling and incubating the lungs with porcine elastase (1500 units/animal) for 20 min in situ. Next, the lungs were minced, filtered, and centrifuged (130 ×g). The collected cells were resuspended in DMEM and incubated for one additional hour on Petri dishes coated with rat IgG to remove macrophages by Fc-mediated adherence. The non-adherent cells were collected, centrifuged (400 × g for 10 min), and resuspended in DMEM with 10% bovine calf serum, penicillin (50,000 units/liter) and streptomycin (50 mg/liter) solution. Cells were counted using a standard hemacytometer. Freshly isolated alveolar epithelial cells (3 × 105 cells/well) were plated on 96-well tissue culture plates and incubated over 48 h (37 °C, 5% CO2), with the media being changed after the initial 24 h. A sample of cells was also stained with FITC anti-CD45 (OX-1, BD Pharmingen) and viewed under fluorescence, to ensure minimal contamination by macrophages (<5%). These AEC monolayers derived after 48 h of culture were used to study epithelial cell MIP-2 release following β-glucan stimulation. To characterize AEC responses to the PC β-glucan-rich cell wall fraction, varying concentrations (1–10 × 106 particles/ml) of the PCBG isolate were used to stimulate the alveolar epithelial cell monolayers. In preliminary studies, a concentration of (5 × 106particles/ml) was found to cause optimal cell stimulation. AECs were then stimulated, and supernatants were collected at 0, 2, 6, 12, 16, or 24 h. A MIP-2 sandwich ELISA (BIOSOURCE, Camarrilo, CA) was used to determine MIP-2 protein concentrations released into the media at the different time points. To further determine the relative potency of MIP-2 release from AECs compared with alveolar macrophages (AMS), and to exclude the possibility that residual macrophages in the AEC preparations significantly contributed to the observed MIP-2 release, identical numbers of AECs and alveolar macrophages (3 × 105 cells/well), as well as the maximal number of residual alveolar macrophages in the AEC isolates (5% AMS, equal to 1.5 × 104 cells) were stimulated with PCBG (5 × 106 particles/ml) for 24 h. MIP-2 release into the medium was again determined by ELISA. To further characterize AEC expression of MIP-2, ribonuclease protection assays (RPA) were performed to evaluate steady-state MIP-2 mRNA levels following stimulation with the P. carinii β-glucan. Rat alveolar epithelial cell monolayers (5 × 106 cells/well) were stimulated with P. carinii β-glucan (5 × 106 particles/well) for 0, 2, 6, and 24 h and MIP-2 RNA was measured by ribonuclease protection assay. To confirm our findings in primary AEC, and to further exclude the possibility that MIP-2 was derived from residual alveolar macrophages in the AEC preparations, MLE-12 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD), a transformed alveolar type II cell line, were similarly cultured with identical concentrations of P. carinii β-glucan at parallel time points. Total RNA was isolated at the end of each time point using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Ribonuclease protection assays were then performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Pharmingen Inc., San Diego, CA). Briefly, 15 μg of RNA was precipitated using ammonium acetate and ethanol. A custom cytokine template set and the T7 polymerase were used to transcribe32P-radiolabeled, antisense probes for rat MIP-2, MCP-1, IL-1α, TNFα, TNFβ, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, Il-10, IL-2, IFNγ, L32, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The radioprobes were hybridized in excess of the target RNA. At the end of the hybridization, free probe and other single-stranded RNA were digested with RNase. The RNase-protected probes were purified using chloroform/isoamyl alcohol/phenol and precipitated with ethanol. The probes were then resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer, separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Intratracheal instillation of PC β-glucan was used to evaluate the in vivo expression of MIP-2 by AECs. Sprague-Dawley rats were briefly anesthetized, the trachea was isolated through a neck incision, and 0.5 ml of P. cariniiβ-glucan-rich cell wall isolate (2 × 107particles/ml) was injected into the lungs. After 24 h, alveolar epithelial cells were isolated from the inoculated rats as described above. A sample of cells was also stained with FITC anti-CD45 (OX-1, BD Pharmingen) and viewed under fluorescence, to ensure minimal contamination by macrophages (<5%). RNA was immediately extracted from the freshly isolated AECs, and RPA were performed to determine MIP-2 mRNA levels. Because the integrin CD11b/CD18 represents a major well-characterized β-glucan receptor, we evaluated whether it was present on cultured AECs. AECs (5 × 106) were cultured over 48 h. Rat macrophages (2 × 106) were also isolated from the same animals to serve as a reference source for the CD11b integrin. The cells were extracted with octyl-thioglucoside (100 mm) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Lysates were precleared with 1 μg of goat IgG and 20 μl of Protein G-Sepharose for 30 min. Two micrograms of anti-CD11b (M-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or goat IgG was added to lysates containing 200 μg of cellular protein and incubated for 2 h. 20 μl of Protein-G Sepharose was then added to the lysates, and the mixture was incubated an additional hour. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min), washed, and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. The immunoprecipitated products were separated over a 10% Tris-HCl SDS-PAGE gel, and CD11b was detected by immunoblotting with anti-CD11b using streptavidin-biotinylated alkaline phosphatase complex detection. Recent studies indicate that lactosylceramide (CDw17) may function as an alternate β-glucan receptor mediating cellular activation (16Wakshull E. Brunke-Reese D. Lindermuth J. Fisette L. Nathans R.S. Crowley J.J. Tufts J.C. Zimmerman J. Mackin W. Adams D.S. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 41: 89-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To test this, freshly isolated AECs (3 × 105) were plated on 96-well plates and cultured for 48 h. Cells were next preincubated for 20 min with anti-CD11b, anti-CDw17, anti-asialoGM1, or isotype control mouse IgM (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), and stimulated with the PCBG (5 × 106particles/ml) for 16 h in the presence of these antibodies at the indicated concentrations. In an identical fashion, AECs were also cultured with LPS (1.0 μg/ml), an independent potent stimulant of epithelial cells. Supernatants were collected after 16 h, and MIP-2 concentrations were determined by ELISA. Cell viability was confirmed using the Cell Proliferation Kit II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). This assay measures the conversion of sodium-3′-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzenesulfonic acid hydrate (XTT) to a formazan dye through electron coupling in metabolically active mitochondria using the coupling reagentN-methyldibenzopyrazine methyl sulfate. Only metabolically active cells are capable of mediating this reaction, which is detected by absorbance of the dye at 450–500 nm. To further confirm the specificity of the antibody, in parallel experiments, anti-CDw17 was also preincubated with solubilized lactosylceramide (LacCer, 1 mg/ml) for 20 min to neutralize the antibody prior to addition to the cells. Immunohistochemistry was performed to verify that both the anti-CDw17 and the anti-asialoGM1 antibodies specifically interacted with the cultured AECs. Immunohistochemistry was also performed on AEC monolayers, which had been digested with endoglycosidase Hf (New England BioLabs, 1000 units/ml, 24 h) to remove sugar modifications of the cellular surfaces. Finally, to further exclude steric hindrance effects of the bulky IgM anti-CDw17 antibody, in additional experiments, the IgM was digested into IgG and rIgG fragments prior to use (ImmunoPure IgM fragmentation kit, Pierce Inc., Rockford, IL). We further investigated whether reduction of AEC membrane lactosylceramide would reduce MIP-2 production following β-glucan challenge. AECs (3 × 105) were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium containing lipid free fetal calf serum (Intracel, Issaquah, WA), in the presence of the glycosphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitors,N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ, 200 and 400 μm) ord-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol-HCl (PDMP, 20 μm) (28Andersson U. Butters T.D. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 29Platt F.M. Reinkensmeier G. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol.

Cells were incubated with NB-DNJ, PDMP, or lipid-free media alone for 72 h and subsequently stimulated with PC β-glucan (5 × 106 particles/ml) for 16 h. MIP-2 release was determined by ELISA. Toxicity to the AECs induced by either NB-DNJ and PDMP was again determined using the XTT viability assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To further study the effect of an independent stimulus, AECs were cultured with LPS (1.0 μg/ml), and MIP 2 release determined in the presence or absence of NB-DNJ (400 μm). All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were determined using two-tailed Student's t test. Statistical testing was performed using SPSS software program, with statistical differences considered significant if p was <0.05. AECs responded to stimulation with P. carinii β-glucan by release of the chemokine MIP-2. After 6 h of stimulation, MIP-2 production was significantly increased with concentrations of PCBG as low as 1 × 106 particles/ml, which caused 165 ± 95-fold more MIP-2 release compared with unstimulated controls (p = 0.003). The response of AECs occurred fairly rapidly after PCBG stimulation (Fig. 1 A). MIP-2 levels after PC β-glucan (5 × 106 particles/ml) stimulation were significantly increased as early as 2 h post stimulation. MIP-2 secretion was further enhanced at 6 through 24 h with maximal accumulation of MIP-2 in the media observed at 16 and 24 h. Thus, AECs respond to PCBG stimulation by release of MIP-2 in a graded time-dependent fashion. To further determine the relative potency of the AEC response to PC β-glucan compared with alveolar macrophages, equal numbers of AECs and macrophages (3 × 105 cells/well) were cultured with PC β-glucan for 24 h under identical conditions and the level of MIP-2 in the medium determined by ELISA (Fig. 1 B). Under these conditions, the AECs release 7510 ± 376 pg/ml MIP-2. In contrast, equal numbers of macrophages released only 2911 ± 532 pg/ml MIP-2 (p < 0.01). Thus, alveolar epithelial cells are a potent source of MIP-2 following challenge with thisP. carinii cell wall component. To further exclude the possibility that residual macrophages present in the AEC isolates were responsible for the MIP-2 release in response to PC β-glucan, we determined that the AEC preparations maximally contained 5% residual macrophages at the time of isolation. This number of macrophages (1.5 × 104 cells/well) was also concurrently cultured with PC β-glucan and found to release only 89 ± 117 pg/ml MIP-2 (p < 0.001 compared with the AEC isolates challenged with PCBG) (Fig. 1 B). Thus, it is unlikely that residual macrophages contributed significantly to the observed MIP-2 release in the AEC preparations. Next, ribonuclease protection assays (RPAs) were performed to determine whether glucan stimulation similarly increased MIP-2 RNA expression in primary alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. 2 A). Steady-state MIP-2 mRNA was significantly increased following 2 h of P. carinii β-glucan stimulation compared with unstimulated control. A doublet hybridization pattern was observed for MIP-2. Further increases in MIP-2 mRNA were also noted after 6 and 24 h of stimulation. The total achieved level of MIP-2 RNA expression in AECs was comparable and exceeded that elicited by 6 h of challenge with TNFα (100 ng/ml), an established stimulant of MIP-2 expression. RNA loading was verified by hybridization to the constitutively expressed L32 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes. In addition, consistent with our prior studies, RPA on primary AECs further demonstrated an increased level of TNFα and MCP-1 mRNA at both 6 and 24 h after stimulation with P. carinii β-glucan (3Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 11Hoffman O.A. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3932-3940PubMed Google Scholar). Although the AEC preparations consistently contained >95% epithelial cells, with few remaining macrophages, we further confirmed thatP. carinii β-glucan increase MIP-2 expression in MLE-12 cells, an immortalized alveolar epithelial cell line, free of any macrophage contamination (Fig. 2 B). RPA using MLE-12 cells demonstrated that MIP-2 mRNA was increased 2 and 4 h after PC β-glucan stimulation compared with controls. Interestingly, an increase in the murine chemokine TCA3 mRNA was also observed following 2 and 4 h of PCBG stimulation in MLE12 cells. The MLE12 cell line exhibited MIP-2 expression following challenge with PCBG, providing further confirmation that alveolar epithelial cells can directly respond to PCBG with release of the MIP-2 chemokine in the complete absence of macrophages. We have previously reported that PC β-glucan induces substantial neutrophilic lung inflammation and enhanced lung MIP-2 levels. Thus, we next sought to determine whether PC β-glucan similarly enhanced MIP-2 gene expression in alveolar epithelial cells following intratracheal instillation in vivo (0.5 ml containing 1 × 107 PCBG particles). Twenty-four hours following challenge, alveolar epithelial cells were isolated from the rats, and MIP-2 expression was analyzed by RPA (Fig. 3). The 24-h time point was chosen as a steady-state time point at which neutrophil recruitment and cytokine expression are well established following PC β-glucan challenge in our previous studies (3Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). MIP-2 mRNA expression was enhanced in the PC β-glucan-stimulated animals compared with control animals. Minimal basal MIP-2 RNA expression was found in the unstimulated controls. As described above, RNA was immediately isolated after the alveolar cell isolation procedure, and the AECs were not maintained in culture. Again, CD45 fluorescence immunostaining of the AEC preparations consistently confirmed less than 5% contamination with alveolar macrophages. These data demonstrate that AECs express MIP-2 mRNA following challenges in the intact host. Under such in vivoconditions epithelial cells may be acting in direct responses to PC β-glucan, but MIP-2 responses may also be related to macrophage activity, including the release of factors such as TNFα, which are known to stimulate AECs. The integrin CD11b/CD18 is present on leukocytes and initiates cell activation in response to β-glucans (12Thornton B.P. Vetvicka V. Pitman M. Goldman R.C. Ross G.D. J. Immunol. 1"
https://openalex.org/W2127327997,"Using assay-directed fractionation ofConus geographus crude venom, we isolated α-conotoxin GID, which acts selectively at neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Unlike other neuronally selective α-conotoxins, α-GID has a four amino acid N-terminal tail, γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla), and hydroxyproline (O) residues, and lacks an amidated C terminus. GID inhibits α7 and α3β2 nAChRs with IC50values of 5 and 3 nm, respectively and is at least 1000-fold less potent at the α1β1γδ, α3β4, and α4β4 combinations. GID also potently inhibits the α4β2 subtype (IC50 of 150 nm). Deletion of the N-terminal sequence (GIDΔ1–4) significantly decreased activity at the α4β2 nAChR but hardly affected potency at α3β2 and α7 nAChRs, despite enhancing the off-rates at these receptors. In contrast, Arg12 contributed to α4β2 and α7 activity but not to α3β2 activity. The three-dimensional structure of GID is well defined over residues 4–19 with a similar motif to other α-conotoxins. However, despite its influence on activity, the tail appears to be disordered in solution. Comparison of GID with other α4/7-conotoxins which possess an NN(P/O) motif in loop II, revealed a correlation between increasing length of the aliphatic side-chain in position 10 (equivalent to 13 in GID) and greater α7 versus α3β2 selectivity.

Williams M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 461-467Google Scholar). To date, eight α and three β subunits (α2–α7, α9, α10, β2–β4) of the nAChRs have been cloned from sensory and neuronal mammalian cells (2McGehee D.S. Role L.W. Annu. Rev.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3501-3506Google Scholar). For the α7 and α9 subunits, it has been shown that they need no additional subunits to form functional ion channels upon heterologous expression. All other α subunits, however, require at least the co-expression of one β subunit, or another α subunit in the case of α10. Ternary combinations of two different α and one β subunit or two different β and one α subunit, and even quaternary combinations have been described (5Colquhoun L.M. Patrick J.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2356-2362Google Scholar, 6Sivilotti L.G. McNeil D.K. Lewis T.M Nassar M.A. Schoepfer R. Colquhoun D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 500: 123-138Google Scholar). This diversity of subunit combinations has the potential to generate a wide range of receptor subtypes with different pharmacological and functional properties. To help unravel which native neuronal nAChR subunit combinations are responsible for specific physiological functions, additional selective inhibitors are required. Conotoxins are small disulfide-rich peptides from the venom of the predatory marine snails of the genus Conus. These miniproteins have proved to be valuable tools for investigating the structure and function of ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels. α-Conotoxins are competitive antagonists of acetylcholine (ACh) binding to the nAChR (7Dwoskin L.P. Crooks P.A. J. Pharmcol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 395-402Google Scholar). The α-conotoxins described so far are among the most selective inhibitors to be identified (Fig. 1). They are typically 12–18 amino acids long, contain a conserved Pro in loop I, and are folded by two disulfide bonds connecting Cys1–Cys3 and Cys2–Cys4. Based on the number of amino acids between the second and third cysteine residues (loop I) and the third and fourth cysteine residues (loop II) they are divided into α3/5, α4/7, α4/6, and α4/3 structural subfamilies (8McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Google Scholar). The α3/5-conotoxins are selective for the muscle-type nAChR, while most α4/7- and α4/6-conotoxins are selective for neuronal nAChRs. An exception is the α4/7-conotoxin EI, which binds to the α/δ interface of the muscle-type nAChR (9Martinez J.S. Olivera B.M. Gray W.R. Craig A.G. Groebe D.R. Abramson S.N. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14519-14526Google Scholar). The α4/3-type characterized by ImI is α7-selective (10Johnson D.S. Martinez J. Elgoyhen A.B. Heinemann S.F. McIntosh J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 194-199Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of different neuronal-specific and muscle-specific α-conotoxins have been determined by NMR (11Gehrmann J. Alewood P.F.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11425-11433Google Scholar). The α4/7-conotoxins and ImI share similar backbone conformations and a rigid hydrophobic core (14Rogers J.P. Luginbuhl P. Shen G.S. McCabe R.T. Stevens R.C. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3874-3882Google Scholar), suggesting that their different specificities for nAChR subtypes arise from the different amino acid side-chains projecting from this conserved scaffold. The α4β2 nAChRs together with the α7 subtype are the most abundant nAChRs in mammalian brain. Knockout studies in mice have revealed an important role for α4 and β2 in pain and cognition (20Cordero-Erausquin M. Marubio L.M. Klink R. Changeux J.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 211-217Google Scholar) but further investigations of its role are limited by the lack of α4β2-selective inhibitors. A primary goal of this study was to identify new α-conotoxins active at the α4β2 subtype. In this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of α4/7-conotoxin GID. GID possesses a novel four amino acid N-terminal tail and an Arg in position 12 that contribute to α4β2 selectivity. The NMR structure of GID was determined to define the location of structural features that contribute to the selectivity of GID. Nine specimens ofConus geographus were collected from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Crude venom duct contents were extracted with 30% acetonitrile/water acidified with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and centrifuged. Soluble material (120 mg) was lyophilized and stored at −20 °C prior to use. A portion of the crude venom extract (40 mg) was fractionated on a semipreparative RP-HPLC column (10-μm C18, Vydac) eluted at 3 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0–80% solvent B over 80 min (solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, 90% acetonitrile, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid). Inhibition in a functional nAChR assay (see below) identified an active 1-min fraction eluting at ∼21 min (Fig. 2 A), which was further purified by RP-HPLC employing a linear gradient of 0–25% B over 25 or 45 min (5-μm C18, 46 × 250 mm Zorbax or Jupiter columns at 1 ml/min or a SB300 3.5 μm C18, 2.1 × 50 mm Zorbax column at 0.2 ml/min eluted with solvent A, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, 90% acetonitrile and 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid). An active peptide detected at 214 nm was collected and sequenced after reduction and alkylation with maleimide (see below). Venom was further characterized by LC/MS analysis using a PESciex API QSTAR Pulsar mass spectrometer (m/z 500–2200) to monitor the eluant from a 5-μm C3, 2.1 × 150 mm Zorbax column eluted with 0–60% B over 60 min (A, 0.1% formic acid; B, 90% aqueous acetonitrile, 0.09% formic acid). The purified peptide (∼20 pmol) was reduced in the presence of 10 mm TCEP and 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.5 (37 °C for 1 h) before alkylating in the added presence of 20 mm maleimide (37 °C for 1 h). The alkylated peptide was repurified by RP-HPLC prior to sequence analysis by Edman chemistry on a 492–01 HT model Procise protein sequencer (see Fig. 1). Stock solutions of 100 mmTris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine hydrochloride (Pierce), and maleimide (Aldrich) were prepared in 0.1 m ammonium acetate pH 4.5 and in 10% acetonitrile, respectively, and stored at −20 °C. GID and analogues were manually assembled by Boc chemistry, deprotected, and cleaved from resin as described previously (21Schnölzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Google Scholar). Amino acid side-chain protection was as follows: Arg (Tos), Asn(Xan), Asp(OcHex), Cys(pMeBzl), Gla(OcHex), His (DNP), Hyp(Bzl), and Ser(Bzl). Linear peptides were manually assembled ont-Boc-cysteine-Pam resin, (0.75 mmol substitution/g; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Double couplings were used where necessary to achieve coupling efficiencies of >99.5%. HPLC-purified reduced peptides (50 μm) were oxidized in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate at pH 7.5–8 with stirring for 24–48 h at 23 °C. The oxidized peptides were purified by preparative RP-HPLC. The major oxidized product was co-injected with native GID in a 2:1 ratio. Peptides were quantified initially in triplicate by amino acid analysis (22Bidlingmeyer B.A. Cohen S.A. Tarvin T.L. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 336: 93-104Google Scholar), then subsequently by RP-HPLC using an external reference standard for each peptide. Plasmids containing cDNA encoding rat α3, α4, α7, β2, and β4 nAChR subunits were provided by J. Patrick (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) and subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pNKS2 (23Gloor S. Pongs O. Schmalzing G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 213-217Google Scholar). cDNAs for the mouse α1, β1, γ, and δ subunits of the muscle nAChR were provided by Dr. V. Witzemann (Max-Planck Institute for Medical Research, Heidelberg, Germany). Capped cRNAs were synthesized from linearized plasmid cDNAs using the Message Machine Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Oocytes were prepared as previously described (24Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Google Scholar), injected with 50 nl of cRNA (5–50 ng/μl), and kept at 19 °C in ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mmKCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm Hepes at pH 7.4) supplemented with 50 mg/liter of gentamycin (Sigma Chemical Co.). Two electrode voltage-clamp recordings were performed in oocytes 2–10 days after cRNA injection at a holding potential of −70 mV. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Harvard Apparatus Ltd., Kent, England) and filled with 3 m KCl. Resistances were below 1mΩ. Membrane currents were recorded using a two electrode virtual ground circuit on a GeneClamp 500B amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA), filtered at 200 Hz and digitized at 1 kHz using a Digidata 1322A interface and v8.2 Clampex software (Axon Instruments Inc.). Recordings were performed in ND96 at room temperature. 1 μm ACh (Sigma) was used to activate α4β4 and α1β1γδ nAChRs, 100 μm ACh was used to activate α3β2, α3β4, and α4β2 nAChRs, and 100 μmnicotine (Sigma) was used to activate α7 nAChR. The perfusion medium was manually switched between ND96 with or without agonist using a Valve Driver II (General Valve Corporation, Fairfield, NJ). A fast and reproducible solution exchange (<300 ms) for agonist application was achieved using a 50-μl funnel-shaped oocyte chamber combined with a fast solution flow (∼150 μl/s) fed through a custom-made manifold mounted immediately above the oocyte. ACh pulses were applied for 2 s at 6-min intervals. After each application, the cell was superfused for 1 min with agonist-free solution, and the flow was then stopped for 5 min before agonist solution was re-introduced. Peptide was applied when responses to three consecutive agonist applications differed by less than 10%. After the 1-min agonist washout step was stopped, 5.5 μl of a 10-fold concentrated peptide solution were pipetted directly into the static bath, mixed by repeated pipetting, and incubated for 5 min prior to application of agonist. Addition of toxin directly to the recording chamber conserved material and avoided potential adhesion of the toxin to tubing surfaces. To obtain estimates of potency, dose-response curves were fitted to the data by the equation percent response = 100/{1 + ([toxin]/IC50)nH} using Prism software (GraphPad v 3.0 for Macintosh, San Diego, CA). To obtain estimates of toxin washout kinetics, agonist responses were measured at 2-min intervals under constant superfusion. For toxin application, oocytes were superfused for 1 min before a 1-min incubation with the toxin followed by the next agonist application. Samples for 1H NMR measurement contained ∼2.5 mm synthetic GID in 90% H2O, 10% D2O or 100% D2O at pH 2.8. Spectra were obtained on a Bruker DMX 750 spectrometer at 280 and 287 K. All spectra were acquired in phase-sensitive mode using TPPI (25Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Google Scholar). The homonuclear spectra recorded included double quantum filtered DQF-COSY (26Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Google Scholar), TOCSY (27Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Google Scholar) using a MLEV17 spin lock sequence (28Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 56: 355-360Google Scholar) with an isotropic mixing time of 80 ms; ECOSY (29Griesinger C. Sorensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 75: 474-492Google Scholar), and NOESY (30Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Google Scholar) with mixing times of 150 and 350 ms. In DQF-COSY and ECOSY experiments, the water resonance was suppressed by low power irradiation during the relaxation delay (1.5 s). For the TOCSY and NOESY experiments, water suppression was achieved using a modified WATERGATE sequence (31Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Google Scholar). Two-dimensional spectra were generally collected over 4096 data points in the f2 dimension and 512 increments in the f1 dimension over a spectral width corresponding to 12 ppm. For identification of slowly exchanging amides, a series of one-dimensional and TOCSY spectra were run immediately after dissolving the sample in D2O. All spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics workstation using XWINNMR (Bruker). The f1 dimension was zero-filled to 2048 real data points with the f1 and f2 dimensions being multiplied by a sine-squared function shifted by 90° prior to Fourier transformation. Processed spectra were analyzed and assigned using the program XEASY (32Eccles C. Guntert P. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1991; 1: 111-130Google Scholar). Spectra were assigned using the sequential assignment protocol (33Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986Google Scholar). The process was facilitated, in part, using the automatic assignment program NOAH, which is part of the DYANA package (34Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Google Scholar). Cross-peaks in NOESY spectra recorded in 90% H2O, 10% D2O with mixing times of 350 and 150 ms were integrated and calibrated in XEASY, and distance constraints were derived using DYANA. Backbone dihedral angle restraints were derived from3 J HNHα coupling constants measured from line shape analysis of antiphase cross-peak splitting in the DQF-COSY spectrum. Angles were restrained to −120° ± 30 for3 J HNHα > 8.5 Hz and to −60° ± 30 for 3 J HNHα < 5 Hz. Stereospecific assignments of β-methylene protons and χ1 dihedral angles were derived from 3 Jαβ coupling constants, measured from ECOSY spectra, in combination with NOE peak intensities (35Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (:29–32): 51-55Google Scholar). Slowly exchanging amide protons identified by D2O exchange experiments were used in conjunction with preliminary structures to determine hydrogen bonds. In cases where hydrogen bonds could be determined and unambiguously assigned, appropriate distance restraints were included in the subsequent calculations. Preliminary structures were calculated using a torsion angle simulated annealing protocol within DYANA. Final structures were calculated using simulated annealing and energy minimization protocols within CNS version 1.0 (36Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Rice L.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 325-336Google Scholar). The starting structures were generated using random φ, ψ dihedral angles and energy-minimized to produce structures with the correct local geometry. A set of 50 structures was generated by a torsion angle simulated annealing protocol (37Rice L.M. Brünger A.T. Proteins. 1994; 19: 277-290Google Scholar, 38Stein E.G. Rice L.M. Brünger A.T. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 124: 154-164Google Scholar). This protocol involves a high temperature phase comprising 4000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics, a cooling phase with 4000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics during which the temperature was lowered to 0 K, and finally an energy minimization phase comprising 5000 steps of Powell minimization. Structures consistent with restraints were subjected to further molecular dynamics and energy minimization in a water shell, as described by Linge and Nilges (39Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Google Scholar). The refinement in explicit water involves the following steps. First heating to 500 K via steps of 100 K, each comprising 50 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics. Second, 2500 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics at 500 K before a cooling phase where the temperature was lowered in steps of 100 K, each comprising 2500 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics. Finally, the structures were minimized with 2000 steps of Powell minimization. Structures were analyzed using Promotif and Procheck (40Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Google Scholar, 41Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Google Scholar). In the search for new α-conotoxins, the crude venom of C. geographus was screened for inhibition of agonist-evoked currents at muscle nAChR and different combinations of neuronal nAChR subunits (α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, α4β4, and α7) heterologously expressed inXenopus oocytes. Crude venom (50 μg protein/ml by BCA assay) caused 100% block of the α3β2 and α7 nAChR subtypes and had weak activity at α4β2. LC/MS analysis of the crude venom, and MS analysis of individual fractions, confirmed the presence of the known muscle selective α-conotoxins GI, GIA, and GIB, while GII and the neuronally active GIC were not found (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus this pool of C. geographus crude venom appeared to contain a novel neuronally active α-conotoxin. Inhibitory activity at the α3β2 and α7 subtypes was used to guide fractionations of the crude venom, yielding a single component of 2184.9 Da (Fig. 2,A and B) that inhibited α3β2, α7, and α4β2 nAChR subtypes. Edman sequencing of the reduced and alkylated peptide, together with mass spectrometry evidence for the γ-carboxyglutamic acid (γ), revealed a new α4/7-conotoxin sequence IRDγCCSNPACRVNNOHVC (Fig. 1), that we named α-GID following the nomenclature proposed by Olivera and co-workers (8McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Google Scholar). The identical sequence was also identified in Conus tulipa crude venom. 2L. Thomas and R. J. Lewis, unpublished data. GID possesses an NN(P/O) motif also found in α-conotoxins EpI, PnIA, and PnIB (Fig. 1 A) but additionally has a four residue N-terminal tail. GID is the first non-amidated, neuronally active α-conotoxin identified. To characterize GID and investigate the influence of the N-terminal tail on its functional properties, GID and an analogue missing the four N-terminal amino acids (GIDΔ1–4) were synthesized (Fig. 1 B). A single point mutant, [R12A]GID, was also synthesized to investigate the influence of the unusual charged residue in this position on nAChR selectivity. All peptides were purified to >95% purity determined by HPLC and MS analysis. Oxidized synthetic GID co-eluted with native GID on reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 2 C), and both peptides had identical masses (monoisotopic masses: observed native, 2184.9; observed synthetic, 2184.9; theoretical, 2184.9). Both native and synthetic GID blocked α3β2 and α7 nAChRs receptors expressed inXenopus oocytes with equal potency (data not shown). Synthetic GID was used in further experiments to determine the potency and subtype selectivity of GID at neuronal α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, α4β4, and α7, and muscle α1β2γδ nAChRs expressed in oocytes. The concentration response curves for GID are shown in Fig. 4 A, and IC50 values and Hill slope coefficients are summarized in TableI. GID was most potent at α3β2 and α7 nAChR subtypes, with IC50 values of 3 and 5 nm, respectively (Fig. 3 A). The activity at the α3β4, α4β4, and muscle nAChRs was at least 1000-fold less. This potency and selectivity profile of GID is somewhat reminiscent of α-conotoxin PnIA and [A10L]PnIA (42Hogg R.C. Miranda L.P. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. J. Biol.

In contrast to these peptides, however, GID also showed activity at the α4β2 subtype (IC50 150 nm). Despite several sequence similarities in the second loop, no α4β2 activity was found for [A10L]PnIA (42Hogg R.C. Miranda L.P. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. J. Biol.

To identify which structural determinants contribute to GID selectivity, the roles of the N-terminal tail and the basic residue Arg12 were investigated. Deletion of the four N-terminal amino acids of GID reduced the activity of the peptide at the α4β2 combination by ∼4-fold (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, GIDΔ1–4 (1–10 μm) caused only a partial block (∼40%) of α4β2 receptors, indicating that the tail of GID was required for full antagonist activity at this subtype combination (no partial agonist activity was detected with this truncated analogue, data not shown). However, potency at the α7 and α3β2 subtypes was little influenced by removal of the four N-terminal residues. Activity of [R12A]GID at the α4β2 and α7 subtype was reduced ∼10-fold compared with GID, whereas activity at the α3β2 subtype was little affected (Fig. 3, B–D). An analogue in which the four N-terminal amino acid residues of [R12A]GID were removed ([R12A]GIDΔ1–4) did not cause any inhibition of the α4β2 receptor at 3 μm (data not shown). Inhibition of the α4β2 nAChR by GID and its analogues was rapidly reversible, with at least 90% recovery of responses seen after 2 min (data not shown). However, recovery of the α3β2 and α7 subtypes from GID block was significantly slower, requiring 10 and 15 min, respectively (Fig. 4, A and C). In contrast, inhibition of both α3β2 and α7 receptors by GIDΔ1–4 was reversed after a <2-min washout (Fig. 4, B andD). Recovery from block by [A10L]PnIA, which does not have an N-terminal tail, was rapid at the α3β2 subtype but slow at the α7 subtype (data not shown). All spectral data on GID were recorded in either 90% H2O, 10% D2O or 100% D2O. Spectra recorded at 287 K were primarily used for assignments, while spectra measured at other temperatures were used to resolve ambiguities. Analysis of the 350-ms NOESY spectrum (750 MHz, 287 K) using the program XEASY allowed the assignment of each spin system to a specific amino acid. All non-intraresidual peaks were subsequently assigned both manually and using the NOAH automatic assignment within the DYANA program package. Interproton distance restraints were derived from the NOE intensities and used in structure calculations using a torsion angle simulated annealing protocol within DYANA. Preliminary structures were analyzed to resolve spectral ambiguities and to facilitate the introduction of new restraints. A set of restraints consisting of 183 NOE-derived distances and 15 dihedral angle restraints was used in the final calculations. These restraints included 82 sequential, 35 medium range, 10 long range, and 56 intraresidue distances, 6 φ angle restraints (Cys5, Cys6, Arg12, Val3, His17, and Cys19), and 9 χ1 angle restraints (Cys5, Cys6, Asn8, Cys11, Val13, Asn14, His17, Val18, and Cys19). Side-chain angle restraints were derived on the basis of coupling constants and NOE intensities from a 150 ms NOESY spectrum. There were also four restraints included for two hydrogen bonds identified in preliminary structures. In the final round of structure calculations, these restraints were used to calculate a family of 50 structures, using a torsion angle simulated annealing (37Rice L.M. Brünger A.T. Proteins. 1994; 19: 277-290Google Scholar, 38Stein E.G. Rice L.M. Brünger A.T. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 124: 154-164Google Scholar) protocol within CNS version 1.0 (36Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Rice L.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 325-336Google Scholar). Structures consistent with the restraints were subjected to further molecular dynamics and energy minimization in a water shell. The differences between the Hα chemical shifts of GID and random coil values (44Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Google Scholar) are shown in Fig. 5. A negative secondary shift (upfield) for several residues indicates that GID contains helical structural elements. The longest uninterrupted region of negative secondary shifts is observed for residues 9–13, suggesting that this region forms a well-defined helix. The amino acid sequence of GID includes four cysteine residues that are involved in two disulfide bonds. Initially, the connectivities of the disulfide bonds were unknown but were assumed to be identical to PnIA on the basis of sequence similarities. Thus, the pairing of the disulfides was assumed to be 5–11 and 6–19 (the globular conformation). To test the validity of this assumption, in addition to calculations with the globular connectivity, structures were calculated with the other two possible disulfide connectivities, 5–6, 11–19 (beads conformation), and 5–19, 6–11 (ribbon conformation). The resultant structures for the beads and ribbon isomers clearly violated the experimental data with the average target"

Exposing cells to a weak base such as primaquine increases the pool of internalized D3, suggesting that D3 is recycled between plasma membrane and early endosomes. Such recycling could account for the much longer half-life of D3 (12 h) than the thyroxine activating members of the selenodeiodinase family, type 1 (D1; 8 h) or type 2 (D2; 2 h) deiodinase.

Its role is to synthesize and secrete polyiodinated thyronine molecules that modulate gene expression in virtually every vertebrate tissue through ligand-dependent transcription factors. Thyroxine (T4)1 is the primary product of thyroid secretion, a pro-hormone that must be activated by deiodination to 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3) by either type 1 or 2 iodothyronine deiodinases (D1 or D2) in order to initiate thyroid action. To balance the activation pathway, both T4 and T3 are irreversibly inactivated by monodeiodination of the tyrosyl ring of the iodothyronines, a reaction catalyzed by the type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase (D3). These three enzymes constitute a family of selenocysteine (Sec)-containing integral membrane oxidoreductases (1Bianco A.C. Salvatore D. Gereben B. Berry M.J. Larsen P.R. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 38-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Changes in the activity of D3 modulate both global and local tissue thyroid status. In the global sense, D3 expression is increased by T3 and reduced in hypothyroidism or iodine deficiency, thus accelerating or retarding T3 inactivation to maintain homeostasis (2St. Germain D.L. Schwartzman R.A. Croteau W. Kanamori A. Wang Z. Brown D.D. Galton V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7767-7771Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 3Tu H.M. Legradi G. Bartha T.

Hiebert A. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6Berry D.L. Rose C.S. Remo B.F. Brown D.D. Dev.

A. 1999; 96: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). More complex are the alterations in D3 activity in specific tissues dictated by developmental programs that permit precisely timed changes in their differentiation. For example, during metamorphosis inXenopus laevis tadpoles, the eyes must shift from a lateral to a more rostral and dorsal location to permit overlapping visual fields. Retinal cells follow this shift with an asymmetrical growth, a process that is thyroid hormone-dependent. To develop asymmetrically, however, a subset of dorsal cells must grow at a slower rate. This is achieved by an increase in D3 expression in these cells, thus producing transient local hypothyroidism (8Marsh-Armstrong N. Huang H. Remo B.F. Liu T.T. Brown D.D. Neuron. 1999; 24: 871-878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Whereas D3 thus serves an essential physiological role, its inappropriate overexpression in large hemangiomas has recently been shown to cause a unique clinical syndrome termed consumptive hypothyroidism. This occurs in infants (and rarely in adults) when D3-catalyzed inactivation of T3 and T4 occurs more rapidly than maximum thyroidal production (9Huang S.A., Tu, H.M. Harney J.W. Venihaki M.

(2003) J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,in pressGoogle Scholar). Understanding the cellular biology of D3 can shed light on its function, the potential physiological cofactors, and the mechanisms regulating its degradation. The two T4-activating enzymes, D1 and D2, are also integral membrane proteins. Whereas D1 is located in the plasma membrane (PM), D2 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein (12Baqui M.M. Gereben B. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Bianco A.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4309-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Nothing is known about D3 other than it is an integral membrane protein with a putative transmembrane domain near the NH2 terminus (reviewed in Ref. 1Bianco A.C. Salvatore D. Gereben B. Berry M.J. Larsen P.R. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 38-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that D3 is primarily in the PM with most of its molecule in the extracellular space. The human D3 cysteine (Cys) mutant (CysD3) was generated by replacing Sec144 with Cys using overlap extension PCR. The CysD3 carboxyl FLAG construct (D3C-FLAG) was engineered in a D10 vector fusing the epitope by anEcoRI/XbaI-based strategy as described previously for D1 and D2. These carboxyl FLAG D1 and D2 constructs (D1C-FLAG and D2C-FLAG) encode full-length Cys mutant deiodinases fused to the FLAG peptide at the COOH terminus (12Baqui M.M. Gereben B. Harney J.W.

Human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) or mouse Neuro2A neuroblastoma cells (NB-2A) were transfected along with TKGH to monitor transfection efficiency as described and were used ∼48 h later.

Bianco A.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4309-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with D3C-FLAG and processed in two different ways. (i) Paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were permeabilized either with digitonin (25–50 μm) or acetone as indicated, followed by incubation with primary antibodies, as indicated, for 1 h at room temperature (RT), rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% BSA (PBS/BSA), and incubated for 30 min with the appropriate species-specific secondary antibodies. (ii) Non-permeabilized cells were washed twice with cold PBS and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with mouse anti-FLAG (1:100) and rabbit anti-D3-18 (1:80) antibodies diluted in cold DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were then fixed and blocked with PBS/BSA containing 1% goat serum and incubated with secondary antibodies as above (17Canfield V.A. Norbeck L. Levenson R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14165-14172Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In all studies, the slides were mounted in Vectashield® mounting medium with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and examined by conventional confocal microscopy on a Bio-Rad MCR-1024/2P system interfaced with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. For cell surface biotinylation, HEK-293 cells transiently expressing FLAG-tagged deiodinases were washed twice with cold PBS containing 1 mmMgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2(PBS2+) and incubated for two 20-min periods at 4 °C with 1.0 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (sulfo-biotin; Pierce) diluted in PBS2+. They were then quenched twice for 20 min (4 °C) with 100 mm glycine in PBS. For intracellular biotinylation, cells were probed for 30 min at room temperature with 1 mg/ml biocytin (Pierce) in PBS and then washed 3 times with PBS2+ containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol. After either method of biotinylation, cells were harvested and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer-2 (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mmMgCl2) containing 1,000 units of DNase (Promega, Madison, WI), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1× protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min (4 °C) and the supernatant incubated for 2 h with streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer-2 containing 500 mm NaCl, twice with the lysis buffer-2, and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and finally the complexes were processed for Western analysis with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:3000). In some experiments, as indicated, cells were first treated at 37 °C with DMEM containing 0.3 m sucrose for 15 min to inhibit the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway (18Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) or with 10 mmmethyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) for 30 min (19Park H., Go, Y.M., St John P.L. Maland M.C. Lisanti M.P.

HEK-293 cells transfected with D3C-FLAG or D10 vector were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with methionine (Met)- and Cys-free DMEM and then labeled with ∼120 μCi/plate of [35S]Met/-Cys labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 20–180 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS and processed as indicated separately for each experiment. Pulse-chases were performed with complete DMEM containing 10% FBS for 1–20 h. HEK-293 cells transiently expressing D3C-FLAG or D10 vector were metabolically labeled and processed for in vivo IP as described elsewhere (20Burke B. Matlin K. Bause E. Legler G. Peyrieras N. Ploegh H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Some cells were treated with 10 mm MβCD during the last 30 min of the labeling phase. The cells were then washed with cold buffer A (PBS containing 1% BSA and 10 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgG) for 20 min followed by incubation on ice with the biotinylated anti-FLAG antibody (1:300) diluted in buffer A for 30 min. Cells were then washed once with buffer A and twice with buffer A containing 5% FBS, harvested, and lysed with lysis buffer. The streptavidin-agarose beads were added to the solubilized fraction, and immune complexes were pelleted by brief centrifugation. Samples were resolved by 4–15% SDS-PAGE and processed for autoradiography. HEK-293 cells transiently expressing D3C-FLAG were cell surface-biotinylated with 2.0 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin in PBS2+ for 60 min (4 °C) followed by incubation for 5–10 min at 37 °C with DMEM containing 10% FBS to allow internalization of biotinylated proteins (21Turvy D.N. Blum J.S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 212: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similarly treated cells were incubated with 0.3 mm primaquine in DMEM with 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, to inhibit the recycling limb of the endocytic pathway (22Schwartz A.L. Bolognesi A. Fridovich S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS2+ and the extracellular biotinylated proteins were freed of biotin by treatment with 50 mm reduced GSH solution and processed for streptavidin-agarose beads pull-down and Western analysis using FLAG M2 antibody (1:3000). NCLP-6E monkey hepatocarcinoma cells express high level of endogenous D3 (23Sorimachi K. Robbins J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 542: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These cells were acetone-treated and processed for IF with primary antibody D3-18, and the images show a pattern in the periphery of these cells suggesting a plasma membrane location (Fig. 1 A, a andb). To analyze the cellular expression of this enzyme under controlled conditions using highly specific monoclonal antibody, we prepared a plasmid containing a recombinant human D3 protein tagged with FLAG at its COOH terminus (D3C-FLAG). Because of the inefficient translation of selenoproteins in general, the Sec residue at position 144 was replaced with Cys, and the protein was transiently expressed in various cell types. This D3 retains the capacity to convert T3 to 3,3′-diiodothyronine (T2) in a saturable fashion with a K m of ∼150 nm(not shown). Western analysis of cytosolic and Na2CO3 (pH 11)-washed microsomal fractions of D3C-FLAG-expressing HEK-293 cells using anti-FLAG and a primary antibody (D3-18) revealed an identical band of the predicted size (33 kDa) only in the microsomal fraction of the cell lysate (Fig. 1 B). D3C-FLAG-expressing HEK-293 (Fig. 1 A, c andd) and NB-2A (Fig. 1 A, e andf) cells were processed for IF using anti-FLAG M2 antibody and analyzed by confocal microscopy. D3 is distributed in the periphery, confirming a PM location. The similar IF staining pattern in the periphery to that in the NCLP-6E cells that constitutively express wild type Sec-containing D3 (Fig. 1 A, a andb) validates the use of the FLAG-tagged Cys D3 mutant in these studies. To determine whether the D3 was also expressed in the ER membrane, we exposed D3C-FLAG-expressing HEK-293 cells to 25 μmdigitonin to permeabilize the PM but not the ER (12Baqui M.M. Gereben B. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Bianco A.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4309-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). D3 staining with anti-FLAG M2 antibody was present only at the cell periphery (Fig. 2 A, a andb), not different from the pattern in acetone-treated cells. To analyze further for D3 expression in the ER membrane, both HEK-293 and NB-2A cells transiently expressing D3C-FLAG were co-stained with anti-FLAG M2 and anti-BiP, an ER-specific marker. The D3 signal was clearly distinct from that of the ER marker (Fig. 2 A,c and d). Similar findings were obtained with another ER-specific marker, calnexin (not shown). To confirm PM localization, HEK-293 cells transiently expressing D3C-FLAG were co-stained anti-Na,K-ATPase α antibody, a typical PM marker (Fig. 2 B, a–d). The confocal analysis indicates that a substantial fraction of transiently expressed D3 co-localizes with the Na,K-ATPase PM staining (Fig. 2 B,c–f). The primary anti-D3 antibody (D3-18) is directed against residues 53–68, just COOH-terminal to the predicted transmembrane domain of D3 (residues 16–41). To confirm co-localization of the COOH-terminal FLAG epitope and this peptide, non-permeabilized HEK-293 cells transiently expressing D3C-FLAG were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 and anti-D3-18 antibodies, fixed, and then stained with secondary antibodies. Both antibodies detected D3 on the surface of the transfected cells, and confocal analysis confirmed their co-localization in the extracellular space (Fig. 3 A). By using the same antibodies, acetone-permeabilized D3-expressing cells also showed a similar co-localization (Fig. 3 B). An independent approach was used to demonstrate the presence of D3 in the PM of transfected HEK-293 cells. These were subjected to cell surface biotinylation with the cell-impermeant sulfo-biotin probe (see “Materials and Methods”). Cells were lysed with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and the biotinylated proteins isolated with streptavidin-agarose beads. Western analysis with anti-FLAG M2 antibody showed a D3 band, confirming the presence of biotinylated D3C-FLAG (Fig. 3 C). As controls we employed HEK-293 cells transiently expressing D1C-FLAG or D2C-FLAG, as they are located in PM and ER, respectively (12Baqui M.M. Gereben B. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Bianco A.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4309-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). D1C-FLAG was also biotinylated by the cell-impermeant reagent, whereas D2C-FLAG was not (Fig. 3 C). However, D2 could be biotinylated with biocytin, a cell membrane-permeable probe, indicating it was present but not accessible to sulfo-biotin (Fig. 3 C). The chronology of D3 appearance in the PM was determined by combining [35S]Met/-Cys metabolic labeling with cell surface biotinylation of D3C-FLAG-expressing HEK-293 cells (see “Materials and Methods”) (24Hunziker W. Harter C. Matter K. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 66: 907-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). At various times after cells were chased with unlabeled amino acids and surface-biotinylated, [35S]Met/-Cys-labeled D3C-FLAG was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody and the PM D3 pool isolated on streptavidin-agarose beads (Fig. 3 D). It is notable that at all time points the biotinylated (PM) D3 signal is at least 10-fold less intense than that of the total lysate D3, indicating the presence of a substantial pool of intracellular D3. However, the PM D3 signal was most intense at 4–6 h relative to earlier or later times (Fig. 3 D), indicating that previously synthesized D3 continues to enter and exit the PM and that D3 is a relatively stable protein. The D3 half-life was ∼12 h by pulse-chase analysis (Fig. 3 E) as compared with the shorter half-lives of D1C-FLAG and D2-C-FLAG proteins (∼7 and ∼2 h, respectively) (Fig. 3, F andG). Most proteins in the PM undergo internalization through the endocytic pathway. To determine whether this is the case for D3, we exposed HEK-293 cells transiently expressing D3C-FLAG to either hypertonic media (0.3 msucrose), a procedure that inhibits receptor-mediated endocytosis by preventing the formation of clathrin-coated pits (18Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), or to 10 mm MβCD, which extracts cholesterol from the PM and inhibits both caveolin- and clathrin-dependent endocytosis (25Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 26Ohtani Y. Irie T. Uekama K. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 27Klein U. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13784-13793Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 28Subtil A.

After incubation, cells were exposed to sulfo-biotin and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Both treatments markedly and specifically increased the PM D3 while not affecting cell permeability, as demonstrated by the absence of D2 biotinylation in similarly treated cells (Fig. 4, A and B) and trypan blue staining (not shown). The D3 internalization was also investigated by immuno-analysis of PM D3 in intact [35S]Met/-Cys pulse-labeled cells with or without MβCD (20Burke B. Matlin K. Bause E. Legler G. Peyrieras N. Ploegh H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These were incubated with biotinylated anti-FLAG antibody, lysed, isolated on streptavidin agarose beads, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Consistent with the direct biotinylation experiments, MβCD-sensitive [35S]Met/-Cys-labeled D3C-FLAG was clearly present in much higher quantity on the surface of MβCD-exposed than in control cells (Fig. 4 C). The D3 endocytic pathway is likely to include internalization via a clathrin-dependent mechanism because in addition to the sensitivity to hypertonic medium (Fig. 4, A–C), confocal analyses indicate co-localization of D3C-FLAG with clathrin (Fig. 4 D, c and d). Evidence of D3 recycling was obtained using an assay that utilizes cell surface biotinylation with a glutathione-sensitive (cleavable) biotinylation reagent (see “Materials and Methods”) (21Turvy D.N. Blum J.S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 212: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After biotinylation of D3C-FLAG-expressing cells at 4 °C, cells were re-warmed at 37 °C to allow internalization of biotin-tagged cell surface proteins. At the indicated times, the HS-biotin moiety was cleaved from non-internalized cell surface D3 by exposure to 50 mm GSH. The cell lysates were subjected to streptavidin pull-down and Western analysis. At zero time all the biotinylated D3 is sensitive to GSH and is therefore on the cell surface (Fig. 4 E). After 5 min of re-warming, biotinylated D3 is present inside the cells as indicated by its resistance to GSH treatment. Longer incubation times did not result in greater biotinylated D3 accumulation inside the cells, which could be due to recycling of the internalized, biotinylated D3 to the cell surface. Consistent with this explanation, when cells were re-warmed in the presence of 0.3 m primaquine, a weak base that reduces the rate of return of endosomal proteins to the cell surface (22Schwartz A.L. Bolognesi A. Fridovich S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the pool of internalized (GSH-resistant) biotinylated D3 was increased (Fig. 4 E). Exposure of cells to the D3 substrate, T3, had no effect on the ratio of biotinylated PM D3 to the total Triton X-100-soluble cell D3. The fate of the internalized D3 was determined by specific confocal IF analysis in cells stained with antibody to early endosomes antigen-1 (EEA-1) (Fig. 5 c). The merged images show the extensive co-localization of D3 and EEA-1 (Fig. 5 d). This indicates that most D3 does not follow the endocytic pathway to late endosomes and lysosomes but accumulates in the early endosomes where a short-loop recycling can occur. The present studies are the first to describe the cellular biology of D3, a critical component of the thyroid hormone inactivation pathway. Both endogenous D3 in NCLP-6E cells and D3 transiently expressed in embryonic kidney or neuroblastoma cells are found at the cell periphery (Fig. 1). Curiously, however, only a fraction of D3 is in the PM at any point in time, the remainder is localized just internal to this (Figs. 2, A and B, and5 b). This is illustrated clearly in the comparison between the staining of Na,K-ATPase α and D3 (Fig. 2 B) which show co-localization of only a portion of the D3 with the membrane marker. D3 is external to the ER compartment, and much of it co-localizes with clathrin or EEA-1, an early endosomal marker (Figs. 4 D and5 d). Positive staining of intact cells with antibodies directed against residues 53–68 or the COOH-terminal FLAG epitope and biotinylation of the protein by an impermeant probe confirm the presence of both epitopes in the extracellular space (Figs.3 C and 4, A–C). Thus, circulating iodothyronines are exposed to D3 but not to D2, which is present only in the ER, as is re-confirmed in the present investigation (Fig. 3 C) (12Baqui M.M. Gereben B. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Bianco A.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4309-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Whereas both D1 and D3 are present in the PM, previous topological studies of D1 indicated it had a type 1 membrane protein orientation, with the COOH terminus and the catalytic center of the protein remaining in the cytosol as D1 is incorporated into the PM (29Toyoda N. Berry M.J. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12310-12318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Like D1, D3 contains a single predicted highly conserved transmembrane domain between residues 16 and 41. All five different algorithms used predict that the COOH-terminal portion of newly synthesized D3 is in the ER compartment, although the COOH-terminal portion of newly synthesized D1 is in the cytosol (29Toyoda N. Berry M.J. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12310-12318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). If there is only a single transmembrane domain and the catalytic center is extracellular, it would give ready access of plasma T4 and T3 to this inactivating enzyme. This is consistent with the role of D3 in the placenta, uterus, and fetal liver to block entry of maternal thyroid hormone to the fetus (reviewed in Ref. 1Bianco A.C. Salvatore D. Gereben B. Berry M.J. Larsen P.R. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 38-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) and also the capacity of the overexpressed enzyme in infantile hemangioma cells to increase thyroid hormone inactivation rates up to 9-fold (9Huang S.A., Tu, H.M. Harney J.W. Venihaki M. Butte A.J. Kozakewich H.P. Fishman S.J. Larsen P.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The presence of D3 in the PM can explain another aspect of the inactivation pathway. In some species, such as amphibians, D1 is not expressed, and in fact, it is also not expressed in human cerebral cortex despite its presence in human liver and kidney (30Campos-Barros A. Hoell T. Musa A. Sampaolo S. Stoltenburg G. Pinna G. Eravci M. Meinhold H. Baumgartner A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2179-2185PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the balance between T4 activation by D2 and inactivation by D3 is what determines the concentration of T3 in the nuclei of such tissues. It is not yet certain whether D2 and D3 are expressed in the same or different cells in the brain (1Bianco A.C. Salvatore D. Gereben B. Berry M.J. Larsen P.R. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 38-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). If both are in the same cell, the differential subcellular localization would still allow for preferential access of D2-generated T3 to the cell nucleus. The D3 in D2-expressing cells would then act to limit the availability of the pro-hormone T4, deiodinating it to reverse T3, rather than inactivating T3 produced at the ER membrane. The rapid accumulation of biotinylated D3 in the PM in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors (Fig. 4, A–C) argues that D3-containing PM regions are normally internalized, becoming part of an endosomal vesicle. These vesicles seem to be predominantly clathrin-coated as there is extensive co-localization of D3 and clathrin (Fig. 4 D) and minimal co-localization of D3 and caveolin-1 (not shown). This suggests that during endocytosis, internalized D3 is selected for recycling back to the cell surface. This is supported by the data in the internalization assay in which biotinylated D3 was retained within the cells exposed to primaquine, a potent inhibitor of membrane transport from endosomes to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 E) (22Schwartz A.L. Bolognesi A. Fridovich S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This is the first demonstration that a deiodinase undergoes endocytosis, a phenomenon that could have important biological and physiological consequences for D3 activity. For example, the presence of D3 in early endosomes (Fig. 5) suggests that only a minute fraction of internalized D3 progresses to late endosomes and to lysosomal proteolysis, explaining the long half-life. In fact, the D3 half-life is ∼12 h, a figure that contrasts with the short half-life of D2 (∼2 h), the critical ER-resident T3-producing deiodinase (Fig. 3, E–G). This suggests that the short term adaptation of thyroid status to reduced T4 production during iodine deficiency or hypothyroidism is due primarily to post-translational up-regulation of D2 and not to a rapid decrease in global D3-mediated thyroid hormone degradation, characteristic of chronic iodine deficiency (1Bianco A.C. Salvatore D. Gereben B. Berry M.J. Larsen P.R. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 38-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the substantial quantity of potentially recyclable D3 in the early endosomal pool raises the possibility that an appropriate signal such as starvation or illness could lead to its rapid relocation to the cell surface with a consequent acute inactivation of circulating T4 and T3 (1Bianco A.C. Salvatore D. Gereben B. Berry M.J. Larsen P.R. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 38-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). During the deiodination reaction the selenol in the active center of the enzyme participates in the nucleophilic attack during which it is oxidized, resulting in transient enzyme inactivation until it is reduced by an as yet unidentified co-factor. The extracellular compartment is known to be an oxidizing environment, making it difficult to reduce the active center after catalysis. Because it has been suggested that a reducing environment is present in the prelysosomal compartment (endosomes) (31Shen W. Ryser H. LaManna L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10905-10908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), D3 recycling could constitute a mechanism for D3 re-activation. Our preliminary studies do not show any acute effect of T3 on D3 partitioning within the Triton X-100 soluble pool. However, other stimuli have not been explored. In conclusion, the present studies show that newly synthesized D3 migrates to the plasma membrane and rapidly undergoes endocytosis to the early endosomal pool, possibly recycling back to the plasma membrane. The signals controlling D3 partition between these two pools are not known, although this process may facilitate regeneration of the selenium-containing active center of the enzyme. The topological studies suggest that the catalytic portion of D3 is extracellular in agreement with the theoretical predictions from the primary amino acid sequence. An active center in the extracellular space would allow D3 ready access to inactivate both the active thyroid hormone T3 and the prohormone T4 in both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Recent IF studies have localized D3 in the endothelial cells of human hemangiomas (10Huang H. Fish S.A. Dorfman D.M. Salvatore D. Kozakewich H.P. Mandel S.J. Larsen P.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 4457-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), placenta, umbilical cord, and uterus (11Huang, H., Dorfman, D. M., Genest, D. R., Salvatore, D., and Larsen, P. R. (2003) J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,in pressGoogle Scholar). In addition D3 in the human fetus is expressed in all the epithelial surfaces in contact with amniotic fluid including the skin, bronchial and intestinal epithelia, and amnion syncytio and cytotrophoblast of the placentas. Its position on the PM of these cells would facilitate its putative role to block uncontrolled access of maternal thyroid hormone to the fetus."
https://openalex.org/W2047143821,"Survivin, one of the most tumor-specific gene products, has been implicated in both anti-apoptosis and cytokinesis. However, the mechanism by which survivin regulates these two different processes is still elusive. Here, we show that survivin binds to the catalytic domain of Aurora-B. We demonstrate that in the presence of survivin, Aurora-B phosphorylates histone H3 much more efficiently than in the absence of survivin in a cell-free system. Furthermore, we confirm that cells lacking survivin due to survivin antisense oligonucleotide-treatment have lower Aurora-B kinase activity, whereas cells overexpressing survivin have higher Aurora-B kinase activity. We also provide evidence that depletion of survivin by survivin antisense oligonucleotide treatment causes significant reduction of endogenous phosphorylated histone H3 and mislocalization of Aurora-B. These results indicate that survivin stimulates Aurora-B kinase activity and helps correctly target Aurora-B to its substrates during the cell cycle, thus providing a mechanism as to how survivin exerts its function in human cells.

The functions of these two genes are unrelated, and survivin has quickly attracted much attention because it is overexpressed in most cancer cells but not in adjacent normal tissues (1Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nature Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis suggests that survivin contains a domain shared by members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP)1 gene family. The IAP family proteins were first identified in baculovirus and all of them contain variable number of baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains (2Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). Several human and Drosophila IAPs inhibit apoptosis by directly binding and potently inhibiting caspases (2Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). However, the evidence for survivin directly inhibiting caspases remains controversial (3Verdecia M.A. Huang H.

Nevertheless, overexpression of survivin provides a survival advantage for cells undergoing interleukin-3 withdrawal, treatment with Fas, or treatment with chemotherapeutics (1Ambrosini G. Adida C.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5315-5320PubMed Google Scholar). In normal cells, the expression of survivin is limited to the mitotic stage of the cell cycle. Recent studies suggest that survivin plays an essential role in cytokinesis (5Reed J.C. Bischoff J.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 545-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of survivin in HeLa cells by antisense oligonucleotides leads to cytokinesis defects (6Li F. Ackermann E.J. Bennett C.F. Rothermel A.L. Plescia J. Tognin S. Villa A. Marchisio P.C.

Both immunostaining of endogenous survivin and ectopic expression of green fluorescent protein-tagged survivin have shown that survivin is sequentially colocalized with Aurora-B and the inner centromere protein, INCENP, to the centromeres, the spindle midzone, and then to the cleavage furrow during mitosis, a typical behavior of chromosomal passenger proteins (7Chen J.

The genetic evidence for the functional interaction among survivin, Aurora-B kinase, and INCENP comes from gene knock-out studies (10Uren A.G. Wong L. Pakusch M. Fowler K.J. Burrows F.J. Vaux D.L.

Survivin knock-out embryos are polyploid and show disrupted microtubule formation resulting in lethality at embryonic day 4.5. This phenotype was remarkably similar to that seen in INCENP knock-out mice (11Cutts S.M. Fowler K.J. Kile B.T. Hii L.L. O'Dowd R.A. Hudson D.F. Saffery R. Kalitsis P. Earle E. Choo K.H. Hum. Mol.

In budding yeast, mutants of the orthologs of survivin (Bir1p), Aurora-B (Ipl1p), and INCENP (Sli15) shown similar defects in chromosome segregation (12Uren A.G. Beilharz T. O'Connell M.J.

Moreover, overexpression of Ark1p, a fission yeast ortholog of Aurora-B, can rescue the defects associated with a Bir1p mutant (14Leverson J.D. Huang H.K. Forsburg S.L. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1132-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), indicating that yeast ortholog of Aurora-B and survivin can functionally complement each other. Similar phenomena have also been observed in Caenorhabditis elegans. Ablation of C. elegans ortholog of Aurora-B, AIR-2, by RNAi also results in cytokinesis defects, which are indistinguishable from the down-regulation of the ortholog of survivin, BIR-1 by RNAi (15Schumacher J.M.

A recent study has also shown that human survivin interacts directly with Aurora-B and INCENP (9Wheatley S.P. Carvalho A. Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 886-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The migration of these three chromosomal passenger proteins is intriguing. RNAi-mediated reduction of BIR-1 in C. elegansresults in displacement of the Aurora-B ortholog AIR-2 from chromosomes (17Speliotes E.K. Uren A. Vaux D. Horvitz H.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 211-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), suggesting that survivin is required to target Aurora-B to the chromosomes. Depletion of Drosophila INCENP by RNAi displaces Drosophila Aurora-B from the chromosome and the spindle midzone, while RNAi-mediated reduction of DrosophilaAurora-B prevents INCENP from being transferred to the spindle midzone, indicating that the relocation of these proteins is interdependent (18Adams R.R. Maiato H. Earnshaw W.C. Carmena M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 865-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Among chromosome passenger proteins, only Aurora-B is a mitotic serine/threonine kinase. It has been implicated to play key roles in chromosome segregation, cytokinesis, and cancer development (8Adams R.R. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C.

Aurora-B phosphorylates histone H3, a requirement for premitotic chromosome condensation (8Adams R.R. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C.

Finally, two recent studies have shown that Aurora-B kinase activity is required for kinetochore-microtubule interactions and microtubule dynamics during mitosis (27Murata-Hori M. Wang Y. Curr.

Biol. 2002; 12: 900-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data to date suggest that survivin interacts with Aurora-B physically, genetically, and functionally. Current evidence suggested that these proteins together with INCENP might form a complex (8Adams R.R. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 49-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar); however, the role that survivin plays in the complex is not fully understood. Although survivin is overexpressed in most cancer cells, the mechanism that links survivin to tumor development is poorly understood. In this paper we have focused on the role survivin plays with Aurora-B in this complex. We describe that survivin binds to the catalytic domain of Aurora-B, enhancing its kinase activity bothin vitro and in vivo, and targets Aurora-B to its substrates. An Incyte (Incyte is a registered trademark of Incyte Genomics, Inc.) clone (ID 1272707) containing the complete DNA sequence for human Aurora-B protein was identified from the LifeSeq data base (LifeSeq®) using a BLAST homology search. The following primers were designed for PCR amplification and cloning into the pET-30 Ek/LIC vector: 5′-gacgacgacaagatggcccagaaggagaactcctacc-3′ and 5′-gaggagaagcccggttcaggcgacagattgaagg-3′. PCR products were cloned using the Ek/LIC vector kit (Novagen) per the manufacturer's instructions. pET-30Aurora-BK106R was generated using QuikChange Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The mutagenesis primers are: 5′-ttcatcgtggcgctcagggtcctcttcaagtcc-3′ and 5′-gacttgaagaggaccctgagcgccacgatgaa-3′. Primers used for constructing Aurora-B66–344 in pET28 were: 5′-ggggatgccatatggacatcttaacgcggcacttc-3′ and 5′-cgcggatcctcaggcgacagattgaagggcag-3′. Human survivin (residues 1–120) was cloned into a modified pET14b (Novagen) using primers: 5′-acgtgtccatgggtgccccgacgttgc-3′and 5′-acgtgtctcgagcttattgttggtttcctttg-3′. GST-survivin constructs were generated as described previously (3Verdecia M.A. Huang H. Dutil E. Kaiser D.A. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 29Chantalat L. Skoufias D.A. Kleman J.P. Jung B. Dideberg O. Margolis R.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 183-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). All clones were subsequently confirmed by sequencing analysis. Exponentially growing BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with pET30Aurora-B, or pET30Aurora-BK106R, were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h. The induction condition for His-survivin or GST-survivin is 40 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 23 °C for 16 h. Cell lysates were incubated with Ni+ ProBond beads (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole). The His-Aurora-B and His-survivin were eluted with 250 mm imidazole, dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) with 50 units of thrombin in the dialysis bag at 4 °C for 16 h. GST-survivin was purified using GST purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. Purified survivin was first incubated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin solution (Pierce) at 1:3 molar ratio for 45 min at room temperature and then dialyzed against PBS with 1 mm DTT for 16 h. The average biotin molecule per survivin is 1.7 determined by HABA solution (Pierce). The proper folding of this biotin-survivin was confirmed later by NMR. Full-length Aurora-B and Aurora-B66–344 were translated in the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five microliters of each [35S]methionine-labeled Aurora-B or p27 kip1 was incubated with 10 μg of survivin plus 30 μl of streptavidin beads or with streptavidin beads alone for 1 h at 25 °C. The beads were washed with PBS plus 0.5 m NaCl five times before resolving on SDS gels and analyzing them with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). HEK 293 cells (ATCC) transfected with pCDNAhis-survivin or pCDNAhis vector were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Single cell clones overexpressing survivin or neomycin control were confirmed by survivin immunobloting. HeLa cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Survivin missense and antisense oligonucleotides were obtained from ISIS Pharmaceuticals and used as described previously (7Chen J. Wu W. Tahir S.K. Kroeger P.E. Rosenberg S.H. Cowsert L.M.

Y .). 2000; 2: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). 50 μg of cell lysate or 1 × 105 cells lysed in Laemmli sample buffer (Sigma) were resolved on SDS gels. Immunoblotting were performed as described previously (7Chen J. Wu W. Tahir S.K. Kroeger P.E. Rosenberg S.H. Cowsert L.M. Bennett F. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Welsh K. Reed J.C. Ng S.C. Neoplasia ( N. Y .). 2000; 2: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated Ser-10 of histone H3 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against survivin was purchased from R&D System. The kinase reactions were performed in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm KCl) containing 10 μg histone H3 (Sigma), 5 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP, 5 μm ATP, 140 ng of Aurora-B or Aurora-BK106R, and 2 μg of survivin. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min before resolving on SDS gels, transferring to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and analyzing them with a PhosphorImager. 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated with 0.4 μg ml−1nocodazole (Sigma) overnight. The next day cells were washed with PBS and lysed in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Lysates (1 mg) were incubated with 2.5 μg of anti-Aim-1 (Aurora-B) antibody (BD Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h, and the immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with buffer C and one time with buffer D (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm KCl). Each sample was resuspended in 25 μl of kinase mixture (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm KCl, 10 μg of histone H3, 5 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP, and 5 μm ATP). The kinase reactions were performed and analyzed as described above. Cells grown and treated on eight-chamber slides were fixed with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin for 10 min, washed two times with PBS, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% nonfat dry milk, 0.4% Triton-X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated with either rabbit anti-survivin IgG (R&D Systems) or mouse anti-Aim-1 (BD Biosciences), both diluted 1:200 in PBS, for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and incubated with Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) or Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, both diluted 1:1000 in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed once as described above, stained for microtubules with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated α-antitubulin IgG (Sigma) diluted 1:75 in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C, and then washed one time as described above. The DNA was counterstained with Hoechst (15 μg ml−1) for 10 s, and the cells were washed two more times. Cells were mounted with Citifluor and imaged with a Bio-Rad MRC-1000 confocal system attached to an inverted Nikon microscope fitted with epifluorescence optics and a ×60 (n.a. = 1.4) objective. To characterize the interaction between survivin and Aurora-B, we conducted pull-down experiments using biotin-labeled survivin1–120 and [35S]methionine-labeled Aurora-B. As demonstrated by a previous study (9Wheatley S.P. Carvalho A. Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 886-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we observed the same interaction between survivin and Aurora-B (Fig. 1 A). Similar results were obtained using GST-survivin instead of biotin-labeled survivin (data not show). The interaction between survivin and Aurora-B was also confirmed by anti-Aurora-B antibody immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis with anti-survivin antibody (data not shown). Although a previous study reported that the localization of Aurora-A kinase protein depends on the N-terminal non-catalytic domain of the kinase in Xenopus laevis (30Giet R. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2095-2104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that the catalytic domain of Aurora-B was sufficient to bind to survivin-coated streptavidin beads, but not streptavidin beads alone (Fig. 1 B). A non-related [35S]methionine-labeled protein, p27 kip1 , was used to confirm that the interaction between survivin and Aurora-B was specific. Under the same conditions, p27 kip1 did not bind to survivin-coated streptavidin beads, nor did it bind to streptavidin beads alone (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that survivin specifically binds to the catalytic domain of Aurora-B. When a protein binds to the catalytic domain of a kinase, it usually acts as a substrate, a regulator, or an adaptor. Since a recent study claimed that Aurora-B does not phosphorylate survivin (9Wheatley S.P. Carvalho A. Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 886-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that survivin might regulate Aurora-B activity. Indeed, we found that in the presence of survivin, Aurora-B phosphorylated one of its physiological substrates histone H3 much more strongly than in the absence of survivin (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and2). As survivin and histone H3 have similar molecular weights, we included a control without histone H3 to rule out the possibility that the increase of 33P labeling was due to the phosphorylation of survivin. Under the same assay conditions we did not observe the phosphorylation of survivin by Aurora-B (Fig. 2,lane 3). As a negative control, we constructed a kinase-inactive mutant Aurora-BK106R (31Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar). Using Aurora-BK106R, we did not observe any detectable kinase activity under the same conditions (Fig. 2, lanes 4–7). To determine whether survivin stimulates Aurora-B kinase activity in vivo, we first generated HEK 293 cells stably transfected with N-terminal His-tagged survivin (Fig. 3 A). Subsequently, we overexpressed Aurora-B in both HEK 293 cells that overexpress survivin and vector control HEK 293 cells that do not overexpress survivin. Although similar expression of Aurora-B in both transfected cells was confirmed by immunoblot (Fig. 3 B), we found that immunoprecipitated Aurora-B kinase activity was higher in cells that overexpress survivin using histone H3 as a substrate (Fig. 3 C). Next, we used survivin antisense oligonucleotides to down-regulate endogenous survivin in HeLa cells (Fig. 4 A). We discovered that the immunoprecipitated endogenous Aurora-B activity in survivin antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells was 9-fold lower than that in missense oligonucleotide-treated cells (Fig. 4 B), even though the Aurora-B protein level was unaffected (Fig. 4 C). This result indicates that survivin regulates Aurora-B kinase activity rather than its protein stability. We reasoned that regulating survivin levels might have an impact on the phosphorylation of endogenous histone H3 phosphorylation, since a previous study showed that RNAi mediated AIR-2 reduction led to a defect in histone H3 phosphorylation by immunostaining (17Speliotes E.K. Uren A. Vaux D. Horvitz H.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 211-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Using an antibody against phosphorylated Ser-10 of histone H3, we found that the phosphorylated histone H3 in survivin antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells is much lower than that in survivin missense oligonucleotide-treated cells (Fig. 4 D). These observations further confirmed that survivin enhances Aurora-B kinase activity in vivo. To test if human survivin, like C. elegans BIR1, targets Aurora-B to chromosomes, we used a commercially available monoclonal anti-Aurora-B antibody to detect the localization of Aurora-B in HeLa cells that had been treated with survivin antisense or missense oligonucleotides. In survivin missense oligonucleotide-treated HeLa cells we observed that survivin and Aurora-B colocalized throughout mitosis as described previously (9Wheatley S.P. Carvalho A. Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 886-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). For example, both survivin (Fig. 5, A and B) and Aurora-B (Fig. 5, C and D) colocalized to the spindle midzone at metaphase. As reported previously by us and others, we observed an obvious increase in the number of multinucleated cells in survivin antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells (7Chen J. Wu W. Tahir S.K. Kroeger P.E. Rosenberg S.H. Cowsert L.M. Bennett F. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Welsh K. Reed J.C. Ng S.C. Neoplasia ( N. Y .). 2000; 2: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Survivin staining in the multinucleated cells was below the level of detection and was not observed in the mitotic apparatus (Fig. 5, E andF, cell shown at metaphase). In addition, Aurora-B staining was not localized to the mitotic apparatus in multinucleated cells (Fig. 5, G and H, cell shown in metaphase). However, there was some diffuse staining of Aurora-B throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 G). This diffuse staining is consistent with the result that the Aurora-B protein level remains the same in both survivin antisense and missense oligonucleotide-treated cells (Fig. 4 C). These findings suggest that human survivin is required for targeting of Aurora-B in mitosis. In summary, we have found that survivin localizes Aurora-B to its substrates and enhances its kinase activity in vitro andin vivo. These findings may provide a possible mechanism of action of survivin in cells. First, we speculate that the cytokinesis defects caused by depletion of survivin are through mislocalization of Aurora-B and a decrease in its kinase activity, since Aurora-B is known to recruit ZEN-4 and phosphorylates the myosin II regulatory light chain, two essential proteins for the completion of cytokinesis (21Severson A.F. Hamill D.R. Carter J.C. Schumacher J. Bowerman B. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1162-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 26Murata-Hori M. Fumoto K. Fukuta Y. Iwasaki T. Kikuchi A. Tatsuka M. Hosoya H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 2000; 128: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Results from overexpression of the Aurora-BK106R mutant also indicate that Aurora-B kinase activity is essential for normal cytokinesis (32Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Our evidence that ablation of survivin in HeLa cells causes mislocalization of Aurora-B, a decrease of Aurora-B kinase activity, and increased cytokinesis defects further supports our speculation. Second, survivin has been implicated in the regulation of microtubule stability (33Giodini A. Kallio M.J. Wall N.R. Gorbsky G.J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Symons M. Altieri D.C. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2462-2467PubMed Google Scholar). We, along with others, could not find evidence that survivin directly binds to microtubules (34Skoufias D.A. Mollinari C. Lacroix F.B. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1575-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Two recent studies have shown that Aurora-B kinase activity is required for regulation of microtubule dynamics (27Murata-Hori M. Wang Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 894-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 28Kallio M.J. McCleland M.L. Stukenberg P.T. Gorbsky G.J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 900-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Therefore, that survivin is a positive regulator of Aurora-B may explain how survivin regulates microtubule stability. Third, we postulate that survivin targets Aurora-B to the chromosome where Aurora-B can phosphorylate substrates such as CENP-A and INCENP (24Zeitlin S.G. Shelby R.D. Sullivan K.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 25Bishop J.D. Schumacher J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27577-27580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated INCENP then moves to the central spindle and brings survivin and Aurora-B with it. This may provide an explanation of the following intriguing results: depletion of INCENP by RNAi displaces Drosophila Aurora-B from the chromosome and the spindle midzone, while RNAi mediated reduction ofDrosophila Aurora-B prevents INCENP from being transferred to the spindle midzone (18Adams R.R. Maiato H. Earnshaw W.C. Carmena M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 865-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Finally, Aurora-B kinase has been implicated in human cancer development and is known to be overexpressed in a variety of human cancers (19Tatsuka M. Katayama H. Ota T. Tanaka T. Odashima S. Suzuki F. Terada Y. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4811-4816PubMed Google Scholar). Positive regulation of Aurora-B by survivin may provide a connection between survivin and tumorigenesis or perhaps tumor maintenance. So far, two other kinases (CDK1, CDK4) have been reported to interact with survivin (35O'Connor D.S. Grossman D. Plescia J., Li, F. Zhang H. Villa A. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13103-13107Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 36Suzuki A. Hayashida M. Ito T. Kawano H. Nakano T. Miura M. Akahane K. Shiraki K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3225-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A recent study has shown that CDK1 regulates BAD, a pro-apoptotic protein, via phosphorylation (37Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Whether survivin exerts its anti-apoptosis function through Aurora kinase or other kinases is unknown. Further investigation is warranted. In conclusion, our observations in this study show that survivin directly stimulates the kinase activity of Aurora-B and properly localize Aurora-B, thus providing a mechanism as to how survivin exerts its function in cells.

https://openalex.org/W2047332277,"The β isoform of thyroid hormone receptor (TR-β) has a key role in the feedback regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (H-P-T) axis. The mechanism of trans-repression of the hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) subunit genes, however, remains poorly understood. A number of distinct mechanisms for TR-β-mediated negative regulation by thyroid hormone have been proposed, including those that require and do not require DNA binding. To clarify the importance of DNA binding in negative regulation, we constructed a DNA-binding mutant of TR-β in which two amino acids within the P box were altered (GSG for EGG) to resemble that found in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We termed this mutant GS125, and as expected, it displayed low binding affinities for positive and negative thyroid hormone-response element (pTRE and nTRE, respectively) in gel-mobility shift assays. In transient transfection assays, the GS125 mutant abolished transactivation on three classic pTREs (DR+4, LAP, and PAL) and all negatively regulated promoters in the H-P-T axis (TRH, TSH-β, and TSH-α). However, GS125 TR-β bound to a composite TR/GR-response element and was fully functional on this hybrid TR/GR-response element. Moreover, the GS125 TR-β mutant displayed normal interactions with transcriptional cofactors in mammalian two-hybrid assays. These data do not support a DNA-binding independent mechanism for thyroid hormone negative regulation in the H-P-T axis."

Most of the data obtained so far have been in experiments with endogenous Nef protein, so far overlooking the effects of exogenous soluble Nef protein. We used recombinant exogenous Nef proteins to activate nuclear transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 in the promonocytic cell line U937. Exogenous SIV and HIV-1 Nef proteins activated NF-κB and AP-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Activation of NF-κB by exogenous Nef was concomitant to the degradation of the inhibitor of NF-κB, IκBα. In agreement with increased AP-1 activation, a time- and dose-dependent increase in JNK activation was observed following treatment of U937 cells with exogenous Nef. Since exogenous Nef activates the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1, which bind to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), we investigated the effect of exogenous Nef on HIV-1 replication. We observed that exogenous Nef stimulated HIV-1 LTR via NF-κB activation in U937 cells and enhanced viral replication in the chronically infected promonocytic cells U1. Therefore, our results suggest that exogenous Nef could fuel the progression of the disease via stimulation of HIV-1 provirus present in such cellular reservoirs as mononuclear phagocytes in HIV-infected patients.

Activation of NF-κB by exogenous Nef was concomitant to the degradation of the inhibitor of NF-κB, IκBα. In agreement with increased AP-1 activation, a time- and dose-dependent increase in JNK activation was observed following treatment of U937 cells with exogenous Nef. Since exogenous Nef activates the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1, which bind to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), we investigated the effect of exogenous Nef on HIV-1 replication. We observed that exogenous Nef stimulated HIV-1 LTR via NF-κB activation in U937 cells and enhanced viral replication in the chronically infected promonocytic cells U1. Therefore, our results suggest that exogenous Nef could fuel the progression of the disease via stimulation of HIV-1 provirus present in such cellular reservoirs as mononuclear phagocytes in HIV-infected patients. human immunodeficiency virus activator protein-1 inhibitor of NF-κB Jun N-terminal kinase nuclear factor κB Nef-associated kinase p21-activated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase long terminal repeat tumor necrosis factor IκBα kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 secreted alkaline phosphatase lipopolysaccharide fluorescein isothiocyanate electrophoretic mobility shift assay Nef is a 27-kDa HIV1protein that is produced early during infection and translated from multiply spliced viral mRNAs (1Kim S.Y.

Information is beginning to emerge that suggests that endogenous Nef may have evolved a number of different, independent functional activities to enhance the replication and survival of the virus within infected cells and to facilitate its spread in vivo (2Lama J.

Nef can mediate down-regulation of CD4 cell surface expression, a phenomenon shown to be important for the release of HIV-1 from the cell (2Lama J. Mangasarian A. Trono D. Curr.

Nef expression within macrophages has been reported to favor the recruitment of resting T cells via the secretion of C-C chemokines and to subsequently favor their activation, suggesting a role for Nef in lymphocyte recruitment and activation at sites of viral replication (13Swingler S.

In vivo, several studies have demonstrated the importance of Nef for the efficiency of viral replication and for the maintenance of high viral loads (14Kestler 3rd, H.W. Ringler D.J. Mori K.

HIV replication is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level through the specific interaction of viral regulatory proteins, namely, Tat and cellular transcription factors binding to a variety of cis-acting DNA sequences in the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) (reviewed in Ref. 31Cullen B.R. Faseb J. 1991; 5: 2361-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). One of the main mediators of HIV LTR transcription is nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (32Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). An inducible transcription factor, NF-κB is composed of homo- and heterodimers of Rel family proteins (reviewed in Ref. 33Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). All of the NF-κB proteins contain an N-terminal Rel homology domain, which mediates DNA binding, dimerization, and interaction with the inhibitory proteins, or IκBs. In addition, c-Rel, p65 (RelA), and RelB contain a C-terminal transactivation domain (reviewed in Ref. 33Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). The classic NF-κB complex (p50/p65) is sequestered in the cytoplasm by interaction with a family of inhibitory proteins, or IκBs, including IκBα, IκBβ, IκBε, IκBγ, and the proto-oncogene Bcl-3 (34Baldwin A.S., Jr. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar). Following cell activation by a variety of extracellular stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF), IκBα is phosphorylated at the N-terminal residues Ser-32 and Ser-36 by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, leading to ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation, which allows NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus, where it activates gene expression. Since the identification of NF-κB elements in the HIV LTR (32Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar), multiple studies have assessed the effect of this family of transcription factors on the transcriptional regulation of the HIV LTR and its impact on HIV reactivation from latency (35Chen P.

Study of the interaction between NF-κB and HIV in both human monocytic cells and transformed human macrophages has mainly focused on how monocyte differentiation may lead to HIV expression (39Griffin G.E.

In the promonocytic cell line U937, HIV activates the inducible pool of NF-κB as a result of enhanced IκBα degradation, which is believed to be secondary to IKK activation (41Bachelerie F. Alcami J. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Nature. 1991; 350: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 42Jacque J.M. Fernandez B. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thomas D. Baleux F. Virelizier J.L.

The activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1), a transcription factor, consisting of a homodimer and heterodimers of members of the Jun family (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) and heterodimers of the Jun and Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2) families, is regulated, at least in part, by the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (45Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the activation of NF-κB is regulated by some upstream MAP kinases that also regulate JNK activation in the cells (46Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Induction of AP-1 in macrophages by endogenous HIV-1 Nef has been reported to be a cell type-specific response that requires both Hck and MAPK signaling (47Biggs T.E. Cooke S.J. Barton C.H. Harris M.P. Saksela K. Mann D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Exogenous Nef protein is detected in the serum of HIV-infected subjects (48Fujii Y. Otake K. Tashiro M. Adachi A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Both antibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) directed against Nef have been found in a large proportion of infected individuals (49Ameisen J.C. Guy B. Chamaret S. Loche M. Mouton Y.

This suggests that in vivo Nef is processed and presented by antigen-presenting cells, as the result of uptake of extracellular Nef possibly released by infected apoptotic cells (51Alessandrini L. Santarcangelo A.C. Olivetta E. Ferrantelli F. d'Aloja P. Pugliese K. Pelosi E. Chelucci C. Mattia G. Peschle C. Verani P. Federico M. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2905-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Exogenous Nef protein has been shown to enter the cell by adsorptive endocytosis following nonspecific binding to the surface of CD4+ T cells, primary macrophages, and U937 promonocytic cells (51Alessandrini L. Santarcangelo A.C. Olivetta E. Ferrantelli F. d'Aloja P. Pugliese K. Pelosi E. Chelucci C. Mattia G. Peschle C. Verani P. Federico M. J. Gen.

Confocal microscopy indicates that the intracellular distribution of internalized FITC-labeled recombinant Nef is identical to that of endogenously produced Nef, localizing both in an intracytoplasmic punctate pattern and at the cell margin (51Alessandrini L.

Although most of the results reported so far in regard to signaling were obtained following expression of endogenous Nef protein, exogenous Nef protein could also be involved in the modulation of cell signaling, especially in promonocytic cells and primary macrophages. Since activation of NF-κB and AP-1 results in stimulation of both HIV-1 and SIV replication (41Bachelerie F. Alcami J. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L.

Virol. 2001; 75: 11408-11416Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of exogenous Nef protein in this process. We observed that exogenous Nef protein activates NF-κB, AP-1, and JNK in promonocytic cells U937 and enhances HIV-1 replication in chronically infected U1 cells. Recombinant SIVmac Nef protein (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, National Institutes of Health cat. 2999, kindly provided by Jose Torres) and recombinant Nef protein derived from HIV-1 strains, SF-2, BH10 (kindly provided by M. Harris, Leeds University, UK) and NL4-3 (kindly provided by U. Mahlknecht, Frankfurt University, Germany) were used to treat U937 cells and U1 cells. Anti-SIV Nef antibody was provided by the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, National Institutes of Health (cat. 2659). Anti-HIV-1 Nef antibody was provided by AbCys (Paris, France). Antibody against IκBα and the double-stranded oligonucleotide having the AP-1 consensus sequence were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-IκBα (Ser32) antibody was purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). TNF was purchased from R&D Systems. Most of the studies were performed with the promonocytic cells U937 obtained from the American Tissue Cell Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The promonocytic cell line U1, derived from cells surviving acute infection of the U937 cell line, contains two integrated HIV copies per cell (57Folks T.M. Justement J. Kinter A. Schnittman S. Orenstein J. Poli G. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1117-1122PubMed Google Scholar). U1 cells were a gift from Dr. U. Mahlknecht (University of Frankfurt, Germany). U937 and U1 cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To measure NF-κB and AP-1 activation, EMSA were carried out as previously described by Manna and Aggarwal (58Manna S.K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2095-2102PubMed Google Scholar) and by Van Lint et al. (59Van Lint C. Ghysdael J. Paras P. Burny A. Verdin E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2632-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts prepared from cells treated with exogenous Nef protein were incubated with 32P-end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide, 5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′ (bold indicates NF-κB binding sites), and the DNA-protein complex formed was resolved from free oligonucleotide on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel. A double-stranded mutated oligonucleotide 5′-TTGTTACAACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′, was used to examine the specificity of binding of NF-κB to the DNA. The specificity of binding was also examined by competition with the unlabeled oligonucleotide and a heterologous unlabeled oligonucleotide. To measure AP-1 activation, nuclear extracts, prepared as described above, were incubated with the 32P-end-labeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′ (bold indicates AP-1 binding site) and analyzed on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel. The specificity of the binding was examined by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide, with a heterologous unlabeled oligonucleotide and with a consensus unlabeled oligonucleotide. The dried gels were visualized and radioactive bands quantified by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) using ImageQuant software. Cytoplasmic extracts of U937 cells treated for different times with exogenous SIV Nef protein were used to examine IκBα degradation by Western blot procedure as described (58Manna S.K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2095-2102PubMed Google Scholar). The c-Jun kinase (JNK) assay was performed according to the method of Manna and Aggarwal (58Manna S.K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2095-2102PubMed Google Scholar). To examine SIV Nef-induced NF-κB-dependent gene expression, cells were transfected with the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) expression plasmid for 10 h before treatment with SIV Nef. After 24 h, cell culture conditioned-medium was harvested and analyzed (25 μl) for alkaline phosphatase activity, as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). SEAP activity was assayed on a 96-well fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroscan II, Lab Systems) with excitation set at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. This reporter system was specific since TNF-induced NF-κB SEAP activity was inhibited by overexpression of the IκBα mutant, IκBα-DN, which lacks Ser-32 and Ser-36 (60Darnay B.G., Ni, J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). To examine NF-κB LTR-driven gene expression by exogenous HIV Nef, 107 U937 cells were transfected with 750 ng of pLTR-Luc or 750 ng of pLTRmut-NFkB-Luc using the DEAE-dextran procedure (61Van Lint C. Amella C.A. Emiliani S. John M. Jie T. Verdin E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6113-6127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours later, the cells were stimulated with different concentrations of exogenous HIV-1 Nef or with TNF. At 48-h post-transfection, luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates using a luminometer (TD-20/20; Promega, Madison, WI) as previously reported (11Mahlknecht U. Deng C., Lu, M.C. Greenough T.C. Sullivan J.L. O'Brien W.A. Herbein G. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6437-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Values normalized to protein concentrations were expressed in fold increase over unstimulated control values. U1 cells were treated with different concentrations of exogenous HIV-1 Nef or TNF. Culture supernatants were collected every day and assessed for p24 antigen using a microELISA assay (Organon Teknika). Treatment of U937 cells with exogenous SIV Nef for 90 min revealed a dose-dependent activation of NF-κB by EMSA (Fig. 1 A), with maximum activation at ∼50–100 ng/ml, but to a lesser extent than TNF, the most potent activator of NF-κB (3.5-fold versus 5.2-fold induction). Exogenous SIV Nef activated NF-κB in a time- and dose-dependent manner reaching a peak by 90 min (Fig. 1 B). The gel shift band was specific as formation of the complex was blocked with an unlabeled oligonucleotide and was supershifted by either anti-p50 or anti-p65 antibody alone, and also by a mixture of anti-p50 and anti-p65 antibodies (Fig. 1 C), indicating that it is composed of p50 and p65 subunits. To rule out the possibility that a TNF inducer, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), produced the activity, we treated exogenous SIV Nef protein with 1% trypsin or boiled it at 100 °C (Fig. 1 D). Both treatments abolished Nef-induced NF-κB activity, indicating that exogenous Nef protein, but not LPS contamination, was responsible for NF-κB activation. The pretreatement of exogenous Nef protein with a neutralizing anti-Nef monoclonal antibody blocked NF-κB activation (Fig. 1 D), thereby indicating the effect was Nef-specific. The degradation of IκBα in U937 cells treated with exogenous SIV Nef protein for different periods of time was also examined using Western blot analysis. We observed that IκBα started to degrade at 15 min, degraded maximally by 30–60 min, and started to be resynthesized at 90 min (Fig. 1 E, upper panel). The presence of a slow migrating band of IκBα in samples prepared from SIV Nef-treated cells suggested the appearance of the phosphorylated form of IκBα, which is required for IκBα degradation. The induction of the phosphorylated form of IκBα by exogenous SIV Nef was detected by using an antibody directed against the phosphorylated form of IκBα, with a maximum detection by 30 min (Fig. 1 E, lower panel). Since SIV Nef and HIV-1 Nef may differ in regard to some of their biological functions (62Kirchhoff F. Munch J. Carl S. Stolte N. Matz-Rensing K. Fuchs D. Haaft P.T. Heeney J.L. Swigut T. Skowronski J. Stahl-Hennig C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8371-8383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested recombinant HIV-1 Nef proteins derived from three HIV-1 isolates, NL4–3, SF2, and BH10, in regard to NF-κB activation in U937 cells. We observed that exogenous SF2 Nef protein activated NF-κB in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). The gel-shift band was specific as formation of the complex was blocked with an unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide, but not with a mutated NF-κB oligonucleotide or with a heterologous oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 B). The gel shift band was supershifted by either anti-p50 or anti-p65 antibody alone (Fig. 2 C), indicating that it is composed of p50 and p65 subunits. Nef-induced NF-κB activation was also observed following treatment of U937 cells with exogenous HIV-1 BH10 and NL4–3 Nef proteins (Fig. 2 D), indicating that NF-κB activation mediated by exogenous Nef is viral isolate-independent. Most agents that activate NF-κB also activate the transcription factor AP-1 (45Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the ability of exogenous SIV Nef protein to activate AP-1 in U937 cells. Exogenous SIV Nef protein activated AP-1 in a dose-dependent manner, but to a lesser extent than TNF (3.5-fold versus 5-fold induction) (Fig. 3 A). AP-1 activation by exogenous SIV Nef was time-dependent, with optimum activation occurring at ∼90 min (Fig. 3 B). Supershift analysis with specific antibodies against c-Fos and c-Jun indicated that AP-1 activation induced by exogenous SIV Nef consisted of Fos and Jun (Fig. 3 C). Lack of supershift by unrelated antibodies and disappearance of the AP-1 band by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide indicate that the interaction was specific (Fig. 3 C). Activation of JNK is another early event initiated by many stress stimuli and is required for AP-1 activation (45Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). Treatment of U937 cells with exogenous SIV Nef protein led to an increase in JNK activity in a time- (Fig. 3 D) and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 E). The overall level of JNK activation triggered by exogenous SIV Nef protein was less than that observed following TNF treatment (3-fold versus 6-fold) (Fig. 3 E). Since SIV Nef and HIV-1 Nef could differ in regard to their biological functions (62Kirchhoff F. Munch J. Carl S. Stolte N. Matz-Rensing K. Fuchs D. Haaft P.T. Heeney J.L. Swigut T. Skowronski J. Stahl-Hennig C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8371-8383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested recombinant HIV-1 Nef proteins derived from three HIV-1 isolates, NL4–3, SF2, and BH10 in regard to AP-1 activation in U937 cells. Exogenous BH10 Nef protein activated AP-1 in a time-dependent (Fig. 4 A) and dose-dependent manner (data not shown). The gel shift band was specific, as formation of the complex was blocked with an unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotide and with an unlabeled consensus AP-1 oligonucleotide, but not with a heterologous NF-κB oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 B). The gel shift band was supershifted by either anti-c-Fos or anti-c-Jun antibody alone, but also by a mixture of anti-c-Fos and anti-c-Jun antibodies (Fig. 4 C), indicating that it is composed of c-Fos and c-Jun subunits. AP-1 activation followed treatment of U937 cells with exogenous HIV-1 Nef proteins derived from NL4–3, BH10, and SF2 isolates (Fig. 4 D), indicating that AP-1 activation mediated by exogenous HIV-1 Nef was viral isolate-independent. We assessed whether NF-κB activation triggers gene expression in U937 cells treated with exogenous Nef proteins. We examined the effect of exogenous SIV Nef on NF-κB-driven SEAP gene expression in U937 cells. SIV-Nef enhanced SEAP gene expression in a dose-dependent manner, comparable with TNF (Fig. 5 A). SEAP gene expression was NF"

Here we report the crystal structures of M3 both alone and in complex with the CC chemokine MCP-1. M3 is a two-domain beta sandwich protein with a unique sequence and topology, forming a tightly packed anti-parallel dimer. The stoichiometry of the MCP-1:M3 complex is 2:2, with two monomeric chemokines embedded at distal ends of the preassociated M3 dimer. Conformational flexibility and electrostatic complementation are both used by M3 to achieve high-affinity and broad-spectrum chemokine engagement. M3 also employs structural mimicry to promiscuously sequester chemokines, engaging conservative structural elements associated with both chemokine homodimerization and binding to G protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2052314828,"We show that in fission yeast the mitotic B type cyclin Cdc13/Cdc2 kinase associates with replication origins in vivo. This association is dependent on the origin recognition complex (ORC), is established as chromosomes are replicated, and is maintained during G2 and early mitosis. Cells expressing an orp2 (ORC2) allele that reduces binding of Cdc13 to replication origins are acutely prone to chromosomal reduplication. In synchronized endoreduplicating cells, following Cdc13 ablation, replication origins are coordinately licensed prior to each successive round of S phase with the same periodicity as in a normal cell cycle. Thus, ORC bound mitotic Cyclin B/Cdc2 kinase imposes the dependency of S phase on an intervening mitosis but not the temporal licensing of replication origins between each S phase."

The core IKK enzyme consists of two highly homologous catalytic subunits α and β of 85 and 87 kDa in sizes, respectively, and a 48-kDa regulatory subunit, IKK-γ/NEMO (referred to as IKK-γ herein) (9Karin M.

In vivo the IKK holoenzyme exists as a large protein complex of at least 700–900 kDa in size (8DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

It is not clear what other protein components are present in the holo-IKK enzyme complex in addition to IKK-α, IKK-β, and IKK-γ. Several members of the I-κB and NF-κB/Rel families of proteins and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP), MEK kinase, and NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) have been reported to interact with IKK, although these proteins have not been found to co-elute with the 900-kDa IKK complex chromatographically (9Karin M.

The molecular mechanism via which Tax affects IKK activation after its association with IKK-γ remains incompletely understood, however. We have found recently that Tax can interact directly with the catalytic subunit of the major serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2Ac) in vivo and in vitro. 2Y.-L. Kuo, L.-C. Wang, M.-H.

Furthermore, Tax acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of PP2A in in vitroassays where 32P-labeled glycogen phosphorylasea is used as a PP2A substrate.2 Consistent with the notion that Tax inhibits the activity of PP2A, MEK phosphorylation and to a lesser extent cAMP-response element-binding protein and ATF-1 phosphorylation in Tax-expressing HTLV-I-transformed cells and in Tax-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells are greatly elevated.2 Most interestingly, PP2A interaction-defective mutants of Tax fail to stimulate MEK phosphorylation and are unable to activate NF-κB, thus suggesting a link between the inhibition of PP2A by Tax and NF-κB activation.2 PP2A is a major serine/threonine protein phosphatase in all eukaryotic cells (for comprehensive reviews, see Refs. 19Evans D.R.

It is crucial for the negative regulation of multiple cellular processes. The holo-PP2A enzyme is a heterotrimer that consists of a core enzyme formed by the highly conserved A subunit (60 kDa, 2 human isoforms) and C (catalytic) subunit (36 kDa, 2 human isoforms) together with many different regulatory B-subunits that derive from multiple genes (three distinct families: B/B55/PR55 (3 genes), B′/B56/PR61 (>3 genes), and B′′/PR72/PR130 (1 gene)), and their alternatively spliced mRNAs (19Evans D.R.

The heterodimer formed by A- and C-subunits and the heterotrimer containing all three subunits are termed core enzyme and holoenzyme, respectively (19Evans D.R.

A role of PP2A in controlling the signal transduction pathway that leads to IKK/NF-κB activation has been reported previously (8DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of PP2A, has been shown to activate NF-κB in vivo (26Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 27Sun S.C. Maggirwar S.B. Harhaj E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18347-18351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PP2A can inactivate the kinase activity of IKK in vitro (8DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence to show that via a tripartite interaction, Tax, PP2A, and IKKγ form a ternary complex. In in vitro IKK assays, Tax reduces the ability of PP2A to inactivate IKK. Consistent with the notion that activation of IKK requires that Tax bind to both IKKγ and PP2A, several Tax mutants that are abrogated or attenuated for PP2A binding fail to activate NF-κB even though they continue to bind IKKγ. These results indicate that, in the context of the IKK·PP2A·Tax complex, PP2A activity is inhibited or diminished. In essence, IKK is activated by serine phosphorylation of its activation loop upon extracellular stimulation. In normal cells, phospho-IKK becomes rapidly inactivated by IKKγ-associated PP2A, returning IKK to a resting state. In HTLV-I infected or transformed cells, PP2A inhibition by IKKγ-bound Tax maintains IKK in the phosphorylated and active form, causing constitutive phosphorylation and degradation of I-κB, which in turn leads to nuclear presence of NF-κB/Rel and potent activation of genes under NF-κB/Rel control. The anti-Tax monoclonal antibody 4C5 is of IgG2a subtype and reacts with amino acid residues 333–353 of Tax. 3D.-X. Fu, Y.-L. Kuo, B.-Y. Liu, K.-T. Jeang, and C.-Z. Giam, unpublished results. The anti-PP2A C-subunit monoclonal antibody (the COOH-terminal amino acid residues 295–309 of the catalytic subunit of human PP2A) and anti-IKKγ (amino acids 1–419, representing full-length human IKKγ) monoclonal antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., respectively. The purified PP2A was derived from human red blood cells and consists of both A and C subunits (Upstate Biotechnology). Jurkat and the HTLV-I-transformed T-cell line MT-4 were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen) in the presence of 10% CO2. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion of wild-type and mutant forms of Tax, GST-Tax, GST-H43Q, GST-K85N, GST-M22, GST-M47, were constructed as reported previously (28Adya N. Giam C.Z. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1834-1841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST-IκBα-(1–54) and Ser-32 and Ser-36 phosphorylation sites mutant GST-IκBα-(1–54)AA were generous gifts of Drs.

GST-IKKγΔC was constructed by replacing in GST-Tax an NcoI, SmaI fragment that contains the coding sequence for wild-type Tax with an NcoI,SmaI fragment that encodes the NH2-terminal 306 amino acid residues of IKKγ. GST fusion proteins were expressed and prepared by standard protocols and stored frozen in buffer D (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% glycerol) at −80 °C. Immunoprecipitations were carried out using extracts prepared from Jurkat and HTLV-I-transformed MT-4 cells. Ten million cells were harvested, washed 3 times, each with 10 ml of phosphate-buffer saline, and lysed by repeated passage through a 27.5-gauge syringe in 1 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmEDTA, 5 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 50 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors pepstatin, leupeptin, bestatin, and aprotinin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with 200 μg of proteins in 500 μl of cell lysates. Briefly, cell lysates were precleared by incubation with 100 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) and 2 μg of normal mouse antiserum in 5 μl for 30 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. After preclearing, 2 μg of a Tax monoclonal antibody (4C5), PP2A C-subunit monoclonal antibody, or IKKγ monoclonal antibody were added to each sample. The reactions were preincubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After the addition of 30 μl of protein G-agarose to each reaction, the mixtures were incubated overnight. On the following day, immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, washed 3 times with 0.8 ml of lysis buffer, resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated at 95 °C for 3 min, and centrifuged, and then 15 μl of sample were loaded and resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing a 4% stacking gel. Proteins resolved in the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). For Western blotting, membranes were incubated with blocking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween, 0.02% sodium azide, 5% nonfat dry milk) for 3 h and then probed in the same buffer for 2 h with mouse monoclonal antibodies against PP2Ac, IKKγ, or Tax. After washing, the blots were incubated for 1 h in the same buffer containing an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, secondary antibody (diluted 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed three times, developed using a chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal; Pierce), and exposed to x-ray films. For GST pull-down experiments, ∼500 ng each of purified GST, GST-Tax, or GST-IKKγ was incubated with 300 ng of purified PP2A or PP2A and Tax in 30 μl of 1× binding buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 0.15% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min at 30 °C. Forty microliters of a 50% slurry of prewashed glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) were added to each binding reaction, and samples were incubated for 1 h with agitation at 4 °C. After incubation, the protein-bound Sepharose beads were washed 3 times with 800 μl of 1× binding buffer, pelleted by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min, resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and heated to 95 °C, and 15 μl from each reaction were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting, as described. To remove the GST moiety from GST-IKKγ, the fusion protein was proteolysed with 0.2 unit of thrombin (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C, and the treated protein was then incubated with GST-Tax as described above. Under these conditions, GST-IKKγ was converted completely to IKKγ by thrombin, and the residual thrombin in the reaction mixture did not interfere significantly with the binding reactions. To measure IKK activity, 107 MT-4 cells were harvested by centrifugation and extracted in 1 ml of a lysis buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 20 mm glycerol phosphate, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin. After a brief centrifugation, extracts were incubated for 2 h with agitation at 4 °C with 0.5 μg of an antibody against IKKγ followed by protein G-Sepharose (Invitrogen) precipitation. Each IKK immune complex reaction was carried out using 1 μg of recombinant GST protein fused to amino acid residues 1–54 of IκBα (GST- IκBα-(1–54)) as the substrate and 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP in a final volume of 30 μl of a reaction buffer containing 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 25 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. IKK activity as measured by the phosphorylation level of IκBα was evaluated by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. When applicable, 5 ng of PP2A and 0.1–0.6 μg of Tax were added into a 30-μl reaction. Several cellular kinases and regulatory proteins whose activities are regulated by serine/threonine phosphorylation form protein complexes with PP2A (29Andjelkovic N. Zolnierowicz S. Van Hoof C.

In this manner, PP2A is localized to its targets at once and can affect rapid on/off control of regulatory processes immediately after signaling events are initiated. Because Tax interacts with both PP2A and IKKγ, we wondered if PP2A also forms a complex with IKK. This might explain the rapidity with which the IKK/NF-κB pathway is returned to the inactive state soon after its activation. Furthermore, because Tax constitutively activates IKK, we wondered if, in the context of the IKK-PP2A-Tax complex, the phosphatase activity of PP2A may be inhibited by Tax. Because IKK is activated through serine phosphorylation of its activation loop by upstream kinases, a block in its de-phosphorylation by Tax would maintain phospho-IKK in an active state and can explain the constitutive activation of IKK by Tax. To determine whether IKK, PP2A, and Tax form a ternary complex in vivo, cell extracts were prepared from a Tax-expressing HTLV-I-transformed human T-cell line, MT-4, and a control human T-cell line, Jurkat, and subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibodies against Tax, the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac), and IKKγ, respectively. As expected, mouse monoclonal antibody against IKKγ precipitated IKKγ easily (Fig. 1,lanes 3 and 4, upper panel). From Tax-positive MT-4 cell extracts, both the PP2A c-subunit (PP2Ac) and Tax were readily co-precipitated (lane 4, middleand lower panels, respectively). In Jurkat extracts, a low but detectable trace of PP2Ac was also present (lane 3,middle panel). Likewise, Tax monoclonal antibody 4C5 co-precipitated Tax, PP2Ac, and IKKγ (lane 6,lower, middle, and upper panels). The 4C5 antibody is highly specific for Tax. It did not react with either PP2Ac or IKKγ, as indicated by immunoprecipitations done with Tax-null Jurkat extracts (lane 5). Finally, a mouse monoclonal antibody against the COOH-terminal region of PP2Ac co-precipitated IKKγ from both Jurkat and MT-4 extracts. Interestingly and in agreement with the immunoprecipitation performed with anti- IKKγ (lanes 3 and 4), the amount of IKKγ that co-precipitated with PP2Ac is lower when Jurkat extracts were used (compare lanes 7 and 8, upper panel). The PP2Ac antibody failed to co-immunoprecipitate Tax, however (lanes 7 and 8, bottom panel). We think this is due to a disruption of the protein-protein interaction between Tax and PP2Ac by the PP2Ac antibody. The COOH-terminal region of PP2Ac is involved in extensive protein-protein interaction; the carboxyl leucine residue undergoes a methyl esterification (35De B., I Derua R. Janssens V. Van Hoof C.

Together, these data indicate that PP2A interacts with IKK directly. Furthermore, Tax interacts with IKKγ and PP2A in vivo in a stable ternary complex. To characterize further the interaction among Tax, IKKγ, and PP2A, GST pull-down experiments were performed using purified PP2A, consisting principally of both the catalytic C-subunit (PP2Ac) and the regulatory A-subunit, derived from human red blood cells (Upstate Biotechnology) in the presence or absence of Tax protein purified from an Escherichia coli expression system. Care was taken to ensure comparable levels of purified GST, GST-Tax, and GST-IKKγ fusion proteins (Fig. 2 A) were used. In binding reactions containing PP2A only, GST-Tax, GST-IKKγ, and GST-IKKγΔC, the GST fusion of an IKKγ mutant deleted for the COOH-terminal Tax binding domain (amino acid residues 307–419), all displayed efficient binding to PP2Ac (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). Under these experimental conditions, ∼2 and 4% of input PP2Ac became bound to GST-Tax and GST- IKKγ, respectively. The interactions appear specific since under the same binding condition, GST control did not bind PP2Ac. Interestingly, in reactions where both PP2A and Tax were added, the binding of PP2A to GST-IKKγ became significantly enhanced (compare Fig. 2, B and C,GST-IKKγ lanes, lower panel). By contrast, Tax did not increase PP2A binding to GST-IKKγΔC (Fig. 2 C, compare the GST-IKKγ andGST-IKKγΔC lanes in thelower panel) whose Tax binding site is deleted and is unable to bind Tax (upper panel), suggesting that when Tax is bound to IKKγ, it can further stabilize or enhance IKKγ-PP2A interaction. As anticipated, GST-IKKγ interacted with Tax (Fig. 2 C,GST-IKKγ lane, upper panel). In agreement with earlier results, GST-Tax interacted with PP2A (GST-Tax lane, lower panel). Because Tax exists as homodimer, GST-Tax and Tax interaction was also seen (GST-Tax lane, upper panel). The exogenously added Tax (300 ng) did not significantly compete for PP2Ac binding to GST-Tax (500 ng), most likely because the interaction between Tax and PP2Ac was not saturating (only 2% input PP2Ac was pulled down by GST-Tax). No binding of Tax or PP2A to GST was detected. Together, these data support the immunoprecipitation results shown above and indicate that PP2A is associated with IKK. Furthermore, in the presence of Tax, a stable IKK·PP2A·Tax ternary complex can form. Finally, even though IKKγΔC mutant is defective in binding Tax (18Jin D.Y. Giordano V. Kibler K.V. Nakano H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34060-34067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), it is still able to associate with PP2A, much like the full-length IKKγ, suggesting that PP2A binds to a region in IKKγ upstream of the COOH-terminal Tax binding site. If indeed the inhibition of PP2A by Tax in the context of the IKK·PP2A·Tax complex leads to a constitutive activation of IKK, then one might expect that both Tax-PP2A and Tax-IKKγ interactions would be necessary for Tax-mediated activation of IKK and NF-κB. Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis, we have previously mapped the domain critical for PP2Ac binding to the NH2-terminal 100-amino acid residues of Tax (Fig. 3 A).2 This region is distinct from the domain responsible for IKKγ binding previously localized to approximately amino acid residues 100–150 previously (Fig. 3 A) (40Xiao G.

We report that spinophilin is phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase A (PKA). Phosphorylation of spinophilin was stimulated by treatment of neostriatal neurons with a dopamine D1 receptor agonist or with forskolin, consistent with spinophilin being a substrate for PKA in intact cells. Using tryptic phosphopeptide mapping, site-directed mutagenesis, and microsequencing analysis, we identified two major sites of phosphorylation, Ser-94 and Ser-177, that are located within the actin-binding domain of spinophilin. Phosphorylation of spinophilin by PKA modulated the association between spinophilin and the actin cytoskeleton. Following subcellular fractionation, unphosphorylated spinophilin was enriched in the postsynaptic density, whereas a pool of phosphorylated spinophilin was found in the cytosol. F-actin co-sedimentation and overlay analysis revealed that phosphorylation of spinophilin reduced the stoichiometry of the spinophilin-actin interaction. In contrast, the ability of spinophilin to bind to PP1 remained unchanged. Taken together, our studies suggest that phosphorylation of spinophilin by PKA modulates the anchoring of the spinophilin-PP1 complex within dendritic spines, thereby likely contributing to the efficacy and plasticity of synaptic transmission.

This dynamic behavior is believed to be fundamental to the function of dendritic spines and to contribute to the efficacy and plasticity of synaptic transmission. The ability of dendritic spines to change shape has been attributed to a dense network of proteins that facilitates the rapid assembly and disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton (13Matus A. Science. 2000; 290: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 14Halpain S. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 141-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Indeed, dendritic spines contain a rich variety of receptors, ion channels, actin-regulating proteins, and other biochemical machinery that support the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (15Kim J.H. Huganir R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Lee S.H. Sheng M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Despite growing evidence that this protein network may be involved in the dynamic behavior of spines, the molecular mechanisms that underlie this process are not well understood. Spinophilin (also known as neurabin II) is a PP11- and actin-binding protein that is enriched in dendritic spines (17Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 18Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Several independent lines of evidence suggest that spinophilin may link synaptic transmission to changes in the structure and function of dendritic spines. Spinophilin has been shown to regulate excitatory synaptic transmission by targeting PP1 to α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid (AMPA)- and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate channels and promoting channel down-regulation through dephosphorylation (19Feng J. Yan Z. Ferreira A. Tomizawa K. Liauw J.A. Zhuo M. Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9287-9292Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 20Yan Z.

Moreover, spinophilin-deficient mice exhibited more persistent AMPA- and NMDA-receptor currents and greatly reduced long term depression (19Feng J. Yan Z. Ferreira A. Tomizawa K. Liauw J.A. Zhuo M. Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9287-9292Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Spinophilin is likely to influence the dynamic behavior of dendritic spines by its ability to modulate the actin cytoskeleton. Spinophilin has been shown to bind and cross-link actin filaments in vitro (18Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In vivo, spinophilin-deficient mice exhibited a marked increase in spine density during development (19Feng J. Yan Z. Ferreira A. Tomizawa K. Liauw J.A. Zhuo M. Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9287-9292Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Moreover, cultured neurons from spinophilin knockout mice had more filopodia, or spine-like protrusions, but the same number of nerve terminals as wild-type mice. These observations suggest that spinophilin may either facilitate spine retraction or suppress the initial outgrowth of spines from the dendrite. In addition to actin, spinophilin interacts with a variety of other proteins, including its homologue neurabin (21Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Satoh A. Wada M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Nishioka H. Matsuura Y.

Thus, spinophilin may function as a scaffold protein to regulate cross-talk between various physiological stimuli in dendritic spines. However, it remains to be determined whether spinophilin is regulated by specific neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Notably, spinophilin contains consensus sequences for phosphorylation by several protein kinases, including protein kinase A (PKA), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and protein kinase C. In the present study, we demonstrate that spinophilin is phosphorylated in vitro, and likely,in vivo, by PKA, and we have studied the functional consequences of spinophilin phosphorylation on its interactions with actin and PP1. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Drugs were obtained from the following sources: cyclosporin A, okadaic acid, and calyculin A from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA); forskolin, SKF-81297 and quinpirole from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The purified catalytic subunit of PP1 was kindly provided by Dr. Hsien-bin Huang (National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan). Radioisotopes were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA), and cellulose thin-layer chromatography plates were from Kodak (Rochester, NY). Restriction enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen (Rockville, MD) and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane was from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon Technologies (Berkeley, CA), and peptides and phosphopeptides were synthesized at The Rockefeller University Protein/DNA Technology Center (New York, NY). Neostriatal slices were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats (8–12 weeks old) as described previously (26Snyder G. Allen P. Fienberg A. Valle C. Huganir R. Nairn A. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4480-4488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coronal sections (500 μm in thickness) were cut on a Vibratome (Ted Pella, Redding, CA), maintained at 4 °C, and placed in cold, oxygenated (95% O2/5% CO2) Krebs-HCO3− buffer (125 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 26 mm NaHCO3, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4). Neostriatal slices were dissected from the coronal sections under a dissecting microscope and transferred individually to 2 ml of cold, oxygenated buffer. After replacing the buffer with fresh Krebs-HCO3− buffer, slices were preincubated at 30 °C under constant oxygenation. After 30 min, the buffer was replaced with fresh Krebs-HCO3− buffer containing 2.0 mCi of [32P]orthophosphoric acid, and the tissue was incubated for 60 min. The radioactive buffer was then removed, and the slices were rinsed twice with 2 ml of fresh buffer. The tissue was incubated in the absence or presence of forskolin (50 μmin Krebs-HCO3− buffer) for 5 min. After treatment, the slices were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until assayed. Frozen tissue slices were sonicated in lysis buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.2% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 mmbenzamidine) and phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.05 mmNa2MoO4). The total [32P]phosphate incorporated into trichloroacetic acid-precipitated protein was determined for each sample, and homogenates containing equal amounts of 32P-labeled proteins were mixed with pre-swollen protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (10 μl per sample, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was transferred to tubes containing a rabbit polyclonal antibody against spinophilin (3 μg of RU145 per sample (17Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar)). The sample was mixed at 4 °C overnight and then for an additional 2 h with pre-swollen protein A-Sepharose. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed four times with lysis buffer and once with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. After the final wash, the beads were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged. The recovered proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% acrylamide gels. The gels were dried, and [32P]phosphate incorporation into spinophilin was visualized using a PhosphorImager 400B and ImageQuaNT software from Amersham Biosciences. A spinophilin construct containing an amino-terminal histidine tag was prepared as follows: the spinophilin sequence encoding residues 1–305 was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-CCC ACA TAT GAT GAA GAC GGA GCC TCG-3′ and 5′-CTT TCC TCA ACC TCC ACC GGT T-3′. The resulting 900-bp fragment was digested with NdeI/XhoI and subcloned with a XhoI/XhoI fragment of spinophilin (residues 220–817 (17Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the spinophilin histidine tag construct as a template. The actin-binding construct of spinophilin encoding residues 1–221 was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-CCC ACA TAT GAT GAA GAC GGA GCC TCG-3′ and 5′-CGC GGA TCC TAC CTC GAG TCG GCT TTC TCG A-3′. The resulting fragment was digested with NdeI/BamHI and ligated in-frame into the NdeI/BamHI site of the vector pET-15b. All mutants were confirmed by sequencing. Recombinant proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose resin (Ni-NTA; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described previously (27Hsieh-Wilson L.C. Allen P.B. Watanabe T. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4365-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation reactions were performed using the protein of interest (10 μm) and the catalytic subunit of PKA (40 μg/ml (28Kaczmarek L.K. Jennings K.R. Strumwasser F. Nairn A.C. Walter U. Wilson F.D. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7487-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar)) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA at 30 °C. Reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP (50 μm) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated at various time points by dilution of the reaction mixture into SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the stoichiometry of phosphorylation (moles of Pi/mole of protein) was assessed after SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, by measurement of 32P incorporation and normalization to the amount of protein used. After autoradiography, gel pieces containing 32P-labeled spinophilin were re-swollen in destain (50% methanol/10% acetic acid in water), washed twice with 50% methanol in water, and dried. Gel pieces were then incubated withl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (50 μg/ml, Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) in 50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.0 (1 ml), for 18 h at 37 °C. The supernatants containing the soluble phosphopeptides were recovered after centrifugation. The extraction efficiency (∼85%) was quantified by Cerenkov counting of the gel pieces and supernatants before and after digestion. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was performed as described previously (29Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7273-7281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For phosphopeptide mapping, electrophoretic separation was at pH 3.5 for 90 min at 400 V, and ascending chromatography was in pyridine/n-butanol/acetic acid/water (15:10:3:12). The pattern of tryptic phosphopeptides was detected by autoradiography using PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA) or Kodak (Rochester, NY) film. Wild-type and alanine mutant histidine fusion proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli by the induction of log-phase cells (5-ml cultures) with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C. After 1 h, cells were resuspended in ice-cold buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, containing protease inhibitors) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was mixed with Ni-NTA resin (20 μl per sample) for 30 min at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times with ice-cold buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and once with 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2. Phosphorylation reactions were carried out as described above with the proteins bound to the resin. After 1 h, reactions were terminated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the phosphorylated proteins were loaded onto 8% acrylamide gels for autoradiography and phosphopeptide mapping analysis. Phosphorylation sites, determined by point mutations, were confirmed by reverse phase capillary high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and microsequencing analysis. Wild-type spinophilin (10 μg) was phosphorylated by PKA in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixture was separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a PVDF membrane. The 32P-labeled spinophilin was localized by autoradiography, and the membrane was excised and subjected to proteolytic digestion with trypsin or GluC proteases. Eluted peptides were separated by HPLC, and fractions eluting from the capillary column were spotted directly onto a strip of PVDF membrane using a 153 microblotter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA (30Bibb J.A. Nishi A. O'Callaghan J.P. Ule J. Lan M. Snyder G.L. Horiuchi A. Saito T. Hisanaga S. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14490-14497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)). Membrane pieces containing the 32P-labeled phosphopeptides were excised and subjected to automated amino-terminal protein microsequencing and mass spectrometry. Rabbit polyclonal phosphorylation state-specific antibodies were generated and purified essentially as described (31Czernik A.J. Mathers J. Mische S.M. Neuromethods. 1997; 30: 219-246Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised against the following cysteine-containing phosphopeptides conjugated to thyroglobulin: VRL(pS)LPRAC (residues 91–98), CLPRAS(pS)LNE (residues 95–103), and CQERA(pS)LQDRK (residues 173–182). Affinity purification was performed using dephospho- and phosphopeptides coupled to SulfoLink gel (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Neostriatal slices were dissected as described above and preincubated in fresh Krebs-HCO3− buffer at 30 °C under constant oxygenation. After 30 min, the slices were incubated in Krebs-HCO3− buffer in the absence or presence of the indicated drugs for 5–60 min. The slices were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until assayed. Frozen tissue samples were sonicated in boiling 1% SDS containing protein phosphatase and protease inhibitors. The protein concentrations of the homogenates were determined using the BCA protein assay method (Pierce, Rockford, IL) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equal amounts of protein (100 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE using 6% acrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes (0.2 μm). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against spinophilin, phospho-Ser-94 spinophilin, phospho-Ser-100 spinophilin, or phospho-Ser-177 spinophilin. Following washes with TBS containing 1% nonfat milk, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, proteins were visualized by incubation with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution, Pierce, Rockford, IL) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) development (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Chemiluminescence was detected by exposure of blots to photographic film, and bands were quantified by analysis of scanned images using Image 1.52 software (National Institutes of Health). Because the linear range for quantification of signal density by the ECL detection method is limited to <10-fold, we routinely exposed chemiluminescent membranes to film for various time periods to obtain signals within the linear range. Data were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test, with significance defined as p < 0.05. Embryonic day 17 rat cerebrocortical or striatal tissue was used to prepare primary cortical and striatal cultures as described (32Gouras G.K., Xu, H. Jovanovic J.N. Buxbaum J.D. Wang R. Greengard P.

Genet. 2001; 10: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Full-length spinophilin was transiently expressed in 293T cells for 36 h following calcium phosphate transfection. Cells were treated with forskolin (50 μm) for 5 min and lysed in 1% SDS containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. Equal amounts of total protein were resolved on 6% acrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting. Actin was prepared from an acetone powder of rabbit skeletal muscle in buffer A (0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm NaN3, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) as described (34Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further purified by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-150 column (35MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). G-actin was polymerized in buffer A containing 2 mmMgCl2/90 mm KCl. Polymerized actin was labeled with Na125I (5 mCi per 2 mg of actin) using IODO-BEADs (Pierce, Rockford, IL). 125I-Labeled actin was purified over a desalting column (d-salt, Pierce, Rockford, IL) and eluted with 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). Membranes were dried for 30 min and blocked in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 90 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were incubated with 125I-labeled actin (50 μg/ml) in blocking buffer containing phalloidin (5 μm,Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) at room temperature without agitation. After 2 h, the blots were briefly washed five times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 90 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20 and dried. Actin binding was quantified using a PhosphorImager 400B and ImageQuaNT software. An anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used to detect the amount of spinophilin in each sample, and immunoreactive protein bands were quantified using 125I-labeled protein A and PhosphorImager analysis. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4) containing 5% nonfat milk, and then incubated with bacterially expressed PP1α (1.5 μg/ml) in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, 15 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% brij-35, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight. After washing twice with TBST containing 0.25% nonfat milk, membranes were probed with an anti-PP1α antibody (1.5 μg/ml in TBST containing 1% nonfat milk (36da Cruz e Silva E. Fox C.A. Ouimet C.C. Gustafson E. Watson S.J. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3375-3389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) for 1 h. Following several washes, proteins were visualized by incubation with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL development. Phosphorylation reactions were performed on a large-scale using purified recombinant spinophilin (3 μm, ∼500 μg) and in the absence or presence of PKA (40–100 μg/ml) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA at 30 °C. Reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP (50 μm). An aliquot of the reaction mixture was incubated in parallel with [γ-32P]ATP for determination of the phosphorylation stoichiometry (1.6 mol/mol phosphorylated approximately equally at Ser-94 and Ser-177). After 1 h, the reaction mixtures were exhaustively dialyzed into 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Immediately prior to the actin sedimentation experiments, proteins were centrifuged at 200,000 ×g for 30 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay method with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The indicated amounts of spinophilin (62.5–1000 nm, 30 μl) were incubated with 1 μm polymerized actin (0.1 nmol actin/sample, 70 μl) for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and loaded onto acrylamide gels. The pelleted actin was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and quantified by laser scanning densitometry. The spinophilin associated with the actin pellet was visualized by autoradiography after immunoblotting with an anti-spinophilin antibody and 125I-labeled secondary antibodies and was quantified by radioactive counting of the excised bands. Samples were incubated in parallel with spinophilin (62.5–1000 nm) in the absence of actin to correct for a small amount of pelleted spinophilin in the background. Standard curves of actin and spinophilin were constructed for each analysis. The striatum of Sprague-Dawley rats was homogenized in ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose, and subcellular fractions were prepared as described (37Jones D.H. Matus A.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. Immunoblots were probed with the indicated antibodies and visualized by ECL development. The amino acid sequence of spinophilin contains consensus phosphorylation sites for several protein kinases, including PKA, protein kinase C, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. To examine whether spinophilin is regulated by phosphorylation in vivo, striatal slices were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and spinophilin was immunoprecipitated. A significant level of basal phosphorylation of spinophilin was detected (Fig. 1 A). Moreover, phosphorylation was increased following treatment with the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, suggesting that spinophilin might be phosphorylated by PKA in vivo. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of spinophilin immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled slices revealed multiple phosphopeptides under basal conditions (Fig. 1 C), as well as the appearance of novel phosphopeptides upon treatment with forskolin (peptides labeled1, 2, and 4, Fig. 1 C). To confirm that PKA directly phosphorylates spinophilin, we performed phosphorylation reactions in vitro using recombinant spinophilin, PKA, and [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylation proceeded in a time-dependent manner and reached a maximal stoichiometry of 2.3 mol/mol within 60 min (Fig. 1 B). The initial rate of phosphorylation was comparable to that of inhibitor-1, a physiological substrate of PKA known to be phosphorylated at a single site. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of spinophilin phosphorylated by PKA to low (1-min incubation) or higher (60-min incubation) stoichiometry revealed the presence of five major phosphopeptides (labeled 1–5, Fig. 1 D). The phosphopeptides phosphorylated in vitro by PKA corresponded to the pattern of phosphopeptides phosphorylated in spinophilin in slices in response to forskolin (Fig. 1 C) (with the exception that peptide 5 could not be detected in spinophilin phosphorylated in slices). Together, these results support the conclusion that PKA phosphorylates spinophilin in vivo at a subset of the total sites phosphorylated in intact cells. Spinophilin contains multiple consensus sites for PKA phosphorylation within its 817-amino acid sequence. No significant phosphorylation was detected using a truncated spinophilin fragment consisting of amino acids 298–817 fused to glutathioneS-transferase. We therefore focused on a region at the amino terminus of spinophilin (amino acids 1–221) that exhibits a high degree of homology with the actin-binding domain in neurabin (18Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abs"
https://openalex.org/W2018379453,"Mouse embryonic stem-derived cells were recently shown to differentiate into endothelial and smooth muscle cells. In the present study, we investigated whether human umbilical vein endothelium-derived cells retain the potential to differentiate into smooth muscle cells. Examination of biochemical markers, including basic calponin, SM22α, prostaglandin E synthase, von Willebrand factor, and PECAM-1, as well as cell contractility, showed that whereas endothelium-derived cells cultured with fibroblast growth factor can be characterized as endothelial cells, when deprived of fibroblast growth factor, a significant fraction differentiates into smooth muscle-like cells. Reapplication of fibroblast growth factor reversed this differentiation. Activin A was up-regulated in fibroblast growth factor-deprived, endothelium-derived cells; moreover, the inhibitory effects of exogenous follistatin and overexpressed Smad7 on smooth muscle-like differentiation confirmed that the differentiation was driven by activin A signaling. These findings indicate that when deprived of fibroblast growth factor, human umbilical vein endothelium-derived cells are capable of differentiating into smooth muscle-like cells through activin A-induced, Smad-dependent signaling, and that maintenance of the endothelial cell phenotype and differentiation into smooth muscle-like cells are reciprocally controlled by fibroblast growth factor-1 and activin A."
https://openalex.org/W2152503709,"Protein kinases play key roles in signal transduction and therefore are among the most attractive targets for drug design. The pharmacological aptitude of protein kinase inhibitors is highlighted by the observation that various diseases with special reference to cancer are because of the abnormal expression/activity of individual kinases.

Nat. Rev. Drug Disc. 2002; 1: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). Actually, abnormal activity of individual protein kinases is often associated with human diseases, especially tumors whose treatment has been so far restricted to cytotoxic and hormonal agents (2Goel S. Mani S. Perez Soler R. Curr. Oncol. Rep. 2002; 4: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Many kinase inhibitors are currently in clinical trials, mostly as anti-tumor drugs (1Cohen P. Nat. Rev. Drug Disc. 2002; 1: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar, 3Fabbro D. Parkinson D. Matter A. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and two of them, Gleevec (STI-571) and rapamycin, are in clinical use for the treatment of a form of leukemia and to prevent tissue rejection after organ transplantation, respectively. One major problem with kinase inhibitors is that the human genome encodes for >500 different protein kinases; therefore, inhibitors designed to target specifically an individual kinase are likely to bind to closely related kinases as well, thus interfering with other cell functions. In addition, the most promising inhibitors are directed to the highly conserved ATP binding site with the consequence that their selectivity is hardly absolute, and they have to compete against high intracellular concentrations of ATP. In this respect, peptide inhibitors directed to the phosphoacceptor substrate binding site may in principle display higher specificity. Their pharmacological utilization, however, is hampered by a number of practical drawbacks, primarily reduced bioavailability. Many of the chemical scaffolds or building blocks studied as ATP site-directed kinase inhibitors are based on more or less complex heterocyclic molecules (mainly with nitrogen and oxygen as heteroatoms). The most common scaffolds are derivatives of the following: quinazolines; phenylamino-pyrimidines, pyrido-pyrimidines, pyrrolo-pyrimidines, pyrimido-pyrimidines, or pyrazolo-pyrimidines; pyrrolo-pyridines; indolin-2-ones; purines; pyridinyl-imidazoles or pyrimidinyl-imidazoles; and phthalazines. Other examples are natural products such as balanol and alkaloids, flavopiridol (belonging to the flavonoid family), and staurosporine and its derivatives (4Garcia Echeverria C. Traxler P. Evans D.B. Med. Res. Rev. 2000; 20: 28-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Besides the traditional medicinal chemistry and the relatively new combinatorial approaches (with the employment of high throughput screenings on molecules libraries), the solution of the crystal structure of complexes between an individual kinase and its inhibitors also represents a powerful tool for the discovery of new drugs by a rational drug design approach. In fact, the structural bases for selectivity and potency are now being clarified by means of crystallization of a number of such targets in complex with inhibitors (5Toledo L.M. Lydon N.B. Elbaum D. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 775-805PubMed Google Scholar). A telling example is that of Cdk2 whose crystal structures in complex with a number of ligands have been exploited to design more potent and selective inhibitors (6Hardcastle I.R. Golding B.T. Griffin R.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 325-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Davis S.T. Benson B.G. Bramson H.N. Chapman D.E. Dickerson S.H. Dold K.M. Eberwein D.J.

It is now a common exercise to run a virtual screen of thousands low molecular weight compounds on the crystal structure of a kinase in complex with an inhibitor with the aim to identify the most promising chemical scaffolds to develop (9Stahura F.L. Xue L. Godden J.W. Bajorath J. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1999; 17: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The progress made in the crystallization of protein kinases has corroborated the concept that the ATP-binding domain is an attractive target for drug design. Three successful examples of drug design using a tyrosine kinase as a molecular target are the following: 1) PKI166, a pyrrolo[2,3,-d]pyrimidine derivative that inhibits both epidermal growth factor receptor and ErbB2 kinases, 2) the anilino-phthalazine derivative PTK787/ZK222584, a potent and selective inhibitor of the kinase domain receptor and Flt-1 kinases, and 3) the aforementioned STI-571 (10Traxler P. Bold G. Buchdunger E. Caravatti G. Furet P. Manley P. O'Reilly T. Wood J. Zimmermann J. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 499-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). CK21 (an acronym derived from the misnomer “casein kinase-2”) is one of the most pleiotropic protein kinases with hundreds of protein substrates involved in a variety of cellular functions with special reference to signaling, nuclear organization, and gene expression (11Pinna L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3873-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). An intriguing hallmark of CK2 is the high constitutive activity, which is believed to underlie its pathogenic potential (12Tawfic S., Yu, S. Wang H. Faust R. Davis A. Ahmed K. Histol. Histopathol. 2001; 16: 573-582PubMed Google Scholar). Although there are no known mutations of CK2 associated with neoplasia, CK2 is abnormally elevated in a wide variety of tumors and there are several experimental models where the unscheduled expression of the catalytic subunits of CK2 cooperates with the altered expression of proto-oncogene or tumor suppressors to promote cell transformation and neoplastic growth (13Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 14Kelliher M.A. Seldin D.C. Leder P.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2965-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Because of its constitutive activity, CK2 is also exploited by many viruses to phosphorylate proteins essential to their life cycle. This has triggered an increasing interest for CK2 inhibitors that could act as anti-neoplastic and anti-infectious drugs. Although CK2 is essential to viability, it is conceivable that, as pointed out in the case of the MAPK cascade (1Cohen P. Nat. Rev. Drug Disc. 2002; 1: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar), its essential roles in proliferation and differentiation are required only at individual developmental stages, a circumstance that would make applicable a transient pharmacological treatment with CK2 inhibitors. Our interest has been recently focused on CK2 inhibitors belonging to the anthraquinone (17Battistutta R. Sarno S., De Moliner E. Papinutto E. Zanotti G. Pinna L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29618-29622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and xanthenone families. Anthraquinones have been used for the purification of proteins by affinity techniques taking advantage of their nucleotide-specific ligand capability (18Bohacova V. Docolomansky P. Breier A. Gemeiner P. Ziegelhoffer A. J. Chromatogr. 1998; 715: 273-281Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This enables them to interact with ATP, ADP, and NAD binding sites of enzymes such as dehydrogenases, kinases, and ATPases. Anthraquinone and xanthenone derivatives often obtained from natural sources have several potential therapeutic applications for instance as antiviral, antimicrobial, or anti-cancer drugs (19Ali A.M. Ismail N.H. Mackenn M.M. Yazan L.S. Mohamed S.M., Ho, A.S.H. Lajis N.H. Pharm. Biol. 2000; 38: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A potential drawback of these compounds is that their cyclic planar structure confers them the feature of DNA-intercalators with expectable cytotoxic effects. Even with this limit, the optimization of highly specific and selective inhibitors of this category could be exploited for the elucidation of the still somewhat enigmatic cellular functions of CK2. Another important benefit of the improvement of the inhibition potency and selectivity of anthraquinone and xanthone derivatives is the rationalization of the effect of different substituents on a common scaffold in order to draw information regarding their effects on the interaction energies involved in target binding. This sort of information is useful for the optimization of the force fields used in drug design and docking studies. Here we present the crystal structure of three different complexes of maize CK2α (70% identical to its human homologue and almost 100% conserved in the catalytic core) with two anthraquinone derivatives and one related xanthenone. The three inhibitors studied whose chemical formulae and K i values with CK2 are shown in Fig. 1 are: 1,8-dihydroxy-4-nitro-anthraquinone (MNA), 1,8-dihydroxy-4-nitro-xanthen-9-one (MNX), and 1,4-diamino-5,8-dihydroxy-anthraquinone (DAA). These compounds were selected from a panel of many anthraquinones and xanthenones because of their relatively low K i values and ability to originate diffracting quality crystals in co-crystallization trials. A relevant issue we also wanted to address was the rationalization of the higher inhibitory efficiency of these molecules as compared with another inhibitor of the anthraquinone family, emodin (also shown in Fig. 1), whose crystal structure in complex with CK2 has previously been solved (17Battistutta R.

Emodin (3-methyl-1,6,8-trihydroxyantraquinone) is extracted from the medicinal herb Rheum palmatum and has been used for a long time in the Orient to cure inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. Our studies will provide hints on how to improve the efficiency and selectivity of emodin-related compounds toward CK2 and possibly other protein kinases. The catalytic α subunit of Zea mays CK2 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to a method described previously (20Battistutta R., De Moliner E. Sarno S. Zanotti G. Pinna L.A. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2200-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The crystals of the three inhibitor-enzyme complexes with MNA, MNX, and DAA were obtained by co-crystallization with the sitting drop vapor-diffusion technique. The synthesis and characterization of the three inhibitors are described elsewhere. 2S. Moro, S. Bosio, D. Dal Ben, E. De Moliner, R. Battistutta, G. Zanotti, F. Meggio, L. A. Pinna, and G. Zagotto, submitted for publication. The 8-mg/ml protein stock solution was preincubated with 100 mminhibitor solution (100% Me2SO) in the proper amount to have an inhibitor-protein molar ratio of 3 to 1 and not to exceed a 5% Me2SO concentration in the final protein solution. Crystallization trials were made by mixing a 2-μl drop of preincubated stock solution with 4 μl of water and 2 μl of precipitant solution (10–20% PEG 4000, sodium acetate 0.2m, Tris 0.1 m, pH 8.0). The drop was equilibrated against a 500-μl reservoir of the same precipitant solution (20% PEG 4000). Crystals grew in few days at 293 K. Data were collected at a temperature of 100 K. Before mounting, crystals were cryoprotected by soaking in a 40% PEG 4000 solution of the precipitation buffer. For the MNA complex, a data set was measured at the x-ray diffraction beamline of ELETTRA synchrotron facility on a Mar CCD detector at a wavelength of 1.2 Å and at a crystal to detector distance of 115 mm. The completeness of the data set is 90.7% at a maximum resolution of 2.0 Å. Data sets of MNX and DAA complexes were collected at the beamline ID-29 of the ESRF on a Quantum4 CCD detector at a wavelength of 0.918 Å and with a crystal to detector distance of 190 mm. The completeness of the data sets for the two complexes is 87.6 and 89.7% at a maximum resolution of 1.8 and 1.7 Å, respectively. All the three crystals of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes belong to the space group C2 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit in analogy with the emodin complex and the apoenzyme structures published previously (17Battistutta R.

It is worth noticing that the b-cell parameter and the β angle are different for MNA crystal with respect to MNX and DAA (see below), which implies a different Matthews coefficient:V M is 2.08 Å3 Da−1 for MNX and DAA against a V M of 2.40 Å3Da−1 for MNA. In addition, the solvent content is different: 41% in MNX and DAA complexes and 49% in MNA. Data were indexed with MOSFLM (22Leslie A.G.W. Moras D. Podjarny A.D. Thierry J.P. Crystallographic Computing V. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1991: 27-38Google Scholar) and then scaled with SCALA from the CCP4 software package (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). To solve the three new structures, a rigid body transformation on the model of the apoenzyme was adequate using the CNS software package (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Some of the MNA reflections were affected by systematic errors because of the presence of ice rings and therefore were excluded from the set. The presence of the inhibitor in the active site was clear since the beginning of the refinement in both F o − F c and 2F o − F c maps for all of the three compounds. The electron density for the position of the nitro group was clear for MNX, whereas it was ambiguous for MNA, suggesting a double orientation for this inhibitor in the active site. Because of the symmetry of DAA, the assignment of the hydroxyl or amino groups of the inhibitor H-bonded to the protein was made on the basis of the H-bonds length (longer for an NH acceptor than for an OH one) and on the results of DAA binding simulations (see below). The definition files for the inhibitors were initially created by Hic-Up (25Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) corrected with the adequate parameters and used in CNS in the whole refinement procedure that was carried out alternating automated cycles and manual inspection steps using the graphic program QUANTA (26Accelrys Inc. QUANTA Molecular Modeling Package, release 98.1111. Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA1986Google Scholar). During the final steps of the refinement, water molecules were added and the stereochemistry was checked with the program Procheck (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Statistics on data collection and final models are reported in Table I. The final model for the complex with the MNA inhibitor presents an overall crystallographic R-factor of 22.2 (R free 24.3) with 177 water molecules and a good stereochemistry with no residues in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. For the complexes with MNX and DAA, theR-factors are 19.8 (R free 23.3) and 19.0 (R free 21.6), respectively, with 161 and 205 final water molecules and no residues with disallowed stereochemistry.Table IData collection and final model statistics1-aNumbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution bin.MNAMNXDAASpace groupC2C2C2a, b, c (Å)142.09, 60.55, 44.98143.04, 51.73, 44.70143.11, 51.83, 44.71α, β, γ (°)90.0, 102.84, 90.090.0, 99.33, 90.090.0, 99.65, 90.0Solvent content49%41%41%Max resolution (Å)2.0 (2.09)1.79 (1.9)1.70 (1.79)Independent reflections22,959 (2788)26,331 (2204)32,021 (2851)Multiplicity2.4 (2.1)3.7 (3.5)3.2 (2.1)〈I/ς〉3.4 (2.4)4.6 (3.0)4.0 (4.1)R merge0.12 (0.26)0.08 (0.20)0.09 (0.09)Completeness (%)90.7 (88.5)87.6 (50.2)89.7 (55.2)Final modelsMNAMNXDAAProtein atoms271427282728R/R free22.2/24.319.8/23.319.0/21.6r.m.s. on distances (Å)0.0070.0080.006r.m.s. on angles (°)1.201.401.261-a Numbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution bin. Open table in a new tab Calculations were performed on a Silicon Graphics Octane R12000 work station. The ground state geometry of charged and uncharged docked structures was fully optimized without geometry constraints using Restricted Hartree-Fock/3−21G ab initio calculations. Vibrational frequency analysis was used to characterize the minimal stationary points (zero imaginary frequencies). The software package Spartan O2 was utilized for all quantum mechanical calculations (28Wave function (2002) Spartan O2, Wavefunction Inc., Irvine, CAGoogle Scholar). Because not all x-ray crystallographic files contain hydrogen atoms, they were added to the protein by using the MOE modeling suite (29Molecular Operating Environment (2002) MOE 2002.03, Chemical Computing Group, Inc, Quebec, CanadaGoogle Scholar) before carrying out docking studies. To minimize contacts among hydrogens, the structures were subjected to a Amber94 (30Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11375) Google Scholar) energy minimization protocol until the root mean square of conjugate gradient was <0.15 kcal mol−1 Å−1, keeping the heavy atoms fixed at their crystallographic positions. All anthraquinone derivatives were docked into both intercalation sites using flexible MOE-Dock methodology. The purpose of the MOE-Dock procedure is to search for favorable binding configurations between a small flexible ligand and a rigid macromolecular target. The search is carried out within a user-specified three-dimensional docking box using the Tabù Search protocol (31Baxter C.A. Murray C.W. Clark D.E. Westhead D.R. Eldridge M.D. Proteins. 1998; 33: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and the MMFF94 force field (32Halgren T.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1996; 17: 490-519Crossref Scopus (4133) Google Scholar, 33Halgren T.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1996; 17: 520-552Crossref Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 34Halgren T.A. J. Comput.

MOE-Dock performs a user-specified number of independent docking runs (50 in our case) and writes the resulting conformations and their energies to a molecular data base file. The resulting docked complexes were subjected to a MMFF94 energy minimization protocol until the root mean square of the conjugate gradient was <0.1 kcal mol−1Å−1. The charges for the ligands were imported from the Spartan output files. To model the solvent effects more directly, corrections for the electrostatic interactions were used. The MOE suite utilized includes an implemented version of generalized born/surface area contact function (39Qiu D. Shenkin S. Hollinger F.P. Still W.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1997; 101: 3005-3017Crossref Scopus (907) Google Scholar) that models the electrostatic contribution to the free energy of solvation in a continuum solvent model. The interaction energy values were calculated as the energy of the complex minus the energy of the ligand minus the energy of protein: ΔEinter = E(complex) − (E(L) + E(protein)). Apparent pK a values of all anthraquinone and xanthenone derivatives were theoretically calculated by using ACD/pKa DB (version 6.0) software (40Advanced Chemistry Development, Inc. ACD/pKa DB, Version 6.0. Advanced Chemistry Development Inc., Ontario, Canada2001Google Scholar). Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the following accession codes: 1M2P (for MNA·CK2 complex); 1M2Q (for MNX·CK2 complex); and 1M2R (for DAA·CK2 complex). The optimization of a co-crystallization protocol for inhibitors MNA, MNX, and DAA allowed data collections with a maximal resolution higher than that obtained by soaking methods used in the case of emodin and TBB complexes (2.63 and 2.19 Å, respectively) (17Battistutta R. Sarno S., De Moliner E. Papinutto E. Zanotti G. Pinna L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29618-29622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Battistutta R., De Moliner E. Sarno S. Zanotti G. Pinna L.A. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2200-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The new protocol consists of a preincubation for 1–2 h of the protein with the inhibitor dissolved in Me2SO (final Me2SO concentration ≤5%) and then the set up of the crystal trials as described under “Experimental Procedures.” With this new procedure, we could collect data at 2.0-Å resolution for MNA, 1.79-Å resolution for MNX, and 1.70-Å resolution for DAA. It may be interesting to note that the CK2 complexes crystallized so far are not perfectly isomorphous. As outlined in TableI, although the differences in thea and c axis lengths can be considered within the experimental errors, axis b varies from 59.5 ± 1 Å (with ATP or MNA bound and in the apo-form) to 52.2 ± 0.5 Å (in the case of emodin, MNX, and DAA). This change is coupled with an adjustment in the β angle from 103.0 ± 0.5 to 90.5 ± 0.2° and a decrease of the solvent content from 49 to 41%. From the analysis of the final three-dimensional structures, we have noted that these variations reflect two different conformations of the protein loop between β strand 4 and 5 (residues 102–108) (Fig. 2). This segment has a bent conformation with the short b axis and an extended one with the stretchedb axis. This is the only evident structural difference between the two diverse groups of cell parameters, and it involves a shrink in the crystal packing roughly along the b axis. One possible explanation is that high PEG concentrations (≥30%) as precipitating agent or glycerol as cryoprotectant are responsible of the cell shrinkage. A direct implication of the different inhibitors located ∼20 Å far away from the 102–108 loop is hardly conceivable. As expected by analogy with emodin, the three inhibitors bind in the co-substrate binding cavity of CK2 between the N- and C-terminal lobes in the proximity of the Gly-rich loop (Fig. 2). As already noted (20Battistutta R., De Moliner E. Sarno S. Zanotti G. Pinna L.A. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2200-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the C-terminal domain of the kinase is quite rigid, whereas the N-terminal one is more inclined to alterations induced by the presence of different ligands. A noteworthy exception is helix αC that is conformationally very well conserved in all structures solved until now. Among the three complexes described here, the one with MNX shows the greatest variation in the N-terminal domain with special reference to the positions of the backbone between residues 72 and 75 and of the Gly-rich loop (residues 45–51). The latter collapses into the co-substrate binding cavity, but this movement is not accompanied by the rotation of His-160 and Asn-118 side chains as in the case of the emodin complex (17Battistutta R. Sarno S., De Moliner E. Papinutto E. Zanotti G. Pinna L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29618-29622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The orientation and precise location of MNA and MNX differ from that of emodin, which enters the active site with hydroxyl groups 1 and 8 on the side of the hinge region. In contrast, both MNA and MNX penetrate with the nitro group oriented toward the hinge region, and consequently, the hydroxyl groups make contacts with Lys-68. The structures of MNA and MNX in the active site are fully superimposable (Fig. 3). Emodin and TBB bind to the protein mainly through hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions. In the case of MNX and MNA, additional polar interactions between the inhibitors and the active site of the enzyme contribute both to increase the affinity as indicated by the lower K ivalues and to orient the molecules in a different way. In MNA, the nitro group is not co-planar with the aromatic rings because of the steric hindrance of the adjacent carbonyl (ortho effect). In fact, in our structure, the nitro group is roughly perpendicular to the ring plane. The two hydroxyl groups and the carbonyl of the same side are involved in four hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Asp-175 and Lys-68 and a water molecule (Fig. 4). The latter is also bound to Glu-81 and Trp-176 as in the other CK2 complexes presented here. The nitro group is preferentially oriented toward the opening of the binding pocket (0.67 occupancy), but it is also present in the depth of the cavity (0.33 occupancy); therefore, MNA was refined with a double conformation with final B-factors of 32.3 and 33.8, respectively. A similar network of interaction is present also in the case of MNX (Fig. 4) with a notable difference that the nitro group is found only in the inner position. In this case, the nitro group is co-planar with the aromatic plane because there is no steric hindrance by carbonyls. From the analysis of the crystal structures of MNA and MNX complexes, the nitro group does not seem to play a direct role in the recognition process between the ligand and the protein. In fact, no essential direct chemical interactions between the nitro group and the protein binding cavity are detectable. Nevertheless, in the absence of the nitro group as in the cases of 1,8-dihydroxy-anthraquinone and 1,8-dihydroxy-xanthen-9-one, the inhibitory constantsK i rise to values higher than 40 μm. These results outline the relevance of the nitro group in enhancing the potency of anthraquinone derivative inhibitory activity as also confirmed by the higher IC50 of the chrysophanic acid (>40 μm) compared with the nitro derivative (0.30 μm) (41Sarno S. Moro S. Meggio F. Zagotto G. Dal Ben D. Ghisellini P. Battistutta R. Zanotti G. Pinna L.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 93: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A probable explanation is that the nitro group in paraposition considerably increases the dissociation constant of the phenolic hydroxyl group because of an electron-withdrawing effect and thereby stabilizes the negative charge on the oxygen. The formation of the monoanionic state can drastically modify several chemical and biochemical properties of both compounds including solubility, chemical reactivity, and molecular recognition. To better investigate this point using the additive Hammett-type equation method implemented by ACD/pKa DB software, we theoretically calculated the acid ionization constants of both 1,8-dihydroxy-anthraquinone and 1,8-dihydroxy-xanthen-9-one and of the corresponding 4-nitro-substituted derivatives (Fig. 1). As experimentally demonstrated (42Wang D. Yang G. Song X. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the first dissociation constant of both 1,8-dihydroxy-anthraquinone and 1,8-dihydroxy-xanthen-9-one is at least three orders of magnitude lower than that of phenol itself (pK a = 10.0). The presence of the nitro group further reduces the first pK a value. In the case of the anthraquinone derivative, the pK a1value is 5.3, whereas for the xanthenone derivative, the value is 4.8 because of the resonance effect that is not possible in anthraquinones. At physiological pH, both nitro derivatives should be present, at least partially, in their monoanionic forms. To better understand the role of the monoanionic species in the CK2 recognition process, a molecular docking study has been performed starting from our CK2 crystallographic coordinates (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the case of MNX- and MNA-monoanionic derivatives, the energetically most stable and statistically most representative docked conformation is extremely close to the MNX crystallographic structures with the nitro group located only in the inner position and with the negatively charged oxygen at position 1 near to the positive side chain of Lys-68 (see Fig. 5). This result can support the hypothesis that if the monoanionic form is present, it can bind CK2 with high efficiency. In this case, the strong electrostatic interaction between Lys-68 and the monoanionic form seems to play a crucial role in the recognition process. However, considering the neutral form of both MNX and MNA compounds, the modeling procedure sampled two different families of docked conformations: the first one as observed for the monoanionic form with the nitro group located in the inner position and the protonated phenolic oxygen at position 1 close to the positive side chain of Lys-68; and the second one exactly in the opposite configuration with the nitro group located in the external position and the hydroxyl group at position 1 close to the negative side chain of Asp-175. The second one appears to be thermodynamically more stable (∼9 kcal mol−1) because of the formation of a strong hydrogen bond between the hydroxy group at position 1 of the anthraquinone structure and the negatively charged carboxyl group of Asp-175. This prediction is in good agreement with the crystal structure of the MNA·CK2 complex (see Fig. 5). These data indicate that the neutral and the monoanionic forms bind to the CK2 recognition cavity using a different network of stabilizing interactions, depending on the ionization capabilities of inhibitors. This can generate at least two different configurations inside the binding pocket. Considering the increase of the first pK a of MNA due to the orthoeffect, we can speculate that MNA is present in solution both as a neutral and monoanionic form and that both can fit the CK2 binding cavity whose local pH can be different from that of the external solvent. In addition, the equilibrium between the two conformations of MNA inside the cavity can also be affected by steric contributions because of non-favorable contacts between the nitro group in the inner location and Ile-66 and Val-116. In the case of DAA where the dissociation constant of hydroxyl groups is not affected by the presence of any nitro function, the binding mode is different (Figs. 3 and 4). DAA binds into the enzyme co-substrate pocket on the side of the hinge region, making two specific H-bonds with backbone carbonyls of Glu-114 and Val-116, which are also responsible for interactions with the adenine moiety of bound ATP (21Niefind K. Putter M. Guerra B. Issinger O.G. Schomburg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1100-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This specific binding mode confers to DAA the lowestK i value (0.35 μm) among anthraquinone inhibitors tested so far. In summary, the four anthraquinone derivatives analyzed so far display, despite their common scaffold, three significantly different modes of binding into the active site of CK2: (a) anchoring to the hinge region (DAA); (b) anchoring to Lys-68 and Asp-175 albeit with different orientations (MNA and MNX); and (c) sitting in the middle of the cavity with no strong polar interactions (emodin). These three binding modalities correlate with a gradual increase in the K i value from (a) (0.35 μm) to (c) (1.85 μm). Based on this information, a strategy to improve the affinity to CK2 could be to design new molecules able to fill the entire cavity and therefore to interact on both sides, with the hinge region on one hand and Lys-68/Asp-175 on the other. However, a complication arises from the fact that DAA lies on the same plane of the ATP adenosine moiety,i.e. slightly tilted with respect of the other three anthraquinone inhibitors (as shown in Fig. 3). This difficulty could be overcome by replacing the hydroxyl group of the DAA scaffold with more extended flexible chains bearing hydroxylated and/or negatively charged functions.

It derives from the precore protein, which is encoded by the PreC/C gene. The function of HBeAg and/or its precursors during the course of infection is still enigmatic, although conservation of a similar e antigen among all of the members of the hepadnavirus family argues for an important role of at least one of these proteins in the viral life cycle. Even though a role for infectivity or viral multiplication has been ruled out (1Tong S. Diot C. Gripon P., Li, J. Vitvitski L. Trépo C. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Virology. 1991; 181: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), several reports have nevertheless brought circumstantial evidences that the PreC/C gene products could be involved in the establishment of persistent infection (2Ou J.-H. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1997; 12: S178-S187Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Most of the synthetic pathway of HBeAg is now clearly established (2Ou J.-H. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1997; 12: S178-S187Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The precore protein (Fig. 1) is co-translationally directed to the secretory pathway by a 19-amino acid signal peptide. The latter is cleaved during translocation of the nascent chain into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The 22-kDa resulting protein (named P22) is 193 amino acids long and is further processed into mature HBeAg. The same biosynthetic pathway has been described for both the Duck Hepatitis B virus e antigen and the Woodchuck hepatitis virus e antigen (3Schlicht H.-J. Salfeld J. Schaller H. J.

Imai M. Nakamura T. Miyakawa Y. Mayumi M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 2903-2907PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the C-terminal extremity of the secreted HBeAg was located at position 149 (see Fig. 1), leading to the conclusion that the mature HBeAg was obtained by the cleavage of the last 34 amino acids from the P22 C terminus. Indeed, very little is known about the protease involved in this process, except that a proteolytic self-cleavage of P22 is excluded (6Jean-Jean O. Salhi S. Carlier D. Elie C., De Recondo A.-M. Rossignol J.-M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5497-5500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that a proprotein convertase is involved in the maturation of P22 (7Gil-Torregrosa B.C. Castano A.R. Del Val M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, neither the exact nature of the protease nor the cleavage sites have been determined. This led us to study these points to get new insights in the mechanism of P22 processing and thus complete our understanding of the process of HBeAg synthesis.Furin is a transmembrane proprotein convertase localized in thetrans-Golgi network (TGN), transported to the plasma membrane and then retrieved back through the endocytic pathway (8Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence for furin cleavage is RX(K/R)R, both arginine residues at positions P1 and P4 being absolutely required, giving the minimal furin cleavage site RXXR (9Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). However in some cases, an alternate sequence 6 amino acids long with at least two basic residues of three at positions P6, P4, or P2, in addition to the P1 can also constitute a competent furin cleavage site (8Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 9Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Interestingly, six potential furin cleavage sites can be found in the 34-amino acid C-terminal domain of P22 (Fig. 1): two consensus cleavage sites (RXRR), two minimal cleavage sites (RXXR), and two alternate 6-amino acid sequences (RXRXXR and RXXRR).The studies presented here show that the furin protease cleaves P22 at two positions within the C-terminal domain: one cleavage generating a processing intermediate (P20) and the other one generating the HBeAg. Our data also demonstrate that the removal of the P22 C terminus, which occurs mainly in the TGN, can also be achieved after exocytosis. In addition, we show that in our experimental system HBeAg is a 164-amino acid protein, in contradiction with the previous result published by Takahashi et al. (5Takahashi K. Machida A. Funatsu G. Nomura M. Usuda S. Aoyagi S. Tachibana K. Miyamoto H. Imai M. Nakamura T. Miyakawa Y. Mayumi M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 2903-2907PubMed Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn this report, we present new data on the last unresolved steps of HBeAg biosynthesis. Our studies established that two endoproteolytic cleavages occur during P22 maturation, one cleavage giving rise to a 177-amino acid intermediate (P20) and the other generating the 164-amino acid mature HBeAg. It should be noted that these two proteolytic events are independent. In other words, the maturation of the HBeAg does not require the prior formation of the P20 intermediate. This is clearly demonstrated by our experiments in which mutated precursors that cannot produce P20 are not impaired in the HBeAg secretion. Using a specific inhibitor and P22 molecules bearing mutated cleavage motifs, we also provide evidence that these endoproteolytic cleavages are due to a member of the proprotein convertase family, most likely the furin.Seven proteases belonging to the mammalian proprotein convertase (PC) family have been so far identified: furin/PACE, PC1/PC3, PC2, PC4, PACE 4, PC5/PC6, and LPC/PC7/PC8/SPC7 (see Refs. 9Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar and 17Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar for reviews). All PCs typically cleave their substrates on the C-terminal side of arginine residues. In contrast, they have different tissue distribution. Expression of PC2 and PC1/PC3 is limited to neuroendocrine tissues, whereas that of PC4 is highly restricted to testicular spermatogenic cells. In contrast, furin, PACE4, PC5/PC6, and LPC/PC7/PC8/SPC7 are expressed in a broad range of tissues and cell lines (9Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Thus, with the exception of PC5/PC6, which is not present in the TGN (9Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), we assume that these three ubiquitous proteases could be responsible for the proteolytic processing of P22 into HBeAg.In our experimental system, HBeAg can be generated in one step, by a cleavage at the C-terminal side of Arg154. That this cleavage is caused by the furin is supported by two complementary results. First, we have shown that HBeAg can be generated in the TGN or in the extracellular medium, implying that the processing enzyme is present in the TGN as well as at the cell surface or secreted. This is one of the features of furin, which cycles between the TGN and the plasmic membrane and which is also secreted in an active form (8Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 17Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar,18Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Second, furin is the only member of the PC family that does not have a strong requirement for a basic residue in position P2 (9Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 19van de Loo J.-W.H.P. Creemers J.W.M. Bright N.A. Young B.D. Roebroek A.J.M. Van de Ven W.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27116-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and consequently is able to recognize a motif as151RRGR154. The situation is less clear for the generation of P20 that arises in the TGN compartment. Because a basic residue is present at position P2 in the motif164RRRR167, other members of the PC family that are known to be present in the TGN, namely PACE4 and LPC/PC7/PC8/SPC7 may also be involved in the cleavage of P22 at position 167. However, the fact that P20 was generated in a cell line (HEK 293, data not shown) devoid of PACE4 (20Mains R.E. Berard C.A. Denault J.-B. Zhou A. Johnson R.C. Leduc R. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) is not in favor of the involvement of this enzyme in the generation of P20. On the other hand, LPC/PC7/PC8/SPC7 recognizes usually a 6-amino acid sequence, a property that does not support a role of this protease in the processing of P22. Taken together, those arguments strongly suggest that furin is the PC that cleaves P22 at position 167, leading to P20. However, the involvement of LPC/PC7/PC8/SPC7 or PACE 4 cannot be totally excluded. To overcome this problem, LoVo cells unable to produce functional furin were used (21Takahashi S. Kasai K. Hatsuzawa K. Kitamura N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the low efficiency of transfection obtained with this cell line did not allow us to draw a clear conclusion. It is worth noting that four of six putative furin sites were not cleaved. This cannot be explained by the nature of P′1 and P′2 residues, which are neither a lysine nor a hydrophobic residue, a characteristic reported to impede proper cleavage by furin (22Watanabe T. Nakagawa T. Ikemizu J. Nagahama M. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8270-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lazure C. Gauthier D. Jean F. Boudreault A. Seidah N.G. Bennett H.P.J. Hendy G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8572-8580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A possible explanation could be the nonaccessibility of some putative cleavage sites to the protease that could either be caused by to the folding of P22 or to the presence of cellular proteins that interact with its C-terminal domain. We have previously reported two such proteins which interact specifically with the C-terminal domain of P22 (12Salhi S. Messageot F. Carlier D. Jean-Jean O. Rossignol J.-M. J. Viral. Hepat. 2001; 8: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Messageot F. Carlier D. Rossignol J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18594-18598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).The next question is: what could be the function of P20 in the life cycle of HBV? One hypothesis derives directly from our previously reported data (10Carlier D. Jean-Jean O. Fouillot N. Will H. Rossignol J.-M. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1041-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Messageot F. Carlier D. Rossignol J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18594-18598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We have shown that the P22 C-terminal domain plays an important role during the intracellular transport of P22 through the secretory pathway, because a sequence located between amino acids 144 and 165 is required for an efficient HBeAg secretion via an interaction with a cellular tunicamycin-sensitive protein named TSP (24Messageot F. Carlier D. Rossignol J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18594-18598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Consequently, it could be envisaged that TSP would interact with a precursor of the HBeAg shorter than P22, like P20, which ends at Arg167. Other experiments will be required to conclude about this point.In our experimental system, our results strongly indicate that the HBeAg ends at Arg154 instead of Val149, as previously reported by Takahashi et al. (5Takahashi K. Machida A. Funatsu G. Nomura M. Usuda S. Aoyagi S. Tachibana K. Miyamoto H. Imai M. Nakamura T. Miyakawa Y. Mayumi M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 2903-2907PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is worth noting that these authors have determined the C terminus of the HBeAg purified from patient's sera whereas we have studied the generation of HBeAg in cell culture. Therefore, it could be speculated that another proteolytic event arises in the sera of infected patients. For instance, in the case of pro-hormone processing, a carboxypeptidase removes one or two basic residues after the cleavage by the proprotein-convertase (18Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). However, this second proteolytic event always occurs in the secretory pathway, implying that only the mature hormone is secreted. Although we cannot exclude that another proteolytic event occurs in the patient's sera during the HBeAg processing, our hypothesis is supported by previous results of Salfeld and co-workers (25Salfeld J. Pfaff E. Noah M. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 798-808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These authors have studied the HBeAg isolated from patients infected by the adw subtype of HBV that encode the sequence 146TTVVDSRRRGR156 instead of the classical 146TTVVRRRGR154 sequence. Interestingly, they reported that the adw HBeAg has a slower migration than the ayw HBeAg. This observation is not consistent with TTVV149 as the C-terminal extremity of the HBeAg but rather favors of our hypothesis. Becasue our results have been reproduced in two independent cell lines (COS-7 and HEK 293), demonstrating that they was not due to the specificity of COS-7 cells, we suggest that HBeAg actually ends at position 154 in vivo. The hepatitis B virus (HBV)1 e antigen (HBeAg) is a 17-kDa protein secreted into the serum of patients infected with wild-type HBV. It derives from the precore protein, which is encoded by the PreC/C gene. The function of HBeAg and/or its precursors during the course of infection is still enigmatic, although conservation of a similar e antigen among all of the members of the hepadnavirus family argues for an important role of at least one of these proteins in the viral life cycle. Even though a role for infectivity or viral multiplication has been ruled out (1Tong S. Diot C. Gripon P., Li, J. Vitvitski L. Trépo C. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Virology. 1991; 181: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), several reports have nevertheless brought circumstantial evidences that the PreC/C gene products could be involved in the establishment of persistent infection (2Ou J.-H. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1997; 12: S178-S187Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Most of the synthetic pathway of HBeAg is now clearly established (2Ou J.-H. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1997; 12: S178-S187Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The precore protein (Fig. 1) is co-translationally directed to the secretory pathway by a 19-amino acid signal peptide. The latter is cleaved during translocation of the nascent chain into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The 22-kDa resulting protein (named P22) is 193 amino acids long and is further processed into mature HBeAg. The same biosynthetic pathway has been described for both the Duck Hepatitis B virus e antigen and the Woodchuck hepatitis virus e antigen (3Schlicht H.-J. Salfeld J. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3701-3709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Carlier D. Jean-Jean O. Rossignol J.-M. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In 1983, Takahashi and co-workers (5Takahashi K. Machida A. Funatsu G. Nomura M. Usuda S. Aoyagi S. Tachibana K. Miyamoto H. Imai M. Nakamura T. Miyakawa Y. Mayumi M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 2903-2907PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the C-terminal extremity of the secreted HBeAg was located at position 149 (see Fig. 1), leading to the conclusion that the mature HBeAg was obtained by the cleavage of the last 34 amino acids from the P22 C terminus. Indeed, very little is known about the protease involved in this process, except that a proteolytic self-cleavage of P22 is excluded (6Jean-Jean O. Salhi S. Carlier D. Elie C., De Recondo A.-M. Rossignol J.-M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5497-5500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that a proprotein convertase is involved in the maturation of P22 (7Gil-Torregrosa B.C. Castano A.R. Del Val M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, neither the exact nature of the protease nor the cleavage sites have been determined. This led us to study these points to get new insights in the mechanism of P22 processing and thus complete our understanding of the process of HBeAg synthesis. Furin is a transmembrane proprotein convertase localized in thetrans-Golgi network (TGN), transported to the plasma membrane and then retrieved back through the endocytic pathway (8Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence for furin cleavage is RX(K/R)R, both arginine residues at positions P1 and P4 being absolutely required, giving the minimal furin cleavage site RXXR (9Nakayama K. Biochem.

In contrast, furin, PACE4, PC5/PC6, and LPC/PC7/PC8/SPC7 are expressed in a broad range of tissues and cell lines (9Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Thus, with the exception of PC5/PC6, which is not present in the TGN (9Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), we assume that these three ubiquitous proteases could be responsible for the proteolytic processing of P22 into HBeAg. In our experimental system, HBeAg can be generated in one step, by a cleavage at the C-terminal side of Arg154. That this cleavage is caused by the furin is supported by two complementary results. First, we have shown that HBeAg can be generated in the TGN or in the extracellular medium, implying that the processing enzyme is present in the TGN as well as at the cell surface or secreted. This is one of the features of furin, which cycles between the TGN and the plasmic membrane and which is also secreted in an active form (8Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 17Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin.

Second, furin is the only member of the PC family that does not have a strong requirement for a basic residue in position P2 (9Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 19van de Loo J.-W.H.P. Creemers J.W.M. Bright N.A. Young B.D. Roebroek A.J.M. Van de Ven W.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27116-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and consequently is able to recognize a motif as151RRGR154. The situation is less clear for the generation of P20 that arises in the TGN compartment. Because a basic residue is present at position P2 in the motif164RRRR167, other members of the PC family that are known to be present in the TGN, namely PACE4 and LPC/PC7/PC8/SPC7 may also be involved in the cleavage of P22 at position 167. However, the fact that P20 was generated in a cell line (HEK 293, data not shown) devoid of PACE4 (20Mains R.E. Berard C.A. Denault J.-B. Zhou A. Johnson R.C. Leduc R. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) is not in favor of the involvement of this enzyme in the generation of P20. On the other hand, LPC/PC7/PC8/SPC7 recognizes usually a 6-amino acid sequence, a property that does not support a role of this protease in the processing of P22. Taken together, those arguments strongly suggest that furin is the PC that cleaves P22 at position 167, leading to P20. However, the involvement of LPC/PC7/PC8/SPC7 or PACE 4 cannot be totally excluded. To overcome this problem, LoVo cells unable to produce functional furin were used (21Takahashi S. Kasai K. Hatsuzawa K. Kitamura N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the low efficiency of transfection obtained with this cell line did not allow us to draw a clear conclusion. It is worth noting that four of six putative furin sites were not cleaved. This cannot be explained by the nature of P′1 and P′2 residues, which are neither a lysine nor a hydrophobic residue, a characteristic reported to impede proper cleavage by furin (22Watanabe T. Nakagawa T. Ikemizu J. Nagahama M. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8270-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lazure C. Gauthier D. Jean F. Boudreault A. Seidah N.G. Bennett H.P.J. Hendy G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8572-8580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A possible explanation could be the nonaccessibility of some putative cleavage sites to the protease that could either be caused by to the folding of P22 or to the presence of cellular proteins that interact with its C-terminal domain. We have previously reported two such proteins which interact specifically with the C-terminal domain of P22 (12Salhi S. Messageot F. Carlier D. Jean-Jean O. Rossignol J.-M. J. Viral. Hepat. 2001; 8: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Messageot F. Carlier D. Rossignol J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18594-18598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The next question is: what could be the function of P20 in the life cycle of HBV? One hypothesis derives directly from our previously reported data (10Carlier D. Jean-Jean O. Fouillot N. Will H. Rossignol J.-M. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1041-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Messageot F. Carlier D. Rossignol J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18594-18598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We have shown that the P22 C-terminal domain plays an important role during the intracellular transport of P22 through the secretory pathway, because a sequence located between amino acids 144 and 165 is required for an efficient HBeAg secretion via an interaction with a cellular tunicamycin-sensitive protein named TSP (24Messageot F. Carlier D. Rossignol J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18594-18598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Consequently, it could be envisaged that TSP would interact with a precursor of the HBeAg shorter than P22, like P20, which ends at Arg167. Other experiments will be required to conclude about this point. In our experimental system, our results strongly indicate that the HBeAg ends at Arg154 instead of Val149, as previously reported by Takahashi et al. (5Takahashi K. Machida A. Funatsu G. Nomura M. Usuda S. Aoyagi S. Tachibana K. Miyamoto H. Imai M. Nakamura T. Miyakawa Y. Mayumi M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 2903-2907PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is worth noting that these authors have determined the C terminus of the HBeAg purified from patient's sera whereas we have studied the generation of HBeAg in cell culture. Therefore, it could be speculated that another proteolytic event arises in the sera of infected patients. For instance, in the case of pro-hormone processing, a carboxypeptidase removes one or two basic residues after the cleavage by the proprotein-convertase (18Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). However, this second proteolytic event always occurs in the secretory pathway, implying that only the mature hormone is secreted. Although we cannot exclude that another proteolytic event occurs in the patient's sera during the HBeAg processing, our hypothesis is supported by previous results of Salfeld and co-workers (25Salfeld J. Pfaff E. Noah M. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 798-808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These authors have studied the HBeAg isolated from patients infected by the adw subtype of HBV that encode the sequence 146TTVVDSRRRGR156 instead of the classical 146TTVVRRRGR154 sequence. Interestingly, they reported that the adw HBeAg has a slower migration than the ayw HBeAg. This observation is not consistent with TTVV149 as the C-terminal extremity of the HBeAg but rather favors of our hypothesis. Becasue our results have been reproduced in two independent cell lines (COS-7 and HEK 293), demonstrating that they was not due to the specificity of COS-7 cells, we suggest that HBeAg actually ends at position 154 in vivo.

Recent studies have shown, however, that CSQ participates in the active Ca2+ release process from SR not simply by being a passive Ca2+ storage protein but also by actively modulating the function of the ryanodine receptor (RyR), the primary SR Ca2+ release channel involved in excitation-contraction coupling (2Szegedi C. Sarkozi S. Herzog A. Jona I. Varsanyi M. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 19-22Google Scholar, 3Donoso P. Beltran M. Hidalgo C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13419-13425Google Scholar, 4Guo W. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

Kovayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of CSQ contains an aspartate-rich region (amino acids 354–367) (7Yano K. Zarain-Herzberg A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 61-70Google Scholar, 8Wang S. Trumble W.R. Liao H. Wesson C.R. Dunker K. Kang C.H. Nat. Struc. Biol. 1998; 5: 476-483Google Scholar), which functions as a major Ca2+ binding motif (9Shin D.W., Ma, J. Kim D.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 178-182Google Scholar) and also interacts with triadin or junctin, proteins of the SR membrane complexed to RyR with unclear roles in the operation of excitation-contraction coupling. A different region of CSQ (amino acids 86–191) has been suggested previously to bind to junctin and triadin (6Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kovayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Google Scholar, 17Collins J.H. Tarcsafalvi A. Ikemoto N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 189-193Google Scholar). The functional significance of these CSQ regions in muscle Ca2+ signaling has not been examined. The internal Ca2+ store of muscle cells, located in the SR, has a limited capacity; it must be replenished regularly through the entry of Ca2+ from the external environment. Depletion of SR Ca2+ stores, following activation of RyR or other Ca2+ release mechanisms, triggers Ca2+ entry from the external environment through a process known as capacitative Ca2+ entry via activation of store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOC) located in the cell surface membrane (10Kiselyov K.I. Shin D.M. Wang Y. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 421-431Google Scholar, 13Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 185-199Google Scholar, 14Pan Z. Yang D. Nagaraj R.Y. Nosek T.A. Nishi M. Takeshima H. Cheng H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 379-383Google Scholar). Research into the molecular and cellular function of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) has been carried out primarily in non-excitable cells (i.e. lymphocytes, mast cells, etc.) and to some extent in smooth muscle cells (11Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Kurosaki T. Putney J.W. Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15945-15952Google Scholar, 12Ng L.C. Gurney A.M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 923-929Google Scholar). Recently, Kurebayashi and Ogawa (13Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 185-199Google Scholar) presented the first functional evidence for the existence of SOC in skeletal muscle. We have extended their observations and shown that activation of SOC in skeletal muscle is coupled to retrograde signaling via conformational changes in the RyR (14Pan Z. Yang D. Nagaraj R.Y. Nosek T.A. Nishi M. Takeshima H. Cheng H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 379-383Google Scholar). In this study, we test the hypothesis that the RyR might receive information on the state of SR Ca2+ depletion via a direct retrograde signal from CSQ and thereby modulate both RyR-mediated Ca2+ release and RyR-mediated SOCE. We found that overexpression of CSQ not only enhances active Ca2+ release through the RyR but also suppresses SOCE. Deletion of the Ca2+ binding, aspartate-rich region of CSQ in these overexpression experiments resulted in reversal of the suppression of SOCE by wt-CSQ. Our data suggest that modulation of the RyR complex by CSQ from the luminal side of the SR could play a major role in regulating Ca2+ homeostasis in muscle cells and begin to define regions of CSQ that differentially interact with the RyR complex. C2C12 myoblasts derived from mouse skeletal muscle were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, as described by Shin et al.(15Shin D.W. Pan Z. Bandyopadhyay A. Bhat M.B. Kim D.H. Ma J. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2539-2549Google Scholar). Differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes was induced by changing the culture medium to DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum (HS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Experiments were performed on C2C12 myotubes expressing RyR, i.e. from the fifth day of culture in HS-DMEM, when it was possible to select myotubes having mature skeletal-type excitation-contraction coupling. The wt-CSQ cDNA from rabbit skeletal muscle and two deletion mutants of CSQ, Δjunc-CSQ and Δasp-CSQ, were originally cloned into the pCDNA-HA 3.1 vector. For functional studies with C2C12 cells, the CSQ cDNAs were subcloned from pcDNA3.1-HA to pCMS-EGFP to create pCMS-EGFP(wt-CSQ), pCMS-EGFP(Δasp-CSQ), and pCMS-EGFP(Δjunc-CSQ). The pCMS-EGFP plasmid contains two separate promoters that drive the transcription of green fluorescent protein (GFP, under the SV40 promoter) and the gene of interest (i.e. wt-CSQ or its mutants, under the CMV promoter) (16Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Google Scholar), thereby providing a convenient way of selecting transfected cells using GFP fluorescence. pCMS-EGFP vector alone or vector containing wt-CSQ, Δasp-CSQ, or Δjunc-CSQ cDNAs were transfected into proliferating myoblasts using LipofectAMINE plusTM reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The culture medium was changed to HS-DMEM to allow differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes 12 h after transfection. Five days after culturing in HS-DMEM medium, the C2C12 myotubes growing on coverslips and transfected with pcDNA3.1-HA plasmids containing wt-CSQ, Δasp-CSQ, or Δjunc-CSQ were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 2 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2) for 5 min. The cells were then incubated for 30 min with primary monoclonal antibody against HA or polyclonal antibody against skeletal CSQ for detecting exogenous HA-CSQ fusion proteins or endogenous CSQ protein. The cells were washed four times with 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. For detection of endogenous RyR, the cells were incubated for 30 min with primary polyclonal antibody against RyR and treated with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody. The coverslips were then mounted with 90% glycerol and 0.1% O-phenylenediamine in phosphate-buffered saline. Immunofluorescence was analyzed under a Leica DMRBE microscope (Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with a ×100 objective and filters for epifluorescence. Wild-type and CSQ mutant protein expression was demonstrated by Western blot following transient transfection in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, rather than C2C12 cells, because of the low efficiency of transfection in the latter (see Fig. 1 b). The expressed CSQ protein was probed with polyclonal anti-CSQ antibody. The protein-antibody complex was blotted with a horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody, and the signal was detected on Eastman Kodak Co. films using a chemiluminescent kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The detailed procedure has been described elsewhere (15Shin D.W. Pan Z. Bandyopadhyay A. Bhat M.B. Kim D.H. Ma J. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2539-2549Google Scholar). Briefly, C2C12 myotubes were loaded with Fura-2/AM fluorescent Ca2+ indicator. Individual myotubes expressing exogenous CSQ were selected by the presence of GFP fluorescence, as described above. The changes in intracellular Ca2+ in single live cells was measured following exposure to 10 mm caffeine or 1 μmthapsigargin (Tg), with no [Ca2+]opresent in the bath solution (Ca2+-free balanced salt solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.5 mm EGTA). The detailed procedure has been described elsewhere (14Pan Z. Yang D. Nagaraj R.Y. Nosek T.A. Nishi M. Takeshima H. Cheng H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 379-383Google Scholar). Briefly, to measure Mn2+ influx rate through SOC, 0.5 mm Mn2+ was added to the extracellular medium after Tg-induced SR Ca2+ depletion with or without the buffering of cytosolic Ca2+ by 50 μm BAPTA-AM. The Mn2+ quenching of Fura-2 fluorescence was measured at the Ca2+-independent wavelength of Fura-2 excitation (360 nm). The decay of Fura-2 fluorescence upon Mn2+ addition was expressed as percent decrease in Fura-2 fluorescence per unit time (initial fluorescence = 100%). Values are means ± S.E. Significance was determined by Student's t test or analysis of variance. A value of p < 0.05 was used as criterion for statistical significance. CSQ contains a putative junctin-binding region (amino acids 86–191; junc), as well as the Ca2+-binding aspartate-rich region (amino acids 354–367; asp) (7Yano K. Zarain-Herzberg A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 61-70Google Scholar, 17Collins J.H. Tarcsafalvi A. Ikemoto N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 189-193Google Scholar). To examine the function of junc and asp regions of CSQ, two deletion mutants, Δjunc-CSQ and Δasp-CSQ, were generated using the PCR-based method for expression and functional studies in C2C12 cells (9Shin D.W., Ma, J. Kim D.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 178-182Google Scholar). To distinguish the subcellular distribution of endogenous CSQ from expressed exogenous CSQ, wt and the CSQ mutants were expressed as HA-CSQ fusion proteins in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. Subcellular localization of HA-tagged proteins was performed by immunostaining with monoclonal antibody against HA. These experiment revealed a perinuclear distribution of HA-Δasp-CSQ expressed in C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 1 b), in a pattern that is indistinguishable from that of endogenous CSQ present in the SR detected by polyclonal anti-CSQ (Fig. 1 a). The subcellular distributions of HA-wt-CSQ and HA-Δjunc-CSQ were similar to that of endogenous CSQ, indicating that both exogenously expressed proteins were also localized to the SR (data not shown). This was further confirmed by co-localization studies with polyclonal anti-RyR, as shown in the lower panels of Fig. 1, a andb. Clearly, the patterns of RyR distribution are virtually identical to those of wt and mutant CSQ expressed in C2C12 cells. To confirm that the translational products of the various CSQ cDNAs were indeed CSQ, Western blots were performed on SDS-PAGE separated proteins derived from CHO cells transiently transfected with the wt-CSQ, Δasp-CSQ, and Δjunc-CSQ cDNAs. With LipofectAMINE-mediated gene transfection, CHO cells have higher transfection efficiency than C2C12 cells (30–60% for CHOversus 3–6% for C2C12), making it easier to detect expressed CSQ proteins. As shown in Fig. 1 c, proteins of the predicted molecular masses are identified by anti-CSQ antibody. As with the C2C12 cells, immunostaining studies of these CHO cells also indicated that the expressed CSQ proteins were localized in the ER (not shown). Insertion of the various CSQ cDNAs into another eukaryotic expression vector, pCMS-EGFP, enabled selection of significantly transfected C2C12 cells using GFP fluorescence. The pCMS-EGFP plasmid expresses 1:1 ratio of GFP and CSQ under the control of two independent promoters (15Shin D.W. Pan Z. Bandyopadhyay A. Bhat M.B. Kim D.H. Ma J. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2539-2549Google Scholar, 16Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Google Scholar). Individual C2C12 myotubes exhibiting similar levels of GFP fluorescence, and therefore most likely similar level of exogenous CSQ proteins, were selected for functional studies with caffeine-induced Ca2+ release measurements. As shown in Fig. 2 a, application of 10 mm caffeine resulted in Ca2+ release from SR in myotubes transfected with GFP alone (control). The peak amplitude of caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in myotubes transfected with wt-CSQ was ∼1.7-fold higher than cells transfected with GFP alone (ΔF 340/F 380 = 0.80 ± 0.02, n = 13, GFP; 1.38 ± 0.03,n = 11, wt-CSQ) (Fig. 2 c). In contrast, expression of Δasp-CSQ in C2C12 cells significantly reduced caffeine-induced Ca2+ release (0.41 ± 0.03,n = 14). Myotubes transfected with Δjunc-CSQ, on the other hand, showed similar enhancement of the amplitude of the caffeine-induced Ca2+ release transient (1.23 ± 0.03, n = 14) as wt-CSQ (Fig. 2 c). A simple explanation for the enhancement of caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in C2C12 myotubes overexpressing wt-CSQ is that this phenomenon likely reflects release from a concomitantly increased SR Ca2+ store. To determine whether the SR Ca2+ store was indeed increased, we treated cells withA23187, a Ca2+ ionophore that will release the entire intracellular Ca2+ store and allow its quantitation (18Pizzo P. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 355-366Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 e, the A23187-releasable Ca2+pool was significantly larger in myotubes transfected with wt-CSQ and Δjunc-CSQ than those transfected with GFP alone (0.87 ± 0.12, n = 6, GFP; 1.43 ± 0.13,n = 8, wt-CSQ; 1.35 ± 0.11, n = 6, Δjunc-CSQ), whereas cells transfected with Δasp-CSQ contained an A23187-releasable Ca2+pool that was statistically identical to GFP controls (0.83 ± 0.15, n = 6) (Fig. 2 e). We then endeavored to determine whether the effects of transfected CSQ proteins on depolarization-induced Ca2+ release would parallel the results seen with caffeine-induced Ca2+release. Changing the extracellular KCl concentration from 2.8 to 10 mm led to depolarization of the cell surface membrane and induced the release of Ca2+ from the SR in C2C12 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, b and d, the peak amplitude of depolarization-induced Ca2+ release in cells overexpressing wt-CSQ and Δjunc-CSQ was again ∼1.4–1.6-fold higher than that of GFP controls (0.74 ± 0.01, n = 10, GFP; 1.20 ± 0.03, n = 8, wt-CSQ; 1.02 ± 0.01, n = 10, Δjunc-CSQ), whereas overexpression of Δasp-CSQ led to a significantly decreased depolarization-induced Ca2+ release (0.46 ± 0.03, n = 11). These results parallel the aggregate caffeine-induced Ca2+ release data shown in Fig. 2 c. These data suggest that Δasp-CSQ may either directly suppress RyR channel activity or reduce the efficiency of signal transduction from the dihydropyridine receptor to the RyR. Theoretically, Δasp-CSQ could suppress SR Ca2+release by reducing the Ca2+ buffering capacity of the SR. The aggregate Ca2+ store data presented in Fig. 2 e, however, demonstrate that the Ca2+ store of the GFP control cells and the Δasp-CSQ cells are equivalent. Overexpression of functional CSQ, wt or mutant, in C2C12 cells should inevitably increase the Ca2+ buffering capacity of the SR and thereby alter the duration of passive Ca2+ movement across the SR membrane through as yet undescribed leak pathways. The kinetics of decay of this passive myoplasmic Ca2+ signal reflects a competition between continuing Ca2+ leak from the SR store and the removal of myoplasmic Ca2+ to the external environment by various plasma membrane-based mechanisms. One would expect that cells containing an elevated SR Ca2+store would have a longer kinetic decay of the myoplasmic Ca2+ signal. To test this possibility, Tg, a potent inhibitor of SR Ca2+-ATPase (19Mery L. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. Opas M. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9332-9339Google Scholar), was used to block the Ca2+ uptake function of the SR membrane, allowing for depletion of the luminal Ca2+ store via SR Ca2+leak pathways. Our results, shown in Fig. 3 A, demonstrate that the peak amplitudes of Tg-induced increases in myoplasmic [Ca2+]i were comparable among the GFP control and those overexpressing wt-CSQ, Δasp-CSQ, and Δjunc-CSQ. As predicted, however, the decay phase of Ca2+ transients in myotubes overexpressing wt-CSQ or Δjunc-CSQ, shown in Fig. 2 e to contain greater Ca2+ stores than control or Δasp-CSQ cells, were significantly longer (t 12 = 167 ± 11 s, n = 9, GFP; 332 ± 11 s,n = 10, wt-CSQ; 295 ± 28 s,n = 8, Δjunc-CSQ) (Fig. 3 b). Importantly, the decay pattern of Tg-induced Ca2+transients in cells overexpressing Δasp-CSQ was similar to the GFP control (t 12 = 161 ± 8 s,n = 9). These results suggest that removal of theasp-rich region significantly reduces Ca2+buffering capacity of endogenous CSQ, or to the exclusion of endogenous CSQ, does not participate in Ca2+ buffering of the SR. These results are consistent with our previous finding that theasp-rich region contains a major Ca2+ binding motif (9Shin D.W., Ma, J. Kim D.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 178-182Google Scholar). We have shown recently (14Pan Z. Yang D. Nagaraj R.Y. Nosek T.A. Nishi M. Takeshima H. Cheng H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 379-383Google Scholar) that depletion of SR Ca2+ storage leads to activation of SOCE in skeletal muscle. The activation of SOC in skeletal muscle appears to be coupled to conformational changes of RyR. Because our data above suggest that the Ca2+ store, as determined by the functional Ca2+ binding capacity of CSQ, determines the degree of Ca2+ release via the RyR, we asked whether this Ca2+ store could affect SOCE in this system. Sustained treatment of C2C12 myotubes with 1 μm Tg in Ca2+-free medium resulted in complete depletion of SR Ca2+. Addition of 2 mm Ca2+ to the bath solution after the myoplasmic Ca2+ signal had returned to baseline triggered SOCE in these Ca2+-depleted cells (Fig. 3 a). The degree of SOCE in myotubes transfected with Δasp-CSQ was similar to GFP control cells (Fig. 3,a and c). Strikingly, overexpression of wt-CSQ and Δjunc-CSQ in the presence of a Tg-depleted SR Ca2+ store resulted in significant inhibition of SOCE (1.03 ± 0.07, n = 9, GFP; 0.51 ± 0.04,n = 10, wt-CSQ; 0.56 ± 0.06, n = 8, Δjunc-CSQ) (Fig. 3 c). The total SOCE measured in these experiments is likely the result of a summation of competing processes, SR Ca2+ uptake and release and surface membrane Ca2+ extrusion and influx. To isolate the measurement of SOC-mediated Ca2+ influx, we used the technique of Mn2+ quenching of the Fura-2 fluorescence (14Pan Z. Yang D. Nagaraj R.Y. Nosek T.A. Nishi M. Takeshima H. Cheng H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 379-383Google Scholar). Mn2+ is known to be able to permeate into cells via SOC but is impervious to surface membrane extrusion processes or SR uptake by Ca2+ pumps. Hence, Mn2+ fluorescence quenching represents a measurement of unidirectional Ca2+ flux into cells via SOC. Under resting conditions (i.e. cells with an intact SR Ca2+pool), no detectable Mn2+ quenching of Fura-2 was observed (not shown). Myotubes with Tg-depleted SR Ca2+ stores in a Ca2+-free medium exhibited rapid quenching of Fura-2 fluorescence upon addition of 0.5 mm Mn2+ to the bath solution (Fig. 4 a). Surprisingly, cells overexpressing wt-CSQ and Δjunc-CSQ displayed significant reduction in the rate of Fura-2 fluorescence quenching even with a depleted SR Ca2+ store. On average, ∼10-fold reduction in Mn2+ influx rate was observed in cells overexpressing wt-CSQ and Δjunc-CSQ compared with control. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3, overexpression of Δasp-CSQ did not appear to affect the rate of Mn2+ influx in C2C12 cells (Fig. 4 a). If the presence of exogenous CSQ is merely to increase the Ca2+load of the SR, then the complete depletion of this load should give equivalent activation of SOCE and resultant Mn2+fluorescence quenching in all four of the cell preparations. Our results imply (a) that CSQ itself initiates a signal to SOCs, and (b) that the asp-rich region of the protein is likely involved in this signal transmission process. Studies from other investigators (33Fierro L. Parekh A.B. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 9-17Google Scholar) suggest that gating of SOC is sensitive to the local level of [Ca2+]i. To test the role of [Ca2+]i on the CSQ-mediated changes in the activation of SOCE in skeletal muscle, C2C12 cells were equilibrated with 50 μm BAPTA-AM, a concentration sufficient to buffer the changes in [Ca2+]i because of passive Ca2+ movement across the SR membrane, as indicated by the complete lack of Tg-induced changes in Fura-2 signal (Fig. 4 b). Fifteen min after the addition of Tg, changing the bath solution from no [Ca2+] to 2 mm[Ca2+] resulted in measurable increases in the Fura-2 signal, indicating significant Ca2+ influx across the cell surface membrane (Fig. 4 b). Myotubes transfected with wt-CSQ and Δjunc-CSQ showed slower Ca2+ entry than GFP control and Δasp-CSQ-transfected myotubes. Direct Mn2+ quenching studies of Tg-induced Ca2+-depleted and BAPTA-buffered myotubes confirmed that the changes in Fura-2 fluorescence above were because of activation of SOCE (Fig. 4 c). Here, a striking reduction in the rate of Mn2+ quenching was observed in myotubes overexpressing wt-CSQ and Δjunc-CSQ, but not Δasp-CSQ, with 50 μm BAPTA-AM present in the cytosol. These results indicate that buffering of [Ca2+]idoes not interfere with function of SOC in skeletal muscle and that the wt-CSQ-mediated inhibition of SOCE in C2C12 cells is unlikely to correlate with any changes in myoplasmic [Ca2+]i. Until recently, CSQ has been thought of as the SR Ca2+-binding protein whose function is simply to sequester Ca2+ in the vicinity of the RyR/Ca2+ release channel, to maintain a store for this ion, and to facilitate its rapid release during excitation-contraction coupling in muscle cells (2Szegedi C. Sarkozi S. Herzog A. Jona I. Varsanyi M. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 19-22Google Scholar, 3Donoso P. Beltran M. Hidalgo C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13419-13425Google Scholar, 4Guo W. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9027-9030Google Scholar, 5Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Google Scholar, 6Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kovayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Google Scholar). We have shown here that overexpression of wt-CSQ enhances both caffeine- and voltage-induced Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle myotubes that are associated with an increased Ca2+store in the SR. A profound reduction of SOCE was observed in cells overexpressing wt-CSQ or Δjunc-CSQ, but not Δasp-CSQ, in cells with depleted SR Ca2+stores and whose myoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations were buffered with BAPTA. Thus, the SR Ca2+ store is necessary for RyR-dependent Ca2+ release, but Ca2+ store per se is not the sole signal that regulates SOCE. Rather, CSQ adds a proximal signal in the regulation of SOCE in muscle cells. Our data suggests that the asp-rich region of CSQ is essential for retrograde signaling in both RyR-mediated Ca2+ release and regulation of SOCE in skeletal muscle. The enhancement of caffeine-induced Ca2+ release by wt-CSQ in C2C12 myotubes is similar to that seen in cardiomyocytes isolated from transgenic mice overexpressing CSQ (20Jones L.R. Suzuki Y.J. Wang W. Kovayashi Y.M. Ramesh V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Cleemann L. Morad M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1385-1393Google Scholar, 21Sato Y. Ferguson D.G. Sako H. Dorn G.W., II Kadambi V.J. Yatani A. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. Kranias E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 278: 28470-28477Google Scholar). In those studies, caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was increased by ∼10-fold in the CSQ transgenic mouse, paralleling the ∼10-fold overexpression of CSQ in the heart. Because Δasp-CSQ did not change the total SR Ca2+ store, the negative effect of this mutant on caffeine- and voltage-induced Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle may reflect a reduced activity of RyR or its interaction with accessory proteins or reduced local Ca2+ in the vicinity of RyR. Our data suggest that the asp-rich region of CSQ may regulate the proper functioning of the RyR, either by directly interacting with this channel or affecting other partners in the RyR/Ca2+ release channel complex. Others have suggested that proper formation of a quaternary molecular complex among CSQ, triadin, junctin, and RyR plays a critical role in the active Ca2+ release process across the SR membrane (6Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kovayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Google Scholar, 20Jones L.R. Suzuki Y.J. Wang W. Kovayashi Y.M. Ramesh V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Cleemann L. Morad M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1385-1393Google Scholar). Indeed, both the carboxyl-terminal-containing asp-rich and amino-terminal regions of CSQ have been suggested as necessary for forming this quaternary SR Ca2+ release complex (8Wang S. Trumble W.R. Liao H. Wesson C.R. Dunker K. Kang C.H. Nat. Struc. Biol. 1998; 5: 476-483Google Scholar, 22Maguire P.B. Briggs F.N. Lennon N.J. Ohlendieck K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 721-727Google Scholar,23Gatti G. Trifari S. Mesaeli N. Parker J.M.R. Michalak M. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 525-534Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that the asp-rich region of CSQ binds Ca2+, and this region is also involved in interaction with triadin (9Shin D.W., Ma, J. Kim D.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 178-182Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that overexpression of Δasp-CSQ may alter the conformation of the quaternary complex and therefore cause inhibition of the RyR channel function. A surprising and critical observation of the present study is that overexpression of wt-CSQ inhibits the function of SOCE in skeletal muscle. The CSQ-mediated inhibition of SOCE appears to involve theasp-rich region of CSQ, because the inhibitory effect was only observed with wt-CSQ and Δjunc-CSQ but not with Δasp-CSQ. Our studies provide the first direct evidence for regulation of SOCE, a cell surface membrane function, through the luminal side of the SR membrane. Previous studies with other cell types have suggested that the physical docking of the ER or SR with the cell surface membrane is involved in the activation of SOC, presumably through contact interaction between SOC and protein components in the ER or SR (e.g. the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor or RyR) (10Kiselyov K.I. Shin D.M. Wang Y. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 421-431Google Scholar, 24Ma H.T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L.

J. 1998; 329: 349-357Google Scholar). Alternatively, the release of as yet undefined diffusible second messenger(s) from the intracellular organelle into the cytosol has been proposed to serve as an activator of SOC in response to depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (27Kim H.Y. Hanley M.R. Mol. Cells. 1999; 9: 326-332Google Scholar,28Trepakova E.S. Csutora P. Hunton D.L. Marchase R.B. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26158-26163Google Scholar). Our recent studies with primary cultured skeletal muscle cells derived from different genetically engineered mouse models suggest that activation of SOC can be achieved in a graded fashion, depending on the filling state of the intracellular Ca2+ stores and/or the conformational changes of RyR (14Pan Z. Yang D. Nagaraj R.Y. Nosek T.A. Nishi M. Takeshima H. Cheng H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 379-383Google Scholar). Although the gene(s) responsible for SOC has yet to be identified, and the exact nature of signal transduction involved in the activation of SOC remains largely unknown, our data indicate that the aspartate-rich segment of calsequestrin, under conditions of overexpression, can sustain structural interactions that interfere with the SOCE mechanism. These interactions are possibly taking place at the junctional site of the SR. Previous studies suggested that cardiomyocytes overexpressing CSQ showed abnormal enlarged junctional SR structure in triad junction, resulting in alteration of calcium signaling in muscle cells (20Jones L.R. Suzuki Y.J. Wang W. Kovayashi Y.M. Ramesh V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Cleemann L. Morad M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1385-1393Google Scholar, 21Sato Y. Ferguson D.G. Sako H. Dorn G.W., II Kadambi V.J. Yatani A. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. Kranias E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 278: 28470-28477Google Scholar). It will be interesting, therefore, to see how the absence of CSQ in a knock-out model would affect the function of SOC in skeletal muscle. The presence of exogenously expressed CSQ in the SR lumen adds extra Ca2+ buffering capacity and increases the driving force for Ca2+ movement across the SR membrane. Our experiments with Tg-induced SR Ca2+ store depletion and myoplasmic BAPTA Ca2+ buffering have ruled out the possibility that the reduction of SOCE seen with overexpression of wt-CSQ and Δjunc-CSQ results from an incomplete depletion of SR Ca2+ stores or because of potential changes in myoplasmic [Ca2+]i (29Madge L. Marshall I.C.B. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 351-369Google Scholar, 30Putney J.W., Jr. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Google Scholar). A previous study (19Mery L. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. Opas M. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9332-9339Google Scholar) in mouse fibroblast cells showed that overexpression of calreticulin, a major Ca2+-binding protein in the ER lumen of non-muscle cells, also inhibited SOCE through a mechanism that is independent of its Ca2+ binding properties. Examination of the primary amino acid sequence of calreticulin reveals that, similar to CSQ, it too contains a highly negatively charged region at its carboxyl terminus. We speculate that the conservation of this negatively charged region of the carboxyl terminus of both of these SR/ER Ca2+-binding proteins supports a significant functional role for the protein. We further suggest that this region in calreticulin will be involved in regulating SOCE in non-muscle cells. Similar to the retrograde interaction between the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and SOC in non-excitable cells (10Kiselyov K.I. Shin D.M. Wang Y. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. Muallem S. Mol.

Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J.

Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Google Scholar, 32Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Cumulative evidence also suggests that the conformational state of the RyR can regulate the function of SOC (10Kiselyov K.I. Shin D.M. Wang Y. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 421-431Google Scholar, 14Pan Z. Yang D. Nagaraj R.Y. Nosek T.A. Nishi M. Takeshima H. Cheng H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 379-383Google Scholar). Our data reported here provide additional evidence for a tight link between Ca2+ homeostasis in SR and Ca2+ permeability in the cell surface membrane. Overexpression of CSQ in skeletal muscle not only affects caffeine- and voltage-induced Ca2+ release but also regulates SOCE. The aspartate residues located in the carboxyl terminus of CSQ not only constitute binding pockets for Ca2+ but also can regulate the function of the surface membrane-located, store-operated Ca2+ channel, likely via retrograde interaction with the junctional protein complex in the SR. We thank Dr. Kevin P. Campbell for providing cDNA encoding the rabbit CSQ and Dr. Woo Jin Park for providing polyclonal anti-CSQ antibody. We also thank Mr. Chun Shik Park for invaluable technical help in immunocytochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2086479542,"We have previously shown that stimulation of proliferation of avian embryonic muscle cells (myoblasts) by 1α,25(OH)2-vitamin D3(1α,25(OH)2D3) is mediated by activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; ERK1/2). To understand how 1α,25(OH)2D3 up-regulates the MAPK cascade, we have investigated whether the hormone acts upstream through stimulation of Raf-1 and the signaling mechanism by which this effect might take place. Treatment of chick myoblasts with 1α,25(OH)2D3 (1 nm) caused a fast increase of Raf-1 serine phosphorylation (1- and 3-fold over basal at 1 and 2 min, respectively), indicating activation of Raf-1 by the hormone. These effects were abolished by preincubation of cells with a specific Ras inhibitor peptide that involves Ras in 1α,25(OH)2D3 stimulation of Raf-1. 1α,25(OH)2D3 rapidly induced tyrosine de-phosphorylation of Ras-GTPase-activating protein, suggesting that inhibition of Ras-GTP hydrolysis is part of the mechanism by which 1α,25(OH)2D3 activates Ras in myoblasts. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors calphostin C, bisindolylmaleimide I, and Ro 318220 blocked 1α,25(OH)2D3-induced Raf-1 serine phosphorylation, revealing that hormone stimulation of Raf-1 also involves PKC. In addition, transfection of muscle cells with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against PKCα mRNA suppressed serine phosphorylation by 1α,25(OH)2D3. The increase in MAPK activity and tyrosine phosphorylation caused by 1α,25(OH)2D3 could be abolished by Ras inhibitor peptide, compound PD 98059, which prevents the activation of MEK by Raf-1, or incubation of cell lysates before 1α,25(OH)2D3 exposure with an anti-Raf-1 antibody. In conclusion, these results demonstrate for the first time in a 1α,25(OH)2D3 target cell that activation of Raf-1 via Ras and PKCα-dependent serine phosphorylation plays a central role in hormone stimulation of the MAPK-signaling pathway leading to muscle cell proliferation.

Eisenmann-Tape I. Fries H-W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Activation of Raf-1 downstream of protein-tyrosine kinase receptors is mediated by the Ras GTP-binding proteins, which are required for stimulation of Raf-1 kinase activity (2Troppmair J. Bruder J.T.

Raf-1 then phosphorylates and activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, also known as MEK1 (4Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), initiating a protein kinase cascade that follows with the phosphorylation and activation of the extracellular signal-regulated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase isoforms ERK1 and ERK2 (5Howe l.R. Leevers S.J. Gomez N. Nakielny S. Cohen P. Marsahall C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 335-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Upon activation, MAP kinase (MAPK) is translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (6Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where it phosphorylates transcription factors (7Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and culminates in proliferation or differentiation of a variety of cell types. With an estimated molecular mass of 74 kDa, Raf-1 possesses three conserved regions, CR1, CR2, and CR3, that are embedded in variable regions. The CR1 and CR2 domains are part of the regulatory N-terminal half of the Raf-1 protein, whereas CR3 forms the C-terminal kinase domain (1Daum G. Eisenmann-Tape I. Fries H-W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of Raf-1 activation, however, is still unclear. Although Raf-1 binds directly to the effector domain of activated GTP-bound Ras proteins, this interaction does not appear to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity (8Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Rather, it seems that the role of the Ras-Raf interaction is to recruit Raf-1 to the plasma membrane, where it can be activated by membrane lipids or other protein kinases, the nature of which remains to be determined (9Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 10Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Raf on both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues is required for enzymatic activity (11Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the Src protein-tyrosine kinase can activate Raf by phosphorylation on Tyr-340 and Tyr-341 (12Fabian J.R. Darr I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 13Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). However, mutant Raf proteins in which Tyr-340 and Tyr-341 have been changed to Asp can still be activated after membrane association, indicating that an additional mechanism(s) of Raf activation exists (13Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Among the mechanisms involved, there is evidence for the operation of both protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent and PKC-independent pathways of Raf activation in response to agonists (14Qiu Z.H. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19480-19487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 13 members of the PKC family can be grouped into three major classes of Ca2+-dependent classical PKCs, Ca2+-independent, novel PKCs, and Ca2+- and lipid-independent, atypical PKCs. There is a fourth PKC subgroup consisting of PKCμ (15Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Previous reports showed that classical and novel PKCs activate the MAP kinase pathway at the level of Raf-1, whereas atypical PKCs activate MEK by an independent mechanism (16Schonwasser D.C.

Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). One of the classical PKCs, PKCα can directly activate Raf-1 by serine phosphorylation of Raf-1 (18Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Humme l R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). The steroid hormone 1α,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3(1α,25(OH)2D3) triggers responses in muscle cells both through a nuclear receptor-mediated mechanism that promotes gene transcription (19Boland R. de Boland A.R. Marinissen M.J. Santillán G. Vazquez G. Zanello S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 114: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and a fast non-genomic mode of action independent of new RNA and protein synthesis (20de Boland A.R. Boland R. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 1858-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21de Boland A.R. Boland R. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In previous work we have demonstrated that the steroid hormone rapidly stimulates in skeletal muscle cells the phosphorylation and activity of the MAP kinase isoforms ERK1 and ERK2 and have implicated the MAPK cascade in hormone control of myoblast proliferation (22Morelli S. Buitrago C. Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36021-36028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, initial investigations on the mechanisms underlying 1α,25(OH)2D3 stimulation of the muscle cell (myoblast) MAPK pathway revealed that PKC and Ca2+ are two upstream activators mediating the hormone effect (23Morelli S. Buitrago C. Boland R. de Boland A.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 173: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that 1α,25(OH)2D3 enhancement of myoblast proliferation correlates to increased PKCα expression, whereas decreased PKCα levels are observed during the subsequent activation of muscle cell differentiation by the hormone (24Capiati D. Tellez Iñón M.T. Boland R.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 153: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of PKCα expression by using antisense oligonucleotide technology resulted in a significant decrease of culture cell density and DNA synthesis, clearly showing that this isozyme is involved in signaling cascades that promote muscle cell proliferation (25Capiati D.A. Vazquez G. Tellez-Iñón M.T. Boland R.L. Cell Prolif. 2001; 33: 307-315Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The upstream-signaling pathway that leads to activation of the Ras/Raf-1/MAPK (ERK1/2) cascade by 1α,25(OH)2D3 remains incompletely understood, and direct evidence on the participation of any of the PKC isoforms is lacking. In view of the information discussed above, we have investigated the role of Ras as well as PKCα in Raf 1 activation. 1α,25(OH)2D3 was kindly provided by Hoffmann-La Roche. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, specific Ras inhibitory peptide (VPPPVPPRRR), and protein A-Sepharose were from Sigma. Lipofectin was from Invitrogen. Sense and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by the DNAgency (Malvern, PA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphoserine antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Raf-1 monoclonal antibody and anti-(phospho)-active MAP kinase antibody (reactive against p42 and p44 isoforms) were from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-Ras-GTPase-activating protein (GAP) antibody and donkey anti-goat IgG antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG and the Super Signal CL-HRP substrate system for enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The compounds PD 98059, Ro 318220, calphostin C, and bisindolylmaleimide I were from Calbiochem. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Chick skeletal muscle cells were obtained from 13-day-old chick embryo breast muscles by stirring in Earle's balanced salt solution containing 0.06% trypsin for 30 min essentially as previously described (26Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 677-684PubMed Google Scholar). The freed cells were collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic-antimycotic solution. The suspension was dispersed by pipette, filtered through nylon mesh, and “preplated” on gelatin-coated Petri dishes to remove contaminating fibroblasts. The unadsorbed cells were seeded at an appropriate density (120,000 cells/cm2) in Petri dishes (100-mm diameter) and cultured at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere (air 95%, 5% CO2). Under these conditions, myoblasts divide within the first 48 h and at day 4 become differentiated into myotubes expressing both biochemical and morphological characteristics of adult skeletal muscle fibers (27Capiati D.A. Limbozzi F. Téllez Iñón M.T. Boland R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cells cultured for 2 days (proliferative stage) were used for treatments. After 1α,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle (ethanol, < 0.01%) treatment, muscle cells were lysed (15 min at 4 °C) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40 and homogenized by sonication for 15 s. Insoluble material was pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 ×g for 15 min. The protein content of the clear lysates was determined according to Lowry et al. (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 195: 265-277Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Aliquots (500–700 μg of protein) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Raf-1 or anti-Ras-GAP antibodies followed by precipitation of the complexes with protein A conjugated with Sepharose. The immune complexes were washed 4 times with cold immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100m and 1% Nonidet P-40) and a final wash in cold phosphate-buffered saline. Insoluble material of lysate proteins was pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 ×g for 15 min. The protein content of the clear lysates was determined according to Lowry et al. (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 195: 265-277Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Aliquots (500 μg of protein) were incubated with anti-Raf-1 or anti-goat IgG antibody on an ice bath with shaking for 10 min. Then the lysates were exposed to 1 nm 1α,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle (ethanol < 0.01%) for 1 min. The treatments were stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins (or lysate proteins) dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide (8%) gels (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20) containing 5% dry milk. Membranes were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-PKCα, anti-phosphoserine, or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Next the membranes were washed 3 times in TBST, incubated in TBST containing 1% dry milk with a 1:10,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, and washed 3 additional times with TBST. The membranes were then visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescent technique (ECL, AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Images were obtained with a model GS-700 Imaging Densitomer from Bio-Rad by scanning at 600 dots per inch and printing at the same resolution. Bands were quantified using the Molecular Analyst program (Bio-Rad). To strip the membranes for reprobing with anti-Raf-1, anti Ras-GAP, or anti-ERK1/2 antibodies, the membranes were washed for 10 min in TBST and then incubated in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 50 mm mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 50 °C. The membranes were again blocked and blotted as described above. Muscle cells were pretreated with PD 98059 (10 μm, 10 min) or Ras inhibitor peptide (25 μm, 10 min) and then exposed for 1 min with 1 nm 1α,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle (< 0.01% ethanol) at 37 °C. Lysates were prepared followed by immunoprecipitation of MAP kinase (p42 and p44) as described above. After 3 washes with immunoprecipitation buffer and 2 washes with kinase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0,1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin), the immune complexes were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in kinase buffer (50 μl/sample) containing myelin basic protein as an exogenous substrate for MAP kinase (20 μg/assay), 25 μm ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP (2.5 μCi/assay). To terminate the reaction, the phosphorylated product was separated from free isotope on ion exchange phosphocellulose filters (Whatman P-81). Papers were immersed immediately into ice-cold 75 mmH3PO4, washed (1 × 5 min, 3 × 20 min), and counted in a scintillation counter. Transfection with oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) using Lipofectin was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. ODNs were incubated with Lipofectin in DMEM for 15 min at room temperature. Plates of subconfluent cells were washed to remove serum before the addition of ODN-Lipofectin mixtures, and incubation was performed for 4 h at 37 °C. The ODN solution was removed, DMEM was added, and the plates were placed into a metabolic incubator for an additional period of 20 h. Control treatments included DMEM or Lipofectin only. Dose- and time-response studies for Lipofectin and ODNs were previously performed to establish optimum conditions for the effective blockade of PKCα expression (25Capiati D.A. Vazquez G. Tellez-Iñón M.T. Boland R.L. Cell Prolif. 2001; 33: 307-315Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The following ODN sequences with phosphorothioate linkages throughout the entire ODN molecule were used: antisense-PKCα (AS), 5′-CATGGTYCCCCCCAACCACC-3′, Y = T or C (antisense sequence against 20 nucleotides upstream of the AUG codon); sense PKCα (S), 5′-GGTGGTTGGGGGGRACCATG-3′, R = A or G (25Capiati D.A. Vazquez G. Tellez-Iñón M.T. Boland R.L. Cell Prolif. 2001; 33: 307-315Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Each antisense oligonucleotide was used at a final concentration of 5 μm. These antisense sequences showed no homology to any DNA in the GenBankTM except PKCα (human, rat, mouse, and rabbit species). Cell death in cultures under control and treatment (ODNs) conditions was measured by trypan blue staining. Statistical significance of the data was evaluated using Student's t test (30Snedecor G. Cochran W. Statistical Methods. Iowa State University Press, Ames, Iowa1967: 59-62Google Scholar), and probability values below 0.05 (p < 0.05) were considered significant. Results are expressed as the means ± S.D. from the indicated set of experiments. To understand how the steroid hormone 1α,25(OH)2D3 controls the MAP kinase cascade in skeletal muscle cells, it is essential to identify the molecules that participate in the cellular sequence of events involved in the signaling pathway of this steroid hormone. As in other cell types, Raf-1 and MEK belong to the MAP kinase cascade that leads to muscle cell proliferation (31Pizon V. Baldacci G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6074-6081Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Lin C.C. Shyr M.H. Chien C.S. Wang C.C. Chiu C.T. Hsiao L.D. Yang C.M. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As a major step in this direction, we report here for the first time that 1α,25(OH)2D3 stimulation of the MAPK (ERK1/2) pathway in skeletal muscle cells involves at least in part rapid activation of Raf-1 and provide information on the mechanism of action by which this hormone-regulated event takes place. The complex process of Raf activation is still incompletely understood. Existing data suggest that activation of Raf-1 engages multiple factors and steps (9Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 10Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of Raf-1 on Ser 338 and Tyr-341 is a critical step in this process (11Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the serine-threonine kinase Raf-1 is part of the 1α,25(OH)2D3-signaling mechanism in chick muscle cells, we first investigated the effect of the steroid hormone on Raf-1 serine phosphorylation. To that end, muscle cells were exposed to 1 nm 1,25(OH)2D3 (0.5–5 min), and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a highly specific anti-Raf-1 monoclonal antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphoserine antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, 1α,25(OH)2D3caused a time-dependent increase in Raf-1 phosphorylation in muscle cells. The stimulation of Raf-1 serine phosphorylation could be detected already at 30 s, increased 1-fold over basal at 60 s, and reached a maximum after 2 min of hormone exposure (3-fold). It has been reported that the small G protein Ras is the direct upstream activator of Raf, which in its GTP-bound activated form binds to the Ras binding domain (Raf-RBD) and recruits the inactive cytoplasmic Raf to the plasma membrane for activation (33Slupsky J.R. Weber C.K. Ludwing S. Rapp U.R. Bannasch P. Kondac D. Papa S. Tager J.M. Cell Growth and Oncogenesis. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1998Google Scholar). This binding induces a conformational change of Raf-1 that yields an opened structure suitable for phosphorylation by membrane-associated kinases. To study Ras-dependent changes in Raf activation induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3, muscle cells were preincubated for 2 h with a specific Ras inhibitor peptide, which blocks the association of Grb2 and Sos1 and, thus, the nucleotide exchange of Ras, avoiding its activation (34Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), followed by hormone treatment (1 nm, 2 min). As shown in Fig. 2, Ras inhibition abolished Raf-1 serine phosphorylation by 1α,25(OH)2D3, demonstrating that Ras is necessary for 1α,25(OH)2D3-Raf-1 activation in these cells. At the concentration used (25 μm), it is likely that sufficient amounts of the inhibitor peptide entered the cells by endocytosis to reach the K d (25 nm) for its binding to Grb2 (35Lemmon M.A. Ladbury J.E. Mandiyan V. Zhou M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31653-31658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ras proteins play a central role in control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and other cellular functions (36Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). They function by cycling between inactive GDP- and active GTP-bound forms. This molecular switch is mainly regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which catalyze an exchange of GTP for GDP, and by GAPs, which activate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras and, thus, convert Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP (37Sasa H. Nakata H. Umekage T. Namina M. Tomiyama K. Arimura S. Kobayashi M. Watanabe Y. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 121-124Google Scholar). It has been reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GAPs on Tyr-460 allows rise of its GTPase activity (38Borowski P. Kornetzky L. Heiland M. Roloff S. Weber W. Laufs R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 39: 635-646PubMed Google Scholar), promoting Ras inactivation. Therefore, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GAP would promote Ras inactivation by Ras-GAP-induced hydrolysis of Ras-GTP bound. We next explored the effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3 on Ras-GAP tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 3, muscle cells treated with 1 nm1α,25(OH)2D3 showed a rapid and transient tyrosine de-phosphorylation of Ras-GAP, which was maximal at 0.5 min (−80%) and returned to basal level upon 10 min of hormone exposure. This result suggests that inhibition of Ras-GTP hydrolysis is part of the mechanism by which 1α,25(OH)2D3 activates Ras in skeletal muscle cells. PKC, discovered as a serine/threonine kinase (39Parker P.J. Coussens L. Totty N. Rhee L. Young S. Chen E. Stabel S. Waterfield M.D. Ullrich A. Science. 1986; 233: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), mediates intracellular responses to a variety of agonists including 1α,25(OH)2D3 (40Walters M.R. Endocrinol. Rev. 1992; 13: 719-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The direct phosphorylation of Raf-1 by PKC isoforms has been suggested as an activation mechanism of PKC on the Raf-1/ERK1/2-signaling pathway (16Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 18Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Humme l R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). In previous investigations we have demonstrated that stimulation of the extracellular signal-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2 by 1α,25(OH)2D3 is mediated by PKC and Ca2+ (23Morelli S. Buitrago C. Boland R. de Boland A.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 173: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These data prompted us to study whether PKC participates in Raf-1 serine phosphorylation induced by the hormone. To that end, muscle cells were pretreated with the PKC inhibitors calphostin C or bisindolylmaleimide I and stimulated with 1α,25(OH)2D3 (1 nm, 2 min) followed by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-Raf-1 antibody and then immunoblotting with anti-phosphoserine antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, Raf-1 serine phosphorylation was suppressed by either PKC inhibitor. Moreover, Ro 318220, a PKC specific inhibitor that blocks all PKC isoforms completely, abolished Raf-1 serine phosphorylation (Fig. 5) and further confirmed that hormone activation of Raf-1 is a PKC-dependent event. It has been shown that PKCα can directly phosphorylate and activate Raf-1 in other cell types (18Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Humme l R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). PKCα belongs to the family of conventional protein kinases that are Ca2+-dependent. It is well recognized that when skeletal muscle cells are subjected to 1α,25(OH)2D3 stimulation, a rapid increase of intracellular Ca2+ (22Morelli S. Buitrago C. Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36021-36028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), inositol trisphosphate, and diacylglycerol (43Morelli S. de Boland A.R. Boland R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and activation of PKCα (44Capiati D. Vazquez G. Tellez-Iñón M.T. Boland R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) occurs. To demonstrate that PKCα is involved in Raf-1 activation, we used antisense technology to block PKCα protein expression. Cultured muscle cells were transfected with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against 20 nucleotides upstream of the AUG codon of PKCα mRNA to suppress expression of its encoded protein. Under these conditions, phosphorylation of Raf-1 induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3 was fully abolished (Fig. 6 A, upper panel). Suppression of PKCα expression was verified by immunoblotting of cell lysates with anti-PKCα antibody (Fig. 6 A, bottom panel). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that other PKC isoforms may also contribute to Raf-1 serine phosphorylation, our results clearly show that PKCα is also a component of the mitogenic pathway leading to Raf-1 activation in response to 1α,25(OH)2D3 stimulation.Figure 5The PKC inhibitor Ro 318220 blocks the activation of Raf-1 induced by 1,25(OH)2D3. Muscle cells were treated with 1 nm 1,25(OH)2D3 for 2 min in the absence or presence of Ro 318220 (200 nm).

To measure MAPK activity, the enzyme from cell lysates exposed for 1 min to the hormone (1 nm) was immunoprecipitated with an anti-(phospho)-active MAPK antibody, which recognizes both the p42 and p44 active isoforms, and then incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and myelin basic protein, as exogenous MAPK substrate. As previously shown (22Morelli S. Buitrago C. Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36021-36028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), 1α,25(OH)2D3 caused a 3-fold increase in MAP kinase activity (Fig. 7). The hormone effect was abolished by either the Ras inhibitor peptide or compound PD 98059, which prevents the activation of the dual MAPK kinase MEK by Raf-1 (45Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). These results are in agreement with previous observations showing that PD 98059 prevents the stimulation of skeletal muscle cell proliferation by 1α,25(OH)2D3 (22Morelli S. Buitrago C. Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36021-36028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When muscle cell lysates were preincubated with anti-Raf-1 antibody and then exposed to 1α,25(OH)2D3 (1 nm, 1 min), hormone-induced MAPK tyrosine phosphorylation was also abolished (Fig. 8). Furthermore, suppression of PKCα expression in cells transfected with the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against PKCα mRNA abolished by 70% the phosphorylation of MAPK induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 9). These results stress the relevance of PKCα, Ras, Raf-1, and MEK in the 1α,25(OH)2D3-signaling pathway, which results in MAP kinase stimulation in muscle cells.Figure 81α,25(OH)2D3stimulation of MAP kinase tyrosine phosphorylation (P) is suppressed by antibody inhibition of Raf-1. After cell lysis, comparable aliquots of lysate protein (500 μg) were incubated with anti-Raf antibody (2 μg) or anti-goat IgG antibody (2 μg, as a control of the basal levels of MAP kinase) on an ice bath for 10 min. Then the lysates were exposed to 1α,25(OH)2D3(1 nm) or vehicle ethanol (<0.01%) for 1 min.

More specifically, we recently reported that activation of MAPK by 1α,25(OH)2D3 in muscle cells is preceded by rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the vitamin D receptor followed by its association with Src (47Buitrago C. Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Subsequent interaction with the Shc-Grb2-Sos-Ras complex may then occur as observed in keratinocytes (48Gniadecki R. J. Invest.

However, the involvement of a novel 1α,25(OH)2D3 membrane receptor, whose existence in various hormone target cell types has received experimental support (41Baran D.T. Quail J.M. Ray R. Leszyk J.

In summary, our results demonstrate for the first time in a 1α,25(OH)2D3 target cell that activation of Raf-1 via Ras (through inhibition of Ras-GAP activity by tyrosine dephosphorylation) and PKCα-dependent serine phosphorylation play a central role in hormone stimulation of the MAPK-signaling pathway (depicted in the schematic diagram of Fig. 10)."

The leishmanial single-copy genes predict a sulfurtransferase that is structurally peculiar in possessing a C-terminal domain of some 70 amino acids. Homologous genes of Trypanosoma cruzi andTrypanosoma brucei encode enzymes with a similar C-terminal domain, suggesting that this feature, not known in any other sulfurtransferase, is a characteristic of trypanosomatid parasites. Short truncations of the C-terminal domain resulted in misfolded inactive proteins, demonstrating that the domain plays some key role in facilitating correct folding of the enzymes. The leishmanial recombinant enzymes exhibited high activity toward 3-mercaptopyruvate and catalyzed the transfer of sulfane sulfur to cyanide to form thiocyanate. They also used thiosulfate as a substrate and reduced thioredoxin as the accepting nucleophile, the latter being oxidized. The enzymes were expressed in all life cycle stages, and the expression level was increased under peroxide or hypo-sulfur stress. The results are consistent with the enzymes having an involvement in the synthesis of sulfur amino acids per se or iron-sulfur centers of proteins and the parasite's management of oxidative stress.

The enzymes catalyze the transfer of sulfane sulfur from a donor molecule, such as thiosulfate or 3-mercaptopyruvate, to a nucleophilic acceptor, such as cyanide or mercaptoethanol. However, the natural sulfane donors and acceptors and the physiological functions of most sulfurtransferases remain uncertain.The rhodanese family sulfurtransferases are thought to occur in the majority of organisms (1Bordo D. Bork P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), with the mammalian enzymes being the most extensively studied (3Luo G.X. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

The first elucidated role of mitochondrial bovine liver rhodanese was the detoxification of cyanide to form thiocyanate, which is harmless and excreted by the kidney. This role could be important, especially in the epithelial cells lining the gut (5Picton R. Eggo M.C. Merrill G.A. Langman M.J. Singh S. Gut. 2002; 50: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but is thought not to account for the wide distribution of these sulfurtransferases in different cell types (2Nakamura T. Yamaguchi Y. Sano H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5621-5630Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Another putative function of at least some sulfurtransferases is the provision of sulfane sulfur required for the formation of the iron-sulfur centers of proteins, notably respiratory proteins (6Marquet A.

Bovine rhodanese has a 1000-fold higher affinity for the reduced form of thioredoxin than for cyanide and so may function in peroxide detoxification (4Nandi D.L. Horowitz P.M. Westley J. Int. J.

A reaction analogous to that of sulfane-loaded sulfurtransferase with thioredoxin is also thought to be a critical step in the synthesis of thiouridine (7Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol.

Florentin D. Marquet A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2688-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and molybdopterin (14Leimkuhler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, a role for sulfurtransferases in assimilatory sulfate reduction by transferring a molecule of sulfide toO-acetyl-l-serine in the synthesis of cysteine has been postulated (15Schmidt A. Jager K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 325-349Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Most sulfurtransferases have an N-terminal “structural” domain and a C-terminal domain containing the active site (1Bordo D. Bork P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 16Bordo D. Deriu D. Colnaghi R. Carpen A. Pagani S. Bolognesi M. J. Mol.

The vertebrate rhodaneses have been extensively studied in attempts to understand the part played by the N-terminal structural domain in the correct folding and stability of the enzymes. Current evidence suggests, however, that correct protein folding also requires the assistance of a chaperone molecule (18Luo G.X. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

The diseases they cause are most prevalent in the tropics and subtropics, although leishmaniasis is also endemic in Southern Europe and has been reported in the United States (20McHugh C.P. Melby P.C. LaFon S.G. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1996; 55: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). There is a pressing need to improve ways of treating the diseases; and in particular, there is a requirement for better chemotherapy (21Croft S.L. Yardley V. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 319-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar).Leishmania is an excellent organism in which to investigate the possible roles of sulfurtransferases in antioxidant and sulfur amino acid metabolism. The parasites exist intracellularly in macrophages while within their mammalian host and are thought to be particularly well adapted to survive against oxidative stress arising from the immune mechanisms of the host. Leishmania is unusual in possessing trypanothione, a conjugate of glutathione and spermidine, as a major cellular thiol and apparently uses this and associated enzymes as a prime means of protection against oxidative damage (22Miller M.A. McGowan S.E. Gantt K.R. Champion M. Novick S.L. Andersen K.A. Bacchi C.J. Yarlett N. Britigan B.E. Wilson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33883-33889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Krauth-Siegel R.L. Coombs G.H. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 404-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the source of cysteine, essential for trypanothione, is unknown. In this study, we describe the cloning, expression, and characterization of a sulfurtransferase of the protozoan parasites Leishmania major and Leishmania mexicana and provide data on its unusual structure and possible roles.DISCUSSIONWe have characterized at the molecular and biochemical levels an MST that is expressed throughout the life cycle of L. majorand L. mexicana. The leishmanial single-copy genes predict an unusual sulfurtransferase that, in comparison with other known sulfurtransferases, has an additional C-terminal domain of some 70 amino acids. The discovery that this domain is also encoded in a gene of T. cruzi and T. brucei suggests that the feature is conserved among trypanosomatid parasites and so has some key function. Importantly, it distinguishes the parasites' enzymes from their mammalian counterparts. A possible role of the unusual C-terminal domain was highlighted by the finding that the leishmanial MST can refold successfully without a chaperone, which is in contrast to the results reported for sulfurtransferases from other sources (21Croft S.L. Yardley V. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 319-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar,39Ellis R.J. Hemmingsten S.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 339-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 40Mendoza J.A. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28739-28743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the unusual C-terminal domain may play some part in this. The finding that the proteins with truncated C termini were misfolded and showed very little activity is consistent with this postulate.Analysis of the recombinant enzyme has clearly shown that the enzyme prefers 3-mercaptopyruvate to thiosulfate as the donor substrate. This substrate preference correlates well with the active-site residues being homologous to other eukaryotic MSTs rather than rhodaneses. TheK m and V max values obtained compare favorably with those reported for bacterial, plant, and vertebrate MSTs (1Bordo D. Bork P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 42Nagahara N. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27395-27401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The very high activity toward 3-mercaptopyruvate suggests that this could function as a natural substrate, although currently, there is nothing known about the levels of this compound in Leishmania parasites or any roles that it may have.The finding that the leishmanial sulfurtransferases can use thioredoxin as an acceptor with a K m of 300 nmsuggests that this could also be one natural substrate. It has been demonstrated previously that the thioredoxin from E. colican serve as a sulfur acceptor substrate for the E. colisulfurtransferase when thiosulfate is near its K m(10Ray W.K. Zeng G. Potters M.B. Mansuri A.M. Larson T.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2277-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and it has also been shown that mammalian sulfurtransferases can utilize thioredoxin (4Nandi D.L. Horowitz P.M. Westley J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). At one time, thioredoxin was considered to be absent in Leishmania (see Ref. 25Sacks D.L. Hieny S. Sher A. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 564-569PubMed Google Scholar); however, a thioredoxin-like gene has been identified in L. major(GenBankTM/EBI accession number AAG10802 ) and T. brucei (43Reckenfelderbaumer N. Ludemann H. Schmidt H. Steverding D. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7547-7552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). One possible function of the interaction between a sulfurtransferase and thioredoxin could be the involvement of the enzyme in reduction and detoxification of peroxides (4Nandi D.L. Horowitz P.M. Westley J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The finding that the leishmanial enzyme cannot catalyze this reaction suggests that it must have some other role. The oxidation status of thioredoxin is thought to be crucial in regulating a number of cellular reactions, and so the oxidation by the leishmanial sulfurtransferase of reduced thioredoxin implicates this enzyme in similar processes.The antioxidant machinery of trypanosomatids has been considered to rely almost exclusively on trypanothione and its associated enzymes (23Krauth-Siegel R.L. Coombs G.H. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 404-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, other enzyme systems may well also be involved. The up-regulation of LmajMST upon exposure of L. majorpromastigotes to the oxidant cumene hydroperoxide shows that MST may be an important additional enzymatic mechanism for protection against oxidative stress.The up-regulation of MST upon culturing L. majorpromastigotes without an exogenous source of sulfur suggests that the enzyme might also have a physiological role in sulfur amino acid metabolism. The expression of RhdA, a rhodanese-like protein ofSynechococcus sp. strain PCC7942, is also induced by sulfur starvation (44Laudenbach D.E. Ehrhardt D. Green L. Grossman A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2751-2760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, sulfurtransferases have been implicated in the metabolism of sulfur as shown by the formation and regulation of iron-sulfur centers of proteins (9Ogata K. Volini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8087-8093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another possible role of the sulfurtransferase in Leishmania is that it functions to provide sulfide for the cysteine synthesis pathway. We have shown that LmajMST works in conjunction with both recombinant L. majorcysteine synthase (GenBankTM accession number AL499624) and recombinant L. major cystathionine β-synthase (accession number AL499619) to synthesize cysteine in vitro. T. cruzi cystathionine β-synthase was also recently reported to possess cysteine synthase activity (45Nozaki T. Shigeta Y. Saito-Nakano Y. Imada M. Kruger W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6516-6523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Eukaryotic MSTs can be cytosolic or mitochondrial (22Miller M.A. McGowan S.E. Gantt K.R. Champion M. Novick S.L. Andersen K.A. Bacchi C.J. Yarlett N. Britigan B.E. Wilson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33883-33889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 42Nagahara N.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Both the immunolocalization and fractionation data suggest that the MST ofL. major occurs within the cytosol. The only other report on a sulfurtransferase of a protozoon (33Watanebe F. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1985; 49: 2203-2204Google Scholar) suggest that an enzyme inEuglena gracilis is also distributed in the cytosol.The results obtained provide compelling evidence thatLeishmania contains a high level of activity of a structurally unusual sulfurtransferase that has a strong activity toward 3-mercaptopyruvate and thioredoxin and that plays some role in antioxidant and sulfur amino acid metabolism. The finding that the enzyme itself differs structurally from mammalian counterparts and is expressed in the mammalian form of the parasite suggests the possibility that it may have a crucial role in the parasite and so represent a possibly useful drug target. Very little is known about sulfurtransferases in protozoa, but the findings reported here suggest that study of them will yield interesting new insights into the roles and structures of this widespread class of enzymes. Sulfurtransferases (EC 2.8.1.1–5) are widely distributed enzymes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1Bordo D. Bork P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 2Nakamura T. Yamaguchi Y. Sano H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5621-5630Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1991; 266: 13044-13049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Leishmania parasites are widespread and important parasites of humans and dogs. The diseases they cause are most prevalent in the tropics and subtropics, although leishmaniasis is also endemic in Southern Europe and has been reported in the United States (20McHugh C.P. Melby P.C. LaFon S.G. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1996; 55: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). There is a pressing need to improve ways of treating the diseases; and in particular, there is a requirement for better chemotherapy (21Croft S.L. Yardley V. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 319-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar).Leishmania is an excellent organism in which to investigate the possible roles of sulfurtransferases in antioxidant and sulfur amino acid metabolism. The parasites exist intracellularly in macrophages while within their mammalian host and are thought to be particularly well adapted to survive against oxidative stress arising from the immune mechanisms of the host. Leishmania is unusual in possessing trypanothione, a conjugate of glutathione and spermidine, as a major cellular thiol and apparently uses this and associated enzymes as a prime means of protection against oxidative damage (22Miller M.A. McGowan S.E. Gantt K.R. Champion M. Novick S.L. Andersen K.A. Bacchi C.J. Yarlett N. Britigan B.E. Wilson M.E. J. Biol.

Today. 1999; 15: 404-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the source of cysteine, essential for trypanothione, is unknown. In this study, we describe the cloning, expression, and characterization of a sulfurtransferase of the protozoan parasites Leishmania major and Leishmania mexicana and provide data on its unusual structure and possible roles. DISCUSSIONWe have characterized at the molecular and biochemical levels an MST that is expressed throughout the life cycle of L. majorand L. mexicana. The leishmanial single-copy genes predict an unusual sulfurtransferase that, in comparison with other known sulfurtransferases, has an additional C-terminal domain of some 70 amino acids. The discovery that this domain is also encoded in a gene of T. cruzi and T. brucei suggests that the feature is conserved among trypanosomatid parasites and so has some key function. Importantly, it distinguishes the parasites' enzymes from their mammalian counterparts. A possible role of the unusual C-terminal domain was highlighted by the finding that the leishmanial MST can refold successfully without a chaperone, which is in contrast to the results reported for sulfurtransferases from other sources (21Croft S.L. Yardley V. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 319-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar,39Ellis R.J. Hemmingsten S.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 339-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 40Mendoza J.A. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28739-28743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the unusual C-terminal domain may play some part in this. The finding that the proteins with truncated C termini were misfolded and showed very little activity is consistent with this postulate.Analysis of the recombinant enzyme has clearly shown that the enzyme prefers 3-mercaptopyruvate to thiosulfate as the donor substrate. This substrate preference correlates well with the active-site residues being homologous to other eukaryotic MSTs rather than rhodaneses. TheK m and V max values obtained compare favorably with those reported for bacterial, plant, and vertebrate MSTs (1Bordo D. Bork P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 42Nagahara N. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27395-27401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The very high activity toward 3-mercaptopyruvate suggests that this could function as a natural substrate, although currently, there is nothing known about the levels of this compound in Leishmania parasites or any roles that it may have.The finding that the leishmanial sulfurtransferases can use thioredoxin as an acceptor with a K m of 300 nmsuggests that this could also be one natural substrate. It has been demonstrated previously that the thioredoxin from E. colican serve as a sulfur acceptor substrate for the E. colisulfurtransferase when thiosulfate is near its K m(10Ray W.K. Zeng G. Potters M.B. Mansuri A.M. Larson T.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2277-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and it has also been shown that mammalian sulfurtransferases can utilize thioredoxin (4Nandi D.L. Horowitz P.M. Westley J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). At one time, thioredoxin was considered to be absent in Leishmania (see Ref. 25Sacks D.L. Hieny S. Sher A. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 564-569PubMed Google Scholar); however, a thioredoxin-like gene has been identified in L. major(GenBankTM/EBI accession number AAG10802 ) and T. brucei (43Reckenfelderbaumer N. Ludemann H. Schmidt H. Steverding D. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7547-7552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). One possible function of the interaction between a sulfurtransferase and thioredoxin could be the involvement of the enzyme in reduction and detoxification of peroxides (4Nandi D.L. Horowitz P.M. Westley J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The finding that the leishmanial enzyme cannot catalyze this reaction suggests that it must have some other role. The oxidation status of thioredoxin is thought to be crucial in regulating a number of cellular reactions, and so the oxidation by the leishmanial sulfurtransferase of reduced thioredoxin implicates this enzyme in similar processes.The antioxidant machinery of trypanosomatids has been considered to rely almost exclusively on trypanothione and its associated enzymes (23Krauth-Siegel R.L. Coombs G.H. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 404-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, other enzyme systems may well also be involved. The up-regulation of LmajMST upon exposure of L. majorpromastigotes to the oxidant cumene hydroperoxide shows that MST may be an important additional enzymatic mechanism for protection against oxidative stress.The up-regulation of MST upon culturing L. majorpromastigotes without an exogenous source of sulfur suggests that the enzyme might also have a physiological role in sulfur amino acid metabolism. The expression of RhdA, a rhodanese-like protein ofSynechococcus sp. strain PCC7942, is also induced by sulfur starvation (44Laudenbach D.E. Ehrhardt D. Green L. Grossman A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2751-2760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, sulfurtransferases have been implicated in the metabolism of sulfur as shown by the formation and regulation of iron-sulfur centers of proteins (9Ogata K. Volini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8087-8093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another possible role of the sulfurtransferase in Leishmania is that it functions to provide sulfide for the cysteine synthesis pathway. We have shown that LmajMST works in conjunction with both recombinant L. majorcysteine synthase (GenBankTM accession number AL499624) and recombinant L. major cystathionine β-synthase (accession number AL499619) to synthesize cysteine in vitro. T. cruzi cystathionine β-synthase was also recently reported to possess cysteine synthase activity (45Nozaki T. Shigeta Y. Saito-Nakano Y. Imada M. Kruger W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6516-6523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Eukaryotic MSTs can be cytosolic or mitochondrial (22Miller M.A. McGowan S.E. Gantt K.R. Champion M. Novick S.L. Andersen K.A. Bacchi C.J. Yarlett N. Britigan B.E. Wilson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33883-33889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 42Nagahara N.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Both the immunolocalization and fractionation data suggest that the MST ofL. major occurs within the cytosol. The only other report on a sulfurtransferase of a protozoon (33Watanebe F. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1985; 49: 2203-2204Google Scholar) suggest that an enzyme inEuglena gracilis is also distributed in the cytosol.The results obtained provide compelling evidence thatLeishmania contains a high level of activity of a structurally unusual sulfurtransferase that has a strong activity toward 3-mercaptopyruvate and thioredoxin and that plays some role in antioxidant and sulfur amino acid metabolism. The finding that the enzyme itself differs structurally from mammalian counterparts and is expressed in the mammalian form of the parasite suggests the possibility that it may have a crucial role in the parasite and so represent a possibly useful drug target. Very little is known about sulfurtransferases in protozoa, but the findings reported here suggest that study of them will yield interesting new insights into the roles and structures of this widespread class of enzymes.

Five members of the RecQ family have been found in humans, but only two of them have been carefully characterized, BLM and WRN. In this work, we describe the enzymatic characterization of RECQ1. The helicase has 3′ to 5′ polarity, cannot start the unwinding from a blunt-ended terminus, and needs a 3′-single-stranded DNA tail longer than 10 nucleotides to open the substrate. However, it was also able to unwind a blunt-ended duplex DNA with a “bubble” of 25 nucleotides in the middle, as previously observed for WRN and BLM. We show that only short DNA duplexes (<30 bp) can be unwound by RECQ1 alone, but the addition of human replication protein A (hRPA) increases the processivity of the enzyme (>100 bp). Our studies done with Escherichia colisingle-strand binding protein (SSB) indicate that the helicase activity of RECQ1 is specifically stimulated by hRPA. This finding suggests that RECQ1 and hRPA may interact also in vivo and function together in DNA metabolism. Comparison of the present results with previous studies on WRN and BLM provides novel insight into the role of the N- and C-terminal domains of these helicases in determining their substrate specificity and in their interaction with hRPA.

Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). These enzymes are involved in most aspects of nucleic acid metabolism, such as DNA replication, DNA repair, recombination, transcription, RNA processing, and translation (2Matson S.W. Bean D.W. George J.W. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Alterations of genes that code for helicases cause several human disorders (3Ellis N.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For example, two genes, XPB and XPD, encode for helicases that are defective in individuals with xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome, respectively (4Weeda G. van Ham R.C. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. van der Eb A.J. Hoeijmakers J.H. Cell. 1990; 62: 777-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Bloom's, Werner's, and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes are additional genetic disorders that arise as a consequence of abnormalities in three different members of the RecQ family of helicases named BLM, WRN, and RECQ4, respectively (5Ellis N.A. Groden J., Ye, T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 6Yu C.E. Oshima J., Fu, Y.H.

Lindor N.M. Shiratori M. Furuichi Y. Shimamoto A. Genomics. 1999; 61: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In all three syndromes, cells from affected individuals show inherent genomic instability, indicating that these RecQ helicases play a role in the maintenance of chromosome stability. The name RecQ derives from the first helicase of the family discovered in Escherichia coli (8Umezu K. Nakayama H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Nakayama K. Irino N. Nakayama H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 200: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Successively, members of the RecQ helicase family have been found in organisms that range from bacteria to plants and animals (10Kusano K. Berres M.E. Engels W.R. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1027-1039PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ozsoy A.Z. Sekelsky J.J. Matson S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2986-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In microorganisms likeE. coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, andSchizosaccharomyces pombe, only one representative per species is present, whereas higher eukaryotes contain more than one RecQ helicase. For example, five members of the RecQ family have been found so far in human cells, RECQ1, WRN, BLM, RECQ4, and RECQ5 (12Karow J.K., Wu, L. Hickson I.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). All of them share a common central domain of ∼450 amino acids containing seven highly conserved motifs also present in several helicases from other families (13Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Among these motifs are an ATP-binding sequence (Walker A box) and the DEXH box, which is instead characteristic of the RecQ family. The RecQ helicases are divided in two classes according to the length of the N- and C-terminal domains. E. coli RecQ, human RECQ1, and RECQ5 form the first group of RecQ helicases. They are characterized by short N- and C-terminal domains, and their sequences are between 400 and 650 amino acids long. The WRN, BLM, RECQ4, Sgs1p (from budding yeast), and Rqh1p (from fission yeast) helicases are part of the second group because they have extended N- and C-terminal tails and are all between 1300 and 1500 amino acids long. The function of these extended tails is still under investigation. One possibility is that the additional portions mediate the interaction of these helicases with other proteins. In fact, several proteins have been shown to interact with these longer helicases, such as replication protein A (14Brosh R.M., Jr. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H. Kenny M.K. Machwe A. Bohr V.A. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2879-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), whereas little or no information is available so far on the catalytic properties of the other three human helicases, RECQ1, RECQ4, and RECQ5 (27Sekelsky J.J. Brodsky M.H. Rubin G.M. Hawley R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3762-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Kitao S. Shimamoto A. Goto M. Miller R.W. Smithson W.A. Lindor N.M. Furuichi Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In this work, we describe the enzymatic characterization of the helicase activity of human RECQ1. The protein was purified from HeLa cells following a procedure similar to the one established in our laboratory for the purification of several other human DNA helicases (29Vindigni A. Ochem A. Triolo G. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Costa M. Ochem A. Staub A. Falaschi A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The possibility that the helicase activity of RECQ1 may be specifically stimulated by human replication protein A (hRPA),1 as in the case of the Werner's and Bloom's helicases, was also investigated. Comparison of our results with the previously reported hRPA stimulation of the WRN and BLM helicases provides novel insight into the roles that the N- and C-terminal tails and the central 450-amino acid domain of these RecQ helicases play in the interaction with hRPA. All salts, bovine serum albumin, dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and pepstatin were from Sigma. The M13mp18 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) plasmid, the serum used to grow the HeLa cells, glutamine, and gentamycin were from Invitrogen. All resins used for the different purification steps were from AmershamBiosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). Most of the purification steps were carried out using an AKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Gel filtration studies were performed with a TSK-GEL G3000SW column (60 cm × 7.5 mm; TOSOH BIOSEP, Stuttgart, Germany). All ssDNA oligonucleotides used to make the DNA substrates were purchased from Sigma (Cambs, UK). The radioactive nucleoside triphosphates were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK). The T4 polynucleotide kinase and sequencing grade porcine trypsin for protein digestion were from Promega (Madison, WI). Recombinant hRPA containing all three subunits (RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14) was expressed in and purified from E. coli according to the previously described protocol (33Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24203-24208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in Joklin minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 2 mm glutamine and harvested as described previously (31Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Rahman K. Kang L.Y. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6785-6792Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All buffers used during the purification of RECQ1 contained 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as protease inhibitor. Buffer A contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol. Buffer B contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 70 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. The concentration of NaCl or KCl in all buffers was increased up to 1.0 m for eluting the proteins from the different columns. The RECQ1 helicase was purified from 300 g of frozen HeLa cells. The cell nuclei were isolated and salt-extracted with 0.4 m NaCl following the procedure described by Dignam et al. (34Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Successively, an additional salt extraction with 1.0 m NaCl was done to select specifically for proteins that bind tightly to DNA. The extracted proteins were precipitated by slowly adding ammonium sulfate (0.35 g/ml), collected by centrifugation at 25,000 × gfor 30 min in a Sorvall SS34 rotor, dialyzed in buffer A, and applied to a Bio-Rex column (2.5 × 33 cm) equilibrated with buffer A (35Tuteja N. Rahman K. Tuteja R. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Active fractions eluting at ∼0.4 m NaCl in buffer A were pooled (Fraction I, 78 ml). All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C, and the unwinding activity after each step of purification was monitored with a 5′-32P-labeled DNA substrate as described (29Vindigni A. Ochem A. Triolo G. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fraction I was first dialyzed in buffer B and then loaded onto a 10-ml Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer B. The proteins bound to the column were eluted using a linear gradient of 0.07–1.0 m KCl in buffer B. All active fractions eluting at the very beginning of the gradient were pooled (Fraction II, 85 ml) and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono S column. Elution was carried out with the same linear gradient used for the Q-Sepharose column, and the helicase eluted between 0.2 and 0.3 m KCl (Fraction III, 14 ml). Fraction III was dialyzed in buffer B and loaded onto a 4-ml ssDNA-cellulose column (1.6 × 2.5 cm) for the last step of purification. Elution was carried out with a linear gradient of 5 column volumes of 0.07–1.0 m KCl in buffer B. A major peak eluted at ∼0.24 m KCl. The active fractions were pooled together (Fraction IV, 8 ml, 44.800 units) and stored at −80 °C with 50% glycerol. The DNA substrates used in the helicase assay are listed in Fig. 5. They consist of different 32P-labeled oligonucleotides annealed either to M13mp18 phage ssDNA or to ssDNA fragments of different lengths to create a partial duplex. The sequence of the 99-bp oligonucleotide used for the determination of the direction of unwinding (see Fig. 5,A and B) is the same as that described previously (36Tuteja N. Rahman K. Tuteja R. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3613-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), as are the sequences of three oligonucleotides annealed to the M13mp18 phage ssDNA (see Fig. 5, D–G) (29Vindigni A. Ochem A. Triolo G. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 36Tuteja N. Rahman K. Tuteja R. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3613-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The substrate in Fig. 5 H was made using oligonucleotide 5′-CTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATT-3′ (33 bp), complementary to nucleotides (nt) 6231–6263 of M13mp18 phage ssDNA. The blunt-ended 25-bp duplex (see Fig. 5 C) was made by annealing oligonucleotide 5′-GATCTCGCATCACGTGACGAAGATC-3′ to its complement. The substrate in Fig. 5 I was made by annealing oligonucleotide 5′-GATCTCGCATCACGTGACGATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGATCTCGCATCACGTGACGA-3′ to a ssDNA fragment complementary to the oligonucleotide except for the 25 T stretch in the middle. Linear substrates with poly(dT) tails of different lengths were made using a 32P-labeled 29-bp oligonucleotide (5′-GTCAAATAGCAAACATGAAAGCATAAAAC-3′) annealed to complementary ssDNA fragments with 3′-tails of 10, 25, 50, and 75 dT nucleotides (see Fig. 5, K–N). The substrate with a double-strand region of 109 bp was made by PCR amplification of a M13mp18 fragment of the proper length. The forward primer for the PCR was annealed to region 28–47 of M13mp18, whereas the reverse primer was annealed to region 114–137. PCR conditions were as follows: 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 0,1% Triton X-100, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 1 μm each primer, and 2.5 units of Taqpolymerase (Promega) in a 50-μl reaction. Cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; and finally, elongation at 72 °C for 7 min. For all substrates, 25 ng of each oligonucleotide, labeled at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and 0.9 MBq of [γ-32P]ATP, were subsequently annealed to M13mp18 phage ssDNA (4 μg) in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm NaCl. The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 2 min and slowly cooled to room temperature. Each substrate was purified by gel filtration through a 5-ml Sepharose 4B column. The RNA/RNA substrate was obtained as follows. The pDEST17 vector (Invitrogen) containing the annexin II gene was linearized by EcoRV and transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) from the specific promoter, yielding a 2.2-kb RNA (30Costa M. Ochem A. Staub A. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A 16-bp RNA oligonucleotide complementary to the same region of annexin II (nt 53–68) was synthesized and labeled at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and 9.25 MBq of [γ-32P]ATP. About 8 pmol of labeled oligonucleotide were mixed with 13 pmol of synthesized annexin II RNA, heated at 95 °C for 1 min, and allowed to anneal by slow cooling. The substrates were then purified by gel filtration through a 5-ml Sepharose 4B column. The helicase assay measures the unwinding of a γ-32P-labeled DNA fragment from a partial duplex DNA molecule. The 10-μl reaction mixture contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 8 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 10 mm KCl, 4% (w/v) sucrose, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 32P-labeled helicase substrate (1000 cpm, 1 ng, ∼0.05 nm). The helicase fraction to be assayed was added to the mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.3% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. The products of the reaction were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried, and the extent of DNA unwinding was quantitated by electronic autoradiography (Instant Imager, Packard Instrument Co.). One unit of DNA helicase is defined as the amount of enzyme unwinding 1% of the substrate in 1 min at 37 °C (30% in 30 min) in the linear range of enzyme concentration dependence. The native molecular mass was determined by glycerol gradient centrifugation and gel filtration analysis following the procedure described previously (29Vindigni A. Ochem A. Triolo G. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,37Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Taneja P. Huang N.W. Simoncsits A. Susic S. Rahman K. Marusic L. Chen J. Zhang J.

Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). More precisely, for the glycerol gradient study, 100 μl of 50 nm RECQ1 were layered on a 15–35% glycerol gradient in buffer B and centrifuged at 320,000 × g for 20 h at 4 °C. The standard protein markers were also run under the same conditions. The markers were catalase (240 kDa, 11.3 S), aldolase (158 kDa, 7.4 S), BSA (66 kDa, 4.22 S), and ovalbumin (45 kDa, 3.5 S). Fractions of 0.2 ml were collected from the top of the tube using an HSI Auto Densi-Flow IIC apparatus (Buchler Instruments) and assayed for helicase activity. For gel filtration, a TSK-GEL G3000SW column (60 cm × 7.5 mm) was used in the AKTA FPLC system equilibrated with buffer B. The solution of RECQ1 was first concentrated from 50 to 500 nm and then loaded onto the column. The column was run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 0.25 ml were collected and assayed for helicase activity. The column was pre-calibrated using gel filtration molecular mass markers under the same conditions. The markers were thyroglobulin (670 kDa, Stokes radius of 85 Å), γ-globulin (158 kDa, 48.1 Å), BSA (66 kDa, 35.5 Å), ovalbumin (45 kDa, 30.5 Å), myoglobin (17 kDa, 21.2 Å), and vitamin B12(1.35 kDa). The partition coefficient K av is equal to (V e −V 0)/(V t −V 0), where V e is the elution volume of the sample, V 0 is the void volume, andV t is the total volume of the gel bed. The Stokes radius of RECQ1 was derived from the linear plot of (−logK av)1/2 versus the Stokes radius of the standard proteins. The molecular mass of RECQ1 was calculated from the Stokes radius and the sedimentation coefficient using the equation previously described (38Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). The Coomassie Blue- and silver-stained bands containing RECQ1 were cut out and digested with bovine trypsin (Promega). The digestion products were separated by micro-high pressure liquid chromatography and analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Finnigan LCQ DECA, Thermo-Finningan Corp., San Jose, CA). The human helicase RECQ1 was purified from the nuclear extract of HeLa cells following the purification steps described under ”Experimental Procedures.“ The final product was loaded on a 10% SDS-acrylamide gel for analysis of its purity. The silver-stained gel showed only a single band of ∼70 kDa (Fig. 1). Successively, the band was excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry for protein identification. Ten peptides pertaining to the human DNA helicase RECQ1 (75 kDa) were found in the sample (TableI). The five helicases of the RecQ family that have been found in human cells are characterized by a conserved central domain of ∼450 amino acids. On the other hand, the 10 peptides found by mass spectrometry have sequences that are unique for RECQ1, allowing us to be certain about the identity of the protein. Six peptides correspond to sequences located in the central domain of the protein, two in the N-terminal domain, and two in the C-terminal tail (Fig. 2).Table IAmino acid sequences of the peptides present in RECQ1 identified by mass spectrometryPositionsSequence32–38QQELIQK79–88VKDILQNVFK92–107FRPLQLETINVTMAGK186–193LIYVTPEK237–242ALGILK244–267QFPNASLIGLTATATNHVLTDAQK292–306QKPSNTEDFIEDIVK326–353DSEQVTVSLQNLGIHAGAYHANLEPEDK502–509QAEELNEK529–544VAGVVAPTLPREDLEK Open table in a new tab Figure 2RecQ helicase family.

Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 39Tuteja N. Ochem A. Taneja P. Tuteja R. Skopac D. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2457-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The result indicates that RECQ1 has a sedimentation coefficient of 7.3 ± 1.7 S and a Stokes radius of 49.5 ± 10.5 Å, corresponding to a native molecular mass of 160 ± 18 kDa, thus suggesting that the protein exists as a dimer in solution (Fig. 3). On the other hand, further studies will need to be done under different buffer conditions and with additional techniques to obtain more accurate information on the oligomerization state of this molecule. Concentration dependence studies under optimal assay conditions showed a maximum value of ∼100% unwinding in 30 min with 4 nmenzyme (Fig. 4 A). The sigmoidal shape at the very beginning of the titration curve is indicative of cooperative behavior, suggesting that more than one molecule of RECQ1 could be involved in DNA unwinding, as seen in the case of other helicases (1Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Kinetic measurements carried out in the presence of 1 nm enzyme (740 pg) showed that the unwinding rate was linear for up to 10 min and deviated from linearity with longer incubation times (Fig. 4 B). The helicase assays indicated that ATP and Mg2+ are indispensable for DNA unwinding. In addition, ATP dependence studies indicated that the optimal ATP concentration for DNA unwinding is between 4 and 5 mm (data not shown). Interestingly, we also observed that the addition of 80 μg/ml BSA increased the unwinding activity of RECQ1. This observation could be explained by previous studies showing that the presence of BSA increases the affinity of some proteins for DNA (40Arosio D. Cui S. Ortega C. Chovanec M., Di Marco S.

A, increasing amounts of RECQ1 were incubated in the standard 10-μl reaction mixture for 30 min at 37 °C. The concentration of enzyme (nanomolar) is indicated above each lane in the autoradiogram, whereas the substrate concentration was constant in all experiments (0.4 nm). B, the kinetics of unwinding were performed using 1 nm RECQ1 and the same reaction conditions used for the concentration dependence experiments.

The C and D lanes are control assays without enzyme and heat-denatured substrate, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The only information that was available on the helicase activity of human RECQ1 is that it unwinds DNA with 3′ to 5′ polarity, like the other members of the RecQ family characterized so far (42Seki M. Yanagisawa J. Kohda T. Sonoyama T., Ui, M. Enomoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This polarity of unwinding was confirmed by our experiments showing that RECQ1 needs a 3′-ssDNA tail to unwind the substrate (Fig. 5, A–C). Following this observation, a set of substrates with different structures and with various lengths of the double-strand regions were prepared to obtain novel information on the substrate specificity of RECQ1 (Fig. 5). Substrates with a 17-bp oligonucleotide annealed to M13 ssDNA were fully unwound by RECQ1, regardless of the presence or absence of mismatched hanging tails at the 5′-end, the 3′-end, or both (Fig. 5,D–G). However, if the duplex region was increased to 33 bp, the substrate could not be unwound (Fig. 5 H). Similarly to what has been already observed for the BLM and WRN helicases (43Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh R.M., Jr. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), RECQ1 was able to unwind a substrate with a ”bubble“ of 25 nt located in the center (Fig. 5 I). Other helicases previously purified in our laboratory have been shown to be able to unwind DNA/DNA as well as RNA/RNA duplexes (29Vindigni A. Ochem A. Triolo G. Falaschi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); in contrast, RECQ1 could not unwind RNA substrates (Fig. 5 J), indicating that it can work only as a DNA helicase. Finally, a series of linear substrates with 3′-single-strand tails of 10, 25, 50, and 75 dT were made to study the effect of tail length on the unwinding activity of RECQ1 (Fig. 5,K–N). Kinetic studies done with this series of substrates clearly sh"

Members of the superfamily play a crucial role in a large and varied set of biological processes in animals, plants, and fungi. In metazoan cells, kexins participate in both the constitutive and regulated secretory pathways, with substrates including hormones, serum proteins, neuropeptides, cell surface receptors, components of the extracellular matrix (ECM),1 and proteinases, which modify the ECM (1Seidah N.G.

Genetic data indicate that Kex2p activity somehow may influence the RNA polymerase II complex (18Martin C. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2341-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The Kex2p protein of Candida albicans, an opportunistic fungal pathogen, participates in pathways that lead to the expression of two of the organism's best characterized virulence factors: hyphal formation and the secretion of proteinases. Under hyphal-inducing conditions, kex2/kex2 cells are larger thanKEX2/KEX2 yeast, often have multiple buds and nuclei, and form short, thick, stubby protrusions instead of normal hyphae (8Newport G. Agabian N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28954-28961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). C. albicans kex2/kex2 mutants aberrantly process a secreted aspartyl proteinase (SAP), leading to diminished secretion of the enzyme (8Newport G. Agabian N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28954-28961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this study, we show thatkex2/kex2 C. albicans strains are markedly attenuated in a mouse model of systemic infection. In systemic candidiasis, where the primary site of pathogenesis is the kidney, the mutants are significantly less able to invade the kidney matrix than the wild type. Furthermore, the null strains do not produce hyphae either when ingested by macrophages, when grown embedded in agar, or when disseminated in mice. Because the pleiotropic nature of the nullkex2/kex2 phenotype cannot be entirely explained on the basis of known Kex2p substrates, we took advantage of the complete sequencing of the C. albicans genome (www-sequence.stanford.edu/group/candida/) to develop a purely informatic approach to identify and characterize potential Kex2p preproprotein substrates. We identified 147 ORFs whose products are potentially cleaved by Kex2p. Among these, a number of ORFs encode hydrolases, adhesins, cell wall components, and outer membrane proteins. In aggregate, the list of candidate Kex2p substrates represents a range of secreted and cell surface-associated activities that are important at the host-fungal interface, some of which are likely to play key roles in pathogenesis. Additionally, one of the putative substrates has structural motifs characteristic of S. cerevisiae α-factor and other fungal pheromones that require processing by kexin for activation. The identification of a potential substrate of Kex2p, which is structurally similar to α-factor, is consistent with recent studies that show that α cell derivatives of the kex2/kex2 strain are unable to mate witha cells, while kex2/kex2 acells mate at wild-type efficiency with α cells. 2Magee, B. B., Legrand, M., Alarco, A.-M., Raymond, M., and Magee, P. T. (2002) Mol. Microbiol. 46,1345–1351. Strains used in this study and their relevant phenotypes are: 1) SC5314, a wild-type blood isolate, 2) CNA1, Δura3::imm434/Δura3::imm434 KEX2/kex2::hisG-URA3-hisG, and 3) CNA3, Δura3::imm434/Δura3::imm434 kex2::hisG/kex2::hisG-URA3-hisG. Strains CNA1 and CNA3 were derived from CAI4, aura3/ura3 derivative of SC5314. Strains CNA3–1 and CNA3–2 are isogenic, originating from different transformations (8Newport G. Agabian N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28954-28961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Yeast forms were routinely maintained on YEPD plates (2% bactopeptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose, 2% agar [DIFCO]) at 30 °C. Hyphae were induced in serum or Lee's media following standard procedures. To embed cells in agar, strains were grown for 48 h in YEPD at 30 °C and washed twice with distilled water; ∼100 colony-forming units (CFU) were mixed with 20 ml of YPS-agar (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% sucrose, 1% agar), plated in 90-mm petri dishes (19Brown D.H., Jr. Giusani A.D. Chen X. Kumamoto C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and incubated at 25 °C. To enhance visualization of colony morphology, plates were stained with 0.1% Amido Black in acetic acid/methanol/water (10:25:65) and destained with acetic acid/methanol/water (10:20:70). Murine macrophage cell line P388D1 was maintained in Ham's nutrient mixture F12 supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), and 10% fetal calf serum. Macrophages were grown to confluence in 100 mm2 plastic tissue culture dishes (∼1.2 × 106 cells). C. albicans were grown for 3 days in YEPD, washed twice with distilled water, suspended in Ham's F12 without serum, counted, and combined with macrophages at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 5. Host neutrophil function is the most important determinant in the outcome of human systemic infections (20Lehrer R.I. Cline M.J. Cancer. 1971; 27: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and so the virulence of C. albicans was measured in DBA/2N mice, which are deficient in complement component 5 and impaired in their ability to recruit neutrophils to foci of fungal growth (21Ashman R.B. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1997; 19: 183-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DBA/2N mouse model therefore highlights damage due to direct effects of the fungus while minimizing the contribution from host inflammatory cells. DBA/2N mice are highly sensitive to fungal infection; the infective dose 50% (ID50) of C. albicans SC5314 in this strain is lower than that typically observed in other strains of mice (Table I and Ref. 21Ashman R.B. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1997; 19: 183-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table IID50 of DBA/2N mice inoculated with wild-type, KEX2/kex2, and kex2/kex2 strains of C. albicanStrainGenotype4 day7 day14 day21 daySC5314KEX2/KEX21.58 × 1042.61 × 1031.58 × 1031.58 × 103CNA1KEX2/kex21.04 × 1056.89 × 1045.55 × 1045.55 × 104CNA3–1kex2/kex24.51 × 1052.76 × 1062.76 × 1062.76 × 106CNA3–2kex2/kex21.39 × 1061.39 × 1051.39 × 1061.39 × 106 Open table in a new tab C. albicans was cultured at 35 °C for 24 h on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plates (22Abruzzo G.K. Flattery A.M. Gill C.J. Kong L. Smith J.G. Krupa D. Pikounis V.B. Kropp H. Bartizal K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Yeast were scraped from the surfaces of 1 or 2 plates, suspended in sterile physiological saline, and enumerated both with a hemocytometer and serial dilution and plating on SDA. The virulence of each strain was determined in female DBA/2N mice (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) inoculated i.v. into the lateral tail vein with 0.2 ml of a 10-fold titrated suspension of yeast at doses of 102–107 CFU per mouse (5 mice were injected at each dose). The ID50 values were estimated at 4, 7, 14, and 21 days after challenge by the method of Knudson and Curtis (23Knudson L.F. Curtis J.M. J. Am. Statist. Soc. 1947; 42: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Data are presented as the number of yeast in the initial inoculum that are lethal to half of the animals on the indicated date. Animals were treated in accordance with the highest standards for the humane handling, care, and treatment of research animals using protocols approved by the Merck Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Procedures for the care and use of research animals at Merck meet or exceed all applicable local, national, and international laws and regulations (22Abruzzo G.K. Flattery A.M. Gill C.J. Kong L. Smith J.G. Krupa D. Pikounis V.B. Kropp H. Bartizal K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Kidneys were removed from a separate group of DBA/2N mice 2 days after infection with 106 wild-type orkex2/kex2 (CNA3) organisms and placed into phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% formalin in order to investigate the histopathology of infection. A high dose of organisms was necessary to ensure that infected mice did not completely clear strain CNA3. The tissues were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned by standard methods. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and periodic acid-Schiff, then photographed using a Nikon FM2 mounted on a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescent microscope. Animals used for this part of the study were maintained under conditions suggested by a veterinarian and approved by the UCSF Committee on Animal Research. Assembly 6 of the C. albicansgenome was constructed by the Stanford Genome Technology Center (SGTC) and the translated ORFs (tORFs, >100 amino acids) are available (www.sequence.stanford.edu/group/candida/). Self-Blast of Assembly 6 ORFs, to detect alleles and gene families, was performed by S. Scherer and T. Jones at SGTC. PSORT II (24Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar), source code courtesy of Kenta Nakai, was used to assign PSG discriminant scores to the tORFs. The PSG score is calculated from both the hydrophobicity of the central part of a putative signal sequence and the net charge of its N terminus (psort.nibb.ac.jp/). Those tORFs with a PSG score of >4 were considered to be proteins with a leader sequence, but not necessarily with a signal peptidase cleavage site. Scripts to generate a list of Kex2p substrates based on PSG value and Kex2p-cleavage site motif, as well as to detect proteolytic cleavage patterns characteristic of pheromones, were written in Perl 5.2 and are available upon request. WU-Blast 2.0 (blast.wustl.edu/) was used to compare the list to GenPept release 127.0 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), and HMMer 2.2 (hmmer.wustl.edu/) was used to compare the list to Pfam release 7.0 (pfam.wustl.edu/). Both Blast/GenPept and HMMer/Pfam analyses were performed locally on a Linux 2.2.17 desktop workstation. The resulting output was parsed with simple in-house Perl scripts, uploaded into a local relational data base, and annotated manually. The inability of C. albicans kex2/kex2-null mutants either to process SAPs or to produce hyphae suggested that these strains might be severely impaired in pathogenesis and virulence. Therefore we measured the relative virulence of the KEX2/KEX2 strain SC5314, the heterozygous KEX2/kex2 strain CNA1, and the isogenic kex2/kex2 strains CNA3-1 and CNA3-2 in DBA/2N mice, which are defective in neutrophil responses to fungal infection (21Ashman R.B. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1997; 19: 183-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DBA/2N mouse strain is routinely used at Merck for measuring C. albicans virulence, the ID50 is the number of yeast cells in the inoculum required to achieve 50% lethality in test animals at 4, 7, 14, and 21 days post-infection. The results of such an experiment using the wild-type and kex2mutant strains are summarized in Table I. Inactivation of either one or both copies of KEX2 markedly attenuates C. albicans in a gene dosage-dependent manner. Inocula of ∼100 times more CFU of the kex2/kex2 deletion strains, as compared with the wild type, are required to achieve 50% lethality in mice 4 and 7 days post-infection. At 14–21 days post-infection, 1000 times more mutant cells are required to achieve lethality equivalent to the wild type. The heterozygous strain exhibits an intermediate level of pathogenicity, requiring 15 and 35 times more yeast in the inoculum than SC5314 did to achieve an ID50 4 and 21 days post-infection, respectively. The most common cause of death in experimental murine disseminated candidiasis is acute fungal pyelonephritis due to fungal proliferation and associated damage (21Ashman R.B. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1997; 19: 183-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the attenuation of kex2/kex2 mutants may result either because the mutant is more susceptible to clearance from the bloodstream before reaching the kidneys, or because it has difficulty crossing the endothelium, or because it is unable to invade the kidney matrix. To explore these possibilities we infected mice with either wild-type (SC5314) or kex2/kex2 (CNA3)C. albicans and inspected the kidneys 2 days post-infection. The histopathology of kidneys removed from mice infected with SC5314 differs markedly from kidneys isolated from mice infected with CNA3 (Fig. 1). Kidneys of SC5314-infected mice contain multiple foci of proliferating hyphae associated with a general disruption of the ECM and displacement of host cells (Fig. 1,A and C). Some of the CNA3 cells concentrate in foci located in interstitial spaces; these foci are much smaller than those of wild-type cells, often containing fewer than 10 organisms per nidus (as opposed to hundreds in wild-type infections), and are associated with little or no morphological damage to the surrounding matrix (Fig. 1 B). Overall, we observed far fewer organisms in the CNA3-colonized kidneys than those in SC5314 infections. CNA3 cells in the kidney fail to form hyphae (Fig. 1 D), although some protuberances are thicker and longer than those of CNA3 observed under any in vitro condition except when embedded in agar (see below). Unlike SC5314, which forms a broad zone of invasion throughout the kidney, many of the CNA3 cells remain within the glomeruli and associated blood vessels, indicating that the mutant is less able to invade the renal parenchyma than theKEX2/KEX2 strain. Host inflammatory cells are absent in areas surrounding CNA3 yeast, suggesting that the attenuation is not due to cell-mediated killing of the fungi. Low numbers ofkex2/kex2 cells in kidneys compared with wild type can be explained by slower growth or by enhanced clearance by phagocytic cells. kex2/kex2 yeast grow only slightly more slowly in various media than the parental strain, and reach a similar density by stationary phase (data not shown). We assessed whether the null mutant CNA3 is more susceptible to clearance by phagocytic cells in vitro. Wild-type C. albicans strain SC5314 is readily phagocytized by macrophage cell line 388D1, as reported for macrophage cell line IC-21 (25Lo H.J. Kohler J.R. DiDomenico B. Loebenberg D. Cacciapuoti A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1997; 90: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar) and adherent mouse peritoneal macrophages (26Borg-von Zepelin M. Beggah S. Boggian K. Sanglard D. Monod M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Ingested yeast form hyphae within 30 min, and by 4 h the hyphae traverse the length of the macrophage, often extending along the lengths of macrophage processes (Fig. 2 A). The macrophages lyse within 4–6 h, releasing C. albicans hyphae, which bud new yeast that are subsequently phagocytized by other macrophages. We did not observe any phagocytosis of hyphae. Within 24 h of exposure to SC5314, the fungi almost completely destroy the macrophage lawn, as evidenced by clearing of the normally opaque macrophage monolayer after removal of medium (data not shown). CNA3 is also phagocytized, but forms aberrant cells with short stumpy projections within the macrophages that are similar to CNA3 cells incubated in hyphal-inducing liquid media (Fig. 2 B); no hyphae are produced in infected macrophages. After 24 h, small patches of clearing are seen in the CNA3-inoculated monolayers; however, the lawn of macrophages remains essentially intact (Fig. 2 C). The inability ofkex2/kex2 mutants to invade the kidney and kill macrophages can be partially explained by our previous finding that mutants are defective in both proteinase secretion and hyphal formation (8Newport G. Agabian N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28954-28961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In that study we established that kex2/kex2mutants are unable to form hyphae in liquid or on solid media (8Newport G. Agabian N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28954-28961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, subsequent reports have appeared indicating that some putatively hyphae-deficient mutants are in fact able to form hyphae when embedded in solid media (19Brown D.H., Jr. Giusani A.D. Chen X. Kumamoto C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 25Lo H.J. Kohler J.R. DiDomenico B. Loebenberg D. Cacciapuoti A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1997; 90: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar) and in vivo (27Riggle P.J. Andrutis K.A. Chen X. Tzipori S.R. Kumamoto C.A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3649-3652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether CNA3 was able to form hyphae when embedded in agar. Within 48 h, SC5314 colonies embedded in solid medium produce filaments consisting largely of hyphae, while CNA3 colonies develop only slightly corrugated surfaces. After 6 days of incubation, SC5314 grows as stellate colonies with hyphal projections extending more than twice the diameter of the main body of the colony, while CNA3 grows as colonies with irregular peripheries that barely extend beyond the colony mass (Fig. 3, A andB). Microscopically, the periphery of each CNA3 colony consists of yeast, pseudohyphae, and aberrant forms similar to those produced by CNA3 when grown in hyphal-inducing liquid media. The colonies also contain more elongated aberrantly shaped cells not found in liquid media but similar to those forms observed in kidney (Fig. 3,C and D). Approximately 1% of the embedded CNA3 colonies throw out sectors that are clearly more filamentous than other areas. Cells within the filamentous sectors are predominantly pseudohyphae, with no true hyphae (Fig. 3 E). These sectors may be products of phenotypic switching which, in this strain, occurs at a frequency of 1% and manifests as differences in the abundance of pseudohyphae (28Perez-Martin J. Uria J.A. Johnson A.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2580-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the sectors may be products of partial suppression of the kex2− phenotype. It is unlikely that the absence of Kex2p per se is responsible for the range of phenotypic defects described above. A more likely explanation is that Kex2p is required for normal processing and activation of a number of extracellular proteins that individually or collectively are involved in defining hyphal morphogenesis, pathogenesis, and virulence. By “extracellular” we refer to proteins that act wholly or partially outside of the plasma membrane, including but not limited to cell surface, cell wall, and secreted proteins. The complete sequencing of the C. albicans genome, coupled with the highly stereotyped cleavage recognition motif of ScKex2p in S. cerevisiae, suggested that we might be able to computationally identify substrates of Kex2p in C. albicans. To survey the entire C. albicans genome for potential Kex2p substrates, we wrote a computer script which extracts all of the ORFs from Assembly 6 that encode a protein which: 1) is >100 amino acids in length, 2) possesses a leader peptide, but not necessarily a signal peptidase cleavage site, as determined by a modified McGeoh's method (24Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar), and 3) contains a propeptide < 150 amino acids long, as defined by the motif P4-P3-Lys-Arg, where P3 can be any amino acid but P4 cannot be CDFGPS or W. This last criterion is a weak consensus derived from inspection of known cleavage substrates of S. cerevisiae ScKex2p (29Bostian K.A. Elliott Q. Bussey H. Burn V. Smith A. Tipper D.J. Cell. 1984; 36: 741-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 30Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Ohshima T. Tanaka S. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

It is possible that C. albicans Kex2p recognizes a cleavage site motif somewhat different from that of ScKex2p; however, C. albicans KEX2 was isolated by complementation of a S. cerevisiae Sckex2-null mutant, resulting in the processing of at least two known ScKex2p substrates (8Newport G. Agabian N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28954-28961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Based on these criteria, the script extracted 147 candidate Kex2p cleavage substrates from the 9168 predicted proteins of Assembly 6 of the C. albicans genomic sequence (www-sequence.stanford.edu/group/ candida/). Each of the 147 candidate substrates was analyzed by Blast against Assembly 6, followed by manual inspection of each alignment. This assessment revealed that 60 candidate ORFs are alleles or fragments of one another. This reflects the diploid nature of C. albicansas well as the fragmented nature of Assembly 6, which consists of as many as 2519 unlinked contigs. Two gene families, with at least three members each, were identified at this step. One family encodes 9 SAPs, one of which has not been described in the literature (ORF6.1902), and the other encodes 3 inositol monophosphatases involved in methionine biosynthesis and halotolerance. Correction for multiple alleles and allelic fragments left 130 haploid ORFs potentially encoding Kex2p substrates. Of these, 14 are cited genes whose protein products either are cleaved by Kex2p or contain leader sequences with a putative Kex2p cleavage site:SAP1–6, SAP8–9, XOG1, MP65,HWP1, PHR1-2, and KEX2. Each of the proteins encoded by these ORFs is homologous to a S. cerevisiae protein. Notably, two previously described SAPs were not recovered by our script: Sap7p, which does not have a KR site, and Sap10p, which does not have a leader sequence. The 130 haploid ORFs were ascribed functions by a procedure involving Blast of the candidate list against Genpept and HMMer of the list against Pfam, followed by manual examination of the output (see “Experimental Procedures”). 70 of the haploid ORFs have likelyS. cerevisiae homologues, and 60 do not. Of the 70 withS. cerevisiae homologues, 58 (including the 14 cloned genes named above) have homologues with an ascribed name or function given by the Saccharomyces Genome Database (genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/), including well characterized extracellular S. cerevisiae proteins such as ScCrh1p (Orf6.1231 of Assembly 6), ScSun4p (Orf6.2071), and ScExg2p (Orf6.6664). The remaining 12 candidates are homologous to proteins of unknown function in S. cerevisiae. The process and results of classifying the ORFs is summarized in Fig. 4, and some of the proteins identified by our script are presented in Table II.

We have demonstrated previously that the cotransported proton binds to the carrier in the absence of glutamate and, thus, modulates the EAAC1 affinity for glutamate. Here, we used site-directed mutagenesis together with a rapid kinetic technique that allows one to generate sub-millisecond glutamate concentration jumps to locate possible binding sites of the glutamate transporter for the cotransported proton. One candidate for this binding site, the highly conserved glutamic acid residue Glu-373 of EAAC1, was mutated to glutamine. Our results demonstrate that the mutant transporter does not catalyze net transport of glutamate, whereas Na+/glutamate homoexchange is unimpaired. Furthermore, the voltage dependence of the rates of Na+binding and glutamate translocation are unchanged compared with the wild-type. In contrast to the wild-type, however, homoexchange of the E373Q transporter is completely pH-independent. In line with these findings the transport kinetics of the mutant EAAC1 show no deuterium isotope effect. Thus, we suggest a new transport mechanism, in which Glu-373 forms part of the binding site of EAAC1 for the cotransported proton. In this model, protonation of Glu-373 is required for Na+/glutamate translocation, whereas the relocation of the carrier is only possible when Glu-373 is negatively charged. Interestingly, the Glu-373-homologous amino acid residue is glutamine in the related neutral amino acid transporter alanine-serine-cysteine transporter. The function of alanine-serine-cysteine transporter is neither potassium- nor proton-dependent.

Sharon I. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3949-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 2Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 3Levy L.M. Warr O. Attwell D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9620-9628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, one proton is cotransported with glutamate into the cell (4Billups B. Attwell D. Nature. 1996; 379: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 5Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Because of this stoichiometry, glutamate transport is electrogenic with a total of two positive charges being translocated to the intracellular side during each completed transport cycle. Whereas glutamate, sodium ions, and the proton are cotransported together in one branch of the reaction cycle (6Watzke N. Rauen T. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the potassium ion is countertransported in the glutamate-independent relocation step of the carrier (7Kanner B.I. Bendahan A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6327-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 8Watzke N. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen.

A. 2001; 98: 15324-15329Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have demonstrated previously that protonation of EAAC1 creates a high affinity binding site for the amino acid substrate on the transporter. In addition, protonation is required for substrate translocation across the membrane, whereas the relocation of the glutamate-free transporter form requires dissociation of the proton from EAAC1 (6Watzke N. Rauen T. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, no information was obtained about the molecular nature of the proton binding site on EAAC1 in this previous study. On the basis of the apparent pK a of the ionizable residue(s) of 6.5–8, and according to a previous interpretation (13Zhang Y. Pines G. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19573-19577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that the protonation might involve a histidine residue. However, not only histidine residues, but also acidic amino acid residues within the transmembrane domain, appear to be important for proton translocation in other proton transporters and pumps (14Assadi-Porter F.M. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16186-16193Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Butt H.J. Fendler K. Bamberg E. Tittor J. Oesterhelt D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).In high affinity glutamate transporters at least three acidic amino acid residues are located in putative membrane-spanning regions. These amino acid residues, which are highly conserved in the EAAT family (Asp-398, Glu-404, and Asp-470 in GLT1, which correspond to Glu-367, Glu-373, and Asp-443 in EAAC1, Fig. 1), are critical for the functioning of the transporter as demonstrated by Pines et al. (18Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Neutralizing the putative negative charge of these amino acid residues of EAATs by site-directed mutagenesis severely impaired glutamate uptake by the mutant transporters (18Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The mutant transporters D398N and D470N are non-functional, whereas Glu-404 mutants showed residual activity that was finally attributed to an electroneutral substrate homoexchange reaction suggesting that the potassium-induced relocation of the transporter is impaired (19Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Consequently, the acidic amino acid residue in position 404 appears to be important for the relocation step but not for the initial glutamate translocation reaction of GLT1. Therefore, Glu-404 in GLT1 and homologous amino acid residues in other EAATs could be possible candidates for the proton binding site in glutamate transporters.In this study, the charge translocation reaction by the mutant E373Q glutamate transporter EAAC1 (corresponding to E404N in GLT1) was investigated in detail and correlated with the proton transport by EAAC1. Furthermore, it was determined whether Glu-373 contributes to the charge neutralization provided by the empty EAAC1 cation binding sites, and whether its charge moves across the electric field during the charge translocating conformational change of the transporter. Based on the facts that glutamate binding to EAAC1E373Q is completely pH-independent and homoexchange is unimpaired, we propose that Glu-373 is part of the proton-translocating machinery of EAAC1.RESULTSThe mutant glutamate transporter EAAC1E373Q expressed in HEK293 cells was functionally analyzed by whole-cell current recording experiments. Typical current measurements of wild-type EAAC1 (EAACWT) and EAAC1E373Q after application of saturating concentrations of glutamate by using a rapid solution exchange method are shown in Fig. 2. No steady-state transport currentsI Na+Glu−/K+were observed for EAAC1E373Q (Fig. 2 A,n = 10 with 4 cells), whereas under the same conditions EAACWT exhibited inward currents with an average amplitude of −35 pA (Fig. 2 B, n = 20, 6 cells), in line with previous observations (2Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with results obtained for the homologous mutation of GLT1 (E404N) under steady-state conditions (18Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although glutamate-induced steady-state currents are abolished by the mutation, a rapid inwardly directed transient EAAC1E373Q current is observed at the time of the glutamate application (Fig. 2 A) that is absent in non-transfected control cells (Fig. 2 C). This result indicates that EAAC1E373Q is functionally expressed and mediates glutamate-induced charge movements. Expression of EAAC1E373Q was confirmed by immunocytochemistry as shown in Fig. 2 D, demonstrating the membranous localization of the mutant transporter. The time dependence of the rapid charge movements is too fast to be resolved by the rapid solution exchange method with a maximum time resolution of about 50 ms. Therefore, we used laser-pulse photolysis of caged glutamate, allowing us to generate glutamate concentration jumps within less than 100 μs (21Grewer C. Watzke N. Wiessner M. Rauen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9706-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) to study the function of EAAC1E373Q in more detail.Figure 2Steady-state currents and EAAC1 expression.Typical whole-cell current recordings of an EAAC1-E373Q (A) and WT transfected HEK cell (B) after application of 500 μm glutamate (rapid solution exchange during the time indicated by the bar, time resolution ∼20–30 ms) determined by using a KCl-based pipette solution and a NaCl-based bath solutionI Na+Glu−/K+, inward transport mode.

The scale bar represents 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Pre-steady-state KineticsEAACWT exhibits inwardly directed pre-steady-state currents upon applying a rapid concentration jump of extracellular glutamateI Na+Glu−, Fig. 3 A). These currents are caused by movement of the cotransported Na+ ion(s) into the binding site and, most likely, the electrogenic glutamate translocation reaction (8Watzke N. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 547-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 30Grewer C. Madani Mobarekeh S.A. Watzke N. Rauen T. Schaper K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Similar rapid inwardly directed charge movements are observed for EAAC1E373Q (Fig. 3 B) when glutamate is photolytically released from 1 mm αCNB-caged glutamate. The current rises very rapidly with an average time constant of τrise = 0.3 ± 0.1 ms (n = 8; WT, 0.5 ± 0.1 ms). The decay consists of two components. The time constant for the rapidly decaying component is τfast = 1.2 ± 0.3 ms (n = 4; WT, 0.9 ± 0.1 ms). Thus, the kinetics of the current rising phase and the rapid component of the decaying phase are unchanged compared with the EAACWT (p > 0.15).Figure 3Pre-steady-state currents. Time-resolved measurement of pre-steady-state transport currentsI Na+Glu− in the absence of permeant anions (NaCl-based pipette solution containing 10 mm glutamate, homoexchange conditions, NaCl-based bath solution) for WT (right panel) and E373Q (left panel) EAAC1. Glutamate (150 ± 20 μm) was released from 1 mm caged glutamate by laser photolysis att = 0. The transmembrane potential was 0 mV. Thesolid lines represent best fits with a sum of three exponential functions to the data (see “Experimental Procedures”). The time constants obtained from the fit for the specific experiments shown here were: τfast = 0.9 ± 0.1 ms, τslow = 11 ± 0.2 ms (WT), and τfast = 0.9 ± 0.1 ms, τslow = 25 ± 1 ms (E373Q), respectively. The average values for the time constants are shown in the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The second component of the current decay, τslow, was slower than that observed in EAACWT. This decay process was previously assigned to the electrogenic glutamate translocation reaction across the membrane. Therefore, the existence of the slow current component indicates that glutamate translocation is still functional in the mutated transporter but slowed compared with EAAC1WT. Because EAACE373Q-mediated currents were generally smaller than those observed for the wild-type, the slowly decaying component could not be quantitatively evaluated for theI Na+Glu−signal.Glutamate-induced Anion CurrentsTo obtain quantitative information about τslow, we performed experiments in the anion-conducting mode of EAAC1. It was previously shown for EAAC1WT that (i) the current mediated by glutamate-induced SCN− outward movementI anionicGlu− is at least five times larger than the electrogenic transport current,I Na+Glu−/K+(31Watzke N. Grewer C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and (ii) the time constants determined for both current components are linked to each other (8Watzke N. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 547-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Pre-steady-state current recordings in the presence of intracellular SCN− I anionicGlu− evoked by photolysis of 1 mm caged glutamate are shown in Fig. 4 A. In the forward transport mode (high [K+] internal), the EAACE373Qcurrent shows predominantly a transient component. The average peak current is I ps = −100 pA, whereas the stationary current component, I ss, is only −10 pA (I ss/I ps = 0.04 ± 0.01, n = 3). In contrast, theI ss/I ps ratio for EAAC1WT is significantly larger (0.46, p = 0.004, Fig. 4 B) (8Watzke N. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 547-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 30Grewer C. Madani Mobarekeh S.A. Watzke N. Rauen T. Schaper K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The decay of the transient current could be represented with a monoexponential decaying function, within experimental error. The average time constant for this decay of EAACE373Q (τslow = 20 ± 2 ms,n = 6) was significantly slower than the decay of the EAAC1WT (τslow = 7.4 ± 1 ms,n = 6, p < 0.0001). TheI ss/I ps ratio recorded in the anion-conducting mode is a measure for the turnover rate of the transporter (I ss/I ps =k b·τslow andk t = k b (1 −k b·τslow)) (8Watzke N. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 547-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 30Grewer C. Madani Mobarekeh S.A. Watzke N. Rauen T. Schaper K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here,k b is the rate constant for relocation of the glutamate-free transporter. From theI ss/I ps ratio, together with the time constant τslow, a maximum steady-state turnover rate constant (k t) for EAACE373Q of about 1.9 s−1 was calculated. This low value, which is almost 20-fold lower than the one determined for EAACWT (35 s−1), explains why no steady-state transport currents can be recorded for EAACE373Q.Figure 4Whole-cell current recordingsI anionicGlu− from WT and E373Q-expressing voltage-clamped HEK293 cells. Glutamate was photolytically released from 1 mm αCNB-caged glutamate with a 340-nm laser flash (400 mJ/cm2) at t= 0. The concentration of photolytically released glutamate was estimated as 150 ± 20 μm. The solid lines represent the best fits to the data according to a sum of two exponential functions. The transmembrane potential was 0 mV at pH 7.3. A and B, forward transport mode; the intracellular solution contained 140 mm KSCN. The time constants for the rise and the decay of the current obtained from the fit (gray line) were: τfast = 1.7 ± 0.1 ms, τslow = 8.1 ± 0.1 ms (WT), and τfast = 1.8 ± 0.1 ms, τslow = 35 ± 5 ms (E373Q), respectively. C and D, homoexchange mode; the intracellular solution contained 140 mm NaSCN and 10 mm glutamate. The time constants for the current decay obtained from the fit were: τfast = 0.8 ± 0.1 ms, τslow = 10 ± 0.2 ms (WT), and τfast = 0.7 ± 0.2 ms, τslow = 37 ± 10 ms (E373Q), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Voltage Dependence of EAACE373Q KineticsThe voltage dependence of the steady-state and pre-steady-state properties of EAACWT and EAACE373Q are shown in Fig. 5. The rate constant for the current rise of EAACE373Q, 1/τfast, increases slightly with increasing transmembrane potential (Fig. 5 A). The slope of the log(1/τfast) versus V m relationship of (0.5 ± 0.3) V−1 is within the experimental error identical to that found for EAACWT (1.2 ± 0.3) V−1. In contrast, the voltage dependence of the rate constant for the decaying phase of the current is reversed and about 4-fold stronger, as shown in Fig. 5 A. A similar behavior is well documented for the EAACWT (8Watzke N. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 547-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The slope of the log(1/τslow)versus V m relationship is (3.9 ± 0.4) V−1, which agrees well with that of EAACWT (−4.0 ± 0.3 V−1, Fig. 5 A).Figure 5Voltage dependence of EAAC1 glutamate transport kinetics for WT (open symbols) and E373Q (solid symbols). A, the relaxation rates 1/τfast (triangles) and 1/τslow (circles) are plotted as a function ofV m. The solid lines represent the results of a linear regression analysis of the log(1/τ)versus V m relationship with slopes of (1.2 ± 0.3)·10−3/mV (WT, τfast) and −(3.9 ± 0.4)·10−3/mV (WT, τslow). For the mutant the following values were obtained for the slope from the linear regression analysis: (0.5 ± 0.3)·10−3/mV (E373Q, τfast) and −(4.0 ± 0.4)·10−3/mV (E373Q, τslow). B, voltage dependence of the glutamate-induced (500 μm) steady-state current of WT (open circles) and E373Q (solid circles) EAAC1 at pH 7.3. The pipette solution contained 140 mm NaSCN and 10 mm glutamate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The voltage dependence of steady-state currents is shown in Fig. 5 B. Because EAACE373Q does not catalyze steady-state transport, these experiments could not be performed forI Na+Glu−/K+, but were carried out in the presence of intracellular SCN− I anionicGlu−under homoexchange conditions. For EAACE373Q, the currents start to saturate at potentials below approximately −60 mV (Fig. 5 B). As demonstrated in Fig. 5 A, wild-type EAAC1 shows the same saturation of currents atV m < −60 mV under homoexchange conditions. Such a saturating behavior has not been found for previous EAACWT experiments using the forward transport mode (8Watzke N. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 547-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).EAACE373Q Currents Are pH-independentThe experiments described above demonstrate that the E373Q mutation in EAAC only affects the rate of glutamate translocation but not its voltage dependence, suggesting that translocation can also occur in the absence of an acidic amino acid side chain at position 373. To test this hypothesis, we determined the pH dependence of EAACE373Qtransport kinetics. Fig. 6 Ashows the dose-response relationship of EAACE373Q currents at different extracellular pH values between 7.3 and 10.0. In this pH range EAACWT exhibits a 100-fold change in its apparent glutamate affinity (Fig. 6 B) (6Watzke N. Rauen T. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast, the apparent affinity of EAACE373Q for glutamate is pH-independent. This effect is not caused by an altered intrinsic glutamate affinity of EAACE373Q, because at pH 7.3 the K m of 10 ± 5 μm is not significantly different from that determined for EAACWT (K m = 13 ± 2 μm, p = 0.58). The 100-fold change inK m has been determined under conditions of EAACWT forward transport, whereas the K mvalue for EAACE373Q was determined under homoexchange conditions. Therefore, we tested if under homoexchange conditions theK m of EAACWT for glutamate becomes pH-independent. At pH 10.0 the K m value of EAACWT increases to 700 ± 250 μm, about 55 times the K m measured at pH 7.3, indicating that glutamate transport by wild-type EAAC1 is also pH-dependent under homoexchange conditions.Figure 6pH dependence of EAAC1 glutamate transport kinetics for WT and E373Q EAAC1. A, dose-response relationships of glutamate-induced currents for the E373Q mutant (left) and ASCT2 (right) at values for the extracellular pH of 7.3 (open circles), 8.3 (triangles), and 10.0 (closed circles) atV m = 0 mV. The intracellular solution contained 140 mm NaSCN and 10 mm glutamate (l-alanine for ASCT2, homoexchange conditions). Thesolid line represents a fit of Michaelis-Menten kinetics to the data with a K m of 10 μm.B, pH dependence of the K m values for glutamate (EAAC1E373Q, circles) and for alanine (ASCT2, solid triangles; ASCT2Q392E, open triangles). The K m values were obtained under homoexchange conditions (140 mm NaSCN, 10 mmglutamate or alanine in the pipette). The dotted line was calculated according to the model shown in Fig. 8 withK S = 5.5 μm and a pK a of the proton acceptor of EAAC1 of 8.1 (see equation under “Experimental Procedures”). C, relative maximum current (I max) at pH 10.0 normalized toI max obtained at pH 7.3 for EAAC1WT(black bars), EAAC1E373Q (hatched bars), and ASCT2 (gray bars). The conditions of the experiments were as described in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In addition to the pH effect on the K m value, we determined the maximum glutamate-induced current (I max) at saturating glutamate concentrations (1 mm) as a function of extracellular pH. As shown in Fig. 6 C, the I max of EAACE373Qdecreases by 8% at pH 10.0, compared with pH 7.3. A similar slight decrease (25%) is observed for EAACWT and was previously attributed to a pH effect on the anion conductance of EAAC1 but not on the transport rate of glutamate, because the maximum transport currents were unaffected by the external pH (6Watzke N. Rauen T. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).As a further control, the pH effect on the neutral amino acid transporter ASCT2 was investigated. In analogy to EAACE373Qstudied here, the rat ASCT2 contains a glutamine residue in position 392, which is homologous to the glutamate in position 373 of EAAC1 (22Broer A. Brookes N. Ganapathy V. Dimmer K.S. Wagner C.A. Lang F. Broer S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2184-2194PubMed Google Scholar). Application of the neutral amino acid l-alanine to ASCT2-expressing HEK293 cells elicited concentration-dependent uncoupled anion currents with an average amplitude of −250 pA (0 mV,n = 8) in the presence of intracellular thiocyanate, sodium ions, and neutral amino acid substrate (I anionicGlu−, in homoexchange mode, original data not shown). These results are in agreement with previously published data on ASC transporters (23Broer A. Wagner C. Lang F. Broer S. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27991-27994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The currents saturated with an apparent K m of 420 ± 40 μm (Fig. 6 A), which is somewhat higher than the value of 18 μm reported for mouse ASCT2, which has been expressed in Xenopus oocytes (33Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). This difference in the observed K m may be caused by the different expression systems. After increasing the extracellular pH to 10.0, however, the K m for l-alanine was virtually unchanged (K m = 410 ± 60 μm, Fig. 6, A and B). Similar results were found for I max measured at a saturating concentration of 5 mml-alanine (Fig. 6 C). As found for EAAC1 (WT and E373Q),I max is only weakly dependent on the external proton concentration. This result is in line with the known pH independence of ASCT between pH 7.3 and 10 of the maximum rate of neutral amino acid transport (23Broer A. Wagner C. Lang F. Broer S. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 33Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar).Generation of a pH-sensitive ASC TransporterTo test if the glutamine residue in position 392 of ASCT2 is responsible for the pH independence of alanine transport, we generated the reverse mutation of EAAC1E373Q in this transporter by replacing Gln-392 with a glutamate residue. The pH dependence of the K m for alanine of ASCT2Q392E is shown in Fig. 6 C(open triangles). In contrast to ASCT2WT, theK m of the mutant transporter strongly increases at pH values > 8. The K m change is 18-fold from pH 7.3 to 10. This K m increase is reminiscent of that found for EAACWT, although the apparent pK a value is shifted to a slightly more basic value of 9.0 compared with 8.0 found for EAAC.Absence of Deuterium Isotope Effect on EAACE373QKineticsTo further demonstrate the proton independence of EAACE373Q function, we performed pre-steady-state kinetic experiments in the presence D2O (Fig. 7). Clearly, D2O substitution has no effect on the amplitude of the glutamate-induced current of EAACE373Q (Fig. 7, A and C), as well as on the time constant for the rise of the current (1/τfast, Fig. 7, A and B), consistent with data previously obtained for the EAACWT(6Watzke N. Rauen T. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, a 2-fold decrease of the rate constant for the current decay (1/τslow) was observed after the substitution of H2O by D2O for EAACWT, but this effect was absent for EAACE373Q, as demonstrated in Fig. 7(A and B). For EAACE373Q an average value for τslow of 35 ± 2 ms in D2O and 31 ± 7 ms in H2O-based buffer solution was observed (n = 10, 3 cells, p = 0.49). These data demonstrate the absence of a significant kinetic isotope effect on EAACE373Q.Figure 7Absence of a deuterium isotope effect on the steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics of E373Q EAAC1.

AtsB, an iron-sulfur protein, is strictly required for modification of Ser72 in the periplasmic sulfatase AtsA ofKlebsiella pneumoniae. Here we show (i) that AtsB is a cytosolic protein acting on newly synthesized serine-type sulfatases, (ii) that AtsB-mediated FGly formation is dependent on AtsA's signal peptide, and (iii) that the cytosolic cysteine-type sulfatase ofPseudomonas aeruginosa can be converted into a substrate of AtsB if the cysteine is substituted by serine and a signal peptide is added. Thus, formylglycine formation in serine-type sulfatases depends both on AtsB and on the presence of a signal peptide, and AtsB can act on sulfatases of other species. AtsB physically interacts with AtsA in a Ser72-dependent manner, as shown in yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down experiments. This strongly suggests that AtsB is the serine-modifying enzyme and that AtsB relies on a cytosolic function of the sulfatase's signal peptide.

The three-dimensional fold and, in particular, active site region of human and bacterial sulfatases are strikingly similar (4Bond C.S. Clements P.R. Ashby S.J. Collyer C.A. Harrop S.J. Hopwood J.J.

The catalytic residue is a Cα-formylglycine (FGly).1 Its formyl group is hydrated, leading to two geminal hydroxyls at the α-carbon that both are required for catalysis (6Boltes I. Czapinski H.

During sulfate ester cleavage, one of the hydroxyls undergoes covalent sulfation with consecutive desulfation induced by the second hydroxyl (6Boltes I. Czapinski H. Kahnert A. von Bülow R.

Biol. 2001; 305: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The importance of this novel catalytic mechanism is reflected by the fact that failure to generate the FGly residue leads to synthesis of catalytically inactive sulfatase polypeptides, as is observed in multiple sulfatase deficiency, a rare but fatal human lysosomal storage disorder (9Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 10Hopwood J.J. Ballabio A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Valle D. Sly W.S.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 974-976Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, FGly is generated in the endoplasmic reticulum by oxidation of a conserved cysteine residue (12Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 13Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schmidt B. von Figura K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This late cotranslational or early posttranslational protein modification is directed by a short linear sequence motif comprising a proline and an arginine as the key residues in +2- and +4-positions (CXPXR) and, in addition, an adjacent auxiliary element (LTG; +8 to +10) (2Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schlotterhose P. Schmidt B. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Replacing the key cysteine by serine or any other amino acid abolishes FGly formation completely (2Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schlotterhose P. Schmidt B. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 7Recksiek M. Selmer T. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13941-13946Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The motif has to be accessible to the modifying machinery prior to folding of the nascent polypeptide into its native structure (2Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schlotterhose P. Schmidt B. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To date, none of the components or cofactors of this machinery have been identified in eukaryotes. These components are comprised among the luminal contents of the endoplasmic reticulum, which in vitro mediate FGly modification independent of protein translocation and independent of a signal peptide in the sulfatase substrate (15Fey J. Balleininger M. Borissenko L.V. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47021-47028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Due to the clear conservation of the FGly modification motif, most of the sulfatases encoded in various eubacterial genomes are predicted also to undergo FGly modification by oxidation of a cysteine. This was shown experimentally for the arylsulfatase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAS), a member of the cysteine-type sulfatases. Even after strong overexpression in Escherichia coli, this cytosolic sulfatase was quantitatively converted to the active FGly-bearing enzyme (16Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Hence, the E. coli cytosol contains the modifying machinery. This machinery is expressed even under excessive supply with inorganic sulfate. Thus, expression ofE. coli's cysteine-modifying system is independent of the sulfur status of the cells, in contrast to expression of the sulfatase structural genes, as studied in P. aeruginosa and inKlebsiella pneumoniae (17Beil S. Kehrli H. James P. Staudenmann W. Cook A.M. Leisinger T. Kertesz M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1982: 133-154Google Scholar). The other well characterized bacterial sulfatase, the arylsulfatase AtsA of K. pneumoniae, is a serine-type sulfatase that carries an FGly residue generated by oxidation of a serine rather than a cysteine (20Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Generation of FGly (i.e. serine semialdehyde) from serine most likely is a one-step oxidation process. In contrast to the cytosolic cysteine-type sulfatases, serine-type sulfatases are located in the periplasm (18Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Szameit C. Miech C. Balleininger M. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 5: R181-R186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The key FGly motif (SXPXR) and also the auxiliary downstream element (LTG) are also conserved in serine-type sulfatases (2Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schlotterhose P. Schmidt B. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Despite these similarities, bacteria have two different pathways for FGly generation from cysteine and serine, respectively. This is indicated by two observations. First, substitution of the cysteine to be modified in PAS by serine totally blocks FGly formation (16Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Second, expression of active, FGly-containing AtsA in E. coli essentially requires coexpression of the K. pneumoniae atsB gene (21Szameit C. Miech C. Balleininger M. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15375-15381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas the genomic background of E. coli is sufficient for expression of active and modified PAS (16Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The atsB gene is located on the same operon as the structural atsA gene. AtsB acts in trans on AtsA, since it was fully functional when both genes were co-expressed from two different plasmids (21Szameit C. Miech C. Balleininger M. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15375-15381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of two serine-type sulfatase operons in E. coli, each consisting of a sulfatase gene and an atsB homolog, this species has not been found to express endogenous sulfatases. The inability of the chromosomalatsB homologs of E. coli to substitute for theKlebsiella atsB most likely is explained by repression of its sulfatase operons. AtsB is predicted to be a 44-kDa iron-sulfur protein with three cysteine clusters that are conserved in all AtsB homologs (22Schirmer A. Kolter R. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R181-R186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Iron-sulfur proteins are involved in redox reactions, but only recently a direct enzymatic oxidoreductase function has been assigned to this class of proteins (23Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 24Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Schmidt P.P. Eliasson R. Gaillard J. Deronzier C.

Where in the cell does AtsB fulfill its function? Can it act on both cytosolic and secretory sulfatases? Does AtsB act specifically on the Klebsiella sulfatase or on serine-type sulfatases in general? And finally, does AtsB physically interact with the modification motif on the sulfatase polypeptide? atsA-S72C was generated by PCR mutagenesis of atsA (21Szameit C. Miech C. Balleininger M. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15375-15381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using a coding mutagenic primer (CGAGCAGGGAATGCGCATGAGCCAGTATTACACCTCGCCGATGTGCGCCCCGGC) that allowed subcloning of the PCR product via its BsmI site. The generation of pas-C51S was described earlier (16Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The 5′-UTR of the pas gene in pME4055 (16Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was substituted by the short 5′-UTR of atsA (21Szameit C. Miech C. Balleininger M. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15375-15381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) by adding an oligonucleotide (CCCAAGCTTGAACAGGAGAGTCAGTCGTG), with aHindIII site and an initiator GTG, 5′ of pas. The modified gene was cloned into pBluescriptII SK as a HindIII fragment downstream of the lac promotor. The addition of an oligonucleotide coding for a C-terminal Arg-Gly-Ser-His6 tag to atsA was described earlier (21Szameit C. Miech C. Balleininger M. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15375-15381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The same tag was fused to AtsB by adding the oligonucleotide GGGGGATATCATGCGCTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCGATCCTCT 5′ of theatsB stop codon and subcloning of the obtained PCR product as a BsmI/EcoRV fragment back into theatsB template vector. Deletion of AtsA's signal peptide was achieved by adding an oligonucleotide (CCCAAGCTTGAACAGGAGAGTCAGTCGTG) with a HindIII site and the indicated initiator GTG, 5′ of codon 21 ofatsA, which encodes the first amino acid of mature AtsA. The PCR product was subcloned as a HindIII/XhoI fragment back into the atsBA template vector. For construction of PAS-C51S+SP, the AtsA signal peptide was added to its N terminus. Using overlapping extension PCR (26Horton R.M. Hunt H.D., Ho, S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar), we amplified the 5′-UTR and signal peptide codons of atsA (internal noncoding primer: GGGCGTTTGCTCGCGGCGTGCGCGCCACC) and, in a second PCR, the coding region of pas excluding the initiator ATG (internal coding primer: CACGCCGCGAGCAAACGCCCCAACTTCCTG). The two PCR products were fused by using them as templates in a third PCR reaction, due to hybridization of the overlapping complementary sequences introduced by the two internal primers. From the final PCR product, a 144-bp EcoRV fragment was subcloned into pBluescriptII SK-PAS-C51S, thereby replacing the corresponding part in the 5′ region of pas. E. coli DH5α was transformed with the following plasmids: pBluescriptII containing eitheratsA, atsB, atsBA (atsA andatsB with or without His tag codons, atsA with or without signal peptide codons), pas, or pas-C51S (with or without signal peptide codons). Coexpression of AtsB with PAS constructs was achieved in double transformants containing also the pBBR1MCS-atsB plasmid (atsB subcloned fromatsBA as a KpnI/HindIII fragment). The presence of the two plasmids was maintained in selective medium, containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol, and was routinely checked by PCR analysis. Growth conditions, preparation of periplasm, and purification of hexahistidine-tagged proteins were described earlier (21Szameit C. Miech C. Balleininger M. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15375-15381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Using purified native PAS protein, provided by Dr. M. Kertesz (School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, UK) as antigen and specol as adjuvant, polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits injected with 400 μg (first injection) or 200 μg (two booster injections) of antigen. Anti-AtsB antibodies were generated similarly, using AtsB-His6protein as antigen. This was purified from inclusion bodies on Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) in the presence of 8m urea according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Prior to rabbit injection, urea was removed by stepwise dialysis (4m/2 m/1 m urea in PBS). The purity of AtsB was at least 95% (Fig. 1 B). Antibodies were purified by preadsorption of antisera to immobilized E. coliprotein. Anti-AtsB antibodies furthermore were affinity-purified by adsorption to SDS-PAGE-purified antigen that was blotted to and excised from a nitrocellulose membrane. Bound antibodies were eluted with 200 mm glycine (pH 2.8). Expressed AtsB, sulfatase, or fusion proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-AtsA (21Szameit C. Miech C. Balleininger M. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15375-15381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), anti-AtsB, anti-PAS (see above), anti-GST (Amersham Biosciences), anti-hexahistidine (Qiagen), or anti-HA 12C5A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as primary antibodies. ECL signals of corresponding secondary antibodies were detected by a LAS1000+ imaging system (Raytest) and quantitated by densitometry of digital images using Aida 3.10 software (Raytest).

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6931-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar. The activity of expressed sulfatases was determined in duplicate assays at saturating substrate concentration, as described earlier for AtsA (20Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and PAS (16Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1995; 229: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The presence of FGly in AtsA was analyzed at the level of its tryptic peptides (see Refs. 20Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and 21Szameit C. Miech C. Balleininger M.

During reversed-phase HPLC, P2 and P2* (see “Results”), as detected by mass spectrometry, were recovered in adjacent fractions. The amounts of these peptides were quantitated by sequencing on a Procise cLC protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The presence of FGly was verified by mass spectrometry on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight Reflex III instrument (Bruker Daltonics), using a 337-nm nitrogen laser, with a 200-ns extraction delay. Spectra were obtained as averages of 100 laser shots. 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (Bruker Daltonics) in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid served as matrix. Samples were prepared by the drying droplet method, drying 0.5 μl each of sample and matrix solution on a stainless steel target. For FGly identification, 0.5 μl of 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine (Fluka), saturated in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, was added to the dried sample/matrix mixture on the target. Fragments of theKlebsiella atsA gene were cloned as PCR products into the pAS2 (“bait”) vector in frame with the DNA sequence encoding the HA-tagged Gal4-binding domain (28Tsukada M. Will E. Gallwitz D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For PCR amplification ofatsA fragments, plasmids encoding full-lengthatsA or its signal peptide-deleted version (see above) were used as templates. The forward primer (CCTGAAGGCCATGGAGGCCACAGGAGAGTCAGTCGTG) introduced the underlined SfiI site 5′ of the atsA fragment, and the reverse primers (CGGGATCCGGAAGAACGATAGCCGTGGTGG or CGGGATCCTAGCGGTCGGTCAGCCGCAG) introduced the underlinedBamHI site 3′ of the wild type stop codon or of a stop codon inserted 3′ of codon 112 by the primer, respectively. The PCR products were cloned as SfiI/BamHI fragments into the pAS2 vector, yielding pAS2-AtsA-(1–112), pAS2-AtsA-(21–112), and pAS2-AtsA-(21–577) (see “Results”). The full-lengthatsB gene was cloned into the pACTII (“prey”) vector in frame with the HA-tagged Gal4 activation domain (28Tsukada M. Will E. Gallwitz D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) using a 3′BamHI site present in the multicloning sites of both originating (pBluescriptII KS) and receiving vector. At the 5′-end, a pBluescriptII KS KpnI site, blunted with T4 polymerase, was ligated with a pACTII NcoI site, blunted with Klenow polymerase. The yeast reporter strain Y190 was transformed with both one bait and one prey plasmid. As negative controls, transformations with empty pAS2 or pACTII vectors in combination with a hybrid construct were performed. Cotransformants were selected due to their tryptophan and leucine prototrophy conveyed by the two plasmids (see Ref. 28Tsukada M. Will E. Gallwitz D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Expression of the correct fusion proteins by these cotransformants was routinely controlled by Western blot analysis of cell lysates using anti-HA or anti-AtsB antibodies (not shown). The β-galactosidase activity induced in the case of reconstitution of the Gal4p transcription factor was detected by applying a filter assay with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) as a substrate (29Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar); the permeabilized cells were incubated with X-gal for 6–8 h at 30 °C. The β-galactosidase activity was quantified in a fluid phase assay of cell lysates usingo-nitrophenyl galactoside as a substrate (30Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar) and calculated according to Ref. 31Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar. Codons 21–112 of atsAor atsA-S72C (see above) were amplified by PCR using primers that add a 5′ EcoRI site (GGAATTCTAACAGGAGAGTCAGTCGTG) and a 3′ SacI site (AAGCTTGAGCTCTAGCGGTCGGTCAGCCGCAG). The PCR products were cloned as EcoRI/SacI fragments into the pGEX-KG vector (32Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar) in frame with its glutathione S-transferase encoding sequence. The fusion proteins, or GST only, were overexpressed in induced (0.2 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside), logarithmically growing E. coli DH5α. Bacteria were disrupted in a French press cell and treated with 5 m urea in PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature. The soluble material (75,000 × g supernatant) was subjected to dialysis against PBS to remove the urea. After dialysis and another centrifugation (75,000 × g), the supernatants or, as a control, PBS buffer were loaded on glutathione-agarose (incubation for 30 min at room temperature), which then was washed with 3 × 4 column volumes of PBS. The columns were then loaded at room temperature with the soluble fraction of an E. coli French press lysate (in PBS) containing expressed AtsB protein, and the flow-through was immediately collected without further incubation. After another three washing steps (as above), the columns were eluted twice with 1.5 column volumes of 20 mm glutathione in PBS (pH 8.0). The wash and eluate fractions as well as a final eluate, obtained by boiling the glutathione-agarose beads in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, were analyzed by Western blotting. The Klebsiellaarylsulfatase AtsA, when purified from a total K. pneumoniaecell lysate, was found to be processed by signal peptidase and to carry FGly72 in 60% of sulfatase polypeptides (20Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K. Schmidt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4835-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). When hexahistidine-tagged AtsA, expressed in E. coli together with AtsB, was purified from the periplasm of the cells, FGly modification was observed for 48 ± 2% of polypeptides, whereas in the absence of AtsB no FGly was detected (21Szameit C. Miech C. Balleininger M. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15375-15381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To find out whether AtsB, like AtsA, has a periplasmic localization, as suggested earlier (18Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we performed a subcellular fractionation of E. colicells expressing both AtsA and AtsB. After osmotic shock of the cells AtsB was found exclusively in the spheroplast pellet and not in the supernatant containing the periplasmic proteins, among them AtsA (Fig. 1 A). The appearance of AtsA also in the spheroplasts is attributed to incomplete disruption of the outer membrane. After two-step purification of AtsB, expressed in hexahistidine-tagged form, by Ni2+-NTA-agarose chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 1 B), the AtsB-His6 protein was subjected to amino acid sequencing and found to have an intact N terminus (MLNIAALR). This excludes processing by the signal peptidase. In conclusion, AtsB is a cytosolic protein. The arylsulfatase PAS of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a cysteine-type sulfatase that is quantitatively modified upon expression of its structural gene in E. coli (16Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). When the critical cysteine residue 51 was substituted by a serine (PAS-C51S), no FGly formation was observed (16Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Since the sequence motifs (SXPXR and LTG; see Introduction) determining AtsB-dependent FGly formation in AtsA are contained also in PAS-C51S, the C51S form of PAS was expressed with or without AtsB. As shown in Fig. 2 A, PAS-C51S was expressed as an inactive polypeptide in the absence and presence of AtsB. Control experiments demonstrated that expression of AtsB does not affect the expression of active wild type PAS (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, we conclude that PAS, when converted to a serine-type sulfatase, is not a substrate for the AtsB-dependent FGly-generating machinery. One of the major differences between AtsA and PAS-C51S is the presence or absence of a signal peptide, respectively. Therefore, we deleted the signal peptide of AtsA and investigated whether a cytosolic version of AtsA (AtsAΔSP) is synthesized in active form when coexpressed with AtsB. It turned out that AtsAΔSP showed a very low, albeit significant, catalytic activity of 0.84 ± 0.14 units/mg (n = 5) (i.e. about 1% of wild type AtsA activity) (Fig. 3 A). In the absence of AtsB, AtsAΔSP was expressed as a completely inactive protein. To examine for the presence of FGly, hexahistidine-tagged versions of wild type AtsA and AtsAΔSP were coexpressed with AtsB. The sulfatases were purified on Ni2+-NTA-agarose and analyzed for FGly modification. For this purpose, tryptic peptides were generated and subjected to HPLC on a reversed-phase column, which allowed us to separate unmodified and modified peptide 2 (P2 and P2*) comprising serine or FGly at position 72, respectively. P2 and P2* eluted in adjacent fractions (20Miech C. Dierks T. Selmer T. von Figura K."

It is the prototype of a whole class of flavin reductases with both sequence and functional similarities. The mechanism of reduction of free flavins by ActVB has been studied. Although ActVB was isolated with FMN bound, we have demonstrated that it is not a flavoprotein. Instead, ActVB contains only one flavin binding site, suitable for the flavin reductase activity and with a high affinity for FMN. In addition, ActVB proceeds by an ordered sequential mechanism, where NADH is the first substrate. Whereas ActVB is highly specific for NADH, it is able to catalyze the reduction of a great variety of natural and synthetic flavins, but withK m values ranging from 1 μm (FMN) to 69 μm (lumiflavin). We show that both the ribitol-phosphate chain and the isoalloxazine ring contribute to the protein-flavin interaction. Such properties are unique and set the ActVB family apart from the well characterized Fre flavin reductase family.

Such properties are unique and set the ActVB family apart from the well characterized Fre flavin reductase family. NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductases or flavin reductases are enzymes defined by their ability to catalyze the reduction of free flavins, riboflavin, FMN, or FAD, by reduced pyridine nucleotides, NADPH, or NADH (1Fontecave M. Covès J. Pierre J.L. BioMetals. 1994; 7: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Since flavins do not bind tightly to them, flavin reductases should not be classified as flavoproteins. What the enzyme does is to provide an active site that transiently accommodates both the reduced pyridine nucleotide and the flavin, close to each other, in such a relative orientation that the direct hydride transfer can be enormously accelerated (2Nivière V. Vanoni M.A. Zanetti G. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11879-11887Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 3Ingelman M. Ramaswamy S. Nivière V. Fontecave M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7040-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The real biological function of the reduced flavins, the released products of the catalyzed reaction, is still not well understood. Free reduced flavins have been suggested to play an important role as redox mediators in iron uptake and metabolism in prokaryotes (4Covès J. Fontecave M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or in light emission in bioluminescent bacteria (5Zenno S. Saigo K. Kanoh H. Inouye S. J.

More recently, a group of flavin reductases has been found to be essential in combination with flavin-dependent oxygenases (7Kendrew S.G. Harding S.E. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol.

Organisms have evolved a great variety of such enzymes, which can thus be classified within several families or subfamilies according to their sequence similarities and biochemical properties. Because of their simplicity and their variety, flavin reductases provide a unique tool to understand how a polypeptide chain deals with both the isoalloxazine ring and the ribityl chain of a flavin molecule to modulate its binding constant, to accelerate its reduction by reduced pyridine nucleotide, and to use it for a diversity of functions. Surprisingly, our knowledge of this class of enzymes is very limited so far, and this is the reason why flavin reductases have been the subject of intensive investigations in our laboratory in recent years (3Ingelman M. Ramaswamy S. Nivière V. Fontecave M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7040-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 14Fieschi F. Nivière V. Frier C. Décout J.L. Fontecave M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18252-18260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The prototype of one group of flavin reductases is the Fre enzyme found in Escherichia coli (18Fontecave M. Eliasson R. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12325-12331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also in luminescent bacteria (19Zenno S. Saigo K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3544-3551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme from E. coli consists of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular mass of 26 kDa. It uses both NADPH and NADH as the electron donor and a great variety of flavin analogues as electron acceptors (14Fieschi F. Nivière V. Frier C. Décout J.L. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30392-30400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Nivière V. Fieschi F. Décout J.L. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18252-18260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This clearly demonstrates that the recognition of the flavin by the polypeptide chain occurs exclusively through the isoalloxazine ring, with very limited contribution of the ribityl side chain (3Ingelman M. Ramaswamy S. Nivière V. Fontecave M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7040-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 14Fieschi F. Nivière V. Frier C. Décout J.L. Fontecave M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7040-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) reveals that the general enzyme structure is, despite very low sequence similarities, similar to the structures of a large family of flavoenzymes, with spinach ferredoxin-NADP+reductase as the prototype (20Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It provides insights to the understanding of the structural basis for the difference in flavin recognition between a flavoprotein and a flavin reductase. A second group of flavin reductases, different from the Fre family and the flavin reductases purified from bioluminescent bacteria, has recently emerged (7Kendrew S.G. Harding S.E. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17339-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8Thibaut D. Ratet N. Bish D. Faucher D. Debussche L. Blanche F. J.

Nagel S. Egli T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6937-6943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, very few members of this group were purified to homogeneity and carefully characterized. These enzymes are defined on the basis of their amino acid sequence similarities and their role during biological oxidation reactions. Indeed, some monooxygenase systems depend on the presence of a reduced flavin, mainly FMNH2, as a co-substrate rather than a prosthetic group. The flavin is supposed to react with molecular oxygen in the active site of the monooxygenase component in order to generate a flavin hydroperoxide intermediate that serves as the active oxidant for substrate oxidation. A separate flavin reductase is thus absolutely required to supply the reduced flavins (with NADPH or NADH as the reductant) that diffuse to the oxygenase component. In recent years, the following flavin reductases have been shown to belong to this family: ActVB (7Kendrew S.G. Harding S.E. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17339-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), SnaC (8Thibaut D. Ratet N. Bish D. Faucher D. Debussche L. Blanche F. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5199-5205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and VlmR (9Parry R.J. Li W. J. Biol.

Prieto M.A. Garcia J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) for the oxidation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetate in E. coli; DszD (11Gray K.A. Pogrebinsky O.S. Mrachko G.T., Xi, L. Monticello D.J. Squires C.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1705-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) for the conversion of sulfides to sulfoxides and sulfones inRhodococcus sp., allowing the utilization of these microorganisms in fossil fuel desulfurization biotechnological processes; and cB (12Uetz T. Schneider R. Snozzi M. Egli T. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the degradation of nitrilotriacetate inChelatobacter heintzii. It should be noted that a flavin reductase called FeR (21Vadas A. Monbouquette H.G. Johnson E. Schröder I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36715-36721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Chiu H.J. Johnson E. Schröder I. Rees D.C. Structure. 2001; 9: 311-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), with some homology to ActVB and SnaC, found as a ferric reductase in the hyperthermophilic archaeaArchaeoglobus fulgidus, has been structurally characterized in complex with FMN (22Chiu H.J. Johnson E. Schröder I. Rees D.C. Structure. 2001; 9: 311-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Considering the biological importance of this group of flavin reductases and the very limited amount of available information regarding their substrate specificity, reaction mechanisms, and three-dimensional structure, we found it worth characterizing these enzymes in more detail in order to compare them with the Fre enzyme and get new insights into the protein-flavin interaction. We have chosen ActVB as a representative of this group of flavin reductase and report original data showing that ActVB has a unique mode of flavin binding and operates by a sequential mechanism. In the standard aerobic assay, flavin reductases activities were carried out under aerobic conditions allowing continuous reoxidation of reduced flavin by oxygen. Flavin reductase activity was determined at 25 °C from the decrease of the absorbance at 340 nm (ε340 nm = 6.22 mm−1 cm−1) due to the oxidation of NADH, using a Varian Cary 1 Bio spectrophotometer. Under standard conditions, the spectroscopic cuvette contained, in a final volume of 500 μl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 100 μmNADH, and 50 μm FMN. The reaction was initiated by adding 0.5–1 μg of enzyme. Enzyme activities were determined from the linear part of the progress curve, with less than 10% of reduced pyridine nucleotide utilized over the time course of the reaction. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of protein catalyzing the oxidation of 1 μmol of NADH per min. When high concentrations of NAD(P)H were investigated, a 0.1-cm path length cuvette was used (final volume 0.3 ml). The hydrophobic flavin analogues lumichrome, alloxazine, and lumiflavin were dissolved in 100% Me2SO, and the enzymatic assays thus contained 90 mmMe2SO, final concentration. Me2SO concentrations up to 500 mm had no measurable effect onK m and V m values. NAD(P) analogs and flavin concentrations were determined spectroscopically using the following extinction coefficients: AMP and ADP-ribose, ε259 nm = 15.4 mm−1cm−1; β-NAD(P)+, ε259 nm = 17.8 mm−1 cm−1; NMNH, ε338 nm = 5.72 mm−1 cm−1; riboflavin and FMN, ε450 nm = 12.5 mm−1 cm−1; FAD, ε450 nm = 11.3 mm−1 cm−1; lumichrome, ε356 nm = 6.0 mm−1cm−1. For the production of wild-type ActVB, pACTVB plasmid was used (7Kendrew S.G. Harding S.E. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17339-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), where the actVBstructural gene was placed under the control of the T7 polymerase promotor, in the pT7-7 plasmid. For the production of ActVB-His as C-terminal histidine-tagged fusion protein, the actVB gene was amplified by PCR from the plasmid pACTVB (7Kendrew S.G. Harding S.E. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17339-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with the oligonucleotide primers GGGAATTCCATATGGCTGCTGACCAGG and CGCGGATCCTCAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGACCGGCATGCGCGGGCAC, in order to introduce EcoRI, NdeI, andBamHI restriction sites (underlined) and the six histidine codons (in italic type). The 549-base pair PCR product was digested with EcoRI-BamHI, and the resulting fragment was ligated in pUC18 (pUC18-ActVB). This plasmid was sequenced to confirm that no changes had been introduced during PCR amplification. TheNdeI-BamHI fragment from pUC18-ActVB was subsequently cloned in pT7-7, resulting in the plasmid pACTVB His tag. E. coliB834(DE3) pLysS transformed with the appropriate plasmid (pACTVB or pACTVB His tag) was grown at 37 °C and 220 rpm in a 3-liter Erlenmeyer flask containing 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium in the presence of 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Growth was monitored by following the absorbance at 600 nm. Expression of ActVB and ActVB-His recombinant proteins was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 250 μm when the optical density of the culture was about 0.3. To minimize the formation of insoluble protein aggregates, cultures were cooled to 25 °C after the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and then further grown for 5 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 6500 × g at 4 °C. Extraction of soluble proteins was performed by lysozyme digestion and freeze-thawing cycles, in the presence of antiprotease Complete™ buffer. All of the following operations were performed at 4 °C. After ultracentrifugation at 45,000 rpm during 90 min in a Beckman 60 Ti rotor, the supernatant was used as soluble extracts for purification. The soluble extracts (130 mg) were loaded onto an ACA54 column (360 ml) previously equilibrated with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA. Proteins were eluted with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions containing flavin reductase activity were pooled and concentrated to 2 ml using a Diaflo cell equipped with a YM 10 membrane. The concentrated enzyme solution was loaded onto a Superdex 75 column (120 ml fromAmersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 25 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA (buffer A). Proteins were eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Fractions containing flavin reductase activity were pooled and loaded onto a UNO Q column (6 ml; Bio-Rad), equilibrated with buffer A. A linear 0–500 mm NaCl gradient in buffer A was applied for 60 ml. ActVB was eluted with 100 mm NaCl. The soluble extracts (180 mg) were loaded at 0.5 ml/min onto a 25-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6 (buffer B). Then the column was washed with 100 ml of buffer B, and elution was achieved with 100 mm imidazole in the same buffer at 1 ml/min. The proteins were then immediately loaded onto a UNO Q column (6 ml; Bio-Rad), and further eluted with a linear 0–500 mm NaCl gradient in buffer B for 60 ml at 1 ml/min. SDS-PAGE polyacrylamide gels (15% polyacrylamide) were done according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). The gels were calibrated with the Amersham Biosciences low molecular weight markers. The native molecular mass of the protein was determined with a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (120 ml; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, and 150 mm NaCl using a flow rate of 0.4 ml·min−1. Bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa) were used as the markers for molecular mass. The void volume was determined with ferritin (450 kDa). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Anaerobic experiments were carried out in a Jacomex glove box equipped with an HP 8453 diode array spectrophotometer coupled to the measurement cell by optical fibers (Photonetics system). A sample of pure ActVB or ActVB-His protein was boiled for 10 min in the dark, chilled on ice, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g in order to pellet the denatured protein. An aliquot of the supernatant was analyzed both by UV-visible spectroscopy and by thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60 F254 (Merck) with butanol-1/acetic acid/water (10/5/5) as the eluant. As a control, pure FMN, FAD, and riboflavin were run separately or as a mixture under the same conditions. The molar concentration of ActVB was calculated assuming a molecular mass value of the polypeptide chain of 18,260 Da (7Kendrew S.G. Harding S.E. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17339-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Reciprocal initial velocities (1/v i) were plotted against reciprocal substrate concentrations (1/[S]) and fitted with a straight line determined by a linear regression program. In some cases, kinetic parameters (V m, K m,K m(app)) were determined from saturation curves, fitted with the following equation: v i = (V m[S])/(K m + [S]), using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Inhibition constants (K i) for competitive inhibitors were determined using a secondary plot of the slopes from the double reciprocal plots against the concentration of the inhibitor [I], corresponding to the following equation: y = (K m/V m) (1 + ([I]/K i)) (25Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). In the cases of noncompetitive and uncompetitive inhibitors, the inhibition constant (K i) was determined using a secondary plot of the intercepts from the double reciprocal plot against the concentration of the inhibitor [I], corresponding to the following equation:y = (([I]/(K i V m)) + 1/V m (25Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). When applicable, values are shown ± S.D. In a first set of experiments, ActVB was overexpressed in E. coli using the pACTVB plasmid (7Kendrew S.G. Harding S.E. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17339-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Using the purification procedure described under “Experimental Procedures,” a low yield (6–7%) of purified ActVB could be obtained (Table I, top). This was then explained by the great instability of the flavin reductase activity in the soluble extracts. The activity, routinely assayed from the oxidation of NADH by an excess of FMN monitored spectrophotometrically, was found to decrease by 50% when the protein was left in buffer for 3 h at 4 °C. The addition of 10% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, and CompleteTM buffer solution to the soluble extracts provided a significant stabilization of the activity (data not shown). However, even under these conditions, more than 90% of the flavin reductase activity was lost during the first two chromatographic steps (Table I, top). After the UNO Q column, activity remained stable, suggesting that instability of ActVB activity in soluble extracts arose from reactions with some cellular components. SDS-PAGE analysis after the UNO Q purification step revealed the presence of two polypeptide bands at 18,000 and 17,000 Da (data not shown), with the same AADQGMLRDA N-terminal sequence corresponding to the ActVB protein (7Kendrew S.G. Harding S.E. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17339-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This suggested a partial C-terminal proteolysis of ActVB when expressed inE. coli, as described previously (7Kendrew S.G. Harding S.E. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17339-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of ActVB as a C-terminal His-tagged fusion protein (ActVB-His) allowed a more efficient purification of the enzyme (TableI, bottom). SDS-PAGE analysis after the UNO Q column revealed the presence of only one polypeptide chain at 18,000, without evidence for partial proteolysis (data not shown).Table IPurification stepProteinActivity1-aEnzyme activity was determined at 25 °C using the standard aerobic assay in the presence of 100 μm NADH and 50 μm FMN.Specific activityRecoverymgμmol min −1μmol min −1 mg −1%Purification of ActVB Soluble fraction1309107100 ACA 5440360940 Superdex 753.661176.7 UNO Q1.857326.2Purification of ActVB-His Soluble fraction1809005100 Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid113082834 UNO Q828035311-a Enzyme activity was determined at 25 °C using the standard aerobic assay in the presence of 100 μm NADH and 50 μm FMN. Open table in a new tab Gel filtration experiments on a Superdex 75 column with ActVB and ActVB-His gave an apparent molecular mass of 36,000 Da for both proteins, confirming the homodimeric structure for ActVB (7Kendrew S.G. Harding S.E. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17339-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Flavin reductase specific activities of both ActVB and ActVB-His proteins were found to be comparable (Table I), indicating that the C-terminal part of the protein lost during proteolysis was not important for activity and that the presence of the His tag was neutral with regard to the enzyme activity. However, it should be noted that from one preparation to another, we obtained purified proteins with slightly different specific flavin reductase activities. In the following experiments presented here, we report data obtained with ActVB. In the case of the kinetic experiments, the same enzyme preparation was used, allowing a direct comparison of the parameters obtained under different kinetic conditions. Purified ActVB was yellow, with absorption spectra typical for a flavin-containing protein, with maxima at 378 and 455 nm (Fig. 1). After denaturation of the protein by boiling for 10 min and centrifugation, the chromophore contained in the supernatant was analyzed by thin layer chromatography with FMN, riboflavin, and FAD as standards. The chromophore was identified as FMN (data not shown). Quantification of the free FMN released in the supernatant by UV-visible spectroscopy demonstrated that the amount of FMN in purified ActVB varied from one preparation to another from 0.1 to 0.6 mol of FMN/mol of polypeptide chain. An extinction coefficient of 13,640 m−1cm−1 at 455 nm for the bound FMN was calculated. Reconstitution experiments of ActVB with FMN or riboflavin gave the following results. A preparation of ActVB (50 μm) containing little FMN (0.1 mol of FMN/mol of protein) was incubated with 1 mm FMN or 400 μm riboflavin for 1 h in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.6, and then chromatographed on an NAP10™ column (Amersham Biosciences) in order to remove unbound flavin. The protein was then analyzed both by UV-visible spectroscopy and thin layer chromatography, as previously described, in order to identify and quantify the bound flavin in the reconstituted ActVB. Reconstitution with FMN resulted in a 6–7-fold increase of the amount of protein-bound FMN and a protein containing 0.6–0.7 mol of FMN/mol of protein (data not shown). In contrast, reconstitution with riboflavin failed to increase the amount of protein-bound flavin and did not result in the removal of FMN initially bound to ActVB (data not shown). In order to verify that the FMN bound to the isolated ActVB protein was correctly located at the flavin reductase active site, reductive titration of FMN was carried out with NADH, under anaerobic conditions. A preparation of ActVB containing 0.5 mol of FMN/mol of ActVB polypeptide chain (18,260 Da) was used for that experiment. As shown in Fig. 2, the addition of NADH caused a decrease in the absorbance at 455 nm, reflecting a reduction of FMN. An isosbestic point at 510 nm was observed for substoichiometric concentrations of NADH. In the inset of Fig. 2, a plot of the fractional absorbance changes at 445 nm as a function of the [NADH]/[FMN] ratio showed that 1 mol of NADH was sufficient to reduce 1 mol of bound FMN. In addition, during the NADH titration, a broad absorption band above 550 nm developed (Fig. 2). Such a band is tentatively assigned to a charge transfer complex of reduced FMN with NAD+ within the active site of ActVB rather than to a flavin-neutral semiquinone species (26Massey V.

Aliverti A. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoproteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 306-312Google Scholar), as confirmed by the following experiment (Fig. 3). An anaerobic solution of ActVB, containing 0.5 mol of bound FMN/mol of polypeptide chain, EDTA, and a catalytic amount of deazaflavin was photoreduced and then titrated with increasing amounts of NAD+. As shown in Fig. 3, irradiation resulted in the decrease of the absorbance at 455 nm, consistent with reduction of FMN by photoreduced deazaflavin. When NAD+ was added, a broad band developed at wavelengths greater than 520 nm, which was similar to that observed during reaction of ActVB-bound FMN with NADH. In addition, no significant increase in absorbance at 340 nm was observed, indicating that no NADH was formed during incubation of reduced FMN with NAD+. This shows that the reduction of FMN by NADH at the active site of ActVB is irreversible.Figure 3Anaerobic titration of reduced ActVB-bound FMN with NAD+.

In order to investigate the dependence of the flavin reductase activity of ActVB on the amount of protein-bound FMN, different preparations containing various amounts of FMN were assayed either with FMN or riboflavin as a substrate and with NADH as the electron donor (Table"
https://openalex.org/W2060776370,"The trehalose-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) was purified from the cytosol of Mycobacterium smegmatis to near homogeneity using a variety of conventional steps to achieve a purification of about 1600-fold with a yield of active enzyme of about 1%. Based on gel filtration, the active enzyme had a molecular weight of about 27,000, and the most purified fraction also gave a major band on SDS-PAGE corresponding to a molecular weight of about 27,000. A number of peptides from the 27-kDa protein were sequenced and these sequences showed considerable homology to the trehalose-P phosphatase (otsB) of Escherichia coli. Based on these peptides, the M. smegmatis gene for TPP was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The recombinant protein was synthesized with a (His)6 tag at the amino terminus. Most of the TPP activity in the crude E. coli sonicate was initially found in the membrane fraction, but it became solubilized in the presence of 0.2% Sarkosyl. The solubilized protein was purified to apparent homogeneity on a metal ion column and this fraction had high phosphatase activity that was completely specific for trehalose-P. The purified enzyme, either isolated from M. smegmatis, or expressed in E. coli, rapidly dephosphorylated trehalose-6-P, but had essentially no activity on any other sugar phosphates, or onp-nitrophenyl phosphate. The K m for trehalose-6-P was about 1.6 mm, and the pH optimum was about 7.5. The native enzyme showed an almost absolute requirement for Mg2+ and was not very active with Mn2+, whereas both of these cations were equally effective with the recombinant TPP. The enzyme activity was inhibited by the antibiotics, diumycin and moenomycin, but not by a number of other antibiotics or trehalose analogs. TPP activity was strongly inhibited by the detergents, Sarkosyl and deoxycholate, even at 0.025%, but it was not inhibited by Nonidet P-40, Triton X-100, or octyl glucoside, even at concentrations up to 0.3%. The purified enzyme was stable to heating at 60 °C for up to 6 min, but was slowly inactivated at 70 °C. Circular dichroism studies on recombinant TPP indicate that the secondary structure of this protein has considerable β-pleated sheet and is very compact. TPP may play a key role in the biosynthesis of trehalose compounds, such as trehalose mycolates, and therefore may represent an excellent target site for chemotherapy against tuberculosis and other mycobacterial diseases.

In these organisms, it is believed to serve diverse roles, one of which is as a storehouse of glucose for energy and/or for the synthesis of cell components, another is for protection of cells against environmental pressures such as desiccation and freezing, and for stabilization of proteins against denaturation (1DeVirgilio C. Hottinger T. Dominguez J. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In addition to these several functions for trehalose that have been demonstrated in yeast, fungi, and insects, some other organisms such as mycobacteria and corynebacteria also utilize trehalose as a structural component in their cell walls (2Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). Thus, in these organisms, trehalose serves as the backbone of several different glycolipids, such as trehalose mycolate, various sulfolipids, and other acylated-trehalose compounds (3Takayama K. Armstrong E.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4Alugupalli S. Laneele M-A. Larsson L. Daffe M. J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9832-9837Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because trehalose is neither synthesized by, nor utilized in, mammalian cells, but is probably an essential molecule for the structural integrity of the mycobacterial cell wall, the reactions involved in the biosynthesis of trehalose and trehalose glycolipids should represent excellent potential target sites for chemotherapy againstMycobacterium tuberculosis, and other mycobacterial pathogens. Thus, the mechanisms of action and the properties of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of trehalose represent important information for the design and development of new antimycobacterial drugs. The major pathway for the synthesis of trehalose and trehalose derivatives in most organisms involves the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose (or GDP-glucose) to glucose-6-P to produce trehalose 6-phosphate plus UDP (or GDP) (6Cabib E. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 259-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This reaction is catalyzed by trehalose-P synthase (TPS),1but this enzyme apparently differs from one organism to another in terms of the nucleoside diphosphate glucose that is able to serve as the glucosyl donor (7Lornitzo F.A. Goldman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2730-2734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Elbein A.D. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 1623-1630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lapp D. Patterson B.W. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4567-4579Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). For example, the TPS of Mycobacterium smegmatis and M. tuberculosis can utilize either GDP-glucose or UDP-glucose (or even other glucose nucleotides) as glucosyl donors for trehalose synthesis (10Pan Y.T. Drake R.R. Elbein A.D. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the TPS from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is apparently specific for UDP-glucose (11Bell W. Klaasen P. Ohnacker M. Boller T. Herweijer M. Schoppink P. van der Zee P. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), although there is one report of an ADP-glucose-dependent trehalose synthase in these yeast (12Paschoalin V.M.F. Silva J.T. Panek A.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Organisms that utilize TPS for trehalose synthesis also contain a phosphatase that converts trehalose-P to free trehalose (6Cabib E. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 259-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the gene (otsB) for this enzyme has been identified inEscherichia coli (13Giaever H.M. Styrvold O.B. Kaasen I. Strom A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2841-2849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hengge-Aronis R. Klein W. Lange R. Rimmele M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7792-7918Crossref Google Scholar) and other organisms, the specificity and properties of the phosphatase have not been described in any detail. We previously reported on the presence of TPP inM. smegmatis (15Matula M. Mitchell M. Elbein A.D. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 217-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this phosphatase appeared to be relatively specific for trehalose-P, with fairly low activity toward glucose-6-P or other sugar phosphates. Here we describe the biochemical properties of TPP. M. smegmatis was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 14468). M. smegmatismc2155 was provided by Dr. W. R. Jacobs Jr., Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York. The E. coli strains DH5α and HMS-F (16Gutman P.D. Carroll J.D. Masters C.I. Minton K.W. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 141: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) were used for cloning and expression studies, respectively. HMS-F is a derivative of the expression strain HMS174(DE-3) (Novagen). HMS174(DE3) contains a chromosomal IPTG-inducible T7 RNA pol gene. HMS-F contains an additional copy of the lac repressor lacIq on an F episome, which was transferred from E. colicloning strain XL-1 (Stratagene). This addition effectively represses expression from the T7 promoter on the E. coli expression vector pET15b (Novagen) in the absence of IPTG. HMS-F was routinely cultured in the presence of 10 μg/ml tetracycline to maintain carriage of the F episome. E. coli strains were cultured in L broth and on L agar supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 20 μg/ml kanamycin, or 10 μg/ml tetracycline, individually or in combination, where applicable. M. smegmatis was cultured in Middlebrook 7H9 broth and on Middlebrook 7H10 agar, supplemented in each case with the 10% (v/v) oleic acid-albumin-dextrose complex. All bacterial strains were cultured at 37 °C. Trehalose phosphate, buffers, DEAE-cellulose, and other chromatographic resins and materials were from Sigma. Sephadex G-75 and all electrophoresis materials were from Bio-Rad. Except where otherwise specified, all DNA manipulation enzymes, including restriction endonucleases, polymerases, and ligase, were supplied by New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Custom oligonucleotide primers were commercially synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). PCR reagents were supplied by Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). All other reagents were from reliable chemical companies, and were of the best grade available. Moenomycin was a generous gift from Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH and diumycin was kindly supplied by Bristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute. The enzymatic activity of TPP was measured by determining the release of inorganic phosphate from trehalose-6-P, or other sugar phosphates. Briefly, the assay was done in a final volume of 100 μl, containing the following components: 1 mm trehalose-6-P, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and an appropriate amount of enzyme. After an incubation at 37 °C of 1 to 30 min, two volumes of a filtered solution containing 0.15% malachite green, 1% ammonium molybdate, and 12.5% (v/v) concentrated HCl were added to the incubation, and the mixture was allowed to incubate for an additional 2 min to allow for development of color. The absorbance of the mixture was read at 630 nm and compared with a standard solution of inorganic phosphate treated in the same manner (15Matula M. Mitchell M. Elbein A.D. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 217-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). M. smegmatiswas grown in 2-liter flasks containing 1 liter of trypticase soy broth. One ml of an overnight culture of this organism was used to inoculate these flasks and they were incubated at 37 °C for 24–36 h, with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored as a paste in aluminum foil at −20 °C, until used. All purification steps were done at 4 °C, unless otherwise specified. Forty grams of wet cell paste of M. smegmatis were suspended in 200 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol. The cells were broken by subjecting the cell suspension to two 3-min pulses of sonication with a Braun probe sonicator at 80% of maximum setting. The broken cell suspension was then centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 15 min to remove unbroken cells and cellular debris, and the resulting supernatant liquid, representing the cytosolic fraction, was removed and saved. Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added slowly with stirring to the ice-cold crude extract to a final concentration of 40% saturation, and the mixture was allowed to stir in the cold for 15 min. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation and discarded, and solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant fraction with stirring to give a final concentration of 75% saturation. The mixture was allowed to stand on ice for 15 min, and the precipitate was isolated by centrifugation and resuspended in 40 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Small aliquots of the above ammonium sulfate fraction were heated at 60 °C for 45 s. The tubes were cooled in an ice bath for 10 min, and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 1 h. The supernatant liquids were pooled and concentrated with an Amicon Filtration Apparatus using a Millipore YM-10 membrane. A 3-ml aliquot of the supernatant liquid from Step 3 was applied to a 2.6 × 95-cm column of Sephadex G-75 that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 1 m KCl (Buffer A). Five-ml fractions of the eluate were collected and assayed for TPP activity, as described above. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated on the Amicon apparatus. This fraction was then applied to a Sephacryl S-300 (1.6 × 90 cm) column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol (Buffer B). The column was eluted with the same buffer and 5-ml fractions were collected and assayed for TPP activity. Active fractions were pooled and used in subsequent steps. The enzyme from the Sephacryl S-300 column was applied to a 1.4 × 8-cm column of DE-52 that had been equilibrated with Buffer B. After application of the sample, the column was washed with the same buffer, containing 50 mm NaCl. The enzyme was then eluted with 90 mmNaCl in the same buffer. Fractions were collected and those containing active enzyme were pooled and concentrated to 3 ml on the Amicon concentrator. The concentrated enzyme was desalted on an Econo-Pac 10 DG chromatography column that had been equilibrated with 25 mm piperizine-HCl buffer, pH 5.5, containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol (Buffer C). This buffer was also used to elute the enzyme. The enzyme from the above step was applied to a 0.9 × 14-cm column of Polybuffer exchange (PBE 94) that had been equilibrated with Buffer C. The enzyme was eluted from the column with Polybuffer 74-HCl, pH 4.0, containing 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol. Fractions of 2 ml were collected and each fraction was analyzed for protein, enzymatic activity, and pH. The enzyme emerged from the column at pH 4.8 to 4.4. Active fractions were pooled, and concentrated on the Amicon apparatus. Preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done at 4 °C in tubes containing 7% acrylamide (17Yang J.T., Wu, C.H.C. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). During electrophoresis, the voltage was maintained at 300. One gel was stained with Coomassie Blue stain to detect protein, whereas other gels were cut into 2-mm sections and protein was eluted by overnight diffusion at 4 °C into Buffer B. Elutions were assayed for TPP activity. Table I presents a summary of the purification procedure, including changes in specific activity, amount of purification, and yield of enzyme at each step of the procedure.Table IPurification of trehalose-phosphate phosphatasePurification stepProteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationYieldmgunits1-aUnits are expressed as nanomole of Pi released from trehalose-P in 1 min.units/mg-fold%Crude extract1,43069,184480100(NH4)2SO4fraction55054,48899279Gel filtration10731,7722595.445DE-522817,04260412.527Chromatofocusing2.67,2272,7805810Native gel0.0185681,5711,6861.21-a Units are expressed as nanomole of Pi released from trehalose-P in 1 min. Open table in a new tab Protein was measured with the Bio-Rad protein reagent (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The molecular weight of TPP was estimated by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300, as well as by gel electrophoresis. Molecular weight standards included β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12 kDa). Open reading frames (ORFs) were identified by BLASTP alignment with predicted amino acid sequences on GenBankTM. Multiple amino acid alignments were performed using on line CLUSTALW alignment program at a web site maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI; www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). Basic sequence analysis, including identification of restriction sites, translations, and DNA sequence alignments, were performed using the “Genejockey” program (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). To investigate the conformation of the recombinant TPP, near-UV and far-UV were recorded at 25 °C with a Jasco Model 715 spectrophotometer. Protein concentrations of 1 and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively, in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, were used for recording near-UV and far-UV spectra. The reported spectra are the average of five scans, which were smoothed and corrected for buffer blanks. CD data were expressed as mean residue molar ellipticity with 115 as the mean residue molecular weight. Secondary structure parameters were estimated by the computer program PROSEC derived by Yang et al. (17Yang J.T., Wu, C.H.C. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). TPP was purified about 1600-fold to near homogeneity using the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures,” and outlined in TableI. Two of the best steps in the purification are shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1 A, the ammonium sulfate fraction (40 to 75% saturation) was applied to a column of Sephadex G-75. Because the TPP is a small protein (27 kDa), it was readily separated from much of the protein in the extract by gel filtration, and the activity eluted in a symmetrical peak after the major protein peak. Fig. 1 B shows the chromatofocusing step that also gave a sharp peak of TPP activity that was separated from much of the protein in the DE-52 eluate. At the final stage of purification, the enzyme fraction showed a major protein band of 27 kDa, and several minor bands on SDS gels. This purification procedure gave a yield of enzyme of only about 1%, but that provided a sufficient amount of protein to isolate peptides and obtain amino acid sequence data to use for cloning the gene, and expressing recombinant TPP. The major 27-kDa protein band was cut from the SDS gels and sent to Harvard Microchemical Systems Inc. for protein sequencing by mass spectrometry. Based on the amino acid sequence information, several primers were prepared and used in PCR as described below. The TIGR unfinished M. smegmatis genome sequence was screened using the TBLASTN program for DNA sequences corresponding to the amino acid sequences obtained from purified M. smegmatis TPP. All of the primary amino acid sequences aligned with a region of Contig 3312. However, because this region of the genome sequence has not yet been corrected or edited, we were unable to identify the boundaries of the ORF corresponding to the amino acid sequence. We used oligonucleotide primers DC172 (TCATCGCGGCGAGGTCGGCGACCGTA, complementary to nucleotides 1111068–1111096 of M. smegmatis contig 3312) and DC173 (CGAGCGCATCTTCGACGCGGCCAAGC, corresponding to nucleotides 1108256–1108281 of M. smegmatis contig 3312) to PCR amplify a 2.8-kb region of the M. smegmatis genome that contained the putative TPP coding region. The PCR product was ligated into the vector pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen), generating the plasmid p996A481. Sequence analysis of the p996A481 insert demonstrated the presence of 2 complete ORFs and 1 partial ORF. ORF1 extended from 384 to 1121. The predicted 245-residue product was highly homologous (90% amino acid identity plus 6% similarity) with the M. tuberculosis ORF Rv3574, which is annotated as a possible transcriptional regulator of the Tet/AcrR family. ORF2 was located immediately downstream of ORF1, extending from 1122 to 1874. This potentially encoded a 250-residue 27-kDa polypeptide. BLASTP analysis of the ORF2 amino acid sequence indicated homology with trehalose-6-P phosphatases from Corynebacterium glutamicum (31% identity, 13% similarity, E = 7e−17), and from E. coli (33% identity, 11% similarity, E = 1e−14). Lesser degrees of homology were detected between ORF2 and the putative M. tuberculosis putative trehalose-P phosphatases Rv2006 (otsB, 28% identity, 12% similarity, = 6e−07) and Rv3372 (otsB2, 28% identity, 13% similarity,E = e−05). ORF3 was orientated in opposition to ORF1/ORF2 extended from 2838 to 1875. This encoded a 35.2 kDa 328-residue with a high degree of homology (73% identity plus 10% similarity) with M. tuberculosis ORF Rv3575c, a possible transcriptional regulator related to the E. coliraffinose repressor. ORF2 (otsB) was PCR amplified using the primers DC186 (GGGGCATATGCAGCGCGC, corresponding to nucleotides 1136–1153 of the p996A481 insert sequence) and DC187 (CGGGGATCCACGTTCTGGAGAC, complementary to nucleotides 1915–1936 of the p996A481 insert sequence). These contained the requisite base mismatches (indicated by underlines) to generate an upstream CATATG NdeI site and a downstreamBamHI site. The central “ATG” in DC186 represents the start codon of the recombinant ORF. The 0.8-kb DC186/DC187 PCR product was amplified, digested with NdeI and BamHI, and ligated with the NdeI- and BamHI-digested expression plasmid pET15b (Invitrogen), generating the plasmid p996A504. The identity of the PCR product and the fidelity of the amplification was confirmed by DNA sequencing. p996A504 was transformed into the E. coli expression strain HMS-F. The predicted amino acid sequence of M. smegmatis TPP is presented in Fig. 2 and is compared with similar enzymes in other organisms. The E. coliexpression strain HMS-F transformed with p996A504 was grown and induced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The crude sonicate, as well as the supernatant (cytosolic) and pellet (i.e.membrane) fractions resulting from high speed centrifugation were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue. Fig. 3 presents the results of these studies. In the absence of IPTG induction, only a small amount of 27-kDa band was detected (lane 2) and this band was apparently removed by centrifugation (lane 3). Incubation of the cells in IPTG resulted in production of substantial amounts of the 27-kDa band (lane 4), but again much of this protein was pelleted by high-speed centrifugation (lanes 5 and6). The protein could be mostly solubilized by addition of 0.2% Sarkosyl to the crude homogenates before the centrifugation as seen in lanes 8 and 9. The solubilized fraction had strong trehalose-P phosphatase activity and could be purified to a single band as shown below. The solubilized protein was applied to a nickel ion column and after thorough washing in 10 mm imidazole, the column was eluted batchwise with various concentrations of imidazole. Fig. 4 shows that 250 mm imidazole eluted a single protein that migrated slightly faster than the 31-kDa protein standard and this fraction had strong TPP activity. This protein fraction was used in all subsequent studies to compare its properties with those of the native TPP isolated from mycobacteria. The expressed protein containing a (His)6 tag was purified to near homogeneity on a metal ion column. As shown in Fig. 4(lane 6), the elution from this column showed a single protein on SDS gels with a molecular weight of about 27,000. As demonstrated below, this protein had strong phosphatase activity, and this activity was very specific for trehalose-P. The enzyme purified from E. coli was characterized in terms of pH optima, substrate specificity, and metal ion requirements, and other properties as discussed below. The TPP purified from M. smegmatis and the recombinant TPP had almost identical properties except for their requirement for divalent cations (see below). The pH optimum of TPP was determined using two different buffers as shown in Fig. 5. The pH optimum of this activity was 7.0–7.5 using either Tris-HCl or Tris maleate buffers. The enzyme had almost no activity at either pH 5 or 9, in contrast to many nonspecific acid or alkaline phosphatases that have maximum activity at around pH 5.0 or 9.0. TPP was incubated with a variety of sugar phosphates, tested at 2 and 5 mm concentrations, to determine whether any of them could serve as substrates for this enzyme. Fig. 6 demonstrates that this enzyme had very strong phosphatase activity toward trehalose-P, but essentially no activity with any of the other sugar phosphates. The slight activity seen with glucose-6-P or glucose-1-P is probably because of small amounts of inorganic phosphate present in these substrates as a result of some degradation (i.e. loss of phosphate) during storage, because the substrate itself gives some background color in the phosphate determination. The enzyme also had no activity on the general phosphatase substrate, para-nitrophenyl phosphate. This data indicates that TPP is an unusual and very specific phosphatase, because these enzymes usually have a rather broad substrate specificity and can hydrolyze many different phosphate esters. The effect of trehalose-P concentration on the reaction rate was determined. The rate of the reaction was proportional to the amount of trehalose-P in the incubation up to about 5 mm, and theK m for trehalose-P was calculated to be about 1.6 mm (data not shown). Native TPP showed an almost absolute requirement for the divalent cation Mg2+, as shown in Fig. 7. The data in this figure also show that Mn2+ worked to some extent, but was much less effective than Mg2+. The optimum concentration of Mg2+for the native TPP was about 1–2 mm. On the other hand, the recombinant TPP was somewhat different in regard to its reactivity with Mn2+ as also shown in Fig. 7, because this TPP showed almost equal activity with both Mn2+ and Mg2+. In either case, the optimum concentration of cation was about 3–4 mm. The significance of this difference in cation requirement between the native and recombinant TPPs is not clear at this time, but it could be related to the presence of the His tag on the recombinant protein. TPP was subjected to far-UV and near-UV circular dichroism measurements as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A summation of the data is presented in Table II and indicates that the protein has about 50% β-pleated sheet, and is quite compact.Table IILevels (%) of secondary structure elementsα-Helix6.3β-Sheet53.7β-Turn4.0Random coil36.0 Open table in a new tab The enzymatic activity was not inhibited by 10 mm sodium fluoride or 10 mm sodium orthovanadate. It was also not inhibited by a variety of sugars such as trehalose, maltose, glucose-6-P, glucose-1-P, GlcNAc-1-P, at up to 10 mm concentrations, nor by 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, or acetyl-coenzyme A. The enzyme also did not show any phosphatase activity toward any of these phosphorylated compounds. Both the natural TPP and the recombinant enzyme were inhibited by two antibiotics, diumycin and moenomycin as shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that the activity was progressively inhibited by adding increasing amounts of either of these antibiotics to the incubation mixtures, and 50% inhibition by either antibiotic occurred at about 100 μg/ml. These two antibiotics were previously shown to inhibit the growth of M. smegmatis(18Pan Y.T. Elbein A.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 355: 258-266Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme (both native and recombinant) was stable to freezing and maintained its activity for at least several weeks when stored at −20 °C. The enzyme was also quite stable to heating as shown in Fig. 9. Thus, when the enzyme was placed in a hot water bath at various temperatures from 40 to 60 °C, there was little loss of activity for at least 6 min of heating. In fact, even at 70 °C, the enzyme retained significant activity for several minutes and then slowly lost activity. During the purification, we found that the crude extracts could be heated at 95 °C for 1 or 2 min, and in many cases most of the TPP activity was retained. However, this procedure was not completely reproducible from one extract to another, and therefore the heat step was used at 60 °C. Because the recombinant TPP was found mostly in the membrane fraction and required treatment with Sarkosyl for solubilization, we tested the effects of various detergents on enzyme activity. Fig. 10 presents the results obtained with a variety of detergents at increasing concentrations. It can be seen that the enzyme activity was rapidly lost in the presence of increasing concentrations of Sarkosyl or deoxycholate, and at 0.05% of these detergents there was almost complete loss of activity. On the other hand, detergents such as Nonidet P-40, Triton X-100, and octyl glucoside were relatively innocuous and even at 0.2–0.3% there was no loss of activity. We did use 0.2% Sarkosyl to solubilize the TPP in crude sonicates of the transfected E. coli cells, but the Sarkosyl was not in the buffer used to elute the TPP from the metal ion columns. This indicates that removal of that detergent results in restoration of activity. The gene for trehalose-P phosphatase from E. coli(otsB) has been mapped and located on the E. colichromosome (13Giaever H.M. Styrvold O.B. Kaasen I. Strom A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2841-2849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that gene was also identified in theArabidopsis thaliana genome by functional complementation of the yeast trehalose-P phosphatase (tps2) gene (19Muller J. Aeschbacher R.A. Wingler A. Boller T. Wiemken A. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1086-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). InE. coli, the gene for trehalose-P phosphatase (otsB) and the gene for trehalose-P synthase (otsA) constitute an operon in which otsB are proximal to the promoter, and otsA is distal (20Kaasen I. Falkenberg P. Styrvold O.B. Strom A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 889-898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the synthase and the phosphatase copurify as a complex and the individual enzymes have not been separated (21Bell W. Sun W. Hohmann S. Wera S. Reinders A. DeVirgillio C. Wiemken A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 33311-33319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This complex also contains several regulatory proteins that affect the activities of these two enzymes. In E. coli, TPS and TPP apparently do not exist as a complex because the two proteins could be expressed separately in an otsAB deletion mutant (14Hengge-Aronis R. Klein W. Lange R. Rimmele M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7792-7918Crossref Google Scholar). Despite the considerable amount of information on the genetics of the trehalose pathway in these organisms, very little is known about the structure of the protein that removes the phosphate from trehalose-P or the protein that synthesizes trehalose-P (TPS) in these organisms, nor is there much information on the specificity or other properties of these two enzymes. In this report, we describe the purification of the trehalose-P phosphatase (TPP) from M. smegmatis to near homogeneity and the identification of the complete amino acid sequence of this interesting protein. The translation start of the M. smegmatis TPP is unidentified. The purified polypeptide located closest to the predicted amino terminus starts at residue 11 (11ALTAVAATPHLLVTSDFDGT30), suggesting that the actual translation start was located between residues 1 and 11. CLUSTALW alignment of the M. smegmatis TPP predicted amino acid sequence with those of C. glutamicum and E. coli suggests that the most likely start codon was located at residue 8 (see Fig. 3). Almost 50% of the amino acids in the 27-kDa TPP are hydrophobic (i.e., 45 alanines, 7 Phe, 18 Gly, 7 Ile, 28 Leu, and 23 Val), but these amino acids are distributed throughout the protein sequence rather than occurring in specific domains. The hydrophobic nature of the protein may account for some of its unusual properties. For example, when E. coli cells transfected with the TPP gene were broken by sonication and the crude homogenate subjected to high speed centrifugation, most of the TPP activity was found in the pellet, i.e. membrane fraction. However, when 0.2% Sarkosyl was added to the crude homogenate, almost all of the TPP activity remained in the supernatant fraction. This protein is also quite resistant to heat denaturation. Thus, the protein could be heated at temperatures of up to 60 °C for 5 or 6 min with only a small loss in activity. This property suggests that the protein is tightly folded and fairly resistant to denaturation. Examination of the protein by circular dichroism also supports this hypothesis and indicates that the protein structure is largely in the β-pleated sheet and is very compact. Both TPP and TPS are inhibited by the glycoside antibiotics, moenomycin and diumycin. These antibiotics also inhibit the growth of M. smegmatis (18Pan Y.T. Elbein A.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 355: 258-266Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, because these compounds also inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis in some organisms, we cannot be certain that the inhibition of growth of mycobacteria is because of inhibition in the trehalose biosynthetic pathway. We are currently designing experiments to determine whether growth inhibition and inhibition of trehalose synthesis are directly related. We are also designing experiments to determine whether this trehalose biosynthetic pathway is essential to the viability of these organisms."

Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). The rules that govern the accurate pairing between tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been especially scrutinized in bacterial systems (reviewed in Refs. 2McClain W.H. J. Mol.

Biol. 1997; 7: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although the mode of tRNA binding differs from one synthetase to another, nucleotides from the acceptor stem, the anticodon stem-loop domain, and the dihydrouridine stem located in the inner, concave side of the L-shaped tRNA molecule generally provide the basis for cognate tRNA synthetase interaction. On particular occasions, a non-canonical appended domain of the synthetase makes contacts with outer regions of the convex side of tRNA. The coiled-coil domains appended at the N terminus of Thermus thermophilus SerRS, the N terminus of the α-subunit of T. thermophilus PheRS, or the C terminus of T. thermophilus ValRS interact with the variable arm and TΨC loop of tRNASer or with the dihydrouridine and TΨC loop of tRNAPhe or tRNAVal (6Biou V.

One of the major differences that characterizes aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases from higher eukaryotes (from Drosophila to human) as compared with their prokaryotic homologues is the presence of polypeptide chain extensions appended to the N or C terminus of the protein (13Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).

One of the components of the multi-synthetase complex, the protein p43, has the potential to bind tRNA non-specifically (18Quevillon S. Agou F. Robinson J.C. Mirande M. J. Biol.

The crystal structure of the C-terminal moiety of p43 identified a putative oligonucleotide binding-fold-based tRNA-binding site (21Renault L. Kerjan P. Pasqualato S. Menetrey J. Robinson J.C.

These supplementary tRNA binding modules appended to eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases decrease dissociation constants for their cognate tRNAs. Because of the scarcity of non-acylated tRNA in the cytoplasm of higher eukaryotic cells (discussed in Ref. 26Francin M. Kaminska M. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1762-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), these tIFs are thought to be required for tRNA cycling during translation (27Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7158-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that native mammalian LysRS has the ability to form a stable tRNA-protein complex with human tRNA3Lys, whereas a N-terminally truncated derivative has lost this property (26Francin M. Kaminska M. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1762-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The presence of this extension decreases the K d and K mvalues for tRNA and therefore should facilitate tRNA aminoacylation under the conditions of the suboptimal tRNA concentration prevailingin vivo. These in vitro data provided a rational explanation to the phenotype of growth retardation observed for yeast cells that express an allele of the yeast KRS1 gene with a deletion of its eukaryotic-specific N-terminal extension (28Martinez R. Mirande M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Other studies have also involved human LysRS as the possible vector of tRNA3Lys for packaging into the HIV viral particles. In retroviruses, the initiation of reverse transcription is primed by a cellular tRNA that is selectively encapsidated into the virion. In the case of HIV-I, the primer tRNA is tRNA3Lys. It forms an extended network of template/primer interactions with the viral primer-binding site but also with viral sequences located upstream of the primer-binding site (29Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Accordingly, tRNA3Lys is efficiently packaged into HIV-1 viral particles, albeit not selectively (30Jiang M. Mak J. Ladha A. Cohen E. Klein M. Rovinski B. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3246-3253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other major tRNA species is tRNA1,2Lys. Primer/template annealing is not responsible for incorporation of tRNALys into the virion, which suggested that a viral protein may be involved in selection of the primer tRNA for packaging (31Mak J. Jiang M. Wainberg M.A. Hammarskjöld M.L. Rekosh D. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2065-2072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data have shown that LysRS or a proteolytically truncated derivative is selectively packaged in HIV-1 viral particles and may thus be the carrier of tRNALys (32Cen S. Khorchid A. Javanbakht H. Gabor J. Stello T. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To understand the role of the eukaryotic-specific N-domain of LysRS in tRNA cycling in translation and thereby in tRNA capture into the HIV-1 viral particle, we wanted to determine the molecular basis for the potent tRNA binding properties of mammalian LysRS. To evaluate the contribution of the many lysine residues present in the tIF of LysRS, we determined the kinetic and tRNA binding capacities of a series of LysRS mutants with single lysine to alanine changes. We eventually delineated the residues that contribute to the function of the eukaryotic-specific tIF of class-II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Plasmid pYeDP10/CKRS (2μ, URA3) contains the wild-type hamster LysRS cDNA expressed under the control of the PGK promoter (33Agou F. Quevillon S. Kerjan P. Latreille M.T. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15322-15331Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The lysine-rich region of the N-domain of LysRS, from Met-1 to Lys-40, is encoded by aBglII-SacI fragment of 135 nucleotides. The 13 lysine or arginine codons encoding residues at positions 8, 10, 16, 19, 23, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 35, 38, and 40 were substituted with GCU codons corresponding to the major tRNAAla species in yeast, tRNA1Ala. After removal of the wild-typeBglII-SacI fragment, cDNAs carrying a single one of these mutations were constructed by assembling six overlapping oligonucleotides. The ligation mixture was used to transformEscherichia coli HB101 cells. The sequence of the constructs was checked by DNA sequencing. The diploid yeast strain CCdYK01 (his3/his3,leu2/leu2, ura3/ura3,trp1/trp1,KRS1/krs1::TRP1) (33Agou F. Quevillon S. Kerjan P. Latreille M.T. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15322-15331Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was transformed to Ura+ with plasmid pYeDP10 encoding the various hamster LysRS mutants by the lithium chloride method (34Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sporulation of diploid cells in the nitrogen-deficient starvation medium (1% potassium acetate, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.05% dextrose) and random spore analysis were performed according to standard procedures (35Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (2000) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Briefly, sporulated cells were incubated overnight at 28 °C with lyticase at 750 units/ml (Sigma) supplemented with 1.5% IGEPAL (Sigma), incubated for 15 min on ice, and subjected to sonication (2-fold, 30 s) to release spores from their asci. After washing and resuspension in H2O, spore colonies were grown on selective medium. Haploid cells Trp+ and Ura+ in phenotype were selected and then analyzed by Western blotting for the lack of the endogenous yeast LysRS and the presence of plasmid-encoded hamster LysRS as described (33Agou F. Quevillon S. Kerjan P. Latreille M.T. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15322-15331Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant LysRS was expressed in yeast and purified according to a purification scheme adapted from Ref. 33Agou F. Quevillon S. Kerjan P. Latreille M.T. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15322-15331Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar. All purification steps were conducted at 4 °C with a BioCAD work station (Applied Biosystems) except where otherwise stated. Briefly, recombinant yeast cells were grown at 28 °C in 1.5 liters of YPG medium (0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% Bacto Peptone, and 3% glucose) to anA 600 of 8. Cells were washed, resuspended in extraction buffer (1 ml/g of cells), and lysed in an Eaton press. After a 2-fold dilution with extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml chymostatine, and 2 μg/ml antipaine), cell debris were removed by centrifugation. Nucleic acids were removed by precipitation with Polymin P at 0.2%, and the clear supernatant was applied to a 50 ml S-Sepharose FF column (Amersham Biosciences). LysRS was eluted by a linear gradient (20-column volume) of potassium phosphate from 50 to 300 mm(pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Fractions containing LysRS were dialyzed (30 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol), applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and washed with 5-column volumes of the same buffer containing protease inhibitors (5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml chymostatine, and 2 μg/ml antipaine), and eluted at room temperature by a linear gradient (40-column volume) of potassium phosphate from 50 to 150 mm. Fractions containing LysRS were dialyzed against 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 55% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C at a protein concentration of ∼2–10 mg/ml. The N-terminally truncated derivative (LysRS-ΔN) was obtained by elastase treatment of the native enzyme (36Cirakoglu B. Waller J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The N-terminal polypeptide extension of LysRS (N-LysRS) was expressed in E. coli and purified as described (26Francin M. Kaminska M. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1762-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by using calculated absorption coefficients of 0.547 and 0.600 A 280 units × mg−1 × cm2, respectively for LysRS (and LysRS mutants) and LysRS-ΔN. Plasmids ptRNA3Lys and pAcctRNA3Lys (26Francin M. Kaminska M. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1762-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) were linearized withFokI and BstNI, respectively, and subjected toin vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase purified from the strain BL21/pAR1219 generously provided by Prof. W. Studier (Brookhaven National Laboratory). 32P-labeled tRNAs were synthesized in a reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 1 μg of template DNA, 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mmspermidine, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mm each CTP, UTP, and GTP, 10 μm[α-32P]ATP (200 Ci/mmol), and 50 units of T7 RNA polymerase. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the transcripts were purified by electrophoresis on a denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel (mono/bis, 19:1), recovered from the gel by soaking in H2O, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in H2O. The RNA transcripts were renatured by heating at 90 °C for 2 min and cooling at room temperature for 20 min in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2. Protein-RNA interactions were analyzed using a band shift assay. Homogeneous wild-type LysRS and LysRS mutants were incubated at increasing concentrations with radiolabeled RNA (25,000 cpm per point) in a 11-μl volume containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and bovine serum albumin at 0.1 mg/ml. After incubation at 25 °C for 20 min, the mixture was placed on ice and loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel (mono/bis, 29:1) containing 5% glycerol in 0.5× TBE, pH 8.0, at 4 °C. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Free and bound tRNA was quantified by densitometry measurements. For aminoacylation assays, human tRNA3Lys was produced in E. coli JM101Tr transformed with the plasmid pBSTK3 (37Tisné C. Rigourd M. Marquet R. Ehresmann C. Dardel F. RNA. 2000; 6: 1403-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 1.5 liters of 2× tryptone/yeast extract medium supplemented with ampicillin. Total tRNA fraction (500 A 260units; 300 pmol tRNA3Lys/A 260unit) was prepared as described by Meinnel et al. (38Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4741-4746Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and tRNA3Lys was partially purified on a SOURCE 15Q column (160 A 260 units; 600 pmol tRNA3Lys/A 260unit). Initial rates of tRNA aminoacylation were measured at 25 °C in 0.1 ml of 20 mmimidazole-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 180 μm14C-labeled lysine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 16.66 Ci/mol) and saturating amounts of tRNA (26Francin M. Kaminska M. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1762-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Human tRNA3Lys expressed in E. coli (lysine acceptance of 600 pmol/A 260) was used as tRNA substrate. The incubation mixture contained catalytic amounts (1–2 nm) of enzymes appropriately diluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol containing bovine serum albumin at 4 mg/ml. One unit of activity is the amount of enzyme producing 1 nmol of lysine-tRNALys/min at 25 °C. For the determination of K m values for tRNA, tRNALys concentrations of 0.2–50 μm were used. Michaelian parameters were obtained by non-linear regression of the theoretical Michaelis-Menten equation to the experimental curve using the KaleidaGraph 3.0.8 software (Abelbeck Software). The isotopic [32P]PPi-ATP exchange reaction was conducted as described previously (39Lazard M. Kerjan P. Agou F. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained, in a final volume of 0.1 ml, 20 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm each of ATP, [32P]pyrophosphate (2.5 Ci/mol), and lysine. The reaction was started by the addition of limiting amounts of enzymes (4 nm) appropriately diluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol and bovine serum albumin at 4 mg/ml. After 10 min at 25 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2.5 ml of a solution containing 100 mm pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 0.35% perchloric acid, and 0.4% Norit. Samples were filtered through Whatmann no. 1 filters, washed extensively with water, and counted in a liquid scintillator. A unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to form 1 nmol of [32P]ATP/min. For the determination of kinetic parameters in the PPi-ATP exchange reaction, the concentration of ATP in the assay was varied from 25 μm to 5 mm, and that of lysine was varied from 10 μm to 2 mm. Michaelian parameters were deduced as described above. Mammalian LysRS is a dimer of 2 × 68 kDa. An N-terminal deletion of 50 amino acid residues removes the eukaryotic-specific appended domain and results in a dimer of 2 × 62 kDa. This polypeptide extension precedes helix H1 from the anticodon-binding domain of bacterial LysRS (Fig. 1). The truncated derivative of LysRS, LysRS-ΔN, displayed a 50-fold lower apparent affinity for tRNA3Lys and a 4-fold increase inK m for tRNA3Lys in the aminoacylation reaction, as compared with the native enzyme (26Francin M. Kaminska M. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1762-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To ascertain that the removal of the N-domain of LysRS did not perturb the catalytic center of the enzyme, kinetic parameters for lysine and ATP in the ATP-PPi exchange reaction were determined. TheK m values of the wild-type and N-terminally truncated LysRS for ATP (384 ± 20 and 371 ± 12 μm) and lysine (157 ± 9 and 152 ± 7 μm) and their k cat values of ATP formation (26 ± 1 and 27 ± 2 s−1) were identical. This result extends our earlier observation showing that LysRS and LysRS-ΔN also display identical kinetic parameters for ATP and lysine in the tRNALys aminoacylation reaction (26Francin M. Kaminska M. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1762-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that interactions between tRNA and the N-domain of LysRS are essentially nonspecific; similar band shifts have been observed with cognate or noncognate tRNAs. This result has suggested that the formation of RNA-protein complexes involves electrostatic interactions between side chains of basic amino acid residues from the N-domain of LysRS and the tRNA phosphate-sugar backbone. In the N-domain of hamster LysRS, 12 lysine or 2 arginine residues are located between positions 8 to 45 (Fig. 1) and are good candidates for building the RNA-protein interface. Because no structural data is available for this domain, we sought to identify positions in this RNA binding motif that would influence its function. For this purpose, we performed systematic substitution of these basic residues with alanines. These substitutions were K8A, K10A, K16A, K19A, K23A, R24A, R25A, K27A, K30A, K31A, K35A, K38A, and K40A. Incorporation of additional sequences such as a His-tag in LysRS impairs its catalytic parameters (26Francin M. Kaminska M. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1762-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, wild-type and mutant LysRS were isolated by standard chromatography procedures. Proteins were expressed in yeast from a multicopy plasmid (2 μ, URA3) that encoded each of the cDNAs under the control of a phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter. The endogenous yeast LysRS possesses an N-domain related to that of the hamster enzyme (Fig. 1) and efficiently aminoacylates mammalian tRNALys. We showed that expression of hamster LysRS in S. cerevisiae functionally replaces a null allele of the yeast KRS1 gene (33Agou F. Quevillon S. Kerjan P. Latreille M.T. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15322-15331Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, wild-type and mutant LysRS were expressed in yeast in a null background. The diploid yeast strain CCdYK01 (KRS1/krs1::TRP1) (33Agou F. Quevillon S. Kerjan P. Latreille M.T. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15322-15331Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was transformed with plasmids encoding the various hamster LysRSs. After sporulation and random spore analysis, haploid strains (Trp+ and Ura+ in phenotype) bearing a disrupted yeast KRS1 chromosomal allele and rescued by plasmid-encoded hamster LysRSs were selected. The expression of the mammalian enzymes and the lack of the yeast enzyme in these strains was verified by Western blot analysis using antibodies directed to the mammalian or yeast LysRS (result not shown). This observation already showed that the 13 LysRS variants are functional and are able to rescue yeast cells lacking endogenous LysRS. Wild-type and mutant LysRS were purified to homogeneity using a standardized isolation scheme on S-Sepharose and Mono-Q columns. The binding of wild-type LysRS on S-Sepharose essentially rests on its N-domain; it is eluted at a potassium phosphate concentration of 140 mm, whereas LysRS-ΔN does not bind at a salt concentration of 25 mm. Among the different mutants, the six LysRS derivatives, K16A, K19A, K23A, R24A, K27A, and K31A, were eluted early in the gradient (95–110 mm), whereas other mutants were eluted at salt concentrations ranging from 120 to 140 mm. This observation suggested that the six lysine residues listed above are especially exposed to the solvent and are good candidates for interacting with tRNA. Because the N-domain of LysRS is a key element to tRNA binding, its removal is accompanied by a 3-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) in the aminoacylation reaction of tRNA3Lys, resulting essentially from a 4-fold increase in K m(Table I). The change in kinetic parameters for tRNA3Lys aminoacylation triggered by the 13 mutant enzymes was investigated. Partially purified human tRNA3Lys (lysine acceptance of 600 pmol/A 260) expressed in E. coli was used to determine the steady-state kinetic parameters in the aminoacylation reaction. Whereas all mutant enzymes exhibited similark cat values of Lys-tRNALys formation comprised between 3.76 and 4.83 s−1 as compared with 4.85 s−1 for wild-type, moderate but reliable variations of theK m values for tRNA3Lys were determined (Table I). Mutant K23A had a K m value that increased more than 3-fold as compared with wild-type. Thus, it is worth noting that the single mutation of lysine-23 into alanine induced kinetic changes comparable with that observed for a complete deletion of the N-domain. Similarly, the four single mutants K19A, R24A, R25A, and K27A also displayed a significant increase in K m(2.1–3.6-fold). Conversely, the K m andk cat values for the eight other mutants (lysine into alanine at positions 8, 10, 16, 30, 31, 35, 38, or 40) were not significantly affected. These results suggested that the tRNA binding motif of the tIF of LysRS may be built around the conserved basic residues located between positions 19 to 27 (Fig. 1).Table IKinetic constants of wild-type and mutant LysRS in tRNA3Lys aminoacylationLysRS1-aStandard errors were determined from at least two independent data sets.K m(tRNA3Lys)1-btRNA3Lys acceptance of 600 pmol/A 260.k catk cat/K mμms −1s −1 μm −1Wild-type1.70 ± 0.08 (1.00)1-cRelative values.4.85 ± 0.152.85K8A1.45 ± 0.08 (0.85)3.80 ± 0.102.62K10A1.62 ± 0.15 (0.95)4.06 ± 0.232.51K16A2.05 ± 0.17 (1.21)4.05 ± 0.201.98K19A3.91 ± 0.21 (2.30)3.87 ± 0.150.99K23A6.32 ± 0.47 (3.72)4.63 ± 0.270.73R24A6.06 ± 0.51 (3.56)4.83 ± 0.350.79R25A3.78 ± 0.31 ("

We show here that the 5′ stem-loop of collagen α1(I) mRNA is inhibitory to translationin vitro. The sequence 5′ to the translation initiation codon, as a part of the 5′ stem-loop, is also not efficient in initiating translation under competitive conditions. This suggests that collagen α1(I) mRNA may not be a good substrate for translation. Since the 5′ stem-loop binds protein factors in collagen-producing cells, this binding may regulate its translation in vivo. We studied in vivo translation of collagen α1(I) mRNA after transfecting collagen α1(I) genes with and without the 5′ stem-loop into Mov 13 fibroblasts. The mRNA with the α1(I) 5′ stem-loop was translated into pepsin-resistant collagen, which was secreted into the cellular medium. This mRNA also produced more disulfide-bonded high molecular weight collagen found intracellularly. The mRNA in which the 5′ stem-loop was mutated, but without affecting the coding region of the gene, was translated into pepsin-sensitive collagen and produced only trace amounts of disulfide-bonded collagen. This suggests that the 5′ stem-loop is required for proper folding or stabilization of the collagen triple helix. To our knowledge this is the first example that an RNA element located in the 5′-untranslated region is involved in synthesis of a secreted multisubunit protein. We suggest that 5′ stem-loop, with its cognate binding proteins, targets collagen mRNAs for coordinate translation and couples translation apparatus to the rest of the collagen biosynthetic pathway.

Riecken E.O. Stein H. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 59-70PubMed Google Scholar). In the 5′-UTR1of these mRNAs there is a stem loop structure (5′ stem-loop) encompassing the translation initiation codon (3Yamada Y. Mudryj M. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14914-14919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ stem-loop is located about 75 nt from the cap and has a stability of ΔG = 25–30 kcal/mol. The 5′ stem-loop is well conserved in evolution, differing by only two nucleotides inXenopus and human collagen mRNAs (4Su M.W. Suzuki H.R. Bieker J.J. Solursh M. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The sequence flanking the 5′ stem-loop is not conserved. A similar stem-loop structure is also found around the translation start codon of the sea urchin collagen gene (5D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. Suzuki H.R. Solursh M. Gambino R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7050-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evolutionary conservation of this sequence suggests an important function. We analyzed previously a regulatory role of the 5′ stem-loop in two experimental systems; quiescent versus activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) (6Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4334-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and fibroblasts cultured in a three-dimensional matrix (7Stefanovic B. Lindquist J. Brenner D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 641-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activated HSCs are responsible for excessive collagen production in liver fibrosis (8Friedman S.L. Prog. Liver Dis. 1996; 14: 101-130PubMed Google Scholar, 9Knittel T. Kobold D. Saile B. Grundmann A. Neubauer K. Piscaglia F. Ramadori G. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 1205-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We found that the 5′ stem-loop prevented expression of the reporter genes in quiescent HSCs, which express low amounts of type I collagen, but allowed for expression in activated HSCs. This inhibitory effect of the 5′ stem-loop was in part mediated by a decreased half-life of the corresponding mRNAs. Reporter genes with the mutated 5′ stem-loop were constitutively expressed to a high level in both cell types. Therefore, expression of the reporter mRNA with the 5′ stem-loop resembles expression of endogenous collagen α1(I) mRNA in HSCs; it is low in quiescent HSCs and elevated in activated HSCs and regulated by a post-transcriptional mechanism (6Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4334-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, we studied the role of the 5′ stem-loop on collagen α1(I) mRNA expression in fibroblasts cultured in a three-dimensional matrix where the fibroblasts revert from an activated phenotype to a more quiescent phenotype. This is accompanied by destabilization of endogenous collagen α1(I) mRNA (10Eckes B. Mauch C. Huppe G. Krieg T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The reporter collagen α1(I) mRNA with the intact 5′ stem-loop was less stable than the identical mRNA with the mutated 5′ stem-loop in the cells grown in the matrix. Thus, the 5′ stem-loop is required for accelerated decay of collagen α1(I) mRNA in cells that down-regulate collagen synthesis (7Stefanovic B. Lindquist J. Brenner D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 641-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the 5′ stem-loop targets mRNAs for turnover in HSCs and fibroblasts grown in a three-dimensional matrix is unknown. In quiescent HSCs we could not detect any protein binding to the 5′ stem-loop in vitro. In activated HSCs a cytosolic protein factor(s) of unknown identity binds to the stem-loop and requires a 7mG cap on the RNA for binding (6Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4334-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An excess of cap analogue completely prevents formation of this complex in vitro. The complex is also found in fibroblasts in postpolysomal cytoplasmic fraction. Its binding is greatly reduced if the cells are cultured in a three-dimensional matrix (7Stefanovic B. Lindquist J. Brenner D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 641-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One possibility is that the 5′ stem-loop binding activity may increase the steady-state level of collagen mRNAs by diverting them from the degradative pathway (11Lindquist J.N. Marzluff W.F. Stefanovic B. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2000; 279: G471-G476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Translation and mRNA decay are coupled processes (12Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, studies on the translation of collagen α1(I) mRNA are required to provide insight into the mechanism of stabilization of this mRNA. All collagen α1(I) mRNA is associated with membrane-bound polysomes and is not found on free polysomes or in postpolysomal supernatant. 2B. Stefanovic and D. Brenner, unpublished results. It is not known if this association is because of targeting of the mRNA or targeting by the leader peptide after initiation of translation. Collagens are secreted proteins, and their translation is coupled to export of the peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (13Kivirikko K.I. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 355-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). There is substantial evidence that all three peptides initiate folding into the heterotrimer while still associated with polysomes on the endoplasmic reticulum (14Beck K. Boswell B.A. Ridgway C.C. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21566-21573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Kirk T.Z. Evans J.S. Veis A. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). When folding is initiated, the collagen trimer is released in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. In human disease osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) certain mutations of α1(I) chain decrease the rate of assembly of collagen type I. Unassembled OI α1(I) chains are hypermodified on proline and lysine residues and degraded (18Tajima S. Takehana M. Azuma N. J. Dermatol. 1994; 21: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Fitzgerald J. Lamande S.R. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27392-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This suggests that modification and assembly processes are in a kinetic equilibrium. It is possible that the 5′ stem-loop binding activity may target collagen mRNAs to translation at such sites. In this study we investigate the role of the 5′ stem-loop in translation of collagen α1(I) mRNA in vitro andin vivo. We found that the 5′ stem-loop inhibits translationin vitro and when more than one mRNA is competing for a limited amount of translational apparatus. In fibroblasts in vivo, the 5′ stem-loop is necessary for efficient folding or synthesis of stable triple helical collagen. To our knowledge this is the first example of an RNA element that affects protein folding. Plasmid used for in vitrotranscription of PSII mRNA was constructed by cloning of the double-stranded oligonucleotide with the sequence shown in Fig. 1 B into HindIII and NarI sites of the pGL3 vector (Promega). Then, the double-stranded oligonucleotide with the sequence of the T7 promoter was cloned intoBglII-HindIII sites of the above construct. This plasmid was linearized with HpaI and transcribed in vitro with T7 polymerase and Cap-scribe kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to produce capped PSII mRNA. COLL-START and COLL-OPTSTART constructs were made by cloning double-stranded oligonucleotides with the sequence shown in Fig. 1 B intoSacI-NarI sites of pGL3 and recloning of theEcoRI-HpaI fragment intoEcoRI-SmaI sites of the pGEM3 vector (Promega). After linearization with BamHI corresponding capped mRNAs were synthesized with T7 polymerase and the Cap-scribe kit. Plasmids for synthesis of the 5′ WT-SL and 5′ MUT-SL mRNAs were made by cloning of double-stranded oligonucleotides with the sequence shown in Fig. 2 A into the HindIII-NarI site of the pGL3 vector and cloning of the T7 promoter as for PSII. Capped mRNAs were made as described for PSII mRNA. The clone producing competitor A mRNA was made by cloning 75 codons of an artificial protein into EcoRI-XhoI sites of the vector pCDNA3 (Stratagene), followed by cloning of an optimal translation start site (Fig. 1 B) to allow expression. This plasmid was linearized with NotI, and competitor A mRNA was made as for PSII mRNA. All in vitro produced mRNAs were gel-purified and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. β-globin mRNA and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) mRNA were prepared from the Roche Molecular Biochemicals in vitro translation kit.Figure 2Inhibitory effect of the 5′ stem-loop on translation in vitro.

Breindl) into BglII-XbaI sites of the pGL3 vector and inserting into the above construct theXbaI-BamHI fragment of human collagen α1(I) cDNA (a kind gift from F. Ramirez). This restores the 5′ stem-loop, which is identical in mouse and human collagen α1(I) mRNA and includes the entire coding region and 3′-UTR of human collagen α1(I) cDNA. The 5′ MUT-MH-COLL gene was made identically except that a substitution of 18 nt, shown in Fig. 2 A, was introduced into the mouse genomic clone before reconstituting the full-size construct. A riboprobe for analyzing expression from MH-COLL genes was made by cloning the XbaI-KpnI fragment of human cDNA clone into XbaI-KpnI of Bluscript SK vector (Invitrogen). This plasmid was linearized by NotI and transcribed by T7 polymerase in the presence of [32P]UTP as described (20Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Brenner D.A. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1995; 33: 212-214PubMed Google Scholar). 0.08 pmol of gel-purified mRNAs was translated in a 50-μl reaction using nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions. In preliminary experiments 0.08 pmol of mRNA was found to be a nonsaturation concentration of mRNA for a 50-μl reaction. Competitor mRNA was added in 10-fold molar excess (0.8 pmol) to the test mRNA prior to mixing with the lysate. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature when a 5-μl aliquot was analyzed for luciferase activity. Incubations longer than 30 min did not further increase luciferase activity. For the same test mRNA preparation the reaction was done with and without competitor, and the ratio of luciferase activity was normalized to that of PSII mRNA. All experiments were done with two different mRNA preparations, each done in duplicate. Transient transfections were done with the calcium phosphate technique using 10 μg of corresponding MH-COLL plasmids. 24 h after transfection, equal number of cells were split into two dishes and incubation continued for an additional 24 h. The cells were then incubated in 0.2% serum for 24 h and either treated with 4 ng/ml of TGFβ1 (R&D Systems) or left untreated for an additional 24 h. Cells and cellular medium were collected and analyzed by RNase protection assay or Western blot. Stably transfected Mov 13 fibroblasts were developed by transfection of MH-COLL genes and pCDNA3 vector in a ratio of 10:1 and selection with G418 for 3 weeks. G418-resistant cells were pooled and processed as above. 50 μg of cellular proteins were run on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing or nonreducing conditions, as indicated. 100 ng of purified rat tail collagen type I (Collaborative Biomedical Products) was included as control. After transfer, the blots were probed with 1:1000 dilution of anti-collagen type I antibody (600-401-103, Rockland) and developed using the ECL system (AmershamBiosciences). Cellular medium was concentrated on Centricon 100 columns (Amicon), and equivalent amounts (corresponding to 4 × 105 cells) were analyzed by Western blot as above. For pepsin digestions, 40 μl of concentrated medium was adjusted to pH 2.5 with acetic acid and digested with 1 μl of 64,000 units/ml of pepsin (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. After neutralization, the samples were analyzed by Western blot. For collagenase digestion, 1 μl of 4 units/ml of bacterial collagenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to 40 μl of concentrated medium and digested for 30 min at room temperature. 50 μg of total cell RNA was simultaneously hybridized with collagen-specific riboprobe and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific riboprobe (Ambion), as previously described (20Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Brenner D.A. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1995; 33: 212-214PubMed Google Scholar). The collagen-specific band has an expected size of 145 nt, and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific band has an expected size of 120 nt. Fig. 1 Ashows the sequence of the 5′ stem-loop of mouse collagen α1(I) mRNA. To the right is shown the consensus 5′ stem-loop sequence, which can be derived from α1(I), α2(I), and α1(III) mRNAs of evolutionary distant organisms (ranging from fish to humans). Since the sequence around the collagen α1(I) mRNA start codon, as a part of the 5′ stem-loop, does not match the consensus sequence derived by Kozak (22Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 23Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar), one set of mRNAs was constructed to investigate how the sequence of collagen α1(I) mRNA immediately 5′ to the start codon affects translation. Therefore, we constructed a reporter mRNA containing only the last 25 nt of the mouse collagen α1(I) 5′ stem-loop linked in-frame with a luciferase mRNA (COLL START, Fig. 1 B). In this construct the 5′ stem-loop cannot form because its 5′-region was deleted, but it contains the collagen α1(I) start codon in its natural sequence context. Control mRNAs had a short 5′-UTR of 35–36 nt without any structural elements or short upstream open reading frames (uORF) (PSII and COLL-OPTSTART, Fig. 1 B). The COLL-OPTSTART differs from the COLL-START mRNA by 9 nt preceding the start codon, which were optimized to conform to the Kozak rules, while in COLL-START they were from mouse collagen α1(I) mRNA. PSII mRNA had a 5′-UTR derived from the pGL3 vector, which is optimized for efficient translation and was used as control. 3′ to the start codon all constructs had the rest of the sequence of the 5′ stem-loop (underlined in Fig. 1 B), followed by the luciferase ORF. The mRNAs were madein vitro with 7mG cap, and their integrity was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 C). These mRNAs did not contain a poly(A) tail, because of the small effect that the poly(A) tail has on translation in vitro (21Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). These test mRNAs were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate with or without of 10-fold molar excess of a competitor mRNA. The competitor mRNA had the optimal start site followed by an ORF of 75 amino acids (competitor A). The sequence of the 5′-UTR of competitor A is shown in Fig. 1 B (COMP A). Without competitor A all three test mRNAs yielded similar amounts of the luciferase protein. However, in the presence of a 10-fold amount of competitor A the efficiency of translation was reduced 5-fold for PSII mRNA, 19-fold for COLL-START mRNA, and 8.4-fold for COLL-OPTSTART mRNA. In Fig. 1 D this result is shown normalized to the inhibition of PSII mRNA. Because the highest inhibition was observed when the collagen α1(I) sequence preceded the start codon (COLL-START), we concluded that this sequence is suboptimal in promoting translation initiation when competing with another mRNA for the translation machinery. Another set of reporter mRNAs was designed to address the role of the 5′ stem-loop in translation. 5′ WT-SL reporter contained 63 nt of the mouse collagen α1(I) 5′-UTR with the 5′ stem-loop in-frame with LUC, while the 5′ MUT-SL reporter had substitutions in the 5′ stem-loop to abolish its formation (Fig. 2 A). Translation of these reporters was compared in vitro to the PSII mRNA (described above) without competitor mRNA or under competitive conditions. The integrity of the mRNAs is shown in Fig. 2 B. Without competitor, the 5′ WT-SL mRNA was translated about 3-fold less efficiently than PSII (arbitrarily set as 1) and 5′ SL-MUT mRNAs. The latter two were translated with comparative efficiency (Fig. 2 C). This was not due to preferential degradation of the 5′ WT-SL mRNA in the lysate, because extraction of the RNAs from the lysate after a 1-h incubation and retranslation in fresh lysate yielded the same result (not shown). Next we compared translational efficiency of the 5′ WT-SL mRNA and 5′ MUT-SL mRNA to PSII mRNA in the presence of 10-fold molar excess of competitor mRNAs. Three competitor mRNAs were added in 10-fold molar excess to the reaction, competitor A (described above), β-globin mRNA, and TMV. With competitor A 5′ WT-SL reporter mRNA was translated about 30-fold less efficiently, when compared with PSII mRNA. 5′ MUT-SL mRNA was translated only 5.5-fold less efficiently relative to PSII mRNA (Fig. 2 D). When β-globin mRNA was used as competitor the respective ratios were 4.6- and 3.6-fold (Fig. 2 E). When viral RNA was used as a competitor the translation of 5′ WT-SL and PSII mRNAs was not affected, while translation of the 5′MUT-SL mRNA was increased 2-fold (Fig. 2 F). Based on the results in Fig. 2, we concluded that the 5′ stem-loop is inhibitory for translationin vitro in the absence of a competitor mRNA, while various competitor mRNAs have either a strong inhibitory effect or show only a small effect. We analyzed if reticulocyte lysates contain the 5′ stem-loop binding activity by performing gel mobility shift analysis using capped 5′ stem-loop RNA or inverted 5′ stem-loop RNA as probes, as described (6Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4334-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We could not detect specific binding to the 5′ stem-loop (data not shown). Mov 13 fibroblasts were derived from mice in which insertion of a retrovirus into the first intron of collagen α1(I) gene had inactivated the transcription of this gene (24Hartung S. Jaenisch R. Breindl M. Nature. 1986; 320: 365-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mov 13 fibroblasts transcribe the α2(I) gene and thus provide a unique opportunity to study translation of collagen type I mRNAs and assembly of the collagen trimer when the α1(I) mRNA is encoded by various transgenes. Fig. 3 shows characterization of Mov 13 fibroblasts. No collagen α1(I) polypeptides can be detected by Western blot among cellular proteins of Mov 13 fibroblasts (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). For comparison, cellular proteins of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and purified collagen from rat tail were analyzed in lanes 3 and2, respectively. Pro-α1(I) (about 175 kDa) and α1(I) (about 120 kDa) peptides were seen in the NIH 3T3 sample. The antibody used did not detect the α2(I) chain. The α1(I) monomer and higher molecular weight cross-links of type I collagen are seen in the rat tail sample, which served as markers. To assess the role of the 5′ stem-loop in collagen type I synthesisin vivo we constructed two genes. One gene contained 220 nt of the promoter of the mouse collagen α1(I) gene followed by the mouse collagen 5′-UTR including the 5′ stem-loop, ligated to the full-size human collagen α1(I) cDNA (5′ WT-MH-COLL, Fig. 3 B). The gene has an open reading frame encoding a full-size human collagen pro-α1(I) polypeptide. The other gene is identical, except it has an 18-nt mutation within the 5′ stem-loop, which destroys its formation (5′ MUT-MH-COLL). This mutation does not affect the coding region of the gene, it encodes for the identical polypeptide as the 5′ WT-MH-COLL gene. The genes were transiently transfected into Mov 13 fibroblasts and mRNA analyzed by RNase protection assay (Fig. 3 C). Untransfected Mov 13 fibroblasts show no expression of collagen α1(I) mRNA. Transfected cells show high level of mRNAs transcribed from both transgenes, enabling us to study how collagen mRNAs with the 5′ stem-loop and without it are translated in vivo. First, we measured the intracellular steady-state levels of collagen polypeptides by Western blot after transient transfections of 5′ WT-MH-COLL and 5′ MUT-MH-COLL genes into Mov 13 cells (Fig. 4 A). We also treated the cells with 4 ng/ml of active TGFβ1, to assess how this profibrogenic cytokine (25Hellerbrand C. Stefanovic B. Giordano F. Burchardt E.R. Brenner D.A. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 77-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 26Phillips C.L. Tajima S. Pinnell S.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) would affect the expression. The blot was done under nonreducing conditions to assess the synthesis of disulfide-bonded collagen species. The major collagen detected was the pro-α1(I) chain, and both genes synthesized a similar level of the peptide. Its steady-state level was unaffected by TGFβ. However, the 5′ WT-MH-COLL gene yielded some of the disulfide-linked higher molecular weight collagen species (HMW COLL), while the 5′MUT-MH-COLL gene did not (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1and 2 to lanes 3 and 4). We could not distinguish, with our antibody, whether these species were homo or hetero multimers of type I collagen, although these collagen moieties comigrated with the collagen species found in rat tail type I collagen (lane 5). The result suggested that the 5′ stem-loop, although an RNA element, is involved in more efficient formation of disulfide-bonded collagen monomers, suggesting better registration of collagen chains. This prompted us to investigate if the collagen synthesized by 5′ WT-MH-COLL mRNA is more efficiently secreted into the cellular medium. We collected the cell medium and analyzed the equivalent amounts by Western blot under reducing conditions. Very little of pro-α1(I) polypeptide (175 kDa) was secreted out of nonstimulated cells and in the same amount for 5′ WT-MH-COLL and 5′MUT-MH-COLL genes (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2and 4). Only tracing amounts were processed to mature α1(I) chain of about 120 kDa. With TGFβ1 stimulation a much higher amount of pro-α1(I) chain was found in the cellular medium, but both genes produced similar amount of the protein (lanes 3 and5). Since there was no change in mRNA level with TGFβ1 stimulation (not shown), we concluded that TGFβ1-stimulated translation or secretion of type I collagen independent of the 5′ stem-loop. Alternatively, TGFβ may have decreased extracellular degradation of collagen. In stably transfected Mov 13 fibroblasts TGFβ1 also stimulated extracellular accumulation of collagen, but no difference between the 5′ WT-MH-COLL and 5′MUT-MH-COLL genes was seen (Fig. 4 C). Next, we probed the structure of secreted collagen from Mov 13 fibroblasts by digestion of cellular medium with pepsin and collagenase. We used the medium of cells treated with TGFβ1, because it contained the higher amount of collagen that facilitated the analysis. The medium was subjected to digestion with pepsin and collagenase as described under “Material and Methods” and analyzed by Western blot. In undigested medium under reducing conditions, the predominant collagen species was the pro-α1(I) chain (Fig. 5 A, lane 1). When the medium of cells expressing the 5′ WT-MH-COLL gene was digested with pepsin the molecular mass of this chain was reduced to about 120 kDa (lane 2). This suggests cleavage of the globular domains, but folding of the core domain into pepsin-resistant triple helix. When the medium was digested with bacterial collagenase, no collagen peptides could be detected, suggesting the specificity of the bands (lane 3). Thus, mRNA with the 5′ stem-loop directs synthesis of triple helical collagen, which accumulated in the cell medium. When the medium of 5′ MUT-MH-COLL-expressing cells was digested with pepsin no pepsin-resistant fragment was obtained (lane 5), although the amount of collagen secreted was comparable to that of the 5′ WT-MN-COLL gene (lane 4). Thus, mRNA without the 5′ stem-loop directs synthesis of structurally aberrant collagen that could not resist limited pepsin digestion. Digestion with collagenase served as the specificity control (lane 6). The result obtained with the medium from stably transfected Mov 13 cells is shown in Fig. 5 B. Again, the 5′WT-MH-COLL gene yielded secreted triple helical collagen (lane 2), while the 5′ MUT-MH-COLL gene produced a pepsin-sensitive collagen (lane 5). We concluded from these experiments that the 5′ stem-loop is necessary for productive collagen synthesis and, although it was mutated without affecting the coding region of the mRNA, has a profound effect on collagen protein folding or stability. Unique features of the three fibrillar collagen mRNAs, α1(I) mRNA, α2(I) mRNA, and α1(III) mRNA, is the 5′ stem-loop structure that encompasses the start codon (3Yamada Y. Mudryj M. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14914-14919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ stem-loop has an important role in regulating α1(I) mRNA stability (3Yamada Y. Mudryj M. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14914-14919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4334-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Stefanovic B. Lindquist J. Brenner D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 641-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is conserved in collagen mRNAs of evolutionary distant species (4Su M.W. Suzuki H.R. Bieker J.J. Solursh M. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,5D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. Suzuki H.R. Solursh M. Gambino R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7050-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the start codon is part of this stem-loop, the sequence constraints required to maintain the 5′ stem-loop dictate the sequence around translation initiation. Therefore, the start codon in collagen mRNAs is not in the sequence context necessary for optimal translation initiation (22Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 23Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). We have shown here that it is not efficiently recognized in vitro if more than one mRNA species are competing for the translation machinery. When the start codon was optimized we could increase translation 4-fold under competitive conditions (Fig. 1 C). The 5′ stem-loop structure has a stability of 25–30 kcal/mol. This is insufficient to block scanning ribosomes to reach the start codon, because stem-loop structures of about 70 kcal/mol are needed (27Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2850-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 28Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, reporter mRNA with the 5′ stem-loop (5′ WT-SL) was translated 3-fold less efficiently, even in the absence of competitor, than similar mRNA in which the stem-loop was mutated (5′MUT-SL, Fig. 2 C). It seems that the structure of the 5′ stem-loop together with its suboptimal translation start site is responsible for this effect. Various competitor mRNAs inhibit in vitro translation of a reporter mRNA with collagen α1(I) 5′ stem-loop (5′WT-SL) to a different degree. Competitor A inhibited translation of 5′ WT-SL mRNA 30-fold relative to a control mRNA (PSII) and 6-fold relative to the identical mRNA without the stem-loop (5′MUT-SL) (Fig. 2 D). β-globin mRNA had a smaller effect. Viral mRNA showed no inhibition on 5′ WT-SL mRNA, while 5′ MUT-SL mRNA is translated better. The reason for this is unclear, but TMV mRNA with its Omega sequence may titrate an inhibitor of translation (29Gallie D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3401-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The result with competitors corroborates the finding that the 5′ stem-loop may compromise translation of collagen α1(I) mRNA, which may be a weak substrate for translation in the absence of its RNA-binding proteins. Since the 5′ stem-loop binds protein factors in collagen-producing cells, it is possible that binding of these factors regulates translation of collagen α1(I) mRNA. Cloning of these proteins and their addition to the in vitro translation reaction will address this question. Previous reports suggested that N- and C-terminal peptides of type I collagen inhibit translation of collagen α1(I) mRNA (30Paglia L. Wilczek J. de Leon L.D. Martin G.R. Horlein D. Muller P. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5030-5034Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31Horlein D. McPherson J. Goh S.H. Bornstein P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6163-6167Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We did not see any inhibition when these recombinant peptides were added to the in vitro translation reaction (data not shown). Also, the α1(I), α2(I), and α1(III) collagen mRNAs contain two short uORF preceding the start codon. We did not see any change in translation of our reporter mRNAs in vitro when these uORF were abolished (data not shown). Although it is known that uORFs can regulate translation in yeast (32Gaba A. Wang Z. Krishnamoorthy T. Hinnebusch A.G. Sachs M.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6453-6463Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 33Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Peltz S.W. Cell. 2000; 101: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), there are only a few examples of their role in translational regulation in higher organisms (34Kos M. Denger S. Reid G. Gannon F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37131-37138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 35Degnin C.R. Schleiss M.R. Cao J. Geballe A.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5514-5521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Meijer H.A. Thomas A.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Based on electron microscopy data, assembly of the collagen type I heterotrimer occurs on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, while the individual chains are still associated with polysomes or shortly after their release (14Beck K. Boswell B.A. Ridgway C.C. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21566-21573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Veis A. Brownell A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Lysyl hydroxylase, one of the key enzymes in collagen modifications, is also associated with the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (37Suokas M. Myllyla R. Kellokumpu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17863-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Membrane association may couple folding starting from the C terminus of collagen chains, to concomitant modifications of the selected lysine residues. For collagen type I, this implies that α1(I) and α2(I) chains may be synthesized by ribosomes positioned in close proximity on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Such coordinated translation would greatly increase local concentration of the chains. We hypothesized that the sequence elements that modulate loading of ribosomes on collagen α1(I) mRNA may be involved in targeting for such coordinated translation. Therefore, we mutated the 5′ stem-loop and analyzed production of collagen trimersin vivo from the hybrid mouse-human collagen genes (5′WT-MH-COLL and 5′ MUT-MH-COLL) (Fig. 5). The human collagen α1(I) gene could rescue the phenotype of Mov 13 mice, proving that human collagen α1(I) polypeptide is functional in mouse (38Schnieke A. Dziadek M. Bateman J. Mascara T. Harbers K. Gelinas R. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 39Stacey A. Mulligan R. Jaenisch R. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2549-2554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ WT-MH-COLL gene produced triple helical collagen in Mov 13 fibroblasts; however, the 5′ MUT-MH-COLLgene produced collagen, which was sensitive to digestion with pepsin (Fig. 5). The structurally aberrant collagen was produced although the 5′ MUT-MH-COLL gene had the identical coding region. This pepsin-sensitive collagen may represent individual α1(I) chains, which were not efficiently folded into triple helix and were secreted as monomers, or alternatively, the monomers were not properly modified and an unstable triple helix was secreted. The 5′ MUT-MH-COLL chains had identical electrophoretic mobility to the 5′ WT-MH-COLL chains, excluding a major difference in post-translational modification, although subtle differences may remain undetected. If the chains were not efficiently folded, the 5′ stem-loop may be required to increase their local concentration, which would facilitate the chain registration. The result shown in Fig. 4 where the 5′WT-MH-COLL gene produced more disulfide-linked high molecular weight collagen suggests that this may be the case. If the chains were not properly modified, the 5′ stem-loop may target collagen mRNAs for translation to discrete regions of the endoplasmic reticulum where there is optimal concentration of collagen-specific modifying enzymes and molecular chaperones (40Rocnik E.F. Van Der Veer E. Cao H. Hegele R.A. Pickering J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38571-38578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although we do not have direct evidence for this, we think that the 5′ stem-loop also couples the translational machinery to the rest of the collagen biosynthetic pathway, because collagen biosynthesis requires coordinate action of translational apparatus, modifying enzymes, and molecular chaperones (41Lamande S.R.

In patients with OI, where folding of collagen type I chains is impaired, the mutant chains are hypermodified and subjected to degradation (19Fitzgerald J. Lamande S.R. Bateman J.F. J. Biol.

Interestingly, one patient with OI type I was described who had a mutation in the 5′ stem-loop in the absence of any other mutation of the collagen α1(I) gene (43Willing M.C. Slayton R.L. Pitts S.H. Deschenes S.P. J. Med. Genet. 1995; 32: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). There are many examples that mRNAs are targeted for translation at discrete subcellular sites to produce proteins with the concentration gradient within the cell. Most targeting signals are located in the 3′-UTR of these mRNAs (44Kloc M. Zearfoss N.R. Etkin L.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 533-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To our knowledge this is the first example that a RNA element located in the 5′-UTR is involved in synthesis of a secreted multisubunit protein. This study demonstrates that the conserved collagen 5′ stem-loop has specific functions. In the absence of RNA-binding proteins, the 5′ stem-loop renders the collagen mRNAs inefficient for translation and therefore susceptible to regulation, such as by TGFβ. In collagen-producing cells, the 5′ stem-loop has a novel function of directing the post-translational modification of collagen to produce mature triple helices. The 5′ stem-loop almost certainly acts through its cognate RNA-binding proteins. Cloning of these protein factors will help us elucidate the complex biosynthesis of type I collagen."

Recently, we showed that mannosamine can prevent the growth of P. falciparum by inhibiting the GPI biosynthesis. Here, we investigated the effect of isomeric amino sugars glucosamine, galactosamine, and their N-acetyl derivatives on parasite growth and GPI biosynthesis. Glucosamine, but not galactosamine,N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylgalactosamine inhibited the growth of the parasite in a dose-dependent manner. Glucosamine specifically arrested the maturation of trophozoites, a stage at which the parasite synthesizes all of its GPI anchor pool and had no effect during the parasite growth from rings to early trophozoites and from late trophozoites to schizonts and merozoites. An analysis of GPI intermediates formed when parasites incubated with glucosamine indicated that the sugar interferes with the inositol acylation of glucosamine-phosphatidylinositol (GlcN-PI) to form GlcN-(acyl)PI. Consistent with the non-inhibitory effect on parasite growth, galactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylgalactosamine had no significant effect on the parasite GPI biosynthesis. The results indicate that the enzyme that transfers the fatty acyl moiety to inositol residue of GlcN-PI discriminates the configuration at C-4 of hexosamines. An analysis of GPIs formed in a cell-free system in the presence and absence of glucosamine suggests that the effect of the sugar is because of direct inhibition of the enzyme activity and not gene repression. Because the fatty acid acylation of inositol is an obligatory step for the addition of the first mannosyl residue during the biosynthesis of GPIs, our results offer a strategy for the development of novel anti-malarial drugs. Furthermore, this is the first study to report the specific inhibition of GPI inositol acylation by glucosamine in eukaryotes.

Nearly 40% of the global population is vulnerable to this disease. In Africa alone, malaria causes millions of deaths each year, mostly children (1Triggs P.I. Kondrachine A.V. Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis, and Protection. ASM press, Washington, D. C.1998: 11-22Google Scholar, 2Breman J.G. Egan A. Keusch G.T. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2001; 64: iv-viiCrossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In recent years, the death toll due to malaria has been rapidly increasing because of the widespread resistance of parasites to chloroquine and other commonly used antimalarial drugs. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of novel drugs. Identification of new drugs targeting the metabolic pathways ofPlasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes severe malaria, has been the subject of study in several laboratories. The recently studied parasite choline transporter, type II fatty acid biosynthesis, dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)1 anchor biosynthesis are some potential targets for drug design (3Wengelnik K. Vidal V. Ancelin M.L. Cathiard A.M. Morgat J.L. Kocken C.H. Calas M. Herrera S. Thomas A.W. Vial H.J. Science. 2002; 295: 1311-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 4Surolia N.

GPIs are a class of glycolipids involved in anchoring certain functionally important proteins to the outer surfaces of cell membranes (8Ferguson M.A.J. Brimacombe J.S. Brown J.R. Crossman A. Dix A. Field R.A. Guther M.L. Milne K.G. Sharma D.K. Smith T.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). GPIs consist of a conserved trimannosylglucosaminyl core linked to the inositol residue of a phosphatidylinositol (PI). GPIs from different species or cell types vary widely in the type of fatty acyl/alkyl residues and with respect to additional sugar residues and/or ethanolamine phosphate attached to the glycan core (8Ferguson M.A.J. Brimacombe J.S. Brown J.R. Crossman A. Dix A. Field R.A. Guther M.L. Milne K.G. Sharma D.K. Smith T.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These variations confer broad structural diversity to GPIs, resulting in a wide range of biological activity (8Ferguson M.A.J. Brimacombe J.S. Brown J.R. Crossman A. Dix A. Field R.A. Guther M.L.

In the case of intraerythrocytic stage P. falciparum,several proteins are anchored to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane through GPIs (10Gowda D.C. Gupta P. Davidson E.A. J. Biol.

These proteins include functionally important molecules such as merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1), MSP-2, MSP-4, a 71-kDa protein of the heat shock family, the 102-kDa transferrin receptor, and a 75-kDa serine protease. Of these, MSP-1 is crucial for recognition, binding, and invasion of erythrocytes (10Gowda D.C. Gupta P. Davidson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6428-6439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11Braun Breton C. Rosenberry T.L. Pereira da Silva L.H. Res.

Immun. 1997; 65: 4460-4467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, like many other parasites, P. falciparum synthesizes GPIs in severalfold excess than that required for protein anchoring. Accumulated evidence suggests that parasites use free GPIs for the regulation (stimulation/suppression) of the host immune system to assure their survival in the harsh environments of the host (9Ropert C. Gazzinelli R.T. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, GPIs are crucial for the survival of P. falciparum in the host. The GPIs of intraerythrocytic P. falciparum consist of EtN-P-6(Manα1–2)Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcN linked to the inositol residue of PI. The PI moiety is heterogeneous with regard to fatty acyl substituents at the sn-1 andsn-2 positions and at C-2 of the inositol residue (14Gerold P. Dieckmann-Schuppert A. Schwarz R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2597-2606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Naik R.S. Branch O.H. Woods A.S. Vijaykumar M. Perkins D.J. Nahlen B.L. Lal A.A. Cotter R.J. Costello C.E. Ockenhouse C.F. Davidson E.A. Gowda D.C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1563-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). P. falciparum synthesizes GPIs exclusively during the trophozoite stage in a developmental stage-specific manner. We have previously shown that mannosamine inhibits the growth of P. falciparum specifically at the trophozoite stage and thereby causes the death of the parasite (6Naik R.S. Davidson E.A. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24506-24511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In P. falciparum, mannosamine prevents the addition of the first mannose to the inositol-acylated GlcN-PI intermediate. The mechanism by which mannosamine inhibits GPI biosynthesis in P. falciparum is different from that observed in other organisms (16Lisanti M. Field M.C. Caras I. Menon A.K. Rodriguez-Boulan E.

In this study, we investigated the effect of two isomeric amino sugars, glucosamine and galactosamine, and their N-acetyl derivatives on the parasite growth and GPI biosynthesis. The data presented here show that of these amino sugars, only glucosamine inhibits the growth of P. falciparum and parasite GPI biosynthesis. The sugar inhibits fatty acid acylation of the inositol residue of GlcN-PI, a novel inhibition mechanism. RPMI 1640 culture medium and HEPES were purchased from Invitrogen. TLCK, leupeptin, hypoxanthine,p-aminobenzoic acid, saponin, galactosamine, glucosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, and jack bean α-mannosidase (30 units/mg) were purchased from Sigma. Gentamycin sulfate was from Biofluids (Rockville, MD). O-type human blood was obtained from the Georgetown University Hospital. O-type human serum was from Interstate Blood Bank (Memphis, TN). [2-3H]Mannose (18 Ci/mmol), [6-3H]glucosamine (23 Ci/mmol), [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol), and14C-labeled protein molecular weight markers were fromAmersham Biosciences. [1,2-3H]Inositol (30–80 Ci/mmol) and GDP-[2-3H]mannose (40 Ci/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Silica Gel 60 HPTLC plates were from Whatman (Clifton, NJ). En3HanceTM fluorographic spray for TLC plates was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. P. falciparum (FCR-3 strain) parasites were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 22 mm HEPES, 29 mm NaHCO3, 0.005% hypoxanthine, p-aminobenzoic acid (2 mg/liter), gentamycin sulfate (50 mg/liter), and 10% human serum at 3–4% hematocrit (15Naik R.S.

The parasites were synchronized 4–6 h after erythrocyte invasion using 5% sorbitol (20Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar). The synchronous parasites were incubated in the culture medium containing 1.25–10 mm of the test amino sugars. Parasites incubated in culture medium without sugars served as control. At various time intervals, thin smears of cultures were stained with Geimsa and analyzed by light microscopy to assess the growth and development of the parasites. To investigate the effect of the sugars on the biosynthesis of GPIs, the parasites were radiolabeled as follows: synchronous cultures of the parasites with 15% parasitemia were treated with the inhibitor sugar at 28 h after erythrocyte invasion. 2 h later, the medium was replaced with one containing [3H]mannose (50 μCi/ml), [3H]glucosamine (50 μCi/ml) or methionine (5 mg/liter), and [35S]methionine (50 μCi/ml) and incubated for 6 h. For labeling with inositol, parasites with 15% parasitemia were treated with inhibitors at 20 h after invasion (late rings) and 2 h later were incubated with [3H]inositol (50 μCi/ml) for 12 h in regular medium (6Naik R.S. Davidson E.A. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24506-24511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After radiolabeling, the parasites were released from infected erythrocytes by suspending the erythrocyte pellets in 0.025% saponin in 56 mm NaCl, 59 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm K2HPO4, 11 mmNaHCO3, and 14 mm glucose, pH 7.4, and incubated for 10 min in an ice bath. The suspension was passed through a 26-G needle, centrifuged at 3800 rpm at 4 °C, and the pelleted parasites washed with the buffer and stored at −80 °C. Synchronous cultures of the parasites (1 ml) with 22% parasitemia were harvested at mid-trophozoite stage. Parasites were released by lysis of erythrocyte membranes with 0.025% saponin as described previously (6Naik R.S. Davidson E.A. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24506-24511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The parasite pellet (∼0.1 ml) was washed with 50 mm sodium Bicine, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mg/ml glucose, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The parasites were lysed hypotonically by suspending in 500 μl of water containing 0.1 mm TLCK, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and homogenized with 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer in an ice bath (21Gerold P. Jumg N. Azzouz N. Freiberg N. Kobe S. Schwarz R.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 244: 731-738Crossref Google Scholar). To the lysate was added 500 μl of 200 mm sodium HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mmTLCK, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and the suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The parasite membrane pellet was suspended in 500 μl of 100 mm sodium HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm TLCK, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and the 100-μl suspension was used for each incubation. The membrane suspensions were supplemented with 1 mm CoA, 1 mm ATP, 1 mmUDP-N-acetylglucosamine, and 5 mmMnCl2 and made up to 250 μl with the above buffer (21Gerold P. Jumg N. Azzouz N. Freiberg N. Kobe S. Schwarz R.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 244: 731-738Crossref Google Scholar). Glucosamine (5 or 10 mm) was added, incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and then GDP-[3H]mannose (500,000 cpm) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The radiolabeled GPIs formed were isolated and analyzed by HPTLC (see below). GPIs from parasites were extracted four times with 5 volumes of CHCl3/CH3OH/water (10:10:3, v/v/v). The extract was dried by SpeedVac and then partitioned between water and water-saturated 1-butanol (22Ferguson M.A.J. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Lipid Modification of Proteins: A Practical Approach.

The organic layer containing radiolabeled glycolipids was washed with water and stored at −20 °C. The GPIs (20,000–100,000 cpm) in 75 μl of 0.2 m NaOAc, pH 3.75, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 were treated with 75 μl of 1m NaNO2 (22Ferguson M.A.J. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J.

After a 24-h incubation at room temperature, the released lipid moieties were extracted with water-saturated 1-butanol, dried, and analyzed by HPTLC. The glycan moieties were recovered by chromatography on Bio-Gel P-4 (1 × 90 cm) in 100 mm pyridine, and 100 mm HOAc, pH 5.2. The GPIs (100,000–200,000 cpm) were treated with 50% aqueous hydrofluoric acid (50 μl) in an ice bath for 48 h (22Ferguson M.A.J. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J.

The reaction mixture was neutralized with frozen-saturated LiOH extracted with water-saturated 1-butanol, dried, and analyzed by HPTLC. The GPIs in 100 μl of the methanol-ammonia mixture (methanol, 30% ammonia, 1:1 (v/v), freshly prepared) were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. At the end of the incubation, the reaction mixture was evaporated by SpeedVac and analyzed by HPTLC. The GPIs (25,000–50,000 cpm) were treated with jack bean α-mannosidase (30 units/ml) in 40 μl of 100 mm NaOAc, 2 mm Zn2+, pH 5.0, containing 0.1% sodium taurodeoxycholate at ∼20 °C for 2 h and then at 37 °C for 22 h (24Milne K.G. Ferguson M.A.J. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1465-1471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The solutions were heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min, extracted with water-saturated 1-butanol, and analyzed by HPTLC. The GPI extracts were applied onto HPTLC plates developed with chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:2.4, v/v/v). After air drying, the plates were sprayed with En3Hance fluorographic spray and exposed to x-ray films at −80 °C (10Gowda D.C. Gupta P. Davidson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6428-6439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The [35S]methionine-labeled parasites were dissolved in 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample, the lysates were heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and then they were electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions on 6–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The gels were fixed, washed with water, soaked in 1 m sodium salicylate solution for 30 min, dried, and exposed to x-ray films at −80 °C. The synchronous cultures of the parasites at the ring stage 8 h after the invasion of erythrocytes were treated with various concentrations of the test sugars, and the growth of the parasites was monitored through various stages of development. Glucosamine inhibited the parasite growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1and Table I). The growth of parasites treated with 1.25 mm glucosamine was similar to control cultures during the first cell cycle. However, the efficiency of erythrocyte invasion of merozoites that entered into the third cell cycle was reduced by ∼20% compared with that of the untreated culture. The parasite treated with 2.5 mm glucosamine also grew normally in the first cycle, but the growth was significantly reduced during the second cell cycle. The efficiency of erythrocyte invasion of merozoites formed during the second cell cycle and third cell cycle was decreased by ∼20 and ∼60%, respectively (Table I). In the case of 5 mm glucosamine, the rate of parasite growth was significantly reduced during the first cell cycle itself. Approximately 75% of the parasites developed into trophozoites and schizonts, and 25% remained as early trophozoites. The invasion efficiency of merozoites formed during the first cell cycle was ∼53% compared with that of the control culture. Continued treatment with 5 mm glucosamine completely arrested parasite growth in the second life cycle, and all parasites died. Parasites treated with 10 mm glucosamine failed to develop into trophozoites, and subsequently all parasites died.Table IThe effect of hexosamines and N-acetylhexosamines on parasitemia and growth of intraerythrocytic P. falciparumSugar treatedParasite developmental stage and percent parasitemia32 h1-aThe life cycle of intraerythrocytic P. falciparumis 48 h: 0–48 h, first cell cycle; 48–96 h, second cell cycle; 96–144 h, third life cycle.

Open table in a new tab Equal aliquots of synchronous cultures of the parasites with 4% parasitemia were treated with the indicated sugars at various concentrations. At the indicated time, the levels of parasitemia and developmental stages were assessed by light microscopic examination of the Giemsa-stained thin smears. To determine whether the observed effect of glucosamine on parasite growth is the result of the inhibition of specific metabolic pathway or nonspecific cell toxicity, parasites were treated at the ring stage (6 h post-erythrocyte invasion) with 5 and 10 mm glucosamine. At various time intervals, glucosamine was withdrawn and the growth of the parasites was monitored. In this case, treatment with 5 or 10 mm glucosamine during ring stage for 8–10 h had no effect on the growth. At both concentrations, the parasites developed into trophozoites and schizonts and the released merozoites invaded the erythrocytes with the same efficiency as that of the untreated control culture. However, treatment for 24 h (both the ring and trophozoite stages) with 5 mm glucosamine caused a 40–50% reduction in parasitemia in the second cell cycle. The surviving parasites developed normally during the second cell cycle. In contrast to glucosamine, galactosamine had no effect on the growth and development of the parasites. The growth of the parasites treated with 2.5 or 5 mm galactosamine was similar to that of the untreated culture (Fig. 1 and Table I). The parasite treated with 10 mm galactosamine also developed into late trophozoites and schizonts, but the erythrocyte invasion of the merozoites formed was 73% compared with that of the control culture. Of the parasites that entered into the second cycle in 10 mmgalactosamine-treated culture, ∼73% developed into trophozoites during the second cell cycle and the erythrocyte invasion efficiency of the merozoites to enter into the third life cycle was markedly reduced. The inhibition of parasite on prolonged treatment with 10 mm galactosamine is probably because of the metabolic conversion of galactosamine into glucosamine 6-phosphate (26Varki A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 16-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which could inhibit parasite growth in a manner similar to that by glucosamin"
https://openalex.org/W2008559836,"The steroid hormone estrogen elicits biological effects in cells by binding to and activating the estrogen receptor (ER). Estrogen binding induces a conformational change in the receptor, inducing nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of ER. The ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin has been shown to interact directly with ER and enhance its stability. To further elucidate the functional sequelae of the association between calmodulin and ER, we examined the effect on ER transcriptional activation of specifically inhibiting calmodulin. The cell-permeable calmodulin antagonist CGS9343B prevented estrogen-induced transcriptional activation by ER, without altering basal transcription. The inhibition was dose-dependent and independent of the time of estrogen stimulation. To validate these findings, calmodulin function was also neutralized by targeted expression of a specific inhibitor peptide. By inserting localization signals, the inhibitor peptide was selectively targeted to different subcellular domains. Inactivation of calmodulin function in the nucleus virtually eliminated estrogen-stimulated ER transcriptional activation. By contrast, when membrane calmodulin was specifically neutralized, estrogen-stimulated transcriptional activation by ER was only slightly attenuated. Importantly, the inhibitor peptides did not significantly reduce the amount of ER in the cells.

Estrogen mediates its biological effects in cells through the estrogen receptor (ER),1 a member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-dependent transcription factors (reviewed in Refs. 1Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2660) Google Scholar and 2Dickson, R. B., and Stancel, G. M. (2000) J. Natl. Cancer. Inst. Monogr. 135–145Google Scholar). Analogous to other steroid hormone receptors, ER is an intracellular transcription factor composed of six domains. Estrogen binding to the C-terminal hormone-binding domain induces conformational changes in ER, thereby promoting its dimerization and nuclear localization. The DNA-binding domain of the activated ER binds to DNA sequences, termed estrogen response elements, found in the regulatory regions of target genes. Several factors, including coactivators, corepressors, and integrator proteins, are important in ER-mediated transcription (reviewed in Refs. 3McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar and 4Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). It is becoming apparent that transcriptional regulation requires the recruitment by ER of multiple, distinct proteins that cooperate to achieve the required response (3McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). These factors can alter the magnitude of cellular responses to estrogen. There are yet additional factors that modulate ER function. For example, ER interacts with members of the heat-shock protein family (1Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2660) Google Scholar), and dissociation of heat-shock protein seems to be necessary for ER to activate transcription. One of the major roles of ligand binding is to change the nature of protein-protein interactions between steroid receptors and other proteins (2Dickson, R. B., and Stancel, G. M. (2000) J. Natl. Cancer. Inst. Monogr. 135–145Google Scholar). Conversely, other proteins can alter the state of ER independent of ligand binding. For example, phosphorylation of ER by several protein kinases, including a calmodulin-stimulated kinase, modulates ER transcriptional activation (5MacGregor J.I. Jordan V.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 151-196PubMed Google Scholar). Calmodulin, a ubiquitous modulator of Ca2+ signaling (6Cohen P. Klee C. Calmodulin. Elsevier, New York1988Google Scholar), regulates the function of multiple, diverse proteins (7Chun K.Y. Sacks D.B. Pochet R. Donato R. Haiech J. Heizmann C. Gerke V. Calcium: The Molecular Basis of Calcium Action in Biology and Medicine. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2000: 541-563Google Scholar, 8Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). A substantial body of evidence supports a role for Ca2+ and calmodulin in estrogen action (Ref. 9Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, and references therein). For example, calmodulin binds to ER in a Ca2+-dependent manner (9Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Bouhoute A. Leclercq G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and is required for formation of the ER-estrogen response element complex (11Biswas D.K. Reddy P.V. Pickard M. Makkad B. Pettit N. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33817-33824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, calmodulin stimulates 17-β-estradiol (E2) binding to ER, inducing tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the ER (12Migliaccio A. Rotondi A. Auricchio F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5921-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recent evidence from our laboratory indicates that endogenous ER binds to endogenous calmodulin, thereby stabilizing ER (9Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Together with the report that calmodulin antagonists inhibit the growth of human breast carcinoma cell lines (13Strobl J.S. Peterson V.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 263: 186-193PubMed Google Scholar), these finding suggest that Ca2+/calmodulin may participate in ER signaling pathways. Therefore, we set out to examine whether calmodulin modulates the transcriptional activation of ER. Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen and fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Biowhittaker. Charcoal-treated FBS was from Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. MCF-7 and T47D breast epithelial cells as well as COS-7 green monkey kidney cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. pcDNA3-CaMBP4-Flag (calmodulin-binding peptide with C-terminal-tagged Flag) was kindly provided by Drs. Marcia Kaetzel, Thomas Freeman, and John Dedman (University of Cincinnati). ERE3-TK-Luc reporter was a generous gift from Dr. Myles Brown (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). CGS9343B was generously donated by Drs. E. Moret and B. Schmid (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland). Permanox plastic eight-well chamber culture slides were from Nalge Nunc International. FuGENE 6 was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane was purchased from Millipore Corporation. pEYFP-Mem vector was purchased from Clontech. pRL-TK plasmid was from Promega. Anti-ERα (Ab-15) antibodies were manufactured by Neomarkers. Anti-ERβ and anti-Flag antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibodies have been characterized previously (14Sacks D.B. Porter S.E. Ladenson J.H. McDonald J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Anti-green fluorescent protein antibodies and anti-Flag M2 agarose affinity beads were purchased from Clontech and Sigma, respectively. Tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Anti-mouse Ig, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from AmershamBiosciences. A synthetic gene that encodes the myosin light chain kinase calmodulin-binding sequence was used (15Wang J. Campos B. Jamieson G.A., Jr. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30245-30248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The Flag-tagged construct, which comprises four tandem calmodulin-binding peptide (CaMBP) repeats, is termed CaMBP4-Flag. The pcDNA3.1-CaMBP4-Flag was used as template. A 356-bp fragment that contains the four CaMBP repeats and a C-terminal-tagged Flag fusion protein was amplified by PCR and BsrG1 sites were designed at both ends for insertion into pEYFP-Mem (Clontech) to produce a membrane-targeted construct. The oligonucleotides used in PCR were 5′-CGCTGTACATCGAGTCTAGCGCCACCATG-3′ and 3′-CGCTGTACAGGATCCTTATCACTTGTCATC-5′. pEYFP-Mem encodes a fusion protein that consists of the N-terminal 20 amino acids of neuromodulin and a yellow-green fluorescent variant of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EYFP). The neuromodulin fragment contains a signal for post-translational palmitoylation that targets EYFP to membranes. To label CaMBP4-Flag with EYFP, the pEYFP-Mem plasmid was cut withBsrG1, and the CaMBP4-Flag was inserted and ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The construct was named CaMBP/m. Because the CaMBP localizes in the nucleus (15Wang J. Campos B. Jamieson G.A., Jr. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30245-30248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), CaMBP4-Flag was inserted into pEYFP lacking any localization sequences to develop the nuclear targeted construct, termed CaMBP/n. The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. All plasmids were purified using the Qiagen DNA Purification Kit (Qiagen) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. MCF-7 and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS. T47D cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS. MCF-7 and T47D cells were plated in 100-mm dishes (for Western blots) or 96-well plates (for measurement of transcription); COS-7 cells were plated in 12-well dishes. DNA was transiently introduced into cells 24 h after plating using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. When transfecting cells in 100-mm dishes, 4 μg of CaMBP/m, CaMBP/n, or EYFP-Mem vector was used. When measuring transcriptional activity in MCF-7 and T47D cells, transfections were performed in triplicate with 200 ng of total DNA per well, comprising 10 ng of pRL-TK (which encodes Renilla reniformis luciferase, used as an internal control for transfection efficiency), 40 ng of ERE3-TK-Luc reporter, and 150 ng of CaMBP/m, CaMBP/n, or EYFP-Mem vector. For COS-7 cells, 0.65 μg of total DNA, containing 0.1 μg of pcDNA3-ERα, 0.5 μg of ERE3-TK-Luc reporter, and 50 ng of pRL-TK, was used. Six hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with phenol red-free culture medium containing 10% charcoal-treated FBS. Twenty-four hours later, E2 or an equal amount of vehicle was added to the cells in the absence or presence of CGS9343B. Cells were incubated for the times indicated in the figure legends, lysed, and processed as described below. Equal numbers of cells were lysed in 50 μl (for 96-well plates) or 200 μl (for 12-well plates) Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega), essentially as described previously (16Briggs M.W., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7453-7465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, light emission from firefly luciferase activity was measured using a 300–650-nm photomultiplier tube in a Turner Design 20/20 DLReady luminometer for 12 s. Stop & Glo reagent was added to quench the firefly luciferase, andRenilla (control) luciferase activity in the same sample tube was then measured for an additional 12 s. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency to theRenilla luciferase internal control. Where indicated, cells were incubated with CGS9343B or an equal volume of ethanol (vehicle). The concentrations and incubation times are indicated in the figure legends. The concentrations of CGS9343B used did not reduce the viability of the cell lines used in this study (data not shown). In addition, E2 did not enhance the signal in cells transfected with the TK-Luc plasmid lacking estrogen response element (data not shown). Cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)) and equal amounts of protein lysate were resolved directly by SDS-PAGE or immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag M2 agarose affinity beads. Samples were washed five times in buffer A, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membrane. Immunoblots were probed with anti-ERα, anti-ERβ, anti-calmodulin (14Sacks D.B. Porter S.E. Ladenson J.H. McDonald J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), or anti-green fluorescent protein antibodies. Complexes were visualized with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. MCF-7 cells, grown on Permanox plastic slides, were transiently transfected with 0.8 μg CaMBP/m, CaMBP/n or EYFP-Mem empty vector using FuGENE 6. After 24 h, slides were processed for immunocytochemisty essentially as described previously (17Kim S.H., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Slides were incubated for 1 h with mouse anti-Flag or anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibody, washed four times with phosphate buffered saline (145 mm NaCl, 12 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.2), and then incubated with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h and mounted with Aqua Polymount (Polysciences, Inc.). Digital micrographs were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope with the MRC-1024 Confocal Imaging System (Bio-Rad), and were imported into a Dell Power Edge 2200 computer for processing using the Lasersharp 3.0 program (BioRad). Confocal data were converted to TIFF files. Data were obtained from multiple cells in at least three different fields from multiple wells, each from at least two independent experimental determinations. Densitometry of enhanced chemiluminescence signals was performed using the Scion Image software for PC (Scion Corporation). Protein concentrations were determined with the detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad). Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test using InStat software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Cell viability was assessed by monitoring exclusion of trypan blue. We demonstrated previously that incubation of MCF-7 cells with calmodulin antagonists for 16 h reduced the amount of ERα (9Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). ERβ was not examined. Therefore, we incubated MCF-7 cells with the cell-permeable calmodulin antagonist CGS9343B (18Norman J.A. Ansell J. Stone G.A. Wennogle L.P. Wasley J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 535-540PubMed Google Scholar, 19Joyal J.L. Burks D.J. Pons S. Matter W.F. Vlahos C.J. White M.F. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37885-37892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) for different time intervals. Examination of equal amounts of protein lysate by Western blotting revealed that ERα was decreased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). Our prior analysis showed that the reduction in ERα seemed to be caused primarily by calmodulin stabilization of the ERα protein (9Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This finding is supported by reverse transcription-PCR, which demonstrated that transcription of the ERα gene is not reduced by CGS9343B (data not shown). In contrast to the reduction in ERα protein levels, CGS9343B had no effect on the amount of ERβ in the cells (Fig. 1 B). These data are consistent with the recent observation that ERβ does not bind to calmodulin (21Garcia Pedrero J.M. Del Rio B. Martinez-Campa C. Muramatsu M. Lazo P.S. Ramos S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 947-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, all further analyses were restricted to ERα. Note that CGS9343B did not reduce the cell viability in any cell lines examined in this study at the concentrations used in this work (data not shown). In addition to its stabilizing effect on ER (9Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), calmodulin is required for formation of the ER-ERE complex (11Biswas D.K. Reddy P.V. Pickard M. Makkad B. Pettit N. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33817-33824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The latter data suggest that calmodulin may modulate transcriptional activation by ER. To examine this hypothesis, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with an ER-responsive reporter plasmid and incubated with or without CGS9343B. E2-stimulated ER transcription in MCF-7 cells by 4–5-fold (Fig. 2). Exposure of cells to 40 μm CGS9343B for 16 h completely eliminated E2-induced transcription, without altering basal transcription (Fig. 2 A). More detailed analysis revealed that the inhibition produced by CGS9343B was dose-dependent, with E2 stimulation essentially abolished at 40 μm CGS9343B (Fig. 2 B). The abrogation of E2-stimulated transcription by CGS9343B could be caused by reduction in ER, disruption of the association of calmodulin with ER (9Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), or another mechanism. To evaluate the first possibility, E2-stimulated transcription was examined at different time intervals. E2-enhanced transcriptional activity in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2 C). Neither E2 nor CGS9343B significantly altered transcription at 0 h. As seen with 16 h of incubation, CGS9343B completely prevented enhancement of transcription by E2 at all time points (Fig. 2 C). Note that incubation with CGS9343B for 8 h reduced ERα by only 19% (Fig. 1), far less than its effect on transcription. Together, these results suggest that the absence of E2-stimulated ER transcription is not caused merely by a reduction in ER; an interaction of calmodulin with ER seems necessary for transcriptional activation. To confirm the biological relevance of our observations, analysis was performed in T47D cells, another ERα-positive cell line. Analogous to the observations in MCF-7 cells, incubation of T47D cells with 40 μm CGS9343B completely prevented enhancement of transcription by E2 (Fig. 3 A). Incubation with CGS9343B for both 8 and 16 h produced essentially identical results. The magnitude of the inhibition of transcription produced by CGS9343B was substantially greater than the extent of the reduction of ERα protein in T47D cells, which was 44–48% (Fig. 3 B). Note that although E2 reduced ERα protein, the magnitude of the reduction produced by CGS9343B was independent of E2. These findings mimic our prior observations in MCF-7 cells (9Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To attempt to eliminate the possibility that the inhibition of transcriptional activity of ER by CGS9343B may have been caused by a decrease in receptor abundance, transfected ERα was also examined. ERα was cotransfected into COS-7 cells with the luciferase reporter gene. Consistent with its effects on endogenous ER, CGS9343B completely inhibited E2-stimulated transcription of transfected ER (Fig. 4 A). Although COS-7 cells do not have endogenous ERα or ERβ and might not contain all the components necessary for ER degradation, CGS9343B reduced transfected ERα in COS-7 cells by approximately the same extent as the reduction observed with endogenous ER (Fig. 4 B). CGS9343B is reported to be a specific antagonist for calmodulin at concentrations up to 1 mm (18Norman J.A. Ansell J. Stone G.A. Wennogle L.P. Wasley J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 535-540PubMed Google Scholar), a concentration 25-fold higher than the highest concentration used in this work. Nevertheless, caution should always be exercised in interpreting results obtained with antagonists. Therefore, we adopted a complementary strategy to inhibit calmodulin. Transient transfection of an inhibitor peptide derived from muscle myosin light-chain kinase into mammalian cells blocks calmodulin function (15Wang J. Campos B. Jamieson G.A., Jr. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30245-30248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The CaMBP was tagged with Flag and EYFP. To discriminate between the interaction of calmodulin and ER in the nucleus with the interaction in the plasma membrane, the EYFP-CaMBP-Flag construct was selectively targeted to subcellular regions. The constructs are termed CaMBP/m and CaMBP/n for membrane- and nuclear-targeted versions, respectively. The peptides were characterized before evaluation in ER transcription assays. To verify calmodulin binding, Flag-tagged CaMBP/m and CaMBP/n were transfected into cells and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag affinity gel. Probing the resultant Western blots for calmodulin demonstrated that both CaMBP/n and CaMBP/m specifically bind endogenous calmodulin, with essentially the same affinity (Fig. 5 A). Probing the immunoprecipitates for yellow fluorescent protein revealed that equal amounts of CaMBP are present (Fig. 5 A). The EYFP-Mem vector is not seen on the blot (Fig. 5 A, top) because it lacks Flag, but it was present in the lysates (data not shown). The subcellular localization of CaMBP/m and CaMBP/n in MCF-7 cells was assessed by immunocytochemistry. EYFP-Mem vector (containing yellow fluorescent protein and the membrane-targeting sequence) was expressed at the plasma and intracellular membranes (Fig. 5 B, left). CaMBP/m had a distribution virtually identical to that of the vector alone; it was expressed both at the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 B,center). By contrast, CaMBP/n was expressed almost exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 5 B, right). The merged images verify that the EYFP plasmids express the Flag-tagged peptides. We next examined the effect on ER transcription of neutralizing calmodulin function in different subcellular domains. As shown in Fig. 6 A, transient transfection into MCF-7 cells of CaMBP/n (which neutralizes nuclear calmodulin) eliminated E2-induced ER transcriptional activation. Inhibiting calmodulin function in the extranuclear regions of the cell with CaMBP/m had a much less dramatic effect. When membrane calmodulin function was neutralized, E2 readily increased ER transcriptional activation, reaching a level only 24% below that attained in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 6 A). Neither CaMBP/m nor CaMBP/n significantly altered basal ER transcriptional activity (data not shown). Importantly, in contrast to the reduction in ERα produced by CGS9343B, neither CaMBP/n nor CaMBP/m significantly changed the amount of ERα in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6 B). Similarly, the CaMBPs had no effect on the amount of calmodulin. Therefore, these data indicate that the effect of calmodulin in ER transcriptional activation is independent of its effect on ER stability. Our results suggest that by blocking nuclear calmodulin function, CaMBP/n reduces transcriptional activation by ER. The attenuation of ER transcription by inhibiting the association of calmodulin with ER at the membrane was less anticipated. The mechanism is unknown. A membrane ER has been demonstrated, but this receptor is not believed to induce transcription (22Levin E.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 374-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), making it unlikely that this could account for the effect of CaMBP/m. Although CaMBP/m did not reduce total ER, the amount of ER in the nucleus could be lower. Alternatively, CaMBP/m could alter the cellular distribution of calmodulin, reducing the amount of nuclear calmodulin; this could decrease ER transcriptional activation. Studies are underway to identify the mechanism. During the preparation of this manuscript, Pedrero et al.(21Garcia Pedrero J.M. Del Rio B. Martinez-Campa C. Muramatsu M. Lazo P.S. Ramos S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 947-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the calmodulin antagonist W7 reduced by 74% E2-stimulated ER transcription in breast epithelial cells. However, no evidence was presented in that study that the inhibition of transcription was independent of the reduction in ER protein produced by calmodulin antagonists. Moreover, W7 lacks specificity and inhibits calmodulin-independent enzymes, such as protein kinase A and protein kinase C (23Sugimura M. Sato T. Nakayama W. Morishima Y. Fukunaga K. Omitsu M. Miyamoto E. Shirasaki Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 336: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our study is not subject to these caveats. We inhibited calmodulin function by two independent strategies, namely with CGS9343B, believed to be a specific calmodulin antagonist (18Norman J.A. Ansell J. Stone G.A. Wennogle L.P. Wasley J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 535-540PubMed Google Scholar), and a specific calmodulin target peptide. Importantly, we examined transcription under conditions in which the amount of ER was not significantly reduced. Together, our data document that disruption of the interaction between calmodulin and ER prevented the latter from activating transcription in response to E2. First reported almost 20 years ago (24Flandroy L. Cheung W.Y. Steiner A.L. Cell Tissue Res. 1983; 233: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the participation of calmodulin in estrogen function has become the focus of renewed interest (Ref. 9Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, and references therein). Calmodulin binds to ER in intact cells independently of E2, thereby modulating ER stability and steady state levels (9Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, calmodulin is an integral component of the ER-estrogen response element complex (11Biswas D.K. Reddy P.V. Pickard M. Makkad B. Pettit N. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33817-33824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,25Bouhoute A. Leclercq G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The data presented here demonstrate that an interaction between calmodulin and ER in the nucleus is required for E2-stimulated ER transcriptional activation. The molecular mechanism by which calmodulin facilitates ER transcription is unknown. Calmodulin has been shown to modulate the activity of a number of nuclear proteins, several of which are involved in transcription. For example, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases regulate gene transcription by altering coactivator function (26Corcoran E.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2975-2978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, calmodulin binds to members of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, modifying their DNA binding (27Onions J. Hermann S. Grundstrom T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23930-23937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, a family of calmodulin-binding transcription activators was identified (28Bouche N. Scharlat A. Snedden W. Bouchez D. Fromm H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21851-21861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). It is not known whether calmodulin directly binds a transcription activator or has another role in ER transcription. Our previous results imply that calmodulin alters the tertiary conformation of ER (9Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One could envisage that this would alter the ability of ER to interact with coactivators and/or corepressors, altering transcription. Regardless of the mechanism, our data contribute to deciphering the intricate meshwork of ER signaling pathways. In addition, they further explain the prior observations that calmodulin antagonists inhibit the growth of breast cell lines (29Wei J.W. Hickie R.A. Klaassen D.J. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1983; 11: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and synergistically amplify antiestrogen therapy (30Newton C.J. Eycott K. Green V. Atkin S.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Comparison of the protease IV amino acid sequence to other bacterial proteases suggested that amino acids His-72, Asp-122, and Ser-198 could form a catalytic triad that is critical for protease IV activity. To test this possibility, site-directed mutations by alanine substitution were introduced into six selected residues including the predicted triad and identical residues located close to the triad. Mutations at any of the amino acids of the predicted catalytic triad or Ser-197 caused a loss of enzymatic activity and absence of the mature form of protease IV. In contrast, mutations at His-116 or Ser-200 resulted in normal processing into the enzymatically active mature form. A purified proenzyme that accumulated in the His-72 mutant was shown in vitro to be susceptible to cleavage by protease IV purified from P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, similarities of protease IV to the lysine-specific endoprotease of Achromobacter lyticussuggested three possible disulfide bonds in protease IV. These results identify the catalytic triad of protease IV, demonstrate that autodigestion is essential for the processing of protease IV into a mature protease, and predict sites essential to enzyme conformation.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major opportunistic pathogen that is often associated with burns, cancers, cystic fibrosis, and immune deficiency diseases (1Bodey G.P. Bolivar R. Fainstein V. Jadeja L.

Chest Dis. 1997; 52: 363-366PubMed Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa is also well recognized as the most important Gram-negative bacterium causing severe keratitis, especially in contact lens wearers (7Alfonso E. Mandelbaum S. Fox M.J. Forster R.K. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1986; 101: 429-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Sweeney D.F. Stapleton F. Leitch C. Taylor J. Holden B.A. Willcox M.D. Optometry Vis.

This keratitis progresses rapidly and may result in permanent loss of vision (10Arffa R.C. Eve F.R. Int. Ophthalmol. Clin. 1991; 31: 89-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 11Dart J.K. Br. J. Ophthalmol. 1988; 72: 926-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The ability of P. aeruginosa to produce several extracellular enzymes, such as elastase (LasB, pseudolysin), alkaline protease (aeruginolysin), LasA (staphylolysin), and LasD (staphylolysin), is considered to be important in its pathogenicity. Protease IV (lysyl endopeptidase; EC 3.4.24.26) has been demonstrated to correlate with corneal virulence. Protease IV has also recently been identified as the iron-regulated protein PrpL (12Wilderman P.J. Vasil A.I. Johnson Z. Wilson M.J. Cunliffe H.E. Lamont I.L. Vasil M.L. Infect. Immunity. 2001; 69: 5385-5394Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Protease IV is a lysine-specific protease with molecular mass of 26 kDa that has been identified in culture supernatants of P. aeruginosa(13Engel L.S. Hill J.M. Caballero A.R. Green L.C. O'Callaghan R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16792-16797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 14O'Callaghan R.J. Engel L.S. Hobden J.A. Callegan M.C. Green L.C. Hill J.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 534-543PubMed Google Scholar, 15Toder D.S. Gambello M.J. Abstracts of ASM Meeting, New Orleans, LA, May, 1992. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1992: 104Google Scholar). Protease IV was first characterized in P. aeruginosa strain PA103-29, a strain reported to be deficient in alkaline protease, elastase A, and elastase B production (16Ohman D.E. Cryz S.J. Iglewski B.H. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 836-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the nucleotide sequence of the protease IV gene from P. aeruginosa PA103-29 was determined and found to correspond to a sequence between base pairs 4,671,318 and 4,672,706 of the P. aeruginosa PAO1 chromosome (The Pseudomonas Genome Project identifies this gene as PA4175) (1Bodey G.P. Bolivar R. Fainstein V. Jadeja L. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1983; 5: 27Google Scholar). The protease IV gene is located in a 1388-bp open reading frame, encoding a protein of 463 amino acids (17Caballero A.R. Thibodeaux B.A. Marquart M.E. Moreau J.M. Traidej M. O'Callaghan R.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: S739Google Scholar). Similar to elastase B, this protein consists of three domains: signal sequence, propeptide domain, and mature protease. Protease IV is synthesized as a pre-proenzyme that is processed intracellularly and secreted into the extracellular milieu as the mature protease (33Traidej, M., Caballero, A. R., Marquart, M. E., Thibodeaux, B. A., and O'Callaghan, R. J. (2002) Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar). The 26-kDa mature protease is a unique extracellular enzyme that specifically cleaves substrates on the carboxyl side of lysine residues as determined by substrate susceptibility tests. Protease IV is also capable of degrading a variety of host defense proteins including fibrinogen, plasminogen, immunoglobulin G, and the complement proteins C1q and C3. The enzyme can be completely inhibited by a protease inhibitor, tosyl-lysyl-chloromethylketone (13Engel L.S. Hill J.M. Caballero A.R. Green L.C. O'Callaghan R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16792-16797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Protease IV has been implicated as a virulence factor that contributes to the pathogenicity of Pseudomonas keratitis (13Engel L.S. Hill J.M. Caballero A.R. Green L.C. O'Callaghan R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16792-16797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 14O'Callaghan R.J. Engel L.S. Hobden J.A. Callegan M.C. Green L.C. Hill J.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Purified protease IV (50–200 ng) induced corneal epithelial damage within 3 h after injection into the corneal stroma and increased the virulence of protease IV-deficient bacteria (19Engel L.S. Hill J.M. Moreau J.M. Green L.C. Hobden J.A. O'Callaghan R.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 662-665PubMed Google Scholar). Protease IV may be involved in the processing mechanism of elastase A (LasA), because it has been reported that a lysine-specific protease of P. aeruginosa converts the LasA proenzyme to the active enzyme (20Kessler E. Safrin M. Gustin J.K. Ohman D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30225-30331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The protease IV gene has been cloned and expressed in Pseudomonas putida providing a more abundant supply of protease than that obtained from the naturally expressed chromosomal P. aeruginosa gene (33Traidej, M., Caballero, A. R., Marquart, M. E., Thibodeaux, B. A., and O'Callaghan, R. J. (2002) Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar). Expression of protease IV in P. putida revealed a protein of 48 kDa containing the three domains of protease IV: a signal sequence, a propeptide, and a mature protease. Also detected was a 45-kDa protein (proenzyme) that contained the propeptide and mature protease domains but not the signal peptide. In an experimental model of keratitis, expression of protease IV byP. putida caused a 3-fold increase in the clinical score of infected eyes relative to eyes infected with P. putidalacking the protease IV gene (33Traidej, M., Caballero, A. R., Marquart, M. E., Thibodeaux, B. A., and O'Callaghan, R. J. (2002) Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar). The present study was undertaken to study the sequence of protease IV relative to other bacterial proteases and to determine the amino acid residues of protease IV responsible for the enzymatic activity. Included in this study is the synthesis and testing of multiple site-directed mutants involving residues proposed to comprise the catalytic site of protease IV. Escherichia coli strain DH5α was grown at 37 °C in LB broth (1.0% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1.0% NaCl, pH 7.0). When appropriate, carbenicillin (100 μg/ml) was incorporated into the medium for plasmid selection. P. aeruginosa strain PA103-29 was cultivated in tryptic soy broth (Difco, Detroit, MI) or M9 minimal medium containing 50 mmmonosodium glutamate, 1 mm MgSO4, and 1% glycerol. Growth of bacterial cultures was performed at 37 °C as described previously (13Engel L.S. Hill J.M. Caballero A.R. Green L.C. O'Callaghan R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16792-16797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). E. coli strain DH5α was purchased from Invitrogen. P. aeruginosa strain PA103-29 was kindly provided by Dr. P. V. Phibbs, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC. Strain PA103-29 was originally described by Dr. D. E. Ohman (16Ohman D.E. Cryz S.J. Iglewski B.H. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 836-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pUCP20 was obtained from Dr. J. A. Hobden, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI and originally described by Dr. S. E. West (21West S.E.H. Schweizer H.P. Dall C. Sample A.K. Runyen-Janexky L.J. Gene. 1994; 128: 81-86Crossref Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was accomplished by the overlap extension method using PCR (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The protease IV gene was obtained by amplifying the structural gene from the chromosome of P. aeruginosa strain PA103-29 using the GC-rich PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) under the following conditions: 3 min at 95 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C for denaturing, 30 s at 60 °C for annealing, 2 min at 72 °C for extension and ending with an incubation at 72 °C for 7 min. For generating mutations in the protease IV gene, two pairs of primers were used to direct the synthesis of two fragments, each inclusive of an overlapping region containing a replacement of His-72, His-116, Asp-122, Ser-197, Ser-198, or Ser-200 with an Ala residue (Table I). The two PCR products, with an overlap of 27 base pairs at one end of each fragment, were then combined for the second round of PCR designed to amplify the entire protease IV gene. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify the protease IV gene with recognition sites for the restriction enzyme EcoRI at the locus coding for the N-terminal amino acids and the restriction enzyme BamHI site at the locus coding for the C-terminal amino acids. A 1388-base pair fragment of the PCR products was ligated into a PCR cloning vector (TOPO TA cloning; Invitrogen) and transformed into chemically competent TOP10 E. coli as described by the manufacturer. Plasmid DNA was purified from transformants, and the protease IV gene was excised from the cloning vector by EcoRI/BamHI restriction digestion. The EcoRI/BamHI DNA fragment containing the protease IV gene was subcloned into pUCP20 and transformed into electrocompetent E. coli DH5α. The resulting plasmids with the protease IV gene and with a replacement of His-72, His-116, Asp-122, Ser-197, Ser-198, or Ser-200 were designated pPIV, pH72, pH116, pD122, pS197, pS198, and pS200, respectively. These plasmids were sequenced to verify the presence of correct mutations.Table IOligonucleotide primers used in PCR and DNA sequencingTarget sitePrimer IPrimer IICloningHis-725′ TGGTCGGCCGCGGCCTGCATCGAGGAC 3′5′ GTCCTCGATGCAGGCCGCGGCCGACCA 3′His-1165′ GCGAATATCCTGGCGCGCGACGCGAAG 3′5′ CTTCGCGTCGCGCGCCAGGATATTCGC 3′Asp-1225′ GACGCGAAGCGCGCCACCCTGCTGCTG 3′5′ CAGCAGCAGGGTGGCGCGCTTCGCGTC 3′Ser-1975′ GTCGAAGGCGGCGCGTCCGGCTCGGGC 3′5′ GCCCGAGCCGGACGCGCCGCCTTCGAC 3′Ser-1985′ GAAGGCGGCTCGGCCGGCTCGGGCCTG 3′5′ CAGGCCCGAGCCGGCCGAGCCGCCTTC 3′Ser-2005′ GGCTCGTCCGGCGCGGGCCTGCTGACC 3′5′ GGTCAGCAGGCCCGCGCCGGACGAGCC 3′Protease IV5′ CGGAATTCCATGCATAAGCGAACGTACCTGAAT 3′5′ GGATCCTCAGGGCGCGAAGTAGCGGGAGAT 3′ SequencingHis-725′ GTCTTCAGGAGCTCGGCGGACGGC 3′His-116, Asp-1225′ GACGCTGCAGACCATCTGGTTCTA 3′Ser-197, Ser-198, Ser-2005′ GGCAGTGGGCGTCACCTACGACGG 3′ Open table in a new tab Purification of plasmid DNA was performed by the alkali lysis method using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Large-scale plasmid preparations were performed by Qiagen Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). For purification of the intracellular wild-type and mutated protease IV, plasmid-containingE. coli was grown at 37 °C in 2 liters of LB medium. Cells were pelleted, washed three times, and resuspended in 50 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Cells were ruptured by sonication (Branson Sonifier 250; Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT). Intact cells were removed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The extracts were dialyzed overnight against 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.4. The dialyzed supernatant was applied to a CM cation exchange matrix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and was washed with 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.4. A pH gradient, generated by mixing 10 mmammonium acetate buffer at pH 9.0 with 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer at pH 6.4, was used to elute the protein. The eluted fractions containing protease IV were assayed by Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal antiserum prepared against a recombinant form of mature protease IV (33Traidej, M., Caballero, A. R., Marquart, M. E., Thibodeaux, B. A., and O'Callaghan, R. J. (2002) Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar). The reactive fractions were pooled and then concentrated to 1.0 ml using a stirred ultrafiltration cell with a 10-kDa cutoff filter membrane (YM10; Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 molecular sieve matrix (AmershamBiosciences). The fractions were eluted with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, and assayed by immunoblotting. Positive fractions were pooled and concentrated to 1.0 ml. Total protein was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). The purity of the sample was determined by 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining (Bio-Rad). The purification of extracellular protease IV was performed using the method of Engel et al. (13Engel L.S. Hill J.M. Caballero A.R. Green L.C. O'Callaghan R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16792-16797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), as modified by Traidej et al. (33Traidej, M., Caballero, A. R., Marquart, M. E., Thibodeaux, B.

Protease IV activity was determined by the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate, Chromozym PL (tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-nitroanilide; Sigma), as described by O'Callaghan et al. (14O'Callaghan R.J.

End point reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min or as stated in each experiment. Kinetic analysis was performed at 25 °C by reading the optical density every 2 min for 30 min to measure the increase in optical density per min (ΔA/min). One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that caused an optical density increase at 410 nm of 1A/min under the assay conditions. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and electroblotted by standard laboratory methods (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum prepared against a recombinant form of mature protease IV was the primary antibody, and detection of immune complexes was done with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). For N-terminal sequence analysis, proteins were electrotransferred from SDS-polyacrylamide gel to Sequi-blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). N-terminal amino acids were determined by Core Laboratories, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA. The amino acid sequence of mature protease IV was subjected to a Blastp search against the Microbial Genomes database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) for related proteins. The three proteases found to be related to protease IV were endoproteinase Arg-C (44% identity) of Lysobacter enzymogenes, lysyl endopeptidase (31% identity) of L. enzymogenes, andAchromobacter protease I (30% identity) ofAchromobacter lyticus (Fig. 1). These three proteins are classified as serine proteases and, like protease IV, cleave substrates containing a lysine residue (12Wilderman P.J. Vasil A.I. Johnson Z. Wilson M.J. Cunliffe H.E.

Both protease IV and these related proteases are synthesized as proenzymes that are subsequently processed to mature extracellular forms (24Tsunasawa S. Masaki T. Hirose M. Soejima M. Sakiyama F. J.

The active site of Achromobacter protease I, like that of trypsin and chymotrypsin (30Dodson G. Wlodawer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 347-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), is described as a catalytic triad consisting of histidine, aspartic acid, and serine (31Norioka S. Ohta S. Ohara T. Lim S. Sakiyama F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17025-17029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active site sequences of these proteases are similar to sequences in the mature protease IV. Based on these sequence similarities, the catalytic triad of protease IV is suggested to be comprised of His-72, Asp-122, and Ser-198. In addition, six cysteines of protease IV are also aligned with those of the other related proteases. Based on similarities to theA. lyticus protease I positioning of disulfide bonds, the disulfide bonds present in protease IV are anticipated to align as indicated in Fig. 1. To analyze the protease IV enzyme in terms of the amino acid residues comprising its active site, site-directed mutations were introduced into cloned copies of the protease IV gene for each of the following amino acids: His-72, His-116, Asp-122, Ser-197, Ser-198, and Ser-200. The amino acids (histidine and serine, as well as aspartic acid) were substituted with alanine to eliminate functional groups from the enzyme at the selected positions. Successful mutation of the protease IV gene at each chosen site was verified by DNA sequencing (data not shown). To examine the effect of active site mutations on the enzymatic activity of protease IV, culture supernatants of E. coliexpressing wild-type and mutated forms of protease IV were analyzed for their ability to hydrolyze a lysine-containing substrate, Chromozym PL.E. coli expressing wild-type protease IV possessed high proteolytic activity as demonstrated by chromogenic substrate cleavage (Table II). Mutants with protease IV sequence substitutions of alanine at residues His-116 or Ser-200 showed similar protease activity comparable with that of E. coliexpressing wild-type protease IV. In contrast, mutants with an alanine substitution at His-72, Asp-122, Ser-197, or Ser-198 displayed an insignificant amount of proteolytic activity. These findings suggest that the proposed catalytic triad constituents (His-72, Asp-122, and Ser-198), as well as Ser-197, are essential for the proteolytic activity of protease IV.Table IIProteolytic activity of site-directed mutants of protease IVCulture supernatantsProtease IVSpecific activityRelative activityunits/mg × 10 −2%PIV (wild-type)126.6100Vector alone<1.02-aSignificantly different fromE. coli/pPIV (p < 0.0001).<0.82-aSignificantly different fromE. coli/pPIV (p < 0.0001).His-72<1.02-aSignificantly different fromE. coli/pPIV (p < 0.0001).<0.82-aSignificantly different fromE. coli/pPIV (p < 0.0001).His-116115.391.1Asp-122<1.02-aSignificantly different fromE. coli/pPIV (p < 0.0001).<0.82-aSignificantly different fromE. coli/pPIV (p < 0.0001).Ser-197<1.02-aSignificantly different fromE. coli/pPIV (p < 0.0001).<0.82-aSignificantly different fromE. coli/pPIV (p < 0.0001).Ser-198<1.02-aSignificantly different fromE. coli/pPIV (p < 0.0001).<0.82-aSignificantly different fromE. coli/pPIV (p < 0.0001).Ser-200121.896.2Aliquots of concentrated supernatants of E. coli/pPIV,E. coli/pUCP20 (vector alone), E. coli/pH72,E. coli/pH116, E. coli/pD122, E. coli/pS197, E. coli/pS198, and E. coli/pS200 were reacted with the chromogenic substrate, Chromozym PL, for 30 min.

The protease IV activity was determined from the optical density reading at 410 nm. The specific activity was calculated as described in the text. Specific activity assays were performed in triplicate. To determine the effect of alanine substitutions on protease IV processing, the presence of wild-type and mutated protease IV gene products in cell lysates was examined by immunoblotting using rabbit anti-mature protease IV antibodies. For the wild-type protease IV gene expressed in E. coli, the findings were similar to those detected previously for protease IV expression in P. putida; that is, the mature protease (26 kDa), as well as intracellular proteins of 48 and 45 kDa, were present (Fig. 2) (33Traidej, M., Caballero, A. R., Marquart, M. E., Thibodeaux, B. A., and O'Callaghan, R. J. (2002) Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar). The 48-kDa protein has been reported to be the full-length protease IV gene product (pre-proenzyme), and the 45-kDa protein is a proenzyme inclusive of the propeptide and the 26-kDa mature protease domains but lacking the signal sequence (33Traidej, M., Caballero, A. R., Marquart, M. E., Thibodeaux, B. A., and O'Callaghan, R. J. (2002) Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar). Unlike the wild-type protease IV, each mutated protease IV gene product with an alanine substitution at an amino acid proposed to be part of the catalytic triad (His-72, Asp-122, or Ser-198) was not processed intracellularly to the 26-kDa mature form but instead remained in the 48-kDa pre-proenzyme and 45-kDa proenzyme forms. This finding is consistent with the possibility that the 45-kDa proenzyme form of wild-type protease IV undergoes autoprocessing to separate the propeptide and the mature protease domains. The mutation at Ser-197, the residue located next to Ser-198 of the proposed catalytic triad, also caused an accumulation of the 48-kDa pre-proenzyme and 45-kDa proenzyme forms. However, mutations at either His-116 or Ser-200 did not result in an accumulation of the 48-kDa pre-proenzyme or 45-kDa proenzyme forms and did allow the processing of the protein to the mature protease form of 26 kDa. These results indicate that His-72, Asp-122, Ser-197, and Ser-198 of mature protease IV, but not His-116 or Ser-200, are amino acid residues that are not only essential for proteolytic activation of protease IV but also play a crucial role in autoprocessing of the proenzyme. To further characterize the alanine-substituted protease IV mutations,E. coli carrying pH72, which lacked protease activity, andE. coli harboring pH116, whose protease activity was retained, were used as sources for purification of intracellular protease IV. E. coli carrying pH72 contained a protein of 45 kDa whereas cells carrying pH116 contained a protein of 26 kDa (Fig. 3). The 26-kDa protein of pH116 had an N-terminal amino acid sequence of AGYRDGFGAS, which was identical to that of the mature protease IV of P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, the N-terminal amino acid sequence obtained from the purified 45-kDa protein of pH72 was APGASE, matching the amino acid sequence of protease IV beginning at position 25 of the full-length protease IV. The APGASE sequence suggests that the cleavage site for signal peptidase is located between amino acid residues 24 and 25. The purified proteins of 45 and 26 kDa were analyzed for protease activity by the Chromozym PL assay, and only the 26-kDa mature protease was enzymatically active (data not shown). There was a possibility that mutations at His-72, Asp-122, Ser-197, or Ser-198 caused a conformational change in the proenzyme form of protease IV that rendered it resistant to proteolytic processing from the proenzyme form to the mature 26-kDa form. To test this possibility, the 45-kDa proenzyme of the His-72 mutant was purified and then incubated in vitro for 1 h with the 26-kDa mature protease IV (0.1 μg) purified from P. aeruginosa PA103-29 culture supernatants. The samples were analyzed by immunoblotting, and the proteolytic activity was determined by using the Chromozym PL substrate. Incubation of the His-72 proenzyme alone did not induce protein processing into the mature protease form as evidenced by the 45-kDa band that was present after incubation (Fig. 4). Incubation of the His-72 proenzyme in the presence of active protease IV resulted in the disappearance of the 45-kDa protein. Furthermore, incubation of the His-72 proenzyme with heat-inactivated protease IV failed to cause the disappearance of the His-72 45-kDa protein. The liberation of the His-72 mature protease domain (with alanine substituted for histidine at position 72) caused no increase in the total protease IV activity (data not shown). These results on the His-72 mutant suggest that the 45-kDa proenzyme with an alanine substitution was not resistant to the proteolytic cleavage that naturally occurs in the production of the mature protease IV domain. The ability of this proenzyme to be cleaved into the 26-kDa protein lacking proteolytic activity is consistent with the proposal that the mutated amino acid is part of the active site of protease IV. This study determined sequence similarities between protease IV and other bacterial proteases specific for lysine residues and, based on sequence similarities, predicted three amino acids, histidine 72, aspartic acid 122, and serine 198, that likely comprise the catalytic triad of protease IV. This prediction was supported by site-directed mutagenesis that demonstrated a dramatic loss of enzymatic activity resulting from mutation in any of these three residues. These results also revealed that the junction of amino acids 24–25 is the site of cleavage by a signal peptidase that removes the signal sequence from the full-length pre-proenzyme, leaving the proenzyme intact. The results also demonstrate that protease IV undergoes autodigestion to liberate the mature protease from the 45-kDa proenzyme containing both the propeptide and mature protease domains. The protease IV gene mutated at any of the proposed active site amino acids produced both the pre-proenzyme (48 kDa) and the proenzyme (45 kDa) that were not processed to the mature protease (26 kDa). Pre-proenzyme and proenzyme were produced in cells with the wild-type protease IV gene, but these native proteins, unlike the mutant proteins, were processed naturally into the enzymatically active protease IV. The failure of the mutated proenzymes to be processed into mature proteases is apparently because of their loss of the functional catalytic site and not to the inaccessibility of the lysine cleavage site to the mature protease IV. Protease IV purified from P. aeruginosa appeared to be capable of digesting the mutated proenzyme into a 26-kDa protein that, unlike wild-type mature protease, lacked enzyme activity because of its alanine substitution at position 72. These results demonstrate that a mutation at a single amino acid needed for the proposed catalytic site did not cause the proenzyme to misfold into an unfavorable conformation for proteolytic cleavage at the position between the propeptide and mature protease domains. These findings infer that the natural separation of the propeptide from the mature protease is a result of autoprocessing involving the cleavage of the 45-kDa proenzyme at the lysine residue present at the junction between the propeptide and the mature protease domains. The significant role of the proposed catalytic triad of protease IV in proteolytic activity is in agreement with findings for related serine proteases (24Tsunasawa S. Masaki T. Hirose M. Soejima M. Sakiyama F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3832-3839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Dodson G. Wlodawer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 347-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 31Norioka S. Ohta S. Ohara T. Lim S. Sakiyama F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17025-17029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the catalytic triad, serine at position 197 of protease IV also showed a crucial role in processing and enzyme activity. This amino acid is located adjacent to Ser-198, a constituent of the proposed catalytic triad. To date, the three-dimensional structure of protease IV has not been resolved. Our prediction that the catalytic triad of protease IV consisting of His-72, Asp-122, and Ser-198 was originally based on an alignment of the primary structure of protease IV with other lysine-specific endoproteases. A possibility is that Ser-197 could be a constituent of the catalytic triad instead of Ser-198. However, when the amino acid sequence of mature protease IV was compared with the mammalian serine proteases (trypsin and chymotrypsin), Ser-197 and Ser-198 of protease IV aligned with Asp-194 and Ser-195 of trypsin and chymotrypsin, respectively. X-ray crystallography revealed that Asp-194 of trypsin has an important role in the structural conformation whereas Ser-195 was part of the catalytic triad of trypsin and chymotrypsin (28Birktoft J.J. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 68: 187-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 32Stroud R.M. Kay L.M. Dickerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 83: 185-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The Asp-194 residue forms a salt bridge with Ile-16 near the N terminus that helps establish the proper conformation for the enzymatic activity of trypsin and chymotrypsin. Ser-197 of protease IV, like Asp-194 of trypsin and chymotrypsin, could be responsible for the proper folding of protease IV. Therefore, an amino acid substitution at Ser-197 could result in a structural change that would alter the folding of the tertiary structure of protease IV into the correct active form and could prevent enzymatic activity. Based on the similarity between protease IV and other bacterial serine proteases, speculation can be offered regarding the disulfide bonds in protease IV. The positions of all six cysteines of protease IV are aligned to cysteines in the amino acid sequences of other related proteases. Critical to the structure of Achromobacterprotease I is the disulfide bond that forms between the most distant cysteines (i.e. Cys-6 and Cys-216) (24Tsunasawa S. Masaki T. Hirose M. Soejima M. Sakiyama F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3832-3839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protease IV has cysteines in similar positions (Cys-13 and Cys-220) that could function to stabilize protease IV in an enzymatically active form. This possibility is consistent with the sensitivity of protease IV activity to the reducing agent, β-mercaptoethanol (13Engel L.S. Hill J.M. Caballero A.R. Green L.C. O'Callaghan R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16792-16797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In summary, we have determined the essential amino acid residues of protease IV that affect the catalytic activity. The processing of protease IV from a 45-kDa proenzyme to the secreted mature protease IV was dependent upon the catalytic activity of protease IV, demonstrating that protease IV undergoes autoprocessing in the P. putidasystem presented here. The processing of protease IV could be augmented by other proteases in a P. aeruginosa system. We have also identified the cleavage site for the signal peptidase that converts the 48-kDa pre-proenzyme to the 45-kDa proenzyme. The determination of the three-dimensional structure of protease IV is still needed to gain a better understanding of the structure/function relationship of protease IV.

The transport of ricin from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus, measured as sulfation of a modified ricin (ricin sulf-1), increased in RIIα-expressing cells when PKA was activated. However, not only endosome-to-Golgi transport, but also retrograde ricin transport to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), measured as sulfation and N-glycosylation of another modified ricin (ricin sulf-2), seemed to be increased in cells expressing RIIα in the presence of a cAMP analog, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP. Thus, PKA type IIα seems to be involved in both endosome-to-Golgi and Golgi-to-ER transport. Because ricin, after being retrogradely transported to the ER, is translocated to the cytosol, where it inhibits protein synthesis, we also investigated the influence of RIIα expression on ricin toxicity. In agreement with the other data obtained, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP and RIIα were found to sensitize cells to ricin, indicating an increased transport of ricin to the cytosol.

Tasken K. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D678-D693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of cAMP signal transduction, it has been demonstrated that the subcellular localization of protein kinase A (PKA)1 is important for the specificity (1Skalhegg B.S. Tasken K. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D678-D693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKA is composed of two catalytic (C) subunits and one regulatory dimer (R2) that in the absence of cAMP form an inactive heterotetramer (R2C2). Upon binding of cAMP to the R subunits, the enzyme dissociates and releases two free, active C subunits (2Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The R2 dimer is also implicated in the targeting of different PKA isoforms to various intracellular locations and to specific substrates through interactions with protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (3Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Four different isoforms of the R subunit have been identified as products of separate genes in mammalian cells, and they have been termed RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ (1Skalhegg B.S. Tasken K. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D678-D693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 4Oyen O. Myklebust F. Scott J.D. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 246: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). They all contain two C-terminal cAMP binding sites, a hinge region that interacts with and inhibits the catalytic subunit, and a dimerization domain responsible for the interaction between the two regulatory subunits that make up the regulatory dimer of PKA (2Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Whereas RI subunits are known to be mainly soluble, RII subunits are primarily associated with cytoskeletal elements and membranes (1Skalhegg B.S. Tasken K. Front.

Studies of several human cell lines have revealed that the PKA type IIα isozyme (containing RIIα and Cα) is concentrated in centrosomes and in Golgi-associated compartments (5Keryer G. Skalhegg B.S. Landmark B.F. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Martin M.E. Hidalgo J. Vega F.M. Velasco A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3869-3878PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, PKA type IIβ (containing RIIβ) is associated more selectively with the centrosomal region and not with Golgi structures (5Keryer G. Skalhegg B.S. Landmark B.F. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Based on the important role of the Golgi apparatus in intracellular transport and protein sorting and the localization of PKA, which previously has been implicated in vesicle-mediated protein transport processes (7Pimplikar S.W.

Holm P.K. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18607-18615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility existed that a distinct Golgi-associated pool of PKA type IIα isozyme was involved in regulation of transport through this organelle. To investigate whether PKA type IIα is involved in the regulation of retrograde transport, we studied the transport of the plant toxin ricin. Ricin belongs to a family of plant and bacterial toxins that enter cells via the endocytic pathway. The toxin is transported retrogradely through the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before it enters the cytosol, where it inhibits protein synthesis (11Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 949-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 12Sandvig K. van Deurs B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5943-5950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ricin consists of an A-chain and a B-chain that are linked by a disulfide bridge. The B-chain binds to terminal galactose in both glycolipids and glycoproteins at the plasma membrane, whereas the A-chain enzymatically inhibits the protein synthesis after entry into the cytosol (12Sandvig K. van Deurs B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5943-5950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because ricin binds to both glycolipids and glycoproteins at the plasma membrane, it will be endocytosed by any vesicle that pinches off. Once ricin is endocytosed, it can be transported through the endosomal compartments, recycled back to the plasma membrane, delivered to the lysosomes, or transported retrogradely to the TGN and to the ER (11Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 949-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar,12Sandvig K. van Deurs B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5943-5950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we took advantage of a RIIα-deficient B lymphoid cell line, Reh (13Tasken K. Skalhegg B.S. Solberg R. Andersson K.B. Taylor S.S. Lea T. Blomhoff H.K. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21276-21283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and reintroduced RIIα by making stable transfectants with a Golgi-associated pool of PKA type IIα to examine the effect on intracellular transport. We used two different ricin constructs to monitor the retrograde toxin transport. Within the Golgi apparatus, recombinant ricin with a tyrosine sulfation site (ricin sulf-1) becomes radiolabeled in the presence of radioactive sulfate (14Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This has made ricin sulf-1 a valuable tool to study intracellular transport to the TGN. A recombinant ricin construct with a sulfation site and three overlapping N-glycosylation sites (ricin sulf-2) is both modified in the TGN and N-glycosylated in the ER (14Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). TheN-glycosylation of the toxin results in a molecular shift that can be observed on SDS-PAGE. This construct has therefore been used to study intracellular transport to the ER. As shown in the present study, the expression of PKA type IIα (RIIα) on a negative background in a lymphoid cell line leads to modulation of the retrograde transport of ricin, indicating a regulatory role for Golgi-associated PKA type IIα on these transport steps.

Rabbit anti-human RIIα and RIIβ polyclonal antibodies and mouse anti-RIIα monoclonal antibodies have been described elsewhere (5Keryer G. Skalhegg B.S. Landmark B.F. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).

The cis Golgi marker GM130 was obtained from BD Biosciences. The trans Golgi marker TGN46 was obtained from Serotec (Oxford, UK). A human B-lymphoid cell line (Reh) stably transfected with pMep4 vector (clone pMep) or RIIα under direction of the human metallothionein IIA promoter (clone RIIα) (15Carlson C.R. Witczak O. Vossebein L. Labbé J.-C. Skålhegg B.S. Keryer G. Herberg F.W. Collas P. Tasken K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3243-3254PubMed Google Scholar) was maintained under standard conditions (5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% (v/v) FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Every third month, the cells expressing RIIα were incubated under standard conditions in the presence of 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. On the day that the experiments were performed, the cells were seeded into Eppendorf tubes at a density of 8 × 105 cells/tube. The cells were washed twice with HEPES medium (bicarbonate-free Eagle's minimum essential medium buffered with 20 mm HEPES to pH 7.4), and then incubated with the same medium for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were then incubated in the presence or absence of 350 μm8CPT-cAMP for 30 min before 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml of ricin were added to the cells, which were further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were incubated thereafter with HEPES medium containing 1 μCi/ml [3H]leucine for 20 min at 37 °C, extracted with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid for 10 min followed by a brief wash with the same solution. Subsequently, cells were dissolved in 0.1m KOH, and the acid-precipitable radioactivity was measured. The results are presented as percentage of radioactivity incorporated in cells incubated without toxin. The concentration of ricin required to inhibit the protein synthesis by 50% was chosen as a measure of the sensitivity of cells to ricin. Variation between duplicate measurements was less than 15%. Recombinant ricin A-sulf-1 and ricin A-sulf-2, modified to contain a tyrosine sulfation site and both a tyrosine sulfation site and three overlappingN-glycosylation sites, respectively, were expressed, purified, and reconstituted with ricin B-chain (ricin sulf-1 and ricin sulf-2, respectively) according to the procedure described previously (14Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice in sulfate-free RPMI 1640 medium that contained 2 mm l-glutamine, and then incubated with 0.1 mCi/ml Na235SO4 in the same medium for 3 h. The cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of 350 μm 8CPT-cAMP and/or 20 μg/ml cycloheximide for 30 min at 37 °C, before ricin sulf-1 or ricin sulf-2 (∼300 ng/ml) was added. The incubation was continued for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice for 5 min at 37 °C with HEPES medium that contained 0.1 m lactose followed by cold PBS (140 mm NaCl and 10 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2). The cells were thereafter lysed (lysis buffer, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm aprotinin, pH 7.4), and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-ricin antibodies immobilized on protein A-Sepharose. The beads were then washed twice with PBS containing 0.35% (v/v) Triton X-100, and the immunoprecipitated material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12%) under reducing conditions. SDS-PAGE was carried out in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol as described previously (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). The gels were fixed in 4% acetic acid (v/v) and 27% (v/v) methanol for 30 min and then incubated with 1 m sodium salicylate, pH 5.8, in 2% (v/v) glycerol for 30 min. The dried gels were then exposed to Kodak XAR-5 films (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C for autoradiography. For analysis of ricin distribution, ricin was labeled with Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coverslips were coated with poly(d-lysine) (M r = 150 000) as described previously (17Huang W.M. Gibson S.J. Facer P., Gu, J. Polak J.M. Histochemistry. 1983; 77: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with HEPES medium before addition of Cy5-labeled ricin (∼1000 ng/ml). After incubating the cells for 30 min at 37 °C, they were washed with cold PBS and further incubated with 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed 3 times with PBS before incubation with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 dissolved in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the cells were washed in PBS, and incubated with PBS containing 5% (v/v) FCS for 30 min. The permeabilized cells were incubated with rabbit anti-human RIIα (1:1000) or with mouse mAb CTR 433 (1:10) to label the medial Golgi compartment, with mouse mAb GM130 (1:1000) to label the cis Golgi, or with sheep anti-human TGN46 (1:100) to label the trans Golgi in PBS containing 5% (v/v) FCS for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed three times for 5 min with PBS containing 5% (v/v) FCS followed by incubation with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (1:100) to detect CTR 433 and GM130, with Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:500) to detect RIIα, or with FITC-labeled donkey anti-sheep/goat antibody (1:100) to detect TGN46 in PBS containing 5% (v/v) FCS. After staining, the cells were washed three times for 5 min with PBS at room temperature, and the coverslips were mounted in Mowiol. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using a Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) confocal microscope. Images were captured with a resolution of 1024 × 768 pixels and prepared with the use of Adobe Photoshop 4.0 (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). For analysis of PKA distribution versus centrosomal marker, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 37 °C, rinsed twice in PBS, and incubated for 10 min with 50 mmammonium chloride in PBS. Subsequently, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS with 0.2% BSA. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 3% BSA to concentrations of 140 ng/ml for mAb CTR 453 (a centrosomal marker), 100 ng/ml for rabbit anti-human RIIα, 500 ng/ml for rabbit anti-human RIIβ, and 1 μg/ml for mouse anti-RIIα mAb and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times in PBST (PBS with 1% Tween 20) to remove unbound antibodies followed by incubation with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (FITC and Texas Red) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the cells were mounted in CITIFLUOR (Citifluor, London, UK). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Sarastro 2000 confocal microscope (Amersham Biosciences), equipped with an argon laser (488 to 514 nm wavelength). Ten sections of 0.25 μm (averaging five full frames of the same section) were scanned, and stacks of optical sections for each data set were compiled with Voxel View software on an IRIS 4D-70 GT graphics work station (SGI, Mountain View, CA). Ricin was125I-labeled according to the procedure described by Fraker and Speck (18Fraker P.J. Speck J.C., Jr. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 5 × 104cpm/ng. The intracellular accumulation of 125I-labeled ricin was measured after 2 h at 37 °C as the amount of toxin that could not be removed by lactose treatment, as described previously (19Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Exp. Cell Res. 1979; 121: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The cells were preincubated with 350 μm 8CPT-cAMP for 30 min at 37 °C. The endocytosis of ricin was measured using the ORIGEN analyzer (IGEN Inc., Rockville, MD). Ricin was labeled with N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-activated tris(bipyridine) chelated ruthenium(II) TAG (IGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and simultaneously biotinylated with reducible immunopure NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce). The cells were washed with HEPES medium and then incubated in the presence or absence of 350 μm 8CPT-cAMP for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by addition of TAG-labeled ricin (25 ng/ml) to allow endocytic uptake of the toxin for 30 min at 37 °C. Half of the samples were then treated with 0.1m MESNA for 1 h on ice (20Smythe E. Redelmeier T.E. Schmid S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the other half of the samples was washed in cold PBS. The cells were then lysed (lysis buffer, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm HEPES, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) for 10 min on ice. Ricin that is both TAG-labeled and biotinylated can be detected in the lysate by using streptavidin-conjugated beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) and the ORIGEN analyzer (IGEN Inc.). The endocytosis of TAG-labeled ricin was measured as the amount of toxin that could not be removed by MESNA treatment as described previously (21Skretting G. Torgersen M.L. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3899-3909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of PKA subunits by Northern blot analysis or [32P]8-azido-cAMP photoaffinity labeling and immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described previously (13Tasken K. Skalhegg B.S. Solberg R. Andersson K.B. Taylor S.S. Lea T. Blomhoff H.K. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21276-21283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study effects related specifically to expression of RIIα, stably transfected cell lines expressing RIIα under control of the zinc-inducible type IIa metallothionein promoter were made together with control clones transfected with empty plasmid by selection on hygromycin B. Fig. 1 shows characterization of one clone expressing RIIα compared with a control clone. The RIIα transfected clone displayed high levels of RIIα mRNA (A) as well as a cAMP-binding protein, immunoreactive with RIIα antibodies and present in both the soluble S200 and detergent-soluble Tx-100 fractions (B). In contrast, a control-transfected clone did not have any detectable RIIα mRNA or protein. Both cell clones had equal levels of RIIβ mRNA. We conclude that the RIIα-transfected clone expresses RIIα at quite high levels even in the absence of zinc. It has previously been shown that RIIα is localized to the Golgi-centrosomal area in SaOS2 osteosarcoma cells and in COS-7 cells (5Keryer G. Skalhegg B.S. Landmark B.F. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Martin M.E. Hidalgo J. Vega F.M. Velasco A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3869-3878PubMed Google Scholar). We have examined, by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, whether this was also the case when RIIα was expressed in Reh cells. Double staining of the centrosomal marker CTR 453 (22Bailly E. Doree M. Nurse P. Bornens M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3985-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) (Figs. 2, A,C, and E) and RIIα (Figs. 2, B,D, and F) demonstrated that RIIα was absent in wild-type cells (Fig. 2 B), but appeared in the centrosomal region when expressed (Fig. 2, D and F versus C and E). Furthermore, the distribution of RIIα was wider than that of the centrosomal protein CTR 453 (Fig. 2, F versus E). Because RIIβ is targeted to centrosomes and present in Reh cells, as in most cancer cell lines [Fig. 1; Ref. 5Keryer G. Skalhegg B.S. Landmark B.F. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we next examined the distribution of RIIα versus that of RIIβ by dual staining and image overlays (Fig. 2 G). Again, RIIα (red) was found in a wider area than RIIβ (green, overlap seemsyellow), which in separate experiments showed a distribution overlapping well with that of the centrosomal marker, CTR 453 (not shown). In addition, we performed immunofluorescence studies of the localization of RIIα and the Golgi markers GM130 and TGN46. As shown in Fig. 3, RIIα was partially colocalized with both Golgi markers. Together, these experiments demonstrated that clones expressing RIIα acquired a new PKA isozyme that localizes in the centrosomal-Golgi region. To explore the function of this particular pool of Golgi-associated PKA, we next examined the intracellular transport of ricin in Reh cells in the presence and absence of a Golgi-associated pool of PKA type IIα.Figure 3RIIα expressed in an RIIα-deficient, B lymphoid cell line, Reh, colocalizes with Golgi markers. RIIα cells were fixed, permeabilized, double stained with hRIIα antibodies (red,A and D) and with the cis Golgi marker GM130 (green, B) or the trans Golgi marker TGN46 (green, E), and analyzed in a confocal microscope. Merged images are shown in C andF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether one or more steps along the intracellular route followed by ricin are affected by RIIα, we tested the sensitivity to ricin of clone RIIα cells with and without the stimulation of PKA and compared it with that of cells deficient in PKA type IIα (clone pMep). To activate PKA, we used a cell-permeable cAMP analog, 8CPT-cAMP, with high affinity for the type II regulatory subunits (23Ogreid D. Ekanger R. Suva R.H. Miller J.P. Doskeland S.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 24Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, cells expressing RIIα were ∼2-fold more sensitive to ricin than the RIIα-deficient cells, and although addition of 8CPT-cAMP had a sensitizing effect on the pMep cells, it sensitized the cells expressing RIIα to a much larger extent. Similar experiments with untransfected cells (Reh), as well as with other clones transfected with RIIα with similar targeting, showed the same pattern of sensitivity (results not shown). Thus, RIIα regulates one or several steps on the route of ricin to the cytosol in lymphoid cells, although RIIα is not strictly required for ricin intoxication. To study the transport of ricin from the plasma membrane to the Golgi apparatus, recombinant ricin sulf-1 that contains a tyrosine sulfation site was used. The cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 8CPT-cAMP and ricin sulf-1 (Fig. 5). Because the protein synthesis was somewhat stimulated in cells preincubated with 8CPT-cAMP, and an increased transport of newly synthesized proteins through the TGN could in theory result in an increased competition for sulfation and thus interfere with the assay; some cells were also incubated with cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis. Fig. 5C shows that the sulfation of ricin in control cells increased by ∼70% in the presence of 8CPT-cAMP, whereas the sulfation increased by ∼120% in the cells expressing RIIα. However, in cells treated with both 8CPT-cAMP and cycloheximide, the sulfation of ricin increased by ∼80% in the control cells and by ∼250% in the RIIα-expressing cells. This result indicates that when PKA is activated, the transport of ricin to the Golgi apparatus is increased to a larger extent in cells expressing RIIα than in control cells. To further investigate the transport of ricin to the ER, recombinant ricin sulf-2 that contained a tyrosine sulfation site and three overlapping N-glycosylation sites was used. When ricin sulf-2 was added to control cells (clone pMep) or to RIIα-expressing cells (clone RIIα) in the presence of radioactive sulfate and immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, two bands were visible (Figs. 6, A andB). The upper molecular weight band represents ricin that has been both sulfated and glycosylated, and the lower molecular weight band represents ricin that has only been sulfated. As shown in Fig. 6C, the amount of ricin in the ER, measured as sulfated and glycosylated ricin relative to the total amount of sulfated ricin, was significantly increased in cells expressing RIIα (clone RIIα) compared with the control cells (clone pMep) when PKA was activated by 8CPT-cAMP. These observations indicate that not only the transport of ricin to the Golgi apparatus but also the further transport of the toxin to the ER is increased by RIIα in the presence of 8CPT-cAMP. The increased sulfation of ricin sulf-1 and ricin sulf-2 observed in cells expressing RIIα compared with control cells deficient in RIIα could be caused by an increased binding and endocytosis of ricin or by an increased endosome-to-Golgi transport. We therefore investigated the endocytosis of ricin in the presence or absence of 8CPT-cAMP. Fig. 7 demonstrates that the accumulation of ricin after 2 h of incubation was not significantly changed by addition of 8CPT-cAMP or by the expression of RIIα. Similar data were obtained when the cells were incubated with ricin for 30 min (results not shown). In addition, the binding of ricin to the plasma membrane was not significantly altered by 8CPT-cAMP or by expression of RIIα (data not shown). Thus, the increased transport of ricin to the Golgi apparatus cannot be accounted for by a change in the endocytosis of ricin. As evident from Figs. 2 and 3 and previous reports (5Keryer G. Skalhegg B.S. Landmark B.F. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), RIIα mainly exhibits a perinuclear, Golgi-associated localization that is detergent-extractable, indicating membrane-associated localization. To investigate whether RIIα is associated with ricin-containing structures, immunofluorescence studies were performed using antibodies raised against human RIIα (Fig. 8 A, visualized by Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies, red), Cy5-labeled ricin (Fig. 8 B, blue), and the medial Golgi marker CTR 433 (Fig. 8 C, visualized by FITC-labeled secondary antibodies,green). Both RIIα and ricin seemed colocalized (Fig. 8 F) and were also found to partly colocalize with the medial Golgi marker (Fig. 8, D and E, respectively). It has been reported that both the type IIα and IIβ regulatory subunits are associated with centrosomes (5Keryer G. Skalhegg B.S. Landmark B.F. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because the previous experiment showed colocalization between ricin and RIIα, we investigated the distribution and localization of ricin in the centrosomal area. We showed that whereas minor amounts of RIIα are present in centrosomes, no ricin was detected in this region (data not shown). In the present study, we have investigated the influence of the Golgi-associated type IIα regulatory subunit of PKA on the intracellular transport of ricin. RIIα was expressed on a negative background, and 8CPT-cAMP was used to activate PKA. Because phenotypic differences between clones may arise (e.g. relating to incorporation in the genomic DNA), we investigated several clones expressing RIIα with similar results. Different clones transfected with empty vector displayed a phenotype similar to that of wild-type cells. The first indication that RIIα might be involved in regulation of intracellular transport was found by investigating the entry of the plant toxin ricin into the cytosol, measured as ricin toxicity. Even when PKA was not activated by addition of external 8CPT-cAMP, the cells expressing RIIα were about 2-fold more sensitive to ricin than the control cells. The most likely explanation seems to be that there is a certain level of endogenous cAMP that partly activates PKA. This explanation was strengthened by the finding that the transfected cells were about 4-fold more sensitive to ricin than the control cells when PKA was activated by addition of external 8CPT-cAMP. Also, the control cells were shown to be slightly more sensitive to ricin when PKA was activated. This might be caused by the activation of other isozymes of PKA that also regulate intracellular transport but, apparently, less efficiently than PKA type IIα. The PKA type IIα might be a better regulator than the other PKA isozymes because it is closer to the vesicular route of ricin transport into the Golgi apparatus. It might be a question of the local concentration of PKA whether it serves as a good regulator. It has previously been shown that addition of 8-bromo-cAMP to Madin-Darby canine kidney cells gives a selective stimulation of the transport of apically internalized ricin to the Golgi apparatus (25Llorente A. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (Fig. 9). However, in those cells, we cannot ascribe this regulation to a Golgi-located PKA. We here demonstrate that the sulfation of ricin is increased in cells expressing RIIα compared with control cells when PKA was activated by externally added 8CPT-cAMP. This result indicates that RIIα is a strong regulator of the transport of ricin from the plasma membrane to the Golgi apparatus. Earlier studies have demonstrated that calmodulin (26Llorente A. Garred Ø. Holm P.K. Eker P. Jacobsen J. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and calcium (27Lauvrak S.U. Llorente A. Iversen T.G. Sandvig K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3449-3456PubMed Google Scholar) can modulate the transport of ricin from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus in other cell lines (Fig. 9). Clearly, different factors are involved in the regulation of retrograde transport. Interestingly, confocal microscopy demonstrated a localization of both ricin and RIIα in the Golgi area. The difference in ricin sulfation was much larger when both cell types were preincubated in the presence of cycloheximide. Such experiments were performed because the protein synthesis was somewhat stimulated in cells incubated with 8CPT-cAMP (data not shown), and an increased transport of newly synthesized proteins through the TGN in theory could result in an increased competition for sulfation. Even though it cannot be excluded that cycloheximide might result in an increased transport of ricin to the Golgi apparatus, the increased sulfation of ricin that was observed in cells expressing RIIα compared with the control cells in the presence of 8CPT-cAMP and cycloheximide strongly supports the notion of a regulatory role of RIIα in intracellular transport from the plasma membrane to the Golgi apparatus. The increased transport of ricin to the Golgi apparatus in cells expressing RIIα could be caused by increased binding and endocytosis of the toxin. However, no significant stimulation of the binding or the endocytosis of the toxin after 30 min or 2 h of incubation were observed in the RIIα-expressing cells, strongly indicating a selective regulatory role of RIIα in the transport of ricin from the endosomal compartments to the Golgi apparatus and further to the ER. At the moment, we can only speculate about the molecular mechanism of the regulation of the endosome to Golgi transport of ricin by PKA type IIα. There are several examples of the importance of phosphorylation for transport. For example, it has been shown that the activity of PKA has an effect on the in vitro association of ARF1 to Golgi membranes (28Martin M.E. Hidalgo J. Rosa J.L. Crottet P. Velasco A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19050-19059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is possible that upon stimulation, the Golgi-associated PKA type IIα phosphorylates membrane proteins in neighboring compartments that recruit cytosolic proteins involved in the trafficking of ricin between endocytic organelles and the Golgi apparatus. Another possibility is that PKA type IIα is important for the fusion of incoming vesicles with the Golgi apparatus. Transport of ricin not only to the TGN, where the sulfotransferase is located (29Leitinger B. Brown J.L. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8115-8121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but also from the Golgi apparatus to the ER, measured as ricin that has been both sulfated and glycosylated, was shown to increase in cells expressing RIIα relatively to the control cells in the presence of 8CPT-cAMP. An increased amount of glycosylated ricin could have been a result of the stimulated transport to the Golgi apparatus of this toxin. However, the fraction of ricin that has been both sulfated and glycosylated compared with the total amount of sulfated ricin is also increased in cells expressing RIIα in the presence of 8CPT-cAMP, thus indicating an additional regulatory role of RIIα in the transport of ricin from the Golgi to the ER. In conclusion, our results indicate that the Golgi-associated type IIα regulatory subunit of PKA regulates endosome-to-Golgi and Golgi-to-ER transport of ricin in lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1999158873,"22-Oxacalcitriol (OCT) is an analog of calcitriol, characterized by potent differentiation-inducing activity and low calcemic liability. The metabolism of OCT has been studied and its polar metabolites, such as 24/26-hydroxylated-OCT and hexanor-1α,20-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1α,20(OH)2D3), have been identified. In contrast, little is known about the less polar metabolites of OCT, which have been found in relatively large amounts. In this study, thein vitro metabolism of OCT was studied in UMR 106, Caco-2, and LLC-PK1 cells to identify the less polar metabolites and to assess their biological activity. OCT was initially metabolized to three less polar metabolites, 3-epi-OCT and two dehydrates, 25-dehydroxy- 25-ene-22-oxa-1α(OH)D3(25-ene-22-oxa-1α(OH)D3) and 25-dehydroxy-24-ene-22-oxa-1α(OH)D3(24-ene-22-oxa-1α(OH)D3). We also observed further metabolites, the two C-3 epimers of the C-25 dehydrates, 25-ene-3-epi-22-oxa-1α(OH)D3 and 24-ene-3-epi-22-oxa-1α(OH)D3. The structures of these metabolites were successfully assigned by 1H NMR and LC-MS analyses. The three cell lines differ in their ability to metabolize OCT through the C-3 epimerization or the C-25 dehydration pathway. The biological activity of the OCT metabolites assessed by a luciferase reporter gene transcriptional activation system, binding assays for the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), and assays for regulatory activities of cell differentiation and proliferation was found to be lower than that of OCT. Thus, both the C-3 epimerization and C-25 dehydration may work to reduce the biological activity of OCT. 22-Oxacalcitriol (OCT) is an analog of calcitriol, characterized by potent differentiation-inducing activity and low calcemic liability.

We also observed further metabolites, the two C-3 epimers of the C-25 dehydrates, 25-ene-3-epi-22-oxa-1α(OH)D3 and 24-ene-3-epi-22-oxa-1α(OH)D3. The structures of these metabolites were successfully assigned by 1H NMR and LC-MS analyses. The three cell lines differ in their ability to metabolize OCT through the C-3 epimerization or the C-25 dehydration pathway. The biological activity of the OCT metabolites assessed by a luciferase reporter gene transcriptional activation system, binding assays for the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), and assays for regulatory activities of cell differentiation and proliferation was found to be lower than that of OCT. Thus, both the C-3 epimerization and C-25 dehydration may work to reduce the biological activity of OCT. 25(OH)2D3, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 22-oxacalcitriol (22-oxa-1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) 20(OH)2D3, hexanor-1α,20-dihydroxyvitamin D3 25-dehydroxy-24-ene-22-oxa-1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 vitamin D receptor vitamin D-binding protein (Gc-globulin) high performance liquid chromatography liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry phosphate-buffered saline fetal calf serum The hormonal form of vitamin D3, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1α,25(OH)2D3 or calcitriol)1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of calcium metabolism but it also regulates cell growth and differentiation in a variety of normal and malignant cells (1Abe E.

To overcome this problem, vitamin D analogs with enhanced differentiation/anti-proliferative and reduced hypercalcemic properties have been synthesized. OCT is a synthetic analog, which has an oxygen atom at position 22, and has received government approval for use as an agent for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism and psoriasis in Japan. OCT is rapidly cleared from the circulation due to its extremely low affinity for DBP (9Kobayashi T. Tsugawa N. Okano T. Masuda S. Takeuchi A. Kubodera N. Nishii Y. J.

Masuda S. Takeuchi A. Kobayashi T. Nishii Y. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitam. 1989; 35: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, OCT inhibits growth of psoriatic fibroblasts and enhances the immune response more effectively than 1α,25(OH)2D3 (12Morimoto S. Imanaka S. Koh E. Shiraishi T. Nabata T. Kitano S.

In contrast, OCT has reduced calcemic effects both in terms of mobilizing calcium from bone and in stimulating intestinal calcium transport in vitamin D-deficient and normal rats (14Tsugawa N.

These factors such as metabolic clearance, tissue-specific distribution, cellular uptake, intracellular metabolism, and transcriptional regulation could contribute to differences in biological activity. Recently, the metabolism of OCT has been studied in primary parathyroid cells (17Brown A.J. Berkoben M. Ritter C. Kubodera N. Nishii Y. Slatopolsky E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and keratinocytes (18Bikle D.D. Abe-Hashimoto J., Su, M.J. Felt S. Gibson D.F.C. Pillai S. J. Invest.

In all these systems, OCT is degraded into hydroxylated and side-chain truncated metabolites, 1α,20(OH)2D3 and hexanor-20-oxo-1α-hydroxyvitamin D3(20-oxo-1α(OH)D3). However, despite relatively large amounts of products from OCT (19Masuda S. Byford V. Kremer R. Makin H.L.J. Kubodera N. Nishii Y. Okazaki A. Okano T. Kobayashi T. Jones G. J. Biol.

In the case of 1α,25(OH)2D3, one of these less polar metabolites has been identified as 3-epi-1α,25(OH)2D3, in which a hydroxyl group at C-3 of the A-ring is epimerized from the β to the α position (20Masuda S.

There are multiple aims of this study as follows: to identify the less polar metabolites of OCT including 3-epi-OCT in a rat osteosarcoma cells (UMR 106 cells); to investigate the further metabolism of OCT metabolites; to compare the production rate of OCT metabolites in UMR 106, human colon carcinoma cells (Caco-2) and porcine kidney cells (LLC-PK1); and to examine the biological activity of OCT metabolites. Our findings provide clear evidence that OCT is metabolized to at least three, and possibly five, less polar metabolites through two novel pathways, namely the C-3 epimerization and C-25 dehydration pathways in addition to the well-known C-23/C-24/C-26 hydroxylation pathways in target cells. OCT and its putative metabolite 24-ene-22-oxa-1α(OH)D3 were synthesized by Kuboderaet al. of Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan. The synthesis and unambiguous stereochemical assignment of 24-ene-22-oxa-1α(OH)D3 will be described elsewhere. 2N. Kubodera, manuscript in preparation.3-epi-OCT and 3-epi-1α,25(OH)2D3 were synthesized by Hatakeyama et al. of Nagasaki University, Japan. 1α,25(OH)2D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) were obtained from Solvay-Duphar Co. (Weesp, The Netherlands). 1α,25(OH)2[26,27-methyl-3H]D3(6.6 TBq/mmol) and 25(OH) [23,24(n)-3H]D3(3.0 TBq/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Culture media and antibiotics were purchased from Invitrogen. Deuterized chloroform (CDCl3, 99.8%, NMR analytical grade) was purchased from EURISO-TOP (Gif-Sur-Yvette, France). Organic solvents of HPLC grade were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. UMR 106, Caco-2, and LLC-PK1cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). UMR 106 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Caco-2 cells were maintained in Eagle's Medium containing 10% FCS and 1% non-essential amino acids. LLC-PK1 cells were maintained in Medium 199 containing 5% FCS. All culture media contained penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air, and the medium was changed every three days. In the experiments described below, OCT or 3-epi-OCT was added to culture medium in ethanolic solution, the final ethanol concentration in the medium never exceeding 0.1% (v/v). For structure assignments, 10 plates of UMR 106 cells cultured in 150-mm culture dishes were used. Monolayers were washed with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium (PBS(−)) and then incubated in 10 ml of media containing 1% bovine serum albumin, in the presence of 10 μm OCT or 3-epi-OCT for 48 h at 37 °C. The no-cell control consisted of 10 ml of the medium and 10 μm OCT or 3-epi-OCT was incubated for the same length of time. For measurement of amounts of OCT and 3-epi-OCT metabolites, three plates each of UMR 106, LLC-PK1, and Caco-2 cells cultured in 150-mm culture dishes were used. For time-course studies, the cells were incubated with 5 μm substrates for periods of time ranging from 1 to 48 h. For dose-response studies, the cells were incubated with increasing amounts (0.1–10 μm) of substrates for 24 h. Lipid extraction was performed according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1957; 37: 911-917Crossref Scopus (42694) Google Scholar) as modified by Makin et al. (26Makin G. Lohnes D. Byford V. Ray R. Jones G. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Lipid was extracted from cells and media with methanol and dichloromethane. The organic layer was evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen, redissolved in hexane/2-propyl alcohol/methanol (HIM), (88:10:2, v/v/v), and subjected to purification by HPLC. Analytical HPLC of metabolites was carried out using a model 600 pump and a model 996 photodiode array detector (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). Separation of metabolites was initially achieved using a Zorbax SIL column (4.6 × 250 mm, Dupont Instruments, Wilmington, DE) eluted with HIM (88:10:2) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Samples with peaks representing a typical chromophore based on the vitamin D cis-triene structure (λmax, 265 nm, λmin, 228 nm) were collected and evaporated to dryness, then redissolved in HIM (88:10:2). These were further purified on the same HPLC system using a Zorbax CN column (4.6 × 250 mm, Dupont Instruments) eluted with HIM (88:10:2) at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. After further purification with the same previous HPLC system, the metabolites were pure enough for LC-MS and1H NMR analyses. Concentrations of the metabolites in ethanol were determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient, ε265 of 18,000. The 500-MHz1H NMR spectra of the metabolites of OCT or 3-epi-OCT were measured on a Varian VXR-500 (1H: 499.9 MHz). Purified metabolites (2–5 μg) were dissolved in 40 μl of CDCl3 with a very small amount of CHCl3(7.24 ppm, used as an internal standard for 1H NMR spectroscopy) and transferred into a nanoprobe. Two-dimensional spectra were obtained as described previously (27Kamao M. Tatematsu S. Reddy G.S. Hatakeyama S. Sugiura M. Ohashi N. Kubodera N. Okano T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitam. 2001; 47: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). LC-MS analysis was carried out on a QUATTROII (Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source in the positive ion mode. The HPLC system consisting of a MAGIC2002 Micro-LC full system (Michrom Bio Resources, Inc.) and a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (2.0 × 150 mm, NOMURA CHEMICAL, Tokyo, Japan) was used. As the mobile phase, methanol, 10 mm ammonium acetate (50:50, v/v; A) and methanol, 10 mm ammonium acetate (98:2, v/v; B) were used, and a linear gradient elution was run from an A/B ratio of 65:35 to 20:80, at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The column temperature was maintained at 40 °C. Mass spectra were obtained by averaging each peak and subtracting the background. Displacement of 1α,25(OH)2[3H]D3 from calf-thymus cytosol receptors (Yamasa Co. Ltd., Chiba, Japan) by OCT and its metabolites was determined as described elsewhere (19Masuda S. Byford V. Kremer R.

Solutions containing 500 μl of the calf thymus cytosol receptor prepared with phosphate buffer (0.3 m KCl, 0.05m K2HPO4, 0.05 mKH2PO4, pH 7.4) were mixed with increasing amounts of 1α,25(OH)2D3 (0.0078–64 pg/tube), OCT (0.5–1024 pg/tube), 3-epi-OCT (32–16384 pg/tube), 25-ene-22-oxa-1α(OH)D3 (8–32768 pg/tube) or 24-ene-22-oxa-1α(OH)D3 (8–32768 pg/tube) in 20 μl ethanol, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 20 °C. Next, 34 fmol of 1α,25(OH)2[3H]D3 in 25 μl of ethanol was added, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 20 °C. The addition of 200 μl of dextran/charcoal (0.05% dextran T-150/0.5% Norit A Charcoal Decolorizing Neutral) in freshly prepared phosphate buffer (0.05 mNa2HPO4, 0.05 mNaH2PO4, pH 7.4) was used to separate the bound and free forms of 1α,25(OH)2[3H]D3. The assay tubes were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Each supernatant was collected in 500 μl and transferred into a scintillation vial to measure radioactivity. Competitive displacement of 25(OH) [3H]D3from vitamin D-deficient rat serum DBP by OCT and its metabolites was determined under equilibrium ligand-binding conditions (19Masuda S. Byford V. Kremer R. Makin H.L.J. Kubodera N. Nishii Y. Okazaki A. Okano T. Kobayashi T. Jones G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8700-8708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A total of 82 fmol of 25(OH) [3H]D3 in 50 μl of ethanol was mixed with increasing amounts of 25(OH)D3(0.003125–16 ng/tube), 1α,25(OH)2D3(0.24–4000 ng/tube) or OCT metabolites (0.06–1000 ng/tube) in 100 μl of ethanol. Next, 1 ml of vitamin D-deficient rat serum diluted 1:70,000 with freshly prepared barbital acetate buffer (3.5 mm acetic acid, 3.5 mm sodium barbiturate, 0.13m NaCl, 0.1% ovalbumin, pH 8.6) was added, and the samples were incubated on ice for 1 h. To separate the bound and free forms of 25(OH) [3H]D3, 500 μl of dextran/charcoal (0.025% dextran T-150/0.25% Norit A charcoal decolorizing neutral) in freshly prepared barbital acetate buffer was used. The assay tubes were vortexed and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, 1.0 ml of each supernatant was collected and transferred into a scintillation vial to measure radioactivity. The human osteosarcoma cell line MG-63 (ATCC) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% dextran-coated charcoal-treated FCS. Cells (2 × 105) were suspended in 2 ml of the medium and transfected with 0.5 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid (pGVB2 vector, Toyo Ink Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) carrying a human osteocalcin gene promoter (−848/+10) including the VDRE (28Ozono K. Liao J. Kerner S.A. Scoot R.A. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21881-21888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a ratCYP24 gene promoter (−291/+9) including the two VDREs (29Ohyama Y. Ozono K. Uchida M. Yoshimura M. Shinki T. Suda T. Yamamoto O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30381-30385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and 0.25 μg of the pRL-CMV vector (pGVB2 vector, Toyo Ink Co., Ltd.) as an internal control. The transfection agent used was Tfx-50 reagent (Promega Corp. Madison, WI). The cells were incubated with 10−9 or 10−8m1α,25(OH)2D3 or OCT compounds for 48 h. The luciferase activity of the cell lysates was measured with a luciferase assay system (Toyo Ink Co., Ltd.). Transactivation measured by luciferase activity was standardized with the luciferase activity of the same cells determined by the Sea Pansy luciferase assay system as a control (Toyo Ink Co., Ltd.) (30Lorenz W.W. McCann R.O. Longiaru M. Cormier M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Each set of experiments was repeated at least three times. The human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) were kindly provided by Dr. M. Inaba of Osaka City University Medical School. The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% dextran-coated charcoal-treated FCS and kanamycin (0.06 mg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. For synchronization at the S phase, cells (4 × 106) were cultured in 30 ml of RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h and subsequently cultured for 16 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2.5 mm thymidine. After washing with PBS(−) twice, the cells were cultured in normal medium for 10 h and then in 2.5 mm thymidine medium for 16 h. The cells thus obtained were used for flow cytometry. The cells (105 cells/well) were placed in 24-well tissue culture plates and cultured for 3 days with OCT or its metabolites (10−9, 10−8m). Each group of cells was washed with PBS(−) and resuspended in PBS(−) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 100 μg of RNase, then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS(−) and incubated with 0.5 ml of DNA-staining solution containing propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 20 min. The cells were analyzed with a flow cytometer equipped with an argon laser (488 nm, Becton Dickinson FACScanTM), and cell cycle distribution was analyzed by ModiFiT LT (Verity). For analysis of cell surface CD11b antigen expression, HL-60 cells (105 cells/well) were cultured for 3 days with OCT or 3-epi-OCT metabolites (10−9, 10−8m) under the same conditions as for flow cytometry. Each group of cells was washed with PBS(−), and the cells (2 × 105 cells) were resuspended in 100 μl of diluent solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% sodium azide. Then the cells were incubated with 10 μl of human monoclonal fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated CD11b antibody (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed once with diluent solution and then fixed in 300 μl of PBS(−) containing 2% paraformaldehyde. Fluorescence was detected by a Becton Dickinson FACScanTM at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. Results were recorded as the mean fluorescence index, which is the product of the percent fluorescence and the mean fluorescence intensity, with 104 cells being counted per treatment. Each set of experiments was repeated at least three times. Values were calculated as means ± S.E. Significance levels were determined by Student's ttest. Incubation of 10 μm OCT with UMR 106 cells for 48 h resulted in the formation of 5 metabolites (Fig. 1 A), all of which demonstrated the typical vitamin D chromophore (λmax of 265 nm, λmin of 228 nm; data not shown). These metabolites were not formed when OCT was incubated with medium in the absence of cells, or when cells were incubated with medium alone (data not shown). 2 of 5 metabolites, labeled Metabolites 4 and 5, were polar metabolites of OCT and identical to the previously identified 1α,20(OH)2D3 and 24-hydroxy-OCT (24(OH)OCT), respectively (19Masuda S. Byford V. Kremer R. Makin H.L.J. Kubodera N. Nishii Y. Okazaki A. Okano T. Kobayashi T. Jones G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8700-8708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Three other less polar metabolites, labeled Metabolites 1, 2, and 3 have not been isolated and identified to date and were thus purified by extensive rechromatography twice on Zorbax CN and Zorbax SIL for structure assignments. The 1H chemical shifts and coupling constants assigned by one-dimensional and two-dimensional COSY and NOESY spectra of Metabolite 1 are summarized in TableI. The most pronounced differences between the 1H NMR spectra of Metabolite 1 and OCT were found in the 1.6–1.8 ppm and 4.6–4.8 ppm regions. The disappearance of one of the singlets from the methyl protons in position 26 or 27 (observed at 1.21 and 1.23 ppm in OCT) and the appearance of two singlets at 4.70 and 4.74 ppm, which were assigned to protons of the exo-methylene group, were observed. These findings indicate that dehydration took place at the C-25 hydroxyl group. The resonances from H-24 (2.23 ppm) were shifted downfield compared with those of OCT (1.71 ppm). In the two-dimensional COSY spectrum, cross-peaks of the neighboring protons were detected. Connectivity of the H-23 and 23′ (3.33 and 3.63 ppm) to the H-24 resonance (2.23 ppm) was observed. The other cross-peaks observed in two-dimensional COSY analysis are shown in Fig. 2 A. Metabolite 1 was assigned to 25-ene-22-oxa-1α(OH)D3, which has an OCT-like structure with an additional exo-methylene group at the end of the side-chain as a result of dehydration at the C-25 hydroxyl group of OCT. In the LC-MS spectrum of Metabolite 1, [M+NH4]+ was observed atm/z 418.6 and indicated a reduction of 18 mass units from OCT (Table I). Metabolite 1 gave peaks atm/z 401.6 [M+H]+ and 423.7 [M+Na]+. Therefore, the LC-MS spectrum supports the assignment of Metabolite 1 structure by 1H NMR analysis.Table I1H-NMR and LC-MS analyses of OCT and 3-epi-OCT metabolitesCompound1H-NMR analysis, 1H chemical shifts and coupling constants (chemical shifts: ppm, coupling constants: Hz)LC-MS analysis, characteristic ionsH-1H-3H-6H-7H-19H-23H-24H-26,27m/zSynthetic standards OCT4.414.216.356.004.975.313.463.821.711.21 1.23441.7 [M + Na]+(1H, m)(1H, m)(1H, d, J = 11.5)(1H, d, J = 11.0)(1H, m)(1H, m)(1H, td, J = 5.5, 9.5)(1H, td, J = 5.0, 9.5)(2H, t, J = 5.5)(3H, s) (3H, s)436.7 [M + NH4]+419.6 [M + H]+ 3-epi-OCT4.314.046.416.004.975.273.463.821.711.21 1.23441.7 [M + Na]+(1H, m)(1H, m)(1H, d, J = 12.0)(1H, d, J = 11.5)(1H, m)(1H, m)(1H, td, J = 5.5, 9.0)(1H, td, J = 6.0, 9.0)(2H, t, J = 5.5)(3H, s) (3H, s)436.7 [M + NH4]+419.6 [M + H]+ 24-ene-22-oxa-4.414.216.366.014.985.313.794.015.321.64 1.71423.7[M + Na]+ 1α(OH)D2(1H, m)(1H, m)(1H, d, J = 11.5)(1H, d, J = 11.5)(1H, m)(1H, m)(1H, dd, J = 7.0, 11.0)(1H, dd, J = 6.5, 11.0)(1H, m)(3H, s) (3H, s)418.6 [M + NH4]+401.6 [M + H]+OCT Metabolites Metabolite 14.424.216.366.014.985.313.333.632.231.72 4.70 4.74423.7[M + Na]+(1H, m)(1H, m)(1H, d, J = 11.0)(1H, d, J = 11.0)(1H, m)(1H, m)(1H, td, J = 7.5, 9.0)(1H, td, J = 7.0, 9.0)(2H, td, J = 6.0, 6.3)(3H, s) (1H, s) (1H, s)418.6[M + NH4]+401.6[M + H]+ Metabolite 24.424.216.366.014.985.313.794.015.321.84 1.71423.7[M + Na]+(1H, m)(1H, m)(1H, d, J = 10.5)(1H, d, J = 11.0)(1H, m)(1H, m)(1H, dd, J = 6.0, 10.5)(1H, dd, J = 7.0, 11.5)(1H, m)(3H, s) (3H, s)418.6[M + NH4]+401.6[M + H]+ Metabolite 34.314.036.416.004.985.283.463.821.711.21 1.23441.7[M + Na]+(1H, m)(1H, m)(1H, d, J = 11.5)(1H, d, J = 11.5)(1H, m)(1H, m)(1H, td, J = 5.5, 8.5)(1H, td, J = 5.5, 9.0)(2H, t, 5.5)(3H, s) (3H, s)436.7[M + NH4]+419.6[M + H]+3-epl-OCT Metabolites Metabolite 1′4.314.056.416.014.985.283.333.642.231.72 4.70 4.74423.7[M+Na]+(1H, m)(1H, m)(1H, d, J = 11.5)(1H, d, J = 11.5)(1H, m)(1H, m)(1H, td, J = 7.5, 9.0)(1H, td, J = 6.5, 9.0)(2H, td, J = 5.0, 6.5)(3H, s) (1H, s) (1H, s)418.6[M+NH4]+401.6[M + H]+ Metabolite 2′4.304.046.416.014.985.283.794.015.321.64 1.71423.7[M + Na]+(1H, m)(1H, m)(1H, d, J = 11.5)(1H, d, J = 11.0)(1H, m)(1H, m)(1H, dd, J = 7.0, 11.0)(1H, dd, J = 7.5, 11.5)(1H, m)(3H, s) (3H, s)418.6[M + NH4]+401.6[M + H]+ Open table in a new tab The 1H NMR spectrum of Metabolite 2 also showed an unchanged structure of ring A, containing the triene system (Table I). The resonance from H-24 (5.32 ppm) was changed in contrast with that of OCT (1.71 ppm). The intensity of the H-24 signal was found to be only half of the expected value. Two singlets from the methyl protons in positions 26 and 27 (1.64 and 1.71 ppm) were shifted downfield compared with those of OCT (1.21 and 1.23 ppm). The resonances from H-23 and 23′ (3.79 and 4.01 ppm) were also shifted downfield. These findings indicate that an olefin group was introduced between C-24 and C-25, and only one proton atom at H-24 remained in Metabolite 2. In the two-dimensional COSY spectrum, cross-peaks showing connectivity between the neighboring protons were clearly observed (Fig. 2 B). The signal at 1.71 ppm was assigned to the proton of trans position against C-23 (namely, C-26 position) because of the presence of cross-peaks with H-23′ and 24 that demonstrate long range coupling. The signal at 1.64 ppm was also assigned to the proton of cis position against C-23 (namely, C-27 position). The LC-MS spectrum of Metabolite 2 in principle showed the same features as the spectrum of Metabolite 1; [M+NH4]+ was observed atm/z 418.6, suggesting a reduction of 18 mass units from OCT (Table I). Consequently, Metabolite 2 was assigned to 24-ene-22-oxa-1α(OH)D3, a dehydrate of OCT in which a double bond was introduced between the C-24 and C-25 positions by dehydration of the C-25 hydroxyl group of OCT, as was seen in Metabolite 1. 1H NMR and LC-MS"
https://openalex.org/W1994661635,"Abstract We have shown previously that NH binding to the external pore of a Kir2.1 channel induces channel inactivation possibly through conformational changes. In this study, we performed further biophysical analyses of the NH -induced inactivation modeled by a refined kinetic scheme. Also, we investigated the conformational change hypothesis by examining whether the chemical modification of single-cysteine substitution of amino acids located at the internal pore alters the kinetics of the NH -induced inactivation. In addition, we examined whether the mutation of amino acids located at various parts of a Kir2.1 channel influences the NH -induced inactivation. Kir2.1 channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and studied using patch-clamp techniques. The gating of the NH -induced inactivation was affected by mutation of several amino acids located at various regions of the Kir2.1 channel. These results suggest that amino acids from different parts of a Kir2.1 channel are involved in the channel closure. Furthermore, internal chemical modification of several cysteine mutants resulted in the block of inward currents and changes in the on and off rate for the NH -induced inactivation, suggesting that the internal pore mouth is involved in the closure of a Kir2.1 channel. Taken together these results provide new evidence for conformational changes affecting the NH -induced inactivation in the Kir2.1 channel."
