https://openalex.org/W1979226980,"NEWELL has drawn attention to an anomalous increase of about 5° C in the stratospheric temperatures in tropical and mid-latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere since 1963. He suggested a causal relationship between this increase and the eruption of Mount Agung in March 1963, which injected large quantities of volcanic material into the stratosphere2. I wish to draw attention to several publications which have shown that at the same time a breakdown occurred in the quasi-biennial oscillation. This should be considered before Newell's conclusion can be accepted."

https://openalex.org/W2010770883,"MORRISON1 has suggested that quasi-stellar radio sources and pulsars are basically similar phenomena, being analogues in every respect except scale. He has characterized both types of objects as centrally condensed magnetized spinning masses with a luminous lifetime which is governed by the rotational work done on charged particles by their moving magnetic fields. In the spirit of this hypothesis, Morrison has also proposed (private communication) that the name “spinar” be applied to objects such as quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), pulsars, and other highly condensed core objects which may exist in the nuclei of Seyfert galaxies and extragalactic radio sources."

The nature of the powders used and the operative protective mechanisms, however, are complex."
