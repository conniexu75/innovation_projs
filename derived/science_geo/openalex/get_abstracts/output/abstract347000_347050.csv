https://openalex.org/W1979385111,"In the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are processed into single-stranded DNA, triggering ATR-dependent checkpoint signalling and DSB repair by homologous recombination. Previous work has implicated the MRE11 complex in such DSB-processing events. Here, we show that the human CtIP (RBBP8) protein confers resistance to DSB-inducing agents and is recruited to DSBs exclusively in the S and G2 cell-cycle phases. Moreover, we reveal that CtIP is required for DSB resection, and thereby for recruitment of replication protein A (RPA) and the protein kinase ATR to DSBs, and for the ensuing ATR activation. Furthermore, we establish that CtIP physically and functionally interacts with the MRE11 complex, and that both CtIP and MRE11 are required for efficient homologous recombination. Finally, we reveal that CtIP has sequence homology with Sae2, which is involved in MRE11-dependent DSB processing in yeast. These findings establish evolutionarily conserved roles for CtIP-like proteins in controlling DSB resection, checkpoint signalling and homologous recombination."

https://openalex.org/W2000538799,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is an important cause of end-stage renal disease, for which there is no proven therapy. Mutations in PKD1 (the gene encoding polycystin-1) are the principal cause of this disease. The disease begins in utero and is slowly progressive, but it is not known whether cystogenesis is an ongoing process during adult life. We now show that inactivation of Pkd1 in mice before postnatal day 13 results in severely cystic kidneys within 3 weeks, whereas inactivation at day 14 and later results in cysts only after 5 months. We found that cellular proliferation was not appreciably higher in cystic specimens than in age-matched controls, but the abrupt change in response to Pkd1 inactivation corresponded to a previously unrecognized brake point during renal growth and significant changes in gene expression. These findings suggest that the effects of Pkd1 inactivation are defined by a developmental switch that signals the end of the terminal renal maturation process. Our studies show that Pkd1 regulates tubular morphology in both developing and adult kidney, but the pathologic consequences of inactivation are defined by the organ's developmental status. These results have important implications for clinical understanding of the disease and therapeutic approaches."

https://openalex.org/W2056743521,"The genus Sorangium synthesizes approximately half of the secondary metabolites isolated from myxobacteria, including the anti-cancer metabolite epothilone. We report the complete genome sequence of the model Sorangium strain S. cellulosum So ce56, which produces several natural products and has morphological and physiological properties typical of the genus. The circular genome, comprising 13,033,779 base pairs, is the largest bacterial genome sequenced to date. No global synteny with the genome of Myxococcus xanthus is apparent, revealing an unanticipated level of divergence between these myxobacteria. A large percentage of the genome is devoted to regulation, particularly post-translational phosphorylation, which probably supports the strain's complex, social lifestyle. This regulatory network includes the highest number of eukaryotic protein kinase-like kinases discovered in any organism. Seventeen secondary metabolite loci are encoded in the genome, as well as many enzymes with potential utility in industry."

https://openalex.org/W2020766314,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) has been proposed as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases because of its anti-inflammatory action in glial cells. However, PPARgamma agonists preventbeta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced neurodegeneration in hippocampal neurons, and PPARgamma is activated by the nerve growth factor (NGF) survival pathway, suggesting a neuroprotective anti-inflammatory independent action. Here we show that the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone (RGZ) protects hippocampal and dorsal root ganglion neurons against Abeta-induced mitochondrial damage and NGF deprivation-induced apoptosis, respectively, and promotes PC12 cell survival. In neurons and in PC12 cells RGZ protective effects are associated with increased expression of the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein. NGF-differentiated PC12 neuronal cells constitutively overexpressing PPARgamma are resistant to Abeta-induced apoptosis and morphological changes and show functionally intact mitochondria and no increase in reactive oxygen species when challenged with up to 50 microM H2O2. Conversely, cells expressing a dominant negative mutant of PPARgamma show increased Abeta-induced apoptosis and disruption of neuronal-like morphology and are highly sensitive to oxidative stress-induced impairment of mitochondrial function. Cells overexpressing PPARgamma present a 4- to 5-fold increase in Bcl-2 protein content, whereas in dominant negative PPARgamma-expressing cells, Bcl-2 is barely detected. Bcl-2 knockdown by small interfering RNA in cells overexpressing PPARgamma results in increased sensitivity to Abeta and oxidative stress, further suggesting that Bcl-2 up-regulation mediates PPARgamma protective effects. PPARgamma prosurvival action is independent of the signal-regulated MAPK or the Akt prosurvival pathways. Altogether, these data suggest that PPARgamma supports survival in neurons in part through a mechanism involving increased expression of Bcl-2."
https://openalex.org/W1963795540,"Plant survival requires the ability to acclimate to heat. When plants are subjected to heat shock, the expression of various genes is induced, and the plants become tolerant of higher temperatures. We found that transient treatment with geldanamycin and radicicol, two heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors, induced heat-inducible genes and heat acclimation in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Heat shock reduced the activity of exogenously expressed glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Since GR activity depends on HSP90, this suggests that heat shock reduces cytosolic HSP90 activity in vivo. Microarray analysis revealed that many of the genes that are up-regulated by both heat shock and HSP90 inhibitors are involved in protein folding and degradation, suggesting that the activation of a protein maintenance system is a crucial part of this response. Most of these genes have heat shock response element-like motifs in their promoters, which suggests that heat shock transcription factor (HSF) is involved in the response to HSP90 inhibition. Several HSF genes are expressed constitutively in A. thaliana, including AtHsfA1d. Recombinant AtHsfA1d protein recognizes the heat shock response element motif and interacts with A. thaliana cytosolic HSP90, HSP90.2. Overexpression of a dominant negative form of HSP90.2 induced the heat-inducible gene. Thus, it appears that in the absence of heat shock, cytosolic HSP90 negatively regulates heat-inducible genes by actively suppressing HSF function. Upon heat shock, cytosolic HSP90 is transiently inactivated, which may lead to HSF activation. Plant survival requires the ability to acclimate to heat. When plants are subjected to heat shock, the expression of various genes is induced, and the plants become tolerant of higher temperatures.

Upon heat shock, cytosolic HSP90 is transiently inactivated, which may lead to HSF activation. Since plants cannot move or escape to cool places, they have evolved a range of mechanisms that protect them upon exposure to high temperatures. These mechanisms serve to protect the plant from heat-induced tissue damage. One such mechanism involves the accumulation of various types of heat shock proteins (HSPs), 2The abbreviations used are: HSPheat shock proteinGDAgeldanamycinRADradicicolGUSβ-glucuronidaseHSFheat shock transcription factorHSEheat shock response elementTHXthioredoxinGRglucocorticoid receptorMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidRTreverse transcriptionPBSphosphate-buffered salineYFPyellow fluorescent proteinERendoplasmic reticulum including HSP70, HSP90, HSP100/Clp, and small HSP. HSPs play a crucial role in the cell, since they serve as molecular chaperones that not only protect cellular proteins from damage but also refold damaged proteins (1Wang W. Vinocur B. Shoseyov O. Altman A. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 244-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2055) Google Scholar). It has been shown that prior heat shock elevates the cellular levels of HSPs and that this leads to the acquisition of tolerance to high temperatures that are normally lethal (2Hong S.-W. Vierling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4392-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 3Queitsch C. Hong S.-K. Vierling E. Lindquist S.

This so-called heat acclimation phenomenon enables plants to live without wilting in extremely hot environments. Our understanding of the molecular components responsible for heat acclimation remains limited. A deeper knowledge of this process would be useful, since it could lead to the development of agricultural crop plants that are continuously heat-acclimated and therefore resistant to sudden heat-induced damage. heat shock protein geldanamycin radicicol β-glucuronidase heat shock transcription factor heat shock response element thioredoxin glucocorticoid receptor 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid reverse transcription phosphate-buffered saline yellow fluorescent protein endoplasmic reticulum It has been shown that HSF is responsible for the heat-induced activation of HSP genes in various organisms, including plants (5Morimoto R.I.

Scharf K.-D. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 177-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HSF binds to heat shock response element (HSE), which is a specific DNA sequence (nGAAn) observed in HSP gene promoters. The typical HSF-binding site is composed of three HSE repeats (HSE3) that are oriented head-to-head and then tail-to-tail (5Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar, 6Schöffl F. Prandl R. Reindl A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). To bind optimally to HSE3, HSF must form a trimer (9Sorger P.K. Nelson H.C.M. Cell. 1989; 59: 807-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Although animals and yeast have relatively few HSF genes, plants have many HSF homologues that have been classified into three subfamilies, A, B, and C (7Nover L. Scharf K.-D. Gagliardi D. Vergne P. Czarnecka-Verner E. Gurley W.B. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 215-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nover L. Bharti K. Doring P. Mishra S.K. Ganguli A. Scharf K.-D. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 177-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, humans have four homologues, whereas Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster have just one copy each, although Arabidopsis thaliana has 21 homologues. The plant HSF homologues all consist of a highly conserved NH2-terminal DNA-binding domain, a hydrophobic heptad repeat (HR-A/B) region, and a transcriptional activation domain (7Nover L. Scharf K.-D. Gagliardi D. Vergne P. Czarnecka-Verner E. Gurley W.B. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 215-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HR-A/B region is connected to the DNA-binding domain and is responsible for HSF oligomerization, probably due to coiled-coil interactions. The COOH-terminal half of the HSF homologues is variable and includes the activation domain, which recruits transcriptional machineries (7Nover L. Scharf K.-D. Gagliardi D. Vergne P. Czarnecka-Verner E. Gurley W.B. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 215-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nover L. Bharti K. Doring P. Mishra S.K. Ganguli A. Scharf K.-D. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 177-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells constitutively have a pool of HSF proteins, but these proteins do not induce the HSP genes in the absence of heat shock. This indicates that HSF activity is normally negatively regulated. HSF down-regulatory mechanisms have been identified in mammals and yeast, although the mechanisms differ slightly between these two kingdoms. In mammalian cells, HSF1 is maintained in the cytosolic HSP90 complex as a monomer that lacks DNA binding activity (5Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). Upon heat shock, the complex dissociates and releases the HSF1 monomer, because denatured proteins sequester HSP90. The monomer then forms a trimer capable of DNA binding activity (10Zou J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. Cell. 1998; 94: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). In yeast cells, HSF1 is already in its DNA-binding trimeric form in the absence of heat shock but must become hyperphosphorylated by heat shock before it can activate transcription (11Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). However, HSP90 also negatively regulates HSF1 activity in yeast (12Duina A.A. Kalton H.M. Gaber R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18974-18978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). With regard to the HSF down-regulatory mechanism in plants, it has been suggested that HSF is regulated by phosphorylation by a cyclin-dependent kinase CDC2 (13Reindl A. Schöffl F. Schell J. Koncz C. Bako L. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or by binding to HSP70 (14Kim B.-H. Schöffl F. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 367: 371-375Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar), small HSP (15Prot M. Tripp J. Zielinski D. Weber C. Heerklotz D. Winkelhaus S. Bublak D. Scharf K.-D. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), or EMP2 (16Fu S. Meeley R. Scanlon M.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 3119-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, in vivo evidence for these mechanisms in plants remains limited. Although HSPs are responsible for refolding denatured proteins and/or for folding newly synthesized proteins, one of these HSPs, HSP90, also plays an additional role in the regulation of various cellular signaling molecules (17Pratt W.B. Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. Deranco D.B. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 18Picard D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1640-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). For example, HSP90 regulates glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity, and inhibition of HSP90 reduces glucocorticoid perception (17Pratt W.B. Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. Deranco D.B. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 18Picard D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1640-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 19Kovacs J.J. Murphy P.J.M.

Suhre M.H. Wegele H. Buchner J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The primary structure of HSP90 is well conserved in various species. In A. thaliana, there are seven HSP90 homologues that are localized to the cytosol (HSP90.1 (At5g52640), HSP90.2 (At5g56030), HSP90.3 (At5g56010), and HSP90.4 (At5g56000)), mitochondria (At3g07770), chloroplast (CR88 (At2g04030)), and endoplasmic reticulum (SHD/GRP94 (At4g24190)). Among these, four cytosolic HSP90 proteins are highly homologous to each other (86-99% identity). Cytosolic HSP90 is known to be responsible for disease resistance by interacting with the resistance (R) protein, a pathogen receptor; this interaction is crucial for R protein activity in A. thaliana, Nicotiana tabacum, and Nicotiana benthamiana (21Hubert D.A. Tornero P. Belkhadir Y. Krishna P. Takahashi A. Shirasu K. Dangl J.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5679-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 22Takahashi A. Casais C. Ichimura K. Shirasu K. Proc.

Chem. 2004; 279: 2101-2108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Plant cytosolic HSP90 is also involved in chloroplast protein import, since cytosolic HSP90 delivers precursor proteins to the chloroplast import receptor Toc64 (25Qbadou S. Becker T. Mirus O. Tews I. Soll J. Schleiff E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1836-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, it is likely that cytosolic HSP90 also plays other roles in intracellular events in plants, since depletion of HSP90 activity induces a wide variety of morphological changes (21Hubert D.A. Tornero P. Belkhadir Y. Krishna P. Takahashi A. Shirasu K. Dangl J.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5679-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 26Queitsch C. Sangster T.A. Lindquist S.

Bahrami A. Wilczek A. Watanabe E. Schellenberg K. McLellan C. Kelley A. Kong S.W. Queitsch C. Lindquist S. PLoS Biol. 2007; 2: e648Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of two HSP90 inhibitors, geldanamycin (GDA) and radicicol (RAD), on A. thaliana to find another function for cytosolic HSP90. Plant Materials—We used wild type A. thaliana (Columbia accession) and two transgenic A. thaliana lines, one bearing ProHSP90.1:GUS and the other bearing a dexamethasone-inducible luciferase gene (Pro35S:GVG and ProGAL4:Luciferase). Both transgenic lines have been described in detail previously (29Yabe N. Takahashi T. Komeda Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1994; 35: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Aoyama T. Chua N.-H. Plant J. 1997; 11: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). We generated a transgenic A. thaliana line harboring the dexamethasone-inducible dominant negative HSP90.2 gene (Pro35S:GVG and ProGAL4:HSP90.2-D80N). HSP90.2 cDNA was amplified from an expressed sequence tag clone (RZL18h06) obtained from Kazusa DNA Research Institute. The amplified cDNA fragment was introduced into the Gateway entry vector, pDONR221 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dominant negative mutations were introduced into the HSP90.2 gene by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and desired primer sets (see supplemental Table S1). We generated a Gateway binary vector, pTAGW72, from pTA7002 (a gift from N. H. Chua) by using the Gateway Conversion System (Invitrogen). pTA7002 was digested with XhoI, blunted with LA Taq (Takara, Shiga, Japan), and Reading Frame Cassette B was inserted. Binary vectors of mutated HSP90.2 genes were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (EHA105), which was then used to infect A. thaliana (Columbia accession) to make the transgenic line, HSP90.2-D80N. Growth Conditions and Heat and Chemical Treatments—Each well of 96-well microtiter plates received 5-10 surface-sterilized seeds in 150 μl of 0.5× MS liquid medium (0.5× Murashige and Skoog salts, 1.3 mm MES-KOH, pH 5.7). After stratification (4 days at 4 °C), the plates were transferred to an orbital shaker with a 16-h light cycle at 22 °C. After 5 days of growth, the medium was replaced with appropriate treatment media. For heat shock treatment, the seedlings were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. For HSP90 inhibitor treatment, the seedlings were incubated in medium containing 50 μm GDA (Sigma) or 50 μm RAD (Sigma). For cycloheximide treatment, the seedlings were incubated in medium containing 50 μm cycloheximide (Sigma) for 30 min, followed by chemical or heat treatment under the same conditions. To observe high temperature tolerance, the seedlings were incubated at 22 °C for 2 h after each treatment and then incubated at 45 °C for 1 h (2Hong S.-W. Vierling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4392-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 3Queitsch C. Hong S.-K. Vierling E. Lindquist S. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 479-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). For dexamethasone treatment, the seedlings were first subjected to heat shock or HSP90 inhibitors for 30 min before adding 30 μm dexamethasone (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) for 1.5 h. Stock solutions of GDA (1 mg/ml), RAD (1 mg/ml), and dexamethasone (30 mm) were prepared by dissolving the drugs in dimethyl sulfoxide. For β-glucuronidase (GUS) staining, the seedlings were incubated in GUS staining buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 0.5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 1 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-glucuronide) (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) for 30 min. To stop the reaction and remove chlorophyll, the plants were treated with an ethanol series. Reverse Transcription (RT)-Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA, extracted from 10 seedlings by using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan), was dissolved in 25 μl of distilled water. cDNA was synthesized from 5 μl of total RNA solution with Ready-to-Go RT-PCR beads (GE Healthcare). Gene fragments were then amplified by PCR using gene-specific primer sets (see supplemental Table S1). For the primers of HSP90 and HSP70, the conserved sequences of all four A. thaliana cytosolic HSP90 or all six HSP70 are used. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with a SmartCycler (Cepheid, San Diego, CA) and a commercial kit (Ex Taq R-PCR; Takara), as reported previously (31Kamada T. Nito K. Hayashi H. Mano S. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 1275-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 32Yamada K. Fuji K. Shimada T. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant J. 2005; 41: 888-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Microarray Analysis—Microarray analysis was performed as recommended by the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Total RNA was used to produce Cy3-labeled cRNA probes. The labeled probes were hybridized to an Agilent Arabidopsis 3 Oligo Microarray (Agilent Technologies). Feature extraction software (GeneSpring; Agilent Technologies) was used to locate and delineate every spot in the array and to integrate the intensity, filtering, and normalization of each spot. Because HSP90 inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, we removed genes whose expression is affected by dimethyl sulfoxide from the data sets. Finally, we obtained the expression features of 12,656 genes. Expression of Recombinant AtHsfA1d in Bacteria—AtHsfA1d cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR using gene-specific primer sets (see supplemental Table S1) and introduced into the Gateway entry vector pCR8/GW/Topo (Invitrogen). The AtHsfA1d coding region in pCR8/GW/Topo was transferred to pET32a-GW. pET32a-GW was derived from pET32a (Novagen, Madison, WI), which had been modified into a Gateway vector by using the Gateway Vector Conversion System (Invitrogen). The recombinant pET32a-GW vector was then introduced into Escherichia coli (BL21) to produce His-thioredoxin-tagged fusion protein. The recombinant protein (designated as THX-AtHsfA1d) was extracted by 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.3 m NaCl, and 50 mm imidazole and purified with a nickel column. The solvent was replaced with PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 130 mm NaCl) by dialysis. Electron Mobility Shift Assay—A mixture of 4.4 μl of THX-AtHsfA1d (10 μg), 1 μl of biotinylated probe (Bio-HSE3; 5 pmol), and 1 μl of poly(dI-dC) (1 pg) (Sigma) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and subjected to PAGE (5% (w/w) acrylamide) in 1× TBE. For the competition assay, excess amounts of competitor (25 pmol in 1 μl) were added to the mixture. The probe was electrophoretically transferred to a membrane (Hybond-N+; GE Healthcare) and detected by avidin-horseradish peroxidase coupled with the ECL system (GE Healthcare). The oligonucleotide sequences used (see supplemental Table S1) were obtained from a previous paper (33Mishra S.K. Tripp J. Winkelhaus S. Tschiersch B. Theres K. Nover L. Scharf K.-D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1555-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Antibody Production—A partial cDNA fragment of HSP90.2, which encodes the amino acid region 471-574, was amplified by RT-PCR using gene-specific primer sets (see supplemental Table S1) and ligated into the pET32a vector (Novagen) to produce His-thioredoxin-tagged fusion protein in E. coli (BL21). The recombinant proteins in inclusion bodies were dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 8 m urea and purified by nickel column chromatography. Purified proteins were injected into rabbits to raise antibodies. Because the anti-HSP90 anti-serum recognized the His-thioredoxin tag, we passed the anti-serum through a His-thioredoxin column several times until the flow-through fraction no longer recognized His-thioredoxin on immunoblots. Pull-down Assay—Total proteins were extracted from 10 5-day-old A. thaliana seedlings with 20 μl of PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, followed by removal of cell debris by centrifugation. THX-AtHsfA1d (10 μg, about 0.1 nmol) or THX (2.3 μg, about 0.1 nmol) was then added to the extract and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After the addition of 15 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to the extracts, the beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed several times with PBS. Bound proteins were eluted in 15 μl of PBS containing 500 mm imidazole. Then proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nylon membrane, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-HSP90 (1:2000 dilution) or stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation Analysis—cDNAs of A. thaliana HSFs were amplified by RT-PCR using gene-specific primer sets (see supplemental Table S1) and introduced into the Gateway entry vector pCR8/GW/Topo (Invitrogen). These HSF coding regions in pCR/GW/Topo were transferred to the Gateway expression vector, nYFP/pUGW0 (a gift from T. Nakagawa). The construct encodes a fusion protein comprising the amino-terminal half of YFP fused to the amino-terminal side of AtHsfA1d (nYFP-AtHsfA1d). The HSP90.2 coding region in pDONR221 was transferred to the Gateway expression vector, cYFP/pUGW0 (a gift from T. Nakagawa). The construct encodes a fusion protein comprising the carboxyl-terminal half of YFP fused to the amino-terminal side of HSP90.2 (cYFP-HSP90.2). We used the tdTomato gene (a gift from R. Y. Tsien) in the expression vector, ptdGW (a gift from S. Mano) as a marker for positively transformed cells. These plasmid DNAs were bombarded to onion epidermis cells by using the Biolistic Particle Delivery System (Bio-Rad). The onion cells were laid on a 1% (w/v) agar plate containing 1× Murashige and Skoog salts, 1.3 mm MES-KOH, pH 5.7, and incubated at 22 °C in the dark. GDA and RAD were diluted to 50 μm in 0.5× MS liquid medium and applied to the plate. After 1 day, fluorescence was observed under a fluorescent microscope (AxioImager Z1, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a CCD camera (AxioCam HRc; Carl Zeiss). Geldanamycin and Radicicol Induce Heat-inducible Genes in the Absence of Heat Shock—We used two chemicals, GDA and RAD, to investigate the role of HSP90 in the heat shock response of A. thaliana. Although GDA and RAD are structurally unrelated, both inhibit HSP90 function by binding to multiple residues in its highly unusual, evolutionarily conserved nucleotide-binding pocket (34Roe S.M. Prodromou C. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). To test the effect of GDA and RAD treatments on the expression of known heat-inducible genes, we first employed a transgenic A. thaliana line that bears the GUS gene fused to the HSP90.1 heat response promoter (ProHSP90.1:GUS) (29Yabe N. Takahashi T. Komeda Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1994; 35: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). When the transgenic seedlings were treated for 6 h with either chemical at germinating temperature (22 °C), both chemicals induced significantly higher GUS staining compared with the untreated plants (Fig. 1, A and B). As expected, heat shock (37 °C for 2 h) also induced higher GUS staining. Thus, GDA and RAD activate the heat-responsive HSP90.1 promoter as well as heat shock. Since the chemicals still activated the HSP90.1 promoter at concentrations as low as 6.25 μm (Fig. 1B), it appears that the promoter is highly sensitive to the chemicals. To investigate the response of endogenous heat-inducible genes to GDA and RAD treatments, we treated wild-type seedlings with 50 μm of GDA or RAD at 22 °C for 6 h and then subjected their mRNAs to RT-PCR (Fig. 1C). The transcription of cytosolic HSP90, HSP70, and HSP101 was elevated not only by heat shock but also by GDA and RAD treatments, although GDA had a slightly weaker effect than either heat shock or RAD treatment. Lower inhibitor concentrations reduced the accumulation of HSP90 mRNA (Fig. 1D). Thus, GDA and RAD induce the heat shock response in A. thaliana. Heat Shock, Geldanamycin, and Radicicol Induce Genes Responsible for Protein Folding, Synthesis, and Degradation—We used microarray analysis to compare the effects of heat shock, GDA, and RAD treatments on the gene expression profile of A. thaliana seedlings. Of the 12,656 genes that were analyzed, 950, 289, and 2,453 genes were up-regulated more than 2-fold by heat shock, GDA, and RAD treatments, respectively (Fig. 2A). Of these up-regulated genes, 157 were up-regulated by all three conditions (Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S2). Most of these genes are involved in heat shock protein/protein refolding (45 genes, 28.7%), transcription/translation (16 genes, 10.2%), and protein degradation (17 genes, 10.8%) (Fig. 2B). Only a few (six) of the genes were down-regulated by all three treatments (supplemental Table S3), suggesting that inhibition of HSP90 did not reduce gene expression. Thus, heat shock, GDA, and RAD treatments induce genes involved in the quality control of various proteins. Plants Treated with Geldanamycin and Radicicol Acquire High Temperature Tolerance in the Absence of Heat Shock—High temperature tolerance results from the induction of various HSPs after heat shock (2Hong S.-W. Vierling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4392-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 3Queitsch C. Hong S.-K. Vierling E. Lindquist S. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 479-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). We determined the ability of GDA and RAD to induce this tolerance. As expected, 5-day-old wild-type seedlings died when incubated at 45 °C for 1 h, but they survived these conditions if they had been pretreated with heat shock at 37 °C for 2 h (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, we found that when the seedlings were transiently exposed to GDA and RAD at 22 °C for 6 h, they also developed high temperature tolerance (Fig. 3B). Thus, GDA and RAD treatments are sufficient to induce the acquisition of high temperature tolerance. Heat Shock Reduces Cytosolic HSP90 Activity in Vivo—The above data suggest that the reduction in HSP90 activity was responsible for the induction of the heat shock response. On the other hand, heat shock induces the accumulation of denatured proteins, which might cause a transient deficiency in the chaperone activity of such proteins as cytosolic HSP90. To investigate this, we performed an experiment using transgenic A. thaliana seedlings that express the GAL4-VP16-GR (GVG) fusion protein by the Pro35S:GVG gene along with the GAL4 promoter fused to the firefly luciferase (ProGAL4:Luciferase) gene (30Aoyama T. Chua N.-H. Plant J. 1997; 11: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). GVG bears a GR domain and a GAL4 DNA-binding domain; therefore, dexamethasone treatment of the transgenic plants activates the GAL4 promoter, which in turns induces the transcription of luciferase (30Aoyama T. Chua N.-H. Plant J. 1997; 11: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Cytosolic HSP90 binds to the GR domain of the GR and keeps it as an active form. As a result, the ability of GR to perceive dexamethasone is completely dependent on cytosolic HSP90 activity (19Kovacs J.J. Murphy P.J.M. Gaillard S. Zhao X. Wu J.-T. Nicchitta C.V. Yoshida M. Toft D.O. Pratt W.B. Yao T.-P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 601-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 20Wandinger S.K. Suhre M.H. Wegele H. Buchner J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Consequently, these transgenic plants can be used to detect defective cytosolic HSP90 activity. The transgenic plants only expressed luciferase when they had been treated with dexamethasone (Fig. 4). Moreover, as expected, when the plants were treated with GDA or RAD, the dexamethasone-induced expression of luciferase was reduced (Fig. 4). Significantly, heat shock also reduced the dexamethasone-induced expression of luciferase. This suggests that heat shock indeed reduces cytosolic HSP90 activity in vivo. Most of the Heat Shock-, Geldanamycin-, and Radicicol-induced Genes Bear Heat Shock Response Elements—We next addressed how heat shock, GDA, and RAD induce heat-inducible genes. We searched the promoter regions of the 157 up-regulated genes by microarray"
https://openalex.org/W2089268815,"We genetically encoded the photocaged amino acid 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzylserine (DMNB-Ser, 1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to the amber nonsense codon TAG. This amino acid was converted to serine in living cells by irradiation with relatively low-energy blue light and was used to noninvasively photoactivate phosphorylation of the transcription factor Pho4, which controls the cellular response to inorganic phosphate1. When substituted at phosphoserine sites that control nuclear export of Pho4, 1 blocks phosphorylation and subsequent export by the receptor Msn5 (ref. 2). We triggered phosphorylation of individual serine residues with a visible laser pulse and monitored nuclear export of Pho4-GFP fusion constructs in real time. We observed distinct export kinetics for differentially phosphorylated Pho4 mutants, which demonstrates dynamic regulation of Pho4 function. This methodology should also facilitate the analysis of other cellular processes involving free serine residues, including catalysis, biomolecular recognition and ion transport."

https://openalex.org/W1977665741,"Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that maintains function of numerous intracellular signaling nodes utilized by cancer cells for proliferation and survival. Hsp90 is also detected on the plasma membrane of tumor cells and its expression has been suggested to correlate with metastatic potential. Given the abundance and diverse functions of the intracellular pool of this protein, the precise contribution of cell surface Hsp90 to cell motility and tumor metastasis remains to be determined. In this study we utilized the small molecule DMAG-N-oxide, a novel cell-impermeable Hsp90 inhibitor, to specifically examine the role of cell surface Hsp90 in cell motility. We observed that, while not affecting intracellular Hsp90 function, DMAG-N-oxide significantly retarded tumor cell migration and integrin/extracellular matrix-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization. Concomitant with these findings, targeting cell surface Hsp90 significantly inhibited tumor cell motility and invasion in vitro, and had a dramatic impact on melanoma cell lung colonization in vivo. These data indicate that cell surface Hsp90 plays an important role in modulating cancer cell migration that is independent of the function of the intracellular Hsp90 pool, and that small molecule inhibitors of surface Hsp90 may provide a new approach to targeting the metastatic phenotype."

However, the biological functions of TMPRSS4 in cancer are unknown. Here we show, using reverse transcription-PCR, that TMPRSS4 is highly elevated in lung cancer tissues compared with normal tissues and is also broadly expressed in a variety of human cancer cell lines. Knockdown of TMPRSS4 by small interfering RNA treatment in lung and colon cancer cell lines was associated with reduction of cell invasion and cell-matrix adhesion as well as modulation of cell proliferation. Conversely, the invasiveness, motility and adhesiveness of SW480 colon carcinoma cells were significantly enhanced by TMPRSS4 overexpression. Furthermore, overexpression of TMPRSS4 induced loss of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, concomitant with the induction of SIP1/ZEB2, an E-cadherin transcriptional repressor, and led to epithelial-mesenchymal transition events, including morphological changes, actin reorganization and upregulation of mesenchymal markers. TMPRSS4-overexpressing cells also displayed markedly increased metastasis to the liver in nude mice upon intrasplenic injection. Taken together, these studies suggest that TMPRSS4 controls the invasive and metastatic potential of human cancer cells by facilitating an epithelial-mesenchymal transition; TMPRSS4 may be a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2076269475,"Protein metalloenzymes use various modes for functions for which metal-dependent global conformational change is required in some cases but not in others. In contrast, most ribozymes require a global folding that almost always precedes enzyme reactions. Herein we studied metal-dependent folding and cleavage activity of the 8-17 DNAzyme using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Addition of Zn2+ and Mg2+ induced folding of the DNAzyme into a more compact structure followed by a cleavage reaction, which suggests that the DNAzyme may require metal-dependent global folding for activation. In the presence of Pb2+, however, the cleavage reaction occurred without a precedent folding step, which suggests that the DNAzyme may be prearranged to accept Pb2+ for the activity. Neither ligation reaction of the cleaved substrates nor dynamic changes between folded and unfolded states was observed. These features may contribute to the unusually fast Pb2+-dependent reaction of the DNAzyme. These results suggest that DNAzymes can use all modes of activation that metalloproteins use."

https://openalex.org/W2017265065,"Oxygen homeostasis represents an essential organizing principle of metazoan evolution and biology. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a master regulator of transcriptional responses to changes in O2 concentration. HIF-1 is a heterodimer of HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta subunits. O2-dependent degradation of the HIF-1alpha subunit is mediated by prolyl hydroxylase, von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL)/Elongin-C E3 ubiquitin ligase, and the proteasome. O2-independent degradation of HIF-1alpha is regulated by the competition of RACK1 and HSP90 for binding to HIF-1alpha. RACK1 binding results in the recruitment of the Elongin-C E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to VHL-independent ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1alpha. In this report, we show that calcineurin inhibits the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1alpha. Calcineurin is a serine/threonine phosphatase that is activated by calcium and calmodulin. The phosphatase activity of calcineurin is required for its regulation of HIF-1alpha. RACK1 binds to the catalytic domain of calcineurin and is required for HIF-1alpha degradation induced by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A. Elongin-C and HIF-1alpha each bind to RACK1 and dimerization of RACK1 is required to recruit Elongin-C to HIF-1alpha. Phosphorylation of RACK1 promotes its dimerization and dephosphorylation by calcineurin inhibits dimerization. Serine 146 within the dimerization domain is phosphorylated and mutation of serine 146 impairs RACK1 dimerization and HIF-1alpha degradation. These results indicate that intracellular calcium levels can regulate HIF-1alpha expression by modulating calcineurin activity and RACK1 dimerization."
https://openalex.org/W2052886018,"Galectin-1 (Gal-1) is a beta-galactoside-binding protein, the expression of which is increased in endothelial cells on exposure to proinflammatory stimuli. Through binding of several receptors (CD7, CD45, and CD43) Gal-1 is known to induce apoptosis of activated T lymphocytes, an effect thought to mediate the beneficial effects it exerts in various inflammatory models. The data presented here highlights another function for Gal-1, that of a negative regulator of T-cell recruitment to the endothelium under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. We have shown, using siRNA to knockdown Gal-1 in endothelial cells, that endogenous Gal-1 limits T-cell capture, rolling, and adhesion to activated endothelial cells under flow. Furthermore, the reverse effect is observed when exogenous human recombinant Gal-1 is added to activated endothelial monolayers whereby a dramatic reduction in lymphocyte recruitment is seen. These findings are corroborated by studies in Gal-1 null mice in which homing of wild-type (WT) T lymphocytes is significantly increased to mesenteric lymph nodes and to the inflamed paw in a model of delayed-type hypersensitivity. In conclusion, mimicking endothelial Gal-1 actions would be a novel strategy for controlling aberrant T-cell trafficking, hence for the development of innovative anti-inflammatory therapeutics."

In these investigations over 80% of the endocytosed ENaC was recycled to the apical membrane via a cAMP-regulated intracellular channel pool. These findings suggest that ENaC may be deubiquitinated in apical compartments to maintain a recycling channel population at the apical membranes.

Binding of DUBs to the active site cysteine of the probe facilitated stable covalent epitope tagging of these active DUBs. Several DUBs were isolated using this approach, with a predominant DUB in endocytic compartments of CCD cells identified as UCH-L3. Pharmacological inhibition of UCH, together with biochemical and siRNA techniques, confirmed the central role that UCH-L3 plays in acutely regulating ENaC surface density. UCH-L3 is required to maintain a stable apical membrane ENaC population by facilitating the dynamic recycling of ENaC at the apical surface.

The final pellet represented the CCV preparation. CCVs were resuspended in 0.2-0.5 ml of RIPA buffer, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at -80 °C for further study. Early Endosomal (EE) Vesicle Preparations—Isolation of early endosomes has been described by us before (17Wang H. Traub L.M. Weixel K.M. Hawryluk M.J. Shah N. Edinger R.S. Perry C.J. Kester L.

CCD cells grown on 75-mm filter supports were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and resuspended in 600 μl of HEPES buffer composed of 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA at pH 7.4 containing protease inhibitors. The cells were passed through a 200-1000-μl pipette tip 10 times and then lysed by passing through a 22-gauge needle 20 times. Following a low speed spin, the post-nuclear supernatant was diluted 1:1 with 62% sucrose and placed at the bottom of a 4.4-ml polyclear centrifuge tube (Seton Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA). 1.5 ml of 35% sucrose was layered on top followed by 1.5 ml of 25% sucrose and 0.5 ml of HEPES buffer. The gradients were centrifuged in a TST 60.1 rotor at 167,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C, and the interfaces were collected. Ubiquitin Probe Production, Cell Extract Labeling, and Detection—The procedure to produce HA-tagged UB probes has been described in detail previously (20Hemelaar J. Galardy P.J. Borodovsky A.

A vinyl methyl ester was employed as the electrophylic trap to covalently tag active DUBs because it had shown the broadest reactivity with a number of DUBs (20Hemelaar J. Galardy P.J. Borodovsky A. Kessler B.M. Ploegh H.L. Ovaa H. J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Premanufactured probes were added either to post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) obtained by low speed (10 000 × g) centrifugation following cell lysis or CCV or EE preparations (as described above). For samples to be used directly in Western blotting 20 μg of cell lysate was incubated with 0.1 μg of manufactured probe for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted for using an anti HA antibody (Sigma). HA-tagged samples were immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal HA-conjugated-agarose antibody (Sigma). For IP the HA antibody-agarose suspension was washed by centrifugation (10 000 × g for 1 min) and resuspended in RIPA buffer used for cell lysis. Washed resin was added to the tagged samples and incubated at 4 °C overnight on an orbital shaker. Following incubation, the samples were washed four times as above. On the final wash the supernatant was aspirated, and 50 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer was added to the resin, and samples were heated to 95 °C for 2 min and loaded onto a gel for separation by SDS-PAGE. PCR—To verify the expression of the UCH family of proteins in mCCD cells, reverse transcription-PCR was preformed. Specific primer pairs for L1 (GCCATCCGCGAAGATGCAGC; GGACTAGACAAACCACATCC), L3 (CAGTCATGGAGGGTCAACGC; TGCTATGCTGCCGAGAGAGC), and L5 (CACCATGTCGAGCAATGCCGGG; GAAATTAAGTGCAGCACACTGTAC) were used to amplify the full-length cDNA from either mCCD cell library or mouse kidney cDNA library, which acted as a positive control. The product was separated on an agarose gel. Surface Protein Biotinylation—Biotin labeling of membrane resident proteins were carried out on mCCD cells cultured on 12-mm-diameter filter inserts as described previously (18Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 23Butterworth M.B. Frizzell R.A. Johnson J.P. Peters K.W. Edinger R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F969-F977Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Biotin-labeled proteins were separated using streptavidin-conjugated beads, and samples were run on SDS-PAGE to determine the relative density of ENaC at the membrane surface of mCCD cells. Densitometric evaluation of the exposed blots was performed using Quantity One (Bio-Rad). Ub Immunoprecipitation—To confirm the ubiquitinated state of ENaC, mCCD cells cultured on 75-mm filters were treated with UCH-L3 inhibitor for 3 h, with untreated filter-cultured cells acting as controls. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated using an anti-Ub antibody as previously described (17Wang H. Traub L.M. Weixel K.M. Hawryluk M.J. Shah N. Edinger R.S. Perry C.J. Kester L. Butterworth M.B. Peters K.W. Kleyman T.R. Frizzell R.A. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14129-14135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Isolated Ub-tagged proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with anti-α, β, and γENaC antibodies (see below). The blots were densitometrically quantitated using Quantity One, and the fold increase in ubiquitinated α- and γ-ENaC is reported. Biotinylation Followed by Ub Immunoprecipitation—To detect ENaC that was ubiquitinated at the cell surface, UCH-L3 inhibitor treated (3 h) and untreated 75-mm filters were surface biotinylated (as described above). Following separation using streptavidin beads, the samples were washed by centrifugation at low speed (10 000 × g) and resuspended in the biotinylation lysis buffer three times. After the final centrifugation, the samples were resuspended in 25 μl of RIPA buffer with 10% β-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 30 min at 40 °C to disassociate the bound proteins from the streptavidin beads. The samples were centrifuged (13,000 × g) for 5 min to pellet the streptavidin beads, and the supernatant was collected and added to RIPA buffer to a final volume of 750 μl. This diluted the remaining β-mercaptoethanol over ∼30-fold. Next samples were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Ub antibody as described above to detect biotinylated ENaC, which had been ubiquitinated. After IP, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted for the three ENaC subunits. siRNA Knockdown—A combination of three separate oligonucleotides (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to specifically knock down mouse UCH-L3 expression in mCCD cells. The oligonucleotides were introduced by lipidic transfection as previously described according to manufacturer's protocols (18Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). GAPDH siRNA was employed as a negative control to ensure that it did not effect UCH-L3 expression. Following transfection, the cells were seeded onto 6.5-mm filter inserts at superconfluency and allowed 48 h to form a tight transporting monolayer. The filters were mounted in modified Ussing chambers for ISC recording as described above. Chemicals, Reagents, and Antibodies—UCH inhibitors, 4,5,6,7-tetrachloroindan-1,3-dione (UCH-L3 inhibitor) and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 inhibitor (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) were reconstituted in Me2SO at 1000-fold stock concentration just prior to addition in all investigations. All of the other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless stated. Anti-HA antibodies and resin-conjugated anti-HA-agarose were obtained from Sigma. A mouse monoclonal βENaC and rabbit polyclonal γENaC antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A rabbit polyclonal αENaC antibody was developed by us and previously reported and characterized for studies in the CCD cells (18Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal βENaC antibody kindly provided by Dr. M. Knepper (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used to test Ub labeling of βENaC, but data are not presented for this antibody. A rabbit polyclonal anti-UCH-L3 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody was obtained from Stressgen Bioreagents (Ann Arbor, MI). Statistics—The summarized data are presented as the means and standard error (Sigmaplot 2000; SPSS). Differences determined by Student's t test with p <= 0.05 considered significantly different (Sigmaplot 2000). DUB Labeling Identifies UCH-L3 in Endosomes of mCCD Cells—An HA-tagged Ub probe was employed to identify DUBs active in mCCD cells. Samples from PNS, CCV, and EE preparations isolated from mCCD cells were incubated with the chemical probe. Because only active DUBs will modify the Ub tag and become covalently HA-tagged, the procedure specifically identified active DUBs in these subcellular compartments. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-HA antibody to identify the HA-tagged DUBs (Fig. 1A). The specificity for the HA tagging was verified by the addition of the cysteine modifier N-ethylmaleimide during the labeling reaction, which eliminated DUB interactions with the HA probe. Several active DUBs were identified in this manner (note the different molecular mass bands) with a predominant labeled species (∼40 kDa) evident in all of the samples. Tagged samples could be further isolated by immunoprecipitation using an anti-HA antibody followed by separation by SDS-PAGE. This approach also identified the predominant lower molecular mass species (Fig. 1B). The position of this lower molecular mass DUB species was similar to that found in studies of malignant human cells using the same technique, which identified UCH family members at this position (27Ovaa H. Kessler B.M. Rolen U. Galardy P.J. Ploegh H.L. Masucci M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2253-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To confirm the identity of the DUB as an UCH isoform, HA-tagged samples from the PNS and EE preparations were immunoprecipitated using the anti-HA antibody and blotted for UCH-L3 (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2). UCH-L3 detected in these samples was absent in immunoprecipitates from PNS samples that were immunoprecipitated using a nonspecific antibody (lane 3). Endogenous UCH-L3 was also detected by Western blot of untagged PNS material from mCCD cells (Fig. 1C, lane 4). Note that the band is of lower molecular mass when compared with the HA-tagged samples because the tagging procedure covalently added an HA-tagged ubiquitin moiety (∼10 kDa) to the UCH-L3 DUB. Blotting the HA-tagged PNS with an anti-HA antibody after the IP produced a single band corresponding to the labeled UCH-L3, again attesting to the specificity of the reaction (Fig. 1C, lane 5). The UCH-L3 isoform has been shown to be more widely expressed than UCH-L1, which is predominantly localized in neuronal tissues (14Soboleva T.A. Baker R.T. Curr. Protein Pept.

Science. 1989; 246: 670-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). To determine which of the UCH isoforms are found in mCCD cells, reverse transcription-PCR was carried out using primers to detect UCH-L1, UCH-L3, and UCH-L5 (Fig. 1D). UCH-L3 expression in mCCD cells was confirmed, whereas both the UCH-L1 and UCH-L5 isoforms were not detected in mCCD cells but were present in the whole kidney samples, which acted as positive controls (29Kwon J. Wang Y.L. Setsuie R. Sekiguchi S. Sakurai M. Sato Y. Lee W.W. Ishii Y. Kyuwa S. Noda M. Wada K. Yoshikawa Y. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 71: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). UCH-L3 Inhibition Reduces ENaC Currents—To determine whether UCH-L3 is implicated in the acute regulation of ENaC expressed endogenously in mCCD cells, a specific, cell-permeable UCH-L3 inhibitor (4,5,6,7-tetrachloroindan-1,3-dione) was employed to reduce the deubiquitinating activity of UCH-L3. This compound exhibits a greater potency for UCH-L3 inhibition than an isatin O-acyl oxime compound that acts as a reversible, competitive, active site-directed inhibitor of UCH-L1. The development and specificity of these compounds has been documented in previous studies by others (34Liu Y. Lashuel H.A. Choi S. Xing X. Case A. Ni J. Yeh L.A. Cuny G.D. Stein R.L. Lansbury P.T. Chemistry & Biology. 2003; 10: 837-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). ISC was measured across mCCD cells cultured on filter supports and mounted in modified Ussing chambers. The UCH-L3 inhibitor (10 μm) was added to cells under basal (unstimulated) conditions, before or during cAMP stimulation (10 μm forskolin). We have demonstrated previously that forskolin alters the distribution of ENaC from a subapical vesicle storage population and translocates channels into the apical membranes of these cells (18Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Inhibitor addition at the peak of the forskolin stimulation resulted in a fairly rapid decline in ENaC ISC (Fig. 2A) compared with vehicle-treated control cells, in which the ISC remained stably elevated. The addition of amiloride at the end of the trace demonstrated that the majority of the recorded current was the result of ENaC-mediated Na+ absorption. The results from five similar experiments, in which ISC data were collected at 5-min intervals, are summarized in Fig. 2B. The values were normalized to those obtained prior to drug treatment. Under basal (unstimulated) conditions, inhibitor addition to both apical and basolateral bathing solutions caused the ISC to decline but at a slower rate than in the presence of the cAMP agonist (Fig. 2C). The rate of current decline was significantly greater than that in vehicle-treated control cells, which displayed relatively stable values over the same period. The addition of the UCH-L3 inhibitor prior to forskolin stimulation resulted in a significantly reduced ISC response and an accelerated rundown of ENaC current with a time course similar to that observed when UCH-L3 was inhibited at the peak of forskolin stimulation (data not shown). To examine the specificity of the UCH-L3 versus UCH-L1 inhibitors, dose response relations for ISC inhibition were determined for each compound using mCCD epithelia. The percentage current inhibition observed after 15 min of exposure for cells stimulated with forskolin is plotted over a range of concentrations (Fig. 2D). The specific UCH-L3 inhibitor abolished close to 80% of the current within 15 min at 100 μm compared with ∼20% inhibition by the UCH-L1 inhibitor. The current inhibition for the UCH-L1 inhibitor at high concentrations was not significantly different from that at 10 μm, demonstrating that increasing concentrations did not have a deleterious impact on the mCCD cells and that UCH-L1 is not involved in maintaining ENaC activity. UCH-L3 Inhibition Decreases Apical Membrane ENaC Expression—The requirement for a DUB in ENaC recycling at the apical surface highlights the dynamic nature of regulation achieved by the balance between channel ubiquitination and deubiquitination. To verify the loss of ENaC at the apical surface when UCH-L3 was inhibited, we biotin-labeled apical membrane proteins in polarized mCCD cells and determined the surface density of α, β, and γENaC by avidin affinity isolation and immunoblotting in UCH-L3 inhibited compared with control cells. In these experiments, the cells received no forskolin stimulation. The level"

Cellular FNs that include the EIIIA and/or EIIIB FN-III segments are prominently expressed during embryogenesis, wound healing, tumor progression, and inflammation. However, the roles of this domain in altering overall FN protein structure and regulating cellular function remain unclear. We previously reported that two integrins, α9β1 and α4β1, ligate the EIIIA segment (Liao, Y. F., Gotwals, P. J., Koteliansky, V. E., Sheppard, D., and Van De Water, L. (2002) J. Biol.

We find that the Asp41 and Gly42 residues within the C-C′ loop of EIIIA are necessary for integrin α9β1 binding. Synthetic peptides based on the predicted important amino acid sequence from the C-C′ loop encode sufficient information to completely inhibit α9β1-mediated cell adhesion. We also report that EIIIA promotes filopodial formation in α9β1-expressing cells accompanied by Cdc42 activation.

Although it is now clear that the ECM serves both structural and instructional roles, the mechanisms that regulate the presentation of this “instruction set” to cells remain unclear. Potential mechanisms include alternative splicing to enhance the sequence complexity for an ECM gene product at a needed site. In addition, once expressed, ECM proteins can harbor cryptic sites that are exposed by specific proteolysis or by conformation changes induced by mechanical forces (3Davis G.E. Bayless K.J.

FNs are high molecular weight, multifunctional adhesive glycoproteins present in the ECM, connective tissues, basement membrane, and various body fluids. They provide excellent substrates for cell adhesion and spreading, thereby promoting cell migration during embryonic development, wound healing, and tumor progression and interact with other ECM proteins and cellular ligands, such as glycosaminoglycans, collagen, fibrin, and integrins (7Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, Inc., New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). FNs are disulfide-bonded dimers of two closely related subunits, each consisting of three types of homologous repeating modules termed types I, II, and III (8Petersen T.E. Thogersen H.C. Skorstengaard K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Sahl P. Sottrup-Jensen L. Magnusson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). FN molecules have multiple isoforms generated from a single gene by alternative splicing of combinations of three exons: extra domain A (EDA/EIIIA), extra domain B (EDB/EIIIB), and connecting segment III (V). Both EIIIA and EIIIB exons are type III repeating units (7Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, Inc., New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). Plasma fibronectin (pFN), produced by hepatocytes and abundant in plasma, lacks both the EIIIA and EIIIB domains. However, cellular FNs, produced by fibroblasts and epithelial and other cell types, are insoluble, and incorporated into the pericellular matrix, they contain the EIIIA and EIIIB segments in various combinations (9Ffrench-Constant C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The FN type III (FN-III) repeats exhibit high structural homology (10Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). The canonical FN type III repeat is a conserved β-sandwich conformation consisting of two β-sheets comprising four strands (G, F, C, C′) and three strands (A, B, and E) (10Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Considerable interest has arisen with the observation that these FN-IIIs are conformationally labile (13Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10114-10118Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 14Hynes R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2588-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Alterations in FN-III conformation can occur as a result of mechanical perturbation or proteolysis and may reveal novel “cryptic” sites (6Vogel V. Sheetz M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing may also influence the function of adjacent domains. For example, the inclusion of the EIIIB segment into cellular FN reveals a novel epitope for monoclonal antibody (mAb) BC.1 (16Carnemolla B. Leprini A. Allemanni G. Saginati M. Zardi L. J. Biol.

Blood. 2004; 104: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), although some alterations in cutaneous skin wound healing as well as a significantly shorter life span than wild-type mice have been reported in one model but not another (34Tan M.H.

No definitive impact of either the EIIIA or EIIIB segments alone in tumor progression has been observed (36Astrof S. Crowley D. George E.L. Fukuda T. Sekiguchi K. Hanahan D. Hynes R.O. Mol.

Integrins are heterodimeric receptors for ECM and cell surface counterreceptors that play important roles in embryonic development, inflammation, wound healing, and tumorigenesis (38Hynes R.O.

As a result of their dual roles in adhesion and signaling and because of their close association with the actin cytoskeleton, integrins play important roles in regulating cell shape and cell migration (41Ridley A.J.

Ligand binding specificity depends on the specific α and β subunit present in each heterodimer. In addition to the ligand specificity, sequence homologies between the α-subunits determine the classification of integrins into distinct subfamilies. Of these integrin subfamilies, the α4/α9 integrins (α4β1, α9β1, and α4β7) recognize short peptide sequences that include an Asp residue (39Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar). Integrin α9β1 binds a variety of ligands in an RGD-independent manner (Table 2). These ligands, with the exception of tenascin-C, ADAM-12, ADAM-15, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D, also bind to integrin α4β1, the closest relative of α9β1, with which it shares 39% amino acid identity (42Takahashi H.

In the present study, we report that the amino acids Asp41 and Gly42 in the C-C′ loop region participate in the specific binding of the EIIIA segment to integrin α9β1. Our studies employed alanine-scanning mutagenesis and synthetic peptides to precisely delineate the critical residues involved in cell adhesion and filopodial extension via integrin α9β1. Our data establish key amino acid residues that participate in integrin binding but also suggest that the conformation of the epitope plays a role in recognition of integrin ligands by the EIIIA segment.

The addition of restriction sites on the primers resulted in the addition of four amino acids in the chimera at positions 38, 39, 89, and 90. The long oligonucleotide fragments containing the N-terminal region from III4 were then complemented and annealed by mixing 75-100 μg of each oligonucleotide with sodium chloride (20 mm final concentration) and subsequently boiled for 3 min. The mixture was then cooled and stored at -20 °C until ligation. The PCR-amplified, enzymedigested, and annealed fragments were ligated and cloned into the KpnI/Acc65 and HindIII sites of the vector PQE30, which was then transformed into Escherichia coli (DH10B). Transformants were picked and expanded, and protein expression was induced (4 h, 37 °C) by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (Sigma) to a final concentration of 1 mm. Bacteria were then centrifuged (7000 × g for 10 min), and the resulting cell pellets were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (Invitrogen). The pellet was either immediately used for protein purification or stored at -80 °C. For protein purification, cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of BPer lysis solution with 1 mm AEBSF (PBS/AEBSF), 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma), 10 mm MgCl2, and (880 units of) RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen), thoroughly mixed, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The clarified supernatant was collected and gently mixed with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin by inversion (1.5 h, room temperature). This Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was washed batchwise with DPBS until all unbound protein was removed, poured into a column, and then treated with 1 ml of elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 250 mm imidazole, and 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Eluted protein was dialyzed against DPBS, further purified using a DEAE-Sepharose column, and dialyzed again. Protein concentrations, purity, and molecular mass were verified by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and analysis by BCA protein assay. Immunological protein reactivity was investigated by Western blotting with mAbs IST-9, 5C11F3, and 4D6E8. The protein was stored at -80 °C until future use.

However, the mechanism linking abnormality of NOD2 signaling and inflammation has yet to be elucidated. Here we show that transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is an essential intermediate of NOD2 signaling. We found that TAK1 deletion completely abolished MDP-NOD2 signaling, activation of NF-κB and MAPKs, and subsequent induction of cytokines/chemokines in keratinocytes.

RICK has been also reported to function as a scaffold protein bringing NOD2 and IκB kinase (IKK) into close proximity (13Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Nunez G.

However, the exact molecular mechanism by which NOD2-RICK activates IKK-NF-κB and MAPK pathways remains undefined.Initial studies revealed that NOD2 expression was restricted to monocytes/macrophages (5Ogura Y.

However, additional studies showed that NOD2 is also expressed in several epithelial cells including enterocytes (15Gutierrez O. Pipaon C. Inohara N. Fontalba A. Ogura Y. Prosper F. Nunez G.

Both enterocytes and keratinocytes are normally exposed to commensal bacteria, and they are activated by bacterial components including MDP (16Voss E. Wehkamp J. Wehkamp K. Stange E.F. Schroder J.M.

Upon stimulation, enterocytes and keratinocytes produce antibacterial peptides as well as many cytokines/chemokines to recruit and activate immune cells in the intestine and skin, thereby preventing bacterial invasion and proliferation (17Kobayashi K.S.

Loss-of-function mutations of NOD2 are highly correlated with susceptibility of Crohn disease, a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease that is characterized by chronic inflammation in the intestine (19Bouma G.

Nature. 2002; 416: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which ablation of MDP-NOD2 signaling can enhance inflammation in vivo has been a much debated subject (21Eckmann L. Karin M.

One plausible mechanism is that failure of up-regulation of antimicrobial peptides and/or cytokines/chemokines via MDP derived from commensal bacteria increases susceptibility to bacterial invasion, which may impair the epithelial barrier function and ultimately induce chronic inflammation. However, it has not been established whether loss of NOD2 signaling is causally involved in loss of epithelial barrier function in vivo.Transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a member of the MAPKKK family and plays an essential role in tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and TLR signaling pathways (24Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 25Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T.

Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In response to proinflammatory cytokines or TLR ligands, TAK1 is recruited to TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) and TAK1-binding proteins, which serve as adaptor proteins, and TAK1 in turn phosphorylates and activates IKKs as well as MAPKKs, which subsequently activate the MAPKs JNK and p38. These pathways ultimately activate transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. Besides its well established role in proinflammatory cytokines and TLR signaling, TAK1 is also reported to be involved in NOD2 signaling (28Chen C.M. Gong Y. Zhang M. Chen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25876-25882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). TAK1 interacts with NOD2, and overexpression of dominant negative TAK1 inhibits NOD2-induced NF-κB activation. Recently, Windheim et al. (29Windheim M. Lang C. Peggie M. Cummings L. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) reported that TAK1 is important for MDP signaling by using a selective inhibitor of TAK1 as well as using TAK1 knock-out embryonic fibroblasts. However, the physiological roles of TAK1 in NOD2 signaling remain to be elucidated.In this study, we determined the role of TAK1 in NOD2 signaling by utilizing TAK1 FL/FL (floxed) and Δ/Δ (knock-out) keratinocytes generated by the Cre-LoxP system (30Omori E. Matsumoto K. Sanjo H. Sato S. Akira S. Smart R.C. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19610-19617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We found that NOD2-induced innate immune responses are completely abolished in TAK1 Δ/Δ cells and that TAK1 was activated upon stimulation of the MDP-NOD2-RICK pathway. In addition, we found that ablation of TAK1 blocked MDP-induced up-regulation of NOD2. Our results indicate that TAK1 is not only an essential downstream molecule of NOD2-RICK signaling but also is involved in the regulation of NOD2 expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells—TAK1 FL/FL and Δ/Δ keratinocytes were isolated from TAK1 FL/FL and epidermis-specific TAK1 deletion mice described in our previous publication (30Omori E. Matsumoto K. Sanjo H. Sato S. Akira S. Smart R.C. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19610-19617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Spontaneously immortalized keratinocytes derived from the skin of postnatal day 0–2 mice were cultured in Ca2+-free minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 4% Chelex-treated bovine growth serum, 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen), 0.05 mm calcium chloride, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 33 °C in 8% CO2. Human embryonic kidney 293 and human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine growth serum (HyClone). 293 cells were transfected by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method.Antibodies, Plasmids, and Reagents—Anti-NF-κB p65 (F-6), anti-NF-κB p50 (H-119), anti-NF-κB p52 (K-27), anti-IKKα (H-744), anti-IKKα/β (H-470), JNK (FL), anti-p38 (N-20) and anti-RICK (H-300) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies to phosphorylated JNK, phosphorylated p38, and phosphorylated TAK1 (Thr-187) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-FLAG (Sigma) and Anti-HA (Covance) were used. Anti-TAK1 was described previously (24Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Anti-human NOD2 affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody was produced by immunizing a peptide DEEERASVLLGHSPGE (amino acids 11–26 of human NOD2). Human NOD2 cDNAs were subcloned to pCMV-HA vector. FLAG-tagged RICK plasmids were described previously (20Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Nunez G. Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). pMX-puro-TAK1, -NOD2, and -RICK were generated by inserting the cDNAs into the pMX-puro vectors (31Kitamura T. Int. J. Hematol. 1998; 67: 351-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MDP-LD, MDP-LL, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were purchased from Sigma.Real-time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from cultured keratinocytes using the RNeasy Protect mini kit (Qiagen). To obtain cDNA, 200 ng of each RNA samples were reverse transcribed using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR analysis was performed using the ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system. An Assays-on-Demand gene expression kit (Applied Biosystems) was used for detecting the expression of MIP2, TNF, and NOD2. All samples were normalized to the signal generated from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and whole cell extracts were prepared using lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm aprotinin, 0.5% Triton X-100). For coprecipitation assay, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of various antibodies and 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl), resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer, and boiled. For detecting endogenous interaction between TAK1 and RICK, HT-29 cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5) supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μm aprotinin). Resuspended cells were lysed by passing through a 22-gauge needle 10 times and adding an equivalent volume of hypotonic buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 300 mm NaCl. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1.5 μg of control IgG or anti-RICK antibody. For immunoblotting, the immunoprecipitates or whole cell extracts were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-P membranes (GE Healthcare). The membranes were immunoblotted with various antibodies, and the bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG using the ECL Western blotting system (GE Healthcare).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Whole cell extracts were prepared from keratinocytes stimulated with MDP for indicated time points. 32P-Labeled NF-κB oligonucleotides (Promega) were used for generating radiolabeled probe. 30 μg of whole cell extracts were incubated with radiolabeled probe, 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 ng of poly(dI·dC) (GE Healthcare), and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 20 μl for 20 min and subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. For supershift assay, the whole cell extracts were incubated with 2 μgof NF-κB antibodies or control IgGs for 15 min prior to the addition of the labeled probe.In Vitro Kinase Assay—IKK complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKα, and the immunoprecipitates were incubated with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and 1 μgof bacterially expressed GST-IκB in 10 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C for 30 min. Samples were then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.Retroviral Infection—To obtain retrovirus carrying TAK1, NOD2, and RICK, EP2-293 cells (BD Biosciences) were transiently transfected with retroviral vectors, pMX-puro-TAK1, -NOD2, and -RICK. After a 48-h culture, growth medium containing retrovirus was collected and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min to remove packaging cells. Keratinocytes were incubated with the collected virus-containing EP2-293 medium with 8 μg/ml Polybrene for 24 h. Uninfected cells were removed by puromycin selection.RESULTSMDP-mediated Innate Immune Response Is Impaired in TAK1 Δ/Δ Keratinocytes—We have previously generated TAK1 Δ/Δ keratinocytes in which 37 amino acids, including the ATP binding region of TAK1, were deleted by the Cre-LoxP system resulting in the expression of kinase-dead TAK1 (TAK1 Δ) (30Omori E. Matsumoto K. Sanjo H. Sato S. Akira S. Smart R.C. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19610-19617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of TAK1 in NOD2-mediated immune responses in epithelial cells, we used these TAK1 Δ/Δ and control TAK1 FL/FL keratinocytes as a model system. Keratinocytes were stimulated with MDP (MDP-LD, an active isomer), and the expression of cytokine TNF and chemokine MIP2 (IL-8 in humans) was measured using quantitative real-time PCR. We found that MDP was a potent inducer of cytokines/chemokines in keratinocytes (Fig. 1A). MDP-induced TNF and MIP2 expression was impaired in TAK1 Δ/Δ keratinocytes when compared with that observed in FL/FL keratinocytes (Fig. 1A). To confirm whether this impairment is caused by TAK1 deletion, we reintroduced wild-type TAK1 in TAK1 Δ/Δ cells by infection of retrovirus expressing wild-type TAK1. TAK1 Δ/Δ keratinocytes expressed the kinase-dead TAK1 at low levels presumably because of the unstable nature of mutant TAK1. The ectopically introduced TAK1 was expressed at levels similar to those found in TAK1 FL/FL keratinocytes (Fig. 2A). Notably, the reintroduction of TAK1 into TAK1 Δ/Δ keratinocytes restored MDP-induced proinflammatory cytokine expressions (Fig. 1A), which demonstrates that TAK1 is essential for MDP-mediated innate immune responses in keratinocytes. To confirm that MDP, but not contaminated bacterial component(s) such as LPS, mediated these responses, we examined the effect of a biologically inactive isomer of MDP, MDP-LL, and LPS on keratinocytes. Even at very high concentration, neither MDP-LL nor LPS induced expression of TNF or MIP2 in control TAK1 FL/FL keratinocytes (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that TAK1 is an essential intermediate for MDP signaling in keratinocytes leading to innate immune responses.FIGURE 2MDP-induced activation of NF-κB and MAPKs in keratinocytes.A, TAK1 FL/FL, TAK1 Δ/Δ, and TAK1 Δ/Δ+TAK1 keratinocytes were stimulated with MDP (20 μg/ml) for the indicated times. Whole cell extracts were harvested from treated cells, and the NF-κ B-DNA binding activity was examined by EMSA. p65 immunoblotting (IB) was used for loading control for EMSA. The asterisk indicates a nonspecific band. B, whole cell extracts from TAK1 FL/FL cells 6 h after MDP (10 μg/ml) stimulation were incubated with antibodies (Ab) against NF-κB family proteins, as well as control mouse or rabbit IgGs (mIgG and rIgG, respectively), and subjected to EMSA. C, whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKα, and the IKK complex was subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using GST-IκB as an exogenous substrate. The amount of IKKα was analyzed by immunoblotting. D and E, the whole cell extracts used for EMSA were subjected to immunoblotting using phospho-JNK, phospho-p38, JNK, and p38 antibodies. All results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MDP-induced Activation of NF-κB, JNK, and p38 Is Impaired in TAK1 Δ/Δ Keratinocytes—To investigate the role of TAK1 in MDP-mediated intracellular signaling pathways, we examined the activation of NF-κB and MAPKs in TAK1 FL/FL and Δ/Δ keratinocytes. In TAK1 FL/FL keratinocytes, MDP markedly activated NF-κB DNA binding after 2–6 h of incubation (Fig. 2A), and this was associated with translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65 into the nucleus (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, MDP-induced NF-κB activation was not observed in TAK1 Δ/Δ keratinocytes (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1). Notably, the reintroduction of TAK1 restored the activation of NF-κB in TAK1 Δ/Δ keratinocytes (Fig. 2A). Gel supershift assay revealed that p65 homodimer is a major NF-κB complex in MDP-stimulated keratinocytes (Fig. 2B). To confirm further whether MDP-induced NF-κB pathway is TAK1-dependent, we examined activation of IKK by in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2C). IKK was activated 2–6 h after MDP stimulation in TAK1 FL/FL keratinocytes, whereas no activation was detected in TAK1 Δ/Δ keratinocytes. Activation of JNK and p38 MAPKs was determined by detecting the activated forms of JNK and p38 using phospho-specific antibodies. MDP activated JNK and p38 with a time course similar to that of NF-κB activation in control TAK1 FL/FL keratinocytes, but the activation was completely abolished in TAK1 Δ/Δ keratinocytes (Fig. 2, D and E). The reintroduction of TAK1 restored the activation of JNK and p38 (Fig. 2, D and E). These results demonstrate that TAK1 is essential for the activation of both NF-κB and JNK/p38 following MDP stimulation in keratinocytes.The time course of activation of NF-κB, JNK, and p38 in MDP-stimulated keratinocytes was slow compared with that observed in TNF- or IL-1-stimulated cells. They are normally activated within 10–30 min after TNF or IL-1 treatment and down-regulated afterward (25Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 27Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Because MDP strongly induces TNF (Fig. 1), but not IL-1 (data not shown), one possibility is that MDP-induced TNF may be responsible for this delayed activation. However, we found that MDP could activate NF-κB, JNK, and p38 even in TNF receptor knock-out keratinocytes with a time course similar to that observed in wild-type keratinocytes (supplemental Fig. S2). Therefore, it is likely that MDP slowly induces TAK1 activation and subsequent downstream events.NOD2 and RICK Interact with TAK1—Our results indicate that TAK1 is a critical downstream target molecule of the MDP-NOD2-RICK signaling pathway. We examined next whether TAK1 can physically interact with NOD2 and RICK. Earlier studies reported that TAK1 interacts with NOD2 (28Chen C.M. Gong Y. Zhang M. Chen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25876-25882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We confirmed that TAK1 was coprecipitated with NOD2 when ectopically expressed in 293 cells (Fig. 3A, left panels). The reciprocal precipitation assay verified the TAK1-NOD2 interaction (Fig. 3A, right panels). TAK1 and RICK were also ectopically expressed in 293 cells, and the coprecipitation assay revealed that RICK associated with TAK1 (Fig. 3B). To verify further this interaction under physiological conditions, we examined the association of endogenous TAK1 with RICK in epithelial cells. For this purpose, we used the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29 because we found that HT-29 cells expressed RICK at higher levels than in keratinocytes (data not shown). Endogenous TAK1 was weakly coprecipitated with RICK in HT-29 cells, and the interaction was enhanced by MDP treatment (Fig. 3C). Thus, TAK1 associates with RICK in epithelial cells, and MDP may enhance the interaction.FIGURE 3NOD2 and RICK interact with TAK1.A, 293 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged TAK1 along with HA-tagged NOD2 or an equal amount of empty vector. HA-NOD2 was immunoprecipitated, and immunoprecipitates (IP) and whole cell extracts (WCE) were analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) (left panels). The interaction was confirmed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assay (right panels). B, 293 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged RICK along with HA-tagged TAK1 or an equal amount of empty vector. TAK1-RICK interaction was tested as described above. C, HT-29 cells were treated with MDP (10μg/ml) for 6 h or left untreated, and whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-RICK antibody or the same amount of control IgG. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NOD2 and RICK Activate TAK1—Although RICK is a kinase, it has been shown that its kinase activity is dispensable for activation of downstream events (32Lu C.

This suggests that an unidentified kinase is responsible for phosphorylation of IKKs and MAPKKs leading to activation of NF-κB and MAPKs in the NOD2-RICK pathway. TAK1 is a kinase that activates both IKK and MAPKKs in IL-1, TNF, and TLR signaling pathways (24Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K.

https://openalex.org/W2075581185,"Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) is a cell surface glycoprotein enriched on tumor cells and normal epithelia. It is mainly known for its ability to induce matrix metalloproteinase production in fibroblasts following epithelial-stromal interaction. We sought to examine whether EMMPRIN has a broader role promoting fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation. Because alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) is considered a marker of this differentiation process, we analyzed the effect of EMMPRIN on its expression in corneal and skin fibroblasts by Western blots, immunocytochemistry, and a functional assay of collagen lattice contraction. Increasing EMMPRIN expression by cDNA transfection or by treatment with exogenously added recombinant EMMPRIN resulted in an up-regulation of alphaSMA expression. EMMPRIN also increased the contractile properties of the treated fibroblasts as demonstrated by the immunohistochemical appearance of stress fibers and by the accelerated contraction of fibroblast-embedded collagen lattices. Blocking EMMPRIN expression by small interfering RNA inhibited alphaSMA and collagen gel contraction induced not only by EMMPRIN but also by transforming growth factor-beta, a major mediator of myofibroblast differentiation that also regulated EMMPRIN expression. These findings, combined with the fact that EMMPRIN and alphaSMA colocalized to the same cells in the stroma of pathological corneas, expand on the mechanism by which EMMPRIN remodels extracellular matrix during wound healing and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2062276351,"In adipocytes, insulin triggers the redistribution of Glut4 from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane. Two models have been proposed to explain the effect of insulin on Glut4 localization. In the first, termed dynamic exchange, Glut4 continually cycles between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments in basal cells, and the major effect of insulin is through changes in the exocytic and endocytic rate constants, kex and ken. In the second model, termed static retention, Glut4 is packaged in specialized storage vesicles (GSVs) in basal cells and does not traffic through the plasma membrane or endosomes. Insulin triggers GSV exocytosis, increasing the amount of Glut4 in the actively cycling pool. Using a flow cytometry-based assay, we found that Glut4 is regulated by both static and dynamic retention mechanisms. In basal cells, 75-80% of the Glut4 is packaged in noncycling GSVs. Insulin increased the amount of Glut4 in the actively cycling pool 4-5-fold. Insulin also increased kex in the cycling pool 3-fold. After insulin withdrawal, Glut4 is rapidly cleared from the plasma membrane (t½ of 20 min) by rapid adjustments in kex and ken and recycled into static compartments. Complete recovery of the static pool required more than 3 h, however. We conclude that in fully differentiated confluent adipocytes, both the dynamic and static retention mechanisms are important for the regulation of plasma membrane Glut4 content. However, cell culture conditions affect Glut4 trafficking. For example, replating after differentiation inhibited the static retention of Glut4, which may explain differences in previous reports. In adipocytes, insulin triggers the redistribution of Glut4 from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane. Two models have been proposed to explain the effect of insulin on Glut4 localization. In the first, termed dynamic exchange, Glut4 continually cycles between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments in basal cells, and the major effect of insulin is through changes in the exocytic and endocytic rate constants, kex and ken. In the second model, termed static retention, Glut4 is packaged in specialized storage vesicles (GSVs) in basal cells and does not traffic through the plasma membrane or endosomes.

The rate of glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue is limited by the total number of facilitative glucose transport proteins inserted into the plasma membrane (1Bryant N.J. Govers R. James D.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 2Foster L.J. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C877-C890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin regulates glucose uptake in fat and muscle by controlling the subcellular distribution of glucose transporters, predominantly the Glut4 isoform. In the absence of insulin, Glut4 is largely excluded from the plasma membrane and is retained within endosomes, the trans-Golgi network, and tubular-vesicular compartments termed Glut4 storage vesicles (GSVs) 2The abbreviations used are:GSVGlut4 storage vesicleBSAbovine serum albuminCScalf serumDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFBSfetal bovine serumFSCforward scatterGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininHSChigh scatter cellsLG4cells infected with lentivirus that expresses HA-Glut4/GFPLSClow scatter cellsMFImean fluorescence intensityMFRmean fluorescence ratioNVno virus, uninfected cellsPBSphosphate-buffered salineSSCside scatter cellsPMplasma membrane 2The abbreviations used are:GSVGlut4 storage vesicleBSAbovine serum albuminCScalf serumDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFBSfetal bovine serumFSCforward scatterGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininHSChigh scatter cellsLG4cells infected with lentivirus that expresses HA-Glut4/GFPLSClow scatter cellsMFImean fluorescence intensityMFRmean fluorescence ratioNVno virus, uninfected cellsPBSphosphate-buffered salineSSCside scatter cellsPMplasma membrane (1Bryant N.J.

Insulin triggers the redistribution of Glut4 from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane. This increases the total number of transporters localized to plasma membrane and thus the maximal rate of glucose transport into cells. When insulin is removed, the Glut4 is rapidly cleared from the plasma membrane back into intracellular compartments, where it is recycled for use in subsequent stimulations.

Chem. 2006; 281: 484-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Two competing models have emerged. In the first, termed dynamic exchange or dynamic equilibrium, plasma membrane Glut4 continually exchanges with Glut4 in the endosomes and GSVs (3Martin O.J. Lee A. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 484-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, slow exocytosis from GSVs together with fast endocytosis from the plasma membrane minimizes the amount of Glut4 at the cell surface. Insulin redistributes Glut4 to the plasma membrane by increasing the rate of Glut4 exocytosis (through an increase in the exocytic rate constant kex) while simultaneously decreasing the rate of Glut4 endocytosis from the plasma membrane (through a decrease in the endocytic rate constant ken). Key features of this model are that all of the Glut4 is actively cycling in both basal and insulin-stimulated cells, and the effect of insulin is completely accounted for by changes in kex and ken. A second model, termed static retention, differs from dynamic equilibrium in one important aspect. In static retention, Glut4 is sequestered in GSVs and does not cycle through the plasma membrane under basal conditions (4Govers R. Coster A.C. James D.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6456-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 5Coster A.C. Govers R. James D.E. Traffic. 2004; 5: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Insulin stimulates the fusion of GSVs with the plasma membrane, releasing Glut4 into the cycling membrane system (plasma membrane, endosomes, and trans-Golgi network) (4Govers R. Coster A.C. James D.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6456-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In this model, the GSVs behave like regulated exocytic vesicles. Insulin increases cell surface Glut4 through an increase in the total amount of Glut4 in the actively cycling pool as well as through an increase in kex. Early kinetic work used photoactivated glucose analogs to label Glut4 at the cell surface (6Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Vannucci S.J. Simpson I.A. Quon M.J. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glut4 labeled at the cell surface at 4 °C redistributed to intracellular compartments when cells were warmed to 37 °C, under both basal and insulin-stimulated conditions. Insulin increased kex and decreased ken. These observations suggested that the distribution of Glut4 was controlled through dynamic exchange and that the effect of insulin on Glut4 localization was due to effects on the rate constants for exocytosis and endocytosis. In these studies, it was explicitly assumed that all of the Glut4 actively cycled between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments in both basal and insulin-stimulated cells. The size of the actively cycling pool was not directly determined. More recently, exofacial epitope-tagged Glut4 reporter constructs have been used to study Glut4 traffic in live cells (3Martin O.J. Lee A. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 484-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 4Govers R. Coster A.C. James D.E. Mol.

Unlike endogenous Glut4, these reporters can be labeled with antibody when they are inserted into the plasma membrane. When expressed at low levels, the reporters traffic with the endogenous Glut4 (3Martin O.J. Lee A. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 484-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Dawson K. Aviles-Hernandez A. Cushman S.W. Malide D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1168-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Both the rate constant of exocytosis and the size of the total cycling pool can be determined from the kinetics of antibody binding/uptake during continuous labeling at 37 °C. Using this method, Martin et al. (3Martin O.J. Lee A. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 484-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) concluded that the distribution of Glut4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was controlled by dynamic exchange. In their experiments, ∼90% of the total Glut4 was cycling in both basal and insulin-stimulated cells. The major effect of insulin was to increase kex by 7-10-fold. Insulin also decreased ken by 70%. However, using the same cells, the same reporter constructs, and the same antibodies, Govers et al. (4Govers R. Coster A.C. James D.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6456-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 5Coster A.C. Govers R. James D.E. Traffic. 2004; 5: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) found that the distribution of Glut4 was controlled by static retention. The major effect of insulin was to increase the size of the actively cycling pool by ∼7-fold (from 10% of the total to 70% of the total Glut4 in the cell). Insulin also increased kex by 2-fold. These two models suggest very different mechanisms regulating Glut4 traffic. To determine the physiological relevance of these observations, it is important to determine how differences in the experimental methods used in the two studies influence Glut4 traffic. Previous reports using anti-HA uptake to measure the kinetics of Glut4 traffic have either relied on single cell analysis (3Martin O.J. Lee A. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 484-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) or whole plate assays (4Govers R. Coster A.C. James D.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6456-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We developed a flow cytometry based assay to analyze the kinetics of Glut4 exocytosis (we had previously used flow cytometry to measure the kinetics of endocytic trafficking of transferrin and α-2-macroglobulin) (13Cain C.C. Murphy R.F. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Cain C.C. Sipe D.M. Murphy R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 15Cain C.C. Wilson R.B. Murphy R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11746-11752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometry combines the ability of microscopy to analyze individual cells with the ability of the whole plate assay to analyze large numbers of cells in each sample. We evaluated the effects of methodological differences between the studies of Martin et al. (3Martin O.J. Lee A. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 484-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and Govers et al. (4Govers R. Coster A.C. James D.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6456-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) on Glut4 trafficking in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. Specifically, we tested the effect of replating quiescent, confluent differentiated cells, as is commonly done in electroporation and/or microscopy experiments using the 3T3-L1 cell culture model. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 fibroblasts (CCL 92.1; American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in DMEM (high glucose, with 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) supplemented with 10% calf serum (CS; Hyclone). For experiments, cells were plated into individual wells of a 96-well plate (0.12 × 105 cells/well). At confluence (3 days after plating), the cells were switched to DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone; characterized) and 5 μm Troglitazone (Calbiochem). 1 day postconfluence (day 0), the cells were induced to differentiate into adipocytes essentially as described (16Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 3 days in differentiation medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 5 μm Troglitazone, dexamethasone, isomethylbutylxanthine, and insulin), 3 days in insulin medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, Troglitazone, and insulin), and then 4-5 days in DMEM, 10% FBS. Cells were used 8-11 days after the initiation of differentiation. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were used 2-3 days postconfluence. To test the effect of confluence on Glut4 traffic, differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were lifted from the culture plates by collagenase digestion and replated at lower density. Briefly, cells were differentiated in 96-well plates as described. Upon removal of insulin-containing medium, cells were incubated with collagenase (1 μg/μl in PBS plus 1% BSA, 20 μl/well, 5 min, 37 °C), fresh culture medium (DMEM, 10% FBS) was added to each well (200 μl/well), and cells were suspended by gentle pipetting. 100 μl from each well was transferred to a new 96-well culture plate. Cells were allowed to settle for 2 h. After settling, cells were refed with 120 μl of culture medium, and cells were further cultured for 1, 2, or 3 days. Lentivirus—cDNA encoding HA-Glut4 (from Dr. Samuel Cushman, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (8Dawson K. Aviles-Hernandez A. Cushman S.W. Malide D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR and inserted at the Age1 site in frame upstream of the GFP reporter of the pRRL-PGK-GFP vector (from Dr. Rob C. Hoeben, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands) (17Carlotti F. Bazuine M. Kekarainen T. Seppen J. Pognonec P. Maassen J.A. Hoeben R.C. Mol. Ther. 2004; 9: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Lentivirus was prepared using the ViraPower lentiviral packaging mix and 293FT packaging cells following the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Invitrogen). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were infected with recombinant lentivirus essentially following recommended protocols (Invitrogen). Cells were plated at low density in 35-mm culture dishes and allowed to recover overnight in 2 ml of DMEM, 10% CS. The following day, the growth medium was replaced with infection medium (1 ml of HA-Glut4/GFP lentiviral supernatant diluted to 2 ml in DMEM, 10% CS, supplemented with 6 μg/ml Polybrene). Cells were incubated in infection medium for 24 h. Infection medium was then replaced with DMEM, 10% CS. Infected cells were allowed to reach 80% confluence and then cultured as described above. Infection efficiency was determined by flow cytometry. Under these conditions, ∼80% of the cells expressed the HA-Glut4/GFP reporter construct. Flow Cytometry—3T3-L1 cells (fibroblasts and differentiated adipocytes) were suspended by collagenase digestion (1 μg/μl in PBS plus 1% BSA, 20 μl/well, 5 min at 37 °C or 30 min at 4 °C) and gentle pipetting in a final volume of 200 μl of PBS plus 1% BSA. Suspended cells were filtered through a 100-μm cell strainer. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) equipped with argon (488 nm) and helium/neon (633 nm) lasers. Log intensities of scattered light (forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC); 488 nm excitation) and fluorescence (FL1, 488 nm excitation/525 nm emission; FL2, 488 nm excitation/595 nm emission; FL3, 488 nm excitation/>640 nm emission; FL4, 633 nm excitation/>670 nm emission) were collected. Data collection thresholds were set based on FSC and SSC profiles for undifferentiated fibroblasts (Fig. 1A) to omit small light scattering debris and machine noise from the analysis. Fluorescence detector gains were set so that background autofluorescence in noninfected cells was collected in the first log decade of the detector range. Gating—Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells contain three populations of light scattering objects: fully differentiated adipocytes, nondifferentiated fibroblasts, and necrotic cells that have died during the differentiation process (debris). The nondifferentiated fibroblasts were separated from the adipocytes and dead cell debris by setting an elliptical gate in SSC and FSC (low scatter cells (LSC); Fig. 1, B and D). Differentiated adipocytes were resolved from residual fibroblasts by setting an elliptical gate in SSC and FSC (high scatter cells (HSC); Fig. 1B). A second elliptical gate in SSC and FL3 autofluorescence was used to separate adipocytes from necrotic cell debris (Fig. 1C). Cells expressing the HA-Glut4/GFP reporter construct (LG4) were separated from cells that do not express the reporter (NV) using a gate in SSC and FL1 (Fig. 2). Gated populations (adipocytes, fibroblasts, and debris) were sorted using a Beckman Coulter EPICS Elite ESP sorter. Cells were collected on glass slides and imaged by differential interference contrast microscopy (Fig. 1E). Anti-Glut4 Labeling in Fixed Cells—Differentiated control (NV) and HA-Glut4/GFP lentivirus-infected (LG4) 3T3-L1 cells were suspended by collagenase digestion in PBS plus 2% BSA. The cell suspension was brought to 4% gluteraldehyde (methanol-free EM grade; Polysciences) by the addition of 16% gluteraldahyde, mixed by gentle pipetting, and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Fix was quenched by the addition of PBS plus 5% BSA (5 times the volume of the gluteraldahyde-fixed cell suspension). Cells were washed three times by centrifugation (1000 × g for 3 min) and resuspended in PBS plus 2% BSA. Washed cells were permeabilized with IntraPrep (Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Permeabilized cells were labeled with polyclonal anti-Glut4 antibody (raised against the C-terminal 30 amino acids) for 1 h at room temperature, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in PBS plus 2% BSA. Pelleting/resuspension was repeated three times to remove excess free anti-Glut4 antibody. Cells were then labeled with Alexa647-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary. Control cells were labeled with Alexa647 anti-rabbit IgG antibody alone. After labeling, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. 1A). Purification and Labeling of Anti-HA—Anti-HA.11 antibody (Covance) was purified from ascites on a fast flow protein A column (GE Health Sciences) following manufacturer's recommended protocols. Briefly, ascites was diluted 10-fold in high salt loading buffer (3 m NaCl, 1.5 m glycine, pH 8.9) and injected onto the protein A column (pre-equilibrated in high salt loading buffer). The antibody-loaded protein A column was washed with 10 ml of high salt loading buffer. Bound anti-HA was eluted in 100 mm citric acid, pH 4.0. Eluted antibody was collected in 0.5-ml fractions into tubes containing 100 μl of 150 mm Tris, pH 8.1. Protein-containing fractions (absorbance 280 nm) were pooled and exchanged into PBS using a 5-ml desalting column (GE Health Sciences). Purified anti-HA was then labeled for 2 h at room temperature with constant stirring with succinimidyl ester Alexa647 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommended protocols. Free dye was removed by exchange into PBS using a 5-ml desalting column (GE Health Sciences). Labeled antibody was stored in PBS at 4 °C. Absorbance spectroscopy was used to determine both the concentration of labeled antibody ([P]) and the concentration of Alexa647 ([Alexa]) in the eluate as follows. [P]=(A280-(A647×0.03))/203,000cm-1m-1(Eq. 1) [Alexa]=A647/239,000cm-1m-1(Eq. 2) Anti-HA Labeling in Live Cells—3T3-L1 cells differentiated in 96-well plates were serum-starved for 2 h in 50 μl of DMEM, 0.5% FBS and then incubated with or without insulin (100 nm or as indicated) for the indicated times. For surface labeling experiments, the cells were chilled to 4 °C and then incubated at 4 °C in medium containing 50 μg/ml Alexa647-conjugated anti-HA. For uptake experiments, the starvation medium was replaced with prewarmed medium (with or without insulin) containing Alexa647-conjugated anti-HA antibody at the indicated concentrations. Cells were incubated in the continuous presence of anti-HA antibody at 37 °C for the indicated times. To stop labeling, cells were placed on ice, antibody-containing medium was removed, and plates were washed two times with 100 μl of ice-cold PBS. For the recovery experiments, the insulin-containing medium was removed, and cells were washed and incubated for 5 min total (two quick washes, two 2-min incubations) in low pH buffer (18Gibbs E.M. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16597-16603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rinsed twice in medium, and then incubated in medium without insulin at 37 °C for the indicated times (measured from time of insulin removal) prior to surface labeling or the antibody uptake experiment. After labeling, cells were suspended by collagenase digestion at 4 °C and analyzed by flow cytometry. Collagenase digestion does not affect the anti-HA antibody bound to the cell surface, even after long incubation times (12Muretta J.M. Romenskaia I. Cassiday P.A. Mastick C.C. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1168-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—The flow cytometric data were analyzed using Flowjo software (Tree Star Inc.). For each population of cells (adipocytes, fibroblasts, all cells) within each sample the geometric mean of FL4 was determined for both the HA-Glut4/GFP-positive and -negative (uninfected) cells. The mean fluorescence of the uninfected cells measures autofluorescence and nonspecific binding (BG). The background fluorescence varied with the time of incubation with anti-HA but was always less than 15% of total FL4 (supplemental Fig. 2D). The background-corrected mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was calculated as MFI = FL4-BG. The geometric mean of FL1 was determined for the HA-Glut4/GFP-positive cells. The FL1 MFI of uninfected cells (autofluorescence) was less than 5% of the FL1 MFI of infected cells (Fig. 2C); therefore, uncorrected FL1 MFIs were used in analysis. To correct for HA-Glut4/GFP expression levels, mean fluorescence ratios (MFRs) were calculated as MFR = MFI FL4/MFI FL1. This parameter is similar to calculations made by Martin et al. (3Martin O.J. Lee A. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 484-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and Govers et al. (4Govers R. Coster A.C. James D.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6456-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To correct for differences in the Alexa647 labeling efficiencies in different batches of labeled anti-HA antibody, the MFRs were standardized to the calculated maximum MFR (MFRmax) for cells treated with 100 nm insulin in each experiment. To calculate MFRmax, the anti-HA uptake time course for insulin-stimulated cells was fit by a single exponential relaxation using Origin 7.5 software. Replicates—The data points shown in the figures are the average MFR ± S.E. from 2-10 separate experiments (as indicated). Curves are exponential fits of the averaged data. The calculated kobs values obtained from fits of the average MFRs were similar to the average kobs from fits of the individual experiments (i.e. analysis of eight uptake experiments, fit of average MFRs: basal kobs = 0.012 ± 0.003 min-1 and insulin kobs = 0.036 ± 0.003; average kobs from fits of eight individual experiments: basal kobs = 0.013 ± 0.003 min-1 and insulin kobs = 0.040 ± 0.005). 3T3-L1 Adipocyte Cultures Are a Heterogeneous Population of Cells—Cultures of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts or differentiated adipocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1). Dual parameter histograms of side scatter versus forward scatter and side scatter versus autofluorescence (FL3) were analyzed. Cultures of confluent fibroblasts contain a single population of cells with low scatter and low autofluorescence (Fig. 1A) (data not shown). In contrast, the cultures of differentiated adipocytes are mixed populations of cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Two populations can be resolved based on scatter profiles: HSC and LSC. The high scatter objects can be further resolved into two populations, one with low autofluorescence and one with high autofluorescence (Fig. 1C). The high scatter, low autofluorescence cells are differentiated adipocytes. They contain lipid droplets (Fig. 1E) and express Glut4 (supplemental Fig. 1). The highly autofluorescent, high scatter objects are necrotic cell debris. They are very granular, with rough surfaces (Fig. 1E) and are highly autofluorescent in all detector channels (supplemental Fig. 1). The low scatter cells are indistinguishable in optical properties from confluent nondifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 1D). These are residual nondifferentiated fibroblasts. They contain no lipid droplets (Fig. 1E), express no Glut4 (supplemental Fig. 1), and spread and divide when replated on tissue culture dishes (data not shown). Propidium iodide staining showed that the adipocytes and fibroblasts are viable intact cells, whereas many of the necrotic cells are permeabilized (data not shown). Highly autofluorescent necrotic cells could also be detected by microscopy in intact monolayers of differentiated cells and were not solely the result of cell breakage during collagenase digestion and suspension of the cells (data not shown). The relative proportion of fibroblasts and necrotic debris to adipocytes was similar in samples within a single set of differentiated cells but varied from one batch of differentiated cells to the next. The number of residual fibroblasts tended to decrease with days post-initiation of differentiation, whereas the necrotic cells tended to increase. For analysis, elliptical gates in side scatter versus forward scatter were used to separate adipocytes from the residual fibroblasts. A second elliptical gate in side scatter versus FL3 was used to eliminate the highly autofluorescent necrotic cell debris from the adipocyte population. 3T3-L1 Adipocytes Are a Homogenous Population of Cells—An epitope-tagged HA-Glut4/GFP reporter construct was used to follow the traffic of Glut4 in differentiated adipocytes (8Dawson K.

The Mnks are targeted to the translational machinery through their interaction with the cap-binding initiation factor complex. We tested whether proteins retained on cap resin were substrates for the Mnks in vitro, and identified one such protein as PSF (the PTB (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein)-associated splicing factor). Mnks phosphorylate PSF at two sites in vitro, and our data show that PSF is an Mnk substrate in vivo. We also demonstrate that PSF, together with its partner, p54nrb, binds RNAs that contain AU-rich elements (AREs), such as those for proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)). Indeed, PSF associates specifically with the TNFα mRNA in living cells. PSF is phosphorylated at two sites by the Mnks. Our data show that Mnk-mediated phosphorylation increases the binding of PSF to the TNFα mRNA in living cells. These findings identify a novel Mnk substrate. They also suggest that the Mnk-catalyzed phosphorylation of PSF may regulate the fate of specific mRNAs by modulating their binding to PSF·p54nrb.

Zipori D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These proteins also cooperate in the inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 mRNA expression (2Zolotukhin A.S. Michalowski D. Bear J. Smulevitch S.V. Traish A.M. Peng R. Patton J. Shatsky I.N. Felber B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6618-6630Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, PSF is also been reported to repress gene expression through its association with nuclear hormone receptors (3Mathur M. Tucker P.W. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2298-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) or through binding to insulin-like growth factor-1 response elements (4Urban R.J. Bodenburg Y.H. Wood T.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E423-E427PubMed Google Scholar). PSF and p54nrb are both phosphoproteins. Phosphorylation may be involved in the relocalization of PSF during apoptosis (5Shav-Tal Y. Cohen M.

Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 245-293Google Scholar). The cap is bound by eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E, which also binds to the scaffold eIF4G and through this with other translational factors to recruit the 40 S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA. eIF4G also binds the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), which interacts with the 3′-end of the mRNA, thus circularizing it (reviewed in Ref. 9Sachs A. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 447-465Google Scholar).eIF4E is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by the MAP kinase-signal integrating (or MAP kinase-interacting) kinases (Mnks) (10Waskiewicz A.J.

There are two Mnk genes in humans, each of which generates two different polypeptides as a consequence of alternative splicing (14Scheper G.C. Parra J.-L. Wilson M.L. van Kollenburg B.

The longer Mnk1 isoform, Mnk1a, is switched on by signaling through the ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways, whereas Mnk2a (the longer Mnk2 isoform), in contrast, shows high basal activity (11Wang X.

We recently showed that Mnks play an important role in the control of the production of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in T-cells (18Buxade M. Parra J.L. Rousseau S. Shpiro N. Marquez R. Morrice N. Bain J. Espel E. Proud C.G. Immunity. 2005; 23: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).The 3′-untranslated regions of the TNFα mRNA and many other cytokines contain regulatory AU-rich elements (AREs), which regulate their stability and/or translation through their interaction with ARE-binding proteins (19Barreau C. Paillard L. Osborne H.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 7138-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Specific stimuli increase the stability and/or translation of such mRNAs, and this is important in controlling the production of cytokines such as TNFα (reviewed Ref. 20Zhang T. Kruys V. Huez G. Gueydan C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), which is regulated through signaling pathways that include ERK and p38 MAP kinase α/β (21Karin M. Proc. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2005; 2: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), i.e. the pathways that regulate Mnk1. Here, we show that PSF·p54nrb interacts with ARE-containing RNAs and that PSF is phosphorylated and regulated by the Mnks.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals—All chemicals and biochemicals were from Sigma.Antibodies—These were obtained as follows: anti-human eIF4E was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 5–23 of the protein, anti-PSF phospho-Ser8 was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 2–13 of the protein (at Diagnostics Scotland), anti-eIF4G and anti-PABP were kindly provided by Dr. Simon Morley (University of Sussex).

Fox (University of Dundee), pRK7-4EHP was a kind gift from Dr. Andrew R. Tee (now University of Cardiff), and pCDNA3-CBP20 was a kind gift from Dr. Richard Cerione (Departments of Chemistry and Chemical Biology and Molecular Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York).Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant eIF4E was obtained as described previously (22Stern B.D. Wilson M. Jagus R. Protein Expr. Purif. 1993; 4: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recombinant PSF and p54nrb were expressed as His-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli strain BL21. Briefly, after a 5-h induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C, cells expressing PSF or p54nrb were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8). After one freeze-thaw cycle, cells were incubated for 30 min on ice with 5 mg of lysozyme per liter of bacteria culture. After sonication, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 5% (v/v) glycerol were added, and after a 15-min incubation on ice, cells were centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. Proteins were pulled down from the supernatant with 300 μl of nickel (Ni)-agarose resin. After elution of the proteins with 300 mm imidazole, they were dialyzed 3 times for 1 h and 30 min at 4 °C against buffer B (50 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, pH 7.7).RNA Affinity Chromatography—RNA affinity chromatography was performed as described (23Rousseau S. Morrice N. Peggie M. Campbell D.G. Gaestel M. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6505-6514Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) with biotinylated RNA oligoribonucleotides encoding the AU-rich region of mouse TNFα (UUAUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUU), mouse granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (UUUUUAAAUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAAUUUU), human c-Fos (GUUUUUAAUUUAUUUAUUAAGAUGGAUUCU), mouse interferon γ (AAACCUAUUUAUUAAUAUUUAAAACUAUUUAUAUG), human COX-2 (CUAAUGAUCAUAUUUAUUUAUUUAUAUGAACCAUG), or a negative-control sequence (AAGCUUGGGCUGCAGGUCGACUCUAGAGGA). The TNFα and negative-control oligo RNAs were purchased from Dharmacon, the rest were a kind gift from Dr. Simon Rousseau (University of Dundee, Scotland).In Vitro Binding Assays—In vitro RNA-binding assays were performed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with 5 μg/μl bovine serum albumin. The specified protein(s) (PSF, p54nrb, and/or eIF4E, 30 pmol) and, where indicated, 175 pmol of biotinylated oligoribonucleotide containing the TNFα AREs, were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C prior to the addition of the resin (m7GTP-Sepharose, Sepharose CL-4B, nickel-agarose, or streptavidin-agarose beads, 15 μl of packed beads). The mixture was then incubated for a further 1 h at 4 °C. Then the beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer to be analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Resin Chromatography—After washing with PBS, 1 × 10-cm plate of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were lysed with 400 μl of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g to remove cell debris. The supernatant was incubated with 20 μl of packed beads of m7GTP-Sepharose or Sepharose CL-4B. After 2 h the beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer. Unless stated otherwise, beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer to be analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The material retained on m7GTP-Sepharose was incubated with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A and 160 units/ml RNase T1 at 16 °C for various times (see legends).Immunoprecipitations—2 μg of anti-myc, 6 μg of anti-PSF, or 15 μg of anti-FLAG antibodies were added to 300 μg of cell extracts, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, protein G-Sepharose (20 μl of packed beads per immunoprecipitation) in wash buffer (lysis buffer without Triton X-100) were added and allowed to bind the antibody for an additional hour at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with 500 μl of this wash buffer and finally resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer.Ribonucleoprotein Immunoprecipitation Assay—Reversible cross-linking combined with IP to study RNA-protein interactions in vivo was performed as described previously (24Niranjanakumari S. Lasda E. Brazas R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Methods. 2002; 26: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 × 106 Jurkat cells left untreated or activated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 for 1.5 h were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% formaldehyde. Sonicated lysates were subjected to IP with 20 μg of anti-PSF antibody. After extensive washing, the beads were incubated at 70 °C for 45 min to reverse the cross-links, the RNA was purified using TRIzol® (according to the manufacturer's instructions, Invitrogen), and the immunoprecipitated RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR or RT-quantitative (Q)-PCR.RT-PCR and RT-Q-PCR Amplification Analysis—Total RNA extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) or RNA extracted from the PSF immunoprecipitates (TRIzol method, Invitrogen) were treated with 160 units/ml RNase-free DNase I and then subjected to reverse transcription using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)15/Random primers (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, PCR using the Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) was performed using specific primers to amplify cDNAs for either glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or TNFα. The primers used here are TCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCG and AGCAGGGATGATGTTCTGGAGAG for GAPDH, and CAGAGGGAAGAGTTCCCCAG and CCTTGGTCTGGTAGGAGACG for TNFα.For RT-Q-PCR analysis, TaqMan Gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) were used. References are Hs00174128_m1 for human TNFα, Hs99999901_s1 for the 18 S ribosomal RNA, and Hs00174086_m1 for interleukin-10.SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Polyacrylamide gels raging from 10 to 15% were used to analyze protein content of the lysates. The proteins were either transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and detected by Western blot analysis or were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and detected by a fluorescence-based detection method (using the LiCOR Odyssey™ system).Cell Culture and Transfection Experiments—Jurkat T-cells were grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml).HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) serum, penicillin, and streptomycin and cultured in 10-cm dishes in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. HEK293 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method whereby a calcium/phosphate (125 mm CaCl2, 50 mm BES, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm sodium hydrogen orthophosphate)/DNA co-precipitate is added to the cells. HEK293 cells were split to a density of 2 × 106 cells per 10-cm diameter dish and after 8 h at 37 °C in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, cells were transfected with 1 μg/ml DNA co-precipitated per dish. After transfection, cells were placed in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. If cells were to be stimulated, 24 h after transfection they were starved of serum overnight and then stimulated. Otherwise they were lysed 36 h after transfection. Where non-transfected cells were used, they were starved of serum overnight prior to stimulation, and then stimulated with 100 nm insulin, 1 μm tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), or 100 μm arsenite for 30 min.In Vitro Protein Kinase Assays and Peptide Mapping—Recombinant His-tagged Mnk1 or -2 (0.04 μg/μl) was activated in vitro with active SAPK2α (p38 MAPKα, final concentration, 1 unit/ml; from DSTT, University of Dundee) and 100 μm ATP in kinase buffer (100 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 250 mm KCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm Na3VO4). After 2 h at 30 °C, SB203580 at a final concentration of 10 μm was added. 5 μl of active Mnk was used to phosphorylate proteins bound to 20 μl of m7GTP-Sepharose in vitro in the presence of 100 μm ATP and [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli buffer with 10 mm dithiothreitol and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Phosphorylated proteins were separated in a 15% acrylamide/bisacrylamide gel. Labeled bands detected by autoradiography were excised and subjected to tryptic digestion (25Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N. Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were detected by precursor ion scanning in the negative ion mode as described previously (26Williamson B.L. Marchese J. Morrice N.A. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2006; 5: 337-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Active Mnk1 or -2 was also used to phosphorylate recombinant PSF. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli denaturing buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Cysteines were alkylated with iodoacetamide for 45 min at 30 °C and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. The labeled protein was excised from the gel and digested overnight with trypsin. Samples were acidified by adding 3 volumes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile and peptides were separated by reverse-phase chromatography on a Vydac C18 (250 × 4.6 mm inner diameter) column equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and developed with a gradient of acetonitrile. Fractions containing radioactivity were collected and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and solid-phase sequencing. Two-dimensional mapping was described previously (27Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar) using a second dimension buffer containing isobutyric acid.Cellular Fractionation—10 × 106 Jurkat cells were harvested in 300 μl of EZ lysis® buffer (Sigma) with the addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin. After centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 × g at 4 °C, the cytoplasmic fraction was transferred to a new tube. The nuclear pellet was washed twice with 500 μl of EZ Lysis® buffer and then lysed by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer.RESULTSMnks Phosphorylate PSF in Vitro—Because the Mnks bind to the eIF4F cap-binding complex and phosphorylate at least two of its components, eIF4E and eIF4G (10Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 28Pyronnet S. Imataka H. Gingras A.C. Fukunaga R. Hunter T. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), we reasoned that additional proteins associated with this complex might be substrates for the Mnks. We therefore performed affinity purifications from cytoplasmic lysates of HEK293 cells using m7GTP-Sepharose beads and incubated the bound material with highly active Mnk1 and [γ-32P]ATP (i.e. using a modified version of the KESTREL procedure (29Knebel A. Morrice N. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4360-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar)). The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Four major radiolabeled bands were observed (Fig. 1A). The lowest molecular weight band, as judged from its electrophoretic mobility corresponded to eIF4E. A prominent band corresponded to the added Mnk (see kinase-only (Mnk1) lane in Fig. 1A), which undergoes extensive autophosphorylation (Mnk was also identified by mass spectrometry, Table 1).TABLE 1Identification by mass fingerprinting of proteins retained on m7GTP-Sepharose, phosphorylated by Mnk1 (Fig. 1A)Name of protein matchedProtein accession No.Mass of proteinSpecies matched toScoreaScore is -10 × log(P), where P is the probability that the observed match is a random event.

Protein scores greater than 73 are significant (p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab Two other major radiolabeled bands were excised from the gel. The proteins contained in these bands were identified by tryptic mass fingerprint analysis as eIF4G and PSF (Fig. 1A, Table 1). Although eIF4G and eIF4E are known to be retained on m7GTP-Sepharose and be substrates for the Mnks, PSF has not previously been reported to be retained on the cap resin or to be an Mnk substrate. The identification of PSF was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). Also present among the proteins that bound m7GTP-Sepharose was p54nrb, which associates with PSF (1Shav-Tal Y. Zipori D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B), as well as PABP, which interacts with eIF4G (30Imataka H. Gradi A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In contrast, the RNA-binding protein La was not retained on the m7GTP-Sepharose resin (Fig. 1B).PSF·p54nrb Do Not Bind Directlyto eIF4E or to m7GTP—There were several possible reasons why PSF· p54nrb might be found in material isolated on m7GTP-Sepharose: (i) one or both proteins bind directly to eIF4E (or another cap-binding protein such as, the cap-binding complex component CBP20 (31Izaurralde E. Lewis J. McGuigan C. Jankowska M. Darzynkiewicz E. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 657-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) or the eIF4E-homologous protein, 4E-HP (32Rom E. Kim H.C. Gingras A.-C. Marcotrigiano J. Favre D. Olsen H. Burley S.K. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13104-13109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)); (ii) one or both proteins bind to the m7GTP-cap resin directly; or (iii) they are brought down on the cap resin through their interaction with RNA, which in turn is bound by proteins such as eIF4A, eIF4B, and PABP, all of which bind eIF4G, and thus are indirectly associated with eIF4E. They can therefore be isolated on the cap resin (33Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar).Neither PSF nor p54nrb contains the YXXXXϕϕ motif (where ϕ represents a hydrophobic residue) found in bona fide eIF4E-binding proteins (34Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so it seemed unlikely that they bound to eIF4E in the same way as, for example, eIF4G. However, it was possible that one or both did so via a different type of interaction with eIF4E. To test for a direct interaction between eIF4E and PSF·p54nrb, we studied whether recombinant hexahistidine (His6)-tagged PSF·p54nrb bound recombinant eIF4E. His6-PSF/His6-p54nrb was, as expected, retained on nickel-agarose, whereas eIF4E was not. When eIF4E was mixed with His6-PSF/His6-p54nrb prior to incubation with nickel-agarose, the PSF·p54nrb was again retained on the beads, but eIF4E was not (Fig. 2A). In similar experiments, recombinant eIF4E did bind to a known partner, eIF4E-binding protein 1, demonstrating the utility of the approach (data not shown).FIGURE 2PSF·p54nrb do not bind directly to eIF4E, 4E-HP, or CBP20.A, 30 pmol of His-PSF, His-p54nrb, and/or untagged recombinant eIF4E (made in bacteria) were used in in vitro binding assays with nickel-agarose beads (SN, supernatant). B, Western blots from anti-PSF or anti-myc immunoprecipitates (IP) obtained from insulin-stimulated (100 nm, 30 min) HEK293 cells that had been transfected with pCS3MT-eIF4E(myc-tagged eIF4E) or with empty vector(V).C, Western blots from anti-PSF or anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates obtained from insulin-stimulated (100 nm, 30 min) HEK293 cells transfected with pRK7–4EHP (FLAG-tagged) or empty vector (V). D, as B but HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-CBP20 (hemagglutinin-tagged CBP20) or empty vector (Vector) and immunoprecipitates prepared from lysates from serum-fed cells, using anti-hemagglutinin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As a further test, eIF4E was expressed in HEK293 cells as a myc-tagged fusion, and immunoprecipitated with anti-myc. No PSF or p54nrb was recovered in the immunoprecipitate, whereas eIF4G (a positive control that binds directly to eIF4E) was recovered in this fraction (Fig. 2B). These findings again indicate the absence of a direct interaction of PSF·p54nrb with eIF4E or, probably, with eIF4G.To test for possible interactions with two other m7GTP-binding proteins, 4E-HP and CBP20, these proteins were individually expressed as FLAG- or hemagglutinin-tagged fusions in HEK293 cells, and then immunoprecipitated from the lysates. This did not result in the co-precipitation of PSF or p54nrb, indicating that neither of these cap-binding proteins interacts with PSF·p54nrb either directly or indirectly (Fig. 2, C and D).To test whether PSF or p54nrb could bind directly to m7GTP, purified recombinant PSF and p54nrb (made in bacteria, which lacks cap-binding proteins) were mixed with m7GTP-Sepharose or, as a negative control, CL-4B beads. Very little retention of either protein on the beads was seen (Fig. 3A). Nevertheless, it remained possible that PSF·p54nrb did interact directly with the m7GTP-Sepharose beads, although because PSF and p54nrb are both nucleotide (RNA)-binding proteins, the interaction could be nonspecific. We therefore studied the specificity of the binding of PSF·p54nrb to this resin. To do this, we assessed the ability of PSF·p54nrb, and as a control for a genuine m7GTP-binding protein, eIF4E, to bind m7GTP-Sepharose in the presence of an excess of free m7GTP or GTP nucleotides. As shown in Fig. 3B, eIF4E was not retained on the resin in the presence of m7GTP (as expected), whereas PSF·p54nrb was excluded by either m7GTP or GTP. These data suggest that PSF or p54nrb (or other components of nucleoprotein complexes in which they are involved) can bind to nucleotide affinity resins.FIGURE 3Characterization of the retention of PSF·p54nrb on m7GTP-Sepharose.A, 30 pmol of recombinant His-PSF or His-p54nrb made in E. coli were assayed in vitro for binding to"

The aim of this study is to define the mechanisms by which bone marrow progenitor cells are mobilized in response to cardiac ischemic injury. We used a closed-chest model of murine cardiac infarction/reperfusion, which segregated the surgical thoracotomy from the induction of cardiac infarction, so that we could study isolated fluctuations in cytokines without the confounding impact of surgery. We show here that bone marrow activation of the c-kit tyrosine kinase receptor in response to released soluble KitL is necessary for bone marrow progenitor cell mobilization after ischemic cardiac injury. We also show that release of KitL and c-kit activation require the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 within the bone marrow compartment. Finally, we demonstrate that mice with c-kit dysfunction develop cardiac failure after myocardial infarction and that bone marrow transplantation rescues the failing cardiac phenotype. In light of the ongoing trials of progenitor cell therapy for heart disease, our study outlines the endogenous repair mechanisms that are invoked after cardiac injury. Amplification of this pathway may aid in restoration of cardiac function after myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W2060022944,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) promotes cell survival through the activation of G protein-coupled LPA receptors. However, whether different LPA receptors activate distinct anti-apoptotic signaling pathways is not yet clear. Here we report a novel mechanism by which the LPA(2) receptor targets the proapoptotic Siva-1 protein for LPA-dependent degradation, thereby attenuating Siva-1 function in DNA damage response. The carboxyl-terminal tail of the LPA(2) receptor, but not LPA(1) or LPA(3) receptor, specifically associates with the carboxyl cysteine-rich domain of Siva-1. Prolonged LPA stimulation promotes the association of Siva-1 with the LPA(2) receptor and targets both proteins for ubiquitination and degradation. As a result, adriamycin-induced Siva-1 protein stabilization is attenuated by LPA in an LPA(2)-dependent manner, and the function of Siva-1 in promoting DNA damage-induced apoptosis is inhibited by LPA pretreatment. Consistent with this result, inhibition of the LPA(2) receptor expression increases Siva-1 protein levels and augments adriamycin-induced caspase-3 cleavage and apoptosis. Together, these findings reveal a critical and specific role for the LPA(2) receptor through which LPA directly inactivates a critical component of the death machinery to promote cell survival."

In addition, HSFs are involved in cellular differentiation and development by regulating development-related genes, as well as heat shock genes. Here, we showed chronic sinusitis and mild hydrocephalus in postnatal HSF1-null mice, which are associated with impaired mucociliary clearance and cerebrospinal flow, respectively. Analysis of ciliary beating revealed that the amplitude of the beating was significantly reduced, and ciliary beat frequencies were lower in the respiratory epithelium, ependymal cells, oviduct, and trachea of HSF1-null mice than those of wild-type mice. Cilia possess a common axonema structure composed of microtubules of α- and β-tubulin. We found a marked reduction in α- and ciliary βiv-tubulin in the HSF1-null cilia, which is developmentally associated with reduced Hsp90 expression in HSF1-null mice. Treatment of the respiratory epithelium with geldanamycin resulted in rapid reduction of ciliary beating in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, Hsp90 was physically associated with ciliary βiv-tubulin, and Hsp90 stabilizes tubulin polymerization in vitro.

However, we do not know any client protein stabilized by Hsps that is under the control of HSFs in unstressed conditions.We previously showed abnormal nasal cavities in HSF1-null adult mice, which is associated with atrophy of the olfactory epithelium and sinusitis characterized by accumulation of mucus (24Takaki E.

However, the mucus accumulation cannot be explained by this function of HSF1. Here, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlining mucus accumulation in the HSF1-null nasal cavity, and demonstrated that HSF1 is required to maintain ciliary beating in many organs, probably by regulating constitutive expression of Hsp90 that facilitates tubulin polymerization. This is the first demonstration that HSF1 plays a role in maintaining dynamic movement of a microstructure in cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSHistopathology and Immunohistochemistry—HSF1-null (7Inouye S.

Sections were counterstained with methyl green. To perform double staining, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel) and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) were used as second antibodies, and the sections were mounted in a Vectashield mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories), and visualized using fluorescence microscopy (Axioplan 2, Zeiss).Estimation of Mucociliary Clearance—Analysis of the nasal mucociliary clearance was performed as described previously with some modifications (31Foster W.M.

Inouye S. Fujimoto M. Tanaka Y. Izu H. Takaki E. Ichikawa H. Rho J. Nakai A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4773-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). At 4 h after the transfection, cells were washed with PBS and incubated further for 44 h in normal medium. Cells were then washed with PBS, harvested, suspended in five packed cell pellet volumes of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) for 10 min on ice. The supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, the 1 μl of preimmune serum or antiserum for Hsp90 (αhHsp90c) was added at 4 °C overnight, and mixed with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (1:1 suspension in PBS) (Amersham Biosciences) by rotating at 4 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of 1 μm geldanamycin. The complexes were washed five times with RIPA buffer, suspended in SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 3 min. The samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were immunoblotted using a mouse monoclonal antibody for GFP (GF200, Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). Alternatively, immunoprecipitation was performed using antibody for GFP, and immunoblot analysis was performed using antiserum for Hsp90.In Vitro Tubulin Polymerization Assay—Hsp90 was purified from mouse L5178Y cells as described previously (37Miyata Y. Yahara I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8123-8129Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and stored in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol at -80 °C until use. A tubulin polymerization assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions for a fluorescence-based tubulin polymerization assay kit (BK011, Cytoskeleton, Inc.). Briefly, a tubulin reaction mixture (50 μl) containing tubulin and a fluorescent reporter was mixed with bovine serum albumin (BSA, Fraction V, Nacalai Tesque), Hsp90 (5 μl), or paclitaxel that promotes microtubule polymerization and stability (38Schiff P.B. Fant J. Horwitz S.B. Nature. 1979; 277: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (3116) Google Scholar) and incubated at 37 °C until 40 min. Fluorescence emission at 460 nm (excitation wavelength is 360 nm) was measured by using a CytoFluor II Fluorescence Multi-well Plate Reader (Per-Septive Biosystems, Inc.).Statistical Analysis—Significant values were determined by analyzing data with the Mann-Whitney's U test using StatView version 4.5J for Macintosh (Abacus Concepts, Berkley, CA). A level of p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSMucus Accumulation in the Nasal Cavity and Hydrocephalus in HSF1-null Mice—Previously, we showed abnormal nasal cavity in HSF1-null adult mice, which is associated with atrophy of the olfactory epithelium and the accumulation of mucus (Fig. 1A, a and d) (24Takaki E. Fujimoto M. Sugahara K. Nakahari T. Yonemura S. Tanaka Y. Hayashida N. Inouye S. Takemoto T. Yamashita H. Nakai A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4931-4937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This revealed that HSF1 is required for maintenance of olfactory neurogenesis. However, the mucus accumulation cannot be explained by this function of HSF1. Furthermore, the accumulation of mucus was not ameliorated in mice deficient for both HSF1 and HSF4, whereas the atrophied olfactory epithelium was partially restored in the same mice (24Takaki E. Fujimoto M. Sugahara K. Nakahari T. Yonemura S. Tanaka Y. Hayashida N. Inouye S. Takemoto T. Yamashita H. Nakai A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4931-4937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We examined the mucociliary clearance in the nasal cavity by monitoring movement of Pelican ink (31Foster W.M. Walters D.M. Longphre M. Macri K. Miller L.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The ink injected into the nasal vestibules was cleared after 1 h, and moved to the posterior turbinates (Fig. 1A, b and c). In contrast, the ink was hardly removed from the vestibules of HSF1-null mice even after 3 h (Fig. 1A, e and f), indicating that the mucociliary clearance was severely impaired in HSF1-null mice. Therefore, HSF1 may have a direct role in mucociliary clearance in the nasal cavity.The whipping movement of the cilia generates moving force of the mucus in the respiratory epithelium. As cilia are present in many organs in the body, any dysfunction caused by genetic mutations of their components cause many phenotypes known as immotile ciliary syndrome or primary ciliary dyskinesia (39Ibanez-Tallon I. Heintz N. Omran H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: R27-R35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Afzelius B.A. Mossberg B. Scriver C.R. Braudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1994: 3943-3954Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the morphology of other organs such as the tracheae, oviducts, and ventricles. Histological examination showed grossly normal morphology in the tracheae and oviducts in 6-week-old HSF1-null mice. However, we noticed hydrocephalus in HSF1-null 6-week-old mice (Fig. 1B). All of the ventricles, including the aqueduct and fourth ventricle, were enlarged, indicating communicating hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus was observed even in 3-week-old HSF1-null mice, but not in 2-week-old mice (data not shown). Degeneration of neural cells was not found in the brains of 6-week-old HSF1-null mice (data not shown) (20Santos S.D. Saraiva M.J. Neuroscience. 2004; 126: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One possible reason for this phenotype may be impaired flow of cerebrospinal fluid (41Ibanez-Tallon I. Pagenstecher A. Fliegauf M. Olbrich H. Kispert A. Ketelsen U.P. North A. Heintz N. Omran H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the ependymal flow in isolated ventricles by dropping a small amount of Pelican ink onto the exposed surfaces of dissected walls of the lateral ventricles (Fig. 1C). The ink moved along the expected cerebrospinal fluid flow on the wall in wild-type mice, but stayed in the same place and hardly moved in HSF1-null mice. These results indicate that the ependymal flow is impaired in HSF1-null mice, and this is consistent with the notion of ciliary dysfunction in both the respiratory epithelium and ependymal cells.Ciliary Beating Is Severely Impaired in HSF1-null Mice—To examine whether or not ciliary movement is impaired in HSF1-null mice, we monitored ciliary beating in the freshly isolated respiratory epithelium of the nasal cavity. The differential interference contrast image showed beating cilia located on the surface of respiratory cells, and each cilium movement was detected by video (supplementary Movies 1 and 2) (33Kawakami M.

Mori H. Yoshida H. Nakahari T. Exp. Physiol. 2005; 90: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In wild-type mice, the whipping movement of the cilia was observed and CBF was 13.27 ± 1.53 Hz (Fig. 2A). In marked contrast, the beating amplitude was significantly low, and CBF reduced to 8.70 ± 1.72 Hz in HSF1-null mice. Similarly, CBF in the ventricles of wild-type mice was 18.65 ± 2.54 Hz, whereas that of HSF1-null mice was 8.60 ± 1.82 Hz. Interestingly, the whipping movement of the cilia was markedly impaired even in the tracheae and oviducts (data not shown), and CBF was decreased from 14.38 ± 0.90 and 10.90 ± 0.96 Hz to 11.50 ± 1.82 and 7.52 ± 0.32 Hz in the HSF1-null tracheae and oviducts, respectively (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that HSF1 deficiency causes severe impairment of ciliary beating in many organs.FIGURE 2Ciliary dyskinesia in many organs of HSF1-null mice. A, estimation of CBF. Video differential interference contrast images of the respiratory epithelium (nasal), lateral ventricle (brain), trachea, and oviduct of 6-week-old mice in a slice preparation were monitored. CBFs were estimated from frame images (n = 3). Stars indicate p < 0.05.

Heintz N. Omran H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: R27-R35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we next examined the ultrastructure of the cilia by electron microscopy. In the HSF1-null respiratory epithelium, dynein arms and radial spokes were observed, but almost 10% of the cilia possessed abnormal central microtubules and microtubule doublets such as deletion or transposition (Fig. 2B). These abnormalities were characteristic of some types of ciliary dyskinesia (42Sturgess J.M. Chao J. Turner J.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 303: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although it is unclear whether the abnormal structures in HSF1-null mice may be responsible for ciliary dyskinesia, these results suggest that assembly or organization of microtubules might be impaired.Tubulin Expression Decreases in the Motile Cilia of HSF1-null Mice—As HSF1-null mice have abnormal microtubule ultrastructure, we examined expression of"

Although a host of signaling pathways participate in implantation, decidualization, and placentation, whether there is a common molecular link that coordinates these processes remains unknown. By exploiting genetic, molecular, pharmacological, and physiological approaches, we show here that the nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) δ plays a central role at various stages of pregnancy, whereas maternal PPARδ is critical to implantation and decidualization, and embryonic PPARδ is vital for placentation. Using trophoblast stem cells, we further elucidate that a reciprocal relationship between PPARδ-AKT and leukemia inhibitory factor-STAT3 signaling pathways serves as a cell lineage sensor to direct trophoblast cell fates during placentation. This novel finding of stage-specific integration of maternal and embryonic PPARδ signaling provides evidence that PPARδ is a molecular link that coordinates implantation, decidualization, and placentation crucial to pregnancy success. This study is clinically relevant because deferral of on time implantation leads to spontaneous pregnancy loss, and defective trophoblast invasion is one cause of preeclampsia in humans.

Combining multiple approaches, we show here that although uterine PPARδ is essential for normal implantation and decidualization, embryonic PPARδ via coordinated interaction with AKT and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-STAT3 signaling is vital for specifying trophoblast cell differentiation during placentation. Reagents—Antibodies to anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182), total p38 MAPK, phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), total ERK1/2, phospho-AKT (also known as protein kinase B) (Ser-473), total AKT, phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (Tyr-705), or total STAT3 were obtained from Cell Signaling; anti-cytokeratin was from DAKO Diagnostics; anti-caudal-related homeobox 2 (CDX2) was from BioGenex; and anti-PPARδ, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), or suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Peptide corresponding to amino acids 563-577 of the mouse mature COX-2 protein was used to produce the rabbit antiserum to COX-2, and no cross-reactivity with COX-1 was detected. Biotin-conjugated BS-I Isolectin B4, fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4), heparin, AH-6809, and AH-23848 were purchased from Sigma. LIF was obtained from Chemicon.

PPARδ-/-/FLK1lacZ+/- mice were generated by crossing PPARδ-/- males with FLK1lacZ+/- females on CD1 background. All mice used were housed in the Institutional Animal Care Facility according to National Institutes of Health and institutional guidelines for laboratory animals. Ovulation and Fertilization—To examine ovulation and fertilization, wild-type (WT) or PPARδ-/- mice were bred with fertile males with same genotypes, respectively. Mice were killed on day 2 of pregnancy and oviducts were flushed with Whitten's medium to recovery eggs and embryos. Their morphology was examined under a dissecting microscope (5Song H. Lim H. Paria B.C. Matsumoto H. Swift L.L. Morrow J. Bonventre J.V. Dey S.K. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 2879-2889PubMed Google Scholar).

Uteri of mice without blue bands were flushed with Whitten's medium to recover unimplanted blastocysts. To experimentally induce artificial decidualization, pseudopregnant WT or PPARδ-/- mice received intraluminal infusion of sesame oil (25 μl) in one uterine horn on day 4 and were killed 4 days later. Uterine weights of infused and noninfused (control) horns were recorded, and fold increases in uterine weights served as an index of decidualization (25Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuk J.E.

Other recipients were sacrificed on day 10 for placental analysis. Immunostaining and Lectin Histochemistry—Immunofluorescence staining of PPARδ in preimplantation embryos was performed as described by us (26Wang X. Wang H. Matsumoto H. Roy S.K. Das S.K. Paria B.C. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 4125-4134PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence signals were viewed under a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser microscope. Immunolocalization of PPARδ, COX-2, phospho-AKT, phospho-STAT3, cytokeratin, VCAM-1, PL-I, SOCS3, and CDX2 was performed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin or Bouin's fixed and paraffin-embedded sections of uteri and placentas using a Histostain-SP kit as described (21Chakraborty I. Das S.K. Wang J. Dey S.K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 16: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To examine the maternal vasculature of the labyrinth zone, we performed BS-I Isolectin binding assay, which identifies the cell-surface carbohydrate structure of trophoblast cells lining maternal blood spaces within the labyrinth. Staining was done by the procedure as described (27Natale D.R. Starovic M. Cross J.C. Methods Mol. Med. 2006; 121: 275-293PubMed Google Scholar). Immunohistological and lectin binding analysis were performed on at least 4-6 different implantation sites or placentas at each developmental stage obtained from three different mice. Prostaglandin Assays—PGs were quantitated using gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometric assays as described previously (7Lim H. Gupta R.A. Ma W.G. Paria B.C.

Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 1071-1083PubMed Google Scholar). Antisense 35S-labeled or 32P-labeled cRNA probes were generated using appropriate polymerases from mouse-specific cDNAs. Northern hybridized bands were quantified using a personal densitometer (GE Healthcare). LacZ Staining—LacZ staining in frozen sections was performed as described previously by us (29Ma W. Tan J.

Trophoblast Stem (TS) Cell Culture—WT or PPARδ-/- TS cell lines were generated as reported previously (30Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J.

Cells were maintained in a proliferative state in media containing 70% embryonic mouse fibroblast cells conditioned medium, 30% TS cell medium, FGF4 (25 ng/ml), and heparin (1 μg/ml). To induce TS cell differentiation, cells were cultured in medium free of sera, FGF4, and heparin for 2-6 days with medium changes every day. Western Blotting—Protein extraction and Western blotting were performed as described previously (31Scherle P.A. Ma W. Lim H. Dey S.K. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37086-37092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Antibodies to total and phospho-ERK1/2, p38, AKT, or STAT3 were used. Bands were visualized using an ECL kit and quantitated using a personal densitometer (GE Healthcare). Statistical Analysis—Comparison of means was performed using a one-tailed Student's t test. Data are shown as means ± S.E. PPARδ Deficiency Limits Term Pregnancy Success—To delineate PPARδ functions in pregnancy, we first analyzed pregnancy outcome in PPARδ-/- mice on CD1 background. Although homozygous null females give birth to viable pups, the litter size is significantly smaller compared with WT females (Fig. 1A). To search for the cause of reduced litter size, we examined early pregnancy events in PPARδ-/- mice. Ovulation and Fertilization Are Normal in PPARδ-/- Mice—To examine ovulation and fertilization status in PPARδ-/- mice, we recorded the number of ovulated eggs and fertilized two-cell embryos on day 2 of pregnancy. Normal ovulation and fertilization were noted in PPARδ-/- females mated with null males. As shown in Fig. 1B, all null females ovulated with comparable numbers of ova as WT females. The yield of two-cell embryos among ovulated eggs determined the fertilization rate. The number of two-cell embryos was similar in both WT and null females (Fig. 1C). Because PPARδ is dispensable for normal ovulation or fertilization, we continued our search for the cause of reduced fertility post-fertilization in PPARδ-/- mice. PPARδ Deficiency Defers On Time Implantation—Using immunofluorescence, we first examined PPARδ expression in preimplantation embryos, and we noted that PPARδ is localized in the nucleus at all stages of embryos spanning 1-cell zygotes to blastocysts (Fig. 1D). This observation suggests that PPARδ signaling could be important during early pregnancy. Thus, we next compared implantation status in WT and mutant mice. As shown in Fig. 1, E and F, whereas 45 and 100% of WT mice showed distinct implantation sites at 2000 and 2400 h on day 4, respectively, none of the PPARδ-/- females showed implantation even at 0100 h on day 5 as examined by the blue dye method. Unimplanted blastocysts with normal morphology were recovered (Fig. 1G), indicating their normal development. However, over 90% (10 of 11) of null mice showed blue bands when examined at 0800 h on day 5, suggesting deferred implantation in PPARδ-/- females. This result provides the first genetic evidence that PPARδ is critical for timely onset of implantation. Maternal PPARδ Is Crucial for Normal Implantation—To ascertain the relative contribution of uterine versus embryonic PPARδ in implantation, we performed reciprocal blastocyst transfer experiments. Day 4 WT or PPARδ-/- blastocysts were transferred into PPARδ-/- or WT recipients on day 4 of pseudopregnancy. As shown in Table 1, WT blastocysts implanted normally after transfer into WT recipients (65 and 66% on days 5 and 6, respectively). In contrast, WT blastocysts transferred into PPARδ-/- recipients had considerably reduced implantation rate when examined on day 5; only 21% of transferred blastocysts showed implantation in 6 of 11 mutant recipients. But when examined on day 6, all mice showed implantation with an average of 44% implantation sites, reinforcing that implantation is deferred in the absence of maternal PPARδ. Reduced implantation rates were not observed when PPARδ-/- blastocysts were transferred into WT uteri; 60% of blastocysts transferred showed implantation in all mice examined on days 5 and 6. Collectively, the results show that maternal, but not embryonic, PPARδ is a major contributor to on time implantation.TABLE 1Implantation of blastocysts transferred into pseudopregnant WT or PPARδ−/− miceGenotypesDay of sacrificeNo. of blastocysts transferredNo. of recipientsNo. of mice with IS (%)No. of IS (%)No. of blastocysts recoveredBlastocystsRecipients+/++/+59677 (100)62 (65)NA67666 (100)50 (66)NA+/+−/−5172116 (55)36 (21)ap < 0.05 (Student's t test).29614499 (100)64 (44)NA−/−+/+57266 (100)49 (68)NA65655 (100)36 (64)NAa p < 0.05 (Student's t test). Open table in a new tab PGE2 via EP2/4 Receptors Compensates for the Loss of PPARδ during Implantation—Observations of deferred implantation, but not its complete failure, in PPARδ-/- mice suggested that alternative pathways by PGI2 or other PGs may partially compensate for the loss of PPARδ during implantation. To address this issue, we first measured PG levels and found that PGI2 (measured as 6-keto-PGF2α) levels are highest followed by PGE2 and other PGs in WT and PPARδ-/- uteri on day 5 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that PGI2 and PGE2 are major PGs during implantation. Because PGI2 can also function via its cell surface prostaglandin I receptors (IP), we next analyzed expression IP in WT and null uteri to see whether PGI2 signaling via IP receptors is relevant during implantation in PPARδ-/- mice. Similar to our previous report (7Lim H. Gupta R.A. Ma W.G. Paria B.C. Moller D.E. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), uterine IP expression was very low during implantation in WT mice, but in null mice, its expression was detected in a subpopulation of stromal cells just underneath the circular muscle and in interstitial cells within the myometrium on days 4 and 5 (Fig. 2B). This expression pattern suggests that the role of PGI2 via IP is less important for blastocyst attachment with the luminal epithelium even in the absence of PPARδ. We next compared the expression profile of prostaglandin E receptor (EP) subtypes EP1-4 in WT and null uteri to assess the significance of PGE2 signaling during implantation in the absence of PPARδ. We found that the expression of these receptor subtypes is comparable in both WT and PPARδ-/- uteri. EP4 was primarily expressed in the receptive luminal epithelium on day 4 and EP2 in the luminal epithelium surrounding the implanting blastocyst on day 5 (Fig. 2C), suggesting their potential roles in implantation in null females. In contrast, EP1 is expressed at a very low to undetectable level, and EP3 is primarily expressed in mesometrial stromal cells on day 5, 7H. Wang and S. K. Dey, unpublished results. suggesting their minimal, if any, involvement in blastocyst attachment. These results would imply that PGE2, via EP2/4 receptors, partially offsets the loss of PPARδ during implantation. Thus, we asked if pharmacological inhibition of EP2/4 receptors would further deteriorate implantation in PPARδ-/- mice. Indeed, whereas coadministration of AH-6809 (EP½ antagonist) with AH-23848 (EP4 antagonist) at 5 mg each/kg·body weight on day 4 failed to inhibit implantation in WT mice, the same treatment remarkably blocked implantation in PPARδ-/- mice when examined on day 5 (Fig. 2D). This finding points toward a compensatory contribution of PGE2 to implantation in the absence of PPARδ. Decidualization Is Compromised in PPARδ-/- Mice—Because PPARδ is highly expressed in stromal cells with the onset and progression of decidualization (7Lim H. Gupta R.A. Ma W.G. Paria B.C. Moller D.E. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), we speculated that PPARδ deficiency would deter normal decidual development. Indeed, overall decidual growth, as assessed by weights of implantation sites, was substantially reduced in PPARδ-/- females compared with WT females on days 5-8 of pregnancy (Fig. 3A). Reduced decidual responses were also seen in experimentally induced decidualization by intraluminal oil infusion in day 4 pseudopregnant PPARδ-/- in the absence of embryo (Fig. 3B), providing evidence that defective decidualization is because of uterine loss of PPARδ. The reduced decidual growth was correlated with an aberrant pattern and levels of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation in the stroma during blastocyst- and oil-induced decidualization (Fig. 4, C-F). These molecules are known to participate in decidualization (31Scherle P.A. Ma W. Lim H. Dey S.K. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37086-37092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These findings again suggest that maternal PPARδ is critical for normal implantation and decidualization.FIGURE 4Abnormal angiogenesis in PPARδ-/- maternal decidua basalis.

The antimesometrial decidua capsularis progressively degenerates creating room for the growing embryo, whereas the mesometrial decidua basalis undergoes angiogenesis forming a vascularized zone that brings maternal and fetal blood vessels in close proximity to form a functional placenta (1Rossant J. Cross J.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). This timely decidual remodeling is well correlated with shifting of PPARδ expression from the antimesometrial decidua to the mesometrial decidua basalis and to the trophoblast sprouting from the ectoplacental cone (supplemental Fig. S1). Using Flk1lacZ+/- and PPARδ-/-/Flk1lacZ+/- mice that express β-galactosidase as a read out for Flk-1 promoter activity in endothelial cells (23Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar), we observed an abnormal pattern of angiogenesis in the decidua basalis of PPARδ-/- females. As shown in Fig. 4A, the density of lacZ-stained blood vessels was comparable in mesometrial decidua in both WT and null mice on day 8, but the vessel density progressively decreased in WT mesometrial decidua as opposed to sustained higher density in PPARδ-/- decidua on day 10. This aberrant angiogenesis in the absence of PPARδ was associated with altered expressions of COX-2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and angiopoietins (ANG) in decidual basalis. For example, COX-2 transcripts and proteins were highly expressed in WT mesometrial decidual cells underneath the degenerating luminal epithelium on day 8, but the expression was dramatically down-regulated with the onset of placentation on day 10 (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S1). This reduced decidual COX-2 expression is associated with reduced mRNA expression of VEGF164 (Fig. 4C), an active and abundant isoform in mice (32Halder J.B. Zhao X. Soker S. Paria B.C. Klagsbrun M. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Genesis. 2000; 26: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) (Fig. 4D), a key regulator of decidual remodeling (33Das S.K. Yano S.

https://openalex.org/W1997585129,"Coculture of human melanocytes with keratinocytes upregulates CCN3, a matricellular protein critical to maintenance of normal homeostasis of melanocytes in the skin. CCN3 affects two fundamental features of melanocyte physiology: it inhibits melanocyte proliferation and stimulates their adhesion to the basement membrane. Here we report that expression of CCN3 is downregulated in advanced melanomas. Aggressive melanoma cell lines did not respond to treatment with CCN3 inducers, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), while less aggressive melanoma cell lines responded similarly to melanocytes. Immunostaining analyses revealed that CCN3 was present in melanoma cells close to the epidermal–dermal interface, but not in melanoma cells that had invaded deep into the dermis or had metastasized to lymph nodes. Contrary to our expectations, overexpression of CCN3 in 1205Lu metastatic melanoma cells did not affect their adhesion to collagen IV. However, CCN3 decreased the transcription and activation of matrix metalloproteinases and suppressed the invasion of 1205Lu melanoma cells. These results suggest that the lack of CCN3 in advanced melanoma cells contributes to their invasive phenotype. Whereas major matricellular proteins, such as osteopontin, tenascin or secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), are strongly upregulated in melanoma cells; CCN3 is the first member of this family that is downregulated."
https://openalex.org/W2012457501,"In perceptual tasks, subjects attempt to rely on their most informative cues. Such strategic choices should be reflected in the types of sensory neurons that are used. We investigated this in a binocular-disparity discrimination task. Using psychophysical reverse-correlation, also known as image classification, we identified the perceptual strategies of two macaques (Macaca mulatta). Correlations between reported disparity signs and disparity noise samples for each trial yielded detection 'filters'. Filter amplitude was greater at near disparities than at far disparities, indicating that the subjects relied more on near disparities. Recordings from both macaques' disparity-selective V2 neurons showed a correlation between neuronal responses and perceptual judgment in near-preferring, but not far-preferring, units, mirroring the psychophysically measured strategy. After one monkey learned to weight near and far disparities equally, activity in its far-preferring neurons correlated with choice. Thus, the pattern of correlations between neuronal activity and perceptual reports indicates how subjects use their neuronal signals."

It moves processively by 36-nm steps that require at least one of the two heads to be tightly bound to actin throughout the catalytic cycle. To elucidate the kinetic mechanism of processivity, we measured the rate of product release from the double-headed myosin V-HMM using a new ATP analogue, 3′-(7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carbonylamino)-3′-deoxy-ATP (deac-aminoATP), which undergoes a 20-fold increase in fluorescence emission intensity when bound to the active site of myosin V (Forgacs, E., Cartwright, S., Kovács, M., Sakamoto, T., Sellers, J. R., Corrie, J. E. T., Webb, M. R., and White, H. D. (2006) Biochemistry 45, 13035–13045). The kinetics of ADP and deac-aminoADP dissociation from actomyosin V-HMM, following the power stroke, were determined using double-mixing stopped-flow fluorescence. These used either deac-aminoATP as the substrate with ADP or ATP chase or alternatively ATP as the substrate with either a deac-aminoADP or deac-aminoATP chase. Both sets of experiments show that the observed rate of ADP or deac-aminoADP dissociation from the trail head of actomyosin V-HMM is the same as from actomyosin V-S1. The dissociation of ADP from the lead head is decreased by up to 250-fold. Myosin V is a cellular motor protein, which transports cargos along actin filaments.

The dissociation of ADP from the lead head is decreased by up to 250-fold. Myosin V is an unconventional myosin that transports organelles such as vesicles in neurons and melanosomes in melanocytes along actin tracks (1Wu X.F. Bowers B. Wei Q. Kocher B. Hammer J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 847-859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To do this, myosin V has evolved the ability to move processively on actin for several μm, requiring many ATP hydrolysis cycles (2Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M. Spudich J.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The processivity is at least partially explained by a kinetic mechanism in which the slow rate of ADP dissociation is the rate-limiting step of ATP hydrolysis (3De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27448-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the myosin II mechanism, in which ADP dissociation is much faster and dissociation of actin from myosin occurs with each cycle of ATP hydrolysis. As a result, myosin V has a much higher duty cycle, and even single headed myosin V is in the strongly bound actomyosin-ADP state 80–90% of the time during steady-state hydrolysis (3De La Cruz E.M.

It has also been suggested that additional mechanisms promoting processivity may involve gating of product release (5Veigel C. Wang F. Bartoo M.L. Sellers J.A. Molloy J.E. Nat.

In these single-mixing stopped-flow experiments, the rates of mdADP dissociation were measured by mixing myosin-mdADP complexes with actin in the presence of either a large excess of ATP or ADP that can act as a chase reagent, binding to nucleotide-free sites as they form. An alternative approach to measure the post-power stroke dissociation of ADP resulting from a single turnover of ATP hydrolysis is to use double-mixing stopped-flow measurements. In these experiments, the myosin is first mixed with ATP (or fluorescent analogues), incubated for a few seconds to allow the ATP to bind to the myosin and be hydrolyzed, and then mixed with actin. A power stroke is associated with Pi dissociation from actomyosin-ADP-Pi but is not produced by either apomyosin or myosin-ADP binding to actin (13Steffen W. Smith D. Sleep J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6434-6439Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, double-mixing experiments are required to determine the kinetics of product dissociation following a power stroke. Double mixing experiments have previously only been done in the presence of an ATP chase (7Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the ATP chase rapidly binds to the trail head and dissociates it from actin. Thus, the kinetics of mdADP release from the lead head, while the molecule remains under the strain produced by a power stroke, was not determined. An additional complication of using mdATP as the fluorescent substrate in these experiments is that ∼70% of the fluorescence signal is associated with phosphate dissociation, and only ∼30% is associated with the dissociation of mdADP from actomyosin V-mdADP-Pi (7Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although the rate of Pi dissociation is at least 10-fold more rapid than mdADP dissociation from actomyosin V, the relatively small amplitude associated with mdADP release and the temporal overlap between the two processes complicate the kinetic analysis. We made an initial study of product dissociation by double-mixing experiments using mdATP as a substrate with an ADP chase but did not observe a significant difference between the kinetics of product dissociation from actomyosin V-HMM-mdADP-Pi and actomyosin V-S1-mdADP-Pi (15White H.D.

We therefore utilized the fluorescent ATP analogue, deac-aminoATP, to study the kinetics of the nucleoside diphosphate dissociation steps. A ∼20-fold fluorescence increase is observed when deac-aminoATP binds to myosin V-S1, and >95% of the fluorescence change upon product dissociation is associated with deac-aminoADP dissociation from actomyosin V-S1 (16Forgacs E.

Based on these studies, we carried out a series of double-mixing stopped-flow experiments to measure ADP and deac-aminoADP dissociation from the double-headed complexes of actomyosin V-HMM-deac-aminoADP-Pi and actomyosin V-HMM-ADP-Pi.

The concentration of myosin V-HMM active sites was determined from A280 – 1.5A320 (A320 was subtracted to correct for light scattering) and ϵμM = 0.123 cm–1, calculated from the number of tyrosine and tryptophan residues and their subunit molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm: ϵM = (n = 10)Trp × 5690 + (n = 52)Tyr × 1280 (18Gill S. von Hippel P. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). All preparations were analyzed by SDS protein gel electrophoresis and by active site titration with deac-aminoATP. Myosin V-HMM and myosin V-S1 were stored on ice in buffer containing 10 mm MOPS, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 400 mm KCl, pH 7.5, and used within 72 h. Reagents—Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle (19Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP and ADP were purchased from Sigma. N-Methylanthraniloyl derivatives of 2′-deoxyADP (mdADP) and ATP (mdATP) were synthesized and purified according to the method of Hiratsuka (20Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Deac-aminoATP and deac-amino-ADP were synthesized by the method of Webb et al. (21Webb M.R. Reid G.P. Munasinghe V.R.N. Corrie J.E.T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14463-14471Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Deacaminonucleotide concentrations were based upon molar extinction coefficients of the deac-aminoATP and deac-amino-ADP, ϵ429 = 46,800 m–1 cm–1. Stopped-flow Experiments—All stopped-flow measurements were done at 20 °C using an SF-2001 stopped-flow apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) fitted with two 2-ml and one 5-ml syringe. The excitation light from a 75-watt xenon lamp was selected by using a 0.125-m monochromator (PTI, South Brunswick, NJ). Deac-aminoATP and deac-aminoADP were excited at 430 nm, and the emitted light was selected using a 450-nm long pass filter. In mdATP experiments, excitation was at 360 nm, and emission was selected using a 400-nm-long pass filter. Stocks of myosin V-HMM and myosin V-S1 were diluted from buffer containing 400 mm KCl to obtain the desired protein concentration and a final KCl concentration of 112 mm just prior to use. Myosin V was mixed with ATP or deac-aminoATP in buffer containing no KCl, incubated for the required time, and then mixed with actin containing the desired nucleotide chase (also in buffer with no KCl). The final concentration of buffer in the flow cell was 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, and 1 mm EGTA. Actin filaments were stabilized with equimolar phalloidin. Actin (80 μm) was treated for 1 h with either 0.01 unit of apyrase for experiments used without a chase to hydrolyze traces of ADP or ATP. Stock solutions of actin (80 μm) and ADP (2 mm) were treated for 1 h at 20 °C with 1 mm glucose and 0.01 unit/ml hexokinase to remove traces of ATP in experiments where the actin contained an ADP chase. TIRF Assay—The TIRF assay was performed as described previously (22Sakamoto T. Wang F. Schmitz S. Xu Y.H. Xu Q. Molloy J.E. Veigel C. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29201-29207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Data Analysis and Kinetic Simulation—Three to four data traces of 500 points were averaged, and the observed rate constants were obtained by fitting the data to one, two, or three exponential terms using the software package included with the Kintek stopped-flow instrument and using nonlinear least squares routines in the Scientist package (23Eccleston J.F. Hutchinson J.P. White H.D. Harding S.E. Chowdhry B.Z. Protein-Ligand Interactions: Structure and Spectroscopy. Oxford University Press, Oxford2001: 201-237Google Scholar). In all cases, the amplitudes and rate constants obtained using the two software packages agreed to within 1–2%. Fitting data to two or more exponential terms is robust and will determine a unique set of rate and amplitude terms if the rate constants differ by a factor of more than 5-fold. The smallest difference between the rate constants was in Fig. 1, where there was a 7-fold difference between the two fastest terms. The time dependence of the fluorescence was collected and fit versus log time because of the large range over which changes in fluorescence were observed and because it allows much better scrutiny of the quality of the fit than with linear plots that are customarily used. A log time base is also preferable for multiexponential fits, because the same weighting is given to each of the exponential terms, whereas the fitting with a linear time base gives heavier weighting to the slower processes. Initial Studies of the Rates of Product Dissociation from Actomyosin V-HMM-mdADP-Pi—In our initial studies, we used mdATP to determine the kinetics of product dissociation from the actomyosin V-HMM-mdADP-Pi complex (Fig. 1). Myosin V-HMM was first mixed with mdATP and then actin containing either no chase or an ATP or ADP chase in single-turnover double-mixing stopped-flow experiments. The data were not normalized but have been displaced vertically so that they do not overlap each other. Although the total amplitudes were the same within experimental error, the fit amplitudes were normalized to a total of 1.0 to make comparison easier. For all three experiments, there was a fast and large (65–70% of total amplitude) fluorescence decrease at a rate of ∼75 s–1, kobs1, which is similar to the rate of Pi dissociation (7Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and a smaller amplitude (25–30%) fluorescence decrease at ∼10 s–1 (kobs2), assigned to mdADP dissociation. When an ADP chase (or no chase) was used, a third small amplitude phase was also observed (5–6%) with a rate constant of ∼0.03 s–1 (kobs3). With an ATP chase, the rates and amplitudes on the two fast phases were similar to those observed with no chase or with an ADP chase, but the amplitude of the slowest component, 0.03 s–1, was less than 1%, and the data were fit equally well by two exponential terms. However, because the amplitude of the slowest component (kobs3) with no nucleotide chase or with an ADP chase was significantly (3–4-fold) lower than that of kobs2, we were not certain of its significance. Based on our observations and those of Rosenfeld and Sweeney (7Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), it became apparent that mdATP is not the ideal substrate with which to study the kinetics of ADP dissociation from actomyosin V-ADP-Pi, as discussed in the Introduction. We therefore decided to utilize deac-amino-ATP for this work, because it has several features that make it preferable to mdATP for these studies (16Forgacs E. Cartwright S. Kovács M. Sakamoto T. Sellers J.R. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. White H.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13035-13045Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 1) Deac-amino nucleotides have a much larger increase in fluorescence emission (∼20-fold upon binding to myosin V), which provides a much better signal/noise ratio than mdATP and a useable signal with as little as 10 nm nucleotide in the final reaction mix. This also allows deac-amino nucleotides to be used in chase experiments at ratios as high as 100 times the active site concentration with a good signal to noise ratio. 2) Single turnover experiments of myosin V-S1 with deac-aminoATP indicated that >95% of the fluorescence enhancement remains after dissociation of Pi from the active site of myosin V, and, therefore, the fluorescence change is specific for deac-aminoADP dissociation (7Rosenfeld S.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40100-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Deac-aminoATP Binding to Myosin V-HMM (Active Site Titration)—We have conducted single-turnover stopped-flow active-site titrations of myosin V-HMM similar to those previously reported for myosin V-S1 (16Forgacs E. Cartwright S. Kovács M. Sakamoto T. Sellers J.R. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. White H.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13035-13045Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to determine the kinetics of myosin V hydrolysis of deac-aminoATP and active site concentrations of the myosin V-HMM (data not shown). The active site concentration determined in this manner for myosin V-HMM was 95–100% of that determined from A280 using the calculated extinction coefficient of myosin V-HMM. It is important that a high percentage of the protein be catalytically active when measuring properties of a dimeric protein, because one inactive head will influence the function of the whole molecule (24Cremo C.R. Wang F. Facemyer K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41465-41472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The observed rate constants for deac-aminoATP binding, steady state hydrolysis, and deac-aminoADP affinity to myosin V-HMM are similar to those previously measured with myosin V-S1, which provides evidence that the two heads of myosin V-HMM function independently in the absence of actin (Table 1).TABLE 1Rate constants of deac-aminoATP binding and hydrolysis by myosin V-HMM and myosin V-S1 determined from single turnover experimentskTkss1/KDμm—1 s—1s—1μmHMM3.5 ± 0.030.027 ± 0.030.07 ± 0.02S13.4 ± 0.030.025 ± 0.020.09 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab Kinetics of Product Dissociation from Actomyosin V-HMM-deac-aminoADP-Pi—We have carried out double mixing stopped-flow experiments to determine the rates of product dissociation utilizing deac-aminoATP as the substrate (Fig. 2). Equimolar amounts of myosin V-HMM and deac-aminoATP were mixed and aged in a delay line for 20 s. The solution was then mixed either with actin alone (treated with apyrase to ensure that there was no free nucleotide present) or with actin plus an ADP or ATP chase. When an ADP chase was used, we observed two distinct phases with rate constants of 0.46 s–1 for the faster and 0.015 s–1 for the slower phase (Fig. 2A). There was no actin dependence of either the slow or fast rates (Fig. 2B), as would be expected based on the rapid (2 × 107m–1 s–1) second-order rate constant of myosin V-S1-deac-amino-ADP-Pi binding to actin (16Forgacs E. Cartwright S. Kovács M. Sakamoto T. Sellers J.R. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. White H.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13035-13045Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and slow and fast phases were fit to maximum rates of 0.48 ± 0.01 and 0.015 ± 0.002 s–1. The amplitudes associated with the slow phase in Figs. 2A and 3A are 40–45% of the total amplitude, which is close to the 50% expected for nucleotide dissociation from one of the two heads. Moreover, the slow phase is eliminated by the presence of calcium (data not shown), which has been shown to dissociate one or more of the calmodulin light chains from the myosin V lever arm and would be expected to interfere with the transmission of strain between the two heads.FIGURE 3Kinetics of product dissociation from actomyosin V-HMM-ADP-Pi.A, 0.5 μm myosin V-HMM was mixed with 1.5 μm ATP, aged for 20 s, and then mixed with 20 μm actin and 40 μm deac-aminoADP.

In contrast to experiments with an ADP chase, the rate of deac-aminoADP dissociation measured in a double-mixing experiment with an ATP chase is fit well with a slower single rate constant of 0.37 s–1 (Fig. 2D). Modeling a mechanism of two consecutive reactions at 0.48 s–1 predicts a fluorescence signal that is very close to a single exponential with a rate constant that is 0.65 times that of the individual molecular rate constants, ∼0.32 s–1, which is in reasonably good agreement with the observed rate of 0.37 s–1. In the absence of a chase (apyrase-treated actin), the kinetics of deac-aminoADP dissociation from actomyosin V-HMM-deac-aminoADP-Pi are fit by two rate constants of 0.58 and 0.0068 s–1 (Fig. 2E). The apparently more rapid rate of the fast component and its smaller amplitude are expected because, in the absence of a chase, the deac-aminoADP does not completely dissociate from the active site. The final deac-aminoADP concentration, 0.07 μm, is similar to the dissociation constant of deac-aminoADP from actomyosin V-S1, 0.09 μm. The observed rate of dissociation is the sum of the forward and reverse rates of deac-aminoADP binding. The rate of the slow component is reduced by a factor of 2 in the absence of a chase. This is a measure of the effect of ADP bound to one head upon the rate of deac-amino-ADP dissociation from the second head. Additional evidence for this interpretation is provided by experiments in which the concentration of deac-aminoATP in the first mix was reduced to 0.25 of the active site concentration. Under these conditions, it would be expected that if binding of substrate to the heads is statistically random, 37% of the molecules would have products bound to a single head, and 6% would have products bound to both heads. Myosin V-S1 binds to actin at 10 times the rate of either myosin V-S1-ADP or myosin V-S1-ADP-Pi (3De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), so it would be expected that myosin V-HMM with products bound to a single head would first bind by the rigor head and that the observed rate of product dissociation from the lead head would predominantly be from molecules in which no nucleotide was bound to the trail head. The fluorescence signal would be the result of product dissociation from the lead head. The observed rates of deac-aminoADP dissociation were fit by a single exponential of 0.006 s–1 (Fig. 2F). Dissociation of ADP from the Actomyosin V-HMM-ADP-Pi Complex—The rapid and tight binding of deac-aminonucleotides, together with the 20-fold increase in fluorescence when bound to myosin V, make them ideal for chase experiments to determine the kinetics of ADP and Pi dissociation from actomyosin-ADP-Pi (16Forgacs E. Cartwright S. Kovács M. Sakamoto T. Sellers J.R. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. White H.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13035-13045Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the kinetics of dissociation of the native product, ADP, are measured, and the modified nucleotides are only used as chases to provide a fluorescent signal. We have carried out double-mixing stopped-flow experiments using similar conditions as in Fig. 2, except that ATP was used as a substrate and 22 μm deac-aminoADP or deac-aminoATP were used as chases in the presence of actin. Biphasic kinetics with fast (8.3 s–1) and slow (0.041 s–1) phases were observed with a deac-aminoADP chase (Fig. 3A). The rate reached a maximum above 5 μm actin with fits of 8.9 ± 0.3 and 0.035 ± 0.005 s–1 over the range of actin concentrations (Fig. 3B). By contrast, the dissociation kinetics were >85% single exponential when myosin V-S1 was first mixed with ATP and followed by actin plus either a deac-aminoADP (Fig. 3C) or deac-aminoATP chase (not shown). The rate constant was 8.7 s–1, similar to the fast phase observed in Fig. 3A. If myosin V-HMM was first mixed with ATP followed by mixing with actin plus a deac-aminoATP chase, the observed kinetics of ADP dissociation (measured by deac-amino-ADP binding) was >95% monophasic with a rate constant of 5.0 s–1 (Fig. 3D). The interpretation of these results is similar to the interpretation of those with deac-aminoATP as a substrate. For a deac-amino-ADP chase with myosin V-HMM, the rapid rate of 8.9 s–1 is a measure of ADP dissociation from the first head, which occurs at the same rate as from actomyosin V-S1-ADP-Pi. Following the power stroke, the rate of dissociation of ADP from the second head is ∼250-fold slower, 0.035 s–1. With a deac-aminoATP chase, the observed rate of 4.9 s–1 is that expected from two sequential reactions, which were each 8.9 s–1. Although the rate of the fast phase of diphosphate dissociation is 18-fold slower for deac-aminoADP (0.48 s–1) than for ADP (8.9 s–1), the rate of the slow phase of deac-aminoADP dissociation from the second head is only ∼2-fold slower (0.015 s–1) relati"

Primary data analysis was done using Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0. Data derived from Affymetrix analysis were input into GeneSpring (Agilent Technologies) for further analysis. The expression levels of each probe set across all time points for each group were normalized to time 0. Analysis was conducted with probe sets to compare ER-MyoD WT samples and ER-MyoD RRR samples with MyoD-none (control, MEFs transduced with empty vector) samples at each time point (6, 12, and 24 h), respectively. This analysis involves two steps. First, probe sets were required to be induced at least 2-fold more than MyoD-none samples. Second, the resulting probe sets were subjected to Student's t tests to retain probe sets that survive a p value of <0.05, corrected with the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (0.05). Using these statistics, it is expected that no more than 5% of the genes identified as MyoD targets and as differentially affected by ER-MyoD WT versus ER-MyoD RRR represent false positives. In the microarray experiments, the ratios of the ER-MyoD WT versus ER-MyoD RRR transcripts were 1:1 at 6 h, 1.2:1 at 12 h, and 1.3:1 at 24 h. These differences were taken into consideration, and the values observed for the transcripts at different time points were corrected (divided) by the ER-MyoD WT/ER-MyoD RRR ratio observed at the corresponding time point). Antibodies—Antibodies used for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were as follows: anti-MyoD (clone 5.8, Novocastra Laboratories Ltd.), anti-MyoD (M-318; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-myogenin (M-225; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), tubulin E7, and anti-myosin heavy chain (MHC) (MF20) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). Protein Half-life—ER-MyoD WT- and ER-MyoD RRR-transduced MEFs were treated with β-estradiol for 12 h in differentiation medium and then incubated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) for 0, 1, and 2 h, respectively. Cells were lysed, and the extracts were immunoblotted with MyoD and tubulin antibodies. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Quantitative real time PCR was performed using the Mx3000P system (Stratagene) with a SyberGreen MasterMix (Applied Biosystems). Each data point was obtained from at least three independent experiments. Transcripts for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used as a reference. To ensure specific PCR amplification, every real time PCR run was followed by a dissociation phase analysis (denaturation curve). Specific primer sequences are reported in the supplemental materials. The amplicons corresponding to myogenin, mef2A, Ckm, and Tnnt2 were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, isolated, and sequenced to confirm their identity. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP was performed as described in Ref. 16Caretti G. Schiltz R.L. Dilworth F.J. Di Padova M. Zhao P. Ogryzko V. Fuller-Pace F.V. Hoffman E.P. Tapscott S.J. Sartorelli V. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 547-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 2 μg of normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), MyoD (sc-760X), or RNA polymerase II (sc-9001X) antibodies or 1 μg of acetylated histone H3 antibody (06-599; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified by quantitative real time PCR using specific oligonucleotides reported in the supplemental materials. The reported data represent real time PCR values normalized to input DNAs and to the values obtained with normal rabbit IgG, which were set as one unit in each calculation. Data are presented as -fold differences relative to input and values obtained by normal rabbit IgG with the formula, 2((CtIgG-Ct input)-(CtAb-Ct input)), where Ct represents threshold cycles, IgG is normal rabbit IgG, Ab is specific antibody, and input is input genomic DNA. To ensure specific PCR amplification, every real time PCR run was followed by a dissociation phase analysis (denaturation curve), which indicated the presence of a single dissociation peak. Real time PCR was performed at least three times with DNA samples obtained from three independent ChIP experiments. In selected experiments, the PCR-amplified immunoprecipitated DNAs were sequenced and confirmed to correspond to the expected target loci. The quantitative study of temporal activation of gene expression occurring during skeletal myogenesis requires synchronization of the process. Cultures of either established (i.e. C2C12 cells) or primary skeletal muscle cells undergo differentiation in an asynchronous manner. Moreover, a significant proportion of the cells, “reserve cells,” escape terminal differentiation (18Yoshida N. Yoshida S. Koishi K. Masuda K. Nabeshima Y. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 769-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To overcome this limitation, we have employed a cellular system in which uniform and synchronized nuclear translocation and activation of a protein composed by the hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor fused to MyoD (ER-MyoD) is obtained by adding β-estradiol to the culture medium. Although we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the addition of estradiol may influence some aspects of gene expression, this system has been extensively employed and convincingly shown to recapitulate, with a good approximation, the transcriptional and chromatin-binding behavior of MyoD in skeletal muscle cells, including regulated temporal activation of muscle gene transcription (12Ishibashi J.

Nonacetylatable MyoD Is Defective in Conferring the Skeletal Muscle Phenotype to MEFs Derived from MyoD-/-/Myf5-/- Animals—MEFs obtained from MyoD-/-/Myf5-/- animals (12Ishibashi J. Perry R.L. Asakura A. Rudnicki M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) were transduced with retroviruses expressing either ER-MyoD WT or ER-MyoD bearing three substitutions (lysine to arginine) at amino acid residues 99, 102, and 104 that render it no longer acetylatable (ER-MyoD RRR) (6Sartorelli V.

A retrovirus without the ER-MyoD insert was also employed as negative control. Disruption of both the MyoD and Myf5 loci in the transduced MEFs eliminates the potentially confounding effects due to the autoregulatory and redundant activities of the endogenous genes (14Bergstrom D.A. Penn B.H. Strand A. Perry R.L. Rudnicki M.A. Tapscott S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 587-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). MEFs transduced with either ER-MyoD WT or ER-MyoD RRR retroviruses were cultured in a medium that favors differentiation (DM) supplemented with β-estradiol for 0, 6, 12, 24, and 36 h. The addition of β-estradiol to the culture medium caused nuclear translocation of ER-MyoD WT and ER-MyoD RRR with analogous efficiencies and kinetics (Fig. 1, A and B). Since acetylation influences protein stability (24Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 25Brooks C.L. Gu W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether ER-MyoD WT and ER-MyoD RRR proteins had a similar half-life and accumulated to comparable levels. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 1, C and D, and indicate that both ER-MyoD WT and ER-MyoD RRR proteins have a comparable half-life and accumulate to similar levels. The differentiation process of MEFs transduced with ER-MyoD RRR was impaired, as indicated by a delayed and reduced expression of myogenin and myogenic conversion (Fig. 2, A–D). Moreover, transcription driven by either a naturally occurring muscle regulatory region, the muscle creatine kinase enhancer (Ckm-luc), or an artificial construct bearing four multimerized MyoD binding sites (4RE-luc) was impaired in ER-MyoD RRR cells, whereas expression of the control cytomegalovirus-luc reporter was not influenced by either ER-MyoD WT or ER-MyoD RRR (Fig. 2E). Expression of exogenous ER-MyoD WT and ER-MyoD RRR was within physiological range, since the levels of ER-MyoD WT and ER-MyoD RRR in MEFs approximated that of endogenous MyoD found in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells (Fig. 2, F and G). Previous experiments conducted with a vector expressing MyoD RRR without the ER moiety in C3H10T1/2 mouse embryonic fibroblasts were consistent with the results reported here (impaired muscle-specific transcription and muscle conversion) (6Sartorelli V.

Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), indicating that the effects observed with the ER-MyoD RRR retroviral construct are not due to a peculiar activity of the ER-MyoD RRR fusion protein or the specific genetic make-up of the MyoD-/-/Myf5-/- MEFs.FIGURE 2Non-acetylatable MyoD fails to induce proper muscle gene expression and myogenic conversion of MyoD-/-/Myf5-/- MEFs.

A comprehensive annotation of the transcripts identified by genome-wide expression profiling has been deposited in the GEO data base (available on the World Wide Web). The accession numbers for the individual experiments are provided under “Microarray Data Information Access” in the supplemental materials. Expression profiling of ER-MyoD WT cells at 0 h of β-estradiol induction did not differ from that of cells transduced with the control retrovirus. After 6 h of β-estradiol treatment, ER-MyoD WT induced 768 of the 44,224 interrogated transcripts (1.7%). At 12 and 24 h, the transcripts induced by ER-MyoD WT were 785 of 44,189 (1.7%) and 1,092 of 43,754 interrogated transcripts (2.5%), respectively (Fig. 3A). Table 1 shows a list of representative genes induced by ER-MyoD WT. Gene activation induced by ER-MyoD WT at different time points was calculated as -fold change over the values observed for ER-MyoD WT at 0 h of β-estradiol treatment. Among others, transcription of genes, such as those for retinoblastoma 1 (Rb1), cadherin 15 (Cdh15), transcription factor zinc finger 238 (Zfp238), neural pentraxin1 (Nptx1), and wingless-type MMTV integration site 9A (Wnt9A), was robustly induced as early as 6 h after β-estradiol treatment. Transcription of myogenin, already detectable at 6 h, continued to increase at 12 and 24 h and was accompanied by the appearance of the transcripts corresponding to actins (α-cardiac and α-skeletal actins), troponins (Tnnt1, Tncc, Tnnt2, Tnnc2, and Tnnt3), myosins (Myo5b and Mylpf), titin, and muscle creatine kinase (Ckm). A similar gene activation kinetics was observed in both the C2C12 skeletal muscle cell line (26Delgado I. Huang X. Jones S. Zhang L. Hatcher R. Gao B. Zhang P.

Development. 1991; 113: 1017-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the MEF ER-MyoD model retains temporal characteristics of physiological muscle gene expression. Interestingly, transcription of the early induced genes Nptx1 and cardiac lineage protein 1 (Clp1) diminished over time, and, as reported (14Bergstrom D.A. Penn B.H. Strand A. Perry R.L. Rudnicki M.A. Tapscott S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 587-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), MyoD repressed transcription of the follistatin-like 1 (Fstl1) and syndecan 2 (Sdc2) genes (Table 1). We then compared the percentage of genes differentially activated by ER-MyoD WT and ER-MyoD RRR. Only transcripts that passed two criteria for statistical significance (p value <0.05 and false discovery rate of 0.05) were considered. A gene was considered not properly induced by ER-MyoD RRR if the average expression of multiple replicates was one-half or less the average induced by ER-MyoD WT in at least one of the time points analyzed. Of the 768 genes induced by ER-MyoD WT at 6 h, 232 (30%) genes were also fully activated by ER-MyoD RRR. At 12 and 24 h, ER-MyoD RRR fully activated 48% (380 of 785) and 51% (563 of 1,092) of the genes activated by ER-MyoD WT, respectively (Fig. 3B). Therefore, ER-MyoD RRR failed to fully activate 70% (at 6 h), 52% (at 12 h), and 49% (at 24 h) of the genes induced by ER-MyoD WT. The data illustrated in the Venn diagram in Fig. 3B indicate that the genes fully activated by ER-MyoD RRR are a subset of those activated by ER-MyoD WT. Moreover, our microarray analysis has not detected genes whose expression was reliably induced more by ER-MyoD RRR than by ER-MyoD WT (data not shown). The lists of the genes activated by either ER-MyoD WT or ER-MyoD RRR, respectively, at 6, 12, and 24 h are reported in the supplemental materials (Tables S1–S6). The abilities of ER-MyoD WT and ER-MyoD RRR to activate gene transcription of a representative list of genes were compared and expressed as the ratio of the values observed for ER-MyoD over those observed for ER-MyoD RRR (ER-MyoD WT/ER-MyoD RRR) (Table 2). With the false discovery rate set to 0.05, it is expected that no more than 5% of the transcripts identified as differentially affected by ER-MyoD WT versus ER-MyoD RRR may be false positive. Therefore, we further evaluated the expression of some of the transcripts identified as differentially regulated (Table 2) by RT-qPCR using independent triplicate sets of RNA, different from those employed for the profiling analysis (Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7). We found that, for the transcripts analyzed, there was good agreement between the RT-qPCR and the microarray results. After 6 h of β-estradiol induction, ER-MyoD RRR was defective in activating transcription of several genes, including Rb1, Cdh15, myogenin, Mef2A, Zfp238, Actc1, Tnnt2, growth arrest, and DNA damage-inducible 45 α (Gadd45a), Bcl-6, and Hes 6, although differences were noted for individual genes (Table 2 and Fig. 4). After 12 h of β-estradiol induction, myogenin remained comparatively lower in ER-MyoD RRR cells (Table 2 and Fig. 5). Consistent with a role of myogenin in activating genes expressed in differentiated cells, transcripts for Tncc, Tnnt1, Tnnt2, and Actc1 were also lower in ER-MyoD RRR cells (Table 2 and Fig. 5). By this time, expression of Mef2A, Zfp238, and Bcl6 in ER-MyoD RRR became comparable with that in ER-MyoD WT cells. Myogenin expression never recovered in ER-MyoD RRR cells (Table 2 and Figs. 2 and 6), and the transcripts for Ckm, α-skeletal actin, Actc1, Tnnt1, Tncc, Tnnc2, Tnnt3, Myo5b and Mylpf, titin, Asb2, and septin 4 also remained lower in ER-MyoD RRR cells (Table 2 and Fig. 6). Beside activating transcription, MyoD also represses expression of selected genes (14Bergstrom D.A. Penn B.H. Strand A. Perry R.L. Rudnicki M.A. Tapscott S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 587-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In the case of Fstl1 and utrophin, MyoD represses gene expression by inducing transcription of miR-206, which targets sequences in the 3′-untranslated region of Flstl1 and utrophin mRNAs (30Rosenberg M.I. Georges S.A. Asawachaicharn A. Analau E. Tapscott S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The transcripts for Flstl1 and Sdc2 were reduced in β-estradiol-induced ER-MyoD WT cells when compared with noninduced conditions (Table 1). Such reduction was less pronounced in ER-MyoD RRR (Table 2), indicating that ER-MyoD RRR is less effective in either activating transcription of a repressor, such as miR206 in the case of Fstl1, or promoting repression of Sdc2. Finally, transcription of some genes was equally induced by either ER-MyoD WT or ER-MyoD RRR (Table 2; neural pentraxin1; cardiac lineage protein1; Wnt9a; Gadd45γ). Overall, the results described in this paragraph indicate that MyoD acetylation affects the kinetics and strength of transcription of discrete subsets of genes.TABLE 1Representative list of genes activated by MyoD MyoD WT-FC indicates average -fold change at 6, 12, and 24 h of MyoD activation with β-estradiol relative to noninduced MyoD (MyoD WT at 0 h of β-estradiol treatment set to 1). –, either the transcript was not detected, or the values did not meet statistical criteria.UniGeneName and function6 h MyoD WT-FC12 h MyoD WT-FC24 h MyoD WT-FC-fold-fold-foldStructural-cytoskeleton Mm.214950Actin, α1, skeletal muscle (Acta1)––8.5 Mm.686Actin, α, cardiac (Actc1)3.31279 Mm.258670Troponin T1, skele"
https://openalex.org/W1966415698,"Desensitization of seven transmembrane receptors (7TMRs), which are modulated by the beta-arrestins, leads to altered G protein activation. The A1 adenosine receptor (A1AR) is an antiinflammatory 7TMR exhibiting reduced expression and activity in both multiple sclerosis (MS) and the murine MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in monocytoid cells. Herein, we report that beta-arrestin-1 expression was increased in brains of MS patients relative to non-MS brains, whereas A1AR expression was concomitantly reduced. This inverse relationship between beta-arrestin-1 and A1AR was confirmed in cultured monocytoid cells as beta-arrestin-1 overexpression resulted in a down-regulation of A1AR together with the internalization of the surface receptor. Moreover, a physical interaction between beta-arrestin-1 and A1AR was demonstrated in monocytoid cells. Proinflammatory cytokines regulated the A1AR/beta-arrestin-1 interactions, while A1AR activation also modulated proinflammatory cytokines expression. During EAE, beta-arrestin-1 and A1AR expression in the spinal cord displayed a similar pattern compared to that observed in MS brains. EAE-induced neuroinflammation and neurobehavioral deficits were suppressed by glucocorticoid treatments, accompanied by concurrent reduced beta-arrestin-1 and enhanced A1AR expression. Thus, the interplay between beta-arrestin-1 and A1AR in the central nervous system during neuroinflammation represents a reciprocal regulatory mechanism through which neuroprotective therapeutic strategies for neuroinflammatory diseases might be further developed."
https://openalex.org/W2093930603,"Integrin plays an essential role in the formation of cell-matrix junctions and is also involved in the fundamental cellular functions. In the process of the formation of cell-cell junctions, an immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecule nectin initially trans-interacts together and promotes the formation of adherens junctions (AJs) cooperatively with another cell-cell adhesion molecule cadherin. The activation of integrin αvβ3 is critically necessary for this nectin-induced formation of AJs. However, after the establishment of AJs, integrin αvβ3 becomes inactive and retains the association with nectin at AJs. The molecular mechanism of this dynamic regulation of integrin αvβ3 during the formation of AJs remains unclear. We found here that the expression of phosphatidylinositol-phosphate kinase type Iγ90 (PIPKIγ90), which is involved in the regulation of integrin activation, in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, preferentially reversed the inactivation of integrin αvβ3 at cell-cell adhesion sites and partially disrupted E-cadherin-based AJs. The activation of PIPKIγ is correlated with its phosphorylation state. The tyrosine phosphatase protein-tyrosine phosphatase μ (PTPμ) effectively dephosphorylated PIPKIγ and thus canceled the PIPKIγ-dependent activation of integrin αvβ3 by blocking the interaction of integrin αvβ3 with talin. Moreover, PTPμ associated with nectin, and its phosphatase activity was enhanced by the trans-interaction of nectin, leading to the decrease in PIPKIγ90 phosphorylation. Therefore, the trans-interaction of nectin essentially functions in the inactivation of integrin at AJs through the PTPμ-induced inactivation of PIPKIγ.

Integrin is a key cell-cell adhesion molecule at cell-matrix junctions and comprises heterodimers with α and β subunits (1Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

It was reported that integrin is essential for the formation of specialized subcellular apparatuses, such as focal complexes and focal adhesions, and for cell movement, proliferation, and differentiation (1Geiger B.

Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Nectin exerts its cell-cell adhesion activity in a Ca2+-independent manner and consists of four members: nectin-1, nectin-2, nectin-3, and nectin-4 (9Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). However, the trans-interaction of Necl-5 with nectin-3 is tentative, and Necl-5 is down-regulated from the cell surface by clathrin-dependent endocytosis (10Fujito T. Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Minami Y. Kajita M. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of Necl-5 impairs the integrin αvβ3- and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-dependent intracellular signaling for cell movement and proliferation, resulting in the reduction of cell movement and proliferation. The phenomenon that moving and proliferating normal cultured cells arrest both movement and proliferation after they grow confluent and form cell-cell junctions has been well known for a long time (11Abercrombie M. Heaysman J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1953; 5: 111-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 12Fisher H.W. Yeh J. Science. 1967; 155: 581-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but its molecular mechanism is poorly understood. The down-regulation of Necl-5 is likely to be at least partly one of the underlying mechanisms of contact inhibition of cell movement and proliferation. On the other hand, nectin-3 dissociated from Necl-5 is retained on the cell surface and subsequently trans-interacts with nectin-1, which most feasibly trans-interacts with nectin-3 among the nectin family members (8Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Itoh S. Shingai T. Takekuni K. Satoh K. Inoue Y. Hamaguchi A. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol.

This trans-interaction of nectins promotes the recruitment of cadherin, a major cell-cell adhesion molecule at AJs, to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites, eventually establishing AJs (9Takai Y.

In this process, the activation of protein kinase C and FAK, downstream molecules of integrin αvβ3, is also required (17Sakamoto Y. Ogita H. Hirota T. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Yasumi M. Inagaki M.

Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, after the establishment of AJs, the high affinity form of integrin αvβ3 is converted into the low affinity form that also continues to associate with nectin (17Sakamoto Y. Ogita H. Hirota T.

Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism by which integrin αvβ3 is inactivated after the formation of AJs remains to be elucidated, this inactivation seems to be beneficial for the maintenance of AJs, because the sustained activation of integrin renders cells highly motile, which tends to disrupt cell-cell junctions. Integrin is activated by binding of talin to the cytoplasmic tail of integrin β subunit (3Calderwood D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), which causes the structural change of the integrin α/β dimer from the bent to the extended conformation. This change allows integrin to gain the higher affinity to the extracellular matrix. The binding of talin to integrin is up-regulated by increasing the amount of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (19Martel V. Racaud-Sultan C. Dupe S. Marie C. Paulhe F. Galmiche A. Block M.R. Albiges-Rizo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21217-21227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), which is generated by phosphatidylinositol-phosphate kinases such as phosphatidylinositol-phosphate kinase type Iγ90 (PIPKIγ90). Integrin that is activated in this way induces the activation of c-Src and FAK, both of which phosphorylate and activate PIPKIγ90 (20Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 21Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylated PIPKIγ90 correlates with an increase in its interaction with talin, and this interaction further stimulates the kinase activity of PIPKIγ90 itself (20Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. Nature. 2002; 420: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 22Di Paolo G. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R. Voronov S. Chang S. Guo J. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Nature. 2002; 420: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). These combined mechanisms result in the enhancement of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate synthesis and thus the further promotion of talin binding to integrin, suggesting the positive feedback loop of integrin activation. Thus, the phosphorylation state of PIPKIγ is important for the regulation of integrin activation. Based on these lines of evidence, we examined in this study how integrin αvβ3 is inactivated after the nectin-induced formation of AJs by exploring the phosphatase that suppresses the phosphorylation of PIPKIγ and whether nectin actually associates with this phosphatase and regulates its phosphatase activity.

The goat anti-nectin-3 pAb was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell Lines and Transfection—MDCK cells, HEK293 cells, and L cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For DNA transfection, Lipofectamine 2000 or Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) was applied following the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described (17Sakamoto Y. Ogita H. Hirota T. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Yasumi M. Inagaki M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19631-19644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were fixed with ice-cold acetone-methanol (1:1) solution for 1 min. After being blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, the cells were immunostained with the indicated first Abs for 1 h, followed by the incubation with fluorophore-labeled secondary Abs for 30 min. The samples were analyzed by LM510 META confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). Immunoprecipitation Assay—MDCK and HEK293 cells expressing various combinations of indicated molecules were lysed with Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and then the supernatant was incubated with the anti-FLAG mAb at 4 °C for 2 h followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling with Laemmli buffer for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar), followed by Western blotting with the indicated Abs. To investigate the association of endogenous PTPμ with nectin-3, MDCK cells cultured on the 0.4-μm pored transwell plate (Corning) were treated with a membrane-impermeable cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the treatment, the cells were lysed with buffer A, and the cell lysates were incubated with the anti-nectin-3 pAb or the control goat IgG, followed by the incubation with protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitated samples were then analyzed by Western blotting. In Vitro Binding of PTPμ and Nectin-3—For the preparation of the purified protein of His-PTPμ-EC, HEK293 cells were transfected with pFLAG-CMV-5-PTPμ-EC. At 48 h after the transfection, the culture supernatant containing soluble His-PTPμ-EC was collected and then was applied to nickel-Sepharose 6 fast flow beads (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm imidazole at pH 8.0). After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer B, bound His-PTPμ-EC was eluted with Buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 500 mm imidazole at pH 8.0). The protein concentration of His-PTPμ-EC was determined with bovine serum albumin as a reference protein on SDS-PAGE. The extracellular region of nectin-3 fused to IgG Fc (Nef-3) was prepared as described (26Honda T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Yasumi M. Shingai T. Fukuhara A. Ozaki-Kuroda K. Irie K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To examine the direct binding of His-PTPμ-EC and Nef-3, His-PTPμ-EC (6 pmol) was immobilized on nickel-Sepharose beads, and Nef-3 (60 pmol) was incubated with these beads or nickel-Sepharose beads alone as a control in 0.3 ml of Buffer B containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer B, the bound proteins were eluted with Buffer C. The eluate was then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting. Bound Nef-3 was determined by the anti-human IgG Fc pAb conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare). Separation of Cytoplasmic and Cytoskeletal Fractions—Triton X-100-soluble (cytoplasmic) and -insoluble (cytoskeletal) fractions were prepared as described previously (27Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Briefly, MDCK cells were lysed with Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm Na3VO4) at 4 °C for 1 h. Triton X-100-insoluble and -soluble extracts were separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The cytoskeletal pellet was washed twice with Triton X-100-free lysis buffer, and the proteins were extracted using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm Na3VO4). Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—The assay for isolation of plasma membrane fraction was performed as described previously (28Yamamoto Y. Mandai K. Okabe N. Hoshino T. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2545-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, the MDCK cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then sonicated in Buffer D (10 mm HEPES-NaOH at pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm NaHCO3) on ice for 15 s six times at 3-min intervals. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was diluted with Buffer D into 5 mg/ml of protein, and 0.2 ml was applied on a 4.8 -ml continuous sucrose density gradient (10-50% sucrose in Buffer D), followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h with a swing rotor (P55ST2; Hitachi). After the centrifugation, fractions of 0.3 ml each were collected. Each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with the anti-E-cadherin and anti-talin mAbs. Assessment for Integrin αvβ3 Activity—MDCK cells cultured on 18-mm coverslips in a 12-well dish were used for the Ca2+ switch assay as described previously (18Ozaki M. Ogita H. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in serum-free DMEM (Normal Ca2+ medium) for 1 h. Next, the cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 5 mm EGTA (low Ca2+ medium) for 3 h. The cells were then incubated in serum-free DMEM (normal Ca2+ medium) for indicated period. To detect the high affinity form of integrin αvβ3, we used His-tagged recombinant WOW-1 Fab as described previously (29Katsumi A. Naoe T. Matsushita T. Kaibuchi K. Schwartz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16546-16549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with His-tagged recombinant WOW-1 Fab for 30 min before the end of the Ca2+ assay. The cells were then washed twice with DMEM and were lysed with Laemmli buffer. The amount of WOW-1 bound to the high affinity form of integrin αvβ3 was detected by Western blotting with the anti-His pAb. Assay for PTPμ Phosphatase Activity—The PTPμ phosphatase activity was assessed using a Universal tyrosine phosphatase assay kit (Takara Bio) as previously described (30Feiken E. van Etten I. Gebbink M.F. Moolenaar W.H. Zondag G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15350-15356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells transiently expressing Myc-nectin-3 or HA-E-cadherin were cultured in confluent and lysed with Lysis buffer attached to this kit and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was precleared by protein G-Sepharose beads, and the precleared supernatant was incubated with the anti-PTPμ mAb at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer E (0.5% Tween 20, 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0) three times, these beads were suspended into PTP buffer attached to this kit, and the samples were subjected to the phosphatase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. A paired Student t test was performed for statistical analysis. Knockdown of PIPKIγ and PTPμ—To knock down PIPKIγ and PTPμ, double-stranded 25-nucleotide RNA duplexes (Stealth™; Invitrogen) for PIPKIγ (duplex 1, 5′-UCUUGUAGGUGGUUUCACCAGAUGC-3′; duplex 2, 5′-UGAACCUGAAGUCCUGGAAGUGGUG-3′; duplex 3, 5′-UUCUGGUUGAGGUUCAUGUAGUAGC-3′) and PTPμ (duplex 1, 5′-AUUAAAUGAAGCUAUGAAUCGCCGG-3′; duplex 2, 5′-UUCACACUAACAUUGGUAUAUGGUG-3′; and duplex 3, 5′-UUCAUAAGCCGGCAUAGACGGUGCU-3′), respectively, were transfected into MDCK cells using Amaxa Nucleofection kit T. The knockdown of each protein was confirmed by Western blotting. Activation of Integrin αvβ3 by PIPKIγ at Cell-Cell Junctions—We previously showed that after the achievement of AJs, integrin αvβ3 becomes inactive and localizes at cell-cell adhesion sites as well as focal adhesions (17Sakamoto Y. Ogita H. Hirota T. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Yasumi M. Inagaki M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19631-19644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Ozaki M. Ogita H. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, integrin αvβ3 was concentrated at the cell-cell adhesion sites and co-localized with E-cadherin in confluent MDCK cells, whereas talin was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and did not co-localize with E-cadherin (Fig. 1A), indicating the different localization of integrin αvβ3 from talin. Because talin is involved in the final step of the activation of integrin by directly binding to the cytoplasmic tail of integrin β3 subunit (31Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), this different localization of integrin αvβ3 from talin represents the accumulation of the low affinity form of integrin αvβ3 at AJs in confluent MDCK cells. However, when GFP-PIPKIγ90 was transfected into MDCK cells, talin as well as GFP-PIPKIγ90 was preferentially targeted to the plasma membrane of the cell-cell adhesion sites where the immunofluorescence signal for integrin αvβ3 was concentrated (Fig. 1B, arrowheads), leading to the notion that PIPKIγ90 induces the reactivation of integrin αvβ3 through talin. Interestingly, E-cadherin-based AJs were partially disrupted, probably because of this reactivation of integrin αvβ3 (Fig. 1B, arrow), which was not observed in GFP-transfected (Fig. 1A) or untransfected MDCK cells. These results indicate the critical role of PIPKIγ in integrin αvβ3 reactivation that causes the instability of AJs. Conversely, the inactivation of PIPKIγ seems to be at least one of the important underlying mechanisms in the inactivation of integrin αvβ3 after the establishment of AJs. We further examined by knockdown of PIPKIγ whether endogenous PIPKIγ is indeed involved in the association of integrin with talin. The expression of PIPKIγ was markedly reduced in MDCK cells using siRNA against PIPKIγ (Fig. 1C). Although integrin β3 and talin clustered well and co-localized at focal adhesions of wild-type MDCK cells, this clustering or co-localization was not observed in PIPKIγ knockdown MDCK cells (Fig. 1D), indicating the necessity of PIPKIγ for the association of integrin with talin even at the endogenous level. Identification of PTPμ as a Phosphatase for PIPKIγ—It was reported that the kinase activity of PIPKIγ90 is enhanced by its tyrosine phosphorylation (20Ling K. Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Bunce M.W.

https://openalex.org/W1663833200,"p63 is a member of the p53 tumor suppressor family that is critical for epithelial differentiation and also has an important role in cancer progression. Currently, the molecular mechanisms governing regulation of p63 function remain largely unclear. This study identifies a unique E3 ubiquitin ligase for p63, SCFβTrCP1. SCFβTrCP1 is able to bind p63γ isoforms, with a higher affinity for the TAp63γ isoform. Strikingly, co-expression of TAp63γ and βTrCP1 leads to the stabilization of TAp63γ. This stabilization of TAp63γ leads to up-regulation of p21 at the mRNA and protein level by increased binding of TAp63γ at the p21 promoter. The up-regulation of p21 causes a subsequent increase in G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Last, SCFβTrCP1 is able to ubiquitylate TAp63γ, and this ubiquitylation, as well as the increased activity of TAp63γ, is ablated with the expression of a ubiquitin-deficient mutant of βTrCP1 (ΔFβTrCP1). Therefore, our study reveals that SCFβTrCP1 is an E3 ligase that activates p63 through ubiquitylation. p63 is a member of the p53 tumor suppressor family that is critical for epithelial differentiation and also has an important role in cancer progression.

This stabilization of TAp63γ leads to up-regulation of p21 at the mRNA and protein level by increased binding of TAp63γ at the p21 promoter. The up-regulation of p21 causes a subsequent increase in G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Last, SCFβTrCP1 is able to ubiquitylate TAp63γ, and this ubiquitylation, as well as the increased activity of TAp63γ, is ablated with the expression of a ubiquitin-deficient mutant of βTrCP1 (ΔFβTrCP1). Therefore, our study reveals that SCFβTrCP1 is an E3 ligase that activates p63 through ubiquitylation. p63 is a member of the p53 tumor suppressor family. The six major isoforms of p63 have several conserved regions common to the p53 family members, such as the transactivation domain (TA), 3The abbreviations used are:TAtransactivation domainE1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin carrier proteinE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFPHAhemagglutininsiRNAsmall interfering RNAIPimmunoprecipitationChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationWBWestern blotRTreverse transcriptionqPCRquantitative PCRMEFmouse embryo fibroblast the DNA binding domain, and the oligomerization domain (1Moll U.M.

The TA isoforms have a full-length TA, whereas the ΔN isoforms do not, and are therefore often considered dominant-negative regulators of the TA isoforms (1Moll U.M. Slade N.

These variants are termed α, β, and γ (1Moll U.M. Slade N. Mol Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 371-386PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D.

Because of its strong transactivation and its role in the stress response, TAp63γ is considered the p63 isoform “most like” p53. transactivation domain ubiquitin-activating enzyme ubiquitin carrier protein ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP hemagglutinin small interfering RNA immunoprecipitation chromatin immunoprecipitation Western blot reverse transcription quantitative PCR mouse embryo fibroblast The biological role of p63 is more complex than that of a classical tumor suppressor. p63 knock-out mice have a severe defect in epithelial stratification and fail to form associated tissues, such as teeth, hair, and mammary glands (2Yang A.

Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). Also, it is debated whether p63 might act as a tumor suppressor or an oncogene (1Moll U.M. Slade N. Mol Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 371-386PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that the ΔNp63 isoforms, when overexpressed, may be tumorigenic, whereas the TA isoforms may play a more important role in tumor suppression (1Moll U.M. Slade N. Mol Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 371-386PubMed Google Scholar). Several papers have suggested a reciprocal relationship between ΔNp63α and TAp63γ, since, under a variety of cellular stimuli, the levels of one are often high when those of the other are low, and vice versa (1Moll U.M. Slade N. Mol Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 371-386PubMed Google Scholar). What is clear is that a tightly controlled balance of p63 isoform levels in the cell is critical to homeostasis. This tight balance is maintained through both direct binding of p53 family member transcription sites and heterodimerization among the p53 family members. Although commanding a unique set of target genes, p63 also shares several target genes with the other p53 family members, such as p21 (6Osada M. Ohba M. Kawahara C. Ishioka C. Kanamaru R. Katoh I.

In a p53-deficient background, TAp63γ may rescue the growth-inhibitory function of p53 by activating some of these common target genes and causing growth arrest in response to various forms of stress (6Osada M. Ohba M. Kawahara C. Ishioka C. Kanamaru R. Katoh I. Ikawa Y. Nimura Y. Nakagawara A. Obinata M. Ikawa S. Nat Med. 1998; 4: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 7Zeng S.X. Dai M.S.

The elucidation of both common and isoform-specific signaling pathways will be critical to our understanding of the role of p63 in development and oncogenesis. In an effort to understand one of the biochemical mechanisms that regulate p63, we searched for a p63-specific regulator that could modulate p63 ubiquitylation and, therefore, its activity. A search of the literature revealed that the inhibitor of IκB kinase α knock-out mouse displayed an epidermal phenotype very similar to that of the p63 knock-out mouse (9Sil A.K. Maeda S. Sano Y. Roop D.R. Karin M. Nature. 2004; 428: 660-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The inhibitor of IκB kinase kinase complex works in conjunction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCFβTrCP1 to degrade the IκB and allow subsequent up-regulation of NFκB (10Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Kumar K.G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). βTrCP1 (β-transducin repeats-containing protein 1, Fwd1, etc.) is one of the many substrate recognition components of the SCF complex (10Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Kumar K.G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Humans have two βTrCP proteins, which act in homo- or heterodimers as part of the SCF complex: βTrCP1 and βTrCP2. When exogenously expressed, βTrCP1 is nuclear, whereas βTrCP2 is cytoplasmic (10Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Kumar K.G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). βTrCP has two major protein motifs: an F-box motif that connects βTrCP to the rest of the SCF complex though its interaction with Skp1 and a WD domain, which binds the many substrates of βTrCP (10Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Kumar K.G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). βTrCP proteins can recognize a canonical DSX2–3S motif, where the Ser residues are usually phosphorylated (10Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Kumar K.G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, several noncanonical sequences and regions have also been found. These regions usually depend on a cluster of highly charged or phosphorylated residues and are found in proteins, such as Emi1 and Cdc25a (10Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Kumar K.G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 11Peters J.M. Mol Cell. 2003; 11: 1420-1421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 12Jin J. Shirogane T. Xu L. Nalepa G. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Wade Harper J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3062-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is very plausible that SCFβTrCP1 may also regulate the p63 pathway. Our study, as described here, tests this idea. We have chosen to focus on the p63γ isoforms, because they are the most potent regulators of transcription and may be important in modulating the activity of the other family members during cell growth. Our data demonstrate that SCFβTrCP1 binds TAp63γ and, to a lesser degree, ΔNp63γ. This interaction takes place at sites on both the N and the C termini of TAp63γ. Further, this binding leads to subsequent stabilization of TAp63γ, leading to increased activation of p21, because of increased binding of TAp63γ to the p21 promoter. In turn, the up-regulation of p21 leads to an increase in G1 phase cells. Further, βTrCP1 is able to ubiquitylate TAp63γ in vitro and in cells, demonstrating that although it regulates the activity of TAp63γ, βTrCP1 also has a dual role as an E3 ligase to TAp63γ. This E3 ligase activity is critical to the increased activation of TAp63γ by βTrCP1, since a βTrCP1 mutant that can bind but not ubiquitylate TAp63γ (ΔFβTrCP1) is unable to mediate this activity. Thus, this study provides insight into a novel ubiquitin-dependent activation mechanism for TAp63γ.

Co-immunoprecipitation—GFP-TAp63γ, GFP-ΔNp63γ, and FLAG-βTrCP1 vectors were co-expressed in HEK293 or H1299 cells, according to protocols above and the figure legends. Clarified whole cell lysate (concentration indicated per figure) was prebound for 2 h using 2 μg of antibody, monoclonal IgG, or polyclonal IgG at 4 °C, and then 30 μl of protein G-agarose bead slurry (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added, and the samples continued to rotate at 4 °C overnight.

Levels were normalized to input and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and then graphed using Microsoft Excel. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using Student's t test. Flow Cytometry—H1299 cells were transfected with vectors as indicated. After 1.5 days, the cells were treated with 150 ng/ml nocodazole to arrest them in G2, fixed, permeabilized, and stained with propidium iodide (PI), as noted previously (7Zeng S.X. Dai M.S.

Data were analyzed using a multicycle software program using a polynomial S-phase algorithm. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—H1299 cells were transfected according to the protocol above. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed for ChIP and processed according to the previous protocol (18Li Y. Zeng S.X. Landais I. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6936-6945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), except that the IP was carried out with 2 μg of ChIP grade Pab4A4 (Abcam) or 2 μg of monoclonal IgG (Sigma). 2 μl of the purification elutant was loaded onto a 96-well plate, and qPCR was performed as noted above using primers against regions of the p21 promoter or gene taken from a previous publication (19Gomes N.P.

In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay—The SCFβTrCP1-mediated in vitro ubiquitylation assay was performed similarly to previous assays (20Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar), with some modifications. The p63 in vitro ubiquitylation assay was carried out in 40 μl of a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm NaF, 3 μm okadaic acid, and the noted concentrations of His-TAp63γ, 10 μl of SCFβTrCP1, 400 ng of UBA-1 (Boston Biochem), 400 ng of UbcH3 (Boston Biochem), 1000 ng of HA-ubiquitin, 5 mm ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 1.5 mm ATPS (Fisher ICN). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h and analyzed afterward by SDS-PAGE followed by WB, as noted above. In Vivo Ubiquitylation Assay—10-cm plates were transfected as noted above. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 (a protease inhibitor) for 6 h. The cells were harvested, and the pellet was split in half. Half underwent standard WB sample preparation (above), and half was prepared using our previous protocol (21Jin Y. Zeng S.X. Lee H. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20035-20043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). βTrCP1 Expression Stabilizes TAp63γ—To determine if βTrCP1 could act as a regulator for TAp63γ, we wished to determine if βTrCP1 would have an effect on the stability of TAp63γ, since βTrCP1 is a well known regulator of protein stability. To answer this question, we used primary MEFs at passage 2 derived from βTrCP1+/– and βTrCP1–/– littermates (13Nakayama K. Hatakeyama S. Maruyama S. Kikuchi A. Onoe K. Good R.A. Nakayama K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8752-8757Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and examined the endogenous levels of TAp63γ mRNA and protein. Strikingly, there was a significantly lower amount of TAp63γ protein in the βTrCP1–/– MEFs compared with the βTrCP1+/– MEFs (∼30%), although the TAp63β protein level is not affected (Fig. 1A, top). Since the p63 antibody is pan-specific, O3C keratinocytes were used as positive control for the p63 isoforms (23King K.E. Ponnamperuma R.M. Gerdes M.J. Tokino T. Yamashita T. Baker C.C. Weinberg W.C. Carcinogenesis. 2006; 27: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Kulesz-Martin M. Lagowski J. Fei S. Pelz C. Sears R. Powell M.B. Halaban R. Johnson J. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 2005; 10: 142-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Further, when the mRNA levels were examined using semiquantitative RT-PCR with TA-specific p63 primers, little change was observed (less than 0.5-fold) in TAp63 between the βTrCP1+/– and the βTrCP1–/– MEFs (Fig. 1A, bottom). Since the protein level of TAp63β is minor compared with the level of TAp63γ, by WB, this RT-PCR measurement is representative of the TAp63γ RNA levels. Next, to determine if this observation was specific to βTrCP1 expression, we repeated this experiment in H1299 cells, a cell line that is p53 null and has undetectable endogenous expression of p63 and p73 by WB. In fact, in the presence of increased βTrCP1, the protein level of TAp63γ increased significantly above the level of TAp63γ alone (Fig. 1B, lane 4 versus lane 2). Therefore, TAp63γ protein levels are also increased by a subsequent increase of βTrCP1. These results suggest that βTrCP1 must mediate the endogenous protein stability of TAp63γ through a post-translational mechanism. In order to verify these intriguing observations, we measured the half-life of exogenous TAp63γ in the presence βTrCP1. Again, to our surprise, although βTrCP1 has been shown to be involved in the degradation of its substrates, our data demonstrate that it stabilizes TAp63γ. As shown in Fig. 1C, although the exogenous GFP-TAp63γ alone has a half-life of ∼2–3 h, comparable with others' published data (25Rossi M. Aqeilan R.I. Neale M. Candi E. Salomoni P. Knight R.A. Croce C.M. Melino G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), the GFP-TAp63γ co-expressed with the FLAG-βTrCP1 was highly stabilized over 6 h. We also confirmed this result using a labeled pulse-chase (data not shown). Further, to examine the effect of βTrCP on endogenous p63 stability, we used a human keratinocyte line with several p63 isoforms and βTrCP1 (HaCaT). The cells were treated with siRNA oligonucleotides against βTrCP1/2 (since βTrCP2 often rescues βTrCP1 if knocked down alone). An initial experiment was performed to determine the efficiency of knockdown at both 24 and 48 h post-knockdown to find the optimal time to start the degradation assay. Knockdown was confirmed, at 0.47-fold versus the scramble control at 48 h (Fig. 1D). This degree of reduction is biologically significant, since several groups have shown that βTrCP1 is affected by both haploinsufficiency and dominant-negative mutants in vivo (10Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Kumar K.G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), compared with the control, by WB (Fig. 1D). Therefore, for our half-life, time 0 for the cycloheximide exposure in Fig. 1E is 48 h after oligonucleotide transfection. As predicted from the data above, the half-life of p63 in the βTrCP1/2 knockdown cells was shorter (about 1.5 h) versus the control (about 3.5 h) (Fig. 1E). The βTrCP1/2 siRNA treatment also reduced the level of endogenous steady-state p63 (data not shown), supporting the result in Fig. 1A. Therefore, βTrCP1 co-expression stabilizes TAp63γ exogenously and endogenously. TAp63γ Binds βTrCP1—In order to determine how βTrCP1 regulates TAp63γ stability, we next asked whether βTrCP1 could bind TAp63γ in cells. HEK293 cells, which express an undetectable endogenous level of p63, were transfected with GFP-TAp63γ, GFP-ΔNp63γ, or FLAG-βTrCP1, followed by co-IP and WB. As shown in Fig. 2A, both TAp63γ and ΔNp63γ immunoprecipitated using FLAG antibody for βTrCP1 (lanes11 and 12). Also, FLAG-βTrCP1 immunoprecipitated with GFP antibody for both TAp63γ and ΔNp63γ (lanes 5 and 6). This result was also repeated in H1299 cells (data not shown). Also of note, TAp63γ bound to βTrCP1 much more efficiently than to ΔNp63γ (compare lanes 5 and 11 with lanes 6 and 12). Next, to determine if TAp63γ and βTrCP1 interacted directly in vitro, we performed GST pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 2B, we found that TAp63γ precipitated on the GST-βTrCP1 bead but not on the GST0 bead (compare last lane with middle lane) when probed with a p63-specific antibody. This result demonstrates that TAp63γ and βTrCP1 interact directly in vitro. We then determined if βTrCP1 could bind other p63 isoforms, using co-IP, as in Fig. 2A, with p63α constructs. HEK293 cells were transfected with a combination of FLAG-βTrCP1, Myc-TAp63α, Myc-ΔNp63α, and empty vector, as noted. Again, both the TAp63α and ΔNp63α isoforms bound to βTrCP1 (supplemental Fig. 1). Further, we tested whether this interaction existed endogenously using co-IP in HEKn-E6/E7 cells, a human keratinocyte line that has high levels of p63 and βTrCP1 (supplemental Fig. 2). By co-IP, βTrCP1 immunoprecipitated with ΔNp63α and TAp63γ but not with TAp63β endogenously (Fig. 2C, lane 2). Also, p63 immunoprecipitated with βTrCP1 endogenously (lane 1). These results were also repeated using HaCaT and HeLa cell lysates. Therefore, βTrCP1 is able to interact with several isoforms of p63 both exogenously and endogenously. Of note, endogenous βTrCP1 appeared to associate with ΔNp63α more efficiently than with TAp63γ (Fig. 2C). This result, although intriguing, was not surprising, since βTrCP1 bound to both the N and C termini of p63 as shown below. Also, we observed that TAp63γ was more efficiently ubiquitylated than was ΔNp63α (data not shown) (see Fig. 7), and this could explain why most of the βTrCP1-bound p63 molecules were ΔNp63α, but not TAp63γ, since most of the latter became polyubiquitin-TAp63γ.FIGURE 7SCFβTrCP1 ubiquitylates TAp63γ.A, TAp63 isoforms are more ubiquitylated in cells.

To identify proteins that interact with IRS and modulate IRS-mediated signals, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening with IRS-1 as bait. Out of 109 cDNA-positive clones identified from a human placental cDNA library, two clones encoded 53BP2, p53-binding protein 2 (53BP2S), a short form splicing variant of the apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 that possesses Src homology region 3 domain, and ankyrin repeats domain, and had been reported to interact with p53, Bcl-2, and NF-κB. Interaction of 53BP2S with IRS-1 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays in COS-7 cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The Src homology region 3 domain and ankyrin repeats domain of 53BP2S were responsible for its interaction with IRS-1, whereas the phosphotyrosine binding domain and a central domain (amino acid residues 750-861) of IRS-1 were required for its interaction with 53BP2S. In CHO-C400 cells, expression of 53BP2S reduced insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation with a concomitant enhancement of IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, the amount of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory p85 subunit associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, and activation of Akt was enhanced by 53BP2S expression. Although 53BP2S also enhanced Akt activation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin-induced glucose transporter 4 translocation was markedly inhibited in accordance with reduction of insulin-induced AS160 phosphorylation. Together these data demonstrate that 53BP2S interacts and modulates the insulin signals mediated by IRSs.

Activated receptor kinases phosphorylate several intracellular substrates, including insulin receptor substrates (IRSs), Shc Cbl, or Crk. Tyrosine phosphorylation of these substrates leads to their binding to several intermediate signaling molecules containing SH2 domains. In particular, the binding of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase to IRSs results in the recruitment and activation of the p110 catalytic subunit (3Skolnik E.Y. Lee C.H. Batzer A.

Thus, the IRS family proteins play essential roles as intermediate mediators for this signal transduction pathway central to the biological actions of both insulin and IGF-I receptors. Four members of IRS family proteins (IRS1-4) have been identified to date (8White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These IRS family proteins share two highly homologous amino-terminal regions, the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, which play important roles in the interaction with receptor tyrosine kinase. However, the carboxyl-terminal region is not conserved except for the tyrosine residues possibly phosphorylated by the receptor tyrosine kinases (8White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, there are a multiple putative serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl-terminal region, several of which are reported to be involved in the modulation of insulin-induced IRS tyrosine phosphorylation and play important roles in modulation of insulin or IGF signals (18Le Marchand-Brustel Y.

For example, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes pretreatment with tumor necrosis factor-α reduced insulin-induced glucose uptake through an impairment of insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (25Hotamisligil G.S.

In contrast, we found that in rat FRTL-5 thyroid cells, chronic pretreatment with thyrotropin markedly potentiated DNA synthesis in response to IGF-I (28Takahashi S.-I. Conti M. Van Wyk J.J. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 736-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Takahashi S.-I. Conti M. Prokop C. Van Wyk J.J. Earp III, H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7834-7841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detailed analyses showed that thyrotropin pretreatment enhanced IGF-I-induced IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in the augmentation of IGF-I signals (30Ariga M. Nedachi T. Akahori M. Sakamoto H. Ito Y. Hakuno F. Takahashi S.-I. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Nedachi T. Akahori M. Ariga M. Sakamoto H. Suzuki N. Umesaki K. Hakuno F. Takahashi S.-I. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2429-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in both experimental model systems, in vitro phosphorylation assays demonstrated that Ser/Thr phosphorylation and association of some proteins with IRS are related to alterations of IRS tyrosine phosphorylation (26Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). Thus the identification of IRS-associated proteins is an essential prerequisite for understanding the alteration of IRS tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, this study was undertaken to isolate proteins that interact and modulate IRS-mediated signals. By using yeast two-hybrid screening, we have cloned a cDNA that encodes a protein known as 53BP2S, a short form splicing variant of ASPP2. Our data indicate that 53BP2S plays an important regulatory role by modulating the relative extent of IRS-1 versus IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent downstream signals mediating insulin-stimulated glucose transport.

IRS-1 cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Takashi Kadowaki (Graduate School of Medicine, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). IRS-1 cDNA containing full-length open reading frame was amplified by PCR using two primers, 5′-GGGGCATATGGCGAGCCCTCCGGATA-3′ and T7 primer. The PCR product was digested by NdeI and BamHI and was cloned into the NdeI-BamHI site of the pAS2-1 vector (BD Biosciences). The resulting plasmid was named pAS-IRS-1 and used for two-hybrid screening as bait. pGEX vectors were used for expression of fusion proteins with GST in Escherichia coli. By digesting pACT-53BP2S, the EcoRI-PstI, PstI-EcoRI, or EcoRI-EcoRI fragment, which encodes only ankyrin repeats, only the SH3 domain, or both domains, was cloned into the pGEX vector in-frame, yielding pGEX-ANK, pGEX-SH3, or pGEX-53BP2S, respectively. These plasmids were used for expression and purification of fusion proteins with GST in E. coli. pACT-ANK and pACT-SH3 were constructed in pACT2 vector (BD Biosciences) by the same way as pGEX-ANK and pGEX-SH3. pIRS-3 and pGFP-IRS-4 were constructed as described before (34Kabuta T. Hakuno F. Asano T. Takahashi S.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6846-6851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). pIRS-2 was constructed as follows. Briefly, EcoRI fragment containing the full length of IRS-2 was cloned into pcDNA3. pFLAG-IRS-1, which expresses FLAG-tagged IRS-1, was constructed as follows. Full length of IRS-1 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using two primers, 5′-CCCCGATATCAACTATGGCGAGCCCTCCG-3′ and T3 primers.

Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—pAS-IRS-1, which expresses the full length of IRS-1 fused with Gal4-DNA binding domain in yeast, was used as bait. cDNA library expressing human placental cDNA fused with Gal4 activation domain was obtained from BD Biosciences. Yeast strain CG1945 was used for the library screening. CG1945 cells were transformed with pAS-IRS-1 and human placental cDNA library by a lithium method. Transformants that could grow in the medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and containing 0.5 mm 3-aminotriazole were isolated. Only the colonies that turned blue in the β-galactosidase assay (described below) were selected. Plasmids from the candidate transformants were recovered from them into E. coli and further studied. β-Galactosidase Assay—Yeast transformants were grown for 2 days on the nylon filter in the medium lacking leucine and tryptophan. The colonies on the filter were frozen by liquid nitrogen and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in Z buffer (38.6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4). When colonies turned blue, these gene products were scored as having a positive interaction. Transient Transfection of COS-7, CHO-C400, and 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—The expression plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells using the DEAE-dextran procedure. Briefly, cells were grown to be subconfluent on 100-mm dishes. The medium was then changed to 4 ml of transfection buffer (DMEM containing 10 μg of DNA, 0.3 mg/ml DEAE-dextran, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). After 4 h of incubation, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were treated for 2 min with 4 ml of glycerol buffer (DMEM supplemented with 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Subsequently, the cells were washed three times with Hanks' buffered salt solution and cultured in 6 ml of growing medium for further 44 h. Then the cells were used for pulldown assay. CHO-C400 cells were transfected with expression plasmids by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Briefly, cells were grown to be subconfluent on 100-mm dishes. One ml of DNA solution (10 μg/ml plasmid DNA, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.05, 0.7 mm Na2PO4, 125 mm CaCl2) was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and added to the cultured dishes. Four hours later, medium was changed by fresh medium, and cells were cultured for additional 2 days and then used for some experiments. Transient transfection of 3T3-L1 adipocytes was described previously (35Min J. Okada S. Kanzaki M. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Ceresa B.P. Syu L.J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were detached from the tissue culture plates by trypsin buffer (0.25% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA in PBS), and the cells were collected by centrifugation and then washed twice with PBS. The cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS and electroporated at 1.5 mV and 0.95 mA (GenePulser II, Bio-Rad). DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added to the electroporated cells; the cells were then allowed to adhere to tissue culture dishes for 24 h, and the adipocytes were then serum-starved for 2 h before experiments. In some experiments, the electroporated adipocytes were seeded on coverslips. Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—pGEX plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 1 mm in the final concentration, and the expression of GST fusion protein was induced overnight at 26 °C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS with 1% Triton X-100 and lysed by sonication three times for 30 s on ice. The lysates were centrifuged, and supernatant was added to the glutathione-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated in the PBS buffer. The column was washed with PBS three times, and the GST fusion proteins were eluted by elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm reduced glutathione). Eluted solution was fractionated by 1 ml. Each fraction was subjected to protein assay using protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The most concentrated fraction was used for experiments. GST Pulldown Assay—COS-7 cells were transfected with expression plasmids as described above. Two days after transfection, cells were harvested by cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml aprotinin, 20 mg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 5 mg/ml pepstatin). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was subjected to protein assay using the protein assay kit. Cell lysates (1 mg of protein) were incubated with 100 pmol of purified GST, GST-53BP2S, GST-ANK, or GST-SH3 fusion protein at 4 °C for 2.5 h. Forty μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (50% (v/v)) was then added, and incubation was continued for additional 2.5 h. Sepharose beads were collected by centrifuge and washed three times with washing buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon membrane, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibody. Analysis of 53BP2S Expression in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate as described above. On 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 days after differentiation, total cellular RNA was isolated by the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 0.2 μg of total RNA with oligo(dT) primers using the SuperScript2 RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). To determine expression of 53BP2S mRNA, first strand cDNA was subjected to PCR. Two specific primers for 53BP2S, 5′-ACGCCCAGTTGCTGATAACG-3′ and 5′-CCAGCATTTGTTGCTGGGCC-3′, were used for PCR. The 36B4 gene was used as the internal control: 5′-AAGCGCGTCCTGGCATTGTCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGCAGGGGCAGCAGTGGT-3′ (antisense). Analyses of Insulin Signaling in CHO-C400—CHO-C400 cells transfected with pEGFP-53BP2S were grown to confluency, and the quiescent cells were stimulated with insulin (100 nm) for indicated times. Cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer, and 1 mg of total lysate protein was used for immunoprecipitation with IRS-1, IRS-2, or 4G10 antibody. Precipitants were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with 4G10 or p85 antibody. One hundred μg of total cell lysates were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with phospho-Akt-specific antibody (Ser-473) or with phospho-ERK antibodies. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Electroporated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed once with PBS and fixed/permeabilized with a solution containing 3.7% formaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin and 5% donkey serum in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature, and primary antibodies (1:200 for anti-Myc, 1:100 for phospho-Akt-specific antibody (Ser-473), or 1:100 for FLAG antibody) were added for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were again washed with PBS, incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to Texas Red (1:100 dilution), Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000 dilution), or Alexa Fluor 596 (1:1000 dilution) for 40 min and washed, and the coverslips were mounted on Vectashield for visualization using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Assay of the Glut4 Translocation to the Plasma Membrane—Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with pEGFP vector or pEGFP-53BP2S along with pGlut4-myc by electroporation. Twenty four hours later, cells were serum-starved for 2 h followed by stimulation with or without insulin (100 nm) for 20 min. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and followed by incubation with a Myc antibody. The ratio of the cells displaying Glut4-myc plasma membrane fluorescence was determined by counting the 50 cells that were co-expressing both the GFP constructs and Glut4-myc in three independent experiments. Quantification of Glut4 translocation was determined as follows. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected with 200 μg of pFLAG vector or 200 μg of pFLAG-53BP2S along with 50 μg of pGlut4-myc-eGFP by electroporation. Cells were serum-starved for 2 h followed by stimulation with or without insulin (100 nm) for 20 min. Cells were fixed without permeabilization and incubated with a Myc antibody. The ratio of Glut4 translocation was determined by comparison of the total Myc fluorescence intensity with the total GFP intensity. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. For comparison, the data were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Student's t test, and the difference was considered significant at p < 0.05. Identification of Proteins That Interact with Insulin Receptor Substrate-1—To identify proteins that interact with IRS-1, the full-length rat IRS-1 cDNA was fused with the Gal4 DNA binding domain in pAS2-1 vector and used as bait for a two-hybrid screening. We screened a human placental cDNA library fused with Gal4 activation domain in pACT2, and from 1 × 106 clones, 109 IRS-1 interacting candidates were identified. Among them, 33 clones included cDNAs encoding 14-3-3 isoforms (β, ϵ, and ξ), which were previously shown to interact with IRS-1 or IRS-2 (36Ogihara T. Isobe T. Ichimura T. Taoka M. Funaki M.

In addition to the various clones identified, two contained the same insert, a region of ASPP2 cDNA sequence corresponding to amino acid residues 881-1128. ASPP2 is an 1128-amino acid protein that consists of four ankyrin repeats domain and an Src homology (SH) 3 domain in the carboxyl-terminal region (Fig. 1A). ASPP2 was originally isolated as 53BP2 or the Bcl-2 binding protein Bbp (33Naumovski L. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3884-3892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B.

Recently, it was reported that 53BP2 is a 1005-amino acid protein and that ASPP2 contained an additional 123 amino acids to the amino terminus of 53BP2. In addition, 53BP2 is an alternative splicing variant of ASPP2, and they proposed that we call this splicing variant 53BP2S (38Samuels-Lev Y. O'Connor D.J. Bergamaschi D. Trigiante"
https://openalex.org/W2061239011,"Histamine, a biogenic amine with important biological functions, is produced from histidine by histidine decarboxylase (HDC), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme. HDC is thus a potential target to attenuate histamine production in certain pathological states. Targeting mammalian HDC with novel inhibitors and elucidating the structural basis of their specificity for HDC are challenging tasks, because the three-dimensional structure of mammalian HDC is still unknown. In the present study, we designed, synthesized, and tested potentially membrane-permeable pyridoxyl-substrate conjugates as inhibitors for human (h) HDC and modeled an active site of hHDC, which is compatible with the experimental data. The most potent inhibitory compound among nine tested structural variants was the pyridoxyl-histidine methyl ester conjugate (PHME), indicating that the binding site of hHDC does not tolerate groups other than the imidazole side chain of histidine. PHME inhibited 60% of the fraction of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced newly synthesized HDC in human HMC-1 cells at 200 microM and was also inhibitory in cell extracts. The proposed model of hHDC, containing phosphopyridoxyl-histidine in the active site, revealed the binding specificity of HDC toward its substrate and the structure-activity relationship of the designed and investigated compounds."

In the horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus, TGase is stored in hemocytes and secreted in response to the simulation of bacterial lipopolysaccharides. Here we characterized a TGase substrate designated as caraxin that was identified in horseshoe crab cuticle. One of the homologs, caraxin-1, possessed a unique domain structure consisting of N-and C-terminal heptad repeats and a central domain with a tandem-repeated structure of a pentapeptide. Western blotting showed the specific localization of caraxin-1 in sub-cuticular epidermis. Moreover, we identified the pentapeptide motif to be a chitin-binding unit. Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that caraxin-1 exists as an oligomer with 310–350 kDa, which is ∼20-mer based on the molecular mass of the monomer. The oligomers were cross-linked by TGase to form an elaborate mesh with honeycomb structures, which was electron-microscopically found to be different from the clotting mesh triggered by lipopolysaccharide-induced hemocyte exocytosis. We determined several cross-linking sites in the N-and C-terminal domains of caraxin-1. The replacements of Leu to Pro at positions 36 and 118 in caraxin-1 reduced the α-helix content, which destroyed the TGase-dependent mesh, thus indicating the importance of the N-and C-terminal domains for the proper mesh formation.

Horseshoe crab hemocyte is highly sensitive to lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), which are cell wall components of Gram-negative bacteria. Stimulation by LPS prompts exocytosis through a GTP-binding protein-mediating signaling pathway, which triggers the secretion of granular components, including serine protease zymogens, involved in hemolymph coagulation, a clottable protein known as coagulogen, protease inhibitors, lectins, and antimicrobial peptides (17Shigenaga T.

The coagulation cascade is composed of the clottable protein coagulogen and four serine protease zymogens.

TGase neither catalyzes monodansylcadaverine (DCA) incorporation into coagulin nor cross-links coagulin, whereas TGase promotes the cross-linking of coagulin with proxin, a hemocyte-derived proline-rich protein, resulting in a stable coagulin polymer (22Osaki T.

Interestingly, we observed TGase-dependent polymerization of several cuticular chitin-binding proteins, a finding that suggests that TGase-dependent cross-linking plays an important role in host defense in the arthropod cuticle. Several of the horseshoe crab cuticular proteins contain the so-called R&R consensus found in arthropod cuticular proteins (24Rebers J.E. Riddiford L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and some proteins contain a Cys-rich domain with a sequence similar to those of insect peritrophic matrix proteins and chitinases (25Elvin C.M.

In contrast, basic QH4 and QH10 contain no consensus sequences found in known chitin-binding proteins.

The plasmid was transformed into DH10Bac™ competent cells (Invitrogen), which contain the bacmid with a mini-att Tn7 target site and the helper plasmid, according to the manufacturer's specifications. The mini-Tn7 element on the pFastBac™ donor plasmid can transpose to the mini-att Tn7 target site on the bacmid in the presence of transposition proteins provided by the helper plasmid. The transposed bacmid was transfected into Sf9 insect cells with Cellfectin® transfection reagent (Invitrogen). The resulting baculovirus pools were collected from the cell culture medium at 72 h post-transfection. The insect cells were infected with recombinant virus and harvested 72 h after the infection. The cells were homogenized in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1% Nonidet P-40. The homogenized cell lysate was centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. The TGase activity of each fraction was detected by DCA incorporation into proxins (22Osaki T. Okino N. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. J. Biol.

TGase-dependent DCA Labeling of Cuticular Proteins—Cuticular chitin-binding proteins were incubated with TGase (enzyme/substrate = 1/50, w/w) in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and 10 mm CaCl2 (TA-Ca) in the presence of 0.5 mm DCA at 37 °C for 1 h. The aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) or Tricine-SDS-PAGE (27Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar), and the fluorescence-labeled proteins on the gel were visualized by a transilluminator. Western Blot—For Western blot, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and then treated with the primary antibody, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and visualized using a Chemi-Lumi One kit (Nacalai Tesque Inc., Kyoto, Japan). Total concentrations of extracted proteins with 2% SDS were determined using the Micro BCA™ Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce), and 10 μg of protein of each tissue extract was applied to SDS-PAGE. Preparation of Recombinant Caraxins—To construct expression vectors for recombinant caraxin-1 and caraxin-2 with His tag at their N terminus, DNA fragments encoding full-length caraxins-1 and -2 were created using PCR and were subcloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the expression vector pET-15b (Novagen). To construct an expression vector for non-tagged caraxin-1 and caraxin-2, DNA fragments encoding full-length caraxins-1 and -2 were created using PCR and were subcloned into the NcoI and EcoRI sites of the expression vector pET-28a (Novagen). To construct expression vectors for the caraxin-1 mutants, PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed from Leu 36/118 to Pro using oligonucleotides. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis for the creation of mut-3QN and mut-4QN of caraxin-1 was performed from Gln 30/31/32/115 to Asn. All constructs were verified by sequencing. These recombinant proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)/pLysS and purified using chitin-affinity column chromatography. The expression and refolding of recombinant proteins were carried out by the published method with slight modifications (28Koshiba T. Chan D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7573-7579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Homotypic Interaction between Caraxin Molecules—Homotypic interaction between caraxins was investigated by pull-down assay using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity beads. Caraxins with and without His tag were mixed with nickel-agarose beads in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 0.1 m NaCl, and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The resulting samples were centrifuged and divided into bound and unbound fractions. The bound fraction was washed with the same buffer, the protein bound to nickel-agarose beads was eluted with the same buffer containing 100 mm imidazole, and the aliquots of each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE. As a negative control, His-tagged complement control protein, a recombinant protein derived from a complement control protein-domain of horseshoe crab factor C (21Koshiba T. Hashii T. Kawabata S. J.

The sample solution was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.2 m NaCl, and the dialysate was used as an optical reference. For sedimentation velocity experiments, a sample solution (400 μl) at A280 of 1.0 and a reference solution (420 μl) were loaded into double sector centerpieces and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm. The acquired data were analyzed using the SEDFIT program (29Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar) to obtain the sedimentation coefficient distribution function c(s). The molecular mass distribution, c(M), was obtained by converting c(s) on the assumption that the frictional ratio (f/f0) was common to all the molecular species as implemented in SEDFIT. The protein partial specific volume was calculated from the amino acid sequence, and the buffer density (ρ) and viscosity (η) were calculated according to the solvent composition using the SEDNTERP program (30Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Ejima D. Tsumoto K. Arisaka F. BioProcess Int. 2006; 4: 42-49Google Scholar, 31Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Ejima D. Tsumoto K. Arisaka F. BioProcess Int. 2007; 5: 36-50Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with 110 μl of sample solution and 130 μl of the reference solution. Data were collected at rotor speeds of 4,000, 4,500, and 5,000 rpm and analyzed by the “nonlin” program as supplied by the manufacturer and globally fitted to a single species model. Identification of Cross-linking Sites of Caraxin-1—To determine Gln residues susceptible for TGase-dependent cross-linking, DCA at 5 mm was incubated with non-tagged caraxin-1 (0.5 mg/ml) in the presence of TGase in TA-Ca at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the labeled protein was digested by Asp-N protease (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 m urea at 37 °C for 16 h. The resulting peptides were separated by rpHPLC. To determine Lys residues that are susceptible to cross-linking, a biotin-labeled peptide containing a Gln residue was synthesized as a probe; biotin-DEQAAL was synthesized based on the sequence corresponding to Asp112– Leu117 of caraxin-1 with an amino acid replacement of Lys to Ala at position 115. The biotin-labeled probe (1 μm) was cross-linked with non-tagged caraxin-1 (10 nm) in TA-Ca at 37 °C for 1 h, and digested by Asp-N protease and separated by rpHPLC as described above. Aliquots of the resulting peptides were adsorbed to microtiter plates, and the peptides cross-linked with the probe were identified by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (GE Healthcare). The enzyme activity of horseradish peroxidase was detected with o-phenylenediamine at 490 nm by using a plate reader. The peptides cross-linked with the probe were confirmed by amino acid composition and sequence analyses. Quantitative Measurement of DCA Labeling—DCA at 0.5 mm was incorporated into the recombinant proteins by TGase in TA-Ca at 37 °C. Aliquots were taken at 10-min intervals from 0 to 60 min and treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The resulting precipitates were dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, containing 8 m urea and 0.5% SDS, and DCA incorporation into the recombinant proteins was quantitated by fluorescence measurements with excitation at 355 nm and emission at 525 nm. CD Spectroscopy—CD measurements of non-tagged caraxin-1 and the mutants were performed at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 m NaCl using a J-720 system (JASCO). A wavelength scan (200–260 nm) was performed on 30 μm protein solutions in cells with a 0.1-cm path length. Each spectrum was obtained by averaging three successive accumulations with a wavelength step of 0.5 nm at a rate of 100 nm min–1, a response time of 4 s, and a bandwidth of 1 nm. Buffer spectra were accumulated and subtracted from the sample scans. Identification of the Chitin Binding Region of Caraxin-1—Non-tagged caraxin-1 was digested with Asp-N protease. The resulting peptides were applied to a chitin-affinity column. Chitin-binding peptides were washed with water and then eluted from the column with 10% acetic acid. The resulting peptides were lyophilized and further digested with trypsin and were applied to the same chitin-affinity column. Chitin-binding peptides were then washed with water and eluted from the column with 10% acetic acid. Chitin-bound or -unbound peptides were further purified by rpHPLC. Binding Analysis by Surface Plasmon Resonance—Ethylene glycol-chitin (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) was biotinylated as previously described (32Shinohara Y. Sota H. Kim F. Shimizu M. Gotoh M. Tosu M. Hasegawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1076-1082PubMed Google Scholar) and applied to streptavidin-coated sensor chip SA with BIAcore 1000 (BIAcore AB). Non-tagged caraxin-1 was injected at a flow rate of 10 μl/min in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20, and the change in the mass concentration on the sensor chip was monitored as a resonance signal by using the program supplied by the manufacturer. Sensorgrams of the interactions obtained using various concentrations of caraxin-1 (10–500 nm) were analyzed by using the software with which the instrument was equipped. Binding Analysis by a Quartz-crystal Microbalance—The interactions of caraxin-1 with chitin, chitosan, and cellulose were examined using the 27-MHz quartz-crystal microbalance, Affinix Q (Initium Co., Tokyo, Japan). Polysaccharide suspensions were immobilized onto 27-MHz electrodes. The electrodes were dried at room temperature, washed with water several times for removal of the excess polysaccharides, and then soaked in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl, and monitored continuously for frequency changes at 25 °C. Non-tagged caraxin-1 was added to the solution. For the positive control, tachyplesin, a horseshoe crab chitin-binding antimicrobial peptide, was used. The frequency changes in response to the various concentrations (1–1000 nm) of these proteins were assessed. The dissociation constant (Kd) of each peptide against chitin was determined by the published method (33Sato T. Serizawa T. Okahata Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Optical Microscopy—Non-tagged caraxin-1 and the mutant L36/118P were incubated with TA-Ca at 37 °C for 16 h on a slide glass. After incubation, the proteins were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and were washed twice with 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl. After washing with the same buffer, optical microscopic observation was performed using an Olympus BX50 microscope. Electron Microscopy—For scanning electron microscopy, fixed samples were transferred into tert-butyl alcohol and freeze-dried. The dried samples were gold-coated in an ion coater and examined in a Hitachi S-3000N scanning electron microscope. Immunofluorescence Staining—Non-tagged caraxin-1 was incubated with the TGase in TA-Ca buffer at 37 °C for 16 h. To form a coagulation mesh, 1 ml of horseshoe crab hemolymph was collected into 50 ml of pyrogen-free 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl, and the diluted hemolymph was plated on a slide glass. After a 20-min incubation, the attached hemocytes were stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 1 h. The proteins were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and incubated with ethylene glycol chitin at 1 mg/ml for 1 h. The bound chitin on the proteins was treated with tachylectin-5A (1 μg/ml), and then incubated with anti-tachylectin-5A antibody and Rhodamine-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako). Amino Acid Composition and Sequence Analyses—Amino acid analysis was analyzed by an AccQ-Tag system (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). Amino acid sequence analysis was carried out using an Applied Biosystems 491 protein sequencer. Identification of Sensitive Substrates for TGase in Cuticular Chitin-binding Proteins—To identify sensitive protein substrates for TGase, horseshoe crab cuticular chitin-binding proteins were incubated with DCA in the presence of TGase and subjected to Tricine-SDS-PAGE. The cuticular proteins of 16 and 13 kDa were highly reactive for DCA labeling (Fig. 1A). The labeling reaction was completely inhibited by EDTA, which indicated the TGase-specific incorporation of DCA. The protein bands labeled with DCA were cut off from the gel and digested with trypsin, and the digest was applied to rpHPLC. The resulting peaks were subjected to Tricine-SDS-PAGE, and DCA-labeled peptides were detected by UV illumination. The N-terminal sequence analysis of the DCA-labeled peptides proved that the 16-and 13-kDa proteins are respectively identical to basic QH-4 (accession number AB201766) and QH-10 (AB201770), which are recently identified cuticular chitin-binding proteins (16Iijima M. Hashimoto T. Matsuda Y. Nagai T. Yamano Y. Ichi T. Osaki T. Kawabata S. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4774-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, we named these proteins caraxin-1 (basic QH-4) and caraxin-2 (basic QH-10) to signify that they are carapace-derived chitin-binding proteins for protein cross-linking. Fig. 1B shows the sequence comparison of caraxin-1 and caraxin-2. The proteins showed a sequence identity of 53%, and their sequences were divided into three domains: a Gln-rich N-terminal domain, a Tyr-rich central domain, and a C-terminal domain. The central domain was composed of tandem repeats of conserved pentapeptides such as GYYHP and GYYNP. Caraxin-1 and caraxin-2 contained neither R&R consensus nor the Cys-rich motif; therefore, they must have an unknown chitin-binding motif. Tissue-specific Localization of Caraxin-1—To investigate tissue-specific localization of caraxin-1, Western blotting was performed (Fig. 2). Caraxin-1 was exclusively localized in the sub-cuticular epidermis and was not observed in any other tissues; this suggests that caraxin-1 functions at the sub-cuticular epidermis. In contrast, TGase was not detectable in the subcuticular epidermis and was exclusively localized in the hemocytes and heart, suggesting that TGase secretion through the LPS-induced hemocyte exocytosis is a critical event for the cross-linking of caraxin-1. Identification of Oligomer Formation of Caraxins—Caraxin-1 and caraxin-2 were each incubated with DCA in the presence of TGase. As expected, DCA was incorporated into caraxin-1 and caraxin-2. Generally, the addition of an excess amount of DCA inhibits protein-protein cross-linking. Interestingly, even in the presence of DCA, the caraxins were cross-linked with each other, suggesting that they exist as non-covalent oligomers that lead to the accession of Lys to Gln between the monomers to be cross-linked readily by TGase (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). To demonstrate that the caraxins exist as an oligomer, we assessed the interaction between His-tagged caraxin-1 and non-tagged caraxin-1. His-tagged caraxin-1 was incubated with non-tagged caraxin-1 in the presence of nickel-agarose beads (Fig. 3B). As a result, non-tagged caraxin-1 was specifically coprecipitated with His-tagged caraxin-1 but not with a negative control protein, His-tagged complement control protein, indicating the oligomer formation of caraxin-1. Homotypic interaction of caraxin-2 was also demonstrated by the same pulldown assay (Fig. 3C). To investigate the molecular size of the oligomer of caraxin-1, analytical ultracentrifugation was carried out. Sedimentation velocity experiments revealed a single major peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 12.6 S with a slight shoulder on the high molecular weight side that was probably a dimer. Conversion of c(s) to c(M) gave rise to a molecular weight of 313,500 for the major peak (Fig. 3D). On the other hand, the concentration gradients obtained for non-tagged caraxin-1 in the sedimentation equilibrium fit well with a single species model with the molecular weight of 349,000, indicating that caraxin-1 exists as an oligomer, ∼20-mer in solution. α-Helical Structure of Caraxin-1—The multicoil program (34Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) predicted that caraxin-1 contains two heptad-repeat regions (Gln31 to Leu44 and Ala106 to Glu126) at the N-and C-terminal domains. To test whether the N-and C-terminal heptad-repeat regions form α-helical structures, we designed a proline substitution into caraxin-1 at Leu36 and Leu118 localized at the two heptad-repeat regions, respectively, which was expected to disrupt their structures (35Koshiba T. Detmer S.A. Kaiser J.T. Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chen D.C. Science. 2004; 305: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Wild-type caraxin-1 showed a CD spectrum with minima at 208 and 222 nm with an α-helix content of 20% (Fig. 4). The molar ellipticity at 222 nm for mutant L118P was reduced in comparison with that of the wild type. The double replacements, i.e. mut"

Six isoforms of the intermediate chain and two isoforms of each of the light chain families have been identified in mammals. There is evidence that different subunit isoforms are involved in regulating dynein function, in particular linking dynein to different cargoes. However, it is unclear how the subunit isoforms are assembled or if there is any specificity to their interactions. Co-immunoprecipitation using DYNLT-specific antibodies reveals that dynein complexes with DYNLT light chains also contain the DYNLL and DYNLRB light chains. The DYNLT light chains, but not DYNLL light chains, associate exclusively with the dynein complex. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that both members of the DYNLT family are capable of forming homodimers and heterodimers. In addition, both homodimers of the DYNLT family bind all six intermediate chain isoforms. However, DYNLT heterodimers do not bind to the intermediate chain. Thus, whereas all combinations of DYNLT light chain dimers can be made, not all of the possible combinations of the isoforms are utilized during the assembly of the dynein complex.

It is involved in numerous eukaryotic cell processes including the trafficking of membranous vesicles, viruses, and other intracellular particles. Cytoplasmic dynein 1 is a large multisubunit complex (∼1.5 MDa) containing two copies of six subunits, the heavy chain (DYNC1H), the intermediate chain (DYNC1I), the light intermediate chain (DYNC1LI), and three distinct light chains, DYNLT (previously called Tctex1), DYNLRB (previously called roadblock), and DYNLL (previously called LC8) (2Pfister K.K.

Most tissues express only the IC-2C and IC-2B isoforms. All six isoforms are found only in brain, where their expression levels are regulated during development, and changes in the expression levels of the IC-2C and IC-2B isoforms and the light intermediate chains are also observed upon nerve growth factor-induced PC12 cell differentiation (18Myers K.R.

However, much remains to be learned about the subunit organization of the dynein cargo binding domain. intermediate chain glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin. intermediate chain glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin. To investigate the contributions of different subunit isoforms to the structural organization of the dynein complex, we investigated the interactions of two members of the DYNLT light chain family, DYNLT1 and DYNLT3, with one another and with other subunits of the dynein cargo binding domain. The DYNLT light chain family was chosen for this study because the two isoforms bind to different proteins and mediate their transport by dynein (20Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Bode C. Wolfrum U. Sung C.H.

Also, structural studies indicate that the DYNLT1 and DYNLT3 light chains contain unique domains that are predicted to be utilized for specific cargo binding, whereas many of the proteins that bind to DYNLL1 and DYNLL2 compete with the intermediate chain for binding to the light chains (35Williams J.C.

We found that dynein with the DYNLT light chain also contained the DYNLL light chain, and that whereas all the DYNLT isoforms co-purified with the dynein complex, most of the DYNLL polypeptides did not. Using yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found that DYNLT1 and DYNLT3 form homodimers and heterodimers, and that the homodimers bound to all six of the intermediate chain isoforms in vivo. Most importantly, we found that the DYNLT1–DYNLT3 heterodimer did not bind to the intermediate chain. These results demonstrate that binding to the intermediate chain regulates the assembly of light chain dimers into the dynein cargo binding domain. Plasmids—Human DYNLT1 (NM_006519) and rat DYNLT3 (XP_343770) were cloned by PCR into pGEX-KG, (39Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal.

The six intermediate chain isoforms were individually inserted into the yeast expression vector, pGADT7 (Clontech). DYNLL1 (NM_053319), DYNLL2 (NM_080697), DYNLT1, and DYNLT3 were individually cloned into the pCMV-Myc and pCMV-HA mammalian expression vectors (Clontech), and the yeast expression vectors pGBKT7 (Clontech) and pGADT7 as described previously (34Lo K.W.

Yeast Two-hybrid Studies—Pairwise yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed as described previously with slight modification (16Susalka S.J. Nikulina K. Salata M.W. Vaughan P.S. King S.M. Vaughan K.T.

Briefly, AH109 yeast strains were co-transformed with the constructs as indicated in the figures according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). The transformed yeast cells were resuspended in 100 μl of sterile water and 20 μl were dropped onto both –2 and –3 plates. The –2 plates, lacking both leucine (Leu) and tryptophan (Trp), showed co-transformation. The –3 plates, lacking Leu, Trp, and histidine (His), demonstrated protein-protein interactions. To eliminate false positives arising from “leaky” HIS3 expression, 3 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, a competitive inhibitor of histidine synthase, was added to the –3 plates. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 5 days. Positive interactions were confirmed with a β-galactosidase assay that screened for the independent expression of the lacZ reporter gene. Co-transformation with the pGBK-p53 and pGAD-T-antigen vectors was used as a control for positive interaction. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Co-immunoprecipitations—293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and transfected as described previously (41Lo K.W. Kan H.M. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9552-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For the co-immunoprecipitation assays, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and spun in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C, and lysates were incubated 3 h at 4 °C with anti-HA antibody (10 μg) pre-bound to protein A beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The beads were then washed extensively with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The co-immunopreciptates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody as described previously (41Lo K.W. Kan H.M. Pfister K.K. J. Biol.

To study the equilibrium association of the members in DYNLL and DYNLT families, 293T cells were individually transfected with the HA- or Myc-tagged light chains and equal volumes of the resulting lysates with homodimers of the light chains were mixed together for 3 h at 4 °C. The lysates were then incubated for an additional 3 h at 4 °C with 10 μg of anti-HA antibody prebound to Protein A beads, and the co-immunoprecipitating proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Dynein Purification—Cytoplasmic dynein was immunoprecipitated from rat brain lysates with antibodies to the dynein intermediate chain and the light chains as described previously (33Dillman 3rd, J.F.

DYNLT Heterodimer Binding to the Intermediate Chain—To determine whether DYNLT1–DYNLT3 light chain heterodimers were competent to bind to the intermediate chain, 293T cells were co-transfected with His-DYNLT3 and Myc-DYNLT1 light chains. Cell lysates were prepared as described above, except that EDTA was omitted from the buffer. The lysates were incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Novagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes bound to the beads were eluted with 0.25 m imidazole buffer, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0, and the eluates were then incubated with cytosol from cells expressing Myc-tagged intermediate chain (DYNC1I-2C) for 2 h at 4 °C and diluted with lysis buffer. The mixtures were then incubated for an additional 3 h at 4 °C with 74.1 antibody bound to Protein A beads. The beads were pelleted and unbound proteins remaining in the supernatant were collected and concentrated by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The beads were washed extensively and immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 3.0. The pH of the eluate buffer was neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.1, and the supernatant and immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Preparation and Characterization of Monoclonal Antibodies to DYNLT1 and DYNLT3—The two light chain-myosin basic protein fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified with amylose column chromatography following the manufacturer's instructions as described previously (19King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman 3rd, J.F. Benashski S.E. Do K.T. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15033-15041Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The purified fusion proteins were injected into separate mice and monoclonal antibodies were prepared by the University of Virginia Lymphocyte Culture Center as described previously (48Kohler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12509) Google Scholar, 49Chang J.H. Sutherland W.M. Parsons S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 430-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Positive hybridoma colonies producing antibodies specific for each light chain were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay screening of tissue culture supernatants against purified DYNLT1- and DYNLT3-GST fusion proteins. Antibodies from positive colonies were screened in immunoprecipitation and immunoblot assays with lysates of the bacteria expressing the GST fusion proteins, as described previously (34Lo K.W. Kogoy J.M. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11205-11212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 42Dillman 3rd, J.F. Pfister K.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1671-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and positive hybridomas were cloned. Specificity of DYNLT1 and DYNLT3 Antibodies—The specificities of four antibodies to the DYNLT isoforms were demonstrated by immunoprecipitation or probing Western blots of bacterial cell extracts expressing GST-light chain fusion proteins (Fig. 1). Two antibodies, R1 and T1, reacted specifically with the DYNLT3 and DYNLT1 fusion protein bands, respectively (Fig. 1A). These antibodies also detected single bands of the appropriate size from brain and tissue culture cell lysates and microtubule pellets prepared from rat brain (Fig. 1B). The T1 antibody has a higher affinity for human DYNLT1 than the rat DYNLT1 (not shown). Because, the two proteins differ in only two conserved amino acid substitutions at the N terminus of the polypeptide; it is likely that the antibody is directed toward the DYNLT1 N terminus. Two antibodies, R2 and R3, immunoprecipitated both the DYNLT3 and DYNLT1 GST-light chain fusion proteins (Fig. 1C). Thus, these antibodies recognize both members of the DYNLT light chain family. The R1 antibody also immunoprecipitated recombinant DYNLT3. However, R1 did not immunoprecipitate the dynein complex (Fig. 6) suggesting that the epitope is masked when DYNLT3 is incorporated into the dynein complex.FIGURE 6Cytoplasmic dynein complexes have both the DYNLT and DYNLL light chain family members.

In this study, we isolated and characterized the zebrafish (Danio rerio) keratocan (zKera) gene. The human keratocan sequence was used to search zebrafish homologues. The zKera full-length genomic DNA and cDNA were generated via PCR of zebrafish genomic DNA and reverse transcription-PCR of total zebrafish eye RNA, respectively. The zKera spanning 3.5 kilobase pairs consists of two exons and one intron and a TATA-less promoter. The zKera encodes 341 amino acids with 59% identity to its human counterpart and 57% identity to that of mouse keratocan. Like mouse and chick keratocan, zKera mRNA is selectively expressed in the adult cornea; however, during embryonic development, zKera mRNA is expressed in both the brain and the cornea. Interestingly, it is expressed mainly in corneal epithelium but also in the stroma. A pseudogene was proved by introducing a zKera promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescence protein reporter gene into fertilized zebrafish eggs. Using morpholino-antisense against zKera to knock down zKera resulted in a lethal phenotype due to massive caspase-dependent apoptosis, which was noted by a significant increase of active caspase-3 and caspase-8 in the developing forebrain area, including the eyes. This is different from mouse, for which keratocan-deficient mice are viable. Taken together, our data indicate that mammalian keratocan is conserved in zebrafish in terms of gene structure, expression pattern, and promoter function.

Transgenic technology is a powerful tool for studying gene functions via strategies of gain of function and/or dominant negative mutations.

In addition, the transgenic zebrafish model provides advantages (e.g. shorter embryonic development time) (72 h), and transparent embryos allow easy observation with an optical device and easier treatment schemes in comparison with transgenic mice. In eye research, zebrafish have been proven an excellent model system for retinal development, degeneration, and glaucoma study; however, few corneal studies have been undertaken (8Xu Y.-S.

Zebrafish have transparent corneas, implying that KSPGs may also play a significant role in regulating corneal transparency in the zebrafish similar to what has been described in mammals. In this study, we take the first step toward the possibility of using zebrafish as a model system for corneal development and disease. The ultrastructure of zebrafish corneal tissue is studied by transmission electron microscopy. We also characterize the zebrafish Kera gene and its expression pattern in adults and during embryonic development. To investigate, the functionality of the zebrafish Kera promoter, we have employed 1.7- and 1.3-kb genomic DNA fragments 5′ of zKera to drive the EGFP reporter gene in zebrafish via transgenic approaches. Furthermore, keratocan gene knockdown via morpholino-antisense resulted in embryonic lethality, which can be attributed in part to a significant increase in the level of caspase-dependent apoptosis in the brain. The observation suggests that zKera may have a critical function(s) for normal zebrafish development other than serving as a regulatory molecule of extracellular matrix formation. Raising, maintaining, and spawning of adult zebrafish were performed as described in Ref. 13Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book: A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish Danio rerio. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar. Adult zebrafish and embryos were maintained at 28.5 °C on a 14-h light and 10-h dark cycle. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National Taiwan University. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis of the GenBank™ data base using the full-length human keratocan cDNA sequence identified a zebrafish expressed sequence tag clone encoding a putative protein sharing high sequence similarity with the human and mouse SLRP family proteins. A ∼3.5-kb NotI/MluI zebrafish genomic DNA fragment containing the 5′ portion of the zebrafish keratocan gene was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pBluescript SK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The complete nucleotide sequence of the insert was determined, using T3, T7, and walk-in primers, by the DNA core at the National Taiwan University College of Medicine. The 5′-end of zKera mRNA was amplified using the 5′-RACE System, version 2.0 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, one μg of total RNA from zebrafish eyes was reverse-transcribed with a keratocan-specific primer (5′-TGGAGTTGAGACATCAGGTGCTCA-3′) corresponding to a sequence in exon 2 of the zKera gene. The RNA templates were degraded by treatment with an RNase mix. A poly-dCTP tail was added to the 3′-end of the cDNAs with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Amplification of the cDNA was carried out with a second gene-specific primer (5′-TCATCAGAGTGGACTTG GCTG-3′) corresponding to sequence from the junction between exons 1 and 2 in conjunction with the abridged anchor primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG-3′) provided by the manufacturer. The 34 cycles of PCR were performed at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min followed by a 10-min extension at 72 °C at the end of these cycles. The resulting PCR products were diluted 100-fold and used as template to be reamplified with a third gene-specific primer (5′-CACAAATGCTACCAAGAGTACCT-3′) in conjunction with the universal amplification primer (5′-CUACUACUACUAGGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′). Finally, the PCR product was gel-purified, and the sequence was determined by dideoxy sequencing. The transcription initiation site of the zKera gene was determined by a sequence comparison between genomic DNA and the 5′-RACE product. Genomic DNA of 1.7 and 1.3 kb from the 5′-untranslated region of the zKera gene was amplified by specific PCR primers and inserted into the multiple cloning site of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), respectively. The recombinant plasmid was propagated in Escherichia coli DH5α and purified by the Qiagen Plasmid Purification Maxi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Purified plasmid DNA was adjusted to 50 ng/μl in distilled water and microinjected into one-cell-stage zebrafish embryos under a dissecting microscope. The living embryos with GFP expression were observed and imaged under fluorescence microscope. The sequence alignments were performed using the ClustalW program (available on the World Wide Web). Putative transcription factor binding sites were searched using the “TFSEARCH” program (available on the World Wide Web) with a default threshold score (of 90.0). The Cladogram was constructed using TreeView software. Total RNA extracted from eye, brain, heart, liver, gut, muscle, and fin by using TRIZOL® reagent (Invitrogen) was electrophoresed in 1.3% agarose containing 2 m formaldehyde buffered with Tris acetate-EDTA and blotted onto Magna-Charge™ membrane (Osmonics, Inc., Westborough, MA) and hybridized with 32P-labeled zebrafish keratocan cDNA in a hybridization solution containing 50% formamide at 42 °C overnight as previously described (4Liu C.-Y. Shiraishi A. Kao C.W. Converse R.L. Funderburgh J.L. Corpuz L.M. Conrad G.W. Kao W.W.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22584-22588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The excess 32P-probe was removed by stringent washing three times with 0.1× SSC and 1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min each. Hybridization signals were detected with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). RT-PCR was performed as described previously with some modifications (14Liu C.-Y. Zhu G. Converse R. Kao C.W.-C. Nakamura H. Tseng S.C.G. Mui M.-M. Seyer J. Justice M.J. Stech M.E. Hansen G.M. Kao W.W.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24627-24636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reagents used in this procedure, unless specified, were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The RevertAid™ H Minus First Strand cDNA synthesis kit was purchased from Fermentas (MBI Fermentas, Hanover, MD). The zebrafish cDNA was synthesized by using 40 μl of 5× reverse transcription buffer, 20 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 8 μl of 25 mm dNTPs, 10 μl of RNasin (40 units/μl), 10 μl of 50 mm random hexamer (Amersham Biosciences Inc.), 10 μl of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (9.5 units/μl), and 1 μg of heat-denatured corneal poly(A)+ RNA. Diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water was added to bring the final reaction volume to 200 μl, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, 42 °C for 90 min, 100 °C for 2 min, and 0 °C for 5 min. Each 20 μl of the above RT reactions was added to 80 μl of a PCR mixture containing the following: 8 μl of 10× PCR buffer without MgCl2, 8 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 10 μl of 20 ng/μl primers, 0.5 μl of Taq polymerase (5 units/μl), and 45.5 μl of distilled H2O. The PCR was done by using 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a 15-min extension at 72 °C at the end of these cycles. Primers were CCGCTCGAGCGGCTGCCAACGTTTTCAAACAA (forward 5′-XhoI restriction site) and TCCCCGCGGGGAAGTTAGGTTTAACCTAAAGAATC (reverse 3′-SacII restriction site). The PCR product was confirmed by an appropriate restriction enzyme digestion and analyzed by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel. Sense and antisense digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled oligonucleotide probes were synthesized by Bio Basic Inc. The oligonucleotide sequence (5′-3′) was CTCATTACCATCGAGACGAAGGTAGCGGAGACGTGGACTCTTCTCCTCCAGGTGATCATC. The embryos were sorted at the stages required for the experiment and staged according to Kimmel et al. (15Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8862) Google Scholar). Chorions were removed by manually with Dumont Watchmaker's Forceps No. 5. The embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS overnight at 4 °C, rinsed with PBS three times, transferred into 100% methanol (MeOH), and stored at -20 °C until use. The embryos raised to time points beyond 24 hpf were treated with 0.003% phenylthiourea to prevent melanization. Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science) with some modifications. Briefly, they were treated with cold methanol and rehydrated through a descending methanol series in PBS. The samples were permeabilized by protease K treatment (25 μg/ml) for 25 min and hybridized with the appropriate probe at 65 °C, followed by incubation with an anti-DIG antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase and stained with substrate nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate to produce purple insoluble precipitates. Furthermore, paraffin sections (5 μm thick) of adult zebrafish eyes mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher) were deparaffinized and processed for in situ hybridization with sense (control) and antisense probes of zKera keratocan mRNA. To remove nonspecific binding, slides were subjected to a stringent wash with 0.5× SSC at 65 °C and treated with 20 μg/ml RNase (Sigma) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by washing with 0.2× SSC at 65 °C. The hybridization signals were visualized with anti-DIG antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugates using procedures recommended by Roche Applied Science. Finally, the sections were counterstained with 0.5% neutral red and mounted. Images were obtained using an AxioCam digital camera (Zeiss) on a Stemi SV11 Apo (Zeiss) dissection microscope. Rabbit antiserum was prepared with a synthetic oligopeptide, CDNKGLKSIPVIPPYTWY, corresponding to the N-terminal amino acid residues deduced from zKera cDNA. The peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin for antibody production in rabbits. The antisera were further purified through a peptide-conjugated Sulfolink gel column (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions containing purified anti-keratocan antibody were pooled and concentrated, and the protein concentration was measured by spectrophotometry at A280. Human corneal tissue and adult mouse corneal tissue were homogenized separately with 4 m guanidine HCl solution containing 10 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm sodium EDTA, 5 mm aminobenzamidine, and 0.1 m ϵ-amino-n-caproic acid. After it was dialyzed exhaustively overnight against distilled water, the insoluble pellet was dissolved in 6 m urea containing 0.1 m Tris acetate solution (pH 6.0), 0.1% CHAPS, and 0.15 m NaCl (Sigma). The immunoblot of proteins from the two corneal extracts were then probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (0.1 μg/ml) raised against human keratocan and mouse keratocan separately. Adult zebrafish eye tissue was homogenized with lysis buffer containing 200 mm HEPES/KOH (1 ml) (pH 7.5), 200 mm sucrose (0.86 g), 50 mm KCl (0.04 g), 2.5 mm MgCl2 (0.005 g), 100 mm dithiothreitol (100 μl) in a total 10-ml solution. To remove keratan sulfate chains, protein aliquots were incubated with 0.1 unit/ml endo-β-galactosidase (Sigma) and 1 unit/ml keratanase (Sigma) at 37 °C overnight. The immunoblot of proteins were then probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (0.1 μg/ml) raised against zebrafish keratocan or monoclonal anti-keratan sulfate antibody (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan). These immunocomplexes were visualized by adding alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2500; Novagen) and Western Blue® stabilized substrate (Promega, Madison, WI). Both zebrafish larvae and adult zebrafish corneal tissue fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS were used for immunohistochemical analysis of the keratocan protein. Deparaffinized sections (5 μm) of adult zebrafish corneal tissue were placed on slides and processed for immunohistochemistry. Before immunostaining, they were incubated with 0.1 unit/ml endo-β-galactosidase and 0.5 unit/ml keratanase at 37 °C overnight. After blocking with hydrogen peroxide for 30 min, the whole mount and corneal sections were incubated with the affinity-purified primary anti-keratocan antibody (0.1 μg/ml) or monoclonal anti-keratan sulfate antibody, washed in PBS, and then incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG). After washing in PBS, sections were incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (DAKO Corp., Carpenteria, CA) and then washed in PBS and incubated with the 3′3-diaminobenzidine chromogen for 5-10 min. Negative controls were obtained by omitting the primary antibody. For transmission electron microscopy, the adult fish corneal tissues were fixed in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at room temperature. After refixation in 1% osmium tetraoxide for 4 h at room temperature, the samples were washed in phosphate buffer, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon 812 epoxy resin. Ultrathin 50-nm sections were collected on 75-mesh copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and images were photographed with a Hitachi 7000 Transmission Electron Microscope. Antisense MOs (Gene Tools, Philomath, OR) were designed to target at the 5′-untranslated region or flanking region, including the initiation codon of the respective genes. The MO sequence was as follows: zKera-MO, 5′-AATGCTACCAAGAGTACCTCCATAG. This oligonucleotide complements the sequence from -2 through +23 relative to the initiation codon. A random sequence (RS) MO served as a control for zKera-MO: 5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′. This MO is offered by Gene Tools as a negative control oligonucleotide that should have no target specificity. A search of the data base did not identify any sequence similarity to known zebrafish genes with the zKera-MO. Solutions were prepared and injected at the 1-4-cell stage as described (16Nasevicius A. Ekker S.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). Injected embryos were maintained at 28 °C until analyzed. TUNEL Staining and Acridine Orange Staining—Dechorionated embryos were fixed in 4% cold paraformaldehyde in PBS for 6 h and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series (50, 70, 85, 95, 100%), followed by 20 min in acetone at -20 °C The embryos were further permeabilized by incubating in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate for 15 min and in 20 μg/ml Proteinase K for 10 min. The samples were refixed with 4% paraformaldehyde before incubation with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase solution according to the manufacturer's instructions (In Situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science). For detection of apoptotic cells in live embryos, acridine orange (AO) was performed. For AO staining, samples were incubated in 5 μg/ml AO (Sigma) in E3 medium (5 mm NaCl, 0.17 mm KCl, 0.33 mm CaCl2, 0.33 mm MgSO4) for 30 min and observed by fluorescent microscopy. Caspase-3, Caspase-8, and Mitochondrial Apoptosis—To detect active caspase enzymes and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential during apoptosis, the image-iT LIVE Green caspase-3 and -7 detection kit, image-iT LIVE Green caspase-8 detection kit, and MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were performed in live embryos according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, samples were incubated in 1× FLICA reagent working solution for 30 min and protected from light. Thereafter, samples were washed with 1× wash buffer and observed under a fluorescent microscopy. Primary Structure of the zKera Gene and Comparison of Deduced Amino Acid Sequence of Zebrafish Keratocan with Other Species—We identified the zKera gene by performing a BLAST search of the publicly available zebrafish data bases against the human KERA gene. The entire DNA sequence of the zKera gene is shown in Fig. 1. As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2A, the entire DNA sequence of the zKera gene spans ∼3.5 kb (3589 bp) and contains two exons, one intron, and the promoter region. Comparing DNA sequence from the cDNA and the genomic DNA of the zKera gene, we found that exon 1 is 1373 bp and encodes an N-terminal domain and central leucine-rich repeats, and exon 2 contains 161 bp of coding sequence and 138 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence. The transcription initiation site marked +1 was determined via 5′-RACE as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The first translation initiation ATG codon is located at the 511th base from the beginning of exon 1. Therefore, exon 1 contains 511 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence. There is no TATA consensus sequence found in the ∼2.2 kb of the proximal 5′-flanking region of the zKera gene, which was utilized as the promoter region. The cDNA clone (∼1.9 kb) contains a 1023-bp open reading frame encoding zebrafish keratocan (341 amino acid (aa) residues). Like other SLRP core proteins (i.e. lumican (17Funderburgh J.L.

As shown in Fig. 1, after the signal peptide (Met-His; the first 20 aa), the N-terminal region contains a consensus YE motif for protein sulfation, which indicates the possible presence of sulfotyrosine(s) in zKera (19Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16859-16861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A central leucine-rich domain contains ten tandem repeats of the sequence LXXLXLXXNX(L/I). In addition, another genomic DNA sequence similar to the normal zKera gene with a 724-bp deletion from bp -690 to +34 was identified by different primer pairs, suggesting that there is a pseudogene of Kera that does not have an open reading frame and is designated as zKera′ in the zebrafish genome (Fig. 2, A and B). The zKera genomic DNA was subcloned and characterized by Southern blot hybridization, PCR, and DNA sequencing (data not shown). We have isolated clones representing the full open reading frame of zebrafish keratocan. A cDNA clone encoding the keratocan open reading frame was subcloned into the pBluescript SK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The open reading frame of the zKera gene was 1023 bp long and encoded 341 amino acid residues.FIGURE 2Schematic representation of the organization of the zebrafish keratocan gene A pseudogene was proved by introduction into fertilized zebrafish eggs by an enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) reporter gene driven by a 1.0-kb zKera promoter region.A, the figure shows the zebrafish keratocan gene drawn to scale. The blank boxes indicate the coding region of the mRNA. The translation start and stop codons are indicated by ATG and TAA, respectively. B, for detection of the pseudogene, primers used were as follows: primer A zKera forward, 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCGGGCAGGAGAGGCAGAGTAGC-3′; primer B zKera reverse, 5′-CGACGCGTAGTTAGGTTTAACCTAAAGAATCA-3′; primer C zKera reverse, 5′-AAATTGATCTGGATCAAGTTATT-3′; primer D zKera reverse, 5′-CCGGAATTCTTATATGACAACAGCCCTGAG-3′. Two different sizes of PCR products from zebrafish genomic DNA were obtained simultaneously by different primer pairs: primers A and B (lane 1); primers A and C (lane 2); primers A and D (lane 3). The deleted 724 bp of DNA sequences corresponding to the 5′-flanking region revealed that it was possibly derived from different loci and had no promoter function. C, generation of transgenic zebrafish harboring zKerapr1.7-EGFP SV40 (6.9 kb). It contains the 1.7-kb 5′-regulatory region of the zebrafish keratocan gene, untranslated region of exon 1 (511 bp), EGFP (∼700 bp), SV40 polyadenylation signal, and pEGFP-1 vector. D, generation of transgenic zebrafish harboring zKerapr1.3-EGFPbpA (6.3 kb). It contains the 1.3-kb 5′-regulatory region of the zebrafish keratocan gene, untranslated region of exon 1 (511 bp), EGFP (∼700 bp), bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal (bpA), and pBSKcript-II vector. E, generation of transgenic zebrafish harboring zKerapr1.0-EGFP SV40 (∼6.2 kb, 724 bp deleted). It contains the 1.0-kb 5′-regulatory region of the zebrafish keratocan gene (690 bp deleted), untranslated region of exon 1 (477 bp), EGFP (∼700 bp), SV40 polyadenylation signal, and pEGFP-1 vector. F, EGFP expression was observed under a fluorescence microscope in transgenic zebrafish after injecting linearized zKerapr1.7-EGFP SV40 DNA fragment at the 72 hpf stage. G, in particular, strong EGFP expression was expressed selectively at corneal tissue at the 7 dpf stage. H, almost no EGFP expression was observed under the fluorescence microscope at the 5 dpf embryo stage in transgenic zebrafish after injecting linearized zKera pr1.3-EGFPbpA DNA fragment.

https://openalex.org/W2000474220,"Lipopolysaccharide is one of the major constituents of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane and is a potent stimulator of the host innate immune response. The biosynthesis of the lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide is a complex process in which multiple gene products are involved. Two late lipid A acyl transferases, LpxL and LpxM, were first identified in Escherichia coli and shown to be responsible for the addition of secondary acyl chains to the 2′ and 3′ positions of lipid A, respectively. Here, we describe the identification of two lpxL homologues in the genome of Bordetella pertussis. We show that one of them, LpxL2, is responsible for the addition of the secondary myristate group that is normally present at the 2′ position of B. pertussis lipid A, whereas the other one, LpxL1, mediates the addition of a previously unrecognized secondary 2-hydroxy laurate at the 2 position. Increased expression of lpxL1 results in the appearance of a hexa-acylated lipopolysaccharide form with strongly increased endotoxic activity. In addition, we show that an lpxL1-deficient mutant of B. pertussis displays a defect in the infection of human macrophages.

Pertussis or whooping cough is a severe acute respiratory illness that is characterized by paroxysmal coughing and a distinctive “whooping” sound when air is subsequently inhaled. The disease is highly contagious and most severe in neonates and children younger than one year. Pertussis is caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis. While the genus Bordetella currently encompasses nine species, apart from B. pertussis only three other members, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Bordetella parapertussis, and Bordetella holmesii, have been associated with respiratory infections in humans and other mammals (1Mattoo S. Cherry J.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 18: 326-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The Gram-negative bacterial cell envelope is composed of two membranes, the inner and the outer membrane, which are separated by the periplasm. The inner membrane is a symmetrical bilayer composed of phospholipids, whereas the outer membrane is asymmetric and consists of phospholipids in the inner leaflet and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 2The abbreviations used are: LPSlipopolysaccharideS. typhimuriumSalmonella enterica serovar TyphimuriumLBLuria Bertani brothBGBordet-GengouMSmass spectrometryMS/MStandem MS3OH C103-hydroxydecanoic acid3OH C123-hydroxydodecanoic acid3OH C143-hydroxytetradecanoic acid2OH C122-hydroxydodecanoic acidC12laurateCFUcolony forming unitMM6MonoMac 6ILinterleukinTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine 2The abbreviations used are: LPSlipopolysaccharideS. typhimuriumSalmonella enterica serovar TyphimuriumLBLuria Bertani brothBGBordet-GengouMSmass spectrometryMS/MStandem MS3OH C103-hydroxydecanoic acid3OH C123-hydroxydodecanoic acid3OH C143-hydroxytetradecanoic acid2OH C122-hydroxydodecanoic acidC12laurateCFUcolony forming unitMM6MonoMac 6ILinterleukinTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine in the outer leaflet. LPS, which is also known as endotoxin, consists of three distinct structural domains: lipid A, the core, and the O-antigen (2Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar). The first domain, lipid A, functions as a hydrophobic membrane anchor and forms the bioactive component of the molecule (3Takada H. Kotani S. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 16: 477-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The structure of lipid A is conserved among different bacterial groups, indicating its importance for the correct functioning of the outer membrane. Generally, lipid A consists of a β-1′,6-linked d-glucosamine (GlcN) disaccharide carrying ester- and amide-linked 3-hydroxyl fatty acids at the C-2, C-3, C-2′, and C-3′ positions, and phosphate groups at positions C-1 and C-4′. The endotoxic activity of LPS is based on the recognition of lipid A by the TLR4/MD-2 complex of the host, which leads to the activation of NF-κB and, consequently, to an increased production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-1β (4Pålsson-McDermott E.M.

It consists of nine enzymes that work in a successive order. In the first step, an acyl chain is transferred from the R-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid (3OH C14)-acyl carrier protein to the GlcN 3 position of UDP-N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) by the acyltransferase LpxA (5Crowell D.N.

Then, the acylated UDP-GlcNAc is de-acetylated by the LpxC enzyme (7Young K. Silver L.L. Bramhill D. Cameron P. Eveland S.S. Raetz C.R.H. Hyland S.A. Anderson M.S. J. Biol.

The second late acyltransferase, LpxM, is closely related to LpxL and was initially described as a multicopy suppressor of an lpxL mutation (19Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J.

The structure of B. pertussis lipid A (Fig. 1) resembles that of E. coli. It typically consists of a GlcN disaccharide substituted with 3OH C14 residues at positions 2, 2′, and 3′ via ester or amide linkage and with an R-3-hydroxydecanoic acid (3OH C10) residue at the 3 position via ester linkage. A secondary C14 replaces the hydroxyl group of 3OH C14 at the 2′ position (Fig. 1) (22Caroff M. Deprun C. Richards J.C. Karibian D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5156-5159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Limited information on the genetics of Bordetella lipid A biosynthesis is currently available, and detailed analyses have only been performed for the acyl transferase LpxA and the 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid transferase KdtA (23Sweet C.R.

The goal of the present study was to identify the gene encoding the enzyme responsible for the attachment of the secondary acyl chain to B. pertussis LPS with the eventual goal to inactivate this gene and create a less reactogenic vaccine strain. We identified a locus of two lpxL homologues in the genome of B. pertussis, which raised the question which of these genes is responsible for the attachment of the single secondary acyl chain and what the function of the other LpxL homologue might be. The study resulted in the identification of new LPS forms in B. pertussis, required for successful infection of human macrophages. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—All bacterial strains used are described in Table 1. Typically, the E. coli strains were grown at 37 °C in a modified Luria-Bertani broth, designated LB (25Tommassen J. van Tol H. Lugtenberg B. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1275-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), supplemented with 0.2% glucose or at either 30 °C or 42 °C in a synthetic minimal medium (26Winkler K.C. de Haan P.G. Arch. Biochem. 1948; 18: 97-107PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.5% glucose, while shaking at 200 rpm. When appropriate, the media were supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 10 μg/ml tetracycline, 10 μg/ml gentamicin, 50 μg/ml nalidixic acid, or 300 μg/ml streptomycin, for plasmid maintenance or strain selection. B. pertussis was grown at 35 °C on Bordet-Gengou (BG) agar (Difco) supplemented with 15% defibrinated sheep blood (Biotrading). To induce the expression of the lpxL1 and lpxL2 genes from plasmids in B. pertussis, the bacteria were grown in synthetic THIJS medium (27Thalen M. van den IJssel J. Jiskoot W. Zomer B.

Open table in a new tab Recombinant DNA Techniques—All plasmids used are described in Table 1. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Promega Wizard®Plus Minipreps system. Calf-intestine alkaline phosphatase and restriction endonucleases were used according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Fermentas). DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels using the Qiagen quick gel extraction kit. Ligations were performed using the rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche Applied Science). The lpxL1 and lpxL2 genes from B. pertussis strain B213 were obtained by PCR. The chromosomal template DNA was prepared by resuspending ∼109 bacteria in 50 μl of distilled water, after which the suspension was heated for 15 min at 95 °C. The suspension was then centrifuged for 1 min at 16,100 × g, after which the supernatant was used as template DNA. The sequences of the forward primers, which contained an NdeI site (underlined), including an ATG start codon, were 5′-AACATATGCTCGTCACCCTGTTA-3′ (lpxL1) and 5′-AACATATGAGCCAATTCAAGA-3′ (lpxL2). The sequences of the reverse primers, which contained a BamHI site (underlined) and included a stop codon, were 5′-AAGGATCCTCATCGTTCGGGTTCCTG-3′ (lpxL1) and 5′-AAGGATCCTCAGTACAGCTTGGGCTT-3′ (lpxL2). The PCRs were performed under the following condition: 50 μl of total reaction volume, 25 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 3 μl of template DNA solution, 1.5% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 1.75 units of Expand High Fidelity enzyme mix with buffer supplied by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). The temperature program was as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, a cycle of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C, repeated 30 times, followed by 10 min at 72 °C and subsequent cooling to 4 °C. The PCR products were purified from agarose gel and subsequently cloned into pCRII-TOPO. Plasmid DNA from a correct clone was digested with NdeI and BamHI, and the LpxL-encoding fragments were ligated into NdeI- and BamHI-digested pET-11a. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli DH5α using the CaCl2 method (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmids containing the correct inserts were designated pLpxL1 and pLpxL2. The nucleotide sequences of the cloned genes were confirmed by sequencing in both directions. To allow for expression in B. pertussis, the lpxL1 and lpxL2 genes were subcloned into the broad host range, low copy number vector pMMB67EH. To this end, pLpxL1 and pLpxL2 were digested with XbaI and HindIII, and the relevant fragments were ligated into XbaI- and HindIII-digested pMMB67EH. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli DH5α. Plasmids with the correct inserts were designated pMMB67EH-LpxL1 and pMMB67EH-LpxL2 (Table 1). The pMMB67EH-based plasmids were used to transform E. coli SM10(λpir), which allowed for subsequent transfer of the plasmids to B. pertussis by conjugation. For complementation experiments, E. coli strains W3110 and MLK53 (Table 1) were transformed with the plasmids. To construct a B. pertussis lpxL1 mutant strain, we amplified a part of the DNA upstream of lpxL1 from B. pertussis strain B213 by using primers 5′-AAATTCGCTCTGGCGCTGCAC-3′ and 5′-AATCAGCACGCGTCTGACCGATGCGAATGAAAGGGCGG-3′, containing an MluI site (underlined). Additionally, a DNA fragment downstream of lpxL1 was obtained by PCR with primers 5′-AAGTCAGACGCGTGCTGAGACAGCGCGCGGCAGGAACC-3′, containing an MluI site (underlined), and 5′-AATCCACGTGATAGCGCCCGGT-3′. Both PCR products were cloned into pCRII-TOPO, resulting in plasmids pCRII-LpxL1up and pCRII-LpxL1down, respectively. An MluI-XbaI fragment of pCRII-LpxL1down was ligated into MluI-XbaI-restricted pCRII-LpxL1up. The resulting plasmid was cut with MluI to allow for insertion of the gentamicin resistance cassette from plasmid pBSL141 obtained by MluI digestion. Finally, an XbaI-SacI fragment of the construct obtained was ligated into the XbaI-SacI-restricted suicide plasmid pKAS32. The final construct, designated pKAS32-LpxL1KO, contained the gentamicin resistance cassette in the reverse orientation relative to the transcription direction of the lpxL1 gene and was used to construct a B. pertussis lpxL1 mutant by allelic exchange. Transformants were screened by PCR using various primer sets. Isolation and Analysis of LPS—LPS was isolated using the hot phenol/water extraction method (29Westphal O. Jann J.K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar) with slight modifications (30Geurtsen J. Steeghs L. Hamstra H.-J. ten Hove J. de Haan A. Kuipers B. Tommassen J. van der Ley P. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 5574-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The fatty acid composition was analyzed using a 6890 Agilent gas chromatograph (31Welch D.F. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 4: 422-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The lipid A moiety of LPS was isolated as described (30Geurtsen J. Steeghs L. Hamstra H.-J. ten Hove J. de Haan A. Kuipers B. Tommassen J. van der Ley P. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 5574-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and used for structural analysis by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) on a Finnigan LCQ in the negative (MS) or positive (MS/MS) ion mode (32Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Stimulation of Macrophages and IL-6 Quantification—The human macrophage cell line MonoMac 6 (MM6) (33Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Thiel E. Futterer A. Herzog V. Wirtz A. Riethmüller G. Int. J. Cancer. 1988; 41: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) was stimulated with serial dilutions of whole bacterial cell suspensions or purified LPS as described (30Geurtsen J. Steeghs L. Hamstra H.-J. ten Hove J. de Haan A. Kuipers B. Tommassen J. van der Ley P. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 5574-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The bacterial cell suspensions were prepared by collecting the cells from cultures by centrifugation, after which they were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at an optical density at 590 nm (A590) of 1.0, heat-inactivated for 10 min in the presence of 8 mm formaldehyde, and stored at 4 °C. Following stimulation, IL-6 concentrations in the culture supernatants were quantified with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against human IL-6 according to the manufacturer's instructions (PeliKine Compact™). Infection of Human Macrophages—For infection of human macrophages, bacteria were grown for 16 h on fresh BG blood agar plates, after which they were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen). Bacteria were added to 5 × 105 MM6 cells, which were maintained in 0.25 ml of pre-warmed Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium in 24-well tissue culture plates, at a multiplicity of infection of 10 (final volume = 500 μl). After 2 h of incubation (5% CO2 and 37 °C), 100 μg/ml colistin sulfate (end concentration) was added to the wells, after which the plates were incubated further for 2 h at 37°C. Then, the MM6 cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, after which they were lysed (1 min at 22 °C) in 0.15 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The lysed cells were plated onto BG blood agar plates, and the number of viable intracellular bacteria was estimated by determining the number of colony forming units (CFUs) after 72 h of growth. Infection experiments were repeated three times. The colistin sensitivity of the wild-type and mutant strain was determined by growing them in the presence of various concentrations of colistin and, after diluting the suspensions and plating them on BG blood agar plates, counting the number of CFUs. Association of B. pertussis to Human Macrophages—Association of bacteria to MM6 cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. 2 × 109 bacteria were labeled by incubation with 50 μg of fluorescein isothiocyanate in 1 ml of 50 mm carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at room temperature for 20 min. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bacteria were then washed twice with TSA (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2mm MgCl2, 0.5% human serum albumin (w/v) (Sigma)), passaged through a 5-μm filter (Millipore) for declumping, and resuspended in TSA to an absorbance at 600 nm of 1. Association to macrophages was assessed in TSA buffer by incubating (45 min at 37 °C or 4 °C) the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bacteria with the macrophages (multiplicity of infection 2, 10, and 50) and, after washing the cells, measuring the percentage of fluorescently labeled macrophages in FL1 by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—Data were statistically analyzed using two-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test (GraphPad). Alternatively, a Student's t test (two-tailed, two-sample unequal variance) was used. Differences were considered to be significant when p < 0.05. Identification of Late Lipid A Acyltransferase Homologues in B. pertussis—The 306- and 323-amino acid residue sequences of the E. coli K-12 LpxL and LpxM proteins with GenBank™ accession numbers NP_415572 and NP_416369, respectively, were used to identify putative lpxL and lpxM homologues in the complete B. pertussis genome sequence present in the NCBI data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/genom_table.cgi). BLAST search (34Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of two homologues of lpxL and lpxM, i.e. BP3072 and BP3073 with GenBank™ accession numbers NP_881643 and NP_881644, respectively. BP3072 and BP3073 show sequence identities of 21 and 29% to E. coli LpxM, respectively, of 23 and 31% to E. coli LpxL, respectively, and of 25% to each other. Because both proteins show a higher sequence identity to E. coli LpxL than to E. coli LpxM, BP3072 and BP3073 were designated lpxL1 and lpxL2, respectively. The open reading frames are adjacent to one another, with the stop codon of lpxL1 overlapping with the start codon of lpxL2, and, therefore, seem to form an operon. Upstream, in the reverse orientation, and downstream of the operon, genes are located putatively encoding a homologue of the S-adenosyl-methionine synthetase MetK and of the diaminopimelate epimerase DapF, respectively. Further BLAST analysis revealed the presence of lpxL1 and lpxL2 homologues in B. parapertussis, i.e. BPP0191 and BPP0190 with GenBank™ accession numbers NP_882552 and NP_882551, respectively, and in B. bronchiseptica, i.e. BB0194 and BB0193 with GenBank™ accession numbers NP_886744 and NP_886743, respectively. The mutual sequence identity between the Bordetella proteins is 97% for the LpxL1 proteins and 98% for the LpxL2 proteins. Furthermore, the genetic organization of the lpxL1/lpxL2 operon is conserved among the Bordetella strains. Cloning of lpxL Genes and Complementation of the E. coli lpxL Mutant Phenotype—E. coli lpxL mutants show a growth defect on nutrient broth above 32 °C (14Karow M. Fayet O. Cegielska A. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To test whether the identified B. pertussis lpxL homologues can complement this phenotype, we cloned the lpxL1 and lpxL2 genes into the broad host range, low copy number vector pMMB67EH under the control of the tac promoter and used the resulting plasmids to transform E. coli lpxL mutant strain MLK53 (19Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As controls, both MLK53 and the parental E. coli strain W3110 were transformed with vector pMMB67EH. The strains were first grown to early log phase in synthetic minimal medium at 30 °C, after which the bacteria were transferred to LB and further incubated at 42 °C. The growth defect of the E. coli lpxL mutant was complemented by the plasmid harboring lpxL2 (Fig. 2). The plasmid encoding LpxL1 did not complement the phenotype and its presence, as compared with the empty vector control, seemed to hamper growth even further. Overexpression of lpxL1 and lpxL2 in B. pertussis—The effect on LPS composition of lpxL1 and lpxL2 overexpression was studied in B. pertussis strain B213 after introduction of the pMMB67EH-derived plasmids. No obvious effect of lpxL1 and lpxL2 overexpression was observed upon Tricine-SDS-PAGE analysis of isolated LPS (data not shown). To evaluate possible alterations in LPS composition in more detail, the lipid A moieties of the strains were analyzed by MS in the negative-ion mode. This analysis revealed the presence of two major lipid A species in wild-type LPS (Fig. 3A). The peak at m/z 1557 represents the characteristic penta-acylated bis-phosphate species that is typically found in B. pertussis (22Caroff M. Deprun C. Richards J.C. Karibian D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5156-5159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the peak at m/z 1477 corresponds to a penta-acylated mono-phosphate species. Besides these two major lipid A species, several minor species were detected. The two peaks at m/z 1307 and 1251 represent deacylated lipid A species of the molecular ion at m/z 1477 that miss the primary 3OH C10 residue at the 3 position and a primary 3OH C14 residue, probably at the 3′ position (30Geurtsen J. Steeghs L. Hamstra H.-J. ten Hove J. de Haan A. Kuipers B. Tommassen J."
https://openalex.org/W2018817934,"Protein phosphatase I (PP1) is an essential eukaryotic serine/threonine phosphatase required for many cellular processes, including cell division, signaling, and metabolism. In mammalian cells there are three major isoforms of the PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1α, PP1β, and PP1γ) that are over 90% identical. Despite this high degree of identity, the PP1 catalytic subunits show distinct localization patterns in interphase cells; PP1α is primarily nuclear and largely excluded from nucleoli, whereas PP1γ and to a lesser extent PP1β concentrate in the nucleoli. The subcellular localization and the substrate specificity of PP1 catalytic subunits are determined by their interaction with targeting subunits, most of which bind PP1 through a so-called “RVXF” sequence. Although PP1 targeting subunits have been identified that direct PP1 to a number of subcellular locations and/or substrates, no targeting subunit has been identified that localizes PP1 to the nucleolus. Identification of nucleolar PP1 targeting subunit(s) is important because all three PP1 isoforms are included in the nucleolar proteome, enzymatically active PP1 is present in nucleoli, and PP1γ is highly concentrated in nucleoli of interphase cells. In this study, we identify NOM1 (nucleolar protein with MIF4G domain 1) as a PP1-interacting protein and further identify the NOM1 RVXF motif required for its binding to PP1. We also define the NOM1 nucleolar localization sequence. Finally, we demonstrate that NOM1 can target PP1 to the nucleolus and show that a specific NOM1 RVXF motif and the NOM1 nucleolar localization sequence are required for this targeting activity. We therefore conclude that NOM1 is a PP1 nucleolar targeting subunit, the first identified in eukaryotic cells.

Finally, we demonstrate that NOM1 can target PP1 to the nucleolus and show that a specific NOM1 RVXF motif and the NOM1 nucleolar localization sequence are required for this targeting activity. We therefore conclude that NOM1 is a PP1 nucleolar targeting subunit, the first identified in eukaryotic cells.

Mammals contain three genes that encode four PP1 catalytic subunits called PP1α, PP1β, and the splice variants PP1γ1 and PP1γ2; PP1γ2 is found mainly in testis and will not be discussed further here. The PP1 catalytic subunits are over 90% identical at the amino acid level, differing primarily in sequences at their amino and carboxyl termini. Despite this high degree of identity, PP1α, PP1β, and PP1γ show distinct localization patterns in interphase cells (4Andreassen P.R. Lacroix F.B. Villa-Moruzzi E. Margolis R.L. J.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); PP1α is primarily nuclear and largely excluded from nucleoli; PP1γ is highly concentrated in nucleoli, and PP1β is more uniformly distributed, with detectable nucleolar concentration in some cell types. Although these localization patterns of PP1 catalytic subunits are typical for interphase cells, their localization is dynamic and can change during the cell cycle or in response to different growth conditions. For example, elegant experiments by Trinkle-Mulcahy et al. (6Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Andrews P.D. Wickramasinghe S. Sleeman J. Prescott A. Lam Y.W. Lyon C. Swedlow J.R. Lamond A.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) have followed the location of PP1γ during the cell cycle and demonstrate that although it is highly concentrated in the nucleoli of interphase cells, it localizes at kinetochores early in mitosis and is then recruited to mitotic chromatin during anaphase. These data, as well as others (9 for example), indicate that localization of PP1 is not determined by the catalytic subunits themselves. Instead, it has been demonstrated that the localization, activity, and substrate specificity of PP1 catalytic subunits are determined by their interaction with one of many different targeting subunits (1Bollen M.

Over 50 different PP1 targeting subunits have been identified, and this family of proteins continues to grow. Examples include Repo-Man that targets PP1γ to chromatin (10Trinkle-Mulcahy L.

Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and PNUTS that targets PP1 to the nucleus (14Allen P.B. Kwon Y.G. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4089-4095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The importance of PP1 targeting subunits is further demonstrated by the fact that their overexpression can re-localize PP1 within the cell. For example, overexpression of Repo-Man targets not only PP1γ but also PP1α to chromatin (10Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Andersen J. Lam Y.W. Moorhead G. Mann M. Lamond A.I. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of PNUTS can relocalize PP1γ from nucleoli to the nucleus (9Lesage B. Beullens M. Nuytten M. Van Eynde A. Keppens S. Himpens B. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55978-55984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Most PP1 targeting subunits contain at least one copy of a so-called RVXF motif that interacts with the hydrophobic RVXF binding groove at the carboxyl termini of all PP1 isoforms whose composition is conserved from yeast to humans (15Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 16Meiselbach H. Sticht H. Enz R. Chem.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no nucleolar-specific targeting subunit has been identified. One recent report (18Huang H.S. Pozarowski P. Gao Y. Darzynkiewicz Z. Lee E.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 443: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) did describe co-localization of inibitor-3 (Inh3) and PP1 in nucleoli, although no evidence was provided that Inh3 played a role in targeting PP1 to this subcellular location. It is unusual that no nucleolar targeting subunit has been identified, because PP1γ and to a lesser extent PP1β are highly concentrated in the nucleoli of interphase cells. In addition, all three PP1 isoforms are included in the nucleolar proteome, and purified nucleoli contain enzymatically active PP1 (6Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Andrews P.D. Wickramasinghe S. Sleeman J. Prescott A. Lam Y.W. Lyon C. Swedlow J.R. Lamond A.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest an important role for PP1 in the nucleolus.The nucleolus is best known as the site of ribosome biogenesis. In recent years however, it has become clear that nucleoli play critical roles in other cellular processes, including stress response, assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes, and regulation of mitosis and proliferation (reviewed in Ref. 19Boisvert F.M. van Koningsbruggen S. Navascues J. Lamond A.I. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 574-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the nucleolar localization and activity of several important cellular proteins, including the retinoblastoma protein (20Angus S.P. Solomon D.A. Kuschel L.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3676-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), are regulated by serine-threonine phosphorylation and that at least the retinoblastoma protein is a well established substrate of PP1 (24Alberts A.S.

Cancer Cell Int. 2006; 6: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to identify targeting subunits that direct PP1 to the nucleolus and that modulate its activity in this critical subnuclear region.We identified NOM1 (nucleolar protein with MIF4G domain 1) several years ago based on its location within the common breakpoint region on human chromosome 7 targeted in children with acute myeloid leukemia that carry 7q36;12p13 rearrangements (30Simmons H.M. Oseth L. Nguyen P. O'Leary M. Conklin K.F. Hirsch B. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2002; 16: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 31Simmons H.M. Ruis B.L. Kapoor M. Hudacek A.W. Conklin K.F. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 347: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As part of an effort to define the function of NOM1, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified PP1 as a NOM1-interacting protein. Studies in this report verify the NOM1-PP1 interaction in mammalian cells, identify the NOM1 RVXF motif required for interaction with PP1, and further define the NOM1 nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS) required for NOM1 nucleolar localization. Finally, we demonstrate that NOM1 can target PP1 to the nucleolus and show that a specific NOM1 RVXF motif and the NOM1 NoLS are required for this targeting activity. We therefore conclude that NOM1 is the first PP1 nucleolar targeting subunit identified in eukaryotes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid—NOM1 sequences that encode amino acids 247–860 of the full-length protein were inserted into the yeast GBKT7 expression vector (Clontech) and the resultant plasmid introduced into the yeast AH109 strain. After NOM1 expression was verified by Western blot (data not shown), AH109 NOM1-expressing cells were mated to yeast cells pretransformed with a HeLa MATCHMAKER cDNA library (Clontech), and colonies encoding candidate NOM1-interacting proteins were identified and processed following the manufacturer's recommended protocol.Plasmids—Full-length (amino acids 1–860) and deletion (see below) NOM1 cDNAs shown in Fig. 1 were inserted into the BamHI-XbaI restriction sites of the lentivirus-derived CSII-CDF-EF-3xFLAG expression vector (32Miyoshi H. Blomer U. Takahashi M. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8150-8157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) kindly provided by Dr. N. Somia. This vector expresses 3xFLAG-tagged inserts under the control of the EF1α promoter (33Kim D.W. Uetsuki T. Kaziro Y. Yamaguchi N. Sugano S. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To generate NOM1 deletion constructs, primers were synthesized and used to amplify regions of NOM1 that encode amino acids 1–300 (NOM1-(1–300)), 1–350 (NOM1-(1–350)), 1–561 (NOM1-(1–561)), and 247–860 (NOM1-(247–860)). Each of these fragments was inserted in-frame into the BamHI-XbaI site of the CSII-CDF-EF-3xFLAG vector.The putative RVXF PP1-binding motif at 307 of NOM1 was mutated (m307) by changing Val-308 and Phe-310 residues to alanines using standard PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation was inserted into NOM1-(1–860), NOM1-(1–561), and NOM1-(1–350).Each of the NOM1 inserts described above was also expressed as an mCherry fusion protein. This was accomplished by amplifying the mCherry coding region (34Shaner N.C. Campbell R.E. Steinbach P.A. Giepmans B.N. Palmer A.E. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1567-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar) as a HindIII-BamHI fragment and cloning this fragment in place of the HindIII-BamHI fragment in the pcDNA6/His (Invitrogen) polylinker. NOM1 inserts were then introduced in-frame into this modified vector as BamHI-XbaI fragments to generate NOM1-mCherry fusion proteins with mCherry at the amino terminus.Several NOM1-eGFP fusion constructs were also generated using the eGFPN2 vector (Invitrogen). These included NOM1-(1–860)-eGFP, NOM1-(247–860)-eGFP, and NOM1-(1–269)-eGFP. As above, the numbering refers to NOM1 amino acids included in the construct. Human PP1α and PP1γ cDNAs were generated by RT-PCR and cloned in-frame into the EcoRI site of the pcDNA6/HisC (Invitrogen) expression vector, which includes His6 and Xpress epitope tags at the amino terminus of sequences inserted into the multiple cloning site.Cell Culture and Transfections—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells stably expressing eGFP-tagged PP1α or PP1γ (HeLaEGFP-PP1α and HeLaEGFP-PP1γ) were generously provided by Dr. Laura Trinkle-Mulcahy and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/ml G418. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2.Transfection and Microscopy—HeLaEGFP-PP1α cells were plated on 12-mm cover glasses in 12-well tissue culture dishes and transfected the next day with 1 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 4–6 h, cover glasses were collected and incubated for 10 min in 3.7% formaldehyde (Fluka) diluted in 1× PBS and then washed three times for 5 min in 1× PBS. After a brief water rinse, cover glasses were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and sealed with nail polish.Images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse TE200 inverted microscope equipped with the confocal imaging system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an Orca-ER digital camera (Hamamatsu). Cells were imaged with a ×60 planapo (NA 1.4) objective, 5–8 1-micron optical Z-sections and 2 × 2 binning. A settle frame was inserted between acquisition of each wave-length to allow time for potential residual signal to be cleared from the camera chip.Transfection, Protein Extraction, Western Blotting, and Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)—HEK 293 cells plated in 60-mm plates were transfected with 10 μg of DNA using 30 μg of polyethyleneimine (Mr 25,000 Polysciences, Inc). The polyethyleneimine was prepared by dissolving the powder in 80 °C water, adjusting the pH to 7.0 with 1 n HCl, and filtering through a 0.2-μm filter. The solution was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. After 48 h, cells were rinsed twice with 1× PBS and lysed by the addition of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.0% Triton X-100) containing the manufacturer's recommended amounts of Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science) and Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture 1 and 2 (Sigma). Lysates were sonicated on ice and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad).For co-IPs, cell lysates containing 400 μg of protein were rotated overnight at 4 °C with 40 μl of ANTI-FLAG® M2-agarose affinity beads (Sigma) that had been prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The beads were then washed four times with lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. Pellets were then resuspended in sample buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), denatured, and fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Fractionated proteins were transferred to Immobilon (Millipore) membranes and incubated with the appropriate antibodies in 1× TBS (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% milk. Antibody conjugates were visualized using the ECL Plus™ Kit (GE Healthcare).RESULTSIdentification of NOM1 as a PP1-interacting Protein in a Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—To identify proteins that interact with NOM1, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen with the Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System 3 and a HeLa cDNA library (Clontech) using NOM1 as bait as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sequencing of candidate NOM1 interaction partners obtained in this screen identified three independent clones that encoded the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase Iα (PP1α), making PP1α the most frequent cDNA identified.NOM1 Interacts with PP1 in Mammalian Cells—To determine whether NOM1 interacts with PP1 in mammalian cells, we conducted co-IP assays monitoring NOM1 binding to both endogenous and recombinant forms of PP1.To this end, we generated Xpress-tagged PP1α and PP1γ expression clones by inserting the relevant PP1 coding sequences into the pcDNA6HisC vector (Invitrogen). We chose to analyze both the α and γ isoforms because they differ dramatically in their subcellular localization in interphase cells; PP1α localizes primarily to the nucleus and is largely excluded from the nucleolus, whereas PP1γ concentrates in nucleoli (4Andreassen P.R. Lacroix F.B. Villa-Moruzzi E. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1207-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 8Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Sleeman J.E. Lamond A.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PP1α- and PP1γ-Xpress clones were transfected into HEK 293 cells either alone or in combination with the NOM1-3xFLAG expression vector. Protein extracts were then prepared, and expression of NOM1-3xFLAG and PP1α- and PP1γ-Xpress was verified in Western blots (Fig. 2A, INPUT). Aliquots of each sample were then immunoprecipitated with ANTI-FLAG® M2-agarose affinity beads and Western blotted with an anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) (Fig. 2B, WB: α-Xpress). As shown, the recombinant PP1α- and PP1γ-Xpress proteins were present only in co-IPs from samples also transfected with NOM1-3xFLAG (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6). These results verify the NOM1-PP1 interaction in mammalian cells.FIGURE 2NOM1 interacts with overexpressed and endogenous PP1. HEK 293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and extracts analyzed for protein expression by Western blot using the anti-FLAG antibody to detect NOM1-FLAG expression or with anti-Xpress antibody to detect PP1-Xpress expression (A). Extracts were then immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-FLAG antibody and Western blotted (WB) with antibody against either the Xpress epitope or with anti-PP1 antibody (B). Extracts were also immunoprecipitated with anti-PP1 antibody and then Western blotted with anti-FLAG antibody (C). In this experiment and that shown in Fig. 3 we estimate that ∼1% of the input PP1 co-immunoprecipitates with NOM1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NOM1 Interacts with Endogenous PP1—To determine whether NOM1 also interacts with endogenous PP1, we stripped the blot shown in the upper portion of Fig. 2B and reprobed it with an antibody developed against PP1α (Calbiochem). Data are shown in the lower portion of Fig. 2B (WB: α-PP1). Examination of this blot revealed that endogenous PP1, which runs slightly below the Xpress-tagged protein, was detected in Fig. 2B, lane 2, which represents a sample transfected with the NOM1-3xFLAG construct alone. We interpret this result to indicate that overexpressed NOM1 interacts with and co-IPs endogenous PP1. This is also evident in Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6, which were transfected with NOM1-3xFLAG and either PP1α-Xpress (lane 5) or PP1γ-Xpress (lane 6). Note that the anti-PP1 antibody, which is supposed to be specific for PP1α, also detected the PP1γ-Xpress protein (Fig. 2B, upper band in lane 6 and data not shown). This is a common problem reported for some “isoform-specific” PP1 antibodies (9Lesage B. Beullens M. Nuytten M. Van Eynde A. Keppens S. Himpens B. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55978-55984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Andersen J. Lam Y.W. Moorhead G. Mann M. Lamond A.I. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In either case, these data indicate that NOM1 can interact with overexpressed PP1α and PP1γ and with at least one isoform of endogenously expressed PP1.To further validate the NOM1-PP1 interaction, we immunoprecipitated samples with the anti-PP1α antibody and were able to co-immunoprecipitate NOM1-3xFLAG both from samples that included overexpressed PP1α (Fig. 2C, lane 4) or only endogenous PP1 (Fig. 2C, lane 2). We have also confirmed an interaction between PP1α and NOM1 in glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays using bacterially expressed proteins (data not shown). We interpret these data to indicate that the NOM1-PP1 association detected in the yeast two-hybrid assay also occurs in mammalian cells and that this interaction is not dependent on overexpression of at least the α isoform of PP1.Identification of a Critical RVXF PP1-binding Site in NOM1—Most proteins that interact with PP1 contain at least one copy of the “RVXF” PP1-binding motif that is defined as [RK]-X(0–1)-[VI]-{P}-[FW], where {P} stands for any amino acid other than proline, where X is most commonly a histidine or arginine, and where the motif is preceded by 2–5 basic residues and is followed by at least one acidic residue (15Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 16Meiselbach H. Sticht H. Enz R. Chem.

Chem. 2003; 278: 18817-18823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The predicted NOM1 amino acid sequence includes five candidate RVXF motifs (Fig. 1) beginning at residues 307 (RVRF), 507 (KNVGF), 594 (RVSW), 766 (KVVEF), and 777 (RVRF). Of the five candidate sites in NOM1, the 307 sequence is the only one flanked by the favorable basic and acidic residues.To define NOM1 sequences required for PP1 binding, a series of NOM1 deletion constructs and mutants were generated and used in co-IP experiments with PP1α- and PP1γ-Xpress. As shown in Fig. 1, NOM1 deletions were generated that removed the three carboxyl-terminal candidate RVXF motifs (NOM1(1–561)), an additional motif at 507 (NOM1-(1–350)), and the final motif at 307 (NOM1-(1–300)). An aminoterminal deletion was also generated that removed the first 246 amino acids of NOM1 (NOM1-(247–860)). Because the RVXF motif at 307 was the best match to the consensus PP1-binding site, we also introduced mutations into this site by changing the valine and phenylalanine residues to alanines (V308A/F310A; hereafter referred to as m307). These constructs were inserted into the 3xFLAG vector and transfected into HEK 293 cells together with the PP1-Xpress plasmids. Extracts were prepared to verify expression and to test for binding interactions.An example of data obtained with PP1α-Xpress is included in Fig. 3. The two panels in Fig. 3A (INPUT) verify that all constructs were expressed when probed with either the anti-FLAG (WB: α-FLAG) or anti-Xpress (WB: α-Xpress) antibody. Each sample was then immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody and Western blotted with the anti-Xpress antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B, PP1α was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated only from samples that included NOM1 constructs with a wild type 307 RVXF motif (Fig. 3B, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8–10). PP1α was absent from immunoprecipitates conducted with the NOM1-(1–300) mutant that lacks all RVXF motifs (Fig. 3B, lane 3) and with the NOM1-(1–350) and NOM1-(1–561) constructs that contained the m307 mutation (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 7). Co-IPs conducted with the full-length NOM1 construct (NOM1-(1–860)) that contained the m307 mutation (Fig. 3B, lane 11) revealed a very low level of PP1 in the co-IP, indicating that sequences downstream of 561 can contribute modestly to the NOM1-PP1 interaction.FIGURE 3The NOM1 RVXF motif at 307 is required for efficient binding to PP1. The indicated wild type and mutant forms of NOM1 were expressed as 3xFLAG-tagged proteins in HEK 293 cells either alone or in combination with PP1α-Xpress. Each sample was checked for protein expression (A), and extracts were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-FLAG antibody and Western blotted (WB) with the anti-Xpress antibody (B).

In this and in duplicate experiments, each co-IP blot was also probed with the anti-FLAG antibody to verify that the mutant and wild type forms of NOM1 were immunoprecipitated equivalently and that the lack of PP1-Xpress in co-IPs was not because of inefficient IP of the FLAG-tagged NOM1 mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Together, we interpret these data to indicate the following: 1) that the NOM1 307 RVXF motif is the major PP1 interaction domain and"
https://openalex.org/W2042184122,"The fgf-2 gene encodes low molecular weight (LMW, 18 kDa) and high molecular weight (HMW, 22–24 kDa) forms that originate from alternative translation of a single mRNA and exhibit diverse biological functions. HMW fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) inhibits cell migration and induces cell transformation or growth arrest in a cell type- and dose-dependent fashion. Conversely, LMW FGF-2 upregulates both cell proliferation and migration in most cell types. Although transcriptional and translational regulation of HMW and LMW FGF-2 has been extensively investigated, little is known about post-translational control of their relative expression. Here we report that thrombin, a key coagulation factor and inflammatory mediator, cleaves HMW FGF-2 into an LMW FGF-2-like form that stimulates endothelial cell migration and proliferation. The effect of thrombin on these cell functions requires HMW FGF-2 cleavage. This post-translational control mechanism adds a novel level of complexity to the regulation of FGF-2, and links the activities of thrombin and FGF-2 in patho-physiological processes in which both molecules are expressed."

This polypeptide can form pentameric receptor complexes with α1, α2, and α3 subunits in spinal cord, brain stem, and cerebellum. In addition, extrasynaptic homo-oligomeric α2 receptors may exist in the developing central nervous system (8Hoch W. Betz H. Becker C.M. Neuron. 1989; 3: 339-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). So far it is unknown whether the homologous M3M4 loops of GlyR α subunits can also contribute binding sites for cytoplasmic proteins. Here we investigate whether the large cytoplasmic loop of the GlyR α2 subunit, which is about 37% homologous to the gephyrin-binding loop of the β subunit, can interact with cytoplasmic proteins. In pulldown experiments from brain extracts using an α2 M3M4 loop GST fusion protein, we identified eukaryotic elongation factor 1α (eEF1A), ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6), p70 S6 kinase, MAPK ERK1/2, and calcineurin as potential binding partners of GlyR α2 subunits. Consistent with these biochemical data, immunocytochemistry revealed that rpS6 and eEF1A colocalize partially with postsynaptic GlyR clusters in cultured hippocampal and spinal cord neurons. Surprisingly, in aged spinal cord neurons, eEF1A and to a lesser extend rpS6 was translocated to the microtubular cytoskeleton. The redistribution of eEF1A could be modulated by GlyR and NMDA receptor activity.

These fragments and the rat cDNA of eEF1A were cloned in the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences) resulting in N-terminal fusion constructs with glutathione S-transferase (GST) (GST-α2 loop). All fusion domains were tagged at the C terminus with hexahistidyl peptide sequences. The expression of all fusion proteins in Escherichia coli was performed according to the instructions of the supplier of the expression system (Amersham Biosciences). Bacterial cells of 500-ml cultures were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 25 ml of bacterial lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The cell suspensions were sonicated on ice to break the cells, and soluble proteins were obtained by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied for binding of the GST fusion proteins on fast flow glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) using an Ettan-LC 900 purifier (GE Healthcare). Adult Wistar rat brain (1 g) was homogenized in 30 ml of tissue-lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 14 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm ATP, 2% (w/v) Triton, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture). The homogenate was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C with 15,000 × g. The column with bound GST-α2 loop fusion protein was unpacked, and the beads were incubated with 30 ml of brain extract at 4 °C by gentle agitation overnight. The column was then repacked, and the beads were washed with tissue-lysis buffer and a step gradient of 0.2 to 1 m NaCl in modified tissue-lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm reduced glutathione). All protein fractions from washing and the elution step (eluates) were collected and used for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. 60 μl of the 10× concentrated eluates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained with Coomassie Blue for detection of protein bands. For pulldown experiments using GST-eEF1A as bait, 1 g of spinal cord was used to prepare Triton X-100-solubilized protein extracts as described previously (11Pfeiffer F. Betz H. Brain Res. 1981; 226: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands were excised and subjected to in-gel digestion protocols as described previously (12Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal.

All fractions were pooled and dried in a vacuum centrifuge prior to analysis. The proteolytic digests were solved in 5 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). 0.5 μl of the sample was mixed with 0.5 μl of matrix (2 mg/ml 1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Fluka) in 50% acetonitrile, 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid) directly on a stainless steel target (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) and dried in ambient air. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded on a Voyager-DE STR instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems). Data base searches were performed using a nonredundant data base downloaded from NCBI. In addition peptide mass fingerprint analysis was performed by a commercial analysis supplier (Toplab, Martinsried, Germany). Rat spinal cord and hippocampal neurons were prepared as described (14Kirsch J. Wolters I. Triller A. Betz H. Nature. 1993; 366: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 15Dresbach T.

Cultured neurons were fixed with absolute methanol at -20 °C for 10 min. Fixed cells were incubated after blocking in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h with the following primary antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-eEF1A (1:100; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit anti-GlyR antibody (1:100, Sigma), rabbit anti-synaptophysin (1:400; Synaptic Systems), rabbit anti-vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT; 1:2000; Sigma), mouse anti-gephyrin (mAb5; 1:100), and rabbit anti-MAP2 antibody (1:2000; Chemicon). The secondary anti-mouse antibodies were conjugated to Cy3 (1:800); anti-rabbit secondary antibody was conjugated to Cy2 (1:400) or Alexa 647 (1:400). Confocal analysis was done as described (17Pauly T. Schlicksupp A. Neugebauer R. Kuhse J. Neuroscience. 2005; 131: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Analysis of fixed and labeled cells was also performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M motorized microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) attached to a SPOT cooled CCD camera (Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany). All images were collected using 100× Plan-Neofluar oil objective, and digital images were analyzed using Metamorph software (Visitron Systems). To evaluate the amount of colocalization with each receptor type or synaptic marker, we randomly selected five dendritic regions with a length of 15 μm. After setting a threshold for these regions, a quantification of the colocalization with the eEF1A immunoreactivity was determined by the software. Data analysis was done using Excel software. Glycine-treated cells were double-stained with phospho-specific rpS6 antibody and mAb5. Settings for all image acquisitions were identical. Statistics of total pixel intensities and total cell area were calculated as mean pixel intensities using Metamorph software. For immunohistochemistry a male adult Wistar rat was deeply anesthetized with diethyl ether and perfused with 4% (w/v) ice-cold phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde. The spinal cord was post-fixed for 1 h in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. The tissue was cryoprotected overnight at 4 °C in PBS with increasing sucrose concentrations (10-30% w/v) and mounted on dry ice with Tissue Tek embedding media. Spinal cord was cut at -20 °C into 20-μm cross-sections using a cryostat. The slices were rinsed three times in PBS, and the aldehyde groups were then blocked by incubation with 0.1% sodium borohydride followed two times for 10 min with 2% (w/v) H2O2 with 10% (w/v) methanol in PBS. The sections were permeabilized with 0.4% (w/v) Triton X-100 and blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (1.5% (w/v) horse serum and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). Primary antibody incubation followed overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer. Before incubation with the secondary antibody solution for 1 h at room temperature, sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated in blocking serum for 1 h. After washing the slices were mounted onto microscope slides and coverslipped (Marienfeld Lauda-Königshofen, Germany). Treatment of Cells with Glycine—Spinal cord neurons were cultured for 6 days in vitro (DIV). At DIV6 cell culture medium was removed, and cells were washed once with PBS, and medium was replaced by the following salt solution: CaCl2 7 × H2O, 207 mg/liter; KCl, 354 mg/liter; MgSO4 7 × H2O, 160 mg/liter; MgCl2 6 × H2O, 48.3 mg/liter; NaCl, 6.52 g/liter; NaHCO3, 2.55 g/liter; NaH2PO4, 62.3 mg/liter; Na2HPO4, 62 mg/liter; KH2PO4, 9 mg/liter, glucose 10 mm, pH 7.4). To avoid NMDA receptor-mediated ion fluxes within cultured neurons, the salt solution was supplemented after 5 min at 37 °C with the NMDA receptor open channel blocker MK801 (10 μm). After a further 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, the salt solution was supplemented with glycine (2 mm), and cells were incubated for 5-30 min (in general 15 min) at 37 °C. In another set of experiments glycine stimulation was repeated once. Therefore, the glycine-containing solution was replaced for 15 min by salt buffer followed by an additional 15 min of glycine treatment. Wortmannin and nifedipine were used in a final concentration of 10 μm each. After treatments the salt buffer was removed, and cells were washed once with 1× PBS, and cell culture plates were put on ice. Cells from 1 well (of a 6-well plate) were scraped off with 200 μl of cell lysis buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and treated for 5 min at 95 °C. Treatment of Cells with NMDA, Strychnine, and ERK1/2 Inhibitor—Cultured spinal cord neurons were treated at DIV14 for 4 days by supplementing the media with 2 μm strychnine, 5 μm NMDA, 1 μm ERK1/2 inhibitor (catalog number 328006, Calbiochem), respectively, or as a combination of strychnine with NMDA or ERK1/2 inhibitor with NMDA. To identify cells with different intracellular localization of eEF1A, cells were double-labeled with rabbit antibody against VIAAT for presynaptic terminals and with anti-eEF1A antibody. For quantitative evaluation, cultures were coded, and 100 cells/treatment were selected by positive VIAAT staining. These cells were analyzed with respect to the subcellular localization of eEF1A. The number of cells with cytoskeletal localization of eEF1A was compared with control cells. The statistical analysis was made using Excel software. Protein content was measured using 10 μl of cell lysate in 1 ml of a BCA assay (Pierce), and equal amounts of proteins were separated on NuPAGE 4-12% gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were probed with mouse monoclonal eEF1A antibody (1:10,000; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), with rabbit phospho-rpS6 (Ser-235/236) antibody (1:4000; catalog number 2211, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), with rabbit phospho-rps6 (Ser-240/244) antibody (1:4000; catalog number 2215, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), with mouse rpS6 antibody (1:2000; catalog number 2317, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), with phospho-p70 S6 kinase (Thr-389) antibody (1:2000; catalog number 9205, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), with phospho-p70 S6 kinase (Thr-421/Ser-424) antibody (1:2000; catalog number 9204, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), and with a monoclonal GlyR antibody (mAb4) (1:50) (16Pfeiffer F. Simler R. Grenningloh G. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7224-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies were detected using ECL Plus from Amersham Biosciences. After suitable exposure times films were developed and signals were scanned and analyzed using Kodak Digital Science one-dimensional software. Values of phospho-specific rpS6-signals were normalized to total rpS6-specific signals, and values are presented as relative signal intensities. Identification of eEF1A and Calcineurin as Binding Partners of the GlyR α2 Subunit—To identify proteins interacting with the GlyR α2 subunit, we used a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the large cytoplasmic loop of the GlyR α2 subunit (GST-α2 loop) as bait in pulldown experiments with rat brain extracts. GST-α2 loop or GST was expressed in Escherichia coli, and after extraction, GST and GST-α2 loop fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. The beads were subsequently incubated with adult rat brain extracts. After column washing, GST fusion proteins together with bound proteins were eluted with reduced glutathione, separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and the resulting protein patterns compared (Fig. 1a). Seven protein bands with apparent molecular masses ranging from 45 to 140 kDa were present in eluates of GST-α2 loop fusion protein columns but not visible in GST pulldowns and were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. One protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 52 kDa was identified as the translation elongation factor 1A, a monomeric GTPase involved in protein synthesis (Fig. 1a). Here a match of 23 peptides with a minimal coverage of 53% of the eEF1A2 sequence was found. A second protein with an apparent molecular mass of around 58 kDa (Fig. 1a) was identified as the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent type II phosphatase calcineurin. The other proteins identified in these experiments were LANCL1 (NCBI accession number CAB63943); eEF1Bγ (accession number 13626388); CRMP4 (accession number AAK64497); Nedd4 (accession number U50842), and nardilysin (accession number NP037125). By subsequent immunoblot analysis, LANCL, CRMP4, and Nedd4 were shown to be bound in GST pulldown experiments and therefore were excluded from further analysis. eEF1Bγ and nardilysin were not yet further analyzed. To ensure binding specificity of eEF1A and calcineurin to the GST-α2 loop fusion protein, we repeated the pulldown experiments applying higher salt washes (1 m NaCl) and included GST-gephyrin in addition to GST alone as another negative control protein. Immunoblotting experiments of protein eluates with anti-eEF1A- and anti-calcineurin-specific antibodies confirmed that both proteins bound specifically to the GST-α2 loop but not to GST alone or gephyrin-GST columns (Fig. 1, b and c). As an additional control we performed immunoblot analysis with GST-α2 loop pulldown experiments with rat brain extracts using an antibody directed against the presynaptic protein synaptophysin and showed that this protein did not bind to the GST-α2 loop fusion protein (Fig. 1d). To investigate whether the binding of eEF1A and GlyR α2 loop sequences might be direct or indirect, we cloned eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 coding sequences from rat brain cDNA into a bacterial plasmid vector allowing the expression and purification of His-tagged fusion proteins. However, using purified eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 proteins in GST-α2 loop pulldown experiments, we could not prove a direct binding of both proteins, suggesting that a bridging protein was missing in these experiments (data not shown). Identification of Additional Components of the Translational Machinery as Binding Partners of the GlyR α2 Subunit—eEF1A is an essential component of the translational machinery. Therefore, we tested the eluted column fraction by immunoblotting for the presence of additional proteins known to be involved in regulation of protein synthesis. With this approach, we identified the rpS6 (Fig. 1e), which is positioned at the RNA-binding site of the 40 S small ribosomal subunit. This protein also bound to a small degree to GST alone, but could be washed off by 1 m NaCl. No rpS6 was detected in glutathione eluates from GST control experiments. The second protein identified by this approach was p70 S6 kinase, which is known to phosphorylate rpS6. Similarly, this protein was detected by immunoblotting in pulldown complexes eluted from the GST-α2 loop fusion protein but not from gephyrin-GST or GST alone (Fig. 1f). Again, the binding of rpS6 protein to the GST-α2 loop fusion protein was resistant to high salt washes, suggesting a high affinity binding to the GlyR α2 loop domain. To further corroborate the interaction of eEF1A with the GlyR α2 subunit, we constructed an eEF1A2-GST fusion protein expression construct and performed pulldown experiments with the purified eEF1A2-GST fusion protein and solubilized membrane proteins from rat spinal cord. These experiments revealed that eEF1A2-GST pulldown eluates contain GlyR α subunits, confirming our previous findings (Fig. 1g). The Phosphorylation of rpS6 Is Modulated upon GlyR Activation—The identification of eEF1A, rpS6, and p70 S6 kinase as putative interaction partners of the GlyR suggested that the activity state of this ligand-gated ion channel might be relevant for the regulation of protein synthesis within neurons. Conceivably, the activity of p70 S6 kinase could be regulated by GlyR activity and thus the phosphorylation state of rpS6 might be dependent on GlyR activation. As rpS6 phosphorylation was shown to be one cellular mechanism for the regulation of protein synthesis (18Bader A.G. Kang S. Li Zhao Vogt P.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), this scenario would have important implications for the role of GlyR activation in neurons. To further test this hypothesis we activated GlyR by increasing concentrations of glycine in cultured spinal cord neurons for a short period of time, and we subsequently analyzed the phosphorylation level of rpS6 by immunoblot experiments with cell lysates and phospho-specific antibodies directed against phosphoserine 235/236 of rpS6. For GlyR activation we replaced the culture medium by a defined buffered salt solution and supplemented the solution with 2 mm glycine. Immunoblotting of cell lysates revealed that short term glycine application resulted in increased phosphorylation of serine 235/236 of rpS6 (Fig. 2a). Applying glycine for different time periods (ranging from 5 to 30 min) showed that increased phosphorylation of rpS6 was first observed within 5 min after glycine application and remained at an increased level even after prolonged activation times of 30 min. These effects were blocked by preincubation with strychnine, a competitive inhibitor of glycine binding at GlyRs (Fig. 2b). Cultured spinal cord neurons that were treated with glycine displayed significantly increased mean pixel intensities when probed with an antibody specific for phosphoserine 235/236 of rpS6 (p = 0.0001; two-tailed t test), whereas the mean pixel intensities using an antibody specific for gephyrin were not changed upon glycine treatment (Fig. 2c). The Phosphorylation of rpS6 Is Not Dependent on the PI 3-Kinase Phosphorylation Pathway—To get further insight into possible signaling pathways involved in the glycine-dependent phosphorylation of rpS6, we analyzed the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase at position Thr-389, which is known to increase p70 S6 kinase activity. Immunoblot analysis with a phospho-Thr-389-specific antibody revealed that the phosphorylation of Thr-389 was not altered upon glycine application, whereas the phosphorylation of rpS6 was increased significantly (p = 0.032; two-tailed t test) under the same conditions (Fig. 3, a and b). To further corroborate that the cellular pathway responsible for Thr-389 phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase is indeed not involved in glycine-dependent rpS6 phosphorylation, we applied wortmannin, an inhibitor for PI 3-kinase during glycine-stimulating experiments of cultured spinal cord neurons. As shown in Fig. 3c, the presence of wortmannin did not result in a reduction of phosphorylated rpS6, suggesting that PI 3-kinase, an upstream kinase of mTOR, is not involved in the glycine-dependent increase of rpS6 phosphorylation (Fig. 3c). It has been shown that the GlyR activation in young cultured spinal cord neurons results in depolarization rather than hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, which may induce opening of the L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and possibly resulting in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways (19Yoshida M. Fukuda S. Tozuka Y. Miyamoto Y. Hisatsune T. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 60: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine to analyze whether the glycine-induced increase of rpS6 phosphorylation might be dependent on L-type channel-mediated ion fluxes. However, as shown in Fig. 3d, nifedipine did not inhibit the glycine-mediated increase of rpS6 phosphorylation, indicating that a yet unknown signaling pathway is involved in glycine-dependent rpS6 phosphorylation. Taken together, our results indicate that the PI 3-kinase-mTOR pathway, known to mediate NMDA receptor-dependent signaling in the hippocampus, is not responsible for GlyR-dependent cellular signaling at young stages of spinal cord neurons differentiating in vitro. The MAPKs ERK1/2 are other candidate protein kinases that could be involved in rpS6 phosphorylation (20Hong-Brown L.Q. Brown C.R. Lang C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: 482-492Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reinvestigated whether ERK1/2 might also be detected as a binding protein of GlyR α2 large cytoplasmic loop by performing additional pulldown experiments using rat brain extracts. Immunoblot analysis of eluates from GST-α2 loop pulldown experiments in comparison with pulldown experiments using GST and GST-gephyrin as baits revealed that indeed ERK1/2 was present even under stringent washing conditions and could be eluted by glutathione together with the GST-α2 loop fusion protein (Fig. 4a). To test the putative involvement of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in regulating glycine-dependent rpS6 phosphorylation, we stimulated cultured neurons with glycine and analyzed cell lysates using a phospho-specific antibody against MAPKs ERK1/2. These experiments revealed no significant (p = 0.08; two tailed t test) increase of MAPK activation upon glycine application (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, preincubation of cells with MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitors (U0126 and PD23635) did not reduce the glycine-induced increase of rpS6 phosphorylation (data not shown). These findings suggest that ERK1/2 signaling may not be involved in regulating GlyR-dependent rpS6 phosphorylation. Subcellular Localization of rpS6 in Cultured Spinal Cord and Hippocampal Neurons—The finding that rpS6 can bind to the large cytoplasmic loop GlyR α2 subunit and that glycine-mediated activation of GlyRs in cultured spinal cord neurons resulted in increased phosphorylation of rpS6 led us to study the subcellular distributions in cultured spinal cord and hippocampal neurons by immunofluorescence microscopy. After about 1 week (DIV6), phospho-rpS6-specific immunoreactivity was found within the soma and at low levels within proximal dendrites of cultured spinal cord neurons (Fig. 5a). At later stages of differentiation (DIV21), phospho-rpS6 immunoreactivity within dendrites increased (Fig. 5b). In cultured hippocampal neurons"
