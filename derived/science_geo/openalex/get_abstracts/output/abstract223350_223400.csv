https://openalex.org/W2158517439,"We report on the coupling between ferroelectric and magnetic order parameters in a nanostructured BaTiO3-CoFe2O4 ferroelectromagnet. This facilitates the interconversion of energies stored in electric and magnetic fields and plays an important role in many devices, including transducers, field sensors, etc. Such nanostructures were deposited on single-crystal SrTiO3 (001) substrates by pulsed laser deposition from a single Ba-Ti-Co-Fe-oxide target. The films are epitaxial in-plane as well as out-of-plane with self-assembled hexagonal arrays of CoFe2O4 nanopillars embedded in a BaTiO3 matrix. The CoFe2O4 nanopillars have uniform size and average spacing of 20 to 30 nanometers. Temperature-dependent magnetic measurements illustrate the coupling between the two order parameters, which is manifested as a change in magnetization at the ferroelectric Curie temperature. Thermodynamic analyses show that the magnetoelectric coupling in such a nanostructure can be understood on the basis of the strong elastic interactions between the two phases."
https://openalex.org/W96734778,"Sixty-one SARS coronavirus genomic sequences derived from the early, middle, and late phases of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic were analyzed together with two viral sequences from palm civets. Genotypes characteristic of each phase were discovered, and the earliest genotypes were similar to the animal SARS-like coronaviruses. Major deletions were observed in the Orf8 region of the genome, both at the start and the end of the epidemic. The neutral mutation rate of the viral genome was constant but the amino acid substitution rate of the coding sequences slowed during the course of the epidemic. The spike protein showed the strongest initial responses to positive selection pressures, followed by subsequent purifying selection and eventual stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2146865647,"Genes normally resident in euchromatic domains are silenced when packaged into heterochromatin, as exemplified in Drosophila melanogaster by position effect variegation (PEV). Loss-of-function mutations resulting in suppression of PEV have identified critical components of heterochromatin, including proteins HP1, HP2, and histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase. Here, we demonstrate that this silencing is dependent on the RNA interference machinery, using tandem mini-white arrays and white transgenes in heterochromatin to show loss of silencing as a result of mutations in piwi, aubergine, or spindle-E (homeless), which encode RNAi components. These mutations result in reduction of H3 Lys9 methylation and delocalization of HP1 and HP2, most dramatically in spindle-E mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2171756746,"It is generally accepted that paternally imprinted X inactivation occurs exclusively in extraembryonic lineages of mouse embryos, whereas cells of the embryo proper, derived from the inner cell mass (ICM), undergo only random X inactivation. Here we show that imprinted X inactivation, in fact, occurs in all cells of early embryos and that the paternal X is then selectively reactivated in cells allocated to the ICM. This contrasts with more differentiated cell types where X inactivation is highly stable and generally irreversible. Our observations illustrate that an important component of genome plasticity in early development is the capacity to reverse heritable gene silencing decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2167257433,"Over residues 15–36, which comprise the H-bonded core of the amyloid fibrils it forms, the Alzheimer's disease plaque peptide amyloid β (Aβ) possesses a very similar sequence to that of another short, amyloidogenic peptide, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). Using elongation rates to quantify seeding efficiency, we inquired into the relationship between primary sequence similarity and seeding efficiency between Aβ-(1–40) and amyloid fibrils produced from IAPP as well as other proteins. In both a solution phase and a microtiter plate elongation assay, IAPP fibrils are poor seeds for Aβ-(1–40) elongation, exhibiting weight-normalized efficiencies of only 1–2% compared with Aβ-(1–40) fibrils. Amyloid fibrils of peptides with sequences completely unrelated to Aβ also exhibit poor to negligible seeding ability for Aβ elongation. Fibrils from a number of point mutants of Aβ-(1–40) exhibit intermediate seeding abilities for wild-type Aβ elongation, with differing efficiencies depending on whether or not the mutation is in the amyloid core region. The results suggest that amyloid fibrils from different proteins exhibit structural differences that control seeding efficiencies. Preliminary results also suggest that identical sequences can grow into different conformations of amyloid fibrils as detected by seeding efficiencies. The results have a number of implications for amyloid structure and biology.

Preliminary results also suggest that identical sequences can grow into different conformations of amyloid fibrils as detected by seeding efficiencies. The results have a number of implications for amyloid structure and biology. One of the major unanswered questions of amyloid fibril formation is the specificity with which primary sequence determines both amyloidogenicity and the details of amyloid structure. The observation that many globular proteins can be induced to generate amyloid 1Amyloid fibrils are classically defined as originating in tissue-associated deposits that yield bright green birefringence under the polarizing light microscope after Congo red staining. We refer here to in vitro generated fibrils as amyloid, cognizant that they may not resemble tissue-derived amyloid fibrils in all structural and functional respects (see “Discussion”). fibrils, albeit in some cases only under non-native conditions, has led to the notion that the amyloid folding motif is a kind of default structure in the protein folding pathway that many or all polypeptides can engage when their normal folding pathways are compromised (1Fandrich M. Fletcher M.A. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 2Dobson C.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2001; 68: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This seems a reasonable hypothesis, especially if the dominant driving force for amyloid formation is the formation of the backbone H-bonding network of these β-sheet-rich structures (3Fandrich M. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5682-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), since all polypeptides regardless of sequence share the polypeptide backbone. Amyloid stability, however, appears to be derived from a combination of forces, including but not limited to H-bonding, much in the manner of how globular proteins are stabilized (4Williams A. Portelius E. Kheterpal I. Guo J. Cook K. Xu Y. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations associated with modest changes in side chain hydrophobicity, charge, etc., have been observed to have significant impact on fibril growth kinetics and stability (5Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B. Reed J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 460-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 6Wood S.J. Wetzel R. Martin J.D. Hurle M.R.

These considerations raise an interesting conundrum; if side chain packing contributes significantly to amyloid stability, how is it possible that so many proteins whose sequences evolved to fold into stable, globular structures (including many that contain little or no β-sheet structure in the native state) can be equally well accommodated into the β-sheet-rich amyloid folding motif? Does amyloid fibril formation follow the same or different folding rules compared with other collapsed states of polypeptide sequences? One measure of packing specificity in the amyloid fibril is the efficiency with which fibrils composed of one protein sequence can act as seeds for the elongation of another amyloidogenic polypeptide. The ability of the folded structure at the growth point of the amyloid fibril to serve as a template for the recruitment of an incoming monomer can be likened to the abilities of domains and subdomains of globular proteins to pack together with high complementarity and specificity. Although such “cross-seeding” between two different amyloid proteins has been described (11Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12345-12352Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 12Han H. Weinreb P.H. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Chem.

Biol. 2000; 130: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), the data are often qualitative and/or difficult to assess quantitatively due to limitations in our understanding of the amyloid assembly mechanism. For example, it is well known that the addition of a fibril seed can eliminate or reduce the lag time in the spontaneous, nucleation-dependent generation of Aβ 2The abbreviations used are: Aβ, amyloid β protein; IAPP, islet amyloid polypeptide; ThT, thioflavin T; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBSA, PBS plus sodium azide; WT, wild type; AD, Alzheimer's disease; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. fibrils from rigorously disaggregated monomers (15Evans K.C. Berger E.P. Cho C.-G. Weisgraber K.H. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 16Wood S.J. Chan W. Wetzel R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12623-12628Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how to quantitatively interpret reductions in lag time or to compare one fibril to another with respect to their relative abilities as seeds to reduce lag times. Furthermore, some previous experimental explorations of seeding and cross-seeding may also have been compromised by the use of monomeric protein preparations that contained small but significant amounts of aggregate seeds. Cross-seeding ability is not only of interest in terms of the structural aspects of amyloid fibril formation. Although the mechanisms by which amyloid fibril formation is initiated in vivo are still being worked out, it is very likely that, once these initial seeds are formed, fibrils grow in vivo through elongation by monomer additions (17Esler W.P. Stimson E.R. Ghilardi J.R. Vinters H.V. Lee J.P. Mantyh P.W. Maggio J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The ability of amyloid fibrils to be efficiently elongated in vivo has impact on a number of biological aspects of amyloid function. These include the questions of species and strain specificity in yeast (18Chien P. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19DePace A.H. Weissman J.S.

Biol. 2001; 311: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and the ability of short poly-Gln sequences to influence the nucleation of long poly-Gln repeats 3A. M. Bhattacharyya and R. Wetzel, submitted for publication. in diseases such as Huntington's disease, the specificity of intracellular protein aggregation (24Rajan R.S. Illing M.E. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13060-13065Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and the better understanding of the mechanism of amyloid enhancement factor in the classic mouse amyloidosis model (25Lundmark K. Westermark G.T. Nystrom S. Murphy C.L. Solomon A. Westermark P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6979-6984Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Promiscuous cross-seeding among amyloid fibrils would suggest the possibility that one amyloid disease might influence another. For example, because the vast majority of type II diabetes patients have pancreatic amyloid deposits composed of islet amyloid polypeptide (26Westermark P. Wilander E. Diabetologia. 1978; 15: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and because IAPP and Aβ share striking sequence similarity (see “Results”), it might be possible that cross-seeding of Aβ amyloid formation by IAPP fibrils is the mechanism by which diabetics appear to exhibit an elevated risk for developing AD (27Ott A. Stolk R.P. van Harskamp F. Pols H.A. Hofman A. Breteler M.M. Neurology. 1999; 53: 1937-1942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test this latter hypothesis, we studied the abilities of Aβ and IAPP fibrils to act as seeds for the elongation reactions of Aβ and IAPP monomeric peptides. We used the pseudo-first order elongation kinetics in two separate assay modes as measures of relative seeding ability. To put these results into context we also surveyed a broad spectrum of amyloid fibrils as seeds for Aβ elongation. The results show that in general seeding of fibril elongation is highly specific, being exquisitely sensitive to point mutations at certain positions in the amyloidogenic peptide. IAPP fibrils prove to be very poor seeds for Aβ-(1–40) elongation, suggesting that heterologous seeding of amyloid formation probably does not influence AD risk in diabetics. Materials—Synthetic wild-type Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42), the “Arctic” mutant (E22G), some proline mutants, and a Cys-1 analog of Aβ-(1–40) were all obtained via custom syntheses from the Keck Biotechnology Center at Yale University. The 1–30 fragment of the immunoglobulin light chain Len and oxidized, full-length, C-terminal-amidated IAPP were also obtained from the Keck Center. Aβ-(1–40) proline mutants F4P, R6P, and L17P were obtained from the Stanford University Protein and Nucleic Acids Biotechnology Facility. Recombinant human immunoglobulin κ6 light chain variable domain (JTO5) was a gift of Dr. Jonathon Wall (University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine), and Aβ-(25–35) was a gift of Charles Murphy (University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine). Amyloid-like aggregates of synthetic Gln28 and Gln47 polyglutamine peptides (28Chen S. Berthelier V. Hamilton J.B. O'Nuallain B. Wetzel R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7391-7399Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) were obtained from Tina Richey (University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine). Amyloid fibrils of β2-microglobulin were gifts of Susan Jones and Sheena Radford (University of Leeds). Fibrils of the yeast prion protein Ure2p (29Taylor K.L. Cheng N. Williams R.W. Steven A.C. Wickner R.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) were gifts of Kimberley Taylor and Reed Wickner (National Institutes of Health). Bovine collagen and bovine serum albumin (essentially fatty acid free) were purchased from Sigma. N-terminal-biotinylated Aβ-(1–40) was prepared by alkylating a Cys-1 analog of Aβ-(1–40) (Keck Biotechnology Center custom synthesis) with PEO (polyethylene oxide)-iodoacetyl biotin (Pierce). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. General Methods—The concentrations of disaggregated peptides were estimated from peak areas of the A215 absorbance trace in analytical HPLC of aliquots of peptide solutions using standard curves generated from peptide standards calibrated by amino acid composition analysis, as described previously (30Kheterpal I. Williams A. Murphy C. Bledsoe B. Wetzel R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11757-11767Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Reverse phase HPLC was carried out on a ZORBAX SB-C3 column (Agilent Technologies) with a 1–51% (v/v) acetonitrile gradient in 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (Pierce). ThT fluorescence measurements (31LeVine H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar) of reaction samples were carried out by diluting aliquots of the reaction into PBS containing 10 μm ThT. Thioflavin T fluorescence was then monitored by excitation at 450 nm and fluorescence emission at 482 nm. Unless otherwise indicated, all quantitative experimental results shown are from measurements done in triplicate. Error bars in the figures represent S.D. Preparation of Soluble, Disaggregated Peptides, and Sonicated Fibril Seeds—Wild-type and mutant Aβ peptides were treated to remove aggregates as described (30Kheterpal I. Williams A. Murphy C. Bledsoe B. Wetzel R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11757-11767Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 32Kheterpal I. Zhou S. Cook K.D. Wetzel R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13597-13601Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, synthetic lyophilized powder was exposed to sequential applications of trifluoroacetic acid and hexafluoroisopropanol and evaporated under an argon stream, trace volatile solvents were removed under high vacuum, and the peptide residue was dissolved in 2 mm NaOH followed immediately with the addition of a 10× PBS buffer to generate 1× PBS plus 0.05% sodium azide (PBSA). To remove any residual aggregates these solutions were centrifuged (51,500 × g, 17 h, 4 °C), and the upper [¾] of the supernatant was carefully removed and analyzed for Aβ concentration by HPLC as described above (generally about 60 μm). Solutions were used immediately to conduct kinetics experiments (described below) or to make fibrils. Fibrils were made by spontaneous fibril assembly from disaggregated monomeric peptide as described previously (33O'Nuallain B. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). For some less stable proline mutants of Aβ-(1–40), fibril formation reactions were conducted at higher concentrations of monomeric peptide (4Williams A. Portelius E. Kheterpal I. Guo J. Cook K. Xu Y. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Fibril formation reactions were monitored by ThT fluorescence and by analysis of centrifugation supernatants by HPLC. Human IAPP was solubilized and disaggregated using a 1:1 mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/hexafluoroisopropanol (34Chen S. Wetzel R. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) as previously described (33O'Nuallain B. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Disaggregated IAPP (about 30 μm) was used immediately in elongation kinetics assays (described below) or to make fibrils as described previously (33O'Nuallain B. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). JTO5 fibrils were prepared as previously described (35Wall J. Schell M. Murphy C. Hrncic R. Stevens F.J. Solomon A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14101-14108Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Preparation of reduced and alkylated ovalbumin (ovalbumin-RA) was described previously (33O'Nuallain B. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To improve seeding potency (11Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12345-12352Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and potentially normalize fibril size all aggregates were sonicated with a probe sonicator on ice for 2.5 min in 30-s bursts in PBSA containing 1 mm dithiothreitol (a precaution against oxidation; however, we have no evidence that oxidation occurs during sonication in the absence of dithiothreitol). The fact that the series of mutated Aβ fibrils yields results consistent with what is known about Aβ fibril structure (see “Results” and “Discussion”) suggests that the sonication step does produce fibrils with very similar average molecular weights, which can therefore be assumed to have approximately the same number of growth sites per weight of fibril. Recent experimental titration of fibril growth sites further supports this assumption. 4S. Shivaprasad, B. O'Nuallain, and R. Wetzel, unpublished data. Initial IAPP aggregates from spontaneous aggregation experiments consist mainly of spheroidal aggregates and smaller amounts of amyloid fibrils and amorphous material (see “Results”). Except for collagen and reduced and alkylated ovalbumin, other aggregates prepared for use as seeds exhibited typical amyloid fibril structure in electron micrographs as well as typical ThT responses (data not shown). Solution Phase Aggregation Assays—Aggregation kinetics studies were conducted using relatively high concentrations of peptide using modifications of the procedure described by Naiki and Nakakuki (36Naiki H. Nakakuki K. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 374-383PubMed Google Scholar) and Naiki and Gejyo (37Naiki H. Gejyo F. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). A typical solution phase assay was carried out by incubating (unshaken) a solution of ∼30 μm concentrations of freshly disaggregated Aβ or IAPP in PBSA in a water bath at 37 °C. For seeded reactions, solutions were preincubated to reach temperature, then seeded with 10–70 μg/ml aggregate at time 0. Reactions were followed by removing aliquots of gently mixed suspensions and measuring ThT fluorescence. For each time point, an aliquot was removed from each of three independent samples and diluted into PBSA containing ThT. Because the ThT signal varies linearly with fibril mass for any given amyloid fibril, the signal can be used as a measure of the completeness of the fibril formation reaction and, when appropriately plotted, will yield values for the pseudo-first order rate constant (37Naiki H. Gejyo F. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Solid Phase, Microtiter Plate-based Aggregation Assays—Progress curves for polypeptide aggregation were also determined using a solid phase microtiter plate assay modified from previously described methods (38Esler W.P. Stimson E.R. Ghilardi J.R. Felix A.M. Lu Y.A. Vinters H.V. Mantyh P.W. Maggio J.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 39Berthelier V. Wetzel R. Potter N.T. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2003: 295-303Google Scholar). N-terminal-biotinylated Aβ-(1–40) (see “General Methods” under “Experimental Procedures”) was disaggregated, dissolved at a low micromolar concentration in PBS buffer, separated into aliquots, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Sonicated fibrils or other aggregates were applied to the microplate wells by incubating 100 μl/well of a 1 μg/ml suspension of aggregate (i.e. 100 ng of aggregate/well) in PBSA for 18 h at 37 °C in activated high binding microtiter plates (EIA/RIA Plates, Costar, Atlanta, GA). The wells were then washed twice with PBSA containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Fisher) (assay buffer). This is the standard washing procedure carried out throughout this experiment. To ensure that aggregation rates are not significantly affected by variable efficiencies of aggregate adhesion to the plastic, we confirmed good immobilization by recovering unbound protein from the wells as part of the wash protocol and estimating the amount of non-absorbed protein using a protein assay (33O'Nuallain B. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In all cases more than 95% of the aggregate remained on the plastic. Wells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBSA (blocking buffer) for 1 h at 37 °C, then 100 μl of assay buffer was added into each well, and the plate was sealed with an adhesive overlay. For the assay, the microtiter plate was pre-equilibrated at 37 °C. The kinetics data were collected by determining individual time points in reverse temporal order. For each replicate series of each analysis on the plate, a 100-μl aliquot of a 25 nm solution of biotinyl-Aβ in assay buffer was added to a well by first removing the assay buffer in which the well was stored. This constitutes the longest time point of the kinetics run. The plate was resealed and returned to 37 °C incubation. At the appropriate time, the plate was again removed, and the storage buffer was removed from the wells designated for this time point and replaced with fresh aliquots of biotinyl-Aβ solution. This process was repeated until the last incubation, constituting the earliest time point, was completed. After the last incremental incubation for the kinetics the plate was removed from 37 °C incubation and washed with assay buffer, 100 μl was added per well of a 1:1000 dilution of a europium-streptavidin conjugate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in blocking buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The plate was then washed 3 times, and europium was released from the microplate well surface using 100 μl/well of chelation buffer (Enhancement Solution, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After 10 min europium was measured by time-resolved fluorometry (40Diamandis E.P. Clin. Biochem. 1988; 21: 139-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a Victor2 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the programmed parameters for europium. fmol of europium were determined from a standard curve and converted to fmol of biotin using the stated europium content of the commercial streptavidin reagent. Congo Red Staining and Birefringence of IAPP Aggregates—Congo red staining of aggregates was carried out using a modified version (Sigma: procedure HT60) of the protocol of Puchtler et al. (41Puchtler H. Sweat F. Levine M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1962; 10: 355-364Crossref Google Scholar). For each experiment 20 μl of freshly prepared IAPP aggregates (about 0.2 mg/ml) was dried to a glass microscope slide overnight at 37 °C and then Congo red-stained. Birefringence was determined with an Olympus microscope (20×) equipped with a polarizing stage. Electron Micrographs—Aggregates (0.1–0.4 mg/ml) were adsorbed onto carbon and Formvar-coated copper grids and then negatively stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate. Stained samples were examined and photographed in a Hitachi H-800. Sequence Similarity between Aβ and IAPP—The Aβ peptide is derived from the proteolytic processing of the cross-membrane region of the receptor-like, type I cross-membrane protein amyloid-β protein precursor (42Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 489-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). IAPP, or amylin, is derived from the proteolytic processing of a propeptide and appears to play a role along with insulin in the regulation of glucose metabolism (43Gebre-Medhin S. Mulder H. Pekny M. Westermark G. Tornell J. Westermark P. Sundler F. Ahren B. Betsholtz C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Despite the absence of a larger sequence homology between their precursor proteins and no obvious relationship in known functions, the mature peptides Aβ and IAPP have very similar sequences, as shown in Fig. 1. After introduction of a 1-residue gap in Aβ to maximize the alignment, the 2 peptides overall share 25% sequence identity and 50% sequence similarity (Fig. 1). When the overlap region is confined to that portion of the Aβ sequence, residues 15–37, known to be involved in the H-bonded core region of the amyloid fibril (4Williams A. Portelius E. Kheterpal I.

Finally, when the amyloid core region of the WT Aβ sequence is compared with the sequence of the S20G (Aβ position 25) single point mutant of IAPP, associated with both early onset diabetes (45Sakagashira S.

Amyloid. 2001; 8: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the extents of identity and similarity climb further to 43 and 70%, respectively. This striking similarity introduces the questions of whether these two highly amyloidogenic peptides use their shared sequences in similar ways to engage the amyloid folding motif and the extent to which they might thereby exhibit specificity in amyloid formation as measured by their sensitivities to heterologous seeding. The hypothesis that the shared sequence element is involved in the core structure of amyloid fibrils from both peptides is supported by the sharp reduction in amyloid growth observed when proline residues are substituted within this region in both Aβ (4Williams A. Portelius E. Kheterpal I. Guo J. Cook K. Xu Y. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and IAPP (48Westermark P. Engstrom U. Johnson K.H.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1811-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Given these facts it is not unreasonable to suppose that a growing Aβ amyloid fibril might be able to relatively easily accommodate IAPP molecules into the fibril structure. It should be stressed that, although the sequence similarities discussed above are in a structural sense undeniable, we infer no significance to this similarity outside of the context of amyloid formation. That is, it is highly unlikely that these sequences share a common precursor in evolution, and there is no reason to believe that their common sequence elements are associated with any similarity in the normal function of these polypeptides. Growth of IAPP and Aβ Amyloid by Spontaneous, Nucleation-dependent Polymerization and by Homologous Seeding—The spontaneous, nucleation-dependent amyloid formation reaction by IAPP is complicated by the existence of two amyloid-related products. The first-formed product in the unseeded reaction consists of clusters of spheroidal bodies (Fig. 2A) that, despite their non-fibrillar morphologies, exhibit in our hands a number of other amyloid-like features. These include the ability to be labeled with the amyloid-selective (41Puchtler H. Sweat F. Levine M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1962; 10: 355-364Crossref Google Scholar, 50LeVine III, H.

Their structural relationship to the classic amyloid fibril is also suggested by their response to sonication, which generates from these globular aggregates clus"

We examined the role of PEST domain–enriched tyrosine phosphatase (PEP) in regulating T cell antigen–receptor function during thymocyte development and peripheral T cell differentiation. Although normal naïve T cell functions were retained in pep -deficient mice, effector/memory T cells demonstrated enhanced activation of Lck. In turn, this resulted in increased expansion and function of the effector/memory T cell pool, which was also associated with spontaneous development of germinal centers and elevated serum antibody levels.

Notably, in the absence of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), the disease-associated isoform, PrPSc, appears not to be intrinsically neurotoxic, suggesting that PrPC itself may participate directly in the prion neurodegenerative cascade. Here, cross-linking PrPC in vivo with specific monoclonal antibodies was found to trigger rapid and extensive apoptosis in hippocampal and cerebellar neurons. These findings suggest that PrPC functions in the control of neuronal survival and provides a model to explore whether cross-linking of PrPC by oligomeric PrPSc can promote neuronal loss during prion infection."

Examination of the orientational dynamics points to a faster relaxation in the interfacial region. Furthermore, the average value of the dipole decreases and the average value of the highest occupied molecular orbital for each water molecule increases approaching the liquid-vapor interface.

We identified factors required to establish this specialized cell cycle by examining meiotic chromosome segregation in a collection of yeast strains lacking all nonessential genes. This analysis revealed Sgo1, Chl4, and Iml3 to be important for retaining centromeric cohesin until the onset of anaphase II. Consistent with this role, Sgo1 localizes to centromeric regions but dissociates at the onset of anaphase II. The screen described here provides a comprehensive analysis of the genes required for the meiotic cell cycle and identifies three factors important for the stepwise loss of sister chromatid cohesion."

Here, we provide evidence that the inductive signal is spatially graded and initially activates the EGFR-MAPK pathway in the prospective 2 degrees cells. Subsequently, this effect is counteracted by the expression of multiple new negative regulators of the EGFR-MAPK pathway, under direct transcriptional control of the LIN-12-mediated lateral signal."

https://openalex.org/W2005047484,"Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53) has been identified as an SH3 domain-containing adaptor that links Rac1 with a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family verprolin-homologous protein 2 (WAVE2) to induce lamellipodia or Cdc42 with Mena to induce filopodia. The recruitment of these SH3-binding partners by IRSp53 is thought to be crucial for F-actin rearrangements. Here, we show that the N-terminal predicted helical stretch of 250 amino acids of IRSp53 is an evolutionarily conserved F-actin bundling domain involved in filopodium formation. Five proteins including IRSp53 and missing in metastasis (MIM) protein share this unique domain and are highly conserved in vertebrates. We named the conserved domain IRSp53/MIM homology domain (IMD). The IMD has domain relatives in invertebrates but does not show obvious homology to any known actin interacting proteins. The IMD alone, derived from either IRSp53 or MIM, induced filopodia in HeLa cells and the formation of tightly packed parallel F-actin bundles in vitro. These results suggest that IRSp53 and MIM belong to a novel actin bundling protein family. Furthermore, we found that filopodium-inducing IMD activity in the full-length IRSp53 was regulated by active Cdc42 and Rac1. The SH3 domain was not necessary for IMD-induced filopodium formation. Our results indicate that IRSp53, when activated by small GTPases, participates in F-actin reorganization not only in an SH3-dependent manner but also in a manner dependent on the activity of the IMD.

However, the N-terminal half of IRSp53 lacking the SH3 domain was reported to induce neurite outgrowth in a neuroblastoma cell line (6Govind S. Kozma R. Monfries C. Lim L. Ahmed S. J.

Recently, a novel monomeric actin-binding protein, missing in metastasis protein (MIM), containing a WASP homology 2 (WH2) domain in the C terminus, was reported in human and mouse (11Lee Y.G.

J. 2003; 371: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We found that the N-terminal domains of MIM and IRSp53 also share other characteristic features; the predicted secondary structures are almost purely helical (see Ref. 9Alvarez C.E. Sutcliffe J.G. Thomas E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24728-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar for IRSp53), and the estimated isoelectric points are around 9. MIM induces actin cytoskeleton reorganization in cultured cells. This activity is not dependent on the C-terminal half (13Woodings J.A. Sharp S.J. Machesky L.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), suggesting that the N-terminal half containing the IRSp53 homologous domain plays a key role in actin reorganization. Here we show that IRSp53 and MIM belong to an evolutionarily related protein family sharing a well conserved N-terminal helical domain (IRSp53/MIM homology domain (IMD)) as a key constituent. We investigated the role of the IMD in actin reorganization. Our results indicate that the IMDs of IRSp53 and MIM induce filopodia in cultured cells and form tightly packed F-actin bundles in vitro. The filopodium forming activity of the IMD in full-length IRSp53 is regulated by small GTPases. Thus, upon association with active Rac1 or Cdc42, IRSp53 can induce actin cytoskeleton reorganization by dual mechanisms: the SH3-mediated recruitment of F-actin regulators and the action of the novel actin bundling domain in the N terminus. Both mechanisms may work synergistically or additively in controlling cortical actin dynamics. Data Base Search—Proteins homologous to IRSp53 and MIM were identified in the GenBank™ data base using BLAST on the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site and on the GenomeNet web site. The details of sequences thus retrieved are described in the supplemental data. The Clustalw engine at the GenomeNet Web site was used to align amino acid sequences and to construct phylogenetic trees. The secondary structures of proteins were predicted by 3D-PSSM (14Kelley L.A.

The DNA fragments encoding IRSp53 where Arg was substituted for Trp413 or Ala for both Phe427 and Pro428 in the SH3 domain, hereafter referred to as IRSp53-W/R or IRSp53-FP/AA, were amplified by PCR and ligated into pEGFP-C1. cDNA of Rac1V12, Rac1N17, Cdc42V12, or Cdc42N17 was subcloned into pIRM21, an expression vector expressing FLAG-tagged protein and internal ribosomal entry site-driven dsFP593 (16Nagashima K.

A cDNA clone encoding the N-terminal fragment (aa 1-430) of human MIM was obtained by PCR from a human brain cDNA library (Clontech). The cDNA encoding C-terminal MIM (aa 400-755, KIAA0429) was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute. The full-length MIM cDNA was amplified through overlap PCR using these N- and C-terminal cDNAs as templates. The cDNAs encoding the full-length human MIM (aa 1-755), MIM-IMD (aa 1-250), and MIM-ΔIMD (aa 251-755) were inserted into pEGFP-C1, pCXN2-FLAG, and pGEX-4T3 or 6P3 vectors. Cells and Transfection—HeLa cells and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and2mml-glutamine. HeLa cells and 293T cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Antibodies and Immunofluorescence Analysis—Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin and Alexa546-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); anti-FLAG M2 antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich. HeLa cells transfected with the plasmids indicated in the figures and cultured for 15-18 h were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells transfected with plasmids expressing GFP-tagged proteins were counterstained with rhodamine-phalloidin. The cells transfected with both GFP-tagged protein-expressing vectors and FLAG-tagged small GTPase-expressing vectors were immunostained with anti-FLAG M2 antibody followed by an Alexa546-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Fluorescence images were obtained using a confocal microscope (BX50WI, Fluoview, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a water immersion objective lens (LUMPlanFl 60×, 0.90 W). To show the entire cell morphology in detail, all of the cell images shown were extended focus images reconstructed from a series of optical sections taken at 0.2-0.3-μm intervals. F-actin Binding and Bundling Assays—F-actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle as described (17Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of various fragments of IRSp53 and MIM (see Fig. 1B) were expressed in BL21-Star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen), purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and then buffer-exchanged into F buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.1% C12E8 (Nikko Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). For binding assays, purified GST-fused fragments were clarified by centrifugation at 400,000 × g for 15 min to remove any aggregates, mixed with F-actin in the F buffer, and incubated for 30 min on ice. The final concentration of the GST fusions and F-actin were 1.2 and 5 μm (as for G-actin), respectively. The mixture was then centrifuged as above, and equal aliquots of the supernatant and the pellet were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. For quantitative analysis of F-actin binding and bundling, the IMDs were cleaved out from the GST fusions expressed by pGEX-6P3 vectors using PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences) and further purified by cation exchange chromatography (Resource S; Amersham Biosciences). To quantify F-actin binding, increasing amounts of F-actin were incubated with 2 μm IRSp53-IMD or MIM-IMD in the F buffer for 3 h at room temperature. The samples were then centrifuged and analyzed as above. The protein bands were quantified by densitometry (Personal Densitometer SI; Amersham Biosciences). For quantitative bundling assay, increasing amounts of the IMDs were incubated with 1 μm F-actin in the F buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The supernatant and the pellet were separated by low speed centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 min) and analyzed as above. Observation of Actin Bundles—For fluorescence microscope observation, a fixed concentration of F-actin (final concentration, 1.2 μm) was mixed with variable concentrations of the GST-fused fragments (0.24 to 12 μm). After incubation for 30 min on ice in F buffer, F-actin was stained with rhodamine-phalloidin for 15 min on ice. The mixtures were applied to poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The adherent material was washed with F buffer and observed with the confocal laser scanning microscope using an oil immersion objective lens (PlanApo 60×, 1.40 oil). For negative staining of actin filaments and bundles, the rhodamine-phalloidin-stained specimens described above were diluted 10 times with F buffer, placed onto a carbon-coated mesh, and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. For observation of thin sectioned specimens, actin bundles formed after incubation for 1 h on ice were packed by centrifugation and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and then sequentially incubated with 0.1% aqueous tannic acid and 0.2% uranyl acetate (18Svitkina T.M. Bulanova E.A. Chaga O.Y. Vignjevic D.M. Kojima S. Vasiliev J.M. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), postfixed in 0.5% aqueous OsO4, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon 812. Thin sections stained by lead citrate were examined with a CM 120 electron microscope (Philips Electronics, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) equipped with a multiscan cooled charge-coupled device camera (model 791; Gatan, Pleasanton, CA). Cross-linking of Proteins—One μm of purified IRSp53-IMD, MIM-IMD, and chymotrypsinogen A (Amersham Biosciences) as the control were cross-linked in 0.1 m 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid, pH 5.0, at room temperature. The reaction was started by the addition of 4 mm 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and was stopped by the addition of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at the time points indicated in Fig. 7A. Immunoprecipitation—293T cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, containing protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Applied Science). The lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min, followed by immunoprecipitation with a rabbit anti-GFP antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies as indicated in Fig. 7B. The proteins reacting with primary antibodies were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) for detecting peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and analyzed with an LAS-1000 system (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The N-terminal Helical Domain Is Evolutionarily Conserved in IRSp53 Family Proteins and MIM Family Proteins—IRSp53 and MIM share the N-terminal stretch of 250 amino acids (22% identical, 18% similar), whereas the remaining parts of the molecules show only marginal similarity. To explore whether this similarity is based on real homology, we searched the GenBank™ data base for proteins having similar sequences. First we found three more genes encoding homologous N-terminal sequences in the human genome: insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (IRTKS), the hypothetical gene FLJ22582, and ABBA-1 (Fig. 1A; see the supplemental table for details). IRTKS and FLJ22582 are IRSp53-related proteins containing an SH3 domain in the C-terminal half. However, both of them lack the half-CRIB motif found in IRSp53, and FLJ22582 further lacks the WWB (PPPXY) (Fig. 1B). ABBA-1 (GenBank™ accession number AB115770) is a MIM-related protein that possesses a WH2 domain in the C terminus. Further data base searches have shown that each of these five proteins has a putative ortholog in chicken and zebra fish, indicating that they are well conserved through vertebrate evolution (Supplemental Figs. 1-4). As pointed out previously (9Alvarez C.E. Sutcliffe J.G. Thomas E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24728-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Woodings J.A. Sharp S.J. Machesky L.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), related proteins are also found in invertebrates (Caenorhabditis elegans M04F3.5 protein and Drosophila melanogaster CG32082 protein). In an amino acid sequence alignment of the N-terminal region of these proteins (Fig. 1A), clusters of basic amino acids, proline, glycine, and clusters of hydrophobic amino acids are well conserved. There is a signature sequence of ALXEE(R/K)(R/G)RFCX0-1F(I/L) in the C-terminal half of the stretch. As expected from the number of basic amino acid clusters in this domain, the estimated isoelectric points are highly basic, ranging from 8.5 for human MIM to 9.2 for human FLJ22582. The identity of the N-terminal domain is further supported by predicted secondary structures. The domains are almost purely helical, 82-87% for the IRSp53-related proteins, 96-100% for MIM-related proteins, and intermediate contents of 89 and 87% for M04F3.5 and CG32082, respectively. Helix-breaking amino acid residues at the four breaking sites of the IRSp53-related proteins are also conserved in MIM/ABBA family proteins (asterisks in Fig. 1A). Thus, all of these proteins appear to have a common segmentation pattern of helices, helix I-V (Fig. 1A). Although human IRSp53 lacks helix V, it is predicted to be present in the chicken ortholog. A phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1C) based on the alignment of the IMDs shows that the vertebrate IRSp53/MIM family is divided into two major groups: the IRSp53 subfamily and the MIM/ABBA subfamily. The putative invertebrate homologs are positioned between them. The tree of the IMDs exactly reflects the hierarchy of domain composition of these proteins. The IRSp53 subfamily members contain an SH3 domain, and the MIM/ABBA subfamily proteins contain a WH2 domain. The vertebrate SH3-containing subfamily is further divided into three groups according to the presence or absence of the WWB and the half-CRIB motif. These data suggest that the IRSp53/MIM family originated from a common ancestor and diverged through evolution. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that IRTKS and FLJ22582 but not M04F3.5 or CG32082 share highly homologous C termini with the MIM/ABBA subfamily members (supplemental Fig. 6). Our analyses suggest the presence of an evolutionarily conserved IRSp53/MIM family and that the IMDs are the key components for the functional roles of proteins belonging to this family. The IMDs of IRSp53 and MIM Induce Filopodia in HeLa Cells—To explore the functional roles of the IMD, we first examined the morphological effects of ectopic expression of the IRSp53-IMD and the MIM-IMD in HeLa cells. The cells expressing the GFP-tagged IMD of IRSp53 formed numerous long filopodia that were F-actin-rich as demonstrated by rhodamine-phalloidin staining (Fig. 2, panels a, a′, b, and b′). The MIM-IMD also induced filopodia, but they were reduced in length (Fig. 2, panels c, c′, d, and d′). In addition, MIM-IMD promoted the formation of microvillus-like protrusions on the apical cell surface. IRSp53-IMD and MIM-IMD localized to and occasionally were concentrated in these protrusions (arrows in Fig. 2, panels c′ and d′). Both IMDs appeared not to be associated with stress fibers. There were no obvious signs of enhanced lamellipodial activity or disruption of stress fibers in these IMD-expressing cells. GFP used as a negative control did not induce any morphological changes (Fig. 2, panels e and f). Truncated fragments of IMD, IRSp53-N-IMD (aa 1-161), and IRSp53-C-IMD (aa 105-250) could not stimulate filopodium-formation (data not shown). These data indicate that both IMDs are capable of inducing filopodia in cells. Because IRSp53 and MIM represent the most divergent members of the vertebrate IRSp53/MIM protein family (Fig. 1C), the filopodium inducing activity of the IMD is likely to be conserved in all family members. IMD Does Not Act Upstream of Rac1 or Cdc42 for Filopodium Formation—Actin cytoskeletal reorganization is often a hallmark of Rho family GTPases. Previous reports have shown that Rac1 binds to the N terminus of IRSp53 (8Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and Cdc42 binds to the aa 202-305 fragment containing the half-CRIB motif (6Govind S. Kozma R. Monfries C. Lim L. Ahmed S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether Cdc42 or Rac1 activation was involved in IMD-induced filopodium formation. The formation of numerous filopodia induced by IRSp53-IMD was not perturbed by the co-expression of dominant negative Cdc42 or Rac1 (Fig. 3). There was no quantitative difference in the ratio of filopodium forming cells among HeLa cells transfected with IRSp53-IMD alone, those transfected with IRSp53-IMD and Cdc42N17, and those transfected with IRSp53 and Rac1N17 (Fig. 3, panel d), suggesting that the IMD itself is not regulated by these small GTPases. This result also excludes the possibility that the domain functions upstream of these small GTPases. The Filopodium-inducing IMD Activity of Wild-type IRSp53 Is Regulated by Cdc42 and Rac1—The common mechanism of effecter activation by Rho family GTPases appears to be dependent on the disruption of intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions. Cdc42-induced conformational changes have also been demonstrated for the molecule containing a half or semi-CRIB motif, Par6 (19Garrard S.M. Capaldo C.T. Gao L. Rosen M.K. Macara I.G. Tomchick D.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). First we found that GFP-tagged IRSp53-WT or GFP-tagged IRSp53-ΔSH3, when expressed in moderate levels, could not induce filopodia (Fig. 4A, panels a-c). As reported earlier (7Krugmann S. Jordens I. Gevaert K. Driessens M. Vandekerckhove J. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1645-1655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 10Nakagawa H. Miki H. Nozumi M. Takenawa T. Miyamoto S. Wehland J. Small J.V. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2577-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), cells expressing very high amounts of IRSp53 often formed dendritic extensions accompanied with severe retraction of the cell body. As noted in the legend to Fig. 2, these cells were omitted from our analyses. Next, we examined whether the IMD function was regulated by Cdc42 and Rac1 in IRSp53-WT and in IRSp53-ΔSH3 containing the half-CRIB motif. Co-expression of the active Cdc42 with these IRSp53 constructs led to massive formation of wavy filopodia (IRSp53+Cdc42 phenotype as shown in Fig. 4A, panels d and e) that was clearly distinguishable from straight filopodia induced in cells co-expressing GFP and active Cdc42 (Cdc42 phenotype as shown in Fig. 4A, panel f). A similar level of filopodium induction mixed with Rac1-dependent enhanced lamellipodia activity (Fig. 4A, panel i) was induced by the co-expression of active Rac1 (Fig. 4A, panels g and h). These results suggest that the SH3 domain is not necessary for IMD-dependent filopodium formation. Our results also suggest that the filopodium-inducing IMD activity in wild-type IRSp53 is regulated by Cdc42 and Rac1. The central region of IRSp53 containing the half-CRIB motif appears to be essential for this regulation, as previously suggested for the regulation of the SH3 domain (7Krugmann S. Jordens I. Gevaert K. Driessens M. Vandekerckhove J. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1645-1655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 9Alvarez C.E. Sutcliffe J.G. Thomas E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24728-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To further confirm that the IMD-induced filopodium formation is independent of SH3-binding molecules, we used two nonfunctional SH3 mutants, IRSp53-W/R and IRSp53-FP/AA (7Krugmann S. Jordens I. Gevaert K. Driessens M. Vandekerckhove J. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1645-1655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Both mutants could induce filopodia when expressed with active Cdc42 (Fig. 4B). Although active Cdc42 alone induced filopodium formation in the majority of cells (Fig. 4B, panel d, the blank segment in the stacked bar graph reflecting the Cdc42 phenotype), exaggerated filopodium formation, an indication of IMD activity, occurred only when Cdc42 was co-expressed with IRSp53-WT and IRSp53-SH3 mutants (Fig. 4B, panel d, the filled segment in the stacked bar graph reflecting the IRSp53+Cdc42 phenotype). Thus, IRSp53 can promote filopodium formation independently of SH3-mediated intermolecular interactions. In Vitro F-actin Bundling Activity of IMD—The filopodium promoting activity of the IMDs of IRSp53 and MIM in cultured cells led us to examine whether these IMDs have F-actin binding and bundling activity. We examined F-actin binding/bundling activity of the GST-fused IMD and other fragments and also tag-free purified IMDs in vitro. As shown in Fig. 5A, GST-fused IRSp53-IMD, IRSp53-ΔSH3, and MIM-IMD but not GST were co-sedimented with F-actin in a high speed assay (total binding). To exclude the possible contribution of GST-tag or contaminating bacterial proteins to F-actin binding and bundling, the activities of purified tag-free IMDs (Fig. 5B, left panel) were examined. In the high speed assays, the IMDs of IRSp53 and MIM bound to F-actin in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner (Fig. 5B, right panel). The apparent half-maximum concentrations of F-actin for IMD binding were almost the same (0.5 μm), irrespective of the variation between the maximum extents of these IMDs, suggesting that both IMDs have roughly the same affinity to F-actin. Low levels of the maximum extent of bound IMDs, about 30% for IRSp53-IMD and 20% for MIM-IMD, can be explained by improper protein folding of the bacterially made IMDs or their denaturation during the purification process. The GST fusions capable of F-actin binding induced thick F-actin bundles (Fig. 5C). Although GFP-tagged IRSp53-ΔSH3 required activation by Rac1 or Cdc42 for filopodium formation, GST-fused IRSp53-ΔSH3 alone could induce F-actin bundling. It is possible that the bacterially made protein may not be folded properly to form the self-inhibitory conformation. IRSp53-ΔSH3 showed stronger bundling than IRSp53-IMD or MIM-IMD; however, different levels of bundling activity among these proteins may simply reflect differences in stability of these fusio"
https://openalex.org/W2063924357,"We have used density functional methods to calculate fully relaxed potential energy curves of the seven lowest electronic states during the binding of O2 to a realistic model of ferrous deoxyheme. Beyond a Fe–O distance of ∼2.5 Å, we find a broad crossing region with five electronic states within 15 kJ/mol. The almost parallel surfaces strongly facilitate spin inversion, which is necessary in the reaction of O2 with heme (deoxyheme is a quintet and O2 a triplet, whereas oxyheme is a singlet). Thus, despite a small spin-orbit coupling in heme, the transition probability approaches unity. Using reasonable parameters, we estimate a transition probability of 0.06–1, which is at least 15 times larger than for the nonbiological Fe–O+ system. Spin crossing is anticipated between the singlet ground state of bound oxyheme, the triplet and septet dissociation states, and a quintet intermediate state. The fact that the quintet state is close in energy to the dissociation couple is of biological importance, because it explains how both spin states of O2 may bind to heme, thereby increasing the overall efficiency of oxygen binding. The activation barrier is estimated to be <15 kJ/mol based on our results and Mössbauer experiments. Our results indicate that both the activation energy and the spin-transition probability are tuned by the porphyrin as well as by the choice of the proximal heme ligand, which is a histidine in the globins. Together, they may accelerate O2 binding to iron by ∼1011 compared with the Fe–O+ system. A similar near degeneracy between spin states is observed in a ferric deoxyheme model with the histidine ligand hydrogen bonded to a carboxylate group, i.e. a model of heme peroxidases, which bind H2O2 in this oxidation state.

A similar near degeneracy between spin states is observed in a ferric deoxyheme model with the histidine ligand hydrogen bonded to a carboxylate group, i.e. a model of heme peroxidases, which bind H2O2 in this oxidation state. All electrons have a spin, which is an intrinsic quantum chemical property that can take only two possible values, normally called α and β (or spin up and down). Almost all normal organic molecules contain an even number of electrons and also an equal number of α and β electrons. They are then said to have paired spin or to be singlets. Molecular oxygen (O2) is a famous exception to this rule. In its ground state, it has two more electrons of one spin state than the other. Thus, it is said to have two unpaired electrons or to be a triplet. The singlet state of O2, with all electron spins paired, is ∼90 kJ/mol higher in energy than the triplet ground state (1Kaim W. Schwederski B. Bioinorganic Chemistry: Inorganic Elements in the Chemistry of Life. John Wiley & Sons, West Sussex, UK1994: 84Google Scholar). A chemical reaction can normally not change the spin state of an electron. Therefore, reactions between singlet and triplet states are formally spin-forbidden, which means that they are slow. This is the reason why organic matter may exist in an atmosphere containing much O2. There is a strong thermodynamic drive of O2 to oxidize organic matter to H2O and CO, but because these products (as well as the organic molecules) are singlets (whereas O2 is a triplet), this reaction is spin-forbidden and therefore very slow at ambient temperatures. On the other hand, this is a problem when living organisms want to employ O2 in their metabolism; the reactions are still spin-forbidden and slow. Nature has handled this problem by using transition metals to carry, activate, and reduce O2. There are many reasons for this choice. First, most transition metals also contain unpaired electrons, allowing reactions with triplet O2. Second, transition metals are relatively heavy atoms, which increases spin-orbit coupling (SOC), 1The abbreviations used are: SOC, spin-orbit coupling; DFT, density functional theory. 1The abbreviations used are: SOC, spin-orbit coupling; DFT, density functional theory. and thereby provide a quantum mechanical mechanism to change the spin state of an electron, called spin inversion. However, the SOC of the first-row transition metals is too small alone to allow for spin transitions. Third, transition metals often have several excited states with unpaired electrons close in energy to the ground state. This can also be used to enhance the probability of spin inversion. One of the most simple biological reactions involving molecular oxygen is the binding of O2 to hemoglobin, i.e. the binding of O2 to the Fe(II) ion in a heme group. This reaction is formally spin-forbidden, because the reactant deoxyheme contains four unpaired electrons in the 3d orbitals of iron (it is a quintet), and triplet O2 has two unpaired electrons. Thus, depending on the relative direction of these two sets of unpaired electrons, the adduct would be expected to have two (4 – 2) or six (4 + 2) unpaired electrons (i.e. a triplet or a septet state). However, experimentally, the product complex is a singlet state with an equal number of α and β electrons. As discussed already by Pauling and Coryell (2Pauling L. Coryell C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1936; 22: 210-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Pauling L. Nature. 1964; 203: 182-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), this problem makes the hemoglobin reactions troublesome to understand (4Kotani M. Rev. Mod. Phys. 1963; 35: 717-720Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and it is not clear how nature has coped with the spin-forbidden nature of this reaction. The importance of spin inversion is also reflected in the Perutz model of hemoglobin cooperativity (5Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Luisi B. Shaanan B. Liddington R.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1987; 20: 309-321Crossref Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 6Perutz M.F. Wilkinson A.J. Paoli M. Dodson G.G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 7Scheidt R.W. Reed C.A. Chem. Rev. 1981; 81: 543-555Crossref Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The movement of iron into the heme plane is assumed to trigger a transition from a tense state to a relaxed state after the binding of two oxygen molecules, and this trigger, in the form of the Fe–Nax pull, depends on the spin state of heme. Theoretical methods have been successfully applied to many problems in heme chemistry. Already the simple Hartree-Fock formalism correctly predicts the bent form of the O2 adduct (8Dedieu A. Rohmer M.-M. Benard M. Veillard A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976; 98: 3717-3718Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) provides excellent geometries of porphyrins in general (9Ghosh A. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 189-198Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 10Rovira C. Parrinello M. Int. J. Quant. Chem. 1998; 70: 387-394Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11Jensen K.P. Ryde U.

Soc. 1999; 121: 9915-9921Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Among these, the B3LYP density functional predicts very close-lying quintet and triplet states in deoxyheme models, sometimes with a triplet ground state (14Rovira C. Kunc K. Hutter J. Ballone P. Parrinello M. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1997; 101: 8914-8925Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Recently, DFT was used to compute the electronic spectrum of FeII-porphine with 2-methylimidazole as the axial ligand, making the quintet state the lowest in energy, but the triplet state only 12 kJ/mol higher (15Liao M.-S. Scheiner S. J. Chem. Phys. 2002; 116: 3635-3645Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar), in excellent agreement with the experiment. These circumstances indicate that the treatment of spin states in porphyrins is delicate because of the closeness in energy of various spin states. The fact that spin inversion occurs in globins during oxygen binding means that all low-lying states, independent of their number of unpaired electrons, need to be considered in a proper study of the reaction. Spin-dependent mechanisms relevant for the present work have been studied in particular by Franzen (16Franzen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16754-16759Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and Poli and Harvey (17Poli R. Harvey J.N. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2003; 32: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In this work, we have optimized the ground state and several low-lying excited states at many points along the heme–O2 binding curve. Our results indicate the reason for the facilitated binding of O2 to heme is a broad crossing region of the relevant spin states, which provides significant transition probabilities. We show that porphyrin is an ideal iron ligand for the spin transition problem, because it tunes the spin states to be close in energy, giving parallel binding curves, small activation energies, and large transition probabilities. This finding explains why the porphyrin ring is designed to bring spin states close in energy and why spin inversion and reversible binding is possible in heme proteins. We also provide evidence that similar arguments apply to other heme proteins, e.g. the heme peroxidases, where near degeneracy, in this case in the ferric state, is caused by strengthening the ligand field of the proximal histidine by a hydrogen bond to a carboxylate group. Hence, we suggest a new role for the choice of an axial ligand in such systems, viz. to bring spin states close in energy and thereby facilitate spin-forbidden binding of ligands. In the present work, we studied the reversible binding process FeII(heme)+O2↔FeII(heme)(O2)Reaction 1 with particular emphasis on analyzing possible states along this reaction coordinate. Such a detailed approach seems necessary to study the nature of the reversible process. Computational Details—All geometry optimizations were performed with the Becke 1988 exchange functional together with the Perdew 1986 correlation functional (BP86) (18Perdew J.P. Phys. Rev. B. 1986; 33: 8822-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (17014) Google Scholar, 19Becke A.D. Phys. Rev. A. 1988; 38: 3089-3097Crossref Scopus (40392) Google Scholar). Accurate energies were then estimated by single-point calculations using the Becke three-parameter hybrid method with the local spin-density approximation correlation functional of Vosko-Wilk-Nusair and the nonlocal Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional (B3LYP) (20Becke A.D. Phys. Rev. A. 1988; 38: 3098-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (44777) Google Scholar, 21Becke A.D. J. Chem. Phys. 1992; 96: 2155-2160Crossref Scopus (2201) Google Scholar, 22Becke A.D. J. Chem.

B3LYP is probably the most accurate of the generally available exchange-correlation functionals for calculating relative energies and frequencies (26Bauschlicher C.W. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1995; 246: 40-44Crossref Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 27Siegbahn P.E.M. Blomberg M.R.A. Chem. Rev. 2000; 100: 421-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 28Siegbahn P.E.M.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 188-189Google Scholar). However, in our experience, BP86 provides slightly better geometries for metal complexes than B3LYP and at an appreciably lower cost (30Ryde U. Nilsson K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14232-14233Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The calculations were carried out with the Turbomole software, version 5.6 (31Alrichs R. Bär M. Häser M. Horn H. Kölmel C. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1989; 162: 165-169Crossref Scopus (7403) Google Scholar). The basis sets used for geometry optimization were 6–31G(d) for all atoms except iron, which was described by the double-ζ basis set of Schäfer et al. (32Schäfer A. Horn H. Ahlrichs R. J. Chem. Phys. 1992; 97: 2571-2577Crossref Scopus (7954) Google Scholar), augmented with two p, one d, and one f function (DZpdf, exponents: 0.141308 and 0.043402 (p); 0.1357 (d); and 1.6200 (f)) with the contraction scheme (14s11p6d1f)/((8s7p4d1f). Only the pure five d and seven f-type functions were used. Our basis set is balanced and, based on experience (34Sigfridsson E. Ryde U. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), is flexible enough to account for the electronic structure and polarization effects encountered in heme systems. We applied the default (m3) grid size of Turbomole, and all optimizations were carried out in redundant internal coordinates. Unrestricted calculations were performed for all open-shell systems. We made use of default convergence criteria, which imply self-consistency down to 10–6 Hartree (2.6 J/mol) for the energy and 10–3 atomic units for the maximum norm of the gradient. Model System—All calculations were performed on the FeIIPorImO2 model, where Por is porphine (heme without side chains) and Im is imidazole, a model of the proximal histidine. We calculated the structure and energetics of Fe–O bond breaking for the seven lowest states by systematically increasing the Fe–O bond distance and optimizing the structure with a fixed Fe–O distance. From the fully optimized potential energy surfaces, we obtain the crossing points of the various spin states involved in the binding mechanism. Strictly speaking, proper crossing points would require identical structures of the states (true transition states). Methods to obtain such structures have been developed, but the geometric effect is usually small and does not significantly affect the location of the crossing point along the reaction coordinate (17Poli R. Harvey J.N. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2003; 32: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 35Harvey J.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 12401-12402Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We found that the most stable state of the FeIIPorImO2 model had Cs symmetry. This is consistent with the most accurate crystal structure of oxymyoglobin (1.0 Å resolution) (36Vojtechovsky J. Chu K. Berendzen J. Sweet R.M. Schlichting I. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2153-2174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), in which the imidazole ligand has a staggered conformation, with a C–Nax–Fe–Neq torsion angle of 45°.O2 adopts a 4-fold occupancy in the thermally disordered structure at staggered conformations with respect to the equatorial Fe–Neq bonds: two coplanar with imidazole and two orthogonal to it. Hence, this structure indicates that there are two binding modes of O2, one with Cs symmetry and the other unsymmetrical C1. We have optimized the structure of both states, and the symmetric one was 0.6 kJ/mol more stable than the unsymmetric one. The geometries, charges, and spin densities of the two states were identical to within the accuracy of the present work, i.e. ±0.01e and 0.001 Å. In addition, the calculation shows that π-bonding and trans electronic effects, including back-bonding to iron d-orbitals, are absent. This implies that imidazole is an innocent ligand. In fact, it has been shown that the rotation of the O2 group in a model similar to ours has a barrier of less than 8 kJ/mol (37Rovira C. Parrinello M. Int. J. Quant. Chem. 2000; 80: 1172-1180Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Likewise, another unsymmetrical conformation arising from a 45° rotation of imidazole (staggered oxygen and eclipsed imidazole with respect to the Fe–Neq bonds) was 2 kJ/mol less stable than the Cs conformation. The spin densities and charges were similar to within 0.02e of the Cs state, but the geometry showed differences of up to 0.07 Å in the Fe–O bond. Thus, we can conclude that the symmetric structure is the most stable geometry of this system and we have therefore employed Cs symmetry in all the calculations. This strongly facilitates the optimization and characterization of the various excited states. In Cs symmetry, the electronic states are labeled as symmetric A′ or antisymmetric A″, respectively, depending on whether their wave function preserves or changes sign upon reflection in the symmetry plane (xz, cf. Fig. 1). The states that we shall discuss will follow this nomenclature with a superscript in front indicating the multiplicity (the number of unpaired electrons plus one). States with the same symmetry and multiplicity are numbered (in brackets) after their optimum energy. For example, the ground state is a symmetric singlet, 1A′(1). Throughout this work, we used a coordinate system with Fe in the origin, the z-axis along the NIm–Fe–O bonds, the x-axis through two methine bridge atoms (not the nitrogens), and the y-axis through the two other methine bridges (Fig. 1). Thus, the imidazole and O2 molecules lie in the xz plane. The two unpaired π-electrons on oxygen are situated in two degenerate antibonding π orbitals, which transform as a′ and a″ in the reduced Cs symmetry when binding to deoxyhemoglobin. In our coordinate system, three of the Fe d-orbitals transform as a′, viz. xz, z2, and x2 – y2 and would therefore couple to the a′ unpaired π-electron of O2, whereas the other two orbitals, xy and yz, would interact with the a″ electrons instead. Selection of States—We have searched for low-energy states that could contribute to the process of oxygen binding. The states were obtained from a systematic permutation of the occupations of 6 electrons in an active space consisting of molecular orbitals 73–75 a′ and 45–47 a″. There are four classes of orbitals: symmetric and antisymmetric α and β orbitals. Some restrictions were introduced to minimize the search, based on the ground state. We have only examined those configurations that distinguish themselves by one occupied orbital per class from the ground-state configuration (74 45 74 45, i.e. 74 electrons in α a′ orbitals, 45 electrons in α a″ orbitals, 74 electrons in β a′ orbitals, and 45 electrons in β a″ orbitals). Some orbitals were found to be very high in energy and were subsequently avoided. For example, the state (75 44 74 45) had 212 kJ/mol higher energy than the ground state. Hence, we avoided the (45→75) excitation. Such selections reduced our number of states to 20, and the seven lowest are presented in this work. The electronic configurations and optimized energies of these states are shown in Table I. The states are unrestricted Kohn-Sham wave functions with a large degree of spin polarization in most cases.Table IRelative energies (kJ/mol) and occupation numbers of the seven lowest states of oxyheme in Cs symmetryStatea′-αa″-αa′-βa″-βErel1A′(1)744574450.05A′(1)7546734422.03A″(1)7446734524.13A″(2)aAntiferromagnetic state obtained from the septet dissociation product.7446734519.77A″(1)7547724428.51A″(1)7346744528.93A′(1)7446744424.7a Antiferromagnetic state obtained from the septet dissociation product.

Its geometry is displayed in Table II and Fig. 1. It can be seen that it closely resembles the x-ray structure of oxymyoglobin (36Vojtechovsky J. Chu K. Berendzen J. Sweet R.M. Schlichting I.

For the more soft Fe–Nax bond, the error is what can be expected with state-of-the-art DFT methods, 0.03 Å, whereas for the average equatorial Fe–Neq bonds, the difference is only 0.006 Å. This gives us confidence that this is the correct ground state and that the description of the Fe–O bond is essentially correct.Table IIOptimum bond distances (Å) of the seven lowest states of oxyheme, obtained with the BP86 functionalStateFe—OFe—NaxFe—Neq1Fe—Neq2Fe oopeDistance of the Fe ion out of the porphyrin plane (oop).1A′(1)1.8072.0962.0242.0010.0345A′(1)2.6792.2532.0121.9980.0873A″(1)1.9522.1002.0112.0050.0083A″(2)1.8922.1332.0792.0650.0187A″(1)2.5192.2002.0862.0690.1441A″(1)1.8782.0712.0122.0080.0123A′(1)2.0802.1352.0752.0750.044oxyexpaExperimental structure of oxymyoglobin.1.8062.0642.006bAverage of the four Ne—Neq distances.2.006bAverage of the four Ne—Neq distances.0.023deoxyexpcExperimental structure of deoxymyoglobin (36).2.1412.074bAverage of the four Ne—Neq distances.2.074bAverage of the four Ne—Neq distances.0.3647A″(1)dissdGeometry at largest Fe—O distance, 4.3 Å.4.3002.1582.0822.0790.257deoxycalc2.1532.0832.0790.266a Experimental structure of oxymyoglobin.b Average of the four Ne—Neq distances.c Experimental structure of deoxymyoglobin (36Vojtechovsky J.

Reed C.A. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 659-698Crossref Scopus (615) Google Scholar). However, the spin is unevenly distributed in the complex with a surplus of α spin on O2 (0.75 electrons) and a surplus of β spin on iron (-0.79e), as is quantified in Table III and illustrated in Fig. 1, bottom. The literature is rich in discussions about the nature of the Fe–O bond (38Momenteau M. Reed C.A. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 659-698Crossref Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 39Niu S. Hall M.B. Chem. Rev. 2000; 100: 353-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In particular, it has been argued whether the electronic structure of oxyheme is better described as singlet oxygen bound to low-spin FeII (2Pauling L. Coryell C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1936; 22: 210-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or as a superoxide radical antiferromagnetically coupled to low-spin FeIII (40Weiss J.J. Nature. 1964; 202: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Some consensus has arisen on the point that the FeIII-O2- form agrees better with experiments, e.g. the O–O frequency of 1100 cm–1, which is close to what is expected for O2- (3Pauling L. Nature. 1964; 203: 182-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), some aspects of the chemical reactivity (41Kaim W. Schwederski B.

Kunc K. Hutter J. Ballone P. Parrinello M. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1997; 101: 8914-8925Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar) (the FeII–O2 form would be a closed-shell singlet). However, the spin densities are far from ±1, which clearly shows that the electronic structure cannot be fully described by a single configuration (such as FeIII-O2- or FeII–O2), but rather as a mixture of both these and possibly also other configurations. Thus, our spin densities could be interpreted as a mixture of 75–80% FeIII-O2- and 20–25% FeII–O2. This is in accordance with the experimental observation that a quantum mixture of approximately two-thirds ferric and one-third ferrous states gives the best agreement with Mössbauer spectra (43Tsai T.E. Groves J.L. Wu C.S. J. Chem. Phys. 1981; 74: 4306-4314Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, oxyheme is inherently multiconfigurational, with an electronic structure that is somewhat analogous to that found in ozone (44Case D.A. Huynh B.H. Karplus M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 101: 4433-4453Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Early complete active space self-consistent field studies (on a simplified heme model with ammonia instead of imidazole) gave a mainly closed-shell 1A′ ground state (45Yamamoto S. Kashiwagi H. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1989; 161: 85-89Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), as did a symmetry-adapted cluster configuration interaction (SAC-CI) study (46Nakatsuji H. Hasegawa J. Hada M. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1996; 250: 379-386Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), with the lowest open-shell singlet 150 kJ/mol higher in energy. However, the present results give a better description of the ground state in terms of geometry. The Dissociated States—Isolated deoxyheme is experimentally a high-spin quintet (38Momenteau M. Reed C.A. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 659-698Crossref Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The optimized structure of this complex (Table II) agrees well (within 0.02 Å) with the crystal structure of deoxymyoglobin at 1.15 Å resolution (36Vojtechovsky J. Chu K. Berendzen J. Sweet R.M. Schlichting I. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2153-2174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). It is notable that both structures show a strongly distorted porphyrin with the iron ion ∼0.3 Å out of the ring plane, illustrating that high-spin iron is too large to fit into the ring cavity. When this complex is associated with triplet O2, there are six unpaired electrons in the total system. The unpaired spin on deoxyheme and O2 may be either parallel, giving rise to a septet, 7A″(1), or antiparallel, which gives rise to a triplet state, which turns out to be 3A″(2). At long (noninteracting) Fe–O distances, these two states are degenerate, as expected. Ideally, both states should give rise to rapid O2 binding (i.e. all active sites of hemoglobin should be able to bind all O2 molecules, independent of their spin states). However, as the Fe–O distance is decreased, the degeneracy is lifted. In the optimal structure, the 7A″(1) state has a Fe–O bond length of 2.52 Å, whereas it is 1.89 Å for state 3A″(2) (cf. Table II). The potential energy surface of the 7A″(1) state is flat around the minimum, and the energy is close to the dissociation limit, which is at 27 kJ/mol when calculated from separated species. The two states have very similar energies in their optimum geometries. Interestingly, the B3LYP method gives a quite different behavior of the 3A″(2) state. The energy of this state increases steadily as the Fe–O bond length is decreased, with an energy of ∼50 kJ/mol at the BP86 minimum. The B3LYP curve shows a very shallow minimum at Fe–O = 2.39 Å, with an energy close to the dissociation limit. The lowest triplet (intermediate-spin) state of deoxyheme is close in energy to the lowest quintet state. In fact, in the present calculations (as well as in most previous DFT calculations (11Jensen K.P. Ryde U. ChemBioChem. 2003; 4: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Sigfridsson E. Ryde U. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)), it is actually 3 kJ/mol more stable (4 kJ/mol when optimized at the B3LYP level; hence the dissociation limit of the lowest triplet state is 24 kJ/mol). Thus the states are degenerate to within the uncertainty of the method. If this triplet state is associated with triplet O2, we once again obtain two states, depending on the relative orientation of the two sets of unpaired spin, a quintet state 5A′(1) and a singlet state, which actually turns out to be the dissociation product of the singlet groun"
https://openalex.org/W2058595652,"This study shows that leptin induced a rapid phosphorylation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase, an enhancement of both NF-κB DNA binding and transcriptional activities, and a concentration-dependent increase of HT-29 cell proliferation. These effects are consistent with the presence of leptin receptors on cell membranes. The leptin induction of cell growth was associated with an increase of cell population in S and G2/M phase compared with control cells found in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Moreover, cyclin D1 immunoreactivity was enhanced in leptin-treated HT-29 cells and this increase was essentially associated with cell population in G0/G1 phase. On the other hand, we observed that sodium butyrate inhibited cell proliferation by blocking HT-29 cells in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, at physiological concentration, leptin prevented sodium butyrate-induced morphological nucleus changes, DNA laddering and suppressed butyrate-induced cell cycle arrest. This anti-apoptotic effect of leptin was associated with HT-29 cell proliferation and activation NF-κB pathways. However, the phosphorylation of p42/44 MAP kinase in response to leptin was reduced in butyrate-treated cells. These data demonstrated that leptin is a potent mitogenic factor for intestinal epithelial cells through the MAP kinase and NF-κB pathways. They also showed, for the first time, that leptin promotes colon cancer HT-29 cell survival upon butyrate challenge by counteracting the apoptotic programs initiated by this short chain fatty acid probably through the NF-κB pathways.

The long Ob-Rb subtype (Ob-RL) appears as the functional, signal-transducing isoform, responsible for the action of leptin (8Lee G.H. Proenca R. Montez J.M. Carroll K.M. Darvishzadeh J.G. Lee J.I. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar). The long isoform, Ob-Rb, can activate the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathways, whereas both Ob-Rb and the short isoform (Ob-Ra) can transduce signals through insulin receptor substrates and through mitogen-activated protein kinase-(MAP kinase) dependent pathways (for review, see Ref. 9Tartaglia L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6093-6096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Although, it is currently believed that leptin action is largely mediated by the central nervous system, the expression of Ob-RL in peripheral tissues indicates that it is a direct target of leptin. There is now an emerging role of leptin as a growth factor for several cell types (10Santos-Alvarez J. Goberna R. Sanchez-Margalet V. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 194: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 11Martin-Romero C. Sanchez-Margalet V. Cell. Immunol. 2001; 212: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 12Najib S. Sanchez-Margalet V. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 27: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the gut, leptin has been reported to stimulate the proliferation of gastric and intestinal epithelial cells through activation of the MAP kinase-dependent pathways (13Hardwick J.C.

Kato N. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 19: 1009-1014PubMed Google Scholar). Besides this leptin growth effect, we have previously demonstrated that leptin can enhance the activity of the brush border Pept-1 transporter (15Buyse M. Berlioz F. Guilmeau S. Tsocas A. Voisin T.

Butyrate is a short chain fatty acid that is produced in the colonic lumen by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrate and dietary fibers (17Topping D.L. Clifton P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1031-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar). In the proximal large bowel, butyrate represents the preferred respiratory fuels in the intestine through β-oxidation. Apart from the function of butyrate as a dominant energy source for colonocytes, its also inhibits cellular proliferation and induces apoptosis by regulating the key proteins controlling the cell cycle (18Coradini D. Pellizzaro C. Marimpietri D. Abolafio G. Daidone M.G. Cell Prolif. 2000; 33: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In particular, NaB was shown to down-regulate 25 genes including cyclin D1, a key regulator of the G1/S phase and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen PCNA in colonic epithelial cells, arguing for its pro-apoptotic property (19Tabuchi Y. Arai Y. Kondo T. Takeguchi N. Asano S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated whether leptin could affect sodium butyrate-induced apoptosis in the human colon cancer cell line HT-29 and examine the intracellular mechanisms involved. We demonstrated, for the first time, that leptin promotes intestinal epithelial HT-29 cell survival upon butyrate challenge by counteracting the apoptotic programs initiated by this short chain fatty acid, probably through activation of NF-κB pathways. Reagents—Human leptin was purchased from R&D Systems (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) and stored as stock solution in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) at -20 °C. Antibody sources. Rabbit polyclonal NF-κB p65 and IκB-α antibodies, goat polyclonal anti-Ob-R(C-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and mouse monoclonal cyclin D1 was from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Fluorescein- and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma Chemicals. Cell Culture—The human colon cancer cell line, HT-29 were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Subculture of HT-29 cell line was performed by enzymatic digestion (trypsin/EDTA solution: 0.05/0.02%). Cell Growth and Viability—Cells (3 × 103/well) were seeded into 48-well dishes under the growth conditions described above. Three days after seeding, cells were serum-deprived for 24 h and then treated with recombinant human leptin (0–10 nm) for 24 h. The time course effects (24, 48, and 72 h) were in serum-free culture cells using 1 nm of rhLeptin; the medium was renewed every day. After 24, 48, and 72 h, the cells were harvested by trypsin digestion, and cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion with a hematocytometer. Reverse Transcription-PCR of Leptin Receptor (Ob-Rb) in HT-29 Cells—Briefly, total RNA (RNAT) was extracted from HT-29 cells, using Trizol® according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNAT was reverse-transcribed into cDNA then amplified with Ob-Rb primers. The primers of 5′-GCCAACAACTGTGGTCTCTC-3′ and 5′-AGAGAAGCACTTGGTGACTG-3′ for Ob-Rb were designed on the basis of the previously published cDNA sequence for human Ob-Rb leptin receptor (GenBank™, accession number: CAA73211), which defines an amplicon of 248 bp. PCR was performed under the thermocycling conditions as follows: 1 min denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min annealing at 57 °C, and 1 min extension at 72 °C for 30 cycles. The last amplification was followed by a final 10 min elongation step at 72 °C. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel in the presence of ethidium bromide. Immunocytochemistry—HT-29 cells were grown on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h. Cells were fixed at room temperature for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde solution, then rinsed three times with PBS. Nonspecific sites were blocked with 5% nonimmune horse serum in PBS for 30 min. Coverslips were incubated overnight with a goat polyclonal anti-Ob-R (dilution 1:20); under a humid atmosphere. After three washes for 5 min, they were labeled with a donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated to FITC (1:40) or with phalloidin-TRITC (1 μg/ml) for 1 h in darkness, followed by three rinses and were mounted with Vectashield and observed under an LSM510 confocal microscope (Zeiss). Controls—No immunostaining was observed in HT-29 cells under the following conditions: (a) normal goat serum used in place of immune rabbit serum or (b) co-incubation of coverslips with Ob-Rb antiserum and the control immunogen peptide (sc-1832P). Cell Cycle Analysis and Flow Cytometry Acquisition—Cells were seeded into flasks (3 × 105 cells/25 cm2), and let to raise exponential growth. To ensure that cells progress through the cell cycle in synchronous manner, cells were maintained in serum-free medium from 24–48 h. Cells were treated with vehicle or leptin (1 nm) for 24 h. For flow cytometry analysis, cells were trypsinized, washed twice with PBS, and fixed in 80% ethanol for at least 18 h at -20 °C. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and stained with mouse monoclonal FITC-conjugated cyclin D1 antibody (0.5 ng/ml) and/or with a staining solution containing RNase A (0.2 mg/ml) and propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cell cycle was analyzed using a laser flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Data were acquired on a Coulter flow cytometer using Expo32 software. 10,000 cells were acquired for analysis of the HT-29 cell population gated as double staining with anti-cyclinD1-FITC and propidium iodide. Quantification of Phosphorylated ERK1/2 Proteins—Fast-activated cell-based ELISA (Active Motif Europe, Brussels, Belgium) was used to determine ERK phosphorylation relative to the total ERK protein found in cells following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, HT-29 cells were seeded on 96-well plates and serum-starved for 24 h. Then the cells were treated with leptin (1 nm), NaB (5 mm) either alone or in combination for various time periods. The cells were fixed. One part of the wells was used for determination of phospho-ERK using a specific antibody, while the other wells were used for determination of total ERK with another antibody, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and developing reagent. A sensitive colorimetric readout was quantified by spectrophotometry at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 630 nm. The relative number of cells in each well was then determined through the Crystal Violet reagent. The values of the phospho-ERK and total ERK signals were normalized for cell number. The data are expressed as a ratio of phospho-ERK to total ERK. Western Blot Analysis—Whole or fractionated (nuclear and cytoplasmic) cell extracts (20Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar) were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were first incubated with a specific antibody that recognizes NF-κB p65 (dilution, 1:100) and were further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG (at dilution, 1:3000) for 1 h. The immune complexes were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Confocal Microscopy Analysis of NF-κB Activation—In order to determine whether the activation of transcription factor NF-κB occurred after addition of leptin, nuclear translocation of NF-κB was examined by confocal microscopy. Cells were cultured in Labtek plates, and treated with or without 1 nm leptin for various times (0, 5, 15, 30 min, and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 24 h). The cells were fixed as described above and were labeled with a rabbit polyclonal anti-NF-κB p65 (dilution: 1:100) followed by a FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G at dilution 1:200. Cells were then stained with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml). Cells were examined under a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM510). Co-localization of the antibody to NF-κB p65 and the intercalating agent propidium iodide was analyzed using the co-localization LSM510 3.2 physiology software. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Andrews and Faller (20Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar) from serum-free HT-29 cells treated without or with 1 nm leptin. 5 μg of protein were incubated with 0.5 ng of 5′-biotinylated NF-κB double-stranded oligonucleotides ((wild-type NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (WT): 5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′) or (NF-κB mutant oligonucleotide: 5′-AGT TGA GGC GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′) in buffer containing 10 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 50 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmol/liter EDTA, 20% glycerol, and poly(dI-dC) (50 μg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature. The binding reaction was immediately resolved on native 7.5% polyacrylamide gel in Tris/glycine/EDTA electrophoretic buffer and then electrotransferred to nylon membrane (Biohylon Z+). After transfer, the membrane was exposed to UV light (1200 Joules) for 5 min and then blocked for 30 min at room temperature in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). The immune complexes were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (diluted at 1:100) and chemiluminescence. The specificity of the assay was confirmed in separate shift assays on the same nuclear extracts, demonstrating that activated NF-κB factor does not bind to NF-κB mutant oligonucleotide. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Activity Assay—Cells were seeded 1 day before transfection (2 × 105 cells/well in 12-well dishes). Transfection was performed by jetPEI transfection reagent (Polyplus-transfection) with 2 μg of (κB)3 IFN-luciferase plasmid (21Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The reporter contained a single promoter for β-interferon (IFNβ) gene along with three upstream κB sites. The κB site motif responds to NF-κB p65. Thus luciferase activity reflects the instantaneous concentration of its mRNA. After 24 h transfection, cells were starved for 30 h and then stimulated with or without leptin (1 nm) or with 10% fetal bovine serum for 30 min. Cell medium was removed, the cells were rinsed with PBS, and then lysed with 200 μl of reagent (Luciferase Assay System, Promega). 20 μl of the extract was reacted with luciferase substrate (100 μl), and luminescence was quantified by a luminometer. The experiments were performed in triplicate, and data are representative of three independent experiments. The results are expressed as “fold increase of luciferase activity,” which was calculated relative to the basal level of (κB)3 reporter activity set to 1 unit and corrected for empty vector effects. Multiwell Colorimetric Assay for Active NF-κB—TransAm® assays (Active Motif Europe) was used to determine the NF-κBp65 DNA binding activity in the absence or in the presence of competitor oligonucleotide containing wild-type NF-κBp65 consensus binding site, according to the manufacturer's instructions (22Renard P. Ernest I. Houbion A. Art M. Le Calvez H. Raes M. Remacle J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E21Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Briefly, a biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB consensus site (5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′) was immobilized on streptavidin plates so that nuclear extracts containing the active form of NFκB specifically binds to the consensus binding site in the oligonucleotide. The bound transcription factor is detected with a specific antibody to NF-κBp65 followed by a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and chromogenic substrate. A sensitive colorimetric readout is quantified by spectrophotometry at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 655 nm. A competition assay of DNA binding activity was performed in the presence of an excess of oligonucleotide (20 pmol) containing the wild type consensus binding site to prove that the transcription isoform detected is binding specifically to the immobilized probe. Activation of NF-κB was expressed as units of OD450 nm. DNA Fragmentation—Apoptosis was evaluated by examining the characteristic pattern of DNA laddering. Briefly, after 48 h of treatment with 1 nm leptin or 5 mm NaB alone or both compounds, HT-29 cells were harvested and washed in PBS. Then, a lysis buffer containing 0.6% of SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and proteinase K (1 mg/ml) were added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Afterward, NaCl was added to a concentration of 1 m, mixed by inversion, and centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred and cold ethanol was added, mixed by inversion, and the mixtures were left at -80 °C for 1 h, and centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C. DNA pellet was air-dried and resuspended in 25 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl/1 mm EDTA pH 7.4. RNase A was added to the suspension, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and electrophoresed in 2% agarose gel containing 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide. Statistics Analysis—The results are expressed as mean ± S.D. They were compared by one-way analysis of variance, followed by a Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test if significant results were obtained. Values were considered statistically significant with p < 0.05. HT-29 Cells Express Leptin Receptor That Mediates Proliferation—By confocal microscopy (Fig. 1, A and B), leptin receptor immunoreactivity was detected in HT-29 cells (Fig. 1A) and was mainly localized at the periphery of the cell as shown by double fluorescent labeling with actin labeled with Phalloidin-TRITC (Fig. 1B). The immunostaining was specific since leptin receptor immunoreactivity was no longer observed in the presence of the immunogen peptide (data not shown). Using specific Ob-Rb primers, an expected amplicon of 248 bp was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). Thus, HT-29 cells express functional leptin receptors (Ob-Rb) on cell membranes. Indeed, leptin induced a dose-dependent HT-29 cell proliferation with an EC50 value of 0.35 ± 0.02 nm (Fig. 1C). In addition, HT-29 cell viability was measured after 48 h of exposure to leptin (1 nm) or sodium butyrate (5 mm) or both combined compounds (Fig. 1D). Leptin treatment significantly increased by 1.5-fold HT-29 cell proliferation (p < 0.01 versus control) whereas treatment of the cells with sodium butyrate (5 mm) reduced it. In the presence of sodium butyrate, HT-29 cell growth was still maintained and significantly increased by 1.6-fold upon leptin challenge (p < 0.001 versus NaB). These data show that leptin acts as potent mitogen on HT-29 cells growth and inhibits sodium butyrate-anti-proliferative effects. Flow cytometric data of cell cycle analysis of serum-free control cells (Fig. 2A, left panel) indicated that 92 ± 1.3% of HT-29 cells are in G0/G1 phase, 3.9 ± 0.5% in S phase, and 2.8 ± 0.6% in G2/M phase. When serum-free HT-29 cells were treated with 1 nm leptin for 24 h, only 70.6 ± 1.6% of HT-29 cells were found in G0/G1 phase, 8.2 ± 0.2% in S phase, and 21.1 ± 0.4% in G2/M phase (Fig. 2A, right panel). These data indicate that leptin is a potent mitogenic factor for HT-29 cells. These results are consistent with dot plots of cyclin D1-FITC flow of cytometry data. As shown in Fig. 2B, immunoreactive cyclin D1 cells were detectable both in serum free control- and leptin-treated cells. Immunopositive cyclin D1 cells were counted in the quadrant D2 of the dot plot. As compared with serum-free control cells, the immunopositive cyclin D1 cells were significantly higher in leptin-stimulated HT-29 cells (98.2 ± 0.4% versus 61.9 ± 3.2%; p < 0.01) indicating an increased expression of cyclin D1 upon stimulation of HT-29 cells by leptin. Propidium iodide staining allowed us to correlate cyclin D1-positive cells with the cell cycle phase. In serum-free control HT-29 cells, the major distribution of the cyclin D1 was found in cells in G0/G1 phase, but very faint immunopositive cyclin D1 cells in S and G2/M phase were detected (Fig. 2B, left panel). 24 h after leptin stimulation, immunoreactivity of cyclin D1 was significantly increased by +58% (p < 0.01 versus control), and this immunoreactivity was mainly associated with the G0/G1 phase of cell cycle. Leptin Activates MAP kinase and NF-κB Pathways in HT-29 Cells—Leptin (1 nm) induced a significant 2-fold increase in the ratio of phosphorylated ERK to total ERK (p < 0.001 versus control) indicating that leptin activates p44/42 MAPK-dependent pathways in HT-29 cells. NaB (5 mm) alone had no significant effect on ERK phosphorylation but significantly reduced leptin-induced ERK phosphorylation (p < 0.05 versus leptin alone) (Fig. 3A). Because leptin promotes HT-29 cell survival upon butyrate challenge, we investigated whether NF-κB could be involved in this effect. Leptin (1 nm) induced a significant 4-fold increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity (p < 0.001 versus control) in agreement with our data in Fig. 4. On the other hand, NaB (5 mm) alone had no effect on NF-κB DNA binding activity and did not affect leptin-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 3B). Leptin Induces Nuclear Translocation and Transcriptional Activity of NF-κB in HT-29 Cells—Immunoblotting analysis of whole, cytoplasmic, and nuclear extracts showed an increase of transcription factor NF-κB p65 immunoreactive protein in the nuclear extracts from leptin-treated cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4A). In addition, in cytoplasmic extracts from leptin-treated cells, one additional immunoreactive IκB-α protein was detected compared with control (Fig. 4A) suggesting that IκB-α is part of the degradation process. This nuclear translocation of NF-κB was confirmed by confocal microscopy studies using the co-localization LSM510 3.2 physiology software. The transcription factor NF-κB was localized in the nucleus 30 min after exposure of the cells to leptin (data not shown). Thus, leptin induces translocation of NF-κB p65 into the nucleus of HT-29 cells. DNA binding activity of the transcription factor NF-κB was also determined by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 4B, only nuclear extracts from leptin-treated cells (lane 3) bind to the wild-type NF-κB oligonucleotide whereas nuclear extracts from control cells (lane 4) had no DNA binding activity. In the presence of the mutant NF-κB oligonucleotide, both nuclear extracts from control (lane 1) or leptin-treated (lane 2) cells showed any detectable DNA binding activity. Taken together these data indicate that leptin promotes the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and enhances its DNA binding activity in HT-29 cells. The in vivo transcriptional activity of NF-κB was measured by the luciferase activity in HT-29 cells transiently transfected with the (κB)3 IFN-luciferase plasmid. Luciferase activity was 1.5-fold increased in leptin-stimulated cells as compared with control (Fig. 4D). Leptin-induced transcriptional NF-κB p65 level is similar to that obtained with serum stimulation. Therefore, leptin activates the transcription factor NF-κB via the leptin receptor in HT-29 cells. Leptin Counteracts Butyrate-induced Apoptosis in HT-29 Cells—Morphological aspects of propidium iodide-stained HT-29 cells were illustrated in Fig. 5. Serum-starved HT-29 cells appeared as a monolayer (Fig. 5A) whereas leptin-treated HT-29 cells showed some cell superposition probably due to their proliferation (Fig. 5B). Treatment of the cells with sodium butyrate (5 mm) reduced HT-29 cell proliferation and induced morphological changes of the nuclei characterized by chromatin condensation (Fig. 5C). Flow cytometric analysis showed that sodium butyrate caused cell cycle arrest by blocking the cells in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 5G). Interestingly, treatment of HT-29 cells with 1 nm of leptin prevented sodium butyrate-induced morphological nucleus changes (Fig. 5D) and suppressed butyrate-induced cell cycle arrest in the HT-29 cells (Fig. 5H). In addition, leptin prevented the butyrate induction of DNA laddering (Fig. 6, lane 4) whereas leptin alone had no effect on genomic DNA (Fig. 6, lane 3). This anti-apoptotic effect of leptin was also associated with HT-29 cell proliferation observed 24 h (data not shown) and even 48 h (Fig. 1D) after butyrate exposure. Moreover butyrate-treated cells exhibited an internucleosomal degradation of genomic DNA resulting in DNA laddering (Fig. 6, lane 2) in agreement with the well known pro-apoptotic property of sodium butyrate (23Heerdt B.G. Houston M.A. Augenlicht L.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3288-3293PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hague A. Manning A.M. Hanlon K.A. Huschtscha L.I. Hart D. Paraskeva C. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In this report, we have demonstrated that human colonic HT-29 cells expressing the leptin receptor can sense and respond to physiological concentration of leptin by increasing their proliferation. In addition, we demonstrate that leptin promotes HT-29 cell survival from butyrate apoptosis. The leptin stimulation of HT-29 cell proliferation confirms earlier results suggesting that leptin is a growth factor for colonic epithelial cells (13Hardwick J.C. Van Den Brink G.R. Offerhaus G.J.

https://openalex.org/W1969771853,"A key feature of prion diseases is the conversion of the normal, cellular prion protein (PrPC) into β-sheet-rich disease-related isoforms (PrPSc), the deposition of which is thought to lead to neurodegeneration. In the present study, the squalene synthase inhibitor squalestatin reduced the cholesterol content of cells and prevented the accumulation of PrPSc in three prion-infected cell lines (ScN2a, SMB, and ScGT1 cells). ScN2a cells treated with squalestatin were also protected against microglia-mediated killing. Treatment of neurons with squalestatin resulted in a redistribution of PrPC away from Triton X-100 insoluble lipid rafts. These effects of squalestatin were dose-dependent, were evident at nanomolar concentrations, and were partially reversed by cholesterol. In addition, uninfected neurons treated with squalestatin became resistant to the otherwise toxic effect of PrP peptides, a synthetic miniprion (sPrP106) or partially purified prion preparations. The protective effect of squalestatin, which was reversed by the addition of water-soluble cholesterol, correlated with a reduction in prostaglandin E2 production that is associated with neuronal injury in prion disease. These studies indicate a pivotal role for cholesterol-sensitive processes in controlling PrPSc formation, and in the activation of signaling pathways associated with PrP-induced neuronal death.

Prion diseases, or Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs), are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that include Kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), and Gerstman-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome in man. These diseases are associated with the deposition of aggregates of disease-related isoforms (PrPSc) of a host-encoded protein (PrPC) within the central nervous system (1Williams A. Lucassen P.J. Ritchie D. Bruce M. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 144: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). During disease, a portion of the α-helix and random coil structure in PrPC is refolded into a β-pleated sheet in PrPSc (2Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I.

PrPC is found in lipid rafts or caveolae-like domains (CLDs) 1The abbreviations used are: CLD, caveolae-like domains; FCS, fetal calf serum; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; IL, interleukin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MTT, 3-[4,5 dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; HMG-coA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-co-enzyme A; PG, prostaglandin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.

Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). The formation of these lipid rafts is cholesterol-dependent (10Rothberg K.G. Ying Y.S. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2931-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and drugs that affect cholesterol levels have been shown to influence the formation of PrPSc. Thus, the formation of PrPSc in prion-infected neuroblastoma cells (ScN2a cells) was reduced when cells were treated with lovastatin (11Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. Avraham D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Lovastatin is a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol production (12Alberts A.W. Chen J. Kuron G. Hunt V. Huff J.

However, although HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reduce cholesterol levels, they exhibit many other effects, for example, they also inhibit the production of isoprenoid precursors (16Maltese W.A. Sheridan K.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that many of the effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are independent of their effects on cholesterol metabolism (17Diomede L. Albani D. Sottocorno M. Donati M.B. Bianchi M.

Lett. 1989; 102: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), the precise mechanisms by which PrPSc deposition leads to neuronal damage remain to be fully determined. The processes of neuronal loss have been examined by incubating neuronal cells with either prion preparations (22Müller W.E. Ushijima H. Schroder H.C. Forrest J.M. Schatton W.F. Rytik P.G.

We also examined the effects of cholesterol manipulation on neuronal prostaglandin (PG)E2 production since levels of neuronal PGE2 are closely associated with PrP-induced neuronal death (26Bate C. Rutherford S. Gravenor M. Reid S. Williams A. Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 1933-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Microglial activation frequently co-localizes with the accumulation of PrPSc in the CNS (4Jeffrey M. Halliday W.G. Bell J. Johnston A.R. MacLeod N.K. Ingham C. Sayers A.R. Brown D.A. Fraser J.R.

Moreover, the addition of microglia to neurons treated with prions or PrP peptides results in a significant further reduction in neuronal survival, which is greater than that seen on exposure of neurons to PrP peptides only (29Brown D.R. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 30Giese A. Brown D.R. Groschup M.H. Feldmann C. Haist I. Kretzschmar H.A. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a significant role of microglia in neuronal loss during prion diseases and support interpretations drawn from time course studies of experimental prion disease in rodent models (1Williams A. Lucassen P.J. Ritchie D. Bruce M. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 144: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 30Giese A. Brown D.R. Groschup M.H. Feldmann C. Haist I. Kretzschmar H.A. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the effect of squalestatin on a second model of prion-induced neurodegeneration that involves the interaction between microglia and prion-infected neuroblastoma cells or PrP-damaged neurons. PrPres Production—Scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells (ScN2a cells) were a gift of Dr. M. Rogers (University College, Dublin, Ireland). These cells produce PrPSc and infectious agent, and were grown in Hams F12 medium containing 2 mm glutamine, standard antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 200 nm retinoic acid. SMB cells (TSE Resource Centre, Institute for Animal Health, Compton, UK), which also produce PrPSc and infectious agent, were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing standard antibiotics, 2 mm glutamine, 200 nm retinoic acid, and 2% FCS. ScGT1 cells are an immortalized murine hypothalamic neuronal cell line infected by the scrapie Chandler strain and persistently express PrPres and were supplied by Dr. Sylvain Lehmann (CNRS-IGH, Montpellier, France) and were grown in optimem supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 200 nm retinoic acid, 5% FCS, and standard antibiotics. To measure the effect of squalestatin on the PrPres formation, ScN2a, SMB cells or ScGT1 cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well microtiter plates in the presence or absence of squalestatin alone (0–100 nm) (GlaxoSmithKline, Stevenage, Herts, UK), 100 nm squalestatin plus 1–100 μg/ml cholesterol (either free cholesterol or water-soluble cholesterol complexed to methyl-β-cyclodextrin)(Sigma), or 100 nm squalestatin plus 500 μm mevalonate (Sigma). Cells were then grown with daily changes of media and PrPres production was evaluated after 8 days. In some studies, ScN2a cells were grown in the serum-free neurobasal medium (NBM) (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and B27 components. Non-infected N2a cells or SMB cells that had been “cured” of infectivity by serial passages in the presence of pentosan polysulphate (PS cells) were used as controls. At the end of the treatment, cells were detached and counted to establish cell numbers. Washed cells were first lysed in distilled water and the insoluble pellet collected. The pellet was suspended in an extraction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and digested with 10 μg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped with 5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and the remaining supernatant was split in two. The first sample was tested in a PrP-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The second sample was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C. The pellet was dissolved in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad). Samples were boiled for 5 min and 20 μl of each sample was subjected to electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto a Hybond-P PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by semi-dry blotting. Membranes were blocked using 10% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20. PrPres was detected by incubation with mab SAF83 (a gift from J. Grassi, CEA, Saclay, France) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by a secondary anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase (1 h at room temperature). Detection of bound antibody was by the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Lysates were also made from the non-infected N2a cells to evaluate PrPC content. Cells were treated as above except that proteinase K digestion was excluded. Solubility of PrPc in Triton X-100 —To determine the effect of squalestatin on the distribution of PrPC, uninfected murine N2a neuroblastoma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, standard antibiotics, and 2% FCS in the presence or absence of 100 nm squalestatin. After 3 days cells were lysed on ice at 1 × 107 cells/ml in either (a) an extraction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 5 mm PMSF or (b) a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 5 mm PMSF. Soluble material was collected after centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The insoluble pellet was dissolved in extraction buffer (a) at 1 × 107 cells/ml, and all three supernatants were tested in a PrP ELISA. Animals—129/Ola mice were housed at constant temperature (21 ± 1 °C) and relative humidity (60 ± 10%) and supplied ad libitum with water and a standard diet. Procedures involving animals and their care were conducted in accordance with national and international regulations (Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986, UK, and EEC Council Directive 86609, OJ L358, 1, 12 December 1987). Primary Neuronal Cultures—Primary cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 15.5 mice as previously described (28Bate C. Reid S. Williams A. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2589-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After 2 days, medium was changed to NBM containing B27 components, 2 mm glutamine and 5 μm cytosine arabinoside to prevent the proliferation of astroglia. Mature cultures were treated with 5 mml-leucine methylester to reduce the number of contaminating microglia before further use (31Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments, cultures were preincubated for 3 h in media containing 100 nm squalestatin alone or a mixture of 100 nm squalestatin and 1–100 μg/ml water-soluble cholesterol before the addition of peptides (HuPrP-(82–146), HuPrP-(106–126), sPrP106, or a prion extract. After another 3 h, microglia were added to neuronal cultures in the ratio 1 microglia to 10 neurons. After 4 days, cultures were shaken and washed to remove non-adherent microglia, and neuronal viability was determined using the 3-[4,5 dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. Microglia—Microglia cultures were prepared from newborn 129/Ola mice as previously described (28Bate C. Reid S. Williams A. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2589-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Isolated microglia was added to ScN2a cells or treated neuronal cells in the ratio of 1 microglia to 10 neuronal cells. In other studies microglia were added to 96-well flat-bottomed plates at 1 × 105 cells/well and allowed to adhere overnight. Microglia were subsequently treated with 100 nm squalestatin or a vehicle control for 3 h before the addition of 10 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide. After a further 24 h supernatants were collected and tested for IL-6. Neurotoxicity of PrP Peptides or Prion Preparations—The human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line (European Collection of Cell Cultures) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, standard antibiotics and 2% FCS. Cells were plated at 3 × 104 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to adhere overnight. The following day, cells were pretreated for 3 h either with 0–100 nm squalestatin alone or with 100 nm squalestatin plus 1–100 μg/ml of water-soluble cholesterol or with 100 nm squalestatin plus 500 μm of mevalonate, before the addition of peptides, sPrP106 or a diluted prion extract. Squalestatin stock solutions were made in di-methyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and diluted appropriately. Cell viability was determined 24 h later using the MTT method (32Vistica D.T. Skehan P. Scudiero D. Monks A. Pittman A. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2515-2520PubMed Google Scholar). Optical density was measured at 595 nm, and results calculated by reference to untreated cells. PGE2 levels were also determined at this time point. Microglia-mediated Toxicity—To investigate the effect of squalestatin on microglia-mediated toxicity, ScN2a cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 100 nm squalestatin alone, or in a mixture of 100 nm squalestatin and 1–100 μg/ml water-soluble cholesterol for a further 24 h after which microglia were added in the ratio 1 microglia to 10 ScN2a cells. The survival of ScN2a cells was measured after cells had been co-cultured for 24 h using the MTT method. N2a neuroblastoma cells were used as non-infected controls. PrP Peptides—For studies using human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells, peptides containing amino acids corresponding to residues 106–126 of the human prion protein (HuPrP-(106–126)) (23Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Nature. 1993; 362: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) and a peptide consisting of the same amino acids in a scrambled order (HuPrP-(106–126scrambled)) were synthesized by solid-phase chemistry and purified by reverse-phase HPLC. A longer peptide containing amino acids corresponding to residues 82–146 of the human prion protein (HuPrP-(82–146)) (24Tagliavini F. Prelli F. Ghiso J. Bugiani O. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. Farlow M.R. Ghetti B. Frangione B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) was also used, as was a control peptide containing amino acid residues 82–146 in a scrambled sequence (HuPrP-(82–146scrambled)). A synthetic miniprion (sPrP106) derived from the murine PrP sequence was used for studies on murine cortical neurons (25Bonetto V. Massignan T. Chiesa R. Morbin M. Mazzoleni G. Diomede L. Angeretti N. Colombo L. Forloni G. Tagliavini F. Salmona M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31327-31334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Prion Extract Preparations—Partially purified prion extracts were obtained from ScGT1 cells to reduce the number of potential contaminants that may be present in prion preparations from infected brain material. Washed cells were suspended in an extraction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and digested with 10 μg/ml of proteinase K for 1 h at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped with 5 mm PMSF and the supernatant was loaded onto a prewashed C18 Sep-Pak column (Waters, Elstree, UK). Bound material was eluted under a gradient of n-propanol in water (5–100%), fractions containing PrP were pooled (samples tested by a PrP ELISA), washed three times in distilled water and resuspended in 0.01 m pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered saline at 100 ng/ml. Control preparations from non-infected N2a cells were produced by lysis in extraction buffer containing 5 mm PMSF. The supernatant was loaded on to a prewashed C18 Sep-Pak column and eluted under a gradient of n-propanol in water. Fractions containing PrP were pooled, washed three times in distilled water, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at 100 ng/ml. PrP ELISA—Briefly, treated lysates were added to a Nunc Maxisorb Immunoplates precoated with diluted rabbit antiserum raised to a PrP peptides (ovine PrP-(27–52) and ovine PrP-(100–111)) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (a gift from by Dr. J. P. M. Langeveld, Pepscan Systems, Lelystad, The Netherlands). Samples were applied and visualized using mAb SAF83 (gift from Prof. J. Grassi (CEA, Saclay, France), followed by an anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) and an appropriate indicator. Plates were read at 450 nm, and results were calculated by reference to a standard curve of recombinant murine PrP (Prionics, Zurich, Switzerland). PGE2 Assay—Analysis of cellular PGE2 levels was determined in SH-SY5Y cells by using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This assay is based on competition between unlabeled PGE2 in the sample and a fixed amount of labeled PGE2 for a PGE2-specific antibody. The detection limit of this assay is 20 pg/ml. IL-6 ELISA—Levels of interleukin (IL)-6 in cultures containing microglia were assayed in a sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) as previously described (28Bate C. Reid S. Williams A. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2589-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Plates were read at 450 nm, and results were calculated by reference to a standard curve of recombinant murine IL-6. The detection limit of this assay is 20 pg/ml. Cholesterol and Protein Content—Cellular cholesterol and protein content were determined on 1 × 107 SH-SY5Y cells, or ScN2a cells grown in either Hams F12 medium containing 2% FCS or in serum-free NBM, before and after exposure to 100 nm squalestatin for 3–24 h. At the end of incubation, cells were detached by trypsinization, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted (550 × g for 10 min). Total lipids were extracted according to Folch et al. (33Folch J. Lees M.B. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and total cholesterol was determined using an enzymatic assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Cellular protein concentration was determined on cell lysates using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Statistical Analysis—Comparison of treatment effects was carried out using one and two way analysis of variance techniques as appropriate. Post hoc comparisons of means were performed as necessary. For all statistical tests significance was set at the 5% level. Squalestatin Reduces PrPres Formation in Prion-infected Cells—Previous studies had indicated that ScN2a cells contain protease-resistant PrP (PrPres) and infectious agent (34Butler D.A. Scott M.R. Bockman J.M. Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Hsiao K.K. Kingsbury D.T. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the effect of squalestatin, an inhibitor of squalene synthase that inhibits the production of cholesterol (20Baxter A. Fitzgerald B.J. Hutson J.L. McCarthy A.D. Motteram J.M. Ross B.C. Sapra M. Snowden M.A. Watson N.S. Williams R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11705-11708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), on ScN2a cells. As shown in Fig. 2, the accumulation of PrPres in ScN2a cells was significantly reduced by squalestatin in a dose-dependent manner. The amounts of PrPres were reduced to below detectable levels in ScN2a cells treated with 100 nm squalestatin (Fig. 2 and Table I). This effect was observed in both lipid-depleted NBM medium and in Hams F12 medium containing 2% FCS that contained extracellular cholesterol. The effect of squalestatin on PrPres production was accompanied by a decrease in the cellular cholesterol levels. ScN2a cells grown in medium containing 2% FCS and treated for 24 h with 100 nm squalestatin contained significantly less cholesterol (0.262 ± 0.040 μg of cholesterol/mg protein, mean ± S.D.) than did untreated ScN2a cells (0.509 ± 0.041, n = 6, p < 0.05). The cholesterol content of ScN2a cells grown in NBM (0.484 ± 0.033) was greatly reduced by treatment with 100 nm squalestatin (0.181 ± 0.025, n = 6, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the cholesterol content of ScN2a cells grown in serum-free medium and ScN2a cells grown in 2% FCS. To investigate whether the protective effect of squalestatin was mediated by sterol derivatives, the PrPres formation was evaluated in ScN2a cells treated for 24 h with 100 nm squalestatin alone or combined with 1–100 μg/ml of water-soluble cholesterol, or with 500 μm of mevalonate. As reported in Table I, mevalonate did not affect the content of PrPres in squalestatin-treated cells. In contrast, the addition of water-soluble cholesterol partially reversed the effect of squalestatin on PrPres production although it was not fully restored even with the higher dose of 100 μg/ml of cholesterol (Table I).Table IEffects of squalestatin, mevalonate, and cholesterol on PrPres production ScN2a cells were treated with 100 nm squalestatin alone or in combination with 500 μm mevalonate or 1–100 μg/ml water-soluble cholesterol. The amounts of PrPres were determined as described.

The PrPres content of SMB cells treated with a vehicle control (7,405 ± 512 PrPres pg/ml) was significantly higher than that of SMB cells treated with 100 nm squalestatin (< 50 pg/ml, n = 8, p < 0.05). Similar results were observed with ScGT1 cells, in that the PrPres content of ScGT1 cells treated with a vehicle control (10,014 ± 845 PrPres pg/ml) was significantly higher than that of ScGT1 cells treated with 100 nm squalestatin (< 50 pg/ml, n = 8, p < 0.05).

https://openalex.org/W2033638305,"The discovery of molecular subtypes of the pathological prion protein PrPSc has provided the basis for a novel classification of human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and a potentially powerful method for strain typing. However, there is still a significant disparity regarding the understanding and nomenclature of PrPSc types. In addition, it is still unknown whether a specific PrPSc type is associated with each TSE phenotypic variant. In sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), five disease phenotypes are known, but only two major types of PrPSc, types 1 and 2, have been consistently reproduced. We further analyzed PrPSc properties in sCJD and variant CJD using a high resolution gel electrophoresis system and varying experimental conditions. We found that pH varies among CJD brain homogenates in standard buffers, thereby influencing the characteristics of protease-treated PrPSc. We also show that PrPSc type 1 and type 2 are heterogeneous species which can be further distinguished into five molecular subtypes that fit the current histopathological classification of sCJD variants. Our results shed light on previous disparities in PrPSc typing, provide a refined classification of human PrPSc types, and support the notion that the pathological TSE phenotype is related to PrPSc structure.

Human diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease, kuru, and fatal insomnia (1Parchi P. Clark C. Trojanowski J.Q.

CJD, by far the most common human TSE, may occur as a sporadic disease of unknown etiology (sCJD), a disease associated with mutations in the prion protein gene (PRNP), or a proven exogenous infection. The latter group includes variant CJD (vCJD) a distinct disease phenotype that is believed to have been transmitted from cattle to humans through the consumption of contaminated meat (3Ironside J.W. Head M.W. Will R.G. Dickson D. Neurodegeneration: The Molecular Pathology of Dementia and Movement Disorders. ISN Neuropath Press, 2003: 310-317Google Scholar). The cellular prion protein (PrPc), a host-encoded, copper- and membrane-bound glycoprotein of unknown function, has a key role in TSE pathogenesis (4Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5101) Google Scholar). There is no agent replication or transmission of infectivity in the absence of PrPc expression (5Büeler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). Moreover, an abnormal, partially protease-resistant isoform (PrPSc) of PrPc specifically accumulates in the nervous system during infection and represents the hallmark of the disease (4Prusiner S.B.

Science. 1982; 218: 1309-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The conversion of PrPc to PrPSc is a posttranslational event associated with an increase in β-sheet secondary structure in the protein (7Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D.

In scrapie transmitted to mice, the most extensively studied TSE, the strain of the agent and the host genotype variability determined by polymorphisms in the coding region of PRNP are the major determinants of disease phenotype (10Bruce M.E. McConnell I. Fraser H. Dickinson A.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Different prion strains transmit diseases to syngenic animals that differ in topography, type of lesion, and intracerebral distribution of PrPSc. In humans, disease susceptibility and phenotypic expression are influenced by PRNP mutations and by the polymorphism at codon 129 that encodes either methionine (M) or valine (V) (11Palmer M.S.

Although uncertainties remain on the molecular basis of TSE strains and the relationship between strains and PrP, several lines of evidence indicate that PrPSc exists in a variety of molecular subtypes showing differences in conformation, glycosylation, protease resistance, and aggregation state (15Telling G.C.

Furthermore, evidence from transmission studies indicates that the different PrPSc types showing distinct physicochemical properties represent genuine biochemical signatures of individual strain-host genotype interactions. Because the analysis of biochemical properties of PrPSc is much less time-consuming than bioassays in mice, unraveling the physicochemical properties of PrPSc associated with each TSE strain or phenotype (i.e. PrPSc “typing”) has undoubtedly become of crucial importance for strain typing and molecular classification of TSEs, with wide implications for both disease diagnosis and epidemiologic surveillance.

Type 1 has a relative molecular mass of 21 kDa and the primary cleavage site at residue 82, and type 2 has a relative molecular mass of 19 kDa and the primary cleavage at residue 97. In other studies, however, the PrPSc type 1 from codon 129 MM subjects was further distinguished into 2 subtypes showing a less than a 1-kDa difference in mobility (26Wadsworth J.D.F. Hill A.F.

In contrast, the two putative PrPSc subtypes described by Zanusso et al. (27Zanusso G. Farinazzo A. Fiorini M. Gelati M. Castagna A. Righetti P.G. Rizzuto N. Monaco S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40377-40380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), also named types 1 and 2 although not comparable with those of Wadsworth et al. (26Wadsworth J.D.F. Hill A.F. Joiner S. Jackson G.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), would represent two distinct protein conformations because of a different response to pH variations (i.e. one conformation is pH-dependent; the other is not). The rationale for the study of the effect of metal ions and pH on PrPSc properties lies in the finding that the octapeptide repeat PrPc sequence between residues 51 and 91 is a Cu 2+ binding motif that changes its conformation in the presence of copper and that this copper binding stoichiometry is pH-dependent (31Miura T.

In previous studies on PrPSc typing in sCJD, we also reported a certain degree of heterogeneity within both type 1 and type 2 samples, particularly among type 1 samples from codon 129 MM subjects (23Parchi P. Capellari S. Chen S.G. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Kopp N. Brown P. Kitamoto T. Tateishi J. Giese A. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 386: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 24Parchi P.

However, these were subtle biochemical differences compared with the type 1/type 2 difference in relative molecular mass and failed to show a consistent reproducibility or a correlation with the disease pathological phenotype, suggesting that they might be related to the experimental conditions rather than to intrinsic differences in strains. For example, it is noteworthy that the various protocols that have been applied to define PrPSc properties to date included the use of PK well outside its optimal conditions (i.e. pH optimum above 7.5; optimum temperature above 37 °C) (33Ebeling W. Hennrich N. Klockow M. Metz H. Orth H.D. Lang H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 34Naureckiene S. Ma L. Sreekumar K. Purandare U. Lo C.F. Huang Y.

Biophys. 2003; 420: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and, above all, were not standardized with respect to variables that might affect its activity. On the other hand, the characterization of at least five distinct pathological sCJD subtypes (9Parchi P. Giese A. Capellari S Brown P. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Windl O. Zerr I. Budka H. Kopp N. Piccardo P. Poser S. Rojiani A. Streichemberger N. Julien J. Vital C. Ghetti B. Gambetti P. Kretzschmar H. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar) argues for the existence of more than two prion strains and two PrPSc types. Thus, it is conceivable that the application of more sensitive techniques and more rigorous experimental conditions will lead to the distinction between potential artifacts related to sample preparation and disease-specific biochemical differences suitable for a refined classification of CJD PrPSc types. To reach this goal, shed light on the current PrPSc typing controversies, and further contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis of TSE strains and phenotypic variability, we examined the effect of different experimental conditions on the characteristics of PrPSc fragments associated with the sCJD subtypes and vCJD using a high resolution gel electrophoresis system. Particular emphasis has been given to the study of the interplay between the effects of homogenate pH and PK concentration/activity. Patients and Tissues—We studied 75 sCJD cases and 4 vCJD cases phenotypically characterized in regard to clinical and histopathological features, pattern of PrP deposition, PRNP genotype, and Western blot profile of PrPSc. Sporadic CJD subtypes were classified according to Parchi et al. (9Parchi P. Giese A. Capellari S Brown P. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Windl O. Zerr I. Budka H. Kopp N. Piccardo P. Poser S. Rojiani A.

They included 40 MM1, 5 MV1, 10 VV2, 10 MV2, 5 VV1, and 5 MM2-cortical. Brain tissues were obtained at autopsy and were kept frozen at -80 °C until use. Brain samples used were from the frontal cerebral cortex, usually the middle frontal gyrus. In 5 MM1 cases tissue was also obtained from the putamen, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Molecular Genetics—Genomic DNA was extracted from blood or frozen brain tissue. Genotyping of the PRNP coding region was performed as described (9Parchi P. Giese A. Capellari S Brown P. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Windl O. Zerr I. Budka H. Kopp N. Piccardo P. Poser S. Rojiani A. Streichemberger N. Julien J. Vital C. Ghetti B. Gambetti P. Kretzschmar H. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Sample Preparation and pH Measurement—Brain homogenates (10%, w/v) were prepared on ice in the following conditions: 1) lysis buffer (LB) (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris); 2) lysis buffer with 100 mm Tris (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 100 mm Tris); 3) PBS (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline lacking MgCl2 and CaCl2 (0.2 g/liter KH2PO4, 8.0 g/liter NaCl, 1.15 g/liter Na2HPO4, 0.2 g/liter KCl); 4) PBS with a 10-fold increase in phosphate salt concentration (2.0 g/liter KH2PO4, 8.0 g/liter NaCl, 11.5 g/liter Na2HPO4); 5) PBS with a 10-fold increase in phosphate salt concentration (2.0 g/liter KH2PO4, 8.0 g/liter NaCl, 11.5 g/liter Na2HPO4) and the addition of a detergent (1% Sarkosyl or 1% Nonidet P-40); 6) citrate-phosphate buffer. According to their pKa values, PBS buffers were prepared between pH 5.5 and 8.0, lysis buffers were prepared between at pH 6.7 and 8.0, and the citrate-phosphate buffer was prepared at pH 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5. Because the pH of Tris buffers changes significantly according to the buffer temperature, the lysis buffers were titrated to the desired pH value at 37 °C (i.e. the temperature at which protease digestion is performed). Because sodium deoxycholate is known to precipitate at acidic pH (around 6.3) it was not used at pH values lower than 6.5. Experiments exploring the influence of EDTA on PK digestion were performed using 250 mm EDTA stock solutions at pH 7.0 or 8.0. Samples were treated at 37 °C with PK (20 units/mg, Roche Diagnostics), chymotrypsin (1500 units/mg from bovine pancreas; Calbiochem), or cathepsin L (6500 milliunits/mg, 1.1 mg/ml from bovine kidney; Calbiochem) using various concentration/incubation time combinations (concentration range for PK, 7-10,000 μg/ml; incubation time range for PK, 1-15 h). PK stock solutions (10 mg/ml or higher) were prepared in storage buffer (50% glycerol, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.9 mg/ml CaCl2). Small aliquots were prepared and stored at -20 °C. For each experiment a new aliquot was used. Protease digestion was terminated by the addition of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The pH of tissue homogenates was measured in duplicate using a needle electrode (Hamilton). Western Blot—10% brain homogenates were resuspended in sample buffer (final concentration: 3% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8) and boiled for 8 min before loading. Protein samples (brain tissue equivalent to 0.2-1 mg wet tissue) were separated in 12 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (37.5:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) using gel electrophoresis apparatus holding running gels of different lengths (5.5 or 15 cm) (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore) for 2 h at 60V, blocked with 10% nonfat milk in Tween Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and probed with the appropriate antibody. The monoclonal 3F4 (1:50,000), which binds PrP between residues 108 and 111 (35Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used as primary antibody. The immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) on Kodak BioMax Light films (Eastman Kodak Co.). The Effect of Gel Resolution—To examine the gel mobility of human PrPSc type 1 in more detail than in previous studies we compared the Western blot profiles obtained in 12% Tris-glycine PAGE gels 5.5 cm long (gels commonly used for PrPSc-typing analysis) with those obtained using longer gels (15 cm). In the latter condition, PrPSc extracted from sCJD MM1 showed a more significant heterogeneity. This related either to the number of bands or to the electrophoretic mobility of the most represented bands (Fig. 1, a and b). The Effect of pH—When we compared MM1 samples prepared in LB pH 7.4 with those homogenized in LB pH 8.0 we noticed a higher heterogeneity in gel migration in the first condition (Fig. 1). This observation prompted us to measure the pH of the homogenates. Samples prepared using standard PBS or lysis buffer at pH 7.4 (i.e. buffers that have been used to date for PrPSc-typing studies) showed unexpected heterogeneous pH values ranging from 6.48 to 7.46 (Table I). Similar pH variations were also detected in homogenates prepared from different areas of the same brain (Fig. 2). Homogenates prepared in water were obviously even more acidic (Table I). Interestingly, there was a significant correlation between the pH value of the homogenate and the immunoblot profile of each type 1 sample (Fig. 1). This was also true for samples obtained from different areas of the same brain (Fig. 2). Thus, samples from the same brain may also show a certain degree of heterogeneity in brain homogenate pH as well as electrophoretic mobility of PrPSc core fragments.Table IFrontal cortex homogenate pH values in different buffer conditions (mean ± S.D.)H2OLBLB 100, pH 7.4PBS, pH 7.4pH 7.4pH 8.0MM16.14 ± 0.23 (range 5.86-6.55)6.87 ± 0.21 (range 6.48-7.46)7.80 ± 0.14 (range 7.56-8.04)7.40 ± 0.06 (range 7.36-7.45)6.63 ± 0.23 (range 6.24-6.99)n = 11n = 35n = 17n = 9n = 8sCJD, (all)6.07 ± 0.29 (range 5.43-6.55)6.92 ± 0.19 (range 6.48-7.46)n = 30a11 MM1, 1 MM2, 9 VV2, 9 MV2.n = 69b35 MM1, 3 MM2, 6 VV1, 15 VV2, 10 MV2.a 11 MM1, 1 MM2, 9 VV2, 9 MV2.b 35 MM1, 3 MM2, 6 VV1, 15 VV2, 10 MV2. Open table in a new tab To analyze in detail the effect of the homogenate pH on the characteristics of PrPSc fragments generated by PK digestion, we had to stabilize the pH of the homogenate at the desired value. To this aim, we raised the buffer capacity of the lysis buffer, PBS, and citrate-phosphate buffer solutions and obtained the desired effect by increasing 10-fold either the Tris and the phosphate or citrate-phosphate salt concentration. We found that in sCJD MM1 cases the immunoblot profile of the PrPSc core fragments generated by PK digestion in standard conditions (100 μg/ml at 37 °C for 1 h) varied significantly according to the homogenate pH and showed a shift in gel mobility between pH 6.0 and 8.0 (Fig. 3). At a pH between 6.0 and 6.7 the protein resolved in four distinct fragments. By increasing the pH values of the homogenate we obtained a progressive disappearance of the slowest migrating peptides associated with a parallel increase in the amount of the fastest migrating fragments together with the appearance around pH 7.2 of a novel fragment that migrated even faster. Finally, an additional (6th) slower migrating fragment was detected after digestion at a very acidic pH (5.0-5.5) (Fig. 3), whereas no digestion at all was observed at pH 4.0 (data not shown). Thus, the PrPSc core heterogeneity observed in MM1 subjects using homogenates prepared in standard buffers (LB with 10 mm Tris or standard PBS, pH 7.4), as used in previous studies (9Parchi P.

Nature. 1996; 383: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar), was clearly related to the variability of the homogenate pH (Figs. 1, 2, 3). The Effect of PK Activity—Given that the pH optimum for PK is in the basic pH range, we asked whether the multiple PrPSc fragments generated by protease digestion at acidic pH may be at least in part the consequence of a reduced PK activity. By exposing the samples to different PK concentrations we found that the same heterogeneity among PrPSc fragments generated by PK digestion at various pH values could be obtained by changing the PK concentration at a given pH value. In particular, we observed the appearance of the “ladder effect” on type 1 samples digested at pH 8.0 by progressively decreasing the PK concentration (Fig. 4). Similarly, a complete disappearance of the PrPSc fragments of higher molecular mass that are seen after digestion at acidic pH (6.7) was obtained by increasing the PK concentration 10-15 times (Fig. 4). To determine whether there is also an effect of pH on PrPSc irrespective of its effect on PK activity, we used higher PK concentrations, varying them according to pH to compensate for the change in protease activity and avoid the complete PrPSc digestion. Whereas at pH values below 7.2 PK digestion of PrPSc extracted from sCJD MM1 showed a relative molecular mass of 21 kDa, at pH values higher than 7.3 the protein migrated about 1 kDa faster (Fig. 5). Both fragments were seen at pH 7.2-7.3. All MM1"
https://openalex.org/W2148114181,"Cells undergo a variety of biological responses when placed in hypoxic conditions, including alterations in metabolic state and growth rate. Here we investigated the effect of hypoxia on the ability of myogenic cells to differentiate in culture. Exposure of myoblasts to hypoxia strongly inhibited multinucleated myotube formation and the expression of differentiation markers. We showed that hypoxia reversibly inhibited MyoD, Myf5, and myogenin expression. One key step in skeletal muscle differentiation involves the up-regulation of the cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 as well as the product of the retinoblastoma gene (pRb). Myoblasts cultured under hypoxic conditions in differentiation medium failed to up-regulate both p21 and pRb despite the G<sub>1</sub> cell cycle arrest, as evidenced by p27 accumulation and pRb hypophosphorylation. Hypoxia-dependent inhibition of differentiation was associated with MyoD degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. MyoD overexpression in C2C12 myoblasts overrode the differentiation block imposed by hypoxic conditions. Thus, hypoxia by inducing MyoD degradation blocked accumulation of early myogenic differentiation markers such as myogenin and p21 and pRb, preventing both permanent cell cycle withdraw and terminal differentiation. Our study revealed a novel anti-differentiation effect exerted by hypoxia in myogenic cells and identified MyoD degradation as a relevant target of hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2008328122,Anisotropic particles suspended in a nematic liquid crystal disturb the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules and experience small forces that depend on the particles' orientation. We have measured these forces using magnetic nanowires. The torque on a wire and its orientation-dependent repulsion from a flat surface are quantitatively consistent with theoretical predictions based on the elastic properties of the liquid crystal. These forces can also be used to manipulate submicrometer-scale particles. We show that controlled spatial variations in the liquid crystal's alignment convert the torque on a wire to a translational force that levitates the wire to a specified height.
https://openalex.org/W2054576371,"The Wilson's disease protein (WNDP) is a copper-transporting ATPase regulating distribution of copper in the liver. Mutations in WNDP lead to a severe metabolic disorder, Wilson's disease. The function of WNDP depends on Atox1, a cytosolic metallochaperone that delivers copper to WNDP. We demonstrate that the metal-binding site 2 (MBS2) in the N-terminal domain of WNDP (N-WNDP) plays an important role in this process. The transfer of one copper from Atox1 to N-WNDP results in selective protection of the metal-coordinating cysteines in MBS2 against labeling with a cysteine-directed probe. Such selectivity is not observed when free copper is added to N-WNDP. Similarly, site-directed mutagenesis of MBS2 eliminates stimulation of the catalytic activity of WNDP by the copper-Atox1 complex but not by free copper. The Atox1 preference toward MBS2 is likely due to specific protein-protein interactions and is not due to unique surface exposure of the metal-coordinating residues or higher copper binding affinity of MBS2 compared with other sites. Competition experiments using a copper chelator revealed that MBS2 retained copper much better than Atox1, and this may facilitate the metal transfer process. X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the isolated recombinant MBS2 demonstrated that this sub-domain coordinates copper with a linear biscysteinate geometry, very similar to that of Atox1. Therefore, non-coordinating residues in the vicinity of the metal-binding sites are responsible for the difference in the copper binding properties of MBS2 and Atox1. The intramolecular changes that accompany transfer of a single copper to N-WNDP are discussed.

The Atox1 preference toward MBS2 is likely due to specific protein-protein interactions and is not due to unique surface exposure of the metal-coordinating residues or higher copper binding affinity of MBS2 compared with other sites. Competition experiments using a copper chelator revealed that MBS2 retained copper much better than Atox1, and this may facilitate the metal transfer process. X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the isolated recombinant MBS2 demonstrated that this sub-domain coordinates copper with a linear biscysteinate geometry, very similar to that of Atox1. Therefore, non-coordinating residues in the vicinity of the metal-binding sites are responsible for the difference in the copper binding properties of MBS2 and Atox1. The intramolecular changes that accompany transfer of a single copper to N-WNDP are discussed. Copper is essential for cell growth and development as a cofactor of cytochrome c oxidase, copper,zinc-dependent superoxide dismutase, ceruloplasmin, lysyl oxidase, and other important metabolic enzymes. However, abnormally elevated copper disrupts cell metabolism, presumably by stimulating the production of reactive oxygen species. Toxic effects of copper are evident in patients with Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder characterized by accumulation of copper in tissues and severe hepatic and neurological problems (1Loudianos G. Gitlin J.D. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To regulate the intracellular copper concentration, cells have developed a sophisticated network of copper-trafficking proteins that includes the copper-transporting ATPases and metallochaperones (2Harrison M.D. Jones C.E. Solioz M. Dameron C.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 29-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 3O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

The Wilson's disease protein (WNDP) 1The abbreviations used are: WNDP Wilson's disease protein; BCA, bicinchoninic acid; BCS, bathocuproine disulfonate; CPM, 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin; XAS, X-ray absorption spectroscopy; EXAFS, extended X-ray absorption fine structure; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MBS, metal-binding site; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. is a copper-transporting P-type ATPase that plays a key role in copper distribution in the liver, kidney, and the brain. WNDP utilizes the energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport the metal into the secretory pathway for incorporation into such copper-dependent enzymes as ceruloplasmin and to export excess copper from the cell (5Lutsenko S. Petris M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). WNDP and other eucaryotic copper-ATPases are unique among the P-type ATPases because they do not bind copper directly from the cytosol (where the amounts of free copper are extremely low (6Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar)) but receive the metal ion from a small cytosolic protein called a metallochaperone through direct protein-protein interactions (7Lockhart P.J. Mercer J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 8Larin D. Mekios C. Das K. Ross B. Yang A.S. Gilliam T.C. J. Biol.

O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Atox1 (previously known as HAH1) serves as a metallochaperone for WNDP. Several mutations in WNDP originally found in Wilson's disease patients were shown to disrupt the Atox1-WNDP interaction (11Hamza I. Schaefer M. Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13363-13368Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), suggesting that Atox1 is required for WNDP function. In agreement with this prediction, we demonstrated that Atox1 directly transfers copper to WNDP and that copper delivery results in stimulation of the WNDP catalytic activity (9Walker J.M. Tsivkovskii R. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Conversely, apoAtox1 can strip copper from WNDP, leading to inhibition of WNDP (9Walker J.M. Tsivkovskii R. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, Atox1 can regulate the functional activity of WNDP by modulating the amount of copper bound to the protein. Although the role of Atox1 in copper delivery to WNDP seems clear, the molecular details of this intriguing process remain uncertain. WNDP contains a large N-terminal domain (N-WNDP) with six metal binding subdomains (MBS) that have homologous sequences (Fig. 1) and a very similar βαββαβ fold (12Jones C.E. Daly N.L. Cobine P.A. Craik D.J. Dameron C.T. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 143: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Gitschier J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Wood W.I. Fairbrother W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Each MBS includes a conserved GMXCXXC sequence, which is situated in the exposed loop. It has been shown that N-WNDP binds up to six Cu+ ions and that copper is coordinated by the two cysteines of the GMXCXXC sequence (14Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 15DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Sarkar B. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Atox1 contains a similar copper-binding motif, MXCXXC (Fig. 1), and binds one Cu+ per protein (17Hung I.H. Casareno R.L. Labesse G. Mathews F.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1749-1754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 18Ralle M. Lutsenko S. Blackburn N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23163-23170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Atox1 has the same overall fold as the individual copper binding subdomains of N-WNDP (19Wernimont A.K. Huffman D.L. Lamb A.L. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). This similarity in structure and the presence of complimentary charges at the surface of Atox1 and some of the N-terminal MBS of the copper-transporting ATPases led to the suggestion that Atox1 docks to MBS and transfers copper via ligand exchange (13Gitschier J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Wood W.I. Fairbrother W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 19Wernimont A.K. Huffman D.L. Lamb A.L. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 20Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Molteni E. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 255-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The crystallographic structure of Atox1, in which one copper bridges two Atox1 monomers, provides an attractive model for such a copper-transfer intermediate (19Wernimont A.K. Huffman D.L. Lamb A.L. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Despite considerable progress in the structural characterization of Atox1 and individual MBSs, it is still unknown how copper migrates within N-WNDP after transfer from Atox1. In fact, even the first step of this process is poorly understood. For example, we do not know whether Atox1 docks randomly to any MBS and transfers copper with equal efficiency or if there is a specific and unique entry pathway in the N-WNDP for copper. It is also unclear what happens after copper is transferred to N-WNDP. Previous studies demonstrated that although six MBS of N-WNDP are structurally similar, their functions are distinct. MBS5 and MBS6 are important for copper delivery to the intramembrane copper-binding site(s) (21Forbes J.R. Hsi G. Cox D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and appear to control the affinity of these sites for the metal (22Huster D. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32212-32218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast, MBS 1-4 do not affect the affinity of the intramembrane sites but may regulate the access of copper to these sites and modulate the enzyme turnover (22Huster D. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32212-32218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the fragment of N-WNDP including MBS1-4, but not the MBS5- and MBS6-containing fragment, was shown to interact with the copper-bound Atox1 (8Larin D. Mekios C. Das K. Ross B. Yang A.S. Gilliam T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28497-28504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, taken together the experimental data suggest that copper translocation through N-WNDP toward the intramembrane portion is likely to involve several MBS and represent a multistep process. To better understand the molecular mechanism of this process, here we characterized the consequences of the Atox1-mediated transfer of a single copper ion to WNDP. We demonstrate that Atox1 selectively delivers copper to MBS2 and that this step is essential for further migration of copper to the intramembrane copper-binding sites of WNDP. Recombinant Proteins—Expression and purification of Atox1 were carried out using a published protocol (9Walker J.M. Tsivkovskii R. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, the recombinant Atox1 was expressed in Escherichia coli as an intein fusion and purified from a soluble fraction of cell lysate using affinity chromatography on chitin beads (New England Biolabs). After washes with 25 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 (Buffer A), Atox1 was cleaved from the fusion protein and eluted from the resin by incubation with 50 mm dithiothreitol in 25 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.15. The protein was then dialyzed into buffer A and used for copper binding and transfer experiments. The copper-bound form of Atox1 (Cu+-Atox1) was generated by incubation of apoAtox1 with equimolar amount of a copper-glutathione complex as described (9Walker J.M. Tsivkovskii R. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and dialyzed into buffer A. The protein concentration of Cu+-Atox1 was determined by the Bradford assay (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and the amount of bound copper was measured using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (24Brenner A.J. Harris E.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) or atomic absorption spectroscopy (Shimadzu AA-6650G). The typical stoichiometry of the Cu+-Atox1 complex was 0.8-0.95 copper per protein; the reducing state of copper was verified by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The expression and purification of the N-WNDP-maltose-binding protein fusion (abbreviated here as N-WNDP for simplicity) was described previously (14Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Briefly, to maintain solubility, the recombinant N-WNDP fusion was co-expressed with thioredoxin in E. coli and purified using affinity chromatography on amylose resin (New England Biolabs). N-WNDP was washed with buffer A and eluted from the resin with buffer A containing 10 mm maltose. To produce the recombinant metal binding subdomain 2 (MBS2, residues 141-212 of WNDP), the corresponding segment of the ATP7B cDNA was amplified using the following primers: forward, 5′-CATATGCAGGAGGCTGTGGTC-3′; reverse, 5′-GTCGACTTAGCTCTTGATGGCAGC-3′. The primers were designed such that 5′ NdeI and 3′ SalI restriction sites were incorporated into the MBS2 PCR product. The PCR fragment was cloned into the pTYB12 IMPACT expression vector (New England Biolabs) to produce the pTYB12-MBS2 expression plasmid, and the sequence fidelity was verified by automated DNA sequencing. E. coli ER2566 cells were transformed with the pTYB12-MBS2-intein plasmid, and the expression of the MBS2 fusion was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside added to a final concentration of 500 μm at 25 °C for 20 h. The MBS2 was purified from the soluble fraction using the protocol described above for Atox1 and dialyzed into buffer A. The copper-bound form of MBS2 was generated by incubation of apoMBS2 with equimolar amounts of a copper-glutathione complex and dialyzed into 20 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, for copper competition experiments. Copper Transfer Experiments—Before copper transfer experiments, the purified N-WNDP bound to amylose resin was reduced by incubating with 100 μm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (Sigma) for 10 min. After a wash with 3 resin volumes of buffer A, apoAtox1 or Cu+-Atox1 was added and incubated with N-WNDP for 10 min. To remove the chaperone, the resin was washed extensively with 10 volumes of buffer A, and N-WNDP was eluted with buffer A containing 10 mm maltose. The protein concentration and the copper stoichiometry were measured in the eluted samples of N-WNDP as described above. For copper binding in the absence of Atox1, N-WNDP was incubated with increasing concentrations of CuCl2 (Sigma) dissolved in buffer A containing freshly prepared 200 μm ascorbate (Fisher). Under these conditions all copper is present in the reduced form (our data). The time of incubation and subsequent washes and elution steps were the same as for experiments with Cu+-Atox1. Chemical Labeling and Proteolysis of N-WNDP—273 pmol (30 μg) of apo-N-WNDP, N-WNDP preincubated with apoAtox1, or N-WNDP with one copper transferred from Atox1 were incubated with a 50-fold molar excess of the cysteine-directed reagent 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM, Molecular Probes) for 2.5 min in the dark at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with a 10-fold molar excess of β-mercaptoethanol over CPM. The fluorescently labeled N-WNDPs were then proteolyzed with the l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated bovine pancreas trypsin (Sigma) added to protein at a 1:2000 (w/w) ratio for 3 h at room temperature; the reaction was stopped with the addition of 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (ICN Biomedicals) (under these conditions the maltose-binding protein part of the N-WNDP fusion protein is not proteolyzed, but the N-WNDP portion of the fusion is fragmented). The proteolyzed N-WNDP fragments were separated on a 15% Tris-Tricine gel (25Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar), and the separation of the CPM-labeled peptides was monitored under UV light using a Gel-Doc system (Bio-Rad). The protein fragments were then either stained with Coomassie R250 or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) at 185 mA for 40 min in 10% methanol, 10 mm CAPS, pH 11.0, and stained with Coomassie R250. The fluorescent and Coomassie-stained patterns of the peptides from the apo- and copper-bound N-WNDP were compared. For N-terminal sequence analysis, the membrane was rinsed with water and dried; the bands were cut out and submitted to the sequencing facility. Surface labeling of N-WNDP was performed by incubating 273 pmol of apo-N-WNDP with 0, 1, and 2 mol equivalent of CPM in buffer A. The reaction was quenched with β-mercaptoethanol. The labeled samples were then digested with trypsin and analyzed by Tris-Tricine gel electrophoresis as described above. Comparison of the Copper Binding Characteristics of MBS2 and Atox1 Using Competition with the Copper Chelator BCA—Copper-bound Cu+-Atox1 and Cu+-MBS2 were diluted with 20 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, buffer containing freshly prepared 40 μm ascorbate to obtain a 7.5 μm concentration of the copper-containing complex. The proteins were then incubated with increasing concentrations of BCA for 10 min. The formation of the BCA-Cu(I) complex was monitored spectrophotometrically at 562 nm with a Beckman DU 640B spectrophotometer. A solution containing 7.5 μm CuCl2, 40 μm ascorbate, 20 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, was used as a control. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) Data Collection and Analysis—For the XAS experiments the reconstitution of MBS2 with copper was performed in an inert atmosphere using an anaerobic chamber to prevent the oxidation of cysteine residues. Before metal reconstitution, a 10-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol was added to MBS2 on ice, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min. The protein was then dialyzed overnight under argon into a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES and 10% acetonitrile at pH 7.5. Copper was added as a tetra-acetonitrile complex, [(CH3CN)4Cu(I)]PF6, dissolved in the same buffer to an equimolar ratio to the protein. The Cu+-MBS2 was then dialyzed in successive steps of 12 h each against 50 mm HEPES, 10% acetonitrile, pH 7.5; 50 mm HEPES, 5% acetonitrile, pH 7.5; 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The copper content was monitored by atomic flame absorption spectroscopy (Varian AA-5). The protein was then concentrated using a modified ultrafree centrifugation system (Millipore, molecular weight cut-off 3500 Da). Final concentrations were 140 μm in copper and 220 μm in MBS2 with a copper stoichiometry of 0.7. The sample was sealed and stored at -80 °C XAS data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (beamline 9-3, 3.0GeV, 50-100 mA). A bend rhodium-coated mirror positioned upstream of the fully tuned Si220 monochromator was used to cut off all energy above 12 keV. Cu+-MBS2 was analyzed in fluorescence mode using a Canberra 30 element array detector and was cooled down to 10 K using a liquid He flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments). The energy was calibrated by simultaneously measuring a copper metal foil and assigning the first inflection (26Ankudinov A.L. Ravel B. Rehr J.J. Conradson S.D. Phys. Rev. B. 1998; 58: 7565-7576Crossref Scopus (4107) Google Scholar) point of the copper edge to 8980.3 eV. For Cu+-MBS2, 10 scans were collected to k = 12.8 Å-1. Data reduction and analysis were performed using the EXAFSPAK computer suite (27George G.N. EXAFSPAK. Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, Menlo Park, CA1995Google Scholar). Theoretical phase and amplitude functions were calculated using FEFF 8.2 (26Ankudinov A.L. Ravel B. Rehr J.J. Conradson S.D. Phys. Rev. B. 1998; 58: 7565-7576Crossref Scopus (4107) Google Scholar). The inspected raw data were averaged, and the background was subtracted and normalized. The EXAFS data were simulated by curve fitting in the OPT module of EXAFSPAK using a non-linear Marquadt algorithm, where the difference between the experimental and the calculated model is minimized. The following parameters were refined: ΔE0 (a small energy correction at k = 0, ranging from -5 to -20 eV), Ri (the distance between the central absorber and atom i), and σ2 (the Debye-Waller factor, defining the mean square deviation of Ri). A goodness-of-fit (Fw) parameter displayed at the end of each cycle was used to evaluate the merit of the fit. Fw is defined as Fw=∑k6(data-model)2k6(data)2(Eq. 1) Preparation and Expression of mMBS2-WNDP in Insect Cells—The generation of the plasmid encoding the full-length 4.4-kilobase WNDP cDNA (pFastBacDual-wild-type (wt-WNDP) and expression in Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9) was previously described (28Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The WNDP variant of MBS2, where both cysteines within the metal binding motif GMTCQSC were substituted by alanines (mMBS2-WNDP), was generated using overlap PCR with the pFastBacDual-WNDP plasmid as a template. In the first amplification step, two fragments using forward primer (A) 5′-GCCTGGGAACCAGCAATGAAG-3′ and reverse (mutagenesis) primer 5′-CTGACAGCGGACTGGGCGGTCATGCCCTCCACCC-3′ and forward (mutagenesis) primer 5′-GCATGACCGCCCAGTCCGCTGTCAGCTCCATTGAAGG-3′ along with reverse primer (B) 5′-GTCGACTTAGGCTCCATCAGGAAGAGA-3′ were generated. The obtained fragments were then joined in the second PCR amplification step using primers A and B. The resulting product was subcloned into pCR-Blunt II TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and upon digestion with the restriction endonucleases ApaI and AflII, the fragment was inserted into the pFastBacDual-WNDP vector. The presence of the anticipated mutations was verified by automated DNA sequencing. The resulting construct was then incorporated into the bacmid using the Bac-to-Bac kit (Invitrogen) and previously described protocols (28Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). After a 3-day infection with baculovirus, the Sf9 insect cells were harvested, and the total membrane fractions were prepared as previously described (28Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 29Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The protein concentration in the total membrane fraction was determined by Lowry (30Lowry O.J. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Catalytic Phosphorylation of WNDP and mMBS2-WNDP from γ-[32P]ATP upon Incubation with Copper or Cu+-Atox1—Catalytic phosphorylation of WNDP and mMBS2-WNDP was analyzed using a previously described protocol (28Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of total membrane protein was resuspended in 200 μl of 100 μm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, 20 mm bis-Tris propane, pH 7.0, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 and then incubated on ice with 250 μm copper chelator bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS, ICN Biomedicals) for 30 min to inhibit catalytic phosphorylation. The chelator was then removed by centrifugation, and the pellets were washed with 20 mm bis-Tris propane, pH 7.0, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 (phosphorylation buffer). The membranes were resuspended in phosphorylation buffer containing 100 μm ascorbate, 100 μm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride followed by the addition of increasing concentrations of CuCl2 or Cu+-Atox1. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, γ-[32P]ATP (specific activity 25 mCi/μmol) was added to a final concentration of 1 μm, and the reaction was incubated on ice for 4 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of ice-cold 1 mm NaH2PO4 in 50% trichloroacetic acid and then centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g. The protein pellet was washed, resuspended in 40 μl of 5 mm Tris-PO4, pH 5.8, 6.7 m urea, 0.4 m dithiothreitol, 5% SDS and loaded on an acidic 7.5% polyacrylamide gel (31Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid for 10 min and dried on blotting paper. The dried gels were exposed either to the Molecular Imaging screen CS (Bio-Rad) or at -80 °C to Kodak BioMax MS film. The intensity of the bands was quantified using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager GS-525. The dried gels were rehydrated and stained with Coomassie Blue R250, and the amount of protein in the WNDP-related bands was determined by densitometry. The incorporation of 32P into WNDP was normalized to the WNDP protein levels. The Atox1-mediated Transfer of Copper to N-WNDP Selectively Protects Cysteines in MBS2 against Labeling with CPM—Previously, we demonstrated that Atox1 transferred copper to N-WNDP, stimulating the catalytic activity of WNDP (9Walker J.M. Tsivkovskii R. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To better understand the molecular details of this process, we sought to determine whether Cu+-Atox1 delivered copper to a specific site on N-WNDP. Our approach is outlined in Fig. 2A. Apo-N-WNDP was incubated either with Cu+-Atox1 to transfer one copper (9Walker J.M. Tsivkovskii R. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) or with apoAtox1 as a control. After copper transfer and subsequent removal of Atox1, the cysteine residues in N-WNDP were labeled with the fluorescent reagent CPM. Copper binding to N-WNDP protects the metal-coordinating cysteines in N-WNDP from labeling with CPM (14Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar); therefore, the difference in the intensity of fluorescent labeling can be utilized for identification of the copper-bound MBS. To facilitate identification of the copper-bound MBS we also developed a protocol for limited proteolytic digestion of N-WNDP. MBSs in N-WNDP are thought to be compactly folded subdomains (12Jones C.E. Daly N.L. Cobine P.A. Craik D.J. Dameron C.T. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 143: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Gitschier J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Wood W.I. Fairbrother W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) connected by fairly long linkers (with the exception of MBS5 and MBS6, which are linked by a very short sequence). Therefore, it was expected that under mild conditions, the proteolytic digestion would occur within the linkers, leaving the MBSs intact. Indeed, treatment of labeled N-WNDP with low amounts of trypsin (1:2000 w/w) produced a series of the 8-16-kDa fragments that were stable to proteolysis for a period of about 3 h (the predicted mass for individual MBS without the linker sequence is ∼8 kDa). The tryptic fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis, and the fluorescence intensities of the peptide bands from the apo- and copper-bound N-WNDP were compared (Fig. 2). If Atox1 transfers copper to more than one site in N-WNDP, one would expect to see a partial decrease in fluorescence of several fragments. However, if Atox1 delivers copper to a preferential site, only one band should be protect"

An aberrant activity of TGase 2 has implicated its possible roles in a variety of diseases including age-related cataracts. However, the molecular mechanism by which TGase 2 is activated has not been elucidated. In this report, we showed that oxidative stress or UV irradiation elevates in situ TGase 2 activity. Neither the expression level nor the in vitro activity of TGase 2 appeared to correlate with the observed elevation of in situ TGase 2 activity. Screening a number of cell lines revealed that the level of TGase 2 activation depends on the cell type and also the environmental stress, suggesting that unrecognized cellular factor(s) may specifically regulate in situ TGase 2 activity. Concomitantly, we observed that human lens epithelial cells (HLE-B3) exhibited about 3-fold increase in in situ TGase 2 activity in response to the stresses. The activated TGase 2 catalyzed the formation of water-insoluble dimers or polymers of αB-crystallin, βB2-crystallin, and vimentin in HLE-B3 cells, providing evidence that TGase 2 may play a role in cataractogenesis. Thus, our findings indicate that in situ TGase 2 activity must be evaluated instead of in vitro activity to study the regulation mechanism and function of TGase 2 in biological and pathological processes.

Transglutaminases (TGases) 1The abbreviations used are: TGase, transglutaminase; BP, biotinylated pentylamine; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. are a family of enzymes that mediate the post-translational modification of proteins by catalyzing acyl transfer reaction between the γ-carboxamide group of glutamine residues and the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues or polyamines (1Lornad L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). The calcium-dependent transamidation activity of TGases produces cross-linked protein polymers that are resistant to mechanical stress and proteolytic degradation (2Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Thus, TGases are recognized to play critical roles in the formation of highly insoluble structures such as cornified cell envelope of the terminally differentiated keratinocyte (TGases 1 and 3, fibrin aggregates (coagulation factor XIII), and the post-copulatory plug of rodents (TGase 4) (3Kalinin A. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 117: 3069-3070Google Scholar, 4Takahashi N. Takahashi Y. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TGase 2 exhibits a similar protein structure and catalyzes transamidation reaction following a common mechanism as other TGases (6Liu S. Cerione R. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, TGase 2 is distinguished from other TGases by its widespread expression pattern, GTP hydrolyzing activity, and intracellular distribution. Although TGase 2 is mainly distributed in the cytosol, TGase 2 can translocate into the nucleus by binding to importin-α3 in response to an elevated intracellular calcium concentration (7Lesort M.

Levitt M.L. Lokshin A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A significant portion of TGase 2 is found in the plasma membrane or secreted into the extracellular matrix (9Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 10Akimov S.S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Because of its ability to cross-link proteins at distinct subcellular location, TGase 2 is implicated in a wide range of physiological processes, including apoptosis, cell adhesion, and differentiation (11Melino G. Piacentini M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 430: 59-63Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 12Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3034-3040PubMed Google Scholar). However, the overexpression of TGase 2 did not change cell survival, indicating that the intracellular transamidation activity of TGase 2 is tightly regulated (13Gentile V. Thomazy V. Piacentini M. Fesus L. Davies P.J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The inappropriate cross-linking or polyamination of various proteins within cells may induce pathological consequences. Because TGase 2 catalyzes transamidation of the glutamine residues of amine acceptors, TGase 2 may contribute to the aggregation of huntingtin molecules with the expanded polyglutamine domain in Huntington's disease (14Green H. Cell. 1993; 74: 955-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), the modification of the glutamine-rich gliadin peptides in celiac disease (15Anderson R.P. Degano P. Godkin A.J. Jewell D.P. Hill A.V. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), or the formation of crystallin dimers in age-related cataracts (16Lorand L. Hsu L.K.H. Siefring Jr., G.E. Rafferty N.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1356-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the study of Huntington's disease the administration of cystamine, an inhibitor of TGase, prolonged the survival period of the mouse model (17Karpuj M.V. Becher M.W. Springer J.E. Chabas D. Youssef S. Pedotti R. Mitchell D. Steinman L. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that an aberrant activation of TGase 2 is crucial for some pathologic processes. However, the molecular mechanism by which TGase 2 is activated has not been determined. In this report, we show that oxidative stress or UV irradiation can stimulate the in situ transamidation activity of TGase 2, and the elevated level of activity depends on the cell type and the nature of stress. Among the various cell lines examined, human lens epithelial cells (HLE-B3) were found to be most sensitive to the oxidative stress or UV irradiation. We present some evidence that the activation of intracellular TGase 2 may play a significant role in the development of human cataracts. Cell Culture and Transfection Experiments—Human cancer cell lines, A549 (lung), MCF7 (breast), and K562 (leukemia) cells, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). NIH 3T3 (mouse fibroblast), HeLa (human cervical carcinoma), PC3M (human prostate carcinoma), and Du145 (human prostate carcinoma) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HLE-B3 (human lens epithelial cell line) cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. Penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml), and glutamine (2 mm) were supplemented to all cell culture media. All of the cell lines were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. To investigate the effects of UV irradiation or oxidative stress, the cells (2× 106) were exposed to UVC (UVC-508, ULTRA-LUM Inc.; 100, 200, 300, and 400 J/m2, respectively) or treated with H2O2 (200, 400, 600, and 800 μm, respectively) for various times indicated and maintained in culture until analysis. Cystamine (Sigma) at 0.5 mm was added to culture media to inhibit the TGase 2 activity. Expression of TGase 2 in NIH 3T3 and MCF7 cells was carried out by transfection of pSG5 vector (Stratagene) containing full-length human TGase 2 or control vector using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as previously described (18Jeon J.H. Kim C.W. Shin D.M. Kim K. Cho S.Y. Kwon J.C. Choi K.H. Kang H.S. Kim I.G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transamidation Assays—In vitro TGase 2 activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of [14C] putrescine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) into N,N′-dimethylcasein (Sigma) as previously described (19Jeon J.H. Cho S.Y. Kim C.W. Shin D.M. Kweon J.C. Choi K.H. Park S.C. Kim I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In brief, the cell extracts were prepared by disrupting the cells with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture) followed by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min at 4 °C). The cell extracts in 100 μg were incubated with substrate solution (1 mg of N,N′-dimethylcasein, 500 nCi of [14C] putrescine, 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture) for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 7.5% trichloroacetic acid, and the radioactivity bound to N,N′-dimethylcasein was measured using liquid scintillation counter (Packard Bioscience). The background radioactivity with bovine serum albumin was used as a control. In Situ Transamidation Assays—In situ TGase 2 activity was measured by three different assay methods (18Jeon J.H. Kim C.W. Shin D.M. Kim K. Cho S.Y. Kwon J.C. Choi K.H. Kang H.S. Kim I.G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Jeon J.H. Cho S.Y. Kim C.W. Shin D.M. Kweon J.C. Choi K.H. Park S.C. Kim I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The cells were labeled with 1 mm biotinylated pentylamine (BP; Pierce) for 1 h prior to harvesting, and the cell extracts were prepared by sonication, followed by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min at 4 °C). For solid phase microtiter plate assay, cell extracts (0.2 mg/ml, 50 μl/well) in coating buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA) were added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate (Nunc). In situ TGase 2 activity was evaluated by determining the incorporated BP using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), followed by the reaction with O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma). The assays were quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm on microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). Western blot analysis was performed by subjecting the cell extracts (20–30 μg) to SDS-PAGE using 12% gel, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The proteins incorporated with BP were probed with HRP-conjugated streptavidin, followed by chemiluminescence detection (Pierce). The protein level of TGase 2 or actin was assessed by probing with monoclonal antibodies specific for TGase 2 (20Jeon J.H. Choi K.H. Cho S.Y. Kim C.W. Shin D.M. Kweon J.C. Song K.Y. Park S.C. Kim I.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5273-5282Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or actin (Santa Cruz), respectively. To perform cytochemical analysis, the cells were plated onto glass coverslips placed in a 6-well plate and cultured for 24 h. After exposing to UV at the dosage of 200 J/m2 or treating with H2O2 at 400 μm, the cells were maintained in culture for 12 h. The cells were labeled with 1 mm BP for 1 h prior to fixing with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min, and the cellular membrane was permeabilized by treating with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 30 min, and the extent of biotinylated polyamines incorporated into the cellular proteins was assessed using Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson Laboratory). The cells were visualized and photographed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Bio-Rad). TGase 2-catalyzed Cross-linking of Lens Proteins—In situ TGase assay was carried out by exposing HLE-B3 cells to UV or by treating the cells with H2O2 and then separating the water-soluble and water-insoluble fractions as previously described (21Clement S. Velasco P.T. Murthy S.N. Wilson J.H. Lukas T.J. Goldman R.D. Lorand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7604-7609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, the cell extracts were prepared by sonication in buffer H (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture) and subsequent centrifugation (6,000 × g, 5 min at 4 °C). The extracts were further separated into water-soluble and water-insoluble fractions by centrifugation at 20,000 × g, 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets (water-insoluble fractions) were rinsed twice with buffer H and solubilized by incubating in buffer S (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 6 m urea, 2% SDS, 40 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min at 37 °C. The proteins of each fraction were resolved in 8–12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed with antibodies specific for αB-crystallin (Calbiochem), βB2-crystallin (22Magabo K.S. Horwitz J. Piatigorsky J. Kantorow M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3056-3060PubMed Google Scholar), and vimentin (Santa Cruz), respectively. For cell-free assay of TGase 2-mediated cross-linking, HLE-B3 cells were homogenized by sonication in buffer H, followed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10 min at 4 °C). The cell extracts were incubated with buffer H containing various concentrations of CaCl2 for 2 h at 37 °C. Cystamine at 1 mm or GTP at 100, 200, and 400 μm was added to the reaction mixture. After reaction, the cell extracts were separated into water-soluble and water-insoluble fractions, and each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described earlier. Protein Preparations—Vimentin was produced in BL21 cells as GST fusion protein (pGEX-4T-1; Amersham Bioscience) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose column chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions. A baculovirus expression system (Pharmingen) was employed to produce recombinant TGase 2 according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, protein expression was induced by infecting Sf21 insect cells with baculovirus that contains a full-length human TGase 2 cDNA. Recombinant TGase 2 was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen), and TGase 2 activity was monitored in terms of [14C] putrescine incorporation (19Jeon J.H. Cho S.Y. Kim C.W. Shin D.M. Kweon J.C. Choi K.H. Park S.C. Kim I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The purity of TGase 2 was assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis, followed by Coomassie Blue staining of protein bands. Both bovine α-crystallin and βBL-crystallin were purchased from Sigma, and βBH-crystallin was obtained from Stressgen. Kinetic Experiments—The wells of 96-well microtiter plate were coated with α-crystallin, βBH-crystallin, βBL-crystallin, and vimentin (30 μg/ml, 100 μl/well in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature and then overcoated with 200 μl of 5% bovine serum albumin with PBS for 2 h at room temperature. TGase 2 (0.5 μg/ml) was added to each well, which contained 2–100 μm of BP in 50 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture), and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. To study the effect of calcium or GTP on the kinetics of the above reaction, a predetermined amount of calcium or GTP was added to the reaction mixture to make the desired final concentrations. The progression of reaction was monitored by measuring the amount of incorporated BP using HRP-conjugated streptavidin. Correlation between in Situ TGase2 Activity and the Expression Level of TGase 2—Recently, conflicting results have been reported on the role of transamidation activity of TGase 2 in cellular apoptosis (23Oliverio S. Amendola A. Rodolfo C. Spinedi A. Piacentini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34123-34128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E. Combs C. Zgola M.M. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33582-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To better understand the nature of the transamidation activity of TGase 2, we investigated whether the expression level of TGase 2 positively correlates with its in situ transamidation activity. NIH 3T3 and MCF7 cell lines that express TGase 2 at low levels were employed in the transient transfection study. The expression level of TGase 2 in both cell lines, as shown in Western blot analysis, appeared comparable (Fig. 1A, inset). When the in vitro transamidation activity of the cell lysates was measured by [14C]putrescine incorporation assay, NIH 3T3 cells exhibited a 5-fold increase of transamidation activity compared with the control, whereas MCF7 cells showed no significant changes (Fig. 1A, left panel). Subsequently, we examined the in situ activity of TGase 2 by incubating the respective cells with BP and by measuring the conjugated BP concentration in the cell extracts using well plate assay. Unexpectedly, the in situ transamidation activity was not detectable in both NIH 3T3 and MCF7 cells (Fig. 1A, right panel). These findings indicate that either in vitro or in situ transamidation activity of TGase 2 does not correlate with its expression level. We tested the possibility of artifact in the transfection study by treating MCF7 cells with retinoic acid to induce the expression of TGase 2. Incubation of MCF7 cells with retinoic acid for up to 48 h produced an increase in TGase 2 expression, but the increase correlated neither in vitro nor in situ transamidation activity (data not shown). To further verify that the lack of correlation between the in situ activity and the expression level of TGase 2 may also exist in other cell lines as well, we analyzed the expression and transamidation activity of TGase 2 in various cell lines (Fig. 1B). The in vitro activity of each cell appeared to be correlated with its TGase 2 expression level. By contrast, elevated in situ TGase 2 activity was detectable only in HeLa and Du145 cells but none of the other cell lines examined, irrespective of their TGase 2 expression levels, indicating that the intrinsic in situ TGase 2 activity varies depending on the type of cell (Fig. 1, B and C). To test whether the variance of the observed in situ TGase 2 activity depended upon the transport rate of BP, we measured intracellular BP concentration of each cell line (18Jeon J.H. Kim C.W. Shin D.M. Kim K. Cho S.Y. Kwon J.C. Choi K.H. Kang H.S. Kim I.G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we did not find any significant difference in intracellular BP concentration in the various types of cell examined (data not shown). Activation of Intracellular TGase 2 by Oxidative Stress or UV Irradiation—The apparent absence of in vitro TGase 2 activity in MCF7 cells suggests the existence of cellular factor(s) that may regulate TGase 2 activity. Because TGase 2 expression is up-regulated under hypoxic condition (25Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Harris A.L. Ratcliffe P.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6297-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) or by chemotherapeutics that generate oxygen radical (26Mehta K. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that oxidative stress may affect this regulatory cellular factor(s). We evaluated the effect of oxidative stress on the in situ activity and in vitro activity as well as the expression level of TGase 2 in a variety of cells. When these cells were treated with 200 μm of H2O2 and then maintained in culture for 12 h prior to analysis, no significant change of in vitro TGase 2 activity was observed with all of the cell lines examined (Fig. 2A). However, K562 and HLE-B3 cells showed a 2–3-fold increase of in situ TGase 2 activity compared with that of the untreated cells. Under the experimental conditions employed in these studies, degradation or up-regulation of TGase 2 did not occur according to Western blot analysis. These observations suggest that the elevation of the in situ TGase 2 activity in K562 and HLE-B3 cells may be caused by activation of a latent enzyme. We also investigated the effect of another type of oxidative stress, UV irradiation, on the TGase 2 activity. The cell lines were irradiated with 100 J/m2 of UVC and then maintained in culture for 12 h. Among the cell lines examined, only HeLa and HLE-B3 cells produced a 2–3-fold increase in in situ TGase 2 activity compared with their controls (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that activation of TGase 2 varies depending on cell type and also the type of stress exerted on the cells. We verified with each cell line that the observed change in the in situ TGase 2 activity is not a result of cell viability in response to oxidative stresses (data not shown). Activation of TGase 2 in HLE-B3 Cells—HLE-B3 cells, immortalized human lens epithelial cells, exhibited a significant activation of intracellular TGase 2 in response to either H2O2 treatment or UV irradiation (Fig. 2). These results are of interest, particularly because of the facts that lens epithelial cells are known to differentiate into fiber cells that last throughout the human lifespan and that cross-linking of protein molecules resulting from environmental insult may lead to cataract formation. We examined the dose-response phenomenon between the stress level and the relative in situ TGase 2 activity in HLE-B3 cells. UV-irradiated or H2O2-treated HLE-B3 cells showed a 2–4-fold enhancement in the in situ TGase 2 activity depending on the dose of irradiation or H2O2 concentration (Fig. 3A). The maximum dose of irradiation or the highest concentration of H2O2 tested was 300 J/m2 and 600 μm, respectively. At a higher dose of UV irradiation or H2O2 concentration, the cells began to detach from the culture dish. Thus, the UV dosage of 200 J/m2 and the H2O2 concentration of 400 μm were employed, respectively, for the following experiments. The amount of proteins incorporated with BP catalyzed by TGase 2 increased gradually, reaching the maximum at 12 h and diminishing thereafter (Fig. 3B). This result was subsequently confirmed by Western blot experiment using HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Fig. 3C). Any degradation of TGase 2 during the experiment was not detectable according to Western blot analysis (Fig. 3, A and C). To validate these results further, we repeated the above experiments in the presence of cystamine as an inhibitor to TGase. Fig. 4A showed that the treatment of cystamine to the stressed HLE-B3 cells suppressed the elevated in situ TGase 2 activity to that of the control. This finding was corroborated by Western blot analysis using HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Fig. 4B) and also by cytochemical staining for in situ TGase 2 activity using Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin (Fig. 4C). Cross-linking of Lens Proteins by Activated TGase 2—We investigated the possibility that the TGase 2 activated by either UV irradiation or H2O2 treatment contributes to cross-linking lens proteins. HLE-B3 cells were exposed to UV or H2O2 and maintained in culture for 12 h in the absence or presence of cystamine. The cells were homogenized and separated into water-soluble and water-insoluble fractions. When the proteins were analyzed by Western blot methods using the antibodies specific for αB-crystallin, βB2-crystallin, and vimentin, respectively, new bands corresponding to respective dimeric or polymeric forms of αB-crystallin, βB2-crystallin, and vimentin appeared in the water-insoluble fractions. The apparent dimer or polymer bands were detectable neither in the water-soluble fraction nor in the fractions from cells treated with cystamine (Fig. 5A). Previous in vitro biochemical studies showed that the major structural lens proteins could be cross-linked by the addition of calcium into lens homogenate (16Lorand L. Hsu L.K.H. Siefring Jr., G.E.

To compare our results obtained from in situ assay with those from in vitro cell-free assay, HLE-B3 cell homogenate was incubated in buffer containing either CaCl2 or cystamine. Based on Western blot analysis, the addition of CaCl2 to HLE-B3 cell homogenate produced cross-linking of αB-crystallin, βB2-crystallin, and vimentin (Fig. 5B). These results resemble the effects of oxidative stresses on HLE-B3 cells as described earlier and confirmed that oxidative stresses can promote the formation of water-insoluble polymers of lens proteins by activating intracellular TGase 2. Interestingly, shifting of monomeric forms of αB-crystallin and βB2-crystallin into water-insoluble fraction was noted (Fig. 5). These observations suggest that TGase 2 catalyzes some other types of modification such as polyamination or deamination (1Lornad L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar), leading to a change in their solubility in aqueous buffer. To understand the mechanism for cross-linking among lens proteins, we evaluated the kinetic parameters with which TGase 2 catalyzes the cross-linking reactions of each protein. As shown in Fig. 6A, Km values determined by BP incorporation assay for β-crystallins and vimentin were about 20 μm, whereas the Km value for α-crystallin was 129.9 μm, indicating that β-crystallins and vimentin have higher affinities for TGase 2 than α-crystallin. The degree of calcium dependence for transamidation reaction was evaluated with four lens proteins. The results in Fig. 6B revealed that βL-crystallin is most sensitive to calcium concentration, and α-crystallin is least sensitive protein among the four lens proteins (βL-crystallin > βH-crystallin > vimentin > α-crystallin, in order of decreasing calcium sensitivity). By contrast, GTP was equally effective in inhibiting the catalytic activity of TGase 2 in BP incorporation into four lens proteins (Fig. 6C). TGase 2 is an enzyme with dual function possessing both transamidation and GTP hydrolysis activities. The calcium-dependent transamidation activity of TGase 2 catalyzes ϵ-(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-linking or the polyamination of proteins, which may induce conformational change. Thus, it has been proposed that TGase 2 catalyzes aggregation or polymerization of proteins in various human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease via up-regulation of its expression (29Kim S.Y. Grant P. Lee J.H. Pant H.C. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30715-30721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that intrinsic activity or activation of intracellular TGase 2 is cell type-dependent and that the activity does not correlate with the TGase 2 expression level. Therefore, in addition to Western blot analysis and the in vitro assay of TGase 2, the in situ activity of TGase 2 must be evaluated to establish the causal relationship between elevated expression of TGase 2 and phenotype changes. Previous reports have shown that intracellular TGase 2 is activated by calcium and inhibited by GTP (30Zhang J. Lesort M. Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism that regulates the intracellular TGase 2 activity under physiological conditions has not been elucidated. We present, in this report, the results that demonstrate that in situ TGase 2 activity is increased when cells are exposed to oxidative stress or UV irradiation and that the level of activation appears to be dependent on cell type and the nature of stress. These results suggest that cellular factor(s) that specifically regulate TGase 2 activity in response to oxidative stress may exist. Based on this finding, it may be postulated that TGase 2 activation is involved in the mechanism and/or manifestation of the stress responses. Therefore, identification of the cellular factor that regulates TGase 2 activation and the nature of the proteins modified by TGase 2 under stress conditions would assist in understanding the intracellular functions of TGase 2. The results of this study also have important implications for the role of TGase 2 in age-related cataractogenesis. The epidemiological studies showed positive associations between the prevalence of cataracts and the level of UV exposure (31Cruickshanks K.J. KleinB E.K. Klein R. Am. J. Public Health. 1992; 82: 1658-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Because antioxidant capacity is decreased during the aging process of lens (32Reddy V.N. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), cataract formation may result from inadequate protection of lens proteins from oxidative stress caused by UV exposure. Earlier in vitro studies showed that α-crystallin, β-crystallin, and vimentin could be cross-linked by TGase 2 (16Lorand L. Hsu L.K.H. Siefring Jr., G.E. Rafferty N.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1356-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Clement S. Velasco P.T. Murthy S.N. Wilson J.H. Lukas T.J. Goldman R.D. Lorand L. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In our experiment, UV irradiation on various types of cell produced no significant changes in the expression levels or in in vitro enzymatic activity of TGase 2. However, we showed that UV irradiation activates intracellular TGase 2 of HLE-B3 cells, which promotes the formation of water-insoluble, cross-linked αB-crystallin, βB2-crystallin, and vimentin, respectively. Thus, our results seem to provide a link between the epidemiological results on the role of UV exposure in age-related cataracts and the biochemical evidence that supports cross-linking of proteins as an underlying mechanism of age-related cataracts. It has been postulated that altered levels of ions including a marked increase in calcium may be one of major changes associated with cataractous lens (33Kuck J.F.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, no significant difference in the GTP level was noted between clear and cataractous lens, although GTP level seemed slightly depressed with advancing age (34Deussen A. Pau H. Exp. Eye Res. 1989; 48: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our results show that GTP effectively inhibits the TGase-catalyzed protein cross-linking reaction, which is calcium-dependent. The activation of intracellular TGase 2 may require other cellular changes resulting from oxidative stresses accompanying an increase in calcium concentration. α-Crystallin, a major component of lens fiber and epithelial cells, belongs to the small heat shock protein family that prevent denaturation and aggregation of proteins in cells that are stressed (35Wistow G. FEBS Lett. 1985; 181: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Knockout mice lacking α-crystallin develop lens opacities (36Brady J.P. Garland D. Duglas-Tabor Y. Robison Jr., W.G. Groome A. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), indicating that functional α-crystallin is essential for maintaining transparency of lens. Because αB-crystallin dimer may lose its chaperone-like function and be sequestered into the water-insoluble fraction (27Shridas P. Sharma Y. Balasubramanian D. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), TGase 2-catalyzed dimerization of α-crystallin may be a critical step to initiate protein aggregation. Taken together, the present study provides the first evidence that TGase 2 may play an important role in age-related cataract formation. Furthermore, αB-crystallin expression is reported to be elevated in the neurons of degenerative diseases such as Alexander's disease (37Iwaki T. Kume-Iwaki A. Liem R.K. Goldman J.E. Cell. 1989; 57: 71-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), which is related to protein aggregation. In this context, activation of intracellular TGase 2 in response to oxidative stress is an important issue that merits further investigation with various cell types. We thank Dr. Y. D. Kim for critical comments on the manuscript and Dr. Joseph Horwitz for kindly providing polyclonal antibody against bovine βB2-crystallin."

The translational induction of many maternal mRNAs has been correlated with an increase in mRNA poly(A) tail length. This evolutionarily conserved process, termed cytoplasmic polyadenylation, requires a polyadenylation hexanucleotide sequence (typically AAUAAA) as well as additional 3′-UTR 1The abbreviations used are: 3′-UTR, 3′-untranslated region; CPE, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element; CPEB, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein; PRE, polyadenylation response element; GST; glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MPF, maturation/M-phase- promoting factor; GVBD, germinal vesicle breakdown; nt, nucleotide; RT, reverse transcriptase; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, FGF receptor. regulatory sequences, including cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPE) (10Richter J.D.

Using progesterone-stimulated oocytes from the frog Xenopus laevis, it has been demonstrated that individual mRNAs are polyadenylated and translationally activated at different times following meiotic cell cycle resumption (24Ballantyne S. Daniel D.L.J. Wickens M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1633-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25de Moor C.H. Richter J.D. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 926-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Because all regulated mRNAs hitherto examined contain CPE sequences, the basis of this temporal order of translational activation was unclear. Various mechanisms been proposed to account for both early and late mRNA cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translational activation profiles during progesterone-stimulated meiotic cell cycle progression. These include the precise nucleotide sequence of the CPE, the number of CPEs, and/or the position of the CPEs within the 3′-UTR (24Ballantyne S. Daniel D.L.J. Wickens M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1633-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25de Moor C.H. Richter J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 27Mendez R.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1833-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition, the cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translational activation of maternal mRNAs has been previously classified as being independent of (class I), or dependent on (class II), translation of the mRNA encoding the Mos proto-oncogene (24Ballantyne S. Daniel D.L.J. Wickens M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1633-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25de Moor C.H. Richter J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A generalized understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing the temporal control of maternal mRNA translational activation has been confounded by a number of inconsistencies in assignment of CPE-containing mRNAs to particular classes, as well as differences in temporal regulation within class groups. Furthermore, the conversion of CPEB from a translational repressor to a translational activator appears to occur too late to regulate early mRNA cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translational activation. CPEB conversion involves both Aurora A/Eg2- and cdc2-dependent phosphorylation (28Mendez R. Barnard D. Richter J.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1833-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 29Mendez R. Hake L.E. Andresson T. Littlepage L.E. Ruderman J.V. Richter J.D. Nature. 2000; 404: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Cdc2 activation occurs subsequent to the translational activation of the temporally early Mos mRNA (30Charlesworth A. Ridge J.A. King L.A. MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and although initial studies suggested Aurora A/Eg2 activation occurred early during maturation (29Mendez R. Hake L.E.

Chem. 2003; 278: 2236-2241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have concluded that Eg2 activation is temporally late and perhaps dependent on prior cdc2 activation. The recent identification of a CPE- and CPEB-independent regulatory mechanism that controls the early translational activation of the Mos mRNA (30Charlesworth A. Ridge J.A. King L.A. MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) suggests that CPE- and CPEB-independent regulatory mechanisms may be more generally utilized to generate the range of temporal profiles of maternal mRNA translational activation observed during meiotic cell cycle progression. The limited number of endogenous mRNAs or reporter RNAs that have been studied simultaneously has hampered elucidation of the mechanisms controlling the timing of maternal mRNA translational activation. Moreover, many of the 3′-UTR reporter constructs used previously were not full length thus compromising the generality of the conclusions that could be drawn. To circumvent these prior problems, we have utilized RNA ligation-coupled PCR (35Rassa J.C. Wilson G.M. Brewer G.A. Parks G.D. Virology. 2000; 274: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) from the same oocyte samples to investigate the temporal kinetics of cytoplasmic polyadenylation of multiple endogenous mRNAs during oocyte meiotic maturation. We report that contrary to current dogma, CPE- and CPEB-dependent mechanisms do not control temporally early maternal mRNA polyadenylation and translational activation during Xenopus oocyte maturation. We define a new class of Xenopus maternal mRNAs, which undergo temporally early CPE- and CPEB-independent cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translational activation. We demonstrate that polyadenylation response elements (PREs) present in the 3′-UTRs of early class mRNAs function to direct temporally early cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translational activation. By contrast, the cytoplasmic polyadenylation of CPE- and CPEB-dependent mRNAs is a temporally late event. Our findings suggest that the sequential action of distinct 3′-UTR-directed translational control mechanisms coordinates the complex temporal patterns and extent of protein synthesis during vertebrate meiotic cell cycle progression. DNA Constructs—The 211-nt D7 3′-UTR, the 146-nt G10 3′-UTR, and the 71-nt histone-like B4 3′-UTR were isolated from immature Xenopus oocytes by RT-PCR using primers containing 5′ XbaI sites and 3′ SalI sites and cloned into pGEM GST (9Charlesworth A. Welk J. MacNicol A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 706-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) for polyadenylation and translation studies, or into pGEM4Z (Promega) for RNA EMSAs. It should be noted that the D7 3′-UTR was larger than predicted and was found to encode an additional 21 nucleotides of 3′ sequence not present in the GenBank™ entry, including a canonical AAUAAA polyadenylation hexanucleotide. The histone-like B4 CPE was changed from uuuuuaau to uuuuGGau; the D7 CPEs were changed from uuuuuuaa, uuuuaaca, uuuuuaca, and uuuuuau to uuuuuGGa, uuuGGaca, uuuuGGca, and uuuuGGu; and the G10 CPEs were changed from uuuuaau and uuuuuuau to uuuGGau and uuuuuGGu using QuikChange (Stratagene). The D7 UTR was truncated using standard PCR mutagenesis to remove the two 5′-most CPEs, while leaving the PRE intact (see Fig. 7A for PRE boundary). The PRE in the D7 UTR was deleted by using QuikChange. The B4, D7, and G10 3′-UTR constructs were linearized with SalI prior to in vitro transcription. QuikChange was used to replace β-globin sequence with the histone-like B4 and D7 PREs in pGEM GST β-globin UTR (9Charlesworth A. Welk J. MacNicol A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 706-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), at the respective distance from the polyadenylation hexanucleotide as they are found in their native mRNAs. Because the D7 PRE spans a CPE, the CPE was disrupted as described above to eliminate any possible contribution to cytoplasmic polyadenylation. pGEM GST CPEB-AA construction and RNA transcription have been described before (30Charlesworth A. Ridge J.A. King L.A. MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). pGEM GST XeCPEB has been described (9Charlesworth A. Welk J. MacNicol A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 706-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Oocyte Isolation, Culture, Microinjection, and Lysate Preparation— Xenopus oocyte isolation and culture has been described previously (36Machaca K. Haun S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Oocytes were induced to mature with 2 μg/ml progesterone, and pools of 5 or 6 oocytes were taken at the indicated times. Where synthetic RNA constructs were injected, collection of immature controls was performed in concert with time-matched progesterone-stimulated samples. Germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) was used as an indicator of maturation and assessed by the presence of a white spot on the animal pole. Where indicated, oocytes were segregated at the time when 50% of the oocyte population had reached GVBD (GVBD50) based on whether they had (+) or had not (-) completed GVBD. RNA was transcribed in vitro with SP6 and injected at concentrations described previously (9Charlesworth A. Welk J. MacNicol A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 706-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). RNA and protein were extracted from the same pool of oocytes (30Charlesworth A. Ridge J.A. King L.A. MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test) (3Howard E.L. Charlesworth A. Welk J. MacNicol A.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Polyadenylation Assays—RNA ligation-coupled RT-PCR (see Fig. 1A) was a modified version of the technique described previously (35Rassa J.C. Wilson G.M. Brewer G.A. Parks G.D. Virology. 2000; 274: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 4 μg of total oocyte RNA, from pools of 5 or 6 oocytes, was ligated to 0.4 μg of P1 anchor primer (35Rassa J.C. Wilson G.M. Brewer G.A. Parks G.D. Virology. 2000; 274: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), in a 10-μl reaction using T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's directions. The whole 10-μl RNA ligation reaction was used in a 50-μl reverse transcription reaction using Superscript III (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer's directions using 0.4 μg of P1′ as the reverse primer (35Rassa J.C. Wilson G.M. Brewer G.A. Parks G.D. Virology. 2000; 274: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 1 μl of this cDNA preparation was used in each 50-μl PCR using Platinum Taq (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's directions. PCR was performed for 40 cycles, using a 56 °C annealing temperature and 1.5 mm final concentration of Mg2+, except the FGFR1 reaction which required 2.5 mm Mg2+. The specific primers used were designed to be 70–110 nucleotides from the poly(A) addition site according to sequence information available in GenBank™, and the accession numbers are as follows: X13855 (B4 mRNA for histone H1-like protein); XLD7 (maternal mRNA D7); Z17206 (Aurora A/Eg2); U24491 (FGF receptor 1); XLG10 (maternal G10 mRNA); X13311 (p39mos); J03166 (cyclin B1); AJ304991 (cyclin B4); U13962 (Xe-Wee1A); X53745 (cyclin A1); and M24769 (cytoskeletal actin type 5). The primers used are as follows: histone-like B4, AGT GAC AAA CTA GGC TGA TAT ACT; cyclin A1, CAT TGA ACT GCT TCA TTT TCC CAG; cyclin B1, GTG GCA TTC CAA TTG TGT ATT GTT; cyclin B4, CAT AGG ACA CTT GTT ATA TTG TAG; D7, TGT TGT GAA GTT GCC ATT TAG TAT; Aurora A/Eg2, GTT TCA ATC TTG TAT GTC CTT TTA; FGFR1, TTT GCT ATG TTT TCA GTT TGT ATT; G10, TAA GGC CGG CGA CTG AAA TTG TGT; Mos, GTT GCA TTG CTG TTT AAG TGG TAA; and Wee1, GGC CTG GAC AAA AAC TTT ATA ATT. To verify that an increase in PCR product size in stimulated oocytes is indicative of extension of the poly(A) tail, treatment of the initial RNA samples with oligo(dT) and RNase H (to degrade all poly(A) tails (3Howard E.L. Charlesworth A. Welk J. MacNicol A.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) prior to RNA ligation with the P1 DNA oligonucleotide) did reduce the size of the PCR product in progesterone-treated samples to a size comparable with that from immature oocyte samples (data not shown). Direct sequencing of representative PCR products also confirmed the increase in PCR product size observed in progesterone-stimulated oocytes was due to poly(A) tail extension. RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—The amount of GST and GST-XeCPEB protein expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysates was normalized prior to use, and the RNA EMSAs were performed as described previously (9Charlesworth A. Welk J. MacNicol A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 706-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The histone-like B4 and truncated D7 probes were run on 3.75% acrylamide gels, the G10 on a 3.5% gel, and the full-length D7 probe on a 3.25% gel. GST Reporter mRNA Translation Assays—To measure the effect of wild-type and mutant 3′-UTRs on GST reporter mRNA translation, GST accumulation was visualized and quantitated by ECL Western blotting as described previously (9Charlesworth A. Welk J. MacNicol A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 706-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Charlesworth A. Ridge J.A. King L.A. MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using ChemiGlow West, a ChemiImager 5500 and AlphaEaseFC software (AlphaInnotech Corp.). To address the role of CPEs and CPEB in the control of maternal mRNA cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translational activation, we performed a comparative study of the polyadenylation of multiple endogenous mRNAs from the same sample sets utilizing an RNA ligation-coupled PCR technique (35Rassa J.C. Wilson G.M. Brewer G.A. Parks G.D. Virology. 2000; 274: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, a DNA oligonucleotide (P1) is ligated directly onto the 3′ end of all the RNAs in the sample preparation (Fig. 1A, step 1). An antisense DNA oligonucleotide (P1′), complementary to the RNA-ligated P1 oligonucleotide, is then used as a primer for reverse transcription (Fig. 1A, step 2). From this pool of cDNAs, the polyadenylation status of individual mRNAs was assessed by PCR using a gene-specific forward primer and the P1′ reverse primer (Fig. 1A, step 3) enabling a large number of endogenous mRNAs to be analyzed from the same sample preparation. Because we have shown previously that the Mos mRNA undergoes temporally early CPE- and CPEB-independent translational activation (30Charlesworth A. Ridge J.A. King L.A. MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we wished to determine which Xenopus maternal mRNAs undergo similar temporally early cytoplasmic polyadenylation in progesterone-stimulated oocytes. 11 maternal mRNAs were analyzed utilizing the RNA ligation-coupled PCR technique from the same total RNA sample preparations (Fig. 1B). We identify two classes of maternal mRNAs based on the timing of their induced polyadenylation profiles, designated herein as early (where polyadenylation is initiated 2–3 h prior to oocyte germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), a marker of meiotic cell cycle progression) and late (where polyadenylation is initiated either 1 h before, or coincident with, GVBD). The early class of mRNAs include histone-like B4, D7, Eg2, FGFR1, G10, and Mos and consistently undergo coordinated initiation of polyadenylation 2–3 h prior to GVBD in oocytes from all animals tested. The polyadenylation of these mRNA populations occurs in a stepwise fashion up until GVBD, at which time the mRNA populations achieve maximal poly(A) tail length. The late class of mRNAs include cyclin B1, cyclin B4, Wee1, and cyclin A1. The mRNA populations of the late class mRNAs behave heterogeneously in terms of when polyadenylation is initiated for oocytes from any given animal. Generally, late class polyadenylation occurred coincident with or after GVBD. However, in some animals (as represented in Fig. 1B) some late class mRNA polyadenylation can be observed up to 1 h prior to GVBD, although this initiation occurred later than that seen with the early class mRNAs, and the entire population of each late class mRNA does not become fully polyadenylated until GVBD. Indeed, whereas cyclin A1 polyadenylation occurs predominantly after GVBD (Fig. 1B, open triangle), a proportion of the cyclin B1, B4, and Wee1 mRNA populations were polyadenylated an hour prior to GVBD (Fig. 1B, open boxes). In all animals examined so far, initiation of cyclin A1 polyadenylation was always the last to occur. The cytoskeletal actin mRNA, which lacks CPE sequences in the 3′-UTR, is utilized as a control (Fig. 1B, actin type 5) because it is not polyadenylated in response to progesterone stimulation and is deadenylated at GVBD (26Sheets M.D. Fox C.A. Hunt T. Vande Woude G. Wickens M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 926-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The timing of maternal mRNA polyadenylation characterized here generally agrees with previous studies that have reported that histone-like B4, G10, D7, FGF receptor 1, and Mos are early (11Fox C.A.

Hunt T. Vande Woude G. Wickens M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 926-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, this is the first time it has been shown that the early endogenous mRNAs undergo coordinate initiation. The timing of cyclin B4 and Aurora A/Eg2 mRNA cytoplasmic polyadenylation has not been established previously. Because the temporally early polyadenylation of the Mos mRNA occurs in a CPEB-independent manner (30Charlesworth A. Ridge J.A. King L.A. MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we next wished to determine whether Aurora A/Eg2-mediated CPEB phosphorylation was necessary for the progesterone-stimulated cytoplasmic polyadenylation of the other members of the temporally early class of maternal mRNAs. To this end we employed the expression of a dominant negative form of CPEB (CPEB-AA) (29Mendez R. Hake L.E. Andresson T. Littlepage L.E. Ruderman J.V. Richter J.D. Nature. 2000; 404: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) that has alanine residue substitutions in the Aurora A/Eg2 consensus phosphorylation sites. We demonstrate that in addition to the Mos mRNA, the mRNAs encoding histone-like B4, D7, Aurora A/Eg2, FGFR1, and G10 undergo progesterone-stimulated polyadenylation in the presence of CPEB-AA. It should be noted, however, that the expression of CPEB-AA reduced the overall length of progesterone-stimulated poly(A) tail extension (Fig. 2). Because the reduced poly(A) tail still allows for PRE-directed translational activation of the Mos mRNA in CPEB-AA expressing oocytes (30Charlesworth A. Ridge J.A. King L.A. MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), it is likely that the reduced poly(A) tail added to the histone-like B4, D7, Aurora A/Eg2, FGF receptor 1, and G10 mRNAs is sufficient for translational activation. By contrast, polyadenylation of the cyclin B1 (30Charlesworth A. Ridge J.A. King L.A. MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), cyclin B4, cyclin A1, and Wee1 mRNAs was completely abolished in CPEB-AA expressing oocytes (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that there are distinct CPEB-independent and CPEB-dependent classes of Xenopus maternal mRNAs. The CPEB-independent class corresponds to the temporally early mRNAs, whereas the CPEB-dependent class correlates with the temporally late mRNAs shown in Fig. 1. As noted in the Introduction, the sequence, number, and/or position of CPEs have been proposed previously to encode the temporal polyadenylation characteristics of maternal mRNAs. Although there is some variability in precise sequence, Xenopus CPE sequences generally conform to the consensus U4–5A1–3U and function up to 100 nucleotides 5′ of the polyadenylation hexanucleotide (10Richter J.D. Sonenberg N. Hershey J. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 785-805Google Scholar, 39Richter J.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 446-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A terminal U is not always required for CPE function because UUUUAACA has been implicated in cyclin B1 repression (22Barkoff A.F. Dickson K.S. Gray N.K. Wickens M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We find no apparent correlation between temporally early or late class mRNAs and a specific CPE sequence. Indeed, the different CPE sequence permutations (e.g. UUUUAU, UUUUUAAU, and UUUUAACA) can be found in both early and late class mRNAs analyzed in this study (Fig. 3). We also found no general correlation between temporally early or late class mRNAs and CPE number because both classes contain mRNAs with one or more CPEs (Fig. 3). However, CPE position did appear to correlate with the classification of temporally late mRNAs analyzed because they all contain a CPE in the 3′-UTR that overlaps the polyadenylation hexanucleotide. Because the temporally early mRNAs examined herein do contain one or more CPE sequences but none of the CPEs overlap the polyadenylation hexanucleotide, we next wanted to test whether CPE sequences 5′ of the polyadenylation hexanucleotide were responsible for the cytoplasmic polyadenylation of the early class of mRNAs. The full-length 3′-UTRs of histone-like B4, D7, and G10 mRNAs were isolated from Xenopus oocytes, and the consensus CPE sequences in each 3′-UTR were mutationally disrupted with dinucleotide substitutions (Fig. 4A). To verify that the mutations had indeed disrupted the CPEs, the binding to CPEB in v"
https://openalex.org/W1992138517,"Abstract The structural natures of stable analogues for the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme (E2P) of Ca2+-ATPase formed in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, i.e. the enzymes with bound beryllium fluoride (BeF·E2), bound aluminum fluoride (AlF·E2), and bound magnesium fluoride (MgF·E2), were explored and compared with those of actual E2P formed from Pi without Ca2+. Changes in trinitrophenyl-AMP fluorescence revealed that the catalytic site is strongly hydrophobic in BeF·E2 as in E2P but hydrophilic in MgF·E2 and AlF·E2; yet, the three cytoplasmic domains are compactly organized in these states. Thapsigargin, which was shown in the crystal structure to fix the transmembrane helices and, thus, the postulated Ca2+ release pathway to lumen in a closed state, largely reduced the tryptophan fluorescence in BeF·E2 as in E2P, but only very slightly (hence, the release pathway is likely closed without thapsigargin) in MgF·E2 and AlF·E2 as in dephosphorylated enzyme. Consistently, the completely suppressed Ca2+-ATPase activity in BeF-treated vesicles was rapidly restored in the presence of ionophore A23187 but not in its absence by incubation with Ca2+ (over several millimolar concentrations) at pH 6, and, therefore, lumenal Ca2+ is accessible to reactivate the enzyme. In contrast, no or only very slow restoration was observed with vesicles treated with MgF and AlF even with A23187. BeF·E2 thus has the features very similar to those characteristic of the E2P ground state, although AlF·E2 and MgF·E2 most likely mimic the transition or product state for the E2P hydrolysis, during which the hydrophobic nature around the phosphorylation site is lost and the Ca2+ release pathway is closed. The change in hydrophobic nature is probably associated with the change in phosphate geometry from the covalently bound tetrahedral ground state () to trigonal bipyramidal transition state (AlF3 or ) and further to tetrahedral product state (), and such change likely rearranges transmembrane helices to prevent access and leakage of lumenal Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W2066161717,"Recycling of ascorbic acid from its oxidized forms helps to maintain the vitamin in human erythrocytes. To determine the relative contributions of recycling from the ascorbate radical and dehydroascorbic acid, we studied erythrocytes exposed to a trans-membrane oxidant stress from ferricyanide. Ferricyanide was used both to induce oxidant stress across the cell membrane and to quantify ascorbate recycling. Erythrocytes reduced ferricyanide with generation of intracellular ascorbate radical, the concentrations of which saturated with increasing intracellular ascorbate and which were sustained over time in cells incubated with glucose. Ferricyanide also generated dehydroascorbic acid that accumulated in the cells and incubation medium to concentrations much higher than those of the radical, especially in the absence of glucose. Ferricyanide-stimulated ascorbate recycling from dehydroascorbic acid depended on intracellular GSH but was well maintained at the expense of intracellular ascorbate when GSH was severely depleted by diethylmaleate. This likely reflects continued radical reduction, which is not dependent on GSH. Erythrocyte hemolysates showed both NAD- and NADPH-dependent ascorbate radical reduction. The latter was partially due to thioredoxin reductase. GSH-dependent dehydroascorbate reduction in hemolysates, which was both direct and enzyme-dependent, was greater than that of the radical reductase activity but of lower apparent affinity. Together, these results suggest an efficient two-tiered system in which high affinity reduction of the ascorbate radical is sufficient to remove low concentrations of the radical that might be encountered by cells not under oxidant stress, with back-up by a high capacity system for reducing dehydroascorbate under conditions of more severe oxidant stress.

Recycling of ascorbic acid from its oxidized forms helps to maintain adequate tissue levels of the vitamin. This recycling is largely intracellular and occurs from both the one- and two-electron-oxidized forms of ascorbate, the ascorbate free radical (AFR) 1The abbreviations used are: AFR, ascorbate free radical; DHA, dehydroascorbic acid; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: AFR, ascorbate free radical; DHA, dehydroascorbic acid; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. and dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), respectively (1Rose R.C.

The AFR reacts predominantly by dismutation of two AFR molecules, yielding ascorbate and DHA. The AFR can also be reduced by NADH-dependent cytochrome b5 reductases in plasma membranes (3May J.M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23039-23045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The cells also have rapid and efficient mechanisms for reducing DHA to ascorbate. DHA can be reduced directly by GSH (16Winkler B.S. Orselli S.M. Rex T.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), by GSH-dependent enzymes (17Wells W.W.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The relative rates of ascorbate recycling from AFR and the DHA probably depend on the cell type, although it has been suggested, based on comparison of AFR and DHA reduction rates in tissue homogenates, that in most tissues of the pig, AFR reduction predominates over that of DHA (20Coassin M. Tomasi A. Vannini V. Ursini F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This makes sense with regard to conserving ascorbate, because DHA is unstable at physiologic pH and will undergo irreversible ring opening to 2,3-l-diketogulonic acid (21Drake B.B. Smythe C.V. King C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1942; 143: 89-98Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 22Winkler B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 925: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and conversion to l-erythroascorbic acid (23Jung C.H. Wells W.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Also, DHA is a substrate for the glucose transporter (24Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and may be lost from cells by this mechanism. Whereas reduction of DHA might risk losing the vitamin entirely, it does have the advantage that by allowing oxidation of ascorbate to DHA, the cell utilizes the full two-electron reducing capacity of ascorbate. To differentiate between ascorbate recycling from the AFR and DHA, it is necessary to measure changes in the concentrations of all three forms of ascorbate in response to an oxidant stress in a cell or tissue. This is problematic given the low concentrations of both DHA and the AFR in cells, as well as their instability. To study intracellular ascorbate recycling, it is crucial to use an oxidant that has little effect on cell metabolism beyond that related to ascorbate. Therefore, to selectively oxidize intracellular ascorbate, we used the oxidant ferricyanide, which does not cross the erythrocyte cell membrane (25Székely M. Mányai S. Straub F.B. Acta Physiol. Acad. Sci. Hung. 1952; 3: 571-583PubMed Google Scholar) and does not affect intracellular GSH concentrations (26May J.M. Qu Z. Morrow J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ferricyanide accepts electrons from a trans-plasma membrane oxidoreductase that uses ascorbate as an intracellular donor (27Orringer E.P. Roer M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 28Schipfer W. Neophytou B. Trobisch R. Groiss O. Goldenberg H. Int. J.

Although ferricyanide generates both the AFR and DHA within erythrocytes (30May J.M. Qu Z.-C. Whitesell R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12721-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 31May J.M. Qu Z.-C. Whitesell R.R. Cobb C.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), it is uncertain whether the DHA generated results from AFR oxidation or from AFR dismutation. In the experiments to be presented, we measured time- and concentration-dependent changes in intracellular concentrations of ascorbate, the AFR, and DHA to determine relative rates of recycling. We also compared rates of AFR and DHA reduction directly in cell hemolysates. Materials—Analytical reagents, including ascorbic acid, ascorbate oxidase (from Curcubita species), aurothioglucose, thioredoxin, diethylmaleate, 2,2,6,6-tetra-methyl-4-hydroxy-piperidine-N-oxyl, and tetrapentylammonium bromide were supplied by Sigma/Aldrich. Diethylmaleate was initially dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, such that the highest concentration of the latter was 0.8% (v/v) in cells incubated with 2 mm diethylmaleate. Erythrocyte and Erythrocyte Hemolysate Preparation—Human erythrocytes were obtained from freshly drawn heparinized blood of normal volunteers. The cells were washed three times in 10 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), which consisted of deionized water containing 140 mm NaCl and 12.5 mm Na2PO4, pH 7.4. The buffy coat of white cells was removed with each wash. The hemolysates were prepared from washed erythrocytes by diluting packed cells in 100 volumes of deionized water and kept on ice until use. Assay of Ascorbate, DHA, GSH, and Reduced Pyridine Nucleotides— For assay of ascorbate and GSH, the cells were washed three times in PBS, and the packed cells were hemolyzed in 20 volumes of ice-cold deionized water. For assay of total ascorbate and DHA in a cell aliquot, this water also contained 2 mm dimercaptopropanol. The hemolysates were ultrafiltered by centrifugation at 3 °C for 20 min at 5000 × g in a Centricon-10 filter apparatus (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA), and aliquots of the clear filtrate were taken for assay of ascorbate and GSH. Ascorbate was assayed by high performance liquid chromatography using electrochemical detection as previously described (32May J.M. Qu Z.-C. Mendiratta S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), except that 1 mm tetrapentylammonium bromide was used as the ion pair reagent. DHA concentrations were calculated by subtracting concentrations of ascorbate from those of total ascorbate and DHA determined in paired aliquots of the same original sample. There was no interference in the ascorbate assay by the concentration of dimercaptopropanol used to convert DHA to ascorbate in the samples. Conversion of 0.2 mm DHA to ascorbate was complete under these conditions. GSH was measured by the fluorometric method of Hissin and Hilf (33Hissin P.J. Hilf R. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (3669) Google Scholar). Reduced pyridine nucleotides were measured by the method of Zerez et al. (34Zerez C.R. Lee S.J. Tanaka K.R. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), with minor modifications as previously described (35Vincent T.E. Mendiratta S. May J.M. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1999; 43: 1-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Except where noted, all of the concentrations were normalized to the intracellular water space of erythrocytes, which was taken as 70% of the packed cell volume (27Orringer E.P. Roer M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Measurement of Ascorbate-dependent Ferricyanide Reduction—After incubation of erythrocytes with ferricyanide as noted, the cells were pelleted in a centrifuge, and aliquots of the supernatant were removed for measurement of ferrocyanide by the method of Avron and Shavit (36Avron M. Shavit N. Anal. Biochem. 1963; 6: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), using 2,5-o-phenanthroline as the chelating agent. A cell blank derived from a sample incubated with cells but no ferricyanide was subtracted from each sample. Measurement of the AFR—Steady-state concentrations of the AFR generated by various concentrations of ascorbate oxidase in the presence of 1 mm ascorbate were measured in pH 7.0 PBS at 360 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 3.3 mm-1 cm-1 to calculate the AFR concentration (37Bielski B.H.J. Seib P.A. Tolbert B.M. Ascorbic Acid: Chemistry, Metabolism, and Uses. American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C.1982: 81-100Google Scholar). Time-dependent changes in the AFR concentration in erythrocyte suspensions were measured by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. EPR data were acquired on a Bruker EMX 8/27 spectrometer equipped with a BVT300 variable temperature controller. Sample temperature was maintained at 37 °C during data acquisition by blowing precooled nitrogen into the cavity through the front optical port. X-band EPR spectra were collected using a ER041XG-DHA microwave bridge and ER4103TM/9614 cavity. Sample incubations were carried out in a Wilmad WG 804 aqueous flow flat cell. Based on a preliminary incubation, the magnetic field was fixed at the value that corresponded to the maximum signal intensity of the low field resonance line of the AFR (Fig. 3A, inset, arrow). The conversion time of the spectrometer was chosen to result in a sweep time of 167 s (because each data set contained 2048 points, the timing resolution was ∼0.082 s/point). Other spectrometer settings were: 0.5 G modulation amplitude, 100 kHz modulation frequency, and 10 mW microwave power. The flat cell was preloaded with either buffer or a 40% packed cell volume of erythrocytes to permit tuning of the spectrometer. The experiment was initiated by starting the time sweep to record a base-line signal. After about 10 s, 5 mm ferricyanide was added to the remainder of the prewarmed sample, which was rapidly injected into the flat cell. Approximately 15 s elapsed between the addition of ferricyanide and the start of data recording on the mixed sample. The concentration of the AFR was determined by calibration of the instrument using the signal of 10 μm 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-hydroxy-piperidine-N-oxyl. Measurement of NADH-dependent AFR and Ferricyanide Reductase Activities—AFR reductase activity was measured by generating the AFR in dilute hemolysates incubated at 37 °C in pH 7.0 PBS that contained 1 mm ascorbate, 0.1–4 units/ml ascorbate oxidase, and 0.1 mm of either NADH or NADPH. Where noted, 1 mm dithiothreitol was also present. The rates of NAD(P)H oxidation were followed at 340 nm for 3 min in a Beckman DU-640 recording spectrophotometer. The change in NAD(P)H concentration was calculated from the slope of the resulting line, using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm-1 cm-1. The values were corrected in each experiment for rates of NAD(P)H oxidation measured in the absence of the oxidase and normalized to the original volume of erythrocytes. Assay of GSH-dependent DHA Reduction in Erythrocyte Hemolysates—The ability of erythrocyte hemolysates to reduce DHA was measured in an assay coupled to NADPH through glutathione reductase (38Stahl R.L. Liebes L.F. Farber C.M. Silber R. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 100-fold dilution of erythrocyte hemolysate in deionized water was incubated in pH 7.0 PBS that contained 0.42 units/ml glutathione reductase, 0.5 mm GSH, 0.1 mm NADPH, and the indicated concentration of DHA. The absorbance at 340 nm was followed in duplicate at 37 °C in a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer for 3 min. The slope of the linear decrease in absorbance was used to calculate the oxidation of NADPH, based on an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm-1 cm-1. Blanks not containing hemolysate were run at the same time, and the corresponding readings were subtracted from the rates observed at each DHA concentration in the presence of hemolysate. This was consistently 36 ± 1% of the corrected hemolysate value. The data were normalized to the original packed cell volume of erythrocytes. Data Analysis—The data are shown as the means ± S.E. Curve fitting was performed with the graphics analysis program Origin (Microcal Software, Inc., Northhampton, MA). Statistical significance was assessed by analysis of variance with appropriate post-hoc testing using the statistical software package Sigmastat 2.0 (Jandel Scientific, St. Louis, MO). Concentration Dependence of Ferricyanide Reduction by Ascorbate-loaded Erythrocytes—Although two-thirds of basal ferricyanide reduction is due to ascorbate in freshly prepared erythrocytes (30May J.M. Qu Z.-C. Whitesell R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12721-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), to increase ascorbate-dependent ferricyanide reduction even further, the cells were loaded with ascorbate by incubation with DHA. Uptake and reduction of DHA by erythrocytes was complete by 15 min at 37 °C (results not shown), and incubation of cells with increasing concentrations of DHA under these conditions resulted in a linear increase in the intracellular ascorbate concentration (Fig. 1A). Ferricyanide was used both to induce and to estimate integrated ascorbate recycling in erythrocytes. To ensure that steady-state rates of ascorbate recycling were being measured, it was first necessary to ascertain a concentration of ferricyanide that would not be depleted by incubation with cells containing increased amounts of ascorbate. The rates of ferricyanide reduction increased with increasing intracellular ascorbate concentrations, as shown in Fig. 1B. However, ferricyanide reduction saturated above 1 mm ferricyanide, regardless of the initial intracellular ascorbate concentration. It can be calculated from these data that erythrocytes loaded with 0.5 mm DHA reduced only 14% of a 5 mm concentration of medium ferricyanide under these conditions. Therefore, exhaustion of ferricyanide does not account for the observed saturation in ferricyanide reduction. To generate constant oxidant stress on the cells, 5 mm ferricyanide was used in subsequent experiments. Time-dependent Oxidation of Intracellular Ascorbate by Ferricyanide—In erythrocytes that had been loaded with 0.1 mm DHA, exposure to 5 mm ferricyanide in the presence of glucose caused a gradual decrease in intracellular ascorbate over a 20-min incubation (Fig. 2A). In the absence of glucose, the ascorbate concentration decreased rapidly and had already fallen substantially at the first time point that could be obtained after removal of ferricyanide, which was about 2 min after exposure to ferricyanide. After 22 min of incubation, intracellular ascorbate reached concentrations that were about 10% of those present at the start of incubation, which were 0.16–0.18 mm. Thus, the ability of erythrocytes to maintain intracellular ascorbate is highly dependent on the availability of glucose. Ferricyanide treatment did not cause significant changes in cellular GSH content, whether or not glucose was present (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, ferricyanide reduction increased with time but in the absence of glucose was decreased only about 20% at 5 min and 40% at 22 min. Despite the marked fall in intracellular ascorbate in the absence of glucose, ascorbate-dependent ferricyanide reduction was fairly well maintained. This suggests very rapid recycling of intracellular ascorbate and suggests that AFR or DHA concentrations must have markedly increased during ferricyanide reduction. These concentrations were measured as described in the next two sections, and both showed substantial increases. Ferricyanide-dependent Generation of the AFR in Erythrocytes—Time dependent changes in AFR concentrations were measured in erythrocytes in response to ferricyanide. This was accomplished by following the amplitude of the low field peak in the EPR spectrum of the AFR with time (Fig. 3A, inset, arrow). In the absence of ferricyanide, no AFR was detected in 40% packed cells (results not shown). When cells containing endogenous ascorbate (40–60 μm) were challenged with ferricyanide, an ascorbate radical signal was generated that remained stable over 10 min. In cells that had been loaded with increasing amounts of ascorbate by incubation with DHA, the amplitude of the initial AFR signal increased severalfold and was unaffected by the presence of glucose in the incubation. Over 10 min, the AFR signal decreased in all samples. Further, the presence of glucose in the incubation medium (indicated by the dotted lines for each DHA concentration) preserved the AFR signal over the later time points. This likely reflects the ability of glucose to preserve intracellular ascorbate in the face of an oxidant stress caused by ferricyanide (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 3B, the initial amplitude of the AFR signal was a saturable function of the intracellular ascorbate concentrations measured under these conditions (as derived from Fig. 1A). It is apparent that AFR generation saturates above 0.25 mm intracellular ascorbate, with a half-maximal effect at about 0.15 mm intracellular ascorbate (Fig. 3B). Despite excess ferricyanide outside the cells and a linear increase in ascorbate concentrations in the cells before ferricyanide exposure (Fig. 1A), the intracellular AFR concentration does not exceed 22 μm. This suggests either that AFR generation is limited by the trans-membrane generation of an oxidant stress or that AFR reduction and/or dismutation/oxidation prevents AFR accumulation above this concentration. DHA Generation Increases with Intracellular Ascorbate in Response to Ferricyanide—To measure DHA generation during an oxidant stress in erythrocytes, the cells were loaded with increasing concentrations of DHA in the presence of glucose as in previous experiments and then washed several times to remove any remaining extracellular DHA or ascorbate. Subsequent treatment of these ascorbate-loaded cells with ferricyanide oxidized intracellular ascorbate to DHA, part of which was released from the cells into the incubation medium (results not shown). Therefore, to assess the total amount of ascorbate in the system, the results are expressed as the concentration of DHA or ascorbate in the incubation volume containing 40% cells rather than as the concentration within the cells, as was done in Figs. 1 and 2. Whether or not glucose was present during the short 5-min exposure to ferricyanide, concentrations of ascorbate (Fig. 4A) and DHA (Fig. 4B) increased nonlinearly with increasing DHA loading concentrations (i.e. initial intracellular ascorbate concentrations). When glucose was present during ferricyanide reduction, ascorbate concentrations were several times higher than when glucose was absent (Fig. 4A). The reverse was observed for DHA, in that DHA concentrations were lower when glucose was present (Fig. 4B). Thus, ferricyanide reduction increased DHA concentrations at the expense of ascorbate, especially in the absence of glucose. In fact, failure to include glucose resulted in DHA concentrations that were 2–3-fold higher than those of ascorbate (compare squares in Figs. 4, A and B). DHA generation was likely even greater, because some DHA was also lost to degradation during these experiments. For example, in cells loaded with 0.5 mm DHA in these experiments, total DHA plus ascorbate recovered following ferricyanide treatment was lower than in cells not treated with ferricyanide: 25.4 ± 7.2 and 26.6 ± 4.2% in the presence and absence of glucose, respectively. Taken together, these results show that glucose was required to maintain intracellular ascorbate relative to DHA in the face of an oxidant stress induced by ferricyanide. Significantly, even in glucose-treated cells, comparison of the measured DHA concentrations in Fig. 4B with the measured peak AFR concentrations in Fig. 3B shows that although both tended to saturate, the DHA concentrations observed were 3–7-fold greater than those of the AFR at the same loading DHA concentrations. Using ascorbate-dependent ferricyanide reduction as an estimate of ascorbate recycling, cells loaded by incubation with 0.5 mm DHA that initially contained 0.64 mm ascorbate (0.45 μmol/ml packed cells; Fig. 1A) were able to reduce 1.8 μmol of ferricyanide/ml packed cells above basal rates in 5 min (Fig. 4A). Given that 1 mol of ascorbate reduces 2 mol of ferricyanide and that the intracellular ascorbate content decreased to 0.13 μmol/ml packed cells during the incubation (Fig. 4A), these results show that the cells recycled the initial content of ascorbate 1.3 times in 5 min. Because GSH is a major factor in recycling DHA to ascorbate in erythrocytes (31May J.M. Qu Z.-C. Whitesell R.R. Cobb C.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), intracellular GSH concentrations were also measured in the experiments of Fig. 4. In cells loaded with increasing amounts of ascorbate as DHA in the presence of glucose, intracellular GSH was unaffected by ferricyanide treatment (Fig. 4C). However, even though glucose was present during initial DHA loading, subsequent treatment with ferricyanide in the absence of glucose decreased GSH, an effect that became significant at 0.2 mm DHA and reached a 32% decrease at 1 mm DHA. Although the cells started with the same ascorbate concentrations, glucose was needed to maintain GSH during recycling of higher intracellular ascorbate concentrations. Rates of ferricyanide reduction increased in a saturable manner with increasing intracellular ascorbate because of DHA loading (Fig. 4D). The absence of glucose during ferricyanide treatment significantly decreased rates of ferricyanide reduction across the range of DHA loading concentrations, but rates at individual DHA loading concentrations were not different. Given the marked effect of omitting glucose during ferricyanide treatment on ascorbate and DHA concentrations (Fig. 4, A and B), the differences in ferricyanide reduction were relatively modest. That is, the cells were able to maintain high rates of ferricyanide-induced ascorbate recycling despite substantial ascorbate oxidation. This high recycling capacity was further exemplified when GSH was selectively depleted, as described next. GSH Depletion and Ferricyanide-induced Ascorbate Recycling—To assess the effect of GSH depletion on the ability of erythrocytes to recycle ascorbate, cells that had been loaded with ascorbate by incubation with 0.5 mm DHA were treated with increasing amounts of diethylmaleate, washed, and incubated with ferricyanide. Glutathione S-transferase conjugates diethylmaleate and GSH and prevents function of the latter as a reducing agent. Treatment of ascorbate-loaded erythrocytes with increasing concentrations of diethylmaleate caused progressive depletion of both ascorbate (Fig. 5A) and GSH (Fig. 5B) during ferricyanide reduction. The parallel decrease in ascorbate concentrations with primary GSH depletion attests to a substantial component of GSH-dependent ascorbate recycling. Ferricyanide reduction was markedly stimulated by ascorbate loading in the absence of diethylmaleate, from 0.06 ± 0.02 μmol·(ml of erythrocyte cytosol)-1·min-1 to 0.47 ± 0.03 μmol·(ml of erythrocyte cytosol)-1·min-1. However, ascorbate-stimulated ferricyanide reduction was only moderately inhibited by diethylmaleate treatment, decreasing only 21% at the highest diethylmaleate concentration used (Fig. 5C). The rates of ferricyanide reduction were sustained in part by oxidative loss of ascorbate. For example, about 50% of ascorbate-dependent ferricyanide reduction in cells treated with 2 mm diethylmaleate could be accounted for by ascorbate oxidation alone (Fig. 5A). The remainder could reflect efficient recycling of ascorbate by GSH-independent mechanisms. To test this possibility, we carried out five experiments under the conditions of Fig. 5, in which 40% packed cells that"

Virtually all of these cellular effects are averted by pretreatment with pertussis toxin, indicating that 5-HT1A receptors couple specifically and/or preferentially to Gi/o proteins. Although previous studies have thoroughly detailed the coupling of the 5-HT1A receptor to heterotrimeric G proteins and intracellular second messengers, no studies have investigated the possible role of additional receptor-interacting proteins in 5-HT1A receptor signaling. Growing evidence suggests that GPCRs can bind a variety of proteins, which can subsequently modify receptor signaling, internalization, and/or interaction with G protein subunits. For example, several GPCRs contain C-terminal PDZ motifs that permit them to interact with multiple intracellular proteins, including the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor and post-synaptic density protein PSD-95 (20Hall R.A.

J. 2002; 362: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), to platelet glycoprotein VI (26Andrews R.K. Suzuki-Inoue K. Shen Y. Tulasne D. Watson S.P. Berndt M.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 4219-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and to some GPCRs (27Wang D. Sadee W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The first GPCR that was shown to interact with CaM was the metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 receptor (mGluR5), which contains a CaM-binding site in a region of the extended C terminus of the receptor that is also known to bind G protein βγ subunits and to contain a PKC phosphorylation site (28El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Airas J.M. O'Connor V. Boehm S. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30662-30669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Wang et al. (27Wang D. Sadee W. Quillan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22081-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) showed that the μ-opioid receptor interacts with CaM at a C-terminal juxtamembrane region in the third intracellular loop. They concluded that CaM binding reduces G protein coupling, probably through a competitive mechanism. Similarly, Bofill-Cardona et al. (29Bofill-Cardona E. Kudlacek O. Yang Q. Ahorn H. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32672-32680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) showed that CaM interacts with an N-terminal juxtamembrane region of the D2-dopamine receptor third intracellular loop, resulting in a blockade of the receptor-operated G protein activation switch. These examples indicate that CaM interactions may play important and diverse roles in GPCR signaling, although those roles remain largely undefined. Our group has previously reported a role for CaM in 5-HT1A receptor signaling to extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) MAPKs (18Garnovskaya M.N. Mukhin Y.V. Raymond J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Della Rocca G.J. Mukhin Y.V. Garnovskaya M.N. Daaka Y. Clark G.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4749-4753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). 5-HT1A receptor-mediated ERK activation is inhibited by chelation of intracellular Ca2+, CaM inhibitors, and expression of the CaM-sequestering protein calspermin. CaM appears to play a role in ERK activation by modulating receptor endocytosis, a step required for the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases kinase, MEK, which phosphorylates and activates ERK. The fact that CaM plays a vital role at such a proximal step in the 5-HT1A receptor signaling pathway suggests that perhaps CaM exerts its effects by interacting with the receptor itself. In this work, we report that CaM co-immunoprecipitates with the 5-HT1A receptor in CHO fibroblasts. A search of the primary sequence revealed that the human 5-HT1A receptor contains two potential CaM binding motifs, located in the N- and C-terminal juxtamembrane regions of the third intracellular loop of the receptor. Both motifs contain consensus PKC phosphorylation sites and are important for Gi/o protein coupling, indicating that these regions of the receptor likely play an important regulatory role in receptor function. The purpose of this work was to determine whether the two putative CaM binding sites could bind to CaM, and if so, whether this would alter some parameter of receptor function. Materials—Purified bovine brain calmodulin, biotinylated calmodulin, and purified rat brain PKC were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Mouse anti-CaM antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). Coelenterazine h and dansyl chloride were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). CM5 carboxymethylated sensor chips were purchased from BIAcore AB (Foster City, CA). Anti-5-HT1A receptor antibodies were raised as previously described (13Raymond J.R. Fargin A. Middleton J.P.

Synthesis of 5-HT1A Receptor i3 Loop Peptides—Peptides derived from the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal (i3N, aa 215–237, YGRIFRAARFRIRKTVKKVEKTG; i3N-P, aa 215–237, YGRIFRAARFRIRKpTVKKVEKTG) and C-terminal (i3C, aa 328–350, EAKRKMALARERKTVKTLGIIMG; i3C-P, aa 328–350, EAKRKMALARERKpTVKTLGIIMG) regions of the 5-HT1A receptor third intracellular loop were synthesized on a Rainin PS3 automated peptide synthesizer by the MUSC Peptide Synthesis Facility, using standard solid-phase methods. Peptide size and purity was verified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. When necessary, peptides were purified on a Waters Delta Prep 3000 chromatography system using a C-18 silica column, and elution was carried out across a linear gradient of acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid (Emory University, Microchemical Facility, Atlanta, GA). Plasmids and Transfections—The yellow fluorescent protein expression vector eYFP-N1 was obtained from Clontech (San Jose, CA). The Renilla Luciferase protein expression vectors RLuc-N1 and RLuc-C1 were kindly provided by J. Yordy (MUSC, Charleston, SC). The calmodulin coding sequence without its stop codon was amplified from HeLa cell cDNA using sense and antisense primers containing unique XmaI and SacII restriction sites. The fragment was then subcloned in-frame into the RLuc-N1 and RLuc-C1 vectors. The 5-HT1A receptor coding sequence was amplified from pcDNA3.1 containing the entire 5-HT1A receptor coding sequence and 3′ untranslated region using sense and antisense primers containing unique BaMH1 and XhoI restriction sites (19Garnovskaya M.N. Gettys T.W. Van Biesen T. Chuprun J.K. Prpic V. Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The fragment was then subcloned in-frame into the eYFP-N1 vector. All vector constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO-K1 (CHO) cells expressing the 5-HT1A receptor were maintained in F-12/Ham's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and gentamicin (400 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-enriched, humidified atmosphere. 24–48 h before each experiment, cells were switched to serum-free medium containing 0.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). For transient transfections, CHO cells were plated in 6-well plates at 1 × 105 cells per well, and cultured for 24 h in F-12/Ham's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were then transferred to antibiotic- and serum-free F-12/Ham's medium and transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The final amount of transfected DNA for a single well was ∼2 μg. After transfection, cells were cultured in F-12/Ham's medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin or 10% fetal calf serum for 48 h to allow for protein expression. For stable transfections, CHO cells were plated in a 12-well plate and cultured in F-12/Ham's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum until they reached ∼90–95% confluence. Cells were transfected (1 μg of DNA/well) as previously described and cultured for 48 h. Cells were then sub-cultured into 100-mm dishes, and media was replaced with fresh F-12/Ham's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 400 μg/ml Geneticin. Cells were cultured for 1–2 weeks to allow for the selection of stable clones. Gel Shift Assays—Gel shift analysis of CaM-peptide complexes was performed using urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described by Erickson-Viitanen and Delgrado (33Erickson-Viitanen S. DeGrado W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 455-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Reactions (30-μl total volume) containing 300 pmol of CaM (∼5 μg) and increasing amounts of peptide (0–3000 pmol) were incubated in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 m urea, and either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA at 22 °C for 30 min. 15 μl of a 50% glycerol/0.1% bromphenol blue loading buffer was added to each reaction, and the samples were resolved on 14% polyacrylamide gels containing 4 m urea and either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA in the running buffer. Protein was visualized by staining with Gel-code blue (Pierce) staining reagent. Blot Overlay Assays—Peptides (1–100 nmol) were immobilized to PVDF membranes by slot-blot and washed twice with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, and then were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml biotinylated CaM in the presence of either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA overnight at 4 °C. The PVDF membranes were then washed 3× in the same buffer without CaM, followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated avidin for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was with a chemiluminescent reagent. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Real-time binding and kinetic analyses were performed at the MUSC Biomolecular Resource Facility on a BIAcore 3000 biosensor system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB) using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements. Carboxymethylated sensor chips (type CM5) were activated with a 1:1 mixture of 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide in water. Synthetic peptides (100 μg/ml, 31.5 nm in 10 mm sodium acetate at pH 4.8) were then immobilized on the sensor chips using an amine coupling kit (BIAcore) as described by the supplier. Unreacted sites were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5). The SPR signals from the immobilized peptides generated BIAcore response units ranging from 400 to 720. Control flow cells were activated and blocked in the absence of protein. Binding was evaluated over a range of CaM concentrations (15.6 nm to 1 μm) in 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 400 μm CaCl2 under a continuous flow of 5 μl/min at 25 °C. 10 μl of CaM-containing solutions was pulsed over the surface of the chip for 2 min using the kinject command. Binding of CaM to peptide-immobilized flow cells was corrected for binding to control flow cells. Flow cells were regenerated by passing over running buffer without CaCl2. Binding data were fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model under steady-state conditions using BIAevaluation version 3.1 software (BIAcore). Fluorometric Measurements with Dansyl-CaM—Dansyl-CaM was synthesized according to the method of Bertrand et al. (34Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of CaM was incubated with ∼1 μg dansyl-chloride for 1 h at 4 °C. Dansyl-CaM was purified from unincorporated dye using a Centricon™ concentrator with a molecular mass cutoff of 10,000 Da. Measurement of absorbance at 340 nm (molar extinction coefficient: 3,400 m–1cm–1) gave an incorporation of ∼1.3 dansyl units per CaM molecule. Fluorescence emission spectra of dansyl-CaM were measured from 400 to 600 nm using a SLM 8000™C spectrofluorometer (Aminco-Bowman) with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. Test peptides (0–8 μm) were incubated with dansyl-CaM in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2 for 2 h at room temperature. The concentration of dansyl-CaM (0.1–0.5 μm) was varied, and concentration-response curves were generated for fluorescence enhancement at each dansyl-CaM concentration. The apparent KD values for each concentration of dansyl-CaM were fit to the Hill equation by linear regression to calculate true affinities. Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer—To determine whether CaM and the 5-HT1A receptor come into close proximity in intact cells, we used bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), a technique that detects close proximity of proteins using energy transfer between luminescent and fluorescent tags. A bioluminescent donor source (Renilla reniformis luciferase, RLuc) can transfer energy to an acceptor fluorophore (yellow variant of Aequorea green fluorescent protein, YFP) within a radius of ∼50 Å, and this transfer is virtually undetectable at distances greater than 100 Å (35Xu Y. Piston D.W. Hirschie Johnson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). CHO-5-HT1AR cells were transfected as described above and cultured in F-12/Ham's media for 48 h to allow for protein expression. Cells were detached with PBS/1 mm EDTA and distributed into a 96-well plate at 1 × 105 cells/well. Fluorescence measurements were acquired using a Victor2 multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In some cases, cells were incubated in the presence of inhibitors for 20 min, followed by the addition of 1 μm 8-OH-DPAT for 5 min. Coelenterazine h was then added to a final concentration of 5 μm, and sequential measurements were made with filters at 460 ± 25 nm and 525 ± 25 nm. The BRET ratio was calculated as the ratio of light emitted at 525 nm (YFP) over the light emitted at 460 nm (Luciferase). In Vitro Kinase Assays—Thirty-five nanograms (∼0.06 unit) of purified rat brain PKC was incubated with increasing concentrations of i3N (0–5 μm) and i3C (0–10 μm) peptides in kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.01 mg/ml diacylglycerol, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP) in a total volume of 30 μl. In some cases, purified bovine brain calmodulin (0–120 μm) was added to reactions. Assays were started by the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Reactions were then transferred to nitrocellulose squares, washed several times with 0.75% phosphoric acid, followed by a final wash with 100% acetone. Bound radioactivity was measured using liquid scintillation counting. Statistical Analysis—Results shown represent the means ± S.E. of the number of experiments indicated in each case. Statistical analysis was performed by student's t test. Interaction of CaM with the Serotonin 5-HT1A Receptor—We have previously shown that CaM plays roles in numerous 5-HT1A receptor signaling pathways, including stimulation of MAPKs (18Garnovskaya M.N. Mukhin Y.V. Raymond J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Della Rocca G.J. Mukhin Y.V. Garnovskaya M.N. Daaka Y. Clark G.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J.

We wondered if, in addition to its distinct roles in downstream signaling pathways, CaM might play a more proximal role in 5-HT1A receptor signaling by interacting directly with the receptor through one of its intracellular domains. To that end, we immunoprecipitated the 5-HT1A receptor from CHO fibroblasts that were transfected to stably express this receptor at physiological levels (36Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14747-14753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, a CaM-specific antibody detected a distinct band at ∼19 kDa, which corresponds to the Ca2+-bound mobility of CaM under denaturing conditions. This band was not present when immunoprecipitation was performed with nonspecific-IgG. The density of the CaM band was similar to or slightly decreased in samples treated with the 5-HT1A receptor-selective agonist 8-OH-DPAT. These results suggest that in CHO cells CaM is constitutively complexed with the 5-HT1A receptor. Identification of Putative CaM Binding Regions in the Third Intracellular Loop of the 5-HT1A Receptor—Using a computer search program that identifies putative CaM-binding sites based on evaluation criteria such as hydropathy, α-helical propensity, residue charge, helical class, residue weight, and hydrophobic residue content (37Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), we identified two putative CaM binding regions in the protein sequence of the 5-HT1A receptor. Both putative CaM-binding domains were localized to the third intracellular loop of the receptor, at the N- and C-terminal juxtamembrane regions (Fig. 2A). As a general rule, CaM binding regions are characterized by the presence of several hydrophobic residues interspersed with several positively charged residues, often forming amphipathic α-helices (38James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 39O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). CaM binding regions described to date have been divided into several motifs based on the distance between key hydrophobic residues. The N-terminal CaM binding region was identified as a 1-12 motif, with key hydrophobic residues at positions 1 and 12, whereas the C-terminal CaM binding region in the 5-HT1A receptor was classified as a 1-8-14 motif, characterized by hydrophobic residues at positions 1, 8, and 14 (Fig. 2B). Further analysis of the 5-HT1A receptor CaM binding regions revealed that they could be aligned with other well defined CaM binding motifs from other proteins. Some examples are provided in Fig. 2B.

https://openalex.org/W2078358684,"The reverse transcriptase encoded by the non-long terminal repeat retrotransposon R2 has been shown to be able to jump from the 5′-end of one RNA template (the donor) to the 3′-end of a second RNA template (the acceptor) in the absence of preexisting sequence identity between the two templates. These jumps between RNA templates have similarity to the end-to-end template jumps described for the RNA-directed RNA polymerases encoded by certain RNA viruses. Here we describe for the first time the mechanism by which such end-to-end template jumps can occur. Most template jumps by the R2 reverse transcriptase are brought about by the enzyme's ability to add nontemplated (overhanging) nucleotides to the cDNA when it reaches the end of the donor RNA. The enzyme then anneals these overhanging nucleotides to sequences at the 3′-end of the acceptor RNA. The annealing is most efficient if it involves the terminal nucleotide(s) of the acceptor RNA but can occur to sites at least 5 nucleotides from the 3′-end. These end-to-end jumps are similar to steps proposed to be part of the integration reaction of non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons and can explain chimeric integration products derived from multiple RNA templates.

These end-to-end jumps are similar to steps proposed to be part of the integration reaction of non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons and can explain chimeric integration products derived from multiple RNA templates. One of the most abundant classes of mobile elements found in eukaryotic genomes is non-LTR 1The abbreviations used are: LTR, long terminal repeat; TPRT, target (DNA)-primed reverse transcription; RT, reverse transcriptase; AMV, avian myeloblastosis virus; nt, nucleotide(s). 1The abbreviations used are: LTR, long terminal repeat; TPRT, target (DNA)-primed reverse transcription; RT, reverse transcriptase; AMV, avian myeloblastosis virus; nt, nucleotide(s). retrotransposons. These elements, also referred to as LINE-like elements or retroposons, use a relatively simple mechanism of reverse transcribing RNA templates into DNA for insertion into the genome. In the first step, the target chromosomal DNA is cleaved by an element-encoded endonuclease. The RNA-directed DNA polymerase encoded by the element then uses the free end of the cleaved target DNA as the primer to initiate reverse transcription starting at the 3′-end of the element's RNA transcript. This process has been termed target (DNA)-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) (1Luan D.D. Korman M.H. Jakubczak J.L. Eickbush T.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 595-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Whereas the cleavage that initiates the TPRT reaction could potentially be single-stranded (i.e. a DNA nick) or double-stranded (i.e. a DNA break), in the two systems studied in vitro the cleavage has been shown to be a DNA nick (1Luan D.D. Korman M.H. Jakubczak J.L. Eickbush T.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 595-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 2Cost G.J. Feng Q. Jacquier A. Boeke J.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5899-5910Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that a short region of the RNA template can anneal to the DNA immediately downstream of the nicked site, thus aiding the initiation of reverse transcription (3Kazazian Jr., H.H. Moran J.V. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). However, such annealing is not required in the most extensively characterized element, the R2 element from Bombyx mori (4Luan D.D. Eickbush T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3882-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 5Luan D.D. Eickbush T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4726-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Yang J. Eickbush T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3455-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).We are conducting a systematic study of the catalytic properties of the reverse transcriptase (RT) encoded by the R2 element (7Bibillo A. Eickbush T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Bibillo A. Eickbush T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34836-34845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most dramatic difference between R2 RT and the RT encoded by LTR retrotransposons and retroviruses is the ability of R2 RT to jump from the 5′-end of one RNA template to the 3′-end of a second RNA template. This continuous polymerization of cDNA on noncontinuous RNA templates differs dramatically from the template switching reaction associated with retroviral cDNA synthesis. Retroviral template switches occur through catalytic removal of the donor RNA from the cDNA strand by an associated RNase H domain, which then allows the cDNA to anneal to the acceptor RNA (9Negroni M. Buc H. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 151-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The template jumps by R2 reverse transcriptase do not depend upon sequence identity between the donor and acceptor RNA and thus are similar to the template jumps that have been characterized for a number of viral RNA-directed RNA polymerases (10Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2706-2716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Kim M.-J. Kao C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4972-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). RNA jumps by viral RNA polymerases have been referred to as end-to-end template jumps, and we will also use that terminology here for the R2 template jumps.A better understanding of the R2 template jumps is important. Whereas the TPRT mechanism readily accounts for the attachment of the 3′-end of the new DNA copy to genomic DNA, the means by which the 5′-end of the new copy is attached to chromosomal DNA is still cause for speculation. One model is that the polymerase, after reverse transcribing the RNA transcript, is able to jump onto the upstream DNA helix and continue DNA synthesis in a reaction similar to end-to-end template jumps (12Burke W.D. Malik H.S. Jones J.P. Eickbush T.H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Eickbush T.H. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA. 2nd Ed. American Society of Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 813-835Google Scholar). Template jumping could also explain the lack of sequence requirements at the 5′-end of non-LTR retrotransposons revealed by their ability to integrate 5′-truncated copies into the genome. The RT can just as easily run off the end of a partially degraded RNA template as that of a full-length template. Here we show that R2 RT readily conducts template jumps from the 5′-end of the donor RNA even if they contain am inverted methyl G cap structure. We also show that nontemplated nucleotides added to the cDNA strand before the enzyme runs off the donor RNA facilitate the template jumps by annealing to the 3′-end of the acceptor RNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsR2 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli JM109/pR260 and purified as previously described (7Bibillo A. Eickbush T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined on SDS-polyacrylamide gels using the fluorescent stain SYPRO Orange (Bio-Rad). The intensity of the R2 band was compared with known concentrations of bovine serum albumin using the fluoroimaging function of a Storm 860 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant. Avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase, dNTPs, and 5′-cap analog [m7G(5′ppp(5′))G] was obtained from Promega. The AB.psor, AB.AT, and AB.CG oligonucleotides were synthesized with the help of D. H. Turner.MethodsPreparations of RNA Templates—All RNA templates were generated in vitro by run-off transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). Templates for RNA synthesis were either restriction-digested pBSII(SK-) plasmids (Stratagene) or PCR-amplified products containing the T7 promoter. The 177-nt donor RNA was transcribed from a template generated by PCR amplification of plasmid pB108 (14Xiong Y. Eickbush T.H.

The 183-nt acceptor RNA was transcribed from a template generated by amplification of pBSII(SK-) with primers AB.8 (GGAAACAGCTATGACCATG) and AB.T7 (TAATACGACTCACTATAG). The 190-nt acceptor RNA was transcribed from a template generated by amplification of pUC18 with primers AB.22 (GGAATTCGCCATTCAGGCTGC) and AB.15 (CTGCAGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGATCCTCTAGACTCGACCTGC). The 334-nt vector RNA was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase from pBSII(SK-) predigested with PvuII. The AT and CG acceptor RNAs were prepared to preserve 3′-end transcript homogeneity using a modification of the method of Kao et al. (15Kao C. Zheng M. Rüdisser S. RNA. 1999; 5: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). DNA templates for in vitro transcription of the AT and CG acceptor RNA were PCR-amplified using pBSII(SK-) with one primer including the T7 promoter sequence AB.T7 (TAATACGACTCACTATAG) and second primer AB.CG (GXCGACAGCTATGACCATG) for the CG acceptor RNA or AB.AT (TYATTAAGCGCGCAATTAACCC) for the AT acceptor RNA, where X and Y represent C2′ methoxy-modified G and A nucleotides, respectively. PCR products, which include this C2′ methoxy-modified nucleotide at the penultimate position of the template strand, prevent T7 RNA polymerase from adding extra (nontemplated) nucleotides to the 3′-end of the RNA.All in vitro transcriptions were performed and the RNA purified as previously described (8Bibillo A. Eickbush T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34836-34845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To generate 5′-capped RNA, the concentration of GTP in the synthesis reaction was reduced to 0.1 mm, and the 5′ cap analog, m7G(5′ppp(5′))G, was added at a concentration of 1 mm. To generate RNA with a 5′-hydroxyl group, the RNA after purification was treated with alkaline phosphatase (Promega) and repurified.Preparation of Templates with Annealed and Cross-linked Primers— DNA primer AB.9 was 5′-end-labeled as described previously (8Bibillo A. Eickbush T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34836-34845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Labeled primer was subsequently annealed to the RNA template by incubation with 300 ng of the RNA (∼5 pmol) at 96 °C and cooled slowly (3.5 °C/min). About 125 fmol of annealed RNA template was used for each reaction. The 177-nt donor template was annealed with two oligonucleotides: the 5′-end-labeled primer AB.9 and AB.Psor ((Psor)TAGGGCCATCACAATG), which contained a 5′-psoralen group. The annealed RNA templates were exposed at 4 °C to UV light for 30 min using a long wavelength lamp, UVGL-25 (Mineralight Lamp).Primer Extension Reactions and Directed Template Jumping—The reverse transcription reactions were performed in 30-μl volumes. In the case of R2 RT, the preincubation and elongation mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% Triton X-100, and the concentration of the R2 protein was 0.8-4 nm (3-15 ng). Primer extension reactions with AMV RT were conducted in a manner similar to that for R2 RT with the exception that the solution contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm spermidine, and 5 units of the AMV RT. RT reaction mixtures were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C with polymerization started by the addition of dNTPs to a final concentration of 250 μm (if not specified otherwise). In the directed template jumping reaction, 0.8-1.6 pmol of acceptor RNA was added at the same time as the dNTPs. Polymerization reactions were stopped after 4-7 min by the addition of 3 volumes of 95% ethanol containing 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 1% SDS. After precipitation, the products were separated on 7% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The Gene Ruler 100 bp DNA ladder (Fermentas) was used as DNA length markers. The markers were end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase using the protocol for labeling 5′-protruding termini of DNA by the exchange reaction (Fermentas).Analysis of the Junction Derived from Template Jumps and Donor-Acceptor RNA Ligations—The band corresponding to the template jump product was eluted from a polyacrylamide gel with 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 0.03% SDS for several hours at room temperature, phenol/chloroform-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. The isolated cDNA was then used as a template for PCR amplification using a 5′-end-labeled primer specific to the donor template pR70 (TCACATTGTGTCAACAC) and one specific to the acceptor template AB21 (CTATGGCAGCTGGAGCT). The PCR products were then digested with SpeI, which cleaves within the acceptor sequence, and the digested products were analyzed on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels.The 177-nt RNA donor and the CG or AT acceptor RNAs were ligated using T4 RNA ligase (Fermentas). Before ligation, the triphosphate groups at the 5′-end of the CG or AT RNA were removed by alkaline phosphatase (Fermentas), and a monophosphate was attached using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The ligation reactions (15 μl) were overnight at 4 °C in T4 RNA ligation buffer, 1 mm ATP, 20 units of ligase, 3.4 pmol of 177-nt RNA, and 5 pmol of CG or 5.9 pmol of AT RNA. Products of the ligations were RT-PCR-amplified, SpeI-digested, and analyzed as described above.Sequencing of the Junction Derived from Template Jumps—The band corresponding to the template jump product was excised from a polyacrylamide gel and PCR-amplified using one primer specific to the donor template, AB.9, and one specific to the acceptor template, AB.8. Amplification products were directly sequenced from primers AB.9 or AB.8 by cycle sequencing using ABI Prism, BigDye terminators.RESULTSEnd-to-end Template Jumps Are Continuous Events, Not Reinitiation Events—The template jumping ability of R2 RT can be demonstrated in any run-off reaction if an RNA acceptor is provided (7Bibillo A. Eickbush T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the assay shown in Fig. 1A, R2 RT was preincubated with a 177-nt RNA template containing a 32P-end labeled DNA primer annealed to its 3′-end. After 5 min, dNTPs and a 25-fold molar excess of a 183-nt acceptor RNA were added to start reverse transcription. The 3′-end of the acceptor RNA contained no region of sequence similarity to that of the donor RNA (see “Experimental Procedures” for the origin of these RNAs). Within 10 s, a significant fraction of the enzyme had polymerized to the end of the donor RNA, and by 20 s, a fraction of that enzyme had jumped templates and polymerized to the end of the first acceptor RNA. By 30 s, a fraction of the enzyme had made a second jump and had polymerized to the end of a second acceptor RNA template. Only small increases in cDNA products, the length of the donor RNA, or the length derived by one template jump were observed after 30 s. This is because the enzyme does not efficiently reinitiate reverse transcription on new donor RNA-primer complexes in the presence of excess acceptor RNA (data not shown).The speed of the template jumps and the proposed trap function of the acceptor RNA suggests that R2 RT jumps to a second RNA before it dissociates from the first RNA. To test this hypothesis, the experiment in Fig. 1B was conducted. As in Fig. 1A, the donor RNA and RT were preincubated, and the reaction was started by the addition of dNTPs. In this case, however, the acceptor RNA was added at different times following the initiation of reverse transcription. The delay in the addition of acceptor RNA of only 1 min caused a dramatic drop in the level of template jumps. These assays indicate that under the conditions of our reactions, the enzyme jumps to the acceptor RNA before it dissociates from the first RNA. If no RNA acceptor is present, the enzyme dissociates from (runs off) the donor RNA. Once R2 RT has run off the donor RNA, it is not able to efficiently use the cDNA-RNA product as a primer to reinitiate reverse transcription of the acceptor RNA.Template Jumps Occur Preferentially from the 5′-End of the Donor Template—Based on the size of the abundant cDNA products in Fig. 1 and sequence analysis of isolated products (7Bibillo A. Eickbush T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), most template jumps occurred between the 5′-end of the donor and 3′-end of the acceptor templates. A diffuse range of intermediate sized cDNA products could also be observed (Fig. 1) that could be generated either by jumps onto or from degraded RNA templates or by internal jumps between the RNA templates. Therefore, the first question to be addressed was whether the R2 enzyme could also jump to an acceptor RNA before reaching the 5′-end of the donor.R2 RT is highly processive and rapidly and efficiently extends to the end of the short RNA templates used in these assays (8Bibillo A. Eickbush T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34836-34845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have therefore attempted several methods to block polymerization to determine whether a stalled enzyme could be induced to jump between RNA templates. However, neither hairpin structures in the donor RNA nor long oligonucleotides annealed to the donor RNA induced R2 RT to pause during polymerization (8Bibillo A. Eickbush T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34836-34845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We therefore generated a covalent block on the RNA template. The blockage was generated by psoralen cross-linking an annealed oligonucleotide to the RNA donor 52 nucleotides from its 5′-end. The efficiency of the cross-link was about 20%. As shown in Fig. 2, psoralen cross-linking catalyzed by UV irradiation induced the formation of a cDNA product that was ∼52 nt shorter than the full-length product (comparison of lanes 1 and 4). In these lanes, extension products larger than the 177-nt cDNA were not generated, because the saturating levels of the annealed primer effectively blocked the RT from template jumps onto another donor RNA. In lanes 2 and 5, the 183-nt acceptor RNA was added to the reverse transcription reaction, and in lanes 3 and 6, a different (332-nt) RNA acceptor was added to the reaction. If template jumps from the internal blocked site on the donor had occurred, the jumping products would be about 50 nucleotides shorter than that in the absence of the cross-link. Shorter products than the normal end-to-end jumps were not detected even with extensive overexposure of the appropriate region of the gel (Fig. 2B), suggesting that blocked R2 RT seldom undergo internal template jumps.Fig. 2Physical blocks on the RNA template did not induce template jumps. A, jumping assays with and without a psoralen-cross-linked primer on the donor RNA. The 177-nt donor RNA template was annealed to one primer near its 3′-end to initiate reverse transcription and a psoralen-modified oligonucleotide near its 5′-end. In lanes 1-3, the psoralen nucleotide was cross-linked to the donor RNA by UV radiation. In lanes 4-6, no UV cross-linking was conducted. Lanes 1 and 4, RT reaction without acceptor RNA; lanes 2 and 5, reaction with a 183-nt acceptor RNA; lanes 3 and 6, reaction with a 332-nt acceptor RNA. B, gel scans of lanes 2 and 4 from the gel shown in A. The covalent bound primer blocks polymerization 50 nt from the 5′-end of donor template. Shown at the bottom are the expanded and highly overexposed regions of the gel that would contain the jumps that might arise from the psoralen cross-linked internal site. No cDNA products are seen that are ∼50 nt shorter than the end-to-end jumps. S.D., scan density in arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Additional evidence that R2 RT template jumps could only occur from the 5′-end of the donor RNA came from experiments in which enzyme pausing within the donor RNA was induced by nucleotide depletion. As diagrammed in Fig. 3A, an RNA extension reaction was conducted in the absence of dCTP and dGTP. Under this condition, the polymerase can incorporate four A and T nucleotides before reaching four contiguous G and C residues. As shown by the gel scans in Fig. 3B, the R2 enzyme was efficiently blocked by this approach with about one-half of the cDNA extension products ending at the first G residue of the template and the other half of the cDNA containing one misincorporated nucleotide. To determine whether template jumps could be induced by this pause in the polymerization, an acceptor RNA was added to the reaction that contained seven A and T nucleotides at its 3′-end. If R2 RT was able to jump to the 3′-end of this acceptor RNA, it would incorporate another 7 nucleotides before again being forced to stop at a sequence of adjacent G and C residues. As shown by the second cDNA profile scan in Fig. 3B, no increase in cDNA products ∼7 nt longer than the original blockages were detected. Because the template jumping efficiency can be affected by the dNTPs concentration (see below), a series of similar experiments with different concentrations of dATP and TTP (2.5-250 μm) was conducted. No concentration of nucleotides generated observable jumping products (data not shown). We suggest that R2 RT is extremely inefficient at template jumps from internal positions of the donor RNA.Fig. 3Pauses in reverse transcription did not induce template jumps. A, schematic diagram of the pause-driven assay. RNA templates are shown in gray, whereas the DNA primer and cDNA are shown in black. Reverse transcription is initiated on the donor RNA template, but only four nucleotides can be incorporated because the assay contains only TTP and dATP. The acceptor RNA (AT acceptor) contains a series of seven A and T nucleotides at its 3′-end. If internal jumps from the donor RNA to the end of the acceptor RNA are possible, then the cDNA can be extended another 7 nucleotides. B, PhosphorImager scans of the pause-driven template jumping assay. Gray scan, RT reaction without the AT acceptor RNA; black scan, RT reaction with the AT acceptor RNA. The addition of the AT acceptor RNA did not induce the formation of cDNA products that were ∼7 nt longer than that produced in the absence of the AT acceptor. S.D., scan density in arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of the Structure of the 5′-End of the RNA Donor—End-to-end template jumps require that the 3′-end of the acceptor RNA be positioned near the 5′-end of the donor template and in the proper orientation to the active center of the polymerase. Bulky structures at the 5′-end of the donor template might therefore interfere with such positioning. We tested the efficiency of template jumps from RNA donor templates that contained three types of 5′ ends: a triphosphate generated during typical in vitro transcription reactions, a cap analog (m7G(5′ppp(5′))G), and a 5′-hydroxyl generated by dephosphorylation of the RNA donor. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 4. Up to five template jumps can be seen for all templates. It is important to note that only the first template jump was from the 5′-modified donor 177 RNA. All subsequent jumps were between the 183-nt acceptor RNAs, which contain a triphosphate 5′-end. The yield of template jumps decreased with increasing size of the 5′-overhanging group: 65% of the cDNA reactions underwent a template jump with the 5′-hydroxyl group (lane 2), 44% for the terminal triphosphate (lane 3), and 34% for the 5′ cap structure (lane 1). Thus, the efficiency of the end-to-end template jump decreases with the presence of more bulky structures at the 5′-end of the donor RNA. However, even in the case of the inverted G residue of a 5′ cap, the inhibition was only 2-fold.Fig. 4Effects of the donor template 5′-end on the efficiency of the template jumps. Lane 1, the donor RNA was synthesized with the cap analog, m7G(5′ppp(5′))G; lane 2, donor RNA from a standard T7 reaction was treated with alkaline phosphatase to leave only a 5′-hydroxyl (OH); lane 3, the donor RNA was used directly after standard T7 transcription and thus ends in a 5′-triphosphate (PPP). The yield of end-to-end jumps was calculated as the combined total of all jump products (up to five consecutive jumps can be seen) divided by the total level of cDNA products that are greater than or equal to full-length donor products.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Incorporation of Additional (Nontemplated) Nucleotides during the Template Jumps—Small differences in the length of the cDNA products not undergoing template jumps can be distinguished in Fig. 4. Higher resolution polyacrylamide gel analysis of these “run-off” cDNA products are shown in Fig. 5A (lanes 1, 3, and 5). Shown below this gel are scans of the R2 RT run-off products with position 0 referring to the last position of the RNA template and positions 1-3 referring to the presence of additional (overhanging) nucleotides at the end of the cDNA. Also presented in this figure are run-off products using the RT of the AMV (lanes 2, 4, and 6).Fig. 5Effects of the donor template 5′-end on the efficiency of nontemplated nucleotide incorporation. Run-off assays (i.e. no acceptor RNA) were conducted using the 177-nt donor RNAs with the 5′ structures described in the legend to Fig. 4.

Full-length cDNA products and products 1 base pair shorter than full-length were generated by AMV RT on the 5′-capped RNA. In contrast to AMV RT, the run-off products for R2 RT were longer and more dependent upon the 5′-end of the RNA template. In the case of the RNA with the 5′-hydroxyl, the major product was cDNA that contained three extra nucleotides. For the RNA with the 5′-triphosphate, the cDNA products were nearly equally distributed between those containing 1, 2, or 3 extra nucleotides. Finally, for the 5′-capped RNA, the major cDNA product was the precise length of the RNA template, with the remaining cDNA products containing one or more extra nucleotides. The run-off products are similar whether or not an acceptor RNA is present in the reaction (compare Figs. 4 and 5). In addition, run-off assays conducted in the presence of heparin, which blocks R2 reinitiation (8Bibillo A. Eickbush T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34836-34845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), resulted in the same extension profiles (data not shown). Thus, the addition of extra nucleotides by R2 RT occurs before the enzyme falls off of the RNA template and not after reinitiation and extension of the cDNA. The ability to add extra nucleotides when a polymerase reaches the end of its polynucleotide substrate has been observed with other nucleic acid polymerases (16Clark J.M.

HRI contains a tightly bound heme at the N-terminal domain. Earlier reports show that nitric oxide (NO) regulates HRI catalysis. However, the mechanism of this process remains unclear. In the present study, we utilize in vitro kinase assays, optical absorption, electron spin resonance (ESR), and resonance Raman spectra of purified full-length HRI for the first time to elucidate the regulation mechanism of NO. HRI was activated via heme upon NO binding, and the Fe(II)-HRI(NO) complex displayed 5-fold greater eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase activity than the Fe(III)-HRI complex.

Phosphorylated eIF2 binds eIF2B and inhibits the guanine nucleotide exchanging activity required for protein synthesis. HRI regulates globin synthesis in reticulocytes in response to heme availability. Earlier studies show that HRI contains two heme-binding sites. One heme is tightly bound to the N-terminal domain, whereas the other interacts weakly with the catalytic domain (5Rafie-Kolpin M. Chefalo P.J. Hussain Z. Hahn J. Uma S. Matts R.L. Chen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5171-5178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Under conditions of heme deficiency, HRI becomes active and phosphorylates the α-subunit of eIF2 at Ser51. It is proposed that interaction of the second heme with the catalytic domain suppresses catalysis, whereas heme deficiency leads to dissociation of heme from the catalytic domain and initiation of catalysis. In iron-deficient HRI–/– mice, globins are devoid of the heme aggregate within red blood cells and precursors, resulting in hyperchromic, normocytic anemia with decreased red cell blood count, compensatory erythroid hyperplasia, and accelerated apoptosis in bone marrow and spleen (6Han A.P.

HRI is additionally activated by other environmental and chemical stimuli, including nitric oxide (NO), heat shock, oxidative stress, denatured proteins, and sulfhydryl-reactive reagents (3Chen J.J.

However, to date, there have been no reports on the biochemical and physicochemical characterization of the HRI holoenzyme. Elucidation of the roles of heme and NO in catalysis as well as the structure of full-length HRI in the absence of the second heme should be particularly useful to determine the molecular mechanism of globin synthesis in reticulocytes. In the present report, we examine, for the first time, the effects of the redox state of heme and NO on catalysis by full-length HRI enzyme in the absence of the second heme, using an in vitro kinase assay. Various spectroscopic methods (including optical absorption, ESR, and resonance Raman) are applied to the system. Our data show that one of the axial ligands of the Fe(III) complex is thiolate and that NO-induced activation is accompanied by the formation of a five-coordinate NO-heme complex in HRI. These findings are distinct from the results obtained for HRI-NTD. We further discuss the heme environment of HRI and the possibility that HRI is a novel heme-based sensor protein (12Rodgers K.R.

Plasmid Construction—To construct a plasmid coding for His6-tagged HRI comprising residues 1–619 (His6 HRI), mouse liver cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CTCCGAATTCATATGCTGGG-3′ and 5′-GGATGGGACACCGGACTTAAGAC-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into the pBluescript II SK(+) cloning vector (Stratagene). The nucleotide sequence was confirmed using an automatic Shimadzu DSQ-2000L sequencer (Kyoto, Japan). The vector was digested with NdeI and EcoRI, and the isolated fragment was inserted into pET-28a (+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). Next, the HRI expression vector, pET-28a/HRI, was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) Codon Plus RIL (Stratagene). For generating His6-tagged eIF2α containing amino acid residues 1–315 (His6 eIF2α), the above strategy was employed using the primers 5′-ACACATCGAATTCCATATGCCGGGC-3′ and 5′-CCGTTTGTCAGCTTAAGTTCCTCATG-3′. Protein Expression and Purification—His6 HRI was expressed from E. coli BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus harboring pET-28a/HRI (15Rafie-Kolpin M. Han A.P. Chen J.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6536-6544Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (16Berlanga J.J. Herrero S. de Haro C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11543-11551Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cell lysates containing apo-His6 HRI were reconstituted with 50 μm hemin dissolved in 0.1 m NaOH for 30 min at 4 °C (except for preparation of the apo form), fractionated with ammonium sulfate, and subjected to DEAE-cellulose (DE52, Whatman, Maidstone, UK) and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen K.K., Tokyo, Japan) chromatography. Concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye binding method for protein (Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and the pyridine hemochromogen method for heme. His6 eIF2α was expressed and purified according to a previous report (18Zhu S. Sobolev A.Y. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In Vitro Protein Kinase Assay—The in vitro protein kinase assay was conducted as described previously, with some modifications (19Chen J.J. Yang J.M. Petryshyn R. Kosower N. London I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9559-9564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 60 mm KCl, 2 μg of His6 eIF2α, 500 ng of His6 HRI, and 50 μm ATP was incubated at 15 °C for 10 min. This process was performed under anaerobic conditions by monitoring absorption spectra. NO solutions were prepared using the NO donor (NOC9; Sigma) in kinase reaction buffer. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli's sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.002% bromphenol blue) for 10 min at 95 °C and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Phosphorylated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphorylated eIF2α antibody. Primary mouse anti-His6 monoclonal IgM (H-3), rabbit anti-eIF2α IgG (FL-315), and goat anti-phosphorylated eIF2α IgG (Ser52) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). For immunoblotting, the membrane was blocked for 1 h with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated overnight at room temperature with primary antibody diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG, donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences), or donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized using an ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Optical Absorption Spectra—Spectral experiments under aerobic conditions were performed on a Shimadzu Multispec 1500 spectrophotometer maintained at 25 °C. Anaerobic spectral experiments were conducted on a Shimadzu UV-1650 spectrophotometer at 15 °C in an anaerobic glove box (Hirasawa, Tokyo, Japan). ESR Measurements—Fe(III)-HRI complexes were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 12% glycerol at 25 °C for ESR measurements. ESR spectra were recorded on a JEOL FE-3X spectrometer (Tokyo, Japan) at 20 K. The magnetic field was calibrated using an NMR gauss meter (Echo Electronics; model EFM-2000), and temperature was controlled with an Oxford ITC4 cryosystem. The Fe(II)-NO complex was formed by adding NO gas to the sodium dithionite-reduced anaerobic Fe(II)-HRI sample (360 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. NO gas was formed under anaerobic conditions by reducing NaNO2 with an aqueous solution of sodium ascorbate in a Thunberg-type tube, with a side arm on a vacuum line. ESR spectra were recorded on a JEOL JES-TE200 spectrometer at 77 K, using a liquid nitrogen Dewar. Resonance Raman Measurements—The Fe(III)-HRI complex (25 μm, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was placed in an air-tight spinning cell with a rubber septum and reduced by the addition of sodium dithionite at a final concentration of 10 mm. 15NO and 13C18O (Shoko, Tokyo, Japan) gas was collected from a gas cylinder. Raman scattering was performed by excitation at 413.1 or 406.7 nm with a krypton ion laser (Spectra Physics; model 2016). Excitation light was focused into the cell at laser power of 5 mW for the Fe(II)-HRI and Fe(III)-HRI complexes, and 0.1–0.2 mW for the Fe(II)-HRI(CO) and Fe(II)-HRI(NO) complexes to avoid photolysis. Raman spectra were detected with a CCD camera attached to a single polychrometer (Ritsu Oyokagaku; model DG-1000). Raman shifts were calibrated with indene. Protein Purification—Purified His6 HRI was more than 95% homogenous, as determined by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (Fig. 1A). Purified HRI reconstituted with hemin displayed an apparent molecular mass of 91,700 Da and contained 0.84 mol of heme/mol of protein, indicating a stoichiometry of one heme at the N-terminal domain per subunit. Gel filtration analysis using Superose 6 (Amersham Biosciences) revealed that heme-reconstituted His6 HRI has a molecular mass of nearly 560 kDa (data not shown), similar to previously described His6 HRI (640 kDa) and native HRI (420 kDa) (17Bauer B.N. Rafie-Kolpin M. Lu L. Han A. Chen J.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11543-11551Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is well established that native HRI from reticulocyte forms a homodimer with elongated shape, although the molecular mass estimated by gel filtration appears variable, depending on experimental conditions. The difference in molecular mass (80 kDa) between the present and previous results may be due to different conditions of gel filtration column chromatographies. The yield of HRI was low at 0.2 mg/liter of culture. Optical Absorption Spectra—We examined the absolute absorption spectra of highly purified HRI under various conditions. Absorption spectra of the reconstituted Fe(III), Fe(II), and Fe(II)-CO complexes of HRI are depicted in Fig. 1B. Spectral parameters are compared with those of other heme proteins in Table I. Soret absorption maxima of the Fe(III), Fe(II), and Fe(II)-CO forms of HRI were observed at 418, 426, and 421 nm, respectively. Spectral data on the Fe(III) complex revealed characteristic six-coordinate low spin heme complexes similar to those of CooA (a CO-sensing transcription factor from Rho-dospirillum rubrum) (20Aono S.

The Soret absorption of the Fe(III) complex appeared comparatively broad with a shoulder at around 360 nm, distinct from that of the isolated heme binding domain, HRI-NTD (Fig. 1, B and C). The optical absorption spectrum of the Fe(II)-HRI complex displayed peaks at 426, 531, and 560 nm, signifying six-coordinate low spin heme. The spectrum of the Fe(II)-HRI complex is similar to those of CooA (20Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Okada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The peak of the Fe(II)-HRI(CO) complex in the Soret region was located at around 420 nm, compared with 450 nm for cytochrome P450, suggesting that the proximal ligand is unlikely to be thiolate as in HRI-NTD (11Igarashi J.

Open table in a new tab Upon the addition of NO to the Fe(II)-HRI complex, the Soret band shifted from 426 to 398 nm and decreased in intensity (Fig. 1B). The addition of NO to the Fe(III)-HRI complex resulted in a shift in the Soret peak to 398 nm, indicating reductive nitrosylation of the complex, leading to the formation of a Fe(II)-HRI(NO) complex (data not shown), as reported for Hb (26Addison A.W. Stephanos J.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4104-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The Soret band of the Fe(II)-HRI(NO) complex at around 400 nm is characteristic of a five-coordinate NO-heme complex, analogous to sGC (27Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5636-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), CBS (28Taoka S. Banerjee R. J. Inorg.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4115-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and is distinct from spectra of the six-coordinate NO-heme, which contain Soret bands at around 415–425 nm (Table I). The spectral pattern of HRI in response to NO is different from that of HRI-NTD, which displays a Soret band at 422 nm characteristic of a six-coordinate NO-heme (Fig. 1C). Despite the loss of both endogenous axial ligands following NO binding to the Fe(II)-HRI complex, the five-coordinate NO-heme did not dissociate from HRI on a gel filtration column. A spectrum of the Fe(II)-O2 complex was not obtained due to its high autoxidation rate. In Vitro eIF2α Kinase Assay—A previous study on HRI in rabbit reticulocyte lysates showed that NO binds to the heme iron and stimulates kinase activity, whereas binding of CO to the heme iron suppresses kinase activity (7Uma S. Yun B.G. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14875-14883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is possible that in this system, regulation of HRI by NO or CO is mediated through interaction with HSP90 and its partner protein or modification of cysteine by NO. The effects of NO and CO on eIF2α kinase activities of highly purified HRI require examination to confirm these hypotheses. In this report, we investigate whether CO and NO directly affect eIF2α kinase activity of HRI via interactions with heme. To determine the effects of NO and CO on HRI activity, we employed highly purified protein (expressed in E. coli at 15 °C) in an in vitro kinase assay, using His6 eIF2α as a substrate. As shown above, purified HRI contains only one heme in the N-terminal domain and releases the heme from the second binding site in the catalytic domain. Heme redox and coordination states were simultaneously monitored with a spectrophotometer. The Fe(II)-HRI complex displayed 2.4-fold higher kinase activity than the Fe(III)-HRI complex oxidized with potassium ferricyanide (Fig. 2A). Upon binding of NO to the Fe(II)-HRI complex, kinase activity was increased by 2-fold and eventually up to 5-fold, compared with the Fe(III)-HRI complex, at a concentration of 10 μm NOC9. NO-induced activation was not observed in the heme-deficient apo form of HRI (Fig. 2C). Rather, NO inhibited eIF2α activity in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, it is evident that NO-induced activation is closely associated with the heme prosthetic group. The Fe(II)-HRI(CO) complex displayed 1.2-fold higher activity than the CO-free Fe(III)-HRI complex (Fig. 2B). Notably, purified HRI did not incorporate 32Pi in the in vitro kinase assay using [γ-32P]ATP as a substrate, suggesting that the protein is already hyperphosphorylated in E. coli (15Rafie-Kolpin M. Han A.P. Chen J.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6536-6544Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, in comparison with previous reports, basal activity on eIF2α was high and not significantly down-regulated upon the addition of heme (7Uma S. Yun B.G. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14875-14883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that purified HRI is less sensitive to inhibition induced by binding of the second heme. An earlier investigation shows that HRI expressed in E. coli at 13 °C is hyperphosphorylated (particularly at Thr485 in the activation loop) (15Rafie-Kolpin M. Han A.P. Chen J.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6536-6544Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We additionally examined HRI activity on eIF2α following digestion of the His tag with thrombin. No significant differences in HRI activity were observed between substrate proteins with and without the tag, thus eliminating the possibility of His tag interaction. ESR Spectra—The ESR spectrum of the Fe(III)-HRI-NTD complex displayed major signals at g = 3.05, 2.20 and 1.46, implying that low spin heme has His/His as axial ligands, analogous to bovine liver cytochrome b5 (g = 3.03, 2.23, and 1.43) (10Ishikawa H.

Having previously shown that the N-terminal half of GRP94 can account for the peptide binding activity of the full-length protein, we now locate this binding site by testing predictions of a molecular docking model. The best predicted site was on the opposite face of the β sheet from the pan-HSP90 radicicol-binding pocket, in close proximity to a deep hydrophobic pocket. The peptide and radicicol-binding sites are distinct, as shown by the ability of a radicicol-refractive mutant to bind peptide. When the fluorophore acrylodan is attached to Cys117 within the hydrophobic pocket, its fluorescence is reduced upon peptide binding, consistent with proximity of the two ligands. Substitution of His125, which contacts the bound peptide, compromises peptide-binding activity. We conclude that peptide binds to the concave face of the β sheet of the N-terminal domain, where binding is regulated during the action cycle of the chaperone.

Med. 1997; 186: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) and stimulation of innate immunity (2Singh-Jasuja H. Scherer H.U. Hilf N. Arnold-Schild D. Rammensee H.G. Toes R.E. Schild H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2211-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Because of these activities, tumor-derived GRP94 can be used to elicit immune response against the tumor and is potentially a powerful immunotherapeutic tool (3Tamura Y. Peng P. Liu K. Daou M. Srivastava P.K. Science. 1997; 278: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The antigen-presentation activity was shown not to be due to any mutation in GRP94 that would enhance its immunogenicity, but rather due to its ability to bind peptides (1Blachere N.E. Li Z. Chandawarkar R.Y. Suto R. Jaikaria N.S. Basu S. Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 4Suto R. Srivastava P.K. Science. 1995; 269: 1585-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The GRP94-peptide complexes are known to be taken up by a subset of antigen-presenting cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis (5Binder R.J. Han D.K. Srivastava P.K. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), and the chaperoned peptides are then re-presented on endogenous antigen-presenting cells MHC class I molecules on the cell surface. Although peptide binding is a general activity of many molecular chaperones, it has been argued that GRP94 is among the most effective of such chaperones in enhancing antigen presentation. Despite its importance, the GRP94-peptide interaction and the identity of the peptide-binding site have not been characterized in detail. They are crucial issues toward understanding the immunostimulatory action of GRP94. The mode of peptide binding by GRP94 may also inform about its activity as a chaperone of selected membrane-bound and secreted proteins (6Argon Y. Simen B.B. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), although the connection between the two activities is yet to be elucidated. The same questions are also unanswered for all other HSP90 chaperones, despite the central role of these cytosolic chaperones in organizing signaling complexes and regulating transcription factor (6Argon Y. Simen B.B. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Several peptides derived from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) have been shown to bind GRP94. VSV8 is an octamer (RGYVYQGL) from the N protein of VSV and is the dominant T cell epitope of the virus, presented via MHC class I Kb to specific T cells (7Imarai M. Goyarts E.C. van Bleek G.M. Nathenson S.G. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 160: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The structure of a complex of this peptide with MHC class I has been solved (8Zhang W. Young A.C. Imarai M. Nathenson S.G. Sacchettini J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8403-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). VSV8 has been eluted from GRP94 purified from a VSV N protein-transfected cell line (9Nieland T.J. Tan M.C. Monne-van Muijen M. Koning F. Kruisbeek A.M. van Bleek G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6135-6139Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and the peptide has been shown to bind directly to purified GRP94 in vitro (1Blachere N.E. Li Z. Chandawarkar R.Y. Suto R. Jaikaria N.S. Basu S. Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Peptide A is a 15-mer (KRQIYTDLEMNRLGK) from the glycoprotein of the virus and is not known to be immunogenic (1Blachere N.E. Li Z. Chandawarkar R.Y. Suto R. Jaikaria N.S. Basu S. Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 10Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5709-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, this peptide binds GRP94, as do other peptides from the VSV G protein, including LSSLFRPKRRPIYKS (1Blachere N.E. Li Z. Chandawarkar R.Y. Suto R. Jaikaria N.S. Basu S. Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Another viral peptide known to bind GRP94 is YVNTNMG from the core protein of hepatitis B virus, which is similar to a known HLA-A11 antigenic peptide (12Meng S.D. Gao T. Gao G.F. Tien P. Lancet. 2001; 357: 528-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The only non-viral peptides rigorously shown to bind GRP94 are the ovalbumin 257SIINFEKL264 peptide (13Breloer M. Marti T. Fleischer B. von Bonin A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1016-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and a mouse leukemia tumor antigen IPGLPLSL from a mutated Akt (14Ishii T. Udono H. Yamano T. Ohta H. Uenaka A. Ono T. Hizuta A. Tanaka N. Srivastava P.K. Nakayama E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1303-1309PubMed Google Scholar). No common sequence motif is obvious from comparing these peptides. Spee and Neefjes (15Spee P. Neefjes J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) used radioactive peptides with photo-reactive side chains to explore the peptide preferences of GRP94. No obvious size preference was found, and even 40-mers could bind the chaperone. The only sequence specificity found was that 9-mers with basic or acidic amino acids in positions 2 and 9 bind relatively weakly to GRP94. In two cases, the VSV N-derived and the RBL tumor-derived antigens (1Blachere N.E. Li Z. Chandawarkar R.Y. Suto R. Jaikaria N.S. Basu S. Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 14Ishii T. Udono H. Yamano T. Ohta H. Uenaka A. Ono T. Hizuta A. Tanaka N. Srivastava P.K. Nakayama E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1303-1309PubMed Google Scholar) not only are the octamer antigenic peptide associated with GRP94, but also their larger precursors. This raises the question of what sequence or structure features are compatible with peptide binding to GRP94. The limited amount of information about the peptide binding activity of GRP94 is due in part to the low stoichiometry of binding (only about 1% of the protein had been shown to bind peptides (16Baker-LePain J.C. Reed R.C. Nicchitta C.V. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)) and slow binding kinetics (17Vogen S.M. Gidalevitz T. Biswas C. Simen B.S. Stein E. Gulmen F. Argon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40742-40750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These technical obstacles also hindered the identification of structural determinants of the peptide-binding site and its regulation. We showed that the N-terminal third of GRP94 constituted a peptide-binding entity and demonstrated that peptide binding to this fragment is specific, is inhibited by the pan-HSP90 inhibitors radicicol and geldanamycin, and has a binding stoichiometry close to 1 mole of peptide per mole of GRP94 (17Vogen S.M. Gidalevitz T. Biswas C. Simen B.S. Stein E. Gulmen F. Argon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40742-40750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, our data indicated that the peptide specificity of this site is different from that of another endoplasmic reticulum-resident stress protein, BiP (17Vogen S.M. Gidalevitz T. Biswas C. Simen B.S. Stein E. Gulmen F. Argon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40742-40750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present work we use molecular modeling, biochemical characterization, and site-directed mutagenesis to identify a peptide-binding site located within the N-terminal domain, on the face opposite the radicicol-binding site, and show that His125 is located in the binding site and is directly involved in the binding activity. N1–355—The construct for expression of N1–355 in insect cells and the purification procedure are described previously (17Vogen S.M. Gidalevitz T. Biswas C. Simen B.S. Stein E. Gulmen F. Argon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40742-40750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recombinant N1–355 contained an N-terminal His6 tag, followed by the first 355 amino acids of a mature sequence of GRP94 and a C-terminal ER1 targeting signal KDEL. N34–355—The sequence coding for the first 33 amino acids of N1–355 was deleted by PCR cloning. The resultant PCR product was inserted into the pQEXa vector (Qiagen) using BamH1 and XmaI so as to add a His6 tag followed by a factor Xa recognition sequence at N terminus. The plasmid was transformed into M15 Escherichia coli, which were allowed to grow to mid-log phase and then incubated with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 27 °C to induce protein expression. Bacteria were harvested and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma Chemicals) in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 500 mm NaCl and 20 mm imidazole. N34–355 was purified from the detergent lysates by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA columns (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bound proteins were eluted with 500 mm imidazole, dialyzed, and concentrated. The protein was stored in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 110 mm KOAc, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.1 mm CaCl2 (buffer A) containing 10–20% sucrose at -80 °C. When needed, the N-terminal extension containing the His6 tag was removed by digestion with factor Xa (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction mixture was re-purified over a Ni-NTA column, and the flowthrough containing only the cleaved N34–355 was used. The cleaved protein appeared 2–3 kDa smaller on SDS-PAGE compared with the parent protein, consistent with the removal of 17 amino acids (not shown). After digestion, the heptamer PYNGTGS precedes Ala34 of the mature N34–355 sequence. Mutant Proteins—Amino acids substitutions were introduced into the vector encoding N34–355 with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Mutations were verified by sequencing and, when appropriate, by restriction enzyme analyses. The proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified as described above. Peptides were synthesized at the University of Chicago facility and verified by mass spectroscopy. The sequences of the two binder peptides were: VSV8, RGYVYQGL, from the VSV N protein; Pep A, KRQIYTDLEMNRLGK, from the VSV G protein. Stock solutions were prepared in water and stored at -80 °C. Peptide concentrations were determined by a BCA assay (Pierce). Where indicated, peptides were iodinated by the IODO-BEADs method (Pierce), and unincorporated iodine was removed by passage over a short Dowex AG 1-X8 column. The specific radioactivity of the peptides was routinely 2 × 1014 to 1 × 1015 cpm/mol. Two types of binding assays were used. The solution binding assay was performed as described previously (17Vogen S.M. Gidalevitz T. Biswas C. Simen B.S. Stein E. Gulmen F. Argon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40742-40750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant proteins were incubated with iodinated peptide under saturating conditions, and radioactivity associated with protein-peptide complexes was measured after separation of free peptide over spin columns containing 0.2–0.8 ml of packed P-30 beads (Bio-Rad) in buffer A. Iodinated peptide without protein was used as background control for spin column separation. A solid-phase binding assay (referred to as plate assay in the text) is described and validated elsewhere. 2C. Biswas, T. Gidalevilz, and Y. Argon, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, 96-well plates (Costar 3590 High Binding, Corning, NY) were coated with peptides prior to assay, and the recombinant proteins in 100 μl of buffer A were allowed to bind for 90 min. Binding was quantified by HRP-rabbit anti-His6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and color development was monitored at 415 nm with a BioTek plate reader. Because both N1–355 and N34–355 normally reached saturation at the input level of 0.7 or 1 μg, the A415 value at this level was defined as 1, and all data points were normalized to it. Inhibition by 300 μm radicicol (Sigma; stock solution in Me2SO) was used as a specificity control. Because peptide binding to GRP94 is saturable and specific, yet the off-rate is exceedingly slow (17Vogen S.M. Gidalevitz T. Biswas C. Simen B.S. Stein E. Gulmen F. Argon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40742-40750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), Ka values were estimated graphically from the fractional occupancy curves (A415 value at a given protein input relative to A415 value at saturation as a function of protein input). When the binding reaction is not in equilibrium, these values are valid as comparative parameters among the various mutants. Analysis of protein conformation by blue native gel electrophoresis was accomplished by using 5–15% gradient acrylamide gels in the Laemmli gel system without SDS (18Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Analyt. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar), with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Sigma Chemicals) included in the cathode buffer. Thyroglobulin, ferritin, and bovine serum albumin were used as molecular weight standards. Binding of the fluorescent dye 8-ANS (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to proteins was performed by incubating 5 μm ANS with 0.5 μm of the appropriate N355 construct in 500 μl of buffer A. For acrylodan (6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene) modification, recombinant protein (10 μm) was incubated at 4 °C overnight in the presence of 100 μm acrylodan (Molecular Probes) in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.9, and free acrylodan was removed using a spin column. For the experiments measuring the effect of peptide on N355-acrylodan, peptide was added to the final concentration of 100 μm; equivalent volume of buffer was added to control samples. The mixtures were heat-shocked at 50 °C for 10 min and diluted to 500 μl, and fluorescence measurements were performed on a PTI fluorometer. Samples were excited at 350 nm for ANS and 390 nm for acrylodan, and the emission spectra were collected between 400 and 600 nm. The slit widths were set at 2 nm for excitation and 2–6 nm for emission. Before modification of histidines with DEPC, wild type, or H125D N34–355 (800 μg each) were treated with 24 units of factor Xa (Novagen) in buffer A overnight at 25 °C and then repurified using Xarexagarose (Novagen) to remove factor Xa and Ni-NTA-agarose to remove the His6-containing peptide. The His-cleaved proteins were reacted with peptide A (or solvent alone) at 12 μm protein and 2.8 mm peptide in buffer A overnight at 25 °C. Free peptide was removed, and the buffer was exchanged to 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8, using P10 spin columns. Both free N34–355 and the protein-peptide complexes were reacted with 1 mm DEPC (Sigma Chemical Co.) at 25 °C or with EtOH as a solvent control. Incubation for 15–20 min gave complete His modification, as determined by monitoring the reaction at 240 nm (19Kalkum M. Przybylski M. Glocker M.O. Bioconjug. Chem. 1998; 9: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the carbethoxyhistidine was reverted back to histidine by treatment with 400 mm hydroxylamine for 15 min at 25 °C (20Rai S.S. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31131-31137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Samples were diluted to 20 μm final concentration in sinapinic acid saturated with acetonitrile and 1% trifluoroacetic acid. 1–2 μl of each sample was adsorbed onto a Ciphergen gold chip and allowed to air dry. Masses were measured by using the surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight ProteinChip Reader (Ciphergen). GRP94-bound Peptide Is Contained within a 188-Residue Fragment—Previously we demonstrated that a truncated version of GRP94, containing amino acids 1–355, is sufficient to account for the ability of the full-length protein to bind immunologically relevant peptides, such as the VSV major T cell antigen, VSV8. We also showed that this activity was subject to regulation by the pan-HSP90 inhibitors radicicol and geldanamycin (17Vogen S.M. Gidalevitz T. Biswas C. Simen B.S. Stein E. Gulmen F. Argon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40742-40750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To further locate this peptide-binding site, a shorter version of recombinant GRP94 that lacked the first 33 amino acids of the mature protein (N34–355, Fig. 1A) was cloned and over expressed in E. coli. This recombinant protein bound VSV8 with a binding curve very similar to that of N1–355 (Fig. 1B), showing that the first 33 amino acids are not essential for the peptide-binding activity. To define an even smaller fragment containing the peptide-binding site, we took advantage of the single thrombin site in N34–355, C-terminal to Arg222, and asked whether a complex of N34–355 and peptide remains intact after cleavage with thrombin. Following the digestion, two bands were detectable by Coomassie Blue staining corresponding to the predicted N-terminal 22.4-kDa and C-terminal 14.6-kDa fragments (Fig. 1C). The assignment of the fragments was confirmed by antibodies specific to either the N terminus of N34–355 (anti-His6) or to residues 261–276 near the C terminus (9G10 (21Robert J. Menoret A. Basu S. Cohen N. Srivastava P.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). Because the GRP94-peptide complex is resistant to SDS (1Blachere N.E. Li Z. Chandawarkar R.Y. Suto R. Jaikaria N.S. Basu S. Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 17Vogen S.M. Gidalevitz T. Biswas C. Simen B.S. Stein E. Gulmen F. Argon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40742-40750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) peptide-bound protein fragments can be detected after SDS-PAGE by the radioactivity of the bound iodinated peptide. In the absence of thrombin, a radioactive band corresponding to the uncleaved complex was detectable. After partial thrombin digestion, an additional radiolabeled band of apparent molecular mass of 22.4 kDa was detected after SDS-PAGE separation, whereas the other 14.6-kDa fragment was not labeled (Fig. 1C). These data suggest, therefore, that amino acids 34–222 of GRP94 are sufficient to retain the bound peptide. Molecular Modeling of the GRP94-Peptide Complex—We next took advantage of previously published data (22Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 23Roe S.M. Prodromou C. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) to create a computer model of potential peptide-binding sites. First, we used the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of HSP90 (Protein Data Bank files 1YER and 1A4H) to generate an energy minimized, predicted structure of the highly homologous segment of GRP94 (51% identity between yeast HSP82 and mouse GRP94). Second, we used the known structure of the antigenic peptide VSV8, which was determined in association with MHC class I (2MHC (8Zhang W. Young A.C. Imarai M. Nathenson S.G. Sacchettini J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8403-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar)). Third, making the simplifying assumption that the conformation of VSV8, when bound to GRP94, is essentially similar to its conformation when bound to MHC class I, we used the docking algorithm Patch-Dock (24Schneidman-Duhovny D. Inbar Y. Polak V. Shatsky M. Halperin I. Benyamini H. Barzilai A. Dror O. Haspel N. Nussinov R. Wolfson H.J. Proteins. 2003; 52: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) to predict potential binding sites. The algorithm searches the protein surface for locations with highest geometric shape complementarity to the ligand molecule and docks the ligand into these locations. Such docking solutions usually produce clusters in different protein cavities, because binding in cavities enables greater shape complementarity. In addition, statistical data about atomic contacts of VSV8 with MHC class I was collected and used to score the docking solutions. The highest scoring solutions in terms of shape complementarity and statistical score were selected. The Peptide-binding Site Is Distinct from the Radicicol-binding Pocket—The seven best solutions mapped to two potential docking sites. One site overlaps with the radicicol-binding pocket (Fig 2A), the largest cavity in the protein. This site was considered unlikely, because previous data showed that radicicol and peptide could bind simultaneously. We therefore asked whether mutants that did not bind radicicol could still bind peptides. Relying on the solved structure of the complex between yeast HSP90 N-terminal domain and radicicol (23Roe S.M. Prodromou C. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) and on the similarity between HSP90 and GRP94 (25Schulte T.W. Akinaga S. Murakata T. Agatsuma T. Sugimoto S. Nakano H. Lee Y.S. Simen B.B. Argon Y. Felts S. Toft D.O. Neckers L.M. Sharma S.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we mutated residues Asp128 and Gly132 simultaneously, to Asn and Ala, respectively. Asp93 in HSP90 (corresponding to Asp128 in GRP94) makes a crucial hydrogen bond with radicicol, and Gly97 packs tightly against the inhibitor and also serves to position helix 4, an important portion of the binding pocket (22Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 23Roe S.M. Prodromou C. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 26Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). The D93N mutant of HSP90 does not bind ATP (27Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), so the double mutant of GRP94 was expected to be unable to bind radicicol. Recombinant N34–355 D128N,G132A mutant (RadR) was soluble, mostly monomeric, and expressed the conformation-sensitive epitope for the antibody 9G10, like the wild type protein. To test whether the RadR mutant binds radicicol, we used two functional tests (see Ref. 17Vogen S.M. Gidalevitz T. Biswas C. Simen B.S. Stein E. Gulmen F. Argon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40742-40750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar for details): loss of the 9G10 epitope and acquisition of a compact conformation with increased mobility in native blue gels. Both changes have been shown to reflect the conformational change in the protein upon radicicol binding (17Vogen S.M. Gidalevitz T. Biswas C. Simen B.S. Stein E. Gulmen F. Argon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40742-40750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The resultant mutant was refractive to treatment with radicicol, as judged by the continued exposure of the 9G10 epitope (data not shown) and lack of acquisition of a compact conformation (Fig. 3A). Despite lack of radicicol binding, the RadR protein bound peptide effectively (Fig. 3C), with only a small reduction in the apparent association constant compared with the WT protein. Consistent with the lack of radicicol binding, the peptide-binding activity of RadR mutant was not inhibited by pre-treatment with radicicol, whereas the activity of wild type N34–355 was inhibited significantly (Fig. 3B). We conclude that not only is the peptide-binding site within N34–355 distinct from the radicicol-binding site (17Vogen S.M. Gidalevitz T. Biswas C. Simen B.S. Stein E. Gulmen F. Argon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40742-40750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but abolition of inhibitor binding does not affect the ability to bind peptides.Fig. 3The radicicol-refractive mutant N34–355 D128N,G132A still binds peptide.A, D128N, G132A mutant of N34–355 (RadR) is refractive to radicicol treatment. N34–355 (WT) and RadR proteins were incubated for 15 min with either Me2SO or radicicol and resolved on a blue native gel. Radicicol-bound WT protein migrates through the gel more rapidly, due to a conformational change in the protein (17Vogen S.M. Gidalevitz T. Biswas C. Simen B.S. Stein E. Gulmen F. Argon Y. J. Biol.

Black arrow, unmodified protein; white arrow, radicicol-bound protein. B, peptide binding by RadR mutant is not affected by radicicol and is similar at saturation to that of WT protein.

Side barriers to this saddle are provided by two loops, Asp170-Arg222 and Lys119-Asn122, plus part of a strand H (Val260-Ser263) that is the end of the modeled sequence (Fig. 2B). Four of the highest scoring solutions predicted that VSV8 could fit well within this saddle (Fig. 2B).

https://openalex.org/W2086291066,"Kre2p/Mnt1p is a Golgi α1,2-mannosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall glycoproteins. The protein belongs to glycosyltransferase family 15, a member of which has been implicated in virulence of Candida albicans. We present the 2.0 Å crystal structures of the catalytic domain of Kre2p/Mnt1p and its binary and ternary complexes with GDP/Mn2+ and GDP/Mn2+/acceptor methyl-α-mannoside. The protein has a mixed α/β fold similar to the glycosyltransferase-A (GT-A) fold. Although the GDP-mannose donor was used in the crystallization experiments and the GDP moiety is bound tightly to the active site, the mannose is not visible in the electron density. The manganese is coordinated by a modified DXD motif (EPD), with only the first glutamate involved in a direct interaction. The position of the donor mannose was modeled using the binary and ternary complexes of other GT-A enzymes. The C1″ of the modeled donor mannose is within hydrogen-bonding distance of both the hydroxyl of Tyr220 and the O2 of the acceptor mannose. The O2 of the acceptor mannose is also within hydrogen bond distance of the hydroxyl of Tyr220. The structures, modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic analysis suggest two possible catalytic mechanisms. Either a double-displacement mechanism with the hydroxyl of Tyr220 as the potential nucleophile or alternatively, an SNi-like mechanism with Tyr220 positioning the substrates for catalysis. The importance of Tyr220 in both mechanisms is highlighted by a 3000-fold reduction in kcat in the Y220F mutant.

The α1,2-mannosyltransferase Kre2p/Mnt1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is involved in both N-linked outer chain and O-linked oligosaccharide synthesis (for review, see Ref. 1Lussier M. Sdicu A.M.

Acta. 1999; 1426: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and five from the human pathogen Candida albicans (3Thomson L.M. Bates S. Yamazaki S. Arisawa M. Aoki Y. Gow N.A. J. Biol.

Kre2p/Mnt1p from S. cerevisiae is the most extensively studied member of this family. The enzyme is a type II Golgi membrane glycoprotein of 51 kDa with a short cytoplasmic N terminus of 11 amino acids, followed by a membrane spanning domain of ∼19 amino acids, a 90-residue stem region and a large luminal C-terminal catalytic domain containing a single N-glycan. The protein was first purified as an enzymatically active soluble form lacking the N-terminal transmembrane domain and cloned using degenerate oligonucleotides for PCR (5Haüsler A. Ballou L. Ballou C.E. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6846-6850Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 6Haüsler A. Robbins P.W. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). At the same time, the KRE2/MNT1 gene was characterized in a screen of mutants resistant to the K1 killer toxin (7Hill K. Boone C. Goebl M. Puccia R. Sdicu A.-M. Bussey H. Genetics. 1992; 130: 273-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kre2p/Mnt1p is the major α1,2-mannosyltransferase activity detected in cell-free extracts using methyl-α-mannoside as the acceptor. A truncated enzyme lacking the N-terminal transmembrane domain was produced in a soluble secreted form in Pichia pastoris (8Romero P.A. Lussier M. Sdicu A.M. Bussey H. Herscovics A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The specificity of the recombinant enzyme is consistent with studies in vivo showing that it is involved in the addition of the second and third α1,2-linked mannose residues in the linear O-linked carbohydrate chains and that it participates in the elaboration of the outer chains of N-linked oligosaccharides (7Hill K.

Other members of the family (Ktr1p, Ktr3p, Yur1p, and Ktr2p) have similar, and in some cases partially redundant functions in yeast mannoprotein biosynthesis in vivo (for review, see Ref. 1Lussier M. Sdicu A.M. Bussey H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Ktr6p/Mnn6p has been described in the literature to be a mannosylphosphate transferase (10Wang X.H. Nakayama K. Shimma Y. Tanaka A. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18117-18124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) while no function has yet been ascribed to Ktr4p, Ktr5p, and Ktr7p. A C. albicans member of this enzyme family called CaMnt1p, has been implicated in adhesion and virulence of this human pathogen (11Buurman E.T. Westwater C. Hube B. Brown A.J. Odds F.C. Gow N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, determination of the structure and catalytic mechanism of this enzyme family will be valuable for the development of new antifungal agents. Kre1p/Mnt1p is a retaining glycosyltransferase; i.e. the anomeric configuration is the same on the donor nucleotide sugar and the product (Fig. 1) but to-date there is no information about its structure or that of any other member of this GT-15 family. By analogy with retaining glycosidases, it has been postulated that the mechanism of action of retaining glycosyltransferases involves a double displacement with the transient formation of a covalent glycosyl enzyme intermediate (12Davies G.J.

However, attempts to characterize such an intermediate for any retaining glycosyltransferase have so far been unsuccessful (15Ly H.D. Lougheed B. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Bio-chemistry. 2002; 41: 5075-5085Google Scholar) and their exact catalytic mechanisms are still unknown even though the structures of several of these enzymes have recently been solved (16Gastinel L.N.

These residues belong to the so-called “DXD” motif, in which X represents any amino acid (22Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The sequence in the motif is not strictly conserved and variations of the DXD motif are observed in some glycosyltransferases (for reviews see Refs. 25Unligil U.M. Rini J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar and 26Charnock S.J. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The current work presents the structures of apo-Kre2p/Mnt1p and its binary and ternary complexes with GDP/Mn2+, and GDP/Mn2+/methyl-α-mannoside. This is the first family 15 glycosyltransferase involved in fungal cell wall mannoprotein synthesis and the first mannosyltransferase structure determined. The structures together with modeling and mutagenesis studies reveal a novel interaction of the metal ion with the DXD motif and suggest a tyrosine-dependent mannosyl transfer reaction. Unlike other glycosyltransferase enzymes the active site appears to be preformed suggesting that this new structure will be important for the design of potential antifungal agents. The P. pastoris expression kit was obtained from Invitrogen; the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA); GDP-[6-3H]mannose (40 Ci/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO); GDP-mannose and methyl-α-mannoside were from Sigma Chemical Co; Macro-Prep ceramic hydroxyapatite type I 20 μm and AG 1-X8 resin were from Bio-Rad (Misssissauga, Ontario, Canada); oligonucleotides were synthesized by Biocorp Inc. (Montréal, Québec, Canada). All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Plasmid 1—To subclone the soluble domain of Kre2p/Mnt1p into the pPICZαA vector a KpnI restriction site was inserted before amino acid 97 of Kre2p/Mnt1p by oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis (27Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods in Enzymology. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). A 1.9-kb SstI-XbaI DNA fragment containing the Kre2p/Mnt1p open reading frame was subcloned in pBluescript KS+II and transformed into strain CJ236 from which single-stranded DNA was produced. The KpnI site was inserted after mutagenesis with oligonucleotide 5′-AAGCTGCCGCTGAAAAGGGTACCGCAGATGCCCCGATCG. Clones containing the KpnI site were verified by DNA sequencing of the region around the mutation. Positive clones were digested with KpnI and XbaI, and ligated into the KpnI/XbaI sites of the pPICZαA vector. The resulting recombinant Kre2p/Mnt1p protein contains 13 amino acids derived from the vector. Plasmid 2—To reduce the number of additional amino acids derived from the vector, the soluble domain of Kre2p/Mnt1p (starting at amino acid 97) was subcloned into the EcoI/Xba sites of pPICZαA. The following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-CTGAAAGCTGCCGCTGAA TTCGCAGATGCCCCGATC to create an EcoRI site and 5′-GAACCTTTTACTGAAGAATTTAAGGAAGCAGTCACC to remove the EcoRI site present in the coding sequence of Kre2p/Mnt1p. The encoded recombinant protein contains two extra amino acids derived from the vector. Plasmid 3—To obtain the T199A mutation that removes the glycosylation site, the oligonucleotides from plasmid 2 were used together with the oligonucleotide 5′-CCTGAATGGATTAATCAAGCCAAGGCCGCTGAAATTCGTGC. The specific activity of the recombinant proteins produced by the three plasmids was the same. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using either the U.S.E. mutagenesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) with plasmid pUR97 (obtained by digesting plasmid 1 with KpnI and XbaI, and ligating the insert into the KpnI-XbaI sites of pUC19) or the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with plasmids 1-3. The primers used included a silent mutation to screen for positive clones. The complete open reading frames of all the mutants were sequenced to establish that only the desired mutation was present. The mutants E247D, E279Q, E279D, D361N, and D361E were engineered in plasmid 1, while Y220F was produced in plasmid 2, and E247Q was produced in plasmid 3. The pPICZαA vectors of the wild-type and mutant proteins constructed as described above were transfected into P. pastoris (strain KM71 his4, aox1) for protein expression. The auxotrophic transformant was cultured in a medium buffered with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing methanol as the inducer, and the protease inhibitors, pepstatin and leupeptin. The medium was collected after 2 days of induction at 30 °C, and the recombinant α1,2-mannosyltransferase, residues 97-442, was purified from the medium by chromatography on Macro-Prep ceramic hydroxyapatite and Q-Sepharose. Fractions containing the protein were dialyzed against 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and concentrated using centrifugal ultrafilters (Millipore), and stored at -80 °C until required. Fresh columns were used for purification of each mutant to prevent contamination. Mannosyltransferase activity was assayed at 30 °C as described previously (8Romero P.A. Lussier M. Sdicu A.M. Bussey H. Herscovics A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All reactions were done in duplicate. To determine the apparent Km for methyl-α-mannoside the concentration of methyl-α-mannoside was varied from 5 to 200 mm for all mutants except for Y220F where it was varied from 25 to 500 mm. The concentration of GDP-[3H]mannose was kept constant at 50 μm (0.0135 μCi). To determine the apparent Km for GDP-[3H]mannose, incubations were performed with a constant amount of GDP-[3H]mannose (10μm, 0.0135μCi) and variable amounts of unlabeled GDP-mannose (0-200 μm), at a methyl-α-mannoside concentration of 200 mm. Mutants E247Q, E279Q, D361N, D361E, and Y220F were assayed at a concentration of 20 μg/ml, while parent and E247D at 16 ng/ml, and E279D at 32 ng/ml for 15 min. Before determination of activity the concentrated proteins were diluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH7.5 containing 5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin and 1 μg each of pepstatin and leupeptin. Circular dichroism (CD) experiments were performed on an AVIV CD spectropolarimeter (model 62A DS). All scans were performed between 200 and 260 nm (0.1-cm path length) on protein solutions of 0.75 mg/ml (in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The samples were scanned five times and averaged. To examine the thermal stability of each protein, the loss of ellipticity at 222 nm was monitored, as the protein sample was heatdenatured. The temperature was increased from 25 to 101 °C in 2 °C increments with 1 min equilibration before each reading.

The crystals belong to space group P21 with unit cell dimensions a = 60.7 Å, b = 101.1 Å, c = 62.0 Å, β = 98.8°. Two monomers are present in the asymmetric unit (Vm = 2.28 Å3/Da). Isomorphous crystals of the protein complexed with donor and acceptor molecules were grown under the same conditions with the protein “premixed” with additives. For the binary complex the protein was premixed with 5 mm GDP-mannose and 5 mm MnCl2, and for the ternary complex with 5 mm GDP-mannose, 5 mm MnCl2, and 40 mm methyl-α-mannoside. The mercury derivative used to determine the diffraction phases was obtained by soaking an apocrystal for 4 weeks in an artificial mother liquor (AML: 30% (w/v) PEG 2000 MME, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 200 mm NaCl) containing 0.5 mm HgCl2. A three-wavelength multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) experiment on the Hg LIII edge using the Hg derivative crystal was conducted at beamline X8-C at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. The MAD data were collected to 2.3 Å resolution and processed using HKL2000 (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods in Enzymology. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Prior to data collection the crystals were soaked in AML with the addition of a cryoprotectant: 20% (v/v) glycerol for the apoprotein, and 10 mm α1,2-mannobiose for the binary complex, and flash-frozen in a 100 K N2 stream. No soaking was required to freeze the crystals of the ternary complex because of the cryoprotective properties of the methyl-α-mannoside. The data for the apoprotein, and the binary and ternary complexes were collected on our in-house facility (RU-H3R generator, Osmic optics, R-AXIS-IV++ detector) and processed using d*TREK (29Pflugrath J.W.

Automated substructure solution using anomalous difference Patterson methods, with the three-wavelength MAD data, located two Hg sites. Subsequent phase refinement and solvent flattening yielded a final figure-of-merit of 0.93. The resultant electron density maps allowed unambiguous chain tracing and the initial model was built with the program XFIT (31McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). The initial model of the apoprotein was refined against the 2.0 Å apodata (Table II). A total of 337 amino acid residues in monomer A and 335 amino acid residues in monomer B were built. Each monomer also contains one N-linked oligosaccharide, 2 glycerol molecules, and one Cl- ion. A total of 672 water molecules were built per asymmetric unit. The final model of the structure comprises residues 104-114 and 117-442 in monomer A, and residues 103-114 and 120-442 in monomer B. The residues 97-103 and 115-116 in monomer A, and residues 97-102 and 115-119 in monomer B could not be modeled because of the poor quality of the electron density in these regions. The models of the binary and ternary protein complexes were refined against their corresponding 2.0 Å data (Table II). In each case the complex structures contain the same amino acid residues as found in the apostructure with the exception of residues 117-118 of monomer A, which are only present in the apostructure. Additionally, one HEPES molecule was included in each monomer, and a total of 561 and 853 water molecules were built in the binary and ternary complexes, respectively. The GDP, Mn2+ ion and methyl-α-mannoside were clearly seen in the σA weighted 2Fo - Fc difference maps (Fig. 3c). The parameters for GDP and methyl-α-mannoside were taken from the HIC-UP data base (32Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). There are no residues in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, with 91.3% of the residues in the most favorable regions of the plot for all three structures (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Applied Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The refinement statistics for the structures are given in Table II. Modeling of the mannose moiety of the GDP-mannose donor substrate was performed in two ways. First, the 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-UDP-galactose donor analogue and Mn2+ ion from the LgtC structure (20Persson K. Ly H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) were superimposed onto the GDP moiety and Mn2+ ion found in the binary complex structure of Kre2p, such that the β-phosphates and the Mn2+ ions overlap (Fig.4a). The galactose moiety was subsequently replaced with mannose. The GDP moiety including phosphates was kept fixed while a series of rotations around the Pβ-O1β and O1β-C1″ bonds was performed with XFIT to accommodate the mannose in an active site pocket, present in both the binary and ternary complex structures. Second, the UDP-GlcNAc donor from the GnT I structure (34Unligil U.M. Zhou S. Yuwaraj S. Sarkar M. Schachter H. Rini J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5269-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) was superimposed and substituted as described above for the LtgC structure (Fig. 4b). However, to accommodate the donor mannose in the active site pocket, rotations around Pα-O3α and O3α-Pβ, were also necessary. The position of the Pβ phosphorus atom maintained the coordination of its oxygens to the Mn2+ ion. The geometry of both models was subsequently optimized in CNS (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

We used rat cerebellar granule neurons as a model cell system for investigating MPP+ toxicity. Results show that MPP+ treatment resulted in the generation of reactive oxygen species from inhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and inactivation of aconitase. This, in turn, stimulated transferrin receptor (TfR)-dependent iron signaling via activation of the iron-regulatory protein/iron-responsive element interaction. MPP+ caused a time-dependent depletion of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) that was mediated by H2O2 and transferrin iron. Depletion of BH4 decreased the active, dimeric form of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS). MPP+-mediated “uncoupling” of nNOS decreased .NO and increased superoxide formation. Pretreatment of cells with sepiapterin to promote BH4 biosynthesis or cell-permeable iron chelator and TfR antibody to prevent iron-catalyzed BH4 decomposition inhibited MPP+ cytotoxicity. Preincubation of cerebellar granule neurons with nNOS inhibitor exacerbated MPP+-induced iron uptake, BH4 depletion, proteasomal inactivation, and apoptosis. We conclude that MPP+-dependent aconitase inactivation, Tf-iron uptake, and oxidant generation result in the depletion of intracellular BH4, leading to the uncoupling of nNOS activity. This further exacerbates reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidative damage and apoptosis.

The exact molecular mechanisms leading to the pathophysiology of PD are not well understood. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+), a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, produces Parkinson-like symptoms in humans and laboratory animals, and has been used to investigate the mechanism of pathogenesis of PD (5Lagnston J.W.

MPP+ is taken up into dopaminergic neurons via the dopamine transporter and accumulates into mitochondria, where it inhibits complex I activity. Although the mechanism of MPP+-induced neurotoxicity is not fully understood, there is increasing evidence supporting the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (1Dawson T.M.

However, therapeutic intervention studies with nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors in MPTP-treated mice demonstrated the opposite result, i.e. the attenuation of .NO was more deleterious than protective (11Stewart V.C.

BH4 is a critical cofactor for NOS activity (18Tayeh M.A. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19654-19658Google Scholar, 19Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Wachter H. Kukovetz W.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 297-300Google Scholar). Evidence indicates that BH4, by acting as a “redox switch,” plays a critical role in increasing not only the rate of .NO generation by NOS, but also in controlling the formation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (20Hemmens B.

De novo biosynthesis of BH4 is catalyzed by guanosine 5′-triphosphate cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH I) (28Thony B. Auerbach G. Blau N. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 1-16Google Scholar, 29Nichol C.A. Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Google Scholar). Mammalian cells can also generate BH4 by another pathway wherein sepiapterin is converted to BH4 by sepiapterin reductase and dihydrofolate reductase (28Thony B. Auerbach G. Blau N. Biochem.

Intracellular BH4 levels are inhibited by 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP), an inhibitor of GTPCH I, and enhanced by sepiapterin treatment of cells. However, modulation of BH4 synthesis has yielded opposing results in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems (23Cho S. Volpe B.T. Bae Y. Hwang O. Choi H.J. Gal J. Park L.C.H. Chu K. Du J. Joh T.H.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 878-889Google Scholar), whereas increased intracellular BH4 from supplementation with sepiapterin enhanced endothelial function thereby inhibiting postischemic heart injury (24Tiefenbacher C.P.

Thus, the exact relationship between .NO, BH4, and cytotoxicity/cytoprotection still remains ambiguous and further mechanistic studies clarifying the role of BH4 in oxidative injury in cellular systems deserve additional consideration. Oxidant-induced iron signaling and the subsequent occurrence of free radical-mediated oxidative damage are becoming increasingly understood as playing highly significant roles in neurodegeneration (30Bishop G.M.

Neurology. 2003; 60: 1761-1766Google Scholar). Iron has been shown to be abundantly present in the substantia nigra, whose levels have been reported to be consistently enhanced in the PD brain (4Bonn D. Lancet. 1996; 3471614Google Scholar). A major pathway by which neuronal cells acquire iron is via the transferrin receptor (TfR), which facilitates the uptake of iron-loaded transferrin (35Qian Z.M. Pu Y.M. Tang P.L. Wang Q. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 251: 9-12Google Scholar). In a previous study, we showed that MPP+ up-regulates TfR expression and iron uptake, leading to oxidative stress and apoptosis in neuronal cells (36Kalivendi S.V. Kotamraju S. Cunningham S. Shang T. Hillard C.J. Kalyanaraman B. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 151-164Google Scholar). Recently, we and others reported that .NO is critical to regulating oxidant-induced intracellular iron uptake (37Kotamraju S. Tampo Y. Keszler A. Chitambar C.R. Joseph J. Haas A.L. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10653-10658Google Scholar, 38Ryu S.Y. Jeong K.S. Kang B.N. Park S.J. Yoon W.K. Kim S.H. Kim T.H. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 3331-3338Google Scholar, 39Mulero V. Brock J.H. Blood. 1999; 94: 2383-2389Google Scholar). In this study, we seek to understand better the interaction between .NO, BH4, iron, and neuronal apoptosis in response to MPP+ treatment. For these studies, we used cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) for the following reasons: (i) CGNs express an organic cation transporter 3 that makes them vulnerable to MPP+ toxicity, much like neurons expressing the dopamine transporter (40Shang T. Uihlein A.V. Van Asten J. Kalyanaraman B. Hillard C.J. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 358-367Google Scholar); (ii) CGNs express a high level of nNOS that makes it possible to test the “uncoupling” mechanism of nNOS influenced by BH4 modulation; and (iii) MPP+ induces an iron-dependent apoptosis in CGNs (36Kalivendi S.V. Kotamraju S. Cunningham S. Shang T. Hillard C.J. Kalyanaraman B. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 151-164Google Scholar). Results indicate that MPP+-induced BH4 depletion is dependent on TfR-iron signaling and is caused by MPP+-dependent TfR up-regulation, which ultimately results in nNOS uncoupling (i.e. switching from .NO to superoxide generation). Increasing the intracellular BH4 levels by sepiapterin supplementation partially restored mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity, restored the nNOS activity (.NO generation), inhibited superoxide formation from the uncoupling mechanism, and prevented TfR-dependent iron accumulation and apoptotic cell death. Implications for the role of nNOS in iron signaling in PD are discussed.

Monoclonal antibody 42/6 against human TfR was a gift from Dr. Ian Trowbridge (Salk Institute, San Diego, CA). 55Fe (ferric chloride) (1 mCi/100 μl) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Rat GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH I) and rat transferrin receptor-specific cDNA primers (shown below) were synthesized by Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). Other salts and buffers were obtained from the usual commercial sources. CGN Primary Culture—CGNs were prepared from 6-8-day-old rat pups of either sex exactly as described previously (41Hillard C.J. Edgemond W.S. Jarrahian A. Campbell W.B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 631-638Google Scholar). Cells were plated at density of 1.4 × 106 cells/ml in 12- or 6-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine. For the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, CGNs were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. After 24 h, cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) was added to the cultures to inhibit glial proliferation. Approximately 5% of the cells present in the cultures are astroglia; a few phase-bright microglia can be seen in each high power field, and the remaining cells are CGNs. CGNs were used for experiments on day 10. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—For RT-PCR of GTPCH I, poly(A)+ mRNA was prepared from either cells or tissues using QuickPrep micro mRNA purification kit and cDNA was synthesized using the You-Prime-First-Strand Beads using oligo(dT) as a primer. The sense and antisense primers for rat GTPCH I were 5′-GGA TAC CAG GAG ACC ATC TCA-3′ and 5′-TAG CAT GGT GCT AGT GAC AGT-3′, respectively. These primers correspond to the nucleotide positions 422-442 and 773-793, respectively, and size of the expected product was 372 bp. An annealing temperature of 55 °C was used, and the cycle was repeated 30 times. For semiquantitative RT-PCR of TfR, total RNA from CGNs was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Two micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) employing random hexamers. For RT-PCR, the number of cycles and the amount of cDNA are optimized to fall into the exponential phase of the polymerase chain reaction. The sense and antisense primers for rat transferrin receptor were 5′-AGT TTC CGC CAT CTC AGT C-3′ and 5′-ACG TCC TGC ATT ATC TTC CC-3′, respectively. These primers correspond to the nucleotide positions 546-564 and 1106-1125, respectively, and size of the expected product was 580 bp. An annealing temperature of 55 °C was used, and the cycle was repeated 30 times. All primers were designed employing Genetics Computer Group, Inc. (GCG) software. The PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gel, and the bands were quantified by densitometry. MTT Reduction Cytotoxicity Assay—MTT is converted in living cells to formazan, which has a specific absorption maximum at 562 nm. Treatment agents were added directly to the culture media. After treatment, the culture media were removed and cells were washed three times with control salt solution (CSS) (120 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, and 15 mm glucose). Cells were incubated in CSS buffer containing 0.25 mg/ml MTT for 2 h at 37 °C. CSS buffer was removed, and cells were solubilized and mixed thoroughly in isopropanol, 0.08 n HCl (1:1). The absorption was measured at 562 nm with reference at 630 nm. Measurement of Caspase-3-like Protease Activity—Caspase-3-like protease activity was assayed according to the protocol from the manufacturer (Caspase 3 Assay Kit, Sigma) with the following modification. CGNs were cultured in 6-well plates and exposed to MPP+ on day 10. Pretreatment drugs were added in culture media 2 h before MPP+ treatment. After a 24-h incubation, CGNs were washed, scraped, and pelleted with cold PBS. The cell pellet was lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm CHAPS, and 5 mm DTT). Following homogenization and incubation on ice for 15-20 min, lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Aliquots of 40 μl of lysate were incubated with 50 μl of assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA) and 10 μl of caspase-3 substrate (Ac-DEVD-p-nitroaniline, 200 μm) at 37 °C for 2 h. Protein concentration was determined according to the Lowry method. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Staining—CGNs were cultured on chamber slips at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Beginning on day 10, the cells were exposed to MPP+ for 30 h. Pretreatment drugs were added in culture media 2 h before MPP+ treatment. DNA fragmentation of individual cells was detected in situ by TUNEL with ApoAlert DNA fragmentation assay kit (Clontech). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in formaldehyde solution (4% in PBS) for 25 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and permeabilized in a solution containing 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at 4 °C, followed by incubation in freshly prepared terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase incubation buffer for 60 min at 37 °C in the dark. Cells were washed with PBS, stained with propidium iodide, mounted in an anti-fade solution, and visualized under a Nikon microscope. Fluorescein-dUTP incorporated into the fragmented nucleotides exhibited green fluorescence at an emission wavelength of 528 nm. All cells stained with propidium iodide exhibited red fluorescence at an emission wavelength of 617 nm. Cells were identified as apoptotic if they showed positive TUNEL staining (yellow color on overlay images). Apoptosis was assessed by counting the number of TUNEL-positive cells in at least three randomly selected fields and expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells counted. Determination of TfR and nNOS Levels—CGNs were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 50 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium fluoride). To a 10-ml solution of the above, 1 mm sodium vanadate and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) were added. Cells were homogenized, and the lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. Protein was determined by the Lowry method, and 20 μg was used for the Western blot analysis. Proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Low temperature SDS-PAGE (LT-PAGE) was performed according to a published method (42Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Google Scholar). Basically, equal amounts of protein were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer at 4 °C. Gel (6%) and buffer were equilibrated at 4 °C prior to electrophoresis and the buffer tank placed in 4 °C refrigerator during electrophoresis to keep the temperature below 10 °C. Subsequent to LT-PAGE, protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk to block nonspecific protein binding. Membranes were incubated with mouse anti-human transferrin receptor monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc. 1 μg/ml) or mouse anti-rat neuronal nitric-oxide synthase monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories; 1 μg/ml) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1.5 h at room temperature. Following washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:5000) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The TfR and nNOS bands were detected using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Subsequently, blots were stripped and reprobed with an antibody against actin. Measurement of Aconitase Activity—Aconitase activity was measured according to the published method with some modifications (43Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Google Scholar). CGNs were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min to pellet the cells and homogenized using a 25-gauge syringe needle (10 strokes) with 100 μl of lysis buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 100 μm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, and 5 mm citrate in PBS). The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, aconitase activity was measured in the supernatant, and protein was estimated by the Lowry method. The activity of aconitase was measured in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0, 100 μl) containing 20 mmdl-trisodium isocitrate. The rate of change of absorbance was followed for 3 min at 240 nm in a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-1601PC; Shimadzu Corp.) at room temperature. An extinction coefficient for cis-aconitase of 3.6 mm-1 cm-1 at 240 nm was used to calculate the enzyme activity and the values were expressed as micromoles/min/mg of protein. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—IRP/IRE binding was measured by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. 32P-Labeled IRE mRNA for the RNA band shift assay was prepared using as a template a 1000-base pair rat L ferritin pseudogene that contains the conserved IRE sequence. The plasmid (p66-L gene) containing this insert (which was generously provided by Dr. Elizabeth Leibold) was linearized with SmaI (Invitrogen) and used for in vitro transcription of IRE mRNA. Transcription was carried out with Sp6 RNA polymerase using a Ribo-probe transcription system from Promega. Measurement of Oxidative Stress—The determination of intracellular oxidant production was based on the oxidation of carboxy-H2DCFDA, resulting in the formation of the fluorescent compound carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (carboxy-DCF). Following treatment of CGNs with MPP+, the medium was aspirated, and cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 1 ml of cell culture medium without fetal bovine serum. Carboxy-H2DCFDA was added to a final concentration of 10 μm and incubated for 20 min. Cells were washed with PBS and maintained in 1 ml of culture medium. Fluorescence was monitored using a Nikon fluorescence microscope with wavelengths of 480/30 nm (excitation) and 535/40 nm (emission). The fluorescence intensity values from three different fields of view were calculated using the Metamorph software. Hydroethidine (Dihydroethidium) Staining—The redox-sensitive, cell-permeable fluorophore hydroethidine (dihydroethidium, DHE) was used to evaluate the cellular production of superoxide in vivo. Following treatment of CGNs, culture medium was aspirated and cells were washed once with PBS and incubated in a fresh culture medium without fetal bovine serum. DHE (5 μm) was added to cells, and the incubation was continued for 20 min. Fluorescence images were obtained using a Nikon fluorescence microscope at excitation and emission wavelengths of 540/25 nm and 605/55 nm, respectively. The fluorescence intensity values from three different fields of view were calculated using the Metamorph software, and the average values presented. Determination of Tetrahydrobiopterin Levels in CGNs—Tetrahydrobiopterin levels in CGNs were assayed using HPLC with fluorescence detection according to the method reported previously (44Vasquez-Vivar J. Whitsett J. Martasek P. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Free"

https://openalex.org/W2140454248,"Activation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) by proinflammatory cytokines is a key feature of atherosclerotic lesion formation. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 is a pleiotropic growth factor that can modulate the inflammatory response in diverse cell types including VSMCs. However, the mechanisms by which TGF-β1 is able to mediate these effects remains incompletely understood. We demonstrate here that the ability of TGF-β1 to inhibit markers of VSMC activation, inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) and interleukin (IL)-6, is mediated through its downstream effector Smad3. In reporter gene transfection studies, we found that among a panel of Smads, Smad3 could inhibit iNOS induction in an analogous manner as exogenous TGF-β1. Adenoviral overexpression of Smad3 potently repressed inducible expression of endogenous iNOS and IL-6. Conversely, TGF-β1 inhibition of cytokine-mediated induction of iNOS and IL-6 expression was completely blocked in Smad3-deficient VSMCs. Previous studies demonstrate that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) and NF-κB sites are critical for cytokine induction of both the iNOS and IL-6 promoters. We demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of Smad3 occurs via a novel antagonistic effect of Smad3 on C/EBP DNA-protein binding and activity. Smad3 mediates this effect in part by inhibiting C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ through distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, we find that Smad3 prevents the cooperative induction of the iNOS promoter by C/EBP and NF-κB. These data demonstrate that Smad3 plays an essential role in mediating TGF-β1 anti-inflammatory response in VSMCs.

Accumulating evidence suggests that atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease state. The lesions of atherosclerosis represent a series of complex interactions between immune (macrophage/T lymphocytes) and non-immune (endothelial cells/VSMCs) 1The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; (C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; IL, interleukin; RASMC, rat aortic smooth muscle cell; MASMC, mouse aortic smooth muscle cell; TGF, transforming growth factor; wt, wild type; ko, knock-out. cells (1Libby P. Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (7017) Google Scholar). Although the initial phase of atherogenesis involve endothelial activation and immune cell recruitment, the evolution of this lesion is critically modulated by VSMCs. Through effects on VSMC migration, proliferation, and elaboration of cytokines and extracellular matrix proteins, proinflammatory stimuli can alter atherosclerotic lesion characteristics and attendant complications (1Libby P. Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (7017) Google Scholar, 2Schwartz R.S. Henry T.D. Rev. Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 3: 4-9PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of mechanisms that limit the VSMC response to proinflammatory stimuli is, thus, of considerable interest. CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) constitute a family of transcription factors that can promote the inflammatory response in VSMCs. C/EBPs contain an activation domain, a DNA binding basic region, and dimerization domain and may bind to DNA as either homodimers or heterodimers (3Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 4Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Among the C/EBPs expressed in VSMCs, only C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ are induced in response to inflammatory stimuli such as IL-1β (5Fukuoka T. Kitami Y. Okura T. Hiwada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25576-255826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ can directly regulate pro-inflammatory gene expression at the level of transcription alone or through the cooperativity with NF-κB in several cell types including VSMCs (3Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 6Sakitani K. Nishizawa M. Inoue K. Masu Y. Okumura T. Ito S.

Cell Physiol. 2002; 282 (9): 144-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, both NF-κB and C/EBP sites are required for IL-1β-mediated induction of the iNOS and IL-6 promoters in rat aortic smooth muscle cells RASMCs (7Maret A. Clamens S. Delrieu I. Elhage R. Arnal J.F. Bayard F. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2876-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Teng X. Zhang H. Snead C. Catravas J.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282 (9): 144-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBPs can also contribute to the inflammatory response under different pathophysiologic conditions. For instance, C/EBP-β can mediate hypoxia-induced iNOS expression in rat pulmonary smooth muscle cells (8Teng X. Zhang H. Snead C. Catravas J.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282 (9): 144-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of C/EBP DNA binding through the use of decoy oligonucleotides decreases vascular lesion formation in a rabbit model of restenosis (9Kelkenberg U. Wagner A.H. Sarhaddar J. Hecker M. von der Leyen H.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, identification of mechanisms or signaling pathways to inhibit C/EBP-β or C/EBP-δ expression may offer novel strategies to diminish the inflammatory response in VSMCs for diverse vascular occlusive disease states. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 is a pleiotropic growth factor involved in cell growth, differentiation, and immune modulation (10Mehra A. Wrana J.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 80: 605-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 11Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The composite anti-proliferative and antiinflammatory effects of TGF-β1 on both the immune and nonimmune cellular constituents of the atherosclerotic lesion suggest an inhibitory role in atherogenesis. Indeed, blockade of TGF-β1 ligand or the TGF-β type II receptor accelerates the development of atherosclerotic lesion formation in apoE-/- atherosclerotic-prone mice (12Mallat Z. Gojova A. Marchiol-Fournigault C. Esposito B. Kamate C. Merval R. Fradelizi D. Tedgui A. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 930-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 13Lutgens E. Gijbels M. Smook M. Heeringa P. Gotwals P. Koteliansky V. Daemen M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In patients, the serum concentration of active TGF-β1 is inversely correlated with the severity of atherosclerotic disease (14Grainger D.J. Kemp P.R. Metcalfe J.C. Liu A.C. Lawn R.M. Williams N.R. Grace A.A. Schofield P.M. Chauhan A. Nature Med. 1995; 1: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which TGF-β1 is able to mediate these effects on VSMCs remains poorly understood. Recently, a class of proteins termed Smads have been identified as the downstream effectors of TGF-β1 signaling (10Mehra A. Wrana J.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 80: 605-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 11Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that members of the Smad family may be involved in mediating TGF-β1 inhibition of VSMC activation in response to proinflammatory stimuli. In this report we demonstrate by both gain- and loss-of-function experiments that Smad3 is essential in inhibiting markers of VSMC activation, iNOS and IL-6, after stimulation with IL-1β. Furthermore, our studies suggest that the Smad3 inhibition occurs through distinct effects on C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ. Cell Culture and Reagents—RASMCs were harvested from the thoracic aortas of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g; Zivic-Miller Co., Zelienople, Pa) by enzymatic digestion according to the method of Gunther et al.

Smad3 mice were provided by X-F Wang (Duke University) (19Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Pan L. Borton A.J. Zhuang Y. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2495-2504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Animal care and procedures were approved by the Harvard Medical School Standing Committee on Animals and were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH). We obtained IL-1β and active recombinant TGF-β1 from R&D Systems. RNA Extraction and RNA Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells by guanidine isothiocyanate extraction and centrifugation through cesium chloride. RNA was fractionated on a 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were hybridized with 32P-labeled, random-primed cDNA probes, washed, and exposed as described previously (20Feinberg M.W. Jain M.K. Werner F. Sibinga N.E. Wiesel P. Wang H. Topper J.N.

A cDNA probe for IL-6 was generated from RAW264.7 cDNA using standard polymerase chain reaction methods with the following primers: upper, 5′-GTTGCCTTCTTGGGACTGAT-3′, and lower, 5′-ATGAGTTGGATGGTCTTGGT-3′. cDNA probes for C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ were obtained as gifts from S. McKnight (Dallas, TX). Transient Transfections and Adenoviral Infection—RASMCs were transfected with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described (20Feinberg M.W. Jain M.K.

The total amount of plasmid DNA was kept constant within each experiment using pcDNA3. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity by cotransfecting the pCMV-β-gal plasmid in all experiments. All transfections were performed in triplicate from at least three independent experiments. The expression plasmids for Smad1, -2, -3, -4, and -7 have been described previously (20Feinberg M.W.

The mouse -1.5-kb iNOS promoter construct was obtained from C. Glass (San Diego, CA) (21Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3271) Google Scholar), and the mouse -250-bp IL-6 promoter construct was obtained from R. Schwartz (Ann Arbor, MI). For adenoviral infection of RASMCs, replication-deficient human adenovirus vectors expressing mouse Smad3 or LacZ (encoding for β-galactosidase) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (Ad-Smad3 or Ad-β-gal) were used (a gift from K. Miyazono, Tokyo). Cells seeded at 2 × 106/10-cm2 dish were infected with the adenoviral vectors at 100 multiplicity of infection and incubated for 16 h before treatment with IL-1β or TGF-β1 as indicated.

TGF-β1 Can Inhibit Cytokine-induced Expression of iNOS and IL-6 in VSMCs—Stimuli such as IL-1β can activate iNOS and IL-6 expression by stimulating members of the C/EBP and NF-κB family (8Teng X.

To examine whether TGF-β1 can inhibit inducible expression of iNOS and IL-6 mRNA in VSMCs, RASMCs were stimulated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of pretreatment with active TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 30 min. As demonstrated in Fig. 1A, iNOS and IL-6 mRNA are expressed at low levels in unstimulated cells and induced markedly by IL-1β. However, pretreatment with TGF-β1 potently attenuated this induction (Fig. 1A). Previous work has demonstrated that IL-1β induction of both iNOS and IL-6 occurs primarily at the level of transcription (8Teng X. Zhang H. Snead C. Catravas J.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282 (9): 144-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Eberhardt W. Pluss C. Hummel R. Pfeilschifter J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4961-4969PubMed Google Scholar, 24Matsusaka T.

Consistent with these results, transient transfection assays using iNOS and IL-6 promoter constructs showed an increase in transcriptional activity induced by IL-1β; however, pretreatment with TGF-β1 for 30 min markedly attenuated this response in RASMCs (Fig. 1B). Cellular signaling from the TGF-β superfamily occurs through the intracellular signaling mediators, termed Smads, which translocate to the nucleus, where they direct transcriptional responses. Three classes of Smads, pathway-restricted, common, and inhibitory, are responsible for coordinating the downstream signaling effects (26Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) (11Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Piek E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). TGF-β/activin receptors phosphorylate the pathway-restricted Smads, Smad2 and Smad3, whereas bone morphogenic protein receptors activate Smads 1, 5, and 8. Upon phosphorylation, these pathway-restricted Smads may hetero-oligomerize with Smad4, the only common Smad, and translocate to the nucleus where they may participate in regulating transcriptional events. Smad6 and Smad7, known as inhibitory Smads, are structurally divergent from other Smads and function to block TGF-β signaling by preventing activation of pathway-restricted Smads (26Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). To assess whether TGF-β1 inhibition was Smad-dependent in VSMCs, we first performed cotransfection assays on the iNOS promoter construct with several Smad expression constructs followed by stimulation with IL-1β. As shown in Fig. 1C, of the pathway restricted Smads, only Smad3 was able to repress the iNOS promoter in a manner similar to TGF-β1, an effect enhanced by treatment with exogenous TGF-β1. In contrast, the addition of TGF-β1 to Smad2 had no further inhibitory effect in comparison to TGF-β1 alone. The common Smad, Smad4, could also inhibit the induction of the iNOS promoter, albeit much weaker than Smad3 alone. Taken together, these data indicate that in response to TGF-β, Smad3 may mediate the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 in VSMCs. Smad3 Is Requisite for Mediating TGF-β1 Inhibition on IL-1β-induced Expression of iNOS and IL-6 in VSMCs—To assess whether constitutive overexpression of Smad3 can inhibit inducible expression of endogenous iNOS and IL-6 in VSMCs, we adenovirally overexpressed Ad-Smad3 or Ad-cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase and treated the cells in the presence of Ctrl (water) or IL-1β (10 ng/ml). As shown in Fig. 2A, IL-1β induced iNOS and IL-6 mRNA; however, this induction is markedly attenuated upon adenoviral overexpression of Smad3. To assess whether Smad3 is requisite in mediating the TGF-β1 inhibitory effect on iNOS and IL-6 in VSMCs, we isolated MASMCs from the aortas of Smad3-wt or Smad3-deficient (ko) mice. By Western analysis, we verified the absence of Smad3 protein in Smad3-ko MASMCs (Fig. 2B). Total RNA was harvested from Smad3-wt or Smad3-ko MASMCs 24 h after stimulation with Ctrl (water), IL-1β, IL-1β plus TGF-β1, or TGF-β1 alone. As shown in Fig. 2C, TGF-β1 inhibited the IL-1β-mediated induction of iNOS and IL-6 in Smad3-wt MASMCs; however, TGF-β1 inhibition is dramatically blocked in Smad3-ko MASMCs. These data suggest a critical role for Smad3 in mediating TGF-β1 inhibition of these pro-inflammatory markers in VSMCs. Smad3 Inhibits Cytokine-induced C/EBP DNA-Protein Binding and Prevents C/EBP and NF-κB Cooperativity in VSMCs—As a first step to investigate the mechanism by which Smad3 mediates the inhibitory effect on iNOS expression we examined the iNOS promoter. Previous studies demonstrate that in VSMCs induction of iNOS is dependent upon both the proximal NF-κB and C/EBP sites (8Teng X. Zhang H. Snead C. Catravas J.D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282 (9): 144-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hecker M. Preiss C. Schini-Kerth V.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To assess whether TGF-β1 or Smad3 can affect either NF-κB or C/EBP DNA-protein binding we performed gel shift studies using nuclear extracts from RASMCs. Consistent with previous reports, treatment with TGF-β1 (29Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.F. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or adenoviral overexpression of Smad3 (Adv-Smad3) had no affect on IL-1β-induced NF-κB DNA binding (data not shown). In contrast, in response to TGF-β1, Adv-Smad3 markedly reduced C/EBP DNA-protein binding (Fig. 3A). Specificity of the induced C/EBP complex was verified by competition studies with unlabeled wild-type or mutant oligonucleotides (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, supershift studies verified the presence of C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ within this induced complex (Fig. 3C). The NF-κB transcription factor complex is composed of variable subunits p50, p52, p65(RelA), c-Rel, and RelB (30Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). Previous studies support a direct cooperation between NF-κB p50 and members of the C/EBP family (6Sakitani K. Nishizawa M. Inoue K. Masu Y. Okumura T. Ito S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Xia C. Cheshire J.K. Patel H. Woo P. Int. J. Biochem.

Blood. 2003; 101: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To examine whether Smad3 can block the cooperative induction by NF-κB and C/EBP on the iNOS promoter, we performed co-transfection studies in the presence of C/EBP-β, C/EBP-δ, or p50. In response to a constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor, Smad3 can inhibit the induction of iNOS by C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ alone or in combination with NF-κB p50 (Fig. 3D). Consistent with the modest inhibitory effect by the common Smad, Smad4 (Fig. 1C), the addition of Smad4 to Smad3 enhanced the inhibition of C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ or their cooperativity with NF-κB p50 on the iNOS promoter (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data indicate that Smad3 alone or in combination with Smad4 can prevent the induction of C/EBP DNA binding or the cooperative activation of iNOS by C/EBP and NF-κB. TGF-β1/Smad3 Inhibits C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ through Distinct Mechanisms—In theory, inhibition of C/EBP DNA binding could be the result of a decrease in the levels of C/EBP expression, a direct interaction of Smad3 with C/EBP-β or C/EBP-δ or both. To assess whether TGF-β1 alters C/EBP-β or C/EBP-δ expression, we treated MASMCs with either vehicle (control), IL-1β, IL-1β plus TGFβ1, or TGF-β1 alone. As shown in Fig. 4A, TGF-β1 had minimal effect on IL-1β-induced C/EBP-β expression, whereas induction of C/EBP-δ was markedly inhibited. Although IL-1β induction of C/EBP-β expression is minimally affected by TGF-β1, C/EBP DNA binding is strongly inhibited, raising the possibility that in response to TGF-β1, Smad3 may also directly interact with C/EBP-β to prevent its DNA binding. To address this, we performed coimmunoprecipitation studies in 293T cells with pCDNA3 (control), Smad3-FLAG, C/EBP-β, or C/EBP-δ in the presence or absence of a constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor (TGRI). As demonstrated in Fig. 4, an α-FLAG antibody immunoprecipitated C/EBP-β, but not C/EBP-δ, from lysates transfected with the FLAG-Smad3 construct. These data suggest that TGF-β1 via Smad3 can inhibit C/EBP DNA binding through at least two mechanisms, 1) a decrease in expression of C/EBP-δ and 2) a direct interaction with C/EBP-β. Inflammation is a critical hallmark in the development of a variety of vascular occlusive disease states (1Libby P. Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (7017) Google Scholar). VSMCs are an important source of inflammatory mediators that may participate directly in atherogenesis or prognosticate future cardiovascular events (1Libby P. Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (7017) Google Scholar, 32Blake G.J. Ridker P.M. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2003; 41: 37-42Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, identification of mechanisms to limit the inflammatory response may offer novel therapeutic targets. One of the established functions of TGF-β1 is its ability to inhibit activation in both immune and non-immune cells. Studies in our laboratory and others demonstrate that TGF-β1 is able to inhibit various aspects of macrophage function that are thought to play a role in atherogenesis and transplant-associated arteriopathy (20Feinberg M.W. Jain M.K. Werner F. Sibinga N.E. Wiesel P. Wang H. Topper J.N. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol.

Because TGF-β1 can have cell type-specific effects, we sought to examine the mechanism by which TGF-β1 mediates its inhibitory effect in VSMCs. In this report we provide evidence that Smad3 is a critical effector in TGF-β1-mediated inhibition of VSMC activation. In support, we found that Smad3 could inhibit the expression of markers of VSMC activation (Fig. 1). The addition of exogenous TGF-β1 enhanced the Smad3-mediated inhibition. Furthermore, although constitutive overexpression of Smad3 inhibited the inducible expression of endogenous iNOS and IL-6 in VSMCs, Smad3-deficient VSMCs completely abolished the TGF-β1-mediated inhibition (Fig. 2). The more potent inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 achieved on cytokine-induced iNOS and IL-6 mRNA in Fig. 1A in comparison to Fig. 2C may reflect cell-type differences (RASMCs versus MASMCs) or the participation of other Smads. For example, although our reporter gene transfection experiments demonstrate that Smad2 had no inhibitory effect alone or in the presence of TGF-β1, we cannot rule out the possibility that Smad2 or non-Smad pathways may participate in TGF-β1-mediated inhibition in vivo. Recently, the role of iNOS in the context of atherosclerosis has been examined. These studies revealed a significant decrease in lesion area in atherosclerotic-prone apoE-/- mice that were also iNOS-deficient (35Detmers P.A. Hernandez M. Mudgett J. Hassing H. Burton C. Mundt S. Chun S. Fletcher D. Card D.J. Lisnock J. Weikel R. Bergstrom J.D. Shevell D.E. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Sparrow C.P. Chao Y.S. Rader D.J. Wright S.D. Pure E. J.

Circulation. 2001; 103: 3099-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Atheroma from these ApoE/iNOS double knockout mice also showed decreased peroxynitrite formation and activity, suggesting a role for iNOS in lipid peroxidation (36Kuhlencordt P.J. Chen J. Han F. Astern J. Huang P.L. Circulation. 2001; 103: 3099-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 37Chen J. Kuhlencordt P. Urano F. Ichinose H. Astern J. Huang P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Finally, iNOS-deficient mice fed a high atherogenic diet have lesions composed of more collagen (38Niu X.L. Yang X. Hoshiai K. Tanaka K. Sawamura S. Koga Y. Nakazawa H. Circulation. 2001; 103: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As such, the inhibition of iNOS by Smad3 may be important in atherogenesis. To our knowledge this is the first report examining the effect of TGF-β1 on cytokine-induction of IL-6 in VSMCs. Similar findings were recently described in glial cells (39Basu A. Krady J.K. Enterline J.R. Levison S.W. Glia. 2002; 40: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Upon activation, VSMCs are a rich source of this pleiotropic cytokine (40Loppnow H. Libby P. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 85: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). IL-6 can mediate a variety of biological responses including the induction of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1), cytokines, and acute-phase proteins such as C-reactive protein (41Ikeda U. Ikeda M. Seino Y. Takahashi M. Kasahara T. Kano S. Shimada K. Atherosclerosis. 1993; 104: 61-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 42Le J.M. Vilcek J. Lab. Investig. 1989; 61: 588-602PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 also promotes the proliferation of VSMCs in vitro (43Ikeda U. Ikeda M. Oohara T. Oguchi A. Kamitani T. Tsuruya Y. Kano S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H1713-1717PubMed Google Scholar, 44Roth M. Nauck M. Tamm M. Perruchoud A.P. Ziesche R. Block L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate that elevated levels of IL-6 in peripheral or coronary circulation can predict adverse coronary events (45Berk B.C. Weintraub W.S. Alexander R.W. Am. J. Cardiol. 1990; 65: 168-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 46Biasucci L.M. Vitelli A. Liezzo G. Altamura S. Caligiuri G. Monaco C. Rebuzzi A.G. Cilbiberto G. Maseri A.

Our data suggest that in response to TGF-β1, cytokine-mediated induction of IL-6 expression and transcriptional activation is markedly decreased (Fig. 1). Furthermore, our gain- and loss-of-function studies indicate that Smad3 is requisite for this inhibition in VSMCs. Thus, by blocking IL-6 expression, Smad3 may be an important effector in limiting the untoward effects mediated by IL-6 in the development of inflammatory vascular disease states. Previous studies indicate an important role of adjacent NF-κB and C/EBP sites in the proximal promoters of iNOS, IL-6, and several acute-phase response proteins (e.g. C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A) for mediating cytokine induction of gene expression (3Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 6Sakitani K. Nishizawa M. Inoue K. Masu Y. Okumura T. Ito S.

Cell Physiol. 2002; 282 (9): 144-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although TGF-β1 or Smad3 had no direct effect on NF-κB DNA binding, Smad3 potently inhibited C/EBP DNA-protein binding (Fig. 3). Consistent with these findings, in response to TGF-β, Smad3 prevented the induction by C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ or their cooperative induction with NF-κB p50 on the iNOS promoter (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, although TGF-β1 can inhibit IL-1β-induced expression of C/EBP-δ, there is minimal effect on C/EBP-β. Thus, the decrease in C/EBP DNA binding may be the result of decreased expression of C/EBP-δ. However, we observed near complete inhibition of C/EBP binding (Fig. 3), raising the possibility that Smad3 may interact with C/EBP-β since, in theory, C/EBP-β homodimers could still bind to DNA. Consistent with this hypothesis, our co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated a direct association of Smad3 only with C/EBP-β, but not C/EBP-δ. Therefore, our observations suggest distinct inhibitory effects of Smad3 on C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ, the net effect of which is an inhibition of C/EBP DNA binding and, consequently, a loss of NF-κB and C/EBP cooperativity. Recent studies support an inhibitory relationship with Smad3 and C/EBP-β in different cell types. For example, Zauberman et al. (49Zauberman A. Lapter S. Zipori D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24719-24725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) show that Smad3 blocked C/EBP-β transactivation of the haptoglobin promoter in HepG2 cells, an effect enhanced in the presence of Smad4. Likewise, Coyle-Rink et al. (50Coyle-Rink J. Sweet T. Abraham S. Sawaya B. Batuman O. Khalili K. Amini S. Virology. 2002; 299: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) demonstrate that Smad3 prevented C/EBP-β induction of the HIV-LTR promoter in astrocytes, an effect also enhanced with Smad4. We similarly observed enhanced inhibition with Smad3 and Smad4 on the iNOS promoter in RASMCs (Fig. 3D). Although our observations in Smad3-deficient MASMCs indicate that Smad4 is dispensable for mediating the TGF-β1 inhibition (Fig. 2), Smad4 can hetero-oligomerize with Smad3 to facilitate its translocation into the nucleus. Thus, in response to TGF-β, Smad4 may be able to potentiate Smad3 inhibitory effect. A recent study that examined the role of Smad3 in adipocyte differentiation, a C/EBP-β- and C/EBP-δ-regulated process, also demonstrated an inhibitory effect on these C/EBPs during 3T3-L1 differentiation (34Choy L. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9609-9619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Smad3 had no effect on C/EBP DNA binding, but it did affect the transcriptional activity of C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ (34Choy L. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9609-9619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between the effects of Smad3 on C/EBP DNA binding observed in this study and ours is unclear but may be secondary to cell type-specific effects mediated by TGF-β1 in 3T3-L1 cells versus RASMCs or the absence of cytokines for C/EBP induction in the 3T3-L1 system. Taken together, our observations using both gain- and loss-of-function strategies indicate that Smad3 plays a critical role in modulating VSMC activation by TGF-β1. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the Smad3 inhibition occurs in part through disrupting C/EBP DNA binding by distinct inhibitory effects on C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ. In addition, Smad3 prevents the cooperative induction by C/EBP and NF-κB on markers of VSMC activation. Because C/EBPs are essential for the inducibility and transcriptional activation of several other pro-inflammatory and acute-phase proteins, these findings may have broad implications on the understanding of the mechanism by which TGF-β1 limits the inflammatory response in VSMCs."

Unexpectedly, Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice ate less food, gained less weight, and had lower adiposity than Lepob/ob/HSL+/+ mice. Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice had massive accumulation of preadipocytes in white adipose tissues with increased expression of preadipocyte-specific genes (CAAT/enhancer-binding protein β and adipose differentiation-related protein) and decreased expression of genes characteristic of mature adipocytes (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, peroxisome proliferator activator receptor γ, and adipocyte determination and differentiation factor 1/sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1). Consistent with the reduced food intake, hypothalamic expression of neuropeptide Y and agouti-related peptide was decreased.

Excessive cellular accumulation of neutral lipids underlies many diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis, all of which are epidemic in industrialized countries. Therefore, elucidating the metabolic pathways that degrade excessive neutral lipids is of extreme importance in the prevention of the diseases caused by lipotoxicity (1Unger R.H. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) 1The abbreviations used are: HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; TG, triglycerol(s); DG, diglycerol(s); FFA, free fatty acid(s); WAT, white adipose tissue; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone. 1The abbreviations used are: HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; TG, triglycerol(s); DG, diglycerol(s); FFA, free fatty acid(s); WAT, white adipose tissue; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone. is an intracellular neutral lipase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of cellular triglycerols (TG), diglycerols (DG), monoacylglycerols, and cholesteryl esters as well as other lipids (2Holm C.

HSL is expressed in a wide variety of organs and cells, including adipose tissues, heart, skeletal muscle, adrenal glands, testes, ovaries, and pancreatic β-cells, and is under neural and hormonal control. Several laboratories including ours have generated HSL-deficient (HSL-/-) mice by targeted gene disruption (4Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N.

Unexpectedly, these mice showed male sterility due to the failure of spermatogenesis (4Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O.

Although HSL-/- mice had a decreased ability to release free fatty acids (FFA) from adipocytes in response to the β-adrenergic stimulation both in vivo and in vitro, they were neither obese nor cold-sensitive (4Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The attenuated development of adipocyte-associated phenotypes may result from the presence of a residual TG lipase activity in adipocytes, which is induced by both β-adrenergic agonist and tumor necrosis factor-α (8Okazaki H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Yahagi N. Tomita S. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Kimura S. Gotoda T. Shimano H. Yamada N. Ishibashi S.

However, it is unknown how HSL deficiency affects adiposity in the setting of obesity, which is commonly associated with type 2 diabetes. Here we show that mice lacking both HSL and leptin (Lepob/ob/HSL-/-) show impaired adipogenesis and paradoxical resistance to obesity primarily due to the reduced food intake. These observations in the leptin-deficient state have revealed new functions of HSL in adipogenesis and feeding behavior. Animals—HSL-/- mice (4Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R.

Genotyping was performed as described previously (4Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mice were housed in a temperature-controlled environment with a 12-h light/dark cycle and allowed free access to water and a standard chow diet (Oriental MF, Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan). Mice (16 weeks) were sacrificed after a 6-h fast unless otherwise stated. Mice were sacrificed at the end of the light cycle to isolate hypothalamic RNA. All experiments were performed in accord with institutional guidelines. Biochemical Analyses—Blood was collected from the retro-orbital venous plexus after a 6-h fast. Cholesterol (Determiner TC; Kyowa Medex, Tokyo, Japan), TG and glycerol (TG LH; Wako Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan), and FFA (NEFA C; Wako Chemicals) were measured enzymatically. Plasma glucose was measured by ANTSENSE II (Bayer Medical, Tokyo, Japan); plasma insulin was measured by the mouse insulin ELISA kit (Morinaga, Tokyo, Japan); and plasma corticosterone was measured by the EIA kit (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc., Webster, TX). Immunoblot Analysis—Hypothalamic regions were excised from 8-month-old male mice, homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.8 μg/ml aprotinin), and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. Fifty μg of the supernatant fraction was subjected to SDS/PAGE analysis. S100 protein (10 μg) from BAT of wild type mouse was used as a positive control. Immunoblot analysis was performed using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (4Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated by Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Hypothalamic RNA was isolated as described previously (10Kumar M.V. Shimokawa T. Nagy T.R. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1921-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Five μg of hypothalamic RNA from each mouse or 7.5–10 μg of white adipose tissue (WAT) RNA equally pooled from 3–5 mice of each genotype were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel containing formal-dehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane. The membranes were hybridized with probes, which were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Megaprime DNA labeling system kit (Amersham Biosciences) in Rapid-hyb Buffer (Amersham Biosciences) or ULTRAhyb hybridization buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX), and analyzed by a BAS2000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). Loading was normalized by the expression of 36B4. Histology—Sixteen-week-old mice were sacrificed by decapitation. Tissues were excised, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Cell size was estimated by NIH Image. After blocking with 0.5% goat serum, sections of epididymal fat pads were incubated with anti-mouse S-100 antibody (Sigma) overnight and were incubated with an anti-rabbit secondary antibody followed by staining with the avidin-biotin complex-alkaline phosphatase method and counterstaining with Harris's hematoxylin. Apoptotic cells were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling using an in situ apoptosis detection kit (Takara Biomedicals Otsu, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with counterstaining with methyl green (Wako Chemicals). Proliferating cells were detected by bromodeoxyuridine immunostaining. Two h before sacrifice, bromodeoxyuridine (Sigma) was administered intraperitoneally at 50 mg/kg body weight in phosphate-buffered saline. After fixation with 10% neutral buffered formalin, mouse epididymal fat was embedded in paraffin. Immunostaining was performed by a bromodeoxyuridine In-Situ Detection Kit (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Wako Chemicals). Detection of DNA Ladder—Adipose tissue DNA was extracted as described previously (4Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Five μg of DNA end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by Klenow was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel and then transferred to nylon membranes, as described previously (11Dix D.J. Allen J.W. Collins B.W. Mori C. Nakamura N. Poorman-Allen P. Goulding E.H. Eddy E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3264-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). As a control, mouse thymocyte apoptotic DNA was loaded. In brief, mouse thymus was ground over a mesh, and the isolated thymocytes were induced to undergo apoptosis by culturing in RPMI containing 10% calf serum and 1 μm dexamethasone at 37 °C for 6 h. Food Intake and Body Temperature—Food intake and body weight were measured for 3 days after the mice were individually housed and adapted for 1 week. Feeding efficiency was defined as an increase in body weight divided by food intake during 3 days (n = 8–10). Body temperature was measured by an NK-YSI precision N550 thermometer and its probe (Nikkiso-YSI, Japan). These experiments were performed at the end of light cycle at the age of 14 weeks. Oxygen Consumption—After a 1-day acclimation period, oxygen and bicarbonate expired by mice (14 weeks old) were measured every 7 min for 24 h by a calorimetric system (Alco System model, Chiba Japan). Oxygen consumption was normalized by body weight raised to the 0.7 power, which is proportional to body surface area. Statistics—Statistical differences between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and a post hoc Tukey-Kramer test, unless otherwise stated. HSL Deficiency Ameliorates Obesity in Lepob/ob Background—In the Lep+/+ background, there was no difference in body weight among HSL+/+, HSL+/-, and HSL-/- mice on a normal chow diet (Fig. 1a). In the Lepob/ob background, however, body weight of doubly homozygous mice was reduced by 26% compared with the Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice at the age of 16 weeks (Fig. 1a). The difference was discernible at the age of 11 weeks in males and 9 weeks in females. Furthermore, the age-dependent weight gain was negligible in Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice after 10 weeks of age. At the age of 16 weeks, the weight of WAT in three different regions was selectively reduced in Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice compared with Lepob/ob/HSL+/+ mice; paragonadal, perirenal, and subcutaneous WAT were reduced by 58, 51, and 44%, respectively (Fig. 1b). HSL-/- Mice Have an Increased Number of Preadipocyte-like Cells in WAT—In the Lep+/+ background, WAT from HSL-/- mice contained clusters of small cells devoid of lipids in addition to lipid-filled mature adipocytes (Fig. 2a), as we reported previously (4Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). In the Lepob/ob background, the small cells, which appeared slightly increased in Lepob/ob/HSL+/+ mice, were robustly increased in Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice (Fig. 2, a and b). To determine the identity of these small cells, we performed immunohistochemistry for S-100 protein, which is used as a marker of adipocytes (12Cinti S. Cigolini M. Morroni M. Zingaretti M.C. Anat. Rec. 1989; 224: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), particularly of preadipocytes, and neural cells (Fig. 2c). The small cells were strongly positive for S-100, indicating that they were preadipocytes. Upon Northern blot analyses of WAT (Fig. 3a), the expression of adipose differentiation-related protein (13Jiang H.P. Serrero G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7856-7860Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and CAAT/enhancer-binding protein β, which is dominant during the early stage of differentiation of adipocytes (14Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), was increased in HSL-/- WAT compared with HSL+/+ WAT in both Lep+/+ and Lepob/ob backgrounds. On the other hand, the expression of CAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, which is dominant during the late stage of differentiation (14Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), adipocyte determination and differentiation factor 1/sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (15Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), fatty acid synthase (16Mackall J.C. Student A.K. Polakis S.E. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6462-6464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and peroxisome proliferator activator receptor γ (17Chawla A. Schwarz E.J. Dimaculangan D.D. Lazar M.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) was decreased in HSL-/- WAT compared with HSL+/+ WAT in both Lep+/+ and Lepob/ob backgrounds. These results strongly support the results of immunohistochemistry and the conclusion that preadipocytes were increased in HSL-/- WAT. No significant differences were observed in the expression of lipoprotein lipase and uncoupling protein-2 between Lepob/ob/HSL+/+ and Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice. To rule out the possibility that the small cells are apoptotic due to overaccumulation of intracellular TG, we performed terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling staining and DNA ladder detection. Although Lepob/ob WAT contained an increased number of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling-positive apoptotic cells and increased DNA ladder formation compared with Lep+/+ WAT, there was no difference between HSL+/+ and HSL-/- WAT (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, we performed in vivo bromodeoxyuridine labeling to determine whether the small cells have increased proliferative activity. No increase in bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells was observed in HSL-/- WAT (data not shown). Food Intake Is Reduced in Obese HSL-/- Mice—To determine the causes of the lower adiposity in Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice, we examined food intake. In the Lep+/+ background, there was no difference in food intake between HSL+/+ and HSL-/- mice. In the Lepob/ob background, food intake, which was increased compared with the Lep+/+ background, was reduced by 19% in HSL-/- mice compared with HSL+/+ mice at the age of 14 weeks (Fig. 4a). The reduced food intake was apparent at least after 8 weeks of age (data not shown). Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice had significantly lower feeding efficiency than Lepob/ob/HSL+/+ mice (Fig. 4b), indicating that the reduced food intake was not the only mechanism contributing to the leanness of Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice. Adrenalectomy reduces food intake (18Saito M. Bray G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246 (Pt 2): R20-R25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Makimura H. Mizuno T.M. Roberts J. Silverstein J. Beasley J. Mobbs C.V. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1917-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) in Lepob/ob mice, which are in hyper-ACTH status, and HSL deficiency reduces the corticosterone response to ACTH (20Kraemer F.B. Shen W.J. Natu V. Patel S. Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Azhar S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Li H. Brochu M. Wang S.P. Rochdi L. Cote M. Mitchell G. Gallo-Payet N. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured basal plasma corticosterone levels to examine whether adrenal insufficiency underlies the reduced food intake. There was no significant decrease in the plasma corticosterone levels in Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice compared with Lepob/ob/HSL+/+ mice (Fig. 4c). Hypothalamus expressed HSL protein in wild-type mice but not in HSL-/- mice (Fig. 5a). The suppressed food intake in Lepob/ob mice led us to examine the expression of various neuropeptides that govern appetite and satiety in the hypothalamus (Fig. 5, b and c). The expression levels of NPY and AgRP, both of which were induced in Lepob/ob background, were decreased nearly to the level of lean Lep+/+ mice (Fig. 5, b and c). The expression levels of pro-opiomelanocortin, which were suppressed in the Lepob/ob background, were not different between HSL+/+ and HSL-/- mice (Fig. 5, b and c). In addition to food intake, energy expenditure determines adiposity. Body temperature, which was reduced in the Lepob/ob background, was not significantly different between HSL+/+ and HSL-/- mice (Fig. 6a). Consistently, the mean oxygen consumption during 24 h was not significantly different between HSL+/+ and HSL-/- mice in the Lepob/ob background when normalized by body surface area (males, 0.120 ± 0.024 versus 0.136 ± 0.019 ml/min/g0.7, p = 0.18; females, 0.119 ± 0.021 versus 0.135 ± 0.025 ml/min/g0.7, p = 0.18), although Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice appeared to have higher oxygen consumption than Lepob/ob/HSL+/+ mice (Fig. 6b). HSL Deficiency Decreases Plasma Levels of FFA and Glycerol—Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice showed significant reduction in plasma levels of FFA and glycerol compared with Lepob/ob/HSL+/+ mice (FFA, 663 ± 67 versus 1,174 ± 17 μm, p < 0.01; glycerol, 10.0 ± 2.8 versus 43.4 ± 6.0 mg/dl, p < 0.01). In the lean Lep+/+/HSL-/- mice, plasma cholesterol levels were elevated, whereas plasma TG levels were decreased compared with those in Lep+/+/HSL+/+ mice, which was due to an increase in high density lipoproteins and a decrease in very low density lipoproteins, respectively (data not shown), as reported previously (22Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Kratky D. Riederer M. Knipping G. Zechner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12946-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the Lepob/ob background, no significant difference was observed between HSL+/+ and HSL-/- mice. Leanness and low plasma FFA levels are commonly associated with increased insulin sensitivity, whereas impaired adipogenesis is associated with insulin resistance (23Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Ikemoto S. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3182-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). To estimate insulin sensitivity, we measured blood levels of glucose and insulin. There were no differences in the blood glucose and plasma insulin levels between Lepob/ob/HSL+/+ and Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice when fasted (data not shown), indicating that insulin sensitivity was not significantly different between them. In the present studies, we use Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice to show that the absence of HSL inhibits adipogenesis and feeding behavior, thereby decreasing adiposity in leptin-deficient obesity. Resistance to obesity was also observed in a high fat diet-induced obesity model (24Harada K. Shen W.J. Patel S. Natu V. Wang J. Osuga J.I. Ishibashi S. Kraemer F.B. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: E1182-E1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Adipocytes in WAT of Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice displayed exaggerated size heterogeneity (Fig. 2, a and b). In particular, small cells were remarkably increased. Although adipocytes from Lepob/ob WAT are prone to apoptosis upon insulin depletion (25Loftus T.M. Kuhajda F.P. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14168-14172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and indeed Lepob/ob WAT contained a substantial number of apoptotic cells, HSL deficiency did not further increase the number of apoptotic cells in either the Lep+/+ or Lepob/ob settings (Fig. 3c). Since the majority of the small cells were positive for S-100 protein (Fig. 2c), we consider the small cells to be preadipocytes. This view is consistent with the gene expression profiles of WAT; adipose differentiation-related protein and CAAT/enhancer-binding protein β, which characterize the early phase of adipocyte differentiation, were up-regulated, and CAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, peroxisome proliferator activator receptor γ, adipocyte determination and differentiation factor 1/sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1, and fatty acid synthase, which characterize the mature stage of adipocyte differentiation, were down-regulated (Fig. 3a). Based on these results, we speculate that HSL deficiency inhibits adipogenesis in a certain population of preadipocytes, thereby stimulating their accumulation. Substances released from adipocytes of Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice may mediate the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. In this context, it is of note that FFA, whose production was reduced in HSL-/- mice, induces differentiation of preadipocytes (26Amri E.Z. Bertrand B. Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1449-1456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Amri E.Z. Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P. J.

Moreover, Janke et al. (30Janke J. Engeli S. Gorzelniak K. Luft F.C. Sharma A.M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1699-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) have recently reported that angiotensin II secreted by mature adipocytes inhibits differentiation of preadipocytes in culture. It is also possible that intracellular lipids such as DG, which are accumulated in the absence of HSL (6Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Hayn M. Theussl C. Waeg G. Wagner E. Sattler W. Magin T.M. Wagner E.F. Zechner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4806-4815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), directly inhibit adipogenesis. It is tempting to speculate that protein kinase C activation by DG inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3 (31Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby enhancing signaling of Wnt, a negative regulator of adipogenesis (32Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). The impaired adipogenesis observed in Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice appears to be inconsistent with our previous findings that HSL-/- embryonic fibroblasts are indistinguishable from wild-type embryonic fibroblasts in adipogenic ability (8Okazaki H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Yahagi N. Tomita S. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Kimura S. Gotoda T. Shimano H. Yamada N. Ishibashi S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3368-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the experiments in vitro, a pharmacological dose of insulin, methyl-isobutylxanthine, or dexamethasone in the differentiation induction medium may have overcome the reduced adipogenic potential of HSL-/- embryonic fibroblasts. Indeed, it was reported that exposure to methyl-isobutylxanthine or cAMP is sufficient to suppress expression of Wnt10b in 3T3-L1 cells (33Bennett C.N. Ross S.E. Longo K.A. Bajnok L. Hemati N.

Hyperphagia of leptin-deficient Lepob/ob is mediated by the up-regulation of the orexigenic neuropeptides, NPY (34Wilding J.P. Gilbey S.G. Bailey C.J. Batt R.A. Williams G. Ghatei M.A. Bloom S.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and AgRP (35Shutter J.R. Graham M. Kinsey A.C. Scully S. Luthy R. Stark K.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), with concomitant suppression of the pro-opiomelanocortin gene, which encodes the anorexigenic α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (36Thornton J.E. Cheung C.C. Clifton D.K. Steiner R.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5063-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Since disruption of NPY (37Erickson J.C. Hollopeter G. Palmiter R.D.

Together with the hypothalamic expression of HSL (Fig. 5a), these results strongly indicate the crucial role of hypothalamic metabolism of fatty acids in the control of feeding behavior. In this context, it is noteworthy that inhibition of FFA synthesis by fatty acid synthase inhibitors shows similar suppressing effects on food intake (39Loftus T.M. Jaworsky D.E. Frehywot G.L.

Science. 2000; 288: 2379-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar) as well as on fasting-induced increase in the hypothalamic expression of NPY and AgRP (40Shimokawa T. Kumar M.V. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Likewise, inhibition of hypothalamic carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 decreases food intake (41Obici S. Feng Z. Arduini A. Conti R. Rossetti L. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 756-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Neither body temperature nor oxygen consumption was different between Lepob/ob/HSL-/- and Lepob/ob/HSL+/+ mice (Fig. 6). Thus, the reduced food intake as well as the defective differentiation of preadipocytes may account for the lower adipocity in Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice at least in mice aged older than 8 weeks (Fig. 1). It is interesting to note that the lower adiposity was not observed in mice younger than 8 weeks. We speculate that non-HSL TG lipase compensates for the deficiency of HSL until about 8 weeks of age in terms of growth and adiposity. Leanness or resistance to obesity has been reported in other murine models with mutated genes that are instrumental in fatty acid metabolism. For example, mice lacking the RIIβ subunit of protein kinase A (42Cummings D.E. Brandon E.P. Planas J.V. Motamed K. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S.

In particular, mice with a mutation in the peroxisome proliferator activator receptor γ-binding site in the gene for the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which lack expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity in WAT, are similar to Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice in that their WAT also has accumulation of lipodystrophy-like small cells dispersed among normal large fat cells (46Olswang Y. Cohen H. Papo O. Cassuto H. Croniger C.M. Hakimi P. Tilghman S.M. Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The significance of this similarity is currently unknown. In conclusion, Lepob/ob/HSL-/- mice have impaired adipogenesis and resistance to obesity at least partially due to the reduced food intake. These findings should provide the basis for understanding the pathophysiology of obesity and can be exploited to develop novel therapy for the endemic disease."

Lipid Domains and the Relationship to Membrane Function. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 43-62Google Scholar). Although detailed insight into the underlying mechanisms has not yet been achieved, a current model proposes that lipid bilayers modulate nAChR function by altering the natural equilibrium that exists between “functional” resting and “nonfunctional” desensitized conformational states (3Baenziger J.E.

In native post-synaptic membranes, this equilibrium strongly favors the resting conformation, allowing the nAChR to flux cations in response to agonist binding. The equilibrium is maintained in favor of the resting conformation in reconstituted bilayers composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC), an anionic lipid, such as phosphatidic acid (PA), and a neutral lipid, such as cholesterol (Chol) (3Baenziger J.E.

The effects of neutral and anionic lipids on nAChR conformational equilibria are not dependent upon a global change in secondary structure (9Methot N. Demers C.N. Baenziger J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15142-15149Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The presence of either or both lipids in a reconstituted PC membrane does slow nAChR peptide hydrogen exchange kinetics, suggesting a decrease in the rates and/or amplitudes of internal nAChR motions (10Baenziger J.E. Darsaut T.E. Morris M.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4905-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Additional experiments have expanded on this simple model of lipid action, showing that the addition of either PA or Chol alone to a PC membrane is sufficient to shift the conformational equilibrium toward the resting state (3Baenziger J.E. Morris M.L. Darsaut T.E. Ryan S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 777-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 6Ryan S.E. Demers C.N. Chew J.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol.

The degree of the conformational shift depends on both the type and amount of lipid added, with PA being particularly effective at stabilizing a resting conformation (3Baenziger J.E. Morris M.L.

As increasing amounts of either Chol or PA in a PC membrane could lower bilayer fluidity, we suggested that both lipids may shift the conformational equilibrium in favor of the resting state by decreasing the fluidity of the membrane surrounding the nAChR (3Baenziger J.E.

Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Any links that exist between membrane physical properties and nAChR function, however, are likely complex (11daCosta C.J. Ogrel A.A. McCardy E.A. Blanton M.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).A recent study also showed that incorporation of the nAChR into PC membranes containing PA leads to a substantial increase in both the gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition temperature and the lateral packing density of the lipids. In contrast, incorporation of the nAChR into membranes composed of either PC or PC/Chol has little effect (11daCosta C.J. Ogrel A.A. McCardy E.A. Blanton M.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12253-12262Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The ability of the nAChR to selectively modulate the physical properties of PC membranes containing PA is of particular interest given that PC/PA membranes are especially effective at stabilizing a functional nAChR. These results suggest that there is a bi-directional “coupling” between the nAChR and PA-containing lipid bilayers in that the lipids modulate nAChR structure/function, whereas in return the nAChR modulates lipid structure and possibly function. This bi-directional coupling may underlie the unique mechanism by which PA influences nAChR conformational equilibria and thus stabilizes a functional nAChR.To understand the mechanism(s) by which PA modulates nAChR conformational equilibria, it is first necessary to define the structural features of PA that allow it to interact with the nAChR in a unique fashion. To test whether or not a net negative charge is sufficient to account for these interactions, we have reconstituted the nAChR into PC membranes containing varying levels of the lipid phosphatidylserine (PS). PS has a net negative charge and is abundant in Torpedo post-synaptic membranes. Surprisingly, our results show that despite its net negative charge, increasing levels of PS in a PC membrane do not increase the proportion of receptors in the functional resting conformation, nor do they slow nAChR peptide hydrogen exchange kinetics. Incorporation of the nAChR into PC/PS membranes also has little effect on the gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition of the lipid bilayer. Negative charge alone is thus not sufficient to account for the interactions that occur between the nAChR and PA-containing lipid bilayers. Incorporation of the nAChR does, however, lead to an altered head group conformation of PS possibly by recruiting divalent cations to the membrane surface. Our results illustrate the complex interactions that can occur between the nAChR and different lipids. The data highlight the unique and possibly essential interactions that occur between the nAChR and PA. Finally, the data suggest that divalent cations play a role in bridging the structural effects that occur between the nAChR and PS-containing lipid bilayers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Frozen Torpedo californica electroplax tissue was obtained from either Marinus (Long Beach, CA) or Aquatic Research Consultants (San Pedro, CA). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (POPA), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine] (P-OPS) were from Avanti Polar lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL), and both cholesterol and carbamylcholine chloride (Carb) were from Sigma.nAChR Purification and Reconstitution—The nAChR was solubilized in 1% cholate and affinity-purified on a bromoacetylcholine bromide-derivatized Affi-Gel 102 column (Bio-Rad) as described in detail elsewhere (7McCarthy M.P. Moore M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7655-7663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The column bound nAChR was washed extensively with dialysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.02% w/v NaN3, pH 7.8) containing 1% cholate and a 3.2 mm concentration of the desired lipid. The nAChR was then eluted from the column with a 0.13 mm lipid solution in 250 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 5 mm phosphate, pH 7.8, with 0.5% cholate and 10 mm Carb. After elution from the column, the nAChR was dialyzed five times against 2 liters of dialysis buffer with a buffer change once every 12 h.FTIR Spectroscopy—All of the FTIR spectra were recorded on either a Digi-Lab FTS 575 or a FTS 40 spectrometer (Randolph, MA) as described by daCosta et al. (11daCosta C.J. Ogrel A.A. McCardy E.A. Blanton M.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Both spectrometers were equipped with a deuterated triglycine sulfate detector. For the analysis of protein secondary structure, the extent of peptide hydrogen/deuterium exchange, and lipid thermotropic phase behavior, each nAChR sample was first incubated at 4 °C in 2H2O phosphate buffer for precisely 72 h to exchange peptide N-1H for N-2H and then stored at -80 °C. Prior to FTIR analysis, the samples were individually thawed, centrifuged, resuspended in 30 μl of 2H2O phosphate buffer, and subjected to five freeze thaw vortex cycles. Except where noted, all of the FTIR spectra were recorded in Torpedo Ringer buffer (5 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm CaCl2, pH 7).The POPC/POPS 3:2 samples recorded in the presence of 20 mm EDTA (Fig. 6, right panel, dashed spectrum) were prepared as described above, except that after the 72-h incubation in 2H2O, the membranes were pelleted and resuspended in 20 mm EDTA, 5 mm Tris 2H2O. After 15 min, the samples were pelleted, resuspended in 30 μl of 2 mm2H2O phosphate buffer, and then subjected to freeze-thaw-vortex cycles. The samples deposited on CaF2 windows were rehydrated with 8 μl of 20 mm EDTA and 5 mm Tris 2H2O buffer. All of the spectral deconvolution was performed using GRAMS/AI v.7.01 software (Galactic, Salem, NH).The data acquisition protocols for assessing the thermotropic phase behavior of the membranes have been described previously (11daCosta C.J. Ogrel A.A. McCardy E.A. Blanton M.P. Baenziger J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, 128 scans at 2-cm-1 resolution were acquired at one-degree intervals as the sample was cooled from 35 °C to -10 °C. Note that all of the 2H2O buffers were prepared by drying the corresponding 1H2O buffers (pH 7.0) and then rehydrating them with the appropriate volume of 2H2O. The p2H values were then verified with litmus paper.FTIR difference spectra were recorded at 22.5 °C using the attenuated total reflectance technique as described in detail elsewhere (13Ryan S.E. Baenziger J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Baenziger J.E. Jarrell H.C. Smith I.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3377-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, two spectra were recorded while flowing Torpedo Ringer buffer past a nAChR film that was deposited on the surface of a germanium internal reflection element. The flowing buffer was switched to an identical buffer containing 50 μm Carb and a spectrum recorded of the Carb bound state. The nAChR film was then washed with Torpedo Ringer buffer for 20 min to remove nAChR bound Carb, and the data acquisition protocol was repeated. All of the spectra were recorded at 8-cm-1 resolution, signal averaging 512 scans/spectrum, which took ∼8 min/spectrum. Each presented difference spectrum is the average of more than 40 individual difference spectra recorded from at least two different films, from on average four separate reconstitutions. The difference spectra were base line-corrected between 1800 and 1000 cm-1 and were interpolated to a resolution of 4 cm-1.RESULTSFTIR spectra of the nAChR affinity-purified and reconstituted into membranes composed of POPC, POPC/POPS 3:1 (mol/mol), POPC/POPS 3:2 (mol/mol), POPC/POPS/Chol 3:1:1 (mol/mol/mol), and POPC/POPA 3:2 (mol/mol) each exhibit four main features in the 1800–1400-cm-1 region (Fig. 1). These four features are mainly attributable to the protein amide I (1700–1600 cm-1), amide II (1520–1580 cm-1), and amide II′ (1500–1400 cm-1) vibrations, as well as to the ester carbonyl stretching vibrations of the membrane phospholipid (1750–1700 cm-1). The shapes and relative intensities of the three protein bands reflect structural features of the nAChR in each membrane, whereas the shape of the lipid ester carbonyl vibration reflects the structure of the surrounding lipid environment (see below). Subtle differences are observed in each of the vibrational bands between spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into POPC/POPS 3:2 and POPC/POPA 3:2 membranes (Fig. 1). These variations are typical of the variations observed between spectra recorded from the nAChR in each of the five lipid environments and provide insight into the mechanisms by which the nAChR couples its structure and function to the composition of its surrounding lipid bilayer.Fig. 1FTIR spectra of the nAChR reconstituted into POPC/POPA 3:2 (dashed line) and POPC/POPS 3:2 (solid line) membranes. The absorbance axis is shown for the POPC/POPS 3:2 sample (the POPC/POPA 3:2 sample is scaled to the same amide I intensity). All of the samples had similar amide I intensities that varied by no more than ±5%. Solvent 2H2O and atmospheric H2O vapor have been subtracted from each spectrum. The spectra were base line-corrected and zeroed between 1800 and 1350 cm-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)nAChR Structure and Internal Dynamics—The amide I band between 1600 and 1700 cm-1 is due predominantly to the peptide carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration, and its shape is sensitive to hydrogen bonding and thus protein secondary structure. Deconvolution of the amide I band provides a clearer view of the frequencies and relative intensities of the underlying component vibrations and thus permits a qualitative assessment of the secondary structure of the nAChR in each lipid environment (Fig. 2, left panel) (15Jackson M. Mantsch H.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). In each case, the deconvolved amide I band exhibits a similar number of underlying components at similar relative intensities, including two major peaks of intensity near 1655 and 1636 cm-1 because of α-helical and β-sheet secondary structures, respectively (15Jackson M. Mantsch H.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). The overall similarities of the deconvolved amide I band shapes indicate that the nAChR has roughly the same mixed α-helix/β-sheet structure in each membrane environment.Fig. 2The deconvolved amide I band (left panel) and residual amide II band intensity (right panel) in FTIR spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into 3:2 POPC/POPA (A), 3:1:1 POPC/POPS/Chol (B), 3:2 POPC/POPS (C), 3:1 POPC/POPS (D), and POPC (E) membranes. The amide I bands presented in the left panel were deconvolved between 1900 and 1300 cm-1 with a γ factor of 7 and a smoothing parameter of 70%. Amide II bands presented in the right panel are not deconvolved. All of the samples were exposed to 2H2O buffer for 72 h at 4 °C prior to data acquisition, and a spectrum of 2H2O buffer has been subtracted from each. All of the samples are hydrated with 2H2O Torpedo ringer buffer. The spectra were recorded at 22.5 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The nondeconvolved amide I bands in spectra recorded from the nAChR in POPC and mixtures of POPC and POPS are slightly downshifted in frequency relative to the amide I bands in spectra recorded from the nAChR in either POPC/POPA 3:2 or POPC/POPS/Chol 3:1:1 membranes (Fig. 1). Deconvolution shows that this downshift in frequency is due to a subtle shift in intensity from 1655 cm-1 down to 1645 cm-1 (Fig. 2, left panel). Although the decrease in α-helical amide I component band intensity could reflect a minor decrease in α-helical structure, previous studies have shown that the α-helical vibration undergoes a shift in frequency from 1655 cm-1 in 1H2O down to near 1645 cm-1 in 2H2O (16Baenziger J.E. Methot N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29129-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17Methot N. Baenziger J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14815-14822Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After 72 h of exposure to 2H2O, roughly 25% of the nAChR peptide hydrogens remain unexchanged for deuterium, although the extent of peptide hydrogen-deuterium exchange is sensitive to lipid environment (16Baenziger J.E. Methot N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29129-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The greater intensity near 1655 cm-1 in the spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into membranes composed of POPC/POPS/Chol 3:1:1 and POPC/POPA 3:2 could result from a slower rate of peptide hydrogen-deuterium exchange in these two membrane environments relative to that observed in the POPC, POPC/POPS 3:1, and POPC/POPS 3:2 membranes and thus a greater proportion of unexchanged α-helical structures after 3 days of exposure of the nAChR to 2H2O.A slowing of peptide hydrogen exchange kinetics for the nAChR reconstituted into POPC/POPA 3:2 and POPC/POPS/Chol 3:1:1 versus POPC, POPC/POPS 3:1, and POPC/POPS 3:2 membranes is supported by the relative residual amide II band intensities observed near 1547 cm-1 in various spectra (Figs. 1 and 2, right panel). The amide II band is predominantly due to the N-1H in-plane bending vibration of the polypeptide backbone. The vibration shifts down in frequency to near 1450 cm-1 (amide II′ band) upon exposure of the nAChR to 2H2O and consequent exchange of peptide N-1H for N-2H (16Baenziger J.E. Methot N. J. Biol.

The residual intensity centered near 1547 cm-1 overlaps with the broad asymmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylic acid side chains (Asp and Glu) between 1560 and 1590 cm-1 and is proportional to the number of unexchanged peptide hydrogens. Spectra of the nAChR in POPC/POPA 3:2 and POPC/POPS/Chol 3:1:1 membranes exhibit an increased residual amide II band intensity near 1547 cm-1 and thus a greater proportion of unexchanged peptide hydrogens relative to the nAChR in POPC and POPC/POPS (3:1 and 3:2) membranes. A previous study with the nAChR showed that similar variations in the levels of peptide hydrogen/deuterium exchange lead to similar changes in nAChR amide I band shape (9Methot N. Demers C.N. Baenziger J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15142-15149Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results therefore suggest that the secondary structure of the nAChR is not influenced by the presence of POPA, POPS, or both POPS and Chol in a reconstituted POPC membrane. Instead, these lipids modulate the amplitude and/or rates of nAChR internal motions, resulting in differences in the extent of peptide 1H-2H exchange.Note that the presence of either 25 or 40 mol % POPS in a reconstituted POPC membrane does not lead to a slowing of nAChR peptide hydrogen exchange kinetics and thus a slowing of nAChR internal dynamics (relative to the nAChR in POPC membranes) as seen in the presence of 40 mol % POPA. This shows that negative charge alone is not sufficient to account for the effects of POPA on nAChR structure. The data also support the hypothesis that there is a correlation between the internal dynamics of the nAChR in different membranes and the ability of the membrane to stabilize the nAChR in a functional state (see “Discussion”).nAChR Conformational Equilibria—The effects of bilayer lipid composition on nAChR conformational equilibria were examined using FTIR difference spectroscopy (Fig. 3). The difference between spectra of the nAChR recorded in the presence and absence of the agonist carbamylcholine (referred to as a Carb difference spectrum) exhibits a complex pattern of positive and negative bands that reflect the vibrational changes in the nAChR that occur upon Carb binding and subsequent desensitization. Positive and negative difference bands in the 1640–16700cm-1 (mainly peptide C=O stretching) and 1520–1580-cm-1 (mainly and peptide N–H bending) regions reflect the structural changes in the polypeptide backbone that occur upon transition from the resting to the desensitized conformational state. The pattern of overlapping difference bands in both regions of spectra recorded from the nAChR in POPC/POPA 3:2 membranes is similar to that observed in difference spectra recorded from the nAChR in native and PC/PA/Chol 3:1:1 membranes (data not shown). This pattern is characteristic of a receptor that is stabilized in a resting conformation that undergoes desensitization upon Carb binding.Fig. 3A selected region of Carb difference spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into membranes composed of 3:2 POPC/POPA(A), 3:1:1 POPC/POPS/Chol(B), 3:2 POPC/POPS(C), 3:1 POPC/POPS(D), and POPC(E). Positive intensity near 1663, 1655, and 1547 cm-1 is associated with the resting to desensitized conformational change. Note that a change in intensity near 1663 cm-1 is most easily visualized by a change in overlapping negative band intensity near 1668 cm-1 (13Ryan S.E. Baenziger J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Positive intensity at each of these frequencies in traces A and B indicates that the nAChR undergoes desensitization upon Carb binding. The absence of positive intensity in traces C–E indicates that the nAChR is likely stabilized in a desensitized state. Both the horizontal line and the shading have been included in each spectrum as a visual reference.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Intensity is lost in both the 1640–1670 and 1520–1580 cm-1 spectral regions of difference spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into POPC and POPC/POPS (3:1 and 3:2) membranes (Fig. 3, spectra C–E). The resulting pattern of bands is similar to that observed in difference spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into PC/PA/Chol 3:1:1 membranes, although the nAChR is maintained in a desensitized conformation in the presence of a desensitizing local anesthetic, such as dibucaine. The pattern of bands observed in difference spectra recorded from the nAChR in either POPC alone or mixtures of POPC and POPS indicates that the nAChR cannot undergo the resting to desensitized conformational transition upon Carb binding. The spectra suggest that the nAChR is stabilized in a desensitized or desensitized-like conformation (see “Discussion” in Ref. 3Baenziger J.E. Morris M.L. Darsaut T.E. Ryan S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 777-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Based on the FTIR data, it is clear that the presence of POPS alone in a POPC membrane is not sufficient to shift the nAChR conformational equilibrium toward the resting state.In contrast, Carb difference spectra recorded from the nAChR in POPC/POPS/Chol 3:1:1 membranes exhibit a pattern of positive and negative vibrations that is intermediate between that observed in POPC/POPS and POPC/POPA 3:2 membranes. The spectra suggest that mixtures of POPC/POPS and Chol are somewhat effective at stabilizing the nAChR in a resting conformation, although the degree of the conformational shift toward the resting state is not as great as observed in POPC/POPA 3:2 membranes.Physical Properties of the Reconstituted nAChR Membranes—The effects of nAChR on the physical properties of the reconstituted lipid bilayers was first examined by comparing the gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition temperatures of the various POPC/POPS membranes in the presence and absence of the nAChR (Fig. 4). The methylene symmetric C–H stretching frequencies of the fatty acyl chains decreases by roughly 2 cm-1 upon transition from the liquid crystal to the gel state and can thus be used to monitor the gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition temperatures of the reconstituted bilayers (18Mendelsohn R. Mantsch H.H. Pont W.D. Progress in Protein-Lipid Interactions 2. Elsevier Science B.V., 1986: 103-224Google Scholar). Cooling curves for the different lipid membranes in the absence of the nAChR (open circles) vary depending on the lipid composition (Fig. 4). As shown previo"
https://openalex.org/W2003885999,"Functional interactions between mitochondrial DNA polymerase (pol γ) and mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (mtSSB) from Drosophila embryos greatly enhance the overall activity of pol γ by increasing primer recognition and binding and stimulating the rate of initiation of DNA strands (Farr, C. L., Wang, Y., and Kaguni, L. S. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 14779–14785). We show here that DNA-binding mutants of mtSSB are defective in stimulation of DNA synthesis by pol γ. RNAi knock-down of mtSSB reduces expression to <5% of its normal level in Schneider cells, resulting in growth defects and in the depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Overexpression of mtSSB restores cell growth rate and the copy number of mtDNA, whereas overexpression of a DNA-binding and functionally impaired form of mtSSB neither rescues the cell growth defect nor the mtDNA depletion phenotype. Further development of Drosophila animal models, in which induced mtDNA depletion is manipulated by controlling exogenous expression of wild-type or mutant forms, will offer new insight into the mechanism and progression of human mtDNA depletion syndromes and possible intervention schemes.

Mitochondrial biogenesis is a key process in animal cell proliferation, and mtDNA replication is an essential component of that process. Whereas a large number of proteins participate in multi-component replication machines in bacterial and nuclear systems, a minimal set of essential proteins are likely involved in the mtDNA replication process (1Kaguni L.S. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 293-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated functional interactions between the two-subunit Drosophila mitochondrial DNA polymerase (pol γ) 1The abbreviations used are: pol, DNA polymerase; nt, nucleotide(s); mtSSB, mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; GMSA, gel mobility shift assay; UTR, untranslated region. 1The abbreviations used are: pol, DNA polymerase; nt, nucleotide(s); mtSSB, mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; GMSA, gel mobility shift assay; UTR, untranslated region. and the homotetrameric mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein, mtSSB, at the levels of template-primer binding and initiation and elongation of DNA strand synthesis (2Farr C.L. Wang Y. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14779-14785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These studies have documented roles for mtSSB in enhancing primer recognition and binding and in stimulation by 20- to 30-fold of the rate of initiation of DNA strands by pol γ. Moreover, mtSSB increases severalfold the processivity of pol γ in DNA strand elongation.To probe further the biochemical and physiological importance of these functional interactions, we have evaluated the effects of altered forms of mtSSB on DNA binding per se and upon the coordinated reactions involving mtSSB and pol γ. We find that even modest DNA-binding defects in mtSSB substantially affect DNA synthesis by pol γ. Furthermore, under conditions that reduce cellular levels of endogenous wild-type mtSSB, a mtDNA depletion phenotype develops that is rescued by production of exogenous wild-type but not mutant mtSSB.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESNucleotides and Nucleic Acids—Unlabeled deoxy- and ribonucleotides were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.

Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell) and probed by immunoblotting. Filters were preincubated for 1 h with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by incubation for 1 h with Drosophila mtSSB antibody (1:500 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20). Filters were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad), and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20.

Blots were probed with radiolabeled DNAs for the mitochondrial gene ATPase6 and the nuclear histone gene cluster. The ratio of the signals for these two genes was used to estimate the relative copy number of mtDNA.Preparation of Inducible Plasmids Expressing Drosophila mtSSB and mtSSB-targeted RNAi—Plasmids in which wild-type or mutant Drosophila mtSSB cDNA is regulated by the metallothionein promoter were constructed as follows: a fragment of Drosophila mtSSB cDNA was amplified by PCR using as the 5′-primer, 5′-GCGCCTCGAGTGCAACCACAAGGCGCATGCTGAATCCTCTGTTGACC-3′, and as 3′-primer, 5′-GCGCACTAGTTTAGTTGTTGGCATCACGG-3′.

The plasmid pMt/Hy/INV carried an inverted repeat of a nucleotide sequence from the 3′-UTR of the Drosophila mtSSB cDNA that was transcribed from the metallothionein promoter. The insert in pMt/Hy/INV was generated from two PCR-amplified fragments of the Drosophila mtSSB cDNA. One fragment had terminal XhoI and EcoRI sites and was prepared using the following pair of primers: 5′-GCGCCTCGAGACTAGTAATTTAAGCCCAGATCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGCGAATTCGGGATCGATGGAGTACGACTACGCATG-3′(reverse).

We sought to explore the possible consequences of perturbing that interaction, both in biochemical assays and in vivo. To do so, we designed several site-directed mutants of mtSSB, targeting its DNA-binding domain. Several key amino acids have been identified in E. coli SSB and mammalian mtSSBs that affect DNA binding without affecting assembly of the tetramer (8Chase J.W. Williams K.R. Annu. Rev.

We made three substitutions of Trp79 in Drosophila mtSSB, with changes to Tyr (W79Y), Thr (W79T), and Ala (W79A), converted Phe85 to Ala (F85A), and constructed a double mutant containing the Trp79 → Thr and the Phe85 → Ala substitutions (W79T/F85A, Fig. 1, and “Experimental Procedures”). The recombinant proteins were produced by overexpression from pET-11a non-fusion constructs and purified to homogeneity as described by Farr et al. (2Farr C.L. Wang Y. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol.

A schematic representation of the structure of Drosophila mtSSB is shown. The mature protein comprises 124 amino acids that are preceded in the precursor protein by a 16-amino acid leader peptide. Alignment of the central DNA-binding domain among SSB proteins shows a high degree of sequence similarity. Two conserved amino acids, W79 and F85, were mutagenized to generate the five mutant mtSSBs used in this study: Dm, Drosophila melanogaster; Hs, Homo sapiens; Rr, Rattus ratti; Xl, Xenopus laevis; Sc, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Ec, Escherichia coli.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 2SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of wild-type and mutant forms of Drosophila mtSSB.

Using a GMSA, we examined relative DNA-binding affinity and stability of the mtSSB·DNA complexes in salt titrations using a 38-mer single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide (Fig. 3). First, a titration was performed to determine that amount of the wild-type mtSSB needed to bind and shift the electrophoretic position of the radiolabeled oligomer. Equivalent amounts of mutant homotetramers were then compared over a broad range of KCl concentrations.The standard assay for stimulation of pol γ by mtSSB on single-stranded DNA substrates is performed at 30 mm KCl, where maximal DNA synthesis combined with the highest enzyme processivity is observed (4Williams A.J. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 860-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Thommes P. Farr C.L. Marton R.F. Kaguni L.S. Cotterill S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21137-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Under this ionic condition, all of the mtSSB variants with single amino acid substitutions displayed DNA-binding activities ≥ 90% of wild type, whereas the double mutant W79T/F85A showed 50% of wild-type DNA binding (Fig. 3A). There was no change in the binding ability of the wild-type mtSSB up to 840 mm KCl, the highest salt concentration tested. The same profile was observed for the F85A mutant. The most conservative substitution of Trp79, Trp → Tyr, showed binding at a level of ∼90% of wild-type mtSSB, whereas the Trp → Thr and Ala variants showed steadily reduced binding activity with increasing salt, with values dropping to ∼50% at 840 mm KCl. The apparently synergistic effect of the W79T/F85A double substitution was exacerbated with increasing salt: a 10-fold drop in binding was observed at 840 mm KCl, as compared with binding at 30 mm KCl. Further discrimination was observed among the variants when the stability of mtSSB·DNA complexes was analyzed by saltback titration of complexes formed at 30 mm KCl (Fig. 3B). Again, the mtSSB variants with single amino acid substitutions displayed DNA-binding stabilities at 30 mm KCl that were similar to wild type, whereas the W79T/F85A mutant showed only 30% of the wild-type level. At 100 mm KCl, the W79Y complexes remained stable, but the Thr and Ala substitutions showed reduced stability, which became more apparent with increasing salt. There was no change in the fraction of bound complexes of wild-type mtSSB with increasing salt to 400 mm KCl, and at 800 mm KCl binding was ∼80% of that observed at 30 mm. The same profile was observed for the F85A mutant, whereas each of the Trp79 substitutions showed more pronounced decreases with increasing salt concentrations. The stability of the W79T/F85A complexes was less than 10% of that observed with the wild-type mtSSB. Taken together, the DNA binding and stability analyses of the mtSSB mutants would predict modest defects under ionic conditions favorable for functional interaction with pol γ during DNA synthesis, with increasingly more apparent defects with increasing ionic strength.At 120 mm KCl in the absence of mtSSB, pol γ shows maximal activity on singly primed M13 DNA (13Williams A.J. Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24855-24862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of mtSSB to the reaction lowers the KCl optimum ∼8-fold to 15–30 mm, while stimulating activity at low salt up to 18-fold (2Farr C.L. Wang Y. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14779-14785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 5Thommes P. Farr C.L. Marton R.F. Kaguni L.S. Cotterill S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21137-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although the DNA-binding activities of the mutants with single amino acid substitutions were all within 10% of that of the wild-type mtSSB at 30 mm KCl, defects in their abilities to stimulate DNA synthesis by pol γ were apparent in the range of 0–30 mm KCl (Fig. 4). Stimulation by the F85A mutant was reduced 1.5-fold, whereas that for the Trp79 mutants was reduced 2.0- to 3.7-fold, indicating a clear reduction in the functional interaction between pol γ and mtSSB. This was amplified in the W79T/F85A double mutant, in which binding activity was 50% of the wild-type level, yet its stimulation of pol γ activity dropped 8-fold, to less than twice the activity of pol γ alone. At higher KCl concentrations, where the activity of pol γ alone is highest, the effects of the mutant mtSSBs were less apparent, although it seems likely from their DNA-binding defects at elevated ionic strength that functional interactions with pol γ are in fact further reduced.The processivity of pol γ on singly primed M13 DNA decreases with increasing ionic strength, such that at moderate KCl concentrations (120 mm), where DNA polymerase activity is highest, processivity is reduced severalfold, as compared with that at low ionic strength (30 mm) (13Williams A.J. Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24855-24862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mtSSB increases pol γ processivity over a broad salt range, though in a disproportional manner relative to stimulation of DNA polymerase activity at the same salt concentrations (5Thommes P. Farr C.L. Marton R.F. Kaguni L.S. Cotterill S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21137-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Given the variable effects of the mutations generated in mtSSB upon DNA binding and pol γ stimulation, we examined the effects of several of the mutants on pol γ processivity at both low and moderate salt. At 30 mm KCl, the processivity of pol γ alone is high (∼2100 nt) and is increased modestly by the addition of wild-type mtSSB to ∼3100 nt (Fig. 5), whereas a more pronounced effect is observed at 120 mm KCl, with an increase of 2.8-fold, from ∼70 to 200 nt. A similar effect is observed with mtSSB F85A, which showed wild-type DNA-binding activity and slightly reduced stimulatory activity. Although mtSSB W79A showed substantially greater DNA binding and stimulatory activity as compared with mtSSB W79T/F85A, neither mutant was able to enhance pol γ processivity.Drosophila mtSSB Models of Mitochondrial Dysfunction—We developed several approaches to assess the impact on mitochondrial DNA metabolism of reduced DNA binding by mtSSB and loss of functional interactions with pol γ, including both animal and cell culture models. First, we constructed transgenic Drosophila strains that express either the wild-type or mutant forms of mtSSB under the control of the Drosophila hsp70 promoter. In a previous study (14Lefai E. Calleja M. Ruiz de Mena I. Lagina III, A.T. Kaguni L.S. Garesse R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 264: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we showed that overexpression of the catalytic subunit of pol γ using such a strategy resulted in both developmental and morphological defects, depending on the level and temporal pattern of overexpression. Despite our ability to demonstrate expression of the transgenes in both the wild-type and mutant mtSSB lines, both in the presence or absence of heat shock over six generations, we observed no aberrant phenotypes in terms of developmental timing, eclosion frequency, adult body weight, or locomotion, nor did we find a reduction in mtDNA copy number (data not shown). Although there are a number of possible explanations for this finding, one that seemed likely is the substantially higher level of endogenous mtSSB as compared with pol γ, which is apparent both in protein and mRNA levels at various stages in fly development (Refs. 14Lefai E. Calleja M. Ruiz de Mena I. Lagina III, A.T. Kaguni L.S. Garesse R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 264: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Ruiz de Mena I. Lefai E. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33123-33133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, and data not shown).To circumvent this putative problem and issues related to cell type and tissue specificity of expression during development, we evaluated the effects of high-level overexpression of mutant mtSSB in cultured cells. To do so, we developed stably transfected Drosophila Schneider S2 lines, in which the wild-type and mutant mtSSB genes are expressed under the control of the Drosophila metallothionein promoter in the vector pMt/Hy (see “Experimental Procedures”). Following induction with 0.4 mm CuSO4, immunoblot analysis of whole-cell extracts using antiserum directed against Drosophila mtSSB showed protein overexpressed at levels 3- to 7-fold above the endogenous level (data not shown). Although there was no effect of overexpression of wild-type mtSSB upon either cell growth rate or mtDNA content, overexpression of the W79T/F85A mtSSB produced an mtDNA-depletion phenotype. After culturing the cells in 0.4 mm CuSO4 for a period of 21 days, there was no apparent effect on growth rate, but Southern analysis demonstrated a 40% reduction in mtDNA copy number in the double mutant as compared with both control cells and those overexpressing wild-type mtSSB (data not shown).These data are consistent with our hypothesis that mutant mtSSB expression would result in defects of mtDNA replication that should lead to mtDNA depletion such as that found in human"
https://openalex.org/W2040787081,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene FPS1 encodes an aquaglyceroporin of the major intrinsic protein (MIP) family. The main function of Fps1p seems to be the efflux of glycerol in the adaptation of the yeast cell to lower external osmolarity. Fps1p is an atypical member of the family, because the protein is much larger (669 amino acids) than most MIPs due to long hydrophilic extensions in both termini. We have shown previously that a short domain in the N-terminal extension of the protein is required for restricting glycerol transport through the channel (Tamás, M. J., Karlgren, S., Bill, R. M., Hedfalk, K., Allegri, L., Ferreira, M., Thevelein, J. M., Rydström, J., Mullins, J. G. L., and Hohmann, S. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 6337–6345). Deletion of the N-terminal domain results in an unregulated channel, loss of glycerol, and osmosensitivity. In this work we have investigated the role of the Fps1p C terminus (139 amino acids). A set of eight truncations has been constructed and tested in vivo in a yeast fps1Δ strain. We have performed growth tests, membrane localization following cell fractionation, and glycerol accumulation measurements as well as an investigation of the osmotic stress response. Our results show that the C-terminal extension is also involved in restricting transport through Fps1p. We have identified a sequence of 12 amino acids, residues 535–546, close to the sixth transmembrane domain. This element seems to be important for controlling Fps1p function. Similar to the N-terminal domain, the C-terminal domain is amphiphilic and has a potential to dip into the membrane.

Aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins comprise a large family (also called the MIP 1The abbreviations used are: MIP, major intrinsic protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TMD, transmembrane domain; aa, amino acid. family) of integral membrane proteins in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. MIP channels mediate transport of water and small neutral solutes and/or ions (1Hohmann S. Agre P. Nielsen S. Aquaporins. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001Google Scholar); hence, they are specific for osmotic regulation at different levels. The importance of properly functional and regulated aquaporins is illustrated by their suspected involvement in numerous disorders such as congestive heart failure, glaucoma, and brain edema (2Kozono D. Yasui M. King L.S. Agre P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 11: 1395-1399Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar). MIPs share a common topology with six transmembrane helical segments per subunit (3Heymann J.B. Engel A. News Physiol. Sci. 1999; 14: 187-193PubMed Google Scholar, 4Stroud R.M. Savage D. Miercke L.J. Lee J.K. Khademi S. Harries W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The two halves of the proteins show similarity to each other indicative of gene duplication during the evolution of MIP channels (4Stroud R.M. Savage D. Miercke L.J. Lee J.K. Khademi S. Harries W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Two NPA (Asn-Pro-Ala) boxes, located in loops B and E respectively, are highly conserved, indicating that these residues have major importance for structure and/or function (5Chrispeels M.J. Agre P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 421-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Based on high-resolution structures of bovine AQP1 and Escherichia coli GlpF, the NPA motifs were shown to form a crucial part of the channel (4Stroud R.M. Savage D. Miercke L.J. Lee J.K. Khademi S. Harries W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 6de Groot B.L. Grübmuller H. Science. 2001; 294: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 7Fu D.

Nature. 2001; 414: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Most MIPs are <300 aa long, but there are examples of much larger proteins in the family, mainly of eukaryotic origin. The larger size is primarily due to extended N- and C-terminal domains, the poor conservation in these domains suggesting their involvement in regulation rather than function. This is exemplified by Drosophila Bib and Fps1p, which have distinct N- and C-terminal extensions that are homologous neither to each other nor to other proteins in the data base. The strategy for accumulating compatible solutes in osmo-adaptation is evolutionarily well conserved in bacteria, archaea, and eukarya, although the solutes differ (9Kempf B. Bremer E. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 10Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar). A compatible solute increases the internal osmolarity and keeps proteins hydrated, leading to stabilization and protection of enzymes. Glycerol is the main compatible solute in growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. The production of glycerol is stimulated under hyper-osmotic stress, and accumulated glycerol is released when the external osmolarity drops (11Hohmann S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Fps1p is a glycerol facilitator that controls the cytoplasmic concentration of glycerol (12Luyten K. Albertyn J. Skibbe W.F. Prior B.A. Ramos J. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1360-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Mutants lacking Fps1p accumulate more intracellular glycerol, indicating that Fps1p is involved in glycerol efflux (12Luyten K. Albertyn J. Skibbe W.F. Prior B.A. Ramos J. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1360-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). This is further supported by the observation that fps1Δ mutants are sensitive to a hypo-osmotic shock and unable to export glycerol (13Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Glycerol influx via Fps1p has also been observed (12Luyten K. Albertyn J. Skibbe W.F. Prior B.A. Ramos J. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1360-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). However, because mutants lacking Fps1p do not show a growth defect on glycerol as the sole carbon source, the physiological role of Fps1p appears to be efflux rather than uptake. This indicates the presence of other systems for glycerol uptake (13Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 14Holst B. Lunde C. Lages F. Oliveira R. Lucas C. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 108-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fps1p consists of 669 amino acids and is localized to the plasma membrane of S. cerevisiae (13Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The protein has ∼30% identity to GlpF within the transmembrane core (between amino acids 250 and 530) (15Van Aelst L. Hohmann S. Zimmerman F.K. Jans A.W.H. Thevelein J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2095-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) but is one of the most divergent members of the MIP family. For instance, the two well conserved NPA motifs in loops B and E are NPS and NLA in Fps1p (16Bill R.M. Hedfalk K. Karlgren S. Mullins J.G. Rydström J. Hohmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36543-36549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Deletion of the hydrophilic N-terminal domain results in an unregulated channel, which, in turn, causes sensitivity to high osmolarity and glycerol overproduction (13Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Further investigations have shown that a domain of 12 amino acids close to the first transmembrane domain is crucial for controlling Fps1p function. Deletion or specific point mutations in this domain render the channel unregulated (17Tamás M.J. Karlgren S. Bill R.M. Hedfalk K. Allegri L. Ferreira M. Thevelein J.M. Rydström J. Mullins J.G.L. Hohmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6337-6345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study we have found that the Fps1p C terminus has a similar regulatory role in the channel's function. When deleted, cells become sensitive to hyper-osmotic conditions, indicating a role for the C terminus in restricting transport. Moreover, a domain of 12 residues next to the last transmembrane domain has been identified as important for proper regulation. Notably, sequence similarities are found between the important domains in each terminus, as well as a potential to dip into the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. Yeast Strain and Growth Conditions—The yeast strain used in this study is W303-1A (MATa leu2-3/112 ura3-1 trp1-1 his3-11/15 ade2-1can1-100 GAL SUC2 mal0) (18Thomas B.J. Rothstein R.

Yeast cells were routinely grown in medium containing 2% peptone and 1% yeast extract supplemented with 2% glucose as carbon source (YPD). Selection and growth of transformants carrying a replicating plasmid was performed in yeast nitrogen base medium (YNB) (20Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983Google Scholar) selecting for the LEU2 marker. Plasmid Constructions—The truncations were all based on the 2μLEU2 plasmid YEp181myc-FPS1, in which the c-myc epitope is attached to the carboxyl terminus of Fps1p (13Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). C1 and C2 were made from a vector PCR using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Applied Science). A SacII restriction site was introduced to allow linearization and religation. The ApaI-XbaI fragment, containing the truncated part, was subcloned into the original vector, and the region of interest was sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Plasmid C3 was constructed as described above, with the exception that the PCR fragment was combined with the two annealed primers containing the truncation. The two DNA pieces were combined by gap repair (21Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods in Enzymology: Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. 194. Academic Press, New York1991: 281-301Google Scholar) after cotransformation into yeast. The truncated part was subcloned and sequenced as described previously. C4–C7 were all made by gap repair; C4 on C2 linearized with SacII, and C5 on YEp181myc-FPS1 linearized with XbaI, as did C6 and C7 on C4. The truncated part of C4–C7 was sequenced as described above. C8 was made by a vector PCR, where the template was digested by DpnI before transformation of the PCR product to E. coli. The truncated part was subcloned and sequenced as described previously.

For a qualitative plate growth assay, cells were pregrown on YNB plates supplemented with 2% glucose and resuspended in the same medium to an OD600 of 0.3. 10 μl of the cell suspension, and three serial 1:10 dilutions were spotted on medium without sorbitol as a control and with 1 m sorbitol for a hyper-osmotic shock. For a hypo-osmotic shock, cells were pregrown on YNB plates supplemented with 2% glucose containing 1 m sorbitol and spotted on plates with sorbitol as control and without sorbitol for the hypo-osmotic shock. Plates were incubated at 30 °C, and growth was monitored after 2–3 days. For the more quantitative growth assay, cells were pregrown in YNB supplemented with 2% glucose for 16 h and diluted to an OD600 of 0.15 in the same medium. For hyper-osmotic conditions, cells from the preculture were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min at room temperature and resuspended in YNB and 1.5 m sorbitol supplemented with 2% glucose and with OD600 adjusted to 0.15. 350-μl cultures were assayed in a LabSystems Bioscreen C for 4–6 days. The observed OD values have been transformed to OD values that are corrected for non-linearity (22Warringer J. Blomberg A. Yeast. 2003; 20: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The average generation time, yield, and growth curve were calculated for three transformants from each construct. To test for the growth advantage of an unrestricted Fps1p channel on xylitol, plasmids were transformed into a gpd1Δ gpd2Δ strain, which is defective in glycerol production (19Ansell R. Granath K. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Adler L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2179-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). 2S. Karlgren, N. Petersson, R. M. Bill, and S. Hohmann, unpublished observations. Cells were pregrown on YNB plates supplemented with 2% glucose and resuspended in the same medium to an OD600 of 0.5. Five microliters of the cell suspension and three serial 1:10 dilutions were spotted on YNB plates supplemented with 2% glucose without and with 1 m xylitol, respectively. Membrane Preparation and Immunoblots—For membrane preparations, cells were grown in YNB supplemented with 2% glucose to an OD600 of 0.5–0.7, i.e. mid-log phase. The total membrane fraction was prepared as described previously (13Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured with a Bio-Rad DC protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. 10–400 μg of total protein was loaded in each lane and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond P, Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with PBS and 5% milk before incubation with the mouse monoclonal antibody anti-c-myc (clone 9E10, Roche) at a 1:400 dilution in PBS and 5% milk for 1.5 h. After a wash in blocking solution, the membrane was incubated with the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (Promega), at a 1:2500 dilution in PBS and 5% milk for 1 h. The membrane was washed in a blocking solution of PBS and 0.1% Tween, and finally PBS. Western blot membranes were developed using ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences), 0.12 ml/cm2, and visualized by the LAS-100 image reader (Fuji Film). Western blot analysis of Hog1p phosphorylation of Thr174 and Thr176 was prepared as described previously (24Karlgren S. Filipsson C. Mullins J.G.L. Bill R.M. Tamás M.J. Hohmann S. Eur. J.

Glycerol Accumulation Measurements—For glycerol accumulation measurements, cells were pregrown in YNB supplemented with 2% glucose to mid-log phase (OD600 of 0.5–0.7) and collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. At t = 0, cells were resuspended in medium with 1.5 m sorbitol. 2-ml aliquots were withdrawn at t = 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24 h for total and intracellular glycerol as well as dry weight determination. The two latter samples were filtered on Whatman GF/C filters. Filters for dry weight determination were dried at 80 °C for 16 h, and filters for intracellular glycerol measurements were soaked in 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7. Glycerol samples were heated at 100 °C for 10 min, and the glycerol concentration in the supernatant after centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min, room temperature) was determined using a Biomek 2000 laboratory robot (Beckman Coulter). Three transformants from each construct were tested, and the mean value ± S.E. (n = 3) was calculated for each time point. Truncations in the C terminus of Fps1p Confer an Osmosensitive Phenotype—A set of eight truncations in the C-terminal extension of Fps1p was constructed (Fig. 1B) and expressed in yeast cells lacking the endogenous FPS1 gene. Growth assays on plates revealed that all of the transformants grow like the control strains in YNB medium supplemented with 2% glucose. In medium with 1 m sorbitol, i.e. high osmolarity, growth was significantly diminished for cells expressing C1 (Fps1pΔ534–650). These transformants expressed Fps1p lacking the major part of the C terminus (Fig. 2A). The growth defect for C1 (Fps1pΔ534–650) was somewhat less pronounced than that observed previously for N-terminal truncations, of which the fps1-Δ1 (Fps1pΔ12–231) truncation causes the largest effect (Fig. 2B). In the latter case, the growth defect was shown to be due to an unregulated channel and the concomitant loss of glycerol from the cell (13Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Growth curves revealed that the increased osmosensitivity of C1 (Fps1pΔ534–650) was due to both a longer generation time and a lower yield of cells (Fig. 2B). Because survival under these conditions is dependent on proper Fps1p control, growth defects under hyper-osmotic conditions indicated an unregulated Fps1 protein. Hence, it appears that the C terminus is needed for proper channel regulation, analogous to previous observations for the N terminus. In an attempt to narrow down the region within the C terminus that is important for channel control, we have constructed a set of seven additional, overlapping mutations, C2-C8 (Fig. 1B). Plate growth assays show that, under hyperosmotic conditions, the growth of cells expressing C2 (Fps1pΔ577–650), C4 (Fps1pΔ546–650), C5 (Fps1pΔ649), and C8 (Fps1pΔ534–547) were not significantly different from the growth of cells expressing the wild type gene FPS1, whereas the growth of cells expressing C3 (Fps1pΔ534–578), C6 (Fps1pΔ534), and C7 (Fps1pΔ546) were affected to different extents (Fig. 2A). To analyze the functionality of the C-terminal truncations, the expression level and the membrane localization of each mutant were determined. Cellular fractionation demonstrated that most of the truncated proteins were detected in the membrane fraction (Fig. 2C). Large truncations in the C terminus resulted in a low level of Fps1p in the membrane. This was especially pronounced for the C6 (Fps1pΔ534) and C7 (Fps1pΔ546) constructs, in which case the amount was very low or below detection in the total membrane fraction. One explanation for this apparently low expression might be that the myc tag is less accessible when located closer to the transmembrane domain. Even the apparently poorly expressed or poorly detectable C6 (Fps1pΔ534) and C7 (Fps1pΔ546) constructs were functional. This is illustrated by the ability to complement the hypo-osmotic shock sensitivity of the fps1Δ mutant, suggesting sufficient glycerol efflux to allow survival and growth. In this test, cells transformed with FPS1 or any of the truncated variants had ∼10 times improved growth compared with cells transformed with the vector (Fig. 2A). C-terminal Truncations of Fps1p Confer a Defect in Glycerol Accumulation—To investigate the reason for the hyper-osmosensitivity conferred by the C-terminal truncations, we monitored the accumulation of glycerol under hyper-osmotic conditions. As shown in Fig. 3A, cells expressing the wild type FPS1 gene rapidly accumulated intracellularly produced glycerol under hyper-osmotic conditions. As shown previously, expression of fps1-Δ1 (Fps1pΔ12–231) resulted in poor accumulation due to a high channel activity (13Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Deletion of the major part of the C terminus (C1, Fps1pΔ534–650) also resulted in an inefficient accumulation of intracellular glycerol, but the effect was somewhat less pronounced, consistent with growth data (Fig. 2B). Retaining 43 aa (C2, Fps1pΔ577–650) close to the last TMD resulted in an accumulation profile comparable with wild type, although deletion of just these residues (C3, Fps1pΔ534–578) resulted in an intermediate glycerol accumulation capacity. Keeping a stretch of 12 aa close to the last TMD (C4, Fps1pΔ546–650 and C7, Fps1pΔ546-) resulted in an initial accumulation capacity comparable with that of wild-type Fps1p, whereas deletion of these 12 aa (C6, Fps1pΔ534) gave rise to as poor an initial accumulation as for fps1-Δ1 (Fps1pΔ12–231) (Fig. 3A). The profiles of intracellular accumulation (Fig. 3A) and the total glycerol production (Fig. 3B) were in good agreement with the growth data (Fig. 2A). This means that a poor growth rate at high osmolarity was associated with reduced glycerol accumulation and higher levels of total glycerol produced. With glycerol overproduction, the cell attempts to compensate for the poor ability to retain glycerol in the cell. We noted that C6 (Fps1pΔ534-), the largest truncation, caused similar poor glycerol accumulation and high total glycerol production as C1 (Fps1pΔ534–650). Taken together, the glycerol accumulation and production profiles confirmed that the truncations C1 (Fps1pΔ534–650), C3 (Fps1pΔ534–578), C6 (Fps1pΔ534-), and C7 (Fps1pΔ546-) render Fps1p unregulated to different extents. C-terminal Truncations of Fps1p Affect the Profile of Osmostress Signaling—To examine whether C-terminal truncations gave rise to an unregulated Fps1p, we monitored the profile of high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway activation in cells expressing C1 (Fps1pΔ534–650) and C2 (Fps1pΔ577–650). High osmolarity mediates phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase Hog1p, which, in turn, stimulates expression of genes encoding enzymes in glycerol biosynthesis (11Hohmann S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). The defect in glycerol accumulation conferred by an unregulated, N-terminally truncated Fps1p has previously been shown to be associated with extended phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase Hog1p, which is a good indicator of the status in the cell.2 Such sustained phosphorylation was also observed in cells expressing C-terminally truncated Fps1p (Fig. 4). The period of Hog1p phosphorylation was prolonged in cells expressing the C1 (Fps1pΔ534–650) truncation, whereas the phosphorylation profile of cells expressing C2 (Fps1pΔ577–650) was similar to that of cells expressing the wild type FPS1 gene. These results are consistent with the growth and glycerol accumulation data that demonstrated a strong effect of the long C1 (Fps1pΔ534–650) truncation. Hence, the osmostress signaling profile confirmed that truncations of the C terminus render Fps1p unregulated. C-terminal Truncation of Fps1p Confers Xylitol Uptake—A sensitive assay for an unregulated Fps1p is its ability to confer growth to a gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant on medium containing a high concentration of xylitol.2 In contrast to sorbtiol, xylitol can be taken up via an unregulated Fps1p channel and act as an internal osmolyte. The gpd1Δ gpd2Δ double mutant is unable to produce glycerol and is, for this reason, very sensitive to high osmolarity, for instance with 1 m xylitol. Expression of an unregulated Fps1p allows inflow of xylitol to the cell, relieving the osmotic stress and allowing growth. We tested the C-terminal truncations in this system and found that truncations C1 (Fps1pΔ534–650), C3 (Fps1pΔ534–578), C6 (Fps1pΔ534-), and C7 (Fps1pΔ546-) conferred growth of the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant on xylitol (Fig. 5A). This result is consistent with the notion that C-terminally truncated Fps1p is unregulated. In this work we report a novel function for the C-terminal domain of Fps1p, an atypical member of the MIP family. Cells expressing a C-terminally truncated Fps1p show sensitivity to hyper-osmotic conditions, which indicates a role for the C terminus in channel regulation. Expression of this channel results in delayed intracellular glycerol accumulation under hyperosmotic conditions, which is compensated by glycerol overproduction. The fact that truncations of the Fps1p C terminus cause an unregulated channel is further supported by prolonged phosphorylation of Hog1p as well as improved growth of the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant on xylitol as a result of expressing Fps1p lacking its C terminus. The difference in growth sensitivity to high omsolarity, glycerol accumulation, total glycerol production, and phosphorylation profiles of Hog1p, as well as growth of the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ mutant on xylitol caused by truncations C1 (Fps1pΔ534–650) and C2 (Fps1pΔ577–650), points to an important regulatory domain close to the last TMD. Deletion of just this domain of 43 aa (C3, Fps1pΔ534–578) gives rise to a partially regulated channel, as illustrated by an intermediate capacity to accumulate intracellular glycerol (Fig. 3A) as well as improved growth on xylitol in the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ background (Fig. 5A). This activity resulted in an intermediate sensitivity to hyper-osmotic conditions for transformants expressing this construct (Fig. 2A). This might indicate that other parts of the C-terminal extension partly compensate for this critical function when moved closer to TMD6. The important domain could be shortened from 43 to 12 amino acids without affecting function; C4 (Fps1pΔ546–650) transformants were also not significantly sensitive to hyper-osmotic conditions (Fig. 2A). The C4 (Fps1pΔ546–650)-encoded protein seemed to form functional glycerol efflux channels (Fig. 2A) with glycerol accumulation profiles similar to those for wild type Fps1p (Fig. 3). An additional truncation (C5, Fps1pΔ649-) was made to test whether the most distal 20 aa, which were retained in all constructs, could form a regulatory domain. As seen in Figs. 2A and 5A, C5 (Fps1pΔ649-) did not confer any sensitivity to hyper-osmotic conditions, seemed to form functional glycerol efflux channels when expressed in the fps1Δ strain, and did not confer improved growth on xylitol when expressed in the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ background. Because the last 20 aa were not crucial for proper regulation, it suggested that the difference between a regulated and an unregulated Fps1p could be explained by the properties of the 12 residues next to the last TMD (Fig. 1B). In agreement with this hypothesis, C6 (Fps1pΔ534-) caused growth sensitivity to severe hyper-osmotic conditions (1.5 m sorbitol), whereas C7 (Fps1pΔ546-) did not (Fig. 5B). When stressed with 1.0 m sorbitol, the effect as well as the difference between the two constructs was less pronounced, which might be explained by a very low level of production (Fig. 2). Both C6 (Fps1pΔ534-)- and C7 (Fps1pΔ546-)-expressing strains seemed to export glycerol upon a hypo-osmotic shock indicative of a functional channel (Fig. 2). A clear difference was observed for C6 (Fps1pΔ534-) and C7 (Fps1pΔ546-) in the intracellular as well as the total glycerol accumulation (Fig. 3, A and B), verifying the apparently crucial role of these 12 residues (535HESPVNWSLPVY546) in channel regulation. Furthermore, expression of C6 (Fps1pΔ534-) in the gpd1Δ gpd2Δ strain resulted in improved growth in the presence of xylitol, indicating that this protein is an unrestricted channel (Fig. 5A). Some xylitol uptake was also seen for C7 (Fps1pΔ546-), supporting the notion that this protein does not have full regulatory capacity despite the fact that it is equipped with the important domain for regulation. However, simple deletion of the latter domain of 12 aa (C8, Fps1pΔ534–547) did not affect channel regulation (Figs. 2A and 5A); but it is not unreasonable that, for C8 (Fps1pΔ534–547) as well as for C3 (Fps1pΔ534–578), the bulk of the remaining C-terminal sequence compensates for the truncation. In conclusion, our results indicate that a short C-terminal sequence of 12 residues close to the last transmembrane domain has an important role in channel regulation. This domain shows similarities to the N-terminal restriction domain and has a potential to dip into the membrane. The C-terminal 12 residues long domain is 535HESPVNWSLPVY546 (Fig. 1A). The reverse NXXL motif, LXXN, was previously found in the corresponding N-terminal domain, 225LYQNPQTPTVLP236 (Fig. 6), in which the leucine and the asparagine were shown to be important for proper channel regulation (17Tamás M.J. Karlgren S. Bill R.M. Hedfalk K. Allegri L. Ferreira M. Thevelein J.M. Rydström J. Mullins J.G.L. Hohmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6337-6345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Both regulatory N- and the C-terminal domains are proline-rich, suggesting that the hydrophilic domains have a structural influence on the protein. The fact that the N terminus restricts transport through Fps1p and has an amphiphilic character suggests that it dips into the membrane (17Tamás M.J. Karlgren S. Bill R.M. Hedfalk K. Allegri L. Ferreira M. Thevelein J.M. Rydström J. Mullins J.G.L. Hohmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6337-6345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The same may be valid for the C-terminal sequence, where the leucine and valine residues may have a major influence on membrane insertion. We have previously postulated that either of the glutamine residues (Gln227 or Gln230) of the N-terminal regulatory domain of Fps1p may interact with His350 of loop B, close to the extramembrane face (17Tamás M.J. Karlgren S. Bill R.M. Hedfalk K. Allegri L. Ferreira M. Thevelein J.M. Rydström J. Mullins J.G.L. Hohmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6337-6345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For the C-terminal regulatory domain, an equivalent possibility is Glu536 interacting with Arg363 of loop B, again at a shallow depth in the pore. This would allow Asn540 to come into close proximity with the NP motif of loop B and, possibly, also the NP motif of the N-terminal regulatory domain. It is possible that the N-terminal and C-terminal regulatory domains permanently lie in different parts of the pore and associate with different parts of loop B or, alternatively, that they may flip in and out of the membrane independently according to conditions. Thus, conformational changes may be responsible for fine regulation of pore activity. These hypotheses are currently examined through the construction of a series of point mutations and a genetic screen. The activity of a number of eukaryotic MIPs has been shown to be regulated by diverse mechanisms such as pH (25Nemeth-Cahalan K.L. Hall J.E. J. Biol.

In conclusion, there is considerable diversity within the MIP family, and a common theme for a regulatory mechanism is lacking. The expression of Fps1p is not regulated by a hyper-osmotic shock, although it may be affected by long-term adaptation to osmotic changes (13Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). A unique regulatory mechanism has been presented for Fps1p activated by shifts in external osmolarity in which the long hydrophilic extensions in both termini have been suggested to be crucial for control of the channel function. The regulatory mechanism is not yet understood, even though several possible explanations have been excluded (13Tamás M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 34de Jesus Ferreira M.C. Bao X. Laize V. Hohmann S. Curr. Genet. 2001; 40: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is believed that the mechanism of regulation is intrinsic to the protein and involves integral structural rearrangement. Despite the high identity found between Fps1p and other MIPs, especially GlpF, there is no known candidate within the family that has the same characteristics regarding the response to osmotic changes. The N- and the C-terminal regions found to be of major importance in controlling the Fps1p function are relatively short and, in both cases, they are located close to TMD1 and TMD6, respectively. When these domains are deleted, the Fps1p channel cannot restrict transport upon high osmolarity. The Fps1p N terminus has been demonstrated to restrict glycerol transport, both under normal and hyper-osmotic conditions. A similar function for the C terminus is indeed suggested by the present results. Point mutations within the C-terminal domain identified in this study are being constructed to evaluate the mechanism of regulation, and a pure Fps1p (23Hedfalk K. Bill R.M. Hohmann S. Rydström J. Hohmann S. Nielsen S. Molecular Biology and Physiology of Water and Solute Transport.

The latter activity requires an intact transmembrane (TM) domain; however, the mechanism remains unclear. Vpu forms ion channels, an activity linked to the TM domain and envisioned to arise by oligomerization. The precise number of Vpu monomers that structure the channel is not yet known. To address this issue, we have synthesized tetrameric and pentameric proteins consisting of a carrier template to which four or five peptides corresponding to the TM domain of Vpu are attached.

However, there is a growing body of evidence indicating that Vpu function is vital for in vivo replication and contributes to the virulence of HIV-1 infections in humans (4Bour S. Strebel K. Microb. Infect. 2003; 5: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Vpu consists of 81 amino acids and is a type III membrane protein with one transmembrane domain and two amphipathic helices in its cytoplasmic domain (5Marassi F.M. Ma C. Gratkowski H. Straus S.K. Strebel K. Oblatt-Montal M. Montal M. Opella S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14336-14341Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 6Montal M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Two distinct functions of the protein are associated with different structural domains (5Marassi F.M. Ma C. Gratkowski H.

Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Maldarell F. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 809-819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vpu enhances the degradation of CD4·gp160 complexes in infected cells, thereby helping to produce gp41 and gp120 from proteolytic cleavage of gp160. Gp120 is needed for subsequent incorporation into next-generation virus particles (8Willey R.L. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 226-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD4·gp160 degradation is conferred by the cytoplasmic domain after serine phosphorylation at positions 52 and 56. Vpu has a second major function in facilitating the release of virus particles from infected cells, a process that is phosphorylation independent, occurs in post-ER compartments, and involves the TM domain (9Strebel K. Klimkait T. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3784-3791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of Vpu, the viruses remain associated with the host cell and eventually become cytotoxic (10Klimkait T. Strebel K. Hoggan M.D. Martin M.A. Orenstein J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 621-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This second function of Vpu has been related to its ability to oligomerize and form ion channels (11Schubert U. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Oblatt-Montal M. Henklein P. Strebel K. Montal M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), similar to the influenza virus M2 ion-channel protein (12Lamb R.A.

Thus, Vpu not only increases the levels of envelope protein that reach the cell surface but also increases the secretion of virions containing this protein. A significant amount of effort has been devoted to determining the structure of Vpu. A variety of truncated and full-length polypeptides based on the sequence of Vpu have been prepared by expression in E. coli and by solid-phase peptide synthesis to study the secondary and tertiary structure of this protein (5Marassi F.M.

Most recently, a high resolution three-dimensional structure of the Vpu protein transmembrane domain after solubilization with an oligolysine tag named Vpu2–30+ has been solved (14Park S. Mrse A. Nevzorov A. Mesleh A. Oblatt-Montal M. Montal M. Opella S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 409-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition, multiple constraints on tilt angles and overall topology were determined by solid-state and solution NMR spectroscopy of Vpu and its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, respectively (5Marassi F.M. Ma C. Gratkowski H. Straus S.K. Strebel K. Oblatt-Montal M. Montal M. Opella S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14336-14341Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 16Henklein P.

Soc. 2004; 126: 2439-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Vpu dimerizes/oligomerizes readily in vitro and in vivo, and this oligomerization is required for channel formation (11Schubert U. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Oblatt-Montal M. Henklein P. Strebel K. Montal M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 18Maldarelli F. Chen M.Y. Willey R.L. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5056-5061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that a pentameric bundle is the minimum array for Vpu to form a stable helical bundle with ion-channel properties (19Moore P.B. Zhong Q. Husslein T. Klein M.L.

However, no direct experimental information is available regarding the oligomerization state of the Vpu protein or its TM domain. Given that Vpu is a potential drug target, it is critical to understand the oligomerization state of the assembled protein for structure-based drug design and lead optimization (23Ewart G.D. Mills K. Cox G.B. Gage P.W. Eur. Biophys. J. 2002; 31: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our strategy was to deduce the preferred oligomeric state of Vpu in vivo by taking advantage of the observation that ionchannel conductances are tightly dependent on pore size and thus on the oligomeric state. Vpu exhibits ion-channel activity when reconstituted into lipid bilayers and forms discrete ionconductive channels of heterogeneous conductance. The most frequent event has a single channel conductance of 22 ± 3 pS, but in addition, a second discrete channel conductance of 12 ± 3 pS occurs (5Marassi F.M. Ma C. Gratkowski H. Straus S.K.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Truncated forms such as Vpu2–51 and Vpu2–37 show similar activity, but the observed conductances are slightly higher for Vpu2–51 (26 ± 3 pS) (5Marassi F.M. Ma C. Gratkowski H. Straus S.K. Strebel K.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Shorter segments consisting only of the TM domain exhibit even larger conductances (11Schubert U. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Oblatt-Montal M. Henklein P. Strebel K. Montal M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 14Park S. Mrse A. Nevzorov A. Mesleh A. Oblatt-Montal M. Montal M. Opella S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 409-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Here, we report the use of the template-assembled synthetic protein (TASP) strategy (24Mutter M. Vuilleumier S.A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1989; 28: 535-554Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar) to assemble defined tetrameric and pentameric Vpu oligomers consisting of the TM domain of Vpu (amino acid residues 2–31) to examine their ion-conducting properties and to compare the observed conductances to those of wild type Vpu proteins and truncated peptides. TASPs have been used previously to determine the oligomerization state of transmembrane domains of proteins such as the nicotinic acetylcholine and glycine receptors (25Iwamoto T. Grove A.

A. 1991; 88: 6418-6422Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and to generate synthetic channels of defined oligomeric state (31De E. Chaloin L. Heitz A. Mery J. Molle G. Heitz F. J. Pept. Sci. 2001; 7: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32Grove A. Mutter M. Rivier J. Montal M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 5919-5924Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the TASP approach, peptide building blocks are covalently linked to a topological template that directs folding toward a particular three-dimensional structure. The template molecules used in this study are identical in sequence to constructs employed by Montal and co-workers (25Iwamoto T. Grove A. Montal M.O. Montal M. Tomich J.M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1994; 43: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Oblatt-Montal M. Iwamoto T. Tomich J.M. Montal M.

A. 1990; 87: 6929-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) to drive acetylcholine receptor peptides to tetrameric and pentameric states. The synthetic challenge of assembling these TASP molecules lay in the hydrophobicity of the Vpu TM domain and made the supply of purified Vpu peptide a limiting factor for the synthesis. This problem was overcome by attaching a polyethylene glycol-polyamide (PPO) auxiliary (Scheme 1) to the free C terminus of the polypeptides, which could be removed after successful TASP assembly. Whereas unmodified TASP was not purifiable, the attachment of the auxiliary significantly increased the solubility of the peptide constituents and made possible TASP synthesis and purification. Functional reconstitution of the TASPs in lipid bilayers showed that both TASP molecules folded into an active conformation and exhibited ion-channel activity with distinct properties. The single channel properties measured for the pentameric TASP resemble those determined for similar Vpu peptides that were not linked to a template molecule. The synthesis of the peptide and template building blocks of T4Vpu and T5Vpu is described in detail in supplemental Figs. 1-4. The transmembrane peptide segment (Aoaa)Vpu-(2–31) (sequence in single-letter code: Aoaa-QPIQI AIVAL VVAII IAIVV WSIVI IEYRK) was synthesized on an stryrene-divinylbenzene resin carrying an OCH2-PAM linker modified with the PPO auxiliary (33Rose K. Vizzavona J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 7034-7038Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and a thioester-generating linker using an in situ neutralization protocol for machine-assisted t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry (34Camarero J. Muir T. Curr. Prot. Protein Sci. 1999; 18.4: 1-21Google Scholar, 35Schnölzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B.H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The template was synthesized manually using Fmoc chemistry (36Fields C.G. Lloyd D.H. Macdonald R.L. Otteson K.M. Noble R.L. Pept. Res. 1991; 4: 95-101PubMed Google Scholar) on a styrene-divinylbenzene resin carrying a Rink linker (Novabiochem, San Diego, CA) as described previously (37Kochendoerfer G.G. Tack J.M. Cressman S. Bioconj. Chem. 2002; 13: 474-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Oxime-forming Chemoselective Ligation—A 1.5-fold molar excess (aminooxyacetyl) peptide to pyruvic acid group on the template) of (Aoaa)Vpu-(2–31) was added to a solution of the template in Buffer B (isopropyl alcohol containing 24% acetonitrile, 20% trifluoroethanol, 8% water, and 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid). After an 18-h reaction time at room temperature, the volume of the reaction mixture was reduced by 90% using a SpeedVac and neat trifluoroacetic acid was added until the initial volume was reestablished. A 15-fold molar excess of Hg(OAc)2 over (Aoaa)Vpu-(2–31) was added to hydrolyze the C-terminal PPO thioester. After completion, 5% β-mercaptoethanol was added to scavenge Hg2+ ions from the solution. Reactants and products were separated by preparative reversed-phase HPLC with a linear gradient of 60–100% Buffer B versus 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid in 50 min. Fractions containing the desired material were identified by SDS-PAGE and ES-MS. Circular Dichroism Spectrometry—CD spectra were acquired at a protein concentration of 0.6 mg/ml with a JASCO-J700 CD spectrometer at 20 °C between 190 and 250 nm in 0.4-nm increments (bandwidth: 1-nm dwell time: 2 s, averaged over three acquisitions). Folding and Reconstitution in Lipid Bilayers—HPLC fractions containing the desired material were transferred into TFE by evaporative solvent exchange using a SpeedVac to a final peptide concentration of 0.8 mg/ml. The pH was adjusted to 7 with 1 m NaOH. Lipid bilayers were formed at the tip of patch pipettes by apposition of two monolayers (5Marassi F.M. Ma C. Gratkowski H. Straus S.K. Strebel K.

Lipid monolayers were spread from a lipid solution in hexane at 1 mg/ml. The lipids used were diphytanoylphosphatidylethanolamine and diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine (1:1) (Avanti, Alabaster, AL). Purified TASPs in TFE solution were added in 2–5-μl aliquots to the aqueous subphase (0.5 m KCl and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) after bilayer formation. Acquisition and analysis of single channel currents at 24 ± 2 °C were as described previously (5Marassi F.M. Ma C. Gratkowski H. Straus S.K. Strebel K. Oblatt-Montal M. Montal M. Opella S.J. Proc.

Currents were filtered at 1 kHz, and pClamp 9.0 was used for data processing and analysis. Single channel conductance (γ) was calculated from Gaussian fits to currents histograms. The channel open (τo) and closed (τc) lifetimes were calculated from exponential fits to probability density functions. Openings with τo ≤0.3 ms were ignored. The data reported include statistical analysis of >6000 single channel openings. Chemical Protein Synthesis—Assembly of T4Vpu and T5Vpu consisted of three steps: 1) assembly of building blocks; 2) purification; and 3) chemoselective ligation. The membrane-spanning domain of the Vpu protein (amino acids 2–31) was synthesized by standard t-butoxycarbonyl synthesis, and aminooxyacetic acid was coupled to the N terminus of the peptide in a final step. Deprotection and cleavage of the peptide was performed in liquid hydrogen fluoride using Fmoc-Leu-OH and aminooxyacetic acid as scavengers to prevent undesired cleavage adducts (38Nishio H. Nishiuchi Y. Inui T. Yoshizawa-Kumagaye K. Terutoshi K. Tetrahedron Lett. 2000; 41: 6839-6842Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Using this approach, the modified target peptide could be obtained in satisfactory purity as judged from the analytical HPLC trace of the crude cleavage mixture (60%, data not shown). Initial trials showed that the peptide could not be purified, and the TASP could not be assembled when the transmembrane peptide was synthesized on a standard peptide linker because of its high hydrophobicity and tendency to aggregate after cleavage from the resin support. This problem was overcome by the transient introduction of a PPO auxiliary (see Scheme 1 for structure) at the C terminus of the peptide via a thioester linkage. This auxiliary facilitated handling of the peptide and thus allowed purification and subsequent ligation of the peptide building blocks. The template peptides were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc strategy and purified using standard procedures (36Fields C.G. Lloyd D.H. Macdonald R.L. Otteson K.M. Noble R.L. Pept. Res. 1991; 4: 95-101PubMed Google Scholar). TASP molecules T4Vpu and T5Vpu were then assembled by joining the four or five unprotected purified (Aoaa)Vpu-(2–31) peptides to the respective purified template molecules (Fig. 1A). The (Aoaa)Vpu-(2–31) peptide was used in an 1.5-fold excess over every available pyruvic acid site on the template, and the reactions were carried out in Buffer B at pH 2. Prior to biophysical analysis, the auxiliary could be conveniently removed using conditions under which the TASP construct was soluble. This reaction left each of the Vpu-(2–31) peptides constituting the TASP molecules with a free α-carboxylic acid at its C terminus for each subunit (a total of five charges for T5Vpu and a total of four charges for T4Vpu). Whereas only the assembly of T5Vpu is described in detail (see below), T4Vpu was assembled similarly and product yields and purity were comparable (see supplemental Figs. 1–4). HPLC traces monitoring the progress of the oximation reaction are shown in Fig. 1B. At t = 0, only a dominant peak at 19.2 min is observed, corresponding to unreacted (Aoaa)Vpu-(2–31) (Fig. 1B, top panel). Oximation results in a shift to later retention times after each subsequent addition of transmembrane peptide to the template, and the desired product T5Vpu elutes at 23.8 min. After 7 h, additional (Aoaa)Vpu-(2–31) peptide was added to drive the reaction to completion. Template molecules carrying 1, 2, or 3 (Aoaa)Vpu-(2–31) peptides were identified in the HPLC chromatograms, but template molecules carrying 4 or 5 (Aoaa)Vpu-(2–31) peptides were not resolved. The reaction was not stopped until fully assembled T5Vpu was found exclusively in the peak eluting at 23.8 min as determined by SDS-PAGE and ES-MS. Typically, after 24 h, the HPLC peak at 23.8 min consists exclusively of T5Vpu (Fig. 1B, center panel). The electrospray mass spectrum and charge reconstruct of a pure fraction (Fig. 1C, top and center panels) of T5Vpu show a molecular mass of 22,742 ± 2 Da (calculated molecular mass of 22,739 Da (average isotope composition including the PPO auxiliary)). Unfortunately, the assembled TASP molecules did not ionize very efficiently in the mass spectrometer, and the resulting spectra were of relatively poor quality. By contrast, previously synthesized TASPs of membrane peptides were not characterized by mass spectrometry or any other high resolution mass determination technique (25Iwamoto T. Grove A. Montal M.O. Montal M. Tomich J.M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1994; 43: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Oblatt-Montal M. Iwamoto T. Tomich J.M. Montal M.

Sci. 2001; 7: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The corresponding molecular mass of T4Vpu found by ES-MS was 18,182 ± 2 Da (expected molecular mass of 18,279 Da, average isotope composition). After completion, the volume of the reaction mixture was reduced by a factor of 10 using a SpeedVac and then readjusted to the starting volume by the addition of neat trifluoroacetic acid. The solvent exchange was necessary to prevent aggregation/precipitation and allow purification of the more hydrophobic TASP molecule following auxiliary removal. Quantitative hydrolysis of the thioester bond to the auxiliary was achieved by the addition of Hg(OAc)2 and confirmed by MALDI-TOF after purification of T5Vpu using a C4-semipreparative column. The reaction mixture after PPO removal showed a major band in the SDS-PAGE gel corresponding to T5Vpu without the PPO auxiliary (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). A less prominent band at a higher molecular mass remained and was the result of TASP molecules carrying an additional Vpu peptide. The desired TASP construct was purified from reactants and side products by preparative reversed-phase HPLC, and the purified fractions were pooled according to SDS-PAGE analysis and characterized by reversed-phase HPLC, MALDI-TOF, and SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE gel of purified fractions of T5Vpu (Fig. 1C, bottom panel) confirms the correct assembly and homogeneity of the sample. The reversed-phase HPLC retention time of T5Vpu without the PPO auxiliaries shifts toward the right by 2 min, and the chromatogram indicates high (93%) purity of the target molecule (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). No ES-MS spectra could be obtained from the final samples. However, MALDI-TOF-spectra of purified T5Vpu showed a peak of 18,859 ± 20 Da (calculated molecular mass of 18,842 Da, see supplemental Figs. 1–4) compared with the mass found for PPO-modified T5Vpu of 22,739 Da. The high resolution mass analysis thus unequivocally demonstrates that the correct pentameric and tetrameric channel proteins were assembled. The overall yield of the assembly, auxiliary removal, and purification process was 5% based on the limiting amount of template molecule. This yield allowed for the assembly of milligram quantities of each TASP molecule for subsequent folding and electrophysiological characterization. Folding and Secondary Structure—The secondary structure of the TASPs in neat TFE at pH 7 was assessed by CD spectroscopy. Both proteins displayed a CD spectrum with a maximum at 198 nm and two minima at 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 2A) as expected for a helical peptide bundle (Fig. 2B). Solubilization into detergent micelles or lipid-containing aqueous buffers proved inadequate, and mixtures of TFE/chloroform showed less helicity than pure TFE. These CD spectral features could not be compared with those of free (Aoaa)Vpu-(2–31) peptide in TFE because the free peptide without the C-terminal PPO auxiliary could not be transferred into TFE at concentrations sufficient for collecting CD data. However, the (Aoaa)Vpu-(2–31)PPO peptide was efficiently transferred into TFE and the corresponding CD spectrum indicated a helical secondary structure as well. Single Channel Properties of T5Vpu Reconstituted in Lipid Bilayers—Purified T5Vpu reconstituted in lipid bilayers forms discrete ion-conductive channels of heterogeneous conductance. The channels appear in bursts of activity interspersed between periods of rare or no activity. During the bursts, the channels exhibit a high propensity to reside in the open state. At pH 7.4, the most frequent channels detected exhibit a γ of 76 ± 5 pS (Figs. 2C and 3A) in 0.5 m KCl. A downward deflection indicates channel opening (V = -100 mV). In addition to the primary conductance, a second discrete channel conductance of 45 ± 4 pS occurred at high frequency (Figs. 2C and 3D). The occurrence of these two channel activities is in"

(1992) Science 257, 967–971) to identify genes up-regulated after long term potentiation (LTP) induction in the hippocampus of awake adult rats. In situ hybridization confirmed the differential expression of five independently amplified clones representing two distinct transcripts, cl13/19/90 and cl95/96. Neither cl13/19/90 nor cl95/96 showed significant sequence homology to known transcripts (mRNA or expressed sequence tag) or to the mouse or human genome. However, comparison with the rat genome revealed that they are localized to a predicted intron of the phosphodiesterase Pde10A gene. cl13/19/90 and cl95/96 are likely to be part of the Pde10A primary transcript as, using reverse transcriptase-PCR, we could specifically amplify distinct introns of the Pde10A primary transcript, and in situ hybridization demonstrated that a subset of Pde10A splice variants are also up-regulated after LTP induction. These results indicate that amplification of a primary transcript can faithfully report gene activity and that differential display can be used to identify differential expression of RNA species other than mRNA. In transiently transfected Cos7 cells, Pde10A3 reduces the atrial natriuretic peptide-induced elevation in cGMP levels without affecting basal cGMP levels.

There is strong evidence indicating that LTP constitutes a neural substrate for some forms of learning and memory (3Martin S.J. Morris R.G. Hippocampus. 2002; 12: 609-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar): (i) both LTP and learning depend on the activation of similar signal transduction cascades (4Izquierdo I. Medina J.H. Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 1997; 68: 285-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar); (ii) animal models in which the induction of LTP is impaired are generally also impaired in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory (see, e.g., Refs. 5Silva A.J.

Science. 1999; 284: 1805-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar); (iii) mice that show enhanced LTP also show enhanced learning and memory (10Migaud M. Charlesworth P. Dempster M. Webster L.C. Watabe A.M. Makhinson M. He Y. Ramsay M.F. Morris R.G. Morrison J.H. O'Dell T.J. Grant S.G. Nature. 1998; 396: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 11Tang Y.P. Shimizu E.

LeDoux J.E. Nature. 1997; 390: 604-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar).Another point of congruence is the requirement for de novo RNA and protein synthesis both for the formation of long term memory (13Davis H.P. Squire L.R. Psychol. Bull. 1984; 96: 518-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 14Tully T. Preat T. Boynton S.C. Del Vecchio M. Cell. 1994; 79: 35-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) and the late stage of LTP, L-LTP (15Krug M. Lossner B. Ott T. Brain Res. Bull. 1984; 13: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 16Nguyen P.V. Kandel E.R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3189-3198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Frey U. Morris R.G. Nature. 1997; 385: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). The observation that L-LTP requires de novo RNA and protein synthesis has led to a search for genes that are modulated by LTP. To date, several transcripts have been identified and include both transcription factors (e.g. Zif268) (18Cole A.J. Saffen D.W. Baraban J.M. Worley P.F.

Neuroscience. 2003; 117: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition to de novo RNA and protein synthesis, LTP may also be associated with the induction of novel splice isoforms (27Rodger J. Davis S. Laroche S. Mallet J. Hicks A. J.

Moreover, expression of LTP-modulated transcripts such as Zif268 and Arc/Arg3.1 appears to be both associated with specific learning tasks (36Guzowski J.F. McNaughton B.L. Barnes C.A. Worley P.F.

These proteins and their associated biological functions therefore are beginning to provide an insight into the molecular bases of the long term changes underlying synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation.In this study we employed differential display of expressed mRNAs (1Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4688) Google Scholar) to identify genes induced by LTP in the awake animal. Although differential display is primarily aimed to identify changes in expression levels of mRNA, our analysis highlighted the ability of this technique to identify differential expression of other RNA species. Using in situ hybridization, we were able to confirm the differential expression of five clones that represent two independent transcripts, cl13/19/90 and cl95/96. We provide evidence demonstrating these clones are part of the primary transcript (i.e. RNA prior to excision of introns) of Pde10A, a gene encoding a cGMP phosphodiesterase (40Soderling S.H.

Our results argue for a role of the cGMP/cGMP-dependent kinase (cGK) pathway in long term synaptic plasticity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIn Vivo Recordings—Eighty-five male Sprague-Dawley (Iffa Credo, France) rats weighing between 300 and 350 g were prepared for chronic unilateral recording in the dentate gyrus as described previously (44Laroche S. Doyere V. Bloch V. Neuroscience. 1989; 28: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Detailed experimental protocols used in this study for the induction and recording of LTP in the awake rat have been described (25Genin A. French P.J. Doyere V. Davis S. Errington M.L. Maroun M. Stean T. Truchet B. Webber M. Wills T. Richter-Levin G. Sanger G. Hunt S.P. Mallet J. Laroche S. Bliss T.V.P. O'Connor V. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the EU directive (86/609/EEC) and the French National Committee (87/848).Differential Display—Differential display experiments were performed as described (25Genin A. French P.J. Doyere V. Davis S. Errington M.L. Maroun M. Stean T. Truchet B. Webber M. Wills T. Richter-Levin G. Sanger G. Hunt S.P. Mallet J. Laroche S. Bliss T.V.P. O'Connor V. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The primers that led to the differential amplification of cl13/19/90 and cl95/96 were: Cl19, ACGACTCACTATAGGGC(T)12CG and ACAATTTCACACAGGACGACTCCAAG; Cl13, ACGACTCACTATAGGGC(T)12CG and ACAATTTCACACAGGACGACTCCAAG; Cl90, ACGACTCACTATAGGGC(T)12AG and ACAATTTCACACAGGACGACTCCAAG; Cl95, ACGACTCACTATAGGGC(T)12CA and ACAATTTCACACAGGACTTTCTACCC; and Cl96, ACGACTCACTATAGGGC(T)12CA and ACAATTTCACACAGGACTTTCTACCC.Electroconvulsive Shock (ECS)—ECS was induced in 20 rats following light halothane anesthesia. Ear-clip electrodes were used to deliver 200 V (sine wave) at 50 mA for 2 s to induce clonic seizure according to published protocols (74Steward O. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 25: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Animals were subsequently allowed to recover before being sacrificed 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 h after ECS (n = 4 per group). Control rats (n = 6) were subjected to equivalent handling without subsequent stimulation. All brains were removed, frozen on dry ice, and stored at –80 °C prior to subsequent analysis by in situ hybridization.In Situ Hybridization—Coronal sections (14 μm) were mounted on polylysine-coated Superfrost slides and stored at –80 °C. In situ hybridization was performed essentially as described elsewhere (29French P.J. O'Connor V. Jones M.W. Davis S. Errington M.L. Voss K. Truchet B. Wotjak C. Stean T. Doyere V. Maroun M. Laroche S. Bliss T.V. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 968-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were thawed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, acetylated in 1.4% triethanolamine and 0.25% acetic anhydride, dehydrated through graded ethanol solutions, and delipidated in chloroform. Sections were hybridized overnight at 42 °C in 100 μl of buffer containing 50% formamide, 4× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 5× Denhardt's solution, 200 mg/ml acid alkali-cleaved salmon testis DNA, 100 mg/ml long chain polyadenylic acid, 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 100,000 cpm radiolabeled probe (∼1 ng/ml) under parafilm coverslips. Sections were washed in 1× SSC at 55 °C (30 min), 0.1× SSC at room temperature (5 min), and dehydrated in ethanol. Sections were then exposed to autoradiographic film. [35S]ATP-end-labeled probes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were generated using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Promega) according to instructions from the manufacturer. A 50-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was used as a negative control; for probes cl13/19/90, cl95/96, cl77, and WS, labeled sense oligonucleotides served as an additional control.Antisense sequences were: Cl13/19/90, AGCCATTTCCCAGATGCTCGCCCAGTATCTTTGAAAGGGGTCAG; Cl95/96, ATGGCAGAAGGCAGGGAAAGCAGGTTGGCAGGAGAAGAAGGCTGA; Cl77, AGCACGCACAAAGCATTCTGGGATTTCTGCCTCTGCGGGTCTTGA; WS, TCTCTGGCTCAAGACTTGGCAAGACAGGTGGTTCAGGAGAGGTGA; YB, GAAGCAACTCGCATTGTTAGAGGGTCCATCTTCCATGTCGGAG; YC, TCAGGAATGTTCAGGACTTCTCCCGTTCTTGCCACTTGACCAG; YD, GGCTTCCAGTCCATGTGCAGTGGTCCTCTGTAGGCATCCATG; YE, AAACCAGGCAGTGGGTTCCTCCTCTGGGAGCTGGGGTTCTC; and YF, CCGCCAAAGTATCCTCCAGTACAAAACTCCTTTCTGCTTCATT.Labeled sections were exposed to high resolution film (Kodak BiomaxMR). Autoradiographs were analyzed by measuring the integrated density relative to a 14C standard using NIH Image or SAMBA. The signal intensity in stimulated dentate was expressed as a percentage of the unstimulated contralateral dentate granule cell layer. ECS activates gene expression on both sides of the brain; in these experiments, Pde10A expression was compared with the levels in sham-handled, and age-matched controls. The statistical significance of any differences following LTP or ECS treatment as compared with respective controls was assessed using Student's t test.RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from adult rat hippocampus, cerebellum, cortex, and olfactory bulb using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to instructions from the manufacturer. 10 μg of total RNA was treated with 4 units of DNase for 15 min. at 37 °C. 3 μg of DNase-treated RNA samples were then reverse transcribed for 1 h at 50 °C in the presence of 200 units of Superscript III (Invitrogen), 150 ng of oligo(dT)18 primer, 0.5 mm dNTPs, 50 mm DTT, and RNase inhibitor in a total volume of 20 μl. A control reaction was performed in absence of reverse transcriptase; control samples were otherwise treated identically.0.2 μl from the reverse transcribed cDNA was used for each RT-PCR reaction. Primer pairs used for detection of the primary transcript were (from 5′ to 3′ end of the Pde10A gene): GTGGTTGTGTGACATTTTCCATCC and GACCTTGGGTTTGTGCTGTTTC (primers o-p), ATCCCGACCCTTGGCTTCTCAATG and TGCTTGTCTGCTTTCTTCCCTG, TTGCTCCCTGGTGCTGTTTG and TCCTCCATTGCTCTCAGAAGCC, GGTTCGTTTGCTGTTGGCTTAG and TATTACACCCATCCCGCTCCTC (primers m-n), GGATAGACCTAAGGCAACCACAAG and TCACAATGGCTTCTGACACGC, AGGATGCAGTCCATGATGGTGG and ACTTAAACCCTTGGTCTCTGCTAGG (within cl95/96), TGAAGCCCCAGCACTACACAACTC and CCATTCTTTCTCCCTCCAGACATAC (primers k-l), TTCTCAGCCATCTTCTCCCACC and TCTGCCTTTTTTCTCCCTTTGG, GGGGATAATAGCTCAAGGGAGACC and AGCACAGAATCCAGAAGAGGGTATC (primers i-j), TATGCGAAAGCACCAGTCGG and TTCTCTTCACACAGTAGCACCCTG, TGGAATGGCATCGGCTTGTAGC and TGGTCCTCATAATCCTGTGTCTGC (primers g-h), ACTGAGGCTGGAGGAGTTAGAGTTC and TAGAAAGATGGGGCAGGTGGTC, CAAAGAAGTTGTCTGGGGTGTGC and TTCATCCTCAGTCAAGGGCATCGG. Primers used to estimate relative levels of LTP-associated splice isoforms: TTTCCCAGAGACTTGTCCCTACG and GGCTTTTGTGGCTATCCTGATG (primers b-c), AACTCCGCCCCTATGTCAAGTG and TACACGACTCCCTGCATGTTCG (primers a-d). Primers used to amplify full-length Pde10A3 were TTAAAGGTGGGAGCAAAGGCCC and ATCAGTCATCGACCTTCCTGGTCG, those used to amplify full-length Pde10A11 were ATGTCGAAGAAGCGCAAAGCCCTC and ATCAGTCATCGACCTTCCTGGTCG.cAMP and cGMP Measurements—Sequence-verified full-length rat Pde10A3 and Pde10A11 were cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Cos7 cells, grown on 6-well plates, were transfected with the Pde10A constructs or peYFP-C1 (Clontech) using DEAE dextran (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Prior to cAMP and cGMP measurement, transfection efficiency was monitored as the percentage of cells that expressed eYFP monitored with a fluorescent microscope. In our hands, this method routinely transfects ∼70–80% of cells in culture. 18–24 h following transfection, cAMP and cGMP measurements were performed (cAMP or cGMP enzyme immunoassay biotrack system, Amersham Biosciences) according to instructions from the manufacturer. Levels were expressed relative to the total amount of protein in each sample. Protein concentrations were measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. cGMP experiments are averages of five values obtained in two independent experiments, cAMP experiments are averages of four values (four independent experiments) for each construct.RESULTSIdentification of LTP-associated Transcripts—Tetanic stimulation of the perforant path in freely moving rats induced a stable form of LTP, measured by the mean increase in the slope of evoked EPSPs, that persisted at least 6 h without decrement (Fig. 1A). Control rats receiving a similar number of stimuli at low frequency did not display such increase in EPSP slope (CS group; data not shown). Animals were sacrificed 1, 3, and 6 h after tetanic stimulation, or 1 h after control stimulation, and RNA was extracted from the dorsal half of the dentate gyrus ipsilateral to the implanted electrodes. RNA extracted from the dorsal half of the dentate gyrus from a group of naive animals served as an additional control (naive group). We next performed differential mRNA display (1Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4688) Google Scholar) using the Hieroglyph mRNA profile kit (Genomyx) to screen for LTP-modulated transcripts (Fig. 1B). Candidate LTP-modulated transcripts were then subjected to a second screening round on independently generated brains using in situ hybridization. In situ hybridization was performed using radiolabeled 45-mer oligonucleotides complementary to the sequence of differentially regulated transcripts. From this secondary screen we confirmed differential expression of five clones: cl13, cl19, cl90, cl95, and cl96. Sequence identity between these clones indicated that they represent two independent transcripts (Fig. 1B): cl13/19/90 and cl95/96. Both clones were strongly up-regulated 1 h after the induction of LTP and returned to pre-tetanus levels 3 h following tetanization (n = 4 for each time point). No up-regulation was observed in the dentate gyrus of animals receiving a pseudo-tetanus or those in which the tetanus was delivered in the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonist 3((R)-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (10 mg/kg, n = 4 for each condition, data not shown).The two transcripts exhibit a similar spatial distribution as determined by in situ hybridization. In the adult rat, under basal, non-tetanized conditions, cl95/96 and cl13/19/90 are expressed at highest levels in the cerebellum. Other regions with detectable expression levels include the olfactory bulb, the dentate gyrus, areas CA1–CA3 of the hippocampal formation, and cortex (Fig. 1C). In addition to their similar spatial distribution, both cl13/19/90 and cl95/96 are expressed at similar low levels. Expression levels can be estimated by in situ hybridization as the time required to develop a signal on autoradiographic film. Approximately 3 months of exposure was required for cl13/19/90 and cl95/96 to reach quantifiable signal intensities on autoradiographic film compared with ∼4 days of exposure for Zif268 (see also Ref. 29French P.J. O'Connor V. Jones M.W. Davis S. Errington M.L. Voss K. Truchet B. Wotjak C. Stean T. Doyere V. Maroun M. Laroche S. Bliss T.V. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 968-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating ∼20–30-fold lower expression levels.cl13/19/90 and cl95/96 Both Lie within an Intron of the Pde10A Gene—As our differential display screen identified only a partial cDNA sequence, we set out to determine the nature of the complete transcript of cl13/19/90 and cl95/96. Cl13/19/90 and cl95/96 appear to lie in a non-coding part of the full-length transcript as they do not contain any large open reading frames. Interestingly, Northern blot analysis failed to identify a full-length cl13/19/90 or cl95/96 transcript (results not shown) whereas other mRNAs using the same blots were readily detectable (see, e.g., Ref. 46French P.J. Bliss T.V. O'Connor V. Neuroscience. 2001; 108: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The size of the full-length mRNA of cl13/19/90 or cl95/96 therefore remained elusive. We next compared the cDNA sequence of cl13/19/90 and cl95/96 to the public domain sequence data bases. To our surprise we did not detect significant homology to (i) the non-redundant data base that contains mRNA sequence, (ii) the data base of expressed sequence tags, or (iii) the data bases of the completed human or mouse genome. The lack of homology of cl13/19/90 and cl95/96 to these data bases therefore did not help determine the nature of their complete mRNA transcript.The cDNA sequence of cl13/19/90 and cl95/96 did, however, show a clear homology when compared with the draft genome sequence of the rat, the species used for our differential display screen. Interestingly, both cl13/19/90 and cl95/96 lie in close proximity (80 kb) to each other on chromosome 1. Neither clone contain introns themselves as they match contiguously on the genome. Although no confirmed transcripts are present in close (<40 kb) vicinity, both clones are situated within the same large (200 kb) intron of the Pde10A gene (Fig. 2). The absence of any information regarding the identity of the full-length transcript of cl13/19/90 and cl95/96 therefore led us to hypothesize these clones may be part of the gene in which they are localized. In theory, cl13/19/90 and cl95/96 could be part of the Pde10A gene either as part of its primary transcript or as a novel splice variant. However, it is also possible cl13/19/90 and cl95/96 are not part of the Pde10A gene at all. Our next experiments were performed to discriminate between these options.Fig. 2Genomic organization of the rat Pde10A gene.

We therefore performed RT-PCR on intronic regions of the Pde10A gene indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 2 using DNase-treated, reverse transcribed RNA derived from adult rat hippocampus and cerebellum. Interestingly, all RT-PCR reactions confirmed the presence of intronic Pde10A sequence (examples are shown in Fig. 3), with the notable exception of a reaction performed outside the Pde10A gene (primers o-p, Figs. 2 and 3). The amplified fragments include introns that lie 3′ to the common intron that encompasses cl13/19/90 and cl95/96. The PCR products were not the result of amplification of genomic DNA, as they were only observed using reverse transcribed RNA and not in control reactions using non-reverse transcribed RNA. Identical results were obtained using RT-PCR on cDNA derived from adult rat cerebellum (results not shown). Because amplification of other intronic regions of the Pde10A gene may not have been detectable if cl13/19/90 and cl95/96 encode either a novel Pde10A splice variant or are part of a separate gene, our results favor the hypothesis that cl13/19/90 and cl95/96 are part of the Pde10A primary transcript.Fig. 3RT-PCR performed on various intronic regions of the Pde10A gene amplified fragments of predicted length. We were unable to amplify fragments in a region outside the Pde10A gene (o-p). These results suggest the primary transcript of Pde10A can be detected by RT-PCR. PCR products were only observed using reverse transcribed RNA (cDNA); no product was detected when using non-reverse transcribed RNA (ctr). This indicates the PCR products were not the result of amplification of genomic DNA. Identical results were obtained using RT-PCR on cDNA derived from adult rat cerebellum (data not shown).View Large Image Figure"
https://openalex.org/W2008736289,"The role of the NH2-terminal leucine zipper and dileucine motifs of hIK1 in the assembly, trafficking, and function of the channel was investigated using cell surface immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), immunoblot, and whole-cell patch clamp techniques. Mutation of the NH2-terminal leucine zipper at amino acid positions 18 and 25 (L18A/L25A) resulted in a complete loss of steady-state protein expression, cell surface expression, and whole-cell current density. Inhibition of proteasomal degradation with lactacystin restored L18A/L25A protein expression, although this channel was not expressed at the cell surface as assessed by cell surface immunoprecipitation and whole-cell patch clamp. In contrast, inhibitors of lysosomal degradation (leupeptin/pepstatin) and endocytosis (chloroquine) had little effect on L18A/L25A protein expression or localization. Further studies confirmed the rapid degradation of this channel, having a time constant of 19.0 ± 1.3 min compared with 3.2 ± 0.8 h for wild type hIK1. Co-expression studies demonstrated that the L18A/L25A channel associates with wild type channel, thereby attenuating its expression at the cell surface. Co-IP studies confirmed this association. However, L18A/L25A channels failed to form homotetrameric channels, as assessed by Co-IP, suggesting the NH2 terminus plays a role in tetrameric channel assembly. As with the leucine zipper, mutation of the dileucine motif to alanines, L18A/L19A, resulted in a near complete loss in steady-state protein expression with the protein being similarly targeted to the proteasome for degradation. In contrast to our results on the leucine zipper, however, both chloroquine and growing the cells at the permissive temperature of 27 °C restored expression of L18A/L19A at the cell surface, suggesting that the defect in the channel trafficking is the result of a subtle folding error. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the NH2 terminus of hIK1 contains overlapping leucine zipper and dileucine motifs essential for channel assembly and trafficking to the plasma membrane.

In conclusion, we demonstrate that the NH2 terminus of hIK1 contains overlapping leucine zipper and dileucine motifs essential for channel assembly and trafficking to the plasma membrane. The KCNN gene family is composed of four members, including the small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK1, SK2, and SK3) 1The abbreviations used are: SK, small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel; IK, intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel; hIK1, human IK1 channel; IP, immunoprecipitation; Co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; CS-IP, cell surface immunoprecipitation; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; IF, immunofluorescence; IB, immunoblotting; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; pF, picofarad; DCEBIO, 5,6-dichloro-1-ethyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one; N-Del, deletion of the cytoplasmic NH2 terminus; τ, time constant. and the intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (IK1 or SK4). While the IK1 and SK channels share roughly 40% homology, their expression patterns and pharmacology are widely disparate, consistent with their unique physiological functions (1Joiner W.J. Wang L.Y. Tang M.D. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11013-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The human IK1 channel (hIK1) is widely expressed, being found in salivary gland, colon, bladder, stomach, lung, smooth muscle, red blood cells, T-cells, and placenta (2Ishii T.M. Silvia C.

Physiol. 1998; 275: C848-C856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where it plays a crucial role in a variety of physiological functions. Indeed hIK1 plays a seminal role in modulating Ca2+-dependent transepithelial ion transport (4Devor D.C. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C138-C148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Devor D.C. Singh A.K. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L775-L784PubMed Google Scholar), has recently been confirmed to be the Gardos channel of red blood cells (6Hoffman J.F. Joiner W.

A. 2003; 100: 7366-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and has been proposed to play a role in both vascular remodeling (7Saito T. Fujiwara Y. Fujiwara R. Hasegawa H. Kibira S. Miura H. Miura M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2002; 29: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and in modulating vascular tone (8Kohler R. Degenhardt C. Kuhn M. Runkel N. Paul M. Hoyer J. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because of these critical physiological roles, the regulation of hIK1 has received a great deal of attention. For instance, hIK1 is directly gated by intracellular Ca2+ interacting with calmodulin that is constitutively associated with the COOH terminus of the channel (9Takahata T. Hayashi M. Ishikawa T. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C127-C144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jensen B. Hertz M. Christophersen P. Madsen L. Expert Opin. Ther.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5746-5754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In addition, we have demonstrated that ATP activates hIK1 via cAMP-dependent protein kinase and that this activation relies upon a COOH-terminal domain overlapping the Ca2+-dependent, calmodulin-binding domain (12Gerlach A.C. Gangopadhyay N.N. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 585-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Gerlach A.C. Syme C.A. Giltinan L. Adelman J.P. Devors D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10963-10970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that hIK1 is inhibited by arachidonic acid (4Devor D.C. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C138-C148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), recently mapping the inhibitory arachidonic acid binding site to the pore of hIK1 (14Hamilton K.L. Syme C.A. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16690-16697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore the regulation of hIK1 by protein kinase C has been defined at the molecular level (15Wulf A. Schwab A. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 187: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Given the potential clinical importance of this channel, it is not surprising that the pharmacology of hIK1 has similarly been extensively examined. We have demonstrated that IK and SK channels are activated by benzimidazolinones, including 1-ethyl-2-benzimdazolinone and DCEBIO, as well as the centrally acting muscle relaxants chlorzoxazone and zoxazolamine (5Devor D.C. Singh A.K. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L775-L784PubMed Google Scholar, 16Syme C.A. Gerlach A.C. Singh A.K. Devor D.C. Am. J.

Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32040-32045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) mapped the molecular binding site for this blocker to the pore of hIK1. In contrast to the studies on channel regulation and pharmacology, the assembly, trafficking, and cell surface expression of the hIK1 channel has been little studied. The hIK1 channel lacks a characteristic T1 assembly domain, conserved in many of the voltage-activated channels (19Shen N.V. Chen X. Boyer M.M. Pfaffinger P.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and is therefore likely to possess a novel domain that aids in channel assembly and trafficking. Our laboratory recently defined a role for the COOH terminus of hIK1 in the trafficking of the channel to the cell membrane (20Syme C.A. Hamilton K.L. Jones H.M. Gerlach A.C. Giltinan L. Papworth G.D. Watkins S.C. Bradbury N.A. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8476-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We reported that a leucine zipper located in this region of the channel was crucial for channel folding and membrane trafficking but was not essential for channel assembly. Further Joiner et al. (21Joiner W.J. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37980-37985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the correct assembly of calmodulin with the COOH terminus of hIK1 was required for efficient delivery of the channel to the cell surface. To date, there have been no studies defining the role of the 26-amino acid cytoplasmic NH2 terminus in the assembly and trafficking of hIK1. Similar to the COOH terminus, the NH2 terminus of hIK1 contains a hydrophobic domain, including two potential leucine zippers, one of which extends into the first transmembrane domain, as well as a dileucine motif. As leucine zippers may form coiled-coil domains important in protein assembly (22MacFarlane S.N. Levitan I.B. Sci. STKE. 2001; http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/98/pe1PubMed Google Scholar) and dileucine motifs are known to be involved in protein trafficking (23Melvin D.R. Marsh B.J. Walmsley A.R. James D.E. Gould G.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) we determined the role of each of these motifs in the assembly, trafficking, and function of hIK1. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% O2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Stable cell lines were generated for all constructs by subjecting cells to antibiotic selection (1 mg/ml G418) 48 h post-transfection. Selection was typically complete within 14 days post-transfection. Following selection the concentration of G418 was reduced to 0.2 mg/ml. Note that clonal cell lines were not subsequently selected from this stable population of cells to avoid clonal variation. Molecular Biology—The cDNA for hIK1 was originally provided by J. P. Adelman (Vollum Institute, Oregon Health Sciences University). HA (YPYDVPDYA) and Myc (EQKLISEEDL) epitope tags were inserted either into the second extracellular loop between Gly132 and Ala133 or at the COOH terminus, respectively, as described previously (20Syme C.A. Hamilton K.L. Jones H.M. Gerlach A.C. Giltinan L. Papworth G.D. Watkins S.C. Bradbury N.A. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8476-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All mutations in the HA-hIK1 channel were produced using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis strategy (Stratagene). The fidelity of all constructs were confirmed by sequencing (ABI PRISM 377 automated sequencer, University of Pittsburgh) and subsequent sequence alignment (National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST) with hIK1 (GenBank™ accession number AF022150). Antibodies—For detection of HA-hIK1 by immunofluorescence (IF), immunoprecipitation (IP), and immunoblotting (IB) the following antibodies were obtained from the sources indicated (dilutions used are indicated): polyclonal HA (1:150) and monoclonal HA (1:1,000) (HA.11, Covance, Richmond, CA) and c-Myc (clone 9E10, 1:1,000, Roche Applied Science). The following secondary antibodies were obtained from the various sources indicated: biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), streptavidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 (1:500, Molecular Probes), Cy3.18-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:3,000, Amersham Biosciences), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000, BD Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—For IF labeling, HEK293 stable cell lines were grown on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated glass coverslips for 24 h prior to labeling. Cell surface HA-hIK1 was labeled via sequential incubation in primary monoclonal HA antibody (1:1,000, 90 min) and secondary biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200, 90 min) followed by streptavidin conjugated to Alexa 488 (1:500; 90 min). All steps were performed at 4°C to prevent endocytosis of the channel. Following cell surface labeling, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 2% paraformaldehyde, PBS, and intracellular localized HA-hIK1 was labeled sequentially with primary monoclonal HA antibody (1:1,000, 90 min), and secondary Cy3.18-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:3,000) antibody. Finally nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). This approach allowed us to detect both cell surface and intracellular HA-hIK1 in the same cells as described previously (20Syme C.A. Hamilton K.L. Jones H.M. Gerlach A.C. Giltinan L. Papworth G.D. Watkins S.C. Bradbury N.A. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8476-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were then subjected to laser confocal microscopy using a Leica TCSNT 3 laser 4 PMT system. To ensure maximal X-Y spatial resolution, sections were scanned at 1024 × 1024 pixels using sequential two-color image collection to minimize cross-talk between the channels imaged. All images shown in a single figure were scanned on the same day using identical settings. The images were then imported into Adobe Photoshop and combined into a single figure, and red-green-blue (RGB) brightness/contrast was adjusted identically for all panels. Chemiluminescence—HEK cells were transiently transfected with the Myc-tagged and HA-tagged wild type hIK1 or L18A/L25A channel 24 h prior to the experiment. The cells were sequentially incubated in monoclonal HA antibody (1:1,000) for 90 min followed by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:2,000, BD Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were then extensively washed, and the horseradish peroxidase-labeled proteins were detected using West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) in conjunction with a TD20/20 luminometer (Turner, Sunnyvale, CA). Intensities are presented as a percentage of wild type. Electrophysiology—During whole-cell patch clamp experiments the bath contained 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). The pipette solution contained 130 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 0.12 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.2 mm EGTA (pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH). All experiments were preformed at room temperature (22 °C) using stably transfected HEK293 cells plated the pervious day. Electrodes were fabricated from thin walled borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), were pulled on a vertical puller (Narishige, Long Island, NY), and had a resistance of 1-4 megaohms. Currents were recorded using an Axon Instruments (Foster City, CA) 200B amplifier interfaced to a computer using a Digidata 1322A (Axon Instruments). Following establishment of the whole-cell configuration, voltage steps were applied using pClamp 8.2 software (Axon Instruments) from a holding potential of -60 mV at 250-ms pulses every 2 s from -100 to +80 mV in 20-mV increments to generate a current-voltage (I-V) relationship. Current was sampled at steady state (100 ms) for the purpose of evaluating current density. Current density (pA/pF) at 0 mV was calculated by dividing the current by the whole-cell capacitance. Immunoprecipitation—For co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) of HA- and Myc-tagged hIK1 constructs, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected in 60-mm dishes using LipofectAMINE 2000 and 5 μg of each plasmid (total, 10 μg of DNA and 20 μl of lipid). When only a single construct was transfected (HA or Myc) empty pcDNA3.1(+) was included (5 μg) to maintain the same final concentration of plasmid and lipid in all dishes. Cells were lysed 18-24 h post-transfection with IP buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science, pH 7.4), and protein concentrations were determined and normalized to achieve equivalent loading. Crude lysates were then precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and incubated with polyclonal HA antibodies. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads followed by sequential washes in IP buffer containing 500, 300, and 150 mm NaCl (2×) supplemented with 1× radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS). After the final wash, the pellet was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12% gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblot analysis as described below. For cell surface IP (CS-IP), cells were grown to confluence in a 100-mm dish, and cell surface channels were labeled with polyclonal HA antibody (1:500) for 90 min at 4 °C followed by extensive washing to remove unbound antibody. As above, all steps were performed at 4 °C to prevent endocytosis of the channel and/or antibody. The cells were then lysed, protein concentrations were normalized, and the immune complexes were directly subjected to IP as detailed above. Following transfer to nitrocellulose, IB was performed using monoclonal HA antibody (1:1,000) as detailed below. In addition to the IP, 20 μg of protein was set aside following cell lysis for IB. In this way, we were able to confirm similar levels of protein expression in cells failing to correctly traffic HA-hIK1 to the cell surface. Immunoblot Analysis—HEK293 cells were grown to confluence, lysed with IP buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. 20 μg of total protein was run on the gel unless otherwise noted in the text. Immunoblotting was then carried out as described previously (20Syme C.A. Hamilton K.L. Jones H.M. Gerlach A.C. Giltinan L. Papworth G.D. Watkins S.C. Bradbury N.A. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8476-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In experiments where band densities are plotted, the band intensities were determined using the UN-SCAN-IT gel™ automated digitizing system (Silk Scientific Corp., Orem, UT). Background intensity was determined for each immunoblot film used and subtracted from the intensity values. The percent changes in intensities were determined by dividing the experimental intensity by the wild type control intensity. Chemicals—All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. DCEBIO was synthesized in the laboratory of R. J. Bridges (University of Pittsburgh) as described previously (24Singh S. Syme C.A. Singh A.K. Devor D.C. Bridges R.J. J Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 600-611PubMed Google Scholar). Leupeptin, pepstatin, chloroquine, and lactacystin were purchased from Sigma and prepared as suggested by the manufacturer. Statistics—All data are presented as means ± S.E. where n indicates the number of experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student's unpaired t test. A value of p < 0.05 is considered statistically significant and is reported. The IF and other biochemical assays were repeated at least three times to ensure the fidelity of our results. The τ values were calculated using the exponential decay, single, two-parameter regression function of SigmaPlot 2001 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Role of the NH2 Terminus in the Expression, Trafficking, and Function of hIK1—We previously demonstrated that the correct trafficking of hIK1 to the cell surface was dependent upon a COOH-terminal leucine zipper (20Syme C.A. Hamilton K.L. Jones H.M. Gerlach A.C. Giltinan L. Papworth G.D. Watkins S.C. Bradbury N.A. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8476-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The 26-amino acid cytoplasmic NH2 terminus of hIK1 also contains two potential overlapping leucine zippers, resulting in the generation of a dileucine motif (see Fig. 1A). In our initial studies designed to elucidate the role of these motifs in the assembly and trafficking of hIK1 the entire cytoplasmic NH2 terminus was deleted from our HA epitope-tagged channel (HA-hIK1). We previously demonstrated that insertion of the HA epitope into the second extracellular domain of hIK1 allows us to monitor cell surface expression by IF and CS-IP while having no effect on the biophysical or regulatory properties of the channel (20Syme C.A. Hamilton K.L. Jones H.M. Gerlach A.C. Giltinan L. Papworth G.D. Watkins S.C. Bradbury N.A. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8476-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Following deletion of the cytoplasmic NH2 terminus, we evaluated cell surface expression by IF and CS-IP, total protein expression by IB, and channel function by the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Similar to previous results (20Syme C.A. Hamilton K.L. Jones H.M. Gerlach A.C. Giltinan L. Papworth G.D. Watkins S.C. Bradbury N.A. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8476-8486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we were able to detect expression of HA-hIK1 at the cell surface by IF localization (Fig. 1B, green labeling) as expected for the wild type channel. In addition, intracellular channel protein was clearly labeled (Fig. 1B, red labeling). However, following deletion of the cytoplasmic NH2 terminus (N-Del) there was a dramatic decrease in cell surface labeling of the channel, although intracellular channel protein was still labeled (Fig. 1C). This result suggests that the NH2 terminus of hIK1 is required for cell surface expression. To quantitatively evaluate both cell surface and total protein expression of hIK1 following deletion of the NH2 terminus we performed CS-IP in conjunction with IB. Consistent with our IF data, we demonstrated by CS-IP that HA-hIK1 was abundantly expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 1D, lane 1), while we were unable to detect surface expression of the N-Del channel (Fig. 1D, lane 2). The immunoblot analysis confirmed that HA-hIK1 and N-Del were expressed at similar levels consistent with the IF data (Fig. 1D), indicating that the lack of cell surface expression is not due to a lack of protein expression. Finally we confirmed a lack of functional N-Del channel expression using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. As shown in Fig. 1E, HA-hIK1 could be activated by the pharmacological channel opener DCEBIO as described previously (16Syme C.A. Gerlach A.C. Singh A.K. Devor D.C. Am. J.

In eight experiments, DCEBIO (10 μm) increased current density an average of 107 ± 22 pA/pF in HA-hIK1-expressing cells. Consistent with our IF and CS-IP results, cells expressing the N-Del channel failed to respond to DCEBIO (0.6 ± 0.3 pA/pF, n = 15), indicative of no functional channels being expressed at the cell surface. These results clearly demonstrate a role for the NH2 terminus of hIK1 in the functional expression of this channel at the plasma membrane. The Leu5/Leu12/Leu19 Leucine Zipper Does Not Contribute to hIK1 Assembly, Trafficking, or Function—As shown in Fig. 1A, there are multiple leucine-based motifs in the cytoplasmic NH2 terminus of hIK1 that may contribute to the lack of cell surface expression observed following deletion. One such motif is a potential leucine zipper at amino acid positions Leu5/Leu12/Leu19 (in Fig. 1A these leucines are shown in boldface type). We therefore mutated the first two leucines in this potential zipper motif to alanines (L5A/L12A) and determined the effect of this mutation on trafficking and function. As assessed by CS-IP, IB, and whole-cell current density measurements the L5A/L12A mutation had no significant effect on hIK1 expression or function (data not shown). These results indicate that this proximal NH2-teminal leucine zipper is not required for correct expression and function of hIK1. Role of the NH2-terminal Leucine Zipper (Leu18/Leu25/Leu32/Leu39) and Dileucine (Leu18/Leu19) Motifs in hIK1 Expression and Function—The NH2 terminus of hIK1 contains a second potential leucine heptad repeat that extends into the first transmembrane domain (Leu18/Leu25/Leu32/Leu39). In Fig. 1A, the leucines comprising this heptad repeat are highlighted by asterisks. Interestingly a dileucine motif is formed from the last leucine in the first heptad repeat and the first leucine in this second heptad repeat, i.e. Leu18/Leu19 (Fig. 1A, underline). To evaluate the role of this second potential leucine zipper as well as the dileucine motif, we constructed a series of single and double alanine substitution mutations and determined their effect on cell surface expression, total protein expression, and function. As shown in Fig. 2, mutation of Leu18 to Ala (L18A) had no significant effect on surface expression as assessed by both IF (Fig. 2A) and CS-IP (Fig. 2B) or function as assessed by whole-cell patch clamp current density measurements (Fig. 2C; HA-hIK1, 157 ± 18, n = 50; L18A, 137 ± 38 pA/pF, n = 10; p = 0.65). In contrast, the additional individual alanine substitutions L19A and L25A resulted in clear reductions in channel surface expression (Fig. 2, A and B), total protein expression (Fig. 2B), and functional channel expression (Fig. 2C; L19A, 49 ± 23 pA/pF, n = 10; L25A, 68 ± 15 pA/pF, n = 6; p < 0.05). These results suggest that the NH2-terminal leucines in hIK1 are crucial for normal channel expression and function. We next constructed double mutations in both of these motifs and determined their effects on channel expression. Similar results to those above were obtained when the double alanine mutations L25A/L32A and L32A/L39A were introduced into the NH2-terminal leucine zipper of HA-hIK1. That is, there was a clear decrease in both cell surface channel (Fig. 2, A and B) and total protein expression (Fig. 2B). Whole-cell patch clamp experiments (Fig. 2C) confirmed a significant reduction in current density for these double mutations (L25A/L32A, 75 ± 32 pA/pF, n = 8; L32A/L39A, 74 ± 24 pA/pF, n = 10; p < 0.05) when compared with wild type HA-hIK1. In contrast to these rather modest effects, introducing the double mutation L18A/L25A or L18A/L19A into the leucine zipper or the dileucine motif, respectively, resulted in a complete loss of cell surface expression (Fig. 2, A and B). Indeed we were unable to detect any IF signal following mutation of L18A/L25A either at the cell surface or inside the cell (note the complete absence of red IF signal), whereas a very weak signal, corresponding to intracellular protein, was detected following mutation of L18A/L19A (Fig. 2A). The reason for the total loss of intracellular IF signal is apparent when one considers the immunoblot shown in Fig. 2B. That is, mutation of L18A/L19A produced a near complete loss of total protein, and no protein was detected following mutation of L18A/L25A. These biochemical"

Candesartan and EXP3174 are competitive, reversible insurmountable antagonists of the AT1 receptor. They contain di-acidic substitutions, whereas the surmountable antagonist, losartan, contains only one acidic group. We tested the hypothesis that these two classes of ligands interact with the AT1 receptor through similar but not identical bonds and that the differences in the acid-base group contacts are critical for insurmountable antagonism. By pharmacological characterization of site-directed AT1 receptor mutants expressed in COS1 cells we show that specific interactions with Gln257 in transmembrane 6 distinguishes insurmountable antagonists and that abolishing these interactions transforms insurmountable to surmountable antagonism. In the Q257A mutant, the dissociation rate of [3H]candesartan is 2.8-fold more than the rate observed with wild type, and the association rate was reduced 4-fold lower than the wild type. The pattern of antagonism of angiotensin II concentration-response in the Q257A mutant pretreated with EXP3174 and candesartan is surmountable. We propose that leaning ability of insurmountable antagonists on Gln257 in the wild-type receptor is the basis of an antagonist-mediated conformational transition, which is responsible for both slow dissociation and inhibition of maximal IP response.

Antagonism of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; Ang II, angiotensin II (DRVYIHPF); WT, wild type; AT1, angiotensin II type 1; TM, transmembrane; EC, extracellular; IP, inositol phosphate; Rg, ground state inactive receptor conformation; R, basal partially active conformation; R*, active receptor conformation; Sar, sarcosine. such as the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) has gained much attention, evidently due to therapeutic success of the drugs targeting this family of receptors. Antagonists of GPCRs exhibit diverse patterns of antagonism that range from the classical surmountable antagonism (parallel rightward shift of agonist concentration-response curves with no decline of the maximum response) to insurmountable antagonism (partial to complete waning of the response accompanying a seeming rightward shift of the agonist response curve). Insurmountable antagonist occupancy of the receptor generally prolongs the time taken for re-sensitization to agonist than the surmountable antagonist occupancy (1Gaddum J.H. Hameed K.A. Hathway D.E. Stephens F.F. Q. J. Exp. Physiol. Cogn. Med. Sci. 1955; 40: 49-74PubMed Google Scholar). Common mechanisms proposed for insurmountable antagonism involve phenomena attributed to equilibrium between allosteric activity states of receptors that (i) affect the kinetics of drug-receptor interaction, (ii) induce antagonist-dependent receptor conformation that is refractory to agonist binding, and (iii) modulate coupling to unknown molecules that stabilize the antagonist-bound state of the receptor (2Timmermans P.B.

In other instances the insurmountable antagonists forming a covalent bond with the receptor (irreversible) or the insurmountable antagonists dissociating very slowly from the receptor (pseudo-irreversible) have been proposed (2Timmermans P.B. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 55-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Even so, the molecular mechanism responsible for distinct efficacy from different types of drug-receptor complexes has remained unclear. Pharmacological behavior of the non-peptide antagonists of the AT1 receptor provides several advantages as a model to study insurmountable antagonism of GPCRs. AT1 receptor antagonists displaying both types of pharmacological behavior are currently being evaluated for therapeutic potential in cardio-protective, reno-protective, anti-proliferative, and anti-fibrotic effects in addition to anti-hypertensive effects (2Timmermans P.B. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 55-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 3Timmermans P.B. Can. J.

In fact it has been reported for GPCR systems that include those for noradrenaline, histamine, acetylcholine, 5-hydroxy tryptamine (5-HT), substance P, bradykinin, cholecystokinin, and chemotactic C5α receptors (2Timmermans P.B. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 55-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 3Timmermans P.B. Can. J.

Both classes of the AT1 receptor antagonists share a structure with biphenyltetrazole linked to a planar substituted imidazole with a short alkyl chain (Fig. 1A). Candesartan and EXP3174 are competitive, reversible antagonists that display insurmountable antagonism (2Timmermans P.B. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 55-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 3Timmermans P.B. Can. J. Cardiol. 1999; : 26-28Google Scholar, 4Morsing P J. Am. Soc.

They contain di-acidic substitutions, whereas the surmountable antagonist losartan contains only one acidic group. In aortic contraction as well as inositol phosphate (IP) production assays, preincubation with losartan produces classical surmountable antagonism, whereas candesartan and EXP3174 produce insurmountable antagonism. Co-incubation experiments and detailed kinetic analysis have lead to several proposals for the mechanism mentioned earlier (2Timmermans P.B. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 55-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 3Timmermans P.B. Can. J. Cardiol. 1999; : 26-28Google Scholar, 4Morsing P J. Am. Soc.

A difference in drug-receptor-bonding interactions due to differences in the acid-base groups is one possible mechanism. We speculate that the two classes of ligands interact with the AT1 receptor through similar but not identical bonds, and the difference in contact is critical for their pharmacological properties. In a previous study (6Noda K. Saad Y. Kinoshita A. Boyle T.P. Graham R.M. Husain A. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2284-2289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) we demonstrated that the tetrazole moiety of losartan interacts primarily with Lys199 and secondarily with His256 (see Fig. 1). Candesartan contains an additional carboxylate group attached to the imidazole ring that may interact with a second positive-charged or hydrogen-bonding residue in the AT1 receptor to produce insurmountable antagonism. The ethoxy group in candesartan may form an additional hydrogen bond. Together, these differences in bonding could be the basis for insurmountable antagonism. Therefore, our goal in the present study is to identify the specific bonding interaction that distinguishes insurmountable AT1 receptor antagonists EXP3174 and candesartan from the surmountable antagonist losartan and examine whether abolishing the additional interaction transforms insurmountable to surmountable antagonism. Materials—Analogues of Ang II and Ang II were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). 125I-Labeled Ang II (specific activity, 2200 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Dr. Robert Speth (Washington State University, Pulman, WA). Losartan, [3H]losartan, and EXP3174 were gifts from DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. Candesartan and [3H]candesartan were gifts from AstraZeneca. myo-[2-3H(N)]Inositol was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. COS1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and FUGENE 6 was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Membrane Preparation—The rat AT1 receptor gene (also called AT1A) cloned in the shuttle expression vector pMT-3 was used for mutagenesis and expression as described earlier (6Noda K. Saad Y. Kinoshita A. Boyle T.P. Graham R.M. Husain A. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2284-2289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 7Feng Y.H. Miura S. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15791-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To express the AT1 receptor protein, 10 μg of purified plasmid DNA per 107 cells was used in transfection. COS1 cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method for membrane preparation. Transfected cells cultured for 72 h were harvested, and the nitrogen Parr-bomb disruption method in the presence of protease inhibitors prepared the cell membranes. The receptor expression was assessed in each case by immunoblot analysis (not shown) and by 125I-labeled [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II saturation binding analysis. Competition Binding Studies—125I-Labeled [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II binding experiments were carried out under equilibrium conditions as previously described (6Noda K. Saad Y. Kinoshita A. Boyle T.P.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15791-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For non-preincubation competition binding experiments, membranes expressing the wild-type (WT) or the mutant receptors were incubated with binding buffer (pH 7.2, 16.3 mm Na2HPO4, 3.8 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin) containing 300 pm125I-labeled [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II and various concentrations of Ang II or AT1 receptor antagonists for 1 h at 22 °C in a 125 μl total volume. For the preincubation experiments the membranes were preequilibrated with Ang II or AT1 receptor antagonists for 30 min. Nonspecific binding of the radioligand was measured in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II. Filtering the binding mixture through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters that were extensively washed with binding buffer without bovine serum albumin stopped the binding experiments. The bound ligand fraction was determined from the counts/min (cpm) remaining on the membrane. Binding kinetics values were determined using the computer program Ligand. The dissociation constant, Ki = IC50/(1 + (ligand)/Kd), values given represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Association and Dissociation Kinetics Studies—In the association experiments the membranes were incubated with 20 nm [3H]candesartan or 50 nm [3H]losartan for various time intervals between 0 and 90 min. In dissociation kinetics the membranes were incubated with 20 nm [3H]candesartan or 50 nm [3H]losartan for 90 min. Then 1 μm concentrations of unlabeled ligands were added, and the amount of specific binding after various time intervals between 0 and 90 min was counted. The dissociation rate constant (k-1) was calculated from the first-order plot of In(Bt/Beq) versus time, where Beq and Bt are the amount of specific binding at equilibrium. The observed rate constant (Kobs) was calculated from the pseudo-first-order plot of ln(Beq/(Beq - Bt)) versus time. The association rate constant (k1) was calculated from slope of Kobs versus free ligand concentration in experiments with several ligand concentrations over a 10-fold ligand concentration range. The values were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Inositol Phosphate Formation Studies—Semiconfluent COS1 cells transfected by FuGENE 6 transfection reagent in 12-well plates were labeled for 24 h with myo-[2-3H(N)]Inositol (1.5 μCi/ml; specific activity, 22 μCi/mol) at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The labeled cells were washed 2 times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm LiCl for 20 min. Ang II was then added, and incubation was continued for an additional 40 min at 37 °C. In the antagonist preincubation experiments, cells were preincubated with vehicle or antagonists for 30 min, Ang II was then added, and incubation was continued for another 40 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation the medium was removed, and the total soluble IP was extracted from the cells by perchloric acid extraction, as described previously (6Noda K. Saad Y. Kinoshita A.

The values represented were mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Molecular Modeling of the AT1 Receptor—The molecular model used the bovine rhodopsin structure (Protein Data Bank code 1F88) as a template (8Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). Using the ClustalW alignment program (Julie D. Thompson, Desmond G. Higgins, and Toby J. Gibson, European Bioinformatics Institute, Cambridge, UK), we performed the alignment of rat AT1A receptor primary sequence with the bovine rhodopsin primary sequence. The amino acid mutations were performed by Swiss-Pdb-Viewer (9Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar) followed by energy minimization using the Gromacs molecular dynamics simulation program (10Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39882) Google Scholar). During the entire modeling process the secondary structure was monitored to ensure that the AT1 secondary structure was conserved. This model was used for docking both the agonist and antagonist ligands, performed using AutoDock 3.0.5 program (27Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9301) Google Scholar). The procedure uses a Monte Carlo simulated annealing or a genetic algorithm technique for configurational exploration with rapid energy evaluation using grid-based molecular affinity potentials. Candidate Residues Specific for Insurmountable Binding of the Ligands—The competitive binding affinity of Ang II, losartan, EXP3174, and candesartan for the WT and various mutant AT1 receptors are shown in Table I. The affinity of Ang II decreased in H166G, R167Q, H183E, K199Q, and N295A mutants and was not significantly altered in H166A, H166E, R187E, H256A, Q257A, Q257E, and H272G mutants. The Ki value of the WT and all of the mutants for Ang II did not significantly change upon preincubation with competitive ligand, i.e. the unlabeled Ang II mixed with the membrane 30 min before the addition of 125I-labeled [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II in the competitive ligand binding experiments. Preincubation did not change the Ki of losartan for the WT and 12 single residue mutants, although the Ki itself was altered in H166E, R167Q, Q257E, and N295A mutants. The affinity of EXP3174 was reduced in H166E, R167Q, Q257A, Q257E, and N295A mutants. However, preincubation of EXP3174 with the WT decreased the Ki 4.4 times compared with no preincubation (adding the competing and tracer ligands together). A decreased Ki for EXP3174 upon preincubation was observed in all mutants except the Q257A and Q257E mutants. The affinity of candesartan was reduced in H166E, R167Q, K199Q, H256A, Q257A, Q257E, and N295A mutants. A 10-fold decrease in the Ki of candesartan for the WT receptor was measured upon preincubation. The preincubation-induced decrease of Ki was 3–10-fold in most mutants.

The combined effect of double mutations K199Q/H256A, K199Q/Q257A, and the H256A/Q257A on the Ki of losartan, EXP3174, and candesartan was nearly additive in comparison to each of the single mutations. The overall effect on Ki in the double mutants was nearly equal to the combined change of component single mutations. Deviation from additivity observed reflects the extent to which disruption of interaction between Lys199, His256, and Gln257 changes measured Ki. Combining all three mutations reduced the affinity >10-fold for all 3 antagonists. The affinity increase for candesartan observed upon preincubation was abolished in all four mutants. The affinity-shift for EXP3174 was also abolished in these mutants. Altogether, effects of these mutations suggest that a combinatorial interaction of residues Lys199, His256, and Gln257 is also necessary for insurmountable binding of antagonists. Effect of the Q257A Mutation on Losartan, EXP3174, and Candesartan Binding Kinetics—Fig. 2A depicts the effect of preincubation on competition binding of surmountable and insurmountable antagonists. Preincubation did not influence the losartan binding isotherm in the WT and the Q257A mutant. The binding isotherms for the insurmountable antagonists were shifted left in the WT. In the Q257A single mutant, the EXP3174 curve did not shift upon preincubation, and the magnitude of the candesartan curve-shift was significantly smaller compared with that in the WT AT1 receptor. Candesartan binding isotherm-shift induced by pre-equilibration with the drug was completely abolished in the double and triple mutants (Fig. 2B). Direct binding experiments suggest that the dissociation of the insurmountable antagonist, candesartan, from the bound receptor was slower than the dissociation of structurally analogous surmountable antagonist, losartan. The association and dissociation kinetics of [3H]losartan and [3H]candesartan for the WT and the Q257A mutant AT1 receptor were compared (Fig. 3). We did not analyze EXP3174 in this set of experiments because [3H]EXP3174 was not available to use. The observed rate of association (K1 min-1 nm-1)of 3H-candesartan with WT (0.0105 ± 0.0004) was 2.6-fold more than the rate of association of [3H]losartan with the WT (0.0271 ± 0.0002). The dissociation rate (K-1 min-1) of [3H]candesartan with WT (0.0108 ± 0.0044) was 55-fold lower than the dissociation rate of [3H]losartan with the WT (K-1 min-1, 0.595 ± 0.199). The Q257A mutation affected both association and dissociation rates of candesartan (Fig. 3). The [3H]candesartan association rate (0.00054 ± 00009) for this mutant was reduced 21-fold and the dissociation rate (0.0313 ± 0.002) was increased 2.9-fold when compared with the WT. Association of [3H]losartan with the Q257A mutant (0.0029 ± 0.0001) was 9.3-fold slower. The dissociation rate of [3H]losartan with the WT (K-1 min-1, 0.595 ± 0.199) and Q257A mutant (0.474 ± 0.026) were nearly comparable. The Ki values of WT calculated from K-1 and K1 for losartan (21.9 ± 7.2 nm) and candesartan (1.04 ± 0.46 nm) were similar to the Ki values calculated from competition binding experiments (Table I). The Ki values of Q257A mutant calculated from K-1 and K1 for both losartan (166.0 ± 6.3 nm) and candesartan (68.9 ± 6.2 nm) were, respectively, 10- and 4-fold higher than Ki values estimated from competition binding experiment in (Table I). This discrepancy, seen only in the Q257A mutant for both ligands, may be a reflection of a disproportionate effect of mutation on association rate than dissociation rate. Antagonism Pattern of Ang II-induced IP Response in the WT and Q257A Mutant AT1 Receptors—The pattern of antagonism of Ang II concentration-response in the WT and Q257A mutant suggests that display of insurmountable behavior by EXP3174 and candesartan requires the Gln257 side chain in the WT receptor (Fig. 4). The EC50 value was 0.005 ± 0.001 nm for the Ang II-induced IP production in the WT AT1 receptor-transfected cells. Pre-equilibration with insurmountable antagonists for 30 min before Ang II addition caused a rightward shift in the response curves. The EC50 values were 12.6 ± 1.4 nm with 10 nm EXP3174 and 34.3 ± 4.9 nm with 10 nm candesartan. The maximal response to Ang II decreased for both EXP3174 (77.7 ± 4.3%) and candesartan (47.5 ± 5.4%). In contrast, 100 nm losartan produced a rightward shift (EC50, 3.6 ± 0.8 nm) but did not decrease the maximal response. In the Q257A mutant transfected cells, EXP3174 and candesartan only produced a rightward shift without altering the maximal response (see Fig. 4). The EC50 values were 0.23 ± 0.11 nm with the vehicle, 1.5 ± 0.3 nm with 100 nm losartan, 4.6 ± 1.3 nm with 10 nm EXP3174, 15.4 ± 1.8 nm with 10 nm candesartan. The maximal IP responses were 96.6 ± 2% in the presence of 100 nm losartan, 96.1 ± 2% in the presence of 10 nm EXP3174, and 93.3 ± 3% in the presence of 10 nm candesartan. The transfection conditions were adjusted such that the cell surface Bmax values of the WT and mutant receptors obtained were comparable in all of the experiments. Antagonism of WT and Q257A Mutant AT1 Receptor Activation—The activation of WT and Q257A AT1 receptor inhibited by antagonists in a concentration-dependent manner is shown in Fig. 5. The intrinsic basal activity of both receptors was inhibited by all three antagonists, suggesting that their inverse agonist activity is independent of insurmountable antagonist activity (Fig. 5A). The order of potency of the antagonists was candesartan (IC50 = 8.4 ± 2.2 versus 77.1 ± 11.9 nm, respectively) > EXP3174 (IC50 = 30.3 ± 8.1 versus 523.0 ± 36.3 nm, respectively) > losartan (IC50 = 128.4 ± 21.5 versus 771.1 ± 56.7 nm, respectively) for both WT and Q257A mutant AT1-transfected cells. All of the antagonists displayed higher IC50 values with the Q257A mutant compared with WT. It appears that all three antagonists are capable of achieving nearly similar maximum inhibition in both receptors. The same pattern of antagonism was observed in Ang II-induced activation experiments (Fig. 5B). The order of potency of the antagonists was candesartan (IC50 = 2.9 ± 0.5 versus 7.9 ± 1.4 nm, respectively) > EXP3174 (IC50 = 5.0 ± 1.2 versus 32.0 ± 6.7 nm, respectively) > losartan (IC50 = 277.0 ± 42.7 versus 545.7 ± 134.6 nm, respectively) for both AT1 WT and Q257A mutant-transfected cells. EXP3174 produced the largest rightward shift in the mutant. Molecular Model of the Candesartan-AT1 Receptor Complex—A representation of the candesartan-AT1 receptor complex is shown in Fig. 6A. The free energy of binding was -92 kcal/mol for the WT-candesartan complex. The free energies were -5 to -13 kcal/mol for the Q257A-candesartan, the Q257A-EXP3174, and the WT-losartan complexes, suggesting that the binding free energies for antagonist-receptor complexes in the surmountable state are nearly comparable with each other and significantly differ from the complex in the insurmountable state. The final internal energy of the ligands were -0.49 to +0.47 kcal/mol, implying that the conformation of the ligands are not strained. With this model we aimed to investigate the relationships between the three residues, Lys199, His256, and Gln257, which were experimentally determined to contribute to the effects of insurmountable antagonists. The relative positions of these three residues in three-dimensional space is elucidated (Fig. 6B). In this conformation the distance between and α-COO- of candesartan was 4.98 Å, and the distance between Ala257 and α-COO- of candesartan was 8.18 Å. The distances between the tetrazole group of candesartan and the side chains of Lys199 and His256 were determined to range from 2.51 to 7.31 Å (Fig. 6B). In addition several neighboring aromatic and hydrophobic side chains contribute to a cluster of interactions with the biphenyl core. In the absence of candesartan, the Lys199, His256, and Gln257 were 3–6 Å apart, allowing them to be involved in a network of weak interactions. The most important result of this study is the finding that the Q257A mutation renders the AT1 receptor insensitive to insurmountable antagonism by EXP3174 and candesartan. Prein"
https://openalex.org/W2026072962,"The role of the checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) as an upstream activator of p53 following DNA damage has been controversial. We have recently shown that Chk2 and the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) are both involved in DNA damage-induced apoptosis but not G<sub>1</sub> arrest in mouse embryo fibroblasts. Here we demonstrate that Chk2 is required to activate p53 <i>in vitro</i> as measured by its ability to bind its consensus DNA target sequence following DNA damage and is in fact the previously unidentified factor working synergistically with DNA-PK to activate p53. The gene mutated in ataxia telangiectasia is not involved in this p53 activation. Using wortmannin, serine 15 mutants of p53, DNA-PK null cells and Chk2 null cells, we demonstrate that DNA-PK and Chk2 act independently and sequentially on p53. Furthermore, the p53 target of these two kinases represents a latent (preexisting) population of p53. Taken together, the results from these studies are consistent with a model in which DNA damage causes an immediate and sequential modification of latent p53 by DNA-PK and Chk2, which under appropriate conditions can lead to apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1982630340,"The functional consequences of a series of point mutations in transmembrane segment M1 of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase were analyzed in steady-state and transient kinetic experiments examining the partial reaction steps involved in Ca2+ interaction and phosphoenzyme turnover. Arginine or leucine substitution of Glu51, Glu55, or Glu58, located in the N-terminal third of M1, did not affect these functions. Arginine or leucine substitution of Asp59, located right at the bend of M1 seen in the crystal structure of the thapsigargin-bound form, caused a 10-fold increase of the rate of Ca2+ dissociation toward the cytoplasmic side. Mutation of Leu60 to alanine or proline and of Val62 to alanine also enhanced Ca2+ dissociation, whereas an 11-fold reduction of the rate of Ca2+ dissociation was observed upon alanine substitution of Leu65, thus providing evidence for a relation of the middle part of M1 to a gating mechanism controlling the dissociation of occluded Ca2+ from its membranous binding sites. Moreover, phosphoenzyme processing was affected by some of the latter mutations, in particular leucine substitution of Asp59, and alanine substitution of Leu65 accelerated the transition to ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme and blocked its dephosphorylation, thus demonstrating that this part of M1, besides being important in Ca2+ interaction, furthermore, is a critical element in the long range signaling between the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W2078361154,"The rat ileal apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (Asbt) transports conjugated bile acids in a Na+-dependent fashion and localizes specifically to the apical surface of ileal enterocytes. The mechanisms that target organic anion transporters to different domains of the ileal enterocyte plasma membrane have not been well defined. Previous studies (Sung, A.-Q., Arresa, M. A., Zeng, L., Swaby, I'K., Zhou, M. M., and Suchy, F. J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 6825–6833) from our laboratory demonstrated that rat Asbt follows an apical sorting pathway that is brefeldin A-sensitive and insensitive to protein glycosylation, monensin treatment, and low temperature shift. Furthermore, a 14-mer signal sequence that adopts a β-turn conformation is required for apical localization of rat Asbt. In this study, a vacuolar proton pump subunit (VPP-c, the 16-kDa subunit c of vacuolar H+-ATPase) has been identified as an interacting partner of Asbt by a bacterial two-hybrid screen. A direct protein-protein interaction between Asbt and VPP-c was confirmed in an in vitro pull-down assay and in an in vivo mammalian two-hybrid analysis. Indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy demonstrated that the Asbt and VPP-c colocalized in transfected COS-7 and MDCK cells. Moreover, bafilomycin A1 (a specific inhibitor of VPP) interrupted the colocalization of Asbt and VPP-c. A taurocholate influx assay and membrane biotinylation analysis showed that treatment with bafilomycin A1 resulted in a significant decrease in bile acid transport activity and the apical membrane localization of Asbt in transfected cells. Thus, these results suggest that the apical membrane localization of Asbt is mediated in part by the vacuolar proton pump associated apical sorting machinery.

Bile acids are essential for the solubilization and transport of dietary lipids and lipid-soluble nutrients and are the major products of cholesterol catabolism. Maintenance of a sufficient concentration of bile salt molecules in the enterohepatic circulation depends upon high affinity transport systems in the liver, intestine, and kidney. Bile acid transporters belong to large gene families and have been found to mediate the uptake and secretion of cholephilic compounds, contribute to cholesterol homeostasis, and be involved in bile formation. In the past decade, many of these proteins have been cloned and characterized from the liver, blood-brain barrier, placenta, kidneys, and intestine. Interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids or malfunctioning of these transporters may result in impaired bile formation and fat malabsorption. During the past decade, the regulation of bile acid transporters has been extensively studied at the transcriptional level (1Karpen S.J. J. Hepatol. 2002; 36: 832-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). By contrast, the mechanisms underlying post-translational regulation and polarized expression of bile acid transporters on the plasma membranes of the intestine and kidney cells have not been fully defined. The rat apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (Asbt) 1The abbreviations used are: Asbt, rat apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter; VPP, vacuolar proton pump; VPP-c, 16-kDa subunit c of vacuolar proton pump; B2H, BacterioMatch two-hybrid; M2H, mammalian two-hybrid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BA1, bafilomycin A1; sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, 6-((biotinoyl)amino)hexanoic acid, sulfosuccinimidyl ester sodium salt; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney. is located on the apical surface of ileal enterocytes and kidney cells and plays a major role in the recovery of bile acids in a Na+-dependent fashion (2Shneider B.L. Dawson P.A. Christie D.-M. Hardikar W. Wong M.H. Suchy F.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 745-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the Asbt gene are associated with bile acid malabsorption in human (3Montagnani M. Love M.W. Rossel P. Dawson P.A. Qvist P. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 2001; 36: 1077-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Little is known about proteins that interact with and regulate trafficking of bile acid transporters. In this study, we provide the first evidence that the 16-kDa subunit c of the vacuolar proton pump (rat VPP-c, the 16-kDa subunit c of vacuolar H+-ATPase, GenBank™ accession number NM_009729) directly interacts with Asbt and contributes to Asbt apical membrane localization. The subunit c is a highly hydrophobic proteolipid with four putative transmembrane helices and assembles into a 260-kDa Vo complex of the vacuolar proton pump (4Zhang J. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23518-23523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our result suggests an important new role for the subunit c of VPP in protein trafficking. Plasmid Construction and Clones—The BacterioMatch two-hybrid (B2H) vector, the BacterioMatch™ two-hybrid system (Stratagene), was used for cDNA library screening to search for protein-protein interactions. Fragments encoding the full coding sequence of rat Asbt were cloned into the pBT vector of the B2H system. The full coding sequence of the identified binding proteins (i.e. the 16-kDa subunit c of vacuolar proton pump) was cloned in-frame into the SalI/NotI sites of the pTRG vector to generate the plasmid pTRG-binding protein (pTRG-VPP-c). Mammalian Cell Expression Vectors—Wild type rat Asbt cDNAs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV2 at the Hind III/SalI sites as described previously (5Sun A.-Q. Ananthanarayanan M.

For the mammalian two-hybrid (M2H) system, pBIND and pACT (Promega) are fusion vectors for the linkage of proteins to the Gal4 DNA binding domain and to the VP16 transactivation domain, respectively. The segment encoding the COOH terminus of rat Asbt (amino acids 308–348) or the full coding sequence of rat Asbt was amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame into the SalI/NotI sites of pBIND fusion vector to produce the plasmid pBIND-Asbt tail and pBIND-Asbt. A complete coding sequence of the identified binding protein (VPP-c) cDNA was inserted in-frame into the SalI/NotI sites of the pACT fusion vector to produce the plasmid construct pACT-VPP-c. A cDNA fragment encoding VPP-c was also inserted in-frame into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (+)A vector to produce the Myc-His-epitope-tagged construct, VPP-c-MH. The bacterial expression vector pGEX-3X (Invitrogen) was used to produce glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. The full coding sequence of VPP-c was subcloned in-frame into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-3X to produce the GST-fused plasmid constructs. All of the positive clones containing cDNA inserts were identified by restriction enzyme mapping and sequenced using the ABI automated DNA sequencer model 377 at the DNA Core Facility, Mount Sinai School of Medicine. BacterioMatch Two-hybrid System XR Plasmid cDNA Library Screen and Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—A library screen based on the B2H system was performed to identify proteins that interact with rat Asbt. In this study, the mouse kidney BacterioMatch™ two-hybrid system XR cDNA library in the pTRG plasmid (Stratagene) was screened with the constructed pBT-Asbt using the protocol provided by the manufacturer with some modification. Briefly, pBT-Asbt and pTRG-cDNA library plasmids were first introduced into B2H reporter strain, and transformants were selected on LB-CTCK plates (LB-agar plates supplemented with 250 μg/ml carbenicillin, 15 μg/ml tetracycline, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin). Then, the selected colonies were screened for β-galactosidase activity by growth on X-gal indicator plates (LB-agar plates supplemented with 15 μg/ml tetracycline, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 80 μg/ml X-gal, and 0.2 mm β-galactosidase inhibitor (phenylethyl β-d-thiogalactoside)) for 17–30 h at 30 °C. To confirm the detected protein-protein interactions, we then retransformed the reporter strain with the isolated target plasmid plus bait plasmid as described by the manufacturer. In Vitro Binding Assay (GST Pull Down)—For expression of the GST fusion proteins, the appropriate plasmids (GST-VPP-c, see above for coordinates) were transformed into E. coli DH5α (Invitrogen). The fusion proteins were affinity-purified on glutathione-agarose beads as described by Liu et al. (7Liu C.J. Wang H. Lengyel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli DH5α cells and induced by the addition of 0.5∼2mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The harvested bacteria were homogenized in extraction buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin) and centrifuged to remove the insoluble proteins and cell debris right after the extraction process. The extracts were mixed with 200 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 5 min. The Sepharose beads were washed with extraction buffer and used for the GST pull-down assay or GST affinity chromatography. The purity of the fusion proteins was verified by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE, and the concentration was determined by a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). To examine the binding of VPP-c with rat Asbt in vitro, the GST pull-down experiments were performed by using ProFound™ pull-down GST protein:protein interaction kit (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. The bound proteins were denatured in sample buffer and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and were detected by immunoblotting with anti-Asbt antibodies as described previously (5Sun A.-Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Soroka C.J. Thevananther S. Shneider B. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1045-G1055PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay for Proteins Interaction in Vivo— When cell cultures reached about 50% confluence, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with 1 μg each of the pBIND-Asbt and pACT-VPP plasmids using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Plasmid pUC19 was used as a carrier to bring the total amount of DNA in the transfection solution to 3 μg. The cultures were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed. The firefly luciferase activity was determined according to manufacturer's recommendations. Cell Culture and Chemical Treatments—COS-7 (SV40 transformed monkey kidney fibroblast) and MDCK II (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells were used in this study. The plasmid pCMV2-Asbt was used to transiently transfect COS-7 for the GST pull-down assay. pBIND-Asbt and pACT-VPP-c were used to transiently cotransfect COS-7 for M2H. The MDCK II cells were stably cotransfected with pCMV2-Asbt and VPP-c-MH plasmids for confocal microscopy analysis. Cell culture and DNA transfection of cells were performed as described previously (5Sun A.-Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Soroka C.J. Thevananther S. Shneider B. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1045-G1055PubMed Google Scholar). For bafilomycin A1 (BA1) treatment, the cotransfected cells were incubated with 50 nm bafilomycin A1 (Sigma) in culture medium for 16 h at 37 °C. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was carried out as described previously (5Sun A.-Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Soroka C.J. Thevananther S. Shneider B. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1045-G1055PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on a confluent monolayer of transfected cells cultured on glass coverslips. The cells were fixed and permeabilized for 7 min in methanol at -20 °C, followed by rehydration in PBS. Nonspecific sites were blocked with normal goat serum for 60 min at room temperature. The primary antibody was diluted in the blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in a humid chamber. After washing with PBS for 15–30 min, the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red for 1 h. After being washed with PBS, the cells on coverslips were inverted onto a drop of VectaShield. Fluorescence was examined with a Leica TCS-SP (UV) four-channel confocal laser scanning microscope in the Imaging Core Facility Microscopy Center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the COOH-terminal 14 amino acid of rat Asbt and mouse anti-Myc antibodies was used for this study as described previously (5Sun A.-Q. Ananthanarayanan M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6825-6833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Bile Acid Influx Assay—Na+-dependent taurocholate influx assays were performed as described previously using a transwell filter culture system (5Sun A.-Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Soroka C.J. Thevananther S. Shneider B. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1045-G1055PubMed Google Scholar). Domain-selected biotinylation was performed essentially as described by Lisanti et al. (8Lisanti M.P. Sargiacomo M. Graeve L. Saltiel A.R. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9557-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and Altin et al. (9Altin J.G. Pagler E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, polarized monolayers of transfected cells grown on 24-mm transwell filters were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2 (PBS-C/M). Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) (0.5 mg/ml in PBS-C/M, pH 8.5) was added either to the apical or basolateral compartment of the filter chamber. Compartments not receiving sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin were filled with an equivalent volume of PBS-C/M alone. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, filter chambers were washed with ice-cold PBS-C/M. Three filter chambers were used for each experimental condition. After extraction with 1% SDS, the biotinylated transporters were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Identification of Asbt-associated Proteins by BacterioMatch Two-hybrid Library Screening—A cDNA library screening based on the BacterioMatch two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins that interact with rat Asbt. For this purpose, the rat Asbt coding sequence was subcloned into plasmid pBT (pBT-Asbt) to serve as bait. A mouse kidney BacterioMatch two-hybrid system XR cDNA library in the pTRG plasmid was screened with the constructed pBT-Asbt. We screened about 2.5 million clones and identified more than 50 positive clones grown on LB-CTCK agar plates. These positive clones were then tested on X-gal indicator plates, and 18 of them showed increased β-galactosidase activity (data not show), indicating a possible protein-protein interaction. After isolation and purification of the selected clones, the plasma DNAs were sequenced. The DNA sequence analysis revealed that the clone number 13 (pTRG-13) matched the full sequence encoding the mouse 16-kDa subunit c of the vacuolar proton pump. The amino acid sequence of mouse VPP subunit c is identical to the sequence of the rat protein (GenBank™ accession number NM_130823) (10Nezu J-I. Motojima K. Tamura H-O. Ohkuma S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To further verify the interaction between Asbt and VPP-c from the library screening, the mouse/rat VPP subunit c coding sequence was subcloned into pTRG plasmid (pTRG-VPP-c). The purified pBT-Asbt and pTRG-VPP-c constructs were cotransformed into the bacterial reporter strain and tested on LB-CTCK and X-gal indicator plates. All transformants (coexpression of VPP-c and Asbt) grew well on the LB-CTCK plate (Fig. 1, left panel) and had strong β-galactosidase activity (blue) on the X-gal indicator plates (Fig. 1, right panel). The negative control (pBT-GF2/pTRG-vector) showed no β-galactosidase activity (white). Interaction between Asbt and VPP-c in Vitro (GST Pull-down Assay)—An in vitro interaction between Asbt and VPP-c was verified using the GST pull-down assay. First, the cDNA coding sequence of VPP-c was subcloned into pGEX3X vector to generate a GST-fused VPP-c (GST-VPP-c), and the fusion protein was expressed in the DH5α bacterial strain. Affinity-purified GST and GST-VPP-c immobilized to the glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with lysates of Asbt expressing COS-7 cells. The bound proteins eluted from the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The proteins were then detected using a specific rat Asbt COOH-terminal anti-peptide antibody. Fig. 2 shows that purified GST did not pull down Asbt in this assay (A, lane 4), whereas GST-VPP-c efficiently pulled down a non-glycosylated Asbt protein (A, lane 3, ∼34 kDa). To further verify the possibility of direct interaction of Asbt with VPP-c, the bound proteins from GST pull-down experiments were denatured in sample buffer, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and detected by Coomassie Blue staining. The results show that a single protein (a ∼34-kDa band) was pulled down by GST-VPP-c (Fig. 2B, lane 2), but no protein was bound by GST-Sepharose (B, lane 3). This suggests that Asbt interacts with VPP-c directly. Examination of Protein-Protein Interaction by in Vivo Mammalian Two-hybrid Luciferase Assay—To further confirm the interaction of Asbt and VPP-c in mammalian cells, we performed a mammalian two-hybrid assay in which the expression of the firefly luciferase gene was driven by Gal4-specific enhancer elements. The complete coding sequence of rat Asbt cDNA was inserted in-frame into the SalI/NotI sites of the pBIND fusion vector (pBIND-Asbt). A cDNA fragment encoding the complete coding region of VPP-c was generated by PCR and was inserted in-frame into the SalI/NotI sites of the pACT fusion vector (pACT-VPP-c). The two constructs were cotransfected into COS-7 cells. To examine the importance of the cytoplasmic tail of Asbt in protein binding to VPP-c, a cDNA encoding the 40-amino acid cytoplasmic tail fragment of Asbt was also inserted in-frame into the SalI/NotI sites of the pBIND fusion vector (pBIND-Asbt tail) and cotransfected with pACT-VPP-c into the cells. By analogy to the B2H system, the interaction between Asbt and VPP-c brings together the Gal4D binding domain and the VP16 transactivation domain of the fusion proteins and activates the luciferase reporter gene in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 shows that a more than 10-fold increase of luciferase activity was observed in Asbt and VPP-c cotransfected cells compared with non-transfected cells. Therefore, any post-translational modifications that may occur in mammalian cells, but are absent in bacteria, do not interfere with the interaction of Asbt and VPP-c. However, only a slight increase of luciferase activity was observed in cells cotransfected with Asbt-tail and VPP-c cDNAs (Fig. 3). Colocalization of Asbt and VPP-c in Transfected Mammalian Cells—Next, we examined the subcellular localization of Asbt and VPP-c. A Myc-epitope-fused VPP-c (VPP-c-MH) and rat Asbt were cotransfected into COS-7 or MDCK cells. In transfected COS-7 cells, colocalization of Asbt and VPP-c-MH was detected in a punctate cytoplasmic and perinuclear pattern (Fig. 4I, C and D, yellow). Because the flat cells of non-polarized MDCK cells would be better for the visualization of protein colocalization, we selected the flat non-polarized MDCK cells for this study. In transfected MDCK cells, the colocalization of Asbt and VPP-c was observed near the nuclear region (Fig. 4II, C and D, yellow). This is in agreement with the physical interactions detected in the two-hybrid and pull-down assays and suggests that in transfected MDCK cells, the membrane sorting of Asbt may be mediated in part by the VPP-c and through other unknown sorting mechanisms. The Effect of Bafilomycin A1 on Membrane Localization of Asbt—To examine a possible role of VPP-c in the cellular trafficking of Asbt, we pretreated the cotransfected cells with 50 nm bafilomycin A1 (BA1), a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar proton pump, for 16 h at 37 °C. The confocal image shows that BA1 treatment significantly interrupted Asbt and VPP-c-MH subcellular distribution and colocalization in both COS-7 (Fig. 4III) and MDCK cells (Fig. 4IV). In contrast to the colocalization of Asbt with VPP-c-MH shown as yellow, the distinct localization of VPP-c-MH and Asbt is seen as separate green and red labels, respectively (Fig. 4, III and IV, D). After treatment with BA1, a diffuse cytoplasmic staining was observed for VPP-c-MH in both COS-7 and MDCK cells (Fig. 4, III and IV, A). In both COS-7 and MDCK cells, a significant increase in the amount of Asbt protein accumulated intracellularly at endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi regions after BA1 treatment (Fig. 4, III and IV, B). To further verify the effect of BA1 treatment on the membrane distribution of Asbt, the polarized taurocholate influx assay and domain-specific biotinylation experiments were performed in transfected MDCK cells. Fig. 5 (left panel) shows that the initial taurocholate influx activity decreased more than 30% after BA1 treatment compared with that of BA1-untreated MDCK cells. Similarly, biotinylation analysis demonstrated that the apical membrane distribution of Asbt proteins was significantly decreased by about 26.2 ± 4.1% after BA1 treatment compared with that of BA1-untreated MDCK cells (Fig. 5, center and right). Thus, these results indicate further that the VPP-c interacts with Asbt and may contribute, at least partially, to the apical membrane localization of Asbt in epithelial cells. The physiologic functions of ion transporters are determined in part by their subcellular distributions and a complex interaction of protein molecules modulating their activities and intracellular trafficking (11Kipp H. Arias I. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Sorting signal motifs for apical membrane targeting, such as N- and O-glycosylation, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, and PDZ binding sequence, have been reported (8Lisanti M.P. Sargiacomo M. Graeve L. Saltiel A.R. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9557-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 12Caplan M.J. Am. J.

Most recent studies demonstrated that a Tyr-based sorting signal motif and β-turn structure are also involved in the apical targeting of Megalin (14Takeda T. Yamazaki H. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1105-C1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and Asbt (15Sun A.-Q. Salkar R. Xu Sachchidanand S. Zeng L. Zhou M.M. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4000-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), respectively. This suggests that the more precise structural features and possibly a tissue-specific regulator may be important as determinants for apical membrane sorting. Over the past decades, studies of various membrane trafficking steps have indicated that specific proteins (e.g. clathrin-coated complex Munc18-2, syntaxin 3, dynein, and PDZ domain-containing proteins) play a role in regulation of apical protein localization (16Kamal A.

These factors may be directly or indirectly associated with the sorted proteins and cooperate with each other to generate targeting specificity in the secretory pathway (21Waters M.G. Pfeffer S.R. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Some membrane proteins (e.g. matrix metalloproteinases) contain multiple sorting signal motifs and are regulated by several sorting factors and sorting mechanisms (22Pei D. Kang T. Qi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33988-33997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Saunders C. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19035-19045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The vacuolar H+-ATPases are a family of ATP-dependent proton pumps (VPP) that reside predominantly within intracellular membrane compartments including endosomes, lysosomes, cathrin-coated vesicles, and the Golgi complex (24Nakhoul N.L Hamm L.L. J. Nephrol. 2002; 15: 22-31PubMed Google Scholar, 25Forgac M. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 71-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The acidic luminal pH within these organelles and vesicles of the secretory pathway is established by vacuolar H+-ATPases and is vital for processes such as intracellular membrane transport, receptor-mediated endocytosis, protein processing and degradation, and intracellular targeting of lysosomal enzymes (24Nakhoul N.L Hamm L.L.

Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref Scopus (999) Google Scholar). They are multisubunit heteromeric proteins composed of two structural domains, a peripheral catalytic V1 domain and a membrane-spanning Vo domain. The Vo domain is responsible for proton translocation, and the V1 domain is responsible for ATP hydrolysis. All of the subunits of the H+-V-ATPase (VPP) have been now identified and many of their structural and molecular properties characterized (24Nakhoul N.L Hamm L.L. J. Nephrol. 2002; 15: 22-31PubMed Google Scholar). The integral Vo domain of the V-ATPase complex composed of five different subunits (a, c, c′, c″, and d) mediates proton translocation. Six copies of the c subunit are found in the Vo complex. The 16-kDa subunit c is highly hydrophobic and contains four putative transmembrane helices (4Zhang J. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23518-23523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref Scopus (999) Google Scholar). These subunits appear to remain tightly associated with the Vo domain through protein-protein interaction. Previous studies have demonstrated that VPP is required for proper vesicular trafficking through the trans-Golgi network (34van Weert A.W. Geuze H.J. Stoorvogel W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 417-423PubMed Google Scholar) and/or Golgi to plasma membrane delivery of proteins (35Yilla M. Tan A. Ito K. Miwa K. Ploegh H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19092-19100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In both the kidney and reproductive tract, VPP-rich cells have a high rate of apical membrane recycling. VPP molecules are transported between the cell surface and the cytoplasm in vesicles that have a well defined “coat” structure (36Brown D. Breton S. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). van Weert et al. (34van Weert A.W. Geuze H.J. Stoorvogel W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 417-423PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that inhibition of the VPP by bafilomycin A1 induces retrograde transport of proteins from the trans-Golgi network into the Golgi. Palokangas et al. (37Palokangas H. Ying M. Vaananen K. Saraste J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3561-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) indicated that VPP might be involved with the early secretory pathway and retrograde transport from the pre-Golgi intermediate compartment and the Golgi complex. Interactions between VPP and the microtubule or microfilament-based cytoskeletons have been found in osteoclasis and intercalated cells (33Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The Vo domain of V-ATPase appears to have a direct role independent of proton pumping in membrane fusion that is essential for intracellular membrane trafficking along biosynthetic and endocytic routes (33Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that VPP may directly and/or indirectly interact with other proteins (38Jansen E.J. Holthuis J.C. McGrouther C. Burbach J.P. Martens G.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2999-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In HepG2 cells, the function of VPP is critical to achieving timely secretion and correct N-linked glycan modifications of proteins that follow the constitutive secretory pathway (35Yilla M. Tan A. Ito K. Miwa K. Ploegh H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19092-19100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Geyer et al. (39Geyer M. Fackler O.T. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) demonstrated that existence of a shared domain in three different families of proteins, Subunit H of the VPP, β-adaptins, and β-subunit of COPI. Moreover, Geyer et al. (40Geyer M. Yu H. Mandic R. Linnemann T. Zheng Y.H. Fackler O.T. Peterlin B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28521-28529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) suggest that the H subunit of VPP can function as an adaptor for interactions between Nef and AP-2. Mandic et al. (31Mandic R. Fackler O.T. Geyer M. Linnemann T. Zheng Y.H. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) showed that the negative factor from simian immunodeficiency virus binds to the catalytic subunit H of VPP to internalize CD4 and to increase viral infectivity. Miura et al. (41Miura K. Miyazawa S. Furuta S. Mitsushita J. Kamijo K. Ishida H. Miki T. Suzukawa K. Resau J. Copeland T.D. Kamata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46276-46283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have shown that the E subunit of VPP by direct interaction with mSos1 may participate in the regulation of the mSos1-dependent Rac1 signaling pathway involved in growth factor receptor-mediated cell growth control. The 16-kDa subunit c of VPP has been reported to interact with several proteins, such as p12I protein (42Koralnik I.J. Mulloy J.C. Andresson T. Fullen J. Franchini G. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1909-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The 16-kDa subunit c is also capable of forming gap junctions and binding with β1 integrin independently of ATPase activity (28Skinner M.A. Wildeman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23119-23127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The subunit c of VPP may also interact with F-actin, and thus may function as an anchor protein regulating the linkage between VPP and the actin-based cytoskeleton (43Vitavska O. Wieczorek H. Merzendorfer H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18499-18505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Goldstein et al. (27Goldstein D.J. Andresson T. Sparkowski J.J. Schlegel R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4851-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) demonstrated that hydrophobic intramembrane interactions govern the association of E5, 16-kDa subunit c of VPP, and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, suggesting a ligand-independent mechanism for receptor activation and a potential link between receptor signal transduction pathways and membrane pore activity. An association of V-ATPase with a calcium-releasing channel and the CIC-5 chloride channel have been defined also (33Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Asbt apical membrane targeting has not been fully established. Previous studies (15Sun A.-Q. Salkar R. Xu Sachchidanand S. Zeng L. Zhou M.M. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4000-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) from our laboratory demonstrated that rat Asbt follows an apical sorting pathway that is brefeldin A-sensitive and insensitive to protein glycosylation, monensin treatment, and low temperature shift. Furthermore, a 14-mer signal sequence that adopts a β-turn conformation is required for apical localization of rat Asbt (15Sun A.-Q. Salkar R. Xu Sachchidanand S. Zeng L. Zhou M.M. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4000-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study, the VPP-c has been identified as an interacting partner of Asbt. The results shown that the VPP-c interacts with non-glycosylated Asbt. Bafilomycin treatment caused the accumulation of the Asbt protein largely at perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi regions and a decrease in the initial apical taurocholate transport activity in Asbt-transfected cells. Recent studies (33Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 44Bowman B. Bowman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3965-3972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) have identified subunit c as a key part of the binding site for the highly specific V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A. Zhang et al. (4Zhang J. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23518-23523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that bafilomycin also binds to a 100-kDa subunit of Vo complexes. There are several possible explanations for these effects of bafilomycin on the Asbt membrane sorting in transfected cells. 1) The 16-kDa subunit c of V-ATPase containing the binding site for the inhibitor bafilomycin may contribute to the directional sorting of Asbt from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane. 2) It is possible that as a result of bafilomycin binding to the 100-kDa subunit of Vo, the conformations of other Vo subunits including subunit c have been altered. These conformational changes of VPP-c may interfere with the interaction of VPP-c with Asbt and thereby partially interrupt Asbt membrane sorting. 3) Previous studies (4Zhang J. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23518-23523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the Vo domain remains assembled as a 260-kDa complex even after dissociation of the V1 subunits and that the clathrin-coated vesicles contain a significant population of Vo domains not complexed with V1 subunits. The bafilomycin treatment may alter vesicle movement and inhibit trafficking of the transporters to the cell surface. 4) The process of vesicle acidification is also likely to play a role in proper targeting of Asbt to the apical membrane, particularly in the Golgi because the 16-kDa subunit c is associated with the non-glycosylated form of Asbt. However, the effects of V-ATPase on trafficking of Asbt may transcend its properties as a proton pump. There are a number of yet to be defined steps in which V-ATPase and/or its subunit c of the Vo domain may influence the continuous flow of membranes leading to the correct targeting of Asbt to the apical membrane. In transfected MDCK cells, the Asbt protein partially overlaps with VPP-c and bafilomycin treatment results only in partial interruption of apical membrane localization and initial taurocholate transport activity of Asbt. These results suggest that Asbt apical membrane sorting may involve a VPP-c-mediated pathway and other unknown mechanism(s) in epithelial cells. Multiple apical targeting mechanisms for G-protein-coupled receptors in polarized renal epithelial cells have been reported by Saunders and Limbird (23Saunders C. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19035-19045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our previous studies show that the cytoplasmic tail of rat Asbt is important for its apical membrane localization. However, in the M2H system, only a slight increase of luciferase activity was observed in the Asbt-tail and VPP-c cotransfected cells. This suggests that the tail of Asbt may only weakly interact with VPP-c and/or the cytoplasmic tail of Asbt alone may not sufficient for binding VPP-c. To understand how the Asbt and VPP-c proteins interact with each other requires further investigation."

The expression of CFTR transcripts and cAMP-activated chloride currents in the heart have been demonstrated for humans and simians (18Warth J. Collier M. Hart P. Geary Y. Gelband C. Chapman T.

Cardiol. 1991; 23: 1191-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that CFTR transcripts expressed in the heart are alternatively spliced, resulting in the loss of exon 5 (25Hart P. Warth J. Levesque P. Collier M. Geary Y. Horowitz B. Hume J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6343-6348Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that CFTR mRNA is expressed in an epicardial (higher) to endocardial (lower) gradient across the left ventricular free wall (LVFW) of the rabbit heart, coinciding with a 2.5:1 gradient in the cAMP-activated chloride current density in ventricular myocytes (26Wong K. Trezise A. Bryant S. Hart G. Vandenberg J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1403-H1409PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this epicardial to endocardial gradient in CFTR expression is developmentally regulated, appearing in the first postnatal week (27Wong K. Trezise A. Vandenberg J. Mech. Dev. 2000; 94: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and lost in hypertrophic and failing hearts (28Wong K. Trezise A. Crozatier B. Vandenberg J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The cardiac distributions of CFTR mRNA and functional channels are consistent with a role in the maintenance of the normal epicardial to endocardial gradients of ventricular repolarization and action potential duration in the heart (14Gadsby D. Nagel G. Hwang T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 387-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Wong K. Trezise A. Bryant S. Hart G. Vandenberg J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1403-H1409PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the overall reduction and loss of the gradient of CFTR expression during hypertrophy could contribute to delayed ventricular repolarization (29Hart G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 933-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and loss of the gradient of repolarization in hypertrophied hearts (30Antzelevitch C. Sicouri S. Lukas A. Nesterenko V. Liu D. DiDiego J. Cardiac Electrophysiology: From Cell to Bedside. W. B. Saunders, New York1995Google Scholar), both of which are known to be arrhythmogenic (31Marban E. Molecular Basis of Cardiovascular Disease. W. B. Saunders, New York1999Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown that some CF patients exhibit an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia (32Cheron G. Paradis K. Steru D. Demay G. Lenoir G. Acta Paediatr. Scand. 1984; 73: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 33Sullivan M. Moss R. Hindi R. Lewiston N. Chest. 1986; 90: 239-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); however, it is difficult to distinguish between a primary genetic cause due to the loss of CFTR expression and secondary effects as a result of pathological manifestations in the pulmonary system. In this study, we investigated the regulation of temporal, regional, and pathological changes in CFTR expression in the rabbit heart. We show that the majority of CFTR transcripts expressed in the heart initiate at unique transcription start sites and include novel alternative 5′-exons that replace the traditional CFTR exon 1. These alternative 5′-exons encode (a) a series of short upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR), resulting in post-transcriptional regulation of CFTR expression, and (b) a unique translation initiation codon, in-frame with the main CFTR open reading frame (ORF), which results in a CFTR polypeptide with a distinct amino terminus. Modulation in the levels of these cardiac-specific CFTR transcripts is responsible for the temporal, spatial, and pathological changes in CFTR expression observed in the heart. Finally, the distal localization of these cardiac-specific, alternative 5′-exons upstream of the traditional CFTR exon 1 suggests the presence of a distinct promoter region directing CFTR expression in the heart. Total RNA Source and Preparation—Triplicate New Zealand White rabbit tissue samples were collected from heart (embryo day 29, neonate day 7, juvenile week 3, adult year 1; left and right ventricular free wall, sham-operated control, and aortic-banded hypertrophy) and adult year 1 duodenum (control). All atrial tissue was removed from each cardiac sample harvested, except for embryo day 29, where whole hearts were used. Atrial tissue contributes less than 10% of the tissue weight to the embryo day 29 samples and will not significantly affect the comparison of CFTR expression during development. Moderate cardiac hypertrophy was induced in adult rabbits as previously described (34Guarnieri C. Muscari C. Caldarera C. Adv. Myocardiol. 1985; 5: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), resulting in an increased heart weight-to-body weight ratio of 26 ± 2%. Sham-operated animals underwent aortic mobilization, but were not banded. Adult LVFW samples were dissected into three equal parts, along both the apical to basal and epicardial to endocardial axes, and the outer portions located at the apical epicardial, basal epicardial, apical endocardial, and basal endocardial surfaces were taken for further analysis. All procedures were performed in accordance with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986. Fresh tissues were homogenized in guanidinium thiocyanate solution (Fluka), and total RNA was isolated according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (35Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5′-RACE)—CFTR transcription start sites were identified by 5′-RACE as previously described (11White N. Higgins C. Trezise A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 3: 363-369Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed using a CFTR exon 6 reverse primer (Table I). First-strand cDNAs, tailed with dCTP, were subject to two rounds of hemi-nested PCR using reverse primers to exons 4, 3, or 2 and an anchor primer to the dC tail. Amplicons were sequenced directly and subcloned into pLITMUS 28 (New England Biolabs).Table IOligonucleotide and probe sequences used for 5′-RACE PCR and TaqMan qPCRPrimerSequenceDescriptionAnchor primer/F5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG-3′Anneals to poly dC-tailRC2/R5′-TTTGGTATATGTCTGACAATTCCAGGCGCT-3′5′-RACE rabbit CFTR exon 2RC3/R5′-ACACCTCCGAAGGGCATTATTGAGCTTAGG-3′5′-RACE rabbit CFTR exon 3RC4/R5′-ACAAAGAGTAAGCACAGACCTATGCCCAGG-3′5′-RACE rabbit CFTR exon 4RC6/R5′-CCAGCTCTCTGATCCCTGTACTTCATCATC-3′5′-RACE rabbit CFTR exon 6Exon —1C/F5′-AACACGCTGTTATTCCTCACCTG-3′TaqMan qPCR CFTR exon —1CExon —1B/F5′-GCTCTAGTGAAGATGGTCTACTTGATGA-3′TaqMan qPCR CFTR exon —1BExon —1A/F5′-CATCAGAGTTGCACGAATCACAT-3′TaqMan qPCR CFTR exon —1ATraditional exon 1/F5′-GAGAGACCATGCAGAAGTCGC-3′TaqMan qPCR CFTR traditional exon 1Exon 2/R5′-CTGCAGAATCAGCAGAAGGGA-3′TaqMan qPCR CFTR exon 2Exon 4/F5′-GCAGATGAGAATAGCCATGTTCAG-3′TaqMan qPCR CFTR exon 4Exon 5/F5′-CTCCTTTCCAACAACCTGAACAA-3′TaqMan qPCR CFTR exon 5Exon 6/R5′-GAAAGCAAGGCCGCAGAA-3′TaqMan qPCR CFTR exon 6Exon 2/F5′-CTGGACTAGACCGATTTTGAGAAAAGGATACAGACA-3′TaqMan qPCR CFTRexon 2 probeExon 6/F5′-ACCTCTGCAAGTGACTCTGCTGATGGG-3′TaqMan qPCR CFTRexon 6 probe Open table in a new tab Northern Blot Analysis—Rabbit CFTR cDNA (courtesy of Professor Burton Horowitz, University of Nevada School of Medicine, Reno, NV) was random-primer radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci mm, Amersham Biosciences; DECAprime II system, Ambion). Total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% (w/v) denaturing agarose gel, transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), incubated with labeled probe, and then washed as previously described (13Trezise A. Buchwald M. Higgins C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 801-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Autoradiography was with Hyperfilm MP x-ray film (Amersham Biosciences) for 5 days. TaqMan Quantitative PCR (qPCR)—Relative CFTR expression was quantified using cDNA primed with random hexamer (500 ng) with transcript-specific forward primers (exons –1C, –1B, –1A, 1, 4, and 5), reverse primers and probes (exons 2 and 6), all designed to cross at least one exon-exon boundary (Table I). The 5′-reporter and 3′-quencher dyes used for CFTR probes were 6-carboxyfluorescein and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine, respectively, whereas the 18 S rRNA probe used the VIC reporter dye (Applied Biosystems). Each qPCR reaction consisted of 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), forward and reverse primers (250 nm), probe (50 nm), and cDNA template (100 ng). Triplicate experimental CFTR and endogenous 18 S rRNA reactions were performed using three independent cDNA samples from different animals. Reporter dye fluorescence was detected using an Applied Biosystems Prism 7700 Sequence Detector, and data were analyzed using Sequence Detector software version 1.6.3 (Applied Biosystems). Quantification of CFTR gene expression, relative to 18 S rRNA, was performed using the comparative threshold cycle method according to instructions from the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). Construction of CFTR-Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) Fusion Constructs and Cell Culture—CFTR cDNA fragments containing each alternative or traditional exon 1 sequence plus exon 2 were ligated to the eGFP cDNA (Clontech) and the entire fragment subcloned into the pIRESneo mammalian expression vector (Clontech). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (ATCC, CRL-9096; courtesy of Dr. Yu Lu, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom) were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 4 mml-glutamine, 18 mm sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mm hypoxanthine, and 16 μm thymidine (Invitrogen). Triplicate wells of 60% confluent CHO cells were transiently co-transfected with 1 μg each of CFTR-eGFP and control enhanced blue fluorescent protein (eBFP) constructs, using LipofectAMINE according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Invitrogen). After 72 h of incubation, cells were trypsinized and transferred to a Thermo-Fast 96 black PCR plate (Abgene). Enhanced GFP and eBFP fluorescence was measured using a SPECTRAmax GEMINI-XS spectrofluorometer (36Lydford S. Giller T. MAXline Application Note 44; Measurement of Green Fluorescent Protein in the SPECTRAmax GEMINI Spectrofluorometer. Molecular Devices, United Kingdom2001Google Scholar, 37McGown E. MAXline Application Note 30; Selecting Excitation and Emission Wavelengths Using the SPECTRAmax GEMINI Microplate Spectrofluorometer: Basic Principles. Molecular Devices, United Kingdom1999Google Scholar). Prior calibration experiments determined the following optimal parameters: for eGFP, λex = 472 nm, λem = 512 nm, and λcutoff = 495 nm; and for eBFP, λex = 378 nm, λem = 445 nm, and λcutoff = 420 nm. To correct for differences in transfection efficiency, eGFP fluorescence values were normalized to eBFP signal. Background fluorescence (untransfected cells) was subtracted. Bioinformatic and Statistical Analyses—Messenger RNA secondary structures were predicted using MFold version 3.1 (38Mathews D. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar, 39Zuker M. Mathews D. Turner D. RNA Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1999Google Scholar). CFTR amino-terminal hydropathy plots were generated using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm (40Kyte J. Doolittle R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar). Protein secondary structures were predicted by PSIPRED version 2.4 (41Jones D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4500) Google Scholar). The charge distribution for the putative CFTR amino-terminal helix was predicted by helical wheel analyses using MacPlasmap Pro version 3.01. Statistical comparisons were made using Student's t tests (unpaired, two-tailed), and a p value of less than 0.05 was taken to indicate that a change in transcript level was of statistical significance. CFTR Transcripts Expressed in Rabbit Heart Include Multiple Alternative 5′-Exons—The major in vivo transcription start sites of CFTR transcripts expressed in the heart were identified by 5′-RACE. Typical examples of 5′-RACE products obtained from adult LVFW and duodenal (control) tissues are shown in Fig. 1A. Sequencing of 5′-RACE amplicons revealed extensive variation in transcription start site and exon 1 usage in different tissues and at different developmental stages. In adult duodenal tissues, a single transcription start site was identified 74 bp upstream of the first base of the translation initiation codon in traditional rabbit CFTR exon 1 (CFTRTRAD-74). The nucleotide sequence was identical to the published rabbit CFTR cDNA and promoter sequences (GenBank™ accession nos. OC40227 and X95931). Similarly, CFTR transcripts expressed in embryonic cardiac ventricle initiated in traditional exon 1, but included some 65 additional nucleotides and initiated transcription at position –139 bp (CFTRTRAD-139) (Fig. 1B; GenBank™ accession no. AY256889). In adult and neonatal cardiac ventricle, as well as hypertrophic heart, multiple in vivo transcription start sites were identified (Fig. 1, A and B). Collectively, sequence analysis revealed three new alternative 5′-CFTR exons, designated exon –1C, exon –1B, and exon –1A, respectively (GenBank™ accession nos. AY256886–AY256888). Exon –1C and exon –1B are spliced directly to exon 2, with exon –1A subject to alternative splicing between exons –1C and 2 (CFTR–1C, CFTR–1B, and CFTR–1C/–1A transcripts). All splice donor and acceptor sequences satisfied the GT-AG rule (42Mount S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 14: 1319-1324Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows the genomic structure and alternative splicing of CFTR transcripts expressed in the heart. In all cases, amplification reactions from control untailed cDNA were negative. Identical CFTR transcription start sites were mapped using three independent samples for all tissue types, confirming the precise location of each identified transcription start site and ensuring artifacts caused by partial mRNA degradation were avoided. Transcripts that included exon –1A contain an AUG codon in-frame with the main CFTR ORF. Translation initiation from this AUG codon would result in CFTR protein with a novel amino-terminal region. Exons –1B and –1C did not contain an AUG codon in-frame with the main CFTR ORF. However, many upstream AUGs (uAUGs) were identified in the 5′-UTR of CFTR transcripts including exons –1C, –1B, or –1A, and a single uAUG codon was identified in the 5′-UTR of CFTRTRAD-139. These uAUGs defined the start of several uORFs, which were followed by translation termination codons and thus encoded short peptides. The presence of short uORFs in the 5′-UTRs of eukaryotic mRNA transcripts is indicative of post-transcriptional and translational regulation of gene expression (43Vilela C. Ramirez C. Linz B. Rodrigues-Pousada C. McCarthy J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3139-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Data base comparisons of each putative short polypeptide sequence revealed no homology to known protein sequences. Genomic DNA Structure and Transcriptional Control of CFTR Expression in the Heart—Rabbit genomic DNA (gDNA) spanning CFTR exon –1C to exon –1A, was amplified by long range PCR and the sequence compared with the human and mouse gDNA sequences (GenBank™ accession nos. AC000111 and AF162137; see Fig. 1C and supplemental data (available in the on-line version of this article) showing dot matrix comparisons of rabbit, mouse, and human sequences). We also compared CFTR traditional exon 1 and flanking sequences across the three species. In both exonic and intronic gDNA regions, human and rabbit sequences showed a high level of identity for both the CFTR exon –1C to –1A region and traditional exon 1 (Fig. 1C). However, only CFTR traditional exon 1 sequences showed any similarity between the mouse and the other species. The human homologues of rabbit CFTR exons –1C to –1A spanned a region located 6–9 kb upstream of the traditional human CFTR exon 1. Further, the short uORFs and the rabbit CFTR exon –1A AUG codon, that is in-frame with the main CFTR ORF, are conserved in the human genome. The presence of homologues of the rabbit alternative exon 1 sequences in the human genome, but not the mouse, is consistent with expression of CFTR in the hearts of many species, including the rabbit (Fig. 3A) (15Levesque P. Hart P. Hume J. Kenyon J. Horowitz B. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and human (18Warth J. Collier M. Hart P. Geary Y. Gelband C. Chapman T. Horowitz B. Hume J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 31: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but not in the mouse (tested by RNA in situ hybridization and two rounds of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; data not shown). Only 2 kb of genomic DNA sequence upstream of rabbit CFTR traditional exon 1 is available, and the alternative CFTR exons –1A to –1C lie beyond that. Long range PCR between CFTR traditional exon 1 and exons –1A to –1C, using rabbit gDNA template, was unsuccessful. Therefore, the promoter region controlling the expression of CFTR exons –1C, –1B, and –1A is likely to be distally located and cardiac-specific. Greater than 90% of CFTR Transcripts Expressed in the Heart Initiate at Exon –1C or –1B—Total CFTR mRNA expression in rabbit adult LVFW was similar to the level of CFTR expression detected in duodenal epithelium. A 6.5 kb CFTR transcript was detected in both tissues (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with the known CFTR transcript size (3Riordan J. Rommens J. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J.

Past studies have also shown alternative splicing of exon 5 (25Hart P. Warth J. Levesque P. Collier M. Geary Y. Horowitz B. Hume J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6343-6348Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and changes in total CFTR expression during heart development (27Wong K. Trezise A. Vandenberg J. Mech. Dev. 2000; 94: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and in cardiac hypertrophy (28Wong K. Trezise A. Crozatier B. Vandenberg J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To investigate the biological relevance of the multiple alternative CFTR transcripts, we measured the relative expression level of individual CFTR transcripts in rabbit heart tissue from embryo day 29, neonate day 7, juvenile week 3, and normal adult left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV). We used TaqMan quantitative PCR (qPCR) to quantify each distinct CFTR transcript: CFTR–1C, CFTR–1B, CFTR–1C/–1A, CFTRTRAD-139, CFTREXON5+, and CFTREXON5–. In all cases, amplicons were less than 150 bp, the standard curve plots showed a very high correlation coefficient (R2 > 0.99, p < 0.01), and amplification efficiencies were close to 100%. The expression levels of each CFTR transcript were measured in arbitrary relative expression units and normalized to 18 S rRNA. We compared CFTR expression in whole heart (atria and ventricles) from embryo day 29, and ventricular tissues from neonate day 7, juvenile week 3, and normal adult year 1 LV and RV. Atrial tissue contributes less than 10% of the tissue weight to the embryo day 29 samples and will not significantly affect the comparison of CFTR expression during development. The predominantly expressed CFTR transcript in early rabbit cardiac development was CFTR–1B, with lower levels of the CFTR–1C and CFTR–1C/–1A transcripts (Fig. 2B). As development proceeds the expression of CFTR–1B transcripts decreased (p < 0.05), whereas expression of both CFTR–1C and CFTR–1C/–1A transcripts increased and became the predominant CFTR transcripts in the adult rabbit heart (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05, respectively). In contrast, the expression of CFTRTRAD-139 transcripts was low and static. In adult cardiac tissue, greater than 90% of total CFTR mRNA transcripts include the novel alternative exons (exon –1C, exon –1B, and exon –1C/–1A) described here. This contrasts with duodenum, where more than 95% of CFTR transcripts initiate from traditional CFTR exon 1. Analysis of CFTR exon 5 alternative splicing showed equal levels of exon 5+ and exon 5- CFTR transcripts at embryonic and neonatal stages (Fig. 3C). In hearts from juvenile and adult animals, there were differential increases in expression of both CFTREXON5+, and CFTREXON5– isoforms. This resulted in CFTREXON5– transcripts being 3-fold more abundant than CFTREXON5+ transcripts in the LVFW of adult hearts (p < 0.05). This also contrasts with CFTR expression in adult duodenum, where over 90% of CFTR transcripts include exon 5. The Expression of CFTR Transcripts Initiating at Exon –1C Is Primarily Responsible for the Epicardial to Endocardial Gradient across the LVFW—Epicardial (higher) to endocardial (lower) gradients across the rabbit LVFW have been shown for both cAMP-activated chloride currents and CFTR expression (26Wong K. Trezise A. Bryant S. Hart G. Vandenberg J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1403-H1409PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis of the differential distribution of each CFTR transcript in the adult LVFW shows that CFTR–1C and CFTR–1C/–1A transcripts, as well as alternatively spliced CFTREXON5– transcripts, are responsible for the epicardial to endocardial gradient of CFTR expression and function in the left ventricle (Fig. 3, A (i and iii) and B, p < 0.05 in all cases). In contrast, there were no substantial differences in epicardial versus endocardial expression of CFTR–1B, CFTRTRAD-139, or CFTREXON5+ transcripts (Fig. 3, A (ii and iv) and B). This work has also"

Activity is increased by ATP binding and decreased by dATP binding. To study the mechanism governing this regulation, we have constructed three R1 proteins with mutations at His-59 in the activity site and one R1 protein with a mutation at His-88 close to the activity site and compared their allosteric behavior to that of the wild type R1 protein. All mutant proteins retained about 70% of wild type enzymatic activity. We found that if residue His-59 was replaced with alanine or asparagine, the enzyme lost its normal response to the inhibitory effect of dATP, whereas the enzyme with a glutamine still managed to elicit a normal response. We saw a similar result if residue His-88, which is proposed to hydrogen-bond to His-59, was replaced with alanine. Nucleotide binding experiments ruled out the possibility that the effect is due to an inability of the mutant proteins to bind effector since little difference in binding constants was observed for wild type and mutant proteins. Instead, the interaction between proteins R1 and R2 was perturbed in the mutant proteins. We propose that His-59 is important in the allosteric effect triggered by dATP binding, that the conserved hydrogen bond between His-59 and His-88 is important for the communication of the allosteric effect, and that this effect is exerted on the R1/R2 interaction.

A key enzyme of nucleic acid metabolism in the cell is ribonucleotide reductase. This enzyme, abbreviated RNR, 1The abbreviation used is: RNR, ribonucleotide reductase. catalyzes the reaction where ribonucleotides are converted to deoxyribonucleotides, thus providing the cell with all components of DNA. RNR activity is essential for DNA synthesis and repair, but is also in need of a strict control system. An uncontrolled production of DNA precursors is devastating to the cell since the mutation frequency is increased at aberrant concentrations of dNTPs (1Kunz B.A. Kohalmi S.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In prokaryotic as well as most eukaryotic RNRs belonging to the class Ia enzymes, this is solved by an allosteric regulation controlling both the substrate specificity and the overall activity. Other classes of RNR, denoted Ib, II, and III, all perform the same reaction but operate at different conditions and via slightly different catalytic mechanisms (for a review, see Ref. 2Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Class Ib and II RNRs are allosterically regulated in a similar manner, and the class III enzymes are regulated approximately by the same effectors as class I RNRs (Fig. 1). In this study, all studies concern the class Ia RNR from Escherichia coli. The E. coli class Ia enzyme is composed of two dimeric proteins with different properties. The larger protein, denoted R1, contains the catalytic site and two types of allosteric sites. The catalytic mechanism involves advanced chemistry that is accomplished by a stable amino acid radical that originates from the smaller subunit, denoted R2. The free radical localized to Tyr-122 and adjacent to the iron center of R2 is transferred via an array of hydrogen-bonded amino acids to the active site of R1. Consequently, the assembly of both proteins is required at catalysis. Different nucleotides mediate the allosteric regulation via two separate sites: the overall activity site and the substrate specificity site. The level of enzymatic activity is increased by the binding of ATP and decreased by the binding of dATP to the overall activity site. The function of the other site, the specificity site, is to ensure that the different dNTPs are produced in correct proportions. The regulation at this site is a multifaceted process. Binding of ATP or dATP promotes CDP and UDP reduction, whereas binding of dTTP and dGTP stimulates reduction of GDP and ADP, respectively. Binding of dATP to the specificity site is ∼10 times tighter than to the overall activity site. The specificity site is located to the dimer interface of the R1 monomers, and the activity site is located to the N terminus of R1 (3Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), which according to the model of the holoenzyme complex proposed by Uhlin et al. (4Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) is close to the interaction area with protein R2. The allosteric properties were elucidated in the 1960s and 1970s (5Larsson A. Reichard P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 407-408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Brown N.C.

Chem. 1976; 251: 3616-3622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the molecular mechanisms of the regulation are still unknown. Also, the question of why ATP and dATP have opposite effects on enzymatic activity despite their structural similarities is still unanswered. Knowing that a mutation from aspartic acid to asparagine at position 57 in mouse RNR turned this enzyme into a dATP-insensitive phenotype (9Caras I.W. Martin D.W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2698-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we decided to introduce a mutation at the corresponding position (His-59) in the E. coli enzyme. According to the structure, His-59 interacts with His-88 via a hydrogen bond (cf. Fig. 5) that is conserved between many species and has been suggested to be involved in the R1/R2 interaction (3Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). His-59 may, via a hydrogen bond, thus be the link between the effector nucleotide and the residues involved in the binding of R2. Four mutant R1 proteins were constructed, three replacements of His-59 (H59A, H59N, and H59Q) and one replacement of His-88 (H88A), to investigate this theory. By comparing the characteristics of the mutant proteins to those of wild type R1, we show that this hydrogen bond is important for the communication of the allosteric effect manifested at the holoenzyme level. Bacterial Strains—E. coli CJ236 dut–, ung–, thi-, relA1/pCJ105, and MV1190 Δ(lac-proAB), thi, supE, Δ(srl-recA)306::Tn10, both obtained from Bio-Rad, were used for mutagenesis. MC1009 Δ(lacI-POZYA)X74, galE, galK, strA, Δ(ara-leu)7697, araD139, recA, srl::Tn10/pGP1-2, obtained from Amersham Biosciences, was used for expression. Plasmid—For the expression of R1 protein, we used plasmid pTB1, a derivative of the Amersham Biosciences plasmid pTZ18R. It contains a T7 promoter upstream of a cloning cassette (10Mead D.A. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) and has the E. coli nrdA gene, encoding protein R1, inserted (11Åberg A. Hahne S. Karlsson M. Larsson A. Ormö M. Åhgren A. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12249-12252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pGP1-2, obtained from S. Tabor, codes for T7 RNA polymerase under the control of the λPL promoter and for a heat-sensitive c1857 repressor under the control of the lac promoter (12Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar). Growth Medium—All strains were cultured in LB medium. CJ236/pTB1 was cultured in a medium containing carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (15 μg/ml), and after infection with helper phage M13K07, kanamycin (70 μg/ml) was added to the medium. MV1190/pTB1 was cultured in medium containing carbenicillin (50 μg/ml). MC1009/pTB1/pGP1-2 was cultured in medium containing carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Oligonucleotide-directed Mutagenesis—All mutants except H88A were constructed according to the method described by Kunkel and colleagues (13Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar, 14Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) using the Muta-Gene phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit from Bio-Rad. The H88A mutant was constructed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. This method is PCR-based and can be performed on any double-stranded DNA. All primers contained, in addition to the desired mutation, an inserted restriction enzyme cleavage site to enable easy screening of mutants. Listed below are the primers used for the different mutants, with the screening restriction enzyme within parenthesis. The primers are as follows: H59A, d(5′-CCTCTGACATTGCGGAAACC-3′) (BsrDI); H59D, d(5′-CCTCTGACATCGACGAAACC-3′) (TaqI); H59N, d(5′-CCTCTGACATTAACGAAACC-3′) (MseI); H59Q, d(5′-TGACATCCAGGAGACCATTATC-3′) (BsaI); H88A, d(5′-GGCAGGCTTTTTGCGCAGGGCGAAGATCGCC-3′) (FspI); H88A inv, d(5′-GGCGATCTTCGCCCTGCGCAAAAAAGCCTACGGCC-3′) (FspI). Bold and underlined bases are mismatches and changed codons, respectively. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by T-A-G-Copenhagen ApS Symbion. The mutated nrdA genes were verified by DNA sequencing using DyeDeoxy™ terminator cycle sequencing kit from Amersham Biosciences. Sequencing gels were run at the Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology at the Karolinska Institute. In the H59A mutant, there was an additional mutation in the codon for the amino acid in position 429. Fortunately, this was a silent mutation and could be ignored. Expression of Mutant Protein—The MC1009/pGP1-2 strain containing any of pTB1-H59A, -H59D, -H59N, -H59Q, or -H88A was grown for several hours at 30 °C in 10 ml of LB supplemented with carbenicillin and kanamycin at a concentration of 50 μg/ml of each. One liter of the same medium was then inoculated with 0.06 A640 units of culture and incubated overnight. The next day, 5 liters of the medium were inoculated with overnight culture to give a concentration of 0.05 A640 units/ml. The culture was divided into five flasks and grown to log phase (A640 = 0.5) when the temperature was raised to 42 °C. At this temperature, the heat-sensitive repressor dissociates from the λPL promoter, and the produced T7 RNA polymerase starts the transcription of the nrdA gene. Growth proceeded for 3 h, and then the cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C. The protein content in 0.1 mg of cells was analyzed on a SDS-PAGE gel using the Amersham Biosciences Phast system. Protein Purification—Frozen cells were disintegrated in an X-press and resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The purification of protein was performed as described by Sjöberg et al. (15Sjöberg B.M. Hahne S. Karlsson M. Jörnvall H. Göransson M. Uhlin B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5658-5662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After DEAE column chromatography, the fractions that contained the R1 protein were pooled and ultradialyzed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The protein was further purified on a fast protein liquid chromatography MonoQ 10/10 ion exchange column and eluted with a gradient of NaCl. The protein was concentrated as described above and stored at –80 °C. The purity of the protein was estimated from SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, and the concentration was determined spectrophotometrically from the absorbance at 280 minus that at 310 nm, assuming a molar extinction coefficient of 180,000 m–1 cm–1 for protein R1. All mutant proteins (H59A, H59D, H59N, H59Q, and H88A) behaved like wild type R1 protein during the expression procedure. However, the purified H59D preparations contained additional slightly faster migrating bands on the SDS-PAGE gel, indicative of protein degradation. The H59D protein was not used for further analyses. Assay of Enzymatic Activity—Assays of enzymatic activity of mutant and wild type protein were performed and analyzed as described for the 3H-CDP assay (16Thelander L. Sjöberg B.-M. Eriksson S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Wild type or mutant R1 protein was assayed with an excess of protein R2, 1.5 mm effector ATP, and 0.5 mm substrate [3H]CDP in a final volume of 50 μl. The cold nucleotides were purchased from Roche Applied Science except ATP, CDP, and dCMP, which were purchased from Sigma. The [3H]CDP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The cation exchange resin AG ®50W was purchased from Bio-Rad. Nucleotide Binding Assay—The experimental procedure was carried out mainly as described by Ormö and Sjöberg (17Ormö M. Sjöberg B.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the experiments with dTTP, the nucleotide concentrations were 0.1–10 μm, and the protein concentration was 1.85 μm, and in experiments with dATP, the nucleotide concentrations were 0.1–500 μm, and protein concentrations were 1.85–28 μm. Experiments were carried out at room temperature in Ultrafree-MC filter units with polysulfone PTTK membranes, molecular cut-off of 30,000, obtained from Millipore. The nucleotides [methyl-3H]dTTP and [8-3H]dATP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and diluted in cold nucleotides from Roche Applied Science. Kinetic data were obtained from non-linear regression of v versus L, where v is moles of bound ligand per mole of protein R1 and L is the concentration of free ligand. The total number of binding sites (n) and the dissociation constants (KD) were calculated using the following equation, where a denotes the unspecific binding of nucleotide (less than 0.2%) to the filter. v=(n×[dNTP]/(KD+[dNTP]))+a×[dNTP](Eq. 1) Assay of Effector Concentration on Enzymatic Activity—The effects of the allosteric effectors ATP, dATP, and dTTP on the activity of the R1 proteins were measured individually. The influence of the positive effectors ATP and dTTP was studied at concentrations of 0.05–5 mm and 0.2–100 μm, respectively, as was the influence of the negative effector dATP at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 1000 μm. The rest of the components were used at the concentrations described above. From a direct plot of activity versus concentration of effector, the KL values for binding of effectors were calculated in KaleidaGraph using the following equations: binding of dTTP and ATP to one allosteric site, v=(vmax×[dNTP]/(KL+[dNTP])(Eq. 2) and binding of dATP to the two independent sites, v=(vmax1×[dATP]/(KL1+[dATP]))+(vmax2×[dATP](KL2+[dATP]))(Eq. 3) R1/R2 Binding Assay—The method was performed as the 3H-CDP assay described above, but the conditions of the reaction mixture were different. The R1 protein was kept at a concentration of 33 nm, whereas the R2 subunit was treated as a substrate, and concentration was varied from 33 to 2000 nm. R1/R2 interaction was measured at five concentrations of dATP (0.1, 1.0, 10, 100, and 1000 μm) chosen according to their stimulatory or inhibitory effect on wild type or mutant holoenzyme activity. The KD (i.e. Km of R2) of the complex was calculated (18Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) from a plot of enzyme activity versus total concentration of R2. v=Vmax·KM+R2+R12R1-KM+R2+R12R12-R2R1(Eq. 4) R1/R2 Interaction Studies Using Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Interaction of proteins R1 and R2 was studied using the Amersham Biosciences Biosensor (BIAcore) method (19Jönsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Rönnberg I. Sjölander S. Stenberg E. Ståhlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Östlin H. Malmqvist M.

A His-tagged version of protein R2 with an insertion of six consecutive histidine codons in the middle of the R2 gene was used. The R2(His)6 protein had the same activity and iron content as wild type R2. 2A. Kasrayan, P. Larsson Birgander, and B.-M. Sjöberg, submitted. All surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed using a BIACORE 1000 equipped with a research grade CM5 sensor chip. The R2(His)6 ligand (>90% pure based on SDS-PAGE) was immobilized at a level of 1000–1500 resonance units/flow cell using amine-coupling chemistry. The resonance unit is proportional to the mass, and a response of 1000 resonance units corresponds to a surface protein concentration of 1 ng/mm2 of the 100-nm-thick dextran layer. The analyte R1 proteins (in 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, allosteric effector dATP, 0.05% P20, pH 7.4) were injected in triplicates (random order) over the flow cell, as well as over the reference surface, at concentrations of 0–4 μm at a flow rate of 65 μl/min and a temperature of 25 °C. The complex was allowed to associate and dissociate for 90 s, and the surface was regenerated with a 30-s injection of 0.5 KCl between injections. Data were collected at a rate of 1 Hz. The response at equilibrium was plotted against the R1 concentrations using the KaleidaGraph program, and an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was obtained using a one-site binding (hyperbola) model. Analysis of Enzymatic Activity—Assays of wild type and mutant R1 activity were performed with ATP as a positive allosteric effector. All mutants were found to have close to comparable enzyme activity (≥70%) with that of wild type R1. This was also seen in the presence of the allosteric effectors dATP (at ≤0.5 μm concentrations) or dTTP, and in the case of the H59A protein, also in the absence of allosteric effectors. Analysis of the Response to Effectors at Different Concentrations—Because all mutations (three at His-59 and one at His-88) were introduced at the allosteric activity site, it was of interest to assay the response of the mutant proteins to effector concentrations and their nucleotide binding strength. We investigated the responses of the wild type and the mutant proteins toward the allosteric effectors dATP (Fig. 2) and ATP. As described in the introduction, dATP acts as a positive effector at low concentrations when it binds to the specificity site and as an inhibitor upon binding to the overall activity site. The KL values for binding to the specificity site (KL1) were therefore determined from the first part of the curve and were 0.1–0.2 μm for all mutant proteins and for wild type R1 (Fig. 2 and Table I). The second KL value (KL2), which is equivalent to an IC50, is determined from the second part of the curve. Interestingly, the KL2 values were found to be considerably lower for the wild type and the H59Q proteins than for the H59A and H59N proteins, and the KL2 value for H88A was in between those of the other mutants (Fig. 2, Table I). The apparent KL values for ATP were similar for H59A and wild type R1, 0.1 and 0.07 mm, respectively (Table I), and in agreement with an early report of wild type KL (5Larsson A. Reichard P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 407-408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table IBinding constants for allosteric effector nucleotidesProteinAllosteric effector interactionsaEmpty fields; not determined.Specificity siteActivity sitedTTPdATP, KL1dATPdATP (+dTTP)ATP, KLKLKDBinding sitesbThe number of binding sites observed.KL2KDcKD values and total number of binding sites include contributions from binding at the specificity sites, because it was not possible to differentiate between dATP binding to the activity site and the specificity site.Binding sitescKD values and total number of binding sites include contributions from binding at the specificity sites, because it was not possible to differentiate between dATP binding to the activity site and the specificity site.KDBinding sitesbThe number of binding sites observed.μmnμmμmnμmnμmWTdWT, wild type.0.41.81.50.201.7131.61.61.072H59A0.41.21.10.0849252.20.91.1110H59N0.62.51.10.1455H59Q0.191.4H88A0.1313211.8a Empty fields; not determined.b The number of binding sites observed.c KD values and total number of binding sites include contributions from binding at the specificity sites, because it was not possible to differentiate between dATP binding to the activity site and the specificity site.d WT, wild type. Open table in a new tab Nucleotide Binding to the Allosteric Sites Is Not Affected in the Mutant R1 Proteins—An explanation for the observed difference in dATP inhibition of H59A and H59N could be that these proteins differ from wild type R1 in effector binding. We therefore compared the binding of dATP to H59A, H59N, and wild type R1. Although dATP binds with different affinities to the two types of allosteric sites (17Ormö M. Sjöberg B.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), it was not possible to resolve the two dissociation constants (KD) for the wild type or any of the mutant proteins in the current analyses. However as can be seen in Fig. 3 and Table I, no major differences in dATP binding were found for the wild type and the mutant proteins for dATP concentrations between 0.1 and 500 μm. One way to circumvent the problem with the two different KD values for dATP is to block the specificity site with high concentrations of dTTP and thus study binding of dATP only to the overall activity site. Such assays confirmed that the overall activity sites of H59A and wild type R1 bind dATP with similar strength (Table I) and that there is cooperativity between the two allosteric sites, as was observed earlier for the wild type protein (7Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 39-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). As an independent control, binding of dTTP to the specificity site was also studied. The KD obtained for dTTP in H59A, H59N, and wild type R1 did not reflect any major differences (Table I). The Allosteric Effector dATP Promotes the Formation of a Tight R1/R2 Complex—Next we wanted to check whether the characteristics of the H59A protein were coupled to an alteration in its interaction with R2. As has been observed previously (6Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 21Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4591-4601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the affinity of protein R1 for the R2 protein is affected by the concentration of dATP. Here we show that the KD values decreased for both H59A and wild type R1 complexes at inhibitory concentrations of dATP (Fig. 4), implying increased affinities for the R2 protein. Thus, a tighter complex is formed at inhibitory concentrations of dATP. This effect was seen both using the Biosensor analysis (Fig. 4) and using the method described by Climent et al. (18Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Importantly, the H59A protein formed a tight complex at higher dATP concentrations than the wild type protein did, which is consistent with its lower sensitivity toward inhibitory concentrations of dATP (Fig. 2). The behavior of the H88A protein appears to be in between that of the H59A and wild type proteins (Fig. 4), in agreement with its allosteric response to dATP at these conditions (Fig. 2). It is still unknown why ATP and dATP have opposite effects on the overall enzymatic activity of RNRs. Beyond doubt, the 2′ positions of the nucleotides are involved since that is the only difference between the two. The most important finding in our study was that two of the His-59 mutant enzymes as well as the H88A protein were not able to discriminate efficiently between ATP and dATP. The H59A and H59N proteins showed ∼30 times higher tolerance toward dATP as compared with wild type R1 (Fig. 2, Table I), whereas the H59Q protein had the same tolerance as wild type R1. The H88A protein showed 8 times higher tolerance to dATP. The insensitivity toward dATP would, in the case of the H59A and H59N proteins, most easily be explained as an inability of the mutant proteins to bind the effector, but such a hypothesis is not supported by the results from the nucleotide binding assays. The small differences in KD values between the mutant and wild type proteins are in the range of assay variations. From the three-dimensional structure of the R1 protein in complex with effectors, it is clear that the nucleotide interacts with several residues; thus, His-59 should not be crucial for binding (3Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). As the allosteric activity site is located close to the R1/R2 interaction area, it seems likely that dATP and ATP exert their effect on the subunit interaction. This theory has been discussed in several reports (3Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 6Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 22Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In our preliminary experiments, we found that high concentrations of dATP promote the formation of a tight complex. We believe that at high concentrations of dATP, a too strong R1/R2 complex may form in which the reduction of substrates is inhibited. The allosteric activity site and His-59 are not directly accessible from R2, but His-88 that forms a hydrogen bond to His-59 is in closer proximity to R2 (3Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). A hydrogen bond at this position is conserved in RNRs of many species, although it does not always involve two His residues. In many eukaryotic and viral RNRs, it is formed between an aspartic acid and an asparagine residue. In a study of the allosteric regulation of the specificity site in the class III RNR from bacteriophage T4, it has been shown that the read-out of the allosteric effector identity is accomplished via the formation of different hydrogen-bonding patterns between effector and certain side chains (23Larsson K.M. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Logan D.T. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is possible that the effect of dATP binding at the activity site in E. coli R1 is communicated in a similar way and that His-59 is the key residue in the identification of effector. Crystallographic studies (3Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) have shown that the hydrogen bond between His-59 and His-88 seen in the absence of effector is broken when ATP is bound to the activity site (Fig. 5). The reason for this may be that in addition to a bond between the 3′-OH of ATP and His-59, the 2′-OH of ATP forms a hydrogen bond to another residue, possibly Lys-21 and/or Ile-22. This latter bond holds ATP in a position that brings His-59 closer to the effector and thus prevents formation of the bond to His-88. In contrast to ATP, dATP bound to the activity site would only form a hydrogen bond to His-59. We suggest that the lack of a 2′-OH group on dATP allows the hydrogen-bonded His-59 to also form a hydrogen bond to His-88, and that this leads to formation of a tight and inactive R1/R2 complex. In the H59A and H59N proteins, the hydrogen bond between His-59 and His-88 cannot form. For this reason, the tight R1/R2 complex may not form, and the activity is retained in the presence of dATP. The ϵ-nitrogen of the H59Q protein, on the other hand, may hydrogen-bond to His-88 and form the tight complex as in wild type R1. It is not obvious that His-59 and His-88 are directly involved in the allosteric communication and the R1/R2 interaction. It is also possible that His-88 orients His-59, which in turn orients the effector in a position that enables the phosphate group of the effector to communicate the allosteric effect exerted by ATP/dATP binding to the residues involved in the R1/R2 interaction. The most useful tool to investigate these theories would be to compare the crystal structures of the mutant and wild type R1 proteins in complex with dATP and/or ATP. Unfortunately, no well diffracting crystals of the mutant proteins have been obtained. 3U. Uhlin, personal communication. In line with our proposal for ATP/dATP discrimination, a recent structural study of class Ib protein R1 from Salmonella typhimurium showed that the low affinity for ATP as compared with dNTPs at the allosteric specificity site in this enzyme could be explained by a steric clash between a tyrosine side chain and the 2′-OH of ATP (24Uppsten M. Färnegårdh M. Jordan A. Eliasson R. Eklund H. Uhlin U. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A comparison of nucleotide binding (KD) to isolated R1 proteins and allosteric effects of nucleotides (KL) on the ternary RNR complex shows that the KD of the specificity site is 3–5 times higher than the corresponding KL value. This may be explained by a positive cooperativity between effector binding and R2 binding to protein R1. Similarly, the KD of the overall activity site in wild type R1 is about 5 times higher than its corresponding KL value, but in the H88A and H59A proteins, the KL value is of approximately the same magnitude as the corresponding KD, suggesting that positive cooperativity, if any, of effector binding on holoenzyme complex formation does not occur in the mutant enzymes. We cannot, however, exclude that the inhibition observed in these mutants at very high concentrations of dATP is due to an unspecific mechanism. Binding of nucleotides to the specificity site is not affected by the mutation in the activity site since the kinetic parameters of dTTP binding and the positive allosteric effects of dATP at low concentrations are approximately the same in wild type and mutant proteins (Table I). This result is in contrast to a study of RNR from mouse with a mutation at the corresponding position (D57N). Here the mutation at the allosteric activity site led to a decreased binding of dATP also at the specificity site (25Reichard P. Eliasson R. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33021-33026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, in a recent study on the mouse enzyme with the D57N mutation, Kashlan and Cooperman (26Kashlan O.B. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1696-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) did not see any effect on binding to the specificity site. The mouse and the E. coli enzymes are not necessarily regulated in an identical manner. The R1 protein of mouse RNR may be less robust than the E. coli enzyme, and perhaps the entire structure of the mouse enzyme is more affected by the mutation than that of the E. coli enzyme. In studies of the class I enzyme from mouse, it was suggested that the mouse R1 protein readily dissociates to monomers (27Scott C.P. Kashlan O.B. Lear J.D. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1651-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and that the RNR activity shows a triphasic dependence on the ATP concentration (26Kashlan O.B. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1696-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Scott C.P. Kashlan O.B. Lear J.D. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1651-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Kashlan O.B. Scott C.P. Lear J.D. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 462-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The effect was explained as a reversible formation of an inactive tetramer when ATP binds to the activity site at moderate ATP concentrations. At higher concentrations of ATP, the effector binds to a third allosteric site, and the enzyme is converted into an active hexamer. In our study, we did not see a triphasic dependence of ATP (Fig. 6), hence we find no support for a third allosteric site in the E. coli enzyme. An inhibitory effect of ATP may be obtained at high concentrations of ATP but can easily be counteracted by Mg2+ ions (Fig. 6); thus, we interpret this inhibition as a depletion of free Mg2+ ions needed for enzymatic activity. Although the E. coli R1 protein forms a tight dimer in the presence of magnesium ions (21Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4591-4601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mouse R1 monomers require the binding of both effectors and substrates to dimerize. Also, in contrast to the E. coli enzyme, the mouse enzyme shows a positive cooperativity between its two specificity sites (27Scott C.P. Kashlan O.B. Lear J.D. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1651-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is fascinating that residues of different chemical nature in the activity sites of E. coli and mouse RNRs may exert the same allosteric effect via an important hydrogen bond. In the mouse enzyme, this would be accomplished by the D57/N85 pair (3Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), whereas we have shown in this study that the same effect is accomplished in the E. coli enzyme via the two histidines His-59 and His-88. Thus, just as there are differences in the allosteric regulation between the three classes of RNR, there are differences between RNRs belonging to the same class. In summary, this study supports the theory that the inhibitory effect of dATP is exerted on the interaction between R1 and R2. The importance of His-59 and His-88 in the allosteric overall activity regulation of E. coli R1 is obvious as replacing one or the other with an alanine abolishes the allosteric effect of the inhibitor dATP. We suggest that dATP binding to the activity site is sensed by His-59, which further communicates its effect to His-88, and that this results in the formation of a tight R1/R2 complex that is unfavorable for ribonucleotide reduction. We thank MariAnn Westman for help with some of the nucleotide binding experiments and Prof. Ingemar Björk for help with some of the kinetic evaluations."
https://openalex.org/W1990173826,"The specificity of tropomyosin (Tm) exon 6b for interaction with and functioning of troponin (Tn) has been studied using recombinant fibroblast Tm isoforms 5a and 5b. These isoforms differ internally by exons 6a/6b and possess non-muscle exons 1b/9d at the termini, hence they lack the primary TnT1-tropomyosin interaction, allowing study of exon 6 exchange in isolation from this. Using kinetic techniques to measure regulation of myosin S1 binding to actin and fluorescently labeled Tm to directly measure Tn binding, we show that binding of Tn to both isoforms is similar (0.1–0.5 μm) and both produce well regulated systems. Calcium has little effect on Tn binding to the actin·Tm complex and both exons produce a 3-fold reduction in the S1 binding rate to actin·Tm·Tn in its absence. This confirms previous results that show exon 6 has little influence on Tn affinity to actin·Tm or its ability to fully inhibit the acto-myosin interaction. Thin filaments reconstituted with Tn and Tm5a or skeletal Tm (containing exon 6b) show nearly identical calcium dependence of acto-myosin regulation. However, Tm5b produces a dramatic increase in calcium sensitivity, shifting the activation mid-point by almost an order of magnitude. This shows that exon 6 sequence and, hence, Tm structure in this region have a significant effect upon the calcium regulation of Tn. This finding supports evidence that familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations occurring adjacent to this region can effect calcium regulation. The specificity of tropomyosin (Tm) exon 6b for interaction with and functioning of troponin (Tn) has been studied using recombinant fibroblast Tm isoforms 5a and 5b.

This finding supports evidence that familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations occurring adjacent to this region can effect calcium regulation. Tropomyosins (Tm) 1The abbreviations used are: Tm, tropomyosin; Tn, troponin; skTm, skeletal tropomyosin; PIA, pyrene iodoacetamide; PM, pyrene maleimide; EM, electron microscopy; S1, myosin subfragment 1; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; FHC, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 1The abbreviations used are: Tm, tropomyosin; Tn, troponin; skTm, skeletal tropomyosin; PIA, pyrene iodoacetamide; PM, pyrene maleimide; EM, electron microscopy; S1, myosin subfragment 1; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; FHC, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. are a family of α helical coiled-coil proteins which seem to be ubiquitous among eukaryotic cells, having been identified in organisms ranging from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to man. They are parallel homo- or heterodimers (encoded from the same or different genes) of two fully α helical chains of identical length, although the length can vary according to isoform type. In mammalian cells, alternative splicing produces a variety of muscle and non-muscle isoforms from four different genes (1Lees-Miller J.P. Helfman D.M. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 429-437Google Scholar). In muscle, the majority of Tm is produced from one α and one β gene product, with a smooth and a striated muscle isoform produced from each gene. In the α gene, exon 6b, which is found in both the muscle isoforms, is replaced by exon 6a in a number of non-muscle isoforms. However the β smooth tropomyosin contains exon 6a rather than 6b. In skeletal muscle, the part of Tm encoded by this sequence is positioned adjacent to the globular “head” region of regulatory troponin complex (Tn) (2White S.P. Cohen C. Phillips Jr., G.N. Nature. 1987; 325: 826-828Google Scholar, 3Flicker P.F. Phillips Jr., G.N. Cohen C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 495-501Google Scholar). Therefore, it was proposed that there is a muscle Tm-specific interaction with the exon 6 encoded sequence (reviewed in Refs. 4Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 5-49Google Scholar and 5Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 575-602Google Scholar; also, see Fig. 1). This was argued partly on the basis that the lower coiled-coil stability of exon 6b in comparison to exon 6a (see Fig. 1) was a result of amino acid changes necessary for Tm interaction with Tn, which were unneeded in the non-muscle exon 6a. However, the work of Hammell and Hitchcock-DeGregori (6Hammell R.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22409-22416Google Scholar) showed that exon 6 exchange had little effect upon either the whole Tn complex or TnT affinity for a series of αTm constructs. Therefore, they concluded that exon 6 is not required for interaction with Tn and may instead be important for interactions with caldesmon, as shown by other investigators (7Pittenger M.F. Kistler A. Helfman D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3253-3265Google Scholar, 8Watson M.H. Kuhn A.E. Novy R.E. Lin J.J. Mak A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18860-18866Google Scholar). To study the effect of αTm exon 6 upon troponin regulation of the acto-myosin interaction, we have used the two αTm fibroblast isoforms Tm5a and Tm5b, which are shown in Fig. 1. These are shorter than muscle tropomyosins because they lack exon 2, but they differ internally only by exon 6. Confusingly, Tm5a has exon 6b, whereas Tm5b possesses exon 6a. They both have a smooth muscle like exon 9d and a non-muscle exon 1b, which, together, have been shown to lack significant interaction with the N-terminal region of TnT (9Hammell R.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4236-4242Google Scholar, 10Palm T. Greenfield N.J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3181-3189Google Scholar). This allows the effects of exchange of exon 6 to be studied in isolation of what is regarded as the primary TnT-Tm interaction. As highlighted in Fig. 1, we have also produced a Tm5b mutant, V154C, in exon 6a to give a cysteine at an identical position to Cys154 in the exon 6b sequence (equivalent to position 190 in the skeletal sequence). This allows the covalent attachment of a fluorescent pyrene label in the same position as has been previously used for studies of smooth and skeletal muscle tropomyosins (11Burtnick L.D. Sanders C. Smillie L.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 266: 622-627Google Scholar, 12Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6894-6903Google Scholar, 13Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1160-1166Google Scholar, 14Schaertl S. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15890-15894Google Scholar). Actin thin filaments containing these fibroblast tropomyosins, both in pyrene-labeled and -unlabelled forms, have been characterized for their ability to bind troponin using both a functional kinetic assay based on the regulation of the actomyosin interaction and by Tn-induced changes in monomer fluorescence of pyrene-labeled Tm on Tn binding. We have measured the effects of calcium upon Tn-saturated thin filaments. The functional assays we used are based upon measurement of occupancy of the biochemical blocked state of the three-state model of thin filament regulation (15McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Google Scholar). As defined by the work of McKillop and Geeves (15McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Google Scholar), the blocked state is only significantly occupied in the absence of Ca2+ when the Tn complex is tightly bound to the filament. In the presence of Tn and Ca2+ or when Tn is absent, KB (the blocked-closed equilibrium constant) is large, giving little or no occupancy of the blocked state. Hence, measurement of the occupancy of the blocked state can be used both to measure Tn binding to actin·Tm in the absence of calcium and also the calcium dependence of regulation of Tn-saturated thin filaments. Our measurements show that troponin binding to actin·Tm is not significantly different for exons 6a/6b, which is in agreement with Hamell and Hitchcock-DeGregori (6Hammell R.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22409-22416Google Scholar). However, we show that exon 6 has a large influence on the calcium sensitivity of Tn regulation of thin filaments, with the non-muscle exon 6a increasing the calcium sensitivity by almost an order of magnitude in comparison to either skeletal Tm or Tm5b containing the muscle-like exon 6b. These results are discussed in terms of previous ideas about the muscle specificity and function of exon 6. Our results also have implications for understanding the basis of some of the Tm-based cardiomyopathies. Some of this work has been presented previously in a preliminary form (16Maytum R. Westerdorf B. Jaquet K. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 2000; 80: A87Google Scholar). Isolation of Proteins from Rabbit Skeletal Muscle—Skeletal Tn and tropomyosin (skTm) along with actin and myosin were isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. Tn was obtained by using the methods of Greaser and Gergely (17Greaser M.L. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4226-4233Google Scholar), and skTm was isolated according to Smillie (18Smillie L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 234-241Google Scholar). Their concentrations were determined by using E1% of 4.5 cm–1 for Tn and 2.4 cm–1 for skTm, with molecular weights of 120 and 65 kDa, respectively. It should be noted that this preparation of native skTm is an αα/αβ mixture containing around 10% β Tm. Myosin subfragment 1 (S1) was prepared by chymotryptic digestion of rabbit myosin, as described by Weeds and Taylor (19Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Google Scholar). Its molar concentration was calculated from absorbance measurement at 280 nm using an E1% of 7.9 cm–1 and a molecular weight of 115 kDa. Actin, purified from rabbit skeletal muscle according to Spudich and Watt (20Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Google Scholar), was labeled at Cys374 with N-(1-pyrene)iodoacetamide according to Criddle et al. (21Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Google Scholar) and used at a labeling ratio of ∼90%. Its molar concentration was determined by its absorbance at 280 nm using an E1% of 11.08 cm–1 and a molecular weight of 40,000 Da. SDS-PAGE of proteins was performed according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) using 13.5% acrylamide gels followed by staining with Coomassie Blue G-250. Expression of Recombinant Tropomyosins—Clones of the rat fibroblast tropomyosins 5a/5b were amplified from pET8c (gift from Drs. M. Gimona and D. Helfman) using PCR primers designed to introduce NdeI and BamHI restriction sites for cloning into the bacterial expression vector pJC20 (23Clos J. Brandau S. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 133-137Google Scholar). Primer sequences used were 5′-NdeI-GGAATTCCATATGGCGGGTAGCAGCTCGCTGGAG, 5′-BamHI-CGCGGATCCTCACATGTTGTTTAGCTCCAGTAATG. Identical primers were used for both TPM5a and TPM5b, as they differ only by an internal alternatively spliced exon (Fig. 1). Tm5b-V154C was produced by PCR based site-directed mutagenesis using the pair of primers V154C F 5′-CTCGGAAGGCCAATgTCGACAGCTGGAAGAAC, V154C R 5′-CTTCCAGCTGTCGACGAcATTGGCCTTCCGAGAGC (mutated base shown in lowercase). For expression, all the clones were transformed into BL21 DE3(pLys) and expressed and purified as described previously (24Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Konrad M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11913-11920Google Scholar). In brief, 1 liter of cultures were grown to late exponential phase and induced for 3 h with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 60 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mg/liter DNase, 1 mg/liter RNase) and lysed by passage through a French press (15,000 psi). The majority of Escherichia coli proteins were precipitated by heating to 80 °C for 10 min, and the precipitated protein and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The soluble Tm was then isoelectrically precipitated at pH 4.5 using 0.3 m HCl. The precipitate was pelleted and resuspended in 10–20 ml (depending upon yield) of running buffer (10 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl). This was then further purified using 2 × 5 ml HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) in tandem and eluted with a 150–400 mm NaCl gradient, with the Tm eluting at around 200–250 mm salt. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and concentrated by isoelectric precipitation. Extinction coefficients and molecular weights for recombinant proteins were calculated from the sequences using the integrated protein sequence analysis software AnTheProt (Gilbert Deleage, Institut de Biologie et Chimie des Protéines-Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique). Fibroblast 5a/5b protein concentrations were determined by using an extinction coefficient E280 nm of 4,670 m–1 cm–1 and molecular weights of 28425.2, 28,566.2, and 28570.0 for 5a, 5b, and 5b-V154C, respectively. All of the tropomyosins expressed well in E. coli, with typical yields of 10–20 mg/liter of culture. The proteins were all expressed as unmodified, unacetylated proteins. Mass spectrometry was used to confirm that the Tms had the correct size and that the N-terminal Met was removed post-translationally to leave Ala as the first amino acid as for the native proteins (25Goodwin L.O. Lees-Miller J.P. Leonard M.A. Cheley S.B. Helfman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8408-8415Google Scholar, 26Cote G.P. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1983; 57: 127-146Google Scholar). Small (50 μl) stock samples were dialyzed overnight against 1 mm Tris, pH 7.0, acidified with formic acid, and applied to a Finnegan Mat LCQ ion-trap mass spectrometer fitted with a nano-spray device. Mass accuracy for Tm samples is expected to be 2–4 (1/10,000). Molecular weights of 28425.2, 28,566.2, and 28,570.2 were determined for 5a, 5b, and 5b-V154C respectively, corresponding well to predicted weights for the proteins lacking their N-terminal Met and with no other modification. It has been shown previously that exon 1b in these fibroblast Tms has a five amino acid extension in comparison to exon 1a. This seems to perform the same role in stabilizing the Tm-Tm overlap region (10Palm T. Greenfield N.J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3181-3189Google Scholar, 27Lewis W.G. Cote G.P. Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 269-273Google Scholar) as a dipeptide extension commonly used to take the place of the native N-terminal acetylation, which is required for Tms possessing exon 1a to bind to actin with a native-like affinity (28Urbancikova M. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24310-24315Google Scholar, 29Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.d. C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Google Scholar). Tm5a, Tm5b, and Tm5b-V154C all bound to actin in the submicromolar range (data not shown), proving N-terminal modification of the Tm sequence was unnecessary for strong actin binding, as shown previously (30Pittenger M.F. Helfman D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 841-858Google Scholar). No evidence was seen of a significant non-binding fraction of expressed protein as reported previously by Pittinger and Helfman for 5a (30Pittenger M.F. Helfman D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 841-858Google Scholar). Kinetic Measurements of S1 Binding to Actin Filaments—Stopped-flow experiments were performed at 20 °C with an SF-61DX spectrophotometer (Hi-Tech Scientific) in fluorescence mode. Pyrene fluorescence of labeled actin was excited at 365 nm and emission was detected at right angles using a KV 389-nm cut-off filter (Schott, Mainz, Germany). Data were stored and analyzed by using the Kinetasyst software provided with the instrument. Transients shown are the average of three to five shots of the machine. In these experiments, the concentrations quoted are those after mixing and are half the relevant concentrations of the stock solutions in the syringes. The occupancy of the blocked B-state (defined by KB) has been determined by using the kinetic method of McKillop and Geeves (15McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Google Scholar), where the rate of binding of S1 to reconstituted filaments is measured under excess actin condition. Under these conditions, the observed rate constant of binding (kobs) is proportional to the fraction of actin available for binding. The value of KB is then defined from the ratio of the observed rate constant of S1 binding to reconstituted thin filaments in the presence and absence of calcium (15McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Google Scholar). kobs=[A]k+1and-Ca2+kobsCa2+kobs∝KB1+KB(Eq. 1) Fluorescence Labeling of Tropomyosins—Cysteine-containing tropomyosins were labeled using pyrene iodoacetamide using a modified method of Ishii and Lehrer (13Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1160-1166Google Scholar). Tropomyosins were denatured in a reducing solution of standard buffer containing 6 m urea and 20 mm dithiothreitol at 60 °C for 10 min. The solution was then cooled, and the dithiothreitol was removed by a single-step anion exchange chromatography. The tropomyosin was loaded onto a HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a single step of 0.4 m sodium chloride. The eluted protein was pooled and rapidly dialyzed against urea containing standard buffer to remove the salt and diluted to 1 mg/ml. Pyrene iodoacetamide stock solution at 100 mg/ml in dimethylformamide was then added at a 10:1 molar ratio and left to stir for 12–18 h. Excess insoluble label was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 mins; soluble label and urea were removed by subsequent dialysis against standard buffer. Labeling ratio was calculated spectrophotometrically by calculating the concentration of pyrene from its extinction coefficient at 344 nm of 2.2 × 104m–1 cm–1 and correcting the determined absorbance at 280 nm for pyrene absorption using a ratio of 1.104 × E344 nm to allow calculation of the Tm concentration from its E280 nm of 4,760 m–1 cm–1. Binding of Troponin to Actin·Tm Filaments—Binding of Tn to actin·Tm filaments reconstituted with the different tropomyosins was measured by using a kinetic assay that measures the occupancy of the blocked B-state produced by Tn binding to and switching off actin·Tm in the absence of calcium. Fig. 2A shows raw kinetic data from a series of stop-flow measurements of myosin binding to actin·Tm filaments reconstituted with increasing quantities of Tn in the absence of calcium. As the Tn concentration was increased, the rate of myosin binding decreased. In terms of the three-state model, this is because of a decrease in the available fraction of actin (Equation 1). Fig. 2B shows the secondary plots of kobs versus Tn concentration for thin filaments containing tropomyosins 5a, 5b, and 5b-V154C along with skTm as a control. These give a functional assay of Tn binding and are fitted to the quadratic solution of a standard binding equilibrium, with the determined binding constants shown in Table I. As shown by previous works (31Wegner A. Walsh T.P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5633-5642Google Scholar, 32Cho Y.J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29457-29461Google Scholar), Tn binds to actin filaments reconstituted with skTm with a high affinity (<10 nm at these salt concentrations). Binding of Tn to filaments reconstituted with all of the exon 9d containing Tms is >10-fold weaker at 0.27 (±0.068) μm for Tm5a, 0.28 (±0.084) μm for Tm5b, and 0.41 (±0.094) μm for 5b-V154C.Table IParameters determined from curve fitsSkeletal TmTm5aTm5bTm5b-V154CTn Kd (μm) (calculated from kobs)<0.010.27 ± 0.0680.28 ± 0.0840.41 ± 0.094Tn Kd (μm) (calculated from equilibrium titration)N/A0.064 ± 0.007N/A0.51 ± 0.10pCa50%5.47 ± 0.045.50 ± 0.09nd6.19 ± 0.16Hill coefficient1.73 ± 0.211.88 ± 0.69nd1.90 ± 1.2 Open table in a new tab Fluorescence Labeling of Tm—Fig. 3A shows the emission spectra of pyrene-labeled Tm5b-V154C at 65% labeling ratio. The spectrum is essentially identical to that of pyrene-labeled Tm5a (not shown) and is similar to that previously measured for pyrene-labeled skeletal and smooth muscle Tms (12Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6894-6903Google Scholar, 13Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1160-1166Google Scholar), with monomer peaks at 385 and 405 nm and a broad excimer peak at 460 nm. Fluorescence spectra of Tm5b-V154C showing the effects of sequential addition of actin, troponin to saturation (in the absence of calcium), and then calcium are shown in Fig. 3B. A low labeling ratio was used for these experiments to give a reasonable ratio of the measured monomer fluorescence to excimer fluorescence. Excimer fluorescence was produced from Tms in a dimer, both strands having a fluorophor attached; if they are randomly distributed, the statistical fraction carrying two labels should be equal to the square of the total fraction of Tm-labeled. Thus, at the 30–40% labeling used, this gives a ratio of single- to double-labeled filaments between 1.5–2.33:1, giving a reasonable compromise between absolute signal and proportion of excimer fluorescence. Initial addition of actin gives a small increase in monomer fluorescence that is in rough proportion to a small decrease in excimer fluorescence. Subsequent addition of Tn produces ∼50% enhancement of the monomer fluorescence, with little change in excimer fluorescence. This saturates upon further addition of Tn, suggesting that this signal is caused by Tn binding to actin·Tm and is proportional to the amount of Tn bound. Addition of calcium to Tn-saturated filaments then causes no significant change in signal, showing that the change in fluorescence caused by Tn binding is not calcium sensitive. Fig. 3C shows a secondary plot of fluorescence change at 405 nm, where the largest relative change in monomer fluorescence is found, versus concentration of Tn added. This produces binding curves for Tn to the actin·Tm filaments for the two pyrene-labeled tropomyosins Tm5a and Tm5b-V154C. These curves are well fitted by a simple binding equilibrium as for the kinetic binding assays, providing additional evidence that the signal is directly proportional to the Tn bound. Results from the curve fits are shown in Table I, giving Tn affinities of 0.064 (±0.007) μm and 0.54 (±0.10) μm for Tm5a and Tm5b-V154C, respectively. Calcium Sensitivity of Reconstituted Regulated Filaments— The fraction of Tn with calcium bound can be assayed using basically the same kinetic assay as shown in Fig. 2. The fraction of Tn with calcium bound is directly proportional to the change in kobs for myosin binding to an excess of Tn-saturated thin filaments. Hence, the pCa (log10 [Ca2+]) dependence of kobs can be used as a direct measure of calcium binding to and regulatory switching of troponin. Fig. 4 shows secondary plots of fractional regulation of filaments versus pCa for Tm5a and Tm5b-V154C along with skeletal Tm as a control. The values determined for skTm are similar to those determined previously (35Head J.G. Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 694-699Google Scholar) with a K50% of 5.47 (±0.04) μm and a Hill coefficient of 1.73 (0.21). Tm5a produces a virtually identical curve with a K50% of 5.50 (±0.09) μm and Hill coefficient of 1.88 (±0.69). However, Tm5b-V154C produces a significantly different K50% of 6.19 (±0.16) μm, indicating almost an order of magnitude higher calcium sensitivity but, again, with a similar Hill coefficient of 1.90 (±1.2). The kinetic S1 binding assays show that the troponin has a much lower affinity for thin filaments reconstituted with fibroblast tropomyosins (lacking the skeletal exons 1a/9d) than those with skTm. The importance of the N-terminal TnT-Tm interaction for the high affinity binding of Tn has long been established from the original work of Mak and Smillie (40Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 541-550Google Scholar). This work has recently been supported by a series of CD-based measurements of the stability of complexes formed by peptides containing the N- and C-terminal exon sequences which showed that the N terminus of TnT interacts strongly with the 1a/9a exons found in skeletal Tm but weakly with the 1a/9d combination found in smooth Tm, and not at all with the 1b/9d exons found in the fibroblast Tms used here (10Palm T. Greenfield N.J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3181-3189Google Scholar). The kinetic assays show that replacement of exons 1a/1b and 9a/9d reduces Tn affinity for actin·Tm by >10-fold to 0.2–0.5 μm. This factor of at least 10 is a lower limit, as the binding curve for Tn to skTm·actin is too tight to give anything more than an upper limit for the Kd for Tn binding to actin·skTm. This result is in agreement with previous works that showed a 100-fold reduction in affinity by the replacement of 9a for 9d alone (9Hammell R.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4236-4242Google Scholar, 32Cho Y.J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10153-10157Google Scholar). The binding constants for the three proteins, 0.27 (±0.068) μm for Tm5a, 0.41 (±0.094) μm for Tm5b, and 0.28 (±0.084) μm 5b-V154C) are not very different from each other, especially considering the scatter on the data. The fluorescence-based equilibrium binding data are in general agreement with the kinetic data, showing affinities in a similar range for the PIA-labeled Tms. Our binding curves for Tn to actin·PIA Tm filaments are well fitted by a single-site binding model. In previous work, Ishii and Lehrer (13Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1160-1166Google Scholar) fitted their data of Tn binding to pyrene maleimide (PM)-labeled skTm in solution by a two-site model with different affinities for labeled and unlabelled Tm. The necessity for their use of a two-site binding model could be explained by a number of factors, including differences in binding to free Tm (their work) rather than actin·Tm filaments (ours), or the difference in the label used. Tm5a shows some evidence of a small decrease in Kd for binding to actin upon labeling (from 0.27 to 0.064 μm), which is in agreement with the previous data for labels attached to the cysteine in exon 6b, but 5b-V154C shows a small increase from 0.28 to 0.51 μm. These changes are relatively small and inconclusive because of the large scatter on the kinetic data. The data presented here show that, although lacking the primary N-terminal TnT interaction with Tm, the Tn complex does bind to the fibroblast isoforms with an affinity in the sub-micromolar range, and this does not change significantly upon the addition of calcium. The TnI·TnC complex has a very weak affinity for actin·Tm in the presence of calcium (41Hitchcock S.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 52: 255-263Google Scholar, 42Hitchcock S.E. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 2509-2513Google Scholar, 43Potter J.D.G. Gergely J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2697-2703Google Scholar, 44Zhou X. Morris E.P. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1128-1132Google Scholar). Therefore, our data indicate that the measured affinity is due to a secondary interaction specific to the presence of C-terminal TnT “head” region. It had been shown previously that the fluorescence enhancement produced by Tn binding to either isolated PM-labeled skTm (12Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6894-6903Google Scholar) or to actin·Tm thin filaments containing PIA Tm (13Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1160-1166Google Scholar) was not significantly calcium-dependent at similar near-physiological salt concentrations. However, in both these cases, the Tn was still anchored by the primary N-terminal TnT-Tm interaction, and it had been suggested that the Tm interaction in the TnT head region was weak, especially at higher salt concentrations (12Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6894-6903Google Scholar). Our kinetic data show that exon 6 does not effect the formation of the blocked state, produced by Tn in the absence of calcium, with equal occupancy of the blocked state determined for all of the Tms assayed. This finding is consistent with the work of Hammell and Hitchcock-DeGregori (6Hammell R.L. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22409-22416Google Scholar), who determined a similar inhibition in ATPase assays for their skTm-like constructs containing either exon 6a or 6b. However, although their biosensor assays suggested little interaction of TnT in isolation with exon 6 or 9d, our binding assays indicate that there is a calcium-independent interaction of the whole troponin complex with the exon 6 region on reconstituted thin filaments.

By using an unbiased functional screening with transfection and expression of a human brain cDNA library, we searched for genes that protect neuronal cells from toxicity by V642I-AβPP. One protective clone was identical to the human GTX, a neuronal homeobox gene. Human Gtx (hGtx) inhibited caspase inhibitor-sensitive neuronal cell death not only by V642I-AβPP but also by L648P-, NL-, A617G-AβPP, apolipoprotein E4, and Aβ. The region of hGtx responsible for this rescue function was specified to be its homeodomain (Lys148-His207). The rescue function was shared by DLX4, a distal-less family gene with a homeodomain only 38.3% homologous to that of hGtx, suggesting that this function would be generally shared by homeodomains. The neuroprotective function of hGtx was attributable to hGtx-stimulated production and secretion of insulin-like growth factor-I. This study provides molecular clues to understand how neuronal cells developmentally regulate themselves against cell death as well as to develop reagents effective in curative therapeutics of Alzheimer's disease.

This study provides molecular clues to understand how neuronal cells developmentally regulate themselves against cell death as well as to develop reagents effective in curative therapeutics of Alzheimer's disease. GTX, a neuronal homeobox gene, has been isolated from the postnatal mouse brain (1Komuro I. Schalling M. Jahn L. Bodmer R. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1387-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and is expressed in differentiated oligodendrocytes with its potential role for myelinization (2Awatramani R. Scherer S.

Neuroscience. 2000; 100: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is also termed as Nkx6.2. Gtx is also expressed in neural progenitors in ventral spinal cord and inhibits V0 neurons from being generated from the progenitors (4Vallstedt A. Muhr J. Pattyn A. Pierani A. Mendelsohn M. Sander M. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. Neuron. 2001; 31: 743-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Human GTX has also been cloned and mapped to chromosome 10q26, a region where frequent loss of heterozygosity has been observed in various malignant brain tumors (5Lee S.H. Davison J.A. Vidal S.M. Belouchi A. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mice lacking Gtx normally develop without apparent changes in the central nervous systems (6Cai J. Qi Y. Wu R. Modderman G. Fu H. Liu R. Qiu M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4399-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although information about the function of GTX is thus limited, it is accepted that homeobox genes encode regulatory proteins relevant to nuclear transcription, and that their coordinated activation is fundamental for temporal and spatial pattern formation in embryonic development. Molecular control of differentiation depends on lineage-restricted transcription factors that regulate expression of tissue-specific genes. Among the genes governing the development of Drosophila, sequential activation of homeotic and segmentation genes controls the identity, polarity, and number of segments. Many such genes, including the Antennapedia (Antp), Engrailed (En), and Paired (Prd) families, contain a characteristic ∼60-amino acid sequence motif, termed a homeobox (7McGinnis W. Klumrauf R. Cell. 1992; 68: 283-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that these genes act as sequence-specific transcription factors, Gtx binds to (A/T)TTAATGA as an optimal binding sequence and represses the transcription of the downstream genes (8Awatramani R.

Considering that these FAD mutants cause only a small fraction of total AD cases, such mechanistic complexity suggests that it may be difficult to identify a single anti-AD neuroprotective reagent solely based on the underlying mechanisms.

F11/EcR cells stably overexpressing both the EcD receptor (EcR) and the retinoid X receptor were established using the co-expression vector pVgRXR and Zeocin selection (Invitrogen), as described previously (13Hashimoto Y.

Transfection Protocols (F11 Cells)—For transient transfection of F11 cells with pcDNA, pEF-BOS, or pEF4/His plasmids, F11 cells were seeded at 7 × 104 cells/well in a 6-well plate and cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 18% FBS for 12-16 h, and were transfected with the plasmids (0.75 μg of pcDNA plasmid, 0.75 μg of pEF plasmid, 3 μl of LipofectAMINE, and 6 μl of LipofectAMINE PLUS for each well; Invitrogen) in the absence of serum for 3 h.

Death Trap Screening—F11/EcR/V642I cells, in which V642I-AβPP is overexpressed by treatment with EcD, were described previously (18Niikura T. Murayama N. Hashimoto Y. Ito Y. Yamagishi Y. Matsuoka M. Takeuchi Y. Aiso S. Nishimoto I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). By using these cells, in which death occurred in a vast majority of EcD-treated cells for a few days (18Niikura T. Murayama N. Hashimoto Y. Ito Y. Yamagishi Y. Matsuoka M. Takeuchi Y. Aiso S. Nishimoto I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we performed the death trap screening with our modifications. We first transfected F11/EcR/V642I cells with a mammalian expression cDNA library in pEF-BOS constructed from an occipital cortex of a necropsy-diagnosed AD patient, treated cells with EcD for 72 h, and recovered the plasmids from surviving cells. The recovered plasmids were again transfected to F11/EcR/V642I cells, which were then treated with EcD for 72 h. This procedure was repeated for three rounds, and we randomly picked 250 clones of plasmids. Using dot blot hybridization with randomly selected clones, we classified them into 36 independent groups. Subcloning of hGtx and Constructions of Deletion Mutants—To construct the tagged hGtx open reading frame (ORF) cDNA, we digested the DT236 by EcoRI and XbaI; the EcoRI site is 39 nucleotides upstream from the translation start codon ATG, and the XbaI site is in pEF-BOS vector, downstream from DT236 ORF. We subcloned the entire ORF of hGtx into pEF4-hGtx, with subsequent confirmation of the sequences. To construct pEF4-hGtx, pEF4 hGtxNT, and pEF4-hGtxCT, we digested DT236 and obtained two fragments corresponding residues at position 1-94 (plus 5′-untranslated upstream region of hGtx) and residues at position 95-277 (plus 5′-untranslated upstream region of hGtx), and subcloned each fragment into pEF4/His. To construct pEF4-hGtxΔP, we first performed PCR (using Pfu turbo-polymerase from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the following primers: the sense primer including the EcoRI site, 39 nucleotides upstream from the start codon of hGtx, was 5′-TTTTTTGTGTGGTGGAATTCCGGATGGGAG-3′; the antisense primer for hGtxΔP was 5′-TTTTCTAGATCAGTGCCGCTTGCGCCACTTG-3′. The sense primer for pEF4-hGtxH was 5′-TTTTTTGAATTCAAGAAGCACTCGCGCCCGACCTTC-3′, and the antisense primer was the same as the antisense primer for hGtxΔP. Each amplified fragment was subcloned into pEF4/His at the EcoRI site and the XbaI site. The sequences of deletion mutants were confirmed, and expression of each mutant was detected by anti-(His)6 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). DNA Sequence and Homology Search—Sequencing of the cloned cDNA fragments was performed using an automated sequencer (ABI-PRISM310 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Analysis of DNA homology was performed using BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Cytotoxicity and Viability Assays—Cytotoxicity was assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay, as described previously (13Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Ito Y. Nishimoto I. J. Biol.

In brief, cells were suspended by pipetting gently, and 50 μl of 0.4% trypan blue solution (Sigma) was mixed with 200 μl of cell suspension (final trypan blue concentration was 0.08%) at room temperature. Stained cells were counted within 3 min after being mixed with the trypan blue solution. The mortality of cells was then determined as a percentage of trypan blue-stained cells in total cells. The cell mortality thus assessed represents the population of dead cells in total cells, including both adhesive and floating cells, at the termination of experiments. Cell viability assay (Cell Counting Kit-8, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) was performed using WST-8 ([2-(2-methoxy-4 nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt), as described previously (25Hashimoto Y. Jiang H. Niikura T. Ito Y. Hagiwara A. Umezawa K. Abe Y. Murayama Y. Nishimoto I. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8401-8409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that in the F11 systems, the cell mortality assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay correlates reciprocally with the cell viability assessed by WST-8 assay (25Hashimoto Y.

Antibody and Immunoblot Analysis—The immunoblot analysis (20 μg/lane) of AβPP, PS1, PS2, and SOD1 was performed as described previously (13Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Ito Y. Nishimoto I. J. Biol.

For the blotting in Fig. 4B, anti-PS2 N-terminal fragment antibody (1/500 dilution), kindly provided by Drs. Taisuke Tomita and Takeshi Iwatsubo (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan), was used. Statistical Analysis—All experiments described in this study were repeated at least three times with independent transfections. Statistical analysis was performed with one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc test, in which p < 0.05 was assessed as significant. Disease-based Death Trap Screening—F11/EcR/V642I cells, in which V642I-AβPP was inducibly overexpressed by EcD treatment, were described previously (18Niikura T. Murayama N. Hashimoto Y. Ito Y. Yamagishi Y. Matsuoka M. Takeuchi Y. Aiso S. Nishimoto I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). By using these cells, in which death occurred in a vast majority of EcD-treated cells within a few days (18Niikura T. Murayama N. Hashimoto Y. Ito Y. Yamagishi Y. Matsuoka M. Takeuchi Y. Aiso S. Nishimoto I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we performed the death trap screening with a unique modification, termed disease-based death trap screening. In the original screening by Vito et al. (26Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), a normal tissue cDNA library was transfected to Jurkat cells, which were killed by T cell receptor antibody; library fragments were then recovered from surviving cells. In contrast, our approach was unique in that we employed an expression cDNA library constructed from an occipital lobe of an autopsy-diagnosed AD patient brain, as we reasoned that neuroprotective genes must be expressed in an occipital lobe of the AD brain. We first transfected F11/EcR/V642I cells with AD-1 library (human AD occipital lobe cDNA library in pEF-BOS), treated cells with EcD for 72 h, and recovered the plasmids from surviving cells. This procedure was repeated for three rounds, and we randomly picked 250 clones from the recovered plasmids. We classified all 250 clones into 36 independent groups by dot blot hybridization. One such gene was DT236. By using a simple transient transfection system with F11 neurohybrid cells (9Yamatsuji T. Matsui T. Okamoto T. Komatsuzaki K. Takeda S. Fukumoto H. Iwatsubo T. Suzuki N. Asami-Odaka A. Ireland S. Kinane T.B. Giambarella U. Nishimoto I. Science. 1996; 272: 1349-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we confirmed the antagonistic activity of DT236 against neuronal cell death by V642I-AβPP (Table I). When F11 cells were transfected with V642I-AβPP cDNA in pcDNA, 50-60% of cells underwent death by 72 h. As the transfection efficiency was constantly 65-70% under the employed conditions (13Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Ito Y. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34541-34551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it followed that most cells expressing this FAD gene were dead 72 h after the onset of transfection. When F11 cells were co-transfected with DT236, cell death by V642I AβPP was significantly suppressed. This result suggests that DT236 does inhibit neuronal cell death by V642I-AβPP.Table IEffect of DT236* Co-transfection result with pEF4/His vector instead of pEF-BOS.** p < 0.01 versus cytotoxicity by V6421-APP with pEF-BOS. Open table in a new tab * Co-transfection result with pEF4/His vector instead of pEF-BOS. ** p < 0.01 versus cytotoxicity by V6421-APP with pEF-BOS. The DT236 cDNA sequence had an ORF encoding a polypeptide consisting of 277 amino acids. This ORF sequence turned out to be identical to human GTX (GenBank™ accession number AAK13251) and showed an extreme homology to murine Gtx (mGtx, GenBank™ accession number L08074). Comparing human and murine GTX genes, the homology was 88.6% in the nucleotide level and 97.5% in the amino acid level. The hGtx homeodomain exhibited high similarity to that of Nkx6.1 (27Inoue H. Rudnick A. German M.S. Veile R. Donis-Keller H. Permutt M.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), indicating that Nkx6.1 is a close relative of Gtx (Fig. 1). Generally, the hGtx homeodomain also showed a limited homology (30-45%) to most homeodomain sequences (Fig. 1). The homology of the homeodomain of hGTX with that of Nkx6.1 or DLX4, a distal-less X4 gene (28Quinn L.M. Johnson B.V. Nicholl J. Sutherland G.R. Kalionis B. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 187: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Bendall A.J. Abate-Shen C. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 247: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), was 97 or 38.3%, respectively. The C-terminal portion of hGtx showed structural similarity to the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain of some regulatory proteins, and the N-terminal arm and the third helix of the homeodomain interact specifically with bases in the minor and major grooves of DNA, respectively (30Scott M.P. Tamkun J.W. Hartzell III, G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 25-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 31Kissinger C.R. Liu B. Martin-Blanco E. Kornberg T.B. Pabo C.O.

Cell. 1991; 67: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). This information suggests that hGtx functions as a nuclear transcription factor, not only as a homeobox protein but also as other types of DNA-binding proteins. hGtx Inhibits Neuronal Cell Death by Overexpression of V642I-AβPP—We constructed pEF4-hGtx by inserting the ORF of hGtx into the polycloning site in pEF4/His. We examined the effect of pEF4-hGtx on death of F11 neurohybrid cells caused by either V642I-AβPP or NL-AβPP in pcDNA using the 1.5-μg protocol (Fig. 2A). Neuronal cell death by V642I-AβPP was significantly suppressed by pEF4-hGtx but not by the empty pEF vector (Fig. 2A). Co-transfection of pEF4-hGtx did not critically affect expression of V642I-AβPP, as compared with the case that co-transfected with empty pEF4/His (Fig. 2A, inset). Although cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven expression of V642I-AβPP was inhibited by hGtx to 70-80% of its expression with pEF4/His co-transfection, the attenuated level of V642I-AβPP expression was still 6-7 times higher than the expression level of endogenous AβPP. Thus, it was highly likely that neurotoxicity inhibition by hGtx was not due to the inhibition of V642I-AβPP expression. In further support, neuronal cell death by NL-AβPP was not suppressed by hGtx when hGtx similarly inhibited the expression level of NL-AβPP (see below). hGtx Inhibits Neuronal Cell Death by Antibody—To confirm that the cytoprotective effect of hGtx was not due to hGtxmediated inhibition of V642I-AβPP expression, we examined whether hGtx can also inhibit F11 neurohybrid cell death caused by extracellularly added Aβ1-43. Aβ is the major constituent of senile plaques, extracellular deposits characteristic for AD, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Whereas F11 cells per se were not killed by Aβ1-43, as reported previously (9Yamatsuji T. Matsui T. Okamoto T. Komatsuzaki K. Takeda S. Fukumoto H. Iwatsubo T. Suzuki N. Asami-Odaka A. Ireland S.
