https://openalex.org/W1577992062,"Obesity has increased at an alarming rate in recent years and is now a worldwide public health problem. In addition to suffering poor health and an increased risk of illnesses such as hypertension and heart disease, obese people are often stigmatized socially. But major advances have now been made in identifying the components of the homeostatic system that regulates body weight, including several of the genes responsible for animal and human obesity. A key element of the physiological system is the hormone leptin, which acts on nerve cells in the brain (and elsewhere) to regulate food intake and body weight. The identification of additional molecules that comprise this homeostatic system will provide further insights into the molecular basis of obesity, and possibilities for new treatments."

Knowing that a class of medium-sized peptides (magainins1) are widely used by host organisms as a defence against microbial invasion2, we developed a β-amino-acid oligomer (β-peptide) that mimics these natural antibiotics and tested it for antimicrobial activity. We find not only that the activity of our β-peptide is comparable to that of a magainin derivative but also that it is effective against four bacterial species, including two pathogens that are resistant to common antibiotics."

https://openalex.org/W1646684108,"The desire to maximize the sensitivity of read/write heads (and thus the information density) of magnetic storage devices has stimulated interest in the discovery and design of new magnetic materials exhibiting magnetoresistance. Recent discoveries include the 'colossal' magnetoresistance in the manganites and the enhanced magnetoresistance in low-carrier-density ferromagnets. An important feature of these systems is that the electrons involved in electrical conduction are different from those responsible for the magnetism. The latter are localized and act as scattering sites for the mobile electrons, and it is the field tuning of the scattering strength that ultimately gives rise to the observed magnetoresistance. Here we argue that magnetoresistance can arise by a different mechanism in certain ferromagnets--quantum interference effects rather than simple scattering. The ferromagnets in question are disordered, low-carrier-density magnets where the same electrons are responsible for both the magnetic properties and electrical conduction. The resulting magnetoresistance is positive (that is, the resistance increases in response to an applied magnetic field) and only weakly temperature-dependent below the Curie point."
https://openalex.org/W1628882936,"Capuchins will voluntarily share treats with other monkeys that helped to secure them. Cooperative hunting, in which several individuals pursue prey but only one makes a capture, is central to theories of human social and moral evolution1,2,3. But among other primates, it is known only from the chimpanzee and a large-brained neotropical monkey, the capuchin4,5,6,7. It probably evolved through either mutualism, in which two or more cooperators benefit simultaneously, or reciprocal altruism, in which one favour is repaid by another8,9. We have found that brown capuchins (Cebus apella) share rewards obtained by a joint effort more readily than rewards obtained individually. Even if hunting in the field involves selfish opportunism, this food incentive will greatly enhance the persistence of cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W2018170238,"We have previously shown that Ikaros can repress transcription through the recruitment of histone deacetylase complexes. Here we provide evidence that Ikaros can also repress transcription through its interactions with the co-repressor, C-terminal binding protein (CtBP). CtBP interacts with Ikaros isoforms through a PEDLS motif present at the N terminus of these proteins but not with homologues like Aiolos which lack this motif. Mutations in Ikaros that prevent CtBP interactions reduce its ability to repress transcription. CtBP interacts with Sin3A but not with the Mi-2 co-repressor and it represses transcription in a manner that is independent of histone deacetylase activity. These data strongly suggest that CtBP contributes to a histone deacetylase activity independent mechanism of repression by Ikaros. Finally, we show that the viral oncoprotein E1A, which binds to CtBP, also shows a strong association with Ikaros. This Ikaros-E1A interaction may underlie Ikaros's decreased ability to repress transcription in E1A transformed cells.

Mice homozygous for a null mutation in Ikaros lack B cells and their earliest described progenitors and are impaired in T cell differentiation (2.Wang J. Nichogiannopoulou A. Wu L. Sun L. Sharpe A.

The more severe phenotype of the dominant negative Ikaros mutation suggested the existence of homologues and led to the identification of Aiolos (5.Morgan B. Sun L. Avitahl N. Andrikopoulos K.

In addition to its role in differentiation, Ikaros plays an important role in regulating proliferation. Mice expressing reduced levels of Ikaros exhibit augmented T cell receptor-mediated proliferative responses and develop leukemias and lymphomas with complete penetrance (8.Winandy S. Wu P. Georgopoulos K. Cell. 1995; 83: 289-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 9.Avitahl N. Winandy S. Friedrich C. Jones B. Ge Y. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, Ikaros is an essential regulator of lymphocyte differentiation and homeostasis. Aiolos plays a similar role to Ikaros in the B cell lineage (10.Wang J.-H. Avitahl N. Cariappa A. Friedrich C. Ikeda T. Renold A. Andrikopoulos K. Liang L. Pillai S.A. Georgopoulos K.

The Ikaros gene encodes by means of alternative splicing at least eight different isoforms all of which contain a bipartite activation domain (11.Molnár Á. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell.

Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Ikaros isoforms differ in the number of N-terminal DNA-binding zinc fingers that consequently differentiates them into DNA binding and non-DNA binding proteins (11.Molnár Á. Georgopoulos K. Mol.

We and others have shown that the DNA-binding isoforms of Ikaros can activate transcription of genes when bound in cis to Ikaros-binding sites (11.Molnár Á. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell.

In contrast, Ikaros represses transcription when recruited to DNA through a heterologous DNA-binding domain (15.Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This repression is cell type- and promoter-specific and is effected through two repression domains which interact with the mSin3 (15.Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and Mi-2 proteins (16.Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller B. Winandy S. Veil A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R.

Consistent with a role for histone deacetylases in Ikaros-mediated repression, histones are underacetylated in the vicinity of Ikaros recruitment sites and the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin, alleviates repression by Gal4-Ikaros (15.Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In addition to histone deacetylase-dependent mechanisms of repression used by transcription factors such as MAD (21.Laherty C.D. Yang W.-M. Sun J.-M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), the unliganded nuclear receptor proteins (22.Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T. Soederstroem M.

Damjanovski S. Vermaak D. Meric F. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3958-3968Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recent studies also indicate that some repressors like Rb2(25.Luo R. Postigo A. Dean D. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), mSin3 (26.Wong C. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6632-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) may utilize both of these strategies of repression. Another co-repressor that may fall into this category is the C-terminal-binding protein, CtBP, so named for its identification as an interactor of the C-terminal of adenovirus E1A (30.Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 31.Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In vivo studies have established that deletion of the region of E1A that facilitates its interaction with CtBP significantly increases the transforming and tumorogenic potential of this oncoprotein (30.Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). At least two highly related CtBP proteins, CtBP1 and CtBP2, have been identified in vertebrates (32.Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 33.Katsanis N. Fisher E.M.C. Genomics. 1998; 47: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). CtBP1 transcripts are expressed in most human tissues at approximately the same level as CtBP2 transcripts except in the thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes where the latter are hardly detectable (34.Sewalt R.G.A.B. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Satijn D.P.E. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which CtBP effects repression is largely unclear. Based on the observation that severalDrosophila repressors that recruit CtBP work over distances of less than 100 base pairs to inhibit the core promoter, it has been suggested that CtBP may function as a short range repressor (35.Nibu Y. Zhang H. Bajor E. Barolo S. Small S. Levine M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7009-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). There is evidence from overexpression studies that CtBP can interact with histone deacetylase 1 (36.Sundqvist A. Sollerbrant K. Svensson C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and that in some cases repression by Gal4-CtBP can be relieved by deacetylase inhibitors (37.Criqui-Filipe P. Ducret C. Maira S.M. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3392-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). CtBP has also been described to repress promoters that are unresponsive to trichostatin (38.Meloni A. Smith E. Nevins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9574-9579Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). CtBP is targeted to DNA through its association with transcription factors containing a sequence that is similar to the consensus motif, PXDLS (31.Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 39.Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A number of transcription factors with this motif have been shown to interact with CtBP. These include transcription factors such as Knirps (35.Nibu Y. Zhang H. Bajor E. Barolo S. Small S. Levine M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7009-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and Hairy (40.Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M.

Mutations in the PXDLS motif that prevent interaction with CtBP have been shown to decrease the ability of several of these proteins to repress transcription both in vivo and in vitro(32.Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 34.Sewalt R.G.A.B. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Satijn D.P.E. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell.

Genetic studies in flies have shown that CtBP is required for appropriate segmentation and dorso-ventral patterning (35.Nibu Y. Zhang H. Bajor E. Barolo S. Small S. Levine M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7009-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar,40.Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) while similar studies in Xenopus also provide a role for CtBP later in the development of head and notochord structures (41.Brannon M. Brown J.D. Bates R. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Development. 1999; 126: 3159-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we provide evidence that Ikaros can repress transcription through its interaction with CtBP. This is the first functional difference between Ikaros and its family members which cannot interact directly with CtBP. Although CtBP can interact with Sin3A/HDAC but not with Mi-2/HDAC, CtBP continues to repress transcription even in the presence of histone deacetylase inhibitors. Finally, we show that Ikaros association with the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A alleviates its ability to repress transcription. Flag-Ik1, Flag-Ik1cm, Flag-hCtBP1, Flag-CtN1, -CtN2, -CtC1, -CtC2, and -CtC3 were constructed by standard cloning techniques in the pCMV2-Flag vector (Sigma). Mutations in the CtBP interaction domain on Ikaros were generated by a polymerase chain reaction based approach. BXG1-hCtBP1, the related N- and C-terminal deletions of hCtBP1 and different domains of Ikaros lacking or containing mutations in the CtBP interaction domain were constructed by cloning the relevant regions into the BXG1 vector (15.Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) which encodes the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147). CDM8-Ik1, -2, -3, -7, -Flag-Aio3, -Flag Helios, -HA Sin3B, -Mi2, MT-Sin3A, BXG1-Ik1, -Aio, -IKD2, -IKD5, -MAD, -mMAD, -Sin3BSF and the reporters 4XIKBS2tkCAT, G5tkCAT, and G5AdMLPCAT have been previously reported (15.Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). CDM8-Daedalus was a generous gift of Dr. B. Morgan. GST-hCtBP1, T7-hCtBP1, and anti-CtBP were generously provided by Dr. G. Chinnadurai (39.Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). CMV-13SE1A and the corresponding empty vector were provided by Dr. N. Dyson. 293T, NIH3T3, and U20S cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Transfections of these cell lines were carried out using the HBS-CaP04 method. For activation assays, 0.25 μg of Flag-tagged Ikaros plasmids, 3 μg of the 4XIKBS2tkCAT reporter, and 0.5 μg of the pXGH5 growth hormone transfection efficiency control plasmid were used. For repression assays, 0.5 or 1 μg of the Gal4-fusion plasmid, 5 or 10 μg of the Gal4-reporter plasmid, and 0.5 μg of the pXGH5 control plasmid were used. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were fed with fresh medium and 18–24 h later cells were harvested and processed for CAT assays as described (15.Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In those instances where trichostatin A (Upstate Biotech) was employed, we added the drug to the cells 16–18 h before harvesting. GH assays were done as recommended by the manufacturer (Nichols Institute). Transfections were typically performed in duplicate and repeated between three and six times. Whole cell extracts from 293T cells transfected with the relevant plasmids were prepared as described previously (15.Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and pre-cleared using Protein G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The pre-cleared extracts were incubated with the antibody of interest or the relevant isotype control on ice for 1 h. 30 μl of Protein G beads were then added to the extract and the extracts were rotated overnight. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with TS buffer (12.Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The beads obtained after this procedure were treated with SDS sample buffer, boiled at 95 °C for 15 min, and loaded on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel along with 8–10% of the cell extract used for the immunoprecipitation. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with the relevant antibody, and examined by autoradiography with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibodies used were: T7 (Novagen), Myc tag (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), HA (BAbCO), Flag M2 (Sigma), Gal4, Sin3B (Santa Cruz), HDAC2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), E1A (Oncogene Science), and anti-Ikaros, Aiolos, and Mi-2 which have been previously described (5.Morgan B.

Preparation of thymic nuclear extracts was essentially as described in Ref. 11.Molnár Á. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 785-794Google Scholar. 1–2 μg of the GST proteins were incubated with thymic nuclear extracts or reticulocyte lysate (Promega) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed extensively with MT-phosphate-buffered saline. The beads were then boiled in SDS sample buffer and fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblotting was done as described in the previous section. Histone deacetylase assays were performed on tritiated chicken reticulocyte histones as described (44.Kolle D. Brosch G. Lechner T. Lusser A.A. Loidl P. Methods. 1998; 15: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitates from 293T whole cell extracts were washed 3× in TS buffer and incubated with 100,000 cpm of tritiated acetylated histones for 45 min at 30 °C in HD assay buffer. The reaction was stopped by acidification and the released tritium was extracted with ethyl acetate. We have previously reported that Ikaros and Aiolos, when fused to the GAL4-DNA-binding domain, can function as transcriptional repressors in a promoter and cell type specific manner. The repression mediated by Gal4-Ikaros and Gal4-Aiolos on the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) was found to be significantly relieved but not abolished by the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A. Thus, we argued that histone deacetylase recruitment serves as one mechanism for Gal4-Ikaros and Gal4-Aiolos repression on the AdMLP. In agreement with these findings, Ikaros was found to associate with the NURD and Sin3 histone deacetylase complexes. A careful analysis of the primary sequence of the murine Ikaros protein led to the identification of a 5-amino acid sequence, PEDLS, at its N terminus (Fig. 1 A), that matches the consensus recognition motif for the C-terminal-binding protein co-repressor, CtBP (30.Boyd J.M. Subramanian T. Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 31.Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This sequence is conserved between all the described Ikaros orthologs found in chicken, rainbow trout, and zebra fish but is not present in the Ikaros family members: Aiolos, Helios, and Daedalus (Fig. 1 A). However, both Daedalus and Helios contain the sequences, PEDLG and PISLI, respectively, in their last exon, that varies significantly from the well established consensus CtBP interaction motif. Given the putative CtBP-binding site in Ikaros, we tested their interaction using bacterially purified GST-hCtBP1 and thymic nuclear extracts and reticulocyte lysates. We have restricted our study to hCtBP1 since CtBP2 is not expressed in the thymus (34.Sewalt R.G.A.B. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Satijn D.P.E. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). GST-CtBP but not the GST fusion partner interacted with endogenous Ikaros protein from both sources (Fig. 1 B). Importantly, a small amount of CtBP was also found to be present in Ikaros complexes purified from T cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 1 C) (16.Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller B. Winandy S. Veil A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Thus, Ikaros can interact with CtBP both in vitro and in vivo. To examine the importance of the PEDLS motif in Ikaros-CtBP interactions, we constructed two mutations. In the first, we deleted this 5-amino acid region (Ik1d(PEDLS)) and in the second we mutated the core amino acids DL → AS (Ik1cm) in the context of the full-length protein. We transfected these mutants with hCtBP1 tagged with T7 into 293T cells and performed immunoprecipitations. Neither of the Ikaros mutants was able to interact with CtBP (Fig.2 A). We then tested the impact of these mutations on the ability of Ikaros to associate with components of the NURD and Sin3 histone deacetylase complexes. Both of the Ikaros mutants interacted with Mi-2β, Sin3A, Sin3B, and HDAC2 in a fashion indistinguishable from wild type (Fig. 2 B and data not shown for Sin3B). Consistent with these results, Flag-Ikaros or Flag-Ik1cm immunoprecipitated from transfected 293T cells had similar histone deacetylase activities (Fig. 2 E). These data underscore the importance and specificity of the PEDLS motif in Ikaros-CtBP interactions. In addition, it shows that the ability of Ikaros to interact with CtBP or its lack thereof does not influence its interactions with histone deacetylase complexes. At least eight different splice variants of Ikaros have been described (11.Molnár Á. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 785-794Google Scholar, 12.Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 13.Hahm K. Ernst P. Lo K. Kim G.S. Turck C. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Using the 293T transfection/immunoprecipitation approach we tested whether hCtBP1 could distinguish between these proteins. All tested isoforms including the non-DNA binding isoform, Ik7, interacted with CtBP (Fig. 2 C). This was expected since all isoforms contain the PEDLS motif. In addition, point mutations of the C-terminal zinc fingers of Ikaros that abolish formation of a higher order complex (12.Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) had no effect on Ikaros interactions with CtBP (data not shown). We next examined whether the Ikaros family members, Aiolos, Helios, and Daedalus could interact with CtBP by co-expressing these proteins in 293T cells. None of these proteins interacted in our assay despite the presence of sequences in Daedalus and Helios with weak homology to the described CtBP interaction motif (Fig. 2 D). Taken together these data indicate that all of the Ikaros isoforms but not its family members can interact with CtBP. This interaction is mediated through a PEDLS sequence present at the N-terminal of the protein and does not rely on the DNA binding or dimerization properties of Ikaros. Finally, this is the first described protein interaction that distinguishes between Ikaros and its family members. In lymphocytes a large fraction of Ikaros is found in association with its family member Aiolos (5.Morgan B. Sun L. Avitahl N. Andrikopoulos K. Gonzales E. Nichogiannopoulou A. Wu P. Neben S. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2004-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 16.Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller B. Winandy S. Veil A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In the preceding section we provided evidence that Ikaros but not Aiolos can interact with CtBP. Thus, we were interested in determining whether CtBP could exist in association with Ikaros and Aiolos or whether it was excluded from their complex. The three proteins were co-expressed in 293T cells and immunoprecipitated using the Flag epitope attached to CtBP. As a control for this analysis, we transfected Ik1cm (an Ikaros-CtBP interaction mutant) with Aiolos and CtBP. Immunoprecipitation of cell extracts containing wild type Ikaros but not of extracts containing the mutant variant, Ik1cm, brought down Aiolos (Fig.3 A). Thus Ikaros, Aiolos, and CtBP can exist in a ternary complex when expressed in the same cell. Using the same procedure, we next tested whether Mi-2β, a component of the NURD histone deacetylase complex could exist in a ternary complex with Ikaros and CtBP. Unlike Aiolos, no interactions were seen between the Ikaros-CtBP complexes and Mi-2β (Fig. 3 B). Immunopurification of Flag-CtBP complexes from 293T cells revealed that CtBP associates with a small amount of endogenous Sin3A and HDAC2 regardless of whether wild type Ikaros or Ik1cm was present (Fig.3 C). These findings were independently confirmed by GST interaction assays (data not shown). In summary, Ikaros and CtBP can exist in a ternary complex with Aiolos but not with Mi-2β, a component of the NURD histone deacetylase complex. Also, CtBP co-purifies with a small fraction of endogenous Sin3A and HDAC2 in the absence of Ikaros. The Ikaros-independent ability of CtBP to interact with histone deacetylases was further investigated and was found to be heavily influenced by epitopes attached to its N terminus; T7 tagged CtBP does not interact with HDAC2 and Flag-CtBP interacts weakly whereas the strongest interaction was seen"

It differs from other well characterized AhpC proteins in that it has three rather than one or two cysteine residues.

Analysis of the M. tuberculosis genome identified a second protein, AhpD, which has no sequence identity with AhpC but is under the control of the same promoter. This protein has also been cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized. AhpD, which has only been identified in the genomes of mycobacteria and Streptomyces viridosporus, is shown here to also be an alkylhydroperoxidase. The endogenous electron donor for catalytic turnover of the two proteins is not known, but both can be turned over with AhpF fromSalmonella typhimurium or, particularly in the case of AhpC, with dithiothreitol. AhpC and AhpD reduce alkylhydroperoxides more effectively than H2O2 but do not appear to interact with each other. These two proteins appear to be critical elements of the antioxidant defense system of M. tuberculosis and may be suitable targets for the development of novel anti-tuberculosis strategies.

Chemistry in Britain. 1998; 34: 38-42Google Scholar). Worldwide, infection rates are increasing although in the United States the rate of tuberculosis infection has begun to decrease after an increase in the late 1980s (2.Snider D.E.J. Roper W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 703-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). A very alarming observation is the appearance of M. tuberculosis strains resistant to many of the front-line compounds, including isoniazid, that are currently utilized to treat the disease (3.Zumla A. Grange J. Br. Med. J. 1998; 316: 1962-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Middlebrook and co-workers (4.Middlebrook G. Cohn M.C. Shaffer W.B. Am. Rev. Tuberc. Pulm. Dis. 1954; 70: 852-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observed in the 1950s that M. tuberculosis strains resistant to isoniazid were devoid of catalase/peroxidase activity. This circumstantial link between peroxidase and isoniazid activities was placed on a molecular footing by Heym et al. (5.Heym B. Zhang Y. Poulet S. Young D. Cole S.T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4255-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 6.Heym B. Alzari P.M. Honore N. Cole S.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), who showed that isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis strains had deletions or mutations in the katG gene that encodes for the KatG catalase/peroxidase. The importance of KatG in the action of isoniazid was confirmed by the demonstration that transformation ofEscherichia coli or Mycobacterium smegmatis, both of which are isoniazid resistant, with the katG gene rendered them sensitive to isoniazid (7.Zhang Y. Garbe T. Young D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Johnson and Schultz (8.Johnson K. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 116: 7425-7426Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar) showed that isoniazid is oxidized by the M. tuberculosis KatG catalase/peroxidase to a number of chemically reactive products. These combined results imply that isoniazid is a prodrug that must be processed into its active form by the bacterial cell. The critical target of activated isoniazid is not yet clear. Evidence exists that this role is played by the inhA gene product, an enoyl reductase (9.Benerjee A. Dubnau E. Quernard A. Balasubramanian V. Um K.S. Wilson T. Collins D. de Lisle G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Science. 1994; 263: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar), and/or by KasA, a β-ketoacyl synthase (10.Mdluli K. Slayden R.A. Zhu Y. Ramaswamy S. Pan X. Mead D. Crane D.D. Musser J.M. Barry III, C.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Both of these enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of mycolic acid, an essential constituent of the M. tuberculosis cell wall. It is not yet clear whether one or both of these proteins is the principal target, or whether there are additional targets for activated isoniazid (11.Mdluli K. Sherman D.R. Hickey M.J.

Drug Resistance Updates. 1998; 1: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In view of the requirement for the activation of isoniazid by the KatG catalase/peroxidase, one strategy used by the organism to overcome its sensitivity to isoniazid is to suppress the catalase/peroxidase activity through mutation of the katG gene. However, the survival of the bacterium requires that it compensate in some manner for loss of the catalase/peroxidase, as it must still attenuate the oxidative stress caused by peroxides and other reactive oxygen species.M. tuberculosis primarily resides in the macrophages of the host, where it is subjected to a highly oxidative environment (13.Fenton M.J. Vermeulen M.W. Infection and Immunology. 1996; 64: 683-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Chan J. Kaufmann S.H.E. Bloom B.R. Immune Mechanisms of Protection. Tuberculosis: Pathogenesis, Protection, and Control. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1994Google Scholar). This environment includes peroxides formed by the oxidative burst, species such as peroxynitrite formed by the inducible nitric oxide synthase, and the alkyl peroxides that result from exposure of unsaturated lipids to oxidative stress. Analysis of the genes induced in isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis indicates that one of the mechanisms used by the organism to compensate for loss of the KatG antioxidant activity is to up-regulate the ahpC gene product, which codes for a non-hemoprotein alkylhydroperoxidase (15.Sherman D.R.

Incubation of M. tuberculosis expressing elevated levels of the alkylhydroperoxidase with isoniazid has shown that the drug is not activated by this enzyme (15.Sherman D.R. Mdluli K. Hickey M.J. Arain T.M. Morris S.L. Barry C.E. Stover C.K. Science. 1996; 272: 1641-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). AhpC thus differs from KatG in its interactions with isoniazid. Very little is known about the M. tuberculosisalkylhydroperoxidase in terms of its structure or catalytic mechanism, as the protein has not yet been purified and investigated. The most studied member of the alkylhydroperoxidase family is the enzyme fromSalmonella typhimurium (20.Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13349-13356Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21.Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13357-13364Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This protein contains two cysteine sulfhydryls that catalyze the reduction of peroxides to the corresponding alcohols and water with concomitant oxidation of the cysteine residues to give a disulfide bond (SchemeFS1). A sulfenic acid derivative of one of the two sulfhydryl groups is thought to be a transient intermediate in the formation of the disulfide link (22.Yeh J.E. Claiborne A. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9951-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23.Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15013-15018Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The catalytic cycle is completed by reduction of the disulfide bond using AhpF, a flavoprotein reductase (Scheme FS2) (21.Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13357-13364Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The protein required to reduce the AhpC disulfide bond is not the same in all organisms. Thus, in yeast the alkylhydroperoxidase is coupled to thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase rather than to an AhpF-like protein (24.Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure FS2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The M. tuberculosis genome has been sequenced in its entirety (25.Hamlin N.

No ahpF gene appears to be present, although a number of flavoproteins of unknown function are found in the genome. In S. typhimurium the ahpF gene is found immediately downstream of the ahpC gene. The corresponding position in the M. tuberculosis genome is occupied by a gene that, because of its position in the sequence, was named ahpD. AhpD exhibits no sequence similarity with either ahpCor ahpF and its function is unknown. We report here the first expression and purification of the M. tuberculosisAhpC and AhpD proteins and their initial structural and catalytic characterization. Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing were performed by the Biomolecular Resource Center of the University of California, San Francisco. A Perkin-Elmer 480 DNA thermal cycler was used for PCR1 experiments. The pGem-T and pET23a plasmids were from Novagen (Madison, WI). Plasmid pACYC was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Restriction enzymes and Vent DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs and Promega (Madison, WI). Plasmids were purified using the Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA) Quick-Prep kit.

LB medium was from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma. An Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Sephadex 200 column, connected to an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech PCC-500 FPLC system, was used to determine the native aggregation state of each protein.

The ahpC gene was generously provided by Clifton E. Barry as a 1.3-kilobase NotI-PstI fragment in pMH91 (16.Sherman D.R. Sabo P.J. Hickey M.J. Arain T.M. Mahairas G.G. Yuan Y. Barry C.E. Stover C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6625-6629Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The open reading frame for the ahpC gene was amplified by PCR with the following primers (forward: 5′-CGCTAGGTACCATATGCCACTGCTAACCATTGGC-3′; reverse: 5′-TCTAGAGGATCCTTAGGCCGAAGCCTTGAGGAG-3′). The primers coded for an NdeI restriction site at the ATG codon and aBamHI site following the stop (TAA) codon. The reaction contained 50 ng of pMH91, 50 pmol each of the primers, 1 mmdNTPs, and 10 units of Vent DNA polymerase (NEB) in a final volume of 50 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgSO4, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The annealing and extension cycles were as follows: 94 °C for 10 min (1 cycle), 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min (10 cycles), 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min (20 cycles), and 72 °C for 10 min (1 cycle). Following gel purification of the amplified product the 0.59-kilobase gene was digested withNdeI and BamHI, ligated into pGem-T, and subcloned into pET 23a. This plasmid was called pEahpC. A second vector was constructed in which a 6-His tag was added to the 3′ end of the ahpC gene using the primer 5′-TCTAGACTCGAGGGCCGAAGCCTTGAGGAG-3′. This primer encoded for anXhoI site that removed the stop codon. The PCR conditions were identical to the above reaction. This plasmid was called pEahpC-histag.

Following gel purification of the amplified product the 0.55-kilobase gene was digested with NdeI andSalI. The ahpD gene was then inserted into pACYC using the available NdeI and SalI sites. This plasmid was called pACahpD. The single cysteine to serine mutants of the 3 cysteine residues of AhpC and 2 cysteine residues of AhpD were made using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The PCR conditions were as follows: 50 ng of pEahpC (without his-tag) or pACahpD, 125 ng of each primer, 50 μm each dNTP, 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase, and 5 μl of 10× Pfu buffer in a total volume of 50 μl. The cycling parameters were: 95 °C for 30 s (1 cycle), 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 8.4 min (16 cycles). After amplification the PCR mixture was incubated with 20 units of DpnI for 1 h at 37 °C and then 1 μl was used to transform 50 μl of DH5α cells. The mutations where confirmed by DNA sequencing. The primers used for the mutagenesis were: C61S, forward primer: 5′-TTCACGTTCGTGTCCCCTACCGAG-3′, reverse primer: 5′-CTCGGTAGGGGACACGAACGTGAA-3′; C174S, forward primer: 5′-GACGAGCTGTCCGCATGCAACTGG-3′, reverse primer: 5′-CCAGTTGCATGCGGACAGCACGTC-3′; C176S, forward primer: 5′-GAGCTGTGCGCATCCAACTGGCGC-3′, reverse primer: 5′-GCGCCAGTTGGATGCGCACAGCAC-3′. In the case of ahpD mutagenesis, the C129S primers were: forward: 5′-GCGATCAACGGGTCCTCGCATTGCCTC-3′, reverse: 5′-GAGGCAATGCGAGGACCC-GTTGATCGC-3′. The primers for the C132S mutations were: forward: 5′-GGGTGCTCGCATTCCCTCGTCGCCCAC-3′, reverse: 5′-GTGGGCGACGAGGGAATGCGAGCACCC-3′. The underlined codons represent the cysteine mutation, with the boldface letters indicating the nucleotide changed to facilitate the mutation. Bacterial growth was carried out at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (for pEahpC) or 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol (for pACahpD and pAF1). One colony was used to inoculate 50 ml of LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotic, and the culture was incubated for 10 h. The culture was used to inoculate a 1-liter culture of LB containing the appropriate antibiotic at a ratio of 10 ml/liter. When the A 600 value of the culture reached 0.7–1.0, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm for pEahpC and pAF1, and 0.2 mm for pACahpD. Incubation was continued for 3–3.5 h at 37 °C for pEahpC and pAF1, and 20 °C for pACahpD. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 45 min, 4 °C, and stored at −20 °C overnight. Cells were suspended in a 4-fold excess (with respect to the initial weight of cells) of lysis buffer (50 mmKPi, pH 7.0, 1.0 mm DTT, 1.0 mmEDTA, 44 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 5% glycerol, and 5% lysozyme). The solution was stirred 60 min at 4 °C. The cells were then sonicated using a Branson sonicator with 4 bursts of 30 s at 45 W with 30 s intervals. The cell debris was precipitated by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and PEI was added to a final concentration of 0.005%. The solution was stirred for 15 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The PEI supernatant was then loaded onto the Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (1.5 × 12 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.0, 1.0 mm DTT, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. After loading, the resin was washed with the same buffer for 10 column volumes, followed by a wash with buffer containing 0.2 mKCl for 10 column volumes. The protein was eluted with a gradient from 0.2 to 0.4 m KCl in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.0, 1.0 mm DTT, 1.0 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol. The protein eluted at approximately 0.25 m KCl. Fractions containing pure AhpC, as assessed by denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gels, were pooled, concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell using a YM10 membrane, and dialyzed against 20 mmKPi, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, and 5% glycerol (3 × 2 liter). The protein was stored at −70 °C until used. Cells were suspended in a 6-fold excess (with respect to the initial weight of cells) of lysis buffer. The solution was stirred 60 min at 4 °C. A PEI supernatant was prepared and loaded onto the Q-Sepharose column as described for AhpC. After loading, the resin was washed with the same buffer for 20 column volumes. The protein was eluted with a gradient from 0 to 0.1 m KCl in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.0, 1.0 mm DTT, 1.0 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol. The protein eluted at approximately 0.03 m KCl. Fractions containing pure AhpD, as assessed by denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gels, were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 50 mm KPi, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol (3 × 2 liter). The protein was stored at −70 °C until used. This enzyme was purified according to the protocol of Poole and Ellis with slight modifications (30.Poole L.B. Ellis H.R. Biochem. 1996; 35: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Nucleic acids were removed with 0.005% PEI, and the ammonium sulfate precipitation steps were omitted. These enzymes were expressed and purified according to the protocol of Zhang et al. (31.Zhang Z. Hillas P.J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with a poly-histidine tag on each protein to facilitate purification. Protein size determination was performed using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Sephadex 200 FPLC column. The column was equilibrated in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, and 5% glycerol at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Approximately 0.5 mg of protein was injected on the column. Protein elution was monitored at a wavelength of 280 nm. Data was collected and processed using the Virtual Bench (National Instruments) software. Rates of hydroperoxide reduction were determined anaerobically in a coupled assay with AhpF, monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to NADH oxidation. The assays typically contained 2 mm hydroperoxide substrate in 100 mmKPi, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mmNADH, and 20 μm either AhpC or AhpD, and 10 μm AhpF. Background NADH oxidation due to AhpF was monitored, then the hydroperoxide substrate was added and the enzymatic rate was observed. For steady-state kinetic assays, the substrate concentration was varied, and data was fit to the equation:v = V max[S]/(K m + [S]). The rate of DTT oxidation catalyzed by AhpC or AhpD in the presence of the peroxide substrate was measured by monitoring the change in absorbance at 310 nm due to formation of the DTT disulfide (32.Iyer K.S. Klee W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 707-710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Cary 1E spectrophotometer was used to obtain this data. The buffer and the water used for the assays were Chelex-pretreated as recommended by the supplier. Typical conditions for the assays were: 100 mm KPi, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm DTT in a 1-ml quartz cuvette at 25 °C (maintained with a circulating water bath). The initial rate of DTT oxidation was obtained by calculating the slope over the first 11 s after addition and mixing of the peroxide. The initial rates were corrected for the background oxidation of DTT by the peroxides in the absence of the enzyme. A 50-μl solution containing an equimolar mixture (0.23 μmol) of cumene hydroperoxide and either AhpC or AhpD was equilibrated in KPi, pH 7.0, buffer for 120 min. The reaction was then quenched by addition of an equal volume (50 μl) of a solution of 6% acetic acid in acetonitrile. The protein that precipitated was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was injected onto a Hewlett-Packard 1090 HPLC system equipped with an Axxiom ODS (4.6 × 250 mm) reverse-phase HPLC column. The products were separated using 20% acetonitrile and 80% water at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The detector was set at 260 nm. Control reactions were performed in the same buffer (50 mm KPi, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol) but without the enzyme. Product peaks were identified by comparison with authentic standards under identical elution conditions. Hydroperoxides were generated using the Schenck reaction of singlet oxygen with unactivated olefins bearing allylic hydrogens (33.Prein M. Adam W. Agnew. Chem. Int. Ed. Eng. 1996; 35: 477-494Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar,34.Wasserman H.H. Ives J.L. Tetrahedron. 1980; 37: 1825-1852Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In general, a solution of the olefin (3 mmol) and the sensitizer tetraphenylporphine (14.8 mg, 10 mm) in 25 ml of CCl4 was irradiated with a Sylvania 750 W lamp at 0 °C. A slow stream of oxygen was bubbled through the stirred solution for 5–6 h. The solvent was then removed in vacuo, and the hydroperoxide products were purified by column chromatography followed by crystallization or distillation, as appropriate. The products were identified by comparison of their physical properties and spectra with those in the literature and/or by reduction to the corresponding alcohols with triphenylphosphine (not shown). The structures of the hydroperoxide products are shown in Fig.1. 5-Hydroperoxy-6-methyl-6-hepten-2-one (1) and 6-hydroperoxy-6-methyl-4-hepten-2-one (2) were obtained from the oxidation of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one in a 2:1 ratio, respectively, and in 96% yield: colorless oil, bp 68–71 (∼5 mm Hg),R f = 0.59 (silica gel, 1:10 ethyl acetate:hexane); IR (KBr) 3439 (-OOH) and 1678 cm−1 (C=O); 1H NMR (400 MHz): (1) 1.36 (s, 3H, CH3), 1.70 (m, 2H, CH2), 1.73 (s, 3H, CH3), 1.92 (m, 2H, CH2), 4.37 (d, 1H, 3 J HH= 11.1 Hz, CHOOH), 4.91 (s, 1H, =CH2), and 4.94 ppm (s, 1H, =CH2); (2) 1.24 (s, 3H, CH3), 1.33 (s, 3H, CH3), 2.22 (s, 3H, CH3), 3.28 (d, 2H,3 J HH = 6.5 Hz, CH2), 6.30 (d, 1H, 3 J HH = 16.0 Hz, CH), and 6.58 ppm (dd, 1H, 3 J HH= 16.0, and 3 J HH = 6.6 Hz, CH). Trans-pinocarveylhydroperoxide (3) was obtained in 89% yield by irradiation of α-pinene as described by Schencket al. (35.Schenck G.O. Eggert H. Denk W. Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1953; 584: 177-198Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and subsequently Capdeville and Maumy (36.Capdeville P. Maumy T.H.L.

(37.Beckwith A.L.J. Davies A.G. Davison I.G.E. Maccoll A. Mruzek M.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1989; II: 815-824Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It was obtained in 32% yield as a white solid (recrystallization from benzene) m.p. 157–158 °C (literature 152–153 °C (37.Beckwith A.L.J. Davies A.G. Davison I.G.E. Maccoll A. Mruzek M.H. J. Chem.

Trans-9-hydroperoxyoctadec-10-enoic acid (4) andtrans-10-hydroperoxyoctadec-8-enoic acid (5) were obtained in a ratio of 1:0.8, respectively, from oleic acid as reported by Porter and Wujek (39.Porter N.A. Wujek J.S. J. Org. Chem. 1987; 52: 5085-5089Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar): yellow oil obtained in 60% yield,R F = 0.33 (silica gel, ethyl acetate). An additional purification step was required for these compounds using C18 reverse phase HPLC, with a 30–78% acetonitrile gradient over 30 min with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 1H NMR (400 MHz): (4) 0.89 (m, 3H, CH3), 1.28 (broad peak, 18H), 1.63 (m, 2H, CH2), 2.08 (m, 2H, CH2), 2.35 (m, 2H, CH2), 4.27 (q, 1H, 3 J HH= 7.8 Hz, CHOOH), 5.36 (dd, 1H,3 J HH = 8.0 and3 J HH = 15.0 Hz, CH), and 5.76 ppm (dt, 1H, 3 J HH = 6.6 and3 J HH = 15.1 Hz, CH) (4 +5). 13C NMR: (4) δ = 179.9 (COOH), δ11 = 137.2, δ10 = 128.4, δ9 = 87.1; (5) δ = 179.5 (COOH), δ8 = 136.7, δ9 = 128.8, δ10 = 87.1. Both proteins were independently overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3), using a pET vector for AhpC and a pACYC vector for AhpD. Lower yields or proteolyzed proteins were obtained when a pET23a or pUC19 vector was used, or when efforts were made to express the protein in the DH5α or XL1-BLUE strains of E. coli. Large quantities of AhpD (>50%) were lost as insoluble inclusion bodies when isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced expression was performed above 25 °C. Expressions were therefore carried out at a lower temperature to minimize this problem, although some loss of protein still occurred. Attempts to refold the precipitated protein were unsuccessful. In contrast, AhpC was produced in high amounts, and no inclusion bodies were observed even when the protein was expressed at 37 °C. A single ion-exchange chromatographic protocol was sufficient to purify the two enzymes. Both proteins were judged to be >95% pure by denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). Due to the absence of a strong chromophore in either protein, enzyme concentrations were determined from the molar absorption coefficients using the method of Pace et al. (40.Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). For AhpC, the calculated ε (280) is 25,170 m−1cm−1, and for AhpD, the calculated ε (280) is 15,720m−1 cm−1. Size exclusion chromatography indicated that AhpC was primarily present as a higher-order oligomer (10–12 mer) (Fig.3). A minor peak at approximately 15 min in the AhpC chromatogram indicated that a small amount of the dimer was also present. This dimer could represent either modified protein that is unable to oligomerize or the fraction of the protein present as the dimer in a dimer-oligomer equilibrium. A dimeric rather than oligomeric species was observed for AhpD"

Previous studies have proposed that the N-terminal region of IGFBP-5 contains a hydrophobic patch between residues 49 and 74 that is required for high affinity binding. These studies were undertaken to determine if mutagenesis of several of these residues resulted in a reduction of the affinity of IGFBP-3 and -5 for IGF-I. Substitutions for residues 68, 69, 70, 73, and 74 in IGFBP-5 (changing one charged residue, Lys68, to a neutral one and the four hydrophobic residues to nonhydrophobic residues) resulted in an ∼1000-fold reduction in the affinity of IGFBP-5 for IGF-I. Substitutions for homologous residues in IGFBP-3 also resulted in a >1000-fold reduction in affinity. The physiologic consequence of this reduction was that IGFBP-3 and -5 became very weak inhibitors of IGF-I-stimulated cell migration and DNA synthesis. Likewise, the ability of IGFBP-5 to inhibit IGF-I-stimulated receptor phosphorylation was attenuated. These changes did not appear to be because of alterations in protein folding induced by mutagenesis, because the IGFBP-5 mutant was fully susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by a specific IGFBP-5 protease. In summary, residues 68, 69, 70, 73, and 74 in IGFBP-5 appear to be critical for high affinity binding to IGF-I. Homologous residues in IGFBP-3 are also required, suggesting that they form a similar binding pocket and that for both proteins these residues form an important component of the core binding site. The availability of these mutants will make it possible to determine if there are direct, non-IGF-I-dependent effects of IGFBP-3 and -5 on cellular physiologic processes in cell types that secrete IGF-I.

Baxter R.C. Rosenfeld R.G. Roberts C.T. The IGF-I System Molecular Biology, Physiology, and Clinical Applications. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 227-257Google Scholar). Therefore, IGFBPs are capable of regulating the equilibrium distribution of IGF-I and -II between that bound to the receptor and that bound to the binding proteins in solution or in extracellular matrix and on cell surfaces (2.McCusker R.H.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Because IGFBPs generally exist in a molar excess over IGF-I in extracellular fluids, they potentially control the amount of receptor stimulation that occurs under equilibrium conditions (4.McCusker R.H. Campion D.R. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2071-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Several investigators have been interested in the domains of the IGFBPs that mediate IGF-I and -II binding. In general, this has been analyzed by determining the affinities of various IGFBP fragments (5.Spencer E.M. Chan K. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 1995: 209-214Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Both N- and C-terminal fragments of IGFBP-3 and -5 have been shown to have detectable binding affinity for IGF-I and -II, although generally their affinities are reduced between 100- and 1000-fold compared with the native proteins (5.Spencer E.M.

Affinities of the IGFBPs can also be modified by post-translational modifications other than proteolysis, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, but in general these studies have not led to hypotheses regarding the location of the IGF-I binding site (11.Conover C.A.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In addition, three-dimensional structural analysis of IGF-I and -II has enabled investigators to make predictions about the regions of IGFBPs that are likely to interact with hydrophobic and charged regions within the IGFs themselves (13.Hobba G.D.

The highest conservation is found in the N terminus of the protein (i.e. the first 80 amino acids) in the C-terminal region. Twelve conserved cysteines are found in the N-terminal domain and six in the C-terminal domain. The central regions are much less well conserved and do not contain cysteines, with the exception of IGFBP-4. It has been proposed, based on fragment analysis, that the high affinity binding site for IGFs is located in the N-terminal domain, although studies with IGFBP-2 and -3 have suggested that C-terminal domain binding components are also present (5.Spencer E.M. Chan K. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 1995: 209-214Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20.Wang J.F. Hampton B. Melman T. Burgess W.H. Rechler M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These investigators further determined that a hydrophobic patch (residues 49, 50, 69, 73, and 74) and a critical charged residue, lysine 68, existed within this motif that probably accounted for the binding of this fragment. Because the study by Kaluset al. (6.Kalus W. Zweckstetter M. Renner C. Sanchez Y. Georgescu J. Grol M. Demuth D. Schmacher R. Dony C. Lang K. Holak T.A.

We further tested the importance of these specific residues and the applicability of the model by making homologous substitutions in IGFBP-3. Recombinant human IGF-I was a gift from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Des 1–3 IGF-I was a gift from Monsanto, Inc. (St. Louis, MO).

The antisera that had been prepared using human IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 have been described previously (22.Camacho-Hubner C. Busby W.H. McCusker R.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antiphosphotyrosine antibody (PY99) and an antibody against the β subunit of the IGF-I receptor (C-20) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Co. (Santa Cruz, CA). The preparation of expression vector pRcRSV-IGFBP-5 that contains a full-length human IGFBP-5 cDNA has been described previously (23.Arai T. Clarke J.B. Parker A. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6099-6106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mutant IGFBP-5 cDNA was prepared in pRcRSV-IGFBP-5 as described previously (23.Arai T. Clarke J.B. Parker A. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6099-6106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Single-stranded phagemid-DNA was generated from pRcRSV-IGFBP-5, and mutations were introduced using synthetic oligonucleotides as substrates for antisense DNA synthesis. The following complementary oligonucleotide was used to mutate Lys68, Pro69, Leu70, Leu73, and Leu74 to Asn, Gln, Gln, Gln, and Gln: ccc gcg gcc gtg ctg ctg ggc gtg ctg ctg att ctc ctc gtc ctg. A human IGFBP-3 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA 3.1 vector (pcDNA3-IGFBP-3) from pNUT-IGFBP-3 that contained a full-length human IGFBP-3 cDNA (22.Camacho-Hubner C. Busby W.H. McCusker R.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arg69, Pro70, Leu71, Leu74, and Leu75 of IGFBP-3 were mutated to Ser, Ala, Ser, Gln, and Gly using oligonucleotides that contained the desired substitutions and restriction enzyme cleavage sites as primers for PCR. The 5′-half of the IGFBP-3 sequence that included the start codon of IGFBP-3 to nucleotide 338 was amplified using a 5′-primer that had the wild type sequence and a 3′-primer that had the substituted sequence and an EcoRV site (primer A). The 3′-prime portion of the IGFBP-3 sequence that spans nucleotide 286 to the 3′-end of IGFBP-3 was amplified using a 5′-primer that contained the mutated sequence and a Msc site and a 3′-primer that contained the wild type sequence (primer B). PCR was performed using pcDNA3.1-IGFBP-3 as a template using an Advantage PCR kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The PCR products were then purified by adding 5 μl of Strataclean resin followed by centrifugation. The supernatant was digested with EcoRV (5′-fragment) or Msc (3′-fragment) for 3 h at 37 °C. The digests were run on 2% agarose gel (NuSieve), and the bands that corresponded to the expected molecular weights were excised, frozen, and thawed. The material that was recovered from the thawed gel was combined (5′-fragment and 3′-fragments) and ligated using T4 DNA ligase and then incubating at room temperature overnight. The ligation mixture was then amplified by PCR using 5′-primer A and 3′-primer B to create the full-length IGFBP-3 with the mutated sequences. This PCR product was cloned into pcDNA 3.1 using a TOPO TA cloning kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. After selection, the plasmids thus created were sequenced, and those containing the correct sequences were amplified and purified as described previously (24.Imai Y. Busby W.H. Smith C.E. Clarke J.B. Garmong A.J. Horvitz G.D. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2596-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (K1) cells were transfected with pRcRSV that contained cDNA from either native or mutant IGFBP-5, pNUT-IGFBP-3 (22.Camacho-Hubner C. Busby W.H. McCusker R.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the pcDNA3.1 mutant IGFBP-3 using poly-l-ornithine (25.Dong Y. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2000-2007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Positive clones were selected with 800 μg/ml G418 as described previously (23.Arai T. Clarke J.B. Parker A. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6099-6106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The native forms of recombinant IGFBPs were purified from the conditioned medium of the transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells as described previously (3.Jones J.I. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar,22.Camacho-Hubner C. Busby W.H. McCusker R.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant form of IGFBP-5 was purified by phenyl-Sepharose and IGF-I affinity chromatography (to remove IGFBP-4) as described previously (22.Camacho-Hubner C. Busby W.H. McCusker R.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The material that was excluded from the column was equilibrated with 50 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.0, applied to an heparin-Sepharose affinity column and eluted in the same buffer containing 1.0 m NaCl. This fraction was purified to homogeneity by reverse phase HPLC as described previously (26.Chernausek S.D. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Busby W.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11377-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The IGFBP-3 mutant was purified by phenyl-Sepharose as described (22.Camacho-Hubner C. Busby W.H. McCusker R.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), then equilibrated with 50 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, applied to a heparin-Sepharose column, and eluted in the same buffer containing 1.0m NaCl. The eluate was further purified by lectin affinity chromatography using wheat germ agglutinin. The active fractions were eluted using 0.5 m N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and purified further by HPLC (26.Chernausek S.D. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Busby W.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11377-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Purification was monitored by immunoblotting using specific, high affinity IGFBP-3 and -5 antisera. Purity was proven by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with silver staining, and the amount of each protein was determined. The affinity of native and mutant IGFBPs for 125I-IGF-I was determined as described previously (19.Clemmons D.R. Dehoff M.L. Busby W.H. Bayne M.L. Cascieri M.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 890-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 20,000 cpm of125I-IGF-I was incubated with 0–100 ng of native or mutant IGFBPs in 0.25 ml of 0.1 m HEPES, 44 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA, 0.2% sodium azide, pH 6.0, for 1 h at room temperature. Bound and free IGF-I were separated by precipitation using 12% polyethylene glycol (Mr 8000–12,000). Scatchard analysis was also performed. Duplicate tubes were incubated with increasing concentrations of IGF-I (0.053–1.33 m), and bound and free IGF-I were separated by precipitation using 12% polyethylene glycol (Mr 8000–12,000) as described previously (27.Twigg S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6074-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The data were then analyzed according to the method of Scatchard, and the results that were obtained with native IGFBP-3 or -5 were compared with those obtained using the mutants. Ten or forty nanograms of IGFBPs were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer in the absence of a reducing agent and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The samples were then separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described previously (24.Imai Y. Busby W.H. Smith C.E. Clarke J.B. Garmong A.J. Horvitz G.D. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2596-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked with 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml sodium azide, pH 7.4, plus 3% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min and then washed with this buffer containing 1% BSA for 2 h, followed by this buffer plus 0.1% Tween 20 for 10 min at 4 °C. The membrane was then incubated with 100,000 cpm/ml 125I-IGF-I in this buffer (total volume 4 cc) containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 for 20 h at 4 °C. The membrane was then washed three times with this buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and three times with this buffer alone for 15 min, each with gentle agitation at 4 °C. The membrane was dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak XAR) to visualize the binding of125I-IGF-I. The same membranes were rehydrated with methanol and probed with antisera against human IGFBP-3 or human IGFBP-5, as described below. Serum-free conditioned medium was obtained from human dermal fibroblasts (GM10 cells). These cells have been shown to secrete an IGFBP-5-specific protease (28.Nam T.J. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Native or mutant IGFBP-5, 150 ng, was incubated with 50 μl of conditioned medium in 60 mmTris and 4 mm CaCl2 with or without 200 ng of IGF-I in a total volume of 60 μl overnight at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was then analyzed by immunoblotting as described below. The samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (8% for analysis of IGF-I receptor and 12.5% for analysis of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, as described previously (24.Imai Y. Busby W.H. Smith C.E. Clarke J.B. Garmong A.J. Horvitz G.D. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2596-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For IGF-I receptor analysis, the membrane was probed with a 1:1000 dilution for PY99 or a 1:1000 dilution for C-20 and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence, as described previously (29.Imai Y. Philippe N. Sesti G. Accili D. Taylor S.I. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 4201-4207Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 and -5 were visualized by an alkaline phosphatase method using a 1:1000 dilution of IGFBP-3 antibody or a 1:1000 dilution of IGFBP-5 antibody, as described previously (24.Imai Y. Busby W.H. Smith C.E. Clarke J.B. Garmong A.J. Horvitz G.D. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2596-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The results were quantified by scanning densitometry (Hoeffer Scientific, San Francisco, CA). The signal intensities were analyzed using N.I.H. Image. To determine the effect of IGFBP-3 and -5 and the mutants on [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, increasing concentrations of mutant and wild type IGFBP-3 (25–700 ng/ml) or IGFBP-5 (250–7000 ng/ml) were added in the presence of 10 ng/ml of IGF-I. Quiescent, porcine aortic smooth muscle cells (pSMC) were isolated as described previously (23.Arai T. Clarke J.B. Parker A. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6099-6106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30.Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2462-2467Google Scholar). They were plated in 96-well plates at 5000 cells/cm2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 5 days the media were aspirated, and 0.2 ml of fresh media containing 0.2% human platelet-poor plasma and test concentrations of IGFBP-3 or -5 plus IGF-I and 0.5 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine (specific activity 33 Ci/mmol) was added. After 36 h, the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated into DNA was determined after extracting the DNA as described previously (24.Imai Y. Busby W.H. Smith C.E. Clarke J.B. Garmong A.J. Horvitz G.D. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2596-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). pSMC monolayers were grown to confluency in 6-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Confluent monolayers were wounded with a single-edged razor blade as described previously (30.Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2462-2467Google Scholar). Test concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and -5 and their mutants were added in DMEM containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum. After 72 h, the number of cells migrating across the line of wounding were counted, as described previously (30.Jones J.I. Prevette T. Gockerman A. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2462-2467Google Scholar). Cells were fixed and stained with methylene blue prior to counting. The results are expressed as percent increase above a control containing 0.2% serum only. pSMC were grown to near confluency on 60-mm plates. The cultures were washed three times with serum-free DMEM and incubated with DMEM plus 0.01% BSA for 24 h. The medium was changed to DMEM with 0.01% BSA alone or this medium containing 1 μg/ml of each form of IGFBP. After 20 min at 37 °C, either vehicle or 100 ng/ml IGF-I was added for 10 min. The medium was removed, and the cultures placed on ice and then solubilized in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.3 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was incubated with a 1:250 dilution of C-20 antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated by incubating with protein-A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h, and then the immobilized protein A was sedimented by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 1 min and washed four times with the cell lysis buffer. The proteins were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer with 0.1m dithiothreitol. The immune complexes thus obtained were analyzed by immunoblotting. Because the prior NMR study predicted that hydrophobic residues between Val49 and Leu75 of IGFBP-5 formed the core of the IGF binding site, five of the eight residues in that region that had been predicted to form the binding pocket (i.e. Lys68, Pro69, Leu70, Leu73, and Leu74) were mutated to Asn, Gln, Gln, Gln, and Gln, respectively (13.Hobba G.D. Forbes B.E. Parkinson E.J. Francis G.L. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30529-30536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis, using the purified protein, showed that mutant IGFBP-5 had aK d of ∼1000 nm, whereas native IGFBP-5 had a K d of 0.56 nm. A mutant form of IGFBP-3 that had substitutions for homologous residues was created by changing Arg69, Pro70, Leu71, Leu74, and Leu75 to Ser, Ala, Ser, Gln, and Gly, respectively. Native IGFBP-3 had a K d of 0.69 nm, whereas the mutant had a K d of 930 nm. Thus, for both mutants the affinity for IGF-I was reduced >1000-fold. When the ability of increasing concentrations of mutant IGFBP-3 to bind 125I-IGF-I was studied, a significant increase in binding was not detected until 400 ng/ml was added. In contrast, a significant increase in 125I-IGF-I binding was noted at 1.0 ng/ml when native IGFBP-3 was used (Fig.1 A). Similar results were obtained for mutant and wild type IGFBP-5, and concentrations of either mutant below 100 ng showed no significant increase in binding compared with controls that contained no IGFBP-5 (Fig. 1 B). The inability of both of the mutants to bind to 125I-IGF-I was confirmed by Western ligand blotting. Neither 10 ng nor 40 ng of mutant IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 showed detectable binding. In contrast, both wild type proteins were easily visualized (Fig.2 A). When the same membrane was probed with antiserum against IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5, it was shown that comparable amounts of native and mutant IGFBPs were adherent to the membrane (Fig. 2 B). Native IGFBP-5 is cleaved by a serine protease that is released by cultured human fibroblasts (26.Chernausek S.D. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Busby W.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11377-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that incubation of IGF-I with IGFBP-5 partially protects it from degradation by this protease (20.Wang J.F. Hampton B. Melman T. Burgess W.H. Rechler M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26.Chernausek S.D. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Busby W.H. Wright G. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11377-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because mutant IGFBP-5 is unable to bind IGF-I, we determined whether it was protected from proteolysis when incubated with the IGFBP-5-specific protease in the presence of IGF-I. After an overnight incubation, native IGFBP-5 was degraded and yielded a predominant 22-kDa fragment (Fig.3, lane 1). Inclusion of 100 ng of IGF-I with native IGFBP-5 decreased proteolysis (Fig. 3,lane 2). When the experiment was repeated three times, scanning densitometry showed that the intensities of the intact native IGFBP-5 band was reduced by 55 ± 7% and in the presence of IGF-I by 24 ± 13% (p < 0.05). In contrast, the mutant IGFBP-5 band intensity was reduced by 48 ± 8% without IGF-I and by 57 ± 11% with IGF-I (p, N.S.) (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). Therefore, binding of IGF-I to IGFBP-5 appears to be necessary for IGF-I to protect IGFBP-5 from proteolysis by this protease. The addition of intact IGFBP-5 to the culture medium has been shown to inhibit IGF-I-stimulated phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor (6.Kalus W. Zweckstetter M. Renner C. Sanchez Y. Georgescu J. Grol M. Demuth D. Schmacher R. Dony C. Lang K. Holak T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6558-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24.Imai Y. Busby W.H. Smith C.E. Clarke J.B. Garmong A.J. Horvitz G.D. Rees C. Clemmons D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2596-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether the mutant IGFBP-5 had any effect on IGF-I receptor phosphorylation. Incubation of pSMC with 100 ng/ml IGF-I resulted in the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor (Fig. 4). The addition of 1 μg/ml native IGFBP-5 to the IGF-I-stimulated cultures prevented phosphorylation of IGF-I receptor completely. On the other hand, the same amount of the mutant IGFBP-5 did not alter the IGF-I receptor phosphorylation stimulation by IGF-I. The stimulation of phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor by des-1–3-IGF-I that binds IGFBP-5 with very low affinity was not affected significantly by the presence of native IGFBP-5 nor the mutant IGFBP-5 (data not shown). The incubation of cells with either native or mutant IGFBP-5 in the absence of IGF-I did not stimulate phosphorylation of IGF-I receptors (data not shown). IGF-I is a potent simulator of cell migration (24.Imai Y. Busby W.H. Smith C.E. Clark"

In retroviruses the major protein of the nucleocore is the nucleocapsid protein (NC protein), which derives from the C-terminal region of GAG. Retroviral NC proteins are formed of either one or two CCHC zinc finger(s) flanked by basic residues and have nucleic acid chaperone and match-maker properties essential for virus replication. Interestingly, the GAG protein of a number of retroelements including Spumaviruses does not possess the hallmarks of retroviral GAGs and in particular lacks a canonical NC protein. In an attempt to search for a nucleic acid chaperone activity in this class of retroelements we used the yeast Ty1 retrotransposon as a model system. Results shows that the C-terminal region of Ty1 GAG contains a nucleic acid chaperone domain capable of promoting the annealing of primer tRNAiMet to the multipartite primer binding site, Ty1 RNA dimerization and initiation of reverse transcription. Moreover Ty1 RNA dimerization, in a manner similar to Ty3 but unlike retroviral RNAs, appears to be mediated by tRNAiMet. These findings suggest that nucleic acid chaperone proteins probably are general co-factors for reverse transcriptases.

Despite their tremendous diversity and dispersity among living organisms, their replicative cycle shares several similarities. They all encode a reverse transcriptase (RT) that converts the genomic RNA into a double-stranded DNA subsequently integrated into the cellular genome by integrase or endonuclease (1.Boeke J.D. Stoye J.P. Cofin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 343-435Google Scholar). Retroelements efficiently spread within eukaryotic organisms and have a major evolutive impact on the genomes that they inhabit. As repeated sequences they represent a high potential for homologous recombination of the host genome and as elements with transcriptional activity, their integration triggers both insertional mutagenesis and deregulation of gene expression (2.Kazazian Jr., H.H.

Interestingly, the TYA1 protein appears to be functionally homologous to the retroviral GAG polyproteins, although it does not have the canonical hallmarks. In fact TYA1 protein has no zinc finger motif, no major homology region, and is not processed into matrix, capsid, and NC by the protease (28.Merkulov G.V. Swiderek K.M. Brachmann C.B. Boeke J.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5548-5556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several LTR retrotransposons such as Gypsy, ZAM, 17.6, 297, tom, 412 (Drosophila melanogaster), TED (Autographa californica), or Ta1 (Arabidopsis thaliana), and the members of spumavirus family share these properties in common with Ty1 (29.Sandmeyer S.B. Menees T.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 214: 261-296PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Yu S.F. Edelmann K. Strong R.K. Moebes A. Rethwilm A. Linial M.L. J.

Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8718-8724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In view of the ubiquitous nature of the nucleic acid chaperone and match-maker activities of the NC protein of retroviruses and of a number of LTR retrotransposon, such as Ty3 (33.Gabus C. Ficheux D. Rau M. Keith G. Sandmeyer S. Darlix J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4873-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), or retroposon, such as I-Factor (34.Dawson A. Hartswood E. Paterson T. Finnegan D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4448-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we have studied Ty1 as a model system to look for a nucleic acid chaperone in this class of noncanonical GAG proteins. In the present report we show that a domain derived from the TYA1 protein exhibits a nucleic acid chaperone activity promoting primer tRNAiMet annealing to the multipartite primer binding site (PBS) and dimerization of Ty1 RNA in vitro.DISCUSSIONTy1, a yeast LTR retrotransposon distantly related to oncoretroviruses and lentiviruses, encodes a major protein TYA1, considered to be equivalent to retroviral GAG, although it lacks most of the hallmarks of GAG. We have investigated the nucleic acid binding properties of the p54 TYA1 protein and mapped the nucleic acid-binding domain within the C-terminal region of p54 TYA1 (Fig. 1). In an attempt to extensively characterize the properties of this domain, it was synthesized in vitro as a highly pure 103-amino acid peptide, designated TYA1-D. This TYA1-D peptide binds both RNA and DNA in vitro and forms high molecular weight nucleoprotein complexes (Fig. 2).Also the TYA1-D peptide was found to promote the annealing of complementary DNA oligonucleotides in a manner very similar to NCp9 of the yeast retrotransposon Ty3 and of retroviral NC proteins (Fig. 3), raising the possibility that the TYA1-D peptide has nucleic acid chaperone and match-maker activities similar to previously characterized NC zinc finger proteins (10.Darlix J.L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 33.Gabus C. Ficheux D. Rau M. Keith G. Sandmeyer S. Darlix J.L.

Using an in vitro reconstituted Ty1 replication system, the TYA1-D peptide was able to direct the hybridization of primer tRNAiMet to the multipartite PBS of Ty1 RNA, allowing elongation of tRNAiMet by RT (Figs. 4 and 7). Furthermore due to its nucleic acid chaperone and match-maker activities, the TYA1-D domain is expected to direct the DNA strand transfers during Ty1 reverse transcription as shown for retroviral NC proteins (16.Darlix J.L.

Both the TYA1-D peptide and Ty3 NCp9 appeared to be efficient in primer annealing to the PBS and in the formation of Ty1 RNA:tRNAiMet dimers, while HIV-1 NCp7 was poorly active and MLV NCp10 inactive. The common use of replication primer tRNAiMet in Ty1 and Ty3 (45.Chapman K.B. Bystrom A.S. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3236-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 49.Keeney J.B. Chapman K.B. Lauermann V. Voytas D.F. Astrom S.U. von Pawel-Rammingen U. Bystrom A. Boeke J.D. Mol. Cell.

Sandmeyer S. Darlix J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4873-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 44.Friant S. Heyman T. Bystrom A.S. Wilhelm M. Wilhelm F.X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) might explain the differences seen between Ty1 TYA1-D peptide and Ty3 NCp9, and the retroviral NC proteins. In agreement with this, HIV-1 primer tRNALys3 probably also interacts with genomic sequences flanking the PBS (50.Wakefield J.K. Kang S.M. Morrow C.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 966-975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but to a lesser extent than in Ty1 and Ty3. The nucleic acid binding and chaperoning activities of the TYA1-D peptide suggest that the C-terminal domain of p54TYA1 probably is a major factor driving genomic RNA and tRNAiMet packaging required for the formation of functional Ty1 VLPs. In agreement with this notion, binding of tRNAiMet to the multipartite PBS appears to mediate its recruitment into VLPs (51.Wilhelm M. Wilhelm F.X. Keith G. Agoutin B. Heyman T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4560-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Biochemical data presented in Fig. 4 are the first direct evidences indicating that Ty1 RNA can exist in a dimer form. According to genetic data (52.Wilhelm M. Boutabout M. Heyman T. Wilhelm F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) intermolecular DNA strand transfers take place in the course of Ty1 replication in agreement with Ty1 RNA dimers. The observation that Ty1 RNA dimerization only occurs in presence of tRNAiMet leads us to propose a model where two genomic RNAs are linked via two tRNAiMet molecules (see Fig.8). Dimerization of tRNAiMet would be mediated by 5′-5′ interactions involving a 12-nucleotide palindrome (position 2–13, GCGCCGUGGCGC, see Fig. 6 C). In support of this dimerization model, mutations in the 5′-tRNA palindrome impaired dimerization (Fig.6 D). Interestingly, Chapman et al. (45.Chapman K.B. Bystrom A.S. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3236-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) found that these tRNA mutations (cf. Fig. 6 C) inhibited retrotransposition, probably by interfering with tRNAiMet annealing to the PBS and reverse transcription. However, mutating the PBS to insert compensatory mutations did not restore a wild-type level of retrotransposition, but only 15% of it. In the light of our in vitro data, it is tempting to speculate that this might be due to the low level of Ty1 RNA:tRNA dimerization.In many aspects Ty1 is much different from other retrotransposons like Ty3 or retroviruses, for example in respect to the structure and maturation of its GAG precursor, called TYA1. In fact, Ty1 does not contain a retroviral (CX 2CX 4HX 4C) zinc finger motif, the major homology region, and is not processed into mature matrix, capsid, and NC proteins. The sole maturation event occurs by cleavage of p58 resulting in the release of p54. The cleavage product, a very acidic peptide of 40 amino acids, cannot be detected and is probably degraded (28.Merkulov G.V. Swiderek K.M. Brachmann C.B. Boeke J.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5548-5556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that the TYA1-D peptide will exhibit nucleic acid chaperone and match-maker activities in the context of the full-length p54 TYA1 protein. As already shown for other nucleic acid chaperone proteins like hnRNP C1/C2, the chaperone activity was found in both the full-length protein and in the RNA-binding domain alone (53.Portman D.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Furthermore in HIV-1, the nucleic acid chaperone activity was found in the mature NCp7, in the precursor NCp15 (13.Darlix J.L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.T. Clavel F. Barre-Sinoussi F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and in the Gag polyprotein (54.Feng Y.X. Campbell S. Harvin D. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Rein A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4251-4256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus p54 TYA1 might be a multidomain protein with several associated functions rather than a polyprotein-like in retroviruses. The mapping of a minimal nucleic acid chaperone domain in TYA1-D is under way. A number of retroelements such as Gypsy, ZAM, 17.6, 297, tom, 412, TED, or Ta1 and the Spumaviruses share these properties in common with Ty1, since they all possess a domain with stretches of basic amino acids with possible nucleic acid chaperone properties (29.Sandmeyer S.B. Menees T.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 214: 261-296PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Yu S.F. Edelmann K. Strong R.K. Moebes A. Rethwilm A. Linial M.L. J.

Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8718-8724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Due to the general property of single-stranded nucleic acids to fold into and to be kinetically trapped in several conformations (55.Herschlag D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20871-20874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), reverse transcriptases might be especially sensible to the existence of nonfunctional initiation complexes. Based on our datas and previous reports on retroviruses (10.Darlix J.L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), Ty3, another yeast very distant LTR retrotransposon (33.Gabus C. Ficheux D. Rau M. Keith G. Sandmeyer S. Darlix J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4873-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 38.Cristofari G. Gabus C. Ficheux D. Bona M. Le Grice S.F. Darlix J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36643-36648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and I factor, a long interspersed nuclear element-like element in Drosophila (34.Dawson A. Hartswood E. Paterson T. Finnegan D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4448-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we propose that RT activity, whatever the reverse transcription mechanism, should be associated with a nucleic acid chaperone protein that acts in setting up functional and specific initiation complexes. This would be achieved through two complementary mechanisms: first by annealing the primer to the template and second by inhibiting nonspecific priming events. In agreement with this notion, it has recently been reported (56.LaBranche H. Dupuis S. Ben-David Y. Bani M.R. Wellinger R.J. Chabot B. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) that hnRNP A1, a nucleic acid-binding protein known to exhibit a strong chaperoning activity (53.Portman D.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), probably interacts with telomeric repeats so as to stimulate telomere elongation by telomerase, distantly related to RTs (57.Nakamura T.M. Cech T.R. Cell. 1998; 92: 587-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thus functional interactions between RTs and a nucleic acid chaperone protein might be a general feature of genome maintenance in retroelements and their cellular hosts. Retroelements form a large family of mobile genetic elements, including retroviruses, retrotransposons (or LTR1 retrotransposon for long terminal repeats containing retrotransposon) and retroposons (or non-LTR retrotransposon). Despite their tremendous diversity and dispersity among living organisms, their replicative cycle shares several similarities. They all encode a reverse transcriptase (RT) that converts the genomic RNA into a double-stranded DNA subsequently integrated into the cellular genome by integrase or endonuclease (1.Boeke J.D. Stoye J.P. Cofin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 343-435Google Scholar). Retroelements efficiently spread within eukaryotic organisms and have a major evolutive impact on the genomes that they inhabit. As repeated sequences they represent a high potential for homologous recombination of the host genome and as elements with transcriptional activity, their integration triggers both insertional mutagenesis and deregulation of gene expression (2.Kazazian Jr., H.H. Moran J.V. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 3.Wessler S.R. Bureau T.E. White S.E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 814-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Furthermore by means of cellular RNAs recruitment and reverse transcription, retroelements have been involved in pseudogene formation and exon shuffling in plants and mammals (4.Flavell A.J. Pearce S.R. Kumar A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 838-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 5.Moran J.V. DeBerardinis R.J. Kazazian Jr., H.H.

The reverse transcription process for retroviruses and probably most LTR retrotransposons occurs in a nucleocore also called nucleocapsid. This nucleoprotein structure is composed of the RNA genome and the primer tRNA coated with nucleocapsid (NC) protein molecules and of the RT and integrase enzymes. The NC protein has one or two highly conserved CX 2CX 4HX 4C zinc finger(s) flanked by basic residues with key functions in particle formation and reverse transcription (10.Darlix J.L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The NC protein exerts major roles in the replication of retroviruses that can be attributed to its nucleic acid chaperone and match-maker activities (10.Darlix J.L.

More recently, an increasing number of bacteria has been shown to metabolize aromatic compounds under anoxic conditions. Benzoyl-CoA (Fig.1, compound 1) has been identified as a central intermediate in anoxic degradation of many aromatic substrates (for review see Refs. 1.Heider J. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 2.Heider J. Fuchs G. Anaerobe. 1997; 3: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 3.Harwood C.S. Gibson J. J.

Benzoyl-CoA reductase has been purified from the denitrifying bacteriumThauera aromatica (5.Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The 160-kDa protein consists of four different subunits specified by the bcrCBAD genes. The enzyme contains a minimum of two Fe-S clusters (5.Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 6.Boll M. Albracht S.J.P. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and is only active under strictly anoxic conditions (5.Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The reduction of benzoyl-CoA is coupled to the hydrolysis of two molecules of ATP/molecule of benzoyl-CoA. The natural electron donor for the enzyme-catalyzed reduction of benzoyl-CoA is a [8Fe-8S]-ferredoxin with a midpoint potential of −450 mV (versus a standard hydrogen electrode) (7.Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 946-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Alternatively, titanium(III) citrate, dithionite, or reduced methyl viologen can serve as artificial reductants. Some CoA-thioesters of fluoro-, amino-, and hydroxybenzoate can be reduced by benzoyl-CoA reductase albeit at low rates. Moreover, low molecular mass compounds such as hydroxylamine and azide are also reduced. All these reactions strictly depend on the hydrolysis of ATP (5.Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In analogy to the Birch reduction of aromatic compounds by metallic sodium in liquid ammonia, the enzyme-catalyzed reduction of benzoyl-CoA has been proposed to proceed by two one-electron transfer reactions, each of which is followed by a protonation step (8.Koch J. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9.Buckel W. Keese R. Angew. Chem. 1995; 107: 1595-1598Crossref Google Scholar). The crucial step is the first electron transfer to the aromatic ring yielding a radical anion. EPR studies indicated that the hydrolysis of ATP is responsible for conformational changes in the vicinity of [4Fe-4S] clusters, most probably resulting in a lowered reduction potential of the clusters (6.Boll M. Albracht S.J.P. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). [ring-13C6]Cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA was identified in a product mixture obtained after incubation of a crude extract preparation from T. aromatica containing [ring-13C6]benzoate, coenzyme A, ATP, Mg2+, and titanium(III) citrate (8.Koch J. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA (Fig. 1, compound2) was proposed tentatively to be the committed product of benzoyl-CoA reductase. Furthermore, an enzyme (Dch protein; subsequently designated as 1,5-dienoyl-CoA hydratase) catalyzing the formation of 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA (compound3) by addition of water to the cyclic 1,5-diene (compound 2) has been purified and characterized (10.Laempe D. Eisenreich W. Bacher A Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast to the results obtained with T. aromatica,cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1-carboxylate (Fig.2, compound 4) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene-1-carboxylate (compound 5) were reported as products of benzoic acid reduction in cell suspensions of the phototrophic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris. The structure assignments were based on gas chromatography and mass spectrometry after hydrolytic treatment of the reaction mixture (11.Gibson K.J. Gibson J. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 696-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was initiated to establish the product of benzoyl-CoA reductase from T. aromatica. For this purpose, benzoyl-CoA labeled with 13C or 14C was incubated with purified benzoyl-CoA reductase using various electron donors. Enyzme products were analyzed by HPLC1 and two-dimensional homonuclear and heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the effect of a thioester residue on the reduction potential of the aromatic moiety was determined by cyclic voltammetry usingS-ethyl-thiobenzoate as a model compound. Reagents were obtained from Aldrich, Fluka, Merck, Sigma, Roth, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Gerbu. Chromatography materials were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Bio-Rad, and Merck, respectively. [ring-13C6]Benzoic acid was purchased from MS Isotopes, and [ring-14C]benzoate was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. and Biotrend Chemikalien GmbH. T. aromatica strain K172 (DSM 6984) was isolated in our laboratory (12.Tschech A. Fuchs G. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 148: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 13.Anders H.-J. Kaetzke A. Kämpfer P. Ludwig W. Fuchs G. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1995; 45: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and has been deposited in Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen (Braunschweig, Germany).Clostridium pasteurianum (ATCC 6013) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. [ring-13C6]Benzoyl-CoA was obtained via esterification of benzoic acid withN-hydroxysuccinimide (14.Gross G.G. Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforschg. 1966; 21b: 683-690Google Scholar). [ring-14C]Benzoyl-CoA and cyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA were prepared enzymatically from [ring-14C]benzoate (specific radioactivity, 2.025 GBq mmol−1) and cyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylate, respectively, using coenzyme A and enriched benzoate-CoA ligase fromT. aromatica as described earlier (15.Ziegler K. Braun K. Böckler A. Fuchs G. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 149: 62-69Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). [ring-13C6]benzoyl-CoA and [ring-14C]benzoyl-CoA were mixed (600 kBq mg−1) and co-purified by semi-preparative HPLC as described (10.Laempe D. Eisenreich W. Bacher A Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The yield was 50–80%. Treatment of benzoic acid phenyl ester with sodium ethyl mercaptide affordedS-ethyl-thiobenzoate (16.Seifert A. J. Prakt. Chem. 1885; 31: 471-473Crossref Google Scholar). An aliquot (80 μl) of the reaction mixture was dissolved in 920 μl of toluene and purified by preparative thin layer chromatography using silica gel 60 plates (Merck, 2 mm, 20 × 20 cm) with toluene as solvent. A strip of the plate was sprayed with 0.01% fluorescein (m/v) in ethanol, and the bands were visualized under ultraviolet light (254 nm). The product band was extracted with toluene and dried under reduced pressure (1H NMR using CDCl3 as solvent: δ (ppm); 1.37 (3H, t, CH3), 3.10 (2H, q, CH2), 7.33–8.00 (5H, m, C6H5). T. aromatica was grown anoxically at 28 °C in a mineral salt medium containing a mixture of 4-hydroxybenzoate and nitrate (ratio 1:3.5) as sole source of carbon and energy (12.Tschech A. Fuchs G. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 148: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Hydroxybenzoate and nitrate were continuously fed at a molar ratio of 1:3.5. Cells were harvested by centrifugation under anaerobic conditions and were stored in liquid nitrogen. Cell extract was prepared as described (17.Brackmann R. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Benzoyl-CoA reductase was partially purified from T. aromatica (wet cell mass, 200 g) under strictly anaerobic conditions in a glove box containing an atmosphere of N2/H2 (95:5, v/v) as described earlier (5.Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Benzoyl-CoA reductase was further purified by chromatography on a column of Blue Sepharose CL 6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 4.2 × 12.5 cm) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The column was developed with three bed volumes of equilibration buffer and was then developed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm KCl (flow rate, 2 ml min−1). Fractions were assayed for benzoyl-CoA reductase (5.Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA hydratase activity (10.Laempe D. Eisenreich W. Bacher A Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Ferredoxin was purified fromT. aromatica (wet cell mass, 200 g) as described earlier (7.Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 946-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The yield was 60 mg of pure protein. Benzoyl-CoA reductase was assayed spectrophotometrically using reduced methyl viologen as electron donor (5.Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) or by HPLC as described earlier (6.Boll M. Albracht S.J.P. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture for HPLC analysis contained 150 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.3, 10 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm[ring-14C]benzoyl-CoA, 80 nkat of pyruvate kinase, and purified benzoyl-CoA reductase from T. aromatica(0.1–0.2 unit) in a total volume of 1 ml. Titanium(III) citrate or sodium dithionite were added to a final concentration of 5 mm. Assays using reduced ferredoxin (37 μm) from T. aromatica as reductant were performed under an atmosphere of 100% hydrogen. Reduction of T. aromaticaferredoxin was catalyzed by a ferredoxin-free crude preparation of hydrogenase from C. pasteurianum (1.5 units mg−1) that had been prepared as described previously (7.Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 946-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). When ferredoxin was used, other reductants were omitted. Unless otherwise stated, the reaction was started by adding 50 μl of a purified benzoyl-CoA reductase solution. The enzymatic hydration of cyclohex-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA and the reverse reaction, dehydration of 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA, were determined by a continuous spectrophotometric assay (λ = 310 nm) at 37 °C as described (10.Laempe D. Eisenreich W. Bacher A Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Additionally, dienoyl-CoA hydratase was determined by HPLC analysis of substrate consumption and product formation. The assay mixture for HPLC analysis contained 150 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.3, 0.1 mm 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA, and approximately 0.1 unit of dienoyl-CoA hydratase in a volume of 0.25 ml. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C. After 10 min, equilibrium was reached, and approximately one-half of 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl CoA was converted into the cyclic 1,5-diene. Subsequently, sodium dithionite, sodium sulfite, or a mixture of sodium sulfite and titanium(III) citrate were added to a final concentration of 1 mm each. Aliquots were retrieved at intervals and applied to a Lichrosphere 100 RP C-18 HPLC column (Merck; bed volume, 1 ml; flow rate, 1 ml min−1) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.7, containing 10% acetonitrile (v/v). The column was developed with the equilibration buffer. The effluent was monitored by scintillation counting (Ramona, Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) or photometrically at 260 nm. Retention volumes were 11.1 ml for benzoyl-CoA, 13.9 ml for cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl CoA, 4.4 ml for 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl CoA, 2.5 ml for 6-hydroxycyclohex-2-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA, and 16.5 ml for cyclohex-2-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA. The assignment of the HPLC peaks to individual CoA-thioesters was performed by NMR analysis of13C-labeled compounds (see below). Reaction mixtures (5 ml) contained 150 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.3, 10 mmMgCl2, 7.5 mm ATP, 10 mmphosphoenol pyruvate, and 400 nkat pyruvate kinase, and 10 mm titanium(III) citrate or 10 mm sodium dithionite. The reaction was started by the addition of a mixture of [ring-14C]benzoyl-CoA (44.4 kBq) and 5 mg of [ring-13C6]benzoyl-CoA. The mixtures were incubated under anoxic conditions at 37 °C for 20–40 min. The reaction was stopped by stirring for 15 min at 0 °C under an aerobic atmosphere. The solution was lyophilized, and the powder was dissolved in 1 ml of 20 mm ammonium formate, pH 5. The solution was applied to a Lichrosorb RP-C18 column (25 × 2 cm; Merck; flow rate, 8 ml min−1), which had been equilibrated with 20 mm ammonium formate, pH 5. After washing the column with two bed volumes of 10% methanol (v/v) in the same buffer, the CoA thioesters were eluted with 98% methanol (v/v) in the same buffer. Methanol was evaporated under reduced pressure at 30 °C, and the residue was lyophilized. Product recovery was determined by liquid scintillation counting and was 60–80% of the initial amount of14C added to the assay. When reduced ferredoxin was used as reductant, the reaction was performed in a 100-ml stoppered bottle containing 9.6 ml of the standard assay mixture. The bottle was flushed with hydrogen for 20 min under continuous stirring. A ferredoxin-free hydrogenase preparation (H2 reduction activity: 5–6 μmol/min) from C. pasteurianum (7.Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 946-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), [ring-13C6]benzoyl-CoA (7 mg), 85 kBq [ring-14C]benzoyl-CoA, and 3.5 mg ferredoxin from T. aromatica (final concentration, 37.5 μm) were added. The mixture was flushed with hydrogen for 20 min under continuous stirring. The assay was started by the addition of benzoyl-CoA reductase (0.8 unit) and was terminated after 15 min by adding 250 μl of 1% formic acid (final pH, 3–4). The mixture was then lyophilized. The lyophilized samples were dissolved in D2O at pH 6 (uncorrected glass electrode reading).1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured at 17 °C using a four-channel Bruker DRX500 spectrometer equipped with pulsed field gradient accessory, a lock switch unit, and an ASPECT station. One-dimensional and two-dimensional HMQC, HMQC-TOCSY, and INADEQUATE experiments were performed as described earlier (8.Koch J. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The duration of the 1H spin-lock was 60 ms in the HMQC-TOCSY experiment. The midpoint potential ofS-ethyl-thiobenzoate was determined at 25 °C by cyclic voltammetry. All measurements were carried out in super-dry acetonitrile with tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate as supporting electrolyte. A three-electrode cell compartment was used throughout. For the electrochemical measurements, a potentiostat model 173 and a programmer model 175 (EG&G, Burlington, Vermont) were used. All potentials were calibrated against a ferrocene/ferrocenium couple. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were performed as described by Schägger and von Jagow (18.Schägger J. van Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (19.Zehr B.D. Savin T.J. Hall R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 157-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the methods of Bradford (20.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) or Lowry et al. (21.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Benzoyl-CoA reductase was purified from T. aromatica as described earlier (5.Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The enzyme was enriched 40-fold by four chromatographic steps with a yield of 25% to a specific activity of 0.48 μmol min−1 mg−1 (measured with reduced methyl viologen as electron donor (5.Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar)) and >95% purity as estimated by SDS gel electrophoresis. This protein fraction contained benzoyl-CoA reductase (7 μmol min−1) and cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA hydratase (86 μmol min−1) activity. Further purification of benzoyl-CoA reductase was achieved by affinity chromatography on Cibachron Blue (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The effluent of the column contained benzoyl-CoA reductase activity (4.5 μmol min−1) and 7% of the initial hydratase activity (6.0 μmol min−1). Using buffer containing 0.5 m KCl, 70% of the initial dienoyl-CoA hydratase activity could be eluted from the column. A mixture of benzoyl-CoA reductase (7 μmol min−1) and 1,5-dienoyl-CoA hydratase (86 μmol min−1) was incubated with [ring-14C]benzoyl-CoA in the presence of reduced ferredoxin or titanium(III) citrate. Reversed phase HPLC of the reaction mixture showed four peaks (1, 2, 3, and F) reflecting at least three radioactive products (Fig.3 A). The compound reflecting peak 3 was apparently more polar than benzoyl-CoA (peak 1, compound 1), product 2 was less polar than benzoyl-CoA, and product F had the same retention volume as free aromatic carboxylic acids and was probably formed by hydrolytic cleavage of the thioester. Subsequent experiments were performed with [ring-13C6]benzoyl-CoA as substrate in an attempt to optimize the sensitivity and selectivity of NMR detection. The reaction mixture was desalted and was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Carbon atoms derived from the13C-enriched phenyl ring of benzoyl-CoA substrate gave 12 intense 13C NMR signals (Fig.4) that were attributed to two products (compounds 2 and 3) by two-dimensional NMR experiments.

Open table in a new tab Each of the 12 13C signals described above was split into a double doublet or a pseudo-triplet by 13C13C coupling constants of 30–70 Hz. Apparently, each of the observed13C atoms was directly bonded to two adjacent13C atoms. This result suggests that both products retained the connectivity of the ring carbon atoms of the benzoyl substrate. Some of the signals showed additional fine splittings (coupling constants of 1–8 Hz; Table I) as a result of13C13C couplings via two or three bonds. Four of the six intense 13C NMR signals of compound2 had chemical shifts values (121.9, 131.6, 137.4, and 140.6 ppm; cf. Fig. 4 and Table I) consistent with sp2-hybridization of the corresponding carbon atoms. Two signals were detected at 27.7 and 22.8 ppm reflecting two sp3-hybridized carbon atoms. This 13C NMR signature in conjunction with the detected13C13C coupling pattern was consistent with a cyclic diene structure. Two-dimensional INADEQUATE, HMQC, and HMQC-TOCSY experiments (Table I and Fig. 5) afforded the entire network of carbon-carbon, carbon-proton, and proton-proton connectivities (28 detected homo- and heterocorrelations between 1H and13C of the carbocyclus). Specifically, HMQC spectroscopy revealed correlations of the 13C NMR signals at 121.9, 131.6, and 140.6 ppm to 1H NMR signals at 6.22, 6.02, and 6.97 ppm, respectively. The 13C signal at 137.4 ppm did not correlate to any 1H NMR signal in the HMQC experiment. This finding suggested a cyclohexadiene-1-carbonyl derivative. Carbon-carbon coupling constants (68.8 and 53.0 Hz) detected for the NMR signal at 137.4 ppm (C-1) as well as INADEQUATE spectroscopy showed that C-1 was adjacent to two sp2-hybridized carbon atoms with13C NMR signals at 140.6 ppm (C-2) and 121.9 ppm (C-6). The signal at 121.9 ppm (C-6) gave an additional carbon-carbon correlation to the signal at 131.6 ppm (C-5), indicating a cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl system. The presence of a CoA residue was revealed by the 1H NMR data (not shown), thus establishing compound 2 as cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA. The second product in the mixture (compound 3) was identified as 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA by the same approach, as described above for compound 2 (Table I). Compound 3 had been identified earlier as the reaction product of 1,5-dienoyl-CoA hydratase from T. aromatica (10.Laempe D. Eisenreich W. Bacher A Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA and cyclohexa-1,4-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA, which had been reported as products of benzoyl-CoA reduction catalyzed by benzoyl-CoA reductase in R. palustris (11.Gibson K.J. Gibson J. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 696-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were not found in our reaction mixtures. After prolonged incubation of [ring-13C6]benzoyl-CoA with benzoyl-CoA reductase, two minor products, [ring-13C6]cyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA (Fig. 6, compound 6) and [ring-13C6]2-hydroxycyclohexane-1-carbonyl-CoA (7), were identified by NMR (data not shown). The NMR data of these compounds have been described elsewhere (10.Laempe D. Eisenreich W. Bacher A Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We suggest tentatively that these compounds resulted from reduction of2 by benzoyl-CoA reductase and subsequent hydration catalyzed by cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA hydratase (Fig. 6). The formation of these compounds was not observed when benzoyl-CoA was still present in the assay mixture as shown in Fig. 3 (Aand B). As reported earlier, dithionite can also act as an artificial electron donor for benzoyl-CoA reductase with rates comparable with other artificial electron donors (5.Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, HPLC analysis of the products formed from incubation of [ring-14C]benzoyl-CoA with dithionite and a protein mixture containing benzoyl-CoA reductase and 1,5-dienoyl-CoA hydratase revealed a product pattern (Fig. 3 B) that was different from that obtained with titanium(III) citrate or reduced ferredoxin (Fig. 3 A). Peaks reflecting the cyclic 1,5-diene (compound 2) or the cyclic 6-hydroxy-1-monoene (compound3) were not observed with dithionite as artificial electron donor. On the other hand, two novel peaks reflecting compounds8 and 9 were detected (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, when dithionite (5 mm) was added to a benzoyl-CoA reductase assay that had been started with titanium(III) citrate as electron donor, the HPLC pattern shown in Fig. 3 A changed to that shown in Fig. 3 C. Compound 8 and compound 9 formed by enzymatic conversion of [ring-13C6]benzoyl-CoA were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy (Table I). The detected 13C NMR chemical shifts (120–140 ppm) and coupling signatures (double doublets or triplets) were consistent with cyclic hexamonoene motifs for both compounds. Notably, each of the 13C atoms correlated to directly bonded 1H atoms in the HMQC experiment, thus indicating that the C-1 positions of both compounds carried a hydrogen atom and were not involved in a double bond. INADEQUATE and HMQC-TOCSY experiments afforded the entire network of carbon-carbon and carbon-proton bonds establishing compound9 as [ring-13C6]cyclohex-2-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA and compound 8 as [ring-13C6]6-hydroxycyclohex-2-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA (Fig. 7). No cyclic diene was detected with dithionite as electron donor. To clarify the effects of electron donors on the product pattern, we analyzed the effect of sodium dithionite on a benzoyl-CoA reductase free preparation of 1,5-dienoyl-CoA hydratase by HPLC. Under equilibrium conditions, similar amounts of cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl CoA (peak 2) and 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA (peak 3) were present in assays of the hydratase (Fig.8 A). After addition of sodium dithionite, both compounds were converted into 6-hydroxycyclohex-2-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA (Fig. 8, B andC, peaks 8). Fig. 8 B shows that an additional intermediate apolar product (reflecting peak 10) is formed after 1 min of incubation. After 10 min of incubation this peak disappeared in the chromatogram (Fig. 8 C). It is conceivable that peak 10 represents cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1-carbonyl CoA (Fig. 7,compound 10), which can be converted rapidly into compound 8 by the addition of water. When sodium dithionite was replaced by 1 mm sodium sulfite, the formation of compound 8 could not be detected, whereas a mixture containing 1 mm sodium sulfite and 1 mmtitanium(III) citrate had the same effect as sodium dithionite (not shown). In the absence of 1,5-dienoyl-CoA hydratase, no spontaneous reaction of dithionite with 2 and 3 could be observed. For the energetics of benzoyl-CoA reduction, the transfer of the first electron to the aromatic ring of benzoyl-CoA yielding a radical anion is considered as the crucial step in the reaction catalyzed by benzoyl-CoA reductase (9.Buckel W. Keese R. Angew. Chem. 1995; 107: 1595-1598Crossref Google Scholar). A highly negative redox potential is expected for this reaction. The natural substrate benzoyl-CoA is not suitable for the direct determination of this potential because irreversible follow-up reactions occur in protic solvents. Therefore, the substrate analog S-ethyl-thiobenzoate, which is soluble in aprotic solvents, was synthesized and analyzed by cyclic voltammetry. The thioester was reduced at a midpoint potential of −2.1 Vversus an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The reaction was reversible; minor waves appeared in the reverse scan at a potential of approximately −0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl indicating, a second slow process (data not shown). This follow-up product probably results from protonation of the radical anion yielding a free radical. Residual traces of water in the solvent could be the proton donor for such species. The structures of six CoA thioesters obtained after incubation of [ring-13C6]benzoyl-CoA with purified benzoyl-CoA reductase (BcrCBAD protein) and 1,5-dienoyl CoA hydratase (Dch protein) from T. aromatica were established by NMR analysis. The use of multiply 13C labeled substrate facilitated signal assignments by two-dimensional INADEQUATE, HMQC, and HMQC-TOCSY spectroscopy and enabled NMR analysis with product mixtures. Specifically, the NMR data established cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA (compound 2) as the product of benzoyl-CoA reduction with titanium(III) or with reduced [8Fe-8S]-ferredoxin from T. aromatica as electron donors. This is in agreement with the results of Koch et al. (8.Koch J. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), who identified this compound as an early product in experiments with crude cell extracts of T. aromatica. The formation of this cyclic hexadiene implicates a two-electron reduction of benzoyl-CoA and fits the previously determined stoichiometry (6.Boll M. Albracht S.J.P. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The identification of 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA (compound 3) as next intermediate in the benzoyl-CoA pathway in T. aromaticafurther supports the cyclic 1,5-diene structure, because the 6-hydroxy-1-ene can be formed by the enzymatic addition of water to the conjugated double bonds of the diene (10.Laempe D. Eisenreich W. Bacher A Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), either via a 1,4- or via a 1,2-addition mechanism. The four genes of benzoyl-CoA reductase from T. aromaticaand R. palustris show high similarity (78% sequence identity) (22.Egland P.G. Pelletier D.A. Dispensa M. Gibson J. Harwood C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6484-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 23.Breese K Boll M. Alt-Mörbe J. Schägger H. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Gibson and Gibson (11.Gibson K.J. Gibson J. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 696-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) detected cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1-carboxylate (compound 4) and cyclohexa-1,4-diene-1-carboxylate (compound 5) as products of benzoate reduction in cell suspension experiments with R. palustris. These compounds were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry techniques after derivatization of the free acids to the corresponding methyl esters. The discrepancy to our results might have different reasons. Either benzoyl-CoA reduction proceeds via different mechanisms in R. palustris as discussed elsewhere (3.Harwood C.S. Gibson J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 301-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Egland P.G. Pelletier D.A. Dispensa M. Gibson J. Harwood C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6484-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), or the diene isomers detected by GC/MS were artificially formed during derivatization of the products. In the so-called Birch reduction of benzoic acid with elemental sodium or lithium as reductants, 2,5-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate (compound4) is formed under kinetic control (24.Krapcho A.P. Bothnerby A.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1959; 81: 3658-3666Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The electron withdrawing character of the acid group of benzoate stabilizes the anion radical at carbon 1 of the ring; the second electron adds inpara position because of electrostatic repulsion. However, in the presence of a strong base, the thermodynamically more stable conjugated 1,5-diene can be obtained (25.Birch A.J. Rao G.S. Adv. Org. Chem. 1972; 8: 1-65Google Scholar, 26.Birch A.J. Hinde A.L. Radom L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 3370-3376Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This base-catalyzed rearrangement seems to occur in the catalytic cycle of T. aromatica. The formation of the hex-1-ene compound (compound 6) at a slow rate (5.Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) explained by a two-electron reduction of the 1,5-diene (compound 2) catalyzed by benzoyl-CoA reductase. Although the hex-1-ene (compound 6) and the 2-hydroxyhexane compound (compound 7) may play an important role in the aromatic metabolism of R. palustris (3.Harwood C.S. Gibson J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 301-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Egland P.G. Pelletier D.A. Dispensa M. Gibson J. Harwood C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6484-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), their formation inT. aromatica appears as an in vitro effect without metabolic relevance. The natural electron donor, reduced ferredoxin, and the artificial reductant titanium(III) citrate yielded the same products. Surprisingly, cyclohex-2-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA (compound 9) and 6-hydroxycyclohex-2-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA (compound 8) were identified as products of benzoyl-CoA reductase and cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA hydratase when dithionite was used as an artificial electron donor. Our results strongly suggest that the artificial formation of the 6-hydroxy-2-ene (compound 8) was a product of dienoyl-CoA hydratase activity via a set of artificial isomerization and hydration reactions. In this case, cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA (compound 10) is suggested as an intermediate isomerization product (Fig. 7). Under anaerobic conditions in the presence of benzoyl-CoA reductase, MgATP, and an excess of dithionite, this hypothetical diene is further reduced to cyclohexa-2-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA (compound 9). The following observations support our suggestions: (i) When sodium dithionite was added to a benzoyl-CoA reductase/1,5-dienoyl-CoA hydratase assay that had been started with Ti(III) citrate as electron donor and benzoyl-CoA as substrate, the product pattern shifted immediately from the cyclohexa-1,5-diene/6-hydroxymonene mixture (reflecting peaks 2 and 3 in the HPLC chromatogram; cf. Fig.8 A) to a cylohexa-2-ene/6-hydroxy-2-ene mixture (reflecting peaks 9 and 8 in the HPLC chromatogram; cf. Fig.8 C). (ii) Under aerobic conditions, when the hydratase was fully active and benzoyl-CoA reductase was irreversibly inactivated, addition of dithionite induced the formation of 6-hydroxycyclohex-2-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA (compound 8) as the unique product from a cyclohexa-1,5-diene/6-hydroxymonene mixture. 6-Hydroxycyclohex-2-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA (compound 8) is considered to be a dead end product that is not in equilibrium with the corresponding diene 10 (Fig. 7). A mixture of sulfite and Ti(III) citrate could replace dithionite in the artificial product formation, whereas sulfite alone had no effect on dienoyl-CoA hydratase activity. We assume that a sulfoxide radical anion is formed from sulfite by reduction with Ti(III) citrate as an active species; it is known that anaerobic dithionite solutions contain the same radical anion (27.Lambeth D.O. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6095-6103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For energetics of anaerobic enzymatic ring reduction, a Birch mechanism has been proposed for enzymatic reduction of the aromatic ring, which predicts alternating one-electron transfer and protonation steps (8.Koch J. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,9.Buckel W. Keese R. Angew. Chem. 1995; 107: 1595-1598Crossref Google Scholar). A ketyl radical anion at the carbonyl C atom of the thioester group rather than a benzene radical anion was suggested as the first intermediate. In case of benzene reduction, the potential for the first electron transfer step is −3.1 V (versus a normal hydrogen electrode) (28.Mortensen J. Heinze J. Angew. Chem. 1984; 96: 64-65Crossref Google Scholar). A thioester group at the aromatic ring should lower this potential significantly (9.Buckel W. Keese R. Angew. Chem. 1995; 107: 1595-1598Crossref Google Scholar). Indeed, usingS-ethyl-thiobenzoate the potential is lowered to −1.9 V (versus a normal hydrogen electrode). This drastic effect illustrates the importance of the thioester group in enzymatic reduction of benzoyl-CoA. However, the energetics of enzymatic ring reduction are still not clear. The two electron reduction of the aromatic ring is driven by the stoichiometric hydrolysis of 2 ATP to 2 ADP + 2 Pi. If the free hydrolysis energy of both ATP molecules (∼−100 kJ) is coupled to a single electron transfer the redox potential can maximally be lowered by 1 V. Assuming this situation, the potential of the first electron transferred from the natural electron donor ferredoxin withE′° = −0.45 (versus normal hydrogen electrode) could be lowered to −1.45 V in enzymatic aromatic ring reduction. In conjunction with the determined potential of the model compoundS-ethyl-thiobenzoate (−1.9 V), the hydrolysis of ATP appears to be insufficient to enable ring reduction. However, partial protonation of the electron accepting carbonyl function by a protonated amino acid residue or a protonated Fe-S cluster could result in a more positive redox potential for the first electron transfer yielding the ketyl radical anions 11 and 12 (Fig.9) as proposed by Buckel and Keese (9.Buckel W. Keese R. Angew. Chem. 1995; 107: 1595-1598Crossref Google Scholar). The subsequent protonation of the radical anion seems to be highly exergonic, thus driving the endergonic first electron transfer step. The transfer of the second electron to the protonated free radical (compound 13) should require less energy than the formation of the radical anion, and protonation of compound 14 to the diene product (compound 2) is considered a highly exergonic reaction.

Although many studies have demonstrated that the iron chelators mimosine and deferoxamine inhibit DNA replication in mammalian cells, their mechanism of action remains controversial. The effects of mimosine on folate metabolism were investigated in human MCF-7 cells and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma. Our findings indicate that mimosine is a folate antagonist and that its effects are cell-specific. MCF-7 cells cultured in the presence of 350 μm mimosine were growth-arrested, whereas mimosine had no effect on SH-SY5Y cell proliferation. Mimosine altered the distribution of folate cofactor forms in MCF-7 cells, indicating that mimosine targets folate metabolism. However, mimosine does not influence folate metabolism in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma. The effect of mimosine on folate metabolism is associated with decreased cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT) expression in MCF-7 cells but not in SH-SY5Y cells. MCF-7 cells exposed to mimosine for 24 h have a 95% reduction in cSHMT protein, and cSHMT promoter activity is reduced over 95%. Transcription of the cSHMT gene is also inhibited by deferoxamine in MCF-7 cells, indicating that mimosine inhibits cSHMT transcription by chelating iron. Analyses of mimosine-resistant MCF-7 cell lines demonstrate that although the effect of mimosine on cell cycle is independent of its effects on cSHMT expression, it inhibits both processes through a common regulatory mechanism.

Haematol. 1978; 39: 357-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and iron deficiency has been demonstrated to impair folate utilization in some but not all tissues (5.Chanarin I. Rothman D. Berry V. Br. Med. J. 1965; 1: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, maternal iron deficiency decreases secretion of folate into milk (6.O'Connor D.L. Picciano M.F. Sherman A.R. Burgert S.L. J. Nutr. 1987; 117: 1715-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 7.Vitale J.J. Streiff R.R. Hellerstein E.E. Lancet. 1965; 2: 393-394Abstract PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) without decreasing maternal serum or red blood cell folate levels in rats. However, the biochemical mechanisms underlying the influence of iron deficiency on folate metabolism have not been established (6.O'Connor D.L. Picciano M.F. Sherman A.R. Burgert S.L. J. Nutr. 1987; 117: 1715-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Mimosine, a plant amino acid and tyrosine analog (Fig.1), is a toxin that chelates iron and inhibits mammalian DNA replication. Mimosine is known to block DNA replication in breast cancer cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells at the initiation phase, although, the precise mechanism by which mimosine alters DNA replication remains unclear (8.Kalejta R.F. Hamlin J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, Alpan and Pardee (11.Alpan R.S. Pardee A.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 893-901PubMed Google Scholar) proposed a mechanism to account for the effects of mimosine on DNA replication. This mechanism proposes that mimosine induces a cascade of events that result in the inhibition of DNA replication. This cascade is initiated by mimosine targeting ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) or the folate-dependent enzyme SHMT, resulting in an inhibition of dNTP synthesis. There is some evidence to support this suggestion. Mimosine decreases purine deoxyribonucleotide pools over 85% in Chinese hamster ovary cells but does not affect pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide pools (9.Gilbert D.M. Neilson A. Miyazawa H. DePamphilis M.L. Burhans W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9597-9606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The decrease in dNTP pools is also observed upon treatment with the iron chelator DFO. This effect has been attributed to the inhibition of the iron-dependent enzyme RNR (10.Kulp K.S. Vulliet P.R. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 139: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and subsequent disruption of purine deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis. However, other data do not support this mechanism. Inhibition of RNR would not be expected either to inhibit the initiation phase of DNA replication (8.Kalejta R.F. Hamlin J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or to specifically lower purine deoxyribonucleotide pools. Furthermore, the effect of mimosine on DNA replication is cell-specific. Embryonic Xenopus and mouse cells are resistant to mimosine (9.Gilbert D.M. Neilson A. Miyazawa H. DePamphilis M.L. Burhans W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9597-9606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11.Alpan R.S. Pardee A.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 893-901PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Wang Y. Zhao J. Clapper J. Martin L.D. Du C. DeVore E.R. Harkins K. Dobbs D.L. Benbow R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Inhibition of RNR by iron chelation should not display cell specificity, and therefore, mimosine resistance would not be expected.Mimosine has also been suggested to deplete purine deoxyribonucleotide pools by targeting folate metabolism through the inhibition of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). SHMT catalyzes the conversion of tetrahydrofolate (THF) and serine to glycine and methyleneTHF (14.Shane B. Vitam. Horm. 1989; 45: 273-335Google Scholar). This reaction generates single carbon units that are carried by folate cofactors for purine, thymidine, and methionine biosynthesis (14.Shane B. Vitam. Horm. 1989; 45: 273-335Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Mimosine has been shown to bind SHMT in crude Chinese hamster ovary cell extracts (13.Lin H. Falchetto R. Mosca P.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Hamlin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2548-2556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, mimosine does not inhibit SHMT activity in vitro. Therefore, the role of mimosine in influencing SHMT function and the role of SHMT in DNA replication inhibition has yet to be proved (13.Lin H. Falchetto R. Mosca P.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F.

The three primary products of cytoplasmic folate metabolism are purines, thymidylate, and methionine. The formate is derived from mitochondrial folate metabolism (25.Appling D.R.

The primary enzymes discussed include cSHMT, MTHFR, and MS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The second step in the mechanism put forth by Alpan and Pardee (11.Alpan R.S. Pardee A.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 893-901PubMed Google Scholar) proposes that depletion in dNTP substrates results in DNA strand breaks, which induce the expression of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. The cascade is completed through direct inhibition of cell cycle progression secondary to late G1 arrest by p21. Similar studies have suggested that another cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27Kip1 is a secondary target of mimosine as well, and elevations in p27Kip1 expression lead to G1arrest (15.Wang G. Miskimins R. Miskimins W. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This theoretical cascade is supported by studies showing that mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lack p21 are less sensitive to mimosine exposure; increased p21 expression has been documented in the presence of mimosine (11.Alpan R.S. Pardee A.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 893-901PubMed Google Scholar).The precipitating event in this cascade is the formation of DNA strand breaks caused by inhibition of SHMT and folate metabolism or RNR by mimosine. However, there is little conclusive evidence that mimosine influences folate metabolism or RNR activity in vivo. In the current study, we examine the effects of mimosine and another iron chelator, DFO, on SHMT and folate metabolism. These studies indicate that mimosine does target folate metabolism, but in a cell-specific manner. We propose that the effects of mimosine on folate metabolism do not directly result in an inhibition of DNA replication. Rather, we demonstrate that mimosine can alter cSHMT gene expression and thereby modify folate metabolism in a cell-specific manner, and we provide evidence that there is a regulatory transcriptional mechanism that is induced by mimosine that accounts for the cell-specific effects of mimosine on cell cycle progression.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study are the first to present a biochemical mechanism that accounts for animal and clinical studies that demonstrate that iron deficiency modifies folate metabolism in a tissue-specific manner (5.Chanarin I. Rothman D. Berry V. Br. Med. J. 1965; 1: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6.O'Connor D.L. Picciano M.F. Sherman A.R. Burgert S.L. J. Nutr. 1987; 117: 1715-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Using iron chelators to simulate iron deficiency, we show that the effect of iron on folate metabolism is mediated, at least in part, by changes in cSHMT expression. The iron chelator DFO induces the same effects on cSHMT expression as mimosine, and the chemical compositions of mimosine and DFO are highly dissimilar. This suggests that it is the capacity of mimosine to chelate iron that modifies folate metabolism and cSHMT expression. Although previous studies have demonstrated that mimosine binds the SHMT protein, this observation appears to be unrelated to the regulation by mimosine of cSHMT expression as described here.SHMT is present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm, and the two enzymes are encoded on distinct genes (14.Shane B. Vitam. Horm. 1989; 45: 273-335Google Scholar, 21.Girgis S. Nasrallah I.M. Suh J.R. Oppenheim E. Zanetti K.A. Mastri M.G. Stover P.J. Gene. 1998; 210: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25.Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Whereas the mitochondrial isozyme appears to be the primary source of glycine and single carbon units for cytoplasmic folate metabolism, the cytoplasmic isozyme appears to regulate folate metabolism (14.Shane B. Vitam. Horm. 1989; 45: 273-335Google Scholar, 21.Girgis S. Nasrallah I.M. Suh J.R. Oppenheim E. Zanetti K.A. Mastri M.G. Stover P.J. Gene. 1998; 210: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28.Pfendner W. Pizer L.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 200: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 29.Fowler B. Whitehouse C. Wenzel F. Wraith J.E. Pediatr. Res. 1997; 41: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In particular, the cSHMT enzyme has been suggested to regulate the synthesis of 5-methylTHF, a required cofactor for homocysteine remethylation. Accumulation of 5-methylTHF in the cytoplasm has been shown to induce clinical symptoms of folate deficiency and even death in both animals and humans (30.Savage D.G. Lindenbaum J. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 237-286Google Scholar). The accumulation of 5-methylTHF that is associated with a loss in cSHMT protein supports the notion that cSHMT can regulate the homocysteine remethylation cycle (16.Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Additionally, inhibition of cSHMT activity by expressing cSHMT antisense constructs also results in the accumulation of 5-methylTHF in MCF-7 cells.3 Therefore, the conversion of glycine to serine catalyzed by cSHMT regulates the flux of one-carbon units through the homocysteine remethylation pathway, in MCF-7 cells. In addition, our data suggest that iron chelators indirectly influence the regulation of homocysteine remethylation.Although other studies have demonstrated that mimosine and hydroxyurea decrease dATP and dGTP pools in other mammalian cell lines (9.Gilbert D.M. Neilson A. Miyazawa H. DePamphilis M.L. Burhans W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9597-9606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), this effect is probably not directly responsible for the effectiveness of mimosine as an inhibitor of DNA replication. We have also determined that mimosine does not alter dNTP pools in MCF-7 cells,3and the results of this study demonstrate that mimosine does not inhibit cell cycle in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma. Therefore, although mimosine can inhibit both dNTP synthesis and folate metabolism in some cell lines, there is no consistent correlation between these effects and the inhibition of DNA replication. Finally, analyses of mimosine-resistant MCF-7 cell lines demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of mimosine on the cell cycle can be rescued without rescuing inhibition of cSHMT promoter activity. This further demonstrates that the effects of mimosine on folate metabolism do not directly influence DNA replication.Because the effects of mimosine on DNA replication do not arise from alterations in dNTP pools secondary to modified RNR or SHMT activity, alternative mechanisms must be considered. The results of this study strongly indicate that the mechanisms that lead to inhibition of DNA replication and inhibition of cSHMT promoter activity are related. Both events show a similar sensitivity to iron chelator concentrations, and both events are rescued in a mimosine-resistant cell line. These results suggest that a cis-acting silencer element is present within the cSHMT proximal promoter that responds to iron chelation and is undoubtedly present in other genes. Therefore, genes regulated by this consensus sequence would have altered transcription rates in the presence of mimosine.The common effect of mimosine on inhibition of cSHMT transcription and cell cycle is specific for iron chelators. Aphidicolin, a DNA polymerase inhibitor that is used to block cell cycle progression at the G1/S boundary, does not deplete cSHMT enzyme levels, nor does it inhibit cSHMT promoter activity as seen for mimosine. Hydroxyurea, an agent that also blocks the cell cycle at the G1/S boundary, also has been shown to depresses deoxyribonucleotide pools (31.Collins A. Oates D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but it does not influence cSHMT protein levels. Therefore, the effect of iron chelators on cSHMT expression in MCF-7 cells appears to be unique. The identification of this mimosine-sensitive transcription element and the genes that it regulates will likely enhance not only our understanding of the mechanism through which mimosine inhibits cell proliferation but also our understanding of the role of iron in influencing folate metabolism. There are several well characterized cellular responses that are triggered following decreases in the regulatory, non-ferritin-bound iron pool. Many of these responses are mediated through the iron regulatory protein, which can bind with specificity to certain mRNA species and regulate translation (1.Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 174-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The concentration of cellular regulatory iron is decreased by iron deficiency or by elevated expression of heavy chain ferritin, a protein that sequesters intracellular iron (2.Picard V. Epsztejn S. Santambrogio P. Cabantchik Z.I. Beaumont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15382-15386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 3.Picard V. Renaudie F. Porcher C. Hentze M.W. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2057-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequestration of intracellular iron by chelators, including DFO,1has been commonly used to trigger physiological changes associated with iron deficiency. The influence of iron deficiencies, both induced and naturally occurring, on folate metabolism has been well documented in cell culture models, animal models, and humans. Iron deficiency can result in morphological alterations in granulocytes similar to folate deficiency (4.Das K.C. Herbert V. Colman N. Longo D.L. Br. J.

The iron chelator DFO induces the same effects on cSHMT expression as mimosine, and the chemical compositions of mimosine and DFO are highly dissimilar. This suggests that it is the capacity of mimosine to chelate iron that modifies folate metabolism and cSHMT expression. Although previous studies have demonstrated that mimosine binds the SHMT protein, this observation appears to be unrelated to the regulation by mimosine of cSHMT expression as described here. SHMT is present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm, and the two enzymes are encoded on distinct genes (14.Shane B. Vitam. Horm. 1989; 45: 273-335Google Scholar, 21.Girgis S. Nasrallah I.M.

Whereas the mitochondrial isozyme appears to be the primary source of glycine and single carbon units for cytoplasmic folate metabolism, the cytoplasmic isozyme appears to regulate folate metabolism (14.Shane B. Vitam. Horm. 1989; 45: 273-335Google Scholar, 21.Girgis S. Nasrallah I.M. Suh J.R. Oppenheim E. Zanetti K.A. Mastri M.G. Stover P.J.

In particular, the cSHMT enzyme has been suggested to regulate the synthesis of 5-methylTHF, a required cofactor for homocysteine remethylation. Accumulation of 5-methylTHF in the cytoplasm has been shown to induce clinical symptoms of folate deficiency and even death in both animals and humans (30.Savage D.G. Lindenbaum J. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 237-286Google Scholar). The accumulation of 5-methylTHF that is associated with a loss in cSHMT protein supports the notion that cSHMT can regulate the homocysteine remethylation cycle (16.Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Additionally, inhibition of cSHMT activity by expressing cSHMT antisense constructs also results in the accumulation of 5-methylTHF in MCF-7 cells.3 Therefore, the conversion of glycine to serine catalyzed by cSHMT regulates the flux of one-carbon units through the homocysteine remethylation pathway, in MCF-7 cells. In addition, our data suggest that iron chelators indirectly influence the regulation of homocysteine remethylation. Although other studies have demonstrated that mimosine and hydroxyurea decrease dATP and dGTP pools in other mammalian cell lines (9.Gilbert D.M. Neilson A. Miyazawa H. DePamphilis M.L. Burhans W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9597-9606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), this effect is probably not directly responsible for the effectiveness of mimosine as an inhibitor of DNA replication. We have also determined that mimosine does not alter dNTP pools in MCF-7 cells,3and the results of this study demonstrate that mimosine does not inhibit cell cycle in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma. Therefore, although mimosine can inhibit both dNTP synthesis and folate metabolism in some cell lines, there is no consistent correlation between these effects and the inhibition of DNA replication. Finally, analyses of mimosine-resistant MCF-7 cell lines demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of mimosine on the cell cycle can be rescued without rescuing inhibition of cSHMT promoter activity. This further demonstrates that the effects of mimosine on folate metabolism do not directly influence DNA replication. Because the effects of mimosine on DNA replication do not arise from alterations in dNTP pools secondary to modified RNR or SHMT activity, alternative mechanisms must be considered. The results of this study strongly indicate that the mechanisms that lead to inhibition of DNA replication and inhibition of cSHMT promoter activity are related. Both events show a similar sensitivity to iron chelator concentrations, and both events are rescued in a mimosine-resistant cell line. These results suggest that a cis-acting silencer element is present within the cSHMT proximal promoter that responds to iron chelation and is undoubtedly present in other genes. Therefore, genes regulated by this consensus sequence would have altered transcription rates in the presence of mimosine. The common effect of mimosine on inhibition of cSHMT transcription and cell cycle is specific for iron chelators. Aphidicolin, a DNA polymerase inhibitor that is used to block cell cycle progression at the G1/S boundary, does not deplete cSHMT enzyme levels, nor does it inhibit cSHMT promoter activity as seen for mimosine. Hydroxyurea, an agent that also blocks the cell cycle at the G1/S boundary, also has been shown to depresses deoxyribonucleotide pools (31.Collins A. Oates D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but it does not influence cSHMT protein levels. Therefore, the effect of iron chelators on cSHMT expression in MCF-7 cells appears to be unique. The identification of this mimosine-sensitive transcription element and the genes that it regulates will likely enhance not only our understanding of the mechanism through which mimosine inhibits cell proliferation but also our understanding of the role of iron in influencing folate metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2037272593,"In this study, we demonstrate that methylation-dependent repression of the Pdha-2core promoter is mediated regionally through a consensus activating transcription factor/cAMP-responsive element-binding site located between nucleotides −54 and −62 upstream of the major transcriptional start site. Targeting of the CpG dinucleotide within thiscis-element significantly disrupts the ability of this basal promoter to activate gene expression in vitro and completely abolishes promoter activity in vivo. DNase I footprinting experiments indicated that availability of the nuclear factor(s) binding this element is limiting in sexually immature mouse testis, and as such, these factors may play an important role in the coordinate activation of early spermatogenic gene expression. Interestingly, CpG dinucleotides associated with the hypersensitive region flanking the activating transcription factor/cAMP-responsive element-binding site appear to confer some conformational structure on the promoter since mutations at these specific CpG dinucleotides result in elevated basal levels of transcription. This raises the possibility of a potential bifunctional role for CpG dinucleotides in either methylation-dependent or -independent processes. Our data support the notion that hypomethylation and transcription factor recruitment are necessary events that precede gene activation at the early stages of spermatogenesis.

Specifically, those involved in (i) the activation of early cell-specific gene expression coincident with the appearance of primary spermatocytes and (ii) the coordination of the expression of these genes during this period are poorly understood. What is becoming clearer, however, is the role of epigenetic influences on gene modulation (1.Eden S. Hashimshony T. Keshet I. Cedar H. Nature. 1998; 394: 842Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 2.Jones P.L. Jan Veenstra G.C. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat.

A number of studies have provided strong correlative evidence that suggests that demethylation and chromatin reorganization of the germ cell genome are a prerequisite for gene activation in early spermatocyte differentiation (5.Ariel M. Ceder H. McCarrey J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6.Kramer J.A. McCarrey J.R. Djakiew D. Krawetz S.A.

Reprod. 1998; 59: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although DNA hypomethylation, in general, appears to be a requirement for transcriptional activation, it alone is not sufficient for the orchestrated activation of spermatocyte-specific genes. This was initially demonstrated by Ariel et al. (5.Ariel M. Ceder H. McCarrey J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), who showed a 10-day delay in transcriptional activation ofPgk-2 following demethylation of this gene in prospermatogonia. Similarly, we demonstrated that demethylatedPdha-2, a gene that encodes the testis-specific E1α subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (8.Iannello R.C. Dahl H.H.-M. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 47: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), remains transcriptionally silent in a subpopulation of spermatogonia, but is active in pachytene spermatocytes (9.Iannello R.C. Young J. Summarsono S. Gould J. Tymms M. Dahl H.H.-M. Hedger M. Kola I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Conversely, methylation of Pdha-2 has consistently been associated with transcriptional inactivity in both spermatogonia and somatic tissues. Although the 187-nucleotide Pdha-2 basal promoter can direct transcription in a testis- and temporal-specific manner in vivo, it behaves as a strong constitutive promoterin vitro (9.Iannello R.C. Young J. Summarsono S. Gould J. Tymms M. Dahl H.H.-M. Hedger M. Kola I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10.Iannello R.C. Kola I. Dahl H.H.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22581-22590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent study, we demonstrated that this constitutive activity in somatic cells can be significantly reduced following in vitro methylation and showed that an outcome of methylation is the specific abolition of factor binding to a consensus ATF1/CRE-binding site within the Pdha-2 core promoter (9.Iannello R.C. Young J. Summarsono S. Gould J. Tymms M. Dahl H.H.-M. Hedger M. Kola I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the mechanisms that lead to the activation ofPdha-2, we sought to look more closely at those processes that are involved in maintaining transcriptional silencing of this gene and specifically how methylation mediates this. In this study, we investigated the relative importance of specific CpG dinucleotides residing within the Pdha-2 core promoter and to what extent the ATF/CRE-binding site and -binding factor(s) may be involved in this process. Our data indicate that methylation-dependent repression is mediated via a CpG dinucleotide within the ATF/CRE-binding site. The contributions of other CpG dinucleotides are negligible, although a pair of CpG dinucleotides flanking this binding site may contribute to a conformational state in a methylation-independent manner. Furthermore, activation of the promoterin vivo is dependent upon the binding of an ATF/CRE-binding factor that appears to be in limiting quantities early in spermatogenesis. The wild-type Pdha-2 core promoter-CAT construct used in this study has been described elsewhere (10.Iannello R.C. Kola I. Dahl H.H.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22581-22590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the core promoter construct contains a fragment of thePdha-2 promoter spanning nucleotide sequences from positions −187 to +22 relative to the transcriptional start site. This promoter cassette was cloned into the CAT reporter-containing vector pCAT-Basic (Promega). In this study, we have designated this construct as pQCAT. To generate various mutant promoter constructs, we used, as a polymerase chain reaction strategy, primers containing appropriate nucleotide substitutions and the core promoter as template. These promoter cassettes were subsequently cloned into pCAT-Basic and confirmed by sequencing. To generate pQΔCRECAT, we used the above strategy to substitute the CpG dinucleotide at positions −56 and −55 (within the ATF/CRE-binding site) with CpA (Fig.1). pQ1.5CAT was generated by mutating the CpG dinucleotide pair at positions −47 to −44 from CGCG to GATC. Finally, to generate pQ2.5CAT, we used the pQΔCRE promoter as template and sequence modified primers such that the final construct contains the CpA substitution within the ATF/CRE-binding site as well as the GATC substitution at nucleotides −47 to −44. Mouse NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were plated at an initial density of 5 × 105cells/60-mm culture dish and maintained in a 5% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C. The medium was changed 3 h prior to transfection. Transfection of plasmid DNA was mediated by DNA/calcium phosphate coprecipitation (11.Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar) using 15 μg of plasmid DNA/plate. Six hours following transfection, the medium was removed, and cells washed twice with serum-free medium and then incubated with complete medium until ready for harvesting 48 h later. In vitro methylation of promoter constructs (10 μg) was performed following an overnight incubation at 37 °C in the presence of 1 unit of SssI methylase (New England Biolabs Inc.) and 160 μm S-adenosylmethionine. The promoter-CAT constructs were linearized and prepared for pronuclear microinjection using standard procedures (12.Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacey E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Fertilized eggs were obtained from superovulated 6-week-old F1(CBA × C57/6J) female mice. CAT assays and the preparation of cell extracts were performed as described previously (11.Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar) using [14C]chloramphenicol. Activity was determined by measuring acetylated and unreacted [14C]chloramphenicol products following ascending thin-layer chromatography and visualization using a Fujix BAS 1000 image analyzer. Electrophoretic mobility shift and DNase I footprinting assays were performed using nuclear extracts prepared from mouse testis and brain as described by Iannello et al. (10.Iannello R.C. Kola I. Dahl H.H.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22581-22590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments in which antibodies were used in gel shift assays, antibodies were preincubated with nuclear extracts 10 min prior to the addition of the radiolabeled double-stranded ATF/CRE-binding oligonucleotide. Double-stranded oligonucleotides used in this study that spanned the Pdha-2ATF/CRE and hypersensitive sites consisted of the wild-type pQ oligonucleotide (5′-CTTGCTGACGTAG GCAACGCG-3′), ΔCRE (5′-CTTGCTGACATAG GCAACGCG-3′), 1.5 (5′-CTTGCTGAC GTAGGCAAGATC-3′), and 2.5 (5′-CTTGCTGA CATAGGCAAGATC-3′). Pdha-2 core promoter probes used for DNase I footprinting analysis was generated by polymerase chain reaction as described by Iannello (13.Iannello R.C. Tymms M.J. Methods in Molecular Biology: In Vitro Transcription and Translation Protocols. 37. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1995: 379-391Google Scholar). In a previous study, we had established an in vivo correlation between transcriptional activation and demethylation of 5-methylcytosine nucleotides along the length of the Pdha-2 core promoter (9.Iannello R.C. Young J. Summarsono S. Gould J. Tymms M. Dahl H.H.-M. Hedger M. Kola I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the same study, we demonstrated that in vitro methylation of this promoter by SssI methylase significantly reduced its ability to direct reporter gene expression in NIH 3T3 cells. A particularly interesting observation resulting from this earlier work was that CpG methylation specifically inhibited nuclear factor binding to an ATF/CRE-binding site within the promoter. Coinciding with a loss in factor binding was a notable loss of a DNase I-hypersensitive site residing between the ATF/CRE and MEP2-binding sites. Both the ATF/CRE site and DNase I-hypersensitive region contain CpG dinucleotides (Fig.2). To ascertain the extent to which these changes contribute to the observed methylation-dependent silencing of promoter activity, we generated cassettes in which specific CpG dinucleotides within thePdha-2 core promoter were mutated (Fig. 1), and the subsequent effects of in vitro CpG methylation were assessed by CAT reporter assays following transient transfection into NIH 3T3 cells (Table I).Table IEffect of in vitro promoter methylation on CAT activities in NIH 3T3 cells transiently transfected with wild-type and mutant Pdha-2 core promoter-CAT constructsConstructCAT activityaCAT activity was calculated as the percentage conversion of chloroamphenicol/h/% extract, adjusted for background and expressed as percent arbitrary units. relative to pQCATbThe relative mean was calculated as the percentage mean relative to pQCAT.CAT activityaCAT activity was calculated as the percentage conversion of chloroamphenicol/h/% extract, adjusted for background and expressed as percent arbitrary units.relative to pQ1.5CATcThe relative mean was calculated as the percentage mean relative to pQ1.5CAT.%%pQCAT100pQCAT methdMeth designates Pdha-2 promoter constructs methylated in vitro by SssI methylase as described under “Experimental Procedures.”32 ± 9.8pQΔCRECAT40 ± 5.9pQΔCRECAT meth27 ± 1.0pQ1.5CAT168 ± 20.2100 ± 11.9pQ1.5CAT meth60 ± 24.144 ± 9.6pQ2.5CAT88 ± 11.952.4 ± 7.1pQ2.5CAT meth74 ± 14.543.8 ± 8.5a CAT activity was calculated as the percentage conversion of chloroamphenicol/h/% extract, adjusted for background and expressed as percent arbitrary units.b The relative mean was calculated as the percentage mean relative to pQCAT.c The relative mean was calculated as the percentage mean relative to pQ1.5CAT.d Meth designates Pdha-2 promoter constructs methylated in vitro by SssI methylase as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Consistent with our previous studies, the wild-type Pdha-2promoter (pQCAT) showed a significant reduction (68%) in activity following SssI methylase treatment compared with its untreated control (Fig. 3 A). As a first step toward examining the relative contribution of specific CpG dinucleotides to this reduction, we generated a promoter construct (pQΔCRECAT) containing a single nucleotide substitution (CpG to CpA) within the ATF/CRE-binding site. A consequence of this substitution is that nuclear factor binding to the ATF/CRE cis-element is ablated as demonstrated by EMSA analysis (Fig.4). In this respect, the outcome of this mutation is similar to that observed following methylation of the wild-type promoter, in which binding to the ATF/CRE-binding site is abolished. Results from transient transfection assays indicated that the CpA substitution alone was sufficient to reduce promoter activity by 60% (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, there was no statistical difference between this reduction and that observed following thein vitro methylation of the wild-type promoter, suggesting that the ATF/CRE element may be central to the methylation-dependent silencing of the Pdha-2gene. Supporting this notion are the results of experiments showing the effect of in vitro methylation on pQΔCRECAT reporter activity. In these studies, only a further 13% reduction in promoter activity was observed following SssI methylase treatment compared with the untreated construct, suggesting that the involvement of the remaining CpG dinucleotides in this mechanism may be marginal.Figure 4EMSA analysis showing the effects of nucleotide substitutions within the ATF/CRE and flanking hypersensitive sites on transcription factor binding. Radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (2 ng) containing both these regions were incubated with 10 μg of NIH 3T3 nuclear extracts.

The double-stranded oligonucleotide ΔCRE is identical to pQ with the exception of a CpA substitution of CpG within the ATF/CRE-binding site. Nucleotide substitutions in the hypersensitive site but containing a functional ATF/CRE site as found in the promoter construct pQ1.5CAT are represented in the double-stranded oligonucleotide 1.5.

In vitro methylation of pQ1.5CAT, in which the CpG dinucleotide pair in the hypersensitive site was substituted for GATC, reduced promoter activity by 65% compared with its untreated control (Fig. 3 B). The GATC substitution has no direct effect on transcription factor binding to the flanking ATF/CRE site as determined by EMSA (Fig. 4), and the CpG dinucleotide within the ATF/CREcis-element still remains subject to methylation. Importantly, the percentage reduction in promoter activity following SssI methylase treatment of pQ1.5CAT is similar to that observed following methylation of the wild-type promoter and following perturbation of the ATF/CRE site in pQΔCRECAT. Furthermore, following the introduction of an additional CpG-to-CpA substitution within the ATF/CRE site to generate the mutant construct pQ2.5CAT, SssI methylase treatment did not confer any further inhibitory effect on pQ2.5CAT relative to its untreated control (Fig. 3 B), strongly implying that repression is being mediated through the ATF/CRE-binding site. Our data clearly suggest that a critical target of in vitro CpG methylation on the Pdha-2 core promoter resides with the CpG dinucleotide within the ATF/CRE site and that repression consequently results from a loss of nuclear factor binding to this cis-element. The contribution of other CpG dinucleotides along the length of the promoter in this process appears to be negligible. An analysis of total CAT activities directed by wild-type and CpG mutant promoters (Fig.5) led to an unexpected finding. Relative to cells transfected with pQCAT (Fig. 5, bar a), those transfected with pQ1.5CAT (bar b) showed 68% higher levels of CAT activity. Although modest, this elevated level of expression was consistent. A possible explanation for this result may be that the CpG dinucleotide pair residing within the hypersensitive site confers some structural or conformational constraint on the promoter. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that promoter constructs harboring the GATC substitution (pQ1.5CAT and pQ2.5CAT) retain higher levels of residual or basal activities compared with their respective controls following either in vitro methylation or perturbation of the ATF/CRE-binding site. As shown in Fig. 5, the residual or basal level of activity directed by the promoter cassette in pQ2.5CAT (Fig. 5, bar d) is ∼2-fold higher than its respective control, pQΔCRECAT (bar c). SssI methylase treatment of pQ1.5CAT (Fig. 5, bar f) and pQ2.5CAT (bar h) had no effect on their respective residual basal levels of activity compared with their appropriate methylated controls (bars e and g). Our results suggest that the CpG dinucleotide pair flanking the ATF/CRE-binding site may confer some conformational constraint on the Pdha-2 promoter and that this function is distinct and independent of the methylation-induced repression of promoter activity mediated through the ATF/CRE-binding site. Given that our data implicate the ATF/CRE-binding site as having a central role in vitro in the methylation-mediated repression of the Pdha-2 core promoter, we were interested in determining the functional relevance of this site in vivo. We generated a number of transgenic mouse lines harboring the wild-type Pdha-2 promoter-CAT, pQ1.5CAT, or pQ2.5CAT cassette and analyzed the level of CAT activity driven by each promoter in testis. The results presented in Fig.6 show that the Pdha-2promoter in mice harboring both the wild-type and pQ1.5CAT cassettes can actively drive the expression of the CAT reporter gene in testis. Conversely, no detectable levels of CAT activity in testes from mice harboring pQ2.5CAT cassette could be demonstrated. Our results establish that the ATF/CRE site is necessary for promoter activation and further support the notion that in vivo targeting of this site via a methylation-mediated mechanism is sufficient to completely inactivate promoter activity. An early event in spermatogenesis is the differentiation of type B spermatogonia into primary spermatocytes. The appearance of spermatocytes correlates with the induction of a number of early spermatocyte-specific genes, including Pdha-2. It has already been demonstrated that the Pdha-2 promoter is in a hypomethylated state and transcriptionally active in spermatocytes (9.Iannello R.C. Young J. Summarsono S. Gould J. Tymms M. Dahl H.H.-M. Hedger M. Kola I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, in the same study, we demonstrated that hypomethylation of the Pdha-2 promoter is initially detectable in spermatogonia, in which this gene is inactive. It has been postulated that during the spermatogonium-spermatocyte transition, a number of events occur that may potentiate transcriptional activity, including the recruitment of transcription factors. To gain some insights as to what mechanism(s) maintain silencing of Pdha-2 in spermatogonia, we examined the pattern of transcription factor binding on the Pdha-2 promoter during sexual maturation in mice. This was achieved by performing DNase I footprinting assays using testis nuclear extracts prepared from mice at various stages of sexual maturation. The results shown in Fig. 7indicate that in testes of 8-day postnatal mice, the transcription factor Sp1 was present in sufficient quantities in our extracts to protect its cognate binding site from DNase I nicking. By day 15, protection was also apparent over the YY1- and MEP2-binding sites. By day 20, all known transcription factor-binding sites residing within the Pdha-2 core promoter were protected. At this stage, primary spermatocytes are abundant, and Pdha-2 transcripts are easily detectable by Northern blot analysis (8.Iannello R.C. Dahl H.H.-M. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 47: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The lack of protection of the ATF/CRE-binding site in extracts from 15-day-old mouse testis is, however, not indicative of an absence of factors that bind to this site. Indeed, earlier EMSA studies (10.Iannello R.C. Kola I. Dahl H.H.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22581-22590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) clearly demonstrated that protein-DNA complexes involving the ATF/CRE site were formed in nuclear extracts prepared from testes of mice as early as postnatal day 12. These data more likely suggest that factors that recognize the ATF/CRE-binding site are present, but less abundant relative to other nuclear factors during the early stages of spermatogenesis. The identity of the specific factor that recognizes the ATF/CRE site within the Pdha-2 promoter has not yet been determined. EMSA analysis using adult mouse testis and brain nuclear extracts showed two distinct patterns (Fig. 8). Brain extracts were used in these experiments for comparative analysis between two tissue preparations. NIH 3T3 nuclear extracts showed identical profiles compared with brain nuclear extracts (data not shown). Factors in brain extracts formed a single complex with double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the Pdha-2ATF/CRE-binding site. This complex could be supershifted by antibodies raised against CREB and was predominantly abolished by antibodies raised against CREM. However, in testis, multiple complexes were observed, the majority of which remained unaltered by the presence of either the anti-CREB or anti-CREM antibodies. Furthermore, antibodies raised against either the ATF-1 or ATF-2 transcription factor also failed to alter the pattern. These data suggest that a member of the ATF/CRE family other than those tested here is actively involved inPdha-2 activation during the meiotic prophase stage of spermatogenesis. The objective of this study was to gain an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the transcriptional silencing ofPdha-2. During spermatogenesis, Pdha-2 expression coincides with the appearance of early primary spermatocytes (8.Iannello R.C. Dahl H.H.-M. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 47: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14.Takakubu F. Dahl H.H.-M. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 199: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas in the spermatocyte precursor cells (spermatogonia), transcriptional activity is silenced. Similarly, no detectable levels of Pdha-2 transcription are observed in somatic tissue. In each case, methylation of the Pdha-2 promoter has been demonstrated to functionally correlate with the absence of activity (9.Iannello R.C. Young J. Summarsono S. Gould J. Tymms M. Dahl H.H.-M. Hedger M. Kola I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, prior to transcriptional activation, thePdha-2 promoter undergoes demethylation in a subpopulation of spermatogonia, but remains inactive until these cells undergo differentiation into primary spermatocytes. It has been proposed that during this spermatogonium-spermatocyte transition, transcriptional activation is preceded by a number of events that subsequently lead to activation. This period of “potentiation” (6.Kramer J.A. McCarrey J.R. Djakiew D. Krawetz S.A. Development. 1998; 125: 4749-4755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is believed to involve epigenetic modifications and changes in transcription factor constituency. Before we can gain insights into this process, we sought to better understand the molecular mechanisms by which methylation-dependent inactivation of Pdha-2 is mediated. The TATA-less and CAAT-less Pdha-2 core promoter is composed of ∼187 base pairs and contains four major transcription factor-binding sites, three of which are the Sp1, ATF/CRE, and YY1 sites. Although the Pdha-2 promoter is not a CpG island-containing promoter, several CpG dinucleotides reside within or in close proximity to these transcription factor-binding sites. Therefore, our initial investigations were directed at determining the relative contribution of some of these specific CpG dinucleotides to the modulation of Pdha-2 promoter activity. Our analysis established that the CpG dinucleotide located within the ATF/CRE-binding element is primarily responsible for mediating methylation-dependent silencing of this promoter in vitro. This conclusion was further strengthened by our observation that this site is critical for functional activation of the promoterin vivo. In contrast, methylation of CpG dinucleotides located within or close to the Sp1- and YY1-binding sites does not appear to contribute to the silencing of the Pdha-2promoter, although our data do not exclude a possible contribution that may be masked as a result of a reduced basal activity level following the ablation of ATF/CRE binding. Nevertheless, the data are consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated both transcription factor sensitivity and insensitivity to CpG methylation on several binding sites (15.Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Schaffner W. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 16.Tate P.H. Bird A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The delay in transcriptional activation of hypomethylated genes during the spermatogonium-spermatocyte transition period was originally observed with Pgk-2 by Ariel et al. (5.Ariel M. Ceder H. McCarrey J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). SincePdha-2 behaves in a similar manner, this suggests that hypomethylation is an early component in the potentiation process and that it precedes other events such as transcription factor recruitment and/or chromatin reorganization. Given the importance of the ATF/CRE-binding site for Pdha-2 activity, we performed DNase I footprinting assays to determine whether availability of the factor(s) that bind to this site could offer an explanation for the latent activation of the promoter following hypomethylation. Our data clearly show that the factor(s) binding to this site is limiting in nuclear extracts prepared from testis coincident with early stages of spermatogenesis. Similar experiments using extracts prepared from purified spermatogonia and spermatocytes will be required to determine unequivocally whether our data correlate with a spermatocyte-specific appearance of this factor. Nevertheless, our results strengthen the notion that transcription factor recruitment/availability following hypomethylation may, in part, account for the delay in the activation of the Pdha-2 promoter and are further evidence implicating the ATF/CRE site as central for promoter functionality. The specific factor that recognizes the ATF/CRE site within thePdha-2 promoter has not yet been determined. EMSA analysis using adult mouse testis and brain nuclear extracts showed two distinct patterns. A single complex is formed with brain extracts that can be supershifted by antibodies raised against CREB and that is predominantly abolished by antibodies raised against CREM. However, in testis, multiple complexes are observed, the majority of which remain unaltered by the presence of either the anti-CREB or anti-CREM antibodies. Furthermore, antibodies raised against either the ATF-1 or ATF-2 transcription factor also fail to alter the pattern. CREM may be excluded as a candidate since CREM activator protein is expressed only in haploid germ cells (17.Steger K. Anat. Embryol. 1999; 199: 471-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The role of CREB in spermatogenesis is unclear since knockout mice null for CREB show no spermatogenic defects (18.Hummler E. Cole T.J. Blendy J.A. Ganss R. Aguzzi A. Schmid W. Beermann F. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5647-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, given that (i) the integrity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is central for mitochondrial function and (ii) the factor binding to the ATF/CRE site in the Pdha-2promoter is essential for activity, the absence of any apparent deleterious spermatogenic phenotype with the CREB-null mice would also suggest that CREB is an unlikely candidate for the factor that binds to the Pdha-2 promoter during the early stages of spermatogenesis. Identification of this factor may prove to be significant in that it may provide us with some insights into early spermatogenic differentiation akin to the role CREM plays in spermiogenesis. An interesting observation from our analysis of the Pdha-2promoter was the elevation in promoter activity following mutagenesis of a pair of CpG dinucleotides flanking the ATF/CRE-binding site. Although the elevation is modest, it needs to be viewed in the context of a basal promoter-driven activity. It would be interesting to determine if a higher level of activation could be attained if these mutations were present in vivo. Experimentally, this would have to be performed in the context of the highly active full-length promoter since the activity of the core promoter alone in vivo is particularly low (9.Iannello R.C. Young J. Summarsono S. Gould J. Tymms M. Dahl H.H.-M. Hedger M. Kola I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), making differences between pQCAT and pQ1.5CAT difficult to detect. Indeed, transgenic mouse lines harboring either pQCAT or pQ1.5CAT show no significant differences when comparing CAT activities driven by the transgenic promoters. Random integration, copy number, relatively low basal activities, and the limited number of transgenic lines for each construct (n = 5) make an accurate comparison difficult. Our in vitro data are, however, not entirely surprising. Crystal engineering experiments have revealed a specific role for CpG sequences in DNA-DNA recognition, where they act as anchoring points for DNA self-fitting (19.Mayer-Jung C. Moras D. Timsit Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As such, it has been suggested that CpG dinucleotides may participate in the formation of higher order DNA structures. Therefore, perturbations in gene expression through CpG mutations may occur in at least one of three ways: first, through the disruption of transcription factor-binding sites, thereby inactivating or reducing transcriptional activity; second, by rendering local regions along regulatory DNA sequences incapable of being methylated, thereby maintaining active transcription; and finally, a third process whereby mutations of specific GpG dinucleotides, which do not play a role in regional methylation-mediated modulation, affect the three-dimensional organization of DNA segments and subsequently gene expression. In our case, mutations of the CpG dinucleotide pair in the Pdha-2core promoter resulted in an elevated level of transcriptional activity. The observed increased activity is not likely to have occurred as a result of changes in protein-DNA interactions since footprinting studies demonstrated no observable differences in protection of transcription factor-binding sites when comparing pQ1.5CAT and wild-type pQCAT. 2R. C. Iannello, J. A. Gould, J. C. Young, and Kola, unpublished data. One mechanism by which mutations in the CpG dinucleotide pair flanking the ATF site may modulate transcriptional expression is through a change in DNA conformation such that it facilitates greater stability in protein-protein interactions. This would be consistent with ourin vitro transfection data and footprinting analysis. Given that CpG dinucleotides are underrepresented in higher eukaryotic genomes due to the high mutability of methylated cytosine and that this is thought to contribute to genetic disease and cancer (20.Jackson-Grusby L. Jaenisch R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), our data may point to another model of transcriptional deregulation that may explain some of these disorders. In conclusion, to better understand the mechanisms that orchestrate the activation of testis-specific genes in early spermatogenic cells, we sought to investigate the processes that precede activation. Using thePdha-2 core promoter as a model of study, we conclude from our data that methylation-dependent repression acts via a local rather than global mechanism and that this is mediated through the ATF/CRE-binding site. Availability of the factor(s) that bind to this site may also add another level of modulatory complexity. Since the ATF/CRE-binding site is widespread, ablation of factor binding to this site through methylation may be a common mechanism by which silencing of early spermatogenic genes can be achieved."

This gas is ionized by solar ultraviolet radiation and the solar wind to form ‘pick-up’ ions9,10,11, ions in a low ionization state that retain the same compositional signatures as the original gas. The pick-up ions are carried outward by the solar wind, and they could in principle be detected far from the coma. (Sampling of pick-up ions has also been used to study interplanetary dust12,13, Venus’ tail14 and the interstellar medium15,16.) Here we report the serendipitous detection of cometary pick-up ions, most probably associated with the tail of comet Hyakutake, at a distance of 3.4 au from the nucleus. Previous observations have provided a wealth of physical and chemical information about a small sample of comets6,7,8,9, but this detection suggests that remote sampling of comet compositions, and the discovery of otherwise invisible comets, may be possible."

ETFs are heterodimeric, and they all possess one equivalent of non-covalently bound flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD) per ETF dimer, with the exception of ETF from Megasphaera elsdenii, which contains 2 equivalents of FAD per dimer (2.Whitfield C.D.

The ETFs from pig, human, Paracoccus denitrificans, andMethylophilus methylotrophus also contain 1 equivalent of AMP per protein dimer (3.Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

W3A1) is a highly specific electron carrier that accepts electrons from only one enzyme, trimethylamine dehydrogenase (TMADH) (7.Steenkamp D.J. Gallup M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4086-4089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In methylotrophic bacteria, TMADH catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of trimethylamine to dimethylamine and formaldehyde (8.Steenkamp D.J. Mallinson J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The enzyme enables these organisms to subsist on trimethylamine as their sole source of carbon. M. methylotrophus ETF consists of two subunits with molecular masses of 34 and 29 kDa (9.Chen D.W. Swenson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32120-32130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it shares considerable sequence identity with bacterial and mammalian ETFs (3.Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4.Roberts D.L. Salazar D. Fulmer J.P. Frerman F.E. Kim J.-J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1977-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Preliminary crystallographic studies of M. methylotrophus ETF have been reported, but to date no crystallographic structure for the protein is available (10.White S.A. Mathews F.S. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mammalian and bacterial ETFs are thought to act as 1-electron carriers, cycling between the oxidized and anionic flavin semiquinone forms. The ETF from M. elsdenii is unusual in that it serves as a 2-electron carrier. ETFs from mammalian sources and P. denitrificans can be reduced (albeit over a long time period) to the dihydroquinone form by reduction with dithionite or during photochemical reduction. M. methylotrophus ETF is readily converted to the semiquinone form in reactions with TMADH or during artificial reduction with dithionite. Further reduction of M. methylotrophus ETF to its dihydroquinone state can be accomplished electrochemically (11.Byron C.M. Stankovich M.T. Husain M. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8582-8587Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or when ETF is in complex with TMADH (12.Jang M.-H. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12546-12552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). That ETF can be reduced to the 2-electron level when in complex with TMADH provides evidence for structural perturbation on forming the electron transfer complex. The midpoint reduction potentials of the quinone/semiquinone and semiquinone/dihydroquinone couples of the FAD in M. methylotrophus ETF have been determined (11.Byron C.M. Stankovich M.T. Husain M. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8582-8587Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The potential of the quinone/semiquinone couple is exceptionally high (+196 mV), consistent with a need to accept electrons from the 4Fe-4S center of TMADH (midpoint potential, +102 mV (13.Barber M.J. Pollock V. Spence J.T. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)). The semiquinone/dihydroquinone couple, however, is more conventional in value (−197 mV), indicating that there is a kinetic block on full reduction of ETF by dithionite (−530 mV) or photoexcited deazariboflavin (−650 mV). The potentials measured for free ETF may not of course reflect the situation in the electron transfer complex but nevertheless are likely to serve as a reasonable guide. The structure of human ETF has been determined at 2.1-Å resolution (3.Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and this protein shares 31% sequence identity with M. methylotrophus ETF. Using the x-ray structure of human ETF as a template, a model of the structure of M. methylotrophus ETF has been built both in free solution and in complex with TMADH (14.Chohan K.K. Scrutton N.S. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Pept. Lett. 1998; 5: 231-236Google Scholar). The model predicts that the two subunits (subunit α (residues 1–321) and subunit β (residues 322–585)) of M. methylotrophusETF comprise three domains, viz. domain I (the N-terminal region of the α subunit), domain II (the C terminus of the α subunit and a small C-terminal region of the β subunit), and domain III (the majority of the β subunit). M. methylotrophus ETF is thought to be Y-shaped, with domains I and III forming a shallow “bowl” in which domain II rests; domain II is thought to be connected to domains I and III by two flexible regions of polypeptide chain (14.Chohan K.K. Scrutton N.S. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Pept. Lett. 1998; 5: 231-236Google Scholar). The isoalloxazine ring of FAD interacts almost exclusively with domain II (see Fig. 1). Significantly, the model shows that domain II of the M. methylotrophus ETF model must be rotated by approximately 50° relative to domains I and III in order to form an active electron transfer complex with TMADH (14.Chohan K.K. Scrutton N.S. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Pept. Lett. 1998; 5: 231-236Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The models of ETF and the electron transfer complex formed between TMADH and ETF suggest that ETF is a dynamic molecule and that large scale conformational changes are required for complex assembly. It has been proposed that free ETF adopts a discrete electron transfer (eT)-inactive conformation similar to that of crystalline human ETF, whereas in complex with TMADH, ETF adopts an eT-active conformation. The possibility arises, however, that free ETF can populate a range of conformations between the eT-inactive and eT-active forms and that these are converted to the eT-active conformation during complex assembly. In this paper we have used small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments to gain additional insight into the structural properties of M. methylotrophus ETF in solution. This low resolution technique is a powerful method to probe the arrangement of domains in multidomain proteins, protein oligomerization, and complex formation (see e.g. Ref. 15.Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small-Angle X-Ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1987Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, the use of SAXS experiments to obtain ab initio model-independent molecular envelope structures of proteins in solution has been described (16.Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Stuhrmann H.B. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 798-802Crossref Google Scholar, 17.Grossmann J.G. Hasnain S.S. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 770-775Crossref Google Scholar) as an effective approach for identifying molecular features and changes in soluble proteins. The method, for example, has been used successfully to explore the large conformational change in metal-bound and metal free transferrin (18.Grossmann J.G. Crawley J.B. Strange R.W. Patel K.J. Murphy L.M. Neu M. Evans R.W. Hasnain S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and the methane monooxygenase electron transfer complex (19.Gallagher S.C. Callaghan A.J. Zhao J. Dalton H. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6752-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that our SAXS data are consistent with domain II of M. methylotrophus ETF pivoting around the predicted hinge regions at the domain II/domain I and domain II/domain III boundaries and that complex assembly with TMADH must therefore proceed by an induced fit mechanism. The region of M. methylotrophus genomic DNA encoding the two subunits of ETF was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Oligonucleotide primers 1 (5′ AAT GAA GGA GAC GAA GGT ATG AAG ATA TTA GTG 3′) and 2 (5′ TTT TTT TTT AAA CTA TGC TGC AAG CTG CGC TTT CAG CTC TTC 3′) were designed using the published gene sequence forM. methylotrophus ETF (9.Chen D.W. Swenson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32120-32130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR was carried out using Vent DNA polymerase as specified by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Inc.). PCR products were purified using the Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification system as specified by the manufacturer (Promega) and then phosphorylated at the 5′ termini using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc.). T4 polynucleotide kinase was removed by phenol/chloroform extraction, and the DNA was concentrated by ethanol precipitation. PCR products were ligated to plasmid pKK223–3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been digested with the restriction enzymeSmaI and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase to remove the 5′ phosphate group. DNA from the ligation reaction was used to transform the E. coli strain TG1. The correct construct (pKKETF11) was verified by restriction analysis, and the genes encoding ETF were resequenced to ensure that spurious changes had not arisen during the amplification procedure. E. colistrain TG1 transformed with pKKETF11 and grown at 22 °C in 2 × TY medium (10 g of bactotryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl per 1 liter) produced ∼2.5 mg ETF per liter of late exponential phase culture. Improved expression was achieved by deleting the M. methylotrophus ribosome-binding site located before the ETF genes and replacing it with the ribosome-binding site found in the pKK223–3 expression vector. The deletion was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit supplied by Stratagene and oligonucleotides 3 (5′ CAC ACA GGA AAC AGA ATT CAT GAA GAT ATT AGT GGC AG 3′) and 4 (5′ CTG CCA CTA ATA TCT TCA TGA ATT CTG TTT CCT GTG TG 3′). To ensure that no spurious changes had arisen as a result of the mutagenesis reaction, the entire ETF gene was resequenced using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech T7 sequencing kit and protocols. Recombinant ETF was expressed from the new plasmid (pED1) in the E. colistrain TG1 at 20 °C on 2 × TY medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml timentin. The protein was purified in large quantities (∼30 mg/liter of late exponential phase culture) as described by Chen and Swenson (9.Chen D.W. Swenson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32120-32130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ETF is purified in the reduced (anionic semiquinone) form. Oxidized ETF for x-ray scattering studies was obtained by treatment with potassium ferricyanide followed by rapid gel filtration (Sephadex 25) to remove excess oxidant. Oxidized protein was used immediately in scattering experiments after gel filtration and dilution (for concentration-dependent scattering experiments). UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded before and after x-ray exposure for samples in both oxidation states to ensure that no x-ray-dependent redox change occurred. This also allowed the concentration of ETF samples to be determined using the absorption at 438 nm (ε438 = 11,300m−1 cm−1) (7.Steenkamp D.J. Gallup M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4086-4089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SAXS experiments were performed with protein concentrations between 0.3 and 15 mg/ml. X-ray solution scattering data were collected in two sessions with the low angle scattering camera on station 2.1 (20.Towns-Andrews E. Berry A. Bordas J. Mant P.K. Murray K. Roberts K. Sumner I. Morgan J.S. Lewis R. Gabriel A. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1989; 60: 2346-2349Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar) at the Synchotron Radiation Source, Daresbury, UK using a position-sensitive multiwire proportional counter (21.Lewis R.R. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 1994; 1: 43-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the sample-to-detector distance of 2.4 m and the x-ray wavelength of λ = 1.54 Å, a momentum transfer interval of 0.002 Å−1 ≤ s ≤ 0.050 Å−1 was covered. The modulus of the momentum transfer is defined as s = 2 sin Θ/λ, where 2Θ is the scattering angle. The s range was calibrated using an oriented specimen of wet rat tail collagen (based on a diffraction spacing of 670 Å). Samples were contained in a brass cell holding a teflon ring sandwiched by two mica windows that defines a sample volume of 120 μl and a thickness of 1.5 mm. The brass cell was maintained at 4 °C during data acquisition. Buffer and sample were measured in alteration, each in a frame of 60 s (amounting to a total measuring time of up to 30 min depending on sample concentration and changes monitored on-line during experiments). Reduction and analysis of scattering data were performed as described previously (18.Grossmann J.G. Crawley J.B. Strange R.W. Patel K.J. Murphy L.M. Neu M. Evans R.W. Hasnain S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The radius of gyration (Rg), the forward scattering intensity (Io), and the intraparticle distance distribution function p(r) were calculated from the experimental scattering data using the indirect Fourier transform method as implemented in the program GNOM (22.Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Relative Io /c values (c = sample concentration) give the relative molecular weight of the protein samples when referenced against a suitable standard (bovine serum albumin was used with a known molecular mass of 66 kDa). The maximum linear dimension (D max) of the particle can be evaluated because of the characteristic ofp(r). The volume (V) of the particle can be calculated from the Porod invariant (23.Porod G. Kolloid Z. 1951; 124: 83-114Crossref Scopus (1537) Google Scholar) and a correction factor taking into account the limited experimental scattering range (15.Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small-Angle X-Ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1987Crossref Google Scholar). The multipole expansion method proposed by Stuhrmann (24.Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1970; 26: 297-306Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and developed by Svergun et al. (16.Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Stuhrmann H.B. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 798-802Crossref Google Scholar) was used to obtain the molecular shape of ETF. The smoothed scattering profile of reduced ETF was fittedab initio by the scattering from an envelope function starting from an ellipsoidal initial approximation (consistent with the experimental Rg and D maxvalues). The molecular shape was characterized with spherical harmonics using 19 free parameters (4th order harmonics), which is acceptable given the minor differences compared with the shape obtained for 3rd order harmonics (10 free parameters) and considering the information content in the data used. To take advantage of the already existing structural knowledge for this three-domain protein, scattering data simulations were carried out using atomic models of the structure of M. methylotrophusETF (produced by homology modeling based on the crystal structure coordinates of human ETF (3.Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar)) in free solution and in the conformation expected when in complex with TMADH (14.Chohan K.K. Scrutton N.S. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Pept. Lett. 1998; 5: 231-236Google Scholar). Parameters and scattering curves were computed from the model coordinates using the program CRYSOL (25.Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2743) Google Scholar), which also considers the hydration shell of the solvated protein. The solution scattering curves and intraparticle distance distributions for the oxidized and semiquinone forms of M. methylotrophus ETF are shown in Fig.2 A. The figure clearly demonstrates the very close similarity between the scattering profiles for the oxidized and semiquinone forms of the protein. The concentration-dependent low angle scattering region (s ≤ 0.01 Å−1) and radii of gyration are emphasized in Fig. 2 B. The intensity of the scattering profiles at low scattering angles was found to increase as a function of [ETF] for both the oxidized and semiquinone forms of the protein, revealing interparticle interactions. Hence low concentration (≤ 2 mg/ml) measurements were crucial. CarefulI0 analysis established that both forms of ETF behaved as a heterodimeric protein (∼60 kDa) in solution, and aggregation effects and/or radiation damage may have been induced during x-ray exposure (after examination of data collected in time frames). The Rg values obtained by extrapolation to zero concentration for oxidized and semiquinone ETF are virtually identical (26.6 ± 0.4 Å and 26.5 ± 0.4 Å, respectively). Furthermore, the maximum linear dimension and volume of both ETF states revealed equivalent values within error limits (x = 80 Å ± 4%, V = 110,000 Å3 ± 5%). This illustrated that no large conformational transformation had occurred as a result of changing the redox state of ETF. Moreover, thep(r) function with a characteristic shoulder at 40 Å indicates a spread-out, Y-shaped conformation (with distinct domain features) rather than a compact, globular structure. The structure of M. methylotrophus ETF has previously been modeled in two conformations (14.Chohan K.K. Scrutton N.S. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Pept. Lett. 1998; 5: 231-236Google Scholar). The first conformation (eT-inactive) was obtained from modeling studies in which the structure of M. methylotrophus ETF was built by homology using the crystal coordinates of human ETF (Fig.3 A). The second conformation (eT-active) is that obtained by rotating domain II by 50° with respect to domains I and III such that it produces a complementary fit with the ETF-binding site (26.Wilson E.K. Huang L. Sutcliffe M.J. Mathews F.S. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) seen in the crystal structure of TMADH (27.Lim L.W. Shamala N. Mathews F.S. Steenkamp D.J. Hamlin R. Xuong N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15140-15146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). Using the molecular coordinates for these models, simulated x-ray scattering profiles were generated for each solvated ETF conformer and fitted against the experimental scattering data for M. methylotrophus ETF (Fig. 3 C). The experimental scattering profile for M. methylotrophus ETF does not match agreeably with the simulated profile generated from the structural model for the eT-inactive conformation, which was based on the crystal structure of human ETF. Significant differences in the low angle (s ≤ 0.01 Å−1) and intermediate angle (0.017 Å−1 ≤s ≤ 0.025 Å−1) range result only in a fit with χeT-inactive2 = 2.2 (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, a good fit (χeT-active2 = 1.5) is obtained for the eT-active conformation of M. methylotrophus ETF, which is also reflected in the agreement of calculated and experimental radii of gyration. A good fit (χnew eT-inactive2 = 1.6) is also obtained for the simulated scattering profile of a model of M. methylotrophus ETF in which domain II is rotated 50° toward domain III. The smoothed experimental scattering profile for reducedM. methylotrophus ETF was used to calculate an ab initio low resolution molecular envelope structure for the protein. Molecular shape calculations were carried out up to 4th order harmonics, assuming that the molecule incorporates no axes of symmetry. In all calculations performed, the protein envelope consists of three apparent “domains,” with two of these domains forming a lobed, globular structure on top of which the third domain, a flattened ellipsoid, sits. The theoretical scattering calculated from the restored envelope is given in Fig. 2 as a dotted line (the fit resulted in a residual value of 1.9%). Fig. 4represents the average molecular envelope taking into account several calculations starting from different initial shapes. Manual fitting of the molecular models of M. methylotrophus ETF into this molecular envelope structure resulted in an excellent fit between domains I and III of the model with the two globular domains forming the base of the molecular envelope. With domains I and III of the model fitted to the envelope structure in this orientation, domain II of the model sits at the center of the third domain of the envelope structure, with the latter forming a flattened “halo” around the domain. Previous studies have established that there are spectral changes associated with the binding of oxidized ETF to TMADH (12.Jang M.-H. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12546-12552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These spectral changes, coupled with the ability to reduce ETF to the 2-electron level when in complex with TMADH, were taken as evidence for a structural reorganization of ETF (i.e. induced fit) during complex assembly. The SAXS profiles for both the oxidized and semiquinone forms are very similar, indicating that the solution structure of ETF in both redox states is similar. Difference spectroscopy studies of ETF·TMADH complex assembly with semiquinone ETF also revealed major spectral perturbation (Fig. 5), consistent with both redox forms of ETF undergoing conformational change during complex assembly. It was initially thought that the oxidation state of M. methylotrophus ETF may play a role in the predisposition of the protein to be in either the eT-active or the eT-inactive conformation and that the redox state of the protein would act as a switch between the different conformational states. However, the scattering data indicate that this is not the case, because the SAXS profiles for both oxidized and semiquinone ETF are practically indistinguishable, indicating essentially identical molecular conformations in solution. The fitted experimental SAXS profile for M. methylotrophusETF closely resembled the simulated profile for the eT-active rather than the eT-inactive conformation of ETF, initially leading us to believe that the conformation of M. methylotrophus ETF in solution resembles that of the postulated eT-active form. With regard to protein function, however, it would be unexpected and certainly less beneficial if the protein existed predominantly in its active conformation regardless of its redox state. It would be less beneficial for ETF to exist predominantly in its active confirmation because in the eT-active conformation the isoalloxazine ring is highly exposed, rendering it susceptible to oxidative attack (by molecular oxygen) in the semiquinone redox state. Intriguingly, as a result of the pseudo-symmetry of domains I and III in the M. methylotrophus ETF model, domain II can be rotated by 50° in the direction of domain III. This is contrary to the direction of rotation in converting from the eT-inactive to eT-active conformations (where the rotation is by 50° in the direction of domain I). In terms of the low resolution molecular shape it would be difficult to distinguish between the form of ETF in which the rotation of domain II is toward domain III and the predicted eT-active form (i.e. in which the rotation is toward domain I). Indeed the simulated scattering profile of a model of M. methylotrophus ETF (in which domain II is rotated 50° toward domain III) is as good as the simulated profile for the model of eT-active ETF (Fig. 3 C). The fit to the experimental data results in a χ2 value of 1.6. This additional model for eT-inactive M. methylotrophus ETF (i.e. rotation toward domain III) represents a more “closed” conformation, with the FAD embedded in the interface between domains II and III. However, it is difficult to consider that the protein acts like a conformational switch by going from this more closed, inactive conformation to the eT-active conformation upon oxidation (even though our SAXS results alone cannot completely exclude this possibility). We suggest, not least in view of our spectroscopic studies, that M. methylotrophus ETF may continuously sample this more closed eT-inactive conformation and the eT-active conformation and in doing so also populates other conformations between these two extremes. Such flexibility may account for the difficulties associated with crystallizing M. methylotrophus ETF. Therefore, the uniformity of the observed SAXS profiles (bearing in mind that the scattering measurements represent a time average) for oxidized and semiquinone M. methylotrophus ETF would indicate that this motion is independent of the redox state of ETF. The continuous sampling of a range of conformations between the extremes discussed above is in harmony with the molecular envelope ofM. methylotrophus ETF restored from the experimental SAXS profile. Had there been a sizeable energy barrier between the two extreme conformations (leading to a “flipping” from the eT-inactive to an eT-active conformation and vice versa) one would expect to observe a more triangular molecular envelope structure. This arises because domain II of the model would have to be located adjacent to one or the other of the domains (domains I and III) that form the globular base of the molecule. However, the calculated molecular envelope forms a flattened halo around the locus of domain II of the model. The fit between the molecular envelope structure and domains I and III of the ETF model is clear-cut. Also, domain II of ETF cannot occupy all areas of its corresponding halo simultaneously. Combined, these factors concerning the molecular shape can be taken as evidence to indicate that M. methylotrophus ETF is sampling a range of conformations in solution. In so doing, domain II rotates freely about the axis formed by the polypeptide hinges connecting it to domains I and III. The molecular envelope structure thus represents an average conformation for M. methylotrophus ETF in solution, describing the range of positions occupied by domain II relative to domains I and III. Furthermore, because the halo surrounding domain II of the M. methylotrophus ETF model is flattened in the direction of rotation, it indicates that movement of domain II with respect to domains I and III occurs mainly in one dimension, with very little “side to side” movement. The experimental SAXS data can now be used to refine the original model of domain motion in M. methylotrophus ETF proposed on the basis of homology with the human ETF structure (14.Chohan K.K. Scrutton N.S. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Pept. Lett. 1998; 5: 231-236Google Scholar). Rather than activation of the ETF·TMADH electron transfer complex being associated with a simple 50° rotation of one of the domains of ETF (i.e. a discrete transition from an eT-inactive to an eT-active conformation) as originally proposed, complex formation stabilizes the eT-active conformation of ETF. During complex formation, the highly dynamic nature of ETF is transiently “frozen” in forming the eT-active conformation. This suppression of the ETF dynamics is achieved by an induced fit mechanism for the interaction of ETF with TMADH. Finally, it is also worth commenting on the comparison between structures of ETF in solution and solid state. Although no crystal structure of M. methylotrophus ETF has been reported yet, atomic structures of the related human and P. denitrificansprotein (3.Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4.Roberts D.L. Salazar D. Fulmer J.P. Frerman F.E. Kim J.-J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1977-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) can be considered as close structural templates. It is therefore interesting to note that the distinct conformation of domain II with respect to domains I and III in the crystalline state (which has been denoted as the eT-inactive state) is in clear contrast to our findings in solution. A close inspection of the molecular arrangements in the crystalline lattice of the two known ETF structures reveals in both cases several close contacts of domain II with domains from neighboring molecules. It is the low energy non-covalent interactions that can effectively influence conformations, particularly in the case of multidomain proteins. Consequently, the crystal packing forces arising from non-covalent bonds are likely to alter or stabilize certain domain orientations. Considering human ETF, structural flexibility would indeed be an asset because the protein has to recognize a whole range of different redox partners suggestive of different protein-protein interactions and docking conformations. By having a dynamic interface this recognition might be achieved more readily. The present study is a good illustration of how crystal structures can be compared with structures investigated under close physiological conditions, i.e. in solution (such as using the solution x-ray scattering technique)."

In the frog Xenopus , the steroid hormone progesterone is the prince that awakens the oocyte, activating a signaling pathway that enables the oocyte to reenter the cell cycle and to mature into a sperm-responsive egg. Exactly how progesterone awakens the sleeping oocyte (see the figure) is not clear, but a recent report from Richter, Ruderman and their colleagues ([1][1]) reveals that an elaborate cast of characters helps progesterone in its quest.

Slumbering oocytes contain large stockpiles of ribosomes and mRNAs that encode proteins vital for oocyte maturation and for early development of the embryo after fertilization. Unlike mRNAs in somatic cells, which carry long tails of polyadenylic acid [poly(A)] and are readily translated into protein, these mRNAs have short, stubby poly(A) tails and are not translated. In response to gonadotrophin hormones, follicle cells surrounding the oocyte release progesterone, which binds to an unidentified receptor on the oocyte surface. This results in a rapid decrease in adenylyl cyclase activity, cyclic AMP levels and protein kinase A activity. But the next steps in the signaling pathway that awakens the oocyte are still shrouded in mystery.

Earlier work by the Ruderman group ([2][3]) on frog oocytes (favored because of their accessibility and large size) reported that activation of c-mos mRNA—which encodes the protein kinase Mos, a key component of the MAP kinase signaling pathway—required Eg2 (a serine/threonine kinase of the Aurora family). The researchers found that within 30 minutes of progesterone stimulation, Eg2 became activated through acquisition of a phosphate group (phosphorylation) and then somehow elicited the translation of c-mos mRNA into Mos, with subsequent activation of the MAP kinase signaling cascade. This cascade culminates in the activation of M-phase promoting factor (a complex of cyclin B and cdc2), leading to breakdown of the nuclear envelope and reentry of the oocyte into the cell cycle.

But exactly how does Eg2 elicit translation of c-mos mRNA? The Ruderman and Richter groups already knew the identity of the key character in the next chapter of the Aurora story: the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding factor (CPEB). In their new work ([1][1]), they discovered that CPEB was phosphorylated at a single site (serine-174) soon after progesterone stimulation but before translation of c-mos mRNA; phosphorylation of other CPEB sites occurred much later and depended on Mos activity. The investigators then demonstrated that Eg2 was responsible for the early phosphorylation of CPEB on serine-174, and that this in turn promoted the addition of a long poly(A) tail onto c-mos mRNA, resulting in its translation. They suggested that the later Mos-dependent phosphorylation of CPEB might result in its degradation, its task now being complete.

Next, the investigators plan to nail down the identity of the elusive oocyte progesterone receptor, discover the components that connect the receptor to the protein that activates Eg2, and find out how early phosphorylation of CPEB results in recruitment of the enzyme that adds a long poly(A) tail onto c-mos mRNA.
