https://openalex.org/W2053003053,"RNA transcripts are subject to posttranscriptional gene regulation involving hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes (miRNPs) expressed in a cell-type dependent fashion. We developed a cell-based crosslinking approach to determine at high resolution and transcriptome-wide the binding sites of cellular RBPs and miRNPs. The crosslinked sites are revealed by thymidine to cytidine transitions in the cDNAs prepared from immunopurified RNPs of 4-thiouridine-treated cells. We determined the binding sites and regulatory consequences for several intensely studied RBPs and miRNPs, including PUM2, QKI, IGF2BP1-3, AGO/EIF2C1-4 and TNRC6A-C. Our study revealed that these factors bind thousands of sites containing defined sequence motifs and have distinct preferences for exonic versus intronic or coding versus untranslated transcript regions. The precise mapping of binding sites across the transcriptome will be critical to the interpretation of the rapidly emerging data on genetic variation between individuals and how these variations contribute to complex genetic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2106391833,"Accumulating evidence implicates heterogeneity within cancer cell populations in the response to stressful exposures, including drug treatments. While modeling the acute response to various anticancer agents in drug-sensitive human tumor cell lines, we consistently detected a small subpopulation of reversibly ""drug-tolerant"" cells. These cells demonstrate >100-fold reduced drug sensitivity and maintain viability via engagement of IGF-1 receptor signaling and an altered chromatin state that requires the histone demethylase RBP2/KDM5A/Jarid1A. This drug-tolerant phenotype is transiently acquired and relinquished at low frequency by individual cells within the population, implicating the dynamic regulation of phenotypic heterogeneity in drug tolerance. The drug-tolerant subpopulation can be selectively ablated by treatment with IGF-1 receptor inhibitors or chromatin-modifying agents, potentially yielding a therapeutic opportunity. Together, these findings suggest that cancer cell populations employ a dynamic survival strategy in which individual cells transiently assume a reversibly drug-tolerant state to protect the population from eradication by potentially lethal exposures."

Here, we present the crystal structure of p120 isoform 4A in complex with the JMD core region (JMD(core)) of E-cadherin. The p120 armadillo repeat domain contains modular binding pockets that are complementary to electrostatic and hydrophobic properties of the JMD(core). Single-residue mutations within the JMD(core)-binding site of p120 abolished its interaction with E- and N-cadherins in vitro and in cultured cells. These mutations of p120 enabled us to clearly differentiate between N-cadherin-dependent and -independent steps of neuronal dendritic spine morphogenesis crucial for synapse development. NMR studies revealed that p120 regulates the stability of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion by associating with the majority of the JMD, including residues implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and Hakai-dependent ubiquitination of E-cadherin, through its discrete ""dynamic"" and ""static"" binding sites."

Dysfunctional telomeres can elicit a persistent DNA damage signal Persistent DNA damage signaling causes endoreduplication in p53-deficient cells Bypass of mitosis, geminin degradation, and Cdt1 re-expression allow a 2nd S phase Tetraploidy resulting from this pathway may lead to cancer-associated aneuploidy Aneuploidy is a hallmark of solid human cancers. Diploid cells can acquire an aneuploid chromosome complement through repeated chromosome nondisjunction events (reviewed in Kops et al., 2005Kops G.J. Weaver B.A. Cleveland D.W. On the road to cancer: aneuploidy and the mitotic checkpoint.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). However, as many solid tumors have subtetraploid karyotypes and supernumerary centrosomes, it is likely that the initial step toward aneuploidy is tetraploidization (reviewed in Storchova and Kuffer, 2008Storchova Z. Kuffer C. The consequences of tetraploidy and aneuploidy.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3859-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Tetraploid cells, most likely because they can form multipolar spindles, have a high rate of chromosome missegregation, explaining how tumors attain subtetraploid karyotypes in which some chromosomes are present at four copies whereas other chromosomes have a lower copy number. Tetraploidization has been observed in the early stages of colon cancer (Danes, 1978Danes B.S.

Three main mechanisms for tetraploidization in the context of human cancer have been proposed: cell fusion, a failure to complete mitosis (mitotic slippage), and a failure to complete cytokinesis (reviewed in Ganem et al., 2007Ganem N.J. Storchova Z. Pellman D. Tetraploidy, aneuploidy and cancer.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Here, we show that tetraploidization can occur in response to the loss of telomere protection, which is thought to be a common event in human tumorigenesis (reviewed in Maser and DePinho, 2002Maser R.S. DePinho R.A. Connecting chromosomes, crisis, and cancer.Science. 2002; 297: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The telomeres of most human somatic cells undergo progressive telomere shortening due to the repression of telomerase. This process eventually limits cellular proliferation through the induction of apoptosis or senescence and is thought to represent a tumor-suppressor mechanism that can be subverted by the activation of telomerase (Kim et al., 1994Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W.

Extension of life-span by introduction of telomerase into normal human cells.Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (3921) Google Scholar). In agreement, extreme telomere shortening is observed in the early stages of tumorigenesis before telomerase is activated (Chin et al., 2004Chin K. De Solorzano C.O. Knowles D. Jones A. Chou W. Rodriguez E.G. Kuo W.L. Ljung B.M. Chew K. Myambo K. et al.In situ analyses of genome instability in breast cancer.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Furthermore, most clinically relevant human tumors, including telomerase-positive tumors, have short telomeres that bear witness to the telomere shortening in their proliferative history (de Lange et al., 1990de Lange T. Shiue L. Myers R.M. Cox D.R. Naylor S.L. Killery A.M. Varmus H.E. Structure and variability of human chromosome ends.Mol. Cell.

Thus, many human cancers might experience an episode of diminished chromosome-end protection during their development. Telomeres that have become dysfunctional after extensive shortening activate the canonical DNA damage signaling pathways, mediated by the ATM and ATR kinases (d'Adda di Fagagna et al., 2003d'Adda di Fagagna F. Reaper P.M. Clay-Farrace L. Fiegler H. Carr P. Von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Carter N.P. Jackson S.P. A DNA damage checkpoint response in telomere-initiated senescence.Nature. 2003; 426: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar). At functional telomeres, ATM signaling is repressed by the shelterin component TRF2, whereas the single-stranded telomeric DNA-binding protein POT1 blocks the activation of the ATR kinase (Denchi and de Lange, 2007Denchi E.L. de Lange T. Protection of telomeres through independent control of ATM and ATR by TRF2 and POT1.Nature. 2007; 448: 1068-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In the current study, telomere dysfunction is experimentally induced in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) that contain floxed alleles of the two mouse POT1 genes, POT1a and POT1b (Hockemeyer et al., 2006Hockemeyer D. Daniels J.P. Takai H. de Lange T. Recent expansion of the telomeric complex in rodents: Two distinct POT1 proteins protect mouse telomeres.Cell. 2006; 126: 63-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Depletion of POT1a/b induces an ATR kinase response that leads to accumulation of DNA damage factors at chromosome ends and activation of the effector kinases Chk1 and Chk2 (Denchi and de Lange, 2007Denchi E.L. de Lange T. Protection of telomeres through independent control of ATM and ATR by TRF2 and POT1.Nature. 2007; 448: 1068-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). This DNA damage response is persistent because the repair of the damaged telomeres by NHEJ is repressed by TRF2, which remains associated with telomeres despite the removal of POT1a and -b (Hockemeyer et al., 2006Hockemeyer D. Daniels J.P. Takai H. de Lange T. Recent expansion of the telomeric complex in rodents: Two distinct POT1 proteins protect mouse telomeres.Cell. 2006; 126: 63-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). When POT1a/b are deleted from MEFs that lack a functional p53 pathway, the cells undergo polyploidization, resulting in 4n, 8n, and 16n DNA content (Hockemeyer et al., 2006Hockemeyer D. Daniels J.P. Takai H. de Lange T. Recent expansion of the telomeric complex in rodents: Two distinct POT1 proteins protect mouse telomeres.Cell. 2006; 126: 63-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The FACS profile of these cultures shows discrete peaks suggesting that the whole genome is duplicated. Furthermore, the occasional metaphase spreads obtained from POT1a/b DKO cultures show diplo- and quadruplochromosomes indicating that these cells have undergone two or three rounds of DNA replication without resolution of the centromeric cohesin. Here, we document the consequences of telomere dysfunction in this setting and demonstrate that bypass of mitosis and endoreduplication are induced by the persistent DNA damage signal emanating from permanently damaged telomeres. The two mouse POT1 proteins were removed from telomeres through Cre-mediated gene deletion in POT1aF/-POT1bF/FMEFs, resulting in POT1a/b double knockout (DKO) cells. These and other cells used in this study are permissive for polyploidization because p53, which can block entry into S phase in tetraploid cells (Carder et al., 1993Carder P. Wyllie A.H. Purdie C.A.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1315-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), is repressed by SV40 Large T antigen (SV40LT). As expected, POT1a/b DKO cells showed a DNA damage response and polyploidization characterized by FACS profiles with discrete 8n and 16n peaks (Figures 1A–1C and Figure S1A available online). The polyploid cell fraction (defined here as the fraction of cells with a DNA content >4n) increases from a basal level of 7% to 8% to 35% to 40% at day 6 after POT1a/b deletion (Figures 1A and 1C) and the cells accumulated supernumerary centrosomes (Figure S1B). To determine whether this polyploidization was due to a DNA damage signal, we generated SV40LT-immortalized POT1aF/-POT1bF/FATM−/− MEFs and treated the cells with an shRNA to ATR (Figures 1D–1F). Littermate-derived, SV40LT-immortalized POT1aF/-POT1bF/FATM+/− MEFs infected with the shRNA vector served as a control. Inhibition of ATM and ATR diminished the phosphorylation of Chk1 and Chk2 and decreased the induction of polyploidy in response to POT1a/b deletion (Figures 1D–1F). Consistent with the ATR kinase being primarily responsible for the DNA damage signal in POT1a/b DKO cells, inhibition of ATR alone strongly reduced the fraction of polyploid cells (Figures S1C and S1D). ATR knockdown did not affect DNA replication per se (Figure S1E). Polyploidization was also diminished by knockdown of Chk1 and Chk2 (Figures 1G–1I) or treatment with UCN01 (Figures S1F and S1G). These data establish that a DNA-damage signaling cascade involving ATM/ATR and Chk1/Chk2 is required for polyploidization in response to telomere dysfunction.Figure S1Polyploidy Due to Persistent DNA Damage Signaling, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Immunoblotting showing POT1a/b deletion and Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylation in POT1aF/-POT1bF/F MEFs after introduction of Cre.(B) Supernumerary centrosomes in POT1a/b DKO cells.

Average values from two independent experiments with SD are shown. The telomere damage in the POT1a/b DKO cells is not efficiently repaired and therefore elicits a DNA damage signal that persists. A persistent DNA damage signal due to unrepaired telomere damage also occurs when TRF2 is deleted from Lig4−/− (NHEJ-deficient) cells (Celli and de Lange, 2005Celli G.B. de Lange T. DNA processing not required for ATM-mediated telomere damage response after TRF2 deletion.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Consistent with the data on POT1a/b DKO cells, the Lig4/TRF2-deficient cells showed polyploidization and diplochromosomes, although the magnitude of the phenotype was less (Figures S1H and S1I). To further test the idea that polyploidization occurs when a DNA damage signal persists, we monitored the effects of continuous treatment with the DSB-inducing agent, zeocin. The zeocin concentration used induced the same level of DNA damage as deletion of POT1a/b (Figure 1B). Cells treated with zeocin showed a polyploid FACS profile characterized by discrete 8n and 16n peaks (Figures 1A and 1C). Zeocin-mediated induction of polyploidy was strongly impaired when either ATR/ATM or Chk1/Chk2 were inhibited (Figures 1D–1I). The absence of ATM, which transduces the initial response to the DSBs, had a stronger effect than knockdown of ATR (Figures S1C and S1D). Polyploidy was also induced by continuous treatment with doxorubicin or bleomycin, and by repeated UV irradiation (Figures S1J–S1L). Moreover, tetraploidization was induced by overexpression of the ATR-activating domain of TopBP1 (Figure S1J). Since this TopBP1 domain has been shown to activate ATR in the absence of DNA lesions (Toledo et al., 2008Toledo L.I. Murga M. Gutierrez-Martinez P. Soria R. Fernandez-Capetillo O. ATR signaling can drive cells into senescence in the absence of DNA breaks.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), this result argues that DNA damage signaling rather than the DNA lesions themselves causes polyploidization. DNA damage-induced polyploidization was not a peculiarity of mouse cells, as prolonged zeocin treatment of HPV-E6/E7-transformed human BJ fibroblasts also resulted in tetraploidy (Figures S1M and S1N). Furthermore, the polyploidization was not due to the expression of viral oncoproteins since it occurred in zeocin-treated p53−/− MEFs (Figure S1O) and in TRF2−/−Lig4−/−p53−/− MEFs (Figure S1I). In contrast, primary MEFs and BJ fibroblasts with an intact p53 pathway showed the expected G1/S arrest in response to DNA damage (data not shown). Metaphase spreads from POT1a/b DKO cells show diplo- and quadruplochromosomes, indicating that the cells undergo two rounds of whole genome duplication without intervening destruction of the centromeric cohesin. Cohesin is normally degraded when the APC/Cdc20 ubiquitin ligase is activated at the onset of anaphase. We therefore monitored the status of mitotic targets of the APC/Cdc20 in synchronized POT1a/b DKO cells (Figure 2A ). Upon release from a G1/S block, both control and POT1a/b DKO cells entered S phase, as shown by BrdU incorporation. However, POT1a/b DKO cells progressed into S-phase somewhat slower (Figure 2B) and did not divide in the 10 hr time period (Figure 2A). Each of the nine APC targets tested, including securin, which protects cohesin from degradation by separase, were abnormally stabilized in POT1a/b DKO cells (Figure 2A). In contrast, CyclinE, a target of the SCF ubiquitin ligase, was degraded with normal kinetics in POT1a/b DKO cells (Figure 2A). We next analyzed the activity of Cdk1/CyclinB, which is required for entry into mitosis and contributes to the activation of the APC/Cdc20 (reviewed in Peters, 2002Peters J.M. The anaphase-promoting complex: proteolysis in mitosis and beyond.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Cdk1/CyclinB activation can be blocked by ATM/ATR kinase signaling through Chk1/Chk2-mediated inactivation of the Cdc25 phosphatases, which remove inhibitory phosphates from Tyr14/15 of Cdk1. The Cdk1/CyclinB activity in synchronized POT1a/b DKO cells was ∼4-fold lower than in the control and phosphorylation of Tyr14/15 was increased (Figures 2C and 2D). Furthermore, the Cdk1/CyclinB kinase activity remained low for at least 6 days after POT1a/b deletion and during 72 hr of zeocin treatment (Figure S2A). In contrast, the Cdk2/CyclinE activity was not obviously altered (Figure 2E). Knockdown of Chk1 and Chk2 in POT1a/b DKO cells resulted in an increase in Cdk1/CyclinB activity and the phosphorylation of Tyr14/15 was diminished (Figures 2D and 2F). In addition, when Chk1 and Chk2 were inhibited with shRNAs or UCN01, the level of several APC/Cdc20 targets decreased (Figure 2D and Figure S2B), suggesting that APC/Cdc20 was more active. To further analyze the altered cell cycles, we used time-lapse live-cell imaging of asynchronously growing POT1a/b DKO cells and zeocin-treated cells. During the 2 day imaging session, a fraction of the cells became polyploid, whereas control cells divided normally and remained diploid (Figure 3A , Figure S3, and Movie S1). On average, each cell in the control cultures went through mitosis twice whereas 72% of the POT1a/b DKO cells and 86% of the zeocin-treated cells did not divide during the imaging period (Figures 3A and 3B and Movie S1). Furthermore, neither the POT1a/b DKO cells, nor the zeocin-treated cells showed nuclear envelope breakdown or chromosome condensation as deduced from H2B-GFP expressing cells (data not shown). In comparison with control cells, POT1a/b DKO and zeocin-treated cells became large and flattened, displaying a senescent-like phenotype. The POT1a/b DKO cells and zeocin-treated cells showed an ∼2-fold increase in the nuclear area during the imaging period (p < 0.001; Figure 3C), consistent with their increased DNA content. We also monitored POT1a/b DKO and zeocin-treated cells expressing a CyclinE-eGFP fusion. Although the CyclinE-eGFP signals were hard to discern, ∼35% of the cells showed two waves of CyclinE-eGFP without intervening mitosis over a 2 day period (Figure 3B and Movie S2).Figure S3Polyploidization during Live-Cell Imaging, Related to Figure 3Show full captionFACS profiles of cells used in the live-cell imaging shown in Figure 3A at the beginning (t = 0 hr) and at the end (t = 48 hr) of the imaging session.

Percentage of polyploid cells is shown. The ability of POT1a/b DKO cells to enter S phase without progression through mitosis was unexpected as the initiation of DNA replication requires degradation of the DNA replication inhibitor geminin (reviewed in Blow and Dutta, 2005Blow J.J. Dutta A. Preventing re-replication of chromosomal DNA.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Geminin, an inhibitor of the replication initiation factor Cdt1, is normally degraded at the end of mitosis. Degradation of geminin allows Cdt1, which rises in G1, to license replication origins. Once DNA replication is initiated, Cdt1 is degraded by SCF. In addition, geminin rises in S/G2, thereby blocking Cdt1 from relicensing of replication origins. This alternating expression of Cdt1 and geminin ensures that cells execute only one round of DNA replication per cell division cycle, a rule that is broken by endoreduplicating cells. To examine the fluctuations of geminin and Cdt1, we used Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator (FUCCI, [Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008Sakaue-Sawano A. Kurokawa H. Morimura T. Hanyu A.

PlGF induces responses in endothelial, malignant, immune, and other cells and binds to Flt1 (Fischer et al., 2008Fischer C. Mazzone M. Jonckx B. Carmeliet P.

Although Flt1 may act as a trap for VEGF, it also transmits signals in response to PlGF via its tyrosine kinase (TK) domains (Landgren et al., 1998Landgren E. Schiller P. Cao Y. Claesson-Welsh L. Placenta growth factor stimulates MAP kinase and mitogenicity but not phospholipase C-gamma and migration of endothelial cells expressing Flt 1.Oncogene. 1998; 16: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The role of Flt1 in cancer remains controversial, but most studies report that Flt1 inhibition/silencing reduces tumor growth in preclinical models. In mice expressing Flt1 without TK activity (Flt1-TK−/−), tumor growth and metastasis are inhibited (Hiratsuka et al., 2002Hiratsuka S. Nakamura K. Iwai S. Murakami M. Itoh T. Kijima H. Shipley J.M.

Jain R.K. Down-regulation of placenta growth factor by promoter hypermethylation in human lung and colon carcinoma.Mol. Cancer Res. 2007; 5: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). PlGF levels are upregulated in cancer patients treated with VEGF inhibitors (Willett et al., 2005Willett C.G. Boucher Y. Duda D.G. di Tomaso E. Munn L.L. Tong R.T. Kozin S.V. Petit L. Jain R.K.

Clin. Oncol. 2005; 23: 8136-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Moreover, PlGF expression in tumor or stroma promotes cancer (Marcellini et al., 2006Marcellini M. De Luca N. Riccioni T. Ciucci A. Orecchia A. Lacal P.M. Ruffini F. Pesce M. Cianfarani F. Zambruno G. et al.Increased melanoma growth and metastasis spreading in mice overexpressing placenta growth factor.Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 643-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We showed that the anti-PlGF monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5D11D4 slows tumor growth in preclinical models, in part by blocking angiogenesis and inflammation (Fischer et al., 2007Fischer C. Jonckx B. Mazzone M. Zacchigna S. Loges S. Pattarini L. Chorianopoulos E. Liesenborghs L. Koch M.

However, anti-PlGF mAbs generated by Bais et al. were ineffective in mouse tumor models (Bais et al., 2010Bais C. Wu X. Yao J. Yang S. Crawford Y. McCutcheon K. Tan C. Koluman G. Vernes J.-M.

Haughney P. et al.PlGF blockade does not inhibit angiogenesis during primary tumor growth.Cell. 2010; 141 (this issue): 166-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), questioning whether the activity of 5D11D4 could be reproduced by independently generated anti-PlGF mAbs. Also, issues were raised about the dose and whether the effects of 5D11D4 were related to off-target activity. Furthermore, Bais et al. argued that insufficient genetic evidence supported a role for PlGF in cancer, overall questioning the therapeutic value of anti-PlGF strategies (Bais et al., 2010Bais C. Wu X. Yao J. Yang S. Crawford Y. McCutcheon K. Tan C. Koluman G. Vernes J.-M. Easthma-Anderson J.

Here, we provide genetic evidence for a disease-candidate role of PlGF and underscore the potential of anti-PlGF therapy in cancer by using complementary genetic and pharmacological tools to eliminate, silence, or inhibit PlGF in spontaneous tumor models. We also characterized via which underlying mechanisms loss/inhibition of PlGF blocked tumorigenesis. To obtain independent confirmation, other groups than those involved in our original study (Fischer et al., 2007Fischer C. Jonckx B. Mazzone M. Zacchigna S. Loges S. Pattarini L. Chorianopoulos E. Liesenborghs L. Koch M. De Mol M. et al.Anti-PlGF inhibits growth of VEGF(R)-inhibitor-resistant tumors without affecting healthy vessels.Cell. 2007; 131: 463-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) contributed autonomously. We first explored whether loss of PlGF inhibits growth and angiogenesis in a carcinogen-induced skin epithelial tumor model. PlGF levels were low in healthy skin, acutely upregulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (pg/mg: 13 ± 1 for control versus 55 ± 6 after PMA; n = 12–6; p < 0.005), and chronically elevated in small and large papillomas (pg/mg: 145 ± 49 and 192 ± 18; n = 5; p < 0.001). Formation of skin papillomas and associated neovessels was delayed in PlGF−/− mice (Figures 1A–1D ). The average latency after the first PMA application was 3 weeks longer in PlGF−/− mice, and by 20 weeks, 94% of wild-type (WT) mice but only 59% of PlGF−/− mice developed tumors (Figures 1E and 1F). PlGF−/− mice formed 66% fewer papillomas per mouse. Similar effects were observed for large papillomas (>3 mm). In PlGF−/− mice, the first large papilloma developed 4 weeks later than in WT mice (Figures 1G and 1H). At 20 weeks, the incidence of large papillomas was 50% in WT mice but only 29% in PlGF−/− mice, and the number of large papillomas per mouse was decreased by 80%. Loss of PlGF impaired the growth of neovessels in healthy skin around the tumors (Figures 1B and 1D). Within papillomas, PlGF deficiency did not affect vessel densities but reduced their size by 65% and 55% in small and large papillomas, respectively (n = 5; p < 0.05), whereas the accumulation of macrophages, mast cells, or T cells was not affected (not shown). To extend the genetic evidence for a role of PlGF in cancer, we also sought additional pharmacological evidence for a therapeutic potential of anti-PlGF in cancer and therefore evaluated if the mouse anti-human PlGF mAb 16D3 (dissociation constant [KD] = 12 pM for human PlGF-1) could reproduce the anticancer activity of 5D11D4; this mAb was generated independently of 5D11D4 by immunizing PlGF−/− mice with human PlGF-2. Delivery of 16D3 dose-dependently elevated plasma 16D3 levels (Figure S1A available online). At 12.5 mg/kg, 2×/wk, 16D3 inhibited growth of MDA-MB-435 tumors in immunocompromised mice by 40% (mm3: 1670 ± 194 for control versus 998 ± 210 for 16D3; n = 12; p = 0.03). 16D3 also inhibited the growth of human pancreatic DanG xenografts (Figures S1B–S1D) and cancer-associated cachexia (loss in body weight: 14% in control versus 7% in 16D3; n = 9–10; p = 0.04). Both tumors produced human PlGF (pg/mg protein in tumor lysates: 19 ± 5 for MDA-MB-435; n = 12 and 103 ± 37 for DanG; n = 11). We then used two hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) models to characterize more extensively the effects and mechanisms of PlGF blockage. To exclude that germline PlGF deficiency induces compensatory changes that favor tumor inhibition independently, we tested whether conditional PlGF silencing inhibited growth of HCC. In the first model, transgenic expression of an SV40 T-antigen oncogene induced hyperplasia/dysplasia (4–8 weeks), nodular adenoma (12 weeks), and diffuse carcinoma (>16 weeks) (Dupuy et al., 2003Dupuy E. Hainaud P. Villemain A. Bodevin-Phedre E. Brouland J.P. Briand P. Tobelem G. Tumoral angiogenesis and tissue factor expression during hepatocellular carcinoma progression in a transgenic mouse model.J. Hepatol. 2003; 38: 793-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). PlGF was undetectable in healthy hepatocytes but apparent in HCC, whereas Flt1 was upregulated in macrophages, Kupffer cells, and vessels (not shown). By RT-PCR, PlGF transcripts were upregulated to 295% ± 28% of normal levels in adenomas (n = 4; p < 0.05). Hepatic PlGF was silenced by treating HCC mice from 8 to 15 weeks with PlGF-specific siRNA, reducing PlGF protein levels by 60% ± 8% (n = 5; p < 0.05). Despite incomplete PlGF silencing, hepatomegaly was reduced, with the largest inhibition when PlGF expression and macrophage infiltration were maximal (see below) (Figure 1I); fewer and smaller tumor nodules were present at 15 weeks (superficial nodules 0.5–1 cm and >1.0 cm: 12.7 ± 2.9 and 6.0 ± 0.7 in untreated versus 12.0 ± 1.4 and 4.7 ± 1.1 in control siRNA, and 1.0 ± 0.7 and 0 ± 0 in PlGF-specific siRNA, n = 3; p < 0.005; Figures 1J–1M). We also used a carcinogen-induced HCC model by treating mice with diethylnitrosamine (DEN), which causes fibrosis and dysplastic lesions at 16 weeks and hypervascularized tumors by 25 weeks. Hepatic PlGF levels were not acutely upregulated by DEN (not shown) and remained initially low (pg/mg: 2.9 ± 0.7 in healthy versus 1.5 ± 0.4 after 4 weeks DEN; n = 6; p = not significant [NS]) but increased to 423 ± 77 pg/mg in end-stage tumor nodules (n = 6; p < 0.05). After 30 weeks of DEN treatment, 58% of WT mice (n = 24) but only 5% of PlGF−/− mice (n = 21) succumbed (p = 0.002, log rank) and fewer tumor nodules were present in PlGF−/− mice (nodules/liver: 17.9 ± 2.2 in WT versus 5.9 ± 2.4 in PlGF−/−; n = 18; p = 0.002). When WT mice with established HCC were treated with 5D11D4 (20 mg/kg; 2×/wk) from 25 weeks onward for 5 weeks, 45% of mice receiving control IgG died whereas only 23% died in the 5D11D4 group (n = 23–25; p < 0.05). Also, 5D11D4-treated mice developed fewer nodules per liver (nodules, all sizes: 21.6 ± 2.9 after control IgG versus 11.1 ± 2.6 after 5D11D4; n = 15; p = 0.02). After 10 weeks of mAb treatment, mortality was 90% in the control group, but it was only 41% after 5D11D4 (n = 11; p < 0.05). In contrast to the largely portal venous blood supply in healthy livers, the hepatic arterial network expanded substantially in HCC (Figures 2A and 2B ), giving rise to the formation of unpaired arteries, i.e., large vessels with a mural coat of smooth muscle actin (SMA)+ cells that are not accompanied by a bile duct (Fernandez et al., 2009Fernandez M. Semela D. Bruix J. Colle I. Pinzani M. Bosch J. Angiogenesis in liver disease.J. Hepatol. 2009; 50: 604-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In the transgenic model, PlGF silencing abrogated arterialization, scored arteriographically (Figures 2C–2E) and histologically (lumen size of unpaired arteries: 293 ± 72 μm2 in ctrl-siRNA versus 70 ± 16 μm2 in PlGF-siRNA; n = 4; p < 0.05). In the DEN model, 5D11D4-treated HCC livers contained fewer and smaller unpaired arteries (SMA+ unpaired vessels: relative area in % of area analyzed and number/mm2: 5.8 ± 1.0 and 11.3 ± 2.9 after IgG versus 1.4 ± 0.3 and 6.3 ± 0.3 after 5D11D4; n = 7–3; p < 0.001 and p < 0.05; Figures 2F–2H). Within HCC nodules, PlGF blockage did not alter capillary density, when counting each branch or profile as a separate vessel (Figures S2A and S2B). However, given that hypoxia stimulates HCC growth (Wu et al., 2007Wu X.Z. Xie G.R. Chen D. Hypoxia and hepatocellular carcinoma: The therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma.J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2007; 22: 1178-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and that microvascular density does not always provide insight into vessel function (Mazzone et al., 2009Mazzone M. Dettori D. Leite de Oliveira R. Loges S. Schmidt T. Jonckx B. Tian Y.M. Lanahan A.A. Pollard P. Ruiz de Almodovar C. et al.Heterozygous deficiency of PHD2 restores tumor oxygenation and inhibits metastasis via endothelial normalization.Cell. 2009; 136: 839-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), we analyzed other vascular parameters, determining tumor oxygenation. First, we noticed that intercapillary distances were larger and more variable in IgG-treated HCC than in healthy liver (Figures 2I, 2J, and 2O), consistent with reports that rapidly proliferating HCC cells outgrow their vascular supply and thereby become hypoxic (Wu et al., 2007Wu X.Z. Xie G.R. Chen D. Hypoxia and hepatocellular carcinoma: The therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma.J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2007; 22: 1178-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In fact, large avascular clusters of malignant HCC cells were often found amidst a chaotic capillary network (Figure 2J). In contrast, in PlGF-blocked HCC, intercapillary distances were still variably enlarged but less extensively than in control HCC, thereby creating a more uniform vascular pattern (Figures 2K and 2O). Second, PlGF blockage counteracted tumor capillary abnormalization, which also determines tumor oxygenation (Mazzone et al., 2009Mazzone M. Dettori D. Leite de Oliveira R. Loges S. Schmidt T. Jonckx B. Tian Y.M. Lanahan A.A. Pollard P. Ruiz de Almodovar C. et al.Heterozygous deficiency of PHD2 restores tumor oxygenation and inhibits metastasis via endothelial normalization.Cell. 2009; 136: 839-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In HCC nodules, sinusoids lose their characteristics and develop into capillaries (“sinusoidal capillarization”) (Fernandez et al., 2009Fernandez M. Semela D. Bruix J. Colle I. Pinzani M. Bosch J. Angiogenesis in liver disease.J. Hepatol. 2009; 50: 604-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Typical for HCC, capillaries become surrounded by activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which express increased levels of SMA, deposit matrix, and release angiogenic and tumorigenic factors (Johnson et al., 1998Johnson S.J. Burr A.W. Toole K. Dack C.L. Mathew J. Burt A.D. Macrophage and hepatic stellate cell responses during experimental hepatocarcinogenesis.J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1998; 13: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These changes increase the resistance to blood flow and impede oxygen delivery, further aggravating hypoxia (Fernandez et al., 2009Fernandez M. Semela D. Bruix J. Colle I. Pinzani M. Bosch J. Angiogenesis in liver disease.J. Hepatol. 2009; 50: 604-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, Paternostro et al., 2010Paternostro C. David E. Novo E. Parola M. Hypoxia, angiogenesis and liver fibrogenesis in the progression of chronic liver diseases.World J. Gastroenterol. 2010; 16: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A smaller fraction of capillaries was surrounded by SMA+ HSCs in PlGF-blocked HCC nodules (SMA+ area around capillaries, %: 5.9 ± 1.3 after IgG versus 2.2 ± 0.6 after 5D11D4; n = 6–7; p = 0.02; Figures 2L–2N). Furthermore, several capillaries in control HCC nodules had an abnormal shape and size; although approximately half of them had a regular patent lumen, others were present as cords without lumen, and a smaller fraction was very tortuous (Figures 2I and 2J). PlGF blockage partially normalized their abnormal structure. Indeed, in PlGF-blocked tumors, fewer capillaries were tortuous or cords and had a more normal appearance (tortuous vessels/mm2 and cords/mm2: 44 ± 4 and 237 ± 21 in IgG versus 22 ± 2 and 181 ± 15 in 5D11D4; n = 4–5; p < 0.001 and p = 0.05; Figures 2J and 2K). These changes were functionally relevant, as PlGF-blocked HCC nodules expressed lower levels not only of HIF-2α (HIF-2α+ area, % of nodular area: 28.1 ± 4.3 for IgG versus 14.6 ± 2.6 for 5D11D4; n = 4–5; p < 0.05) but also of other hypoxia-inducible genes (Table S1). Moreover, in line with reports that hypoxia promotes HCC growth, proliferation of HCC cells was higher in avascular clusters (IgG) than in vascular regions with short intercapillary distances (5D11D4) (PCNA+ cells/mm2: 90 ± 18 after IgG versus 36 ± 2 after 5D11D4; n = 4; p = 0.02). Additional analysis showed that activated HSCs are a source of proangiogenic PlGF, and that PlGF is a mitogen and chemoattractant for these cells but not for hepatoma cell lines (not shown). Finally, PlGF blockage reduced hepatic macrophage numbers in the transgenic (Figure 2P) and carcinogen model (not shown). We intercrossed the transgenic Rip1Tag2 model of pancreatic β cell carcinogenesis with PlGF−/− mice. No genotypic differences were observed between Rip1Tag2 × PlGF+/− and Rip1Tag2 × PlGF−/− mice in tumor incidence or burden (Figures 3A and 3B ) or staging (Figure S3A), despite detectable PlGF expression in WT tumors (Figure S3B). As this tumor growth is independent of PlGF, we used it to test whether 5D11D4 inhibits tumorigenesis via off-target activities. Therefore, 9-week-old transgenics bearing angiogenic tumors were treated with 5D11D4 (50 mg/kg; 3×/week) for 3 weeks until end-stage. Treatment with 5D11D4 failed to affect tumor growth or incidence in Rip1Tag2 mice (Figures 3C and 3D), consistent with the absence of non-PlGF effects on tumorigenesis. That 5D11D4 blocks PlGF specifically without off-target effects was confirmed in additional experiments. Indeed, angiogenesis induced by PlGF gene transfer in PlGF−/− mice was selectively blocked by 5D11D4 but not by the anti-Flk1/VEGFR-2 mAb DC101 (Figures 3E–3I), whereas DC101 but not 5D11D4 abrogated angiogenesis induced by VEGF gene transfer (Figures 3J–3N).Figure S3Role of PlGF in Rip1Tag2 Model, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Comparable staging of tumors in normal/hyperplastic islets, adenoma, or carcinoma in Rip1Tag2:PlGF+/− (n = 6) and Rip1Tag2:PlGF−/− mice (n = 6).

We also analyzed why Rip1Tag2 tumors were resistant to PlGF blockage. Notably, tumor angiogenesis was not affected by loss or inhibition of PlGF (Figures 4A and 4B ). In line with findings that neutrophils mediate the tumor angiogenic switch in this model (Nozawa et al., 2006Nozawa H. Chiu C. Hanahan D. Infiltrating neutrophils mediate the initial angiogenic switch in a mouse model of multistage carcinogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 12493-12498Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), infiltration of myeloid cells (primarily neutrophils) was not affected by PlGF blockage (Figures 4C and 4D), likely explaining the refractoriness of this model to PlGF blockage. Bais et al. questioned the specificity of 5D11D4 in targeting PlGF and criticized the use of a single anti-PlGF mAb clone (Bais et al., 2010Bais C. Wu X. Yao J. Yang S. Crawford Y. McCutcheon K.

To address these questions, we also used a model of choroid neovascularization (CNV). Three days after laser injury, choroidal PlGF levels were upregulated (pg/mg: 168 ± 12 in noninjured versus 343 ± 18 in lasered choroids; n = 3; p < 0.05), whereas Flt1 was detected in neovessels and stromal cells (Figure S4A). 5D11D4 accumulated in CNV lesions upon intraperitoneal injection (Figure S4B). Quantification of CNV upon perfusion with FITC-conjugated dextran 14 days after lasering showed that 5D11D4 dose-dependently inhibited CNV, with a maximal effect at 25 mg/kg, 3×/week (Figures 5A–5C ). A comparable inhibition of 60% ± 6% was obtained with 25 mg/kg, 2×/week (n = 10; p = NS versus 3×/week), while intravitreal injection was also effective (not shown). 5D11D4 also inhibited CNV by 53% ± 10% (n = 3; p < 0.05) in Ccl2−/− mice, a model of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that better resembles the human condition.Figure 5Inhibition of CNV by Anti-PlGF or PlGF DeficiencyShow full captionIn all panels, analysis was 14 days after lasering; mAb (3×/week) was started 3 hr after lasering until sacrifice.(A) Dose-dependent inhibition of CNV by 5D11D4 (n = 12/group; ∗p < 0.05).(B and C) FITC-dextran flatmounts, revealing fewer choroidal neovessels after 5D11D4 (C) than control IgG (B).(D) CNV was reduced in PlGF−/− mice, but 5D11D4 treatment (25 mg/kg) did not further reduce CNV in PlGF−/− mice (n = 10/group; ∗p < 0.05 versus WT, control IgG).(E) Flt-TK deficiency reduced CNV but 5D11D4 (25 mg/kg) did not further reduce CNV (n = 6/group; ∗p < 0.05 versus WT, IgG).(F) Inhibition of CNV by anti-PlGF mAb 3C7A8, whereas 12H6B6 only exhibited a tendency (25 mg/kg) (n = 6/group; ∗p < 0.05).(G) Delivery of human PlGF-2 (10 μg/week) stimulated CNV in PlGF−/− mice; hPlGF-driven CNV was blocked by 16D3 (25 mg/kg) (n = 5/group; ∗p < 0.05 versus hPlGF-2 without 16D3).Data are mean ± SEM.

Haughney P. et al.PlGF blockade does not inhibit angiogenesis during primary tumor growth.Cell. 2010; 141 (this issue): 166-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if 5D11D4 would specifically block PlGF, it should not inhibit CNV beyond the level induced by deficiency of PlGF or its signaling receptor Flt1. Loss of PlGF inhibited CNV, but additional 5D11D4 treatment did not further reduce CNV lesions (Figure 5D). Likewise, CNV was inhibited in Flt1-TK−/− mice (indicating that Flt1 signaling is critical and Flt1 does not act as a VEGF-trap alone), but 5D11D4 did not further reduce CNV lesions in these mice (Figure 5E). To assess whether the Fc-fragment of 5D11D4 was required, we generated 5D11D4/Fab fragments (KD = 1.51 nM). At 100- to 400-fold molar excess, Fab inhibited the binding of PlGF to Flt1 (IC50 = ∼1.1 nM), neutralized Flt1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to PlGF (response above control: 217% for PlGF; 0% for PlGF + 5D11D4/Fab; 15% for PlGF + 5D11D4), and blocked the chemotactic activity of PlGF for macrophages (migrated cells/optical field: 169 ± 42 for control; 11 ± 17 for 5D11D4; 0 for 5D11D4/Fab; n = 6; p < 0.05). Compared to control IgG/Fab, intra-ocular injection of 5D11D4/Fab inhibited CNV formation at 5 days by 41% (neovascular area, ×103 μm2: 16.6 ± 2.0 after IgG/Fab versus 9.8 ± 1.7; n = 51–43; p = 0.01). Similar data were obtained with recombinant 5D11D4/Fab (KD = 0.57 nM) (not shown). Other anti-mouse PlGF mAb clones were used to reproduce the 5D11D4 data. Of two other mAbs that bound to PlGF with high affinity and blocked binding of PlGF to Flt1 in vitro, 3C7A8 (KD = 3.4 nM) inhibited CNV, whereas 12H6B5 (KD = 4.3 nM) only showed a tendency (Figure 5F), even despite the fact that plasma levels were >100 μg/ml for all mAbs. Thus, certain anti-PlGF mAb clones with proven blockage of PlGF binding to its receptor in vitro may still not be able to block PlGF-driven processes in vivo. As an independent confirmation of 5D11D4's specificity, we tested whether"

Using cardiac-specific RNAi-silencing in Drosophila, we knocked down 7061 evolutionarily conserved genes under conditions of stress. We present a first global roadmap of pathways potentially playing conserved roles in the cardiovascular system. One critical pathway identified was the CCR4-Not complex implicated in transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms. Silencing of CCR4-Not components in adult Drosophila resulted in myofibrillar disarray and dilated cardiomyopathy. Heterozygous not3 knockout mice showed spontaneous impairment of cardiac contractility and increased susceptibility to heart failure. These heart defects were reversed via inhibition of HDACs, suggesting a mechanistic link to epigenetic chromatin remodeling. In humans, we show that a common NOT3 SNP correlates with altered cardiac QT intervals, a known cause of potentially lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Thus, our functional genome-wide screen in Drosophila can identify candidates that directly translate into conserved mammalian genes involved in heart function."
https://openalex.org/W2151409678,"Cytokines play an emerging role as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and neurohormones in the brain. This paradigm shift in cytokine function offers a new framework to understand their roles in ameliorating neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Molecular adjuvant therapy of AD animal models with glatiramer acetate induces anti-inflammatory responses and therapeutic effects. Although these effects are potentially mediated through anti-inflammatory cytokine signaling, the exact molecular identities and pathways are poorly understood. Here, we show that virus-mediated expression of the mouse interleukin (IL)-4 gene in beta-amyloid precursor protein + presenilin-1 (APP+PS1) bigenic mice attenuates AD pathogenesis. Introduction of an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector encoding IL-4 into the hippocampus resulted in sustained expression of IL-4, reduced astro/microgliosis, amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) oligomerization and deposition, and enhanced neurogenesis. Moreover, increased levels of IL-4 improved spatial learning, promoted phosphorylation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2B at Tyr 1472, and enhanced its cell surface retention both in vivo and in vitro. Our data suggest that neuronal anti-inflammatory cytokine signaling may be a potential alternative target for non-Abeta-mediated treatment of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2011416603,"It has been recently reported that treatment with an anti-placenta growth factor (PlGF) antibody inhibits metastasis and primary tumor growth. Here we show that, although anti-PlGF treatment inhibited wound healing, extravasation of B16F10 cells, and growth of a tumor engineered to overexpress the PlGF receptor (VEGFR-1), neutralization of PlGF using four novel blocking antibodies had no significant effect on tumor angiogenesis in 15 models. Also, genetic ablation of the tyrosine kinase domain of VEGFR-1 in the host did not result in growth inhibition of the anti-VEGF-A sensitive or resistant tumors tested. Furthermore, combination of anti-PlGF with anti-VEGF-A antibodies did not result in greater antitumor efficacy than anti-VEGF-A monotherapy. In conclusion, our data argue against an important role of PlGF during primary tumor growth in most models and suggest that clinical evaluation of anti-PlGF antibodies may be challenging."
https://openalex.org/W2116186946,"To study the role of WNT4 in the postnatal ovary, a mouse strain bearing a floxed Wnt4 allele was created and mated to the Amhr2tm3(cre)Bhr strain to target deletion of Wnt4 to granulosa cells. Wnt4flox/−; Amhr2m3(cre)Bhr/+ mice had reduced ovary weights and produced smaller litters (P<0.05). Serial follicle counting demonstrated that Wnt4flox/−;Amhr2tm3(cre)Bhr/+ mice were born with a normal ovarian reserve and maintained normal numbers of small follicles until puberty but had only 25.2% of the normal number of healthy antral follicles. Some Wnt4flox/−;Amhr2m3(cre)Bhr/+ mice had no antral follicles or corpora lutea and underwent premature follicle depletion. RT-PCR analyses of Wnt4flox/−; Amhr2m3(cre)Bhr/+ granulosa cells and cultured granulosa cells that overexpress WNT4 demonstrated that WNT4 regulates the expression of Star, Cyp11a1, and Cyp19, steroidogenic genes previously identified as downstream targets of the WNT signaling effector CTNNB1. Decreased serum progesterone levels were found in immature, gonadotropin-treated Wnt4flox/−;Amhr2tm3(cre)Bhr/+ mice (P<0.05). WNT4- and CTNNB1-overexpressing cultured granulosa cells were analyzed by microarray for alterations in gene expression, which showed that WNT4 regulates additional genes involved in late follicle development via the WNT/CTNNB1 signaling pathway. Together, these data indicate that WNT4 is required for normal antral follicle development and may act by regulating granulosa cell functions including steroidogenesis.—Boyer, A., Lapointe, E., Zheng, X., Cowan, R.

https://openalex.org/W2137580023,"Primary cilia are chemosensing and mechanosensing organelles that regulate remarkably diverse processes in a variety of cells. We previously showed that primary cilia play a role in mediating mechanosensing in bone cells through an unknown mechanism that does not involve extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent intracellular Ca(2+) release, which has been implicated in all other cells that transduce mechanical signals via the cilium. Here, we identify a molecular mechanism linking primary cilia and bone cell mechanotransduction that involves adenylyl cyclase 6 (AC6) and cAMP. Intracellular cAMP was quantified in MLO-Y4 cells exposed to dynamic flow, and AC6 and primary cilia were inhibited using RNA interference. When exposed to flow, cells rapidly (<2 min) and transiently decreased cAMP production in a primary cilium-dependent manner. RT-PCR revealed differential expression of the membrane-bound isoforms of adenylyl cyclase, while immunostaining revealed one, AC6, preferentially localized to the cilium. Further studies showed that decreases in cAMP in response to flow were dependent on AC6 and Gd(3+)-sensitive channels but not intracellular Ca(2+) release and that this response mediated flow-induced COX-2 gene expression. The signaling events identified provide important details of a novel early mechanosensing mechanism in bone and advances our understanding of how signal transduction occurs at the primary cilium."

Analysis of filamentous fungus Sordaria macrospora reveals that recombination proteins Mer3, Msh4, and Mlh1 play direct roles in all of these aspects, in advance of their known roles in recombination. Absence of Mer3 helicase results in interwoven chromosomes, thereby revealing the existence of features that specifically ensure “entanglement avoidance.” Entanglements that remain at zygotene, i.e., “interlockings,” require Mlh1 for resolution, likely to eliminate constraining recombinational connections.

Recombinosome/axis association arises before, or just after, initiation of recombination via programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Blat et al., 2002Blat Y. Protacio R.U. Hunter N. Kleckner N.

Thereafter, DNA recombination and recombination-mediated juxtaposition of homolog axes progress in close temporal and functional coordination. Homologs first become aligned at a distance of ∼400 nm during leptotene. Except in worm and Drosophila, this process requires DSB formation and is accompanied by appearance of axis-associated foci of RecA homolog(s) (review in Henderson and Keeney, 2005Henderson K.A. Keeney S. Synaptonemal complex formation: where does it start?.Bioessays. 2005; 27: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). At the DNA level, alignment is inferred to involve nascent DNA/DNA interactions between a 3′ single-stranded tail at one DSB end and the homologous region on a homolog partner duplex (Hunter and Kleckner, 2001Hunter N.

Meiotic recombination.in: Aguilera A. Rothstein R. Molecular Genetics of Recombination. Springer Berlin, Heidelberg2006: 381-442Google Scholar). Then, at zygotene, “synapsis” occurs: axes become progressively linked at a distance of ∼100 nm by transverse filaments, which, with other proteins, comprise the synaptonemal complex (SC) (review in Page and Hawley, 2004Page S.L. Hawley R.S. The genetics and molecular biology of the synaptonemal complex.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 525-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The leptotene/zygotene transition is also a crucial point for recombination: nascent interactions are differentiated into crossover (CO)-fated and noncrossover (NCO)-fated products, with concomitant onset of stable strand exchange (review in Hunter, 2006Hunter N. Meiotic recombination.in: Aguilera A. Rothstein R. Molecular Genetics of Recombination. Springer Berlin, Heidelberg2006: 381-442Google Scholar). In several organisms, SC formation is nucleated preferentially at sites of CO-designated interactions (Henderson and Keeney, 2005Henderson K.A. Keeney S. Synaptonemal complex formation: where does it start?.Bioessays. 2005; 27: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After full SC has formed, mature CO and NCO products appear at midpachytene (e.g., Guillon et al., 2005Guillon H. Baudat F. Grey C. Liskay R.M. de Massy B.

This study analyzes the relationship between recombination and homolog juxtaposition in the filamentous fungus Sordaria macrospora which is a very powerful system for such analysis: continuous axes appear at early leptotene such that spatial relationships among chromosomes, and positions of axis-associated recombination-complexes, can be followed from S-phase onward (e.g., Storlazzi et al., 2003Storlazzi A.

Additionally, overall progression of meiosis can be followed by progressive increases in the sizes of both the nucleus and its surrounding ascus (meiocyte), thus permitting the detection of temporal delays in the progression of chromosomal events in mutant backgrounds comparatively to wild-type (e.g., Storlazzi et al., 2003Storlazzi A.

Interplay between homolog pairing and recombination is probed by analysis of mutants defective in three proteins previously shown to be direct participants in the DNA events of recombination: Mer3, Msh4 and Mlh1. Mer3 is a meiosis-specific 3′-5′ helicase that stimulates Rad51-mediated DNA heteroduplex extension and stabilizes recombinational interactions (Nakagawa and Ogawa, 1999Nakagawa T. Ogawa H.

Msh4, as part of the Msh4/Msh5 heterodimer, a meiosis-specific homolog of the bacterial mismatch repair protein MutS, encircles and stabilizes branched DNA structures (Snowden et al., 2004Snowden T. Acharya S. Butz C. Berardini M. Fishel R. hMSH4-hMSH5 recognizes Holliday junctions and forms a meiosis-specific sliding clamp that embraces homologous chromosomes.Mol.

Mlh1/3 are eukaryotic homologs of the bacterial mismatch repair protein MutL and, by analogy, may mediate release of Msh4/5 (Snowden et al., 2004Snowden T. Acharya S. Butz C. Berardini M.

Molecular Genetics of Recombination. Springer Berlin, Heidelberg2006: 381-442Google Scholar). Mer3 and Msh4 are implicated in ensuring that the fates of CO-designated interactions are faithfully maintained and efficiently implemented during and after the leptotene/zygotene “CO control” transition. In the absence of either gene product, CO formation is specifically abrogated while NCOs form at high levels (e.g., Borner et al., 2004Borner G.V. Kleckner N. Hunter N.

Mhl1 is implicated at a later stage, in finalization of CO recombinational interactions during pachytene (Hunter, 2006Hunter N. Meiotic recombination.in: Aguilera A. Rothstein R.

In correspondence with their times of action during recombination, foci of Mer3 and Msh4/5 are observed prior to and during SC formation, whereas foci of Mlh1 are not visible until after completion of synapsis (e.g., de Boer et al., 2006de Boer E.

Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 2055-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and references therein). Our results reveal that each of these three proteins plays a central role in homolog juxtaposition one stage prior its established role in promoting recombination. Mer3 and Msh4 are implicated in leptotene alignment (in advance of the leptotene/zygotene CO control transition) while Mlh1 is implicated in resolution of interlocks at zygotene (in advance of midpachytene CO finalization). Mer3 mutant phenotypes suggest the existence of an “entanglement avoidance” process. Further, the patterns and dynamics of Mer3 and Msh4 foci provide new information about the nature of the alignment process and, by implication, the positioning of DSB end(s) during alignment and the CO control transition. Integration of these findings with previous molecular and biochemical information leads to a model for how Mer3 and Msh4 could mediate alignment by stabilizing nascent DSB/partner interactions within axis-associated recombinosomes while Mlh1 mediates interlock resolution by removing Msh4/5 stabilization of these contacts. Sordaria macrospora Mer3, Msh4, and Mlh1 were cloned and completely null deletion mutations constructed, found to be recessive in heterozygous crosses, and further analyzed. Cytological localization was determined for Msh4-GFP and Mer3-GFP fusion proteins, expressed from their respective promoters at ectopic locations. Both fusion genes complement all meiotic defects of cognate null mutants. See Supplemental Information (SI) for details. Chromosomes of the three null alleles were analyzed in leptotene through pachytene nuclei (n = 300 each), by DAPI staining of chromatin and with two previously characterized axis markers: Spo76/Pds5-GFP (van Heemst et al., 1999van Heemst D. James F. Pöggeler S. Berteaux-Lecellier V. Zickler D. Spo76p is a conserved chromosome morphogenesis protein that links the mitotic and meiotic programs.Cell. 1999; 98: 261-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and meiosis-specific cohesin Rec8-GFP (Storlazzi et al., 2008Storlazzi A. Tesse S. Ruprich-Robert G. Gargano S. Pöggeler S. Kleckner N. Zickler D. Coupling meiotic chromosome axis integrity to recombination.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 796-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In all three mutants, chromosome axes are indistinguishable from wild-type (WT) axes: Spo76 and Rec8 load at S phase and form complete lines along chromosomes from early leptotene to end pachytene (below). Thus, effects of mutations on spatial relationships can be analyzed without complications from defects in axis development. All three mutants progress through meiosis and sporulation with the same progressive increase in ascus size as in WT. However, chromosomal progression from leptotene to pachytene is prolonged in all three mutants: by ∼10 hr in mer3Δ or msh4Δ and ∼12 hr in mlh1Δ (24–26 hr instead of 12 in WT). Analogous prolongations occur in Arabidopsis Atmlh3 and Atmsh4 (Higgins et al., 2004Higgins J.D. Armstrong S.J. Franklin F.C. Jones G.H. The Arabidopsis MutS homolog AtMSH4 functions at an early step in recombination: evidence for two classes of recombination in Arabidopsis.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2557-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, Jackson et al., 2006Jackson N. Sanchez-Moran E. Buckling E. Armstrong S.J. Jones G.H. Franklin F.C. Reduced meiotic crossovers and delayed prophase I progression in AtMLH3-deficient Arabidopsis.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1315-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All three mutants exhibit defects in pairing and synapsis (below). They show also defects in the bouquet dynamics. As in WT, chromosome ends transiently cluster in one area of the nuclear periphery at late leptotene and then redisperse at pachytene onset, but exit from cluster is significantly delayed (Figures S1A–1H available online). Recombination is also defective in all three mutants (Figures S2A–S2F and details in legends). In mer3Δ and msh4Δ mutants, chiasmata are drastically reduced (4–7) compared to WT (21 ± 3). mlh1Δ confers a milder defect: genetic analysis reveals a ∼40% reduction in COs with no reduction in NCOs (see details in legend of Figure S2B). As similar defects were found in other organisms (review in Hunter, 2006Hunter N. Meiotic recombination.in: Aguilera A. Rothstein R. Molecular Genetics of Recombination. Springer Berlin, Heidelberg2006: 381-442Google Scholar), the corresponding proteins likely play the same roles for recombination in Sordaria. In WT meiosis, unrelated chromosomes are occasionally seen entangled with one another, usually at zygotene. In such “interlocks,” either one chromosome or a pair of chromosomes is located between two aligned homologs, held in place by regular synapsis to either side (Figures 1A and 1B ). For Sordaria, interlocked chromosomes are seen in ∼20% of WT serially sectioned zygotene nuclei (n = 121; DZ, unpublished data) and in ∼15% (n = 300) of nuclei by immunofluorescence using Spo76-GFP as axis marker (Figure 1A). Further, by early pachytene, no interlocks are seen by either method. Thus WT meiosis must include a mechanism for their resolution during zygotene. Resolution of interlocks has been suggested previously (review in von Wettstein et al., 1984von Wettstein D. Rasmussen S.W. Holm P.B. The synaptonemal complex in genetic segregation.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 331-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, Wang, C.R. et al., 2009Wang C.R. Carlton P.M. Golubovskaya I.N. Cande W.Z. Interlock formation and coiling of meiotic chromosome axes during synapsis.Genetics. 2009; 183: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); however, conclusions were often limited by the small number of nuclei examined and by the inability to exclude the possibility that interlocks were absent at pachytene because the corresponding nuclei were absent from the experimental population (e.g., via apoptosis in mammals; reviewed in von Wettstein et al., 1984von Wettstein D. Rasmussen S.W. Holm P.B. The synaptonemal complex in genetic segregation.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 331-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, Zickler and Kleckner, 1999Zickler D. Kleckner N. Meiotic chromosomes: integrating structure and function.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 603-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). In Sordaria, disappearance of interlocks cannot be explained in this way because: (1) there is no apoptosis, and (2) 99% of WT nuclei/asci go on to give eight viable ascospores. In Sordaria, potential interlocks are in fact visible prior to onset of synapsis: at late leptotene single chromosomes or aligned pairs are sometimes seen located between another aligned pair of homologs (Figure 1C), thus at high risk of being entrapped at zygotene. Such configurations provide direct evidence that the interlocks defined at zygotene by synaptic patterns reflect the fixation of irregular patterns already present during alignment. In the absence of Mlh1, in striking contrast to WT, ∼45% of all late pachytene nuclei (by ascus size; n = 350) show at least one interlocking (Figures 1D and 1E). Thus, Mlh1 is required for resolution of interlocks. Another ∼20% of nuclei present a new configuration, not previously reported, where one or two homolog pairs show nonsynapsed regions (variable in length) not involved in interlocks (Figures 1F and 1G). These could represent cases of incomplete resolution and/or left-behind regions that are unable to synapse after resolution. Since Mlh1 is known to be involved in dissociating and/or resolving recombination intermediates (Hunter, 2006Hunter N. Meiotic recombination.in: Aguilera A. Rothstein R. Molecular Genetics of Recombination. Springer Berlin, Heidelberg2006: 381-442Google Scholar), mlh1Δ phenotypes suggest that interlock resolution requires elimination of (cytologically invisible) constraining DNA connections that arise during alignment, with Mlh1 devoted to that role. Aside from persistence of interlocks, chromosome dynamics in mlh1Δ are morphologically the same as in WT: homologous axes align synchronously, to ∼400 nm and then ∼200 nm (Figure 1H), with normal accompanying numbers and patterns of localization for Rad51 foci, which mark the sites of DSBs, and for Mer3 foci (data not shown). Importantly, however, while the period of alignment is rather short in WT (10%–20% of prophase nuclei show fully aligned homologs), in mlh1Δ, 35% of nuclei (n = 300 for each) show this configuration (Figure 1H). Mlh1 is therefore functionally relevant even prior to its involvement in interlock resolution. The synaptic period is also greatly prolonged in mlh1Δ: while ∼10% of WT nuclei are at zygotene, 25% of mutant nuclei exhibit early or intermediate extents of synapsis (n = 300 for each strain). Even so, ultimately, all homologs synchronously synapse (Figure 1I). Notably, three mlh1Δ phenotypes emerge at zygotene, thus one stage earlier than the defined pachytene role of Mlh1 in recombination (Hunter, 2006Hunter N. Meiotic recombination.in: Aguilera A. Rothstein R. Molecular Genetics of Recombination. Springer Berlin, Heidelberg2006: 381-442Google Scholar): delayed onset of synapsis, delayed bouquet release (above) and persistence of interlocks (resolved during zygotene in WT). Like mlh1Δ, msh4Δ homologs have no problem with initiation or occurrence of presynaptic alignment. An alteration in alignment is nonetheless apparent: msh4Δ homolog axes initially align at a distance of ∼600-800 nm (Figures 2A and 2B ), rather than the ∼400 nm seen in WT (Figure 2C). This unique phenotype points to direct participation of the recombination complex in determining interaxis distances. Further, Msh4, like Mlh1, plays a role in homolog pairing at leptotene, thus one stage prior to the time of its defined role in formation of recombinants (at zygotene; Introduction). Once synapsis begins, msh4Δ exhibits also dramatic per-chromosome and per-region defects (Figure 2D). In WT meiosis, all seven chromosome-pairs progress synchronously and efficiently from alignment (Figure 2C) to zygotene (Figure 2E) and synapsis (Figure 2F). In msh4Δ, post-alignment nuclei show a mixture of bivalents at different stages of synapsis (Figures 2G). Finally, 95% of the nuclei that would be in pachytene in a WT ascus of corresponding size still show a mixture of fully and partially synapsed homologs (n = 100; Figure 2H). Since synapsis is tightly coupled to CO-designation and progression during the leptotene/zygotene transition, these defects likely reflect the known role of Msh4 in recombination during this period (Hunter, 2006Hunter N. Meiotic recombination.in: Aguilera A. Rothstein R. Molecular Genetics of Recombination. Springer Berlin, Heidelberg2006: 381-442Google Scholar). Despite the complexity of synaptic patterns, the dynamics of Rad51 and Mer3 foci remain relatively unperturbed in msh4Δ. Both types of foci appear with WT timing plus location (Figures S3A–S3G) and number (respectively 52 ± 8 and 110 ± 9; n = 90). At pachytene (by ascus size) both types of foci remain present in unsynapsed regions while disappearing in synapsed regions in the same nucleus (e.g., Figure 2I for Rad51), as normally seen during synchronous progression through zygotene in WT (below). These results emphasize the tight functional linkage between recombinational progression and pairing/synapsis not only globally, but also locally, on a region-by-region basis. In WT, at midleptotene, all homolog pairs of every nucleus exhibit visible alignment (Figure 3A ). At the corresponding ascus size in mer3Δ, chromosomes are still separated and highly “interwoven” (Figures 3B–3D). Further, when alignment does finally occur, at ascus sizes corresponding to zygotene in WT, even more dramatic “interweaving” is seen (Figures 3E and 3F). This phenotype reveals that pairing normally includes specific features that preclude or minimize the formation of “interwoven” chromosomes” and, further, that such features require the presence of Mer3. To distinguish this phenotype from interlocks (above), which involve SC formation, we refer to these presynaptic configurations as “entanglements.” Occurrence of entanglements is specifically distinct from defects in the process of alignment per se. Sordaria ski8 mutants exhibit reduced levels of DSBs and reduced levels of alignment but do not show entanglements (Tesse et al., 2003Tesse S. Storlazzi A. Kleckner N. Gargano S. Zickler D. Localization and roles of Ski8p protein in Sordaria meiosis and delineation of three mechanistically distinct steps of meiotic homolog juxtaposition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 12865-12870Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Moreover, in mer3Δ, topological aberrancy is observed in conjunction with a preceding delay in onset of alignment, raising the possibility of a cause-and-effect relationship between these two defects. Avoidance of entanglements may be specifically dependent upon tight temporal coupling between initial identification of a homolog/partner contact and ensuing juxtaposition at that site, with Mer3 being required for such coupling (Discussion). mer3Δ defects in alignment arise after, and do not reflect defects in, DSB formation. Rad51 foci appear on axes at early leptotene (by ascus size) in a WT-like number (52 ± 7, n = 90). Rad51 morphologies do become aberrant thereafter, with elongated signals occurring and persisting along chromosome axes (Figures 3G an"
https://openalex.org/W2141196156,"D-serine is thought to be a glia-derived transmitter that activates N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in the brain. Here, we investigate the pathways for D-serine release using primary cultures, brain slices, and in vivo microdialysis. In contrast with the notion that D-serine is exclusively released from astrocytes, we found that D-serine is released by neuronal depolarization both in vitro and in vivo. Veratridine (50 microM) or depolarization by 40 mM KCl elicits a significant release of endogenous D-serine from primary neuronal cultures. Controls with astrocyte cultures indicate that glial cells are insensitive to veratridine, but release D-serine mainly by the opening of volume-regulated anion channels. In cortical slices perfused with veratridine, endogenous D-serine release is 10-fold higher than glutamate receptor-evoked release. Release of D-serine from slices does not require internal or external Ca(2+), suggesting a nonvesicular release mechanism. To confirm the neuronal origin of D-serine, we selectively loaded neurons in cortical slices with D-[(3)H]serine or applied D-alanine, which specifically releases D-serine from neurons. Depolarization with veratridine promotes D-serine release in vivo monitored by high temporal resolution microdialysis of the striatum. Our data indicate that the neuronal pool of D-serine plays a major role in D-serine dynamics, with implications for the regulation of NMDAR transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2147652719,"Muscle atrophy is a consequence of chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes) and glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance that results from enhanced activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The PI3K/Akt pathway inhibits the FOXO-mediated transcription of the muscle-specific E3 ligase atrogin-1/MAFbx (AT-1), whereas the MEK/ERK pathway increases Sp1 activity and ubiquitin (UbC) expression. The observations raise a question about how the transcription of these atrogenes is synchronized in atrophic muscle. We tested a signaling model in which FOXO3a mediates crosstalk between the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways to coordinate AT-1 and UbC expression. In rat L6 myotubes, dexamethasone (> or = 24 h) reduced insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 protein and PI3K/Akt signaling and increased AT-1 mRNA. IRS-2 protein, MEK/ERK signaling, Sp1 phosphorylation, and UbC transcription were simultaneously increased. Knockdown of IRS-1 using small interfering RNA or adenovirus-mediated expression of constitutively activated FOXO3a increased IRS-2 protein, MEK/ERK signaling, and UbC expression. Changes in PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK signaling were recapitulated in rat muscles undergoing atrophy due to streptozotocin-induced insulin deficiency and concurrently elevated glucocorticoid production. IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylation were decreased, whereas MEK/ERK signaling and expression of IRS-2, UbC and AT-1 were increased. We conclude that FOXO3a mediates a reciprocal communication between the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt and IRS-2/MEK/ERK pathways that coordinates AT-1 and ubiquitin expression during muscle atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2068240724,"Mitochondrial carriers are a family of transport proteins that shuttle metabolites, nucleotides, and coenzymes across the mitochondrial membrane. The function of only a few of the 35 Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial carriers still remains to be uncovered. In this study, we have functionally defined and characterized the S. cerevisiae mitochondrial carrier Yhm2p. The YHM2 gene was overexpressed in S. cerevisiae, and its product was purified and reconstituted into liposomes. Its transport properties, kinetic parameters, and targeting to mitochondria show that Yhm2p is a mitochondrial transporter for citrate and oxoglutarate. Reconstituted Yhm2p also transported oxaloacetate, succinate, and fumarate to a lesser extent, but virtually not malate and isocitrate. Yhm2p catalyzed only a counter-exchange transport that was saturable and inhibited by sulfhydryl-blocking reagents but not by 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate (a powerful inhibitor of the citrate/malate carrier). The physiological role of Yhm2p is to increase the NADPH reducing power in the cytosol (required for biosynthetic and antioxidant reactions) and probably to act as a key component of the citrate-oxoglutarate NADPH redox shuttle between mitochondria and cytosol. This protein function is based on observations documenting a decrease in the NADPH/NADP(+) and GSH/GSSG ratios in the cytosol of DeltaYHM2 cells as well as an increase in the NADPH/NADP(+) ratio in their mitochondria compared with wild-type cells. Our proposal is also supported by the growth defect displayed by the DeltaYHM2 strain and more so by the DeltaYHM2DeltaZWF1 strain upon H(2)O(2) exposure, implying that Yhm2p has an antioxidant function."
https://openalex.org/W2098111353,"Choline is an essential nutrient, and deficiency causes liver and muscle dysfunction. Common genetic variations alter the risk of developing organ dysfunction when choline deficient, probably by causing metabolic inefficiencies that should be detectable even while ingesting a normal choline-adequate diet. We determined whether metabolomic profiling of plasma at baseline could predict whether humans will develop liver dysfunction when deprived of dietary choline. Fifty-three participants were fed a diet containing 550 mg choline/70 kg/d for 10 d and then fed <50 mg choline/70 kg/d for up to 42 d. Participants who developed organ dysfunction on this diet were repleted with a choline-adequate diet for ≥3 d. Plasma samples, obtained at baseline, end of depletion, and end of repletion, were used for targeted and nontargeted metabolomic profiling. Liver fat was assessed using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Metabolomic profiling and targeted biochemical analyses were highly correlated for the analytes assessed by both procedures. In addition, we report relative concentration changes of other small molecules detected by the nontargeted metabolomic analysis after choline depletion.

In the absence of cellular stimulation and when Akt is inactive, Foxo3a is localized within the nucleus where it performs transcription of target genes. However, upon phosphorylation by Akt at Thr-32, Ser-253, and Ser-315, it binds to 14-3-3 and cannot exert the transcriptional function (6Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S.

Fas ligand (FasL) is a potential transcriptional target of Foxo3a, but the transcriptional output can be either activation or suppression. It has been reported that Foxo3a can stimulate FasL expression, thereby triggering apoptosis (6Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar). However, there is also evidence showing that Foxo3a decreases the expression of FasL (7Jonsson H. Allen P. Peng S.L. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 666-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which Foxo3a regulates FasL expression remains further elusive. miR-21 has been shown to regulate apoptosis by targeting a variety of apoptotic factors. It contributes to glioma malignancy by down-regulating matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, thereby leading to the activation of matrix metalloproteinases and promoting invasiveness of cancer cells (8Gabriely G. Wurdinger T. Kesari S. Esau C.C. Burchard J. Linsley P.S. Krichevsky A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5369-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). It promotes cell transformation by targeting the programmed cell death 4 gene (9Lu Z. Liu M. Stribinskis V. Klinge C.M. Ramos K.S. Colburn N.H. Li Y. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 4373-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). miR-21 is overexpressed in human cholangiocarcinoma and regulates programmed cell death 4 and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (10Selaru F.M.

Given the important role of FasL in apoptosis, it is not yet clear whether FasL can be a target of miR-21 in the apoptotic machinery. The expression levels of miRNAs remain constant under physiological condition. Their alterations may cause the pathological disorders. miRNA expression can be regulated by transcriptional factors. For example, miR-34a causes dramatic reprogramming of gene expression and promotes apoptosis, and it is transactivated by the tumor suppression gene p53 (11Raver-Shapira N. Marciano E. Meiri E. Spector Y. Rosenfeld N. Moskovits N. Bentwich Z. Oren M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 731-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Serum response factor can directly bind to the promoter of miR-1-1 and miR-1-2 genes and activate their expression (12Zhao Y. Samal E. Srivastava D. Nature. 2005; 436: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). Our recent work reveals that miR-23a is a transcriptional target of nuclear factor of activated T cells c3 (13Lin Z. Murtaza I. Wang K. Jiao J. Gao J. Li P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12103-12108Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Because the functions of miRNAs are closely related to their expression levels, it is important to explore the molecular mechanism governing their expression. Foxo3a and miR-21 are involved in apoptosis, but it is not yet clear whether there is an impact between these two factors in the apoptotic machinery. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death. Chemotherapy plays an important role for the treatment of lung cancer, and doxorubicin is commonly used for lung cancer therapy. However, a major obstacle of chemotherapy is the cancer resistance. It is critically important to identify the factors that participate in the regulation of cancer cell apoptosis, so that novel approaches can be developed for cancer therapy. Our present work aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanism by which Foxo3a regulates the apoptotic program in A549 human lung cancer cells. Our results revealed that Foxo3a transcriptionally represses the expression of miR-21. Furthermore, we identified FasL as a target of miR-21. In addition, we found that Foxo3a regulates FasL through miR-21. Our data shed new light on understanding the regulation of miRNA expression and the relationship among Foxo3a, miR-21, and FasL in the apoptotic cascades. Human lung cancer cells (A549) and human neuroblastoma cells (SH-EP1) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The treatment with doxorubicin (Sigma) was performed as we described (14Wang J.X. Li Q. Li P.F. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The culture of cardiac fibroblasts was performed as we described (15Li P.F. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cell death was determined by trypan blue exclusion, and the numbers of trypan blue-positive and -negative cells were counted on a hemocytometer. Apoptosis was determined by the terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase-mediated TUNEL using a kit from Roche Applied Science. The detection procedures were in accordance with the kit instructions.

They were cloned into pSilencer adeno 1.0-CMV vector (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human mir-21 promoter region was amplified from human genomic DNA using PCR to generate wild type promoter. The large fragment containing two Foxo3a potential binding sites (wild type promoter-1, wt-1) was amplified using the forward primer, 5′-AAACCAAGGCTCTTACCATAGC-3′. The short fragment containing one Foxo3a potential binding (wild type promoter-2 (wt-2)) was amplified using the forward primer, 5′-GCATGAGAGAGCCACTACCAAG-3′. Both fragments were amplified using the reverse primer, 5′-TGGTACAGCCATGGAGATGTCA-3′. The promoters were cloned into the reporter plasmid, pGL4.17 (Promega). The introduction of mutations in the putative Foxo3a binding site in wt-1 fragment (−197 to −191 wild type, 5′-ATAAACA-3′; mutant, 5′-ACGGCCA-3′) was generated using QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Human FasL promoter region (from −3157 to +2) was amplified using the same protocol as described for miR-21. The forward primer was 5′-GTGACCTGTCCAGTTCACACAG-3′; the reverse primer was 5′-TGCATGGCAGCTGGTGAGTCAG-3′. The constructs were sequence-verified. miR-21 was synthesized by PCR using human genomic DNA as the template. The upstream primer was 5′-GCATTATGAGCATTATGTCAGA-3′; the downstream primer was 5′-CATACAGCTAGAAAAGTCCCTG-3′. The PCR fragment was finally cloned into the Adeno-XTM Expression System (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. FasL with 3′-UTR was amplified by PCR. The forward primer was 5′-GAGAAGCACTTTGGGATTCTTTC-3′. The reverse primer was 5′-CCCTACAATTGCACTGGAAATAC-3′. The PCR fragment was subcloned into the pGL3 vector (Promega) immediately downstream of the stop codon of the luciferase gene. To produce mutated 3′-UTR, the mutations (wild type 3′-UTR, 5′-ATAAGCTA-3′; mutated 3′-UTR, 5′-ATCCATTA-3′) was generated using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The constructs were sequence-verified. FasL with the 3′-UTR was from Origene. To produce FasL with mutated 3′-UTR, the mutations (wild type 3′-UTR, 5′-ATAAGCTA-3′; mutated, 3′-UTR: 5′-ATCCATTA-3′) was generated using QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The constructs were sequence-verified. They were cloned into the Adeno-XTM Expression System (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting was carried out as we previously described (16Li P.F. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6027-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100) containing a protease inhibitor mixture. Samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Equal protein loading was controlled by Ponceau Red staining of membranes. Blots were probed using the primary antibodies. The anti-Foxo3a and the anti-phospho Foxo3a antibody (Thr-32) were from Cell Signaling. The anti-FasL antibody was from Abcam. The anti-PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) antibody and the anti-actin antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. After four washes with phosphate-buffered saline, Tween 20, the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were added. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunofluorescence was performed as we described (17Li P.F. Li J. Müller E.C. Otto A. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The samples were imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 META). Subcellular fractions were prepared as described with modifications (18Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the pellets were suspended in 0.2 ml of ice-cold buffer (20 mm potassium-HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mm potassium acetate, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing a protease inhibitor mixture. The cells were homogenized by 12 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 750 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to collect nuclei. The resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to collect the cytosolic fractions. ChIP was performed as we and other described (19Li Y.Z. Lu D.Y. Tan W.Q. Wang J.X. Li P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 564-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Szak S.T. Mays D. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature. The cross-linking was quenched with 0.1 m glycine for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in a lysis buffer. The cell lysates were sonicated into chromatin fragments with an average length of 500–800 bp as assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The samples were precleared with Protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C on a rocking platform, and 5 μg of specific antibodies were added and rocked for overnight at 4 °C. The anti-NFAT4 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoprecipitates were captured with 10% (v/v) Protein A-agarose for 4 h. Before use, Protein A-agarose was blocked twice at 4 °C with salmon sperm DNA (2 μg/ml) overnight. For the analysis of Foxo3a binding to the promoter of FasL, PCRs were performed with the primers that encompass Foxo3a BS1 or BS2 of the human FasL promoter. The oligonucleotides were as follows: BS1 (forward, 5′-GGATGGGCAGAATGTATCAGAG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCAATAACTTCCAAGTAGTTA-3′); BS2 (forward 5′-CAAGGCAAGAGGATTGCTTGAG-3′; reverse, 5′-ACCTGCTACACCCACTTTAGAA-3′). For the analysis of Foxo3a binding to the promoter region of miR-21, the oligonucleotides were as follows: BS1 (forward 5′-AAACCAAGGCTCTTACCATAGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-CATTGCACTCCAACTTGGGCAA-3′); BS2 (forward, 5′-CTCTGGTTTCAACAGACACAAA-3′; reverse, 5′-TCTGGCCTGTTAAGATCGAACC-3′). For the analysis of NFAT4 binding to the promoter region of FasL, the oligonucleotides were as follows: forward, 5′-GGTATCCAGCGCTGATTTGCT-3′; reverse, 5′-ACCTCTCTCCAGTTCTCTTCT-3′. Luciferase assay was performed as we described (13Lin Z. Murtaza I. Wang K. Jiao J. Gao J. Li P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12103-12108Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 21Tan W.Q. Wang K. Lv D.Y. Li P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29730-29739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Briefly, for miR-21 and FasL promoters luciferase assays cells were seeded in 24-well plates. They were transfected with the plasmid constructs using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Each well contained 0.2 μg of luciferase reporter plasmids and 2.5 ng of SV-Renilla luciferase plasmids as the internal control. Cells were harvested at the indicated times after transfection for the detection of luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20 μl of protein extracts were analyzed in a luminometer. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. For FasL 3′-UTR luciferase assay, cells were co-transfected with the plasmid constructs of 200 ng/well pGL3-FasL-3′-UTR, 400 ng/well miR-21, 20 pmol of either miR-21 antagomir or antagomir negative control (antagomir-NC) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). At 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured. Stem-loop qRT-PCR for mature miR-21 and miR-670 was performed as described (22Chen C. Ridzon D.A. Broomer A.J. Zhou Z. Lee D.H. Nguyen J.T. Barbisin M. Xu N.L. Mahuvakar V.R. Andersen M.R. Lao K.Q. Livak K.J. Guegler K.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e179Crossref PubMed Scopus (3924) Google Scholar) on an Applied Biosystems AB 7000 Real Time PCR system. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent. After DNase I (Takara, Japan) treatment, RNA was reverse-transcribed with reverse transcriptase (ReverTra Ace, Toyobo). The levels of miR-21 and miR-670 analyzed by qRT-PCR were normalized to that of U6. U6 primers were: forward, 5′-CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA-3′; reverse, 5′-AACGCTTCACGAATTTGCGT-3′. qRT-PCR analysis for FasL was standardized to control values of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The sequences of FasL primers were: forward, 5′-CTGAAGAAGAGAGGGAACCACA-3′; reverse, 5′-AGCTCCTTCTGTAGGTGGAAGA-3′. The sequences of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers were: forward primer, 5′-CCAAAAGGGTCATCATCTCTGC-3′; reverse, 5′-TGCTAAGCAGTTGGTGGTGCAG-3′. Chemically modified antagomir complementary to miR-21 designed to inhibit endogenous miR-21 expression and antagomir-NC were obtained from GenePharma Co. Ltd. The antagomir sequence was 5′-UCAACAUCAGUCUGAUAAGCUA-3′. The antagomir-NC sequence was 5′-CAGUACUUUUGUGUAGUACAA-3′. Cells were transfected with the antagomirs or the antagomir-NC using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The results are expressed as means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. The statistical comparison among different groups was performed by one-way analysis of variance. Paired data were evaluated by Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We analyzed whether Foxo3a and miR-21 are involved in the apoptotic program of doxorubicin. The immunofluorescence of A549 cells revealed that Foxo3a was predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm in the control cells without treatment. In contrast, Foxo3a was accumulated in the nuclei in response to doxorubicin treatment. The immunoblotting of subcellular fractions also revealed that Foxo3a was translocated from the cytoplasm to the nuclei upon doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 1A). Because doxorubicin is a component of the standard chemotherapeutic protocol to treat neuroblastoma, we tested whether it can also influence Foxo3a in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-EP1. A similar result was obtained in SH-EP1 cells (Fig. 1B). The subcellular distributions of Foxo3a are controlled by its phosphorylation status (6Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we detected the subcellular distributions of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated Foxo3a upon doxorubicin treatment. We observed a time-dependent elevation of nonphosphorylated Foxo3a in the nuclei and a reduction of phosphorylated Foxo3a in the cytoplasm in both A549 and SH-EP1 cells (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that doxorubicin can induce the relocalization of Foxo3a to the nuclei. We detected the levels of miR-21 in cells upon doxorubicin treatment. Doxorubicin induced a reduction in miR-21 levels in A549 (Fig. 1D) and SH-EP-1 cells (Fig. 1E). To know if the alterations of miR-21 is specific or not, we detected miR-670, and no significant alterations in miR-670 levels were observed (data not shown). Thus, it appears that miR-21 can be down-regulated by doxorubicin. The simultaneous alterations in Foxo3a and miR-21 led us to consider whether these two events are related. To address this issue, we produced Foxo3a RNAi constructs and tested whether knockdown of Foxo3a can influence miR-21 levels. The RNAi construct of Foxo3a but not its scramble form was able to suppress Foxo3a expression (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, knockdown of Foxo3a could attenuate the reduction of miR-21 induced by doxorubicin in A549 (Fig. 2B) and SH-EP1 cells (Fig. 2C). To further understand whether Foxo3a is able to influence miR-21 expression, we detected miR-21 levels in cells expressing the constitutively active form of Foxo3a (caFoxo3a) (Fig. 2D). Enforced expression of caFoxo3a led to an elevation in miR-21 levels in A549 (Fig. 2E) and SH-EP1 cells (Fig. 2F). These data suggest that Foxo3a can negatively influence the expression of miR-21. We tested whether Foxo3a and miR-21 are functionally related in apoptosis. Enforced expression of miR-21 could attenuate apoptosis induced by caFoxo3a in A549 (Fig. 3A) and SH-EP1 cells (Fig. 3B). miR-21 also could inhibit apoptosis induced by doxorubicin (Fig. 3C). We characterized the role of endogenous miR-21 in the apoptotic program of doxorubicin. Doxorubicin at a dose of 0.2 μm led to a less amount of cells to undergoing apoptosis. However, knockdown of miR-21 resulted in a significant amount of cells undergoing apoptosis in response to the same dose of doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 3D). We tested whether Foxo3a is involved in mediating the apoptotic signal of doxorubicin. Knockdown of Foxo3a was able to attenuate apoptosis induced by doxorubicin, but this effect could be abolished by miR-21 antagomir (Fig. 3E). Collectively, Foxo3a and miR-21 are functionally related in the apoptotic cascades. The functional correlation between Foxo3a and miR-21 necessitates the elucidation of the mechanism by which miR-21 is regulated by Foxo3a. Foxo3a is a transcriptional factor. Accordingly, we tested whether the regulation of miR-21 by Foxo3a occurs through a transcriptionally dependent or independent manner. To this end, we analyzed the promoter region of miR-21. There are two optimal Foxo3a consensus binding sites (Fig. 4, A and B). ChIP assay revealed an increase in the association levels of Foxo3a with BS2 in response to doxorubicin treatment. However, an association of Foxo3a with BS1 was not detectable (Fig. 4A). We tested whether Foxo3a can influence miR-21 promoter activity. Wild type miR-21 promoter (wt-1) demonstrated a low activity in the presence of caFoxo3a. Also, the truncated form of wild type miR-21 promoter containing only the binding site-2 (wt-2) showed a low activity in the presence of caFoxo3a. However, mutations in the Foxo3a consensus binding site-2 (BS2) could abolish the inhibitory effect of Foxo3a on miR-21 promoter activity (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that BS2 is the Foxo3a binding site. Doxorubicin could induce a time-dependent reduction in miR-21 promoter activity (Fig. 4D). Concomitantly, knockdown of Foxo3a could attenuate the reduction of miR-21 promoter activity induced by doxorubicin in A549 (Fig. 4E) and SH-EP-1 cells (Fig. 4F). These data indicate that miR-21 can be transcriptionally repressed by Foxo3a. Foxo3a and miR-21 cannot directly execute apoptosis. Which molecules are their downstream mediators? Foxo3a has been shown to either activate or suppress FasL transcription depending on the cellular context (6Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar, 7Jonsson H. Allen P. Peng S.L. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 666-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We detected the levels of FasL in response to doxorubicin treatment. An up-regulation of FasL could be observed upon doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 5A). Knockdown of FasL attenuated cell death (Fig. 5B), suggesting that FasL participates in conveying the death signal of doxorubicin. We tested whether the up-regulation of FasL is related to Foxo3a. Knockdown of Foxo3a attenuated FasL protein levels upon doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 5C). Surprisingly, FasL mRNA levels were not significantly altered by knockdown of Foxo3a (Fig. 5D). Human FasL promoter region contains 2 Foxo3a consensus binding sites (Fig. 5E). We performed a ChIP assay to detect whether Foxo3a binds to these sites upon doxorubicin treatment. The ChIP assay revealed that there was no detectable association between Foxo3a and the consensus binding site-1 (BS1) or binding site-2 (BS2) (Fig. 5F). We tested whether caFoxo3a can influence FasL mRNA levels and promoter activity. caFoxo3a led to no significant alterations in FasL mRNA levels (Fig. 5G) as well as FasL promoter activity (Fig. 5H). We sequenced the promoter region of FasL (3157 bp) and found no mutations in this region. We used NFAT4 as a positive control because FasL promoter contains NFAT4 binding sites (23Latinis K.M. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31427-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We tested whether NFAT4 can bind to the promoter region of FasL in the primary cardiac fibroblasts. NFAT4 association with FasL promoter could be detectable (Fig. 5I). Taken together, these data suggest that Foxo3a does not transcriptionally regulate FasL expression upon doxorubicin treatment. The deficiency of Foxo3a to transcriptionally regulate FasL led us to search for other mechanisms that account for the up-regulation of FasL upon doxorubicin treatment. miRNAs can suppress gene expression, whereas doxorubicin can induce a reduction of miR-21 expression. These lines of evidence encouraged us to test whether miR-21 participates in the regulation of FasL. Enforced expression of miR-21 could attenuate the elevation of FasL levels induced by doxorubicin (Fig. 6A). Knockdown of endogenous miR-21 augmented FasL expression (Fig. 6B). To understand whether miR-21 can directly target FasL, we analyzed the 3′-UTR region of FasL and observed that miR-21 is a potential target of FasL (Fig. 6C). A luciferase assay revealed that miR-21 could suppress the translational activity of FasL. Introduction of mutations in the 3′-UTR region of FasL led to the failure of miR-21 to repress FasL translation (Fig. 6D). These data suggest that FasL is a direct target of miR-21. To know whether the endogenous miR-21 can regulate FasL translation, the cells were transfected with the constructs of FasL 3′-UTR and then exposed to doxorubicin. Treatment with doxorubicin led to an elevation in the luciferase activity of wild type 3′-UTR but not the mutated 3′-UTR (Fig. 6E), suggesting that endogenous miR-21 can target FasL 3′-UTR. We finally tested whether miR-21 regulates FasL expression via targeting its 3′-UTR. FasL with wild type 3′-UTR expressed at a low level in the presence of miR-21. Introduction of mutations in the miR-21 binding site abolished the inhibitory effect of miR-21 on FasL expression (Fig. 6F). Taken together, it appears that miR-21 can inhibit the translation of FasL. The growing evidence has shown that miR-21 is an oncogenic miRNA and is highly expressed in a variety of malignant tumors (24Wang Y. Lee C.G. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2009; 13: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 25Krichevsky A.M. Gabriely G. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2009; 13: 39-53Crossref P"
https://openalex.org/W2127151795,"Adverse conditions in early life result in increased activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and in stress responsiveness in offspring. We have developed a model in which “donor” ewes are either normally nourished or overnourished prior to a period of dietary restriction, before transfer of the embryo at 6–7 d after conception to a ewe of normal weight and nutritional history. A moderate restriction of energy intake during the periconceptional period in both normal weight and overweight ewes resulted in increased adrenal mass in male and female lambs and an increased cortisol response to stress in female lambs. The increase in adrenal weight in lambs exposed to periconceptional under-nutrition was associated with a decrease in the adrenal mRNA expression of IGF2 and decreased methylation in the proximal CTCF-binding site in the differentially methylated region of the IGF2/H19 gene. Thus, weight loss in both normal and overweight mothers during the periconceptional period results in epigenetic modification of IGF2 in the adrenal gland, adrenal overgrowth, and increased vulnerability to stress in offspring. Determining the appropriate approach to weight loss in the periconceptional period may therefore be important in overweight or obese women seeking to become pregnant.—Zhang, S., Rattanatray, L., MacLaughlin, S.

https://openalex.org/W2133192672,"The intracellular amastigote stages of parasites such as Leishmania are often referred to as aflagellate. They do, however, possess a short axoneme of cryptic function. Here, our examination of the structure of this axoneme leads to a testable hypothesis of its role in the cell biology of pathogenicity. We show a striking similarity between the microtubule axoneme structure of the Leishmania mexicana parasite infecting a macrophage and vertebrate primary cilia. In both, the 9-fold microtubule doublet symmetry is broken by the incursion of one or more microtubule doublets into the axoneme core, giving rise to an architecture that we term here the 9v (variable) axoneme. Three-dimensional reconstructions revealed that no particular doublet initiated the symmetry break, and moreover it often involved 2 doublets. The tip of the L. mexicana flagellum was frequently intimately associated with the macrophage vacuole membrane. We propose that the main function of the amastigote flagellum is to act as a sensory organelle with important functions in host-parasite interactions and signaling in the intracellular stage of the L. mexicana life cycle.— Gluenz, E., Höög, J.

https://openalex.org/W2128676863,"Perceptual decisions can be made when sensory input affords an inference about what generated that input. Here, we report findings from two independent perceptual experiments conducted during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a sparse event-related design. The first experiment, in the visual modality, involved forced-choice discrimination of coherence in random dot kinematograms that contained either subliminal or periliminal motion coherence. The second experiment, in the auditory domain, involved free response detection of (non-semantic) near-threshold acoustic stimuli. We analysed fluctuations in ongoing neural activity, as indexed by fMRI, and found that neuronal activity in sensory areas (extrastriate visual and early auditory cortex) biases perceptual decisions towards correct inference and not towards a specific percept. Hits (detection of near-threshold stimuli) were preceded by significantly higher activity than both misses of identical stimuli or false alarms, in which percepts arise in the absence of appropriate sensory input. In accord with predictive coding models and the free-energy principle, this observation suggests that cortical activity in sensory brain areas reflects the precision of prediction errors and not just the sensory evidence or prediction errors per se."
https://openalex.org/W1983110775,"KLF4 (Krüppel-like factor 4) has been implicated in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation induced by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). However, the role of KLF4 and mechanism of KLF4 actions in regulating TGF-beta signaling in VSMCs remain unclear. In this study, we showed that TGF-beta1 inhibited cell cycle progression and induced differentiation in cultured rat VSMCs. This activity of TGF-beta1 was accompanied by up-regulation of KLF4, with concomitant increase in TbetaRI (TGF-beta type I receptor) expression. KLF4 was found to transduce TGF-beta1 signals via phosphorylation-mediated activation of Smad2, Smad3, and p38 MAPK. The activation of both pathways, in turn, increased the phosphorylation of KLF4, which enabled the formation of KLF4-Smad2 complex in response to TGF-beta1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies and oligonucleotide pull-down assays showed the direct binding of KLF4 to the KLF4-binding sites 2 and 3 of the TbetaRI promoter and the recruitment of Smad2 to the Smad-responsive region. Formation of a stable KLF4-Smad2 complex in the promoter's Smad-responsive region mediated cooperative TbetaRI promoter transcription in response to TGF-beta1. These results suggest that KLF4-dependent regulation of Smad and p38 MAPK signaling via TbetaRI requires prior phosphorylation of KLF4 through Smad and p38 MAPK pathways. This study demonstrates a novel mechanism by which TGF-beta1 regulates VSMC differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1975964180,"Akt signal transduction induces coordinated increases in glycolysis and apoptosis resistance in a broad spectrum of cancers. Downstream of Akt, the FoxO transcription factors regulate apoptosis via Bim, but the contributions of FoxOs in regulating Akt-induced glycolysis are not well described. We find that FoxO3a knockdown is sufficient to induce apoptosis resistance in conjunction with elevated glycolysis. Glycolysis in FoxO3a-deficient cells was associated with increased S6K1 phosphorylation and was sensitive to rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTORC1 pathway that has been linked to glycolysis regulation. We show that mTORC1-dependent glycolysis is increased in FoxO3a knockdown cells due to decreased expression of the TSC1 tumor suppressor that opposes mTORC1 activation. FoxO3a binds to and transactivates the TSC1 promoter, indicating a key role for FoxO3a in regulating TSC1 expression. Together, these data demonstrate that FoxO3a regulates glycolysis downstream of Akt through transcriptional control of Tsc1."
https://openalex.org/W1964996586,"The unidirectional translocation of messenger RNA (mRNA) through the aqueous channel of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by interactions between soluble mRNA export factors and distinct binding sites on the NPC. At the cytoplasmic side of the NPC, the conserved mRNA export factors Gle1 and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>) play an essential role in mRNA export by activating the ATPase activity of the DEAD-box protein Dbp5, promoting localized messenger ribonucleoprotein complex remodeling, and ensuring the directionality of the export process. In addition, Dbp5, Gle1, and IP<sub>6</sub> are also required for proper translation termination. However, the specificity of the IP<sub>6</sub>-Gle1 interaction <i>in vivo</i> is unknown. Here, we characterize the biochemical interaction between Gle1 and IP<sub>6</sub> and the relationship to Dbp5 binding and stimulation. We identify Gle1 residues required for IP<sub>6</sub> binding and show that these residues are needed for IP<sub>6</sub>-dependent Dbp5 stimulation <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Gle1 is the primary target of IP<sub>6</sub> for both mRNA export and translation termination <i>in vivo</i>. In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cells, the IP<sub>6</sub>-binding mutants recapitulate all of the mRNA export and translation termination defects found in mutants depleted of IP<sub>6</sub>. We conclude that Gle1 specifically binds IP<sub>6</sub> and that this interaction is required for the full potentiation of Dbp5 ATPase activity during both mRNA export and translation termination."
https://openalex.org/W2170439480,"Activation-induced cell death (AICD) is initiated by T-cell receptor (TCR) restimulation of already activated and expanded peripheral T cells and is mediated through Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) interactions. Adenosine is a purine nucleoside signaling molecule, and its immunomodulatory effects are mediated by 4 G-protein-coupled receptors: A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3). In this study, we investigated the role of A(2A) receptors in regulating CD4(+) T lymphocyte AICD. Our results showed that the selective A(2A) receptor agonist CGS21680 (EC(50)=15.2-32.6 nM) rescued mouse CD4(+) hybridomas and human Jurkat cells from AICD and that this effect was reversed by the selective A(2A) receptor antagonist ZM241385 (EC(50)=2.3 nM). CGS21680 decreased phosphatidylserine exposure on the membrane, as well as the cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-8 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase indicating that A(2A) receptor stimulation blocks the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. In addition, CGS21680 attenuated both Fas and FasL mRNA expression. This decrease in FasL expression was associated with decreased activation of the transcription factor systems NF-kappaB, NF-ATp, early growth response (Egr)-1, and Egr-3. The antiapoptotic effect of A(2A) receptor stimulation was mediated by protein kinase A. Together, these results demonstrate that A(2A) receptor activation suppresses the AICD of peripheral T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2160089607,"Choline dehydrogenase (CHDH) catalyzes the conversion of choline to betaine, an important methyl donor and organic osmolyte. We have previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human CHDH gene that, when present, seem to alter the activity of the CHDH enzyme. These SNPs occur frequently in humans. We created a Chdh−/− mouse to determine the functional effects of mutations that result in decreased CHDH activity. Chdh deletion did not affect fetal viability or alter growth or survival of these mice. Only one of eleven Chdh−/− males was able to reproduce. Loss of CHDH activity resulted in decreased testicular betaine and increased choline and PCho concentrations. Chdh+/+ and Chdh−/− mice produced comparable amounts of sperm; the impaired fertility was due to diminished sperm motility in the Chdh−/− males. Transmission electron microscopy revealed abnormal mitochondrial morphology in Chdh−/− sperm. ATP content, total mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity and inner mitochondrial membrane polarization were all significantly reduced in sperm from Chdh−/− animals. Mitochondrial changes were also detected in liver, kidney, heart, and testis tissues. We suggest that men who have SNPs in CHDH that decrease the activity of the CHDH enzyme could have decreased sperm motility and fertility.—Johnson, A. R., Craciunescu, C.

https://openalex.org/W2019168420,"Protein secretion and localization are crucial during eukaryotic development, establishing local cell environments as well as mediating cell interactions, signaling, and adhesion. In this study, we demonstrate that the glycosyltransferase, pgant3, specifically modulates integrin-mediated cell adhesion by influencing the secretion and localization of the integrin ligand, Tiggrin. We demonstrate that Tiggrin is normally O-glycosylated and localized to the basal matrix where the dorsal and ventral cell layers adhere in wild type Drosophila wings. In pgant3 mutants, Tiggrin is no longer O-glycosylated and fails to be properly secreted to this basal cell layer interface, resulting in disruption of integrin-mediated cell adhesion in the wing. pgant3-mediated effects are dependent on enzymatic activity, as mutations that form a stable protein yet abrogate O-glycosyltransferase activity result in Tiggrin accumulation within the dorsal and ventral cells comprising the wing. Our results provide the first in vivo evidence for the role of O-glycosylation in the secretion of specific extracellular matrix proteins, thus altering the composition of the cellular ""microenvironment"" and thereby modulating developmentally regulated cell adhesion events. As alterations in cell adhesion are a hallmark of cancer progression, this work provides insight into the long-standing association between aberrant O-glycosylation and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2167903187,"Children grow, but adults do not. The cessation of growth in multiple organs is the end result of a progressive decline in cell proliferation beginning in early life. The mechanisms responsible for this growth deceleration are largely unknown. Using expression microarray and real-time PCR, we identified a common program of gene expression in lung, kidney, and liver during growth deceleration in juvenile rats. Gene ontology analyses and siRNA-mediated knockdown in vitro indicated that many of the down-regulated genes are growth promoting. Down-regulated genes in the program showed declining histone H3K4 trimethylation with age, implicating underlying epigenetic mechanisms. To investigate the physiological processes driving the genetic program, a tryptophan-deficient diet was used to temporarily inhibit juvenile growth in newborn rats for 4 wk. Afterward, microarray analysis showed that the genetic program had been delayed, implying that it is driven by body growth itself rather than age. Taken together, the findings suggest that growth in early life induces progressive down-regulation of a large set of proliferation-stimulating genes, causing organ growth to slow and eventually cease.—Lui, J.

https://openalex.org/W2038710567,"Background Multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB) is an important nosocomial pathogen usually susceptible to carbapenems; however, growing number of imipenem resistant MDRAB (IR-MDRAB) poses further clinical challenge. The study was designed to identify the risk factors for appearance of IR-MDRAB on patients formerly with imipenem susceptible MDRAB (IS-MDRAB) and the impact on clinical outcomes. Methodology/Principal Findings A retrospective case control study was carried out for 209 consecutive episodes of IS-MDRAB infection or colonization from August 2001 to March 2005. Forty-nine (23.4%) episodes with succeeding clinical isolates of IR-MDRAB were defined as the cases and 160 (76.6%) with all subsequent clinical isolates of IS-MDRAB were defined as the controls. Quantified antimicrobial selective pressure, “time at risk”, severity of illness, comorbidity, and demographic data were incorporated for multivariate analysis, which revealed imipenem or meropenem as the only significant independent risk factor for the appearance of IR-MDRAB (adjusted OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.27). With selected cases and controls matched to exclude exogenous source of IR-MDRAB, multivariate analysis still identified carbapenem as the only independent risk factor (adjusted OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.92). Case patients had a higher crude mortality rate compared to control patients (57.1% vs. 31.3%, p = 0.001), and the mortality of case patients was associated with shorter duration of “time at risk”, i.e., faster appearance of IR-MDRAB (adjusted OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.98). Conclusions/Significance Judicious use of carbapenem with deployment of antibiotics stewardship measures is critical for reducing IR-MDRAB and the associated unfavorable outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2172285477,"In skeletal muscle, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) is a critical negative regulator of the MAPKs. Since the MAPKs have been reported to be both positive and negative for myogenesis, the physiological role of MKP-1 in skeletal muscle repair and regeneration has remained unclear. Here, we show that MKP-1 plays an essential role in adult regenerative myogenesis. In a cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury model, lack of MKP-1 impaired muscle regeneration. In mdx mice, MKP-1 deficiency reduced body weight, muscle mass, and muscle fiber cross-sectional area. In addition, MKP-1-deficient muscles exhibit exacerbated myopathy accompanied by increased inflammation. Lack of MKP-1 compromised myoblast proliferation and induced precocious differentiation, phenotypes that were rescued by pharmacological inhibition of p38alpha/beta MAPK. MKP-1 coordinates both myoblast proliferation and differentiation. Mechanistically, MyoD bound to the MKP-1 promoter and activated MKP-1 expression in proliferating myoblasts. Later, during myogenesis, MyoD uncoupled from the MKP-1 promoter leading to the down-regulation of MKP-1 and facilitation of promyogenic p38alpha/beta MAPK signaling. Hence, MKP-1 plays a critical role in muscle stem cells and in the immune response to coordinate muscle repair and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2038562003,"Previously we showed that Cool-1 (Cloned out of library-1)/β-Pix (Pak-interactive exchange factor) is phosphorylated at a specific tyrosine residue (Tyr-442) in a Src-dependent manner and serves as a dual function guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)/signaling-effector for Cdc42 that is essential for transformation by Src. Here, we show that knocking-down Cool-1 or overexpressing a Cool-1 mutant that contains substitutions within its Dbl homology domain and is defective for GEF activity, inhibits Src-promoted cell migration. Similarly, the expression of a Cool-1 mutant containing a tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution at position 442, making it incapable of being phosphorylated in response to serum, epidermal growth factor (EGF), or Src, also causes a significant inhibition of the migration and invasive activity of cells expressing oncogenic Src. We further demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Cool-1 at Tyr-442 weakens its ability to bind to one of its primary interaction-partners, Cat-1 (Cool-associated tyrosine phosphosubstrate-1)/Git-1 (G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interactor-1), thus making Cat more accessible for binding to paxillin. This enables cells to alternate between states where they contain large numbers of focal complexes (i.e. conditions favoring Cool-1-Cat interactions) versus reduced numbers of focal complexes (conditions favoring Cat-paxillin interactions). Overall, these findings show that the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of Cool-1 at Tyr-442 can serve as a key regulatory signal for focal complex assembly-disassembly, and consequently, for the migration and invasive activity of Src-transformed cells.

Adhesion sites known as focal contacts occur at the edges of cells where they mediate the attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix, thereby stabilizing the lamellipodium and contributing to efficient directional cell migration.

Cat functions as a GAP for the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-family of proteins, as well as binds to the focal complex protein paxillin (4Webb D.J. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Nat.

In the present study, we have examined the role of Cool-1 in the migration and invasive activity of Src-transformed cells. Various lines of evidence have implicated Src in the development of human cancers, where it not only plays an important role in stimulating cell proliferation, but also in promoting cell migration and invasion (47Yeatman T.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Given our earlier findings that showed Cool-1 was required for the transforming actions of Src, it seemed attractive to consider that Cool-1 has an important function in the ability of Src to promote cell motility and invasive activity. Indeed, we show here that Cool-1 contributes to the rapid migration of fibroblasts transformed by v-Src and that this is dependent on the GEF activity of Cool-1 and its ability to activate Cdc42. However, we also show that the phosphorylation of Cool-1 at Tyr-442 has a key role in the migration and invasive activity of these transformed cells. Interestingly, we further demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Cool-1 compromises its ability to bind to Cat, which in turn enables Cat to interact with paxillin, leading to a reduction in the size and numbers of focal complexes. On the other hand, conditions that do not promote the phosphorylation of Cool-1 enhance its ability to bind Cat and result in the formation of larger and increased numbers of focal complexes. Overall, these findings suggest a regulatory mechanism in which the phosphorylation-de-phosphorylation cycle of Cool-1 influences the dynamics of focal complex assembly and disassembly and in doing so, stimulates the migration and invasiveness of Src-transformed cells. Cell culture reagents, EGF, Lipofectamine, Lipofectamine 2000, Cool-1 siRNAs, and the control siRNA, as well as anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies, were purchased from Invitrogen. Vinculin and actin antibodies were from Neomarkers. The anti-Cool-1 antibody was obtained from Chemicon and the anti-Git-1(Cat-1) antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-PY (4G10) and anti-paxillin antibodies were from Millipore. NIH 3T3 and v-Src-transformed NIH 3T3 cell lines were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% calf serum (CS). The pcDNA3 constructs encoding the various forms of Cool-1 or Cat-1 were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine, whereas the control and Cool-1 siRNAs were introduced into cells using Lipofectamine 2000. The cells were then either fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde or lysed with cell lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaVO4, and 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Equal concentrations of each cell lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. The filters were incubated with the various primary antibodies diluted in TBST (20 mm Tris, 135 mm NaCl, and 0.02% Tween 20). Primary antibodies were then detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) followed by exposure to ECL reagent. Cell lysates were incubated with primary antibody for 1.5 h on ice followed by mixing with protein G-Sepharose beads (Invitrogen) for 1 h. The beads were washed (3×) with lysis buffer and then resuspended in 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min, followed by Western blot analysis. Cells fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde were permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and then blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 7% bovine serum albumin. Following blocking, the cells were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 2 h, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with either Oregon green- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for an additional hour. Where indicated, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to stain nuclei. The cells were then washed, mounted, and visualized using either the 40× or 63× objectives on a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescent microscope. Images were captured and processed using IPLAB. Assays for cell migration and invasion were performed as previously described (48Valster A. Tran N.L. Nakada M. Berens M.E. Chan A.Y. Symons M. Methods. 2005; 37: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 49Hanna J. Goldman-Wohl D. Hamani Y. Avraham I. Greenfield C. Natanson-Yaron S. Prus D. Cohen-Daniel L. Arnon T.I. Manaster I.

For migration assays, v-Src-transformed NIH 3T3 cells that had been transfected with control or Cool-1 siRNAs, Cool-1 constructs, or Cat-1 constructs, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 0.2% calf serum (CS) and seeded at 10,000 cells/well in the upper chamber of a Millicell Culture Plate Insert (Millipore). DMEM medium containing 0.2% CS and 0.1 μg/ml EGF was added to the lower chamber, and the cultures were maintained for 3 h. The cells that accumulated on the lower side of the filter were fixed with methanol, stained with Giemsa stain, and then scored. For invasion assays, the Millicell Culture Plate Insert was pre-coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and the cultures were maintained for 12 h. Both the migration and invasion assays were performed three times, and the results from these experiments were averaged. Cells were subjected to Dounce homogenization in 1 ml of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm sucrose, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The nuclei and cell debris were removed from the homogenate by centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 75 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was solubilized in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 1 h at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin was added to the solubilized membrane samples prior to storage at −80 °C. There have been a number of reports suggesting that the Cool/Pix proteins localize to focal complexes and are important for cell migration (34Lucanic M. Cheng H.J.

Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Because Cool-1 plays a key role in the transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by v-Src (32Feng Q. Baird D. Peng X. Wang J. Ly T. Guan J.L. Cerione R.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we were interested in seeing whether Cool-1 is important for the ability of these transformed cells to migrate and exhibit invasive activity. Fig. 1 shows that knocking-down Cool-1 expression using two different siRNAs caused a 50–60% reduction in the rate of migration of v-Src-transformed cells. The Cool-1 protein contains tandem Dbl homology (DH) and Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains that are characteristics of GEFs for Cdc42, Rac, and other Rho-family GTPases (22Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G.

Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Previously, we had shown that Cool-1 acts as a Cdc42-specific GEF following its growth factor- and Src/FAK-dependent phosphorylation at Tyr-442 (32Feng Q. Baird D. Peng X. Wang J. Ly T. Guan J.L. Cerione R.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). By changing two conserved leucine residues (Leu-383 and Leu-384) within the DH domain to arginine and serine, respectively, we generated a Cool-1 double-mutant (designated as Cool-1 DHm) that is defective for GEF activity (30Feng Q. Baird D. Cerione R.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3492-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 31Baird D. Feng Q. Cerione R.A. Curr.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6047-6050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that when we overexpressed Cool-1 DHm in v-Src-transformed cells, their ability to migrate was inhibited, compared with cells that were transfected with control vector. Similarly, the rate of migration of v-Src-transformed cells was reduced upon the overexpression of the dominant-negative Cdc42 T17N mutant that is incapable of undergoing guanine nucleotide exchange (designated as Cdc42 N17 in Fig. 2). Together, these results indicated that Cool-1 is indeed important for Src-transformed cells to achieve their maximal rates of migration (also, see below) and that its ability to activate Cdc42 contributes to this function. Cool-1 is phosphorylated at Tyr-442 when NIH 3T3 cells are treated with serum (see below) or with EGF (32Feng Q. Baird D. Peng X. Wang J. Ly T. Guan J.L. Cerione R.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Cool-1 in NIH 3T3 cells is transient such that it is maximal within 10 min (32Feng Q. Baird D. Peng X. Wang J. Ly T. Guan J.L. Cerione R.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and fully reversed by 45 min (Fig. 3A). However, in v-Src-transformed cells, the phosphorylation of either endogenous Cool-1 (Fig. 3B) or ectopically expressed Myc-tagged Cool-1 (Fig. 3C) is observed in the absence of added EGF, as well as through 90 min of growth factor treatment, and plays an important role in the transforming activity of v-Src (32Feng Q. Baird D. Peng X. Wang J. Ly T. Guan J.L. Cerione R.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that the overexpression of the phosphorylation-defective Cool-1 Y442F mutant resulted in a significant reduction in the migration of v-Src-transformed cells, compared with the lack of an effect upon the overexpression of wild-type Cool-1 (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, the overexpression of the Cool-1 Y442F mutant in control NIH 3T3 cells had little effect on their rate of migration (supplemental Fig. S1), which is slower compared with Src-transformed cells. This suggests that the phosphorylation of Cool-1 is important for the enhanced rate of migration exhibited by transformed cells. The overexpression of Cool-1 Y442F in v-Src-transformed cells also markedly inhibited their invasive activity, whereas again the overexpression of wild-type Cool-1 lacked a significant effect (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4The phosphorylation of Cool-1 is important for the migration and invasive activity of v-Src-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. A, viral-Src-transformed NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with empty vector (control), Myc-tagged wild-type Cool-1, or the Cool-1 Y442F mutant.

Baird D. Peng X. Wang J. Ly T. Guan J.L. Cerione R.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the inhibitory effects of the Cool-1 Y442F mutant are consistent with the idea that the activation of Cdc42 contributes to the role played by Cool-1 in the migration and invasive activity of Src-transformed cells. They also suggest that the Cool-1 Y442F mutant is capable of acting as a dominant-negative inhibitor, most likely through its ability to bind and sequester a Cool-1 binding partner that has an important role in v-Src-stimulated cell migration and invasion. A possible clue as to how Cool-1 Y442F might be exerting its inhibitory effects came from the general appearance of v-Src-cells overexpressing the Cool-1 Y442F mutant, as they were flat and more adherent compared with v-Src cells expressing the vector control (supplemental Fig. S2). This suggested that the overexpression of the phosphorylation-defective Cool-1 mutant might be stabilizing focal complexes. A further examination indicated that this was the case. Treatment of NIH 3T3 cells with EGF led to the loss of focal complexes that was evident within 30 min (Fig. 5A). Similarly, EGF caused cells overexpressing wild-type Cool-1 to round-up and to lose their focal complexes, whereas NIH 3T3 cells expressing the phosphorylation-defective Cool-1 Y442F mutant were more attached and retained their focal complexes (Fig. 5, B–D). Given that the Cat/Git proteins, which are primary binding partners of Cool-1, localize to focal complexes and play important roles in cell-spreading and attachment (42Manabe R. Kovalenko M.

Previous studies have shown that zebrafish Dnd functions by protecting the 3′UTRs of nanosl and TDRD7 from miR-430b-mediated RNA deadenylation. In this work, we demonstrate that zebrafish Dnd protein possesses Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity that is required for PGC formation. Michaelis-Menten analysis revealed that the ATPase has a kcat of 0.632 ± 0.036/min under optimal conditions, and mapping studies using Dnd truncates showed that ATPase resides in the last 91 aa of the Dnd C terminus. Internal deletion and point mutagenesis analysis of this region were used to identify key amino acids required for ATPase activity. Rescue experiments conducted by injecting mRNAs encoding the Dnd ATPase mutants into embryos in which the endogenous dnd expression was inhibited demonstrated that the ATPase activity is required for normal zebrafish PGC survival. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression of PGC markers nanos1 and TDRD7 but not vasa were down-regulated when dnd mutant proteins lacking ATPase were expressed in the rescued embryos, indicating that the Dnd ATPase is involved in protecting nanos1 and TDRD7 transcripts.—Liu, W., Collodi, P.

Opportunities and obstacles in the development of such drug response biomarkers are discussed here. To stem the spiraling cost of cancer treatment, a concerted effort is urgently needed to develop molecular diagnostics to better identify the patients that respond to expensive targeted therapies. Opportunities and obstacles in the development of such drug response biomarkers are discussed here. In the United States, approximately 30% of total health care costs for an individual are incurred in the last year of life (Earle and Schrag, 2008Earle C.C. Schrag D. Principles of health services research.in: DeVita V. Lawrence T. Rosenberg S. DeVita, Hellman and Rosenberg's Cancer: Principles & Practice of Oncology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2008: 369-384Google Scholar). Terminal cancer patients with metastatic disease are treated with expensive “targeted” therapies, often costing tens of thousands of dollars with minimal survival benefit. If we take the cost and clinical benefit of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting drug cetuximab in lung cancer as a standard, it would cost $440 billion to extend by one year the life of all Americans who die of cancer annually (Fojo and Grady, 2009Fojo T. Grady C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2009; 101: 1044-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In the past, the pharmaceutical industry has predominantly been focused on the development of ever newer and better cancer drugs, without paying sufficient attention to the identification of the (often small) fraction of patients that respond to their drugs. It will require a disruptive innovation, a radically new approach to the way we diagnose and treat cancer, to stem the spiraling cost of care for cancer patients. A critical aspect of this more individualized approach to cancer therapy will be the development of biological indicators (biomarkers) that help identify those patients that are most likely to respond to these expensive therapies. We now understand why it is so hard to win the war on cancer. Cancer results from the sequential acquisition of a number of genetic alterations, and these mutations are often distinct in tumors that appear very similar when examined through conventional diagnostics. This molecular heterogeneity represents a major obstacle to the effective treatment of cancer and requires the development of new classes of biomarkers to separate these apparently similar tumors into distinct subgroups that differ in response to therapy. There are three types of clinically relevant biomarkers: prognostic biomarkers (that predict disease outcome without further treatment), predictive biomarkers (that foretell response to a specific therapy), and pharmacodynamic biomarkers (that help decide on the optimal dose of a drug for an individual patient). A biomarker can be both prognostic and predictive, a good example being the estrogen receptor in breast cancer. Estrogen receptor-positive tumors have in general a more favorable outcome and are more often responsive to hormonal therapy. Moreover, if a biomarker identifies one group of patients having negligible risk of disease recurrence and a second group that has almost all of the risk of disease progression, obviously the latter group will also receive nearly all of the benefits of additional (adjuvant) therapy, yielding a combined prognostic/predictive biomarker. There are only a few clinically useful biomarkers that predict the response of a cancer to conventional chemotherapy. However, it is likely that this is very different for biomarkers of response to the newer classes of “targeted therapeutics”—drugs that specifically act on signaling pathways that are active in the cancer cell or the surrounding stroma. For instance, the analysis of cancer genotypes by selected sequencing of cancer genomes has identified strong correlations between the presence of the oncogenic BCR-ABL translocation in leukemia and responses to the drug imatinib mesylate (see Review by A. Nussenzweig and M.C. Nussenzweig on page 27 of this issue). Similarly, the presence of mutations in EGFR is correlated with responses to small-molecule inhibitors of its activity. For a list of associations between genotypes and responses to kinase-inhibitory drugs, see Janne et al., 2009Janne P.A. Gray N. Settleman J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 709-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar and Sawyers, 2008Sawyers C.L. Nature. 2008; 452: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar. Many of these relationships between genetic alterations and responses to drugs can be explained by “oncogene addiction”—an acquired dependency of tumors on persistent signaling through a given activated signaling pathway—as sudden inhibition of this signaling by drug treatment can cause cell death (Weinstein and Joe, 2006Weinstein I.B. Joe A.K. Nat. Clin. Pract. Oncol. 2006; 3: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Such correlations between genotype and drug response are especially straightforward to identify when the mutant allele is either a direct target of the drug or a component of the signaling pathway targeted by the drug. A variety of methods are readily available for identifying structural alterations in genes of major signaling pathways, including next generation sequencing and comparative genomic hybridization (Pinkel and Albertson, 2005Pinkel D. Albertson D.G. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2005; 6: 331-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, Stratton et al., 2009Stratton M.R. Campbell P.J. Futreal P.A. Nature. 2009; 458: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). Biomarker discovery becomes challenging when there are no likely suspects to consider. This is the case for antiangiogenic drugs, like bevacizumab, or for “multikinase” inhibitory drugs, like dasatinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib, for which it is often not clear which of the multiple targets is primarily responsible for their anticancer effects. Biomarkers of drug responsiveness are most readily discovered through analysis of the tumor itself. There are at least three major obstacles in the discovery of drug response biomarkers from tumor tissue. The first relates to the preservation of tumor tissue, which in most hospitals relies on formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE). Although this mode of tissue preservation is suitable for conventional routine diagnostics, such as microscopic grading (that is, determining the histological grade of the tumor) and immunohistochemistry, it severely affects the integrity of the RNA and (phospho)proteins that can serve as potential biomarkers of drug responses. Tissue collection in clinical trials is caught in a “catch 22”: either one collects FFPE tissue, which is easy but restricts molecular analysis of biomarkers, or one collects fresh tissue, which provides more valuable material but may slow patient recruitment in community hospitals due to the more complex logistics. Cancer biomarker development will therefore not come of age until the value of fresh tissue collection is engraved in the minds of a new generation of molecular pathologists. In the mean time, existing technologies can be optimized to extract as much relevant biomarker information as possible out of FFPE-fixed tissues (see, for example, Hoshida et al., 2008Hoshida Y. Villanueva A. Kobayashi M. Peix J. Chiang D.Y. Camargo A. Gupta S. Moore J. Wrobel M.J. Lerner J. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 359: 1995-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). A second problem is that most early stage (phase II) clinical trials, in which biomarkers are typically discovered, enroll patients with metastatic disease. This often limits access to tumor tissue through biopsies due to the anatomical locations of the metastases. A potential solution is the use of noninvasive technologies to assess tumor biomarkers. For example, collecting circulating tumor cells can be an alternative to tissue biopsies, but the numbers of cells present in the circulation is often very small (Pantel et al., 2009Pantel K. Alix-Panabieres C. Riethdorf S. Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2009; 6: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Alternatively, tumor genotype can be assessed through the analysis of DNA in serum, which is shed by tumor cell lysis. The use of next generation sequencing may make it feasible to mine detailed information on copy number gains, losses, or mutations from analysis of tumor DNA in serum from cancer patients (Chiu et al., 2008Chiu R.W. Chan K.C. Gao Y. Lau V.Y. Zheng W. Leung T.Y. Foo C.H. Xie B. Tsui N.B. Lun F.M. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 20458-20463Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, Thomas et al., 2007Thomas R.K. Baker A.C. Debiasi R.M. Winckler W. Laframboise T. Lin W.M. Wang M. Feng W. Zander T. MacConaill L. et al.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). A third major factor limiting efficient biomarker discovery is access to sufficient patient samples. An unbiased genome-wide search for association between gene expression and disease outcome requires at least 40 patients whose cancer responds to treatment and an equal number of nonresponders, as smaller sample sizes will lead to spurious associations between gene activity and disease outcome. Most phase II clinical trials do not have sufficient drug responders to allow such unbiased biomarker discovery. There are several potential solutions to this problem. First, the number of patients in the trial can be greatly increased, which is time consuming and expensive. Alternatively, one can identify drug response signatures by correlating drug responsiveness of a large panel of cancer cell lines with their pattern of gene expression in vitro (Neve et al., 2006Neve R.M. Chin K. Fridlyand J. Yeh J. Baehner F.L. Fevr T. Clark L. Bayani N. Coppe J.P. Tong F. et al.Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 515-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar). However, it is too early to tell whether such in vitro-derived drug response signatures will have clinical utility. Finally, to minimize the chance of false associations, one can survey only a limited number of genes in the phase II clinical trial samples by preselecting candidate drug response biomarkers in appropriate preclinical models using functional genetics (see below). Many of the events that contribute to cancer pathogenesis are epigenetic rather than genetic. Such epigenetic modifications lead to alterations in gene expression and hence to changes in cellular behavior, including responses to cancer drugs. Important information about drug responses can therefore be gleaned from analysis of gene expression patterns in cancer (van't Veer and Bernards, 2008van't Veer L.J. Bernards R. Nature. 2008; 452: 564-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). But of these genes, which are critical determinants of responsiveness to a given cancer drug? As pointed out above, unbiased discovery by full genome surveys is often not an option because the tumor samples available are insufficient. Functional genetic screens in mammalian cells help to fill this gap. The development of efficient tools to perform functional genetic screens in mammalian cells has enabled the discovery of genes that play a critical part in specific cellular processes, including responses to cancer drugs. Genetic screens, pioneered in model organisms, provide the most unbiased approach to identify genes that act in a biological process. Two types of genetic screen can be carried out in mammalian cells today. In “gain-of-function” screens sets of genes are ectopically expressed to ask which genes, when overexpressed, can modulate a biological process (Figure 1A ). Conversely, RNA interference has enabled “loss-of-function” genetic screens in mammalian cells. In this type of screen, large sets of genes are either suppressed short term by synthetic small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or long term through vector-encoded shRNAs, and the effects on specific biological processes are monitored. To find biomarkers of drug responses, stable suppression of gene expression by short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) has the advantage that it allows the use of more physiological drug concentrations because drug responses can be monitored over longer periods of time. A particularly elegant iteration of the loss-of-function screen is the shRNA barcode screen, which enables the identification of all genes whose suppression can cause alterations in drug responsiveness in a single experiment (Figure 1B). Because of the very nature of the genetic screens, the relationships between responses to cancer drugs and gene expression are causal rather than correlative (as is for instance the case when microarray analyses are performed). Consequently, genes identified in genetic screens are strong candidates to foretell responses to the same drugs in the clinic. Indeed, in several cases genetic screens have yielded drug response biomarkers that could subsequently be validated in clinical samples from patients treated with the same drug. For instance, a shRNA barcode screen identified the tumor suppressor gene PTEN as a critical determinant of resistance of breast cancer to trastuzumab, an antibody that targets human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Subsequent analysis of some 50 tumor samples from patients treated with trastuzumab confirmed the clinical utility of the phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-PTEN pathway as a biomarker to predict trastuzumab responses in breast cancer (Berns et al., 2007Berns K. Horlings H.M. Hennessy B.T. Madiredjo M. Hijmans E.M. Beelen K. Linn S.C. Gonzalez-Angulo A.M. Stemke-Hale K. Hauptmann M. et al.Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 395-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Note that the number of tumor samples required for the initial clinical validation of this biomarker is typically available from a phase II trial. Similarly, a single-well siRNA screen targeting all known and putative kinases identified CDK10 as a gene whose suppression can confer resistance to the anti-hormonal drug tamoxifen in breast cancer cells. Here too, low CDK10 expression is associated with clinical resistance to tamoxifen (Iorns et al., 2008Iorns E. Turner N.C. Elliott R. Syed N. Garrone O. Gasco M. Tutt A.N. Crook T. Lord C.J. Ashworth A. Cancer Cell. 2008; 13: 91-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Obviously, at this point such biomarkers are only candidates, which require validation in specifically designed prospective clinical studies. A clinical trial to assess the validity of the PI3K pathway as a predictor of the trastuzumab response is currently underway (Tomasello et al., 2008Tomasello G. de Azambuja E. Dinh P. Snoj N. Piccart-Gebhart M. Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2008; 8: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A relatively recent concept in the treatment of cancer is that of “synthetic lethality”—a situation in which a combination of two nonlethal mutations results in cell death (Hartwell et al., 1997Hartwell L.H. Szankasi P. Roberts C.J. Murray A.W. Friend S.H. Science. 1997; 278: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Synthetic lethality results from the fact that the acquisition of mutations also comes at a cost for the cancer cell, as the ability to respond to specific perturbations may be affected when certain regulatory circuits have been rendered defective by mutation. Knowledge of synthetic lethal interactions can therefore provide insights into the “Achilles' heel” of a cancer cell—the spot where hitting it with a targeted drug hurts the most. Loss-of-function genetic screens represent an excellent tool to identify such synthetic lethal interactions (Kaelin, 2005Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Although most people will consider synthetic lethality to be useful to identify new classes of cancer drug targets, it can also be used to identify potential drug response biomarkers. In such chemical synthetic lethality screens, one searches for genes whose suppression increases the sensitivity of cells to a cancer drug. Perhaps the most salient example of a chemical synthetic lethal interaction, although not discovered through a genetic screen, is the exquisite sensitivity of tumors harboring a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation to olaparib, a small-molecule inhibitor of poly [ADP]-ribose polymerase (PARP) (Farmer et al., 2005Farmer H. McCabe N. Lord C.J. Tutt A.N. Johnson D.A. Richardson T.B. Santarosa M. Dillon K.J. Hickson I. Knights C. et al.Nature. 2005; 434: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (4056) Google Scholar, Fong et al., 2009Fong P.C. Boss D.S. Yap T.A. Tutt A. Wu P. Mergui-Roelvink M. Mortimer P. Swaisland H. Lau A. O'Connor M.J. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2705) Google Scholar). Knowledge of synthetic lethal interactions can also suggest powerful drug combinations if the pathway that is synthetic lethal with a drug can be inhibited by another drug. Thus, screening for genes that confer a synthetic lethal phenotype in combination with an experimental cancer drug may yield clues to the most responsive patient population. In many types of cancer, the same signaling pathway is frequently targeted by mutation, but the components of the pathway that are mutated are not always the same. For instance, in breast cancer the PI3K-PTEN pathway can be activated by amplification of HER2, mutation of PIK3CA (the catalytic subunit of phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase), loss of its antagonist PTEN, or mutation of AKT1, and additional mechanisms of activation of this pathway may yet exist. In colon cancer for instance, 70% of patients fail to respond to EGFR inhibitory drugs, whereas only 30%–40% of this nonresponsiveness is explained by mutation of KRAS (Amado et al., 2008Amado R.G. Wolf M. Peeters M. Van Cutsem E. Siena S. Freeman D.J. Juan T. Sikorski R. Suggs S. Radinsky R. et al.J. Clin. Oncol. 2008; 26: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2644) Google Scholar). It would therefore be beneficial to have “pathway activation biomarkers” that measure activation of a pathway, as such biomarkers do not require a compete knowledge of all the possible ways in which a pathway can become activated during oncogenesis. Such pathway activation markers can consist of phospho-specific antibodies that measure activation of a downstream component of a signaling cascade, which can be measured in high throughput using protein lysate arrays (Spurrier et al., 2008Spurrier B. Ramalingam S. Nishizuka S. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1796-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Alternatively, pathway activation can be monitored by measuring the transcriptional output of a signaling pathway, as activation of each pathway leads to a characteristic set of alterations in gene expression (Bild et al., 2006Bild A.H. Yao G. Chang J.T. Wang Q. Potti A. Chasse D. Joshi M.B. Harpole D. Lancaster J.M. Berchuck A. et al.Nature. 2006; 439: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). Such pathway activation signatures may have utility to guide the choice of therapy (Lee et al., 2007Lee J.K. Havaleshko D.M. Cho H. Weinstein J.N. Kaldjian E.P. Karpovich J. Grimshaw A. Theodorescu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 13086-13091Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, Potti et al., 2006Potti A. Dressman H.K. Bild A. Riedel R.F. Chan G. Sayer R. Cragun J. Cottrill H. Kelley M.J. Petersen R. et al.Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 1294-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). A potential complication in using these pathway activation biomarkers is that they often cannot inform whether activation of the pathway results from an upstream event or from more downstream activation. The point at which a signaling pathway is activated can dramatically influence the response to a pathway-inhibitory drug. For instance, elevated levels of the ligands for EGFR predict favorable responses to EGFR antibody drugs in colon cancer, but downstream mutations in KRAS are associated with nonresponsiveness. Biomarkers of pathway activation may yield similar results in both cases (Amado et al., 2008Amado R.G. Wolf M. Peeters M. Van Cutsem E. Siena S. Freeman D.J. Juan T. Sikorski R. Suggs S. Radinsky R. et al.J. Clin. Oncol. 2008; 26: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2644) Google Scholar, Khambata-Ford et al., 2007Khambata-Ford S. Garrett C.R. Meropol N.J. Basik M. Harbison C.T. Wu S. Wong T.W. Huang X. Takimoto C.H. Godwin A.K. et al.J. Clin. Oncol. 2007; 25: 3230-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, with pathway-targeted therapy becoming increasingly used in cancer, the need to describe tumors by the pathways that drive the oncogenic process will increase accordingly. Pathway activation biomarkers can play a crucial part in this transition. Historically, pharmaceutical companies have not been keen to develop biomarkers of drug responsiveness. A fear of reducing the market for their drugs by identifying a large fraction of patients that are unlikely to benefit from therapy has certainly been a factor. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that drug response biomarkers can also expand the number of eligible patients for a drug. For instance, inhibitors of the anaplastic leukemia kinase (ALK) show promise for the treatment of neuroblastomas, as these tumors can carry ALK amplifications or mutations that activate ALK. Importantly, between 3% and 13% (depending on the populations studied) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors harbor an EML4-ALK translocation, and in preclinical models it is particularly this group of NSCLCs that is also exquisitely sensitive to these ALK inhibitors (Koivunen et al., 2008Koivunen J.P. Mermel C. Zejnullahu K. Murphy C. Lifshits E. Holmes A.J. Choi H.G. Kim J. Chiang D. Thomas R. et al.Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 4275-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Biomarkers of drug responsiveness are therefore not only a threat but also an opportunity for drug developers. Patients only stand to benefit from biomarkers, as biomarkers enable the selection of the most effective therapy upfront, sparing them the considerable toxicity associated with the conventional “trial and error” therapy choice. Molecular diagnostics will increasingly be used to classify tumors according to the pathways that act as drivers of the oncogenic process rather than the tissue of origin. Such molecular tumor classification schemes will therefore be very helpful in selecting the appropriate pathway inhibitor for the individual patient. Co-development of drugs together with a companion diagnostic that identifies the likely responders is the logical way forward. Such companion diagnostics are most quickly developed in neo-adjuvant clinical trials, a setting in which the drug is given prior to surgery, as drug responses are almost immediately visible. Biomarker validation will be greatly helped by a new type of clinical trial, so-called “adaptive” trials. In such trials, evidence is collected to either prove or disprove a given biomarker-driven hypothesis. Treatment regimens that show a high probability of being more effective than standard therapy will graduate from the trial with their corresponding biomarkers. Adaptive clinical trials like I-SPY2 for breast cancer will become the new paradigm for co-development of drugs and diagnostics (Barker et al., 2009Barker A.D. Sigman C.C. Kelloff G.J. Hylton N.M. Berry D.A. Esserman L.J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2009; 86: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Given that a poor biomarker can be just as bad for the patient as a bad drug, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced its intention to also regulate clinically used biomarkers. This will require a regulatory trajectory for biomarkers that is not too dissimilar from what is currently in place for drugs, including well-designed clinical studies and appropriate quality control. Development of well-validated biomarkers will therefore take considerable effort, and most pharma companies currently lack the relevant expertise to do this. A tripartite partnership between pharma, biotech, and academia will be required to secure a more rapid transition to a more personalized treatment based on detailed insights into the specific defects of each individual cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2065191163,"Ageing, immunity and stresstolerance are inherent characteristics of all organisms. In animals, these traits are regulated, at least in part, by forkhead transcription factors in response to upstream signals from the Insulin/Insulin-like growth factor signalling (IIS) pathway. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, these phenotypes are molecularly linked such that activation of the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16 both extends lifespan and simultaneously increases immunity and stress resistance. It is known that lifespan varies significantly among the Caenorhabditis species but, although DAF-16 signalling is highly conserved, it is unclear whether this phenotypic linkage occurs in other species. Here we investigate this phenotypic covariance by comparing longevity, stress resistance and immunity in four Caenorhabditis species.We show using phenotypic analysis of DAF-16 influenced phenotypes that among four closely related Caenorhabditis nematodes, the gonochoristic species (Caenorhabditis remanei and Caenorhabditis brenneri) have diverged significantly with a longer lifespan, improved stress resistance and higher immunity than the hermaphroditic species (C. elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae). Interestingly, we also observe significant differences in expression levels between the daf-16 homologues in these species using Real-Time PCR, which positively correlate with the observed phenotypes. Finally, we provide additional evidence in support of a role for DAF-16 in regulating phenotypic coupling by using a combination of wildtype isolates, constitutively active daf-16 mutants and bioinformatic analysis.The gonochoristic species display a significantly longer lifespan (p<0.0001) and more robust immune and stress response (p<0.0001, thermal stress; p<0.01, heavy metal stress; p<0.0001, pathogenic stress) than the hermaphroditic species. Our data suggests that divergence in DAF-16 mediated phenotypes may underlie many of the differences observed between these four species of Caenorhabditis nematodes. These findings are further supported by the correlative higher daf-16 expression levels among the gonochoristic species and significantly higher lifespan, immunity and stress tolerance in the constitutively active daf-16 hermaphroditic mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2169740177,"In previous studies, we identified a locus for schizophrenia on 6q23.3 and proposed the Abelson helper integration site 1 (AHI1) as the candidate gene. AHI1 is expressed in the brain and plays a key role in neurodevelopment, is involved in Joubert syndrome, and has been recently associated with autism. The neurodevelopmental role of AHI1 fits with etiological hypotheses of schizophrenia. To definitively confirm our hypothesis, we searched for associations using a dense map of the region. Our strongest findings lay within the AHI1 gene: single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs11154801 and rs7759971 showed significant associations (P=6.23E-06; P=0.84E-06) and haplotypes gave P values in the 10E-8 to 10E-10 range. The second highest significant region maps close to AHI1 and includes the intergenic region between BC040979 and PDE7B (rs2038549 at P=9.70E-06 and rs1475069 at P=6.97E-06), and PDE7B and MAP7. Using a sample of Palestinian Arab families to confirm these findings, we found isolated signals. While these results did not retain their significance after correction for multiple testing, the joint analysis across the 2 samples supports the role of AHI1, despite the presence of heterogeneity. Given the hypothesis of positive selection of schizophrenia genes, we resequenced a 11 kb region within AHI1 in ethnically defined populations and found evidence for a selective sweep. Network analysis indicates 2 haplotype clades, with schizophrenia-susceptibility haplotypes clustering within the major clade. In conclusion, our data support the role of AHI1 as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia and confirm it has been subjected to positive selection, also shedding light on new possible candidate genes, MAP7 and PDE7B."

The AGC kinase Adi3 functions to suppress host cell death and interacts with Pto only in the presence of AvrPto. The cell death suppression (CDS) activity of Adi3 requires phosphorylation by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (Pdk1) and loss of Adi3 function is associated with the hypersensitive response cell death initiated by the Pto/AvrPto interaction. Here we studied the relationship between Adi3 cellular localization and its CDS activity. Adi3 is a nuclear-localized protein, and this localization is dictated by a nuclear localization signal found in the Adi3 T-loop extension, an ∼80 amino acid insertion into the T-loop, or activation loop, which is phosphorylated for kinase activation. Nuclear localization of Adi3 is required for its CDS activity and loss of nuclear localization causes elimination of Adi3 CDS activity and induction of cell death. This nuclear localization of Adi3 is dependent on Ser-539 phosphorylation by Pdk1 and non-nuclear Adi3 is found in punctate structures throughout the cell.

https://openalex.org/W2018628319,"Regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) inhibits the protein phosphatase calcineurin and is required for appropriate immune responses, synaptic plasticity, vascular tone, angiogenesis, and cardiac remodeling. Expression of the RCAN1-4 isoform is under the control of the calcineurin-responsive transcription factor NFAT. Typically, NFATs act in cooperation with other transcription factors to achieve maximal activation of gene expression. In this study, we identify the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) as an NFAT binding partner that cooperates with NFAT to regulate RCAN1-4 expression. Numerous C/EBPbeta binding sites are conserved in the RCAN1-4 proximal promoter. Overexpression of C/EBPbeta increased activity of both the endogenous mouse Rcan1-4 gene and a human RCAN1-4 luciferase reporter. Binding of C/EBPbeta to multiple sites in the promoter was verified using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation. A direct interaction between C/EBPbeta and NFAT was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of proteins and complex formation at NFAT-C/EBPbeta composite sites. Depletion of endogenous C/EBPbeta decreased maximal activation of RCAN1-4 expression by calcineurin, whereas inhibition of calcineurin did not alter the ability of C/EBPbeta to activate RCAN1-4 expression. Together, these findings suggest that calcineurin/NFAT activation of RCAN1-4 expression is in part dependent upon C/EBPbeta, whereas activation by C/EBPbeta is not dependent on calcineurin and may provide a calcineurin-independent pathway for regulating RCAN1-4 expression. Importantly, nuclear localization, C/EBPbeta DNA binding activity and occupancy of the Rcan1-4 promoter increased in mouse models of heart failure demonstrating in vivo activation of this pathway to regulate Rcan1-4 expression and ultimately shape the dynamics of calcineurin-dependent signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2156263976,"5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-4-ribofuranoside (AICAR), an analog of AMP, is widely used as an activator of AMP-kinase (AMPK), a protein that regulates the responses of the cell to energy change. We studied the effects of AICAR on the growth of retinoblastoma cell lines (Y79, WERI, and RB143). AICAR inhibited Rb cell growth, induced apoptosis and S-phase cell cycle arrest, and led to activation of AMPK. These effects were abolished by treatment with dypiridamole, an inhibitor that blocks entrance of AICAR into cells. Treatment with the adenosine kinase inhibitor 5-iodotubericidin to inhibit the conversion of AICAR to ZMP (the direct activator of AMPK) reversed most of the growth-inhibiting effects of AICAR, indicating that some of the antiproliferative effects of AICAR are mediated through AMPK activation. In addition, AICAR treatment was associated with inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, decreased phosphorylation of ribosomal protein-S6 and 4E-BP1, down-regulation of cyclins A and E, and decreased expression of p21. Our results indicate that AICAR-induced activation of AMPK inhibits retinoblastoma cell growth.

https://openalex.org/W1964932440,"In neural stem cells, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) promote cell proliferation and self-renewal. In the bFGF- and EGF-responsive neural stem cells, beta1-integrin also plays important roles in crucial cellular processes, including proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. The cross-talk of the signaling pathways mediated by these growth factors and beta1-integrin, however, has not been fully elucidated. Here we report a novel molecular mechanism through which bFGF or EGF promotes the proliferation of mouse neuroepithelial cells (NECs). In the NECs, total beta1-integrin expression levels and proliferation were dose-dependently increased by bFGF but not by EGF. EGF rather than bFGF strongly induced the increase of beta1-integrin localization on the NEC surface. bFGF- and EGF-induced beta1-integrin up-regulation and proliferation were inhibited after treatment with a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor, U0126, which indicates the dependence on the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Involvement of beta1-integrin in bFGF- and EGF-induced proliferation was confirmed by the finding that NEC proliferation and adhesion to fibronectin-coated dishes were inhibited by knockdown of beta1-integrin using small interfering RNA. On the other hand, apoptosis was induced in NECs treated with RGD peptide, a small beta1-integrin inhibitor peptide with the Arg-Gly-Asp motif, but it was independent of beta1-integrin expression levels. Those results suggest that regulation of beta1-integrin expression/localization is involved in cellular processes, such as proliferation, induced by bFGF and EGF in NECs. The mechanism underlying the proliferation through beta1-integrin would not be expected to be completely identical, however, for bFGF and EGF."
https://openalex.org/W2076507895,"The silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) serves as a corepressor for nuclear receptors and other factors. Recent evidence suggests that SMRT is an important regulator of metabolism, but its role in adipocyte function in vivo remains unclear. We generated heterozygous SMRT knock-out (SMRT(+/-)) mice to investigate the function of SMRT in the adipocyte and the regulation of adipocyte insulin sensitivity. We show that SMRT(+/-) mice are normal weight on a regular diet, but develop increased adiposity on a high-fat diet (HFD). The mechanisms underlying this phenotype are complex, but appear to be due to a combination of an increased number of smaller subcutaneous adipocytes as well as decreased leptin expression, resulting in greater caloric intake. In addition, adipogenesis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from these mice was increased. However, adipocyte insulin sensitivity, measured by insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation and insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis, was enhanced in SMRT(+/-) adipocytes. These finding suggest that SMRT regulates leptin expression and limits the ability of fat mass to expand with increased caloric intake, but that SMRT also negatively regulates adipocyte insulin sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2037067786,"It has been assumed that R5 and X4 HIV utilize similar strategies to support viral cDNA synthesis post viral entry. In this study, we provide evidence to show that R5 and X4 HIV have distinct requirements for host cell uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG2) during the early stage of infection. UNG2 has been previously implicated in HIV infection, but its precise role remains controversial. In this study we show that, although UNG2 is highly expressed in different cell lines, UNG2 levels are low in the natural host cells of HIV. Short interfering RNA knockdown of endogenous UNG2 in primary cells showed that UNG2 is required for R5 but not X4 HIV infection and that this requirement is bypassed when HIV enters the target cell via vesicular stomatitis virus envelope-glycoprotein-mediated endocytosis. We also show that short interfering RNA knockdown of UNG2 in virus-producing primary cells leads to defective R5 HIV virions that are unable to complete viral cDNA synthesis. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that endogenous UNG2 levels are transiently up-regulated post HIV infection, and this increase in UNG2 mRNA is approximately 10-20 times higher in R5 versus X4 HIV-infected cells. Our data show that both virion-associated UNG2 and HIV infection-induced UNG2 expression are critical for reverse transcription during R5 but not X4 HIV infection. More importantly, we have made the novel observation that R5 and X4 HIV have distinct host cell factor requirements and differential capacities to induce gene expression during the early stages of infection. These differences may result from activation of distinct signaling cascades and/or infection of divergent T-lymphocyte subpopulations."

The maximum O2̇̄ generation activity is observed when the complex is inhibited by antimycin A or inactivated by heat treatment or proteinase K digestion. The fact that the cytochrome bc1 complex with less structural integrity has higher O2̇̄-generating activity encouraged us to speculate that O2̇̄ is generated inside the complex, perhaps in the hydrophobic environment of the QP pocket through bifurcated oxidation of ubiquinol by transferring its two electrons to a high potential electron acceptor, iron-sulfur cluster, and a low potential heme bL or molecular oxygen. If this speculation is correct, then one should see more O2̇̄ generation upon oxidation of ubiquinol by a high potential oxidant, such as cytochrome c or ferricyanide, in the presence of phospholipid vesicles or detergent micelles than in the hydrophilic conditions, and this is indeed the case. The protein subunits, at least those surrounding the QP pocket, may play a role either in preventing the release of O2̇̄ from its production site to aqueous environments or in preventing O2 from getting access to the hydrophobic QP pocket and might not directly participate in superoxide production.

Production of O2̇̄ by complex I is either via auto-oxidation of the flavine radical in NADH dehydrogenase (10Galkin A. Brandt U. J. Biol.

In continuing our study of the structural and functional relationship of the cytochrome bc1 complex, it is important to understand the reaction mechanism of superoxide generation in this complex. The fact that antimycin inhibits the electron transfer activity of the cytochrome bc1 complex and stimulates the O2̇̄-generating activity, together with the observation that both activities have a similar activation energy, led investigators to believe that both activities share, at least, a common intermediate (17Forquer I.

In the sequential mechanism (21Link T.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Hong S. Ugulava N. Guergova-Kuras M. Crofts A.R. J. Biol.

Acta. 2007; 1767: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, more compelling evidence against the existence of the semiquinone radical at the QP site has been reported (29Zhu J. Egawa T. Yeh S.R. Yu L. Yu C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 4864-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). No such radical in a heme bL knock-out mutant complex is detected upon reduction by quinol. Because heme bL is the designated electron acceptor of the semiquinone radical at the QP site in the sequential Q-cycle mechanism, one would expect to see the accumulation of this intermediate when the acceptor is not available, but this is not the case. In the concerted mechanism (29Zhu J. Egawa T. Yeh S.R. Yu L. Yu C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 4864-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), no semiubiquinone is formed, and two electrons of Q-H2 are transferred simultaneously to ISC and heme bL. This bifurcated electron transfer reaction provides a basis for the high efficiency of the bc1 complex and is done inside the cytochrome b subunit buried in the membrane bilayer. It is thus expected that any compromise in the structural integrity of cytochrome b should lead to a decrease in the electron transfer efficiency and to an increase in the production of superoxide. The observation that mutants lacking heme bL or heme bH, respectively, show little electron transfer activity but have high superoxide-generating activity (25Yang S. Ma H.W. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28767-28776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) is consistent with the idea that the structural integrity of cytochrome b is required for normal electron transfer activity but not for superoxide generation. Herein we report a systematic comparison of the electron transfer and O2̇̄-generating activities in various cytochrome bc1 complexes, such as the complexes with varying numbers of supernumerary subunits, 4“Supernumerary subunits” refer to the subunits of bc1 complex that bear no redox groups. or with different extents of heat inactivation or proteinase K digestion to see whether or not the intact protein components of the complex are required for O2̇̄-generating activity. We also determined the effect of ubiquinol, phospholipid vesicles, detergent micelles, cytochrome c, and ferricyanide concentration on O2̇̄ generation. Based on the results obtained, we establish that an electron donor (ubiquinol, a high potential electron acceptor), ISC, cytochrome c, or ferricyanide and a hydrophobic environment are required for O2̇̄ production. We formulated a working hypothesis for the reaction mechanism of O2̇̄ production in the bc1 complex. Cytochrome c (horse heart, type III), acetylated cytochrome c, and superoxide dismutase were purchased from Sigma. Proteinase K was purchased from Invitrogen. N-Dodecyl-d-maltopyranoside (DM) and N-octyl-d-gluocopyranoside (OG) were obtained from Anatrace. N,N-Dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide (LDAO) was obtained from Sigma. Nickel nitrilotriacetic acid gel and a QIAprep spin miniprep kit were obtained from Qiagen. 2-Methyl-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazol[1,2-α] pyrazin-3-one, hydrochloride (MCLA) was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. 2,3-Dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-(10-bromodecyl)-1,4-benzoquinol(Q0C10BrH2) was prepared as reported previously (33Yu C.A.

Bovine heart mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex was prepared according to the method developed in our laboratory (36Yu C.A. Yu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 591: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 37Yu L. Yang S. Yin Y. Cen X. Zhou F. Xia D. Yu C.A. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 456: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To assay the cytochrome bc1 complex activity, purified complexes were diluted with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl and 0.01% DM to a final concentration of cytochrome c1 of 1 μm. Appropriate amounts of the diluted samples were added to 1 ml of assay mixture containing 100 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 300 μm EDTA, 100 μm cytochrome c, and 25 μm Q0C10BrH2. Because Q0C10BrH2 is easily auto-oxidized at neutral or higher pH, the stock solution is kept in 95% ethanol containing 1 mm HCl and diluted in the buffer before use. Activities were determined by measuring the reduction of cytochrome c (the increase of absorbance at 550 nm) in a Shimadzu UV 2101 PC spectrophotometer at 23 °C, using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 18.5 for the calculation. The non-enzymatic oxidation of Q0C10BrH2, determined under the same conditions in the absence of the enzyme, was subtracted from the assay. A stock solution of proteinase K, 3%, was made in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm CaCl and 50% glycerol. Two μl of proteinase K solution was added into 200 μl of cytochrome bc1 complex (200 μm cyt b) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl and 0.01% DM. The mixture was incubated at room temperature. The electron transfer and O2̇̄-generating activities were measured during the course of incubation until all the electron transfer activity was diminished. The digested bc1 was then subjected to SDS-PAGE to confirm that all the subunits were digested. Phospholipid vesicles were prepared by the cholate dialysis method (38Kagawa Y. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5477-5487Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Asolectin was dissolved in chloroform and dried as a thin film against the tube by flushing with nitrogen gas while the tube was rotating. The phospholipid was then suspended in 50 mm potassium/sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% sodium cholate. The mixture was subjected to sonification intermittently for 30 min until the solution become clear and then dialyzed against the same buffer overnight, with three changes of buffer. Superoxide production was determined by measuring the chemiluminescence of MCLA-O2̇̄ adduct (39Nakano M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) in an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow reaction analyzer SX.18MV-R (Leatherhead, UK) by leaving the excitation light off and registering light emission (40Denicola A. Souza J.M. Gatti R.M. Augusto O. Radi R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 41Gong X. Yu L. Xia D. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9251-9257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out at 23 °C by mixing 1:1 of solutions A and B. For the determination of O2̇̄ production by the native, heat-inactivated, or proteinase K-digested cytochrome bc1 complexes, Solution A contains 100 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% DM, and 5.0 μm cytochrome bc1. Solution B contains 125 μm Q0C10BrH2 and 4 μm MCLA in the same buffer. Once the reaction started, the produced fluorescence, in voltage, was consecutively monitored for 2 s. One volt from the Applied Photophysics stopped-flow reaction analyzer SX.18MV-R equals the chemiluminescence (maximum peak height of light intensity) generated by 0.5 unit of xanthine oxidase using 100 μm hypoxanthine as a substrate. Because MCLA is a neutral, relatively non-polar molecule, it is possible that the efficiency of O2̇̄ production detected by chemiluminescence may be affected by the presence of different detergent micelles, thus complicating the determination of the micelle effect of different detergents on superoxide production. To avoid this possible complication, superoxide productions in the presence of different detergent, micelles were compared by measuring the reduction of acetylated cytochrome c (42Azzi A. Montecucco C. Richter C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 65: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) because different detergent micelles do not show significant effect on superoxide production by xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine determined by the acetylated cytochrome c method. Reduction of acetylated cytochrome c was followed by the increase of absorption at 550 nm in the same stopped-flow reaction analyzer in the normal way. A millimolar extinction coefficient of 18.5 was used for the concentration calculation. Solution A contains 100 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 10 μm acetylated cytochrome c, and various amounts of detergents. Solution B contains 250 μm Q0C10BrH2 in 0.5 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 4, in the presence or absence of 300 units/ml superoxide dismutase. Table 1 summarizes the electron transfer and O2̇̄-generating activities in various bc1 complex preparations. The bovine heart mitochondrial complex has 11 protein subunits. This complex has the highest electron transfer activity and lowest superoxide-generating activity among the complexes tested. The Rhodobacter sphaeroides complex, which contains four protein subunits (three core subunits and one supernumerary subunit), has only about one-twelfth of the electron transfer activity of the bovine complex but has about six times the O2̇̄-generating activity of the bovine enzyme. When the only supernumerary subunit (subunit IV) is deleted from the R. sphaeroides wild-type complex, the resulting three-subunit core complex (RsΔIV) has only a fraction of the electron transfer activity of the wild-type complex but has about four times the O2̇̄-generating activity. When the three-subunit core complex is reconstituted with subunit IV, the electron transfer activity increases, and the O2̇̄-generating activity decreases to the same level as those in the wild-type, four-subunit complex.TABLE 1Comparison of electron transfer and superoxide-generating activities of various cytochrome bc1 complexesPreparationActivitiesElectron transfer (μmol of cytochrome c reduced/min/nmol of cytochrome c)O2̇̄ generation (milliunits of XO/nmol of cytochrome c)−Antimycin+AntimycinMitochondrial bc143.0 ± 0.315 ± 219 ± 2Rsbc13.5 ± 0.291 ± 2300 ± 2RsΔIV0.8 ± 0.2325 ± 2546 ± 5Cyt b(H198N)0.4 ± 0.2510 ± 5510 ± 5Cyt b(H111N)0.3 ± 0.2500 ± 4510 ± 6 Open table in a new tab The differential scanning calorimetric studies indicate that the order of thermal stability among these complexes is: beef > wild-type R. sphaeroides complex = reconstituted complex > RsΔIV complex (data not shown). Therefore, the electron transfer activity of the bc1 complex is in direct proportion to the structural integrity of the complex, whereas the O2̇̄-generating activity has an inverse relationship with the structural integrity of the complex. In other words, the electron transfer activity is inversely proportional to the O2̇̄-generating activity in the bc1 complex. The finding that the cytochrome bc1 complex with less structural integrity has higher O2̇̄-generating activity encouraged us to speculate that O2̇̄ is generated inside the complex, perhaps in the hydrophobic environment of the QP pocket, and that the protein subunits, at least those surrounding the QP pocket, may play a role either in preventing the release of O2̇̄ from its production site to aqueous environments or in preventing O2 from getting access to the hydrophobic QP pocket. If the above speculation is correct, then one should see an increase in O2̇̄ generation in the complex with denatured protein subunits. To test this speculation, the wild-type R. sphaeroides bc1 complex was incubated at 37 °C to inactivate the complex, and the electron transfer and O2̇̄ generation activities were measured during the course of incubation. As the incubation time increases, the electron transfer activity decreases, whereas the O2̇̄-generating activity increases. Fig. 1 shows the relationship between the electron transfer activity and the O2̇̄-generating activity during the heat inactivation process. Maximum O2̇̄-generating activity is obtained when more than 90% of the electron transfer activity is abolished. This result indicates that the production of O2̇̄ during quinol oxidation by bc1 complex does not require the presence of an intact complex. The impairment of the structural integrity of the complex by the heat denaturalization of the protein subunits leads to the increase in the accessibility of molecular oxygen to the hydrophobic environment of the QP pocket to generate O2̇̄ and to facilitate the release of the produced O2̇̄ to the aqueous medium. The notion that an intact protein subunit structure is not required for O2̇̄-generating activity of the bc1 complex is further supported by the observation that mutants H198N and H111N, which lack heme bL and heme bH, respectively, have very little electron transfer activity but show O2̇̄-generating activity equal to that of the antimycin-treated wild-type complex (25Yang S. Ma H.W. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28767-28776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Table 1). The increased rates of O2̇̄ formation when in the heme bL knock-out complex is strong evidence that although the heme bL may react with oxygen when it is present, a O2̇̄ can also be formed by a route other than by reaction with the heme bL. The loss of either heme bL or heme bH would be expected to have a strong impact on the overall structural integrity of the bc1 complex, leading to the distortion of the QP pocket environment and presumably increasing the accessibility of O2 to the site. It is as expected that the incubation of these two heme b-lacking mutant complexes at 37 °C to denature the protein subunits does not further increase the O2̇̄-generating activity because the structural integrity of these two complexes has already been deteriorated by mutation. To further confirm that superoxide-generating activity is independent of the presence of an intact protein structure, the bc1 complex was subjected to proteinase K digestion and electron transfer, and superoxide-generating activities were measured during the course of digestion. As shown in Fig. 2, the electron transfer activity diminishes, whereas the O2̇̄-generating activity increases as the digestion time increases. Maximum superoxide-generating activity is observed when electron transfer activity is completely abolished. SDS-PAGE analysis of the proteinase K-digested complex reveals no intact subunits of cytochromes b, c1, or ISP (Fig. 3). The largest peptide band presence in the digested complex has an apparent molecular mass of less than 7 kDa. These results further support our suggestion that the intact protein components of the complex or the intact complex play no direct role in O2̇̄ generation. A Western blotting experiment using anti-ISP indicated that at least a part of this peptide band is derived from ISP. In other words, the ISC detected by EPR is housed in this peptide.FIGURE 3SDS-PAGE of the cytochrome bc1 complex and its proteinase K-digested products.Lane 1, intact wild-type cytochrome bc1. Lane 2, standard polypeptides. Lane 3, proteinase K-treated wild-type complex. Sub. IV, subunit IV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If this notion is correct, then what remaining elements in the proteinase K-digested complex contributed to superoxide production from Q-H2? A hydrophobic environment and a high potential electron acceptor ISC in the digested system could contribute to the superoxide formation in the presence of molecular oxygen. The presence of intact ISC in the proteinase K-digested complex was confirmed by the presence of EPR signals of ISC in the digested complex (data not shown). Thus, it is possible that ISC serves as a high potential electron acceptor and oxygen serves as a low potential electron acceptor during bifurcated oxidation of Q-H2 in a hydrophobic environment of the QP pocket to produce superoxide. Because there are no free metal ions in the purified cytochrome bc1 complex and the iron in the heme and iron-sulfur cluster is not released during heat treatment or proteinase digestion, as indicated by absorption and EPR spectra of the tested samples, the possibility that the observed O2̇̄ production is due to free iron can be eliminated. Although the addition of ferricytochrome c to the proteinase K-digested complex can increase its superoxide production, oxidation of ubiquinol by ferricytochrome c in the aqueous solution at neutral pH is a very slow reaction with a reduction rate constant K1 of 0.24/s, and little O2̇̄ formation is detected, suggesting that a hydrophobic environment provided by the digested complex is required for superoxide production. Similar results were obtained when potassium ferricyanide was used to replace ferricytochrome c. To confirm that a hydrophobic environment is needed for O2̇̄ production, varying amounts of phospholipid vesicles were added to the mixture containing constant amounts of ubiquinol and cytochrome c, and the superoxide anion production was measured by the reduction of acetylated cytochrome c method. In the presence of phospholipid vesicles, the rate of the formation of O2̇̄ is proportional to the amount of vesicles added up to 0.3% (Fig. 4). This result clearly indicates that the formation of O2̇̄ takes place in hydrophobic environments. If the hydrophobic environment in the bilayer of phospholipid vesicles can facilitate O2̇̄ generation, one would expect that a micelle solution of detergent should do the same. To test the effects of detergents on the O2̇̄ production by Q-H2 and cytochrome c, various detergents, non-ionic (OG, DM), anionic (sodium cholate (SC) and deoxycholate (DOC)), and cationic (LDAO), were used to substitute phospholipid vesicles. The detergent micelle solution (or phospholipid vesicles), which facilitates superoxide anion production, does not prevent dismutation of the superoxide anion generated by hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase. Therefore, the superoxide generation-facilitating activity observed is real and not due to the decrease of dismutation. Fig. 5 shows the effect of detergent concentration on the superoxide production during quinol oxidation by cytochrome c. As expected, little O2̇̄ generation is observed when the concentration of detergent used is below its critical micelle concentration because no hydrophobic environment is available. When the concentration of detergent used is higher than its critical micelle concentration, the O2̇̄ production rate increases as the detergent micelle concentration in the system increases. Interestingly, SC or DOC is much more effective in promoting superoxide generation than OG, DM, or LDAO. The critical micelle concentrations for LDAO, OG, DM, DOC, and SC are 1, 25, 0.15, 1.33, and 3 mm (32Helenius A. McCaslin D.R. Fries E. Tanford C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 734-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), respectively, which do not appear to correlate with their abilities to facilitate O2̇̄ generation. However, it is very apparent that detergent with a negatively charged head group such as SC or DOC can provide a better environment for O2̇̄ generation than neutral (OG or DM) or cationic (LDAO) detergents can. There are two simple explanations for the negatively charged detergents to have a better efficiency in promoting O2̇̄ production during the oxidation of quinol. First, the negative charges on the micelle surface may facilitate deprotonation of the 1-hydroxyl group of quinol. Second, the negatively charged detergent micelle surface may attract the positively charged ferricytochrome c better than the neutral or positively charged micelles. Thus, the high potential electron acceptor, ferricytochrome c, has a better accessibility to quinol, which is located near the surface of the detergent micelles. When potassium ferricyanide is used as the high potential electron acceptor, the effect on O2̇̄ generation by the difference in the charge of the micelle surface is less apparent. Generation of O2̇̄ requires an electron donor ubiquinol and a high potential oxidant such as ISC, cytochrome c, or ferricyanide as an electron acceptor. To test the cytochrome c concentration dependence of the O2̇̄ generation, various concentrations of cytochrome c were added to a reaction mixture containing 25 μm Q-H2 and 6 mm sodium cholate. As seen in Fig. 6 in the curve with open circles, it is clear that the O2̇̄ production is proportional to the concentration of cytochrome c. In Fig. 6, the curve with Xs shows the effect of ferricyanide concentration on the O2̇̄ generation. Varying concentrations of ferricyanide were added to a reaction mixture containing 25 μm Q-H2 and 6 mm sodium cholate. Like cytochrome c, the O2̇̄ production is proportional to the concentration of ferricyanide added but with five times more efficiency than that of cytochrome c. The effect of the Q-H2 concentration on superoxide generation was also studied. Under a constant concentration of cytochrome c (2.5 or 25 μm) and sodium cholate (6 mm), O2̇̄ production increases when Q-H2 concentration increases (Fig. 7). When 2.5 μm cytochrome c is used, maximum O2̇̄ production is obtained when 25 μm Q-H2 is used. When 25 μm cytochrome c is used, maximum O2̇̄ production is not reached until the Q-H2 concentration in the system is about 125 μm or higher (data not shown). These results indicate that at a given concentration of Q-H2, O2̇̄ production is dependent on the concentration of cytochrome c used, confirming the results shown in Fig. 6. Based on the results obtained that O2̇̄ is produced during Q-H2 oxidation by cytochrome c or ferricyanide in the presence of phospholipid vesicles or a detergent micelle and that the O2̇̄ is produced by a heat-inactivated or proteinase K-digested complex, a reaction mechanism for O2̇̄ production in the bc1 complex is proposed. In this proposed mechanism, four elements are directly involved in O2̇̄ generation. These are: a hydrophobic environment, a high potential electron acceptor, a low potential electron acceptor, and an electron donor. In the intact cytochrome bc1 complex, the protein subunits of the complex directly involved in the superoxide production are ISP, which houses a high potential electron acceptor ISC, and cytochrome b, which provides a hydrophobic environment, a QP pocket, and a low potential electron acceptor heme bL. Based on the concerted Q-cycle mechanism (29Zhu J. Egawa T. Yeh S.R. Yu L. Yu C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 4864-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Berry E.A. Huang L.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), quinol undergoes bifurcated oxidation in the QP pocket by simultaneously transferring its two electrons to ISC and heme bL. The molecular oxygen can also receive a hydrogen from quinol to produce a protonated superoxide (O2H), which generates O2̇̄ upon deprotonation. It is also likely that the reduced heme bL can transfer an electron to the molecular oxygen to form O2̇̄, particularly when the oxidant (heme bH) of reduced heme bL is limited or unavailable, such as in the presence of antimycin A (Fig. 8A). According to this proposed O2̇̄ generation mechanism, the generation of only a fraction of O2̇̄ during quinol oxidation catalyzed by intact bc1 complex may result from: (i) the limited accessibility of molecular oxygen to the QP pocket, which is surrounded by structured protein subunits; (ii) molecular oxygen competing unfavorably with heme bL for the electron during bifurcated ubiquinol oxidation, thus ensuring that few electrons are readily available for oxygen to react with; and (iii) the fact that the O2̇̄ being generated within the QP pocket may not easily escape to the aqueous medium. Although intact protein subunits of the bc1 complex are not directly involved in O2̇̄ generation, they form a barrier for the QP pocket to limit accessibility of molecular oxygen to the pocket. Destruction of protein structural integrity by heme bL or bH deletion, heat inactivation, or proteinase K digestion leads to a loosening of the structural integrity of the QP pocket to facilitate the molecular oxygen to get access to the QP pocket and to ease the release of produced O2̇̄ to the aqueous medium. In addition, it is possible that in the cytochrome bc1 complex, an oxygen molecule is located between the 4-HO− group of Q-H2 and heme bL to mediate the electron transfer between them in the hydrophobic environment of the QP pocket. The poor hydrogen-bonding nature of the oxygen molecule seems to work against this speculation. However, if this were the case, in a hydrophobic environment, one would expect to see a higher presteady state reduction rate of cytochrome b by ubiquinol in the presence of oxygen than in the absence of it. Our preliminary results seem to support this speculation. Further investigation on the role of oxygen in the reduction of cytochrome b by ubiquinol is currently in progress in our laboratory. In the protein-free system, our results appear to suggest that the benzoquinol ring of Q-H2 is located at or near the surface of the lipid vesicles or detergent micelles with its 1-hydroxy group extended into the water phase and the 4-hydroxy group together with its alkyl side chain located inside the bilayer or micelle (Fig. 8, B and C). When the ISC is used as an electron acceptor, we speculate that a hydrogen is transferred from the 1-hydroxyl group to the N-3 of the imidazole ring of histidine residue, which is a ligand of the ISC. At the same time, a hydrogen is transferred concurrently from the 4-hydroxy group to a molecule of oxygen, which is dissolved inside the lipid bilayer of vesicles or in the hydrophobic interior of detergent micelles, to generate a protonated superoxide (HO2), which then diffuses to the water phase to become a superoxide anion upon deprotonation. The high potential electron acceptor ISC can be substituted with cytochrome c or ferricyanide. In this case, we surmise that the 1-hydroxy group of ubiquinone is deprotonated and releases a proton to the water phase before the electron is transferred to ferricyanide or cytochrome c. At the same time, the 4-hydroxy group transfers its hydrogen atom to a molecular oxygen. In the phospholipid vesicles or detergent micelle systems, we suggest that the electron transfer between cytochrome c and Q-H2 takes place at the surface of the lipid bilayer and that the transfer between Q-H2 and O2 occurs concurrently inside the bilayer. This suggestion is consistent with the fact that the solubility of oxygen is much higher in the hydrophobic environment than that in the aqueous medium and that the rate of reduction of cytochrome c by Q-H2 is much lower under anaerobic conditions than when in the presence of oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W2171464782,"In this study we explore the mechanisms by which a double mutation (E59D/D75Y) in cardiac troponin C (CTnC) associated with dilated cardiomyopathy reduces the Ca(2+)-activated maximal tension of cardiac muscle. Studying the single mutants (i.e. E59D or D75Y) indicates that D75Y, but not E59D, causes a reduction in the calcium affinity of CTnC in troponin complex, regulated thin filaments (RTF), and the Ca(2+) sensitivity of contraction and ATPase in cardiac muscle preparations. However, both D75Y and E59D are required to reduce the actomyosin ATPase activity and maximal force in muscle fibers, indicating that E59D enhances the effects of D75Y. Part of the reduction in force/ATPase may be due to a defect in the interactions between CTnC and cardiac troponin T, which are known to be necessary for ATPase activation. An additional mechanism for the reduction in force/ATPase comes from measurements of the binding stoichiometry of myosin subfragment-1 (S-1) to the RTF. Using wild type RTFs, 4.8 mol S-1 was bound per mol filament (seven actins), whereas with E59D/D75Y RTFs, the number of binding sites was reduced by approximately 23% to 3.7. Altogether, these results suggest that the reduction in force and ATPase activation is possibly due to a thin filament conformation that promotes fewer accessible S-1-binding sites. In the absence of any family segregation data, the functional results presented here support the concept that this is likely a dilated cardiomyopathy-causing mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2010228913,"A kinetic analysis has been made of the interaction of α-Hb chains with a mutant α-hemoglobin stabilizing protein, AHSPV56G, which is the first case of an AHSP mutation associated with clinical symptoms of mild thalassemia syndrome. The chaperone AHSP is thought to protect nascent α chains until final binding to the partner β-Hb. Rather than protecting α chains, the mutant chaperone is partially unfolded but recovers its secondary structure via interaction with α-Hb. For both AHSPWT and AHSPV56G, the binding to α-Hb is quite rapid relative to the α-β reaction, as expected because the chaperone binding must be quite competitive to complete the α chain folding process before α-Hb binds irreversibly to β-Hb. The main kinetic difference is a dissociation rate of AHSPV56G·α-Hb some four times faster relative to AHSP·α-Hb. Considering a role of protein folding, the AHSPV56G apparently does not bind long enough (0.5 s versus 2 s for the WT) to complete the structural modifications. The overall replacement reaction (AHSP·α-Hb + β-Hb → AHSP + αβ) can be quite long, especially if there is an excess of AHSP relative to β-Hb monomers.

https://openalex.org/W2008511275,"hnRNP K, a member of the family of heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins, is known to exert various functional roles in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria to affect different cellular processes including chromatin remodeling, transcription, splicing, and translation. Here we report, for the first time, that hnRNP K is specifically involved in human LDL receptor (LDLR) gene transcription in HepG2 cells. We show that depletion of hnRNP K by siRNA transfection reduces the expression of LDLR mRNA and protein by more than 50% as measured by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Importantly, we show that the decay rate of LDLR mRNA is not affected by hnRNP K siRNA transfection, whereas the LDLR promoter activity is significantly decreased. Furthermore, overexpression of hnRNP K increased the LDLR promoter activity by the luciferase reporter assay. By utilizing a series of mutational and deletional constructs of LDLR promoter luciferase reporters, we mapped the K-responsive element to the repeat 3 (R3) sequence of the LDLR promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that the K protein binds to a single-stranded DNA probe containing the CT-rich element of R3, which is in contrast to the requirement of double-stranded DNA for Sp1 to bind to R3. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays reveal a direct interaction of hnRNP K with the LDLR promoter in intact HepG2 cells. These new findings provide strong evidence demonstrating that hnRNP K is an important transactivator for human LDLR gene transcription. This work sheds new light on our current understanding of how LDLR gene expression is controlled at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2130796744,"Here we present functional and biochemical evidence for a Ca2+ channel (CaV1.2) /protein kinase C (PKC) signaling complex being a key player in muscarinic regulation of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Muscarinic stimulation induced Ca2+ signals and concomitant contractions in detrusor muscle from mice that were dependent on functional Ca2+ channels. These signals were still present in muscles being depolarized by 85 mM extracellular K+. Muscarinic-induced contractions were reduced by a PKC inhibitor [bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM-I)] and a phospholipase D (PLD) inhibitor (1-butanol). A phorbol ester (PDBu) enlarged muscarinic-induced Ca2+ signals and contractions. The effects of BIM-I and PDBu were inhibited by isradipine and/or absent in muscles from CaV1.2-deficient mice. Both carbachol and PDBu increased CaV1.2 channel currents in isolated bladder myocytes. Blue native-PAGE electrophoresis revealed that CaV1.2, PKC, and PLD are closely associated in muscles being previously stimulated by carbachol. Immunoprecipitation using anti-CaV1.2 followed by Western blotting demonstrated that CaV1.2 and PKC are coupled in stimulated muscles from wild-type mice. Autoradiography on immunoprecipitates showed that CaV1.2 is a substrate for PKC-mediated phosphorylation. These findings suggest that a signaling complex consisting of CaV1.2, PKC, and, probably, PLD controls muscarinic-mediated phasic contraction of urinary bladder smooth muscle.—Huster, M., Frei, E., Hofmann, F., Wegener, J.

https://openalex.org/W1998683777,"FGF2 (fibroblast growth factor 2), but not vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stimulates sustained activation of ERK2/1 for endothelial NOS3 (nitric-oxide synthase 3) protein expression in ovine fetoplacental artery endothelial cells (oFPAEC). We deciphered herein the downstream signaling of ERK2/1 responsible for NOS3 expression by FGF2 in oFPAEC. FGF2, but not VEGF, increased NOS3 mRNA levels without altering its degradation. FGF2, but not VEGF, trans-activated sheep NOS3 promoter, and this was dependent on ERK2/1 activation. FGF2 did not trans-activate NOS3 promoters with deletions upstream of the consensus AP-1 site (TGAGTC A, -678 to -685). Trans-activation of wild-type NOS3 promoter by FGF2 was significantly inhibited when either the AP-1 or the cAMP-response element (CRE)-like sequence (TGCGTCA, -752 to -758) was mutated and was completely blocked when both were mutated. EMSA analyses showed that FGF2, but not VEGF, stimulated AP-1 and CRE DNA-protein complexes primarily composed of JunB and Fra1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed JunB/Fra1 binding to NOS3 promoter AP-1 and CRE elements in intact cells. FGF2, but not VEGF, stimulated JunB and Fra1 expressions; all preceded NOS3 up-regulation and were inhibited by PD98059. Down-regulation of JunB or Fra-1, but not c-Jun, blocked FGF2 stimulation of NOS3 expression and NO production. AP-1 inhibition suppressed FGF2 stimulation of NOS3 expression in human umbilical vein EC and uterine artery endothelial cells. Thus, FGF2 induction of NOS3 expression is mainly mediated by AP-1-dependent transcription involving JunB and Fra1 up-regulation via sustained ERK2/1 activation in endothelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W1979176501,"Limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2C is caused by mutations in the gamma-sarcoglycan gene (gsg) that results in loss of this protein, and disruption of the sarcoglycan (SG) complex. Signal transduction after mechanical perturbation is mediated, in part, through the SG complex and leads to phosphorylation of tyrosines on the intracellular portions of the sarcoglycans. This study tested if the Tyr(6) in the intracellular region of gamma-sarcoglycan protein (gamma-SG) was necessary for proper localization of the protein in skeletal muscle membranes or for the normal pattern of ERK1/2 phosphorylation after eccentric contractions. Viral mediated gene transfer of wild type gsg (WTgsg) and mutant gsg lacking Tyr(6) (Y6Agsg) was performed into the muscles of gsg(-/-) mice. Muscles were examined for production and stability of the gamma-SG, as well as the level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation before and after eccentric contraction. Sarcolemmal localization of gamma-SG was achieved regardless of which construct was expressed. However, only expression of WTgsg corrected the aberrant ERK1/2 phosphorylation associated with the absence of gamma-SG, whereas Y6Agsg failed to have any effect. This study shows that localization of gamma-SG does not require Tyr(6), but localization alone is insufficient for restoration of normal signal transduction patterns after mechanical perturbation."
https://openalex.org/W2132596371,"Background Alpha-dystroglycan (α-DG) is a cell surface receptor providing a molecular link between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the actin-based cytoskeleton. During its biosynthesis, α-DG undergoes specific and unusual O-glycosylation crucial for its function as a high-affinity cellular receptor for ECM proteins. Methodology/Principal Findings We report that expression of functionally glycosylated α-DG during thymic development is tightly regulated in developing T cells and largely confined to CD4−CD8− double negative (DN) thymocytes. Ablation of DG in T cells had no effect on proliferation, migration or effector function but did reduce the size of the thymus due to a significant loss in absolute numbers of thymocytes. While numbers of DN thymocytes appeared normal, a marked reduction in CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes occurred. In the periphery mature naïve T cells deficient in DG showed both normal proliferation in response to allogeneic cells and normal migration, effector and memory T cell function when tested in acute infection of mice with either lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or influenza virus. Conclusions/Significance Our study demonstrates that DG function is modulated by glycosylation during T cell development in vivo and that DG is essential for normal development and differentiation of T cells."
