https://openalex.org/W2089749713,"IF the term ‘keratin’ were applied only to those proteins which contain a high proportion of cystine, which give a keratin-type of X-ray diffraction photograph and which dissolve with ease only in alkaline solutions of reducing agents, then keratins, so far as is known, are confined to the epidermis and epidermal appendages of vertebrates, and are always intracellular. Other so-called keratins from vertebrate egg capsules1,2, byssus threads of Mytilus2, etc., though they contain cystine, can be dissolved by solvents other than alkaline reducing agents, do not give a keratin-type of X-ray photograph and are extracellular structures."

https://openalex.org/W2039327489,"A MICROWAVE bridge in conjunction with a superheterodyne method of reception has been used for the detection and measurement of weak paramagnetic resonances. It has been possible to investigate, at a frequency of 9,501.5 Mc./sec., the resonance spectrum of Mn++ ions contained, in concentrations down to 1 part in 105, as activators in zinc sulphide phosphors."
https://openalex.org/W2040705803,THE ability of a single deoxyriboside to support growth of several species of bacteria has prompted us to investigate the mechanism of deoxyribosidic interconversion in these organisms. An arbitrary system was adopted which consists of two parts: (1) a crude enzyme preparation from one such organism (Lactobacillus helveticus); (2) measurement of the quantity of deoxyriboside (synthesized or destroyed) by microbiological assay with another such organism (Thermobacterium acidophilus R26). The enzyme preparation contained neither adenine deoxyriboside deaminase nor cytosine deoxyriboside deaminase.

https://openalex.org/W7961146,"THE Chætognatha of Scottish waters have been discussed by Fraser1–3. Sagitta elegans Verrill is the dominant form, and appears to be found particularly in those areas where Atlantic water mixes with coastal water. S. setosa, except for a few specimens at the northern entrance of the Irish Sea (in July), was absent from the north and west coasts of Scotland. Russell4, in examining collections of Farran, found S. setosa late in the year at the entrance to the North Channel of the Irish Sea. Both Fraser and Russell consider the S. setosa of the Irish coast to have filtered out from the Irish Sea. Russell considers they may have drifted up through St. George's Channel. Pierce5,6 has found S. setosa together with S. elegans along the English west coast from Morecambe Bay to Anglesey, and considers they are indigenous to that area."

https://openalex.org/W2086902835,"NYROP1, and Brown, Hoyler and Bierwith2, have claimed that it is possible to destroy a large proportion of the bacteria in a liquid suspension at sublethal temperatures by the application of high radio-frequency voltage gradients. Attempts have been made to confirm these results in order to determine the factors involved."
https://openalex.org/W2090549177,"IN poultry and pigeons, subcutaneous emphysema is known as a disorder caused by air escaping from the respiratory system (air sacs, lungs and trachea). In such cases, the escaped air accumulates in the subcutis and inflates the skin. This condition can be improved by repeated puncturing of the skin and by expressing the air."
https://openalex.org/W1996148492,"THE use of the phase-contrast microscope for the study of certain stages in the fertilization of rat eggs has been described1. It was pointed out that pressing the eggs beneath a coverslip greatly improved the visibility of the internal structure. More recently, it has been found that, if the Fallopian tubes are dissected under liquid paraffin and the eggs transferred to a slide with some of the fluid which surrounds them while in the Fallopian tube, they would survive for several hours even when pressed beneath a coverslip. During this period the changes involved in fertilization proceeded in an apparently normal manner, and could readily be observed and photographed."

https://openalex.org/W1985776576,"IT is possible to make a classification of all the different types of mechanisms which correspond to a given order of the initial rate of the homogeneous gas phase thermal decomposition of simple organic compounds1 if a free-radical chain mechanism is admitted. These types of mechanisms differ in two ways: (a) in the type of radicals which takes part in the chain-breaking step, which can be a bimolecular reaction or a triple collision; and (b) in the chain-initiating step, which can be monomolecular or bimolecular."
