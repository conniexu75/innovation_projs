https://openalex.org/W4290673816,"Trastuzumab deruxtecan is an antibody-drug conjugate with high extracranial activity in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer. We conducted the prospective, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 TUXEDO-1 trial. We enrolled patients aged ≥18 years with HER2-positive breast cancer and newly diagnosed untreated brain metastases or brain metastases progressing after previous local therapy, previous exposure to trastuzumab and pertuzumab and no indication for immediate local therapy. Patients received trastuzumab deruxtecan intravenously at the standard dose of 5.4 mg per kg bodyweight once every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was intracranial response rate measured according to the response assessment in neuro-oncology brain metastases criteria. A Simon two-stage design was used to compare a null hypothesis of <26% response rate against an alternative of 61%. Fifteen patients were enrolled in the intention-to-treat population of patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Two patients (13.3%) had a complete intracranial response, nine (60%) had a partial intracranial response and three (20%) had stable disease as the best intracranial response, with a best overall intracranial response rate of 73.3% (95% confidential interval 48.1-89.1%), thus meeting the predefined primary outcome. No new safety signals were observed and global quality-of-life and cognitive functioning were maintained over the treatment duration. In the TUXEDO-1 trial (NCT04752059, EudraCT 2020-000981-41), trastuzumab deruxtecan showed a high intracranial response rate in patients with active brain metastases from HER2-positive breast cancer and should be considered as a treatment option in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W4290673648,"On the evening of 15 January 2022, the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano1 unleashed a violent underwater eruption, blanketing the surrounding land masses in ash and debris2,3. The eruption generated tsunamis observed around the world. An event of this type last occurred in 1883 during the eruption of Krakatau4, and thus we have the first observations of a tsunami from a large emergent volcanic eruption captured with modern instrumentation. Here we show that the explosive eruption generated waves through multiple mechanisms, including: (1) air-sea coupling with the initial and powerful shock wave radiating out from the explosion in the immediate vicinity of the eruption; (2) collapse of the water cavity created by the underwater explosion; and (3) air-sea coupling with the air-pressure pulse that circled the Earth several times, leading to a global tsunami. In the near field, tsunami impacts are strongly controlled by the water-cavity source whereas the far-field tsunami, which was unusually persistent, can be largely described by the air-pressure pulse mechanism. Catastrophic damage in some harbours in the far field was averted by just tens of centimetres, implying that a modest sea level rise combined with a future, similar event would lead to a step-function increase in impacts on infrastructure. Piecing together the complexity of this event has broad implications for coastal hazards in similar geophysical settings, suggesting a currently neglected source of global tsunamis."

Here we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 2,393 cases of COVID-19 in a cohort of Japanese individuals collected during the initial waves of the pandemic, with 3,289 unaffected controls. We identified a variant on chromosome 5 at 5q35 (rs60200309-A), close to the dedicator of cytokinesis 2 gene (DOCK2), which was associated with severe COVID-19 in patients less than 65 years of age. This risk allele was prevalent in East Asian individuals but rare in Europeans, highlighting the value of genome-wide association studies in non-European populations. RNA-sequencing analysis of 473 bulk peripheral blood samples identified decreased expression of DOCK2 associated with the risk allele in these younger patients. DOCK2 expression was suppressed in patients with severe cases of COVID-19. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis (n = 61 individuals) identified cell-type-specific downregulation of DOCK2 and a COVID-19-specific decreasing effect of the risk allele on DOCK2 expression in non-classical monocytes. Immunohistochemistry of lung specimens from patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia showed suppressed DOCK2 expression. Moreover, inhibition of DOCK2 function with CPYPP increased the severity of pneumonia in a Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by weight loss, lung oedema, enhanced viral loads, impaired macrophage recruitment and dysregulated type I interferon responses. We conclude that DOCK2 has an important role in the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of severe COVID-19, and could be further explored as a potential biomarker and/or therapeutic target."

https://openalex.org/W4290672946,"The fetal-to-adult switch in hemoglobin production is a model of developmental gene control with relevance to the treatment of hemoglobinopathies. The expression of transcription factor BCL11A, which represses fetal β-type globin (HBG) genes in adult erythroid cells, is predominantly controlled at the transcriptional level but the underlying mechanism is unclear. We identify HIC2 as a repressor of BCL11A transcription. HIC2 and BCL11A are reciprocally expressed during development. Forced expression of HIC2 in adult erythroid cells inhibits BCL11A transcription and induces HBG expression. HIC2 binds to erythroid BCL11A enhancers to reduce chromatin accessibility and binding of transcription factor GATA1, diminishing enhancer activity and enhancer-promoter contacts. DNA-binding and crystallography studies reveal direct steric hindrance as one mechanism by which HIC2 inhibits GATA1 binding at a critical BCL11A enhancer. Conversely, loss of HIC2 in fetal erythroblasts increases enhancer accessibility, GATA1 binding and BCL11A transcription. HIC2 emerges as an evolutionarily conserved regulator of hemoglobin switching via developmental control of BCL11A."
https://openalex.org/W4290673668,"SIGNAL is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study (no. NCT02481674) established to evaluate pepinemab, a semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D)-blocking antibody, for treatment of Huntington's disease (HD). The trial enrolled a total of 265 HD gene expansion carriers with either early manifest (EM, n = 179) or late prodromal (LP, n = 86) HD, randomized (1:1) to receive 18 monthly infusions of pepinemab (n = 91 EM, 41 LP) or placebo (n = 88 EM, 45 LP). Pepinemab was generally well tolerated, with a relatively low frequency of serious treatment-emergent adverse events of 5% with pepinemab compared to 9% with placebo, including both EM and LP participants. Coprimary efficacy outcome measures consisted of assessments within the EM cohort of (1) a two-item HD cognitive assessment family comprising one-touch stockings of Cambridge (OTS) and paced tapping (PTAP) and (2) clinical global impression of change (CGIC). The differences between pepinemab and placebo in mean change (95% confidence interval) from baseline at month 17 for OTS were -1.98 (-4.00, 0.05) (one-sided P = 0.028), and for PTAP 1.43 (-0.37, 3.23) (one-sided P = 0.06). Similarly, because a significant treatment effect was not observed for CGIC, the coprimary endpoint, the study did not meet its prespecified primary outcomes. Nevertheless, a number of other positive outcomes and post hoc subgroup analyses-including additional cognitive measures and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography imaging assessments-provide rationale and direction for the design of a phase 3 study and encourage the continued development of pepinemab in patients diagnosed with EM HD."
https://openalex.org/W4290667504,"Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is the commonly used anticoagulant to prevent clotting of the ECMO circuit and thrombosis of the cannulated vessels. A side effect of UFH is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Little is known about HIT during ECMO and the impact of changing anticoagulation in ECMO patients with newly diagnosed HIT. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence, complications, impact of switching anticoagulation to argatroban and outcomes of patients developing heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) during either veno-venous (VV) or veno-arterial (VA) ECMO.Retrospective observational single centre study of prospectively collected data of consecutive patients receiving VV ECMO therapy for severe respiratory failure and VA ECMO for circulatory failure from January 2006 to December 2016 of the Medical intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Hospital of Regensburg. Treatment of HIT on ECMO was done with argatroban.507 patients requiring ECMO were included. Further HIT-diagnostic was conducted if HIT-4T-score was ≥4. The HIT-confirmed group had positive HIT-enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay (ELISA) and positive heparin-induced-platelet-activation (HIPA) test, the HIT-suspicion group a positive HIT-ELISA and missing HIPA but remained on alternative anticoagulation until discharge and the HIT-excluded group a negative or positive HIT-ELISA, however negative HIPA. These were compared to group ECMO-control without any HIT suspicion. The prevalence of HIT-confirmed was 3.2%, of HIT-suspicion 2.0% and HIT-excluded 10.8%. Confirmed HIT was trendwise more frequent in VV than in VA (3.9 vs. 1.7% p = 0.173). Compared to the ECMO control group, patients with confirmed HIT were longer on ECMO (median 13 vs. 8 days, p = 0.002). Different types of complications were higher in the HIT-confirmed than in the ECMO-control group, but in-hospital mortality was not different (31% vs. 41%, p = 0.804).HIT is rare on ECMO, should be suspected, if platelets are decreasing, but seems not to increase mortality if treated promptly."

https://openalex.org/W4290673782,"Thyroid hormones are vital in metabolism, growth and development1. Thyroid hormone synthesis is controlled by thyrotropin (TSH), which acts at the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR)2. In patients with Graves' disease, autoantibodies that activate the TSHR pathologically increase thyroid hormone activity3. How autoantibodies mimic thyrotropin function remains unclear. Here we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of active and inactive TSHR. In inactive TSHR, the extracellular domain lies close to the membrane bilayer. Thyrotropin selects an upright orientation of the extracellular domain owing to steric clashes between a conserved hormone glycan and the membrane bilayer. An activating autoantibody from a patient with Graves' disease selects a similar upright orientation of the extracellular domain. Reorientation of the extracellular domain transduces a conformational change in the seven-transmembrane-segment domain via a conserved hinge domain, a tethered peptide agonist and a phospholipid that binds within the seven-transmembrane-segment domain. Rotation of the TSHR extracellular domain relative to the membrane bilayer is sufficient for receptor activation, revealing a shared mechanism for other glycoprotein hormone receptors that may also extend to other G-protein-coupled receptors with large extracellular domains."
https://openalex.org/W4290666408,"Modular construction is considered as a preferred construction method over conventional construction due to a number of benefits including reduction in project completion time, improved environmental performance, better quality, enhanced workers' safety and flexibility. However, successful implementation of modular construction is hindered by various risk factors and uncertainties. Therefore, it is imperative to perform a comprehensive risk assessment of critical risk factors that pose a negative impact on the implementation of modular construction. Moreover, there is also a relatively less rate of modular construction adoption in developing countries, highlighting the need to focus more on underdeveloped regions. This study aims to propose a risk assessment framework for identification, evaluation and prioritization of critical risk factors affecting the implementation of modular construction in Pakistan. 20 risk factors were identified from previous literature which were then evaluated to shortlist the most significant risks using Fuzzy Delphi. The most significant risk factors were then prioritized using a novel Full-Consistency Method (FUCOM). The results specified 'Inadequate skills and experience in modular construction', 'Inadequate capacity of modular manufacturers' and 'Inability to make changes in design during the construction stage' as top three critical risks in the implementation of modular construction. This is the first study to propose a risk assessment framework for modular construction in Pakistan. The results of the study are useful to provide insights to construction industry practitioners in highlighting and eliminating risks involved in modular construction planning and execution."

APPJ array-produced plasma were characterized. APPJ array treatment of three different solutions (deionized water (DW), HBSS (serum-free Hanks’ balanced salt solution), and DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium) + 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum)) were performed to induce the changes in the concentration of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) as functions of the operating parameters. Human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) injected with plasma-treated media were investigated for changes in cell viability using MTT assay.

https://openalex.org/W4290673597,"Cellular therapies remain constrained by the limited availability of sensors for disease markers. Here we present an integrated target-to-receptor pipeline for constructing a customizable advanced modular bispecific extracellular receptor (AMBER) that combines our generalized extracellular molecule sensor (GEMS) system with a high-throughput platform for generating designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins). For proof of concept, we chose human fibrin degradation products (FDPs) as markers with high clinical relevance and screened a DARPin library for FDP binders. We built AMBERs equipped with 19 different DARPins selected from 160 hits, and found 4 of them to be functional as heterodimers with a known single-chain variable fragments binder. Tandem receptors consisting of combinations of the validated DARPins are also functional. We demonstrate applications of these AMBER receptors in vitro and in vivo by constructing designer cell lines that detect pathological concentrations of FDPs and respond with the production of a reporter and a therapeutic anti-thrombotic protein."

Several vaccines are now available to help in controlling COVID-19 associated morbidity and mortality. This study will aim to provide the global and regional prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as an estimate of disease severity among COVID-19 vaccinated individuals. Materials and methods In order to determine the global burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated individuals, we will systematically extract and review papers from PubMed/MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Science direct and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). All the studies describing the prevalence and/or disease severity (hospitalization and case fatality rate) data of COVID-19 among individuals who received a partial or complete dose of WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccines will be eligible. A random effect model will be used to calculate the pooled prevalence and to estimate the disease severity. Subgroup analysis will be performed to explore the association between the number of vaccine doses received and the COVID-19 burdens. Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide the global estimate data on pooled prevalence, hospitalization and case fatality rates of COVID-19 among vaccinated individuals. Moreover, the factors associated with reinfection and disease severity will be equally investigated in the meta-analysis. The results of this study will contribute in the understanding and estimation of the global burden of COVID-19 among vaccinated individuals. Findings will provide meaningful information for the success of the current global rollout of COVID-19 vaccination strategies and pave the way for future interventions.

https://openalex.org/W4290779481,"The individual difference predictors of positive work attitudes and behaviors have been widely investigated in the field of positive organizational scholarship. However, to date, integrating studies linking positive psychological resources, such as Psychological Capital and influence regulation, with positive organizational outcomes are still scarce. Thus, the main aim of the present study was to examine the relationships of Psychological Capital and influence regulation with job satisfaction and job performance both at the individual and team levels.Within the cross-sectional multi-source research involving both team leaders and team members from 34 different teams, we examined the relationships of Psychological Capital and influence regulation with job satisfaction and job performance. The relationships of the study variables were based on the positive organizational behavior and the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, which suggest the positive relationships of distinct positive psychological resources with positive work outcomes. Accordingly, in addition to the widely accepted concept of Psychological Capital (PsyCap), we employed and analyzed the complimentary construct of influence regulation (i.e., the ability to intentionally share social influence with others in the workplace) both at the individual and group levels.The results of hierarchical linear modeling with 304 individuals from 34 teams from a diverse sample of Polish employees indicated that team members' PsyCap was positively linked to individual-level job satisfaction and two facets of job performance, i.e. creative performance and in-role performance. In contrast, no relationship was found between influence regulation and job satisfaction or job performance at both levels of analysis.With regard to positive interpersonal resources, the findings highlight the role of PsyCap in predicting job satisfaction and job performance and broaden the understanding of positivity in the workplace by introducing the construct of influence regulation. Also, based on the study results, managerial implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4290779485,"Open Access (OA) dissemination has been gaining a lot of momentum over the last decade, thanks to the implementation of several OA policies by funders and institutions, as well as the development of several new platforms that facilitate the publication of OA content at low or no cost. Studies have shown that nearly half of the contemporary scientific literature could be available online for free. However, few studies have compared the use of OA literature across countries. This study aims to provide a global picture of OA adoption by countries, using two indicators: publications in OA and references made to articles in OA. We find that, on average, low-income countries are publishing and citing OA at the highest rate, while upper middle-income countries and higher-income countries publish and cite OA articles at below world-average rates. These results highlight national differences in OA uptake and suggest that more OA initiatives at the institutional, national, and international levels are needed to support wider adoption of open scholarship."

Previous studies have shown ME/CFS-associated alterations in the immune system and mitochondria. We used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the morphology and ultrastructure of unstimulated and stimulated ME/CFS immune cells and their intracellular organelles, including mitochondria. PBMCs from four participants were studied: a pair of identical twins discordant for moderate ME/CFS, as well as two age- and gender- matched unrelated subjects-one with an extremely severe form of ME/CFS and the other healthy. TEM analysis of CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells suggested a significant increase in the levels of apoptotic and necrotic cell death in T cells from ME/CFS patients (over 2-fold). Stimulated Tcells of ME/CFS patients also had higher numbers of swollen mitochondria. We also found a large increase in intracellular giant lipid droplet-like organelles in the stimulated PBMCs from the extremely severe ME/CFS patient potentially indicative of a lipid storage disorder. Lastly, we observed a slight increase in platelet aggregation in stimulated cells, suggestive of a possible role of platelet activity in ME/CFS pathophysiology and disease severity. These results indicate extensive morphological alterations in the cellular and mitochondrial phenotypes of ME/CFS patients' immune cells and suggest new insights into ME/CFS biology."

Data were retrieved from VitalDB, a public data repository of vital signs taken during surgeries in 10 operating rooms at Seoul National University Hospital from January 6, 2005, to March 1, 2014. Retrospective data from 14,140 adult patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery with general anaesthesia were used. The predictive performances of models trained with different combinations of waveforms were evaluated and compared at time points at 3, 5, 10, 15 minutes before the event. The performance was calculated by area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), sensitivity and specificity. The model performance was better in the model using both ABP and EEG waveforms than in all other models at all time points (3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes before an event) Using high-fidelity ABP and EEG waveforms, the model predicted IOH with a AUROC and AUPRC of 0.935 [0.932 to 0.938] and 0.882 [0.876 to 0.887] at 5 minutes before an IOH event. The output of both ABP and EEG was more calibrated than that using other combinations or ABP alone. The results demonstrate that a predictive deep neural network can be trained using ABP, ECG, and EEG waveforms, and the combination of ABP and EEG improves model performance and calibration."

The STAM1-binding site maps to the base of the finger loop on βarr1, distinct from where other non–GPCR-binding partners bind, although it partially overlaps with the GPCR-binding site (22Zhuo Y.

Binding to this novel surface on βarr1 may explain why STAM1 specifies FAK signaling by CXCR4, but how STAM1 engagement with βarr1 results in FAK activation remains to be determined.In this study, we addressed the receptor determinants specifying STAM1 recruitment to βarr1 following CXCR4 activation and the broad applicability to other GPCRs. Here, we provide evidence that ligand-stimulated phosphorylation of the distal C-tail of CXCR4 is required for βarr1-mediated signaling by STAM1. We show that CXCL12-stimulated phosphorylation of FAK, but not ERK1/2, requires GRK2/3-promoted phosphorylation of phosphosites located at the distal C-tail of CXCR4 but not membrane proximal phosphosites. Importantly, the distal phosphosites are required to recruit the adapter protein STAM1 to βarr1. This information is transposable because swapping the C-tail of a GPCR that does not recruit STAM1 to βarr1 with the C-tail of CXCR4 is sufficient to confer the ability of this GPCR to recruit STAM1 to βarr1, indicating the information dictating this interaction resides solely within the C-tail. We found that other GPCRs, but not all, that contain potential phospho-Ser or phospho-Thr residues at their distal C-tail are also able to recruit STAM1 to βarr1. Our data suggest that distal, but not the proximal, C-tail phosphosites on CXCR4 and other GPCRs facilitates STAM1 recruitment to βarr1 and FAK activation.ResultsSite-specific phosphorylation of CXCR4 specifies FAK phosphorylationTo better understand CXCR4 signaling, we sought to identify the kinases and receptor determinants responsible for CXCR4-promoted FAK activation.

Treatment with compound 101 reduced FAK phosphorylation by CXCL12, whereas the PKC inhibitor had minimal effect (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, CXCL12 promoted that ERK1/2 phosphorylation was elevated by treatment with compound 101 but not treatment with Gö6983 (Fig. 1, A and C). These data suggest that GRK2/3 phosphorylation of CXCR4, but not PKC, is required for FAK signaling promoted by CXCL12, whereas GRK2/3 suppresses ERK1/2 signaling. This effect on ERK1/2 signaling is similar to what has been previously observed with RNAi against GRK2 (12Busillo J.M. Armando S. Sengupta R. Meucci O. Bouvier M. Benovic J.L.

To study the βarr1 and STAM1 interaction, we recently used bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells heterologously expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged CXCR4 with donor Renilla luciferase (Rluc)–tagged STAM1 and acceptor GFP-tagged βarr1 (βarr1-GFP) treated with varying doses of CXCL12 (22Zhuo Y.

Stimulation of cells with CXCL12 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in BRET between Rluc8-STAM1 and βarr1-GFP (Fig. 2A), in agreement with our previous report indicating that the interaction between βarr1 and STAM1 is promoted by stimulation of CXCR4 (22Zhuo Y.

The GRK2/3 inhibitor completely blocked the BRET response (Fig. 2A), whereas the PKC inhibitor had no effect on the BRET response (Fig. 2B). We also examined the effect of the GRK2/3 or PKC inhibitor by BRET on the recruitment of βarr1-GFP to Rluc3-tagged CXCR4 in HEK293 cells following stimulation with CXCL12. CXCL12 promoted a dose-dependent increase in BRET between βarr1-GFP and CXCR4-Rluc3 that was shifted to the right in the presence of the GRK2/3 inhibitor (Fig. 2C). The EC50 values in the presence of vehicle or GRK2/3 inhibitor are 0.30 nM (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.11–0.79) and 7.79 nM (95% CI = 2.89–20.31), respectively. In contrast, the PKC inhibitor had little effect on the BRET response (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that βarr1 recruitment to CXCR4 and STAM1 recruitment to βarr1 requires GRK2/3 phosphorylation of CXCR4 but not phosphorylation by PKC.Figure 2GRK2/3 inhibitor reduces STAM1 recruitment to βarr1 in the presence of increasing concentrations of CXCL12.

https://openalex.org/W4290666440,"Background Plague, a widely distributed zoonotic disease of mammalian hosts and flea vectors, poses a significant risk to ecosystems throughout much of Earth. Conservation biologists use insecticides for flea control and plague mitigation. Here, we evaluate the use of an insecticide grain bait, laced with 0.005% fipronil (FIP) by weight, with black-tailed prairie dogs (BTPDs, Cynomys ludovicianus ). We consider safety measures, flea control, BTPD body condition, BTPD survival, efficacy of plague mitigation, and the speed of FIP grain application vs. infusing BTPD burrows with insecticide dusts. We also explore conservation implications for endangered black-footed ferrets ( Mustela nigripes ), which are specialized predators of Cynomys . Principal findings During 5- and 10-day laboratory trials in Colorado, USA, 2016–2017, FIP grain had no detectable acute toxic effect on 20 BTPDs that readily consumed the grain. During field experiments in South Dakota, USA, 2016–2020, FIP grain suppressed fleas on BTPDs for at least 12 months and up to 24 months in many cases; short-term flea control on a few sites was poor for unknown reasons. In an area of South Dakota where plague circulation appeared low or absent, FIP grain had no detectable effect, positive or negative, on BTPD survival. Experimental results suggest FIP grain may have improved BTPD body condition (mass:foot) and reproduction (juveniles:adults). During a 2019 plague epizootic in Colorado, BTPDs on 238 ha habitat were protected by FIP grain, whereas BTPDs were nearly eliminated on non-treated habitat. Applications of FIP grain were 2–4 times faster than dusting BTPD burrows. Significance Deltamethrin dust is the most commonly used insecticide for plague mitigation on Cynomys colonies. Fleas on BTPD colonies exhibit the ability to evolve resistance to deltamethrin after repeated annual treatments. Thus, more tools are needed. Accumulating data show orally-delivered FIP is safe and usually effective for flea control with BTPDs, though potential acute toxic effects cannot be ruled out. With continued study and refinement, FIP might be used in rotation with, or even replace deltamethrin, and serve an important role in Cynomys and black-footed ferret conservation. More broadly, our stepwise approach to research on FIP may function as a template or guide for evaluations of insecticides in the context of wildlife conservation."
https://openalex.org/W4290666406,"Municipal amalgamation is one of the core policy tools for Chinese government intervention in urbanization. The city-county merger policy provides a valuable research object for examining whether government-led urban expansion improves the quality of public services. By using city panel data from 2003 to 2019, this paper examines the policy effects of city-county mergers on the quality of public services using the Propensity Score Matching-Difference-in-Differences (PSM-DID) model. The results indicate that, after controlling for other factors, city-county mergers have increased the quality of public services by 1.2%. A placebo test has validated the robustness of this positive effect. Through further tests, the paper finds that the policy has positively affected all three aspects of the quality of public services in China: education, health care, and transport infrastructure, with the greatest impact being on education. Using a case study of a city-county merger in the Fenghua District of Ningbo, this paper depicts the transmission mechanism and argues that the policy affects the quality of public services by providing institutional security (financial and administrative power) and promoting regional integration in the new city area."
https://openalex.org/W4290667454,"Objective The ‘Early Prediction of Functional Outcome after Stroke’ (EPOS) model was developed to predict the presence of at least some upper limb capacity (Action Research Am Test [ARAT] ≥10/57) at 6 months based on assessments on days 2, 5 and 9 after stroke. External validation of the model is the next step towards clinical implementation. The objective here is to externally validate the EPOS model for upper limb outcome 3 months poststroke in Switzerland and extend the model using an ARAT cut-off at 32 points. Methods Data from two prospective longitudinal cohort studies including first-ever stroke patients admitted to a Swiss stroke center were analyzed. The presence of finger extension and shoulder abduction was measured on days 1 and 8 poststroke in Cohort 1, and on days 3 and 9 in Cohort 2. Upper limb capacity was measured 3 months poststroke. Discrimination (area under the curve; AUC) and calibration obtained with the model were determined. Results In Cohort 1 (N = 39, median age 74 years), the AUC on day 1 was 0.78 (95%CI 0.61, 0.95) and 0.96 (95%CI 0.90, 1.00) on day 8, using the model of day 5. In Cohort 2 (N = 85, median age 69 years), the AUC was 0.96 (95%CI 0.93, 0.99) on day 3 and 0.89 (95% CI 0.80, 0.98) on day 9. Applying a 32-point ARAT cut-off resulted in an AUC ranging from 0.82 (95%CI 0.68, 0.95; Cohort 1, day 1) to 0.95 (95%CI 0.87, 1.00; Cohort 1, day 8). Conclusions The EPOS model was successfully validated in first-ever stroke patients with mild-to-moderate neurological impairments, who were independent before their stroke. Now, its impact on clinical practice should be investigated in this population. Testing the model’s performance in severe (recurrent) strokes and stratification of patients using the ARAT 32-point cut-off is required to enhance the model’s generalizability and potential clinical impact."

We have investigated the role of protein and fiber fractions of faba beans for colonic health and microbiota composition in a low-grade inflammation mice-model when incorporated in a Western diet (WD). The diet of sixty C57BL/6JRj male mice was standardized to a WD (41% fat, 43% carbohydrates) before were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 12) receiving either 1) WD with 30% of the protein replaced with faba-bean proteins, 2) WD with 7% of the fiber replaced with faba-bean fibers, 3) WD with protein and fiber fractions or 4) plain WD (n = 24). Low-grade inflammation was induced by 1% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) given to mice for the last six days of the trial. Half (n = 12) in group 4) were given only water (controls). Prior to DSS, body weight, energy intake, glucose and insulin tolerance assays were performed. Inflammatory status in the colon was assessed by biomarkers of inflammation and qRT-PCR analyses of inflammatory related genes. Fecal microbiota composition was assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 1% DSS treatment increased levels in fecal lipocalin-2 and induced disease activity index score, but the presence of faba bean fractions in WD did not influence these indicators nor the expression level of inflammatory associated genes. However, the mice that had faba-bean proteins had a lower amount of Proteobacteria compared the group on plain WD. The Actinobacteria abundance was also lower in the group that had fiber fraction from faba-beans. Overall, outcomes indicated that in a low-grade inflammation model, replacement of protein and or fiber in a WD with faba bean fractions had marginal effects on inflammatory parameters and colonic microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W4290667512,"The exclusion, or otherwise, of small-scale farmers by cooperatives determines whether they can be well engaged in the grand strategy of agricultural modernization. By identifying the exclusion pattern of cooperatives and using the field research data on farmers in Fuchuan, Guangxi, this study finds that cooperatives tend to screen their members via both explicit and implicit exclusion and that small-scale farmers are more likely to be excluded. The theoretical analysis conducted in this study reveals that excluding small-scale farmers is a rational choice made by cooperatives to pursue efficiency in the context of organizational form variation. Furthermore, cooperatives' organizational form variation and their decisions to exclude small-scale farmers are endogenous, thereby suggesting that cooperatives in China may become unions of rural elites. During the exploration of using cooperatives as a carrier to involve small-scale farmers in agricultural modernization, the phenomenon of cooperatives' exclusion of small-scale farmers needs to be highly emphasized."

However, despite promising results were achieved, the effects of human-robot interaction on human motor control and the recovery mechanisms induced with robot assistance can be further investigated even on healthy subjects before translating to clinical practice. In this study, we adopt a standard paradigm for upper-limb rehabilitation (a planar device with assistive control) with linear and challenging curvilinear trajectories to investigate the effect of the assistance in human-robot interaction in healthy people.Ten healthy subjects were instructed to perform a large set of radial and curvilinear movements in two interaction modes: 1) free movement (subjects hold the robot handle with no assistance) and 2) assisted movement (with a force tunnel assistance paradigm). Kinematics and EMGs from representative upper-limb muscles were recorded to extract phasic muscle synergies. The free and assisted interaction modes were compared assessing the level of assistance, error, and muscle synergy comparison between the two interaction modes.It was found that in free movement error magnitude is higher than with assistance, proving that task complexity required assistance also on healthy controls. Moreover, curvilinear tasks require more assistance than standard radial paths and error is higher. Interestingly, while assistance improved task performance, we found only a slight modification of phasic synergies when comparing assisted and free movement.We found that on healthy people, the effect of assistance was significant on task performance, but limited on muscle synergies. The findings of this study can find applications for assessing human-robot interaction and to design training to maximize motor recovery."
https://openalex.org/W4290742944,"The Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 checkpoint clamp activates the DNA damage response and promotes DNA repair. DNA loading on the central channel of the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complex is required to execute its biological functions. Because Rad9A has the highest DNA affinity among the three subunits, we determined the domains and functional residues of human Rad9A that are critical for DNA interaction. The N-terminal globular domain (residues 1-133) had 3.7-fold better DNA binding affinity than the C-terminal globular domain (residues 134-266) of Rad9A1-266. Rad9A1-266 binds DNA 16-, 60-, and 30-fold better than Rad9A1-133, Rad9A134-266, and Rad9A94-266, respectively, indicating that different regions cooperatively contribute to DNA binding. We show that basic residues including K11, K15, R22, K78, K220, and R223 are important for DNA binding. The reductions on DNA binding of Ala substituted mutants of these basic residues show synergistic effect and are dependent on their residential Rad9A deletion constructs. Interestingly, deletion of a loop (residues 160-163) of Rad9A94-266 weakens DNA binding activity by 4.1-fold as compared to wild-type (WT) Rad9A94-266. Cellular sensitivity to genotoxin of rad9A knockout cells is restored by expressing WT-Rad9Afull. However, rad9A knockout cells expressing Rad9A mutants defective in DNA binding are more sensitive to H2O2 as compared to cells expressing WT-Rad9Afull. Only the rad9A knockout cells expressing loop-deleted Rad9A mutant are more sensitive to hydroxyurea than cells expressing WT-Rad9A. In addition, Rad9A-DNA interaction is required for DNA damage signaling activation. Our results indicate that DNA association by Rad9A is critical for maintaining cell viability and checkpoint activation under stress."
https://openalex.org/W4290779356,"In this paper we evaluate the performance of point and interval estimators based on the maximum likelihood(ML) method for the nonlinear simplex regression model. Inferences based on traditional maximum likelihood estimation have good asymptotic properties, but their performance in small samples may not be satisfactory. At out set we consider the maximum likelihood estimation for the parameters of the nonlinear simplex regression model, and so we introduced a bootstrap-based correction for such estimators of this model. We also develop the percentile and bootstrap t confidence intervals for those parameters as competitors to the traditional approximate confidence interval based on the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs). We then numerically evaluate the performance of these different methods for estimating the simplex regression model. The numerical evidence favors inference based on the bootstrap method, in special the bootstrap t interval, which was decisive in an application to real data."

https://openalex.org/W4290666432,"Background Distribution of schistosomiasis is more focal due to spatial heterogeneities in intermediate host snail dynamics and water contact behavior of humans. This makes the search for new transmission foci of schistosomiasis and its connection with malacologically receptive water bodies essential for effective control of its transmission. This study was intended to assess the prevalence of intestinal helminth infections among schoolchildren and Schistosoma mansoni transmission in Koga irrigation scheme surroundings, northwest Ethiopia. Materials and methods Cross-sectional parasitological and malacological surveys were conducted in three schools and nearby water bodies, respectively around Koga irrigation scheme. Stool specimens were collected from 421 randomly selected schoolchildren and microscopically examined using Kato-Katz and formol-ether concentration methods. Malacological surveys were carried out and the identified Biomphalaria pfeifferi snails were screened for schistosome infection. Swiss albino mice were exposed to schistosome cercariae shed by Biomphalaria pfeifferi for definite identification of Schistosoma species. Results Among the examined schoolchildren, 22.6% (95% CI: 18.7%-26.9%) were positive for at least one intestinal helminths species. Ascaris lumbricoides was the most frequent intestinal helminth detected among forty (9.5%) children. Schistosoma mansoni was detected among 4.8% (95% CI: 2.9%-7.2%) of children and its prevalence was significantly higher among male children (p = 0.038) and those attending in Mengesha Jemberie Primary School (p = 0.044). Biomphalaria pfeifferi snails were identified in water bodies in close proximity to Mengesha Jemberie and Wotete Abay Primay schools. Schistosoma mansoni adult worms were harvested after exposure of mice to cercariae shed from Biomphalaria pfeifferi snails collected from water bodies nearby Mengesha Jemberie Primary School. Conclusions Schistosoma mansoni infection of schoolchildren, findings of schistosome infected snails and establishment of mice infection confirm that transmission is taking place in the study areas. Hence, snail control and other measures such as provision of sanitary facilities and health education are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4290667464,"Acceptance of animal research by the public depends on several characteristics of the specific experimental study. In particular, acceptance decreases as potential animal pain or distress increases. Our objective in this study was to quantify the magnitude of pain/distress that university undergraduate students and faculty would find to be justifiable in animal research, and to see how that justifiability varied according to the purpose of the research, or the species to which the animal belonged. We also evaluate how demographic characteristics of respondents may be associated with their opinions about justifiability. To accomplish this goal, we developed and administered a survey to students and faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Our survey employed Likert-style questions that asked them to designate the level of animal pain or distress that they felt was justifiable for each of the following six purposes—animal disease, human disease, basic research, human medicine, chemical testing, or cosmetic testing. These questions were asked about five different species of animals including monkeys, dogs/cats, pig/sheep, rats/mice, or small fish. We used the data to establish a purpose-specific pain/distress scale, a species-specific pain/distress scale, and a composite pain/distress scale that, for each respondent, averaged the extent of justifiable pain/distress across all purposes and species. For purpose, students were more likely to choose higher levels of pain for animal disease research, followed by human disease, basic research, human medicine, chemical testing, and cosmetic testing. Faculty were more likely to choose the same level of pain for the first four purposes, followed by lower levels of pain for chemical and cosmetic testing. For species, students were more likely to choose higher levels of pain for small fish and rats/mice (tied), pigs/sheep and monkeys (tied), than for dogs/cats. For faculty, order from least to most justifiable pain/distress was small fish, rats/mice, pigs/sheep, then dogs/cats and monkeys (the latter two tied). Interestingly, exploratory factor analysis of the pain/distress scales indicated that when it comes to justifying higher levels of pain and distress, respondents identified two distinct categories of purposes, chemical and cosmetic testing, for which respondents were less likely to justify higher levels of pain or distress as compared to other purposes; and two distinct categories of species, small fish and rats/mice, for which respondents were more likely to justify higher levels of pain/distress than other species. We found that the spread of acceptance of animal research was much smaller when survey questions included pain/distress compared to when only purpose or species were part of the question. Demographically, women, vegetarians/vegans, and respondents with no experience in animal research justified less animal pain/distress than their counterparts. Not surprisingly, a lower level of support for animal research in general was correlated with lower justifiability of pain/distress. Based on these findings, we discuss the role of animal pain/distress in regulatory considerations underlying decisions about whether to approve specific animal uses, and suggest ways to strengthen the ethical review and public acceptance of animal research."
https://openalex.org/W4290667492,"Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a promising technology for environmental monitoring with a lot of undeveloped potential due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the data. If temporal effects are studied, such as in a monitoring context, the analysis becomes more challenging as time is added to the dimensions of space (image coordinates) and wavelengths. We conducted a series of laboratory experiments to investigate the impact of different stressor exposure patterns on the spectrum of the cold water coral Desmophyllum pertusum. 65 coral samples were divided into 12 groups, each group being exposed to different types and levels of particles. Hyperspectral images of the coral samples were collected at four time points from prior to exposure to 6 weeks after exposure. To investigate the relationships between the corals' spectral signatures and controlled experimental parameters, a new software tool for interactive visual exploration was developed and applied, the HypIX (Hyperspectral Image eXplorer) web tool. HypIX combines principles from exploratory data analysis, information visualization and machine learning-based dimension reduction. This combination enables users to select regions of interest (ROI) in all dimensions (2D space, time point and spectrum) for a flexible integrated inspection. We propose two HypIX workflows to find relationships in time series of hyperspectral datasets, namely morphology-based filtering workflow and embedded driven response analysis workflow. With these HypIX workflows three users identified different temporal and spatial patterns in the spectrum of corals exposed to different particle stressor conditions. Corals exposed to particles tended to have a larger change rate than control corals, which was evident as a shifted spectrum. The responses, however, were not uniform for coral samples undergoing the same exposure treatments, indicating individual tolerance levels. We also observed a good inter-observer agreement between the three HyPIX users, indicating that the proposed workflow can be applied to obtain reproducible HSI analysis results."
https://openalex.org/W4290779621,"Correlation is considered the most important factor in analyzing the data in statistics. It is used to measure the movement of two different variables linearly. The concept of correlation is well-known and used in different fields to measure the association between two variables. The hesitant 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic set (H2FLS) comes out to be valuable in addressing people’s reluctant subjective data. The purpose of this paper is to analyze new correlation measures between H2FLSs and apply them in the decision-making process. First and foremost, the ideas of mean and variance of hesitant 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic elements (H2FLEs) are introduced. Then, a new correlation coefficient between H2FLSs is established. In addition, considering that different H2FLEs may have different criteria weights, the weighted correlation coefficient and ordered weighted correlation coefficient are further investigated. A practical example concerning the detailed procedure of solving problems is exemplified to feature the reasonableness and attainability of the proposed technique in situations where the criteria weights are either known or unknown. When the weight vector is unknown, the best-worst method (BWM) is used to acquire the criteria weights in the context of a hesitant 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic environment. Furthermore, a comparative study is undertaken with current techniques to provide a vision into the design decision-making process. Finally, it is verified that the proposed correlation coefficient between H2FLSs is more satisfactory than the extant ones, and the correlation coefficient with the weights of criteria being either known or unknown is applicable."
https://openalex.org/W4290779661,"Norepinephrine is a key sympathetic neurotransmitter, which acts to suppress CD8 + T cell cytokine secretion and lytic activity by signaling through the β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2). Although ADRB2 signaling is considered generally immunosuppressive, its role in regulating the differentiation of effector T cells in response to infection has not been investigated. Using an adoptive transfer approach, we compared the expansion and differentiation of wild type (WT) to Adrb2-/- CD8 + T cells throughout the primary response to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection in vivo. We measured the dynamic changes in transcriptome profiles of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells as they responded to VSV. Within the first 7 days of infection, WT cells out-paced the expansion of Adrb2-/- cells, which correlated with reduced expression of IL-2 and the IL-2Rα in the absence of ADRB2. RNASeq analysis identified over 300 differentially expressed genes that were both temporally regulated following infection and selectively regulated in WT vs Adrb2-/- cells. These genes contributed to major transcriptional pathways including cytokine receptor activation, signaling in cancer, immune deficiency, and neurotransmitter pathways. By parsing genes within groups that were either induced or repressed over time in response to infection, we identified three main branches of genes that were differentially regulated by the ADRB2. These gene sets were predicted to be regulated by specific transcription factors involved in effector T cell development, such as Tbx21 and Eomes. Collectively, these data demonstrate a significant role for ADRB2 signaling in regulating key transcriptional pathways during CD8 + T cells responses to infection that may dramatically impact their functional capabilities and downstream memory cell development."

Benefits of exercise during pregnancy include; prevention of gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and reduced low back pain. Therefore this study is done to assess knowledge, attitude and practice towards antenatal exercise among pregnant women who are attending antenatal care at health centers of Mekelle, Tigray Region, Ethiopia.For this study cross-sectional study design was used. It was conducted from October 2019 up to January 2020 among 255 pregnant women who are attending antenatal care at selected health centers of Mekelle city. After the data were collected it was entered into epi-data 4.2.0 and was analyzed by using SPSS version 23.Among the study participants of pregnant women 51%, 56% and 16.6% had good knowledge, positive attitude and practice towards antenatal exercise respectively. Among those 38.8%, 45.9% and 49.8% were expressed as antenatal exercise can decrease back pain, prevents excessive weight gain and increase energy and stamina during pregnancy respectively. Among those who practiced antenatal exercise, 95% and 83.4% was practicing with frequency ≥ three times per week and ≥20 minutes of the duration of exercise per session respectively.Generally, this study showed that the level of knowledge, attitude and practice of pregnant mothers regarding antenatal exercise is poor. Therefore, health care providers who work on maternal health (Gynecologists, Midwives, Nurses, Health extension workers and other community workers) should provide counseling and health education on antenatal exercise."
https://openalex.org/W4291020472,"Although compression therapy is well established for patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and chronic venous disease (CVD), considerable variation exists in its organization in clinical practice which may impact patient outcomes. The current study aims to deepen our understanding of the main drivers of the complex care organization for compression therapy and to identify targets for improvement.This realist evaluation includes a mixed-method design consisting of semi-structured interviews with patients and health care professionals involved in compression therapy (n = 30), stakeholder meetings (n = 2) and surveys (n = 114). Data were collected to create the content of context-mechanism-outcome-configurations (CMOcs) important in compression therapy. Based on these CMOcs, targets for improvement to optimize the organization of compression care were identified.We identified overarching context factors and mechanisms targeting four optimal outcomes for the organization of compression therapy: selecting initial compression therapy types that support patient's self-reliance (1), evidence based selection of elastic compression stocking type and class (2), patient-based selection of assistive devices (3), individualizing treatment duration for DVT patients (4a) and providing follow-up for CVD patients (4b). We found that increasing health care professionals' knowledge of compression therapy, the availability of unambiguous protocols and guidelines, increasing patient involvement (and if applicable their informal care giver) in the decision making process, the accessible availability of resources, and increasing interdisciplinary consultation enhanced desirable outcomes. These targets triggered mechanisms such as increased health care professionals' willingness, confidence and motivation to provide patient-based care and increased patients' self-confidence and self-efficacy.This study provides a detailed insight into what needs to be in place to optimize compression care and identified five main targets for improvement."
https://openalex.org/W4290666498,"With 36 players on the field, congestion in Australian football is an important consideration in identifying passing capacity, assessing fan enjoyment, and evaluating the effect of rule changes. However, no current method of objectively measuring congestion has been reported. This study developed two methods to measure congestion in Australian football. The first continuously determined the number of players situated within various regions of density at successive time intervals during a match using density-based clustering to group players as ‘primary’, ‘secondary’, or ‘outside’. The second method aimed to classify the level of congestion a player experiences (high, nearby, or low) when disposing of the ball using the Random Forest algorithm. Both approaches were developed using data from the 2019 and 2021 Australian Football League (AFL) regular seasons, considering contextual variables, such as field position and quarter. Player tracking data and match event data from professional male players were collected from 56 matches performed at a single stadium. The random forest model correctly classified disposals in high congestion (0.89 precision, 0.86 recall, 0.96 AUC) and low congestion (0.98 precision, 0.86 recall, 0.96 AUC) at a higher rate compared to disposals nearby congestion (0.72 precision, 0.88 recall, 0.88 AUC). Overall, both approaches enable a more efficient method to quantify the characteristics of congestion more effectively, thereby eliminating manual input from human coders and allowing for a future comparison between additional contextual variables, such as, seasons, rounds, and teams."
https://openalex.org/W4290667481,"Pyrethroid insecticides are widely used to control mosquitoes that transmit pathogens such as West Nile virus (WNV) to people. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the knockdown resistance locus (kdr) of the voltage gated sodium channel (Vgsc) gene in Culex mosquitoes are associated with knockdown resistance to pyrethroids. RNAseq was used to sequence the coding region of Vgsc for Culex tarsalis Coquillett and Culex erythrothorax Dyar, two WNV vectors. The cDNA sequences were used to develop a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR assay that detects the L1014F kdr mutation in the Vgsc. Because this locus is conserved, the assay was used successfully in six Culex spp. The resulting Culex RTkdr assay was validated using quantitative PCR and sequencing of PCR products. The accuracy of the Culex RTkdr assay was 99%. The L1014F kdr mutation associated with pyrethroid resistance was more common among Cx. pipiens than other Culex spp. and was more prevalent in mosquitoes collected near farmland. The Culex RTkdr assay takes advantage of the RNA that vector control agencies routinely isolate to assess arbovirus prevalence in mosquitoes. We anticipate that public health and vector control agencies may employ the Culex RTkdr assay to define the geographic distribution of the L1014F kdr mutation in Culex species and improve the monitoring of insecticide resistance that will ultimately contribute to effective control of Culex mosquitoes."

Although diabetes predominantly affects men, women with diabetes have specific risks and self-management characteristics. Women have a higher risk of either presenting with or developing depression or anxiety, as well as being high users of complementary medicine which can create clinical governance issues. In spite of these known gender differences, limited research has explored gender-specific diabetes care, especially health service use patterns. As increasing attention has turned to supporting people with diabetes to successfully self-manage their diabetes, it is important that we understand how women with diabetes are using health services, and if their specific risk profile is influencing their health care choices. Our study sought to examine the relationship between mental health status and the patterns of conventional and complementary medicine health service use by women diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Our results showed that women with diabetes and any mental health co-morbidity were more likely to visit their general practitioner more frequently or use herbal medicine than those without a mental health co-morbidity. Women with depression and anxiety were also less likely to consult a physiotherapist and those with anxiety less likely to consult a podiatrist over time when compared to the other mental health groups."
https://openalex.org/W4290779425,"Introduction Despite evidence suggesting an association between influenza infection and increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the older adult population (aged 65 years or above), little is known about its near-term risks in middle-aged adults (aged 45 to 64 years). This study aims to estimate the risks of and association between severe influenza infection requiring hospitalization and subsequent AMI within 12 months in middle-aged adults. Method This is a retrospective case-control analysis of territorywide registry data of people aged 45 to 64 years admitting from up to 43 public hospitals in Hong Kong during a 20-year period from January 1997 to December 2017. The exposure was defined as severe influenza infection documented as the principal diagnosis using International Classification of Diseases codes and non-exposure as hospitalization for orthopedic surgery. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk of subsequent hospitalization for AMI within 12 months following the exposure. Results Among 30,657 middle-aged adults with an indexed hospitalization, 8,840 (28.8%) had an influenza-associated hospitalization. 81 (0.92%) were subsequently rehospitalized with AMI within 12 months after the indexed hospitalization. Compared with the control group, the risk of subsequent hospitalization for AMI was significantly increased (odds ratio [OR]: 2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.64–3.92, p&lt;0.001). The association remained significant even after adjusting for potential confounders (adjusted OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.11–2.95, p = 0.02). Patients with a history of hypertension, but not those with diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia or atrial fibrillation/flutter, were at increased risk (adjusted OR: 5.01, 95% CI: 2.93–8.56, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion Subsequent hospitalization for AMI within 12 months following an indexed respiratory hospitalization for severe influenza increased nearly two-fold compared with the non-cardiopulmonary, non-exposure control. Recommendation of influenza vaccination extending to middle-aged adult population may be justified for the small but significant increased near-term risk of AMI."
https://openalex.org/W4290779434,"Upon graduation, international students studying abroad often have to decide whether to stay local or return home. We investigate university graduates' mobility from the perspective of social capital theory. An empirical study of mainland Chinese university students' intention to remain in Hong Kong upon completion of their university studies was conducted. An online survey was used to recruit the participants. In total, 155 valid questionnaires were received, with a response rate of 40.8%. Structural capital and relational capital were found to be the important factors affecting mainland Chinese students' intention to stay in a linear manner. Cognitive capital self-moderated the relationship between cognitive capital and intention to stay. Cognitive capital affected the intention to stay in a non-linear way. We make a unique contribution to the field by showing that 1) the effect of cognitive capital is quadratic rather than linear; 2) relational capital is more important to female students than to male students; and 3) structural capital is more important to senior year university degree students than to junior year degree students. The theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4290779465,"Appropriate inspection protocols and mitigation strategies are a critical component of effective biosecurity measures, enabling implementation of sound management decisions. Statistical models to analyze biosecurity surveillance data are integral to this decision-making process. Our research focuses on analyzing border interception biosecurity data collected from a Class A Nature Reserve, Barrow Island, in Western Australia and the associated covariates describing both spatial and temporal interception patterns. A clustering analysis approach was adopted using a generalization of the popular k-means algorithm appropriate for mixed-type data. The analysis approach compared the efficiency of clustering using only the numerical data, then subsequently including covariates to the clustering. Based on numerical data only, three clusters gave an acceptable fit and provided information about the underlying data characteristics. Incorporation of covariates into the model suggested four distinct clusters dominated by physical location and type of detection. Clustering increases interpretability of complex models and is useful in data mining to highlight patterns to describe underlying processes in biosecurity and other research areas. Availability of more relevant data would greatly improve the model. Based on outcomes from our research we recommend broader use of cluster models in biosecurity data, with testing of these models on more datasets to validate the model choice and identify important explanatory variables."
https://openalex.org/W4290779484,"Severe complications from COVID-19 and poor responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were commonly reported in cancer patients compared to those without cancer. Therefore, the identification of predisposing factors to SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients would assist in the prevention of COVID-19 and improve vaccination strategies. The literature lacks reports on this topic from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Therefore, we studied clinical and laboratory data of 139 cancer patients from King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, KSA.The cancer patients fall into three categories; (i) uninfected with SARS-CoV-2 pre-vaccination and remained uninfected post-vaccination (control group; n = 114; 81%), (ii) pre-vaccination infected group (n = 16; 11%), or (iii) post-vaccination infected group (n = 9; 6%). Next, the clinical and lab data of the three groups of patients were investigated.Comorbidity factors like diabetes and hemodialysis were associated with the risk of infection in cancer patients before the vaccination (p<0.05). In contrast to breast cancer, papillary thyroid cancer was more prevalent in the infected patients pre- and post-vaccination (p<0.05). Pre-vaccination infected group had earlier cancer stages compared with the control group (p = 0.01). On the other hand, combined therapy was less commonly administrated to the infected groups versus the control group (p<0.05). Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was lower in the post-vaccination infected group compared to the control group (p = 0.01).Collectively, this is the first study from KSA to report potential risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients pre- and post-vaccination. Further investigations on these risk factors in a larger cohort are worthwhile to draw a definitive conclusion about their roles in predisposing cancer patients to the infection."

Several studies have validated the use of the SpotOn sensor for measuring core temperature in adults, but studies on pediatric patients are still lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of the SpotOn sensor compared with that of esophageal temperature measurement in pediatric patients intraoperatively. Children aged 1–8 years with American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Condition Classification I or II scheduled to undergo elective ear surgery for at least 30 min under general anesthesia were enrolled. Body core temperature was measured every 15 min after induction till the end of anesthesia with an esophageal probe, axillary probe, and SpotOn sensor. We included 49 patients, providing a total 466 paired measurements. Analysis of Pearson rank correlation between SpotOn and esophageal pairs showed a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92–0.94). Analysis of Pearson rank correlation between esophageal and axillary pairs gave a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.89 (95% CI 0.87–0.91). Between the SpotOn and esophageal groups, Bland-Altman analysis revealed a bias (SD, 95% limits of agreement) of -0.07 (0.17 [-0.41–0.28]). Between the esophageal and axillary groups, Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias (SD, 95% limits of agreement) of 0.45 (0.22 [0–0.89]).
