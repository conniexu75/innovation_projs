https://openalex.org/W2101037339,"Fibroblasts often constitute the majority of the stromal cells within a breast carcinoma, yet the functional contributions of these cells to tumorigenesis are poorly understood. Using a coimplantation tumor xenograft model, we demonstrate that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) extracted from human breast carcinomas promote the growth of admixed breast carcinoma cells significantly more than do normal mammary fibroblasts derived from the same patients. The CAFs, which exhibit the traits of myofibroblasts, play a central role in promoting the growth of tumor cells through their ability to secrete stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1); CAFs promote angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) into carcinomas, an effect mediated in part by SDF-1. CAF-secreted SDF-1 also stimulates tumor growth directly, acting through the cognate receptor, CXCR4, which is expressed by carcinoma cells. Our findings indicate that fibroblasts within invasive breast carcinomas contribute to tumor promotion in large part through the secretion of SDF-1."

https://openalex.org/W2006013721,"We have undertaken a functional analysis of the odorant receptor repertoire in the Drosophila antenna. Each receptor was expressed in a mutant olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) used as a “decoder,” and the odor response spectrum conferred by the receptor was determined in vivo by electrophysiological recordings. The spectra of these receptors were then matched to those of defined ORNs to establish a receptor-to-neuron map. In addition to the odor response spectrum, the receptors dictate the signaling mode, i.e., excitation or inhibition, and the response dynamics of the neuron. An individual receptor can mediate both excitatory and inhibitory responses to different odorants in the same cell, suggesting a model of odorant receptor transduction. Receptors vary widely in their breadth of tuning, and odorants vary widely in the number of receptors they activate. Together, these properties provide a molecular basis for odor coding by the receptor repertoire of an olfactory organ."
https://openalex.org/W2081777956,"The POU-domain transcription factor Oct-4 is normally expressed in pluripotent cells of the mammalian embryo. In addition, germ-cell tumors and a few somatic tumors show detectable expression of Oct-4. While Oct-4's role during preimplantation development is to maintain embryonic cells in a pluripotent state, little is known about its potential oncogenic properties. Here we investigate the effect of ectopic Oct-4 expression on somatic tissues of adult mice using a doxycycline-dependent expression system. Activation of Oct-4 results in dysplastic growths in epithelial tissues that are dependent on continuous Oct-4 expression. Dysplastic lesions show an expansion of progenitor cells and increased beta-catenin transcriptional activity. In the intestine, Oct-4 expression causes dysplasia by inhibiting cellular differentiation in a manner similar to that in embryonic cells. These data show that certain adult progenitors remain competent to interpret key embryonic signals and support the notion that progenitor cells are a driving force in tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2167463357,"The microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) is reoriented between the nucleus and the leading edge in many migrating cells and contributes to directional migration. Models suggest that the MTOC is moved to its position during reorientation. By direct imaging of wound-edge fibroblasts after triggering MTOC reorientation with soluble factors, we found instead that the nucleus moved away from the leading edge to reorient the MTOC, while the MTOC remained stationary. Rearward nuclear movement was coupled with actin retrograde flow and was regulated by a pathway involving Cdc42, MRCK, myosin, and actin. Nuclear movement was unaffected by the inhibition of dynein, Par6, or PKCzeta, yet these components were essential for MTOC reorientation, as they maintained the MTOC at the cell centroid. These results show that nuclear repositioning is an initial polarizing event in migrating cells and that the positions of the nucleus and the MTOC are established by separate regulatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1996516839,"The xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein complex plays a key role in recognizing DNA damage throughout the genome for mammalian nucleotide excision repair (NER). Ultraviolet light (UV)-damaged DNA binding protein (UV-DDB) is another complex that appears to be involved in the recognition of NER-inducing damage, although the precise role it plays and its relationship to XPC remain to be elucidated. Here we show that XPC undergoes reversible ubiquitylation upon UV irradiation of cells and that this depends on the presence of functional UV-DDB activity. XPC and UV-DDB were demonstrated to interact physically, and both are polyubiquitylated by the recombinant UV-DDB-ubiquitin ligase complex. The polyubiquitylation altered the DNA binding properties of XPC and UV-DDB and appeared to be required for cell-free NER of UV-induced (6-4) photoproducts specifically when UV-DDB was bound to the lesion. Our results strongly suggest that ubiquitylation plays a critical role in the transfer of the UV-induced lesion from UV-DDB to XPC."
https://openalex.org/W2147987903,"We describe a method termed MADM (mosaic analysis with double markers) in mice that allows simultaneous labeling and gene knockout in clones of somatic cells or isolated single cells in vivo. Two reciprocally chimeric genes, each containing the N terminus of one marker and the C terminus of the other marker interrupted by a loxP-containing intron, are knocked in at identical locations on homologous chromosomes. Functional expression of markers requires Cre-mediated interchromosomal recombination. MADM reveals that interchromosomal recombination can be induced efficiently in vivo in both mitotic and postmitotic cells in all tissues examined. It can be used to create conditional knockouts in small populations of labeled cells, to determine cell lineage, and to trace neuronal connections. To illustrate the utility of MADM, we show that cerebellar granule cell progenitors are fated at an early stage to produce granule cells with axonal projections limited to specific sublayers of the cerebellar cortex.

Genetic mosaics, in which somatic cells of different genotypes reside in the same animal, have been widely used to study biological processes in multicellular organisms. By knocking out a candidate gene of interest in a defined population of cells at a desirable time, one can study gene function in biological processes of interest while bypassing possible requirements for the gene in other tissues or at earlier developmental stages. One can also analyze the cell autonomy of gene function and create animal models of human diseases that result from somatic mutations. For example, conditional knockouts of tumor suppressor genes can serve as models for human cancers caused by loss of heterozygosity (Knudson, 1971Knudson Jr., A.G. Mutation and cancer: statistical study of retinoblastoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1971; 68: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (5203) Google Scholar). Several methods have been employed to create genetically mosaic animals (Zugates and Lee, 2004Zugates C.T. Lee T. Genetic mosaic analysis in the nervous system.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Genetic mosaics in mice are usually created via a conditional knockout procedure utilizing Cre-loxP mediated intrachromosomal recombination. In this strategy, two loxP sites are inserted flanking an essential part of a candidate gene (creating a floxed allele) by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Cre recombinase, supplied as a transgene under the control of specific promoters, dictates the temporal and spatial specificity of the loss of the candidate gene by intrachromosomal excision in animals homozygous for a floxed allele or heterozygous for a floxed and a null allele (Gu et al., 1994Gu H. Marth J.D. Orban P.C. Mossmann H. Rajewsky K. Deletion of a DNA polymerase beta gene segment in T cells using cell type-specific gene targeting.Science. 1994; 265: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar, Lewandoski, 2001Lewandoski M. Conditional control of gene expression in the mouse.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, a different strategy utilizing interchromosomal recombination prior to cell division (mitotic recombination) has been widely used to create genetically mosaic animals. This strategy employs a yeast site-specific FLP recombinase that mediates high frequency recombination at homologous chromosomal loci bearing the FLP recognition target (FRT; Golic and Lindquist, 1989Golic K.G. Lindquist S. The FLP recombinase of yeast catalyzes site-specific recombination in the Drosophila genome.Cell. 1989; 59: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). FLP is supplied as a transgene driven by specific promoters to direct mitotic recombination at the desired time and tissue. By placing FRT sites at the bases of major chromosomal arms, FLP-FRT-mediated mitotic recombination allows the vast majority of Drosophila genes to be subjected to mosaic analysis and permits forward genetic screens to be conducted in mosaic animals (Xu and Rubin, 1993Xu T. Rubin G.M. Analysis of genetic mosaics in developing and adult Drosophila tissues.Development. 1993; 117: 1223-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mitotic recombination-based mosaic analysis has advantages over the aforementioned conditional knockout method in mice. It can be used with spontaneously generated or chemically induced mutations and does not involve engineering floxed alleles on a gene-by-gene basis. To facilitate genetic mosaic analysis, it is essential to mark cells of different genotypes in mosaic animals. In mice, existing methods for simultaneous conditional gene knockout and labeling include using an independent Cre reporter, inserting a marker gene directly downstream of a floxed allele, or juxtaposing a reporter to the endogenous promoter by Cre-induced inversion (Lewandoski, 2001Lewandoski M. Conditional control of gene expression in the mouse.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, Schnütgen et al., 2003Schnütgen F. Doerflinger N. Calleja C. Wendling O. Chambon P. Ghyselinck N.B. A directional strategy for monitoring Cre-mediated recombination at the cellular level in the mouse.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The first method cannot guarantee 100% coupling of knockout and labeling, especially for gene knockout in small populations of cells. The latter two methods allow 100% coupling but rely on the endogenous promoter to drive marker expression, which may be turned off or too weak at the time of analysis. In Drosophila, mosaic marking was originally accomplished using a negative labeling system in which homozygous mutant cells lose a marker gene and become the only unlabeled cells in genetically mosaic animals (Xu and Rubin, 1993Xu T. Rubin G.M. Analysis of genetic mosaics in developing and adult Drosophila tissues.Development. 1993; 117: 1223-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, small clones of unlabeled homozygous mutant cells can be difficult to identify amid a large population of labeled cells, and the morphology of these mutant cells cannot be studied. To circumvent these limitations, we developed the MARCM system (mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker) to selectively label homozygous mutant cells after FLP-FRT-induced mitotic recombination (Lee and Luo, 1999Lee T. Luo L. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker for studies of gene function in neuronal morphogenesis.Neuron. 1999; 22: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar), offering high-resolution phenotypic analysis of gene function in complex processes ranging from neuronal morphogenesis (e.g., Lee et al., 2001Lee C.H.

A genetic screen in Drosophila for metastatic behavior.Science. 2003; 302: 1227-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Because MARCM allows labeling of a single cell or a group of cells that share a common progenitor, it has become a powerful tool for analyzing the relationship between neuronal lineage and wiring pattern (Lee et al., 1999Lee T. Lee A. Luo L.

Representation of the glomerular olfactory map in the Drosophila brain.Cell. 2002; 109: 243-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In principle, the Cre-loxP recombination system could be used to induce mitotic recombination in mouse somatic cells in a similar fashion to FLP-FRT-mediated mitotic recombination in Drosophila. However, Drosophila is unique among model organisms in that homologous chromosomes pair in somatic cells, permitting a high rate of mitotic recombination (Metz, 1916Metz C.W. Chromosome studies on the Diptera II: the paired association of chromosomes in the Diptera, and its significance.J. Exp. Zool. 1916; 21: 213-279Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It remained uncertain whether the frequency of interchromosomal recombination would be sufficient for use in mosaic analysis in mice. Previous studies in mouse ES cells have reported that the frequency of Cre-loxP-mediated recombination, as assayed by formation of drug-resistant colonies following transient Cre transfection, was on the order of 10−7 to 10−4 between nonhomologous chromosomes (Ramirez-Solis et al., 1995Ramirez-Solis R. Liu P. Bradley A. Chromosome engineering in mice.Nature. 1995; 378: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, Smith et al., 1995Smith A.J. De Sousa M.A. Kwabi-Addo B. Heppell-Parton A.

Biol. 2000; 20: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar); recombination between the same loci on homologous chromosomes had an increased efficiency of 10−4 to ∼5 × 10−2 depending on the chromosomal locus tested (Liu et al., 2002Liu P. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Efficient Cre-loxP-induced mitotic recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, Koike et al., 2002Koike H. Horie K. Fukuyama H. Kondoh G. Nagata S. Takeda J. Efficient biallelic mutagenesis with Cre/loxP-mediated inter-chromosomal recombination.EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Constitutive Cre expression in ES cells further increased the rate of recombination (Liu et al., 2002Liu P. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Efficient Cre-loxP-induced mitotic recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that if Cre-loxP-mediated interchromosomal recombination occurs in somatic cells at rates similar to ES cells, it can be used to create genetic mosaics, provided that one can develop a sensitive marking system to identify recombination events. Here, we describe a system utilizing Cre-loxP to generate and mark recombination events between homologous chromosomes in somatic cells of mice. We show that interchromosomal recombination can be induced efficiently in both mitotic and postmitotic cells as a consequence of Cre expression. We discuss the potential utility of this system in conditional gene knockout, lineage analysis, and neural circuit tracing. As an example, we show that cerebellar granule cell progenitors are fated at an early stage to produce granule cells that project axons to specific sublayers in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex. MADM makes use of Cre-loxP-dependent interchromosomal mitotic recombination to generate uniquely labeled homozygous mutant cells in an otherwise heterozygous background in mice. Figure 1 illustrates the MADM design. Two reciprocally chimeric marker genes are separately targeted by homologous recombination to identical loci on homologous chromosomes; the resultant mice are crossed to each other to make transheterozygotes. Each chimeric gene consists of part of the coding sequences of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (Dsred2; hereafter referred to as RFP; Figure 1A; these chimeric genes are referred to as GR and RG hereafter). The N- and C-terminals of each chimeric gene are separated by an intron containing a single loxP site. While this pair of loxP sites serves as a target for Cre-mediated interchromosomal recombination, protein expression is unaffected since the loxP sites are removed by RNA splicing. In the absence of recombination, these chimeric genes do not produce functional proteins because their coding sequences are interrupted by the intron in different reading frames. After DNA replication in dividing cells (at the G2 phase), Cre enzyme introduced as a separate transgene can induce recombination between loxP sites, restoring functional GFP and RFP expression cassettes. During the subsequent mitosis, two types of chromosomal segregations are possible. X segregation (two recombinant sister chromatids segregate into different daughter cells) produces two daughter cells, each capable of expressing one of the two functional fluorescent proteins (red or green). Z segregation (two recombinant sister chromatids segregate into the same daughter cell) generates one daughter cell that resembles the parental cell (colorless) and a second daughter cell expressing both fluorescent proteins (double colored) (Figure 1A). Recombination can also occur in the G1 phase of the cell cycle or in postmitotic cells (G0). In both cases, functional GFP and RFP are restored simultaneously, resulting in double-colored cells (Figure 1B). If one chromosome contains a mutation of interest distal to the GR knockin site (the homologous chromosome contains only RG), the animal will be heterozygous for the mutation. However, G2 recombination followed by X segregation (referred to hereafter as a G2-X event) generates green daughter cells homozygous for the mutation and red siblings homozygous for the wild-type allele, creating labeled genetic mosaics (Figure 1A, left branch). G2-Z, G1, or G0 events do not alter the heterozygous genotype and do not result in the generation of single-labeled cells (Figure 1A, right branch; Figure 1B). Thus, recombination/segregation events that alter genotypes (G2-X) can be unambiguously distinguished from other recombination events that do not alter genotypes. Only homozygous cells are singly labeled. Furthermore, homozygous mutant and wild-type cells are distinguished by which single marker they express. We generated three targeting constructs, GG, GR, and RG (Figure 2A ). Each construct contains the same expression cassette consisting of a CMV β-actin enhancer-promoter (pCA; Okada et al., 1999Okada A. Lansford R. Weimann J.M. Fraser S.E. McConnell S.K. Imaging cells in the developing nervous system with retrovirus expressing modified green fluorescent protein.Exp. Neurol. 1999; 156: 394-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, Niwa et al., 1991Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Efficient selection for high-expression transfectants with a novel eukaryotic vector.Gene. 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4424) Google Scholar) and the SV40 T antigen poly(A) signal that allows for ubiquitous and high-level expression of marker genes. GR and RG were built according to the MADM strategy (Figure 1A). GG, in which N-GFP and C-GFP in the same reading frame are separated by the same loxP-containing β-globin intron, serves as a positive control for promoter strength, splicing efficiency, and the influence of chromosomal locus on transgene expression. We also constructed an RR construct equivalent to GG for in vitro testing. Experiments were conducted to confirm marker expression along the construction of the final targeting vector (Figure 2A). The splicing efficiency of the loxP-containing intron was confirmed by Western blot analysis following COS cell transfection of the GG and RR constructs—they express proteins at the same level as intronless constructs (data not shown). The expression level was also tested in neurons by biolistic transfection of rat hippocampal slices (Nakayama et al., 2000Nakayama A.Y. Harms M.B. Luo L. Small GTPases Rac and Rho in the maintenance of dendritic spines and branches in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5329-5338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GFP labeled axons and the entire dendritic trees including dendritic spines (Figure 2B, left, inset). Since RFP fluorescence is markedly weaker compared with GFP (data not shown), a MYC tag was added to the C terminus of RFP to ensure detection (Figure 2B, right). Functional restoration of GFP/RFP in the chimeric constructs (lacking the Neor cassette) was verified by cotransfecting GFP/RFP chimeras and a Cre-expressing construct into hippocampal slices. Double-colored cells were only generated when all three constructs were cotransfected (Figure 2C), indicating that Cre could catalyze interplasmid recombination that reconstitutes GFP and RFP. Having validated the chimeric marker approach in vitro, a loxP-neomycin resistance (Neor) gene was inserted into the intron of GG, GR, and RG for positive selection of homologous recombination events in ES cells. These constructs were knocked in at the ROSA26 locus (Soriano, 1999Soriano P. Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar) on the long arm of mouse chromosome 6 to test the MADM strategy in vivo. ROSA26 was chosen because of the following advantages: First, ROSA26 allows ubiquitous expression of the inserted gene (Zambrowicz et al., 1997Zambrowicz B.P. Imamoto A. Fiering S. Herzenberg L.A. Kerr W.G. Soriano P. Disruption of overlapping transcripts in the ROSA beta geo 26 gene trap strain leads to widespread expression of beta-galactosidase in mouse embryos and hematopoietic cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 3789-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Even though our chimeric genes contain their own ubiquitously active promoter, targeting at the ROSA26 locus alleviates concerns about silencing effects of local chromatin structure. Second, mice homozygous for ROSA26 targeted insertions do not exhibit detectable phenotypes (Soriano, 1999Soriano P. Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar). This is critical because MADM requires knockin cassettes at the locus for both homologous chromosomes. We generated GG, GR, and RG knockin mice using standard ES cell-based homologous recombination. As expected in the GG strain, GFP is ubiquitously produced from embryo to adult in the brain (Figure 3A ) and all other tissues examined (data not shown). Nearly 100% of cells dissociated from the brain and spleen were GFP positive by fluorescence microscopy or by FACS analysis (data not shown). This confirmed ubiquitous expression of the artificially assembled expression cassette at the ROSA26 locus. As predicted, mice heterozygous for GR and RG (GR/RG) do not have colored cells in the absence of Cre-mediated recombination. This was confirmed by examining >20 GR/RG mouse brains through serial sagittal sections without observing a single GFP or RFP-MYC labeled cell (Figure 3B) and by FACS analysis of dissociated cells from these mice (data not shown). When various Cre transgenes were separately introduced to create mice containing GR, RG, and Cre (GR/RG;Cre/+), we observed cells labeled with GFP, RFP-MYC,or both in patterns predicted by Cre expression (Table 1). For example, nestin-Cre generates MADM-labeled cells throughout the brain (Figure 3C), consistent with its expression in all neural precursors (Lendahl et al., 1990Lendahl U. Zimmerman L.B. McKay R.D. CNS stem cells express a new class of intermediate filament protein.Cell. 1990; 60: 585-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2685) Google Scholar). In contrast, labeled cells in GR/RG;Foxg1-Cre/+ mice are highly enriched in the forebrain and granule cells of the cerebellum but not in the brain stem (Figure 3D), consistent with the previously reported expression pattern of Foxg1-Cre (Hebert and McConnell, 2000Hebert J.M. McConnell S.K. Targeting of cre to the Foxg1 (BF-1) locus mediates loxP recombination in the telencephalon and other developing head structures.Dev. Biol. 2000; 222: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). We also observed a nasal to temporal gradient of labeled cells in the retina (Figure 3E) that followed the Foxg1-Cre expression pattern (Hebert and McConnell, 2000Hebert J.M. McConnell S.K.

Biol. 2000; 222: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Cre transgenes driven by promoters of ubiquitously expressed genes, such as hprt-Cre (Tang et al., 2002Tang S.H. Silva F.J. Tsark W.M. Mann J.R.

Martin G.R. Analysis of Fgf8 gene function in vertebrate development.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1997; 62: 159-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), permit cell labeling outside the nervous system (Table 1; Figure 4). For example, hprt-Cre allows the labeling of cells in the liver (Figure 4A), kidney (Figure 4B), heart (Figure 4C), spleen (Figure 4D), and all other tissues examined (data not shown). Actin-Cre generates labeled cells in the epidermis (Figure 4E) as well as in the brain (see below), while keratin5-Cre (K5-Cre), which is expressed only in keratinocyte precursors (Brakebusch et al., 2000Brakebusch C.

One distinctive feature of MADM is the ability to distinguish between different recombination/segregation types using the double-marker system (Figure 1). We found that GFP can be visualized by fluorescence in live or fixed samples, whereas RFP fluorescence cannot. Since RFP was tagged with C-terminal MYC, anti-MYC immunofluorescence allowed simultaneous visualization of both markers in neurons, glia, and other nonneural tissues in fixed samples during development and in the adult (Figures 3F–H and 4; data not shown). Double-labeled cells (e.g., yellow cells in Figures 3F, 3H, and 4Aa–4Dc) are readily distinguishable from single-green and single-red cells, allowing for the distinction of G2-X events from those of G0, G1, or G2-Z events. In many cases, particularly in nonneural tissues where cell migration is limited, single-green and single-red cells form clusters adjacent to each other (“twin spots;” e.g., Figures 3G, 4Ac, 4Bc, 4Cc, 4Eb, and 4Fb), strongly suggesting that they are progeny of siblings derived from single G2-X events. We find that a given Cre line not only dictates the spatial pattern of the MADM recombination events but also the frequency and type of labeled cells (Table 1). For example, a much higher labeling efficiency is achieved with K5-Cre compared with actin-Cre in the epidermis (Figure 4E versus Figure 4F). Likewise, hprt-Cre generates many more MADM-labeled cells than actin-Cre in the brain and elsewhere (Table 1). The efficiency of G2-X events (single-labeled cells) relative to other events (double-labeled cells) also varied according to the Cre lines used. As expected, lines of mice where Cre is transiently expressed in dividing cells have a higher frequency of G2-X events, as in the case of nestin-Cre or K5-Cre (Figure 3, Figure 4). For ubiquitous Cre lines, the proportion of double-colored cells increases with age, as would be predicted if postmitotic recombination happened throughout a cell’s life. To test the relationship between labeling frequency and Cre dose and to confirm postmitotic recombination, we devised a quantitative assay that evaluates the frequency of labeled cerebellar granule cells.

TrxRs are the only enzymes catalyzing the NADPH-dependent reduction of the active site disulfide in thioredoxins (Trxs), which play essential roles in substrate reductions, defense against oxidative stress, and redox regulation by thiol redox control. TrxRs have been found to be overexpressed by a number of human tumors. Curcumin, which is consumed daily by millions of people, is a polyphenol derived from the plant <i>Curcuma longa</i>. This phytochemical has well known anticancer and antiangiogenic properties. In this study we report that rat TrxR1 activity in Trx-dependent disulfide reduction was inhibited by curcumin. The IC<sub>50</sub> value for the enzyme was 3.6 μm after incubation at room temperature for 2 h <i>in vitro</i>. The inhibition occurred with enzyme only in the presence of NADPH and persisted after removal of curcumin. By using mass spectrometry and blotting analysis, we proved that this irreversible inhibition by curcumin was caused by alkylation of both residues in the catalytically active site (Cys<sup>496</sup>/Sec<sup>497</sup>) of the enzyme. However, the curcumin-modified enzyme showed a strongly induced NADPH oxidase activity to produce reactive oxygen species. Inhibition of TrxR by curcumin added to cultured HeLa cells was also observed with an IC<sub>50</sub> of around 15 μm. Modification of TrxR by curcumin provides a possible mechanistic explanation for its cancer preventive activity, shifting the enzyme from an antioxidant to a prooxidant."

We show that these fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals can be customized to concurrently image and differentiate tumor vessels from both the perivascular cells and the matrix. Moreover, we used them to measure the ability of particles of different sizes to access the tumor.

We report that Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation of human monocytes induces rapid differentiation into two distinct subsets: DC-SIGN+ CD16+ macrophages and CD1b+ DC-SIGN− dendritic cells. DC-SIGN+ phagocytic macrophages were expanded by TLR-mediated upregulation of interleukin (IL)-15 and IL-15 receptor. CD1b+ dendritic cells were expanded by TLR-mediated upregulation of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and its receptor, promoted T cell activation and secreted proinflammatory cytokines. Whereas DC-SIGN+ macrophages were detected in lesions and after TLR activation in all leprosy patients, CD1b+ dendritic cells were not detected in lesions or after TLR activation of peripheral monocytes in individuals with the progressive lepromatous form, except during reversal reactions in which bacilli were cleared by T helper type 1 (TH1) responses. In tuberculoid lepromatous lesions, DC-SIGN+ cells were positive for macrophage markers, but negative for dendritic cell markers. Thus, TLR-induced differentiation of monocytes into either macrophages or dendritic cells seems to crucially influence effective host defenses in human infectious disease."

These findings indicate that histone H3 K56 acetylation at the entry-exit gate enables recruitment of the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex and so regulates gene activity. Eukaryotic DNA is packaged in nucleosomal particles for assembly into higher-order structures in the nucleus. These particles contain four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), which form a protein octamer that is wrapped by almost two turns or 146 bp of DNA. However, the nucleosomal core particle is a dynamic structure that can participate in gene regulation and higher-order folding through specialized histone domains. Each histone contains a charged N-terminal region adjacent to a globular structured domain containing α-helical histone folds. As observed in the nucleosome core particle high-resolution X-ray structure, the histone N-terminal tails extend from the core of the nucleosome and pass between the gyres of the DNA superhelix where they may interact with adjacent nucleosomes (Luger et al., 1997aLuger K.

The N termini are also the targets of enzymes that add or remove acetyl, methyl, and phosphate groups that help modulate the function of the histone proteins. These posttranslational modifications and the N-terminal tails themselves have little effect on nucleosome stability (Luger et al., 1997aLuger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 Å resolution.Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6354) Google Scholar). However, the tails are required for higher orders of chromatin fiber folding in vitro that may affect access to transcription factors (Dorigo et al., 2003Dorigo B. Schalch T. Bystricky K. Richmond T.J. Chromatin fiber folding: requirement for the histone H4 N-terminal tail.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In addition, the histone N termini serve as binding sites for transcriptional regulators. For example, in yeast, both repressor proteins, such as Sir3, and transcriptional activators, such as the bromodomain-containing protein Bdf1, interact with the histone H4 N terminus. These interactions are regulated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs) (Carmen et al., 2002Carmen A.A. Milne L. Grunstein M.

In addition, repressor proteins such as HP1 and Polycomb in higher eukaryotes recognize the methylated H3 N termini (Bannister et al., 2001Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A.

These data argue that the histone N termini and their modifications may regulate gene activity not through regulating nucleosome stability or nucleosomal conformation but in regulating higher-order structures and by the direct recruitment of regulatory proteins (for review see Workman and Kingston, 1998Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Alteration of nucleosome structure as a mechanism of transcriptional regulation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). In the globular region of each histone, the central histone fold domains contain three α-helical regions separated by L1 and L2 loops (e.g., α1-L1-α2-L2- α3; Luger et al., 1997aLuger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 Å resolution.Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6354) Google Scholar). There are also helical extensions in H3 and H2B histones that are N- and C-terminal to the central histone folds, respectively. In contrast to the N termini, the histone-folds interact extensively with DNA. Of the 146 bp wrapped around the histone octamer in the X-ray crystal structure, 121 bp interact with the histone fold region. In addition, the α-helical histone-fold extension of H3 (H3 αN) selectively binds to the remaining 13 base pairs of DNA where the DNA superhelix enters and exits the nucleosome (Luger et al., 1997aLuger K.

Structure of the yeast nucleosome core particle reveals fundamental changes in internucleosome interactions.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5207-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thus, through their extensive interactions with DNA, the central histone folds and extensions, but not the histone tails, are important in stabilizing the nucleosome core particle (Luger et al., 1997bLuger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Flaus A.J. Waye M.M. Richmond T.J. Characterization of nucleosome core particles containing histone proteins made in bacteria.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Regulators that do affect nucleosome stability include nucleosome remodeling complexes such as SWI/SNF. Remodeling complexes use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to alter nucleosome structure and translational position on DNA (Peterson and Workman, 2000Peterson C.L. Workman J.L.

Kingston R.E. Alteration of nucleosome structure as a mechanism of transcriptional regulation.Annu. Rev.

An electron microscopy study indicates a loss of DNA content from nucleosomes remodeled by SWI/SNF (Bazett-Jones et al., 1999Bazett-Jones D.P. Cote J. Landel C.C. Peterson C.L. Workman J.L.

There is clearly interplay between nucleosome remodeling complexes and those mediating histone acetylation. Activators can recruit both types of complexes to promoters (Cosma et al., 1999Cosma M.P.

However, the temporal order of these activities can vary. In vitro, histone N-terminal acetylation stabilizes the binding of the SWI/SNF complex to nucleosome arrays (Hassan et al., 2001Hassan A.H.

SWI/SNF action at certain yeast promoters recruits HAT activity (Cosma et al., 1999Cosma M.P. Tanaka T. Nasmyth K.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1049-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In either case, it appears that acetylation of the histone tails does not strongly destabilize the nucleosome, but the action of SWI/SNF does. For acetylation to directly affect histone-DNA interactions of the DNA superhelix surrounding the histone octamer, it could potentially occur in the histone globular domain. However, while more than 25 acetylation and methylation sites have been discovered in regions outside of the N termini of calf histones, their functions are still unknown (Zhang et al., 2003Zhang L. Eugeni E.E. Parthun M.R. Freitas M.A. Identification of novel histone post-translational modifications by peptide mass fingerprinting.Chromosoma. 2003; 112: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). A genetic analysis using yeast could uncover such functions; however, all of the known acetylation sites in core histones of S. cerevisiae are located in the N-terminal tails. We now describe a site of acetylation (histone H3 K56) found in the globular domain of a yeast histone. This novel acetylation site is located in the αN extension of the H3 histone fold. We demonstrate that disruption of the putative HAT SPT10, but not of six other HATs examined, strongly decreases the S phase-specific acetylation of this site at histone genes and prevents recruitment of Snf5, an essential member of the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex (Geng et al., 2001Geng F. Cao Y. Laurent B.C. Essential roles of Snf5p in Snf-Swi chromatin remodeling in vivo.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and subsequent transcription. These data argue for the role of histone H3 K56 modification in regulating the entry-exit gate to nucleosome remodeling. To search for new modification sites, yeast core histones were purified from asynchronously growing cells and examined by mass spectrometry. We found that lysine 56 within the αN domain of histone H3 is acetylated (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online) at ∼28% of H3 molecules (data not shown). To further investigate the role of K56 acetylation in vivo, we first generated an antibody specific for this acetylation site using a synthetic K56 Ac peptide (Figure S2A; Experimental Procedures). Specificity of the anti-H3 K56 acetylation-site antibody (α-K56 Ac) was tested sequentially by ELISA, Western blot, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) against histone mutations as described earlier (Suka et al., 2001Suka N. Suka Y. Carmen A.A. Wu J. Grunstein M. Highly specific antibodies determine histone acetylation site usage in yeast heterochromatin and euchromatin.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 473-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, Turner and Fellows, 1989Turner B.M. Fellows G. Specific antibodies reveal ordered and cell-cycle-related use of histone-H4 acetylation sites in mammalian cells.Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In ELISA, only the peptide containing acetylated K56 strongly inhibits antibody binding to the K56 Ac-KLH conjugate coated to the microtiter plate (Figure S2B). In Western blots, α-K56 Ac strongly immunoreacts with histone H3 from wt strains, and those in which another H3 acetylation site has been mutated (H3 K14R) but showed no detectable reactivity toward H3 whose K56 residue had been mutated (K56G, K56R; Figure S2C). Finally, ChIP assays were performed using chromatin from wt and K56G mutant strains. As shown in Figure S2D, the K56G mutation strongly reduced the PCR amplification of the HTA2 coding region (normally 5.8-fold over background) to background levels. Together, these data demonstrate that antibody α-K56 Ac is highly specific for acetylated K56 in histone H3. The combination of ChIP and DNA microarrays has been widely used in genome-wide analyses to determine the locations of protein binding and histone modification (Kurdistani et al., 2002Kurdistani S.K.

To map H3 K56 acetylation throughout the genome, we isolated chromatin fragments immunoprecipitated (IP) with α-K56 Ac from formaldehyde-treated cells. Both the IP and input DNA were purified, amplified by PCR, and labeled with a fluorophore (Cy3 or Cy5). The labeled IP and input DNA were combined and hybridized to a DNA microarray containing ∼6700 intergenic regions (IGRs; prepared in house) or >6200 open reading frames (ORFs; University Health Networks, Toronto). Both IGRs and ORFs microarray experiments were repeated three times from independently prepared ChIP DNA samples, and the K56 acetylation data of 5625 ORFs and 5606 IGRs were available for further analysis (Table S1). We asked whether genes that are hyperacetylated at H3 K56 are significantly enriched in any of the known categories of biological function, fitness, protein complexes, etc. FunSpec (Functional Specifications at http://funspec.med.utoronto.ca), which contains a comprehensive database of these features, was used and identified all of the eight core histone genes to be among the top 123 hyperacetylated ORFs (>1.6-fold). Among the 123 genes, only the histone genes fell into a known functional category (the chromosome functional category, p = 1.72E-06) in the MIPS functional category database and the nucleosomal protein complex category (p = 1.79E-14) in the MIPS protein complex database. To determine whether K56 acetylation correlates with that of other known histone acetylation sites, we compared our data to that of Kurdistani et al., 2004Kurdistani S.K. Tavazoie S. Grunstein M. Mapping global histone acetylation patterns to gene expression.Cell. 2004; 117: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, who examined the genome-wide occurrence of acetylation at 11 sites of acetylation in all four core histones. We did not find there to be a strong correlation of K56 acetylation with any of other N-terminal sites of acetylation (data not shown). While many sites of histone H3 N-terminal acetylation showed correlations R > 0.8 in pairwise comparisons (Kurdistani et al., 2004Kurdistani S.K. Tavazoie S. Grunstein M. Mapping global histone acetylation patterns to gene expression.Cell. 2004; 117: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), the maximal correlation between K56 acetylation and other sites was R = 0.30 with H3 K18 (ORFs) and R = 0.19 with H3 K9 (IGRs). These data may be explained if a subset of active genes throughout the genome is affected strongly by K56 acetylation and if K56 acetylation is due to a distinct HAT at these genes. To search for the enzyme(s) responsible for K56 acetylation state, we used ChIP to examine the effects of mutations of the known HATs and HDACs at individual genes identified in the microarrays as being enriched for K56 acetylation. Of the HAT (ELP3, GCN5, SAS2, SAS3, ESA1, SPT10, NUT1) and HDAC (HDA1, HOS1, HOS2, HOS3, RPD3) disruption strains examined for acetylation changes at both the promoter and coding regions of histone genes, only one, containing a disruption of the putative HAT SPT10, was shown to be required for acetylation of H3 K56 (Figure S3). To analyze the extent of K56 acetylation along the various histone promoters and coding regions and the involvement of SPT10 in their acetylation, we examined both IGRs and coding regions at all histone genes. We corrected for nucleosome loss during gene activity (Boeger et al., 2003Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Nucleosomes unfold completely at a transcriptionally active promoter.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, Reinke and Horz, 2003Reinke H.

Verreault A. A Rad53 kinase-dependent surveillance mechanism that regulates histone protein levels in S. cerevisiae.Cell. 2003; 115: 537-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The acetylation data was then normalized to the level of histone H3 in both wt and mutant strains. We estimate that there is a 1.6- to 6.2-fold decreased K56 acetylation in the spt10Δ strain as compared to wt cells at all core histone genes (Figure 1). Therefore, given that Spt10 has previously been shown to bind to the promoters of histone genes (Hess et al., 2004Hess D. Liu B. Roan N.R. Sternglanz R. Winston F. Spt10-dependent transcriptional activation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires both the Spt10 acetyltransferase domain and Spt21.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and is required for histone gene expression, Spt10 is likely to be directly required for acetylation of H3 K56 at histone genes. In order to determine the extent to which Spt10 binds to histone gene ORFs as well as at promoters, we examined the binding of myc epitope-tagged Spt10 at the histone genes. We found that Spt10-myc binds stronger at promoters than coding regions at all histone genes with the most binding at the promoters of HTA1 and HTB1 genes (18 fold enrichment as normalized to negative control and input, Figure 2). Spt10-myc binds 2.2- to 2.6-fold better at coding regions of all histone genes than to adjacent nonhistone IGRs and ORFs. Therefore, while Spt10 is highly enriched at histone gene promoters, it also binds at a lower but significant level to adjacent histone ORFs. We then wished to determine the sites of acetylation in all core histones affected by the loss of Spt10 at the histone genes. Using highly specific antibodies against 12 individual sites of acetylation in all core histones (Suka et al., 2001Suka N. Suka Y. Carmen A.A. Wu J. Grunstein M. Highly specific antibodies determine histone acetylation site usage in yeast heterochromatin and euchromatin.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 473-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), we found that spt10Δ affects mainly H3 K9, K18, and K56 acetylation at the coding region of the HTA2 gene with the greatest effect occurring on K56 acetylation (∼5.2-fold; Figures 3A and S4). Similar findings were made at the intergenic region of HTA2 (data not shown). We did not detect comparable differences in the extent of acetylation at the other histone H3 sites (Figure 3A) nor at sites in H4 (Figure S4A), H2A, and H2B (Figure S4B) histones. Therefore, Spt10 is specific for H3 K56, K18, and K9 at histone genes. Spt10 shares a conserved acetyltransferase domain with other HATs, including Gcn5 (Neuwald and Landsman, 1997Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. GCN5-related histone N-acetyltransferases belong to a diverse superfamily that includes the yeast SPT10 protein.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). A mutant allele spt10-199 containing G199A and G201A changes within the HAT domain has virtually the same strong defect as an spt10Δ mutant in histone gene activation (Hess et al., 2004Hess D. Liu B. Roan N.R. Sternglanz R. Winston F. Spt10-dependent transcriptional activation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires both the Spt10 acetyltransferase domain and Spt21.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether spt10-199 also affects K56 acetylation at histone genes. We found that K56 acetylation was reduced between 2.7-fold (HHF2) and 3.8-fold (HHT1) in the spt10-199 mutant as compared to the wt strain (Figure 3B). The decrease of K56 acetylation in spt10-199 is almost as severe as in the spt10Δ strain harboring an empty vector. These data indicate that the Spt10 acetyltransferase domain is essential for K56 acetylation at histone genes. We then asked whether Spt10 regulates transcription of all histone genes. As previously reported, Spt10 is required for expression of a subset (HTA2, HTB2, HHF2, and modestly at HHT2) of histone genes (Hess et al., 2004Hess D. Liu B. Roan N.R. Sternglanz R. Winston F. Spt10-dependent transcriptional activation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires both the Spt10 acetyltransferase domain and Spt21.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, we show by quantitative RT-PCR that activity of all of the histone genes is dependent on SPT10. As compared to the wt strain, there is a decrease of between 6.7-fold (HTA2) and 2-fold (HTB1) in the histone mRNA levels in the spt10Δ strain (Figure 4A ). Similar decreases in histone gene transcription are seen in the spt10-199 allele (Figure 4B). Therefore, SPT10 and its catalytic domain are required for all histone gene activity. To determine whether the effect of SPT10 on transcription is mediated through K56, we then examined the effect of K56R on the expression of genomic H2A and H2B genes. As shown in Figure 4C, H3 K56R results in a 2.3- to 2.9-fold decrease in the expression of all four H2A and H2B genes as compared to the wt strain or as compared to H3 K18R (another site affected by spt10Δ) and H4 K12R (that is not affected by spt10Δ). Therefore, K56 in histone H3 is uniquely important for transcription of the histone genes examined. Previous studies demonstrated that an essential subunit of the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex, Snf5, is required for full expression of histone HTA1-HTB1 genes (Dimova et al., 1999Dimova D. Nackerdien Z. Furgeson S. Eguchi S. Osley M.A. A role for transcriptional repressors in targeting the yeast Swi/Snf complex.Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 75-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effects of snf5Δ deletion on other histone genes in this study. As shown in Figure 4D, snf5Δ significantly reduces the expression of all the histone genes from 1.9-fold (HTB1) to 2.6-fold (HTB2). These data indicate that Spt10 through its catalytic domain, H3 K56, and the SWI/SNF remodeling complex affect expression similarly at all histone genes examined. To determine the order by which Spt10, H3 K56 acetylation, and Snf5 function in regulating histone gene expression, we first examined when in the cell cycle these events occur. Histone HTA1 gene expression is strictly cell cycle regulated (Spellman et al., 1998Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Comprehensive identification of cell cycle-regulated genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by microarray hybridization.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3789) Google Scholar), and its expression peaks at about 75 min after shifting synchronized cdc15ts cells from the restrictive temperature of 37°C to the permissive temperature of 23°C (see Experimental Procedures and Figure 5A ). We find that H3 K56 acetylation is also cell cycle regulated and peaks 25 min earlier than the peak of histone HTA1 gene expression at both the promoter (data not shown) and coding region (Figure 5A) of the HTA1 gene. Interestingly, we find at the HTA1 coding region that K56, but neither H3 K18 (affected by SPT10) nor H4 K12 (unaffected by SPT10), is acetylated in a cell cycle-specific manner (Figure 5D). Similar findings were made at the HTA2 gene (Figures S5B and S5C). These data underscore the important role of K56 acetylation in gene regulation in S phase. In order to rule out the possibility that cycle-specific K56 acetylation is caused by heat shock of growing cells at the restrictive temperature of 37°C, we also examined the H3 K56 acetylation pattern at the HTA2 gene coding region using cells synchronized by α factor arrest in G1 (Spellman et al., 1998Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Ander"

Here, we report the existence of the cytosolic Ezh2-containing methyltransferase complex and tie the function of this complex to regulation of actin polymerization in various cell types. Genetic evidence supports the essential role of cytosolic Ezh2 in actin polymerization-dependent processes such as antigen receptor signaling in T cells and PDGF-induced dorsal circular ruffle formation in fibroblasts.

https://openalex.org/W1971957724,"Different classes of endosomes exhibit a characteristic intracellular steady-state distribution governed by interactions with the cytoskeleton. We found a kinesin-3, KIF16B, that transports early endosomes to the plus end of microtubules in a process regulated by the small GTPase Rab5 and its effector, the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase hVPS34. In vivo, KIF16B overexpression relocated early endosomes to the cell periphery and inhibited transport to the degradative pathway. Conversely, expression of dominant-negative mutants or ablation of KIF16B by RNAi caused the clustering of early endosomes to the perinuclear region, delayed receptor recycling to the plasma membrane, and accelerated degradation. These results suggest that KIF16B, by regulating the plus end motility of early endosomes, modulates the intracellular localization of early endosomes and the balance between receptor recycling and degradation. We propose that this mechanism could have important implications for signaling."

The results show how one family of receptors underlies odor coding in two markedly different olfactory systems; they also provide a molecular mechanism to explain longstanding observations of larval odor discrimination. The numerical simplicity of the larval olfactory system makes it a convenient model system for the study of sensory reception and processing. The system has also attracted great interest because insect larvae, which recognize their food sources through chemosensory cues, are a major source of global agricultural loss. However, despite the rapid progress made in the understanding of odor coding in adult Drosophila in recent years (Hallem and Carlson, 2004Hallem E.A. Carlson J. The odor coding system of Drosophila.Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 453-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), remarkably little is known about the molecular basis of olfaction in the larva. In particular, larval odor receptors have not been identified. The principal larval olfactory organ in D. melanogaster is the dorsal organ, a cuticular dome pierced by pore channels through which odorants can pass (Hertweck, 1931Hertweck H.

Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Underlying the dome are the dendrites of 21 neurons, bundled in seven groups of three. The neurons send axons to the larval antennal lobe (LAL), which consists of small glomeruli, the spheroidal modules that constitute the adult antennal lobe as well as the olfactory bulb of vertebrates (Heimbeck et al., 1999Heimbeck G.

Neurol. 2002; 445: 374-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The larval olfactory system is sensitive to a wide diversity of odorants (Aceves-Pina and Quinn, 1979Aceves-Pina E.O. Quinn W.G. Learning in normal and mutant Drosophila larvae.Science. 1979; 206: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, Rodrigues, 1980Rodrigues V.

Characterization of the larval olfactory response in Drosophila and its genetic basis.Behav.

Among a large number of odorants tested in D. melanogaster, 87% were found to induce a response of some kind (Cobb, 1999Cobb M. What and how do maggots smell?.Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1999; 74: 425-459Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, behavioral analysis has provided evidence that larvae are capable of odor discrimination (Aceves-Pina and Quinn, 1979Aceves-Pina E.O. Quinn W.G. Learning in normal and mutant Drosophila larvae.Science. 1979; 206: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, Rodrigues, 1980Rodrigues V. Olfactory Behavior of Drosophila melanogaster. Plenum, New York1980Google Scholar). Thus, despite the numerical simplicity of the system, the 21 ORNs of the larval olfactory system support diverse olfactory-mediated behaviors. Furthermore, the larval system operates primarily in the presence of high odorant concentrations: the larva hatches from an egg laid directly in a food source and generally remains immersed in the food source for most of the larval stage. The striking capabilities of this system, its cellular economy, and its operation in the midst of exceptionally high odor concentrations invite investigation into the molecular mechanisms by which it encodes odorants. In order to understand the molecular basis of odor coding in the larva, it is necessary to identify larval odor receptors and then to characterize their responses to odorants. Odor coding in the adult depends on the activation of seven-transmembrane domain receptors encoded by a family of 60 Or genes (Clyne et al., 1999Clyne P.J. Warr C.G. Freeman M.R. Lessing D. Kim J.H.

Subsets of Or genes have been shown to be expressed in the two principal adult olfactory organs, the antenna and the maxillary palp, but no Or genes were found to be expressed in the larva in a sensitive in situ hybridization analysis (Vosshall et al., 2000Vosshall L.

Targeted mutation of a Drosophila odor receptor defines receptor requirement in a novel class of sensillum.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9906-9912PubMed Google Scholar). A deletion mutation of an adult odor receptor gene, Or22a, produces a loss of odorant response in a particular functional class of ORN, ab3A, in the adult antenna (Dobritsa et al., 2003Dobritsa A.A.

Integrating the molecular and cellular basis of odor coding in the Drosophila antenna.Neuron. 2003; : 827-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The Or22a mutant provides an in vivo expression system that has been used to characterize other odor receptors of the Drosophila antenna (Hallem et al., 2004bHallem E.A. Ho M. Carlson J.R. The molecular basis of odor coding in the Drosophila antenna.Cell. 2004; 117: 965-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) and maxillary palp (Goldman et al., 2005Goldman A.L., Van der Goes van Naters W. Lessing D. Warr C.G. Carlson J.R. Coexpression of two functional odor receptors in one neuron.Neuron. 2005; 45: 661-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and even of another species, the mosquito Anopheles gambiae (Hallem et al., 2004aHallem E.A. Fox A.N. Zwiebel L.J. Carlson J.R. Mosquito receptor for human-sweat odorant.Nature. 2004; 427: 212-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Specifically, expression of another odorant receptor in the mutant, “empty” neuron is driven by an Or22a promoter via the GAL4/UAS system. Such expression of receptors confers odor responses upon the mutant neuron, responses that can be measured physiologically in single-unit recordings. In most cases, the responses conferred by an individual receptor match in great detail the odor responses of one of the ORN classes previously defined in electrophysiological studies (de Bruyne et al., 1999de Bruyne M. Clyne P.J. Carlson J.R. Odor coding in a model olfactory organ: the Drosophila maxillary palp.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4520-4532PubMed Google Scholar, de Bruyne et al., 2001de Bruyne M. Foster K. Carlson J.R. Odor coding in the Drosophila antenna.Neuron. 2001; 30: 537-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Thus, the empty neuron system has provided a means of characterizing the response properties of many odor receptors. Here we identify a subset of Or genes as larval odor receptor genes, and we characterize physiologically the response properties of the receptors they encode. We provide evidence that the expression of individual Or genes is restricted to only one of the 21 larval ORNs in each dorsal organ. We define the odor response spectra of the receptors by physiological analysis in the empty neuron system. Some receptors respond only to a small fraction of tested odors, whereas others are broadly tuned. Larval receptors exhibit different response modes and different termination kinetics, including a slow-onset response that to our knowledge has not previously been described in Drosophila. We provide a spatial map of the projections of ORNs expressing receptors of different specificities. We find that ORNs with related specificities map to targets that are related in spatial position. The results of this analysis provide a molecular explanation for how sensitivity and discrimination can be achieved, using members of the same receptor family, in an olfactory system that differs dramatically from that of the adult fly. The data support a simple but unprecedented model of functional organization in which a single odor receptor transmits signals via a single neuron to a single glomerulus in the brain. As a first step in identifying larval odor receptors, we tested the possibility of Or gene expression in larval ORNs with two approaches: RT-PCR amplification from larval RNA and Or promoter-GAL4 analysis. We initially carried out RT-PCR analysis with primers representing all 60 Or genes, using larval RNA from a Canton-S strain as template. In addition to Or83b, a gene that is broadly expressed among ORNs and that is functionally distinct from other Or genes (Larsson et al., 2004Larsson M.C. Domingos A.I. Jones W.D. Chiappe M.E.

We constructed Or-GAL4 drivers for all but one of the Or genes that appear to be larval specific (Or30a, Or45b, Or49a, Or59a, Or63a, Or74a, Or85c, Or94a, and Or94b) and for Or67b, which is also expressed in the antenna; we also analyzed an available Or42a-GAL4 driver (Goldman et al., 2005Goldman A.L., Van der Goes van Naters W.

Coexpression of two functional odor receptors in one neuron.Neuron. 2005; 45: 661-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), which shows expression in the maxillary palp. Expression in larval ORNs was clearly observed for 10 of the 11 Or-GAL4 drivers (Figure 1). Or94b-GAL4 drove GFP reporter expression in a single symmetric pair of larval ORNs, one in each dorsal organ (Figure 1C). Likewise, expression of Or59a-GAL4, Or67b-GAL4, and Or45b-GAL4 was detected in exactly one ORN of each dorsal organ. Or85c-GAL4 consistently drove reporter gene expression in at least one neuron of the dorsal organ, and in some cases additional neurons were observed in either the dorsal organ or terminal organ, a neighboring organ implicated in taste (Stocker, 1994Stocker R.

Guerin P.M. Vlimant M. Neurophysiological and behavioral evidence for an olfactory function for the dorsal organ and a gustatory one for the terminal organ in Drosophila melanogaster larvae.J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Or30a-GAL4, Or49a-GAL4, Or42a-GAL4, and Or63a-GAL4 drove expression in a single ORN of each dorsal organ and a single neuron of the terminal organ. In the case of Or30a-GAL4 and Or49a-GAL4, the neuron of the terminal organ was faint, and Or30a-GAL4, Or49a-GAL4, and Or63a-GAL4 also showed labeling of some additional cells. Or74a-GAL4 was expressed in a single ORN of each dorsal organ in addition to an unidentified structure adjacent to the terminal organ. The Or94a-GAL4 construct did not drive expression in either larval or adult chemosensory organs, which could indicate either that the Or gene is not expressed in the larval olfactory system or that the reporter construct lacks regulatory sequences necessary for faithful expression, as has been found for a number of constructs made from adult Or genes (Goldman et al., 2005Goldman A.L., Van der Goes van Naters W.

Ray and J.R.C., unpublished data), or that expression depends on epigenetic factors. In summary, ten of the Or-GAL4 drivers showed expression in larval ORNs. These results confirm that some Or genes are expressed in larval ORNs, including some genes that are also expressed in either the adult antenna or the maxillary palp. We next investigated the projections of the larval ORNs in the LAL of the brain. We found that each Or-GAL4 driver labeled a small, discrete subregion of the antennal lobe (Figure 2A ). For example, Or94b-GAL4, which labels one ORN in each dorsal organ, labels a single subregion in the lateral portion of the lobe. Or59a-GAL4, which also labels a single ORN in each dorsal organ, also shows labeling in a subregion of the LAL, but the label is more anterior than that of Or94b-GAL4. Or67b-GAL4, Or45b-GAL4, Or85c-GAL, and Or74a-GAL4 label distinct regions of the LAL. Or30a-GAL4, Or49a-GAL4, Or42a-GAL, and Or63a-GAL4 also label subregions of the LAL, but their staining patterns are somewhat more complex, which is likely due to additional expression in neurons of the terminal organ and their targets in the suboesophageal ganglion. We then investigated the distribution of Or gene expression among ORNs. Are each of these different Or genes expressed in different ORNs, or, at the other extreme, are all of these Or genes coexpressed in a single ORN? We constructed fly strains containing pairs of Or-GAL4 drivers and asked whether the patterns of reporter gene expression were additive. For example, the Or94b-GAL4 and Or59a-GAL4 constructs each drive expression in a single ORN of each dorsal organ when tested singly, but when tested together in the same animal, two ORNs are labeled (Figure 2B), indicating that they are expressed in different ORNs. In all, we tested 21 pairs of drivers—all pairwise combinations of seven Or-GAL4 drivers—and found additivity in all cases. In the case of three pairs (Or42a and Or59a; Or67b and Or85c; and Or74a and Or94b), the two ORNs were more difficult to resolve than in the other cases and appear to reside in the same bundle of three ORNs. These results indicate that Or-GAL4 expression is distributed among different ORNs and support a model in which each ORN expresses only one or a small number of Or genes. To determine whether the projections of different ORN classes in the LAL are distinct, we examined the strains containing combinations of the seven Or-GAL4 drivers. We found that in all 21 pairwise combinations, the patterns were additive (Figure 2B). These results indicate that different ORNs project to different glomeruli. Hence, we have found no evidence for convergence of larval ORNs. As an initial means of addressing odor coding in the larva, we recorded extracellular physiological responses from the dorsal organ. We found that a wide variety of odors elicited increased firing frequencies (Figure 3), consistent with a previous report (Oppliger et al., 2000Oppliger F.Y. Guerin P.M. Vlimant M. Neurophysiological and behavioral evidence for an olfactory function for the dorsal organ and a gustatory one for the terminal organ in Drosophila melanogaster larvae.J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We also observed differences in the dynamics of the responses. For example, the response to acetophenone was initiated shortly after the onset of the odor stimulus. By contrast, the response to methyl eugenol showed a slower onset. We were unable to assign action potentials to individual ORNs on the basis of amplitude in these recordings because of the large number of ORNs, 21, in the dorsal organ. Therefore, in order to analyze the basis of odor coding at high resolution, we have used an expression system, as described below. We have provided evidence above that a subset of Or genes is expressed in larval ORNs. To test directly whether these genes encode functional odor receptors, we have used an in vivo expression system, the empty neuron system (Dobritsa et al., 2003Dobritsa A.A.

This approach was successful for the characterization of the antennal repertoire of odor receptors (Hallem et al., 2004bHallem E.A. Ho M. Carlson J.R.

Fox A.N. Zwiebel L.J. Carlson J.R. Mosquito receptor for human-sweat odorant.Nature. 2004; 427: 212-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We generated UAS-Or constructs for 12 of the candidate larval odor receptors, including all 10 whose expression in larval ORNs was confirmed by Or-GAL4 analysis, and functionally tested them in the empty neuron system. We tested a panel of 27 olfactory stimuli that represent a wide variety of chemical classes, including acetate esters, alcohols, aldehydes, aromatics, ketones, an organic acid, and CO2. The panel includes all of the odors used in recent physiological studies of the antenna and maxillary palp (Hallem et al., 2004bHallem E.A. Ho M. Carlson J.R.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6599-6609PubMed Google Scholar). We found that 11 of the 12 receptors conferred odor responses to the mutant ab3A neuron (Figure 4). Only one tested gene, Or63a, did not confer an odor response, either when expressed as a cDNA or as a genomic construct. The odor response spectrum is different for each functionally expressed receptor. These results indicate that these genes do in fact encode functional odor receptors. The odor response spectra of these receptors vary greatly. If we define a strong response as ≥100 spikes/s (Hallem et al., 2004bHallem E.A. Ho M. Carlson J.R. The molecular basis of odor coding in the Drosophila antenna.Cell. 2004; 117: 965-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), then Or94b responds strongly to a single odorant, 4-methylphenol, among 27 tested stimuli. By contrast, Or42a and Or85c each responds strongly to nine odorants. Only one receptor, Or49a, gave no strong responses to any of the 27 stimuli or to several natural odor mixtures, suggesting that it may be narrowly tuned to an untested odorant of particular biological significance, such as a pheromone. Most of these receptors respond strongly to multiple odorants, and among the odorants that elicit any strong responses, most elicit strong responses from multiple receptors (Figure 5). We note that a number of receptors, such as Or42a, Or74a, and Or85c, which we term class 1 receptors, respond most strongly to linear aliphatic compounds, including acetate esters, alcohols, and ketones, whereas others, such as Or30a, Or45b, Or59a, Or94a, and Or94b, termed class 2 receptors, seem tuned to aromatic compounds containing a benzene ring. Or67b is distinct in that it responds strongly to compounds of both categories. Our physiological analysis revealed both excitatory and inhibitory responses among larval odor receptors. Most of the responses we observed were excitatory, but an example of an inhibitory response is shown in Figure 6A . The traces are from an ab3 sensillum, which contains two paired ORNs, ab3A and ab3B. In this strain, the ab3A ORN expresses Or67b, instead of the endogenous receptor, via the GAL4/UAS system and is referred to as the Δab3A: Or67b neuron. Physiological recordings from this sensillum show the activity of both the Δab3A: Or67b neuron, which produces the large action potentials in the trace, and the neighboring neuron, ab3B, which produces the small action potentials (Dobritsa et al., 2003Dobritsa A.A.

Integrating the molecular and cellular basis of odor coding in the Drosophila antenna.Neuron. 2003; : 827-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The frequency of the large action potentials decreases markedly below the spontaneous rate of firing following stimulation with 2-methylphenol, indicating that the Δab3A: Or67b neuron is inhibited by this odorant. (The ab3B neuron is weakly excited by 2-methylphenol, as shown by the modest increase in the frequency of small spikes.) The inhibition of Δab3A: Or67b by 2-methylphenol is strong: the spontaneous firing frequency is 12 ± 2 spikes/s (SEM; n = 12), and the frequency decreases by 9 ± 2 spikes/s (n = 12) following odor stimulation (Figure 6B). While Δab3A: Or67b is strongly inhibited by 2-methylphenol, it is strongly excited by acetophenone (Figures 6A and 6B), indicating that a single larval odor receptor can be excited by one odorant and inhibited by another, structurally related odorant. One larval receptor, Or59a, responds strongly to both anisole and methyl eugenol; the two odorants elicited comparable numbers of action potentials in the 0.5 s period following odorant stimulation (Figure 4). However, the dynamics of the two responses were markedly different in two respects (Figure 6C). Anisole elicited a response with fast"

https://openalex.org/W2006691081,"Translational control is a key genetic regulatory mechanism implicated in regulation of cell and organismal growth and early embryonic development. Initiation at the mRNA 5' cap structure recognition step is frequently targeted by translational control mechanisms. In the Drosophila embryo, cap-dependent translation of the uniformly distributed caudal (cad) mRNA is inhibited in the anterior by Bicoid (Bcd) to create an asymmetric distribution of Cad protein. Here, we show that d4EHP, an eIF4E-related cap binding protein, specifically interacts with Bcd to suppress cad translation. Translational inhibition depends on the Bcd binding region (BBR) present in the cad 3' untranslated region. Thus, simultaneous interactions of d4EHP with the cap structure and of Bcd with BBR renders cad mRNA translationally inactive. This example of cap-dependent translational control that is not mediated by canonical eIF4E defines a new paradigm for translational inhibition involving tethering of the mRNA 5' and 3' ends."

The structures also redefine SWI2/SNF2 functional motifs and uncover unexpected structural correlation of mutations in Cockayne and X-linked mental retardation syndromes. Many chromosome-associated cellular activities require accessible DNA. For instance, eukaryotic DNA is hierarchically packaged into nucleosomes and higher order chromatin, a structure that interferes with replication, transcription, DNA repair, and recombination (Wu and Grunstein, 2000Wu J. Grunstein M. 25 years after the nucleosome model: chromatin modifications.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Likewise, stalled transcription machineries or other persistent protein:DNA complexes can interfere with gene expression and genome maintenance in both pro- and eukaryotes (Svejstrup, 2002Svejstrup J.Q.

To deal with these events and to facilitate or regulate gene expression and genome maintenance, cells possess activities that can remodel chromatin or disrupt other DNA:protein complexes using ATP hydrolysis. Probably the best-studied example of these activities is the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling in eukaryotes, which is carried out by large multiprotein complexes that change the position or histone variant composition of nucleosomes (Korber and Horz, 2004Korber P.

Cell. 1999; 3: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These remodeling factors are quite diverse in their overall composition, but all of them contain a principal motor subunit that belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 type of ATPases (Becker and Horz, 2002Becker P.B.

SWI2/SNF2 ATPases are not only implicated in nucleosome remodeling but in fact are versatile engines that are implicated in many different remodeling-like processes. For instance, Mot1 displaces TATA box binding protein (TBP) from promoters (Gumbs et al., 2003Gumbs O.H. Campbell A.M. Weil P.A.

SWI2/SNF2 ATPases exhibit a diverse domain organization that probably reflects different substrate specificities and functional roles. However, all SWI2/SNF2 enzymes share a conserved catalytic ATPase domain, indicating that the principal ATP-driven event on DNA is conserved among diverse family members. The conserved ATPase domain contains sequence motifs related to DExx box helicases (Caruthers and McKay, 2002Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Helicase structure and mechanism.Curr. Opin. Struct.

Helicases use ATP hydrolysis to unwind double-stranded nucleic acids by duplex destabilizing and ATP-dependent translocation on the product single strand. In contrast to helicases, SWI2/SNF2 enzymes lack DNA unwinding activity but use ATP to translocate on duplex DNA, generate superhelical torsion into DNA, or wrap DNA (Beerens et al., 2004Beerens N.

Chromatin remodeling by ATP-dependent molecular machines.Bioessays. 2003; 25: 1192-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To help reveal the poorly understood structural mechanism of the SWI2/SNF2 ATPase domain in remodeling processes, we determined crystal structures of the catalytic domain of the Sulfolobus solfataricus Rad54 homolog (SsoRad54cd) both in the absence of and bound to a DNA substrate. SsoRad54 has been identified by sequence homology to eukaryotic Rad54 (Seitz et al., 2001Seitz E.M. Haseltine C.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. DNA recombination and repair in the archaea.Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2001; 50: 101-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We show that SsoRad54cd, like its eukaryotic sequence homolog, is a dsDNA- but not ssDNA-stimulated ATPase. Furthermore, SsoRad54cd can translocate on dsDNA and can introduce superhelical torsion into DNA using ATP hydrolysis. The structural results suggest that SWI2/SNF2 ATPases travel along both minor groove backbone strands without strand separation activity, a feature that can explain the lack of helicase activity by these enzymes. The proposed screw motion of DNA along the SWI2/SNF2 ATPase domain could provide the translational and rotational force to disrupt DNA:protein complexes in remodeling processes. To our knowledge, we provide a first structural framework for any sequence and structure unspecific dsDNA translocase in complex with its dsDNA substrate. Multidomain or multisubunit SWI2/SNF2 enzymes have been suggested to remodel DNA:protein complexes by translocating on DNA or introducing superhelical torsion at DNA:protein interfaces using ATP hydrolysis (Beerens et al., 2004Beerens N.

SsoRad54cd (residues 430–906) comprises the ATPase domain that is conserved among SWI2/SNF2 family members. SsoRad54cd has dsDNA- but not ssDNA-activated ATPase activity (Figure 1A ) and lacks detectable helicase activity (data not shown). In addition, SsoRad54cd can displace a triplex-forming oligonucleotide from dsDNA (Figure 1B) and can extrude cruciforms at palindromic DNA by using ATP hydrolysis (Figure 1C). These two activities have been interpreted as translocation or generation of negative superhelical torsion, respectively (Firman and Szczelkun, 2000Firman K. Szczelkun M.D. Measuring motion on DNA by the type I restriction endonuclease EcoR124I using triplex displacement.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2094-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, Havas et al., 2000Havas K. Flaus A. Phelan M. Kingston R. Wade P.A. Lilley D.M. Owen-Hughes T. Generation of superhelical torsion by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities.Cell. 2000; 103: 1133-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In these assays, the overall activity of SsoRad54cd corresponds well to that observed for eukaryotic Rad54 (Jaskelioff et al., 2003Jaskelioff M. Van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Rad54p is a chromatin remodeling enzyme required for heteroduplex DNA joint formation with chromatin.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The activity of SsoRad54cd might be further stimulated at the physiological growth temperature of Sulfolobus solfataricus (80°C, inaccessible in our assays). Since translocation or generation of superhelical torsion are two proposed driving forces for remodeling processes, the structure of SsoRad54cd could help to reveal the conserved core mechanism of SWI2/SNF2 family enzymes in remodeling processes. To reveal the structural basis for the ATPase core of SWI2/SNF2 enzymes, we crystallized SsoRad54cd and determined the atomic structure by a two-wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment to 3.0 Å resolution, using mercury as anomalous scatterers (Table 1). The experimental electron density allowed tracing of most of the polypeptide chain except for some portions at the C terminus (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). We therefore crystallized the C-terminal half of SsoRad54cd separately (residues 630–906) and obtained a structure to 2.0 Å resolution, starting from a molecular replacement solution with the partial model of the C-terminal domain of SsoRad54cd. Using the high-resolution structure of the C-terminal domain, we could completely trace and refine the structure of SsoRad54cd. The final model was refined at 3.0 Å resolution, yielding an R factor of 24.2% (Rfree 29.6%) with good stereochemistry.Table 1Crystallographic Data Collection and Refinement StatisticsData CollectionSsoRad54cdaSsoRad54cd crystal cell contants (P41212) (Å): a = 84.1, b = 84.1, c = 227.2; α = 90°, β = 90°, γ = 90°.SsoRad54cd:dsDNAbSsoRad54cd:DNA crystal cell constants (P21) (Å): a = 86.9, b = 83.7, c = 106.4; α = 90°, β = 109.8°, γ = 90° and two molecules per asymmetric unit.Domain 2cDomain 2 crystal cell constants (C2) (Å): a = 111.8, b = 61.1, c =75.0; α = 90°, β = 99.3°, γ = 90° and two molecules per asymmetric unit.Data setpeakinflectionnativenativeX-ray sourceID14-4 (ESRF)ID14-4 (ESRF)PX (SLS)PX (SLS)DerivativeHgHg––Wavelength (Å)1.00651.00900.97801.0000Data range (Å)20–3.020–3.020–3.020–2.0Observations (unique)137929 (30251)128376 (28997)113578 (52560)102837 (36943)I/σ15.56 (3.18)18.6 (3.05)6.59 (1.93)14.6 (2.7)Completeness (%) (last shell)97.7d (92.7dAnomalous completeness.)97.7d (92.3dAnomalous completeness.)93.1 (72.1)95.6 (75.3)RsymeRsym is the unweighted R value on I between symmetry mates.0.06 (0.39)0.06 (0.46)0.12 (0.44)0.042 (0.277)RefinementSsoRad54cdSsoRad54cd:dsDNAdomain 2Data range (Å)20–3.020–3.020–2.0Reflections F > 0 (crossvalidation)16322 (802)28481 (1401)32479 (1634)Nonhydrogen atoms (nucleotides/solvent)3873 (−)9198 (78 nucleotides)3917 (260 water molecules)RworkfRwork = ∑hkl∣∣Fobs(hkl)∣ − ∣Fcalc(hkl)∣∣/∑hkl│Fobs(hkl)∣for reflections in the working data set.(RfreegRfree = the crossvalidation R factor for 5% of reflections against which the model was not refined.)0.242 (0.296)0.233 (0.281)0.219 (0.260)RMS bond length (Å) (bond angles)0.008 (1.7)0.011 (1.6)0.013 (1.7)a SsoRad54cd crystal cell contants (P41212) (Å): a = 84.1, b = 84.1, c = 227.2; α = 90°, β = 90°, γ = 90°.b SsoRad54cd:DNA crystal cell constants (P21) (Å): a = 86.9, b = 83.7, c = 106.4; α = 90°, β = 109.8°, γ = 90° and two molecules per asymmetric unit.c Domain 2 crystal cell constants (C2) (Å): a = 111.8, b = 61.1, c =75.0; α = 90°, β = 99.3°, γ = 90° and two molecules per asymmetric unit.d Anomalous completeness.e Rsym is the unweighted R value on I between symmetry mates.f Rwork = ∑hkl∣∣Fobs(hkl)∣ − ∣Fcalc(hkl)∣∣/∑hkl│Fobs(hkl)∣for reflections in the working data set.g Rfree = the crossvalidation R factor for 5% of reflections against which the model was not refined. Open table in a new tab SWI2/SNF2 enzymes bind duplex DNA in a predominantly sequence- and structure-independent manner. This property provides a formidable obstacle for crystallization of a specific DNA:protein complex. Using a 25-mer dsDNA with two single nucleotide overhangs, a central GC-rich sequence and terminal AT runs, we were able to obtain crystals of the DNA:SsoRad54cd complex that diffracted to 3.0 Å resolution. The complex of SsoRad54cd with a 25-mer DNA duplex was solved by molecular replacement, using individual domains of the DNA-free structures as search models. The DNA complex was refined at 3.0 Å resolution, resulting in an R factor of 23.3% (Rfree 28.1%) and good stereochemistry. The final model comprises the conserved SWI2/SNF2 type catalytic domain of SsoRad54 (residues 432–906) and 19 base pairs DNA duplex for each of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. SsoRad54cd consists of two domains (domains 1 and 2) that together form a particle of 70 Å × 70 Å × 40 Å dimension (Figure 2A ). Domains 1 and 2 each contain a “RecA” type α/β subdomain (denoted 1A and 2A, respectively) with a central β sheet, flanked by α helices. The seven classical sequence motifs that are implicated in ATP hydrolysis and/or DNA binding of helicases are located in loop regions of subdomains 1A (motifs I, Ia, II, III) and 2A (motifs IV, V, VI) (Figure 2). The core RecA-like architecture of SsoRad54cd is related to that found in helicase structures (Singleton et al., 2001Singleton M.R. Scaife S. Wigley D.B. Structural analysis of DNA replication fork reversal by RecG.Cell. 2001; 107: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, Subramanya et al., 1996Subramanya H.S. Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B. Crystal structure of a DExx box DNA helicase.Nature. 1996; 384: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), suggesting that SWI2/SNF2 enzymes and DExx box helicases share the basic ATP hydrolysis mechanism (Figure S2). Subdomains 1B and 2B are structurally not closely related to equivalent regions of previously determined helicase structures and probably help to translate ATP-driven conformational changes between 1A and 2A, for instance, into DNA translocation. Subdomain 1B extends the sheet of domain 1 by contributing a seventh β strand and a helix-loop-helix cap. Subdomain 2B is a six-membered helix bundle structure that is situated on the tip of sheet 2. It consists of a helical protrusion, originating from the central sheet of domain 2 that packs against a helical bundle, formed by the C terminus of SsoRad54. A deep cleft separates domains 1 and 2 (Figure 2A). Motifs I (Walker A), II (DExx), and III on domain 1 of SsoRad54cd form the primary ATP binding site in the active site cleft. Motifs IV–VI on domain 2 are not situated in the active site cleft, as observed for many other helicases, but positioned on the outside of SsoRad54cd. This unique location is due to an ∼180° flip of domain 2, compared to the orientation of equivalent structural regions in crystal structures of ATP bound DExx box helicases (Caruthers and McKay, 2002Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Helicase structure and mechanism.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). We observe a virtually identical domain orientation in both DNA bound and DNA-free crystal forms (Figure S3). Both crystal forms have, in general, very different buffer conditions and crystal packing environments, with the exception of a minor shared crystal contact. Furthermore, a mutation (V850G) in a residue near the crystallographically observed domain 1:2 interface interferes with ATPase activity of SsoRad54cd (see below). These observations argue that the unique orientation of domain 2 is unlikely to be a result of crystal packing. It could perhaps reflect an “open” conformation during translocation or DNA uptake. In any case, the location of motifs IV–VI suggests that domain 2 may adopt a different orientation in the presence of nucleotides. In fact, a substantial ADP-driven conformational change has recently been identified in the Isw2 complex (Fitzgerald et al., 2004Fitzgerald D.J. DeLuca C. Berger I. Gaillard H. Sigrist R. Schimmele K. Richmond T.J. Reaction cycle of the yeast Isw2 chromatin remodeling complex.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3836-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The DNA duplex binds alongside the entrance of the active site cleft in a position where ATP-driven changes between domain 1 and 2 could be directly linked to translocase activity (Figure 2A). Thirty-nine out of 50 nucleotides of the DNA duplex are visible in the electron density (Figure 3A ). The visible nucleotides include the DNA along the entire length of the protein, plus one end of the DNA duplex that is stabilized by crystal lattice contacts. We could unambiguously trace the DNA sequence using this crystal contact. The six terminal base pairs at the other duplex end, which is not stabilized by protein or crystal lattice contacts, are not visible in the electron density, presumably due to increased mobility. The DNA duplex is bound predominantly to subdomain 1A by recognition of the two phosphate chains along the minor groove (Figures 3B and 3C). Both strands of the visible DNA duplex are fully base paired to each other, and the conformation of the structurally defined base pairs is most similar to B-DNA, although the enzyme induces a slight widening of the minor groove at the contact region. The 3′–5′ strand, named according to the putative direction of translocation of SsoRad54cd on DNA (see below, [Kim et al., 1998Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A.

Crystal structures of complexes of PcrA DNA helicase with a DNA substrate indicate an inchworm mechanism.Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar]), is bound by the loop between β2 and αC (motif Ia) and the loop between β3 and αD (denoted motif Ib). The 5′–3′ strand is bound by a loop-helix motif consisting of the loop between motif II and αF (denoted motif IIa), and the N terminus of αF. Finally, αE (denoted motif Ic) binds into the minor groove via R547. R547 is highly conserved among SWI2/SNF2 enzymes. Its long side chain could be a flexible anchor for dsDNA yet allow DNA sliding during translocation (Figure 2, Figure 3). Domain 2 binds the DNA phosphate backbone via R728 and K781. The interaction of domain 2 with DNA appears much weaker and less conserved than the interaction of domain 1 with DNA. This could indicate that domain 2 does not have a tight DNA binding site by itself. To test this idea, we analyzed binding constants of SsoRad54cd and of separately expressed and purified domain 1 and domain 2 (Figure 3D). SsoRad54cd strongly prefers dsDNA (Kd = 0.10 ± 0.02 μM) over ssDNA (Kd = 11 ± 5 μM), consistent with the dsDNA- but not ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity. Domain 1 by itself (SsoRad54 430–658) has an only moderately reduced DNA binding activity (Kd = 0.22 ± 0.10 μM) compared to SsoRad54cd. Domain 2 by itself (SsoRad54 659–906), however, does not show detectable DNA binding activity for either dsDNA or ssDNA (Figure 3D). We also do not find evidence for a preferred binding of secondary structures, in particular a four-way junction substrate (Kd = 0.27 ± 0.10 μM) and a Y substrate (Kd = 1.0 ± 0.1 μM). Like eukaryotic Rad54 (Petukhova et al., 1999Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. Yeast Rad54 promotes Rad51-dependent homologous DNA pairing via ATP hydrolysis-driven change in DNA double helix conformation.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the DNA binding affinity of SsoRad54cd is not significantly affected by ATP or nonhydrolysable ATP analogs (data not shown), although we find a moderate increase in DNA binding affinity by using a DExx → DQxx mutant enzyme in the presence of ATP (Figure S4). This mutant has been shown in several cases to induce a stable ATP-trapped state better than nonhydrolysable ATP analogs (Hirano and Hirano, 2004Hirano M. Hirano T. Positive and negative regulation of SMC-DNA interactions by ATP and accessory proteins.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2664-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, Lammens et al., 2004Lammens A. Schele A.

Biol. 2004; 14: 1778-1782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, the relatively weak effect of ATP on DNA indicates that DNA recognition of the SsoRad54cd is not substantially influenced by ATP. The observed binding mode of DNA to SsoRad54cd is consistent with in vitro data of eukaryotic SWI2/SNF2 enzymes and remodeling factors. In particular, the structure suggests that remodeling factors require a minimal handle of at least 12–15 base pairs adjacent to the remodeled substrate in order to allow the ATPase domain to grab DNA. This requirement is estimated from the distance between the edge of SsoRad54cd and the full dsDNA binding site but may be larger if the ATPase domain and the remodeled substrate are further apart. The estimated 12–15 bp correspond well to experimental values of a minimal 17 bp dsDNA handle required for Mot1 to remove TBP from the TATA box (Darst et al., 2001Darst R.P. Wang D. Auble D.T. MOT1-catalyzed TBP-DNA disruption: uncoupling DNA conformational change and role of upstream DNA.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2028-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and the minimal 20 bp extranucleosomal DNA required by ISW2 (Zofall et al., 2004Zofall M. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Functional role of extranucleosomal DNA and the entry site of the nucleosome in chromatin remodeling by ISW2.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10047-10057Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of SsoRad54cd, like other SWI2/SNF2 enzymes, is stimulated by dsDNA (Figure 1A). Comparison of the structure of the SsoRad54cd:DNA complex with the structure of DNA-free SsoRad54cd reveals a potential mechanism for this feature. In the absence of DNA, the ATP-hydrolyzing DExx motif (motif II) is in an unusual β conformation, which is not compatible with a functional active site of Walker box ATPases (Figure 3E). In the presence of DNA, however, the DExx motif switches into the typical active α conformation (Subramanya et al., 1996Subramanya H.S. Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B.

https://openalex.org/W2102866130,"We have explored the manner in which the population of retinal ganglion cells collectively represent the visual world. Ganglion cells in the salamander were recorded simultaneously with a multielectrode array during stimulation with both artificial and natural visual stimuli, and the mutual information that single cells and pairs of cells conveyed about the stimulus was estimated. We found significant redundancy between cells spaced as far as 500 mum apart. When we used standard methods for defining functional types, only ON-type and OFF-type cells emerged as truly independent information channels. Although the average redundancy between nearby cell pairs was moderate, each ganglion cell shared information with many neighbors, so that visual information was represented approximately 10-fold within the ganglion cell population. This high degree of retinal redundancy suggests that design principles beyond coding efficiency may be important at the population level."

Clinical severity and neuronal apoptosis in brainstem motor areas were substantially reduced upon brain-specific blockade of TRAIL after induction of EAE through adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic T cells. Furthermore, TRAIL-deficient myelin-specific lymphocytes showed reduced encephalitogenicity when transferred to wild-type mice. Conversely, intracerebral delivery of TRAIL to animals with EAE increased clinical deficits, while naive mice were not susceptible to TRAIL. Using organotypic slice cultures as a model for living brain tissue, we found that neurons were susceptible to TRAIL-mediated injury induced by encephalitogenic T cells. Thus, in addition to its known immunoregulatory effects, the death ligand TRAIL contributes to neural damage in the inflamed brain."

The first class of BMP ligands includes the 92% homologous BMP2 and BMP4, considered prototype BMPs in that they possess greater affinity for type I than type II receptors (19ten Dijke P.

The second class of BMP ligands we studied consists of the closely related BMP5, BMP6, BMP7, and BMP8, which are ∼60% homologous to BMP2 or BMP4 and share with activin ligands a greater affinity for their corresponding type II receptors (15Yamashita H. ten Dijke P.

To define the contribution of BMPR2 to signaling by these two classes of BMP ligands, we tested the effect of ablating Bmpr2 in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC). The Bmpr2 gene was disrupted in PASMC isolated from genetically modified mice possessing Bmpr2 alleles with internal loxP sites, using an adenovirus specifying Cre recombinase. In a complimentary approach, BMPR2 expression was inhibited with high efficiency by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes. Remarkably, the loss of BMPR2 did not uniformly reduce BMP signal transduction but instead increased the activation of SMAD and p38 by BMP6 and BMP7. In BMPR2-deficient cells, BMP signals were transduced by receptor complexes consisting of the ActRIIa receptor and a set of type I co-receptors distinct from those utilized by BMPR2, resulting in the gain of signaling for certain BMP ligands. Mice with Genetically Modified BMPR2 Alleles—Mice heterozygous for a Bmpr2 mutant allele (Bmpr2+/–) were generated as previously described (33Beppu H. Kawabata M. Hamamoto T. Chytil A. Minowa O. Noda T. Miyazono K. Dev. Biol. 2000; 221: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 34Beppu H. Ichinose F. Kawai N. Jones R.C. Yu P.B. Zapol W.M. Miyazono K. Li E. Bloch K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: L1241-L1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and backcrossed for 10 generations to inbred C57BL/6 (wild-type) mice. The generation of mice with a conditionally disrupted Bmpr2 allele was described by Beppu et al. (35Beppu H. Lei H. Bloch K.D. Li E. Genesis. 2005; 41: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, a construct containing exons 4 and 5 (which encode the transmembrane and a portion of the kinase domain) of the Bmpr2 gene flanked by two loxP sites and a neomycin selection cassette (pgk-neo) with a third loxP site was used to target Bmpr2 in embryonic stem cells. Mice homozygous for the conditional knock-out allele (Bmpr2flox/flox) on a hybrid C57BL/6 and Sv129 background were viable and appeared normal. Isolation of Pulmonary Artery Smooth Muscle Cells—Explants of murine pulmonary arteries were cultured as described previously (36Takata M. Filippov G. Liu H. Ichinose F. Janssens S. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L272-L278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to yield PASMCs whose phenotype was confirmed by immunohisto-chemical staining for α-smooth muscle actin. Three separate isolates of PASMCs were obtained, each derived from an individual Bmpr2flox/flox mouse. PASMCs were also isolated from wild-type and Bmpr2+/– mice. Disruption of the BMPR2 Gene in PASMC—To disrupt the Bmpr2 gene, PASMCs isolated from Bmpr2flox/flox mice were infected with an adenovirus specifying Cre recombinase (Ad.Cre) or an adenovirus specifying green fluorescent protein (Ad.GFP) as a control, each at a multiplicity of infection of 150. Cultured cells were allowed to recover for 7 days after infection and then passaged twice to ensure depletion of BMPR2 protein. Measurement of BMPR2 Protein Expression—Proteins were extracted from PASMC in SDS-lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. BMPR2 was detected using a monoclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal domain (BD Biosciences). Bound antibody was detected with an horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody directed against mouse IgG and was visualized using chemiluminescence with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of Gene Expression—Total RNA was extracted from PASMCs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized by the reverse transcriptase reaction. Gene sequences were amplified from cDNA by PCR and quantitated using an ABI Prism 7000 (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) with the following primers. To detect Bmpr2 cDNA, the forward primer 5′-GAAACGATAATCATTGTTTGGC-3′ corresponding to a sequence in exon 4 and reverse primer 5′-CCCTGTTTCCGGTCTCCTGT-3′ corresponding to a sequence in exon 5 were used. To detect Alk2, Alk3, Alk6, ActRIIa, ActRIIb, Id1, Smad6, Smad7, and 18 S ribosomal cDNA sequences, TaqMan primer sets supplied by Applied Biosystems were used. Changes in the relative gene expression normalized to 18 S rRNA levels were determined using the relative CT method (37Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (5040) Google Scholar, 38Gibson U.E. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). Measurement of SMAD1/5/8 and p38 Phosphorylation—After serum starvation in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) for 24 h, PASMCs were incubated with BMPs 2, 4, 6, or 7 (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Cultured cell lysates (15 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with antibodies specific for phosphorylated (p-) SMAD1/5/8 and p-p38 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA). Replicate immunoblots were probed with antibodies directed to total SMAD1 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Waltham, MA) and p38 (Cell Signaling). Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies specific for rabbit Ig. Bound complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL Plus) and quantitated using a Storm imager reading blue fluorescence (Amersham Biosciences). All chemifluorescence measurements obtained were within the dynamic range of the Storm imager. Measurement of BMP-induced Id1 Gene Transcription—Subconfluent cells in 12-well tissue culture plates were transfected using Fu-GENE6 (Roche Applied Science) with 0.5 μg of a plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under the control of the Id1 gene promoter (kindly provided by Dr. Peter ten Dijke, Netherlands Cancer Institute) and 0.1 μg of plasmid encoding the Renilla luciferase gene under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) as a control for transfection efficiency. After 24 h, medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and cells were incubated for 12 h. Cells were then incubated with BMP ligands for 12 h and harvested. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity was measured using a dual luciferase reagent system (Promega), and relative Id1 transcription was reflected by the firefly luciferase activity divided by the Renilla luciferase activity. siRNA Targeting Constructs and Transfection—siRNA duplexes in annealed and purified form were obtained from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). Sense sequences of duplexes used for gene targeting were (5′ to 3′): for Alk2, GGUCAACCAGAAACUUUACtt; Alk3, GGGCAGAAUCUAGAUAGUAtt; Alk6, GGGUCAGAUUUUCAAUGUCtt; Bmpr2, GGGAGCACGUGUUAUGGUCtt; ActRIIa, GGAGUGUCUUUUCUUUAAUtt; and ActRIIb, GGCUCAGCUCAUGAACGACtt. siRNA duplexes were added at 120 nm to subconfluent PASMCs in 12-well plates in a mixture of Oligofectamine and OptiMEM culture medium (Invitrogen) in the absence of serum or antibiotics. After incubation for 6 h, fetal calf serum was added to cultures at a final concentration of 10%. Assays to measure target mRNA levels were performed 48 h after transfection. Assays to measure BMP-mediated SMAD1/5/8 activation were performed after an additional 12 h of serum starvation. Disruption of the BMPR2 Gene in PASMCs—PASMCs isolated from Bmpr2flox/flox mice were infected with Ad.Cre to excise the genomic fragment containing exons 4 and 5 of the Bmpr2 gene, yielding Bmpr2del/del cells. Cre-mediated recombination was confirmed first by PCR analysis of genomic DNA using primers specific for sequences in introns 3 and 5, which yielded a product consistent with excision of exons 4 and 5 (35Beppu H. Lei H. Bloch K.D. Li E. Genesis. 2005; 41: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Second, RNA extracted from Bmpr2del/del cells was amplified by RT-PCR with primers specific for sequences in exons 3 and 8, and the product was sequenced to reveal direct splicing of exon 3 to exon 6, with stop codons in exon 6 resulting from a frame-shift (35Beppu H. Lei H. Bloch K.D. Li E. Genesis. 2005; 41: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Third, quantitative RT-PCR performed on RNA from each isolate of Bmpr2del/del cells using primers specific for exons 4 and 5 demonstrated levels of wild-type Bmpr2 mRNA that were 0.5 to 2% of that found in Bmpr2flox/flox cells infected with Ad.GFP (Fig. 1A). In comparison, PASMC from Bmpr2 heterozygote (Bmpr2+/–) mice expressed Bmpr2 mRNA at levels half of those found in wild-type (Fig. 1B). Bmpr2del/del cells did not express detectable wild-type BMPR2 protein, in contrast to Bmpr2flox/flox cells infected with Ad.GFP (Fig. 1C). SMAD1/5/8 Activation Is Attenuated in BMPR2+/– PASMCs—We previously observed that the ability of Bmpr2+/– cells to activate SMAD1/5/8 in response to BMP2 was diminished compared with wild-type cells (34Beppu H. Ichinose F. Kawai N. Jones R.C. Yu P.B. Zapol W.M. Miyazono K. Li E. Bloch K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: L1241-L1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To determine whether SMAD signaling in Bmpr2+/– cells was diminished in response to other BMP ligands, cells were stimulated with BMPs 4, 6, or 7 for 30 min. For each of these BMP ligands, the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 was decreased in Bmpr2+/– cells to levels 40–60% of that observed in wild-type cells (results for BMP7 shown in Fig. 2, A and B). SMAD1/5/8 Activation Is Altered in BMPR2-deficient PASMCs—SMAD1/5/8 activation was measured in Bmpr2del/del cells to determine whether the ablation of Bmpr2 would further attenuate BMP signaling in comparison to the reduction in signaling observed in Bmpr2+/– cells. Bmpr2del/del cells retained the ability to phosphorylate SMAD1/5/8 in response to BMP4, at levels that were 30–50% of those in Bmpr2flox/flox cells (Fig. 2, C and D). In response to BMP7, however, Bmpr2del/del cells phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 at levels 4–5-fold greater than in Bmpr2flox/flox cells. The signaling mediated by other BMP ligands was tested to determine whether the signaling changes observed in BMPR2-deficient cells could be generalized to structurally similar BMPs. Bmpr2del/del cells exhibited attenuated SMAD1/5/8 activation in response to both BMP2 and BMP4 compared with Bmpr2flox/flox cells (Fig. 2E). Bmpr2del/del cells exhibited increased SMAD1/5/8 activation in response to both BMP6 and BMP7 compared with Bmpr2flox/flox cells. The increased ability of Bmpr2del/del cells to activate SMAD1/5/8 was more marked for BMP7 than for BMP6. These changes in the sensitivity to different BMP ligands were consistently observed in Ad.Cre-infected PASMC isolated from three individual Bmpr2flox/flox mice. p38 MAP Kinase Activation Is Altered in BMPR2-deficient PASMC—It has been previously reported that BMPs activate p38 MAP kinase in several cell types independently of SMAD activation (9Iwasaki S. Iguchi M. Watanabe K. Hoshino R. Tsujimoto M. Kohno M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26503-26510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 10Hall A.K. Miller R.H. J. Neurosci.

To determine whether the BMP signaling changes observed in Bmpr2del/del cells might be reflected in the activation of effectors other than SMADs, the BMP-induced phosphorylation of p38 was examined in Bmpr2flox/flox and Bmpr2del/del PASMCs (Fig. 2E). In Bmpr2flox/flox cells, stimulation with all BMP ligands induced the activation of p38 by 60 min, which was delayed compared with the activation of SMAD1/5/8. The activation of p38 by BMP2 and BMP4 was decreased in Bmpr2del/del cells compared with Bmpr2flox/flox cells, concordant with decreases in SMAD1/5/8 activation for those ligands. The activation of p38 by BMP6 and BMP7 was increased in Bmpr2del/del cells compared with Bmpr2flox/flox cells, also concordant with increases in SMAD1/5/8 activation for those ligands. BMP-induced Id1 Gene Transcription in BMPR2-deficient Cells—The BMP-induced transcription of Id family genes is a primary means by which BMP ligands achieve effects in target cells (2Hollnagel A.

To determine whether alterations in the ability of BMPR2-deficient cells to activate SMAD1/5/8 were reflected in the ability to transcribe BMP-responsive genes, Id1 gene transcriptional activity was measured using a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the BMP-responsive Id1 gene promoter (Fig. 3, left panel). At baseline, Bmpr2flox/flox and Bmpr2del/del PASMCs had equivalent Id1 transcriptional activity. After stimulation with BMP4, Bmpr2flox/flox cells induced Id1 promoter activity >20-fold. BMP4 also induced Id1 promoter activity in Bmpr2del/del cells but 70% less than that observed in Bmpr2flox/flox cells. After stimulation with BMP7, Bmpr2flox/flox cells had only modest induction of Id1 promoter activity, whereas Bmpr2del/del cells had 5-fold greater induction of Id1 promoter activity in response to this ligand than did Bmpr2flox/flox cells. Consistent with the promoter assay, quantitative RT-PCR measurements revealed that incubation with BMP7 for 1 h increased Id1 mRNA levels to a greater extent in Bmpr2del/del PASMC than in Bmpr2flox/flox cells (Fig. 3, right panel). These findings suggest that the ability of Bmpr2flox/flox and Bmpr2del/del cells to activate SMAD1/5/8 correlated closely with the transcriptional activity of a key BMP-responsive gene. BMPR2 Gene Disruption Does Not Alter the Expression of Other BMP Receptors or Inhibitory SMADs—ActRIIa, ActRIIb, Alk2, and Alk3 receptor sequences were readily detected by quantitative RT-PCR of mRNA from each of the PASMC isolates examined (≤26 cycles of PCR amplification from 200 ng of RNA). The expression levels of ActRIIa, ActRIIb, Alk2, and Alk3 receptors were not altered in Bmpr2del/del cells as compared with Bmpr2flox/flox (shown) or wild-type (data not shown) cells (Fig. 1A). Very little Alk6 cDNA was detected in the PASMC isolates tested (requiring >35 cycles of amplification), consistent with previous reports of low levels of Alk6 mRNA in normal human PASMCs (39Takeda M. Otsuka F. Nakamura K. Inagaki K. Suzuki J. Miura D. Fujio H. Matsubara H. Date H. Ohe T. Makino H. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 4344-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When measured by quantitative RT-PCR, the expression levels of the inhibitory SMADs, Smad6 and Smad7, were not significantly different in Bmpr2del/del and Bmpr2flox/flox cells (data not shown). Inhibition of BMPR2 Expression by Specific siRNA Attenuates BMP4 and Enhances BMP7 Responses—BMPR2 expression was inhibited by transfecting wild-type PASMCs with a gene-specific siRNA duplex for 48 h. This siRNA reduced BMPR2 protein expression by >90% in wild-type PASMCs, whereas transfection with siRNAs specific for Alk6 did not alter BMPR2 protein levels (Fig. 4). Treatment with siRNAs did not affect the expression of total SMAD1 protein. Treatment with siRNA specific for Alk6 did not alter the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 induced by BMP4 or BMP7, consistent with low levels of Alk6 expression observed in PASMCs. Treatment with siRNA specific for Bmpr2 attenuated the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 induced by BMP4 while increasing that induced by BMP7. Changes in BMP signaling resulting from the efficient RNA interference-mediated inhibition of BMPR2 expression in wild-type PASMCs were thus consistent with the ligand-specific changes in BMP signaling observed in Bmpr2del/del cells. Receptors That Transduce BMP Signals in the Presence or Absence of BMPR2—To identify the type II receptors responsible for BMP signaling in Bmpr2flox/flox and Bmpr2del/del PASMC, siRNA-mediated inhibition of receptor expression was employed. 48 h after transfecting cells with siRNAs specific for the type II receptors ActRIIa or ActRIIb, the expression of the target gene relative to 18 S ribosomal RNA expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 5A). siRNAs specific for either ActRIIa or ActRIIb inhibited their expression (70 and 45%, respectively) in a specific manner with minimal effect on the expression of the homologous receptor. After pretreatment with siRNAs, cells were exposed to BMP ligands for 30 min and the activation of SMAD1/5/8 was assessed (Fig. 5, B–D). The inhibition of ActRIIa or ActRIIb expression in Bmpr2flox/flox cells did not affect the activation of SMAD1/5/8 induced by BMP4 or BMP7 (Fig. 5, B and C). In contrast, the inhibition of ActRIIa in Bmpr2del/del cells impaired the activation of SMAD1/5/8 by BMP4 or BMP7 (Fig. 5, B and D). The inhibition of ActRIIb had no effect under these conditions. These results suggest that BMPR2 is the principal type II receptor transducing BMP signals when it is expressed and that ActRIIa is the principal type II receptor transducing BMP signals when BMPR2 is not expressed. To identify the type I receptors that transduce BMP signals in Bmpr2flox/flox and Bmpr2del/del PASMCs, siRNA specific for Alk2, Alk3, and Alk6 were used. siRNAs for Alk2 and Alk3 inhibited the expression of these type I receptors (60 and 75%, respectively) in a specific manner with minimal effects on the expression of other type I receptors (Fig. 6A). In Bmpr2flox/flox cells, BMP4-mediated SMAD1/5/8 signaling was i"

Cell samples were collected by apheresis following pre-conditioning by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and isolated by anti-CD34 positive immunoselection. Polarographic analysis of the CN-sensitive endogenous cell respiration revealed a low mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate. Differential absorbance spectrometry on whole cell lysate and two-dimensional blue native-PAGE analysis of mitoplast proteins confirmed a low amount of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes thus qualifying the hematopoietic stem cell as a poor oxidative phosphorylating cell type. Confocal microscopy imaging showed, however, that the intracellular content of mitochondria was not homogeneously distributed in the CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cell sample displaying a clear inverse correlation of their density with the expression of the CD34 commitment marker. About half of the endogenous oxygen consumption was extra-mitochondrial and completely inhibitable by enzymatic scavengers of reactive oxygen species and by diphenylene iodinium. By spectral analysis, flow cytometry, reverse transcriptase-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and immunoprecipitation it was shown that the extra-mitochondrial oxygen consumption was contributed by the NOX2 and NOX4 isoforms of the <mml:math><mml:mrow>O<mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo>·</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math>. producer plasma membrane NAD(P)H oxidase with low constitutive activity.

https://openalex.org/W2025296977,"Calcium arising through release from intracellular stores and from influx across the plasma membrane is essential for signalling by specific guidance cues and by factors that inhibit axon regeneration. The mediators of calcium influx in these cases are largely unknown. Transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs) belong to a superfamily of Ca2+-permeable, receptor-operated channels that have important roles in sensing and responding to changes in the local environment. Here we report that XTRPC1, a Xenopus homolog of mammalian TRPC1, is required for proper growth cone turning responses of Xenopus spinal neurons to microscopic gradients of netrin-1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and myelin-associated glycoprotein, but not to semaphorin 3A. Furthermore, XTRPC1 is required for midline guidance of axons of commissural interneurons in the developing Xenopus spinal cord. Thus, members of the TRPC family may serve as a key mediator for the Ca2+ influx that regulates axon guidance during development and inhibits axon regeneration in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2048658013,"The transbilayer diffusion of unlabeled ceramides with different acylchains (C6-Cer, C10-Cer, and C16-Cer) wasinvestigated in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and in human erythrocytes.Incorporation of a very small percentage of ceramides (∼0.1% of totallipids) to the external leaflet of egg phosphatidylcholine GUVs suffices totrigger a shape change from prolate to pear shape vesicle. By observing thereversibility of this shape change the transmembrane diffusion of lipids wasinferred. We found a half-time for unlabeled ceramide flip-flop below 1 min at37 °C. The rapid diffusion of ceramides in a phosphatidylcholine bilayerwas confirmed by flip-flop experiments with a spin-labeled ceramide analogueincorporated into large unilamellar vesicles. Shape change experiments werealso carried out with human erythrocytes to determine the trans-membranediffusion of unlabeled ceramides into a biological membrane. Addition ofexogenous ceramides to the external leaflet of human erythrocytes did nottrigger echinocyte formation immediately as one would anticipate from anasymmetrical accumulation of new amphiphiles in the outer leaflet but onlyafter ∼15 min of incubation at 20 °C in the presence of an excess ofceramide. We interpret these data as being indicative of a rapid ceramideequilibration between both erythrocyte leaflets as indicated also by electronspin resonance spectroscopy with a spin-labeled ceramide. The late appearanceof echinocytes could reveal a progressive trapping of a fraction of theceramide molecules in the outer erythrocytes leaflet. Thus, we cannot excludethe trapping of ceramides into plasma membrane domains. The transbilayer diffusion of unlabeled ceramides with different acylchains (C6-Cer, C10-Cer, and C16-Cer) wasinvestigated in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and in human erythrocytes.Incorporation of a very small percentage of ceramides (∼0.1% of totallipids) to the external leaflet of egg phosphatidylcholine GUVs suffices totrigger a shape change from prolate to pear shape vesicle. By observing thereversibility of this shape change the transmembrane diffusion of lipids wasinferred. We found a half-time for unlabeled ceramide flip-flop below 1 min at37 °C. The rapid diffusion of ceramides in a phosphatidylcholine bilayerwas confirmed by flip-flop experiments with a spin-labeled ceramide analogueincorporated into large unilamellar vesicles. Shape change experiments werealso carried out with human erythrocytes to determine the trans-membranediffusion of unlabeled ceramides into a biological membrane. Addition ofexogenous ceramides to the external leaflet of human erythrocytes did nottrigger echinocyte formation immediately as one would anticipate from anasymmetrical accumulation of new amphiphiles in the outer leaflet but onlyafter ∼15 min of incubation at 20 °C in the presence of an excess ofceramide. We interpret these data as being indicative of a rapid ceramideequilibration between both erythrocyte leaflets as indicated also by electronspin resonance spectroscopy with a spin-labeled ceramide. The late appearanceof echinocytes could reveal a progressive trapping of a fraction of theceramide molecules in the outer erythrocytes leaflet. Thus, we cannot excludethe trapping of ceramides into plasma membrane domains. Ceramide is the backbone and an intermediate molecule in the metabolism ofsphingolipids. It is a minor lipid component of the plasma membrane ofeukaryotic cells and can be generated in vivo by the degradation ofsphingomyelin or of gangliosides. Free ceramide was shown to play a role assecond messenger for many cellular functions. Its potent biological activityhas been extensively reviewed(1Mathias S. Pena L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar,2Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Because enzymes involved inceramide generation and metabolism are localized in different subcellularcompartments, a challenging question remains unanswered: how do suchwater-insoluble molecules overcome the successive solubility barriers foundduring traffic between the membranes of different organelles? In addition, thetransmembrane orientation of ceramides must be controlled at each step.Ceramide is synthesized on the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulumand is converted to galactosylceramide in the luminal leaflet of theendoplasmic reticulum. It is not known if this reorientation within themembrane takes place spontaneously or is catalyzed by a protein. The Golgisystem also requires regulated ceramide distribution between leaflets assynthesis of glucosylceramide occurs on the cytosolic side and sphingomyelin(SM) 1The abbreviations used are: C6-Cer, C6-ceramide;C10-Cer, C10-ceramide; C16-Cer,C16-ceramide; C6-PC, C6-phosphatidylcholine;C6-PS, C6-phosphatidylserine; EPC, eggphosphatidylcholine; ESR, electron spin resonance; GUV, giant unilamellarvesicle; LUV, large unilamellar vesicle; Lyso-PC, lysophosphatidylcholine;NBD-PC,1-acyl-2-[6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)aminocaproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine;RTPE, Red Texas phosphatidylethanolamine; SL-Cer, spin-label ceramide; SL-PC,spin-label phosphatidylcholine; SM, sphingomyelin. on luminal side(3Van Meer G. Lisman Q. J.Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25855-25858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The transverse diffusionof several sphingolipid derivatives has been measured with spin-labeled andfluorescent analogues in LUVs and in different biological membranes(erythrocytes, hepatocytes, and Golgi). SM with a nitroxide on a short acylchain has almost no capacity to flip in the plasma membrane of erythrocytesand diffuses very slowly in Golgi membranes from rat liver. Galactosylceramideand glucosylceramide experience a slow flip rate in LUVs with a half-time ofseveral hours (4Buton X. Hervé P. Janek K. Tannert A. Burger K.N.J. Fellmann P. Muller P. Herrmann A.

There areconflicting reports in the literature concerning spontaneous flip-flop ofnatural ceramide. For Blitterswijk et al.(5van Blitterswijk W.J. van der Luit A. Veldman R.J. Verheij M. Borst J. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) “natural ceramide maybe restricted for quite some time on the side of the bilayer where it isgenerated.” On the contrary, for van Helvoort and van Meer(6van Helvoort A. van Meer G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 18-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), “ceramide flips inseconds.” Bai and Pagano(7Bai J. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8840-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) have measured thetransmembrane diffusion of a ceramide analogue possessing a fluorescent BODIPYgroup on a short acyl chain in1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine-LUVs. A half-time ofdiffusion of ∼22 min at 22 °C was reported for this molecule. Theirresult suggests that the spontaneous diffusion of ceramide is much faster thanthat of lipids with a zwitterionic head group like SM or PC. It is importantto measure the transverse diffusion of unlabeled long-chain ceramides todetermine the extent of the label influence on the flip-flop rates previouslymeasured. Because it has been suggested that ceramide interacts with SM toform segregated domains (8Holopainen J.M. Subramanian M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17562-17570Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), itis also important to measure the transverse diffusion in an SM-containingmembrane to establish if the presence of domains affects the transmembranediffusion of ceramides. Goñi's group reported recently that the insitu formation of ceramides by the action of sphingomyelinase on LUVs orerythrocyte ghosts accelerates the transmembrane diffusion of other lipidssuch as1-acyl-2-[6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)aminocaproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine.The authors attributed the latter phenomenon to the formation of non-lamellarlipid phases (9Contreras F.X. Villar A.V. Alonso A. Kolesnick R.N. Goñi F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37169-37174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the present article, we first measured ceramide transverse diffusion inlipid vesicles that did not contain proteins. An originality of our approachis that we can measure flip-flop rates in a single GUV without having to labelthe lipids. To this end, a small amount of non-labeled ceramides wasincorporated into the outer leaflet of EPC GUVs and the transmembranediffusion of ceramides was measured by monitoring the GUV shape changes, whichcan be triggered by a very small excess of lipid in one monolayer(10Berndl K. Käs J. Lipowsky R. Sackmann E. Seifert U. Europhys. Lett. 1990; 13: 659-664Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 11Farge E. Devaux P.F. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 347-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 12Farge E. Devaux P.F. J.Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 2958-2961Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The half-time of ceramide flip-flop in EPC GUVs was found to be 2 min at 20°C and about 30 s at 37 °C, hence about one order of magnitude belowthe value reported by Bai and Pagano(7Bai J. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8840-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Independent experimentswere carried out with spin-labeled analogues of ceramide or ofphosphatidylcholine incorporated into LUVs that confirmed the rapidtransmembrane diffusion of ceramides in EPC and the slow diffusion of the PCanalogue. To investigate ceramide flip-flop in a biological membrane, which containssphingomyelin and cholesterol, we carried out series of experiments with humanerythrocytes to which small amounts of unlabeled ceramides were added.Following the strategy employed successfully several years ago for theinvestigation of phospholipid translocation in human erythrocytes(13Seigneuret M. Devaux P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3751-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar,14Daleke D.L. Huestis W.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5406-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), shape change oferythrocytes was used to detect the transmembrane diffusion of unlabeledceramides. These experiments as well as ESR experiments with spin-labeledceramides suggested a rapid ceramide transmembrane diffusion in erythrocytes,excluding at least a complete trapping of such molecules in immobilizeddomains of the outer monolayer. Chemicals—Egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) was purifiedaccording to a previous study(15Singleton W.S. Gray M.S. Brown M.L. White J.L. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1965; 42: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Brain sphingomyelin(SM), cholesterol, and NBD-PC were purchased from Avanti-Polar Lipids. RedTexas phosphatidylethanolamine was acquired from Molecular Probes. Lyso-PC wasobtained by hydrolysis of EPC with phospholipase A2.C6-PS and C6-PC were synthesized as described before(16Fellmann P. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 27: 161-175PubMed Google Scholar). Sucrose, glucose, fattyacid free bovine serum albumin, and all other chemicals were purchased fromSigma-Aldrich. Dimethyldichlorosilane solution was bought from BDH(England). Synthesis of Sphingosine—Sphingosine used for the synthesisof ceramides was the reduction product of a selectively protected precursor.The sphingosine precursor,(2S,3R,4E)-2-azido-4-octadecen-1,3-diol, wasobtained according to the method described before(17Zimmermann P. Schmidt R.R. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1988; : 663-667Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). d-Galactosewas used as starting material and as a source of chiral center. Carbons 4 and5 from d-galactose gave proper asymmetries, respectively, forcarbons 2 and 3 of sphingosine precursors. The objective of the synthesis wasto obtain only one isomer with the good olefin geometry (4E), which was madepossible by a Wittig reaction performed in the presence of lithium bromide andphenyllithium between n-tetradecyltriphenylphosphonium and analdehyde intermediate obtained from d-galactose. Synthesis of Paramagnetic Fatty Acid—4-Doxylpentanoic acidwas obtained in three steps according to a method described previously(16Fellmann P. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 27: 161-175PubMed Google Scholar). The first step was thecondensation of an amino-alcohol (2-amino-2-methylpropan-1-ol) on thebutyllevulinate followed by an oxidation of the obtained oxazolidine. Thesaponification of the paramagnetic ester yielded the expected paramagneticacid. Synthesis of Ceramides—Unlabeled ceramides(C6-Cer, C10-Cer, and C16-Cer) and thespin-labeled ceramide, SL-Cer (Fig.1A), were obtained by grafting a fatty acid,respectively, n-caproic acid, n-capric acid, palmitic acid,and 4-doxylpentanoic acid, on the amine function of a synthetic sphingosine inthe presence of N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihyroquinoline inethanol according to a method described before(18Belleau B. Malek G. J. Am.Chem. Soc. 1968; 90: 1641-1652Google Scholar). Ceramide Purification andCharacterization—C6-Cer, C10-Cer,C16-Cer, and SL-Cer were purified on a silica gel column with agradient elution (chloroform:methanol: 100:0; 99:1; 98:2; 97:3; and 95:5)yielding, respectively, 65, 70, 87, and 80% of the pure expected product.Unlabeled ceramide (C6-Cer, C10-Cer, andC16-Cer) were characterized by NMR (1H and13C) analysis in deuteriated chloroform and by TLC on silica plate(chloroform:methanol:water, 80:20:2, 7) giving, respectively, rf =0.74, rf = 0.76, and rf = 0.75. The spin-labeled ceramidewas characterized by ESR spectroscopy in absolute ethanol and by TLC on asilica plate (chloroform:methanol:water, 80:20:2, 7) giving rf =0.8. Synthesis of Spin-labeled Phosphatidylcholine—Synthesis of aspin-labeled phosphatidylcholine (Fig.1B) was performed by acylation oflysophosphatidylcholine-free alcohol function with 4-doxylpentanoic acid inthe presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and4-N-dimethylaminopyridine according to Ref.19Samuel N.K.P. Singh M. Yamaguchi K. Regen S.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 102: 42-47Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar as explained before(16Fellmann P. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 27: 161-175PubMed Google Scholar). Erythrocytes—Venous blood samples were obtained fromvoluntary healthy people. Sodium citrate, 0.1 m, was added (9:1,v/v) to avoid coagulation. Erythrocytes were isolated by resuspension of 500μl of blood in 4500 μl of an isotonic phosphate-buffered saline buffer(137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4,pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatantwas removed by aspiration. This washing procedure was repeated threetimes. Giant Unilamellar Vesicles Preparation—Giant UnilamellarVesicles (GUVs) made of EPC or EPC:SM:cholesterol:Red Texasphosphatidylethanolamine (1:1:1:0.03% mol) were prepared following theelectroformation method (20Anguelova M.I. Dimitrov D.S. Faraday Discuss. Chem. Soc. 1986; 81: 303-312Crossref Google Scholar,21Mathivet L. Cribier S. Devaux P.F. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1112-1121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The fabrication chamberis composed by two conductor coverslips coated with a thin transparent film ofindium tin oxide and separated by a Teflon spacer of 0.5 mm. 15 μl of lipidsolution in chloroform at 0.25 mg/ml concentration were deposited on bothconductor coverslips. After organic solvent evaporation, the chamber wasplaced in vacuum for 1 h. The film was re-hydrated with a sucrose solution(200 mosm). The chamber was rapidly connected to an A.C. powersupply, generating a low frequency voltage (8 Hz) that was progressivelyincreased from 0 to 1.1 V in 40 min. After one night, the voltage wasincreased to 1.3 V while decreasing the frequency to 4 Hz for 1 h. Theobtained vesicles had a spherical shape. Shape Change Experiments with GUVs at 20 °C—A fewmicroliters of the solution containing spherical GUVs were transferred with amicropipette from the fabrication chamber to the observation chambercontaining 500 μl of glucose solution with an osmolarity slightly above 200mosm. The density difference between outside and inside mediaallowed the vesicles to sediment in the observation chamber and provided abetter contrast for light microscopy. To obtain prolate shape vesicles, theglucose solution was allowed to evaporate for more than 1 h at roomtemperature. Due to the difference between inside and outside osmoticpressure, 10–20% of the vesicles deflated and adopted a prolate shape.Once a vesicle was targeted a flux of the desired lipids was injected at asufficiently large distance (>1 mm) from the selected vesicle to avoidundesirable concentration gradients, turbulence due to flow of water ororganic solvent at the vicinity of the GUVs. Typically 10 μl of 0.1mm lipid in glucose solution was injected for water-soluble lipids(C6-Cer, Lyso-PC, and C6-PS). For the less solublelong-chain ceramides (C10-Cer and C16-Cer) a mixture ofethanol:dodecane (98:2, v/v) was used as solvent for the injection (2.5 μlof 0.8 mm for C10-Cer and 2.5 μl of 2 mmfor C16-Cer). The final concentration of organic solvent was∼0.5% in water (22Ji L. Zhang G. Uematsu S. Akahori Y. Hirabayashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Shapechanges induced by the redistribution of lipids and the recovery of initialshape were monitored by observation with an optical microscope (invertedmicroscope Zeiss IM35 or Nikon Eclipse E600FN) equipped with a charge-coupleddevice camera (Micro Max 5-MHz system, Princeton Instruments, Inc., or NikonDS-L1). Temperature Dependence of Ceramide Transmembrane Diffusion inGUVs—To measure the temperature dependence of the transmembranediffusion, microscope observation chamber was placed on a Peltier effectmodule (Linkam PE94 in an inverted microscope Leica DMIREZ and equipped with acharge-coupled device camera Photometrics Coolsnap CF), allowing observationsto be done at temperatures varying from 9° to 30 °C. The temperatureof the external solution could be controlled and monitored at any time by athermocouple thermometer (Fluke 51K/J thermometer) inserted into observationchamber solution. Shape change experiments were carried out as describedbefore. Shape Change Experiments with Erythrocytes—5 μl ofpelleted erythrocyte was resuspended in 5 ml of an isotonic phosphate-bufferedsaline buffer. The mixture was homogenized by shaking. Finally, 500 μl wasloaded in observation chamber. Few minutes were necessary to allowerythrocytes to sediment. To avoid the “glass effect”(23Bessis M. Nouv. Rev. Fr.Hematol. 1972; 12: 721-745PubMed Google Scholar) coverslips of observationchambers were treated with dimethyldichlorosilane. For that purpose coverslipswere incubated for 10 min in a dimethyldichlorosilane solution (2% in1,1,1-trichloromethane) rinsed with abundant methanol, ethanol, and water andallowed to dry for at least 30 min. Once an erythrocyte group was targeted,injection of molecules proceeded as in shape change experiments with GUVs.Briefly, 30 μl of 0.1 mm lipid in phosphate-buffered salinesolution was injected for water-soluble lipids (C6-Cer,C6-PC, and C6-PS) and 3 μl of 10 mmC16-Cer in ethanol:dodecane (98:2, v/v). Shape change observationswere performed as in GUVs experiments. ESR Experiments with LUVs—ESR experiments were carried outwith a 9-GHz ESR Bruker spectrometer (Bruker ER 200D SRC) connected to aPC-computer for data accumulation and treatment (Stelar, DS EPR, Mede, Italy).ESR must be carried out with LUVs, because GUVs are too dilute and fragile,hence not suitable for spectroscopic techniques. 200 nm LUVs made of EPC wereobtained by extrusion and by the freezing and thawing method(23Bessis M. Nouv. Rev. Fr.Hematol. 1972; 12: 721-745PubMed Google Scholar,24Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar, 25Traïkia M. Warschaswski D.E. Recouvreur M. Cartaud J. Devaux P.F. Eur. Biophys. J. 2000; 29: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The spin labels (0.25%mol of total lipid composition) were added to the dry lipids before vesicleformation to obtain a symmetrical distribution of probes in the two leaflets.To measure the transmembrane diffusion of spin-labeled molecules initiallyincorporated in both leaflets of LUVs (8 mm of lipids), sodiumascorbate (final concentration 10 mm), and bovine serum albumin(4.4% in weight) were added to the solution in which the LUVs were suspended.The nitroxides exposed on the outer leaflet were subsequently chemicallyreduced in <1 min (16Fellmann P. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 27: 161-175PubMed Google Scholar). Thespectral intensity of the low field line was recorded at 20 °C immediatelyafter ascorbate addition. The decrease of signal intensity, indicating theprobe diffusion from the inner to the outer monolayer (flop), was plotted as afunction of time. Half-life times were calculated by the fit to a singleexponential. ESR Experiments with Erythrocytes—Erythrocytes were washedthree times in buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4). The buffy coat and supernatant were carefully removed byaspiration, and the cells were resuspended in 500 μl at 50% hematocritbuffer. 440 μl of SL-Cer in buffer (10 μm finalconcentration) were added to cell suspension. The labeled erythrocytes wereincubated at 37 °C for 15 min to allow the spin labels to equilibratebetween both leaflets of membranes. Sodium ascorbate (5 mm finalconcentration) added to the cell suspension reduced instantaneously the labelson the outer leaflet. Further evolution of the line intensities correspondedto the outward lipid translocation. Kinetic Model—To estimate the translocation rate ofunlabeled ceramide in a GUV, we used a model(Fig. 2), which is a simplifiedversion of the model developed by Needham and Zhelev for the incorporation oflyso-PC into lipid vesicles(26Needham D. Zhelev D.V. Ann.Biomed. Eng. 1995; 23: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Data analysis has totake into account the non-negligible time of ceramide incorporation comparedwith the time of lipid flip-flop. The slow ceramide incorporation is due totwo factors: (i) ceramide injection with a micropipette is done deliberatelyfar from a selected GUV. Molecules, either monomers or micelles, have todiffuse in the water before reaching a selected GUV; (ii) the intake orpenetration of a ceramide molecule within the outer leaflet of the GUV canalso be slow. Finally, the volume of water compared with the volume occupiedby the phospholipid membranes is very high, therefore whatever the partitioncoefficient, only a small fraction of the ceramide injected will be localizedeventually in the membrane of a lipid vesicle. It is hard to know at whichstage the mixture of ethanol:dodecane plays a role to accelerate the intakeexcept to say that in the absence of a small amount of organic solvent theincorporation of long-chain ceramides (C10-Cer andC16-Cer) is almost null. Because a detailed model would require toomany unknown parameters (that would be very difficult or impossible toevaluate independently, in particular because we used unlabeled molecules) wechose to account for the ceramide incorporation rather empirically by usingfor the rate of uptake an exponentially decreasing function of timef(t), which was validated by independent measurementscarried out with a fluorescent NBD-PC molecule injected in a similar fashioninto EPC GUVs. Briefly, 10 μl of a 0.1 mm NBD-PC solution in glucose (200mm) was injected at the vicinity of an EPC giant vesicle, and thefluorescence intensity was compared with the fluorescence of a control vesiclemade of EPC:NBD-PC (99:1, mol%). These experiments showed that theconcentration of NBD-PC incorporated in GUVs can be fitted by an equation ofthe form,c(t)=A(1−e−t/ti)(Eq. 1) indicating that the incorporation rate is an exponentially decreasing functionof time of the form,f(t)=Atie−t/ti(Eq. 2) where ti is the characteristic time of incorporation,which is about 5 min for NBD-PC under those experimental conditions.A is the final concentration of amphiphilic molecules incorporated inthe outer monolayer and is expressed in percentage of total lipids in the GUV.A depends upon the concentration and chain lengths of the moleculesinjected. For the ceramide experiments we can write the following differentialequation system,dcout/dt=f(t)−Koutcout+Kincin(Eq. 3) dcin/dt=Koutcout−Kincin(Eq. 4) where cout(t) andcin(t) are the ceramide concentrations (inpercentage of total lipids) in the outer and the in inner monolayer,respectively. Kout and Kin are thetranslocation rates from the outer to the inner monolayer and from the innerto the outer monolayer, respectively. We have assumed that the fraction ofceramides in the inner monolayer, which spontaneously partitions into theinternal volume of vesicle, is negligible because the internal volume of thevesicles is very small in comparison to the external volume. Furthermore, onecan assume that for a GUV both leaflets are equivalent (in terms of curvatureand tension). Therefore, Kout ≈ Kin= K. The equations can be rewritten as follows.dcout/dt=f(t)−Kcout+Kcin(Eq. 5) dcin/dt=Kcout−Kcin(Eq. 6) The GUV transition associated with a shape change depends on the differenceof lipid concentration Δc =cout(t) - cin(t)between both monolayers. Δc is the lipid asymmetry. By takinginto account the expression of f(t) the following analyticalsolution is obtained as follows.Δc(t)=Ati−12K−ti−1(e−t/ti−e−2Kt)(Eq. 7) In case of GUVs, the minimum asymmetry needed to induce a shape changes isof the order of 0.1% of the total area of a vesicle(10Berndl K. Käs J. Lipowsky R. Sackmann E. Seifert U. Europhys. Lett. 1990; 13: 659-664Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 11Farge E. Devaux P.F. Biophys.

Chem. 1993; 97: 2958-2961Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar).This means that budding transition would occur whenΔS/S > 10-3, or Δc >0.1(aEPC/aCer), whereaEPC is the area occupied by an EPC molecule andaCer is that of a ceramide molecule. Shape recovery happens when ΔS/S = 10-3,i.e. when the area of the two leaflets becomes almost identical. Thearea occupied by a ceramide molecule is probably slightly lower than the areaof a PC molecule. However, because of the uncertainty in the threshold for thebudding transition, we think that the actual difference in area between EPCand Cer is not an important source of error, so we may assume that thethreshold is Δc = 0.1. Furthermore, our objective was not todetermine an accurate value for A and ti butessentially to deduce reliable values for K. Representative theoretical curves are shown inFig. 3.Fig. 3A showsΔc for ti fixed and K variable.Fig. 3B showsΔc for K fixed and ti variable.Each curve intercepts twice the threshold line: Δc = 0.1, whichenables one to deduce two values t1 andt2 corresponding, respectively, to the budding transitionand to the reversible shape transition. Times t1 andt2 were measured for every experiment. K andti were then deduced by usingEquation 7. To determine if K and ti values obtained arevery sensitive to A and to the threshold Δc, weallowed A and Δc to vary when usingEquation 7. A was variedfrom 1 to 5 (in percentage of total lipids) with 10 steps, andΔc from 0.05 to 0.15% of membrane lipids with 5 steps. A matrixof 66 possible pairs (K and ti) was then obtainedafter using Equation 7 andfinally an averaged value of K and ti werecalculated for each experiment and for each ceramide. The uncertaintiesappearing in Table I werededuced from this averaging.Table Iτ½ of flip-flop for ceramides with different acylchain lengths in EPC vesicles at different temperatures obtained by using the“kinetic model” to analyze shape change experimentsCeramideNumber of experiments at 20 °CK at 20 °Cτ½ at 20 °Cti at 20 °CActivationenergyaValues were deduced from Arrhenius plotsτ½ at 37°CaValues were deduced from Arrhenius plotsmin-1minKcal/molsSL-CerbExperiments carried out in LUVs30.7 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.211.4 ± 1.518.6 ± 2.4C6- Cer50.6 ± 0.31.2 ± 0.618.6 ± 8.811.7 ± 4.118.1 ± 6.3C10-CercIndicates that ceramides were incorporated with the help ofethanol:dodecane (see “Experimental Procedures” for details)60.4 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.725.8 ± 12.2C16-CercIndicates that ceramides were incorporated with the help ofethanol:dodecane (see “Experimental Procedures” for details)90.3 ± 0.12.4 ± 1.038.9 ± 18.48.4 ± 3.357 ± 22a Values were deduced from Arrhenius plotsb Experiments carried out in LUVsc Indicates that ceramides were incorporated with the help ofethanol:dodecane (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) Open table in a new tab Erythrocytes—Ceramide transmembrane diffusion inerythrocytes was analyzed in a more qualitative fashion than in the case ofceramide diffusion in GUVs. The percentage of lipid asymmetry necessary totrigger a shape change in erythrocytes is known to be significantly higherthan in a GUV. Typically the lipid asymmetry Δc must be of theorder of 1% to trigger a shape change from discocytes to echinocytes(27Sheetz M.P. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4457-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). All experiments withhuman erythrocytes were repeated from three to six times, and differentobservation areas were always inspected. Thus the figures shown under“Results” are representative of many observations.

Comparing Ahr(–/–)knock-out and wild-type mice, we found that TCDD-induced thiol changes in bothcytosol and mitochondria were dependent on the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor(AHR).

A linear dependenceof H2O2 productionon thereduction potential forGSSG/2GSH exists between –150 and –300 mV. The TCDD-stimulatedincrease in succinate-dependent and thiol-stimulated production of reactiveoxygen paralleled a four-fold increase in formamidopyrimidine DNAN-glycosylase (FPG)-sensitive cleavage sites in mitochondrial DNA,compared with a two-fold increase in nuclear DNA. These results suggest thatTCDD produces an AHR-dependent oxidative stress in mitochondria, withconcomitant mitochondrial DNA damage mediated, at least in part, by anincrease in the mitochondrial thiol reduction state.

Many such processes, such asmitochondrial respiration, monooxygenase, and oxidase activities, chemicallyreduce molecular oxygen to form reactive oxygen. A resulting redox imbalancein favor of oxidation (oxidative stress) may result in a cellular oxidativestress response. The chemical reductive processes for the formation ofreactive oxygen species (mostly superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxylradical) are supported primarily by reduced pyridine nucleotides, such as NADHand NADPH. Thus, higher rates of reactive oxygen production may occur when theredox state of the cell becomes more negative, a process termed reductivestress that may originate in the cytosol(1Williamson J.R.

To minimize adverse cellular effects resulting from constitutive orexcessive exposure to reactive oxygen, most cells have an elaborate defensesystem that includes a broad spectrum of chemical and enzyme scavengers forthe oxidizing radicals and electrophiles. We have previously shown that TCDDtreatment of mice produces an increase in mitochondrial succinate-dependentreactive oxygen production; this increase was not the result of changes in themitochondrial antioxidant enzymes SOD2 (Mn-superoxide dismutase) or GPX1(glutathione peroxidase) (4Senft A.P.

TCDD also produces changesin the levels of mitochondrial GSH and GSSG(5Senft A.P. Dalton T.P. Nebert D.W. Genter M.B. Puga A. Hutchinson R.J. Kerzee J.K. Uno S. Shertzer H.G. Free Radic. Biol.

GSH is an integral oxidantscavenger, reacting as either a one-electron donor to radicals or atwo-electron donor to electrophiles, and occurs in all mammalian cell types(28Dalton T.P. Chen Y. Schneider S.N. Nebert D.W. Shertzer H.G. Free Radic. Biol.Med. 2004; 37: 1511-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In this study, wefurther evaluate the relationship between TCDD exposure, the GSSG/2GSH redoxcouple, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen production. Chemicals—TCDD was purchased from Accustandard (New Haven,CT). GSH (G6529) and GSSG (G6654) were Sigma Ultra grade from Sigma-AldrichChemicals. All other chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma-AldrichChemicals as the highest available grades. Animals and Treatment—Experiments involving mice wereperformed according to the National Institutes of Health standards for careand use of experimental animals and the University of Cincinnati InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Animals were group-housed, maintainedon a 12-h light/dark cycle, and had access to standard rodent chow and waterad libitum. Male mice (8–12 weeks of age) of the C57BL/6Jinbred strain were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME).Ahr(–/–) knock-out mice were a generous gift from FrankJ. Gonzalez (Bethesda, MD) and are maintained in our animal colony. Mice were administered a single dose of TCDD (5 μg/kg body weight) incorn oil by intraperitoneal injection; controls were given equivalentvolumes of corn oil. At 1, 7, 28, or 56 days following treatment, the micewere killed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, followed by cervical dislocation.The liver was excised and washed in ice-cold 0.9% NaCl. A 10% whole homogenatewas prepared in 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 1mm EGTA, 0.1% defatted, and recrystallized bovine serum albumin, 10mm HEPES, pH 7.2, using a motor-driven (1000 rpm) Potter-Elvejhemhomogenizer. A mitochondrial fraction was prepared as described previously(5Senft A.P. Dalton T.P. Nebert D.W. Genter M.B. Puga A. Hutchinson R.J. Kerzee J.K. Uno S. Shertzer H.G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and suspended in apotassium chloride respiratory buffer (KCl-RB), consisting of 140mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmKH2PO4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1%bovine serum albumin, in 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Reactive Oxygen Assays—H2O2 wasmonitored in freshly prepared mitochondria as luminol(5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione) chemiluminescence(4Senft A.P. Dalton T.P. Nebert D.W. Genter M.B.

Uno S. Shertzer H.G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), using a Berthold AutolumatPlus luminometer. The reaction mixture consisted of 5 μmluminol, 2.5 units/ml horseradish peroxidase, 50 μg of mitochondrialprotein, and KCl-RB, in a final volume of 1.0 ml; the reaction wasinitiated by the addition of 6 mm sodium succinate and monitored at37 °C. Catalase abolished luminol luminescence in all cases. Superoxideproduction was monitored by chemiluminescence in the same manner as that forH2O2, except the probe was 20 μm lucigenin(bis-N-methylacridinium)(5Senft A.P. Dalton T.P. Nebert D.W.

Luminol and lucigenin arehighly specific for H2O2 and superoxide, respectively(29Shertzer H.G. Clay C.D. Genter M.B. Chames M Schneider S.N. Oakley G.G. Nebert D.W. Dalton T.P. Free Radic. Biol.

Redox Potential for Glutathione—For the GSSG/2GSHhalf-reaction, GSSG + 2H+ → 2GSH, the reduction potential atpH 7 (ΔE′) is the standard reduction potential(ΔE0′) adjusted for the mass action ratio ofthe reactants and products(28Dalton T.P. Chen Y. Schneider S.N. Nebert D.W. Shertzer H.G. Free Radic. Biol.Med. 2004; 37: 1511-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar,30Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3674) Google Scholar,31Jones D.P. MethodsEnzymol. 2002; 348: 93-112Google Scholar). The ΔEvalue was calculated as shown in Equation1,ΔE={ΔE0′+(RT/nF)×(pHactual−pHstandard)}−{RT/nFln([GSH]2/[GSSG])}(Eq. 1) where n = the number of electrons transferred, R is theuniversal gas constant (8.31 J K–1 mol–1),T is the temperature in Kelvin, and F is the Faradayconstant (9.65 Coulombs × 104 mol–1). At 37°C, ΔE is as shown inEquation 2.ΔE={−240mV+(−61.5mV/2e−)×(pHactual−7.0)}−{(61.5mV/2e−)×log([GSH]2/[GSSG])}(Eq. 2) A mitochondrial pH of 7.8 was used for these calculations. Although theglutathione reduction potential is a useful indicator of thiol oxidationstate, it does not provide a direct estimate of the tendency for GSH toparticipate in thiol-disulfide exchange. We therefore calculated the valuesfor two types of thiol-disulfide switches(30Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3674) Google Scholar). The type 1 switchregulates the thermodynamics of protein-SSG mixed-thiol formation as shown inEquation 3.GSSG+protein-SH=protein-SSG+GSH(Eq. 3) Because the equilibrium constant in Equation4 is,Keq=[GSM][protein-SSG]/[GSSG][protein-SH](Eq. 4) then [GSH]/[GSSG] is the value for the type 1 switch, and is proportional to[protein-SH]/[protein-SSG]. The type 2 switch regulates the thermodynamics of protein disulfideformation (Equation 5).GSSG+protein-(SH)2=protein-SS-protein+2GSH(Eq. 5) In this case, the equilibrium constant is as shown inEquation 6,Keq=[GSH]2[protein-SS-protein]/[GSSG][protein-(SH)2](Eq. 6) and [GSH]2/[GSSG] is the value for the type 2 switch, which isproportional to [protein-(SH)2]/[protein-SS-protein]. Mitochondrial GSH Uptake—Freshly prepared mitochondria,maintained at 0 °C, were suspended in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes at 150μg of protein/ml, in KCl-RB containing GSH at various concentrations. Usinga syringe, 0.25 ml of a 27% sucrose cushion was layered under the solution ineach tube. Tubes were placed in a metal temperature block set to 37 °C,such that the walls of the tube contacted the block. Under these conditions,the temperature in the tubes reached 37 °C in 2.5 min. At various timesthe tubes were centrifuged through the sucrose cushion at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at 0 °C. The supernatant solution was aspirated, andthe pellets were washed with fresh KCl-RB. After centrifugation at 14,000× g for 10 min at 0 °C, supernatant solutions wereaspirated, and 150 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid was added to themitochondrial pellet. After sonication, GSH was determined(32Senft A.P. Dalton T.P. Shertzer H.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and expressed as nmol/mgof protein. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—The mitochondrial innermembrane potential was quantified using the cationic lipophilic dye JC-1(5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanineiodide) (33Cossarizza A. Baccarani-Contri M. Kalashnikova G. Franceschi C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.Commun. 1993; 197: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). To 10 μg ofmitochondrial protein in 1.0 ml of KCl-RB was added 0.05 nmol of JC-1.Fluorescence ratios were determined at 37 °C. Monomeric green fluorescentJC-1 accumulates in the mitochondria in accordance with the membranepotential, negative inside(34Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Above a criticalconcentration, the red fluorescent aggregates of JC-1 form. Thus, membranepotential was quantified using our experimentally determined wavelength pairs,as the ratio of red (Ex = 488 nm; Em = 595–620 nm) to green fluorescence(Ex = 488 nm; Em = 535–510 nm). The fluorescence ratios werestandardized to membrane potential by applying known concentration gradientsof potassium across the membrane, in the presence of 2 μg of valinomycin/mland applying the Nernst equation to calculate potassium diffusion potentials.This technique is applicable for generating membrane potassium diffusionpotentials to about –50 mV, with the ratio of fluorescence ratio tomembrane potential of about 2 per 100 mV. ForFig. 7, we assumed linearity toexpress the results in terms of membrane potential. DNA Strand Breakage—To estimate oxidative damage tomitochondrial and nuclear DNA, we employed an assay that takes advantage ofthe enzyme specificity of the bacterial DNA repair glycosylaseformamidopyrimidine DNA N-glycosylase (FPG), which produces alkalinecleavage-sensitive apurinic sites at 8-hydroxyguanine and 8-hydroxyadenine, aswell as the imidazole ring-opened purines(2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine and4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine)(35Boiteux S. Gajewski E. Laval J. Dizdaroglu M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 36Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem.

Res. 2000; 32: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).Using this enzymic method, DNA is not prone to spurious oxidation, andestimates of oxidative DNA damage have lower background levels than thoseobtained using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) withelectrochemical detection or mass spectrometry. Our assay was based on previously reported techniques(35Boiteux S. Gajewski E. Laval J. Dizdaroglu M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar,40Hartwig A. Dally H. Schlepegrell R. Toxicol. Lett. 1996; 88: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) but varied in manyrespects. For FPG analysis of 8-OHdG, a 100-mg piece of liver was frozen inliquid nitrogen, then thawed and homogenized in lysis buffer (6 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mm KH2PO4,137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) at 0 °C.DNA extraction employed the NaI method using the DNA extractor WB kit (WakoBioProducts, Richmond, VA). In the absence or presence of FPG (100-folddilution), 3 μg of DNA was incubated with 20 μl of enzyme reactionbuffer (10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1mg/ml bovine serum albumin, in 10 mm bis-Tris buffer, pH 7.0).After 30 min at 37 °C, 37.5 μl of alkaline buffer (13 mmsodium EDTA, 370 mm NaCl, and 72 mn NaOH, pH 12.3), wereadded, and the DNA was allowed to unwind in the dark on ice for 30 min. Thesolution was neutralized with 11.5 μl of 0.1 n HCl andsonicated. A 100-μl aliquot was mixed with 870 μl of enzyme reactionbuffer plus 30 μl of 0.02 mg/ml Hoechst 33258. After 10 min, fluorescencewas determined at 360Ex/450Em. Standard fluorescencecurves for single-stranded DNA (ΦX174 Virion DNA; New England Biolabs,Inc., Beverly, MA) and double-stranded DNA (ΦX174 RFII DNA) standardsshowed that the fluorescence intensity ratio for DS-DNA/SS-DNA was 3.5. It wasassumed that freshly isolated DNA with no treatment was entirelydouble-stranded. The FPG-mediated percent increase in single-stranded DNA wascalculated from the decrease in fluorescence following FPG treatment. Other Assays—GSH and GSSG were determined fluorometricallyusing the o-phthalaldehyde procedure(32Senft A.P. Dalton T.P. Shertzer H.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Protein was measured bythe bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce), according to details provided by themanufacturer. Statistics—Statistical differences between group mean valueswere determined by one-way analysis of variance, followed by theStudent-Newman-Kuels test for pairwise comparison of means. Statistics wereperformed using SigmaStat Statistical Analysis software (SPSS Inc., Chicago,IL). Biohazard Precaution—TCDD is highly toxic and a likely humancarcinogen. All personnel were instructed in safe handling procedures. Labcoats, gloves, and masks were worn at all times, and contaminated materialswere collected separately for disposal by the Hazardous Waste Unit or byindependent contractors. TCDD-treated mice were housed separately, and theircarcasses were treated as contaminated biological materials. TCDD Effects on Reactive Oxygen Production and Mitochondrial andCytosolic GSH and GSSG—Following a single exposure to TCDD (5μg/kg body weight), mitochondrial succinate-dependent production of bothsuperoxide and hydrogen peroxide was unchanged at day 1, doubled by day 7, andremained elevated until day 28, and then subsided to near control levels byday 56 (Fig. 1). Concomitantwith the increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen production, the cytosoliclevels of GSH were slightly increased, whereas GSSG levels more than doubled(Fig. 2, left panels);these relative changes in GSH and GSSG produced decreases in the potential toreduce protein-SSG mixed disulfide bonds (type 1 thiol redox switch) andprotein-SS-protein disulfide bonds (type 2 thiol redox switch), as well as a+10 mV change in the GSSG/2GSH reduction potential. These results reflect atypical oxidative stress response for the cytosol following TCDD treatment. Insharp contrast to the changes observed in the cytosol, mitochondrial levels ofGSH nearly doubled, whereas GSSG was only slightly increased(Fig. 2, rightpanels); this increase in GSH relative to GSSG resulted in an increase inreduction state, with increases in type 1 and type 2 thiol redox switches,accompanied by a negative shift in the GSSG/2GSH reduction potential by 25mV.Fig. 2Effect of TCDD treatment on cytosolic and mitochondrial GSH and GSSGredox state.

To extend theseobservations in the context of the present study, we examined hepaticglutathione levels in Ahr(–/–) knock-out mice andcalculated parameters of thiol status in cytosol and in mitochondria(Fig. 3). TCDD-inducedalterations in glutathione redox state were observed in wild-type but notAhr(–/–) mice, indicating an AHR-dependent process. GSH Uptake and Effects of GSH and GSSG Added in Vitro onH2O2 Production in Isolated Mitochondria—Todetermine the relationship between mitochondrial production of reactiveoxygen, glutathione levels, and the redox state, we examined the directeffects of GSH and GSSG on mitochondrial H2O2production. It was first important to determine whether externally added GSHcan indeed enter the mitochondria. The rates of mitochondrial uptake or effluxof GSH are shown in Fig. 4. Inthe absence of external GSH, there is slow loss of internal GSH at 37 °C.Externally added GSH is rapidly taken up by mitochondria, with a slight lag asthe reaction mixture warms. The addition of GSH in the range of 0.1 to 8mm greatly stimulated succinate-dependentH2O2 production in a concentration-dependent fashion(Fig. 5, left panel).Conversely, GSSG, in the range of 0.05 to 0.4 mm, attenuatedsuccinate-dependent H2O2 production at every GSHconcentration. The data from the left panel ofFig. 5 were recalculated(Fig. 5, right panel)to show a linear dependence of H2O2 production on thereduction potential for GSSG/2GSH between –150 and –300 mV.Excluding exposure to strong oxidizing agents and electrophiles, this rangerepresents the complete biological range of hepatic reduction potential forthe GSSG/2GSH redox half-reaction.Fig. 5Direct effects of the in vitro addition of GSH and GSSG onmitochondrial H2O2 production. Hepatic mitochondriafrom untreated mice were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of variousconcentrations of GSH (0.1–8 mm) and GSSG (0.05–0.4mm). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 6 mmsuccinate. Results (left panel) are presented as the average peakluminescence (using luminol, as described in the legend toFig. 1) obtained from twoexperiments. Luminescence results are re-plotted against calculated values forthe GSSG/2GSH half-cell redox potential (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our previously published results showed that TCDD produces an increase inoxygen consumption without a change in energy coupling(4Senft A.P.

We might predict that thedriving force for the increase in oxygen consumption could be a TCDD-mediatedhyperpolarization of the liver mitochondrial membrane potential. Thisprediction was confirmed (Fig.6). At 1 week following TCDD treatment, a succinate-dependentincrease in the JC-1 aggregate fluorescence ratio (an estimate of membranepotential) approximately doubled. Mitochondrial versus Nuclear Genotoxicity Induced by TCDD—Todetermine the genotoxic relevance of TCDD-induced reactive oxygen production,we evaluated mitochondrial and nuclear oxidative DNA damage resulting fromTCDD exposure. We used the enzyme FPG to generate single-strand breakage inDNA containing the major oxidative promutagenic DNA base modification 8-OHdG,followed by alkaline unwinding and quantification of single- anddouble-stranded DNA. At 1 week after TCDD treatment, the percentage ofFPG-sensitive sites doubled in nuclear DNA, whereas the percentage increased4-fold in mitochondrial DNA (Fig.7). Cellular Redox Homeostasis—Normal cells maintain a specificredox homeostasis, such that important redox couples are maintained withinphysiologic ranges for oxidation and reduction. Such couples include therelatively oxidized NAD+/NADH, and the relatively reduced couplesNADP+/NADPH and GSSG/2GSH(28Dalton T.P. Chen Y. Schneider S.N. Nebert D.W. Shertzer H.G. Free Radic.

https://openalex.org/W2060399754,"Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective lysosomal proteindegradative process that is activated in higher organisms under conditions ofprolonged starvation and in cell culture by the removal of serum. Ketonebodies are comprised of three compounds (β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate,and acetone) that circulate during starvation, especially during prolongedstarvation. Here we have investigated the hypothesis that ketone bodies induceCMA. We found that physiological concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate(BOH) induced proteolysis in cells maintained in media with serum and withoutserum; however, acetoacetate only induced proteolysis in cells maintained inmedia with serum. Lysosomes isolated from BOH-treated cells displayed anincreased ability to degrade both glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase andribonuclease A, substrates for CMA. Isolated lysosomes from cells maintainedin media without serum also demonstrated an increased ability to degradeglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ribonuclease A when the reactionwas supplemented with BOH. Such treatment did not affect the levels oflysosome-associated membrane protein 2a or lysosomal heat shock cognateprotein of 70 kDa, two rate-limiting proteins in CMA.

The induction of CMA by ketone bodies may providean important physiological mechanism for the activation of CMA duringprolonged starvation. For eukaryotic cells to maintain homeostasis, a balance between proteinsynthesis and proteolysis must exist. This balance is achieved in a variety ofways. Cells have the ability to control protein synthesis by regulatingtranscription and translation(1Saklatvala J. Curr. Opin.Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 372-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar,2Leung K.C. DNA CellBiol. 2004; 23: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Similarly, cells can alsocontrol protein degradation by using a variety of cellular processes such aslysosomal degradative pathways and the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway(3Hoff H. Zhang H. Sell C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 285: 79-92PubMed Google Scholar,4Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Science. 2004; 306: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). The lysosomal degradative pathways can be separated into endocytosis,macroautophagy, crinophagy, pexophagy, micro-autophagy, and chaperone-mediatedautophagy (CMA) 1The abbreviations used are: CMA, chaperone-mediated autophagy; BOH,β-hydroxybutyrate; DNP, 2,4,dinitrophenylhydrazone; GAPDH,glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; hsc70, 70-kDa heat shock cognateprotein; lamp2a, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2a; lyhsc70, 70-kDalysosomal heat shock cognate protein; PDL, population doubling level.; onlythe latter pathway does not involve vesicular membrane traffic(5Dice J.F. Lysosomal Pathways ofProtein Degradation: Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit 11. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2000Crossref Google Scholar). Autophagy, literally“self-eating,” is a cellular process that allows cells to removeproteins, organelles, and foreign bodies from the cytosol and deliver them tolysosomes for degradation. CMA is a process activated during long term starvation in which cellsselectively degrade proteins in order to recycle their amino acids or use themfor energy. During nutrient deprivation, substrates that contain a consensusmotif related to KFERQ (6Dice J.F. Trends Biochem.Sci. 1990; 15: 305-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) arerecognized by a chaperone-cochaperone complex containing the heat shockcognate protein of 70 kDa (hsc70)(7Agarraberes F.A. Dice J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,8Chiang H.L. Terlecky S.R. Plant C.P. Dice J.F. Science. 1989; 246: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Once thischaperone-cochaperone complex binds the substrate, it docks on the lysosomalmembrane via a receptor known as the lysosomal associated membrane protein 2a(lamp2a) (9Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Traffic. 2000; 1: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The substratethen is unfolded (10Salvador N. Aguado C. Horst M. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27447-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),presumably by the chaperone-cochaperone complex, translocated into the lumenwith the help of a lysosomal isoform of hsc70 (lyhsc70)(11Agarraberes F.A. Terlecky S.R. Dice J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and degraded. Like mostorganelle protein import pathways, CMA is saturable as well astemperature-dependent (12Cuervo A.M. Terlecky S.R. Dice J.F. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26374-26380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Terlecky S.R. Dice J.F. J.Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23490-23495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrates for CMAalso compete with one another for binding and import, which provides anexperimental method for discovering new substrates(12Cuervo A.M. Terlecky S.R. Dice J.F. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26374-26380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There have been severalsubstrates identified for CMA including ribonuclease A (RNase A) andglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)(14Dice J.F. Chiang H.L. Spencer E.P. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6853-6859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Aniento F. Roche E. Cuervo A.M. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10463-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CMA has beenreconstituted using lysosomes isolated from human fibroblasts and rat liver,which permits the study of CMA in a more mechanistic fashion(8Chiang H.L. Terlecky S.R. Plant C.P. Dice J.F. Science. 1989; 246: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar,16Terlecky S.R. Chiang H.L. Olson T.S. Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9202-9209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ketone bodies are produced by the liver during long term starvation inresponse to rapid lipolysis. Ketone bodies can be utilized by muscle andcontribute to the preservation of muscle mass during prolonged survival; theycan also be used as an energy source for the brain(17Cahill Jr., G.F. N. Engl. J.Med. 1970; 282: 668-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,18Owen O.E. Morgan A.P. Kemp H.G. Sullivan J.M. Herrera M.G. Cahill Jr., G.F. J. Clin.Investig. 1967; 46: 1589-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Ketone bodies arecomprised of three biologically active compounds, namely acetoacetate,β-hydroxybutyrate (BOH), and acetone(19Kalapos M.P. Biochim. Biophys.Acta. 2003; 1621: 122-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,20Sumbilla C.M. Zielke C.L. Reed W.D. Ozand P.T. Zielke H.R. Biochim. Biophys.Acta. 1981; 675: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, theincrease in the concentration of circulating ketone bodies parallels theinduction of CMA, which is also activated by prolonged starvation(5Dice J.F. Lysosomal Pathways ofProtein Degradation: Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit 11. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2000Crossref Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrate that treatment of cells with ketone bodiesincreases the proteolysis of long-lived proteins under conditions in whichmost proteolysis is due to CMA(28Chiang H.L. Dice J.F. J.Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6797-6805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also show that theincrease in proteolysis observed is at least in part due to the stimulation ofCMA. Lastly, we show that ketone bodies induce CMA by oxidizing substrates,permitting them to be recognized by the CMA machinery and imported into thelysosome more efficiently. Cell Culture and Isolation of Lysosomes—Human embryonicfibroblasts (IMR-90) were obtained from Corriel Cell Repositories (Camden,NJ). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma)supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and 1% antibiotic(penicillin/streptomycin with fungicide; Invitrogen). IMR-90 cells were usedfor experiments at 20–40 population doubling levels (PDLs). To deprivecells of serum, cultures were washed several times with Hanks' balanced salts'solution (Invitrogen) and then placed in media without serum. Lysosomes fromIMR-90 cells were isolated as described previously(21Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Lysosomal matrixpreparations were prepared by subjecting the lysosomes to hypotonic shock, asreported previously (22Ohsumi Y. Ishikawa T. Kato K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 547-556PubMed Google Scholar). Lysosomal Latency Assay—To assess the integrity of thelysosomal membrane, we performed a β-hexosaminidase latency study asdescribed previously (13Terlecky S.R. Dice J.F. J.Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23490-23495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Lysosomal preparations that contained >10% broken lysosomes, as determinedby β-hexosaminidase latency, were not used. Chemicals and Antibodies—All chemicals were obtained fromSigma unless otherwise indicated. GAPDH was obtained from Roche AppliedScience, and RNase A was obtained from Worthington Biochemical Company(Lakewood, NJ). Antibodies against lamp2a were obtained from ZymedLaboratories Inc.. Antibodies against GAPDH were obtained from Biodesign(Saco, ME), and antibodies against hsc70 were obtained from MaineBiotechnology Services (Portland, ME). Detection of the formation of carbonylgroups in proteins was performed by following the manufacturer's instructionsusing the OxyBlot™ oxidized protein detection kit supplied by ChemiconInternational (Temecula, CA). [14C]GAPDH and [14C]RNaseA were radiolabeled by using [14C]formaldehyde reductivemethylation as described previously(23Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. J.Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4359-4365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular Protein Degradation—Confluent cells were labeledwith [3H]leucine (2 μCi/ml) for 48 h in media containing 10%newborn calf serum. Cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced saltsolution, and the media were replaced with either complete media or mediawithout serum both containing excess (2.8 mm) unlabeled leucine(24Auteri J.S. Okada A. Bochaki V. Dice J.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 115: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Aliquots of media (200μl) were taken at the indicated time intervals and precipitated in 20%trichloroacetic acid. Proteolysis was determined by measuring the percent ofacid soluble radioactivity compared with the total radioactivity of celllysates prepared by the addition of 0.1 n NaOH and 0.1% sodiumdeoxycholate (24Auteri J.S. Okada A. Bochaki V. Dice J.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 115: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In Vitro Lysosomal Import and Protease Protection Assays—[14C]GAPDH and [14C]RNase A were incubated in thepresence of isolated lysosomes for 1.5 h as described previously(13Terlecky S.R. Dice J.F. J.Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23490-23495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation wascalculated as the percent of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivityconverted from the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity(13Terlecky S.R. Dice J.F. J.Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23490-23495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protease protectionassay was performed as described previously(7Agarraberes F.A. Dice J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, GAPDH wasincubated with purified lysosomes treated with 100 μmchymostatin A. The GAPDH was incubated with the lysosomes for 30 min and thenwashed and treated with 10 μg of proteinase K and 1 μmCaCl2 for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by incubation with4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride. Lysosomes were solubilized andprocessed for SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation of GAPDH—Cells were placed in conditionsof serum deprivation for 24 h. The cells were washed twice in ice-coldphosphate-buffered saline and incubated in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.01 μg/ml each aprotinin,leupeptin, and pepstatin for 15 min The lysate was collected by centrifugingthe samples at 14,000 × g for 15 min. Aliquots were then takenand precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h.Antibody (8 μg) was added to the precleared lysate and incubated overnightat 4 °C. The antibody-antigen complex was removed from the lysate bycentrifuging the samples at 10,000 × g for 30 s to pellet theprotein A-Sepharose beads. The supernatant was discarded, and beads washed anadditional three times. The beads were resuspended in Laemmli sample bufferand subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. General Methods—Protein determination was performed usingthe Lowry method with bovine serum albumin as a standard(25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein detectionmethods such as SDS-PAGE (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar)and immunoblotting (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar) werevisualized using chemiluminescence detection methods (Western Lightning;PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Radioactivity was determined by counting samplesin a Packard liquid scintillation analyzer with quenching detected by anautomatic external standard (Packard Tri-Carb 2100 TR). Densitometric analysiswas performed by using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. Statistical analyses werepreformed using the two-tailed Student's t test. In confluent cultures of IMR-90 human fibroblasts, serum withdrawalactivates CMA (5Dice J.F. Lysosomal Pathways ofProtein Degradation: Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit 11. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2000Crossref Google Scholar,28Chiang H.L. Dice J.F. J.Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6797-6805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using pulse-chaseanalysis, we analyzed the effect of BOH on cellular proteolysis in IMR-90cells maintained in media with or without serum(Fig. 1a). We observedan increase in proteolysis in BOH-treated cells maintained either with orwithout serum as compared with control. In cells maintained in media withserum, proteolysis increased to that of control cells maintained withoutserum. We found similar effects of BOH-induced proteolysis using Chinesehamster ovary cells (data not shown). Treating cells with acetoacetateresulted in an increase in proteolysis only in cells maintained in mediacontaining serum (Fig.1b). Because BOH had a more dramatic activation of CMA,we chose to focus on the BOH induction of CMA. Because CMA is activated byserum withdrawal, all cell cultures were serum-deprived 24 h prior toexperimentation unless noted otherwise. Treatment with oxidizing agents during prolonged nutrient deprivation maydecrease lysosomal stability(29Olejnicka B.T. Dalen H. Baranowski M.M. Brunk U.T. Redox. Rep. 1997; 3: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar,30Persson H.L. Nilsson K.J. Brunk U.T. Redox Rep. 2001; 6: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To address the issue oflysosomal stability we performed a β-hexosaminidase latency assay.Lysosomes were isolated from cells in the absence or presence of BOH. Theisolated lysosomes were kept at 37 °C, and the latency was measured ateither 0, 15 or 30 min after isolation. The stability of the lysosomes fromtreated cells was indistinguishable from those isolated from treated cells atall time points (Fig. 2). Afterisolation, ∼1% of the total lysosomes were broken in both treated anduntreated lysosomes. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 and 30 min, thepercentage of broken lysosomes rose to 1.5 ± 0.5 and 1.75 ±0.5%, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that treatment with BOH does notaffect the stability of the lysosomes. To explore the mechanisms for the BOH-induced CMA, we performed invitro CMA degradation assays using isolated lysosomes. In these assays,isolated lysosomes combined with substrates of CMA such as[14C]GAPDH and [14C]RNase A allowed us to determine thepercentage of lysosomal protein degradation by measuring the change oftrichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity into trichloroaceticacid-soluble radioactivity(15Aniento F. Roche E. Cuervo A.M. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10463-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,28Chiang H.L. Dice J.F. J.Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6797-6805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lysosomes isolated from BOH-treated cells showed an increase indegradation of both [14C]GAPDH(Fig. 3a) and[14C]RNase A (Fig.3b) as compared with controls. Degradation of both[14C]GAPDH and [14C]RNase increased with increasedamounts of lysosomal protein (0,14, 28, and 56 μg) At 14 μg of lysosomalprotein there was no significant difference in the degradation of[14C]GAPDH or [14C]RNase A between lysosomes isolatedfrom control versus treated cells; however, at 28 and 56 μg oflysosomal protein from treated cells there was a 2- and 3-fold increase in thedegradation of [14C]GAPDH, respectively, in treated compared withcontrol cells. Similarly, with 28 and 56 μg of lysosomal protein there wasa 3- and 5-fold increase in the degradation of [14C]RNase A,respectively, compared with control. These data indicate that the observedincrease in proteolysis was due, at least in part, to the stimulation ofCMA. To determine the mechanism of activation of CMA by BOH we isolatedlysosomes from cells and then added varying concentrations of BOH(Fig. 4). The degradation wasenhanced by increasing the concentration of BOH, achieving a maximal responseat 4 mm. The observed increase in the proteolysis of[14C]GAPDH and [14C]RNase A indicated that BOH wasacting on the lysosome and/or substrates to elicit an effect. We next wanted to determine whether BOH has an effect on the levels of keyproteins involved in CMA, namely lamp2a and lyhsc70. The amount of lamp2a inthe lysosome membrane is rate-limiting for CMA under a variety ofphysiological and pathological conditions(31Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. J.Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4441-4450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of lyhsc70can also be rate-limiting under conditions such as prolonged starvation(32Cuervo A.M. Knecht E. Terlecky S.R. Dice J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1200-C1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We isolated lysosomesfrom control and BOH-treated cells and measured protein levels by immunoblotanalysis. We found that the amount of hsc70 and lamp2a in the membrane andlyhsc70 in the membrane and matrix of lysosomes were equivalent in control andtreated cells (Fig. 5).Therefore, BOH was inducing CMA without altering the levels of these keyproteins. The proteolysis assays using isolated lysosomes (Figs.3 and4) reflect a combination ofsubstrate binding, transport, and degradation(13Terlecky S.R. Dice J.F. J.Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23490-23495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To establish whethersubstrate was entering BOH-treated lysosomes more efficiently than untreatedlysosomes, we performed a proteinase K protection assay. We isolated lysosomesfrom IMR-90 cells and treated them with protease inhibitors. Lysosomes werethen incubated with BOH and GAPDH or GAPDH alone. After 1 h of incubation, wewashed the lysosomes and treated with proteinase K to cleave any remainingsubstrate bound to the lysosomal membrane. We then carried out immunoblots ofthe isolated lysosomes to measure the amount of GAPDH that had beentransported into the lysosomes (Fig.6). The lysosomes incubated with BOH showed a 2.5-fold increase inthe amount of GAPDH that was transported into the lysosome(Fig. 6). These data suggestthat in a reaction mixture containing BOH, GAPDH, and lysosomes, the GAPDHundergoes a more efficient uptake compared with a reaction mixture deprived ofBOH, suggesting that BOH acts on the substrate, the lysosome, or both. Next, we isolated lysosomes from IMR-90 cells. The lysosomes and/orGAPDH/RNase A were pretreated with 4 mm BOH and then subjected to atransport assay (Fig. 7). Wefound that when substrate was preincubated with BOH there was a 2-foldincrease in its degradation compared with untreated substrates. BOH-pretreatedlysosomes degraded both substrates at the same rate as untreated lysosomes.These data suggest that BOH acts on substrates and causes them to be degradedby CMA more efficiently. One possibility is that BOH directly or indirectly causes proteins to beoxidized, making the damaged proteins better substrates for CMA. To test thisidea, we looked at the accumulation of oxidized GAPDH in BOH-treated IMR-90cells. We immunoprecipitated GAPDH from either BOH-treated or untreated cellsand then performed an OxyBlot™ assay, which derivatizes carbonyl groupsto a 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (DNP) moiety. The DNP moiety can then bedetected using anti-DNP antibodies and is a method to assay for one form ofoxidative damage to a protein. We then subjected the immunoprecipitated GAPDHto an OxyBlot™ assay followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis usingthe anti-DNP antibody as our primary antibody. We found that GAPDH fromBOH-treated cells was oxidized ∼3-fold more than GAPDH from control cells,suggesting one mechanism for the stimulation of CMA by BOH(Fig. 8a,). RNase A isnot an intracellular protein, so we could not follow the same procedures asfor GAPDH. In this case, we incubated RNase A with 4 mm BOH andfound that there was an increase in the appearance of carbonyl groups comparedwith control. RNase A incubated with BOH for 4 or 24 h showed ∼2- and3-fold increases, respectively, in carbonyl groups compared with untreatedRNase A (Fig. 8b). Finally, to determine whether the stimulation of CMA by BOH was specificfor BOH, we tested compounds structurally similar to BOH, butanone, andbutanol. We treated cells with both butanone and butanol (4 mmeach) (Fig. 9a), butwe did not observe any effect on proteolysis in the absence or presence ofserum. We next asked if another compound whose concentration increases duringstarvation, glycerol, could stimulate CMA. We treated cells with glycerolconcentrations ranging from 0.05 to 5.0 mm and measured theiraffects on CMA (Fig.9b). There was no significant affect of glycerol on thestimulation of proteolysis. Taken together, these data suggest that BOHstimulates CMA in a specific manner. Five lines of evidence indicate that ketone body formation leads toincreased proteolysis by CMA. First, IMR-90 cells treated with BOH and, to alesser extent, acetoacetate increased proteolysis in cells maintained inserum-supplemented media (Fig. 1,a and b). Acetone could not be tested because ofits volatility. 2P. F. Finn and J. F. Dice, unpublished results.Second, we found that lysosomes isolated from BOH-treated cells transportedand degraded substrates of CMA at a higher rate than control lysosomes(Fig. 3, a and3b). Third, BOH-treated substrates were degraded bylysosomes at a higher rate than untreated substrates, suggesting that BOH actsthrough substrate modification to stimulate CMA(Fig. 7). Fourth, BOHincubation with RNase A increases the formation of carbonyl groups in RNase A(Fig. 8b). Lastly, wedemonstrated that GAPDH, a substrate for CMA, immunoprecipitated from cellstreated with BOH showing a higher occurrence of oxidative damage as comparedwith control (Fig.8a). The effects of ketone bodies have been extensively studied on tissues thatutilize them for energy, such as skeletal muscle and brain. The use of ketonebodies as an energy source prevents the catabolism of essential proteins andpreserves amino acid pools within the cell during times of nutritional stress(33Russell III, R.R.

NMR Biomed. 2002; 15: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The effects of ketone bodies on cell types that do not utilize ketone bodiesfor energy, such as IMR-90 cells, have not been closely studied even thoughthey survive in an environment in which ketone bodies reach significantly highlevels of 1–12 mm(37Fery F. Balasse E.O. Diabetes. 1985; 34: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The ability of BOH toincrease protein breakdown in times of nutritional stress may be one moreevolutionary mechanism for cells to survive prolonged nutrient deprivationwithout using ketone bodies for energy. Previous studies have shown that oxidized proteins make better substratesfor CMA (38Kiffin R. Christian C. Knecht E. Cuervo A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4829-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Our results areconsistent with those of Kiffin et al.(38Kiffin R. Christian C. Knecht E. Cuervo A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4829-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), who demonstrated thatoxidized proteins have the ability to bind and translocate into the lysosomemore rapidly than non-oxidized proteins. The mechanism of enhanced substrateuptake due to oxidation is not clear. We do know that substrates must beunfolded prior to translocating across the lysosomal membrane(10Salvador N. Aguado C. Horst M. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27447-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the unfoldingof proteins after oxidation may promote recognition by thechaperone-cochaperone complex and increase the rate of delivery and uptake ofoxidized substrates into the lysosome. It is interesting to note that in Fig.4 the broken lysosomes actually have a decreasing degradativecapacity in the presence of increasing concentrations of BOH. This may beexplained by the fact that increasing concentrations of BOH may be damagingand inactivating the degradative enzymes, thus causing less proteolysis.Future studies could focus on the effect that BOH treatment has on enzymefunction. Also in Fig. 3 weobserved that there was no difference between the amount of degradationbetween 0 and 14 μg of lysosomal protein. One explanation of thisobservation is that our degradation assay is not sensitive enough to detectchanges in degradation with this amount of lysosomal protein. With nolysosomes added we found 1–2% protein degradation. Undoubtedly, oneneeds enough of a signal above 1–2% to reflect CMA. If this were thecase one would expect to see an increase in degradation by adding higherconcentrations of lysosomes, which is in fact what we observed. We demonstrated that there was an increase in the degradation of[14C]GAPDH by lysosomes isolated from cells treated with 4mm BOH for 24 h (Fig.3). However, we saw no increase in proteolysis when lysosomes werepreincubated with 4 mm BOH for 20 min(Fig. 7). One explanation forthis apparent discrepancy is that isolated lysosomes normally have CMAsubstrates bound. These substrates will compete with [14C]GAPDH or[14C]RNase for uptake. The lysosomes isolated from BOH-treatedcells will have fewer CMA substrates bound because they are more efficientlytranslocated and degraded (Fig.6). Therefore, lysosomes isolated from BOH-treated cells will havea higher activity for added radiolabeled substrates. The lysosomespreincubated with BOH for 20 min may not have had sufficient time to processnonradioactive bound CMA substrates. We are unable to test this idea, becausethe isolated lysosomes are not stable during prolonged incubation times. Whenever we compared intracellular proteolysis rates, cells were ofequivalent PDLs between 20 and 40. However, proteolytic rates betweenexperiments were somewhat variable (Figs.1, a and band 9, a andb). In 100 independent experiments we obtained half-livesof 48 ± 6 and 28 ± 6 h in cells maintained with or withoutserum, respectively. IMR-90 cells in media without serum have been shown toincrease the half-life of long-lived proteins by 20 min per PDL(38Kiffin R. Christian C. Knecht E. Cuervo A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4829-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Therefore, varying PDLsbetween 20 and 40 h will lead to variability in at½ of ±7 h. There are several possible mechanisms to explain BOH stimulation of CMA.First, BOH likely causes protein oxidation by increasing reactive oxygenspecies, which could lead to an increase in total oxidized proteins(39Forsberg H. Eriksson U.J. Melefors O. Welsh N. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 255-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because 30% of cytosolicproteins are substrates for CMA, this could result in higher rate ofdegradation for these proteins by CMA. Kiffin et al.(38Kiffin R. Christian C. Knecht E. Cuervo A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4829-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) demonstrated an increasein the levels of several CMA components, such as lamp2a, in response tooxidation-induced activation of CMA(38Kiffin R. Christian C. Knecht E. Cuervo A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4829-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). These results aresomewhat different from ours, as we could not see a measurable change in thelevels of lamp2a or the luminal chaperone. These differences could beexplained by the fact that Kiffin et al.(38Kiffin R. Christian C. Knecht E. Cuervo A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4829-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) dosed their rodents twicewith paraquat or hydrogen peroxide to oxidize proteins. Treatment withpro-oxidants of this magnitude may increase the levels of oxidized proteinsand force the cell to up-regulate components of CMA in order to deal with theincreased demand of substrates. BOH, on the other hand, may only oxidize asmall percentage of proteins, permitting the cell to degrade the damagedproteins without increasing components of the pathway. Second, BOH, a consumer of NAD+(40Takehiro M. Fujimoto S. Shimodahira M. Shimono D. Mukai E. Nabe K. Radu R.G. Kominato R. Aramaki Y. Seino Y. Yamada Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E372-E380Google Scholar), may elevate theNADH/NAD+ ratio, similar to what occurs during starvation(41Scotini E. Caparrotta L. Tessari F. Fassina G. Life Sci. 1983; 32: 2701-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and cause the cell toactivate CMA as part of the nutrient stress response. The cells would induceCMA without the need to up-regulate components of the pathway. This does notseem likely, because immunoprecipitated GAPDH from BOH-treated cells had a3-fold increase in the level of oxidation as compared with control. Futurestudies should investigate the effects of oxidants of varying strengths on themodification of substrates and the subsequent activation of CMA. Third, several studies suggest that ketone bodies have the ability to causeincreased free radical formation and lipid peroxidation in erythrocytes andendothelial cells (42Jain S.K. McVie R. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1850-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,43Jain S.K. Kannan K. Lim G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 1083-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We did observe anincrease in proteolysis in acetoacetate-treated cells maintained in serum, butnot in cells maintained without serum (Fig.1b). This could be explained by the fact thatacetoacetate has the ability to down-regulate the insulin receptor at the mRNAlevel by 56% (44Yokoo H. Saitoh T. Shiraishi S. Yanagita T. Sugano T. Minami S. Kobayashi H. Wada A. J.Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 994-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Down-regulation of the insulin receptor would stimulate the cell to respond tonutrient deprivation and activate CMA. This is one explanation as to why weonly see an activation of CMA in cells maintained in serum. Future studiesshould look at what other factors contribute to CMA activation. In these studies we have demonstrated that ketone bodies, more specificallyBOH, stimulate CMA by causing the oxidation of substrates. In addition, duringprolonged starvation CMA is activated because of increased lamp2a in thelysosomal membrane and increased lyhsc70 in the lysosomal lumen(9Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Traffic. 2000; 1: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar,31Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. J.Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4441-4450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate thatketone bodies can also stimulate CMA by affecting substrate proteins duringprolonged starvation in vivo. This finding gives us further insightinto the physiological importance of CMA stimulation during times of nutrientdeprivation. We thank Dr. Ana Maria Cuervo, Dr. Ira Herman, Dr. Laura Liscum, andNicholas T. Mesires, M.S. for valuable discussions and critical evaluation ofthis manuscript. We also thank Dr. Alfred J. Meijer for suggesting to us thatketone bodies may activate CMA."

Of the four human WNK family members, WNK1 and WNK4 have been linked to a hereditary form of hypertension, pseudohypoaldosteronism type II. We characterized the biochemical properties and regulation of WNK1 that may contribute to its physiological activities and abnormal function in disease. We showed that WNK1 is activated by hypertonic stress in kidney epithelial cells and in breast and colon cancer cell lines. In addition, hypotonic stress also led to a modest increase in WNK1 activity. Gel filtration suggested that WNK1 exists as a tetramer, and yeast two-hybrid data showed that the N terminus of WNK1 (residues 1–222) interacts with residues 481–660, which includes the WNK1 autoinhibitory domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Although cell biological studies have suggested a functional interaction between WNK1 and WNK4, we found no evidence of stable interactions between these kinases. However, WNK1 phosphorylated both WNK4 and WNK2. In addition, the WNK1 autoinhibitory domain inhibited the catalytic activity of these WNKs.

Given the potential of WNK1 to cause hypertension, we wished to determine whether WNK1 in well-differentiated epithelial cells was also sensitive to NaCl and other osmotic challenges. We found that hypertonic stresses, including glucose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, KCl, NaCl (Fig. 1, A–E), and urea (data not shown), increase WNK1 activity in DCT cells. These cells retain many properties of the distal convoluted tubule from which they were derived (12Friedman P.A. Gesek F.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F300-F308PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gesek F.A. Friedman P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In DCT cells, addition of 0.05–0.1 m NaCl to the culture medium produced a 1.5–2.0-fold increase in WNK1 activity, increasing to a maximum activation in the range of 10-fold as the added NaCl reached 0.5 m. Activation was observed after 5–10 min and persisted for at least 1–2 h. Treatment of DCT cells with 0.5 m glucose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, and urea produced a 3.0–5.0-fold increase in WNK1 activity. Treatment with 1 m sorbitol or sucrose resulted in higher WNK1 activity than did treatment with 0.5 m sorbitol or sucrose, but the activity increase was smaller than that with 0.5 m NaCl. Additionally, hypotonic stress increased WNK1 kinase activity in DCT cells, but to a lesser extent than hypertonic stress (Fig. 1G). Reduction of osmolarity below 80 mosm was sufficient to observe a small but reproducible increase in WNK1 activity. Activation at ∼40 mosm reached more than 2-fold and was observed after 5 min.WNK1 from the other epithelial cell lines tested, including the colon cancer cell lines HT-29 and SW480 and the breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, was somewhat less sensitive to 0.5 m NaCl than that from DCT cells (Fig. 1F). The extent of activation in these cell lines was not related to the amount of WNK1 present. DCT cells were among those with the smallest amount of full-length WNK1 protein, perhaps consistent with the observation that kidney predominantly expresses a splice form lacking the N terminus of WNK1 to which our antibodies were raised (19Xu Q. Modrek B. Lee C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3754-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Full-length WNK1 in DCT cells displays the greatest sensitivity to osmotic stress. The next most sensitive cell line was the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 line (20Lacroix M. Haibe-Kains B. Hennuy B. Laes J.F. Lallemand F. Gonze I. Cardoso F. Piccart M. Leclercq G. Sotiriou C. Oncol. Rep. 2004; 12: 701-707PubMed Google Scholar).In search of other WNK1 activators, mouse DCT cells, breast cancer cell lines, and HeLa cells were treated with numerous agents including epidermal growth factor, insulin, vasopressin, forskolin, parathyroid hormone, dexamethasone, aldosterone, H2O2, fetal bovine serum, and transforming growth factor β. None of these agents caused as much as a 1.5-fold increase in WNK1 activity.WNK1 Oligomerizes—In characterizing endogenous WNK1, we found that its behavior upon gel filtration suggested that it was in a large complex (Fig. 2). Using the relative position of elution of standard proteins on Superose 6 and assuming the protein is globular, the elution of WNK1 in fraction 12 was consistent with its presence in a complex with a mass of 1000 kDa. The calculated mass of endogenous human WNK1 is ∼250 kDa. We also examined the gel filtration profiles of two truncated forms of rat Myc-tagged WNK1 expressed in HEK293 cells. Myc-WNK1-(1–1193), which has a calculated mass of 130 kDa, eluted in fractions 13 and 14, consistent with a mass of ∼700 kDa, and Myc-WNK1-(1–1001), which has a calculated mass of 110 kDa, eluted in fraction 14, consistent with a mass of ∼600 kDa (Fig. 2). It seems likely that some of the reduction in apparent size of the truncated WNK1 complexes is due to loss of proteins that would normally associate with the C-terminal regions of WNK1 deleted from the expressed fragments. However, if WNK1 is a tetramer, the complexes would be expected to display a reduction in mass roughly four times the mass deleted from the fragment, and this is what was observed. These results are consistent with the possibility that WNK1 is a tetramer.Fig. 2WNK1 exists as an oligomer. COS or HEK293 cells were fractionated on a Superose 6 column. Protein standards, thyroglobulin, ferritin, and catalase were detected by staining with Coomassie Blue. The fractions were immunoblotted to detect the presence of endogenous and Myc-tagged WNK1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given the likelihood based on gel filtration that WNK1 oligomerizes, we used two-hybrid analysis to identify regions of WNK1 that associate. The WNK1 constructs tested are shown in Fig. 3A. No interactions were detected between fragments that did not include the N terminus of WNK1 (Fig. 3B). WNK1-(217–660) did not interact with itself. WNK1-(1–222) interacted most strongly with WNK1-(217–660). WNK1-(1–222) interacted with residues 481–660, suggesting that the strongest interaction is with the region following the kinase domain, which includes the autoinhibitory domain and a coiled-coil domain. Coding mutations in WNK4 associated with hypertension are in the coiled-coil domain (1Wilson F.H. Disse-Nicodeme S. Choate K.A. Ishikawa K. Nelson-Williams C. Desitter I. Gunel M. Milford D.V. Lipkin G.W. Achard J.M. Feely M.P. Dussol B. Berland Y. Unwin R.J. Mayan H. Simon D.B. Farfel Z. Jeunemaitre X. Lifton R.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). We mutated the comparable residues in WNK1 in the fragment WNK1-(217–660) and found that WNK1-(1–222) also bound to all of these mutants (Fig. 3B). Thus, these mutations, when placed in WNK1, do not cause a detectable change in interactions among WNK1 domains. The catalytic domain of WNK1, residues 217–494, does not include the regions that interact by yeast two-hybrid (residues 1–222 and 481–660), and a comparable fragment behaved as a monomer on gel filtration (data not shown). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that endogenous WNK1 and the truncated protein WNK1-(1–1001) can interact (data not shown), supporting the yeast two-hybrid findings that WNK1 self-associates.Fig. 3WNK1 and WNK4 do not bind, but WNK1 self-associates by yeast two-hybrid.

Lifton R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2064-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Two groups demonstrated that co-expression of WNK4 with the sodium chloride cotransporter reduced its surface expression (3Yang C.L. Angell J. Mitchell R. Ellison D.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 21Wilson F.H. Kahle K.T. Sabath E. Lalioti M.D. Rapson A.K. Hoover R.S. Hebert S.C. Gamba G. Lifton R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Interestingly, addition of WNK1 relieved WNK4-mediated inhibition of this ion transporter (3Yang C.L. Angell J. Mitchell R. Ellison D.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed whether WNK4 also interacts with WNK1 using pairwise yeast two-hybrid tests. Many of the WNK1 baits in Fig. 3A were tested with WNK4-(431–584), WNK4-(431–748), and WNK4-(158–444) (Fig. 3B). Several were also tested with an N-terminal fragment of WNK4 (residues 13–171) (data not shown). Using this approach, no interaction was found between any fragments of WNK1 and WNK4. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation experiments using overexpressed WNK1 and WNK4 in HEK293 cells failed to show that they bind (data not shown). Thus, we obtained no evidence to support the idea that WNK1 and WNK4 interact stably in cells.Analysis of WNK1 Phosphorylation by Phosphopeptide Mapping—To assess the complexity of autophosphorylation of the WNK1 kinase domain, the protein was subjected to tryptic phosphopeptide mapping (Fig. 4B). We previously identified two sites of autophosphorylation in the activation loop of WNK1: Ser382, a site required for activity, and Ser378, which is dispensable (9Xu B. Min X. Stippec S. Lee B.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48456-48462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). WNK1 Ser382 is partially phosphorylated as the protein is isolated (9Xu B. Min X. Stippec S. Lee B.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48456-48462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these two sites (Ser382 and Ser378) alone is expected to generate up to nine tryptic phosphopeptides (Fig. 4A). The map revealed more than a dozen phosphopeptides (Fig. 4B). We also mapped phosphopeptides in WNK1 S378A following autophosphorylation (Fig. 4C). We observed at least seven tryptic phosphopeptides; phosphorylation of Ser382 alone should account for up to three phosphopeptides. The major peptide missing from this map relative to that from the wild-type protein (labeled 7/8 in Fig. 4B) most likely contains phosphoSer378. Major phosphopeptides clearly present in both maps (labeled 1 and 4) most likely contain phospho-Ser382, based on differences in these two maps and predicted mobilities based on charge and hydrophobicity (18Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). These results are most consistent with the presence of at least one additional WNK1 autophosphorylation site within its kinase domain.Fig. 4Phosphopeptide analysis of WNK1 and WNK4 autophosphorylation. A, the activation loop sequence of WNK1 and WNK4 and the peptide fragments predicted to be generated after digestion with trypsin. WNK1 Ser382 and WNK4 Ser332 are marked with an asterisk. B, phosphopeptide map of WNK1-(194–483). Peptide identities are predicted based on mobility as noted in the text. C, WNK1 S378A-(194–483). D, WNK4-(141–436).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For comparison, we examined the tryptic phosphopeptide map of WNK4-(141–436) (Fig. 4D). The map contains a single major phosphopeptide and at least three minor phosphopeptides. The activation loop sequences of WNK4 and WNK1 are identical (Fig. 4A). Therefore, the major WNK4 phosphopeptide, migrating in approximately the same position as WNK1 peptides 1 and 4 (phospho-Ser382), most likely contains phospho-Ser332.WNK1 Phosphorylates Other WNK Family Members—We previously showed that mutation of the major WNK1 activation loop autophosphorylation site Ser382 to Ala drastically reduces both autophosphorylation and protein kinase activity using other substrates (9Xu B. Min X. Stippec S. Lee B.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48456-48462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because the kinase domains of WNK family members share high sequence identity, we tested whether WNK1 is capable of phosphorylating WNK4 and WNK2 (Fig. 5). WNK1 immunoprecipitated from DCT cells that were either untreated or treated with 0.5 m NaCl was incubated with the purified WNK4 kinase domain (residues 141–436), which displayed modest autophosphorylating activity (Fig. 5A). WNK1 from stimulated cells phosphorylated WNK4 much better than that from untreated cells, consistent with the stimulation of WNK1 by NaCl. Phosphorylation of WNK4 was also detected using GST-WNK1 and WNK1 prepared from Sf9 cells as enzymes (data not shown). Other kinases tested did not phosphorylate WNK4 (data not shown). WNK1-(194–483) purified from Sf9 cells also phosphorylated the GST-WNK2 kinase domain (Fig. 5D).Fig. 5WNK1 and WNK4 phosphorylate each other. A and B, WNK1 was immunoprecipitated from DCT cells with Q256 or Q256 preimmune serum, and the kinase domains of wild-type and S332A WNK4 prepared from Sf9 cells were used as substrates in in vitro kinase assays. A and B are both one of three experiments. WNK4 S332A migrates slightly slower than wild-type WNK4 because its His6 tag was not cleaved. C, GST-WNK1-(1–555) was used as a substrate with the kinase domains of wild-type and S332A WNK4. This is one of five experiments. D, the WNK2 kinase domain was used as a WNK1 substrate. This is one of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Peptide mapping suggested that WNK4 autophosphorylates on its activation loop site, Ser332. To confirm this result, Ser332 was mutated to Ala (Fig. 5B). Mutation of Ser332 nearly eliminated WNK4 autophosphorylation, consistent with the requirement for phosphorylation of the activation loop site to yield active WNK1 (9Xu B. Min X. Stippec S. Lee B.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48456-48462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, mutation of Ser332 resulted in a significant reduction in phosphorylation of WNK4 by WNK1. Thus, we conclude that the major site phosphorylated by WNK1 is the required activation loop site on WNK4. WNK1-(1–555) autophosphorylates at an undetectable rate because it contains the autoinhibitory domain (9Xu B. Min X. Stippec S. Lee B.H. G"
https://openalex.org/W2069279981,"Vision in dim light requires that photons absorbed by rod photoreceptors evoke signals that reliably propagate through the retina. We investigated how a perturbation in rod physiology affects propagation of those signals in the retina and ultimately visual sensitivity. Recoverin is a protein in rods that prolongs phototransduction and enhances visual sensitivity. It is not present in neurons postsynaptic to rods, yet we found that light-evoked responses of rod bipolar and ganglion cells were shortened when measured in recoverin-deficient retinas. Unexpectedly, the effect of recoverin on postsynaptic signals could not be explained by its effect on phototransduction. Instead, it is an effect of recoverin downstream of phototransduction in rods that prolongs signal transmission and enhances visual sensitivity. An important implication of our findings is that the recovery phase of the rod photoresponse does not contribute significantly to visual sensitivity near absolute threshold."

Three structures are described for bacteriophage T4 DNA-adenine methyltransferase (T4Dam) in ternary complexes with partially and fully specific DNA and a methyl-donor analog. We also report the effects of substitutions in the related Escherichia coli DNA methyltransferase (EcoDam), altering residues corresponding to those involved in specific interaction with the canonical GATC target sequence in T4Dam. We have identified two types of protein-DNA interactions: discriminatory contacts, which stabilize the transition state and accelerate methylation of the cognate site, and antidiscriminatory contacts, which do not significantly affect methylation of the cognate site but disfavor activity at noncognate sites. These structures illustrate the transition in enzyme-DNA interaction from nonspecific to specific interaction, suggesting that there is a temporal order for formation of specific contacts.

Many DNA binding proteins are noncatalytic and exert their effects by binding at appropriate locations on the double helix. A solution structure of the E. coli lac repressor DNA binding domain bound to nonspecific DNA revealed that the same set of protein residues can switch from an electrostatic interaction with the DNA backbone in a nonspecific complex to a specific binding mode with DNA base pairs in the cognate operator sequence (Kalodimos et al., 2004Kalodimos C.G.

Structure and flexibility adaptation in nonspecific and specific protein-DNA complexes.Science. 2004; 305: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Nonspecific DNA-protein interactions may accelerate target-site encounters in vivo by permitting the protein to sample many such sites in each binding event within a sliding range of ∼100 base pairs before dissociating from the DNA (Halford and Marko, 2004Halford S.E.

Proteins such as DNA methyltransferases (MTases) recognize specific nucleotide sequences with the added constraint of having to bring catalytic side chains and the target nucleotide together. In a process termed “base flipping,” DNA MTases rotate the target nucleoside ∼180° along the flanking phosphodiester bonds such that the flipped nucleoside projects into the catalytic pocket (Klimasauskas et al., 1994Klimasauskas S.

Dong A. Zhang X. Schlagman S.L. Kossykh V. Hattman S. Cheng X. Structure of the bacteriophage T4 DNA adenine methyltransferase.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar): a catalytic domain that binds the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) and a DNA binding domain that contains a β hairpin loop (residues 110–130 in T4Dam), which is conserved in the family of GATC-related MTase orthologs (Lauster et al., 1987Lauster R. Kriebardis A. Guschlbauer W.

T4Dam, like EcoDam (Urig et al., 2002Urig S. Gowher H. Hermann A. Beck C. Fatemi M. Humeny A. Jeltsch A. The Escherichia coli dam DNA methyltransferase modifies DNA in a highly processive reaction.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), modifies DNA processively, i.e., repetitively continuing catalytic function by exchanging methylation product S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) for AdoMet without dissociating from the DNA (Zinoviev et al., 2003Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Malygin E.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Bacteriophage T4 Dam DNA-(N6-adenine)-methyltransferase. Processivity and orientation to the methylation target.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7829-7833Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In a ternary complex with AdoHcy and a 12 bp synthetic DNA duplex, T4Dam interacts only with the sugar-phosphate backbone despite the presence of a central GATC sequence (Yang et al., 2003Yang Z. Horton J.R. Zhou L. Zhang X.J. Dong A. Zhang X. Schlagman S.L. Kossykh V. Hattman S. Cheng X. Structure of the bacteriophage T4 DNA adenine methyltransferase.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here we report three crystal structures of T4Dam bound to longer DNA substrates. These structures afford snapshots that suggest a possible mechanism for a pathway of stepwise recognition of the specific target sequence. Residues were identified that mediate nonspecific or sequence-specific contacts. Two Arg residues (R130 and R116) can switch roles from a purely electrostatic interaction with DNA phosphates in the nonspecific complex to a highly specific binding mode with base pairs in the specific or semispecific complex. On the other hand, the phosphate-interacting residues R95 and N118 in the specific complex are not involved in any DNA interaction in the nonspecific complex. We also investigated whether the information derived from T4Dam structure has relevance to understanding the family of bacterial Dam MTase orthologs. To this end we studied the effect of site-directed mutations in EcoDam altered at residues that are conserved within the Dam family and are known to be involved in specific interaction with the GATC target site in T4Dam. Three EcoDam variants showed changes in target-sequence specificity. R124A had an overall reduction in catalytic activity but methylated two noncanonical sequences (GATT and GATG) faster than the canonical GATC. In contrast, variants P134A and P134G retained full enzymatic activity on GATC but gained the ability to methylate the noncanonical sequences GACC and GAAC. In addition, while the L122A variant had slightly reduced activity, it showed a dramatic increase in specificity due to a loss in ability to methylate noncanonical sites. These strong effects correlate with the central role of these residues in the enzyme-DNA interface. We crystallized a ternary complex containing T4Dam, AdoHcy, and a 13-mer oligonucleotide containing a single GATC target site. The DNA duplex contains a 5′-overhanging Ade in one strand and a 5′-overhanging Thy in the other strand such that the Ade and Thy would form a base pair at the joint of two molecules if the DNA duplexes were stacked head to tail. Unexpectedly, the helical axes of the two DNA molecules in the crystal were shifted relative to one another by ∼12 Å (Figure 1A ). In the crystallographic asymmetric unit, two Dam monomers (molecules A and B) bind each DNA duplex (Figure 1A). Dam molecule A primarily binds to a single DNA duplex spanning eight base pairs. It contacts two phosphates 5′ to each GATC in both strands via hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions. These are mediated to one strand by the side chains of Q12 and S13 in the N-terminal loop and by R130 and N133 with the complementary DNA strand (Figure 1B). Dam molecule B binds the joint between the two DNA duplexes. In addition to phosphate interactions, which span 12 base pairs between the duplexes, R116 of molecule B makes bifurcated hydrogen bonding interactions with Gua in the G:C base pair at position 3 (Figures 1C and 1D). Unexpectedly, the next potential G:C base pair (position 2) is unpaired, along with the 5′-overhanging terminal Ade (position 1). The 5′-overhanging Thy of the next DNA molecule approaches, becomes extrahelical, and stacks with the Cyt of the G:C base pair (at position 3), while the phenyl ring of F111 stacks on the other side (Figure 1C). The carbonyl O4 atom of the Thy makes a van der Waals contact with M114, while its methyl group is in contact with P126 (Figure 1D). The amino acid residues involved in base-specific interactions (F111, M114, R116, and P126) and with the two phosphates 5′ to the Gua (R91 and N118) are invariant in the Dam family of GATC MTases (see Figure 1 of Yang et al., 2003Yang Z. Horton J.R. Zhou L. Zhang X.J. Dong A. Zhang X. Schlagman S.L. Kossykh V. Hattman S. Cheng X. Structure of the bacteriophage T4 DNA adenine methyltransferase.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It seems as if T4Dam traps the sequence at the joint in a conformation that mimics part (∼1/4) of the recognition sequence. We designed a self-complementary 15-mer oligonucleotide with the end sequence of the duplex representing part of the GATC target sequence (see Figure 2A ). In addition, we reduced the ratio of protein to DNA to approximately half of that previously used because we had observed two Dam molecules bound per DNA duplex. The new ternary complex of T4Dam, DNA, and AdoHcy crystallized by forming three layers of a large enzyme-substrate network (Figure S1). The enzyme-substrate complexes along one layer contain four DNA duplexes (blue, green, magenta, and orange) and five T4Dam molecules (Figure 2A). We observed three basic features of the ternary-complex layers. First, all of the joints between neighboring DNA duplexes are occupied by a Dam molecule (Figure 2A). Three of these Dam molecules have very similar protein-DNA interactions (the 3/4-site recognition), so we designated all three of them as molecule C (to distinguish from the A and B molecules shown in Figure 1). These occupy the joints between DNA duplexes, which are shown in Figure 2A as blue and green, green and magenta, and orange and blue (of the next set of four), respectively. Second, only one Dam (molecule E in Figure 2A) is bound to the specific GATC site in the middle of the orange DNA, exhibiting full-site recognition in what appears to be a catalytically competent conformation. Third, molecule D occupies the joint between magenta and orange DNA and interacts with a noncanonical site (see below). The adjacent green and blue DNA duplexes are stacked head to tail, aided by F111 stacking with 5′ Thy bases from the two duplexes (Figure 2B). There are additional base-specific interactions between the enzyme and the DNA in the joint of the two duplexes. As shown in Figure 2C, R116, P126, and M114 interact with one half-site (green duplex of Figure 2B), while S112 and R130 interact with the second half-site (blue in Figure 2B). The side chain guanidino groups of R116 and R130 form the same bifurcated hydrogen bonds with the N7 and O6 atoms of the two 5′ Gua bases, respectively. The two overhanging Thy bases differ in their interaction with T4Dam. M114 and P126 make van der Waals contacts with the methyl group and O4 atom of the green Thy base while leaving it available to make Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds with a complementary Ade base. In contrast, S112 makes two hydrogen bonds with the Watson-Crick edge of the blue Thy base, whose methyl group interacts with the Ca atom of conserved G128. These observations indicate that T4Dam preferentially binds at the joint of two duplexes, which mimics damaged DNA or altered recognition sites. This is surprising but consistent with biochemical data that suggest that binding specificity for DNA MTases is determined by the nucleotides flanking the target nucleotide and that DNA MTases bind more tightly to substrates containing mismatches at the target base (Cheng and Roberts, 2001Cheng X. Roberts R.J. AdoMet-dependent methylation, DNA methyltransferases and base flipping.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3784-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, Klimasauskas and Roberts, 1995Klimasauskas S. Roberts R.J. M.HhaI binds tightly to substrates containing mismatches at the target base.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1388-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In other words, DNA MTases do not depend on the flipped target base for recognition-site interaction. Presence of only one-half of the recognition site on one strand was sufficient for stable complex formation with T4Dam provided that the 5′ G:C base pairs were present at both ends of the palindrome (Hattman and Malygin, 2004Hattman S. Malygin E.G. Bacteriophage T2Dam and T4Dam DNA-[N6-adenine]-methyltransferases.Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 77: 67-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This is exactly what we observed for the joint formed by the 3/4-site complex. Only one T4Dam (molecule E) occupies a GATC site (orange DNA) (Figure 3A ). The β hairpin makes nearly the same specific interactions with DNA bases in the major groove as observed on the 3/4 site. F111 and S122 both insert their side chains into the DNA from the major-groove side (Figure 3A). Although the target Ade is flipped out of the duplex, its electron density was not very well ordered in the active site (see below for details of active-site interactions). The side chain of S112 occupies the space left by the flipped Ade, forming two hydrogen bonds with the “orphaned” Thy, similar to that observed in the 3/4-site complex. This S112 interaction restores hydrogen bonding to the polar edge of the orphaned Thy and replaces its stacking to the flanking base pairs (Figure 3A). The Thy-S112 interaction is similar to other protein-side-chain-orphaned base interactions such as those for Gua-Q237 of DNA-cytosine MTase HhaI (Klimasauskas et al., 1994Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. HhaI methyltransferase flips its target base out of the DNA helix.Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), Thy-Y162 of human 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase (Lau et al., 1998Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T.

Norman D.P. Verdine G.L. Structural basis for recognition and repair of the endogenous mutagen 8-oxoguanine in DNA.Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The phenyl ring of F111 intercalates into the DNA helix and stacks between the adjacent A:T base pair and the Thy:S112 “base-amino acid” pair, resulting in a local doubling in helical rise (Figure 3A). The intercalation of amino acids between DNA base pairs from the major-groove side has been described for several protein-DNA complexes. In the M.HaeIII-DNA complex, Ile221 lies between the stacked bases and opens a gap in the DNA so that the orphaned Gua pairs with an adjacent Cyt (Reinisch et al., 1995Reinisch K.M. Chen L. Verdine G.L. Lipscomb W.N.

In the very short patch-repair endonuclease-DNA complex, three aromatic residues intercalate into the DNA next to the TG mismatch (Tsutakawa et al., 1999Tsutakawa S.E. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Recognition of a TG mismatch: the crystal structure of very short patch repair endonuclease in complex with a DNA duplex.Cell. 1999; 99: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the HincII restriction endonuclease-DNA complex, a Gln side chain intercalates between two base pairs on either side of the recognition site (Horton et al., 2002Horton N.C. Dorner L.F. Perona J.J. Sequence selectivity and degeneracy of a restriction endonuclease mediated by DNA intercalation.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, intercalation by the repair enzyme formamido-pyrimidine-DNA glycosylase, in which the F111-M75 residue pair is stacked between the A:T base pair and the base-amino acid pair Cyt:R109, has been observed from the minor-groove side of DNA (Serre et al., 2002Serre L. Pereira de Jesus K. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Castaing B. Crystal structure of the Lactococcus lactis formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase bound to an abasic site analogue-containing DNA.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). F111 intercalation by molecule E into the central AT stacking effectively causes a one-base-pair lengthening of the DNA molecule depicted in orange (Figures 4A and 4B ). The expansion is propagated toward one end of the DNA molecule, resulting in two disordered nucleotides of the neighboring duplex (magenta). The 5′-overhanging Thy of the magenta DNA is pushed out and apparently becomes disordered, resulting in the Cyt of the next base pair stacking with F111 of Dam molecule D. The side chain of S112 approaches the Cyt base with the side chain hydroxyl oxygen and the exocyclic amino nitrogen N4 of the Cyt at a van der Waals distance, partly because of repulsion force between the N4 amino nitrogen (NH2) and the main chain amide nitrogen (NH) (Figure 4C). The interaction between S112 and Cyt is sufficient to displace the complementary Gua and make it disordered. The side chain of R130 skips the next A:T base pair and interacts with the Gua of the adjacent downstream G:C base pair (Figure 4C). Since the presence of a Gua downstream of a GATC (or modified TATC) site does not support catalysis (data not shown), we assume this complex exemplifies the interaction of T4Dam with an isolated TC dinucleotide site in the DNA, which does not lead to DNA methylation. Thus far we had prepared ternary complexes using the methylation reaction product AdoHcy. The protein-AdoHcy interactions for each protamer are nearly identical to those described in the T4Dam-AdoHcy binary complex (Yang et al., 2003Yang Z. Horton J.R. Zhou L. Zhang X.J. Dong A. Zhang X. Schlagman S.L. Kossykh V. Hattman S. Cheng X. Structure of the bacteriophage T4 DNA adenine methyltransferase.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the full-site recognition complex between Dam molecule E and the orange DNA (Figure 3A), the target Ade is flipped out but not fully ordered in the active site. We reasoned that product AdoHcy might signal the enzyme to release from the target site in order to exchange for AdoMet prior to the next methyl transfer. Thus, stable binding of the flipped Ade in the active-site pocket probably requires AdoMet, as has been suggested for EcoDam (Liebert et al., 2004Liebert K. Hermann A. Schlickenrieder M. Jeltsch A. Stopped-flow and mutational analysis of base flipping by the Escherichia coli Dam DNA-(adenine-N6)-methyltransferase.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the AdoMet analog sinefungin (adenosyl ornithine) to prepare a new ternary complex because it also carries a formal positive charge on the ϵ amino group (Figure 3B). The new crystal contains two T4Dam molecules (not shown), one bound in the joint of two DNA duplexes, similar to the Dam C molecules in Figure 2B, and the other bound to the specific GATC site in the middle of one duplex, similar to the Dam E molecule in Figure 3A. The flipped Ade is surrounded (via hydrogen bonds, π stacking, and hydrophobic interactions) by amino acids belonging to the conserved catalytic D171-P-P-Y174 motif (Malone et al., 1995Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Structure-guided analysis reveals nine sequence motifs conserved among DNA amino-methyltransferases, and suggests a catalytic mechanism for these enzymes.J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), Y181, K11, and sinefungin (Figure 3C). The Ade N6-amino group that becomes methylated forms a pair of hydrogen bonds; one is to the side chain of D171, and the other is to the backbone carbonyl oxygen between the two proline residues P172 and P173. The target amino nitrogen is at a distance of less than 3 Å away from the sinefungin ϵ amino group, which is out of the plane of the constrained Ade base. This structural arrangement suggests that the target nitrogen lone pair is deconjugated and positioned for an inline direct methyl-group transfer as suggested for the TaqI DNA-adenine MTase (Goedecke et al., 2001Goedecke K. Pignot M. Goody R.S. Scheidig A.J. Weinhold E. Structure of the N6-adenine DNA methyltransferase M.TaqI in complex with DNA and a cofactor analog.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The ϵ amino group of sinefungin forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl of Y181, which in turn interacts with the main chain carbonyl of T8. The opposite face of the flipped Ade is in a face-to-face π stacking with the aromatic ring of Y174. EcoDam has considerable sequence similarity (25% identity) to T4Dam (Hattman et al., 1985Hattman S. Wilkinson J. Swinton D. Schlagman S. Macdonald P.M. Mosig G. Common evolutionary origin of the phage T4 dam and host Escherichia coli dam DNA-adenine methyltransferase genes.J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 932-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but has significantly higher sequence conservation with Dam enzymes from pathogenic bacteria. For example, the E. coli and S. typhimurium Dam proteins are 92% identical (differing at only 22 of 278 residues) and have no gaps in their alignment. Because of t"

Freshly ejaculated mammalian spermatozoa are not immediately capable offertilizing an oocyte. They acquire their fertilizing capacity by anill-defined process termed capacitation that normally occurs during migrationof the spermatozoa in the female genital tract(1Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology ofMamalian Reproduction. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 10Google Scholar). After capacitation, thespermatozoa are capable of undergoing acrosome reaction upon stimulation bythe zona pellucida(ZP) 1The abbreviations used are: ZP, zona pellucida; GdA, -F, and -S,glycodelins A, F, and S; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EBSS, Earle's balancedsalt solution; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CTC, chlortetracyclinestaining; Sp-cAMPS, Sp-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioatetriethylammonium salt. proteins(2Kopf G.S.

S.A. 1995; 92: 11039-11043Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus a tight control inthe timing of capacitation is important to ensure the occurrence ofappropriate sequence of events in the fertilization process. The male sexaccessory glands secrete complex mixture of proteins, glycoproteins, peptides,glycopeptides, and prostaglandins into seminal plasma(1Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology ofMamalian Reproduction. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 10Google Scholar). The seminal plasma iscapable of maintaining spermatozoa in an uncapacitated state. This isessential to ensure that capacitation would not start before migration of thespermatozoa to the fertilization site. In fact, seminal plasma can“decapacitate” capacitated spermatozoa(5Bedford J.M. Chang M.C. Am.J. Physiol. 1962; 202: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Glycodelin is a glycoprotein belonging to the lipocalin family(6Seppala M. Taylor R.N. Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Milgrom E. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 401-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1996; 271: 32159-32167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The immunosuppressiveproperties of the Lewisx and Lewisy epitopes in GdS maycontribute to the low immunogenicity of semen in women despite frequentexposure. In this report, we studied the role of GdS in regulating capacitation ofspermatozoa in view of three objectives. The first objective was toinvestigate the binding of GdS to spermatozoa, a prerequisite for the moleculeto exert its effect on spermatozoa. The second objective was to determine therelationship between GdS and capacitation. The third was to study themechanism of action of GdS on capacitation. In particular, we hypothesize thatGdS suppresses capacitation by reducing cholesterol efflux from spermatozoa.We also address the ability of GdS to suppress bovine serum albumin(BSA)-induced or cyclodextrin-induced cholesterol efflux and the effect of GdSon enzymes involved in the intracellular signaling pathways leading tocapacitation. Semen Samples—The Ethics Committee of the University of HongKong approved the research protocol. Only samples with normal semen parametersaccording to World Health Organization criteria(15Organization World Health LaboratoryManual for the Examination of Human Semen and Semen-Cervical MucusInteraction. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge,UK1999Google Scholar) were used. Spermatozoawere processed by using Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) density gradientcentrifugation as described previously(8Chiu P.C. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The processed spermatozoawere then resuspended in Earle's balanced salt solution supplemented with 0.3%BSA, 0.3 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.16 mm penicillin-G, 0.05mm streptomycin sulfate, and 14 mm sodium bicarbonate(EBSS/0.3%BSA) to a concentration of 2 × 106spermatozoa/ml. Purification of Glycodelin Isoforms—Glycodelin-A (GdA), -S(GdS), and -F (GdF) were purified from amniotic fluid, seminal plasma, andfollicular fluid respectively, using a monoclonal anti-glycodelin antibody(clone F43–7F9) Sepharose column as described(12Chiu P.C. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13570-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The bound glycodelin waseluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and dialyzed against 100 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). GdS was further purified by anion exchangechromatography as described(12Chiu P.C. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13570-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). GdF was purified fromhuman follicular fluid collected during oocyte retrieval from women undergoingassisted reproduction treatment in Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. Thefollicular fluid was passed successively through Hi-Trap blue, protein-G,ConA-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences), Amicon-10 concentrator (AmiconInc., Beverly, CA), Mono-Q, and Superose columns. The concentrations of thepurified glycodelin isoforms were determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assaykit. Deglycosylated GdS was prepared using the N-glycosidase Fdeglycosylation kit (Bio-Rad) as described(12Chiu P.C. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13570-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The deglycosylatedprotein was obtained after three successive protein precipitations,redissolved in 20 μl of PBS, and further purified by gel filtrationchromatography in a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences). The configuration ofthe glycodelin protein core is unlikely to be affected by the procedure,because deglycosylated glycodelin prepared as described possesses the sameimmunosuppressive activity as purified GdA(16Vigne J.L. Hornung D. Mueller M.D. Taylor R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17101-17105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and recombinantglycodelin from Escherichia coli without post-translationalmodifications (17Rachmilewitz J. Riely G.J. Tykocinski M.L. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover,thermodynamic evidence is available showing that the native folding ofglycodelin is not influenced by glycosylation(18Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Seppala M. Burova T.V. Choiset Y. Haertle T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The purity of thedeglycosylated protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and its concentration wasdetermined. Radioactively labeled GdS was prepared by mixing 50 μg of GdS in 0.02 mlof 0.05 m PBS (pH 7.4) with 2 mCi of sodium 125I (20μl, Amersham Biosciences) and freshly prepared chloramine T (100 μg in0.02 ml of 0.05 m PBS, pH 7.4) as described(12Chiu P.C.

The first radioactivepeak containing iodinated glycodelin was collected. Cervical Mucus Penetration—Human cervical mucus was not usedin this study for three reasons. First, cervical mucus contains glycodelin ofunknown isoform (19Pockley A.G. Barratt C.L. Bolton A.E. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1989; 43: 317-323PubMed Google Scholar). Second,the mucus is not homogeneous, because it may be contaminated with vaginalfluid. Third, its viscosity fluctuates widely depending on the day ofmenstrual cycle, making interpretation of data difficult. Two commerciallyavailable substitutes of cervical mucus were used. They were methylcellulosewith a viscosity of 4000 centipoises (MC4000, Aldrich) and hyaluronic acidfrom rooster comb with molecular mass range of 1–4 ×106 Da (Sigma). Previously, MC4000 and hyaluronic acid atconcentrations of 10 and 6 mg/ml, respectively, have been used successfully ascervical mucus surrogate (20Neuwinger J. Cooper T.G. Knuth U.A. Nieschlag E. Hum. Reprod. 1991; 6: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar,21Ivic A. Onyeaka H. Girling A. Brewis I.A. Ola B. Hammadieh N. Papaioannou S. Barratt C.L. Hum. Reprod. 2002; 17: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The substitutes weredissolved in EBSS/0.3% BSA. To perform the mucus penetration test, a capillary model similar to thatdescribed for studying the cumulus oophorus was used(22Hong S.J. Chiu P.C. Lee K.F. Tse J.M. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 19: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, a sterile glasscapillary (Microcaps, Drummund, PA) was successively filled with EBSS/0.3% BSAto a length of 5 cm (medium column), and the mucus was substituted to form amucus column of 5 cm in length. The end of the capillary with the mucus columnwas dipped into a 100-μl droplet of liquefied semen overlaid with mineraloil. Another capillary containing only EBSS/0.3% BSA served as a control.Spermatozoa were allowed to migrate through the mucus column into the mediumcolumn for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air before thecapillary was cut at position of 1 cm above the interface between the mucuscolumn and the medium column. Spermatozoa in the medium column were collected.Spermatozoa that had swum to the corresponding level in the control capillarywere used as controls. Determination of Acrosomal Reaction andCapacitation—fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Pisumsativum agglutinin (Sigma) and Hoechst staining techniques were used toevaluate the acrosomal status of the spermatozoa as described(23Chiu P.C. Ho P.C. Ng E.H. Yeung W.S. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 61: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The fluorescencepatterns of 300 spermatozoa in randomly selected fields were determined undera fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with 1000×magnification. A digital camera (COOLSNAP, Photometrics, AZ) and itsassociated software (Photometrics) were used to capture the image at roomtemperature. The filter set used for Hoechst staining consisted of anexcitation filter G365, a chromatic beam splitter FT395, and a barrier filterLP420, whereas that for fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled P. sativumagglutinin consisted of an excitation filter BP 450–490, a chromaticbeam splitter FT510, and a barrier filter LP520. Spermatozoa without stainingor those with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled P. sativumagglutinin staining confined to the equatorial segment only were considered asacrosome-reacted spermatozoa. Sperm capacitation was assayed by the chlortetracycline staining (CTC)method as described before(24Yao Y.Q. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S. Fertil. Steril. 1999; 71: 232-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The capacitation statusand acrosomal status of 200 spermatozoa were evaluated under a fluorescencemicroscope (Zeiss) at ×630 magnification with a filter set consisting ofan excitation filter BP 450–490, a chromatic beam splitter FT510, and abarrier filter LP520. Five CTC staining patterns of the sperm head wereidentified (25Perry R.L. Naeeni M. Barratt C.L. Warren M.A. Cooke I.D. Fertil. Steril. 1995; 64: 150-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CTC4 pattern(uniform head fluorescence) was the main capacitated pattern, and CTC5 pattern(decrease in or loss of uniform head fluorescence) was the acrosome-reactedpattern. The incidence of uncapacitated patterns (CTC1–3) decreased,whereas that of the CTC4 and CTC5 increased with the duration of capacitationof the spermatozoa (24Yao Y.Q. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S. Fertil. Steril. 1999; 71: 232-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Quantification of Cholesterol—Sperm cholesterol wasextracted by the method of Folch and coworkers(26Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) adapted for spermatozoa.Briefly, sperm suspension was washed thrice with PBS before vortexing with 8ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). Distilled water (1.5 ml) was then added.The mixture was vortexed again and allowed to stand at room temperature for 1h before centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Theupper layer was resuspended in 8 ml of chloroform:methanol: water (86:16:1,v/v) and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, afterwhich the chloroform extracts were pooled. The chloroform in the extract wasremoved in a rotary evaporator (Virtis, Gardiner, NY). The cholesterol contentin the dried extract was then determined by a cholesterol quantification kit(BioVision) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sperm cholesterolcontent was expressed as the amount of cholesterol per million ofspermatozoa. Determination of cAMP—Intracellular cAMP was extracted asdescribed by Calogero and coworkers(27Calogero A.E. Fishel S. Hall J. Ferrara E. Vicari E. Green S. Hunter A. Burrello N. Thornton S. D'Agata R. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 13: 911-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, spermatozoathat had been incubated for various durations were collected by centrifugationat 3,000 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold90% ethanol. After 30 min at –20 °C and 30 min at 4 °C, thesamples were centrifuged at 19,000 × g. The supernatants werecollected, and the ethanol was evaporated in a rotary evaporator. The driedpellets were stored at –20 °C until used. Intracellular cAMP wasthen determined using a non-radioactive cAMP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayKit (R&D, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer'sinstructions. Determination of Protein Kinase Activity—Spermatozoa werewashed thrice with PBS before solubilization by sonication in 100 μl ofhomogenizing buffer (20 mm PBS, pH 7.4, containing 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride, 0.1 mm vanadate, 1 mm MgCl2, 100mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100) for 15 min at 4 °C asdescribed (28Bajpai M. Doncel G.F. Reproduction. 2003; 126: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thesupernatant was obtained after centrifugation at 15,800 × g for30 min at 4 °C. The kinase activity in the supernatant was determined atroom temperature. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based tyrosine kinase(Molecular Probes) and protein kinase A (Calbiochem) assay kits were usedaccording to the manufacturers' instructions. Standard curves were run alongwith the test samples in each experiment. The protein content in the extractswas determined using commercial kit (Bio-Rad). One unit of protein kinase Aand tyrosine kinase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required tocatalyze the transfer of 1 pmol of phosphate to the substrates, RFARKGSLRQKNVand TSTEPQYQPGENL, respectively, in 1 min at 30 °C. Detection of Tyrosine Phosphorylation—Spermatozoa (2 ×106) were concentrated by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 2 min at room temperature and washed once in 0.5 ml of PBS atroom temperature. The sperm pellet was then resuspended in SDS sample bufferwithout mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. After a further centrifugationat 20,000 × g for 2 min, the supernatant was collected.2-Mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 5%. The sample wasboiled for 3 min before subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% gels in a Mini-PROTEIN3 Electrophoresis System (Bio-Rad). The gel was blotted on a polyvinylidenefluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for Western blot analysis using theChromogenic Western Blot Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer'sinstructions. Monoclonal primary antibody, clone 16F4 (Calbiochem) specificfor tyrosine phosphorylation was used. In addition, anti-tubulin antibody(Sigma) was used to reveal the equal sample loading of each lane. Equilibrium Binding of 125I-Glycodelin-S toSpermatozoa—Four semen samples were used (n = 4).Spermatozoa (200,000 in 100 μl of EBSS/0.3% BSA) were incubated withdifferent concentrations (0.16–4700 nm) of125I-GdS at 37 °C for 3 h. The binding was terminated by theaddition of 1.5 ml of ice-cold PBS followed by centrifugation at 300 g for 3min. The spermatozoa were further washed with fresh EBSS/0.3% BSA. Theradioactivity associated with the spermatozoa was counted with a gamma counter(Model 5500B, Beckman). Specific binding of GdS was determined by subtractingthe radioactivity bound on the spermatozoa in the presence of a 100-foldconcentration of unlabeled GdS from that in the absence of unlabeled protein(12Chiu P.C.

The determinations oftotal binding and nonspecific binding were done in triplicate. Binding Kinetics of 125I-Glycodelin-S onSpermatozoa—The association kinetics was studied by incubation of2000 nm of 125I-GdS with 200,000 spermatozoa in 100μl of EBSS/0.3% BSA (n = 4) at 37 °C for 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20,30, 60, 90, 120, 180, or 210 min(12Chiu P.C.

The concentration ofglycodelin used was the concentration for saturation binding (see below).Ice-cold buffer (1.5 ml) was added to terminate the binding. Nonspecificbinding was determined by the inclusion of 100-fold excess of unlabeled GdS.Bound and free glycodelin was separated by centrifugation at 300 ×g for 3 min. The sperm-bound radioactivity was measured. For thedissociation kinetics, 200,000 spermatozoa (n = 4) in 100 μl ofEBSS/0.3% BSA were incubated with 125I-GdS (2,000 nm) at37 °C for 60 min. 100-fold excess of unlabeled GdS was then added. After afurther incubation for 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, or 210 min,ice-cold buffer was added to stop the dissociation. The spermatozoa werewashed, and their associated radioactivity was determined. Specificity of Glycodelin-S Binding toSpermatozoa—Competition binding analysis was used to compare theaffinity of GdS binding sites for glycodelins and other lipocalins(12Chiu P.C. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13570-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The binding of 2000nm of 125I-GdS to 200,000 spermatozoa (n = 4)in 100 μl of EBSS/0.3% BSA was determined in the presence of an increasingconcentration (200, 2000, 5000, 0.2 × 105, and 1 ×105 nm) of unlabeled GdS, deglycosylated GdS, GdA, GdF,bovine β-lactoglobulin A (Sigma), and human retinol-binding protein(Sigma) or buffer alone at 37 °C for 360 min. The cell-bound radioactivitywas determined as described above. Each individual experiment was repeatedthrice. Immunofluorescence Staining of Glycodelin-S on HumanSpermatozoa—Liquefied semen was divided into three aliquots. Motilespermatozoa in one aliquot were collected by the swim-up technique(15Organization World Health LaboratoryManual for the Examination of Human Semen and Semen-Cervical MucusInteraction. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge,UK1999Google Scholar). Briefly, the semen wasgently overlaid with EBSS/0.3% BSA and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C.Spermatozoa that swam into the medium were collected. Spermatozoa in thesecond aliquot were collected after cervical mucus penetration as describedabove. Spermatozoa in the last aliquot were processed by Percoll gradientcentrifugation, followed by incubation with 1700 nm GdS ordeglycosylated GdS for 60 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. Theconcentration of GdS used was physiological in human seminal plasma(13Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Hyden-Granskog C. Magnus O. Seppala M. J. Androl. 2000; 21: 636-640PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonalanti-glycodelin antibody (clone F43–7F9) recognizing the protein core ofglycodelins was used to determine glycodelin immunoreactivity in thespermatozoa from the three aliquots as described(8Chiu P.C. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Lee K.F. Yeung W.S. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The staining was observedwith an excitation filter BP 450–490, chromatic beam splitter FT510, andbarrier filter LP520. Percoll processed spermatozoa without prior GdStreatment was used as the control. Effect of Glycodelin-S on Albumin andMethyl-β-cyclodextrin-induced Capacitation—Albuminacts as a cholesterol acceptor in the fluid of female reproductive tract,leading to sperm capacitation. Therefore, it has been widely used in media forcapacitation of spermatozoa. To study the effect of GdS on BSA-inducedcapacitation, Percoll processed spermatozoa (n = 5) were incubatedwith 0.3, 3, 30, 300, 900, 1500, 2000, and 3000 nm of GdS,deglycosylated GdS, GdA, or EBSS/0.3% BSA (control) at 37 °C under 5%CO2 in air for 60 min. Spermatozoa were then capacitated in EBSScontaining 3% BSA (EBSS/3% BSA) for 3 h under the same conditions beforewashing with EBSS/0.3% BSA. The capacitation status and cholesterol content ofspermatozoa from each group was then evaluated by the methods describedabove. The effect of GdS on cyclodextrin-induced capacitation was alsoinvestigated. β-Cyclodextrins are cyclic heptasaccharides that bindcholesterol and induce cholesterol efflux from cells. β-Cyclodextrinsstimulate sperm cholesterol efflux, capacitation, and ZP/progesterone-inducedacrosome reaction(29Choi Y.H.

The MβCD concentration used decreased sperm cholesterol efficientlyand had a minimal effect on sperm viability(30Cross N.L. Mol.

In this study, thepercentages of viable spermatozoa after incubation in MβCD ranged from92% to 99% as determined by the trypan blue exclusion test.

https://openalex.org/W2067786302,"DNA polymerase ζ (Pol ζ), a heterodimer of Rev3 and Rev7, is essential for DNA damage provoked mutagenesis in eukaryotes. DNA polymerases that function in a processive complex with the replication clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) have been shown to possess a close match to the consensus PCNA-binding motif QxxLxxFF. This consensus motif is lacking in either subunit of Pol ζ, yet its activity is stimulated by PCNA. In particular, translesion synthesis of UV damage-containing DNA is dramatically stimulated by PCNA such that translesion synthesis rates are comparable with replication rates by Pol ζ on undamaged DNA. PCNA also stimulated translesion synthesis of a model abasic site by Pol ζ. Efficient PCNA stimulation required that PCNA was prevented from sliding off the damage-containing model oligonucleotide template-primer through the use of biotin-streptavidin bumpers or other blocks. Under those experimental conditions, facile bypass of the abasic site was also detected by DNA polymerase δ or η (Rad30). The yeast DNA damage checkpoint clamp, consisting of Rad17, Mec3, and Ddc1, and an ortholog of human 9-1-1, has been implicated in damage-induced mutagenesis. However, this checkpoint clamp did not stimulate translesion synthesis by Pol ζ or by DNA polymerase δ.

During the S phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle, when DNA damage may form a block for the high fidelity DNA polymerases such as DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ) 1The abbreviations used are: Pol ζ, η, and δ, DNA polymerases ζ, η, and δ; TLS, translesion synthesis; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; RFC, replication factor C; Rad24-RFC, complex of Rfc2-5 and Rad24; Rad17/3/1, complex of Rad17, Mec3, and Ddc1; RPA, replication protein A; GST, glutathione S-transferase; nt, nucleotide. or Pol ε, several complex pathways are activated. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD6 and RAD18 genes control a bifurcating pathway that activates translesion synthesis (TLS) by error-prone DNA polymerases as well as a recombinational damage avoidance pathway (reviewed in Ref. 1Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Pol η is largely responsible for the relatively error-free bypass of cis-syn pyrimidine dimers in the template strand (2Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 3Gibbs P.E. McDonald J. Woodgate R. Lawrence C.W. Genetics. 2005; 169: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast, most other types of damage are bypassed by a set of error-prone DNA polymerases, and this bypass forms the molecular basis for damage-induced mutagenesis in the cell. One of these translesion polymerases is Pol ζ, a heterodimer of the Rev3 and Rev7 subunits, and the second enzyme is the Rev1 deoxycytidyl transferase (4Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C.

The replicative polymerase Pol δ has also been shown to be required for damage-induced mutagenesis, primarily through mutational studies of its Pol32 subunit (3Gibbs P.E. McDonald J. Woodgate R. Lawrence C.W. Genetics. 2005; 169: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 6Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol.

Consequently, a model has evolved in which Pol δ inserts a nucleotide across template damage, whereas Pol ζ and Rev1 are responsible for extension of that inserted nucleotide. In analogy to bacterial mutagenesis systems, this model has been named the two-polymerase model for TLS (9Woodgate R. Mutat.

Biochemically, this model has mainly been studied by measuring bypass rates and efficiencies of the catalytic cores of these enzymes without the inclusion of processivity factors such as the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (11Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 12Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Most DNA polymerases possess a unique consensus motif, QxxLxxFF, that is required for binding of the polymerase to PCNA and for PCNA-mediated processive DNA synthesis (reviewed in (13Majka J. Burgers P.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 227-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar)). For the Y-family DNA polymerases, Pol η, Pol ι, and Pol κ, that function in TLS, inactivation of this motif greatly reduced binding of the enzyme to PCNA and PCNA-dependent bypass of damage (14Haracska L.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48360-48368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In yeast, mutation of the consensus motif in Pol η results in a phenotype equivalent to that of a null mutant (15Haracska L. Kondratick C.M. Unk I. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This consensus motif cannot be found in either the Rev3 or the Rev7 subunit of Pol ζ possibly suggesting that this DNA polymerase does not interact with PCNA or that Pol ζ uses a different motif if it does interact with PCNA. Alternatively, Pol ζ may interact with a modified form of PCNA or with a different clamp altogether. Currently, no genetic data exist that establish a specific link between PCNA and Pol ζ. In response to DNA damage, PCNA is mono-ubiquitinated on Lys164 by Rad6/Rad18, which is the initiating step for post-replicative DNA repair (19Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 20Stelter P. Ulrich H.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). However, although ubiquitination of PCNA is essential for the initiation of this pathway, and therefore also for mutagenesis, its biochemical role remains obscure. Ubiquitinated PCNA may function in fork remodeling in preparation for TLS or as a chaperone to localize translesion polymerases to sites of damage (21Kannouche P.L. Wing J. Lehmann A.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). It is not known whether translesion synthesis by any of the TLS DNA polymerases requires ubiquitinated PCNA as a processivity factor. In fact, efficient TLS by several Y-class polymerases in a complex with native PCNA has been demonstrated (15Haracska L. Kondratick C.M. Unk I. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 16Haracska L. Johnson R.E. Unk I. Phillips B.B. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48360-48368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). DNA damage also activates the DNA damage checkpoint pathway that proceeds through a PCNA related heterotrimeric clamp, Rad17/Mec3/Ddc1 (Rad17/3/1), the ortholog of the human 9-1-1 complex, and the replication factor C (RFC)-related Rad24-RFC clamp loader (Rad17 in human; reviewed in Ref. 13Majka J. Burgers P.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 227-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In yeast, efficient mutagenesis depends on the Rad17/3/1 clamp and its loader. However, when irreparable damage is present in the cell because of the inactivation of nucleotide excision repair, mutagenesis is almost entirely dependent on an intact checkpoint clamp-clamp loader system (22Paulovich A.G. Armour C.D. Hartwell L.H. Genetics. 1998; 150: 75-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This dependence has raised the possibility that the Rad17/3/1 clamp may actually function as a processivity factor for a TLS polymerase such as Pol ζ. While studying the properties of Pol ζ during DNA damage bypass synthesis, we found, surprisingly, that the synthetic efficiency of Pol ζ is profoundly stimulated by PCNA when the template DNA contains damage. However, under the same conditions and with the same type of DNA damage, we failed to observe any indication for a functional interaction of the checkpoint clamp with Pol ζ. Our conclusion is that Pol ζ interacts with PCNA via an as yet unidentified motif. Strains and Plasmids—The protease deficient yeast strain BJ2168 (MATa: ura3–52, trp1–289, leu2–3,112, prb1–1122, prc1–407, pep4–3) was used for overproduction. Plasmids pWS1-REV7 and pGST-REV3 were a gift from Christopher Lawrence (4Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Removal of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) purification tag by thrombin in the purified Pol ζ preparation proceeded only up to ~50% completion, and therefore, the REV3 gene from the pGST-REV3 plasmid was re-cloned into the pRS426-GALGST vector (2 μm ori, URA3, GAL1–10) to yield a GST-REV3 fusion clone (pBL811) containing a PreScission protease cleavage site. RAD30 was similarly cloned into pRS425-GALGST (2 μm ori, LEU2, GAL1–10) to give plasmid pBL810. Plasmids and sequences are available upon request. DNA Substrates—All oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies and purified by polyacrylamide electrophoresis or high performance liquid chromatography before use. The 107-nt 5′- and 3′-biotinylated template Bio-V5 (Bio-5′-AGTGGGTTGGTTTTGGGT30-CTCCCTTCTTCTCCTCCCTCTCCCTTCCCT31-Bio) was prepared by hybridizing two half-oligonucleotides to a bridging primer C12 (5′-AGGGAAGGGAGAGGGAGGAGAAGAAGGGAG) followed by ligation with T4 DNA ligase and purification by preparative urea-PAGE. The template was primed with C12 labeled at the 5′-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP. After hybridization and priming, streptavidin was added in 2-fold molar excess. The DNA substrate was irradiated where indicated with 750 J/m2 UV light (254 nm) at 0 °C. Bio-V9 (Bio-5′-CCTTTGCGAATTCT25GCGGCTCCCTTCTTCTCCTCCCTCTCCCTTCCCT31-Bio) and Bio-V9AP1 (Bio-5′-CCTTTGCGAATTCT25GCG0CTCCCTTCTTCTCCTCCCTCTCCCTTCCCT31-3′-Bio), where the boldface “0” represents a tetrahydrofuran residue, were prepared in a similar fashion, primed with 5′-end-labeled C12-4 (5′-AGGGAAGGGAGAGGGAGGAGAAGAAG) and incubated with 2-fold molar excess streptavidin. Enzymes—Pol δ, Rad17/3/1, and Rad24-RFC were purified from yeast overproduction strains as described previously (23Burgers P.M. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 24Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Replication protein A (RPA), PCNA, and RFC were purified from Escherichia coli overproduction strains (25Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Gordenin D.A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1618-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Pol ζ and Pol η—BJ2168 containing pBL811 and pWS1-REV7 was grown as described previously. The cells (about 150 g wet weight) were resuspended in 30 ml of water and frozen as kernels in liquid nitrogen. They were disrupted in a blender with dry ice at final concentrations of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors as described (27Burgers P.M. Methods (Orlando). 1999; 18: 349-355Google Scholar). All further steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. Polymin P was added to the lysate to 0.4% and the mixture stirred for 10 min. After preclearing at 18,000 rpm for 30 min, 0.28 g/ml ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant. After stirring for 30 min, the precipitate was spun at 18,000 for 30 min. The pellet was dissolved in A0 buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% ampholytes 3.5–10, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) until the conductivity was equal to that of A500 (subscripts refer to mm NaCl in the buffers). After batch binding with 2 ml of glutathione-Sepharose beads equilibrated in A500 buffer, the beads were washed with 100 ml of A500, 20 ml of A500 + 1 mm ATP and 5 mm MgAc2, 20 ml of A500, and 30 ml of A300. The protein was eluted in A300 buffer containing 20 mm glutathione, pH = 8.0. Peak fractions were combined and digested overnight at 4 °C with 15 units of PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was diluted 2-fold with buffer B0 (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% ampholytes 3.5–10) and loaded onto a 1-ml heparin-agarose column in B150 + 0.5% Triton X-100. After washing the column with B300 + 0.5% Triton X-100, the protein was eluted with B750 buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Pol η was similarly overexpressed in yeast using plasmid pBL810. Extract preparation and purification were similar, except that 150 mm NaCl was used during extraction, and buffer A150 was used during glutathione elution from the glutathione-Sepharose column. After elution the protein was diluted with A0 to an equivalence of A80, loaded on a heparin agarose column, and eluted using a gradient from A80 to A500. DNA Replication/Bypass Assays—Standard 20-μl assays contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 8 mm MgAc2, 100 μm each dNTPs, 0.05 mm ATP, 100 fmol of DNA substrate, 1 pmol of RPA, 300 fmol PCNA or Rad17/3/1, 200 fmol of RFC or Rad24-RFC, respectively, and 100 mm NaCl (final concentration) unless otherwise indicated. The DNA was preincubated with RPA, PCNA, or Rad17/3/1 and RFC or Rad24-RFC, respectively, for 30 s at 30 °C, and the reaction was started by adding the relevant DNA polymerase (200 fmol). Incubations were at 30 °C for 5 min unless otherwise indicated. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 100 mm EDTA and 3% SDS. After incubating at 50 °C for 10 min, 45 μl of precipitation solution (2.5 m ammonium acetate, 20 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.05 mg/ml linear acrylamide (Ambion Technologies)) was added, followed by ethanol precipitation. Yields of pure DNA recovered by this method varied from 70 to 100%. Products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide 7 m urea gel. Gels were dried, quantitated by phosphoimaging analysis, and contrast enhanced for visualization purposes. Purification of Pol ζ—Purification and activity studies of Pol ζ showed a capricious behavior by this enzyme. Preparations with a consistent high specific activity could only be obtained when very high salt was included in the extraction buffer as described in the original publication (4Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). However, proteolytic removal of the GST purification tag by thrombin proceeded only up to ~50% completion regardless of the amount of thrombin added, suggesting the presence of two distinct enzyme populations. We, and others (4Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), have noticed that the enzyme still containing the GST tag had reduced enzymatic activity (data not shown). Therefore, we changed the thrombin-cleavable linker between GST and Rev3 with a linker that is cleaved by the rhinovirus protease (see “Materials and Methods”). This modification allowed complete removal of the GST tag and, therefore, a more homogeneous enzyme preparation. Final preparations of Pol ζ still contained 10–20% unidentified impurities and varied by about 2-fold in specific activity. We were concerned about the possibility that our preparations could be contaminated by Pol η because both enzymes function in the same pathway and might conceivably interact and therefore co-purify. However, Pol ζ overproduced in a RAD30-Δ strain had an activity comparable with that isolated from the isogenic wild-type strain (data not shown). In addition, preparations of Pol ζ lacking Rev7, because it was not overexpressed, were inactive (data not shown). Therefore, while we do not yet have a clear understanding of the variation in specific activity of Pol ζ, we are certain that all observed polymerase activity and the stimulation of this activity by PCNA originates from Rev3/Rev7. PCNA Stimulates Pol ζ-mediated TLS Past UV Damage—To study the role of PCNA in DNA damage translesion synthesis we used a linear oligonucleotide-based system. The template strand contains a stretch of 29 T residues for the facile generation of dimer-containing DNA by UV irradiation. As PCNA tends to slide off linear DNA substrates, we used an anchoring method with biotin-streptavidin blocks (Fig. 1A) (26Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Gordenin D.A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1618-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In our standard replication and translesion synthesis assays, the template-primer containing the streptavidin blocks was coated with the yeast single-stranded binding protein, RPA. Subsequently, PCNA was loaded by the clamp loader RFC, and DNA synthesis was initiated at t = 0 by the addition of the DNA polymerase. In this assay system, DNA replication by Pol δ was greatly stimulated by PCNA (Fig. 1B). The role of the biotinstreptavidin blocks and of RPA in maintaining PCNA on the DNA and promoting translesion synthesis will be discussed in more detail below. When this replication system was used to study DNA replication by Pol ζ, we measured no significant stimulation by PCNA in the generation of full-length replication products (Fig. 1B). Next, the poly(dT) template stretch was damaged by irradiation with 750 J/m2 of UV254 light which produces ~5 UV dimers per template molecule (28Rahn R.O. Landry L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 247: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Remarkably, whereas poor but detectable TLS by Pol ζ alone was observed, a dramatic stimulation of bypass synthesis was detected in the presence of PCNA, suggesting that PCNA can function as a processivity factor for Pol ζ on damaged DNA (Fig. 1C). In fact, DNA synthesis by the PCNA-Pol ζ complex past UV damage was nearly as efficient as that of undamaged DNA. Control reactions showed that PCNA had to be properly loaded onto the DNA as stimulation was abolished in the absence of RFC (see Fig. 3). Under the same conditions, PCNA-mediated TLS by Pol δ was not observed. The very small percentage (~3%) of completely replicated products synthesized by the PCNA-Pol δ complex on this substrate is consistent with the estimated percentage of DNA that escapes T-T dimerization. In support of this conclusion, the percentage of fully replicated products did not increase from 30 s to 5 min (Fig. 1C). The PCNA stimulation data for Pol ζ suggest that PCNA forms a complex with Pol ζ; however, its stimulatory effect was only observed on the UV-damaged template where barriers to elongation were present. We reasoned that if progression by Pol ζ on undamaged DNA were also impeded by unfavorable reaction conditions, this stimulation by PCNA should be observable. Indeed, when DNA binding by Pol ζ was reduced by increasing the salt concentration in the assay, the stabilizing influence of PCNA on processive DNA synthesis on undamaged DNA also became evident (Fig. 2). Only PCNA and Not the Checkpoint Clamp Stimulates Pol ζ— Given the known role of the DNA damage checkpoint system in mutagenesis, we asked whether the Rad17/3/1 checkpoint clamp would stimulate DNA synthesis by Pol δ or Pol ζ on undamaged or damaged DNA (22Paulovich A.G. Armour C.D. Hartwell L.H. Genetics. 1998; 150: 75-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Rad17/3/1 is efficiently loaded onto primed DNA by its loader Rad24-RFC; however, sliding of the clamp away from the loading site is slow, particularly when the single-stranded DNA is coated with RPA (24Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In addition, loading can occur at either the 3′- or the 5′-primer/template junction, and there is disagreement in the literature regarding the relative efficiency of these loading sites (reviewed in Ref. 13Majka J. Burgers P.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 227-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The substrate used in this study should permit clamp loading at either loading site. In the experiment in Fig. 3, the Rad17/3/1 clamp was loaded by the Rad24-RFC clamp loader and its effect on Pol δ- or Pol ζ-mediated DNA synthesis assessed. However, rather than stimulation, a minor inhibition was observed that was dependent on the presence of both Rad17/3/1 and Rad24-RFC (compare lanes 7 with lanes 6 and 12 for Pol δ and lanes 9 with lanes 8 and 15 for Pol ζ). As a similar pattern and degree of inhibition was also observed for Klenow DNA polymerase and for Sequenase (data not shown), we reason that the occupancy of the template-primer junction by the checkpoint clamp limits accessibility to all these DNA polymerases. Increased salt, up to 125 mm NaCl did not reveal a stimulatory function for the Rad17/3/1 checkpoint clamp (data not shown). Two recent studies with the human 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp, the ortholog of yeast Rad17/3/1, have indicated that 9-1-1 stimulates the activity of the FEN1 nuclease and of Pol β but not that of Pol δ (29Wang W. Brandt P. Rossi M.L. Lindsey-Boltz L. Podust V. Fanning E. Sancar A. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16762-16767Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Toueille M. El-Andaloussi N. Frouin I. Freire R. Funk D. Shevelev I. Friedrich-Heineken E. Villani G. Hottiger M.O. Hubscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, whether the 9-1-1 clamp needed to be loaded onto DNA by its loader was not investigated. It is also possible that the observed stimulation by 9-1-1 is mediated by direct protein-protein interactions and not through the function of 9-1-1 as a sliding clamp. Therefore, it is problematic to make a direct comparison between our results and those obtained in the human system. Bypass Synthesis of a Model Abasic Site—To determine which synthetic steps in TLS are accelerated by PCNA, we studied bypass of a unique model abasic site (Fig. 4A). The tetrahydrofuran moiety in the template DNA that we used qualitatively resembles an abasic site in vivo (31Otsuka C. Sanadai S. Hata Y. Okuto H. Noskov V.N. Loakes D. Negishi K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5129-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that full bypass synthesis of this model abasic site required the sequential action of Pol δ and Pol ζ; however, these studies were carried out in the absence of PCNA (12Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In other studies, it was shown that PCNA stimulated insertion by Pol η opposite the abasic site, although extension past the abasic site was not observed (15Haracska L. Kondratick C.M. Unk I. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Because in preliminary studies we observed efficient extension past the abasic site by PCNA-Pol η, we reexamined the experimental conditions that permit PCNA-dependent bypass by Pol δ, Pol η, and Pol ζ. In clamp-clamp loader studies of the bacteriophage T4 replication system on linear template-primer substrates, it was observed that biotin-streptavidin moieties serve as effective blocks at the ends of the primer-template, thus preventing sliding of the clamp away from the loading site and off the ends of the DNA (32Kaboord B.F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10881-10885Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Subsequent replication studies with yeast PCNA confirmed the necessity of these biotin-streptavidin bumpers, particularly when the PCNA-polymerase complex was stalled, e.g. at DNA nicks (26Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Gordenin D.A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1618-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We reasoned that such terminal bumpers might also be important when PCNA-polymerase complexes stall at sites of damage. On naked DNA, neither Pol δ nor Pol η bypassed the abasic site (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 7). Coating of the single-stranded template by RPA did not significantly alter the distribution of replication pause sites (data not shown). This result was expected because of the lack of significant secondary structure in the mostly poly(dT) template. In the presence of PCNA and RFC, but without streptavidin or RPA, we again detected no bypass of the abasic site by Pol δ nor by Pol η (lanes 6 and 11, respectively). However, either the addition of streptavidin or the addition of RPA resulted in PCNA-dependent bypass synthesis. RPA, which avidly binds the two poly(dT) tracts upstream and downstream of the primer, locks PCNA onto the DNA thereby allowing TLS to take place (lanes 5 and 10) (33Kim C. Snyder R.O. Wold M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3050-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 34Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34768-34775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As replication proceeds, the downstream RPA molecule is displaced and replication up to the end of the template takes place, particularly with Pol δ (lane 5). The presence of just the streptavidin moieties, without RPA, promoted efficient PCNA-dependent translesion synthesis (lanes 4 and 9). However, streptavidin sterically blocked Pol δ from replicating up to the end of the template (compare lane 5 with lane 4). No further significant improvement in bypass synthesis by Pol δ or Pol η was observed when, in addition to the streptavidin blocks, the DNA was also coated with RPA (lanes 3 and 8). In contrast to Pol δ and Pol η, Pol ζ catalyzed bypass past the abasic site even in the absence of PCNA (lane 12). However, PCNA strongly stimulated bypass provided either RPA or streptavidin or both were present to retain PCNA on the DNA. As with Pol δ, the biotin-streptavidin block prevented Pol ζ from replicating the final few template residues (compare lanes 13 and 14 with lanes 15 and 16). An analysis of the rate and processivity of DNA synthesis by Pol ζ on undamaged DNA showed that PCNA increased both primer recognition by Pol ζ, measured as percentage of primers elongated, and the processivity of the enzyme (Fig. 5A). When the template contained the abasic site, PCNA decreased pausing by Pol ζ at the –1 position and at the abasic site and promoted bypass synthesis (Fig. 5B). Does Pol ζ Have a Novel PCNA-binding Domain?—Pol ζ lacks an identifiable consensus PCNA-binding domain (QxxLxxFF) in either the Rev3 or Rev7 subunit. All Y-class DNA polymerases use this domain to interact with PCNA during TLS (reviewed in Refs. 1Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar and 13Majka J. Burgers P.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 227-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). However, Pol δ has multiple domains for interaction with PCNA. One of these is a consensus domain in the third subunit which has an auxiliary function during DNA replication (8Johansson E. Garg P. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1907-1915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 35Bermudez V.P. MacNeill S.A. Tappin I. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36853-36862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A precise knowledge of the PCNA interaction domains in the catalytic and/or second subunit is still lacking although certain regions in these subunits have been implicated by peptide mapping studies (36Zhang P. Mo J.Y. Perez A. Leon A. Liu L. Mazloum N. Xu H. Lee M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26647-26653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 37Lu X. Tan C.K. Zhou J.Q. You M. Carastro L.M. Downey K.M. So A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24340-24345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A sequence comparison analysis of six evolutionarily diverse Rev3 orthologs revealed several conserved motifs outside of the core polymerase domains; however, none of these motifs were present in a similar alignment of Pol δ catalytic subunit sequences. Therefore, it appears that not even one of these putative interaction domains determined by peptide binding studies is present in Pol ζ. Conclusions—This study not only underscores the importance of studying TLS under proper conditions with the necessary accessory factors present but also highlights the importance of the experimental approach that needs to be used to study PCNA-dependent TLS on model linear oligonucleotide substrates. In particular, appropriate measures need to be taken to stabilize the PCNA-polymerase complex on the linear DNA and to prevent it from sliding off. In our study, RPA served this function with some efficiency, mainly because of the presence of strong RPA-binding sites both upstream and downstream of the primer terminus. However, biotin-streptavidin blocks on both sides provide a superior stability (Fig. 4). Under those conditions, we were able to measure complete bypass synthesis of an abasic site by Pol δ or by Pol η, although only the latter enzyme was able to bypass UV-damage. In contrast, Pol ζ alone could bypass both types of damage, but both the rate and efficiency of bypass were strongly enhanced by PCNA. The inference that the PCNA-Pol ζ interaction involves a novel motif raises the possibility that even more proteins involved in DNA metabolism than currently known may physically and functionally interact with PCNA.

https://openalex.org/W2137908831,"We investigated developmental commitment during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. Sporulation is initiated by nutrient limitation and involves division of the developing cell into two progeny, the forespore and the mother cell, with different fates. Differentiation becomes irreversible following division when neither the forespore nor the mother cell can resume growth when provided with nutrients. We show that commitment is governed by the transcription factors sigma(F) and sigma(E), which are activated in the forespore and the mother cell, respectively. We further show that commitment involves spoIIQ, which is under the control of sigma(F), and spoIIP, which is under the control of both sigma(F) and sigma(E). In the presence of nutrients, the forespore can exhibit rodlike, longitudinal growth when SpoIIQ and SpoIIP are absent, whereas the mother cell can do so when SpoIIP alone is absent. Thus, developmental commitment of this single-celled organism, like that of the cells of complex, multicellular organisms, ensures that differentiation is maintained despite changes in the extracellular milieu."

During the first few trials, PN response intensity decreases, while spike time precision increases, and coherent oscillations, absent at first, quickly emerge. We examined this “fast odor learning” with a realistic computational model of the AL. Activity-dependent facilitation of AL inhibitory synapses was sufficient to simulate physiological recordings of fast learning. In addition, in experiments with noisy inputs, a network including synaptic facilitation of both inhibition and excitation responded with reliable spatiotemporal patterns from trial to trial despite the noise.

Thus, our study suggests that fast olfactory learning results from stimulus-specific, activity-dependent synaptic facilitation and may improve the signal-to-noise ratio for repeatedly encountered odor stimuli. Locust antennal lobe (AL) responses to odor presentations are oscillatory and temporally structured (Laurent and Davidowitz, 1994Laurent G. Davidowitz H. Encoding of olfactory information with oscillating neural assemblies.Science. 1994; 265: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). AL oscillations have been shown to play an important role for signal decoding by downstream networks (Perez-Orive et al., 2004Perez-Orive J. Bazhenov M. Laurent G. Intrinsic and circuit properties favor coincidence detection for decoding oscillatory input.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6037-6047Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, Perez-Orive et al., 2002Perez-Orive J. Mazor O. Turner G.C. Cassenaer S. Wilson R.I. Laurent G.

Disrupting AL oscillations by application of the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin leads to a loss of information about odors in mushroom body neurons (MacLeod et al., 1998MacLeod K. Backer A. Laurent G. Who reads temporal information contained across synchronized and oscillatory spike trains?.Nature. 1998; 395: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, Perez-Orive et al., 2004Perez-Orive J.

Behavioral experiments with honeybees show that oscillatory synchronization of AL neurons is needed for fine odor discrimination (Hosler et al., 2000Hosler J.S. Buxton K.L. Smith B.H.

Impaired odour discrimination on desynchronization of odour-encoding neural assemblies.Nature. 1997; 390: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Similarly, suppressing synchronous oscillations in the Limax procerebral lobe by L-NAME (Teyke and Gelperin, 1999Teyke T. Gelperin A. Olfactory oscillations augment odor discrimination not odor identification by Limax CNS.Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) reduced its ability to discriminate between similar odorants. An interesting aspect of olfaction is that stimuli tend to repeat. Turbulent media (air or water) break up continuous streams of odorant into discrete filaments that pass separately and repeatedly over olfactory receptors (Murlis et al., 1992Murlis J. Elkington J.S. Carde R.T. Odor plumes and how insects use them.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1992; 37: 505-532Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar); in addition, iterative behaviors such as sniffing (in vertebrates [Gray and Skinner, 1988Gray C.M. Skinner J.E. Centrifugal regulation of neuronal activity in the olfactory bulb of the waking rabbit as revealed by reversible cryogenic blockade.Exp. Brain Res. 1988; 69: 378-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar]) and antennal flicking (in insects and other arthropods [Mellon, 1997Mellon D. Physiological characterization of antennular flicking reflexes in the crayfish.J. Comp. Physiol. [A]. 1997; 180: 553-565Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar]) ensure repeated odor encounters, even in the absence of turbulence (as when odor sources are nearby). Olfactory systems appear to exploit this feature of olfactory stimuli: in insects and vertebrates, odor responses in first-order olfactory interneurons can change dramatically over the course of repeated stimuli, independent of sensory adaptation (Stopfer and Laurent, 1999Stopfer M. Laurent G. Short-term memory in olfactory network dynamics.Nature. 1999; 402: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, Vanderwolf and Zibrowski, 2001Vanderwolf C.H. Zibrowski E.M. Pyriform cortex beta-waves: odor-specific sensitization following repeated olfactory stimulation.Brain Res. 2001; 892: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the locust AL, projection neurons (PNs) respond to repeated odor trials with decreasing intensity (fewer action potentials), but increasing coherence and precision: PN action potentials become more precisely aligned with those in other PNs, evident in paired intracellular and multiunit recordings and in the temporal evolution of oscillatory local field potentials (LFPs) (Stopfer and Laurent, 1999Stopfer M. Laurent G. Short-term memory in olfactory network dynamics.Nature. 1999; 402: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Moreover, the coherent state carries more stimulus-related information (MacLeod et al., 1998MacLeod K. Backer A. Laurent G. Who reads temporal information contained across synchronized and oscillatory spike trains?.Nature. 1998; 395: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, Stopfer et al., 1997Stopfer M. Bhagavan S. Smith B.H. Laurent G. Impaired odour discrimination on desynchronization of odour-encoding neural assemblies.Nature. 1997; 390: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). These short-lived, activity-dependent changes occur largely within the circuitry of the AL and are stimulus specific: changes induced by one odorant are not evident when a novel odorant is introduced, unless the novel odorant is chemically similar to the original one (Stopfer and Laurent, 1999Stopfer M. Laurent G. Short-term memory in olfactory network dynamics.Nature. 1999; 402: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Because it is difficult to make recordings from synaptically connected pairs of AL interneurons, the mechanisms underlying this plasticity have yet to be characterized. Here, in a realistic computational model of the AL (Bazhenov et al., 2001aBazhenov M. Stopfer M. Rabinovich M. Abarbanel H.D. Sejnowski T.J. Laurent G. Model of cellular and network mechanisms for odor-evoked temporal patterning in the locust antennal lobe.Neuron. 2001; 30: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, Bazhenov et al., 2001bBazhenov M.

Model of transient oscillatory synchronization in the locust antennal lobe.Neuron. 2001; 30: 553-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we test ideas about the sites and potential functions of this plasticity. It has been proposed that this plasticity endows a single AL circuit with the ability to perform two apparently opposing functions: first, signal the presence of a novel stimulus with a strong burst of activity (the system at rest is at peak sensitivity); and later, if the stimulus persists (and is thus potentially important), provide a more precise, discriminating description (Stopfer and Laurent, 1999Stopfer M. Laurent G. Short-term memory in olfactory network dynamics.Nature. 1999; 402: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). With our model, we propose and test an additional potential benefit of this plasticity: that it serves to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in responses elicited by repeated stimuli. The results lead to the prediction that fast odor learning is caused by activity-dependent facilitation of excitatory as well as fast and slow inhibitory synapses in the AL. Recordings from the locust AL during presentations of novel odors demonstrated two important features used to constrain the model. First, the LFP oscillates very little, if at all, during the first one or two trials with a new odor; rather, 20 Hz oscillations appear gradually over the first several trials. Second, the average number of spikes produced by PNs is greatly decreased during repetitive stimulation with the same odor; the slow patterning that is typical of PN responses is not always evident during the first trials (Stopfer and Laurent, 1999Stopfer M. Laurent G. Short-term memory in olfactory network dynamics.Nature. 1999; 402: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Where might this plasticity reside? PN oscillatory coherence can be abolished by the application of picrotoxin to the AL (MacLeod and Laurent, 1996MacLeod K. Laurent G. Distinct mechanisms for synchronization and temporal patterning of odor-encoding neural assemblies.Science. 1996; 274: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar); this suggests that the strength of fast GABAergic synapses of LNs onto PNs might be low during the first few trials with a novel odor and gradually increase during subsequent presentations of the same odor. Application of picrotoxin, however, does not alter the average number of PN spikes (MacLeod et al., 1998MacLeod K. Backer A. Laurent G. Who reads temporal information contained across synchronized and oscillatory spike trains?.Nature. 1998; 395: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, MacLeod and Laurent, 1996MacLeod K. Laurent G. Distinct mechanisms for synchronization and temporal patterning of odor-encoding neural assemblies.Science. 1996; 274: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, our previous modeling studies found that blocking fast GABAA-mediated inhibition in the AL model resulted in a loss of synchrony but did not change the average PN firing rate; in fact, the slow temporal structure of PN firing remained intact (Bazhenov et al., 2001aBazhenov M. Stopfer M. Rabinovich M. Abarbanel H.D. Sejnowski T.J. Laurent G. Model of cellular and network mechanisms for odor-evoked temporal patterning in the locust antennal lobe.Neuron. 2001; 30: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This suggests that both fast-type receptors and slow inhibitory receptors controlling the slow temporal structure and rate of PN output might be modulated during repeated odor encounters. To test these hypotheses, we prepared three versions of a realistic computational model of the AL (see Figure 1): one with fixed synaptic weights, one in which only fast GABAA receptors could facilitate, and one in which both fast and slow inhibitory receptors could facilitate (see Experimental Procedures). In facilitating models, the initial strengths of the inhibitory receptors were set to be too weak to maintain synchronous PN oscillations. Figure 2 shows the average network response (LFP) and membrane potentials for one PN and one LN from the network during the first five trials with an odor stimulus. The model with fixed, strong synapses responded with relatively consistent patterns in all five trials (Figure 2A). The model with initially weak, facilitating fast GABAA receptors (Figure 2B) displayed strong onset responses followed by reduced network activity, caused by the increasing activation of slow inhibitory receptors. Although oscillatory synchrony increased, as observed in vivo, the average number of PN spikes changed very little (less than 30%) during subsequent trials with the same odor, inconsistent with experimental results. These results are quantified in Figure 3B (left).Figure 2Evolution of the AL Responses over Repeated Stimulus PresentationsShow full caption(A) No plasticity.(B) Plasticity in fast GABAA-type synapses only.(C) Plasticity in both fast GABAA-type and slow GABAB-type synapses.

(Right) Oscillatory (∼26 Hz) component of the power spectrum increased during the first three trials. Figure 2C illustrates the results obtained when both fast and slow inhibition could facilitate. This network started with intense PN responses only partially reduced by initially weak slow inhibition. PN firing rates were high during the first few trials and decreased over subsequent trials, a result of the facilitation of slow inhibition (see Figure 3B, left). Figure 2D shows experimental results from locust illustrating both the increase in oscillatory power and the decrease in spike count over the first few trials. Thus, our model suggests that facilitation of both fast and slow inhibitions during repetitive trials is needed to account for our experimental results. In the model with facilitating fast and slow inhibition, as in the locust, the power of AL 25–30 Hz oscillations greatly increased during the first few presentations of a stimulus (Figure 3A). Spectral analysis of the LFP produced by the model (Figure 3B, right) showed that 25–30 Hz oscillatory power increased most noticeably within the first three trials. The number of stimulus-induced PN spikes also changed most noticeably during these first three trials (Figure 3B, left). The number of trials required to attain an oscillatory response depended on the rate of facilitation. Figure 4 shows the distribution of synaptic weights for fast and slow LN-PN synapses over the model network for each trial. Most of the changes occurred during the first two to three trials, and the synaptic weight distribution became approximately stationary after seven to eight trials. This figure also shows that only about 40% of the inhibitory synapses in the network became facilitated during stimulation: these were the synapses activated by the stimulus; those not activated remained weak. Similar changes occurred for inhibitory synapses between LNs (data not shown). In vivo experiments in locusts showed that a novel odorant does not elicit an oscillatory response even when it follows a coherence-inducing series of presentations of a different odor. If the two odors are chemically similar, however, some carryover will occur (Stopfer and Laurent, 1999Stopfer M. Laurent G. Short-term memory in olfactory network dynamics.Nature. 1999; 402: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To examine this phenomenon with our model, we used two sets of inputs. “Chemically similar” inputs were simulated by activating significantly overlapping (∼50%) sets of PNs and LNs from the network; “chemically distinct” stimuli were simulated by activating nonoverlapping subsets of neurons. Figure 5 shows examples of three different odors where odors A and B were distinct, and odors B and C were similar. After the first few trials with odor A, the network response became oscillatory (Figure 5A), the number of PN spikes decreased by more than 50% (Figure 5B, left), and the integrated power of LFP oscillations (20–30 Hz) increased significantly (Figure 5B, right). After nine trials with odor A, the stimulus was changed to odor B. Because this input was different from A, it activated a different subset of inhibitory synapses between LNs and PNs. These synapses were untrained by odor A, therefore the network displayed naive responses to the first few trials with B. PN spike count and integrated LFP power also changed (Figure 5B). Finally, C was introduced after nine trials with B. Because C is similar to B, changes were less dramatic, and trial 1 displayed very strong oscillations immediately (Figure 5A); PN spike count and integrated LFP power changed little between the last trial with B and the first trial with C. These results are in a good agreement with experimental data from locust (Figure 5C). In this example, A (pentanol) and B (hexanol) are related, while C (geraniol) is distinct from both A and B. Note the carryover from A to B and the naive LFP in trial 1 with C. When a number of different stimuli were presented in sequence to the model network, coherence of the resulting responses depended on the history of stimulation. Depending upon the recovery time to naive synaptic weights, a series of sufficiently different stimuli could saturate the network, such that eventually, any new input immediately produced an oscillatory response (data not shown). This saturation diminished when the interval between stimulus sets increased, so that synaptic weights could decay to initial values between stimuli. In vivo, the half-time for recovery from fast learning plasticity is about 4–6 min (Stopfer and Laurent, 1999Stopfer M. Laurent G. Short-term memory in olfactory network dynamics.Nature. 1999; 402: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The processing of olfactory stimuli includes two opposing goals: one is to accurately distinguish different but related odors; the other is to correctly classify noisy instances of the same stimulus. Spatiotemporal representation may increase the sensitivity and capacity of the AL, but they might decrease reliability when faced with noise (e.g., variations of the intensity of activation, identities of activated PNs, or transient or unreliable “background” stimuli). Could fast learning in the AL serve to enhance the reliability of odor identification? During repeated odor presentations, the effects of noise would be minimized, since its contribution would be different on each trial, mainly affecting untrained, weak synapses. Thus, fast learning might enable repetitive presentations of a stimulus in a noisy environment to create a pattern of activity similar to that evoked by repetitive presentations of a noise-free stimulus. We used the AL model with intact synaptic plasticity to test this idea. To a set of neurons representing a “pure” and consistent stimulus (33% of the population; see Figure 1), for each trial, we added a small, variable subset (up to 5% of the total population, 3% in most simulations) of LNs, or of LNs and PNs, as “noise.” These additional neurons were selected randomly every 50 ms. Since we were using a version of the model in which only inhibitory synapses undergo facilitation, we predicted that “noise reduction” should work better when only the LN input contains noise. We start with this unrealistic but simple case, because it allows us to better explore the proposed hypotheses. We will then consider the more realistic case of noisy activity in both LNs and PNs. We quantified response reliability by comparing the firing phase of PN spikes in consecutive trials. For each cycle i of the LFP oscillation, the phase of each PN spike, pi(k,l) (where k is trial number and l is cell number) was measured relative to the nearest LFP peak (−0.5 < pi < 0.5; pi = 0 corresponds to the ith peak of LFP; pi = ±0.5 corresponds to the nearest LFP minima). Ten trials with different input noise were simulated, and the difference between phase distributions of each two consecutive trials [Δpi(k,l) = pi(k,l) − pi(k − 1,l)] was calculated. Figure 6 shows the results (first four cycles of LFP oscillations) when only LN input contained noise. Red pixels indicate neurons where spike phase changed greatly between trials (phase shift was more than 10% of the period of LFP oscillations), and light blue pixels indicate the neurons with only small changes in spike phases (phase shift was less than 10% of the period of LFP oscillations). Results show that the network with synaptic plasticity responded with much more consistent spatiotemporal patterns from trial to trial despite random input fluctuations. The network lacking fast learning, however, responded with patterns that changed markedly between trials, reflecting the input variability. This difference between the two models was most prominent during the first 200–250 ms of odor stimulation and became less significant later. After the fourth odor-induced oscillatory cycle, across-trial variability was slightly increased in the model that included plasticity but was reduced in the model lacking plasticity (see Figure 6). This change of correlation between response patterns over the odor duration is similar to dynamic odor decorrelation found in the experiments with zebrafish (Friedrich et al., 2004Friedrich R.W. Habermann C.J. Laurent G. Multiplexing using synchrony in the zebrafish olfactory bulb.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 862-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, Friedrich and Laurent, 2001Friedrich R.W. Laurent G. Dynamic optimization of odor representations by slow temporal patterning of mitral cell activity.Science. 2001; 291: 889-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To quantify the effect of plasticity, the difference between PN spike phases at nearby trials with noise [Δpi(k,l) as shown in Figure 6] was first averaged across all PNs and across all trial pairs [<Δpi(k,l)>k,l]. This experiment was repeated independently N = 10 times with different noise; the average phase difference [<Δpi(k,l)>k,l,N] was plotted versus cycle number i (Figure 7A , left). During the first three cycles in the network with plasticity, this amount of variability was greatly reduced, to about 30% of that for the AL model with fixed synapses. In both models, average difference started to increase at cycle 4 and was saturated near the end of the trial (cycles 8 to 9). However, when we added noise to the inputs of both PNs and LNs, the result was quite different. Since excitatory synapses were fixed in the model, plasticity could not compensate for the variations of PN activity; each PN activated by random input noise could affect activity of all its postsynaptic PNs and LNs, thus changing the network activity (Figure 7A, right). Figure 7B presents another measure of the reliability of PN responses. PN spikes were counted in 10 ms bins. For each bin, the standard deviation of PN spikes across ten trials with noisy stimuli was calculated and then averaged for all PNs in the network (<STD>l). The average STD is plotted versus time (Figure 7B, top left). Again, the network with plasticity produced more reliable responses. We repeated this experiment independently N = 10 times, each with different noise. Average STD was calculated (<STD>l,N), and the result obtained with plasticity was subtracted from the result obtained without plasticity (<STD>l,NNoPlasticity − <STD>l,NOnlyGABA) (see Figure 7B, bottom left). This analysis indicates consistently higher variability (observed through all cycles) of spike count in the model without plasticity. This was true, however, when noise was provided to the LN input only. The models performed similarly when noise was delivered to both LN and PN inputs (Figure 7B, right). In an effort to bring the results of the model in line with experimental observations, we next examined a network in which all intrinsic synapses, excitatory as well as inhibitory, could undergo plasticity. Afferent synapses delivering odor input to the AL network remained fixed. Figure 8 presents results for an AL model identical to the previous one except that excitatory PN-PN and PN-LN synapses were no longer fixed. Their initial values were set to 33% of the weights of the previous model, and the rate of facilitation was chosen such that they saturated at the same rate as in the previous model, after a few trials. Figure 8A shows details of LFP evolution during first five trials. As in the previous models (Figure 3A), the network responded with almost no oscillations during the first trial but began to display strong oscillatory responses after the first few stimulus presentations. The main difference in LFP spectral content was a reduction in the initial (onset) response in the new model, explained by the initially lower synaptic weights between PNs. The number of stimulus-elicited PN spikes decreased during first few trials in the full plasticity model and for trial 1 was similar to that in the model with GABAA plasticity only (compare Figure 3, Figure 8). However, asymptotic behavior in the model with full plasticity was the same as for the model with GABAA and GABAB plasticity. This suggests that excitatory and slow inhibitory couplings can balance each other with respect to PN spike count during early trials. LFP oscillatory power increased noticeably within the first three trials (see Figure 8B, inset). The average difference between phases of PN spikes in consecutive trials is shown in Figure 7C (left), and the average STD of PN spikes counted in 10 ms bins for ten trials is presented in Figure 7C (right). Figure 8C presents the same phase analysis as shown in Figure 6, but with noise included in both PN and LN inputs. It shows that trial-to-trial PN spiking was much more reliable in the full plasticity model compared to the model with inhibitory plasticity only. The responses in these experiments with noise added to the input of both LNs and PNs were at least as reliable as in simulations in which only LN input included noise (compare Figure 7C with Figures 7A and 7B, left). All these results indicate strongly enhanced reliability with all synapses undergoing activity-dependent facilitation for stimuli with random noise. Because of medium turbulence and olfactory behaviors, odor stimuli often reach olfactory receptors as brief, intermittent pulses. Intracellular and LFP recordings in the locust AL have revealed stimulus-dependent changes in PN and LN response patterns over repeated odor presentations (Stopfer and Laurent, 1999Stopfer M. Laurent G. Short-term memory in olfactory network dynamics.Nature. 1999; 402: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). When a novel stimulus was presented, the PN ensemble responded with intense and nonsynchronized bursts of spikes. After four to six presentations, however, PN response intensity decreased, while spike time precision increased, and coherent network oscillations emerged. Training with one odor did not affect the AL response for a different odor, suggesting that the modification during training was stimulus specific. Here we used computer simulations to test two hypotheses: (1) that a specific form of synaptic plasticity in the AL provides a mechanism for activity-dependent changes of the AL responses in locust; and (2) that these modifications might serve to improve encoding reliability for repeatedly encountered stimuli. Facilitation of activated fast GABAergic synapses between LNs and PNs in the AL network was sufficient to explain the appearance of PN oscillatory synchronization after the first three to four trials. To account for the experimentally observed decrease in PN spike count during the first few trials, we found that facilitation of the slow inhibitory synapses had to be implemented in the model. Synaptic weights changed mainly during the first three to four trials and completely stabilized after seven to eight trials. Importantly, only a fraction (about 40%) of synapses, those activated by the odorant, were modified following stimulation. Therefore, when the odor used for training was replaced with a different odor, a different set of synapses became active, and the network displayed its naive response again. This result is also in good agreement with experimental findings (Stopfer and Laurent, 1999Stopfer M. Laurent G. Short-term memory in olfactory network dynamics.Nature. 1999; 402: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In our model, plasticity took the form of facilitation of reciprocal connections among LNs and PNs. Could other forms of plasticity such as depression of excitatory or inhibitory synapses contribute as well? Our attempts to replicate experimental results using several such configurations were unsuccessful. This was expected, because the importance of the fast GABAergic connections within the AL for creating synchronized PN oscillations has been shown in several experimental (MacLeod et al., 1998MacLeod K.

Laurent G. Short-term memory in olfactory network dynamics.Nature. 1999; 402: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Activation of Ca2+ conductances in AL neurons (or in other locust neurons [Laurent et al., 1993Laurent G. Seymour-Laurent K.J. Johnson K. Dendritic excitability and a voltage-gated calcium current in locust nonspiking local interneurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 69: 1484-1498PubMed Google Scholar]) followed by increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration could control these synaptic modifications. It has been proposed that activity-dependent changes of the AL responses could be important for odor detection and recognition. An initially intense but asynchronous response could provide strong input to and response from the mushroom body (Perez-Orive et al., 2004Perez-Orive J. Bazhenov M. Laurent G. Intrinsic and circuit properties favor coincidence detection for decoding oscillatory input.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6037-6047Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and lateral protocerebrum targets, thus underlying rapid detection of novel odorants; more precise PN responses to subsequent samplings would provide a finer characterization (Stopfer and Laurent, 1999Stopfer M. Laurent G. Short-term memory in olfactory network dynamics.Nature. 1999; 402: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Here, we propose an additional function for fast learning in AL responses—resistance to noise with a resulting increase in the reliability of responses to repeatedly encountered odors. When the input to the AL contains noise (due either to stimulus fluctuations or to noise in the receptor array), a slightly different subset of PNs is activated at each trial with the same odor; therefore, the spatiotemporal patterns of PN activation will be somewhat different each time. We show here that input-specific plasticity within AL synaptic interconnections can substantially reduce the effects of noise, exploiting the fact that noise differs from one trial to the next and thus, each time, activates untrained (weak) synapses. Plasticity at inhibitory synapses only was sufficient to improve the reliability of PN responses against noisy input to LNs. To diminish the effect of noise present in PN inputs also, plasticity in excitatory synapses within the AL network was required as well. This additional plasticity had a small effect on the temporal evolution of AL response patterns during repetitive odor presentations but provided a greater increase in the reliability of PN responses for noisy input. Synaptic plasticity within the locust AL has yet to be characterized. Therefore, our work with realistic models including noise leads us to predict that both excitatory and inhibitory synapses undergo activity-dependent and input-specific facilitation. In the locust AL, relatively high odor concentrations elicit stronger and more coherent oscillations (Stopfer et al., 2003Stopfer M. Jayaraman V. Laurent G. Intensity versus identity coding in an olfactory system.Neuron. 2003; 39: 991-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Our modeling study suggests that strong and synchronized oscillations in the AL induced by high-intensity stimulation might facilitate both excitatory and inhibitory synapses between LNs and PNs. If so, these changes could facilitate the generation of oscillations in the AL upon subsequent odor stimulation, thus potentially increasing AL response reliability for low concentrations of odors previously encountered at high concentrations. The same odor presented in higher concentrations activates larger sets of glomeruli (see, for example, Friedrich and Korsching, 1997Friedrich R.W. Korsching S.I.

Two-photon calcium imaging reveals an odor-evoked map of activity in the fly brain.Cell. 2003; 112: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). This suggests that training at a higher concentration of a particular odor will facilitate a larger set of synapses. When another, different stimulus is presented right after one that was applied at higher concentration during learning, we would expect to find an oscillatory response starting from the first trial. The outcome of these experiments will depend, however, on the extent of overlap between sets of intrinsic AL synapses involved in the AL responses for different odors and different odor concentrations. Our study indicates that synaptic plasticity in the AL can fine tune and optimize network structure to increase the information content and reliability of odor representations for repeatedly encountered odors, as occurs in natural plumes. The absence of fast LN-mediated inhibition during presentations of novel odors prevents PNs from synchronizing but, at the same time, produces more intense bursts of spikes during the initial phase of the response, leading to potentially broader but less specific responses in the mushroom body. A buildup of fast inhibition enables AL oscillations, thus improving odor discrimination. Facilitation of both inhibition and excitation endows the network with a resistance to noise, insuring more reliable responses in the AL, and presumably, in downstream targets, to repeated odors."

Analysis of the folding kinetics and correlation with thethree-dimensional structure add new evidence for the validity of a consensusfolding mechanism in the cytochrome c family. As for any other chemical process, a meaningful description of the proteinfolding mechanism demands careful analysis of its kinetics. A wealth ofexperimental studies has shown that proteins may fold through processes ofdifferent complexity, with or without partially folded intermediate states(1Daggett V. Fersht A.R. Nat.Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Evidence for foldingintermediates is usually provided by the observation of complex multiphasictime courses. Intermediate states can either accumulate in the time windowaccessible to classical stopped-flow instruments (ms) or be detected in asub-ms time range by ultrarapid mixing(2Akiyama S. Takahashi S.

However, simple kinetics isnot always a sufficient indication of a two-state mechanism, because hiddenintermediates are sometimes revealed by more sophisticated kineticexperiments, which may allow assignment of their mechanistic significance. To highlight general rules in protein folding, an increasingly employedstrategy is to compare the folding mechanism of different proteins belongingto the same fold family. From the few examples available to date, it emergesthat native state topology plays a dominant role in determining the foldingprocess, because the structure of the transition state is generally conservedamong different members of a protein family(7Martinez J.C. Serrano L. J.Mol. Biol. 1999; 6: 1010-1016Google Scholar, 8Grantcharova V.P. Riddle D.S. Santiago J.V. Baker D. Nat. Struct.

Struct.Biol. 1998; 5: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar).However, it has been shown that differences in local propensity to formelements of secondary structure may modulate the stabilities of transientspecies, such as intermediates and/or transition state(s), and thereforeintroduce variations in the order whereby structural motifs are formed duringfolding (11Ferguson N. Capaldi A.P. James R. Kleanthous C. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1597-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar,12Nishimura C. Prytulla S. Dyson J.H. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Such effects may resultin different topologies of folding transition states in homologous proteins,as demonstrated by Baker and co-workers(13McCallister E.L. Alm E. Baker D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 8: 669-673Crossref Scopus (351) Google Scholar) for the IgG bindingdomains of proteins G and L. We focus here on c-type cytochromes, a protein family in which thefolding mechanism seems to involve an elusive intermediate species in the mstime window (14Colon W. Elove G.A. Wakem L.P. Sherman F. Roder H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5538-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar,15Gianni S. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Cutruzzolà F. Bigotti M.G. Brunori M. J. Mol.Biol. 2001; 309: 1177-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Starting from theidentification of an on-pathway intermediate observed in the foldingof Thermus thermophilus cytochrome c552(16Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Gianni S. Morea V. Tramontano A. Soulimane T. Brunori M. J. Biol.Chem. 2003; 278: 41136-41140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), a critical re-evaluationof published kinetic data on different prokaryotic and eukaryoticc-type cytochromes led to the proposal(17Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Gianni S. Brunori M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that proteins belongingto the cytochrome c family share a consensus folding mechanisminvolving, in all cases, the population of an on-pathway intermediatewith conserved structural features. To obtain additional experimental evidence to strengthen the hypothesis ofa consensus folding mechanism in this protein family, we report herein ananalysis of the folding kinetics of cytochrome c552 fromthe thermophilic bacterium Hydrogenobacter thermophilus. Thethree-dimensional structure of ferrous H. thermophilus cytochromec552 has been previously solved by solution NMR(18Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y. Yu Y. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this study, wepresent the crystal structure of the ferric derivative, which is generallyused in folding studies on c-type cytochromes. Characterization ofthe folding mechanism of this cytochrome c is particularlyinteresting for the purpose of comparative folding, because contrary to T.thermophilus cytochrome c552, H.thermophilus cytochrome c552 has a typical class Icytochrome c fold (Fig.1) and shares high sequence identity (57%) and structural homologywith its mesophilic counterpart from the bacterium Pseudomonasaeruginosa cytochrome c551. The latter was found torefold through a broad energy barrier with two transition states separated bya high energy intermediate(15Gianni S. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Cutruzzolà F. Bigotti M.G. Brunori M. J. Mol.Biol. 2001; 309: 1177-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On the basis of thesubstantial difference in thermodynamic stability between these twostructurally homologous cytochromes(18Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y. Yu Y. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we speculated that anintermediate species with properties similar to those proposed for the highenergy intermediate of P. aeruginosa cytochromec551 (and other evolutionary distant c-typecytochromes) would be populated in the folding of H. thermophiluscytochrome c552. We show here that, despite a canonical V-shaped chevron plot derivedfollowing secondary structure formation, H. thermophilus cytochromec552 transiently populates a compact obligatoryintermediate during refolding. Analysis of the folding kinetics, followed byTrp fluorescence, and correlation with the three-dimensional structure add newevidence for the validity of a consensus folding mechanism in the cytochromec family. Protein Expression and Purification—H. thermophiluscytochrome c552 was expressed and purified as describedpreviously (19Karan E.F. Russell B.S. Bren K.L. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Structure Determination—The protein wascrystallized using the hanging-drop method at 294 K under the followingconditions: drops (1.6 μl) were prepared by mixing equal volumes of proteinsolution and crystallization solution consisting of 50–60%2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.8–0.9 m ammonium sulfate, HEPESat 0.1 m, pH 7.0, and allowing the mixture to be equilibratedagainst 0.5 ml of the same reservoir solution. Crystals grew in ∼9 monthsand were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen without further addition ofcryoprotectants. A complete data set at 2.0 Å of resolution was collected at theELETTRA Synchrotron (Trieste, Italy). Reflection intensities were integratedand scaled using DENZO/SCALEPACK(20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38445) Google Scholar).

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. DBiol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), using as atemplate the structure of P. aeruginosa cytochromec551 (Protein Data Bank code 451C). The structure wascompleted in alternating cycles of model building using QUANTA (MolecularStructure, The Woodlands, TX) and refinement using Refmac5(22Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13815) Google Scholar). Water residues wereadded into the Fo - Fc density mapcontoured at 4σ with the X-SOLVATE tool of QUANTA. Several cycles ofrefinement, manual rebuilding, and addition of solvent molecules led to anR-factor of 0.17 and an Rfree value of 0.22. Therefined model was monitored for geometrical quality by using PROCHECK(23Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar)(Table I). Coordinates andstructure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code1YNR). Structural alignments were performed with software CE(24Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein Eng. 1997; 11: 739-747Crossref Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). Equilibrium Experiments—Chemical denaturation was monitoredby fluorescence emission at 354 nm (excitation at 280 nm; 10-mm light path)using a JobinYvon fluorometer and by circular dichroism at 222 nm using aJasco spectropolarimeter (2-mm light path). Samples (1 μm forfluorescence and 11 μm forCD 1The abbreviations used are: CD, circular dichroism; GdnHCl, guanidinehydrochloride. measurements) werethermostatted at 10 ± 0.1 °C. Kinetic Experiments—Kinetic experiments were carried outeither with a π*-180 (single mixing experiments) or with anSX-18 stopped-flow instrument (double mixing experiments), both from AppliedPhotophysics, Leatherhead, UK. Fluorescence emission was measured using a >320 nm cutoff filter(excitation was at 280 nm). Time-resolved circular dichroism was followed at225 nm (light path 10 mm). Temperature was set at 10 ± 0.1 °C.Folding and unfolding were initiated by an 11-fold dilution of the denaturedor native protein in the appropriate GdnHCl solution. Data Analysis—Equilibrium fluorescence and far-UV CDmeasurements, as a function of denaturant concentration, were fitted accordingto a two-state model in which only the native and the fully unfolded statesare populated, using the equation,ΔGD−N0=([GdnHCl]−[GdnHCl1/2])·mD−N(Eq. 1) where GdnHCl½ is the GdnHCl concentration in which 50% of the proteinis unfolded and mD-N is the m-value. The freeenergy of denaturation in the absence of denaturant(ΔG0D-N) was calculated assuming a lineardependence of the free energy of unfolding on denaturant concentration. Kinetic Measurements—In a simple three-state reactionscheme,A⇄k−1k1B⇄k−2k2CSCHEME 1the observed kinetics is governed by the two apparent rate constantsλ1 and λ2, and the denaturant dependenceof the observed rate constant λ2 shows a typical distortion(roll-over effect seen at low denaturant) from the classical V-shaped chevronplot λ1 = (p + q)/2 andλ2 = (p - q)/2, where p =(k1 + k-1 + k2 +k-2) and q = [(k1 +k-1 + k2 +k-2)2 -4(k1k2) -4(k1k-2) -4(k-1k-2)]½. However, discrimination between the on-pathway (U ↔ I ↔N) Model 1 andoff-pathway (I ↔ U ↔ N)Model 2 can be achieved only whenthe two apparent phases are kinetically coupled and all the relaxation ratesare measured over a wide range of denaturant concentration,k1=kUI=kUI0·exp(mUI·D)k−1=kIU=kIU0·exp(mIU·D)k2=kIN=kIN0·exp(mIN·D)k−2=kNI=kNI0·exp(mNI·D)MODEL 1k1=kIU=kIU0·exp(mIU·D)k−1=kUI=kUI0·exp(mUI·D)k2=kUN=kUN0·exp(mUN·D)k−2=kNU=kNU0·exp(mNU·D)MODEL 2where kIJ is the microscopic rate constant for theformation of state J from state I, and mIJ defines thedenaturant dependence of this step. Structure of Ferric H. thermophilus Cytochromec552—We solved the structure of oxidized H.thermophilus cytochrome c552(Fig. 1) by x-raycrystallography at 2.0 Å of resolution (crystallographic parameters arelisted in Table I). Comparisonof the three-dimensional structures of the ferrous(18Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y. Yu Y. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and ferric derivativesshows that the two forms are very similar, as expected. The root mean squaredeviation of the C-α atoms between the crystal structure and the averageof the 20 NMR solution structures of H. thermophilus cytochromec552 is 0.98 Å. Some interesting features, whichwere not detected by solution NMR, were identified in the crystal structure ofthe ferric derivative. Tyr-32 and Tyr-41 are hydrogen-bonded to the O-1A andO-2A of the heme propionic acid, respectively, whereas Tyr-25 ishydrogen-bonded to the sulfur atom of Met-11. Interestingly these residueswere shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be important for thethermostability of H. thermophilus cytochromec552(25Hasegawa J. Uchiyama S. Tanimoto Y. Mizutani M. Kobayashi Y. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol.Chem. 2000; 275: 37824-37828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, comparison between the crystal structures of P.aeruginosa cytochrome c551(26Matsuura Y. Takano T. Dickerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 389-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and H.thermophilus cytochrome c552, over and above thesimilarity of the main chain folding (root mean square deviation of theC-α atoms is approx. 0.7 Å), highlighted major packing differencesfor the two proteins, with the mesophilic cytochrome displaying a greatervolume of internal cavities(18Hasegawa J.

Indeed it has been shownby site-directed mutagenesis that such differences can account for theenhanced thermodynamic stability of H. thermophilus cytochromec552(25Hasegawa J. Uchiyama S. Tanimoto Y.

Equilibrium Unfolding—Characterization of the (un)foldingtransition of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 hasbeen carried out with the ferric derivative at different pH values from pH 3.0to 9.0 (data not shown). GdnHCl-induced denaturation was followed by far-UV CDand by intrinsic Trp fluorescence (the emission of the two Trp residues atpositions 54 and 75 being completely quenched in the native state). Theequilibrium transition observed with both spectroscopic probes corresponds toa single reversible process with no evidence of intermediate states. Analysisyields similar [GdnHCl]½ (4.0–4.2 m) andm-values (2.6 - 2.2 kcal mol-1 m-1).Fig. 2 compares theGdnHCl-induced denaturation of H. thermophilus cytochromec552 and P. aeruginosa cytochromec551, monitored by fluorescence at pH 4.7, 10 °C. Theunfolding free energies derived from two-state analysis (see “Materialsand Methods”) are -8.9 ± 1.5 kcal mol-1 for H.thermophilus cytochrome c552 and -5.0 ± 0.3kcal mol-1 for P. aeruginosa cytochromec551, consistent within experimental error with theΔΔGDN between the two proteins reported byHasegawa et al.(25Hasegawa J.

Folding and Unfolding Kinetics—Kinetic characterization wascarried out at pH 4.7 in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer to facilitatecomparison of the results with those previously obtained for P.aeruginosa cytochrome c551(27Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Cutruzzolà F. Bigotti M.G. Staniforth R.A. Brunori M. J. Mol.Biol. 1999; 289: 1459-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The kinetics of foldingand unfolding followed by far-UV CD were single exponential(Fig. 3, lower trace)at all denaturant concentrations, with no evidence for protein concentrationdependence (from 0.5 to 5.0 μm) of the first order rateconstants (data not shown), suggesting the absence of transient aggregationevents (28Silow M.

Thesemilogarithmic plot of the observed folding and unfolding rate constants, asa function of denaturant concentration (chevron plot) reported inFig. 4, top panel),corresponds to a simple V-shape, apparently consistent with a two-statefolder. The thermodynamic stability derived from quantitative analysis of thekinetic experiments (ΔGDN = -8.6 ± 0.1 kcalmol-1) is in very good agreement with the value obtained fromequilibrium experiments.Fig. 4Folding kinetics of H. thermophilus cytochromec552 at pH 4.7, 10 °C.

This slower process may have escapeddetection by far-UV CD because of the lower signal to noise ratio with respectto fluorescence quenching. The shallow denaturant dependence and the smallamplitude of this slower process initially suggested that it may be assignedto proline cis-trans isomerization(29Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26969) Google Scholar); however, additionalexperiments allowed us to conclude that this slow phase reflects, in fact, theformation of native molecules from an intermediate state, as detailedbelow. A powerful experimental approach to the testing of a folding mechanism isafforded by double-mixing interrupted kinetic experiments. As shown byKiefhaber (30Kiefhaber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9029-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) for lysozyme,this technique allows the fraction of native protein formed during therefolding process to be monitored. In the case of H. thermophiluscytochrome c552, unfolded molecules were allowed to beginrefolding by denaturant dilution in the first mix and then were unfolded againin a second mix after a variable delay time. The results showed that the majorfraction of native protein is formed in a first-order kinetic reaction(Fig. 4, inset) withk ∼ 5 s-1, similar to the slower process seen influorescence-monitored single-mixing experiments (see previous paragraph).Therefore, at the same [GdnHCl], the faster process (k ∼ 80s-1 at 1 m GdnHCl) associated with the major amplitudeshould reflect formation of a partially folded intermediate, in which thefluorescence and CD properties are very similar to those of the native state(implying only a small additional fluorescence quenching associated to thetransition I → N). The Folding Intermediate Is On-pathway—Detection of afolding intermediate is not sufficient, per se, to distinguishbetween two fundamentally different mechanisms that may involve (i) aproductive on-pathway obligatory intermediate or (ii) a misfoldedoff-pathway state that must unfold to achieve the native protein. Ithas been shown previously that such an issue may be addressed only if all themicroscopic rate constants are measured over a wide range of denaturantconcentration (3Capaldi A.P. Shastry M.C. Kleanthous C. Roder H. Radford S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,16Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Gianni S. Morea V. Tramontano A. Soulimane T. Brunori M.

In the case of H.thermophilus cytochrome c552, interrupted refoldingexperiments allowed us to measure the unfolding limb of the intermediate,thereby defining its kinetic role. By this approach, the intermediate waspopulated to a considerable extent in the first mixing step and thereafterchallenged with high and variable denaturant concentrations in the second mixto measure its unfolding rates. Fig. 4, bottompanel, summarizes the complete folding kinetics of H.thermophilus cytochrome c552 monitored byfluorescence and depicts the dependence of the rate constants for the twoidentified phases over a broad range of denaturant concentrations. Globalanalysis of the kinetic data (see “Materials and Methods”) isconsistent with the observed intermediate being an on-pathway speciesin the folding to the native state, following the approach used for otherproteins (3Capaldi A.P. Shastry M.C. Kleanthous C. Roder H. Radford S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,16Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Gianni S. Morea V. Tramontano A. Soulimane T.

The calculated Tanfordβ-value for this intermediate, reflecting the buried surface arearelative to the unfolded (βT = 0) and native(βT = 1) states, is βT = 0.71 ± 0.04.This value is close to that (βT = 0.66 ± 0.05) recentlyoutlined to be characteristic of the cytochrome c family on the basisof extensive analysis of available kinetic data(17Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Gianni S. Brunori M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), adding general validityto the consensus folding mechanism proposed for the c-typecytochromes. Folding Mechanism of Thermophilic and MesophilicCytochromes—As recalled above, the folding mechanism of P.aeruginosa cytochrome c551 involves an energy barrierwith at least two transition states (TS1 and TS2) and a high energyintermediate in between (15Gianni S. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Cutruzzolà F. Bigotti M.G. Brunori M. J. Mol.Biol. 2001; 309: 1177-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).On the other hand, our data show that a low energy intermediate is accumulatedin the folding pathway of H. thermophilus cytochromec552. Can we identify some structural determinants of thethermophilic protein responsible for the accumulation of a kinetically wellresolved intermediate contrary to the homologous P. aeruginosacytochrome c551? The two proteins have essentially thesame molecular weight and contain the same fraction of hydrophobic residues;moreover, they are structurally very similar (root mean square deviation ofthe backbone atoms ∼ 0.7 Å). The difference in their thermodynamicstabilities (ΔΔG ∼ 2.9 kcal mol-1 at pH4.7) suggests that, for H. thermophilus cytochromec552, the stabilization of the native state and of thepartially folded intermediate may be related to the same characteristicstructural features. In this respect, it is interesting that, contrary to whatwas observed for mitochondrial cytochrome c(32Fisher W.R. Taniuchi H. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3188-3195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also the apoform of thisthermophilic cytochrome c is surprisingly stable and partiallyfolded; indeed, apocytochrome c552 is able to bind theheme group in vitro, suggesting that it may contain a nascent hemebinding site (33Wain R.

Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It should be noticed that, over and above the similarity of the main chainfold, several local conformational differences emerge from the comparisonbetween these two bacterial cytochromes(18Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y. Yu Y. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Notably, cavity-fillingeffects due to a few selected substitutions were claimed to be responsible forthe enhanced thermostability of the thermophilic protein(25Hasegawa J. Uchiyama S. Tanimoto Y. Mizutani M. Kobayashi Y. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol.Chem. 2000; 275: 37824-37828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is therefore possiblethat packing defects might be involved in controlling the stability of thefolding intermediate(s), in addition to dictating overall proteinstability. Concluding Remarks—Two decades of extensive studies onprotein folding have shown that proteins seem to fold alternativelyvia two distinct mechanisms: (i) the framework mechanism(35Karplus M. Weaver D.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 650-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), whereby secondarystructural elements form first, giving rise to high/low energy intermediates,followed by tertiary structure formation and (ii) the nucleation-condensationmechanism (36Itzhaki L.S. Otzen D.E. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 260-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), wherebyfolding is driven by formation of a weak nucleus stabilized by long rangeinteractions (nucleation) and simultaneously consolidated by extendedstructure formation (condensation), following a two-state process.Interestingly, a recent study on the homeodomain superfamily demonstrated thatthe framework and nucleation-condensation models are different manifestationsof a common mechanism (37Gianni S. Guydosh N.R. Khan F. Caldas T.D. Mayor U. White G.W. DeMarco M.L. Daggett V. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13286-13291Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).Inherent stabilities of local structural elements modulate the foldingprocess; as the propensity for forming secondary structure increases, themechanism slides from the nucleation-condensation to the diffusion-collisionmodel (38Daggett V. Fersht A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 18-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). This observationis mirrored by detection of two-state folding for proteins with low secondarystructure propensity versus multistate folding for proteins with highsecondary structure propensity(11Ferguson N. Capaldi A.P. James R. Kleanthous C. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1597-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar,37Gianni S. Guydosh N.R. Khan F. Caldas T.D. Mayor U. White G.W.

In the case of the c-type cytochromes, a comparison of inherentpropensities of helical elements in P. aeruginosa cytochromec551 and H. thermophilus cytochromec552 is meaningful, given the notable structural homologybetween these two proteins. Travaglini-Allocatelli et al.(17Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Gianni S. Brunori M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) reported that, although adistinctly higher overall helical propensity for the thermophilic cytochromecan be excluded, the distribution of helical propensity is indeed different.In the case of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552,the C-terminal helix, which is part of a crucial folding nucleus in allc-type cytochromes(15Gianni S. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Cutruzzolà F. Bigotti M.G. Brunori M. J. Mol.Biol. 2001; 309: 1177-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,39Ptitsyn O.B. J.

FoldingDes. 1998; 3: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar),displays remarkably higher helical propensity compared with the mesophilicP. aeruginosa cytochrome c551. This observation,together with the reduced volume of packing defects, might explain theincreased stability of the folding intermediate, which involves crucialcontacts at the interface between the N- and C-terminal helices. Appropriatemutagenesis of the helical segments in the two proteins may allow verificationof the hypothesis that accumulation of the intermediate depends on the balanceof helical propensities for the three major α-helices in the cytochromec fold.

In the crown group, three members of thisfamily (paralogs DdCRTp1, DdCRTp2, and DdCRTp3) occur in the soil-livingamoeba Dictyostelium discoideum; in the alveolate clade, singlecopies of transporter homologs have been identified in apicomplexan parasitesincluding Cryptosporidium parvum, Toxoplasma gondii, Eimeria tenella,Theileria annulata, and several Plasmodium species(21Nomura T.

Transporters of this family are characterized by 10predicted transmembrane domains and by a number of conserved amino acids inand between these domains, including T(S/T)G andGX2CX10–22CX7–9CD(D/N)Csequences in the 3rd and 7th inter-transmembrane regions, respectively.

Whereas native functionsfor PfCRT and its homologs have not yet been established, evidence indicatesthat some of these transporters reside on the acidic vesicle membranes ofapicomplexans and D. discoideum.

Furthermore, the haploid nature of intraerythrocyticparasites and an apparently essential native function of PfCRT have so farlimited its genetic manipulation in P. falciparum to complementationand allelic exchange experiments(24Waller K.L.

Here we describe successfultransfer of the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance phenotype toD. discoideum cells and use results from these transformants toevaluate different hypotheses for the mechanism of resistance. We show thatexpression of mutant but not wild-type forms of PfCRT can reduce accumulationof chloroquine in D. discoideum, and that this reduced-accumulationphenotype is reversed by the channel blocker verapamil. PfCRT transfectionappears to produce small changes in the intravesicular pH of D.discoideum, but these do not explain reduced drug accumulation andinstead point to active drug efflux as the mechanism of chloroquineresistance. In contrast to chloroquine, quinine and quinidine show complexpatterns of accumulation in D. discoideum expressing different formsof PfCRT. Finally, we demonstrate that the chloroquine efflux mechanism inD. discoideum transformants does not reduce accumulation of animportant chloroquine analog (piperaquine) used against CQR parasites inSoutheast Asia.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPhylogenetic Analysis—Predicted protein sequences oftransporters in the PfCRT family were obtained from the followingGenBank™ deposits and data base web sites: Plasmodium bergheiPbCRTh, accession number AF314645; P. falciparum (Dd2 line) PfCRT,accession number AF030694; Plasmodium knowlesi PkCRTh, accessionnumber AF314646; T. gondii TgCRTh,toxodb.org;E. tenella EtCRTh,www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/E_tenella/;C. parvum CpCRTh, accession number EAL36465; T. annulataTaCRTh,www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/T_annulata/;D. discoideum DdCRTp1 (SSA662), accession number AF317500 (DictyBaseID number DDB0185065 (see Ref.28Kreppel L.

PlasmidpDEXH-GFP (34Faix J. Gerisch G. Noegel A.A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 203-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used toexpress the DdCRTp1 protein with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag at itsC-terminal end. Transformants of D. discoideum were generated usingexponential growth-phase cells (1–3 × 106 cells/ml) ofthe AX2 line (35Watts D.J. Ashworth J.M. Biochem.

The cellswere washed twice in cold H-50 transformation buffer (20 mm HEPES,50 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4,5 mm NaHCO3, 1 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.0) and resuspended at 5 ×107 cells/ml. One-hundred μl of cell suspension were mixed with10 μg of plasmid in 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4(TE), and electroporated twice using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (settings: 0.8kV/25μF, with a 5-s break between shocks). The electroporated cells wereincubated on ice for 5 min and transferred to a tissue culture platecontaining 10 ml of D3-T Basic Media (KD Medical) at 20 °C, thecultivation temperature for D. discoideum. G418 (20 μg/ml,Invitrogen) was added after 24 h for transformant selection, and clones werepicked by pipette 5–7 days later. Cells were cultivated as shakingsuspensions in D3-T Basic Media supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml),chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml), and tetracycline (25 μg/ml) (Sigma) at 20°C. Expression of plasmid-encoded proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE asdescribed below.Immunofluorescence and Immunoblotting Analysis—Forimmunofluorescence studies, cells in exponential growth phase (1–3× 106 cells/ml) were allowed to adhere for 15 min to glasscoverslips coated with 0.01% poly-l-lysine (Sigma). The cells werefixed for 15 min in 100% cold methanol and probed for 3 h either with ananti-PfCRT polyclonal rabbit antibody(7Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Talley A.K. Cooper R.A. Dzekunov S.M. Ferdig M.T.

The cells were harvested bycentrifugation, washed with cold phosphate buffer (PB; 10 mmNa2HPO4, 10 mm KH2PO4,pH 7.5), and washed again with cold homogenization buffer (25 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm sucrose, 50mm Tris-HCl pH 7.6) containing the Complete™ proteinaseinhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Purification of the endosomes wasperformed by the protocol of Clarke et al.(37Clarke M. Kohler J. Arana Q. Liu T. Heuser J. Gerisch G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells wereresuspended in 2 ml of homogenization buffer, placed in a syringe, and forcedtwice through a stack of two polycarbonate filters (Nucleopore, 5μm pore size). After the cell lysate was centrifuged at 500× g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells, 1.5 ml ofthe supernatant was brought to 4 ml with homogenization buffer, layered onto aPercoll gradient (10 ml each of 70, 65, and 60% Percoll in homogenizationbuffer) and spun for 1 h at 80,000 × g at 4 °C. TheTRITC-loaded endosomes were recovered in a faint red band near the top of thegradient. Intact TRITC-loaded vesicles were confirmed by fluorescencemicroscopy and PfCRT protein was detected by immunoblotting as describedabove.Determination of 3H-Drug Accumulation in D.discoideum— [3H]Chloroquine (25.7 Ci/mmol) was fromAmersham Biosciences; [3H]quinine and [3H]quinidine(both 20 Ci/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.;[3H]piperaquine was custom prepared by tritium exchange (15Ci/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.). D. discoideum cellsduring exponential phase growth were pelleted and resuspended to 1.1 ×108 cells/ml in PB. Cell numbers were determined from a curve ofoptical density at 590 nm versus cell counts by hemocytometer. Eightyμl of the cell suspension were added to 40 μl of 3-fold concentrated3H-drug in PB with or without verapamil and incubated at 20 °C.Each experiment was repeated in parallel on ice (0–4 °C) todetermine the extent of nonspecific interaction of 3H-drug with thecells. The cells were kept in suspension by vortexing every 10 min. After 1 h,the cells were separated from the radioactive incubation medium by layeringthe suspension on top of 250 μl of silicon oil (Wacker Silicones, 10:1mixture of PDM20 and PDM200) in a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuging at13,000 rpm for 30 s in a fixed angle rotor (Sorvall Biofuge Pico). The tubeswere placed on dry ice to freeze their contents, inverted, and sliced so thatthe bottoms containing complete pellets could be transferred intoscintillation vials containing 100 μl of NCS II tissue solubilizer(Amersham Biosciences). The vials were vortexed vigorously to dissolve thecell pellets and 20 μl of glacial acetic acid (Sigma) were added toneutralize the pH. After 5 min, 3 ml of Ultima Gold liquid scintillationmixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were added and the vials were allowed tostand overnight in the dark at room temperature. Samples were counted in aWallac Trilux 1650 Beta scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Values for nonspecific drug interaction at 0–4 °C (for chloroquine,typically <50% of the counts from cells at 20 °C that do not expressthe CQR phenotype) were subtracted from those obtained at 20 °C and druguptake (femtomoles/106 cells/h) was calculated as described(15Sanchez C.P. Wünsch S. Lanzer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2652-2658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Intracellular space ofthe pellets was determined using [14C]inulin carboxylic acid(Amersham Biosciences)(38Kirk K. Horner H.A. Biochem.J. 1995; 311: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Measurement of Endosomal pH—D. discoideum cells duringexponential growth phase (1–3 × 106 cells/ml) wereharvested and resuspended to 1 × 107 cells/ml in D3-T BasicMedia in a shaking flask at 225 rpm at 20 °C. TRITC-dextran (70 kDa;Molecular Probes) and FITC-dextran (77 kDa; Sigma) were added to finalconcentrations of 4 and 0.4 mg/ml, respectively. After 15 min, the cells werecentrifuged at 750 × g for 5 min, washed once with D3-T BasicMedia, and resuspended to 1 × 107 cells/ml. One-ml aliquotswere removed at appropriate time points and added to 100 μl of 2 mg/mltrypan blue (Sigma) in 20 mm sodium citrate, 150 mmNaCl, pH 4.5, solution to quench extracellular fluorescence. The cells werepelleted at 500 × g for 3 min and resuspended in 1 ml of PB.Fluorescence was measured using excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 and520 nm for FITC-dextran, and 544 and 574 nm for TRITC-dextran. The endosomalpH was estimated from a standard curve of FITC/TRITC fluorescence ratios in0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer at pre-determined pH values.RESULTSWild-type and Mutant Forms of PfCRT Can Be Targeted to Acidic Vesiclesof D. discoideum—Our initial experiments to express full-lengthPfCRT in D. discoideum yielded high amounts of protein that wasmislocalized throughout the cell and not targeted to acid vesicles (data notshown). We therefore designed a modified expression construct in which theN-terminal coding region of the D. discoideum transporter DdCRTp1replaced the corresponding N-terminal coding region of PfCRT ahead of thefirst transmembrane segment (Fig. 1,A and C).

Phase-contrast and fluorescencemicrographs confirm isolated endosomes loaded with TRITC-dextran. Individualsamples loaded in the different lanes each contained 3.3 μg of totalprotein from untransformed D. discoideum cells (U),transformed cells expressing DdCRTp1/PfCRT (T), or isolatedTRITC-loaded endosomes (I). Note the concentration of theDdCRTp1/PfCRT signal with the isolated endosomes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We performed two additional experiments to further confirm targeting of theDdCRTp1-directed chimera to acidic endosomes. In the first experiment, wetransformed D. discoideum cells with a modified pDEXH-GFP plasmid(34Faix J. Gerisch G. Noegel A.A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 203-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to express DdCRTp1 taggedwith GFP at its C-terminal end. After these transformants were exposed to 4mg/ml TRITC-dextran for 2 h to load the vesicles of the endosomal pathway,TRITC fluorescence from the endosomes was found to be circumscribed by GFPsignal at the vesicle membranes (Fig.2B). In the second experiment, D. discoideumcells expressing the chimeric DdCRTp1/PfCRT protein were exposed toTRITC-dextran, and the loaded endosomes were isolated by cell fractionationand Percoll gradient separation(37Clarke M. Kohler J. Arana Q. Liu T. Heuser J. Gerisch G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis withanti-PfCRT antibody verified concentrated localization of the chimeric proteinto the isolated TRITC-dextran-loaded endosomes(Fig. 2C).Expression of Mutant PfCRT with a Key Charge-loss Mutation Enables D.discoideum to Expel Chloroquine—To evaluate the effects of thePfCRT sequence on chloroquine accumulation by D. discoideum, wegenerated transfectants expressing chimeric proteins containing either thewild-type PfCRT (WT-CRT) sequence from CQS P. falciparum or a mutanttransporter sequence from a representative CQR P. falciparum line(Dd2) from Southeast Asia (SEA-CRT, carrying PfCRT mutationsM74I/N75E/K76T/A220S/Q271E/N326S/I356T/R371I)(7Fidock D.A.

After confirmingexpression of these chimeric proteins in transformed cells, we compared theintracellular accumulations of [3H]chloroquine at 4 and 20 °C,the cultivation temperature for D. discoideum. Accumulation of[3H]chloroquine at 4 °C was comparable for all D.discoideum lines tested and provided a measure of nonspecificinteraction, in agreement with the findings of Wünsch et al.(39Wünsch S.

However, at 20 °C, D. discoideum expressingSEA-CRT accumulated significantly lower levels of [3H]chloroquinethan untransformed cells or cells expressing WT-CRT. After subtractingnonspecific 4 °C uptake of [3H]chloroquine, more than 3-folddifferences in drug accumulation were typically detected between SEA-CRT- andWT-CRT-transformed D. discoideum; no significant differences wereobserved between WT-CRT-transformed and untransformed cells(Fig. 3A).

https://openalex.org/W2044191997,"Protein kinase A (PKA) has long been recognized as playing a major role in many regulatory processes in cells through its activation by the ubiquitous second messenger cAMP. We show here a novel mode of activation of PKA type II that is independent of cAMP and is, instead, dependent on sphingosine. PKA type II is specifically activated by sphingosine and its analog, dimethylsphingosine, but not by sphingosine-1-phosphate or other lipids. Like cAMP, sphingosine activates PKA holoenzyme but not the catalytic subunit alone, suggesting that the activation is mediated by the regulatory subunits. However, sphingosine-activated PKA, but not cAMP-activated PKA, is inhibited by phosphatidylserine, suggesting a distinct mechanism of activation. Furthermore, unlike cAMP, sphingosine does not induce the dissociation of PKA holoenzyme into catalytic and regulatory subunits. Modulation of sphingosine levels in vivo results in alteration in basal membrane-associated PKA activity consistent with a direct effect of membrane sphingosine on PKA type II. Importantly, sphingosine-dependent but not cAMP-dependent activation of PKA specifically phosphorylates Ser58 of the multifunctional adapter protein 14-3-3ζ, promoting the conversion of dimeric 14-3-3 to a monomeric state, thus potentially modulating several biological functions. These results define a new mode of PKA activation that is sphingosine-dependent and mechanistically different from the classical cAMP-dependent activation of PKA. Furthermore, they suggest that stimuli that induce sphingosine accumulation and modulate phospholipid content at the cell membrane have the potential to activate PKA, thereby inducing the phosphorylation of distinct substrates and biological activities.

Perkins J.P. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3763-3774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, PKA has been demonstrated to play a key role in the signaling of many G protein-coupled receptors through the activation of adenylate cyclase and the consequent production of cAMP (2Shabb J.B. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2381-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Classically, PKA is activated by cAMP-induced disruption of the holoenzyme, releasing the catalytic subunit from the inhibitory activity of regulatory subunits (2Shabb J.B. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2381-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The active catalytic subunit is then available to phosphorylate multiple protein substrates in the cytosol and nucleus. To date, over 100 physiological PKA substrates have been identified that mediate biological functions as diverse as calcium mobilization, gene transcription, and cell survival (2Shabb J.B. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2381-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, PKA is a central player in many cellular processes.The modulation of protein kinases by second messenger lipids is well established and illustrated by the protein kinase C (PKC) family of enzymes that are activated by the acidic membrane lipid, phosphatidylserine, and inhibited by the basic lipid, sphingosine (3Merrill A.H. Stevens V.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1010: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 4Igarashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1080-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Sphingosine is an intermediate in the sphingomyelin pathway that is generated at the plasma membrane upon ceramide breakdown in response to factors such as tumor necrosis factor α and Fas ligand (4Igarashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1080-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Sphingosine and its naturally occurring analog, dimethylsphingosine (DMS), act as second messengers, inducing apoptosis in many cell types including cancer cells (5Sweeney E.A. Sakakura C. Shirahama T. Masamune A. Ohta H. Hakomori S.-I. Igarashi Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 66: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Currently, these sphingolipids are being evaluated as anti-cancer agents, although little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in sphingosine-induced apoptosis. Sphingosine and DMS have been shown to modulate the activity of several protein kinases, including PKC (3Merrill A.H. Stevens V.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1010: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), Src (6Abdel-Ghany M. Osusky M. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. Shalloway D. Racker R. Biochim. Biophys.

Ogawa T. Hakomori S.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5385-5389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, several sphingosine-dependent kinase activities were previously identified in BALB/3T3 fibroblast extracts (9Megidish T. Cooper J. Zhang L. Fu H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21834-21845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 10Megidish T. Takio K. Titani K. Iwabuchi K. Hamaguchi A. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 1999; 28: 3369-3378Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and one of the activities was shown to phosphorylate members of the 14-3-3 family of adapter proteins (9Megidish T. Cooper J. Zhang L. Fu H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21834-21845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).The 14-3-3 family proteins are phosphoserine-binding proteins that interact with and modulate the functions of many key cellular proteins involved in proliferation, cell survival, and cell cycle control (11Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3 proteins are dimeric, and each monomer within the dimer is capable of binding a phosphoserine motif in a “client” protein (12Tzivion G. Shen Y.H. Zhu J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6331-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The dimeric structure of 14-3-3 is critical for the regulatory function of these molecules (12Tzivion G. Shen Y.H. Zhu J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6331-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that phosphorylation of 14-3-3ζ by a BALB/3T3 fibroblast extract-derived sphingosine-dependent kinase activity caused monomerization of 14-3-3, thus potentially altering biochemical and biological signals down-stream of 14-3-3 (13Woodcock J.M. Murphy J. Stomski F.C. Berndt M.C. Lopez A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36323-36327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We have now found that PKA phosphorylates 14-3-3ζ in response to sphingosine. We show here the characterization of this novel sphingosine-dependent activity of PKA, demonstrating for the first time that not only can PKA type II be activated by sphingosine but that this mode of activation involves a mechanism different from that utilized by cAMP. We show that phosphatidylserine inhibits sphingosine-induced but not cAMP-induced PKA activation and that sphingosine, unlike cAMP, does not dissociate PKA holoenzyme, indicating that the two modes of PKA activation are differentially regulated. Furthermore, the selective phosphorylation and resulting monomerization of 14-3-3 by sphingosine-activated but not cAMP-activated PKA suggest that this new mechanism may have profound implications for cell signaling and function.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—All sphingolipids were purchased from Biomol, with the exception of sphingosyl-phosphorylcholine (lyso-sphingomyelin) and a set of sphingosine stereoisomers that were obtained from Matreya.

Cooper J. Zhang L. Fu H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21834-21845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), disrupting the dimeric structure of the protein (13Woodcock J.M. Murphy J. Stomski F.C. Berndt M.C. Lopez A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36323-36327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Computer-based evaluation of the Ser58 region in 14-3-3ζ using a peptide motif-based scanning algorithm (accessible at Scansite.mit.edu) (16Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) suggested PKA and PKC as candidate kinases for phosphorylation of this site (VVGARRSSWRVVSSI, in which S corresponds to Ser58). Therefore, the effects of PKA and PKC inhibitors on BALB/3T3 fibroblast-derived sphingosine-dependent 14-3-3ζ phosphorylating activity were examined. A caspase-cleaved form of PKCδ isolated from rat liver was previously shown to phosphorylate 14-3-3ζ in a sphingosine-dependent manner (17Hamaguchi A. Suzuki E. Murayama K. Fujimura T. Hikita T. Iwabuchi K. Handa K. Withers D.A. Masters S.C. Fu H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41557-41565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the PKC inhibitor, GF109203X, had no effect on 14-3-3 phosphorylation (Fig. 1), indicating that PKCδ is not the sphingosine-dependent phosphorylating activity in BALB/3T3 fibroblast extract. In contrast, PKI, a PKA-specific inhibitory peptide, did inhibit 14-3-3 phosphorylation (Fig. 1). PhosphorImager quantitation of phosphorylation showed that 0.1 μm PKI inhibited sphingosine-dependent 14-3-3ζ phosphorylating activity by 70%, whereas 0.5, 1, and 10 μm PKI inhibited sphingosine-dependent 14-3-3ζ phosphorylating activity by >90% (Fig. 1). Additionally, the PKA inhibitor H89 also abolished 14-3-3 phosphorylation (data not shown). Intriguingly, however, the classical PKA activator cAMP was unable to induce 14-3-3 phosphorylation in BALB/3T3 cell extract (Fig. 1).To ascertain the biochemical relationship between the 14-3-3ζ phosphorylating activity in BALB/3T3 fibroblast extract and PKA, we performed anion-exchange chromatography of cell extract. Eluate fractions were assayed for PKA activity as determined by phosphorylation of the PKA peptide substrate, kemptide. A single peak of PKA activity was detected between fractions 31 and 40 when assayed in the presence of 10 μm cAMP (Fig. 2A). The elution profile of the PKA activity identifies the enzyme as PKA type II and is entirely consistent with previous studies with this cell line (18Noguchi K. Murata T. Cho-Chung Y.S. Eur. J. Cancer. 1998; 34: 1260-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Strikingly, 100 μm DMS also induced phosphorylation of kemptide, with an activity profile identical to that of cAMP-activated PKA but with slightly greater magnitude (Fig. 2A), suggesting that PKA type II fractionated from BALB/3T3 extract may also be activated by sphingolipid. Immunoblotting of all the eluate fractions confirmed the presence of catalytic PKA subunit only in fractions 32–39 (Fig. 2B), consistent with the PKA active fractions (Fig. 2A). 14-3-3ζ phosphorylating activity of all the eluate fractions was also measured in the presence and absence of 100 μm DMS. The DMS-inducible 14-3-3ζ phosphorylating activity eluted between fractions 31 and 40 and coincided with the peak of PKA activity (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, no 14-3-3ζ phosphorylation was detected in the absence of DMS (data not shown), and the DMS-induced 14-3-3ζ phosphorylating activity was inhibited by 10 μm PKI (data not shown), indicating that PKA type II corresponds to the sphingosine-dependent 14-3-3ζ phosphorylating activity in these fractions.Fig. 2Ion-exchange fractionation of BALB/3T3 fibroblast extract reveals co-elution of PKA type II with a sphingosine-dependent kinase. Cytosolic extract from BALB/3T3 fibroblasts was fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography as described under “Materials and Methods.” Eluate fractions were analyzed for PKA activity (A), the presence of PKA catalytic subunit (B), and sphingosine-dependent 14-3-3ζ phosphorylating activity (C). A, PKA activity was determined by kemptide phosphorylation in the presence of 10 μm cAMP (•), 100 μm DMS delivered in 0.1% (v/v) ethanol (○), or 0.1% (v/v) ethanol alone (▴). The dashed line indicates change in salt concentration during elution. B, eluate fractions were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for PKA catalytic subunit. C, sphingosine-dependent 14-3-3ζ phosphorylating activity in the eluate fractions was assayed in the presence of 100 μm DMS delivered in 0.5% (w/v) n-octylglucoside. After incubation, reactions were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated protein was detected by autoradiography. The experiment was repeated twice, and similar results were obtained.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether PKA type II is capable of phosphorylating 14-3-3ζ in a sphingosine-dependent manner, PKA holoenzyme purified from bovine heart was utilized. By anion-exchange analysis, the holoenzyme was type II (data not shown), as found previously with PKA from this source (19Corbin J.D. Sugden P.H. Lincoln T.M. Keely S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3854-3861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that, like the 14-3-3ζ phosphorylating activity from BALB/3T3 fibroblast extract (Fig. 1), PKA type II holoenzyme phosphorylated 14-3-3ζ only in the presence of DMS and sphingosine, whereas cAMP induced no phosphorylation. This phosphorylation was completely inhibited by the presence of 10 μm PKI, indicating that PKA was indeed responsible for the phosphorylation of 14-3-3ζ (Fig. 3). Additionally, no 14-3-3ζ phosphorylation occurred in the presence of sphingosine-1-phosphate or phosphatidylserine (data not shown), indicating that the phosphorylation of 14-3-3ζ by PKA occurs only in the presence of sphingosine or DMS. Furthermore, PKA did not phosphorylate the S58A 14-3-3ζ mutant (Fig. 3), indicating that Ser58 is the sole target of PKA phosphorylation in 14-3-3ζ. These results suggest that PKA type II can be activated in a cAMP-independent fashion by sphingosine and DMS to phosphorylate Ser58 of 14-3-3ζ.Fig. 3Sphingosine-activated PKA type II specifically phosphorylates Ser58 of 14-3-3ζ. The 14-3-3ζ phosphorylating activity of bovine heart PKA holoenzyme was determined in the presence (+) or absence (–) of 100 μm DMS or 100 μm sphingosine (Sph) with or without 10 μm PKI or 10 μm cAMP. After incubation, reactions were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated 14-3-3ζ was detected by autoradiography. Coomassie Blue staining of the gel indicates equal loading of 14-3-3ζ substrate even in the absence of phosphorylation. The figure shows a representative result of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Purified PKA Type II is a Sphingosine-dependent Kinase—To determine the direct effect of sphingolipid on PKA activity, we tested the ability of DMS to activate purified bovine heart PKA enzyme. The activity of PKA holoenzyme and catalytic subunit was assayed by a standard PKA assay using kemptide as a substrate in the presence or absence of cAMP or DMS. As shown (Fig. 4A), in the absence of exogenous activator, PKA holoenzyme was essentially inactive, whereas the catalytic PKA subunit was active, as expected. The activation of PKA holoenzyme by 10 μm cAMP induced a 9-fold increase in kemptide phosphorylation relative to inactive enzyme. Significantly, a 10-fold increase in kemptide phosphorylating activity was observed on addition of 100 μm DMS to PKA holoenzyme. Furthermore, addition of 10 μm PKI to DMS-activated PKA completely abolished kemptide phosphorylation, confirming that DMS was stimulating PKA (Fig. 4A). This result is consistent with the previous result using BALB/3T3 fibroblast extract, in which DMS induced activation of PKA holoenzyme (Fig. 2A). In contrast, addition of either cAMP or DMS to the catalytic subunit gave no increase in kemptide phosphorylation, indicating that the activity of the PKA catalytic subunit is not affected by DMS.Fig. 4Sphingosine activates PKA type II holoenzyme, but not catalytic subunit. A, bovine heart PKA holoenzyme and catalytic subunit were assayed by kemptide phosphorylation in 0.1% (v/v) ethanol alone (white bars), 10 μm cAMP (black bars), or 100 μm DMS without (gray bars) or with 10 μm PKI (stippled bars). The values represent means ± S.E. of triplicate determinations, and representative results of multiple experiments are shown. B, effect of increasing kemptide concentration on DMS-activated PKA type II activity. PKA activity was assayed by kemptide phosphorylation with the indicated concentrations of DMS delivered in 0.1% (v/v) ethanol and 0 (▴), 5 (□), 15 (▪), 50 (○), and 200 μm (•) kemptide as substrate.

We monitored the exocyticapical transport pathways in living cells with two hydrolases of theintestinal brush border as model proteins, YFP-tagged sucrase-isomaltase (SI)as raft-associated marker and the non-raft-associated CFP-taggedlactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH). SI and LPH leave the TGN in post-Golgicarriers that pinch off two different vesicle populations, LPH-carrying apicalvesicles and SI-containing apical vesicles (SAVs), which segregate their cargoalong different cytoskeletal tracks to the apical plasma membrane(16Jacob R. Heine M. Alfalah M. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 607-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified the association of the α-kinase ALPK1 asa new component of the raft-containing SAV vesicle population. Here, wedemonstrate the association of ALPK1 with exocytic SAV vesicles that have leftthe Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, ALPK1 plays an essential role in theexocytic transport to the apical plasma membrane in epithelial cells.

For RNA interference experiments, specificdepletion of ALPK1 was performed with the siRNA duplex corresponding tonucleotides 66–86 (Ambion), whereas nonspecific duplexes of luciferasesiRNA (Dharmacon) were used as a control. Vesicle Preparation and Precipitation—Post-TGN vesicles ofMDCK-SI-YFP and MDCK-LPHMyc cells were isolated as describedpreviously (16Jacob R. Heine M. Alfalah M. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 607-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In principle,sucrose gradient fractions enriched with post-TGN vesicles were used forimmunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-green fluorescentprotein (Clontech) or mAb anti-Myc (Sigma). The washed samples were thenprocessed by kinase-assays or SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein Preparations for Mass Spectrometry—Theimmunoprecipitates were loaded on SDS-gels followed by colloidal staining withCoomassie Blue, and single bands were cut out and transferred into anEppendorf tube (17Neuhoff V. Stamm R. Pardowitz I. Arold N. Ehrhardt W. Taube D. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).

Immunochemical Reagents and Immunoblotting—Immunoblottingemployed polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany)and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, which werevisualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The antibodies C38516 and 82855directed against myosin I, pAb anti-myosin I, was a generous gift from Drs. I.Meza (Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN, Mexico City, Mexico), I. Baines(Max Planck Institute (MPI), Heidelberg, Germany), and E. Korn (NationalInstitutes of Health). For immunoprecipitation of human SI, a mixture of themouse mAbs of hybridoma HBB 1/219, HBB 2/619, and HBB 3/705 was used(18Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J.

Sterchi (University of Bern, Switzerland). As internal control for Westernblot experiments, we used mAb anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase(Stressgen, Victoria, Canada) or mAb anti-vimentin (Immunotech, Marseille,France). Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbit against the full-lengthALPK1-MBP fusion protein by Cocalico Inc. (Reamstown, CT). Antibodies wereaffinity-purified from serum over a column of ALPK1-MBP cross-linked toAffi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad). Purification of antibody was performed in batches. Ineach batch, 5 ml of anti-serum was incubated with 2 ml of ALPK1-affigel 10beads at 25 °C with gentle swirling. Beads with adsorbed antibodies werepacked into a small column and washed with phosphate-buffered saline until noprotein was detected in the eluate. Elution was performed with 200mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.6. Immediately after elution, pH of eluate wasbrought back to 7.0 by adding 100 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,per ml of eluate. Fractions containing antibodies were pooled and dialyzedagainst 2 liters of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol and 0.1%Triton X-100. Purified antibodies were frozen in aliquots and stored at–20 °C. Construction of cDNA Clones—The cDNA of ALPK1(19Ryazanova L.V. Pavur K.S. Petrov A.N. Dorovkov M.V. Ryazanov A.G. Mol. Biol. (Mosc.). 2001; 35: 271-283Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was amplified using theprimer pair5′-CCGCTCGAGTCATGAATAATCAAAAAGTGTAGC-3′/5′-CGCGGATCCGGTGTGCATGGTTTCTCCATTG-3′and ligated into the unique sites BamHI/XhoI of the pECFP-C1 vector(Clontech). The resulting plasmid denoted pALPK1-CFP was confirmed bysequencing. Kinase Assay—The kinase assay has been performed usingimmunoprecipitated myosin Ia-YFP and ALPK1-CFP in principal, as describedpreviously (19Ryazanova L.V. Pavur K.S. Petrov A.N. Dorovkov M.V. Ryazanov A.G. Mol. Biol. (Mosc.). 2001; 35: 271-283Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The sampleswere incubated in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm ATP,pH 6.6) containing 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C forthe indicated periods of time followed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaginganalysis. Cell Culture, Biosynthetic Labeling, andImmunoprecipitation— Caco-2, COS-1, and MDCK cells were grown inDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C.Plasmid and siRNA transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000(Invitrogen). Metabolic labeling of Caco-2 cells with[35S]methionine for 4 h and immunoprecipitation with mAb anti-SIwas performed essentially as described before(20Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For surfaceprecipitation, biosynthetically labeled cells were incubated for 2 h at4°C in the presence of mAb anti-SI followed by cell lysis andprecipitation of the antigen-antibody complex with protein A-Sepharose bycentrifugation. The precipitated aliquots were washed, and mAb anti-SI wasadded to the remaining supernatants to precipitate the internal mannose-richand complex glycosylated stores of both enzymes. The immunoprecipitates weresubjected to 6% SDS-PAGE, and phosphorimages were analyzed with the Bio-RadQuantity One software. RNA Extraction and Real-time PCR—For RNA extraction and cDNAsynthesis RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and RevertAid first strandcDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas) were used. The quantitative determination ofcDNA was performed using a Cepheid Smart Cycler II (Intas, Göttingen,Germany) and the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). The primers used forthe real-time PCR were5′-TGTGTCGGAAGAGGACAAGAGCGA-3′/5′-TTTGTACTGCCACTTTTCAGGCACGA-3′for ALPK1 and5′-TATGTTTGAGACCTTCAACACC-3′/5′-CTCCAGAGTCCATGACAATGC-3′for γ-actin. The annealing temperature for ALPK1 primers was 59.7°C, and for γ-actin, it was 56.6 °C. RNA proportions of ALPK1were standardized according to γ-actin values. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Confocal images of livingcells were acquired on a Leica TCS SP2 microscope using a ×63 waterplanapochromat lens (Leica Microsystems) essentially as described before(15Jacob R. Naim H.Y. Curr.Biol. 2001; 11: 1444-1450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Association of ALPK1 with SAVs—The apical post-Golgitransport carriers LPH-carrying apical vesicles and SAVs from MDCK cellscontain common and unique components(16Jacob R. Heine M. Alfalah M. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 607-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A band of about 140 kDacould be exclusively detected in preparations of immunoisolated SAVs(Fig. 1A). Twoseparate matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight massspectrometry analyses of this band revealed peak lists that corresponded tothe trypsinized peptide pattern of lymphocyte α-kinase or α-kinase1 (ALPK1, according to the new nomenclature of α-kinases), with amolecular mass of 139 kDa (accession number NP_079420). This result wasconfirmed by immunoblots in which the 140-kDa band was detected exclusively inSAV vesicles using a pAb anti-ALPK1 antibody(Fig. 1B). ALPK1belongs to a new family of kinases, named α-kinases, with sequencehomology to myosin heavy chain kinase from Dictyostelium(21Futey L.M. Medley Q.G. Cote G.P. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol.

The degree of expression during cell differentiationwas analyzed in Caco-2 cells by immunoblotting and quantitative RT-PCR(Fig. 2). Here, we could showthat the synthesis of ALPK1 mRNA increased significantly in the first 8 daysof cell polarization resulting in quantitative amounts of the polypeptide infully differentiated epithelial cells.Fig. 2Increase in the expression of ALPK1 during epithelial differentiation ofCaco-2 cells. Caco-2 cells were cultivated for different time intervals,and ALPK1 expression was analyzed by Western blot with pAb anti-ALPK1 and mAbanti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (A) orquantitative RT-PCR (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Confocal Analysis of ALPK1-CFP and SI-YFP—The subcellularlocalization of ALPK1 was examined in co-transfection experiments in COS-1cells utilizing chimeras of ALPK1 fused to CFP and thetrans-Golgi-marker galactosyltransferase-YFP (GT-YFP)(Fig. 3A). Here,ALPK1-CFP showed a vesicular staining in the cytosol and a condensation nextto the nucleus that co-localized with GT-YFP fluorescence. In addition,ALPK1-positive vesicular carriers were also labeled by SI-YFP(Fig. 3B), whichsuggests that both proteins are transported on the same route along thesecretory pathway. Kinase Activity on Isolated SAVs—To gain insight into therole of this kinase on post-Golgi vesicles, we analyzed its activity onimmunoisolated SAVs. Incubation of these vesicles with[γ-32P]ATP for different time intervals at 37 °C followedby SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging analysis revealed the incorporation of32P into a major 105-kDa polypeptide and three minor proteins of50, 25, and 16 kDa (Fig. 4, A andB). Based on previous observations, which describe the identification of a105-kDa SAV-associated motor protein of the myosin I subfamily(16Jacob R. Heine M. Alfalah M. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 607-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,24Jacob R. Heine M. Eikemeyer J. Frerker N. Zimmer K.P. Rescher U. Gerke V. Naim H.Y. J.Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3680-3684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we analyzed the identityof the phosphorylated 105-kDa protein by immunoblotting with pAb anti-myosinI. Here, SAVs were immunoisolated after varying times of TGN-release,incubated in the presence of 32P, subjected to SDS-PAGE, andblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Interestingly, a band of 105 kDa,which was found phosphorylated in the kinase assay(Fig. 4C), could bedetected in the immunoblot. This points to a myosin I as one target forphosphorylation on isolated SAVs. Furthermore, in these experiments, theintensities of immunostained myosin I increased by the time after TGN release,which indicates that the actin motor protein accumulates on vesicles duringtheir passage to the cell surface. On the other hand, the highest degree of32P-incorporation into the myosin band could be observed 20 minafter TGN exit. This was reversed by incubation with λ-phosphatase(Fig. 4D). Shorter orlonger time intervals resulted in less 32P incorporation,indicating a time interval of maximum myosin phosphorylation afterTGN-release. The next question was whether ALPK1 is the kinase that can catalyze thephosphorylation of myosin Ia. When isolated vesicles were incubated with[γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of EDTA for calciumdepletion, trifluoroperazine (TFP) as calmodulin inhibitor, or the kinaseinhibitor staurosporine, only effectors of Ca2+ and calmodulin werecapable of reducing significantly the amount of myosin Ia phosphorylation(Fig. 4, E andF). Interestingly, insensitivity to staurosporine is aspecific property of the ALPK1 homologues eEF-2 kinase and TRPM7/ChaK1(25Ryazanov A.G. Ward M.D. Mendola C.E. Pavur K.S. Dorovkov M.V. Wiedmann M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Parmer T.G. Prostko C.R. Germino F.J. Hait W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar,26Ryazanova L.V. Dorovkov M.V. Ansari A. Ryazanov A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3708-3716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in an invitro approach with immunoisolated ALPK1-CFP and myo1A-YFP(24Jacob R. Heine M. Eikemeyer J. Frerker N. Zimmer K.P. Rescher U. Gerke V. Naim H.Y. J.Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3680-3684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we directly analyzedwhether ALPK1 is able to catalyze the phosphorylation of this motor protein byincubating the two components separately or together with[γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 30 min.Fig. 4G depicts thatthe fusion proteins were not phosphorylated when added separately, whereas afaint 32P incorporation into myo1A-YFP was detected in the samplescontaining ALPK1 and myosin Ia, which indicates that myosin Ia may be amolecular target for the kinase activity of ALPK1 on post-TGN apical transportvesicles. To further analyze whether ALPK1 and myosin 1a are found in the samesubcellular compartments, COS-1 cells transfected with ALPK1-CFP and myo1A-YFPwere analyzed by confocal microscopy. 1 day after transfection, the newlysynthesized proteins were chased into the TGN at 20 °C followed by atemperature shift to 37 °C to enable their release from this organelle. Adirect overlap between ALPK1-labeled vesicular structures and myo1A-YFPstaining is shown in Fig.4H, strongly suggesting that myosin Ia binds toALPK1-carrying post-TGN vesicles. Effect of ALPK1 Inhibition and Knockdown—For the analysis ofan in vivo role of ALPK1 in apical protein transport, we analyzed thetransport and sorting of sucrase-isomaltase in Caco-2 cells biosyntheticallylabeled in the presence or absence of TFP or staurosporine. Cell surfaceimmunoprecipitation of SI revealed the complex glycosylated SIcform exclusively at the apical membrane, whereas the cellular lysatescontained the mannose-rich SIh form as well as SIc(Fig. 5A). Thetargeting of SIc to the apical membrane is sensitive to calmodulininhibition by TFP, whereas staurosporine on the other hand did not have aneffect on apical transport of SI (Fig. 5,A and B), suggesting that apical transportdepends on a non-conventional, Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitivekinase. In a second approach, intracellular ALPK1 was reduced in Caco-2 cells byRNA-mediated interference to specifically deplete intracellular ALPK1. Asignificant reduction of ALPK1 mRNA as well as protein levels by about 80% inthe RNA interference-treated samples is depicted inFig. 6, A andB. We then analyzed the apical or basolateral delivery ofSI in ALPK1-depleted polarized Caco-2 cells. As a result of the reduction ofintracellular ALPK1 levels, the proportion of SI that has been delivered tothe apical domain was substantially decreased, although a remarkable amount ofSI still reached the apical cell surface(Fig. 6C). This mightbe due to the presence of about 20% of ALPK1 remaining after siRNA treatment.However, the ALPK1-dependent reduction in apical surface delivery of SIsuggests that this α-kinase is involved in the transport process of SI.In addition, since a shift in the polarity behavior of SI to the basolateralmembrane did not occur by ALPK1 depletion, the sorting step does not depend onthe level of ALPK1. Finally, we checked whether a knockdown of ALPK1 influences thephosphorylation of myosin I on isolated vesicles.Fig. 6, D andE, indicates that SAVs isolated from ALPK1 depleted cellsshowed a significant reduction of 32P incorporation into the105-kDa myosin I band. As a consequence, we observed a correlation between thephosphorylation status of myosin I and the intracellular ALPK1 concentration.Thus, we suggest that ALPK1 plays a role in the phosphorylation of myosinI. Until now, several proteins have been postulated to be involved in apicaltargeting and the formation of lipid rafts as transport platforms. Among themis the MAL/VIP17 proteolipid that is required for the transport of differentapical protein markers (27Cheong K.H. Zacchetti D. Schneeberger E.E. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here, the presence of actin-binding proteins such as myosin Ia(16Jacob R. Heine M. Alfalah M. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 607-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,30Montes de Oca G. Lezama R.A. Mondragon R. Castillo A.M. Meza I. Arch. Med.

A. 2003; 100: 15143-15148Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) suggests theirimplication in vesicle movement or fission. This is indicated by experimentswith a dominant negative inhibitor of myosin Vb, which decreases theefficiency of apical transport(31Brock S.C. Goldenring J.R. Crowe Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15143-15148Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, thelocalization and function of myosin motors can be triggered by phosphorylation(32Swanljung-Collins H. Collins J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3445-3454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Zot H.G. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J.

Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar).Very recently, it has been demonstrated that Cdc42-dependent myosin II lightchain phosphorylation mediates cell motility(35Wilkinson S. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). A tight regulation ofthe cascades involved here is absolutely required since Cdc42 moreovercontrols cell polarity (36Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev.Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar).Major signaling cascades have also been shown to play a key role in theregulation of intracellular organelle transport. Kashina et al.(37Kashina A.S. Semenova I.V. Ivanov P.A. Potekhina E.S. Zaliapin I. Rodionov V.I. Curr.Biol. 2004; 14: 1877-1881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) defined “regulatedmotor units” characterized by the association of protein kinase A anddynein or kinesin II/myosin V motors. Thus, this complex is directly connectedto the cAMP signaling pathway. In addition, the myosin V-driven organelletransport is differently controlled during the cell cycle(38Wollert T. Weiss D.G. Gerdes H.H. Kuznetsov S.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A kinase responsible formyosin V phosphorylation is calcium-/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, which isrequired for activation of myosin V-based movements. ALPK1 on apical transport vesicles belongs to a newly discovered proteinkinase family that has no sequence homology to conventional protein kinases(39Ryazanov A.G. Pavur K.S. Dorovkov M.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R43-R45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, their catalyticdomains appeared to be homologous to the catalytic domain of myosin heavychain kinase A from Dictyostelium. This new family of protein kinaseswas named α-kinase, based on the evidence that these protein kinasesphosphorylate amino acids located within α-helices. Interestingly, avery recent work describes the identification of a new α-kinase inGolgi-like structures from Dictyostelium, which is, like ALPK1,characterized by a catalytic domain located at the C terminus of thepolypeptide (40Betapudi V. Mason C. Licate L. Egelhoff T.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; Google Scholar). Furthermore,TRPM7/ChK1 channel kinase, another member of this family, has recently beenshown to phosphorylate annexin 1, a cytosolic linker molecule involved inprotein transport (41Dorovkov M.V. Ryazanov A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50643-50646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thisobservation would suggest that an α-kinase is capable of regulatingintracellular trafficking processes by phosphorylation. The present study evengoes one step further and demonstrates that knocking down ALPK1 reduces thesurface delivery of SI, a model protein for apical transport. In view of thepresence of myosin Ia on SI-containing apical vesicles, a close correlationbetween ALPK1-activity and myosin phosphorylation was assessed. The resultingdata presented here suggest that ALPK1 depletion impairs the phosphorylationof myosin Ia on SI-containing vesicles. Nevertheless, it still remains an openquestion whether this actin motor catalyzes the active movement of SAVs alongactin filaments, which has to be solved in the future. In epithelial cells, myosin Ia is localized to the apical brush border andforms a helical array around polarized actin bundles(42Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggestan involvement of myosin Ia in the retention of SI at the brush border(43Tyska M.J. Mooseker M.S. J.Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, further dataindicate that myosin Ia is also involved in membrane traffic of polarizedcells. Expression of a dominant negative form of myosin Ia in Caco-2 cellsaffects the trans-epithelial transport from basolateral to apical,thus demonstrating that acto-myosin-driven mechanisms are involved inintracellular routing and the final delivery of apical marker proteins(44Durrbach A. Raposo G. Tenza D. Louvard D. Coudrier E. Traffic. 2000; 1: 411-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, the observedincrease in the expression of ALPK1 during epithelial cell differentiation andpolarization appears to be linked to a putative role of this kinase in thephosphorylation and regulation of myosin Ia. As a conclusion, ALPK1, a newcomponent of the apical transport machinery, is a putative candidate for theregulation of polarized trafficking in enterocytes. We thank Drs. I. Meza (IPN), I.

Dimerization of the ATP synthase involves the physical association of the neighboring membrane-embedded F0-sectors. In yeast, the F0-sector subunits g and e (Su g and Su e, respectively) play a key role in supporting the formation of ATP synthase dimers. In this study we have focused on Su g to gain a better understanding of the function and the molecular organization of this subunit within the ATP synthase complex. Su g proteins contain a GXXXG motif (G is glycine, and X is any amino acid) in their single transmembrane segment. GXXXG can be a dimerization motif that supports helix-helix interactions between neighboring transmembrane segments. We demonstrate here that the GXXXG motif is important for the function and in particular for the stability of Su g within the ATP synthase. Using site-directed mutagenesis and cross-linking approaches, we demonstrate that Su g and Su e interact, and our findings emphasize the importance of the membrane anchor regions of these proteins for their interaction. Su e also contains a conserved GXXXG motif in its membrane anchor. However, data presented here would suggest that an intact GXXXG motif in Su g is not essential for the Su g-Su e interaction. We suggest that the GXXXG motif may not be the sole basis for a Su g-Su e interaction, and possibly these dimerization motifs may enable both Su g and Su e to interact with another mitochondrial protein.

Su e also contains a conserved GXXXG motif in its membrane anchor. However, data presented here would suggest that an intact GXXXG motif in Su g is not essential for the Su g-Su e interaction. We suggest that the GXXXG motif may not be the sole basis for a Su g-Su e interaction, and possibly these dimerization motifs may enable both Su g and Su e to interact with another mitochondrial protein. The F1F0-ATP synthase enzyme plays a pivotal role in the aerobic production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) in eukaryotic cells. This enzyme is located in the inner membrane of mitochondria and is composed of a large number of different subunits (1Stock D. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E.

Aggeler R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 154-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Functionally, the enzyme can be divided into two parts or subcomplexes, the inner membrane embedded F0-sector and the associated hydrophilic F1-sector, which protrudes into the mitochondrial matrix. The F0-sector is responsible for the passage of protons from the intermembrane space into the matrix, a step coupled to the F1-catalyzed synthesis of ATP from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate (4Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 154-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In mitochondria the F0-sector is composed of a number of different polypeptides, which are both nuclear- and mitochondria-encoded. In yeast, for example, at least 10 different subunits make up this subcomplex, three of which (subunits 6, 8, and 9) are encoded by the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; WT, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); Su, subunit. 1The abbreviations used are: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; WT, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); Su, subunit.

Biomembr. 2000; 32: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The F0-sector of the mitochondrial enzyme is, thus, more complex than that of its bacterial counterpart, where only three subunits (subunits a, b, and c) have been described. In addition to mediating the passage of H+ ions across the inner membrane, the F0-sector also has been described to physically associate with neighboring F0-sectors, which results in the dimerization of ATP synthase complexes in the mitochondrial inner membrane (5Arnold I.

Three F0-sector subunits, subunit 4 (Su 4, equivalent to bacterial subunit b) and the two recently identified subunits, subunits e and g (Su e and Su g, respectively) have been shown to play a critical role in the process of F0-sector dimerization (5Arnold I.

A number of independent lines of evidence for the ATP synthase dimerization have been presented in the literature over the recent years. First, molecular sizing analysis, either gel filtration or native gel electrophoresis of the ATP synthase complexes solubilized from mitochondrial membranes with a mild detergent, demonstrated that the ATP synthase can be isolated as a complex whose mass (∼1000 kDa) was consistent with that of a dimeric complex (5Arnold I. Bauer M.F. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 6Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H.

Because the stoichiometry of Su 4 is known to be 1 Su 4 per F0-sector, the observed Su 4-Su 4 cross-linking provides evidence for F0-F0 interaction in the mitochondrial membrane (7Spannagel C.

More recently, in vivo studies using fluorescent resonance energy transfer technology has also supported a close physical association of one F1F0-ATP synthase complex with another (12Gavin P.D.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2333-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Gene knock-out studies in yeast combined with biochemical analysis of the ATP synthase complex have indicated that the conserved Su e and Su g proteins are not essential for the enzymatic activity of the complex (6Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 9Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M.

The ATP synthesis capacity of the complex has been reported to be partially compromised in the absence of Su e and Su g, however (9Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V.

Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 9Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M.

Further analysis of the mitochondria from the null mutant strains, Δsu e and Δsu g, respectively, however, revealed that these mutants exhibit two interesting phenotypes. First, in the absence of Su e and/or Su g, the ATP synthase complex failed to assemble into detergent stable dimers, as indicated by native gel electrophoresis (6Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 9Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brethes D. di Rago J.P.

Cell. 2005; 4: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, Su 4-Su 4 cross-linking has been reported in Δsu e and Δsu g mitochondria, indicating that a close physical proximity of ATP synthase complexes can still exist in the absence of Su e and Su g proteins (9Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brethes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). These Su 4-Su 4-mediated interactions appear not to be stable in the absence of Su e and Su g, however, as only monomeric ATP synthase complexes are observed after detergent solubilization (6Arnold I.

Second, the importance of the Su g and Su e proteins have been further highlighted by the recent demonstration that the presence of these proteins are required to develop normal mitochondrial morphology, in particular development of the characteristic cristae structure of the inner membrane (9Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brethes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 14Arselin G. Vaillier J.

Cristae are finger-like invaginations of the inner mitochondrial membrane, protruding into the mitochondrial matrix and are distinct from the inner boundary membrane, which is in close proximity to the outer mitochondrial membrane. In the absence of Su g or Su e, the mitochondrial inner membrane fails to partition into cristae invaginations but, rather, accumulates as onion-type membranes (9Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B.

To further understand how Su e and Su g may affect the ATP synthase and its organization in the inner mitochondrial membrane, it is important to gain a better understanding of the molecular environment of these subunits within the ATP synthase and to identify the proteins they interact with. This present study focuses on the Su g protein. Su g is a relatively small protein (115 amino acid residues) and spans the inner mitochondrial membrane in an Nin-Cout orientation (6Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 19Boyle G.M. Roucou X. Nagley P. Devenish R.J. Prescott M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Su g has a single transmembrane segment (residues 88–106) that is located close to the C-terminal end of the protein (Fig. 1A). The bulk of the protein, the N-terminal hydrophilic domain (residues 1–87), is located in the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 1A) (6Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Alignment of Su g amino acid sequences indicates a high level of conservation in the C-terminal region of Su g, in particular the transmembrane segment (Fig. 1B). A tyrosine residue (Tyr-112) located immediately after the transmembrane region and two glycine residues (Gly-101 and Gly-105) within the transmembrane segment are conserved in all known Su g proteins (20Hong S. Pedersen P.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2004; 36: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These conserved glycine residues form a motif GXXXG (G is Gly, and X represents any amino acid), which has been shown to be involved in the homo- or heterodimerization of other membrane proteins, e.g. glycophorin A (21Mingarro I. Whitley P. Lemmon M.A. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1996; 7: 1339-1341Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engleman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 23Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 24Senes A.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5990-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). GXXXG motifs can form the framework for transmembrane helix-helix interactions, where the Gly residues and the spacing of three residues between them, have been shown to be essential aspects of the motif as they ensure a close helix-helix packing interface. The highly conserved nature of the GXXXG motif in Su g is indicative of its potential importance for the function of Su g, and it is possible that this motif may be involved in transmembrane helix-helix interactions between neighboring Su g proteins (homodimerization) or with another F0-sector subunit (heterodimerization). Using site-directed mutagenesis combined with a cross-linking approach, we have addressed here the molecular environment of Su g within the F0-ATPase complex. We provide evidence for a close proximity between Su g and the Su e protein and also for a putative Su g homodimerization. Furthermore, we show that alterations in the Su g protein can cause significant changes in the molecular environment of Su e. We also demonstrate the importance of the conserved GXXXG motif for the stability of Su g and its interaction with the ATP synthase. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Yeast strains used in this study were wild-type (WT) W303–1A (Mat a, leu2, trp1, ura3, his3, ade2) and the su g null mutant, Δsu g (W303-1A, leu2, trp1, ura3, ade2, ATP20::HIS3) (6Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from the resulting yeast strains, which had been grown in YP (yeast extract, peptone) supplemented with 0.5% lactate and galactose (2%, YP-galactose medium) or glycerol (3%, YPG medium), as indicated (26Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1994: 538-544Google Scholar). Cloning and Expression of Mutated and HA-tagged Su g Derivatives—The entire open reading frame encoding Su g (ATP20 gene) was amplified by the PCR as a SpeI-PstI fragment. When indicated, the reverse primer used contained the sequence information to encode the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope before the translational stop codon in addition to a Su g-specific sequence for priming. In addition, residues Gly-101, Gly-l05, Val-110, and Tyr-112 were individually mutated as indicated by incorporating the mutated sequence into the corresponding Su g reverse primer. The recombinant PCR products were cloned into a yeast integration vector Yip351, which contained a galactose-inducible GAL10 promoter, and the LEU2 auxotrophic marker gene (15Everard-Gigot V.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6438-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were linearized at a unique ClaI restriction site located in the 5′ region of the LEU2 gene locus and transformed into the Δsu g null mutant using the protocol described by Knop et al. (28Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), and leucine-positive transformants were selected. Mitochondria were isolated from each of the transformants, and the expression and mitochondrial localization of the Su g derivatives were verified by Western blotting using an antibody specific for the HA epitope (Covance Research Products) or Su g antiserum (6Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Growth Curve Analysis—All strains were initially grown overnight at 30 °C in YPG medium supplemented with 0.2% galactose and histidine (0.06 mg/ml) and leucine (0.26 mg/ml). The cells were inoculated in the same medium at an A580 nm of 0.2, and growth of the cells was monitored by measuring the A580 nm at 2-h intervals over a period of 10 h. rho0/rho– Cell Conversion Detection Assay—All yeast strains were maintained on YPG plates and were used to inoculate YP-lactate (0.5% lactate) supplemented with 2% galactose and allowed to grow overnight at 30 °C. The A580 nm of the overnight cultures was measured, and an equivalent number of cells from each culture was plated onto YPD (2% glucose) or YPG (3% glycerol, supplemented with 0.1% galactose) plates. After incubation at 30 °C, the colonies were counted, and the number of rho0/rho– cells (i.e. petite cells) was calculated and expressed as a % of total colonies on the YPD plate. Chemical Cross-linking of Su g Protein with 5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic Acid) (DTNB)—Isolated mitochondria (100 μg of protein) were resuspended in SH buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Cross-linking was performed on ice for 30 min in the presence of the sulfhydryl-specific homobifunctional reagent DTNB ((0.2 mm). After quenching with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide and 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, mitochondria were re-isolated by centrifugation, lysed in the presence of SDS-containing sample buffer (without β-mercaptoethanol), and cooked at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 16% acrylamide, 0.6% bisacrylamide gel followed by Western blotting (10Brunner S. Everard-Gigot V. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48484-48489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Miscellaneous—Protein determinations and SDS-PAGE were performed according to published methods (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214131) Google Scholar, 30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206271) Google Scholar). The Western blot analysis and antibody decoration were performed using available Su e, Su g, and Su k antisera raised against peptides corresponding to the C-terminal region of each of the proteins, respectively (6Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The F1-antibody was raised in chicken after injection of purified yeast F1-sector and was obtained from Dr. David Mueller (The Chicago Medical School). Clear native-PAGE analysis of F1F0-ATP synthase complexes after solubilization with digitonin was performed essentially as described previously (15Everard-Gigot V. Dunn C.D. Dolan B.M. Brunner S. Jensen R.E. Stuart R.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Expression of the Mutated Su g Proteins—We adopted a cysteine mutagenesis and cross-linking approach to identifying proteins that may interact with Su g and also address the functional significance of the GXXXG motif in Su g. Su g contains one Cys residue at position 75, which is located in the matrix-exposed, hydrophilic region of Su g (Fig. 1A). We introduced an additional Cys residue into the C terminus of Su g, close to the transmembrane region and the conserved GXXXG motif. Two Su g mutants, Su gY112C and Su gV110C, were created whereby the Tyr and Val residues at positions 112 and 110 (Fig. 1, A and B) were individually mutated to Cys residues. We specifically chose to introduce the Cys residue into the C-terminal region of Su g as we wanted to analyze if Su g is in close proximity to Su e. Su e contains a unique Cys residue (Cys-27) immediately C-terminal to its membrane anchor segment, i.e. located in the intermembrane space, a position similar to that of the introduced Cys residues (V110C and Y112C) of Su g. The two resulting Su g derivatives, Su gY112C and Su gV110C, were cloned either in the absence or presence of an additional C-terminal hemagglutinin tag (HA tag) (Su gY112CHA and Su gV110CHA, respectively) and were expressed in a yeast su g null mutant. As a control we also expressed the wild-type Su g protein (i.e. no additional Cys residues) with the C-terminal HA tag, Su gHA. Mitochondria were isolated from the resulting transformants, and the presence of the Su g derivatives was verified using either Su g- or HA-specific antiserum, as appropriate (Fig. 1C). The derivatives Su gY112C (Fig. 1C) and in particular the Su gV110C (results not shown) were poorly recognized by the Su g antisera, in contrast to the Su gY112CHA and Su gV110CHA derivatives, which were clearly detectable with the HA antiserum (Fig. 1C). Because the existing Su g antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 13 amino acid residues (residues 103–115, respectively), it is possible that mutation of Tyr-112 or Val-110 to a Cys residue may have adversely affected the ability of the epitope to be recognized by the Su g antibody. The steady state levels of both Su gY112CHA and Su gV110CHA were similar to those of the wild-type HA-tagged construct. We, therefore, conclude that the alteration of residues Val-110 or Tyr-112 to cysteine did not hinder the mitochondrial targeting or stability of the Su g protein. The steady state levels of other F0-sector subunits, such as Su e, Su k, and Su 4 proteins did not appear to be affected by the expression of the HA-tagged or mutated derivatives of the Su g protein (Fig. 1C). The levels of these proteins each appeared to be similar to those of wild-type mitochondria, thus demonstrating the assembly of the F0-sector subunits was not hindered through the expression of the mutated Su g derivatives. In addition, growth curve analysis indicated that the strains harboring the Cys-modified Su g derivatives grew in a similar manner as the control wild-type strain on a non-fermentable carbon source, e.g. glycerol (Table I). As previously described the su g null strain, Δsu g, displayed a slightly slower growth phenotype under these conditions (6Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H.

In most cell types, the predominant form ofNF-κB is the p50:p65 heterodimer. NF-κB dimers are retained in thecytoplasm of unstimulated cells in an inactive state by binding to a family ofinhibitory IκB proteins. In human lymphoblastoid cells, NF-κB activation in response to IFN isassociated with promoting cell survival(4Yang C.H. Murti A. Basu L. Kim J.G. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent studies with normalfibroblasts and NF-κB knock-out fibroblasts demonstrate that a subset ofIFN-stimulated genes is regulated through an NF-κB-dependent pathway andthat NF-κB regulates the sensitivity of cells to IFN-mediated antiviralactivity (6Pfeffer L.M.

To further characterize NF-κB activation by IFN, we examined thecross-talk between the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and NF-κB activationin human fibrosarcoma cell lines with defined defects in the IFNα/βsignaling pathway. The parental 2fTGH cell line is sensitive to gene inductionby IFNα/β, whereas JAK1-deficient (U4A) mutant cells areIFN-nonresponsive (7Muller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A.

IFNinduces NF-κB activation in JAK1-deficient (U4A) cells and in theparental fibrosarcoma cells (2fTGH). In contrast, IFN induces STAT activationin 2fTGH cells but not in the JAK1-deficient cells. IFN induction ofNF-κB activity in JAK1-deficient cells involves the TYK2 tyrosinekinase. These results demonstrate a clear distinction between the signalingcomponents in the JAK-STAT pathway and the NF-κB signaling pathway.

To define the presenceof specific STAT or Rel proteins in DNA-protein complexes, nuclear extractswere incubated with anti-STAT or anti-Rel antibodies at 25 °C for 20 minprior to EMSA. Gels were quantitated by phosphorimaging autoradiography(Packard). Immunoblot Analysis—For immunoblotting, cells were treatedwith IFNα (1,000 IU/ml) at 37 °C for the indicated periods of timeand lysed directly in sample buffer(4Yang C.H. Murti A. Basu L. Kim J.G.

Samples were run onSDS-7.5% PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes(Millipore). To define the effect of IFN on STAT tyrosine phosphorylation,membranes were probed with immunoaffinity-purified anti-STAT1, anti-STAT2,anti-STAT3, anti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr-701), anti-phospho-STAT2 (Tyr-689), oranti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr-705) (dilution 1:1000, Upstate Biotechnology). ForTYK2 analysis, total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting forphospho-TYK2 (Cell Signaling), TYK2 (Upstate Biotechnology), and actin (SantaCruz Biotechnology). Blots were incubated with anti-IgG coupled to horseradishperoxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and developed using enhancedchemiluminescence (ECL) with the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescentsubstrate (Pierce). Transcriptional Assays—For gene reporter assays, cells weretransiently transfected by electroporation with the IRF-1 3×GAS-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid containing threecopies of the SIE site from the IRF-1 gene (provided by Drs. V.Viggiano and H. Young, National Cancer Institute-Fredrick Research Cancer andDevelopment Center), the pUX-CAT 3×HLAκB CAT reporter constructcontaining three tandemly repeated copies of the NF-κB site from theHLA-B7 gene (12Oliviera I.C. Mukaida N. Matsushiam K. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5300-5308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), orthe corresponding promoter-less CAT construct. After 48 h, the cells weretreated with IFNα (1,000 units/ml) for 4 h and assayed for CAT activity.Acetylated and unacetylated [14C]chloramphenicol were separated bythin layer chromatography, and radioactivity was measured by phosphorimagingautoradiography (Packard). IFN Induces STAT Activation in Parental 2fTGH Cells but Not inJAK1- Mutant Fibrosarcoma Cells—The JAK1 andTYK2 tyrosine kinases mediate the tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic STATproteins, which is essential for their nuclear translocation and DNA bindingactivity. For example, upon IFNα-induced phosphorylation, STAT1 andSTAT2 dimerize, complex with the DNA-binding protein IRF-9, and translocateinto the nucleus to bind to the IFN-stimulus response element ofIFN-stimulated genes and activate gene transcription. The tyrosinephosphorylation of STAT3 is essential for its DNA binding activity toSIE-dependent responsive genes. Lysates prepared from control orIFNα-treated 2fTGH and JAK1-deficient (JAK1-) cells wereimmunoblotted with immunoaffinity-purified anti-STAT antibodies and anti-STATphosphospecific antibodies. As shown inFig. 1, IFN induces thetyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 in 2fTGH cells but not inthe JAK1- cells (Fig.1). IFN treatment also induced DNA binding activity attributableto STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 in 2fTGH cells but not in the JAK1-mutant cells (data not shown). These results are not unexpected since bothJAK1 and TYK2 are required to transduce the signal that leads to STATphosphorylation, STAT dimerization, STAT translocation, and subsequentSTAT-mediated gene induction(3Darnell J.E.J. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar,7Muller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G.

IFN Induces NF-κB DNA Binding Activity in Parental 2fTGH Cellsand JAK1- Mutant Fibrosarcoma Cells—In diverse cells,IFNα/β promotes NF-κB DNA binding activity with cell typedifferences in the specific composition of the IFN-induced Rel/NF-κBcomplexes (4Yang C.H. Murti A. Basu L. Kim J.G. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13631-13636Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For example,p50/c-Rel complexes are induced by IFN in human lymphoblastoid cells, whereasp50/p65 complexes are induced in mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells. To determinewhether IFNs also promoted NF-κB activation in human fibrosarcoma cells,cells were stimulated with IFNα, nuclear extracts were prepared, andNF-κB activation was examined by EMSA. Nuclear extracts from untreatedcells show little constitutive binding to a consensus κB oligonucleotideprobe (Fig. 2). However, IFNinduced NF-κB activity in both 2fTGH and JAK1- cells. DNAbinding to the probe was not detected in the presence of excess NF-κBoligonucleotide, indicating that the binding to the DNA probe was specific.Supershift assays with Rel-specific antisera demonstrated that p50 and p65,but not c-Rel, were present in the IFN-induced NF-κB complexes in bothparental and JAK1- cells (Fig.2). These results were somewhat surprising since JAK1-cells are nonresponsive to IFN as determined by STAT tyrosine phosphorylationand DNA-protein binding assays. To further characterize the induction of NF-κB activity in theJAK1- cells, we examined the time course of IFN induction ofNF-κB binding activity. As shown inFig. 3A, nuclearextracts from untreated cells (0 time) show low constitutive binding to aconsensus κB oligonucleotide probe. IFN increased NF-κB binding inJAK1- cells within 5 min after IFN treatment, with high DNA bindingobserved from 15 to 60 min after IFN addition that returned to near basallevels by 120 min. The time course of NF-κB activation is highly similarto that previously reported for IFN-mediated NF-κB activation in humanlymphoblastoid cells and in mouse embryo fibroblasts(4Yang C.H. Murti A.

IFN has biologic efficacyat extremely low concentrations; for example, 1 unit/ml (∼10-13m) IFN is defined by the ability to inhibit virus infection by 50%.Therefore, we next examined the IFN concentration-dependent induction ofNF-κB activation in the JAK1- cells. As shown inFig. 3B, a clearinduction of DNA binding activity is observed at 10 units/ml of IFN, and adose-dependent increase in DNA binding activity was observed at the range ofIFN concentrations tested. These results show that the induction ofNF-κB activity in the JAK1- cells occurs at physiologicallyrelevant IFN concentrations. The Role of Tyrosine and Serine Protein Kinases in IFN-dependentNF-κB Activation in U4A Cells—The JAK-mediated tyrosinephosphorylation pathway is an integral element in IFN-mediated signaltransduction in general.

To characterize the roleof protein kinases in JAK1-independent NF-κB activation, U4A cells weretreated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, the PI3K inhibitorLY294002, or protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine. As shown inFig. 3C, treatmentwith either genistein or LY294002 blocked induction of NF-κB activity byIFN in JAK1-defective cells. However, staurosporine did not block NF-κBactivation by IFN. This result is surprising since staurosporine blocksIFN-induced biological events mediated not only by protein kinase C but alsoby tyrosine kinases (15Pfeffer L.M. Eisenkraft B.L. Reich N.C.

The Effect of JAK1-independent Signaling on NF-κB andSIE-dependent Reporter Constructs—To determine the functionalconsequences of IFN-induced STAT and NF-κB activation, we examined theeffect of IFN on the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and SIE-dependentCAT reporter constructs. 2fTGH and U4A mutant cells were transfected with theIRF-1 3× GAS-CAT reporter construct containing three copies of the SIEsite from the IRF-1 gene, the pUX-CAT 3×HLAκB CATreporter construct containing three tandemly repeated copies of theNF-κB site from the HLA-B7 gene, or the correspondingpromoter-less CAT construct. At 2 days after transfection, the cells weretreated with IFN and assayed for CAT activity. As shown inFig. 4, whereas IFN treatmenthad no effect on the control CAT reporter construct (empty vector(EV)), IFN treatment of 2fTGH cells resulted in a marked enhancementin the transcriptional activity of both the IRF-1 3× GAS-CAT and the3×HLAκB reporter constructs, 4- and 6-fold respectively. Incontrast, IFN treatment of U4A cells resulted in enhanced transcriptionalactivity of 3×HLAκB reporter (∼3.5-fold) but not of the IRF-13× GAS-CAT reporter construct. These results demonstrate that IFNinduced NF-κB-dependent gene transcription in JAK1- cells butdid not affect STAT-dependent gene transcription in these mutant cells.Therefore, IFN-induced NF-κB-driven gene transcription isJAK1-independent, whereas IFN-induced SIE-driven gene transcription isJAK1-dependent. These results parallel our findings on DNA binding activity,i.e. IFN-induced NF-κB activity is JAK1-independent, butIFN-induced SIE activity is JAK1-dependent. NF-κB Activation in JAK1-deficient Cells IsTYK2-dependent—Since JAK1- mutant cells contain TYK2,one possibility is that NF-κB is activated through a TYK2-dependentpathway. To determine the role of TYK2 in NF-κB activation by IFN,TYK2-deficient U1A fibrosarcoma cells were treated with IFNα, nuclearextracts were prepared, and NF-κB activation was examined by EMSA. Asshown in Fig. 5, IFN treatmentfailed to promote NF-κB activation in these TYK2 mutant cells. Incontrast, IFN induced NF-κB activity in JAK1-deficient U4A cells. Theseresults taken together demonstrate that TYK2, but not JAK1, is required forIFN-induced NF-κB activation To further analyze the role of TYK2 in JAK1-independent NF-κBactivation, U4A cells were transiently transfected with TYK2 or akinase-inactive form of TYK2 (KD-TYK2), in which the invariant lysine atposition 930 of the ATP binding site was substituted with an arginine. At 48 hafter transfection, the U4A cells were stimulated with IFNα, nuclearextracts were prepared, and NF-κB activation was examined by EMSA. Asshown in Fig. 6A, IFNinduces NF-κB activation in U4A cells transfected with either emptyvector or a vector encoding TYK2. In contrast, transfection with thekinase-inactive K930R (KD-TYK2) construct completely abrogated IFN-dependentNF-κB activation in JAK1-deficient cells. In addition, extracts fromtransiently transfected cells were immunoblotted with antibodies against TYK2and phospho-TYK2. As shown in Fig.6B, although KD-TYK2 and TYK2 were expressed at similarlevels in transiently transfected U4A cells, IFN induced tyrosinephosphorylation of TYK2 in cells overexpressing TYK2 but not in cellsoverexpressing KD-TYK2. Moreover, the low endogenous level of IFN-induced TYK2tyrosine phosphorylation was abrogated by expression of KD-TYK2 (compareIFN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TYK2 in empty vector-transfected cellsversus KD-TYK2-transfected cells inFig. 6B, upperpanel), demonstrating that KD-TYK2 exhibits dominant-negative effects onendogenous TYK2. These results demonstrate that NF-κB activation by IFNin JAK1-deficient cells is TYK2-dependent.

As shown in Fig.6C and consistent with the findings in U4A cells, IFNinduces NF-κB activation in cells transfected with either empty vectoror TYK2. However, transfection with KD-TYK2 completely blocked IFN-inducedNF-κB activation in Daudi cells. Moreover, KD-TYK2 blocked the inductionby IFN of TYK2 phosphorylation (Fig.6D) and of STAT-dependent DNA binding activity in Daudicells (data not shown), indicating that KD-TYK2 functions in adominant-negative manner for several signaling events induced by IFN. The major conclusion of the present work is that IFN produces biologicallyrelevant signals that are independent of the “classical” JAK-STATsignaling pathway. We show that IFN activates NF-κB through aTYK2-dependent but a JAK1-independent pathway. We have previously shown thatIFNα/β activates NF-κB in diverse cell types derived fromseveral animal species, and we have extensively characterized the pathwayinvolved in NF-κB activation by IFN. In human lymphoblastoid cells,NF-κB activation by IFN protects the cells from death induced byapoptotic stimuli including that of IFN itself(4Yang C.H. Murti A. Basu L. Kim J.G. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13631-13636Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The IFN signaling pathwayleading to NF-κB activation involves the tyrosinephosphorylation-dependent association of STAT3 with the IFN receptor,resulting in the activation of a serine kinase cascade through PI3K and Akt(5Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer S.R. Kim J.G. Donner D.B. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13756-13761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Consistent with thesefindings are the present findings that the pharmacologic inhibitors of PI3Kand tyrosine kinases block the JAK1-independent activation of NF-κB byIFN. In common with a wide variety of cytokines and growth factors,IFNα/β activates a JAK-STAT intracellular signaling pathway. IFNactivation of JAKs results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of IFN receptorsubunits to which the STATs bind. In turn, STATs becometyrosine-phosphorylated, dimerize, and translocate into the nucleus toregulate gene transcription. However, our results demonstrate a dichotomybetween the signaling components required in the classical JAK-STAT pathwayand in the NF-κB signaling pathway. In the well described IFN signalingpathway leading to STAT activation, both JAK1 and TYK2 are required forsignaling, whereas NF-κB activation appears to be TYK2-dependent butJAK1-independent. In the parental 2fTGH fibrosarcoma cell line, IFN inducesthe activation of STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 as determined by DNA binding assaysand by immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies. However, inJAK1- cells, these STAT proteins are not activated in DNA bindingassays or in immunoblots. The strict requirement for both JAK1 and TYK2 isconsistent with previous studies(7Muller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G. Witthuhn B.A. Schindler C. Pellegrini S. Wilks A.F. Ihle J.N. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M.

Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In contrast, NF-κB is activated by IFN in parental 2fTGH cells andJAK1-deficient mutant cells, indicating that there is a JAK1-independentpathway leading to NF-κB activation. NF-κB activation by IFN inJAK1-deficient cells was demonstrated by EMSA with a κB-specificoligonucleotide probe and by using a κB-dependent reporter construct.The time course of induction of NF-κB and dependence on IFNconcentration was similar to previous reports using human and murine cellstreated with IFN. This suggests that the JAK1-independent NF-κBsignaling pathway activated by IFN may function in many cell types. AlthoughNF-κB activation is JAK1-independent, this pathway appears to betyrosine kinase- and PI3K-dependent since pharmacological inhibitors of thesepathways blocked it. The role of PI3K and tyrosine kinase in IFN-induced NF-κB activationhas been previously demonstrated in human lymphoblastoid cells. SinceJAK1- mutant cells contain TYK2, we examined whether NF-κB isactivated through a TYK2-dependent pathway. Expression of the catalyticallyinactive K930R mutant of TYK2(9Gauzzi M.C. Velazquez L.

These results demonstrate that catalyticallyactive TYK2 is required not only in cells that are deficient in JAK1 but alsoin cells in which NF-κB has been previously demonstrated to function ina cell survival pathway. Moreover, our results demonstrate that KD-TYK2functions as a dominant-negative for IFN signal transduction involvingNF-κB, as well as the activation of STAT proteins. Under diverse experimental conditions, IFNα has been found toefficiently induce cell death, as well as protect cells against apoptoticsignals (4Yang C.H. Murti A. Basu L. Kim J.G. Pfeffer L.M. Proc.

However, whereas themolecular mechanisms underlying the anti-apoptotic/apoptotic signals inducedby IFN are unclear, both the JAK-STAT and the NF-κB signaling pathwayshave been implicated (4Yang C.H.

In human lymphoblastoidcells, NF-κB activation is mediated by the tyrosinephosphorylation-dependent association of STAT3 with the IFN receptor and thesubsequent activation of PI3K(5Yang C.H. Murti A.

It is tempting tospeculate that this IFN-induced PI3K/Akt signaling pathway leading toNF-κB-mediated cell survival requires TYK2 but is JAK1-independent.Nonetheless, taken together, our results demonstrate a dichotomy between thesignaling components required in the classical JAK-STAT pathway and in theNF-κB/anti-apoptotic pathway. In the signaling pathway leading to STATactivation, JAK1 is required, whereas NF-κB activation appears to beJAK1-independent but TYK2-dependent. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2048757284,"The flow of information across the retina is controlled by reciprocal synapses between bipolar cell terminals and amacrine cells. However, the synaptic delays and properties of plasticity at these synapses are not known. Here we report that glutamate release from goldfish Mb-type bipolar cell terminals can trigger fast (delay of 2–3 ms) and transient GABAA IPSCs and a much slower and more sustained GABAC feedback. Synaptically released glutamate activated mGluR1 receptors on amacrine cells and, depending on the strength of presynaptic activity, potentiated subsequent feedback. This poststimulus enhancement of GABAergic feedback lasted for up to 10 min. This form of mGluR1-mediated long-term synaptic plasticity may provide retinal reciprocal synapses with adaptive capabilities."

Despite the ubiquitous expression of ClC-2, the exact physiological role ofthis Cl- channel remains uncertain and has not been thoroughlyinvestigated in the heart (2Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F.

A novel volume-regulatedchloride inward rectifier channel (Cl.ir), which is activated byhyperpolarization and cell swelling, was first discovered in native guinea pigand mouse cardiac atrial and ventricular myocytes(16Duan D. Ye L. Britton F. Horowitz B. Hume J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E63-E71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, similarCl.ir channels were found in rat cardiac myocytes(17Komukai K. Brette F.

Cardiac Cl.irchannels share many common properties with ClC-2 Cl- channels(3Thiemann A. Grunder S. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J.

The molecularexpression of ClC-2 channels in cardiac myocytes at both the mRNA and proteinlevels has been confirmed in several species, including rabbit, rat, guineapig, mouse, and dog (9Furukawa T.

Britton F. Horowitz B. Hume J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E63-E71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we first cloned a full-length cDNA for ClC-2 from rat heart(rClC-2) and characterized the expressed channels at both whole-cell andsingle-channel levels in a mammalian cell line. More importantly, weidentified a novel alternative splice variant of ClC-2 in rat heart(rClC-2Δ509–523), which has a deletion at the beginningof exon 15 and results in a deletion of 15 amino acids in α-helices Oand P, without disruption of the ClC-2 protein reading frame. A similarpartial exon 15 skipping with a deletion of 105 bp (35 amino acids inα-helices O-Q, gpClC-2Δ509–543) was also found inguinea pig heart. When expressed in mammalian cells, bothrClC-2Δ509–523 andgpClC-2Δ509–543 yielded functional channels withphenotypic activation kinetics and volume-sensitive properties different fromthose of the non-deletion form of rClC-2, but very similar to those ofendogenous Cl.ir channels in rat and guinea pig heart, respectively.Therefore, our results suggest that endogenous Cl.ir channels in nativecardiac cells may be formed by novel ClC-2 variants together with thefull-length ClC-2. Cloning of ClC-2 cDNA from Heart—ClC-2 cDNAs were clonedfrom rat and guinea pig cardiac muscle by PCR using specific primers (UP1/DN1)that span the entire coding region of the ClC-2 protein (GenBank™accession numbers X64139 and AF113529;Table I). Total RNA wasisolated from heart using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared usingSuperscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen).

Primer pair F1/R1amplifies either a 744- or 699-bp product, depending on the splice variantpresent. Primer pair F2/R1 amplifies either a 388- or 343-bp product. PCR wasperformed on rat heart cDNA and also on the plasmid clones containing onerClC-2 variant or the other (rClC-2 andrClC-2Δ509–523). To determine the relative expressionlevels of ClC-2 splice variants in rat heart, real-time quantitative PCR wasperformed with the use of SYBR Green chemistry as described previously(21Britton F.C. Ohya S. Horowitz B. Greenwood I.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Quantitative PCR primers(Table I) were designed so thatprimers ClC-2-QF1/R1 amplify both forms of rClC-2; primers ClC-2-QF2/R1amplify only the full-length form of rClC-2 and not the alternatively splicedvariant because the forward primer was designed to hybridize within thedeleted region of the variant. Standard curves were generated for rClC-2amplification and the constitutively expressed glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase (GAPDH) from regression analysis of the mean values of RT-PCRsfor the log10 diluted cDNA. Unknown quantities relative to thestandard curve for rClC-2 were calculated, yielding transcriptionalquantitation of rClC-2 cDNA relative to the endogenous standard (GAPDH). Theexpression level of rClC-2 deletion variant was determined by subtractingindividual values for paired samples of both ClC-2 forms and full-length ClC-2only. Each cDNA sample was tested in triplicate, and cDNA was obtained foreach tissue from five different animals. The reproducibility of the assay wastested by analysis of variance comparing repeat runs of samples, and meanvalues generated at individual time points were compared by Student'st test. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prismversion 3 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Expression of Cardiac ClC-2 in NIH/3T3 MammalianCells—Full-length or spliced ClC-2 cDNAs cloned into the mammalianexpression vector pDNA3.1 were either transiently or permanently transfectedinto NIH/3T3 cells by electroporation or Lipofectamine 2000 as describedpreviously (22Duan D.

Briefly, for transienttransfection, NIH/3T3 cells were harvested by trypsin-EDTA and resuspended ata density of 1 × 106 cells/0.2 ml in an electroporationcuvette (Invitrogen) containing 20 μg of pcDNA3.1/ClC-2 vector and greenfluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid (5 μg), as a marker for transfection.After a 10-min incubation on ice, cells were electroporated by applying a330-V pulse using a pulse generator (Electroporator II; Invitrogen). Forpermanent transfection, ClC-2 cDNAs in the expression vector pcDNA3.1 weretransfected into NIH/3T3 cells by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according tothe manufacturer's protocol. Stable transfectants were selected with 1 g/literG418 (Invitrogen). G418-resistant clones were isolated, expanded, andmaintained.

A thoracotomy was then performed, theheart was quickly removed, and the aorta was cannulated. The heart wasretrogradely perfused first with a modified HEPES-buffered Tyrode solution at37 °C, then perfused with a nominally Ca2+-free Tyrode solution(until the heart ceased to beat), and finally perfused with the same solutioncontaining 0.04% collagenase (Type II; Sigma) and 1.0% bovine serum albuminfor 10–15 min. The left ventricle was removed and further dissected intosmall pieces, and cell dissociation was achieved by gentle mechanicalagitation in the cell storage solution. Only Ca2+-tolerantquiescent myocytes with a typical rod-shaped form and clear cross-striationswere used for experiments.

The voltage clampprotocols used in different experiments are described under“Results” and in the figure legends. Experiments were conducted atroom temperature (22–24 °C). Solutions and Drugs—The standard hypotonic external bathsolutions used in the electrophysiological recordings in the NIH/3T3 cellscontained 125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2, 250 mosmol/kgH2O, [Cl-]o = 135 mm).The standard isotonic (300 mosmol/kg H2O) and hypertonic (350mosmol/kg H2O) solutions were the same as hypotonic solution,except the osmolarity was adjusted using mannitol. The pipette solution forcell-attached recordings contained 135 mmN-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG)-Cl, 5 mm HEPES, and5.5 mm glucose (pH 7.2, pipette Cl- concentration([Cl-]p) = 135 mm). The pipettesolution for whole-cell recordings contained 135 mm NMDG-Cl, 5mm MgATP, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2,[Cl-]i = 135 mm, 300 mosmol/kgH2O using mannitol). In the electrophysiological recordings incardiac myocytes, nisoldipine (1 μm), 4-aminopyridine (2mm), BaCl2 (2 mm), and CsCl (10mm) were consistently present in the extracellular bath solutions,and cations in the intracellular pipette solutions were replaced with thelarge non-permeable NMDG to prevent contamination from Ca2+ andK+ currents and the cationic inward currentsIK1 and If. The standard hypotonicextracellular bath solutions contained 100 mm NaCl, 10mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 2 mm BaCl2, 0.33 mmNaH2PO4, and 5.0 mm HEPES (pH 7.2, 230mosmol/kg H2O, [Cl-]o = 118mm). The standard isotonic (290 mosmol/kg H2O) andhypertonic (360 mosmol/kg H2O) solutions were the same as hypotonicsolution, except the osmolarity was adjusted using mannitol. The standardpipette solution for whole-cell recordings contained 118 mmNMDG-Cl, 5 mm MgATP, 0.1 mm NaGTP, 5 mm EGTA,and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4, [Cl-]i = 118mm, 290 mosmol/kg H2O using mannitol). In someexperiments in the rat ventricular myocytes, the bath solutions contained 100mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2,1.8 mm CaCl2, 2.0 mm BaCl2, 0.33mm NaH2PO4, and 5.0 mm HEPES (pH7.4, 230 mosmol/kg H2O, [Cl-]o = 115mm). The pipette solution contained 113 mm NMDG-Cl, 5mm MgATP, 0.1 mm NaGTP, 5 mm EGTA, and 5mm HEPES (pH 7.4, [Cl-]i = 113mm, 290 mosmol/kg H2O using mannitol). For intracellulardialysis experiments in NIH/3T3 cells and cardiac myocytes, anti-ClC-2antibody (Ab) (Alomone Labs) was diluted in double-distilled water to 300μg/ml and added into the pipette solution (final concentration, 3μg/ml). The anti-ClC-2 Ab was generated against a peptide corresponding toamino acids 808–906 of rClC-2 protein and shares no homology to otherClC channel proteins. For pre-absorbed anti-ClC-2 Ab, Ab and antigen peptide(rClC-2888–906) were dissolved separately, mixed in a ratioof 1:3, stored in the refrigerator overnight or at room temperature for >1h, and added to the pipette solution to achieve a final concentration of Aband antigen of 3 and 9 μg/ml, respectively. The osmolarity of the pipettedialysis solutions was not significantly altered by inclusion of either Abalone or pre-absorbed Ab. Data Analysis—Group data are presented as mean ± S.E.Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance. Atwo-tailed probability (p) of ≤5% was considered significant. Cloning of ClC-2 Channels from Rat Heart—To test whethernative Cl.ir channels in the heart are encoded by ClC-2, it was necessary tofirst clone the full-length cDNA for ClC-2 from cardiac tissues. AlthoughThiemann et al. (3Thiemann A. Grunder S. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar)cloned ClC-2 from both heart and brain of rat, only brain ClC-2 was sequencedand expressed in oocytes. It is therefore not known whether the functionalcharacteristics of heart ClC-2 are the same as those of brain ClC-2 in rat. Infact, short isoforms of ClC-2 mRNA transcript truncated at the C terminus dueto alternative splicing were identified in multiple tissues in rat(4Chu S. Murray C.B. Liu M.M. Zeitlin P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3453-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Using RT-PCR, we clonedthe putative full-length cDNA of ClC-2 from rat heart (rClC-2), which had99.4% homology to the previously reported brain ClC-2(3Thiemann A. Grunder S. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The 0.6% divergence at thenucleotide level did not result in any differences in the ClC-2 protein(Fig. 1). Identification of ClC-2 Splice Variants in Rat Heart—Whenthe isolated rat heart ClC-2 cDNA clones were sequenced, a short isoform ofrClC-2 with a deletion of 45 bp (15 amino acids, Δ509–523),corresponding to transmembrane-spanning α-helices O and P(2Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar), was identified(Fig. 1).Fig. 1A shows a modelof ClC channel topology with 18 α-helical regions (helices A-R) derivedfrom the three-dimensional crystal structure of bacterial ClC protein (adoptedfrom Dutzler et al., Ref.38Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 415: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). The α-helices O-R(outlined in boxes) and the corresponding amino acid sequences ofcardiac ClC-2 in this region are expanded inFig. 1B. The 15-aminoacid deletion present in rClC-2Δ509–523 is shown asXs. PCR was performed on rat heart cDNA and on the isolated ClC-2cDNA clones to further characterize the deletion in rat cardiac ClC-2. PCRprimers were designed so that they bind in a region encompassing the 45-bpdeletion in ClC-2, thus generating a 45-bp size difference in theamplification products. Primer pair F1/R1 amplifies either a 744- or 699-bpproduct, whereas primer pair F2/R1 amplifies either a 388- or 343-bp product(Fig. 1C). Both ClC-2variants are present in rat heart cDNA, verifying the authenticity of thedeletion. PCR performed on the isolated cDNA clones indicates the presence ofone ClC-2 variant or the other (note the size difference of the PCR productsin Fig. 1C). The PCRproducts were sequenced to confirm the presence of the deletion. The sequenceof rClC-2Δ509–523 was compared with the genomicsequence of rat ClC-2 previously determined by Chu and Zeitlin(5Chu S. Zeitlin P.L. NucleicAcids Res. 1997; 25: 4153-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We found that the 45-bpdeletion (Δ509–523) occurred right at the beginning of exon 15.This deletion is not a complete “exon signature” alternativesplicing event because it skipped only a portion of exon 15, which is 214 bplong. It may represent a new ClC-2 spliced isoform that has not been reportedbefore in any other tissues of the rat(4Chu S. Murray C.B. Liu M.M. Zeitlin P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3453-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,5Chu S. Zeitlin P.L. NucleicAcids Res. 1997; 25: 4153-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,29Varela D. Niemeyer M.I. Cid L.P. Sepulveda F.V. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ClC-2 expression in ratheart was further analyzed by the use of real-time quantitative RT-PCR(Fig. 1D). Therelative transcriptional expression levels of rClC-2 splice variants in ratheart relative to GAPDH (in arbitrary units) were calculated to be 0.018± 0.003 for rClC-2 and 0.028 ± 0.006 forrClC-2Δ509–523 (n = 5, p =nonsignificant). Functional Expression of Cardiac rClC-2 Channels in MammalianNIH/3T3 Cells—To examine the functional properties of thecloned cardiac ClC-2 channels, both full-length and deleted forms of ClC-2cDNA were heterologously expressed in mammalian NIH/3T3 cells. We first used the whole-cell patch clamp technique to examine thefunctional expression of full-length rClC-2 channels in NIH/3T3 cells(Fig. 2). To identify therClC-2-transfected cells, the pcDNA3.1CT-GFP vector was co-transfected viaelectroporation. Cells expressing GFP were visualized at 24–48 h using aZeiss inverted fluorescent microscope with a fluorescein isothiocyanate cube.Large inwardly rectifying currents were activated upon hyperpolarization andcell swelling in cells transfected with rClC-2/GFP(Fig. 2A). Theactivation of rClC-2 was fit by a bi-exponential time course with a fastcomponent (τ1) and a slow component (τ2)(Fig. 2A, d).Cell swelling not only significantly increased the amplitude of the currentbut also accelerated the activation kinetics(Fig. 2A, d).These properties of the expressed rClC-2 current were generally similar tothose of expressed brain rClC-2 current in oocytes(3Thiemann A. Grunder S. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar,30Grunder S. Thiemann A. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) or mammalian cells(12Park K. Arreola J. Begenisich T. Melvin J.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but the activationkinetics (Table II) aresignificantly slower than endogenous Cl.ir current in the heart(16Duan D. Ye L. Britton F.
