https://openalex.org/W2890369934,"Background For individuals with recurrent or persistent non-specific low back pain (LBP), exercise and exercise combined with education have been shown to be effective in preventing new episodes or in reducing the impact of the condition. Chiropractors have traditionally used Maintenance Care (MC), as secondary and tertiary prevention strategies. The aim of this trial was to investigate the effectiveness of MC on pain trajectories for patients with recurrent or persistent LBP. Method This pragmatic, investigator-blinded, two arm randomized controlled trial included consecutive patients (18–65 years old) with non-specific LBP, who had an early favorable response to chiropractic care. After an initial course of treatment, eligible subjects were randomized to either MC or control (symptom-guided treatment). The primary outcome was total number of days with bothersome LBP during 52 weeks collected weekly with text-messages (SMS) and estimated by a GEE model. Results Three hundred and twenty-eight subjects were randomly allocated to one of the two treatment groups. MC resulted in a reduction in the total number of days per week with bothersome LBP compared with symptom-guided treatment. During the 12 month study period, the MC group (n = 163, 3 dropouts) reported 12.8 (95% CI = 10.1, 15.5; p = <0.001) fewer days in total with bothersome LBP compared to the control group (n = 158, 4 dropouts) and received 1.7 (95% CI = 1.8, 2.1; p = <0.001) more treatments. Numbers presented are means. No serious adverse events were recorded. Conclusion MC was more effective than symptom-guided treatment in reducing the total number of days over 52 weeks with bothersome non-specific LBP but it resulted in a higher number of treatments. For selected patients with recurrent or persistent non-specific LBP who respond well to an initial course of chiropractic care, MC should be considered an option for tertiary prevention."

Fecal microbiota from mice housed in a control environment representing 2,200 meters (NC group) above sea level with 16% Oxygen and mice that were placed in a hypobaric chamber representing 5000 meters (HC group) above sea level with 11% Oxygen for 30 days, were analyzed by the HiSeq Illumina sequencing platform. The results showed a significant difference in beta diversity observed between the two groups, while no significant difference was observed in alpha diversity. Compared with the NC group, the relative abundance of class Epsilonproteobacteria, phlym Actinobacteria, class Erysipelotrichia and genus Helicobacter were significantly lower (P<0.05), while the relative abundance of genus Alistipes was increased in the HC group; Phenotypic analysis showed no significant difference in aerobic, anaerobic, facultatively anaerobic, potentially pathogenic, stress tolerant, mobile element, biofilms formation, gram negative and gram positive between HC group and NC group; Functional analysis results showed significant differences in 34 gene functional metabolic pathways (carbohydrate digestion and absorption, energy metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, etc) between HC group and NC group. Together, these findings suggest that exposure to high altitude and low oxygen had the potential to change the intestinal microbial communities, which potentially may modulate metabolic processes in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2890274053,"The recent development in the technology has increased the complexity of image contents and demand for image classification becomes more imperative. Digital images play a vital role in many applied domains such as remote sensing, scene analysis, medical care, textile industry and crime investigation. Feature extraction and image representation is considered as an important step in scene analysis as it affects the image classification performance. Automatic classification of images is an open research problem for image analysis and pattern recognition applications. The Bag-of-Features (BoF) model is commonly used to solve image classification, object recognition and other computer vision-based problems. In BoF model, the final feature vector representation of an image contains no information about the co-occurrence of features in the 2D image space. This is considered as a limitation, as the spatial arrangement among visual words in image space contains the information that is beneficial for image representation and learning of classification model. To deal with this, researchers have proposed different image representations. Among these, the division of image-space into different geometric sub-regions for the extraction of histogram for BoF model is considered as a notable contribution for the extraction of spatial clues. Keeping this in view, we aim to explore a Hybrid Geometric Spatial Image Representation (HGSIR) that is based on the combination of histograms computed over the rectangular, triangular and circular regions of the image. Five standard image datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed research. The quantitative analysis demonstrates that the proposed research outperforms the state-of-art research in terms of classification accuracy."

However, whether the downstream components of the Hippo pathway are involved in adipogenesis remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that the TEA domain family (TEAD) transcription factors are essential for adipogenesis in murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Knockdown of TEAD1–4 stimulated adipogenesis and increased the expression of adipocyte markers in these cells. Interestingly, we found that the TEAD4 knockdown–mediated adipogenesis proceeded in a Yes-associated protein (YAP)/TAZ (Wwtr1)–independent manner and that adipogenesis suppression in WT cells involved formation of a ternary complex comprising TEAD4 and the transcriptional cofactors C-terminal binding protein 2 (CtBP2) and vestigial-like family member 4 (VGLL4). VGLL4 acted as an adaptor protein that enhanced the interaction between TEAD4 and CtBP2, and this TEAD4–VGLL4–CtBP2 ternary complex dynamically existed at the early stage of adipogenesis. Finally, we verified that TEAD4 directly targets the promoters of major adipogenesis transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and adiponectin, C1Q, and collagen domain–containing (Adipoq) during adipogenesis. These findings reveal critical insights into the role of the TEAD4–VGLL4–CtBP2 transcriptional repressor complex in suppression of adipogenesis in murine preadipocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2890324379,"Starvation poses a fundamental challenge to cell survival. Whereas the role of autophagy in promoting energy homeostasis in this setting has been extensively characterized1, other mechanisms are less well understood. Here we reveal that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) inhibits coat protein I (COPI) transport by targeting a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) towards ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) to suppress COPI vesicle fission. GAPDH inhibits multiple other transport pathways, also by targeting ARF GAPs. Further characterization suggests that this broad inhibition is activated by the cell during starvation to reduce energy consumption. These findings reveal a remarkable level of coordination among the intracellular transport pathways that underlies a critical mechanism of cellular energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2761346762,"Determining the distribution of disease prevalence among heterogeneous populations at the national scale is fundamental for epidemiology and public health. Here, we use a combination of methods (spatial scan statistic, topological data analysis and epidemic profile) to study measurable differences in malaria intensity by regions and populations of Colombia. This study explores three main questions: What are the regions of Colombia where malaria is epidemic? What are the regions and populations in Colombia where malaria is endemic? What associations exist between epidemic outbreaks between regions in Colombia? Plasmodium falciparum is most prevalent in the Pacific Coast, some regions of the Amazon Basin, and some regions of the Magdalena Basin. Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent parasite in Colombia, particularly in the Northern Amazon Basin, the Caribbean, and municipalities of Sucre, Antioquia and Cordoba. We find an acute peak of malarial infection at 25 years of age. Indigenous and Afrocolombian populations experience endemic malaria (with household transmission). We find that Plasmodium vivax decreased in the most important hotspots, often with moderate urbanization rate, and was re-introduced to locations with moderate but sustained deforestation. Infection by Plasmodium falciparum, on the other hand, steadily increased in incidence in locations where it was introduced in the 2009-2010 generalized epidemic. Our findings suggest that Colombia is entering an unstable transmission state, where rapid decreases in one location of the country are interconnected with rapid increases in other parts of the country."
https://openalex.org/W2890327513,"Vascular calcification (or mineralization) is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is closely associated with increased mortality and morbidity rates. We recently reported that activation of the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) pathway through the saturated fatty acid (SFA)-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response plays a causative role in CKD-associated vascular calcification. Here, using mouse models of CKD, we 1) studied the contribution of the proapoptotic transcription factor CCAAT enhancer–binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) to CKD-dependent medial calcification, and 2) we identified an additional regulator of ER stress–mediated CHOP expression. Transgenic mice having smooth muscle cell (SMC)–specific CHOP expression developed severe vascular apoptosis and medial calcification under CKD. Screening of a protein kinase inhibitor library identified 16 compounds, including seven cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, that significantly suppressed CHOP induction during ER stress. Moreover, selective CDK9 inhibitors and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated CDK9 reduction blocked SFA-mediated induction of CHOP expression, whereas inhibitors of other CDK isoforms did not. Cyclin T1 knockout inhibited SFA-mediated induction of CHOP and mineralization, whereas deletion of cyclin T2 and cyclin K promoted CHOP expression levels and mineralization. Of note, the CDK9–cyclin T1 complex directly phosphorylated and activated ATF4. These results demonstrate that the CDK9–cyclin T1 and CDK9–cyclin T2/K complexes have opposing roles in CHOP expression and CKD-induced vascular calcification. They further reveal that the CDK9–cyclin T1 complex mediates vascular calcification through CHOP induction and phosphorylation-mediated ATF4 activation.

https://openalex.org/W2889825615,"Purpose Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy causes hypergastrinemia, which could promote the development and progression of pancreatic cancer. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate the association between PPI exposure and the risk of pancreatic cancer. Methods We conducted a twelve-year longitudinal population-based study (2002–2013) using the Korean National Health Insurance Corporation claims database merged with national health examination data. The study cohort included 453,655 cancer-free individuals in January 2007 (index date). Incident pancreatic cancer was assessed throughout follow up until December 2013. The exposure to PPIs before the index date was assessed using a standardized Defined Daily Dose (DDD) system. We calculated the hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for pancreatic cancer risk associated with cumulative PPI use using Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results There were 3,086 cases of pancreatic cancer during the period of 2,920,000 person-years. PPI users exceeding 60 DDDs were at a higher risk of pancreatic cancer compared with non-users (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.04–1.72). Subgroup analyses revealed that a significant association existed between PPI use and pancreatic cancer in low risk groups including individuals who were female, engaged in healthy lifestyle habits, and had no history of diabetes or chronic pancreatitis. Conclusion Exposure to PPI appears to increase the risk of pancreatic cancer, independent of conventional risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2890764580,"Members of microRNA-200 (miRNA-200) family have a regulatory role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) by suppressing Zeb1 and Zeb2 expression. Consistent with its role in suppressing EMT, Hsa-miR-200c-3p (miR-200c), a member of miR-200 family is poorly expressed in mesenchymal-like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and ectopic miR-200c expression suppresses cell migration. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-200c potently inhibited TNBC cell growth and tumor development in a mechanism distinct from its ability to downregulate Zeb1 and Zeb2 expression, because silencing them only marginally affected TNBC cell growth. We identified phosphodiesterase 7B (PDE7B) as a bona fide miR-200c target. Importantly, miR-200c-led inhibition in cell growth and tumor development was prevented by forcing PDE7B transgene expression, while knockdown of PDE7B effectively inhibited cell growth. These results suggest that miR-200c inhibits cell growth by targeting PDE7B mRNA. To elucidate mechanism underlying miR-200c/PDE7B regulation of TNBC cell growth, we showed that cAMP concentration was lower in TNBC cells compared with estrogen receptor-positive (ER + ) cells, and that both miR-200c and PDE7B siRNAs were able to increase cAMP concentration in TNBC cells. High level of cellular cAMP has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in TNBC cells. Our observation that ectopic expression of miR-200c triggered apoptosis indicates that it does so by elevating level of cellular cAMP. Analysis of breast tumor gene expression datasets revealed an inverse association between miR-200c and PDE7B expression. Especially, both low miR-200c and high PDE7B expression were correlated with poor survival of breast cancer patients. Our study supports a critical role of miR-200c/PDE7B relationship in TNBC tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2890925762,"Nitrogen (N) is one of the most important limiting factors in conventional rice (Oryza sativa) production, which heavily relies on synthetic fertilizers. In this study, we researched on the development and use of a vertical semi-closed airlift photobioreactor (PBR) for microalgal cultivation and subsequently determined the efficacy of microalgae-based fertilizers to rice plant growth. The PBR system was developed to produce two strains of N2-fixing cyanobacteria (Anabaena sp. UTEX 2576, Nostoc muscorum UTEX 2209S), and a polyculture of Chlorella vulgaris (UTEX 2714) and Scenedesmus dimorphus (UTEX 1237). When these biofertilizers were evaluated for rice under the greenhouse conditions, results showed that the rice plant heights treated with polyculture-based microalgal biomass were similar to or better than the urea treatment. The effects of the inoculation of the N2-fixing cyanobacterial inoculation on seedling growth was not statistically significant. In conclusion, the vertical semi-closed system PBR cultivation method developed in this study proved to be a simple and effective method for cultivating microalgae. Demonstration of the reliable production system for N2-fixing cyanobacteria and chlorophytes at a medium scale could potentially open the future application of microalgal biofertilizers in rice production."
https://openalex.org/W2892050358,"Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease of unknown etiology. The diagnosis is based on the identification of a pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia either by high resolution computed tomography and/or histology. However, a similar pattern can be observed in other fibrotic lung disorders, and precise diagnosis remains challenging. Studies on biomarkers contributing to the differential diagnosis are scanty, and still in an exploratory phase. Our aim was to evaluate matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-28, which has been implicated in abnormal wound healing, as a biomarker for distinguishing IPF from fibrotic non-IPF patients.The cell localization of MMP28 in lungs was examined by immunohistochemistry and its serum concentration was measured by ELISA in two different populations. The derivation cohort included 82 IPF and 69 fibrotic non-IPF patients. The validation cohort involved 42 IPF and 41 fibrotic non-IPF patients.MMP28 was detected mainly in IPF lungs and localized in epithelial cells. In both cohorts, serum concentrations of MMP28 were significantly higher in IPF versus non-IPF (mostly with lung fibrosis associated to autoimmune diseases and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis) and healthy controls (ANOVA, p<0.0001). The AUC of the derivation cohort was 0.718 (95%CI, 0.635-0.800). With a cutoff point of 4.5 ng/mL, OR was 5.32 (95%CI, 2.55-11.46), and sensitivity and specificity of 70.9% and 69% respectively. The AUC of the validation cohort was 0.690 (95%CI, 0.581-0.798), OR 4.57 (95%CI, 1.76-12.04), and sensitivity and specificity of 69.6% and 66.7%. Interestingly, we found that IPF patients with definite UIP pattern on HRCT showed higher serum concentrations of MMP28 than non-IPF patients with the same pattern (7.8±4.4 versus 4.9±4.4; p = 0.04). By contrast, no differences were observed when IPF with possible UIP-pattern were compared (4.7±3.2 versus 3.9±3.0; p = 0.43).These findings indicate that MMP28 might be a useful biomarker to improve the diagnostic certainty of IPF."

Apart from the few population based studies available, not many have investigated the burden of these viruses in jaundiced patients. Among the few studies, hepatitis E is the least studied among jaundiced patients. This study was aimed at describing the frequency, distribution and risk of the different hepatitis viruses among jaundiced patients reporting to the second largest teaching hospital in Ghana.From November, 2015 to April, 2016, a cross-sectional study was conducted among jaundiced patients attending the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. Between 3-5 ml of blood was collected from each patient and screened for viral hepatitis agents using both serologic and molecular-based assays.In the 155 patients recruited, hepatitis B was the most prevalent [54.2% (95% CI = 46.0%-62.2%)] followed by hepatitis E [32.9% (95% CI = 25.6-40.9%)]. Most cases of hepatitis E occurred as co-infections with hepatitis B (18%), with the predominant clinical feature being hepatocellular carcinoma. Risk factor variable analysis showed middle and older aged individuals were more at risk of hepatitis B exposure whereas younger age groups (<18 years) were more at risk of hepatitis E virus infection.Hepatitis viruses are still important in the viral aetiology of jaundice in Ghana. Hepatitis B and hepatitis E co-infections could play significant roles in causing severe disease. A more aggressive approach needs to be adopted in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with hepatitis causing viruses in Ghana and other developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W2889972938,"In 2013, the remote Tubbataha Reef UNESCO World Heritage Site, in the western Philippines, experienced two ship groundings within four months: the USS Guardian (USSG), a US military vessel, and the Min Ping Yu (MPY), an illegal Chinese fishing vessel. Here, we present the results of coral disease assessments completed two years post-grounding and recovery patterns monitored annually within these grounding sites. Site assessments were undertaken in three distinct zones: 'ground zero', where reef was scoured to its limestone base by direct ship impact; the 'impact border', containing surviving upright but damaged, abraded and fragmented colonies injured during ship movement; and undamaged 'control' sites, remote from the ship groundings but located on the same atoll. Coral diseases were dominated by white syndromes, and prevalence was an order of magnitude higher within the impact border zones than within the other zones two years after the events. Hard coral cover has steadily increased at a mean rate of 3% per year within the scoured USSG site at a rate comparable to control sites. In contrast, recovery has been negligible within the rubble-dominated MPY site, suggesting that substrate quality strongly influenced recovery processes such as recruitment, as larvae do not survive well on unstable substrates. Long-term recovery trajectories from these two grounding events appeared strongly influenced by movement of the ship during and after each event, and site-specific wave-influenced persistence of rubble and debris. High prevalence of coral disease among damaged but surviving colonies two years post-grounding suggested long-term impacts which may be slowing recovery and creating localized pockets of higher persistent disease prevalence than that of the surrounding population."
https://openalex.org/W2891381868,"Objective To quantify the association between the presence and type of drug detected and trauma recidivism in a cohort of patients admitted due to trauma. Method A cohort study was conducted based on data from a project where the presence of alcohol and other drugs (cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamines, tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, opiates and benzodiazepines) was analysed in 1,187 patients aged 16 to 70 years admitted due to trauma. The patients were followed for a period of between 10 to 52 months until June 2016. For this study, the recurrence of injuries from a sample of 929 patients from this cohort was analysed according to their consumption profile. Survival curves were estimated and adjusted Hazard Rate Ratios (aHRR) and adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) were calculated. Results The incidence rate of TR was 10.94 cases per 100 patient-years in the group of patients negative for substances and 27.99 per 100 patient-years in positive patients. The survival curves show very significant differences in cumulative recurrence-free survival between the groups (Log Rank: p<0.001). Both the aHRR and the aIRR estimates show an increased risk of re-injury due to alcohol consumption (aIRR: 2.33 (1.72–3.15), p<0.001), cannabis use (aIRR: 1.87 (1.09–3.20), p = 0.022) and polydrug use (aIRR: 2.34 (1.80–3.04), p<0.001). Conclusions The presence of alcohol and/or illicit drugs in these patients doubles the risk of trauma recidivism."
https://openalex.org/W2891751738,"Cartilage tissue engineering typically involves the combination of a biodegradable polymeric support material with chondrocytes. The culture environment in which cell–material constructs are created and stored is an important factor. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of combined stimuli on cartilage zonal organization which is important to maintain cartilage functions such as lubrication and cushion. For that purpose, we developed a joint mimicking loading system which was composed of compression and shear stress. To mimic the joint loading condition, we manufactured a stimuli system that has a device similar to the shape of a femoral condyle in human knee. The fibrin/hyaluronic acid mixture with chondrocytes were dropped into support made of silicon, and placed under the device. The cartilage explants were stimulated with the joint mimicking loading system for 1 hour per day over the course of 4 weeks. The amounts of GAG and collagen in the stimulated tissue were more than that of the static cultured tissue. Cells and collagen were arranged horizontally paralleled to the surface by stimuli, while it did not happen in the control group. The results of this study suggests that mechanical load exerting in the joint play a crucial role in stimulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) production as well as its functional rearrangement."
https://openalex.org/W2890274107,"Pear (Pyrus bretschneideri) is characterized by being self-incompatible and dependent on cross-pollination to set fruit. Honeybee (Apis mellifera) is considered the most important pollinator of pear. Nevertheless, limited pollen transfer has been cited as the main cause of poor fruit set in many pear orchards. Here, we tested the following hypotheses: (i) colony manipulations increase the pollen collection tendency of honeybees and (ii) the proportion of pollen loads being returned to the hive is from the target plant. The technique reliably and rapidly estimates the pollination of honeybees tested under different colony manipulations: (1) using pollen trapping (PT); (2) PT with sugar syrup feeding (SS) (PTSS); (3) SS alone and (4) control without PT and SS. The results clearly show that the pollen collection of honeybees during the experiment was significantly affected (P < 0.05) by colony manipulations. The mean amount of pollen harvested daily was higher for PTSS (19.4 g) and PT (16.4 g) than for SS (12.85 g) and control (8.7 g) colonies. Therefore, PTSS was the most effective treatment for increasing pear pollen collection; other treatments such as PT and SS could also be useful. This study was important for determining how the behavior of honeybee colonies is shaped through colony manipulation to enhance pollen collection of less preferred pear flowers, which is critical when pollination is required."
https://openalex.org/W2889604791,"Jaw correction surgery can cause significant psychosocial impacts on patients. This prospective study investigated the longitudinal changes of psychosocial characteristics of patients with dentofacial deformities after jaw correction surgery and the factors that predict the psychological resilience in Hong Kong Chinese undergoing jaw correction surgery.A longitudinal cohort study was conducted on 92 Hong Kong Chinese patients (32 males, 60 females; mean age = 24.75 ± 5.65 years), who had jaw correction surgery as treatment for their dentofacial deformities, from 1st June 2011 to 30th June 2015. Self-completed psychological inventories including Brief Symptom Inventory, Life Orientation Test, and the Adult Trait Hope Scale were used to measure distress, optimism, and hope levels respectively. Patients completed the inventories in five time points: the surgical consent signing day (usually two to three months before the surgery) (T1); one day before operation (T2), first to second post-operative week (T3), third post-operative month (T4) and sixth post-operative month (T5).Latent class growth analysis revealed two outcome trajectory classes: a resilience trajectory (n = 45, 48.9%) and a chronic dysfunction trajectory (n = 14, 15.2%). Another 33 (35.9%) showed erratic trajectory patterns that would not be classified into any categories. The psychological distress levels of patients in the resilience trajectory group, on average, were below the clinical threshold of the Brief Symptom Inventory at all time points. However, the opposite result was obtained for patients in the chronic dysfunctional group. Patients exhibiting a resilience trajectory pattern, when compared to those showing a chronic dysfunction pattern, had higher optimism (t(57) = 3.69, p < .0001) and hope (t(57) = 2.46, p < .05) levels at T1. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to compare the relative power of optimism and hope levels at T1 to predict resilience or chronic dysfunctional group membership. A test of the full model against a constant only model was statistically significant (χ2(2) = 24.096, p < .01). Preoperative baseline optimism (B = -.276, p < .05) but not hope (B = -.25, ns) was a significant variable to classify the outcome trajectories for psychological distress.Most patients were resilient to dentofacial deformities jaw correction surgery. About 15% exhibited a chronic distress pattern. An optimistic view about the surgery may enhance resilience. Pre-surgical counselling or educational sessions to facilitate a realistic positive outlook about the operation would be beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W2890503310,"Background Overweight, obesity, and gestational diabetes (GD) during pregnancy may negatively affect neurodevelopment in the offspring. However, the mechanisms are unclear and objective measures of neurodevelopment in infancy are scarce. We hypothesized that these maternal metabolic pathologies impair cortical visual evoked potentials (cVEPs), a proxy for visual and neuronal maturity. Design The PREOBE study included 331 pregnant women stratified into four groups; normal weight (controls), overweight, obesity, and GD (the latter including mothers with normal weight, overweight and obesity). In a subsample of the offspring at 3 months (n = 157) and at 18 months (n = 136), we assessed the latencies and amplitudes of the P100 wave from cVEPs and calculated visual acuity. Results At 3 months of age, visual acuity was significantly poorer in offspring born to GD mothers. At 18 months of age, there were no differences in visual acuity but infants born to GD mothers had significantly longer latencies of cVEPs when measured at 15’, and 30’ of arc. The group differences at 30’ remained significant after confounder adjustment (mean [SD] 121.0 [16.0] vs. 112.6 [7.6] ms in controls, p = 0.007) and the most prolonged latencies were observed in offspring to GD mothers with concurrent overweight (128.9 [26.9] ms, p = 0.002) and obesity (118.5 [5.1] ms, p = 0.020). Conclusions Infants born to mothers with GD, particularly those with concurrent overweight or obesity, have prolonged latencies of visual evoked potentials at 18 months of age, suggesting that this maternal metabolic profile have a long lasting, non-optimal, effect on infants´ brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2892266199,"Keratinocytes are the most abundant cell type in the epidermis. They prevent desiccation and provide immunological and barrier defense against potential pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The study of this first line of immune defense may be hindered by invasive isolation methods and/or improper culture conditions to support stem cell maintenance and other potential mechanisms contributing to long-term subcultivation in vitro. Primary keratinocytes have been successfully isolated from blister roofs induced by negative pressure, which separates the epidermis from the dermis in vivo in human subjects. This method allows collection of pure epidermal cells without dermal contamination in a minimally invasive manner. However, the isolated keratinocytes differentiate and senesce when cultured in vitro beyond five passages. Here, we present evidence that the Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 can be used to effectively increase the proliferative capabilities of keratinocytes isolated using the suction blister method, similar to what has been previously reported for primary keratinocytes isolated using alternative methods. We show that the increase in passage number is directly correlated to delayed differentiation, and that cells passaged long term with the inhibitor retain their ability to stratify in organotypic raft cultures and respond to cytokine treatment; additionally, the late passage cells have a heterogeneous mix of differentiated and non-differentiated cells which may be predicted by a ratio of select differentiation markers. The described method presents a minimally invasive procedure for keratinocyte isolation and prolonged culture that allows analysis of keratinocyte function in both healthy volunteers and patients with dermatologic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2892366760,"Parkinson's disease is a widespread neurodegenerative disorder which affects brain metabolism. Although changes in gene expression during disease are often measured, it is difficult to predict metabolic fluxes from gene expression data. Here we explore the hypothesis that changes in gene expression for enzymes tend to parallel flux changes in biochemical reaction pathways in the brain metabolic network. This hypothesis is the basis of a computational method to predict metabolic flux changes from post-mortem gene expression measurements in Parkinson's disease (PD) brain.We use a network model of central metabolism and optimize the correspondence between relative changes in fluxes and in gene expression. To this end we apply the Least-squares with Equalities and Inequalities algorithm integrated with Flux Balance Analysis (Lsei-FBA). We predict for PD (1) decreases in glycolytic rate and oxygen consumption and an increase in lactate production in brain cortex that correspond with measurements (2) relative flux decreases in ATP synthesis, in the malate-aspartate shuttle and midway in the TCA cycle that are substantially larger than relative changes in glucose uptake in the substantia nigra, dopaminergic neurons and most other brain regions (3) shifts in redox shuttles between cytosol and mitochondria (4) in contrast to Alzheimer's disease: little activation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid shunt pathway in compensation for decreased alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity (5) in the globus pallidus internus, metabolic fluxes are increased, reflecting increased functional activity.Our method predicts metabolic changes from gene expression data that correspond in direction and order of magnitude with presently available experimental observations during Parkinson's disease, indicating that the hypothesis may be useful for some biochemical pathways. Lsei-FBA generates predictions of flux distributions in neurons and small brain regions for which accurate metabolic flux measurements are not yet possible."

https://openalex.org/W2889654789,"Purpose This study aimed to explore the association between different obesity phenotypes and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among Tehranian men and women. Methods The participants of this study were 2880 healthy adults (aged>19 years) who participated in Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS). To obtain socio-demographic and HRQoL information, participants were interviewed by trained interviewers and were stratified by body mass index categories and metabolic status. Dysmetabolic status was defined as having either metabolic syndrome or diabetes according to the Joint Interim Statement definition and American Diabetes Association. Poor HRQoL was defined as the first quartile of HRQoL scores and logistic regression analysis was used to compare sex-specific odds ratios. Results Mean age of participants was 47.7±15.6 and 47.8±14.2 years in men and women respectively. The most and the least common obesity phenotypes were overweight-normal metabolic status and normal weight-dysmetabolic status, respectively. Only mean scores for physical HRQoL were significantly different among obesity phenotypes in both men and women (p<0.05). In addition, after adjusting for age, marital status, level of education, job status and physical activity, the odds of reporting poor physical HRQoL was significantly higher in men (OR: 1.960, 95% CI: 1.037–3.704; p<0.05) and women (OR: 2.887, 95% CI: 1.674–4.977; p<0.001) with obese-dysmetabolic status, compared to their counterparts with normal weight-normal metabolic status. However, except for overweight-normal metabolic women, who were less likely to report poor mental HRQoL (OR: 0.638, 95% CI: 0.415–0.981; p<0.05), none of the phenotypes were associated with poor mental HRQoL in either gender. Conclusions Compared to those with normal weight normal metabolic status, only obese dysmetabolic individuals were more likely to report poor physical HRQoL in both genders."
https://openalex.org/W2890113080,"The common dentex, Dentex dentex, is a fish species which inhabits marine environments in the Mediterranean and Northeast Atlantic regions. This is an important species from an ecological, economic and conservation perspective, however critical information on its population genetic structure is lacking. Most samples were obtained from the Mediterranean Sea (17 sites) with an emphasis around Corsica (5 sites), plus one Atlantic Ocean site. This provided an opportunity to examine genetic structuring at local and broader scales to provide science based data for the management of fishing stocks in the region. Two mitochondrial regions were examined (D-loop and COI) along with eight microsatellite loci. The COI data was combined with publicly available sequences and demonstrated past misidentification of common dentex. All markers indicated the absence of population genetic structure from the Bay of Biscay to the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Bayesian approaches, as well as the statistical tests performed on the allelic frequencies from microsatellite loci, indicated low differentiation between samples; there was only a slight (p = 0.05) indication of isolation by distance. Common dentex is a marine fish species with a unique panmictic population in the Mediterranean and likely in the Atlantic Ocean as well."
https://openalex.org/W2891366419,"From 2010 to 2014 two trials were performed to assess the effect of sowing date (SD1, SD2) and irrigation treatments (IT1, IT2) on the growth of chia in central Chile, measuring leaf area (LA) and dry matter (DM) as primary parameters and relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), leaf weight ratio (LWR), crop growth rate (CGR) and specific leaf weight (SLW) as secondary parameters. Both LA and DM reached maximum values between 640 and 1150 accumulated degree days (ADD). However, LA and DM were 25% greater for sowing dates than for available water. Flowering date was also not affected by sowing date or water availability; plants flowered at 1140 and 942 ADD in SD1 and SD2 respectively, and at 499 ADD in the water availability trial. Sowing date had a significant effect on RGR 0.15 g g-1 d-1 for SD1 and 0.12 g g-1 d-1 for SD2 at 410 ADD. Greater water availability increased RGR by 60% compared to stressed plants, however NAR was similar between sowing dates with a tendency to greater values in SD2 plants; maximum values were recorded at 514 ADD in IT1 and IT2, with a tendency toward higher values in IT1. Thus, the primary growth variables LA, DM and flowering are genetically determined. However, the derived growth variables RGR, LWR, NAR, CGR and SLW were affected by sowing date and water availability, with significant differences at p≤ 0.05. The results showed that the sowing date and water availability influence significantly the growth parameters. The physiological component (NAR) show a strong influence on the growth rate of the chia (RGR), above the morphological component (SLW and LAR)."
https://openalex.org/W2890471799,"Inertial sensor technology has assumed an increasingly important role in the field of human motion analysis. However, the reliability of the kinematic estimates could still be critical for specific applications in the field of functional evaluation and motor rehabilitation. Within this context, the definition of subject-specific multi-body kinematic models is crucial since it affects the accuracy and repeatability of movement reconstruction. A key step for kinematic model calibration is the determination of bony segment lengths. This study proposes a functional approach for the in vivo estimation of the humerus length using a single magneto-inertial measurement unit (MIMU) positioned on the right distal posterior forearm. The humerus length was estimated as the distance between the shoulder elevation axis and the elbow flexion-extension axis. The calibration exercise involved five shoulder elevations in the sagittal plane with the elbow completely extended and five elbow flexion-extensions with the upper arm rigidly aligned to the trunk. Validation of the method was conducted on five healthy subjects using the humerus length computed from magnetic resonance imaging as the gold standard. The method showed mean absolute errors of 12 ± 9 mm, which were in the estimate of the humerus length. When using magneto-inertial technology, the proposed functional method represents a promising alternative to the regressive methods or manual measurements for performing kinematic model calibrations. Although the proposed methodology was validated for the estimation of the humerus length, the same approach can be potentially extended to other body segments."
https://openalex.org/W2891208816,"Yaws is a neglected tropical disease caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. The disease primarily affects children under 15 years of age living in low socioeconomic conditions in tropical areas. As a result of a renewed focus on the disease owing to a recent eradication effort initiated by the World Health Organization, we have evaluated a typing method, adapted from and based on the enhanced Centers for Disease Control and Prevention typing method for T. pallidum subsp. pallidum, for possible use in epidemiological studies. Thirty DNA samples from yaws cases in Vanuatu and Ghana, 11 DNA samples extracted from laboratory strains, and 3 published genomic sequences were fully typed by PCR/RFLP analysis of the tpr E, G, and J genes and by determining the number of 60-bp repeats within the arp gene. Subtyping was performed by sequencing a homonucleotide “G” tandem repeat immediately upstream of the rpsA gene and an 84-bp region of tp0548. A total of 22 complete strain types were identified; two strain types in clinical samples from Vanuatu (5q11/ak and 5q12/ak), nine strain types in clinical samples from Ghana (3q12/ah, 4r12/ah, 4q10/j, 4q11/ah, 4q12/ah, 4q12/v, 4q13/ah, 6q10/aj, and 9q10/ai), and twelve strain types in laboratory strains and published genomes (2q11/ae, 3r12/ad, 4q11/ad, 4q12/ad, 4q12/ag, 4q12/v, 5r12/ad, 6r12/x, 6q11/af, 10q9/r, 10q12/r, and 12r12/w). The tpr RFLP patterns and arp repeat sizes were subsequently verified by sequencing analysis of the respective PCR amplicons. This study demonstrates that the typing method for subsp. pallidum can be applied to subsp. pertenue strains and should prove useful for molecular epidemiological studies on yaws."
https://openalex.org/W2891687141,"Vacuolar ATPases are multisubunit protein complexes that are indispensable for acidification and pH homeostasis in a variety of physiological processes in all eukaryotic cells. An arginine residue (Arg735) in transmembrane helix 7 (TM7) of subunit a of the yeast ATPase is known to be essential for proton translocation. However, the specific mechanism of its involvement in proton transport remains to be determined. Arginine residues are usually assumed to “snorkel” toward the protein surface when exposed to a hydrophobic environment. Here, using solution NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and in vivo yeast assays, we obtained evidence for the formation of a transient, membrane-embedded cation–π interaction in TM7 between Arg735 and two highly conserved nearby aromatic residues, Tyr733 and Trp737. We propose a mechanism by which the transient, membrane-embedded cation–π complex provides the necessary energy to keep the charged side chain of Arg735 within the hydrophobic membrane. Such cation–π interactions may define a general mechanism to retain charged amino acids in a hydrophobic membrane environment."
https://openalex.org/W4289547640,"The epidermis undergoes constant renewal during its lifetime. This is possible due to a special population of keratinocyte stem cells (KSCs) located at the basal layer. These cells are surrounded by their direct progeny, keratinocyte progenitors or transient amplifying cells (TAs), which arise from cell division. Skin is exposed every day to sun radiation; in particular, UVA radiation penetrates through the epidermis and induces damage to KSCs and TAs. Although keratinocytes in the basal layer are the most likely skin carcinomas and/or photoaging cells of origin, surprisingly few studies have addressed the specific responses of these cells to UV radiation. In this study, we showed for the first time that keratinocyte stem cells were more resistant to UVA irradiation than their direct progeny, transient amplifying cells. Using both the MTT assay and clonogenic assay, we found that KSCs were more photo-resistant compared to TAs after exposure to different doses of UVA (from 0 to 50 J/cm2). Moreover, KSCs had a greater ability to reconstruct human epidermis (RHE) after UVA exposure compared with TAs. Finally, investigations of DNA repair using the comet assay showed that DNA single-strand breaks and thymine dimers were repaired quicker and more efficiently in KSCs compared with TAs. In a previous work, we showed that the same stem cell population was more resistant to ionizing radiation, another carcinogenic agent. Collectively, our results combined with other observations demonstrate that keratinocyte stem cells, which are responsible for epidermal renewal throughout life, are equipped with an efficient arsenal against several genotoxic agents. Our future work will try to identify the factors or signaling pathways that are responsible for this differential photo-sensitivity and DNA repair capacity between KSCs and TAs."
https://openalex.org/W2889750131,"Objective We sought to investigate determinants and prognosis of sinus node dysfunction (SND) after surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) with concomitant mitral valve (MV) surgery. A total of 202 patients who underwent surgical AF ablation with concomitant MV surgery were studied. Study design and setting SND was defined as electrocardiographic manifestations, such as junctional bradycardia, symptomatic sick sinus syndrome, or symptomatic sinus bradycardia, 7 days after surgery. Baseline clinical and echocardiographic characteristics, rhythm outcomes [AF recurrence or permanent pacemaker (PM) implantation] at 6 and 12 months, and clinical outcomes were compared between patients without SND (n = 165) and those with SND (n = 37) after surgery. Results Patients with SND showed a significantly larger left atrial volume index (LAVI) and a higher right ventricular systolic pressure than those without SND. In addition, there was a higher likelihood for AF recurrence and PM implantation in patients with SND than in those without SND. Although clinical outcomes did not differ between the two groups, patients with SND had a significantly longer length of hospital stay (p<0.001). In a multivariate analysis, preoperative LAVI was a structural risk factor for SND [hazard ratio (HR): 1.126 per 10 mL/m2; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0206–1.236; p = 0.001]. An LAVI cut-off value of 105 mL/m2 showed significant predictive power for SND [sensitivity: 62%; specificity: 64%; area under the curve (AUC): 0.678; p = 0.002]. Conclusions In conclusion, preoperative LA size was a structural risk factor for SND after surgical AF ablation during MV surgery. SND was associated with an increased risk for AF recurrence and implantation of permanent PM in patients undergoing concomitant surgical ablation of AF with MV surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2890343106,"This study evaluated whether dietary spray-dried plasma (SDP) can ameliorate inflammation, lethargic behaviors, and impairment of reproduction caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge during late pregnancy. Two experiments were conducted with 125 mated female mice (C57BL/6 strain) in each experiment. All mice were shipped from a vendor on the gestation day (GD) 1 and arrived at the laboratory on GD 3. Mice were randomly assigned to dietary treatments with or without 8% SDP in the diet. On GD 17, mice determined pregnant by BW and abdomen shape were randomly assigned to intraperitoneal injections with or without 2 μg LPS. In experiment 1, 17 mice (26.7 ± 1.7 g BW) were identified pregnant and euthanized 6 h after the LPS challenge to measure inflammatory responses in uterus and placenta. In experiment 2, 44 mice (26.0 ± 1.6 g BW) were identified pregnant and euthanized 24 h after the LPS challenge to assess behavior and late-term pregnancy loss. Growth performance and reproductive responses, such as loss of pregnancy, percentage of fetal death, and etc., were measured in all pregnant mice. The LPS challenge increased (P < 0.05) uterine and placental tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ, late-term pregnancy loss, and lethargy score, and decreased (P < 0.05) uterine transforming growth factor-β1, moving time and number of rearing, and growth and feed intake. The SDP decreased (P < 0.05) concentrations of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in one or both tissues, and the lethargy score, and increased (P < 0.05) moving time and number of rearing, growth of pregnant mice, and fetal weight. However, the SDP did not affect late-term pregnancy loss caused by the LPS challenge. Consequently, dietary SDP attenuated acute inflammation and lethargic behaviors of pregnant mice caused by the LPS challenge, but did not affect late-term pregnancy loss after the acute inflammation."

The genome of DNUaV comprised 8139 bp and contained four putative open reading frames (ORFs). ORFs 1 and 2 had no identifiable conserved domains, while ORF 3 had conserved motifs typical of viruses within the family Caulimoviridae including coat protein, movement protein, aspartic protease, reverse transcriptase and ribonuclease H. A transactivator domain, similar to that present in members of several caulimoviridae genera, was also identified in the putative ORF 4. The genome size, organization, and presence of conserved amino acid domains are similar to other viruses in the family Caulimoviridae. However, based on nucleotide sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis, DNUaV appears to be a distinct novel member of the family and may represent a new genus."

These service members and Veterans, and their caregiver(s), must navigate multiple health systems and find experts across many fields of expertise to recover and optimize functionality. Twenty-two individuals, 10 caregivers of Veterans with TBI, 12 Veterans with TBI, participated in semi-structured interviews. Responses were coded using NVivo. Participants from both groups reported difficulties finding community supportive services (support groups) in local communities. Most participants identified the need for an advocate or point-person to help guide them to needed services and provide ongoing support in the post-acute health care recovery phase. Caregivers and Veterans desired a more personalized recovery plan from their medical professionals. When describing their ideal health information and services model most identified interactivity and twenty-four-hour availability as essential components. To provide Veterans and caregivers with optimal support and resources to navigate a complicated health services system, advocates and personalized care plans are needed. Future research should examine the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of these services."

Therefore, aim of this study was to describe differences between minimally conscious state (MCS) and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients in their autonomic response to a nociceptive stimulus. ECG, respiration, finger blood pressure (BP) and total peripheral resistances (TPR) were continuously recorded before, during and after a standardized noxious stimulus in 20 adult brain-injured patients, 14 in UWS and 6 in MCS. Occurrence of fast autonomic responses synchronous with the stimulus was detected by visual inspection of the tracings; short-term (<20 s) and long-term (between 20s and 50 s from the stimulus) responses were evaluated by beat-by-beat quantitative analysis. The noxious stimulus elicited fast responses in both groups, but only MCS patients showed a significant short-term response in TPR and long-term response in HR. Thus, short- and long-term cardiovascular responses to pain might integrate neuro-behavioural assessments to discriminate between MCS and UWS."

However, not every individual who is characterized by psychopathy engages in aggression, which suggests that certain factors may attenuate the intensity of the relations between psychopathy and aggression. The purpose of the current study was to explore the protective roles of the consideration of future consequences (CFC) (high CFC-Future and low CFC- Immediate) in attenuating aggression related to psychopathy using proactive aggression (Study 1) and cyber-aggression (Study 2) behavior indexes. College students (Study 1; N = 1,058) and adults (Study 2; N = 350) voluntarily participated in this study. The results demonstrated that the relationship between psychopathy and aggressive behaviors was moderated by CFC-Future and CFC-Immediate. Individuals with high psychopathy scores who also had high CFC-Future scores or low CFC-Immediate scores exhibited less proactive aggression (Study 1) and left fewer aggressive online comments on news websites (Study 2). The results of the present study suggested that CFC serves as a buffer against aggression related to psychopathy and may extend the knowledge of the relationship between psychopathy and aggression."

The study aimed to estimate population-based prevalence of self-reported kidney disease (SRKD) in Serbia, describe co-occurrence of chronic diseases/conditions/functional limitations in respondents with SRKD and explore association between SRKD and possible risk factors.We performed a secondary analysis of 2013 National Health Survey data. Data on a total of 14,587 respondents aged 15 years or older were analyzed using means of descriptive statistics, principal component analysis and logistic regression analysis.Out of all study respondents, 5.6% (95%CI 5.2-6.0) reported presence of kidney disease. Prevalence of all analyzed morbidities and functional limitations was higher in respondents with SRKD, and they had 8 times higher likelihood of being diagnosed with cirrhosis, 6.3 times higher likelihood of being diagnosed with urinary incontinence, more than 3 times higher likelihood of being diagnosed with degenerative disorder of bone and joint system. For cardiovascular diseases we obtained odds ratios (ORs) from 2.27 (95%CI 2.32-3.44) for heart attack to 2.95 (95%CI 2.43-3.57) for coronary heart disease. Number of co-occurrence patterns of kidney and other chronic diseases/conditions varied depending on inclusion of obesity in models. Logistic regression analysis showed that age explained most part of variability in the prevalence of SRKD and in the prevalence of two morbidities in respondents with SRKD, whereas the presence of three or more morbidities were associated with female gender, aging and low education level.Our study provided evidence that the presence of kidney disease was significantly associated with socio-demographic, lifestyle characteristics and a number of morbidities in Serbia. There is a need for integrated care and public health interventions, tackling management of NCDs and their risk factors. Detailed well-designed studies, as part of cost-effective preventive approach, are needed for chronic kidney disease screening."
https://openalex.org/W2891697137,"Chaetoceros peruvianus is a marine diatom species with circumglobal distribution. While frequently observed, it appears never to dominate the marine phytoplankton community hence it can be characterized as a rather opportunistic, generalistic species. Here we present ecological interpretations from a long-term data set on marine microphytoplankton in the northern Adriatic Sea, where the abundancies and relative contributions of C. peruvianus were observed along a set of steep ecological gradients. Limited supply of dissolved inorganic phosphate was identified as the driving ecological factor for this ecosystem. In parallel C. peruvianus was cultivated in monoclonal cultures and its morphological and physiological reaction to replete and phosphorus depleted medium was analysed. C. peruvianus reacted to phosphorus depletion by an increase in cell height and length as well as thickness and length of setae. This morphological reaction included an increase in cellular volume and calculated carbon content. Additionally, it represents the transition between two described morphological varieties, C. peruvianus and C. peruvianus var. robusta. C. peruvianus showed a significant induction of extracellular alkaline phosphatase activity if grown in phosphate depleted medium. Microscopical analysis demonstrated this activity to be located exclusively on the setae of the cells."

The Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale (PABS) biomedical scale evaluates the degree of health professionals' biomedical orientation towards musculoskeletal pain and was never assessed using item response theory (IRT). This study aimed at assessing the psychometric performance of the 10-item biomedical scale of the PABS scale using IRT.Two cross-sectional samples (BeBack, n = 1016; DABS; n = 958) of health care professionals working in the UK were analysed. Mokken scale analysis (nonparametric IRT) and common factor analysis were used to assess dimensionality of the instrument. Parametric IRT was used to assess model fit, item parameters, and local reliability (measurement precision).Results were largely similar in the two samples and the scale was found to be unidimensional. The graded response model showed adequate fit, covering a broad range of the measured construct in terms of item difficulty. Item 3 showed some misfit but only in the DABS sample. Some items (i.e. 7, 8 and 9) displayed remarkably higher discrimination parameters than others (4, 5 and 10). The scale showed satisfactory measurement precision (reliability > 0.70) between theta values -2 and +3.The 10-item biomedical scale of the PABS displayed adequate psychometric performance in two large samples of health care professionals, and it is suggested to assess group-level professionals degree of biomedical orientation towards musculoskeletal pain."
https://openalex.org/W2889781208,"Perturbing a signaling system with a serial of single gene deletions and then observing corresponding expression changes in model organisms, such as yeast, is an important and widely used experimental technique for studying signaling pathways. People have developed different computational methods to analyze the perturbation data from gene deletion experiments for exploring the signaling pathways. The most popular methods/techniques include K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering techniques, or combining the expression data with knowledge, such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs) or gene ontology (GO), to search for new pathways. However, these methods neither consider nor fully utilize the intrinsic relation between the perturbation of a pathway and expression changes of genes regulated by the pathway, which served as the main motivation for developing a new computational method in this study. In our new model, we first find gene transcriptomic modules such that genes in each module are highly likely to be regulated by a common signal. We then use the expression status of those modules as readouts of pathway perturbations to search for up-stream pathways. Systematic evaluation, such as through gene ontology enrichment analysis, has provided evidence that genes in each transcriptomic module are highly likely to be regulated by a common signal. The PPI density analysis and literature search revealed that our new perturbation modules are functionally coherent. For example, the literature search revealed that 9 genes in one of our perturbation module are related to cell cycle and all 10 genes in another perturbation module are related by DNA damage, with much evidence from the literature coming from in vitro or/and in vivo verifications. Hence, utilizing the intrinsic relation between the perturbation of a pathway and the expression changes of genes regulated by the pathway is a useful method of searching for signaling pathways using genetic perturbation data. This model would also be suitable for analyzing drug experiment data, such as the CMap data, for finding drugs that perturb the same pathways."

We study the evolution of HIV-disease markers and comorbidities’ prevalence in PLHIV in Greece. Two cross-sectional analyses (2003 and 2013) on data from the AMACS cohort were performed. Comparisons were based on population average models and were repeated for subjects under follow-up at both 2003 and 2013. 2,403 PLHIV were identified in 2003 and 4,910 in 2013 (1,730 contributing for both cross-sections). Individuals in 2013 were on average older, diagnosed/treated for HIV for longer, more likely to be on cART, virologically suppressed, and with higher CD4 counts. Chronic kidney disease, dyslipidemia and hypertension prevalence increased over time. There was an increase in prescription of lipid-lowering treatment (3.5% in 2003 vs. 7.7% 2013, p<0.001). Among 220 and 879 individuals eligible for Framingham 10-year Event Risk calculation, the proportion of patients in the high-risk group (>20%) increased from 18.2% to 22.2% (p = 0.002). Increase in the prevalence of comorbidities was more pronounced in the subset of patients who were followed in both 2003 and 2013. The increased availability and uptake of cART led to significant improvements in the immuno-virological status of PLHIV in Greece, but they aged alongside an increase in prevalence of non-AIDS related comorbidities. These results highlight the need for appropriate monitoring, optimal cART selection and long-term management and prevention strategies for such comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W2891980793,"The active form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), plays an essential role in the catalytic mechanism of various proteins, including human glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (hGOT1), an important enzyme in amino acid metabolism. A recent molecular and genetic study showed that the E266K, R267H, and P300L substitutions in aspartate aminotransferase, the Arabidopsis analog of hGOT1, genetically suppress a developmentally arrested Arabidopsis RUS mutant. Furthermore, CD analyses suggested that the variants exist as apo proteins and implicated a possible role of PLP in the regulation of PLP homeostasis and metabolic pathways. In this work, we assessed the stability of PLP bound to hGOT1 for the three variant and wildtype (WT) proteins using a combined 6 μs of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. For the variants and WT in the holo form, the MD simulations reproduced the ""closed-open"" transition needed for substrate binding. This conformational transition was associated with the rearrangement of the P15-R32 small domain loop providing substrate access to the R387/R293 binding motif. We also showed that formation of the dimer interface is essential for PLP affinity to the active site. The position of PLP in the WT binding site was stabilized by a unique hydrogen bond network of the phosphate binding cup, which placed the cofactor for formation of the covalent Schiff base linkage with K259 for catalysis. The amino acid substitutions at positions 266, 267, and 300 reduced the structural correlation between PLP and the protein active site and/or integrity of the dimer interface. Principal component analysis and energy decomposition clearly suggested dimer misalignment and dissociation for the three variants tested in our work. The low affinity of PLP in the hGOT1 variants observed in our computational work provided structural rationale for the possible role of vitamin B6 in regulating metabolic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2891416885,"Scientific writing, particularly quantitative writing, is difficult to master. To help undergraduate students write more clearly about data, we sought to deconstruct writing into discrete, specific elements. We focused on statements typically used to describe data found in the results sections of research articles (quantitative comparative statements, QC). In this paper, we define the essential components of a QC statement and the rules that govern those components. Clearly defined rules allowed us to quantify writing quality of QC statements (4C scoring). Using 4C scoring, we measured student writing gains in a post-test at the end of the term compared to a pre-test (37% improvement). In addition to overall score, 4C scoring provided insight into common writing mistakes by measuring presence/absence of each essential component. Student writing quality in lab reports improved when they practiced writing isolated QC statements. Although we observed a significant increase in writing quality in lab reports describing a simple experiment, we noted a decrease in writing quality when the complexity of the experimental system increased. Our data suggest a negative correlation of writing quality with complexity. We discuss how our data aligns with existing cognitive theories of writing and how science instructors might improve the scientific writing of their students."
https://openalex.org/W2891866259,"The intergenerational transfer of plant defense compounds by aposematic insects is well documented, and since 2006, has been shown for Cry toxins. Cry toxins are proteins naturally produced by the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and its genes have been expressed in plants to confer insect pest resistance. In this work we tested if non-aposematic larvae of a major maize pest, Spodoptera frugiperda, with resistance to Cry1F, could transfer Cry1F from a genetically engineered maize variety to their offspring. Resistant 10-day-old larvae that fed on Cry1F Bt maize until pupation were sexed and pair-mated to produce eggs. Using ELISA we found that Cry1F was transferred to offspring (1.47-4.42 ng Cry1F/10 eggs), a toxin concentration about 28-83 times less than that detected in Cry1F Bt maize leaves. This occurred when only one or both sexes were exposed, and more was transferred when both parents were exposed, with transitory detection in the first five egg masses. This work is an unprecedented demonstration that a non-aposematic, but resistant, species can transfer Cry1F to their offspring when exposed to Bt host plant leaves as immatures."
https://openalex.org/W2891956531,"Background Assessing exposure to infections in early childhood is of interest in many epidemiological investigations. Because exposure to infections is difficult to measure directly, epidemiological studies have used surrogate measures available from routine data such as birth order and population density. However, the association between population density and exposure to infections is unclear. We assessed whether neighbourhood child population density is associated with respiratory infections in infants. Methods With the Basel-Bern lung infant development study (BILD), a prospective Swiss cohort study of healthy neonates, respiratory symptoms and infections were assessed by weekly telephone interviews with the mother throughout the first year of life. Using population census data, we calculated neighbourhood child density as the number of children < 16 years of age living within a 250 m radius around the residence of each child. We used negative binomial regression models to assess associations between neighbourhood child density and the number of weeks with respiratory infections and adjusted for potential confounders including the number of older siblings, day-care attendance and duration of breastfeeding. We investigated possible interactions between neighbourhood child population density and older siblings assuming that older siblings mix with other children in the neighbourhood. Results The analyses included 487 infants. We found no evidence of an association between quintiles of neighbourhood child density and number of respiratory symptoms (p = 0.59, incidence rate ratios comparing highest to lowest quintile: 1.15, 95%-confidence interval: 0.90–1.47). There was no evidence of interaction with older siblings (p = 0.44). Results were similar in crude and in fully adjusted models. Conclusions Our study suggests that in Switzerland neighbourhood child density is a poor proxy for exposure to infections in infancy."
https://openalex.org/W2890203784,"Objective To assess the prevalence of recently graduated physicians who perceived themselves as adequately competent to perform Papanicolaou (PAP), Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA), and Visual Inspection with Lugol´s Iodine (VILI); and study its associated factors, in Lima, Peru. Methods This cross-sectional study evaluated recently graduated physicians from Lima, Peru. Physicians were considered to perceive themselves as adequately competent if they had answered, ""agree"" or ""strongly agree"" when asked if they were competent enough to perform these screening tests. To evaluate the associated factors, prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated using Poisson regressions with robust variance. Results Only 367/432 (86.2%) physicians perceived themselves as adequately competent to perform PAP, 257 (60.5%) to perform VIA, and 247 (58.1%) to perform VILI. Physicians who performed their gynecology/obstetric clerkship at hospitals from the police or armed forces had a higher proportion of perceiving themselves as adequately competent to perform VIA and VILI. Conclusions Nine out of ten physicians perceived themselves as adequately competent to perform PAP, while six out of ten to perform VIA or VILI. The health care system in which the physicians performed their clerkship was associated with the prevalence of adequate self-perceived competence for performing VIA and VILI."
https://openalex.org/W2890694891,"Despite the prevalent use of nest-site selection studies to define habitat quality for birds, many studies relying on use-availability analysis have found poor correlations between selected vegetation and reproductive success. Using 3 years of data from northeastern British Columbia (2007–2009), we determined timing of breeding from hatching dates and contrasted the nest-site selection of earlier (n = 22) with later-nesting pairs (n = 36) of yellow-bellied sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus varius), because early breeders were expected to be more reproductively successful. We then compared these choices with those identified from use-availability analysis, and determined whether reproductive performance (fledgling production) was related to selected vegetation. None of the vegetation characteristics selected for nest sites from available vegetation predicted reproductive performance. Earlier-nesting pairs fledged more young on average than later breeders (4.41, SE = 0.18 versus 3.92, SE = 0.16), and chose less decayed aspen trees for nesting, that were surrounded on average by 3 times the number of food trees (paper birch, Betula papyrifera). Potential preference for birch trees was masked in the use-availability analysis, because the selection rate was dominated by the choices of the larger number of later-nesting pairs. Similarly, the majority (69%) of nest cavity entrances faced south, but earlier breeding pairs excavated northward-oriented cavities more frequently than did later breeding pairs, which strongly predicted their higher fledgling production. To our knowledge, our study is the first to compare the choices of early versus later breeders to test the efficacy of use-availability studies in defining habitat quality. We found that use-availability analysis was inadequate for determining vegetation characteristics related to reproductive performance. In contrast, measuring the distinct preferences of earlier breeders resulted in an improved ability to measure habitat quality and explain the spatial distribution of yellow-bellied sapsuckers, a keystone species of the mixedwood boreal forest."
https://openalex.org/W2891447473,"Background Although the need for physical assessment in home nursing care has been shown, little research has examined the development of visiting nurses’ physical assessment capabilities. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a learning support program to help working visiting nurses utilize their respiratory physical assessment skills. Design This study used a quasi-experimental design of two groups with pre-test, post-test measurements of training and follow-up test 8 weeks practice in their work place after the training. Methods 57 currently working visiting nurses were assigned to 1 of 2 groups: a control group in which nurses would not receive any special support after respiratory physical assessment training, and an experimental group in which nurses would receive support to utilize the knowledge and skills they had learned during the training. Results The average practical examination score was significantly higher after the training. In the experimental group, the average score 8 weeks after training was not significantly higher than that obtained just after training. Further, after 8 weeks, the experimental group’s average score was not significantly higher than that of the control group. Practice evaluation scores obtained by an investigation of daily clinical practice were not significantly higher seventh weeks compared to third weeks after training for either the experimental or control groups. Seventh weeks after training, the average practice evaluation score of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of control groups. The mean learning support program satisfaction score was higher among the experimental group than the control group. Conclusions The results suggested that support from others was effective in maintaining motivation for learning and making use in the regular practice of the knowledge and skills acquired in the respiratory physical assessment training."
https://openalex.org/W3023063261,"The epidermis undergoes constant renewal during its lifetime. This is possible due to a special population of keratinocyte stem cells (KSCs) located at the basal layer. These cells are surrounded by their direct progeny, keratinocyte progenitors or transient amplifying cells (TAs), which arise from cell division. Skin is exposed every day to sun radiation; in particular, UVA radiation penetrates through the epidermis and induces damage to KSCs and TAs. Although keratinocytes in the basal layer are the most likely skin carcinomas and/or photoaging cells of origin, surprisingly few studies have addressed the specific responses of these cells to UV radiation. In this study, we showed for the first time that keratinocyte stem cells were more resistant to UVA irradiation than their direct progeny, transient amplifying cells. Using both the MTT assay and clonogenic assay, we found that KSCs were more photo-resistant compared to TAs after exposure to different doses of UVA (from 0 to 50 J/cm2). Moreover, KSCs had a greater ability to reconstruct human epidermis (RHE) after UVA exposure compared with TAs. Finally, investigations of DNA repair using the comet assay showed that DNA single-strand breaks and thymine dimers were repaired quicker and more efficiently in KSCs compared with TAs. In a previous work, we showed that the same stem cell population was more resistant to ionizing radiation, another carcinogenic agent. Collectively, our results combined with other observations demonstrate that keratinocyte stem cells, which are responsible for epidermal renewal throughout life, are equipped with an efficient arsenal against several genotoxic agents. Our future work will try to identify the factors or signaling pathways that are responsible for this differential photo-sensitivity and DNA repair capacity between KSCs and TAs."
https://openalex.org/W2890812339,"The N-end rule pathway leads to regulated proteolysis as an adaptive response to external stress and is ubiquitous from bacteria to mammals. In this study, we investigated a gene coding for a putative core enzyme of this post-translational regulatory pathway in Leishmania major, which may be crucial during cytodifferentiation and the environment adaptive responses of the parasite. Leucyl, phenylalanyl-tRNA protein transferase and arginyl-tRNA protein transferase are key components of this pathway in E. coli and eukaryotes, respectively. They catalyze the specific conjugation of leucine, phenylalanine or arginine to proteins containing exposed N-terminal amino acid residues, which are recognized by the machinery for the targeted proteolysis. Here, we characterized a conserved hypothetical protein coded by the LmjF.21.0725 gene in L. major. In silico analysis suggests that the LmjF.21.0725 protein is highly conserved among species of Leishmania and might belong to the Acyl CoA-N-acyltransferases (NAT) superfamily of proteins. Immunofluorescence cell imaging indicates that the cytosolic localization of the studied protein and the endogenous levels of the protein in promastigotes are barely detectable by western blotting assay. The knockout of the two alleles of LmjF.21.0725 by homologous recombination was only possible in the heterozygous transfectant expressing LmjF.21.0725 as a transgene from a plasmid. Moreover, the kinetics of loss of the plasmid in the absence of drug pressure suggests that maintenance of the gene is essential for promastigote survival. Here, evidence is provided that this putative aminoacyl tRNA-protein transferase is essential for parasite survival. The enzyme activity and corresponding post-translational regulatory pathway are yet to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2891988733,"Michigan's infant mortality rate is consistently higher than the national rate, with persistent and significant racial/ethnic disparities. In Michigan, nine counties account for more than 80% of all infant deaths. A home visiting program serving low-income, first-time mothers in high-risk communities is one strategy to reduce infant mortality. The objective of this study was to quantify the risk of infant mortality based on race/ethnicity within Michigan's highest-risk counties to guide outreach for home visiting services in these counties.To maximize the efficiency of limited resources and to identify women at highest risk, we used decomposition to develop risk-based, county-specific estimates of excess infant deaths in nine Michigan counties using data from the 2007 to 2009 Michigan resident infant death file linked to the live birth/file.The sample size for these counties was 200,610 live births and 1,836 infant deaths and for the reference population it was 195,180 live births and 1,133 infant deaths The study found that excess mortality varies among populations at the county level when compared to the reference population of infants born to Michigan mothers who attained more than a high school education and were at least 20 years of age at the infant's birth. The excess risk of mortality was highest for African American infants in seven of the nine counties (56.5% to 132.8%) and for Hispanic infants (86.6%) and white infants (48.2%) in one county each.Even with a longstanding commitment and legal mandate to reduce disparities and with efforts to improve outreach into high-risk areas, disparities persist. An improved understanding of the racial/ethnic disparities within communities was useful to focus outreach efforts on reaching women at highest risk as part of subsequent program enrollment."
