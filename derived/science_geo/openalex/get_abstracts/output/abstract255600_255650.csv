https://openalex.org/W2149119305,"Mutations or duplications in MECP2 cause Rett and Rett-like syndromes, neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by mental retardation, motor dysfunction, and autistic behaviors. MeCP2 is expressed in many mammalian tissues and functions as a global repressor of transcription; however, the molecular mechanisms by which MeCP2 dysfunction leads to the neural-specific phenotypes of RTT remain poorly understood. Here, we show that neuronal activity and subsequent calcium influx trigger the de novo phosphorylation of MeCP2 at serine 421 (S421) by a CaMKII-dependent mechanism. MeCP2 S421 phosphorylation is induced selectively in the brain in response to physiological stimuli. Significantly, we find that S421 phosphorylation controls the ability of MeCP2 to regulate dendritic patterning, spine morphogenesis, and the activity-dependent induction of Bdnf transcription. These findings suggest that, by triggering MeCP2 phosphorylation, neuronal activity regulates a program of gene expression that mediates nervous system maturation and that disruption of this process in individuals with mutations in MeCP2 may underlie the neural-specific pathology of RTT."

We found that estrogen positive feedback to generate the preovulatory gonadotropin surge was normal in estrogen receptor β knockout (ERβ) mutant mice, but absent in ERα mutant mice. An ERα-selective compound was sufficient to generate positive feedback in wild-type mice. As GnRH neurons do not express ERα, estrogen positive feedback upon GnRH neurons must be indirect in nature. To establish the cell type responsible, we generated a neuron-specific ERα mutant mouse line. These mice failed to exhibit estrogen positive feedback, demonstrating that neurons expressing ERα are critical. We then used a GnRH neuron-specific Pseudorabies virus (PRV) tracing approach to show that the ERα-expressing neurons innervating GnRH neurons are located within rostral periventricular regions of the hypothalamus. These studies demonstrate that ovulation is driven by estrogen actions upon ERα-expressing neuronal afferents to GnRH neurons.

The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons represent the key output cells of the neuronal network controlling fertility in all mammalian species. The GnRH neurons and associated cells that comprise the “GnRH neuronal network” are responsible for integrating multiple internal homeostatic and external environmental signals to ensure appropriate levels of fertility for the individual (Levine, 1997Levine J.E.

Arguably, the most important of these signals is that of estrogen, secreted by the gonads to achieve feedback regulation of gonadotropin secretion (Herbison, 1998Herbison A.E. Multimodal influence of estrogen upon gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons.Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 302-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Petersen et al., 2003Petersen S.L. Ottem E.N. Carpenter C.D.

Throughout most of the menstrual cycle, estrogen suppresses gonadotropin secretion, but at mid-cycle, switches to have a potent stimulatory or “positive feedback” action to evoke the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that triggers ovulation. Although feedback effects of estrogen are known to occur at the pituitary gland (Shupnik, 1996Shupnik M.A. Gonadal hormone feedback on pituitary gonadotropin genes.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), actions of estrogen within the brain are accepted as being critical for the generation of the GnRH surge that drives the preovulatory LH surge in all mammals, including primates (Karsch et al., 1997Karsch F.J. Bowen J.M. Caraty A. Evans N.P. Moenter S.M. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone requirements for ovulation.Biol.

Rev. 1998; 19: 302-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even though estrogen positive feedback is central to mammalian fertility, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Since GnRH neurons express ERβ, but not ERα, it is possible that estrogen acts directly upon them to generate the GnRH surge (Herbison and Pape, 2001Herbison A.E. Pape J.R.

However, several lines of evidence indicate that effects of estrogens may be transmitted to GnRH neurons in an indirect manner by ERα- and/or ERβ-expressing neurons, glia, or endothelial cells (Rage et al., 1997Rage F.

Direct and indirect regulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons by estradiol.Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 1771-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The detailed investigation of this mechanism has been hampered by the scattered distribution of the GnRH neurons, which makes them difficult to investigate technically. Thus, at present, neither the estrogen receptor subtype (ERα versus ERβ), nor the critical cell types involved in estrogen positive feedback, have been defined, and much controversy surrounds this critical issue. A genetic approach to define which of these two estradiol receptors is crucial for GnRH neuronal activation to induce ovulation, and to characterize its role in specific cells, might provide valuable insights. Using mice in which ERα or ERβ has been inactivated, we firstly demonstrate here that ERα, but not ERβ, is required for estrogen positive feedback to GnRH neurons. Using an ERα-selective ligand in wild-type mice, we show that ERα is not only necessary, but also sufficient to generate estrogen positive feedback. Secondly, by exploiting a neuron-specific mutation of the ERα gene, we were able to identify neurons, as opposed to other cell types, as critical targets for estradiol action. This clearly establishes that neurons expressing ERα are required for estrogen to activate GnRH neurons. Finally, through use of a GnRH neuron-specific Pseudorabies virus (PRV) tracing approach, we have been able to define the location of ERα-expressing neurons projecting to GnRH neurons. These data demonstrate a key role for ERα in mammalian estrogen positive feedback and provide definitive evidence for the “indirect model” of estrogen action, in which estrogen regulates ERα-expressing neuronal afferents to the GnRH neurons to bring about the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge. The stimulatory effects of estrogen positive feedback were evaluated using a protocol that enabled the activation status of GnRH neurons to be assessed alongside changes in plasma LH levels. Ovariectomized wild-type C57BL6/J mice, given an estradiol capsule followed by an injection of estradiol benzoate, were found to exhibit an LH surge centered around 19:00 hr, on lights out (Figure 1A). In the ERα mutant mice, there was no evidence of an LH surge in any of the mice (n = 8) in response to the same estrogen regimen, with mean LH levels at 19:00 hr of 1.6 ± 0.3 ng/ml compared with 5.2 ± 1.0 ng/ml in wild-type control animals (n = 7, p < 0.05; Figure 1B). In contrast, clear evidence of an LH surge was observed in each of the ovariectomized, estrogen-treated ERβ mutant mice (mean LH levels of 8.6 ± 1.7 ng/ml compared with 8.9 ± 1.5 ng/ml in controls, n = 7 for each group) (Figure 2A).Figure 2Positive Feedback Actions of Estrogen Appear Normal in ERβ Mutant MiceShow full caption(A) Mean (+SEM) LH levels in wild-type-littermates (n = 7) and ERβ mutant mice (n = 7) ovariectomized, treated with estrogen, and killed at 19:00 hr.(B) The percentage of GnRH neurons (+SEM) found to express c-Fos in wild-type-littermates (n = 7) and ERβ mutant mice (n = 8) ovariectomized, treated with estrogen, and killed at 19:00 hr.(C) The number of c-Fos-expressing neurons detected within the AVPV of wild-type-littermates (n = 7) and ERβ mutant mice (n = 8) ovariectomized, treated with estrogen, and killed at 19:00 hr.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Mean (+SEM) LH levels in wild-type-littermates (n = 7) and ERβ mutant mice (n = 7) ovariectomized, treated with estrogen, and killed at 19:00 hr.

Approximately 40% of the GnRH neuronal population expresses the immediate early gene c-Fos at the time of the GnRH surge, and this is believed to be an accurate indicator of those GnRH neurons activated by estrogen to generate the GnRH surge (Hoffman et al., 1993Hoffman G.E. Smith M.S. Verbalis J.G. c-Fos and related immediate early gene products as markers of activity in neuroendocrine systems.Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1993; 14: 173-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). In addition, there is increasing evidence that neurons within the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) of the rostral hypothalamus may be an important target for estrogen in bringing about the GnRH surge (Herbison, 1998Herbison A.E. Multimodal influence of estrogen upon gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons.Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 302-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Simerly, 2002Simerly R.B. Wired for reproduction: organization and development of sexually dimorphic circuits in the mammalian forebrain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 507-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Dual-label immunocytochemistry (Figures 1C and 1D) revealed that approximately 40% of GnRH neurons in wild-type mice expressed c-Fos at the time of the estrogen-induced LH surge (Figures 1C and 1E). The GnRH neurons expressing c-Fos were located preferentially within the preoptic area, with dual-labeled GnRH neurons only rarely detected in more rostral areas, such as the medial septum (data not shown). In contrast, we detected no GnRH neurons that expressed c-Fos in any brain region of ERα mutant mice (Figures 1D and 1E). The distribution and number of GnRH neurons detected in wild-type and ERα mutant females were not different (data not shown). In addition, we found that the numbers of singly-labeled, c-Fos-expressing cells located within the AVPV were significantly greater in wild-type mice (Figure 1F) compared with ERα mutant females (p < 0.05; Figures 1G and 1H). Single- and dual-label immunocytochemistry experiments in ERβ mutant females revealed no differences in the number of dual-labeled c-Fos-GnRH neurons compared with wild-type controls (Figure 2B) or in the number of c-Fos-expressing cells detected in the AVPV (Figure 2C). The distribution and number of GnRH neurons in wild-type and ERβ mutant females were also not different (data not shown). The results with the ERα and ERβ mutant mice indicated that ERα was necessary for estrogen positive feedback. To evaluate whether ERα pathways were sufficient for positive feedback, wild-type mice were given the ERα-selective compound 16α-LE2 [3,17-dihydroxy-19-nor-17α-pregna-1,3,5 (10)-triene-21,16α-lactone] (Hegele-Hartung et al., 2004Hegele-Hartung C. Siebel P. Peters O. Kosemund D. Muller G. Hillisch A. Walter A. Kraetzschmar J. Fritzemeier K.H. Impact of isotype-selective estrogen receptor agonists on ovarian function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 5129-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) as the second estradiol injection alongside control mice receiving the normal, previously outlined estrogen protocol. The second estradiol injection is critical for evoking positive feedback, as mice given vehicle control at this time point never exhibit an LH surge. Mice treated with 16α-LE2 (n = 5) exhibited an LH surge at 19:00 hr (LH, 5.9 ± 1.7 ng/ml, compared with normal estrogen-treated controls, 6.5 ± 2.3 ng/ml) and had 49% ± 7% of rostral preoptic area GnRH neurons expressing c-Fos (compared with controls that had 60% ± 11%). Together, these observations demonstrate that cells expressing ERα are both necessary and sufficient for estrogen positive feedback actions upon GnRH neurons. As GnRH neurons do not express ERα, these results demonstrate that ERα-expressing neuronal, glial, or other cell types must mediate estrogen positive feedback actions upon GnRH neurons. To examine the hypothesis that estrogen acts through ERα-expressing neurons, rather than other cell types, to activate GnRH neurons, neuron-specific ERα mutant mice were developed by breeding ERαflox mice with a CamKIIα-Cre transgenic mouse line. Immunocytochemical analyses of ERα expression in the resulting mice showed that ERα immunoreactivity was absent from the hypothalamus (Figures 3A and 3B) and all other brain regions (see Figure S2 in the Supplemental Data) of ERαfl/fl;CamKIIα-Cre mice. In contrast, ERα protein was detected in the pituitary of all genotypes, including female ERαfl/fl;CamKIIα-Cre mice (Figures 3A and 3B, insets). Female ERαfl/fl;CamKIIα-Cre mice were found to be infertile and, from an age of 5 to 6 weeks, to exhibit striking abnormalities in their reproductive organs (Figure 4). In the mutants, the uterus was grossly enlarged and filled with liquid (Figure 4B). The endometrium, however, was severely atrophic and lacked all glandular structures. Whereas the endometrial stroma was loose and vascularized in control mice (Figure 4C), it appeared condensed and showed granulocyte infiltration in the mutants (Figure 4D). Histologically, the ovaries of ERαfl/fl;CamKIIα-Cre mice showed signs of gonadotropin hyperactivation; in mutant mice, ovaries contained a large number of antral follicles compared with wild-type animals (Figures 4E and 4F). In the ovarian hilus, theca cells appeared hypertrophic and luteinized in mutant animals, indicating inappropriate stimulation of the ovaries. Furthermore, no corpora lutea were observed in the ovaries of mutants (Figure 4F), suggesting a failure of ovulation. Basal LH levels were not different between diestrous controls (0.91 ± 0.11 ng/ml) and ERαfl/fl;CamKIIα-Cre (1.23 ± 0.08 ng/ml) female mice.Figure 4Ovarian and Uterine Phenotype of Neuron-Specific ERα Mutant MiceShow full caption(A and B) Reproductive tract of control ERαfl/fl (A) and mutant ERαfl/fl;CamKIIα-Cre (B) mice showing fluid-filled uteri in mutants.(C and D) H&E staining of uteri from control ERαfl/fl (C) and mutant.

Ovariectomized, estrogen-treated ERαfl/fl;CamKIIα-Cre mice (n = 6) failed to exhibit an LH surge, with mean LH levels of 0.9 ± 0.2 ng/ml at 19:00 hr compared with 5.8 ± 2.1 ng/ml in littermate controls (n = 5; Figure 3C). Immunocytochemical experiments did not detect c-Fos in any GnRH neurons in ERαfl/fl;CamKIIα-Cre mice following estrogen treatment. This compared with c-Fos in 41% ± 8% of GnRH neurons in littermate controls (Figure 3D). As c-Fos protein is detectable for 5–6 hr in GnRH neurons following the GnRH/LH surge (Lee et al., 1990Lee W.S. Smith M.S. Hoffman G.E. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone neurons express Fos protein during the proestrous surge of luteinizing hormone.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 5163-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), we additionally evaluated c-Fos expression in GnRH neurons at midday of the expected day of the surge and at 01:00 hr (1 a.m.) on the following day to evaluate whether the timing of positive feedback had been altered in ERαfl/fl;CamKIIα-Cre mice. We found a complete absence of c-Fos in GnRH neurons at these time points. As we find no evidence for c-Fos in GnRH neurons of ERαfl/fl;CamKIIα-Cre mice at 13:00 hr, 19:00 hr, or 01:00 hr the next day, it seems unlikely that the GnRH neurons receive either an early or delayed positive feedback signal in ERαfl/fl;CamKIIα-Cre mice. The distribution and number of GnRH neurons in ERαfl/fl;CamKIIα-Cre brains was identical to that of controls (data not shown). Whereas numbers of c-Fos-positive cells in a control brain region were not different between control littermates (5.1 ± 2.2 cells/unit area/section) and ERαfl/fl;CamKIIα-Cre mice (8.3 ± 1.6 cells/unit area/section), significantly more singly-labeled c-Fos cells were detected within the AVPV of littermate controls compared with ERαfl/fl;CamKIIα-Cre mice (p < 0.05; Figure 3E). These data closely resemble that of the global ERα mutant mouse and indicate that ERα-expressing neurons are critical for estrogen positive feedback to occur. The studies above show that ERα-expressing neurons are critical for estrogen positive feedback to GnRH neurons. To identify the locations of these cells within the GnRH neuronal network, we have used a Cre-dependent PRV retrograde tracing strategy in GnRH-Cre mice (DeFalco et al., 2001DeFalco J. Tomishima M. Liu H. Zhao C. Cai X. Marth J.D. Enquist L. Friedman J.M.

Dulac C. Olfactory inputs to hypothalamic neurons controlling reproduction and fertility.Cell. 2005; 123: 669-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In this approach, the Ba2001 PRV is activated only after infecting a Cre-expressing GnRH neuron in vivo. This allows for the now unconditional PRV to replicate and to pass in a retrograde manner to the primary afferents of the GnRH neuron and, subsequently, their own afferents in a time-dependent manner. The retrograde chain of infection can be followed by evaluating GFP expression as the unconditional Ba2001 PRV also expresses GFP in each cell it infects. Five founder GnRH-Cre lines were generated. Analysis of Cre expression by dual-label immunocytochemistry in adult female mice revealed that one of these lines expressed Cre in a highly selective manner within 97% ± 2% of all GnRH neurons (n = 6; Figure 5A). Crossing this line with the ROSA-26 indicator mice (Soriano, 1999Soriano P. Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4028) Google Scholar) revealed Cre-dependent recombination in 97% ± 1% of GnRH neurons (n = 4; not shown). To evaluate the ERα-expressing afferents to the GnRH neuron population that is activated at the time of the GnRH surge (i.e., those in the rostral preoptic area), a single 500 nl injection of Ba2001 PRV was given into the rostral preoptic area of adult female mice. Mice examined at 6, 12, 24, and 30 hr after injection of Ba2001 (n = 8) displayed no evidence of GFP expression in any region of the brain. However, 48 hr after PRV injection (n = 4), we found that between five and nine GnRH neurons located around the injection site expressed GFP (Figures 5B and 5C) indicating that Cre-mediated recombination had occurred in these cells. No other GFP-expressing cells were detected within the brain at this time point. Seventy-two hours following PRV injection, GFP-expressing cells (representing afferent neurons to rostral preoptic GnRH neurons, Figure 5D) were identified in multiple brain regions. Twenty-four hours later (96 hr post-injection), we found a much larger distribution and number of GFP-expressing cells. As 24 hr is required for PRV to move from one order of neurons to the next (Card and Enquist, 1995Card J.P. Enquist L.W. Neurovirulence of pseudorabies virus.Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1995; 9: 137-162PubMed Google Scholar, Horvath et al., 2002Horvath S. Kis Z. Boldogkoi Z. Nogradi A. Toldi J. Oestrogen-dependent tracing in the rat CNS after pseudorabies virus infection.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the neurons identified at 72 hr post-injection are almost certainly primary afferents to GnRH neurons. At 72 hr post-injection (n = 6), GFP-expressing neurons were identified in multiple areas of the forebrain and brainstem (Figure 5G). The regions displaying the largest numbers of retrogradely labeled neurons were the hypothalamic periventricular nucleus (PeN; mean of 36 cells/mouse in a 1:3 series of brain sections), AVPV (23 cells), median preoptic nucleus (MnPO; 14 cells), and dorsal raphe (16 cells). Other brain regions that consistently exhibited GFP-expressing neurons at lower densities were the lateral septum, arcuate nucleus (ARN), and nucleus tractus solitarius (Figure 5G). Dual-label immunocytochemistry (n = 6) for GFP and ERα (Figures 5D and 5E) identified ERα-expressing afferents as being located in four brain regions: the AVPV, MnPO, PeN, and ARN (Figure 5F). The percentage of GFP-positive neurons expressing ERα was 53% ± 12%, 34% ± 21%, and 24% ± 11% in the AVPV, MnPO, and PeN, respectively, and 56% ± 19% for the ARN, although we only ever observed 1–2 GFP-expressing cells in the ARN (Figure 5G). To ensure the neuronal identity of PRV-infected cells expressing ERα, immunocytochemical labeling for GFP and ERα was undertaken in combination with Nissl staining. All GFP/ERα-expressing cells were also positive for Nissl (Figure S3). Injections of Ba2001 PRV into the rostral preoptic area of wild-type, non-Cre-expressing mice, or into the striatum of GnRH-Cre mice, resulted in a complete absence of GFP-expressing neurons. These findings demonstrate that ERα-expressing primary afferents to GnRH neurons have their cell bodies located principally within rostral periventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. The findings of the PRV study demonstrated that significant estrogen-receptive primary afferents to the GnRH neurons existed in the PeN and MnPO in addition to the AVPV. As such, we returned to the estrogen positive feedback c-Fos studies and examined c-Fos expression in the MnPO and PeN of ERα and ERβ mutant mice. The numbers of c-Fos cells in the PeN of mice treated with estrogen were significantly reduced in ERα mutants (22 ± 3 cells, p < 0.05) compared with wild-type mice (40 ± 6 cells per section), but were unchanged in ERβ mutant females. The numbers of c-Fos-expressing cells in the MnPO were not significantly different in either ERα or ERβ mutant mice compared with controls. These data indicate that a subpopulation of cells within the PeN, as well as the AVPV, is activated by estrogen positive feedback. We have used here a series of ER mutant mouse models and an ER-selective ligand to demonstrate the critical receptor isoform and cell type necessary and sufficient for estrogen to initiate the GnRH/LH surge and ovulation. We show that global ERβ mutant mice exhibit normal patterns of estrogen-induced GnRH activation and LH surge secretion. In contrast, global ERα mutant mice fail to exhibit GnRH neuron activation or LH surge secretion in response to estrogen. As GnRH neurons do not express ERα (Herbison and Pape, 2001Herbison A.E. Pape J.R. New evidence for estrogen receptors in gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons.Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2001; 22: 292-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), this indicated that positive feedback effects of estrogen must occur in an indirect manner. To define the critical ERα-expressing cell-type in the pathway, neuron-specific ERα mutant mice were generated by crossing a floxed exon 3 ERα mouse line with CamKIIα-Cre mice. CamKIIα is expressed selectively by forebrain neurons (Ouimet et al., 1984Ouimet C.C. McGuinness T.L. Greengard P.

Mice harboring a neuron-specific ERα deletion were found to be infertile and lack estrogen positive feedback, demonstrating that ERα-expressing neurons are critical. To define the location of these neurons, we have used a Cre-dependent PRV retrograde tracing strategy to demonstrate that the ERα-expressing primary afferents to GnRH neurons are located primarily within the periventricular nuclei of the rostral hypothalamus. Together, these observations provide conclusive evidence that critical positive feedback actions of estrogen upon GnRH neurons are mediated by ERα-expressing neuronal afferents within the GnRH neuronal network. It is now recognized that estrogen can modulate the activity of neuronal networks through multiple mechanisms including both slow genomic and rapid actions (McEwen and Alves, 1999McEwen B.S. Alves S.E. Estrogen actions in the central nervous system.Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 279-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). In the case of estrogen positive feedback, however, it seems clear that classical genomic mechanisms underlie the estrogen activation of GnRH neurons. In all species examined, positive feedback only occurs after several hours of estrogen exposure (Legan et al., 1975Legan S.J. Coon G.A. Karsch F.J.

Furthermore, once the animal has been exposed to estrogen for a sufficient period, estrogen can be removed without having any negative effect upon subsequent GnRH neuron activation.

To characterize the organelles responsible for this long-distance crosstalk, we developed a purification strategy based on a fragment of tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT H(C)) conjugated to paramagnetic beads. This approach enabled us to identify, among other factors, the small GTPase Rab7 as a functional marker of a specific pool of axonal retrograde carriers, which transport neurotrophins and their receptors. Furthermore, Rab5 is essential for an early step in TeNT H(C) sorting but is absent from axonally transported vesicles. Our data demonstrate that TeNT H(C) uses a retrograde transport pathway shared with p75(NTR), TrkB, and BDNF, which is strictly dependent on the activities of both Rab5 and Rab7. Therefore, Rab7 plays an essential role in axonal retrograde transport by controlling a vesicular compartment implicated in neurotrophin traffic."

However, proteins that cluster AMPA-Rs at synapses remain poorly understood.

We also reveal unanticipated synapse heterogeneity as loss of either PSD-95 or PSD-93 silences largely nonoverlapping populations of excitatory synapses. In adult PSD-95 and PSD-93 double knockout animals, SAP-102 is upregulated and compensates for the loss of synaptic AMPA-Rs.

These studies establish a PSD-MAGUK-specific regulation of AMPA-R synaptic expression that establishes and maintains glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system. Glutamate acts on two types of ionotropic glutamate receptors to mediate excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Brief repetitive activation of excitatory synapses leads to long-term changes in synaptic strength by rapidly redistributing synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPA-Rs). Such changes may contribute to learning and memory. However, the proteins involved in AMPA-R trafficking are poorly understood. A thick electron-dense material associated with the postsynaptic membrane, referred to as the postsynaptic density (PSD), imbeds glutamate receptors. The PSD also contains scaffolding proteins, some of which contain PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) modular interaction motifs (Kim et al., 1995Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M.

The PSD-95-like subfamily of MAGUKs (PSD-MAGUKs) includes PSD-93/Chapsyn-110, SAP-102, and SAP-97. PSD-MAGUKs share a common domain organization with three N-terminal PDZ domains, a Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a carboxy terminal catalytically inactive guanylate kinase (GK) domain. Determining whether PSD-MAGUKs play a role in synaptic transmission has been challenging. Whereas the PDZ domains of PSD-95 bind the C-terminal tails of NMDA receptor type-2 (NR-2) subunits (Kornau et al., 1995Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H.

However, gene-targeted truncation of PSD-95 fails to alter synaptic transmission mediated either by NMDA receptors (NMDA-Rs) or AMPA-Rs (Migaud et al., 1998Migaud M. Charlesworth P. Dempster M.

Several confounding factors may explain these conflicting results. PSD-MAGUK overexpression may lead to artificial protein-protein interactions. In addition, molecular redundancy among PSD-MAGUKs may lead to functional compensation, thus confounding the phenotype of knockout (KO, or −/−) mice. To determine whether PSD-MAGUKs have a role in synaptic function, we combined experimental approaches. First, we used short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) for each PSD-MAGUK family member to acutely remove endogenous proteins. We then examined excitatory synaptic transmission in a complete PSD-95 KO mouse (PSD-95−/−) (Yao et al., 2004Yao W.D. Gainetdinov R.R. Arbuckle M.I. Sotnikova T.D. Cyr M. Beaulieu J.M. Torres G.E.

Identification of PSD-95 as a regulator of dopamine-mediated synaptic and behavioral plasticity.Neuron. 2004; 41: 625-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), in a complete PSD-93 KO mouse (PSD-93−/−) (McGee et al., 2001McGee A.W. Topinka J.R. Hashimoto K. Petralia R.S. Kakizawa S. Kauer F.W. Aguilera-Moreno A. Wenthold R.J. Kano M. Bredt D.S. PSD-93 knock-out mice reveal that neuronal MAGUKs are not required for development or function of parallel fiber synapses in cerebellum.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3085-3091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in a double PSD-95/PSD-93 KO mouse (PSD-95−/−/PSD-93−/−). Finally, we combined shRNA and overexpression experiments in PSD-MAGUK KO mice to test directly for functional redundancy and compensation. Taken together our results indicate that (1) PSD-95 and PSD-93 account for synaptic AMPA-R targeting at mature synapses, (2) PSD-95 and PSD-93 determine the synaptic content of AMPA-Rs at separate, largely nonoverlapping subsets of excitatory synapses, (3) PSD-95 and PSD-93 are jointly required for normal synaptic expression of NMDA-Rs, (4) SAP-102 functionally compensates for PSD-95 and PSD-93 in AMPA-R and NMDA-R trafficking in the PSD-95−/−/PSD-93−/− mouse, and (5) the role of PSD-MAGUK proteins in synaptic AMPA-R targeting is developmentally regulated; SAP-102 is primarily responsible for clustering in neonatal synapses, whereas PSD-95 and PSD-93 primarily anchor proteins in mature synapses. Understanding the physiological role of closely related proteins represents a recurring and challenging theme in modern biology. This study establishes novel experimental paradigms that can be broadly applied to unravel this knotty problem. We first generated shRNAs against PSD-95, PSD-93, and SAP-102 and tested their efficiency and specificity by coexpression with cDNA expression vectors in COS-7 cells (Figure 1A). Knockdown of PSD-MAGUK expression was strictly specific and protein amounts were reduced below detection for each of the PSD-MAGUKs. Introducing silent point mutations in the relevant cDNAs prevents the knockdown, demonstrating target specificity (Figure 1B). We used western blot analysis to measure the effect of shRNA on the level of PSD-MAGUK protein in primary hippocampal cultures infected with shRNA-containing Lentivirus (Figure 1C) (Lois et al., 2002Lois C. Hong E.J. Pease S. Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Germline transmission and tissue-specific expression of transgenes delivered by lentiviral vectors.Science. 2002; 295: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). shRNA expression selectively reduced PSD-95, PSD-93, or SAP-102 protein. Lentivirus expressing a control shRNA sequence had no effect. As the infection efficiency was ∼70%, these results underestimate the knockdown efficiency in infected cells. We confirmed the quantitative loss of PSD-95 protein in individual neurons by immunocytochemistry (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data). shRNA of SAP-97 dramatically blocked expression of SAP-97 in COS-7 cells (not shown). However, we were unable to reduce SAP-97 protein in neuronal cultures. We tried two different shRNA constructs that were effective in COS-7 cells, and we tested multiple SAP-97 antibodies (data not shown). Thus, we are unable to address the consequences of SAP-97 deletion on synaptic transmission. We first examined the effect of PSD-95 shRNA. As shown in Figure 2A, surface GluR2 puncta localized at synaptic spines were greatly reduced in cultured dissociated neurons (DIV 19–21) expressing PSD-95 shRNA (42% of control). This decrease occurred without changing the density of dendritic spines (Figure 2B). Total surface GluR2 expression was effected to a similar degree (n = 9 cells in each condition; control = 15.9 ± 1.2 and PSD-95 shRNA = 8.2 ± 1.7 clusters per 10 μm of dendrite, p < 0.01). We used hippocampal slice cultures (Figures 2C–2I) to examine the effects on synaptic function. Two to three days after preparation, slices were infected with PSD-95 shRNA-carrying Lentivirus and were left for a further 5–8 days. We simultaneously recorded from an infected neuron and an uninfected neighbor and compared the synaptic responses evoked by a common input. A typical experiment is shown by the traces in Figure 2C1. As reported previously (Nakagawa et al., 2004Nakagawa T. Futai K. Lashuel H.A. Lo I. Okamoto K. Walz T. Hayashi Y. Sheng M. Quaternary structure, protein dynamics, and synaptic function of SAP97 controlled by L27 domain interactions.Neuron. 2004; 44: 453-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the AMPA-R component of the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) was dramatically decreased in the infected cell, whereas there was no difference in the NMDA-R component. The results, shown in scatter plots for all neuronal pairs (Figures 2C2 and 2C3), demonstrate a 51% decrease in the size of the AMPA-R EPSC (Figure 2C2). On the other hand, there is no change in the size of the NMDA-R EPSC (Figure 2C3). These effects are target-specific, as repeating the experiment in slice cultures made from PSD-95−/− mice (see below) did not change either the AMPA-R (Figure 2D2) or NMDA-R EPSC (Figure 2D3). Also, using a control shRNA sequence did not effect the AMPA-R EPSC (uninfected: 49.1 ± 6.8 pA; infected: 41.9 ± 6.5 pA; n = 16, p = 0.29) (data not shown). Slow turnover of PSD-95 does not explain the remaining AMPA-R EPSC, as waiting 12–14 days after infection led to no further reduction (uninfected: 62.5 ± 5.9 pA; infected: 26.2 ± 3.5 pA; n = 12, p < 0.0001) (data not shown). To understand the basis for the reduction in AMPA-R EPSCs, we first evaluated miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) (Figures 2E–2G). In PSD-95 shRNA-infected neurons, there was no change in amplitude (Figure 2F) but a large decrease in event frequency (Figure 2G), suggesting that a population of synapses is silenced. To ensure that a reduction in mEPSC amplitude could be observed, we reduced evoked EPSCs to a similar extent with the AMPA-R antagonist NBQX. With NBQX, a clear reduction in mean amplitude was observed (control: −15.1 ± 1.2 pA, n = 8; NBQX: −8.6 ± 1.2 pA, n = 3; p < 0.05) (data not shown). To monitor silent synapses directly, we carried out minimal stimulation experiments to compare the incidence of failures in control and infected cells (Figure 2H); failure rates were consistently enhanced in the infected cells. Where do AMPA-Rs go after they have been removed from the synapse by shRNA PSD-95? Previous experiments suggest that overexpression of PSD-95 recruits AMPA-Rs from extrasynaptic membranes to the synapse (Schnell et al., 2002Schnell E. Sizemore M. Karimzadegan S. Chen L. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Direct interactions between PSD-95 and stargazin control synaptic AMPA receptor number.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 13902-13907Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Consistent with PSD-95 shRNA causing redistribution from synapses to extrasynaptic membranes, we found that the size of AMPA-R-mediated currents in outside-out somatic (nonsynaptic) membrane patches was enhanced (Figure 2I). Conflicting with our shRNA data, targeted truncation of PSD-95 in mice has no effect on synaptic transmission (Migaud et al., 1998Migaud M. Charlesworth P. Dempster M. Webster L.C. Watabe A.M. Makhinson M. He Y. Ramsay M.F. Morris R.G. Morrison J.H. et al.Enhanced long-term potentiation and impaired learning in mice with mutant postsynaptic density-95 protein.Nature. 1998; 396: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Might the difference be due to the remaining expression of the N-terminal fragment of PSD-95 in this mouse (Migaud et al., 1998Migaud M. Charlesworth P. Dempster M. Webster L.C. Watabe A.M. Makhinson M. He Y. Ramsay M.F. Morris R.G. Morrison J.H. et al.Enhanced long-term potentiation and impaired learning in mice with mutant postsynaptic density-95 protein.Nature. 1998; 396: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), which is necessary and sufficient for the overexpression enhancement (Schnell et al., 2002Schnell E. Sizemore M. Karimzadegan S. Chen L. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Direct interactions between PSD-95 and stargazin control synaptic AMPA receptor number.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 13902-13907Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar)? To address this, we examined synaptic transmission in acute hippocampal slices from postnatal day 30 to 40 (P30–40) mice that completely lack PSD-95 protein (Yao et al., 2004Yao W.D. Gainetdinov R.R. Arbuckle M.I. Sotnikova T.D. Cyr M. Beaulieu J.M. Torres G.E. Grant S.G. Caron M.G. Identification of PSD-95 as a regulator of dopamine-mediated synaptic and behavioral plasticity.Neuron. 2004; 41: 625-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) (Figures 2J and 2K). First, we used extracellular field potential recording to compare the strength of synaptic transmission between control and PSD-95−/− mice. The size of the presynaptic fiber volley (input) was compared to the size of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) response (output). Over a range of stimulus strengths, no differences were observed between PSD-95−/− and control mice (Figure 2J). Next, we compared the size of the AMPA-R EPSC to that of the NMDA-R EPSC. In contrast to our shRNA experiments, we found no difference in the AMPA/NMDA EPSC ratio (Figure 2K), indicating that synaptic transmission is normal in the PSD-95−/− mouse. Do other PSD-MAGUKs play a role in glutamate receptor synaptic clustering? We examined the role of PSD-93, which also localizes to dendritic spines in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons (Figure 3A). PSD-93 overexpression strongly enhances AMPA-R EPSCs (Figures 3B1 and 3B2). This enhancement was receptor-selective, as there was no change in NMDA-R EPSCs (Figures 3B1 and 3B3). In addition, shRNA knockdown of PSD-93 caused a 48% selective reduction in the size of the AMPA-R EPSC (Figures 3C1 and 3C2), with no change in NMDA-R EPSCs (Figures 3C1 and 3C3). This effect on AMPA-R transmission is target-specific; repeating the same experiment in the PSD-93−/−mouse had no effect (Figures 3D1–3D3). We examined the mechanism for this reduction by recording mEPSCs. Similar to the results with PSD-95 shRNA, depletion of PSD-93 had no effect on the amplitude of mEPSCs (Figures 3E and 3F), but did cause a clear reduction of the frequency of mEPSCs (Figure 3G), suggesting that AMPA-Rs are lost from a subset of synapses. We also analyzed synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of the PSD-93−/− mouse (McGee et al., 2001McGee A.W. Topinka J.R. Hashimoto K. Petralia R.S. Kakizawa S. Kauer F.W. Aguilera-Moreno A. Wenthold R.J. Kano M. Bredt D.S. PSD-93 knock-out mice reveal that neuronal MAGUKs are not required for development or function of parallel fiber synapses in cerebellum.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3085-3091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first used field potential recordings to evaluate the strength of synaptic transmission. No difference in synaptic strength was found (Figure 3H). Next we examined the relative contribution of AMPA and NMDA receptors to the synaptic response (Figure 3I); again, no difference could be detected. As shRNA to either PSD-95 or PSD-93 diminish synaptic targeting of AMPA-Rs, perhaps functional redundancy masks synaptic deficits in the single KO mice. To address this, we generated PSD-95/PSD-93 double KOs. Unlike the single KOs, which were grossly indistinguishable from their littermates, PSD-95−/−/PSD-93−/− mice were clearly impaired. By 3 to 5 weeks of age, these animals were noticeably smaller than control littermates (Figure 4A) and typically died unless special care was provided from weaning onward. The animals had impaired gait and were markedly hypokinetic (see Movie S1 in the Supplemental Data). In these animals, field input/output curves revealed a 55% reduction in synaptic transmission (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the AMPA/NMDA EPSC ratio was reduced ∼50% (Figure 4C). These decreases occurred without any change in paired pulse facilitation (PPF) (Figure 4G), indicating that the probability of transmitter release was unaltered. Interestingly, as with shRNA knockdown of PSD-95 or PSD-93, the amplitude of mEPSCs was unchanged (Figures 4D and 4E), but there was a dramatic reduction in the frequency (Figures 4D and 4F). Western blotting of PSD-95−/−/PSD-93−/− hippocampal homogenates and littermate controls showed no difference in the total amounts of GluR1, GluR2, and NR-1 (Figures 4H and 4I). However, in accord with the electrophysiological data, the PSD-enriched fraction (TritonX 100 insoluble) showed a significant loss of GluR1 and GluR2 (Figures 4J and 4K), while NR-1 remained unchanged. What might account for the remaining transmission in the PSD-95−/−/PSD-93−/− mice? As this remaining transmission greatly exceeds the subtractive effects of the combined individual shRNA-mediated knockdowns, some type of compensation has presumably occurred. Might other PSD-MAGUKs contribute to clustering synaptic AMPA-Rs? We first carried out western blotting on hippocampal homogenates from PSD-95−/−/PSD-93−/− mice and found no change in the total level of SAP-97, whereas SAP-102 expression was increased by about 20% (Figure 5A). Similar results were obtained for the PSD-enriched fraction (Figure 5B). These results suggest that SAP-102 may cluster the AMPA-Rs that mediate the remaining synaptic transmission. Previous studies showed that overexpression of SAP-102 selectively enhances AMPA-R EPSCs (Schnell et al., 2002Schnell E. Sizemore M. Karimzadegan S. Chen L. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Direct interactions between PSD-95 and stargazin control synaptic AMPA receptor number.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 13902-13907Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). However, in the present study we found that knockdown of endogenous SAP-102 with shRNA had no effect on basal synaptic transmission (Figures 5C1–5C3), indicating that SAP-102 is not required for synaptic AMPA or NMDA receptor expression at mature synapses. In striking contrast SAP-102 shRNA expression in slice cultures from PSD-95−/−/PSD-93−/− mice caused a 52% reduction in the remaining transmission (equivalent to 82.5% from wild-type) (Figures 5D1 and 5D2). There was also a small reduction in the NMDA-R component (Figure 5D3). No change in PPF was detected (Figure 5E), indicating a postsynaptic change. Concomitant with the reduction in evoked synaptic transmission, AMPA-R-mediated mEPSC amplitude was decreased and frequency was further decreased (Figures 6A–6C), suggesting removal of AMPA-Rs from all of the remaining synapses. The depression of the NMDA-R EPSC is the first functional evidence that PSD-MAGUKs may, in fact, play a role in synaptic targeting of NMDA-Rs. Given this unexpected finding, we wished to ensure that this effect was not nonspecific. Therefore, we compared the effect of SAP-102 shRNA on the AMPA-R EPSC and the inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) in slices from PSD-95−/−/PSD-93−/− mice. In the presence of the NMDA-R blocker APV, we measured the size of the AMPA-R EPSC at −60 mV, the reversal potential for the IPSC, and then measured the size of the IPSC at 0 mV, the reversal potential for the EPSC. The depression of the AMPA-R EPSC by SAP-102 shRNA was not accompanied by any change in the IPSC (Figures 6D1–6D3). These experiments, as well as the fact that SAP-102 shRNA in mature wild-type mouse slices had no effect, establish the specificity of the effects on both the AMPA-R and NMDA-R EPSCs. Our results show that shRNA-mediated knockdown of either PSD-95 or PSD-93 results in an ∼50% reduction in the AMPA-R EPSC. In PSD-95−/−/PSD-93−/− mice, AMPA-R-mediated transmission is reduced by 55%. In these mice, SAP-102 is upregulated and is responsible for targeting much of the remaining AMPA-Rs. Taken together, these results suggest that PSD-95 and PSD-93 determine the synaptic expression of most, if not all, AMPA-Rs. Accordingly, simultaneous knockdown of PSD-95 and PSD-93 should reduce transmission by significantly more than 50%. To test this, we infected wild-type slices with Lentiviral particles expressing PSD-95 shRNA and dsRed in parallel with particles expressing PSD-93 shRNA and EGFP. A substantial number of cells expressed both constructs (Figure 7A). In doubly infected cells AMPA-R-mediated synaptic transmission was reduced ∼75% (Figures 7B1 and 7B2). Note that there is also a reduction in the NMDA-R component accompanying the dramatic loss of AMPA-Rs (Figure 7B3). No significant change in PPF was detected (control: 1.6 ± 0.1; infected: 2.0 ± 0.2; n = 15, p = 0.07, data not shown), suggesting an entirely postsynaptic effect. These results with acute double shRNA are more dramatic than in the PSD-95−/−/PSD-93−/− mouse, but resemble results obtained with SAP-102 shRNA in the PSD-95−/−/PSD-93−/− background. To ensure that the effects caused by the double shRNA are specific, we repeated these experiments in slices from PSD-95−/−/PSD-93−/− mice (Figures 7C1–7C3). No effect was observed, indicating the specificity of the results in the wild-type slices. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that (1) when PSD-MAGUKs are deleted in the germ line, other PSD-MAGUKs can compensate, and (2) PSD-MAGUKs are essential for targeting nearly all AMPA-Rs to the synapse. During development SAP-102 is expressed strongly by P10, whereas robust expression of PSD-95 and PSD-93 occurs 3 weeks later (Sans et al., 2000Sans N. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. Blahos II, J. Hell J.W. Wenthold R.J. A developmental change in NMDA receptor-associated proteins at hippocampal synapses.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1260-1271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The impairment in PSD-95−/−/PSD-93−/− mice (Figure 4) matched this developmental expression profile. Thus, 1 week old PSD-95−/−/PSD-93−/− mice were indistinguishable from their littermates (Figure 8A). Moreover, 1 week old PSD-95−/−/PSD-93−/− mice showed no difference in the AMPA/NMDA ratio (Figure 8B), mEPSC amplitude (Figures 8C and 8D), or mEPSC frequency (Figure 8E). Furthermore, shRNA knockdown of PSD-95 did not affect synaptic transmission in immature synapses (Figures 8F1–8F3). Whereas SAP-102 shRNA had no effect on mature synapses (Figures 5C1–5C3), SAP-102 shRNA caused an ∼50% reduction specifically in AMPA-R-mediated synaptic transmission in immature synapses (Figures 8G1–8G3). This establishes SAP-102 as the dominant PSD-MAGUK for AMPA-R trafficking during early postnatal development. These results provide important new mechanistic insights into synaptic AMPA-R targeting. They also compare the utility of two widely used loss-of-function approaches—gene targeting and RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown. Acute knockdown with shRNA shows that PSD-95 and PSD-93 normally mediate AMPA-R targeting to mature synapses. Interestingly, these knockdowns silence a population of synapses and have no effect on the remaining synapses, which indicates unexpected synaptic heterogeneity. Mice genetically lacking either PSD-95 or PSD-93 show little defect in synaptic transmission. This reflects redundancy, as PSD-95−/−/PSD-93−/− mice show a clear defect. SAP-102 has no role at mature synapses, but is upregulated in the PSD-95−/−/PSD-93−/− mouse to mediate residual transmission. At immature synapses, PSD-95 and PSD-93 play a minor role, whereas SAP-102 is primarily responsible for synaptic targeting of AMPA-Rs. Our results show a remarkable orchestration by PSD-MAGUKs in synaptic trafficking of AMPA-Rs. In a previous study, we reported that overexpression of PSD-95 and SAP-102 enhanced AMPA-R EPSCs, while overexpression of SAP-97 had no effect (Schnell et al., 2002Schnell E. Sizemore M. Karimzadegan S. Chen L. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Direct interactions between PSD-95 and stargazin control synaptic AMPA receptor number.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In one study it was found that only one splice variant of SAP-97 caused the enhancement in EPSCs (Rumbaugh et al., 2003Rumbaugh G. Sia G.M. Garner C.C. Huganir R.L.

https://openalex.org/W2118639179,"Long-lasting changes in synaptic strength are thought to play a pivotal role in activity-dependent plasticity and memory. There is ample evidence indicating that in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) the synthesis of new proteins is crucial for enduring changes. However, whether protein degradation also plays a role in this process has only recently begun to receive attention. Here, we examine the effects of blocking protein degradation on LTP. We show that pharmacological inhibition of proteasome-dependent protein degradation, just like inhibition of protein synthesis, disrupts expression of late (L-)LTP. However, when protein degradation and protein synthesis are inhibited at the same time, LTP is restored to control levels, calling into question the commonly held hypothesis that synthesis of new proteins is indispensable for L-LTP. Instead, these findings point to a more facetted model, in which L-LTP is determined by the combined action of synthesis and degradation of plasticity proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2059725343,"Dopaminergic dysregulation can cause motor dysfunction, but the mechanisms underlying dopamine-related motor disorders remain under debate. We used an inducible and reversible pharmacogenetic approach in dopamine transporter knockout mice to investigate the simultaneous activity of neuronal ensembles in the dorsolateral striatum and primary motor cortex during hyperdopaminergia ( approximately 500% of controls) with hyperkinesia, and after rapid and profound dopamine depletion (<0.2%) with akinesia in the same animal. Surprisingly, although most cortical and striatal neurons ( approximately 70%) changed firing rate during the transition between dopamine-related hyperkinesia and akinesia, the overall cortical firing rate remained unchanged. Conversely, neuronal oscillations and ensemble activity coordination within and between cortex and striatum did change rapidly between these periods. During hyperkinesia, corticostriatal activity became largely asynchronous, while during dopamine-depletion the synchronicity increased. Thus, dopamine-related disorders like Parkinson's disease may not stem from changes in the overall levels of cortical activity, but from dysfunctional activity coordination in corticostriatal circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2134888296,"Sensory experience and spontaneous activity play important roles in development of sensory circuits; however, their relative contributions are unclear. Here, we test the role of different forms of activity on remodeling of the mouse retinogeniculate synapse. We found that the bulk of maturation occurs without patterned sensory activity over 4 days spanning eye opening. During this early developmental period, blockade of spontaneous retinal activity by tetrodotoxin, but not visual deprivation, retarded synaptic strengthening and inhibited pruning of excess retinal afferents. Later in development, synaptic remodeling becomes sensitive to changes in visually evoked activity, but only if there has been previous visual experience. Synaptic strengthening and pruning were disrupted by visual deprivation following 1 week of vision, but not by chronic deprivation from birth. Thus, spontaneous activity is necessary to drive the bulk of synaptic refinement around the time of eye opening, while sensory experience is important for the subsequent maintenance of connections."

https://openalex.org/W2091813140,"Altered expression of human Scribble is associated with invasive epithelial cancers, however, its role in tumour development remains unclear. Mutations in Drosophila Scribble result in loss of polarity, overproliferation and 3D-tumourous overgrowth of epithelial cells. Using complementation studies in Drosophila we recently demonstrated that expression of human Scribble can also regulate polarity and restrict tissue overgrowth. Here, we have undertaken a detailed study of human Scribble function in the polarized mammary cell line, MCF10A. We show that although Scribble does not seem to be required for apical-basal polarity or proliferation control in MCF10A cells, Scribble is essential for the control of polarity associated with directed epithelial cell migration. Scribble-depleted MCF10A cells show defective in vitro wound closure and chemotactic movement. The cells at the wound edge fail to polarize, show reduced lamellipodia formation and impaired recruitment of Cdc42 and Rac1 to the leading edge. Furthermore, we show that this function is relevant in vivo as Scribble mutant mice show defective epidermal wound healing. This data identifies an essential role for mammalian Scribble in the regulation of the polarity specifically involved in directed epithelial migration."

https://openalex.org/W1995344003,"Bach2 is a B cell-specific transcription repressor whose deficiency in mice causes a reduced class switch recombination and a reduced somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes. Little is known about the direct target genes of Bach2 in B cells. By analyzing various B cell and plasma cell lines, we showed that the expression patterns of Bach2 and Blimp-1 (B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1), a master regulator of plasma cell differentiation, are mutually exclusive. The reporter gene of the Blimp-1 gene (Prdm1) was repressed by the overexpression of Bach2 in B cell lines. The heterodimer of Bach2/MafK bound to the Maf recognition element located upstream of the Prdm1 promoter in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The binding of MafK in B cells to the Prdm1 Maf recognition element was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. When MafK was purified from the BAL17 B cell line, a significant portion of it was present as a heterodimer with Bach2, with no apparent formation of MafK homodimer. These results strongly suggest that Bach2 represses the expression of Blimp-1 together with MafK in B cells prior to plasma cell differentiation. Accordingly, the knockdown of Bach2 mRNA using short hairpin RNA in BAL17 cells resulted in higher levels of Prdm1 expression after the stimulation of B cell receptor by surface IgM cross-linking. Induction of Prdm1 was more robust and faster in primary Bach2-deficient B cells than in wild-type control B cells upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Therefore, the Prdm1 regulation in B cells involves the repression by Bach2, which may be cancelled upon terminal plasma cell differentiation.

The process of cell differentiation is usually composed of multiple steps, each of which is characterized by a distinct gene expression pattern. Because the gene expression patterns are defined by transcription factors that are active in particular differentiation stages, transition from one stage to the next may thus involve reprogramming of transcription factor networks. B lymphoid cells provide an excellent model system to understand the transcription factor networks that regulate cell differentiation, because each step of B cell differentiation is well defined and can be monitored using various molecular markers. B cells develop from the hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow and continue to undergo maturation in the spleen in mice. After encountering antigen, activated B cells differentiate into plasma cells to secrete IgM or, after undergoing class switch recombination (CSR) 3The abbreviations used are: CSR, class switch recombination; MARE, Maf recognition element(s); SHM, somatic hypermutation; TRE, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element; IL, interleukin; RT, reverse transcription; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; kbp, kilobase pairs; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; siRNA, small interfering RNA. and somatic hypermutation (SHM), into plasma cells that secrete other classes of immunoglobulins with a higher affinity (1Snapper C.M.

Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 31-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). It has been well established that this process is regulated by not only antigen but also by cytokines and cell-cell signaling emitted by T cells (2Manis J.P. Tian M. Alt F.W. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 31-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). However, nuclear events that are generated in response to these signals are less well characterized. Because differentiation processes are often choreographed by a network of transcription factors, the plasma cell differentiation may thus be associated with a rewiring of the transcription factor network. Among the several transcription factors known to regulate the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells (3Shapiro-Shelef M. Calame K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 4Matthias P. Rolink A.G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), Blimp-1 (B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1) appears to be the key regulator, which thus provides a feasible bridgehead to investigate the gene network for plasma cell differentiation (5Turner Jr., C.A.

McHeyzer-Williams L.J. Liao J. McHeyzer-Williams M.G. Calame K. Immunity. 2003; 19: 607-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Since Blimp-1 down-regulates a large number of the genes required for germinal center formation and/or activated B cells including Pax5 (paired box gene 5) and Bcl6 (B cell lymphoma 6) (11Lin K.I.

Yang L. Zhao H. Calame K. Staudt L.M.

Angelin-Duclos C. Kuo T.C. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4771-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Blimp-1 also represses c-Myc and inhibits cell proliferation (13Lin Y. Wong K. Calame K. Science. 1997; 276: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), thus facilitating the cell cycle arrest associated with terminal differentiation. These previous studies have thus established that Blimp-1 is the master regulator of plasma cell differentiation. The Blimp-1 expression is high in plasma cells but either low or absent in B cells (10Shapiro-Shelef M. Lin K.I. McHeyzer-Williams L.J. Liao J. McHeyzer-Williams M.G. Calame K. Immunity. 2003; 19: 607-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 14Angelin-Duclos C. Cattoretti G. Lin K.I. Calame K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5462-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), thus indicating that its expression is strictly regulated during plasma cell differentiation. Bcl6 has been suggested to be a repressor of the Blimp-1 gene (Prdm1) (15Shaffer A.L. Yu X. He Y. Boldrick J. Chan E.P. Staudt L.M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 199-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Whereas AP-1 binds to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (TRE) in the promoter upstream region of Prdm1 to activate its expression, Bcl6 binds to AP-1 to inhibit DNA binding (16Vasanwala F.H. Kusam S. Toney L.M. Dent A.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1922-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition, Bcl6 represses Prdm1 through binding to Bcl6 response element 1, located in intron 5 of mouse Prdm1 (17Tunyaplin C. Shaffer A.L. Angelin-Duclos C.D. Yu X. Staudt L.M. Calame K.L. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Finally, Bcl6 inhibits the STAT3-driven Prdm1 expression by competing for the STAT3-binding sites (18Reljic R. Wagner S.D. Peakman L.J. Fearon D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1841-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The basic region-leucine zipper factor Bach2 (BTB (broad complex, tramtrak, and bric-a-brac) and CNC homology 2) functions as a transcription repressor by heterodimerizing the small Maf proteins (MafK, MafG, and MafF) and then binding to the Maf recognition elements (MARE) (19Igarashi K.

Interestingly, Bach2 is expressed from pro-B cell to mature B cell stages, but it is absent in plasmacytic cell lines. Genetic ablation of Bach2 in mice severely abrogates both T-cell-independent and T-cell-dependent CSR and SHM of the immunoglobulin genes (24Muto A. Tashiro S. Nakajima O. Hoshino H. Takahashi S. Sakoda E. Ikebe D. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Nature. 2004; 429: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In contrast, the production of IgM is apparently not defective in the absence of Bach2. These phenotypes indicate that Bach2 is somehow required for CSR and SHM. A straightforward prediction would be that Bach2 regulates the proper expression of the genes that are required either directly or indirectly for these events. Interestingly, the expression of Blimp-1 and XBP-1, which are both essential for plasmacytic differentiation (10Shapiro-Shelef M. Lin K.I. McHeyzer-Williams L.J. Liao J. McHeyzer-Williams M.G.

In this study, we ask whether Bach2 regulates the expression of Blimp-1. We identified MARE on the Prdm1 locus. The MARE was shown to function as a target site of Bach2/MafK. These observations suggest that Bach2 is a direct repressor of Prdm1 in B cells.

Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) were transfected with pOZ-FHH-N-MafK using GeneJuice Transfection Reagent, and then the viral supernatants were harvested 2 days after transfection to infect BAL17 mature B cells. The FLAG-hemagglutinin-His-tagged MafK (eMafK)-expressing cells were sorted by anti-human IL-2 receptor beads. Protein Purification—Nuclear extracts were purified as described previously (34Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). The cells were collected by centrifugation for 8 min at 1,865 × g and then were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation for 10 min at 1,190 × g, pellets were suspended in six volumes of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 10 mm KCl, 1.6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 40 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,190 × g. Next, the cells were resuspended in the same volume of hypotonic buffer, and the suspensions were homogenized and centrifuged for 30 min at 2,330 × g to collect nuclei. The obtained crude nuclei were suspended in a half-volume of low salt buffer (0.02 m KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 40 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for homogenization. The resulting suspension was dropped with a half-volume of high salt buffer (1.2 m KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) and then stirred gently for 30 min and centrifuged for 60 min at 48,384 × g. The supernatants were dialyzed against 50 volumes of BC-0 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 40 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) until the conductivity reached to 65–70 μS/cm. The dialysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 23,700 × g, and the supernatant was used as nuclear extracts. eMafK complexes were immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts by incubating with M2 anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma) for 4 h with rotation. After an extensive wash with 0.1 m KCl-containing buffer B, the bound proteins were eluted from FLAG M2-agarose by incubating for 60 min with the FLAG peptide in the same buffer (0.5 mg/ml). The eluates were then applied to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resins (Qiagen). After 60 min of rotation, the resins were collected and washed with 1 ml of 20 mm imidazole-containing NTN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40). The bound proteins were eluted from Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid by incubating for 30 min with 200 mm imidazole-containing NTN buffer. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—Purified proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gel, and then the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The stained bands were excised from the gel, and the proteins therein were subjected to in-gel reduction, S-carboxyamidomethylation, and digestion with trypsin (Promega). The molecular masses of the tryptic peptides were determined using LC-HCT plus (Bruker Daltonics), and protein identification was performed using the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin fixation and purification procedures were carried out as previously described (35Sawado T. Igarashi K. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10226-10231Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). B cells were fixed by adding formaldehyde to 1% final concentration for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were then sonicated to prepare chromatin suspensions of 300–1,000 bp DNA in length. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as previously described (35Sawado T. Igarashi K. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10226-10231Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) using anti-MafK antiserum (A-1) or normal rabbit serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The samples were analyzed by quantitative real time PCR using LightCycler Fast Start DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's protocol, using the LightCycler 1.5 (Roche Applied Science). The value of each sample was divided with the nonspecific enrichment of the mcm5 gene promoter, which did not contain MARE. The primers were as follows: a (–4.0 kbp), 5′-GCAAAGGAAGCTTATGCTATT-3′ and 5′-CTCTGGGCTGCCTTCCAT-3′; b(–2.0 kbp), 5′-GCAAAGGAAGCTTATGCTATT-3′ and 5′-CTCTGGGCTGCCTTCCAT-3′; c (promoter MARE), 5′-CTGACACTTACATGGTATCTGTGCCC-3′ and 5′-AAATCCAGCCTCCTGCAGAGG-3′; d(+2.0 kbp), 5′-CATCGCGGCGGCTGGTAGGAGTG-3′ and 5′-TGTCTGTGCGAGCGAGCGAGTGA-3′; e(+4.0 kbp), 5′-AGAGACTGGGATCATGAAA-3′ and 5′-AGTATGCTGCCAACAACA-3′. The mcm5 primers were the same as previously described (36Sun J. Brand M. Zenke Y. Tashiro S. Groudine M. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). siRNA—The siRNA expression vector pSUPERIOR.retro (OligoEngine) was used to knock down the Bach2 expression. The Bach2-specific siRNA sequences were as follows: Bach2 siRNA1, 5′-AAGAGCGAATTTGGTGCACAC-3′; Bach2 siRNA2, 5′-AAGACAACAGTGTCGACACTG-3′. The retroviral supernatants were obtained as described above and used to generate BAL17 mature B cells stably expressing Bach2 siRNA1 or Bach2 siRNA2 based on puromycin resistance. As a control, the cells transduced with the empty vector virus were used (mock). For B cell receptor stimulation, the cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-IgM antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for the indicated periods. Mouse Spleen B Cell Isolation and LPS Stimulation—Spleen B cells were purified from wild-type or Bach2–/– mice and then were stimulated with LPS (Sigma) as previously described (24Muto A. Tashiro S. Nakajima O. Hoshino H. Takahashi S. Sakoda E. Ikebe D. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Nature. 2004; 429: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Bach2-mediated Suppression of Prdm1 Transcription through MARE—The genetic ablation of Bach2 in mice caused an increased expression of Blimp-1 and XBP-1 mRNA (24Muto A. Tashiro S. Nakajima O. Hoshino H. Takahashi S. Sakoda E. Ikebe D. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Nature. 2004; 429: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) by placing these genes downstream of Bach2. We compared the expression of Bach2 and Blimp-1 mRNA in the B cell lines that reflect the distinct stages of B cell differentiation (38B9 pro-B, 18-81 pre-B, WEHI231 immature B, BAL17 mature B, BCL1 presecretor B, and X63/0 plasma cell lines). Bach2 showed high expression levels in the B cell lines but a very low expression in the presecretor and plasma cells at both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1, A and B). Blimp-1 mRNA and protein were very low or undetectable in pro-B, pre-B, and immature B cell lines but high in X63/0 plasma cell line. When BCL1 cells were induced to differentiate into plasma cells with IL-2 and IL-5 (26Matsui K. Nakanishi K. Cohen D.I. Hada T. Furuyama J. Hamaoka T. Higashino K. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2918-2923PubMed Google Scholar), the levels of Blimp-1 mRNA and protein increased to levels similar to those observed in X63/0 plasma cells. Therefore, the expression of Bach2 showed an inverse correlation with Blimp-1 in these cell lines and it was not expressed in cells that can express Blimp-1. The mature B cell line BAL17 cells expressed Bach2, but they also expressed low levels of Blimp-1 mRNA. In contrast to Bach2, MafK was expressed at similar levels in these cells (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these expression profiles suggest that Bach2 is either directly or indirectly involved in the stage-specific expression of Blimp-1 in plasma cells. Upon examining the DNA sequence of mouse Prdm1, we found a MARE at 1.8 kbp upstream of the transcriptional start site (Fig. 2A). This sequence was reported previously as TRE (16Vasanwala F.H. Kusam S. Toney L.M. Dent A.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1922-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This region was conserved between the mouse and human Prdm1 (Fig. 2A). To examine whether Bach2 regulates Prdm1 expression through this MARE, we generated a luciferase reporter plasmid that carried the aforementioned promoter MARE/TRE in front of a TATA-box (Fig. 2B). When transfected into 18-81 pre-B cells, the wild-type promoter MARE reporter was repressed by Bach2 in a dose-dependent manner. A reporter containing mutations in the MARE (promoter-mutMARE-luc) was not significantly repressed by Bach2 (Fig. 2C), thus indicating that the promoter MARE sequence is required for the Bach2-mediated repression of the reporter plasmid. Bach2 failed to repress the promoter MARE reporter in X63/0 plasma cells (Fig. 2D), thus raising the possibility that the repressor activity of Bach2 is regulated in a stage-specific manner. These results suggest the possibility that Bach2 repressed Prdm1 through the promoter MARE in B cells. MARE-binding Complex in B Cells Contains Bach2 and MafK—To identify proteins that bind to the promoter MARE in B cells, we performed an EMSA with nuclear extracts from WEHI231 immature B cells, BAL17 mature B cells, and X63/0 plasma cells. A retarded complex was observed with extracts from WEHI231 and BAL17 that was absent in the reactions containing nuclear extracts from X63/0 cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–4). The formation of this complex was ablated by antiserum against Bach2 (lanes 5–7) or MafK (lanes 8–10) but not by a control rabbit IgG (lanes 11 and 12), thus demonstrating that it contained both Bach2 and MafK. Whereas this complex was apparently not reduced by antiserum against Bach1, a band with a much slower mobility (i.e. supershift) was observed (Fig. 3B, lane 4). These results showed that Bach2 contributed to the majority of specific binding activity and that Bach1 also contributed to some extent. The Bach2 complex was not ablated by an unrelated antibody against Bcl6 (Fig. 3B, lane 6), thus verifying the antibody specificity. Although MafK can also function as a repressor by binding DNA as a homodimer, the homodimeric binding of MafK (i.e. band that is reactive with MafK antibody but not with other antibodies) was not observed in the extracts from the B cell lines (Fig. 3B). To verify the DNA sequence specificity of Bach2 binding to the Prdm1 promoter MARE, we carried out competition assays. As shown in Fig. 3C, the wild-type oligonucleotide inhibited the formation of Bach2-DNA complex (lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, an oligonucleotide containing mutations in the MARE failed to compete with the bound complex (lanes 6 and 7). Furthermore, the mutated DNA did not generate a protein-DNA complex as efficiently as that of the wild-type probe when the radiolabeled mutated DNA was incubated with the nuclear extracts (lanes 8 and 9). Taken together, these results suggested that the Bach2/MafK heterodimer was the major factor that bound to the promoter MARE in B cells. Purification of MafK Complex from BAL17 B Cells—The small Maf proteins (MafK, MafG, and MafF) play dual functions as activators or repressors by changing their heterodimer partners (20Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2953-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). They also function as repressors by forming homodimers when overexpressed in various cells. To examine whether Bach2 is the major partner of the small Maf proteins in B cells, we purified the MafK complex from"

In a prior study, learning an operant sensory discrimination increased cortical excitability and target selectivity. Here, the prior task was separated into three behavioral phases. First, naive animals were exposed to stimulus-reward pairings from the prior study. These yoked animals did not have to discriminate to be rewarded and did not learn the discrimination. The plasticity observed in the prior study did not occur. Second, the animals were classically conditioned to discriminate the same stimuli in a simplified format. Learning was accompanied by increased sensory response strength and an increased range of sensory inputs eliciting responses. The third study recreated the original operant discrimination, and selectivity for task targets increased. These studies demonstrate that cognitive association between sensory stimuli and reinforcers accompanies adult experience-dependent cortical plasticity and suggest that selectivity in representation and action are linked."
https://openalex.org/W2010540709,"E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is frequently lost during the development of malignant epithelial cancers. Employing a transgenic mouse model of beta-cell carcinogenesis (Rip1Tag2) we have previously shown that the loss of E-cadherin is a rate-limiting step in the progression from adenoma to carcinoma. However, the mere loss of cell adhesion may not be sufficient and additional signals are required to cause tumor cells to permeate the basal membrane and to invade surrounding tissue. Besides being an important component of the E-cadherin cell-adhesion complex, beta-catenin plays a critical role in canonical Wnt signaling. We report here that beta-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling does not contribute to tumor progression in Rip1Tag2 mice. E-cadherin downregulates beta-catenin/Tcf-mediated transcriptional activity by sequestrating beta-catenin into E-cadherin cell-adhesion complexes even in the presence of activated Wnt signaling. Upon loss of E-cadherin expression, beta-catenin is degraded and Tcf/beta-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity is not induced. Moreover, forced expression of constitutive-active beta-catenin or genetic ablation of Tcf/beta-catenin transcriptional activity in tumor cells of Rip1Tag2 transgenic mice does not affect tumor progression. Together, the data indicate that signals other than beta-catenin/Tcf-mediated Wnt signaling are induced by the loss of E-cadherin during tumor progression in Rip1Tag2 transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W2080725587,"Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is a major secretory product of odontoblasts and is critical for proper tooth dentin formation. During dentinogenesis, DSPP is proteolytically cleaved into smaller subunits. These cleavages are proposed activation steps, and failure to make these cleavages is a potential cause of developmental tooth defects. We tested the hypothesis that dentin-resident matrix metalloproteinases catalyze the cleavages that process DSPP. We defined the exact DSPP cleavages that are catalyzed by proteases during crown formation by isolating DSPP-derived proteins from developing porcine molars and characterizing their N-terminal sequences and apparent size on SDS-PAGE and Western blots. The in vivo DSPP cleavage sites were on the N-terminal sides of Thr200, Ser330, Val353, Leu360, Ile362, Ser377, Ser408, and Asp458. The initial DSPP cleavage is between dentin glycoprotein (DGP) and dentin phosphoprotein (DPP), generating dentin sialoprotein (DSP)/DGP and DPP. Gelatin and casein zymograms identified MMP-2, MMP-20, and KLK4 in the dentin extracts. MMP-2 and MMP-20 were purified from over 150 g of porcine dentin powder and incubated with DSP-DGP and DPP. These enzymes show no activity in further cleaving DPP. MMP-20 cleaves DSP-DGP to generate DSP and DGP. MMP-20 also cleaves DSP at multiple sites, releasing N-terminal DSP cleavage products ranging in size from 25 to 38 kDa. MMP-2 makes multiple cleavages near the DSP C terminus, releasing larger forms of DGP, or “extended DGPs.” Exact correspondence between DSPP cleavage sites that occur in vivo and those generated in vitro demonstrates that MMP-2 and MMP-20 process DSPP into smaller subunits in the dentin matrix during odontogenesis.

The major DSPP domains are dentin sialoprotein (DSP), dentin glycoprotein (DGP), and dentin phosphoprotein (DPP) (1Linde A. Bhown M. Butler W.T. J. Biol.

In humans, nine disease-causing mutations in the DSPP gene on chromosome 4q21.3 have been reported in kindreds with isolated inherited dentin defects (4Zhang X. Zhao J. Li C. Gao S. Qiu C. Liu P.

A. 2005; 132: 305-309Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). No other genes have been implicated in their etiology by mutation analyses. DSPP mutations result in a variety of dental phenotypes, including dentin dysplasia type II and dentinogenesis imperfecta types II and III. In mice, targeted knock-out of the Dspp gene (Dspp–/–) resulted in tooth defects resembling dentinogenesis imperfecta type III (11Sreenath T. Thyagarajan T. Hall B. Longenecker G. D'Souza R. Hong S. Wright J.T. MacDougall M. Sauk J. Kulkarni A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24874-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). DSPP is expressed in other tissues besides dentin, such as in bone (12Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cadena E. Ridall A. Tsujigiwa H. Nagatsuka H. Nagai N. Butler W.T. J. Dent. Res. 2002; 81: 392-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), but the protein levels in the secondary locations are hundreds of times lower than in dentin. Outside of a poorly understood association with progressive high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, DSPP mutations result in defects limited to the teeth. Perhaps because DSPP functions are so specialized, relatively little research has been focused on it, and many of its basic structural features are still unknown.DSPP itself has never been isolated or detected in dentin extracts. DSPP was discovered through its proteolytic cleavage products, starting with DPP (13Veis A. Perry A. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2409-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). DPP is a highly acidic phosphoprotein with an isoelectric pH of 1.1 (14Jonsson M. Fredriksson S. J. Chromatogr. 1978; 157: 234-242Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Besides its distinctive amino acid composition, dominated by serine and aspartic acid (15Dimuzio M.T. Veis A. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1978; 25: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), DPP has a conserved N-terminal sequence of Asp-Asp-Pro-Asn (1Linde A. Bhown M. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5931-5942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DPP is difficult to study at the protein level, because it is resistant to digestion by proteases, such as trypsin (16Huq N.L. Loganathan A. Cross K.J. Chen Y.Y. Johnson N.I. Willetts M. Veith P.D. Reynolds E.C. Arch. Oral. Biol. 2005; 50: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cloning and characterization of the first DPP cDNA transcript revealed the extreme redundancy of its DNA and deduced amino acid sequences (17Ritchie H.H. Wang L.H. J. Biol.

Surprisingly, the cloned DPP transcript also encoded DSP, another major noncollagenous protein in dentin (18Butler W.T. Bhown M. Brunn J.C. D'Souza R.N. Farach-Carson M.C. Happonen R.P.

Demonstration of a continuous open reading frame between the DSP and DPP coding regions disclosed that DSP and DPP are cleavage products of a larger protein, called DSPP (22MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 835-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). DGP is the most recent and smallest DSPP-derived protein to be characterized (3Yamakoshi Y. Hu J.C. Fukae M. Zhang H. Simmer J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17472-17479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). DSP is at the N terminus of DSPP, DGP is in the middle, and DPP is at the C terminus. The finding that proteolysis is necessary to generate DSP and DPP fostered the hypothesis that proteolytic cleavages are necessary activation steps and that specific proteases might be involved (23Butler W.T.

The porcine animal model has the dual advantages of large developing teeth containing ample amounts of dentin proteins and being available fresh and in quantity from meat processing facilities. Previously, we cloned and characterized DSPP cDNA, providing us with the deduced amino acid sequence of porcine DSPP excepting the redundant region in the DPP code, which was partially deleted during the cloning process (25Yamakoshi Y. Hu J.C. Liu S. Zhang C. Oida S. Fukae M. Simmer J.P. Eur. J. Oral. Sci. 2003; 111: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We determined that DSP is a proteoglycan that forms covalent dimers through an intermolecular disulfide bridge at Cys190 (21Yamakoshi Y. Hu J.C. Fukae M. Iwata T. Kim J.W. Zhang H. Simmer J.P. J. Biol.

Our objectives in the present study were to map the cleavage sites in DSPP that are used to split DSPP into its component parts during odontogenesis, isolate dentin resident matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and use them to cleave high molecular weight DSPP-derived proteins. We assume that if a dentin-resident protease cleaves DSPP at specific sites in vitro and those sites exactly match the ones used to generate DSPP-derived proteins in vivo, then that enzyme catalyzes those same DSPP cleavages in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll experimental procedures involving the use of animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Program at the University of Michigan.Generation of DGP Anti-peptide Antibodies—A synthetic 14-amino acid DSPP peptide (Glu386–Gln399; Cys-EAGKVSEDRESKGQ) from the DGP domain (Glu10–Gln23) was conjugated to the carrier protein KLH. This segment was selected, in part, because it is known to have no posttranslational modifications in the native protein. Antibodies were generated in rabbits using a protocol that included three immunizations, one test bleed, a fourth immunization, and a final bleed. Specific anti-peptide antibodies were purified from the final bleed using an affinity column containing the immobilized unconjugated DGP peptide and were ELISA-tested before being used for Western blot analyses. The anti-peptide antibody was designated pDGP. We used the chicken polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant porcine DSP expressed in bacteria that extended from Ile1 to Lys368 (21Yamakoshi Y.

The antibody dilutions used in Western blot analyses were as follows: DSP, 1:50,000; DGP, 1:2000; DMP1, 1:10,000, and MMP-2, 1:1000.Preparation of Dentin Powder—Tooth germs of permanent second molars were surgically extracted with a hammer and chisel from the maxillae and mandibles of 6-month-old pigs, within minutes of each animal's termination at the Michigan State University Meat Laboratory (East Lansing, MI). Typically, two maxillary and two mandibular second molars were obtained from each animal. The developmental stage of the molars was advanced in crown formation but prior to the onset of root formation. The soft tissue was removed with forceps, and the enamel layer was scraped off with a curette. The remaining hard tissue was reduced to powder using a jaw crusher (Retsch, Newtown, PA). About 32 molars (8 pigs) yielded 40 g of tooth powder, the amount used to extract dentin proteins.Extraction of Proteins from Dentin Powder—Forty grams of dentin powder was homogenized at 4 °C in 400 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 4 m guanidine buffer (pH 7.4) containing Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set III (1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.8 μm aprotinin, 50 μm bestatin, 15 μm E-64, 20 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin) (Calbiochem) and 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (Sigma). Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation (15,900 × g) and homogenized twice more in guanidine buffer. The combined supernatants (soluble guanidine extracts) were dialyzed against water. About ∼150 mg of protein precipitated during subsequent dialysis and was designated the guanidine/water pellet (GP). The GP fraction contained the bulk of the proteolytic activity. The guanidine/water supernatant (GS) after dialysis was lyophilized and contained ∼65 mg of protein, mostly enamel protein cleavage products. The bulk of the tooth powder was not extracted by guanidine. This guanidine-insoluble material was dialyzed against 4 liters of 0.5 m acetic acid (HAc) containing 5 mm benzamidine (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (Sigma). Each day the calcium concentration in the reservoir was measured using the calcium reagent set (Pointe Scientific, Canton, MI), and the HAc was replaced. After 10 days, the calcium ion concentration of the HAc reservoir fell below 0.2 mm, indicating that the tooth mineral was fully dissolved. The dialysis bag contents were centrifuged, and the supernatant was designated the acid (A) extract. The A extract included DGP-containing cleavage products between 22 and 30 kDa from the middle region of DSPP. The pellet was extracted with 0.5 m acetic acid, 2 m NaCl (AN), which dissolved DPP- and DSP-containing proteins. The AN supernatant was fractioned to purify high molecular weight DSPP-derived proteins.Purification of DSPP-derived Proteins—Ninety mg of the AN extract or 25 mg of A extract was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 4 m guanidine buffer (pH 7.4) and separated by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl 200 column (1.6 × 100 cm; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 4 m guanidine buffer (pH 7.4) and run at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min at 4 °C. Fractions were collected every 15 min, and the absorbance at 280 nm was determined. These procedures separated large DSPP-derived components (in the first two chromatographic peaks) from smaller contaminants in the AN extract and the smaller DGP-containing polypeptides from other constituents in the A extract.Fractions corresponding to the first two chromatographic peaks (AN-S1 and AN-S2) were combined, dialyzed against water, lyophilized, resuspended in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, and fractionated by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a Discovery (1.0 × 25-cm) C-18 column run at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and monitored at 230 nm (Buffer A: 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; Buffer B: 80% acetonitrile/Buffer A). DSP components having successively higher molecular weights comprised peaks 3–5 (ANS-R3 to R5). Fraction 2 (ANS-R2) contained DPP, which was further purified by RP-HPLC using a POROS R2 (4.6 mm × 10 cm) column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and monitored at 220 nm (Buffer A: 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; Buffer B: 80% acetonitrile/Buffer A). DPP was found in the second of three POROS R2 column fractions (ANSR2-b).Smaller DSPP-derived proteins including DGP-containing proteins were observed in the second size exclusion fraction of the A extract (A-S2), which was dialyzed against water, lyophilized, resuspended in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, and fractionated by RP-HPLC using a POROS R2 (4.6 mm × 10 cm) column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and monitored at 220 nm (Buffer A: 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; Buffer B: 80% acetonitrile/buffer A).Release of N-Linked Oligosaccharide Chains by Glycopeptidase A Digestion—The three purified DSP peaks (ANS-R3 to 5) (∼0.1 mg each) in 0.1 m citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) were incubated with 1 milliunit of glycopeptidase A (Seikagaku America, East Falmouth, MA) containing the Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set II (0.08 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 6.8 μm bestatin, 0.8 μm E-64, 0.35 mm EDTA, and 8 μm pepstatin A; Calbiochem) at 37 °C for 48 h. At the end of the incubation period, three volumes of ice-cold ethanol were added to the reaction mixture, which was then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Both supernatant and pellet were lyophilized and stored at –80 °C. An aliquot (20 μg) of the pellet was electrophoresed on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel and analyzed by Stains-all staining and Western blot analysis using the DSP antibody.Purification of Dentin Matrix Metalloproteinases—Because of the low abundance of proteases in dentin, we started the extraction with 150 g of dentin powder, which yielded ∼1.1 g of GP. The GP fraction was fractionated by anion exchange chromatography using a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (1.6 × 20 cm; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer A: 50 mm TrisHCl, 6 m urea (pH 7.4). Proteins were eluted with buffer A for 20 h, a linear gradient of buffer B (A + 0.2 m NaCl) for 5 h, and a linear gradient of buffer C (A + 2 m NaCl) for 5 h at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min at 4 °C while monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm. MMP-2 and MMP-20 cosegregated in peak 4 (GP-Q4). The GP-Q4 fraction was further fractionated by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl 200 column (1.6 × 100 cm; GE Healthcare) as described above. Both enzymes cosegregated to the first of five fractions (GPQ4-S1). Finally, this fraction was separated by RP-HPLC using a Discovery C18 column (10-mm inner diameter × 25 cm; SUPELCO, Bellefonte, PA) as described above. MMP-2 eluted in the fifth peak (GPQ4S1-R5), whereas MMP-20 eluted in the seventh (GPQ4S1-R7). The buffers of the MMP-2 and MMP-20 final fractions were replaced with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) using a YM-3 membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and stored at –80 °C for in vitro digestion of DSP-DGP and DPP. Recombinant hMMP-2 (Calbiochem) was used as a positive control in the identification of MMP-2 in Western blots.In Vitro Digestion of DSP-DGP and DPP with MMP-2 and MMP-20—Purified DSP fractions (ANS-R4 and -R5) and DPP (ANSR2-b) were directly dissolved with 0.5 ml of MMP-2 or MMP-20, CaCl2 was added to achieve a final calcium concentration of 2 mm, and the digestion was incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. Aliquots (4 μg) taken at 0, 24, and 48 h were analyzed on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels, and the degradation pattern was visualized by Stains-all staining and by Western blot analysis using the DSP polyclonal antibody.SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE was performed using Novex 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen). Samples were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), and electrophoresis was carried out using a current of 20 mA for 1.5 h. The gels were stained with Bio-Safe Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB; Bio-Rad) or Stains-all (Sigma). The apparent molecular weights of protein bands were estimated by comparison with SeeBlue® Plus2 prestained standard (Invitrogen).Western Immunoblots—Proteins were electrotransferred from SDS-PAGE onto a Hybond-P membrane (GE Healthcare), incubated with 5% blocking solution (Bio-Rad) and primary antibody (hMMP-2, overnight; DSP, 2 h; DGP, 3 h; or DMP1, overnight) diluted as described above. The membrane was immunostained by chemiluminescent detection with an ECL Plus Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).Characterization of DSPP Cleavage Products Proteins Isolated from Porcine Dentin Powder or from in Vitro Digestions—Porcine dentin powder fractions AS2-Rd, AS2-Re, AS2-Rf, and AS2-Rg containing the relatively low molecular mass (16–40-kDa) DSP- or DGP-positive proteins and the in vitro digestions of the DSP-DGP fraction (ANS-R5) were resolved on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels, electrotransferred to a Hybond-P membrane (GE Healthcare), and lightly stained with CBB, and selected membrane strips containing specific DSP or DGP bands were excised and analyzed by N-terminal sequencing.Amino Acid Analysis and Automated Edman Degradation—Purified DSP and DPP samples (0.02–0.03 mg) were hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl at 115 °C for 16 h. The amino acid analyses and Edman degradations were performed at the W. M. Keck Facility at Yale University using a Beckman model 7300 ion exchange instrument and Applied Biosystems Procise 494 cLC protein sequencer, respectively.RESULTSWe started with developing second molars from 6-month-old pigs, which were nearing crown completion (Fig. 1A). By scraping the outside of the crown with a sharp curette, we removed all but the hardest enamel. The scraped crowns were pulverized to a powder (Fig. 1B) and sent through a series of three extractions: with guanidine, acetic acid, and acetic acid with salt (Fig. 1C). These extractions yielded four fractions, the GP, GS, A extract, and AN extract, which were analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with CBB (Fig. 2A) and Stains-all (Fig. 2B), by Western blotting using the DSP (Fig. 2C), DGP (Fig. 2D), and DMP1 (Fig. 2E) antibodies, and by gelatin (Fig. 2, F and G) and casein zymography (Fig. 2H). These initial extractions separated many of the targeted dentin proteins from each other and in ample quantities for further investigation. The proteases were collected in the GP fraction. Lower molecular weight (LMW) DSP- and DGP-positive cleavage products were in the A extract. Higher molecular weight DSP- and DGP-positive proteins were in the AN extract, as was DPP. Three dentin proteases were evident on zymograms, which corresponded to enzymes previously shown to be expressed by porcine odontoblasts: MMP-2 (27Caron C. Xue J. Sun X. Simmer J.P. Bartlett J.D. J. Dent. Res. 2001; 80: 1660-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), MMP-20 (28Fukae M. Tanabe T. Uchida T. Lee S.K. Ryu O.H. Murakami C. Wakida K. Simmer J.P. Yamada Y. Bartlett J.D. J. Dent.

Bourd K. Hall R. George A. Goldberg H. Menashi S. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 143-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, we observed a 98-kDa protease-positive artifact band caused by DPP in the extract, which does not stain with CBB and therefore leaves an unstained band on the zymogram.FIGURE 2Primary dentin extracts. The four primary dentin extracts are GS, GP, A extract, and AN extract. A and B, porcine dentin powder extracts analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with CBB and Stains-all. DPP is the CBB-negative, Stains-all-positive band migrating at 98 kDa in the AN extract (a, arrowheads). C–E, Western blots of SDS-PAGE using the DSP, DGP, and DMP1 antibodies. Lower molecular weight DSP cleavage products from 22 to 38 kDa are observed in the A extract (b, bracket). Higher molecular weight DSP-positive (c, bracket) and DGP-positive (d, bracket) proteins are observed in the AN extract. Most of the lower molecular weight DGP-positive bands in the A extract are also DSP-positive except for the only DGP-positive proteins from 16 to 21 kDa (d, bracket). Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) was not detected in any of the dentin extracts. F, gelatin zymogram of dentin extracts. Strong gelatinase-positive activities are evident at 60–65 kDa (MMP-2; f, arrowheads) and 30–36 kDa (KLK4; g, arrowheads) in the GP extract. A relatively weak band at 98 kDa was observed in the AN extract (a, arrowhead). G, gelatin zymogram of dentin extracts stained with Stains-all. Stains-all staining eliminated the weak, 98-kDa band (a, arrowhead), suggesting that this gelatinase-positive band was an artifact caused by the DPP band at 98 kDa, which does not stain with CBB. H, casein zymogram of dentin extracts, which shows a weak doublet at 41 and 44 kDa (MMP-20; h, arrowheads).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Purification of LMW-DSPP Cleavage Products in the A Extract—Lower molecular weight DSP-positive proteins in the A extract (Fig. 2C) were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3A). SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses showed the target proteins remained grouped in the second fraction (Fig. 3B). The A-S2 fraction was separated by RP-HPLC, which produced a complex chromatogram yielding 14 different fractions (Fig. 3C). These fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 3, D–G). The DSP-positive proteins, which ranged from 22 to 38 kDa, grouped in fraction AS2-R2g (Fig. 3F). DGP-positive proteins, which ranged from 15 to 36 kDa, clustered in fractions AS2-R2d through AS2-R2f (Fig. 3G).FIGURE 3Purification of LMW DSPP-derived proteins from the A extract.

In addition, the AS2-R2g dentin fraction (containing LMW DSP-positive proteins) was rechromatographed and separated into five fractions (Fig. 4B). Selected bands from these fractions (Fig. 4C) were analyzed by N-terminal sequencing (Fig. 4D). The resulting N-terminal sequences identified the sites at which the dentin proteins had been cleaved in vivo.FIGURE 4Isolation and N-terminal sequencing of LMW DSP and DGP bands.

C, SDS-PAGE (left) and Western blot (DSP Ab, right) analyses of fractions AS2-Rg1 through AS2-Rg5. Two only DGP-positive bands (5 and 6), and six DSP-positive bands (7–12) were characterized by N-terminal sequencing. D, N-terminal sequences of the 13 dentin protein bands. Protein sequences 1–12 are all derived from DSPP. The prominent Stains-all-positive protein in AN2-Rj (band 13) corresponded to the N terminus of porcine 32-kDa enamelin. The number at the start of each sequence corresponds to the number of the N-terminal amino acid in the deduced porcine DSPP or enamelin sequences for the secreted protein"
https://openalex.org/W2153294236,"The mechanisms that give rise to ocular dominance columns (ODCs) during development are controversial. Early experiments indicated a key role for retinal activity in ODC formation. However, later studies showed that in those early experiments, the retinal activity perturbation was initiated after ODCs had already formed. Moreover, recent studies concluded that early eye removals do not impact ODC segregation. Here we blocked spontaneous retinal activity during the very early stages of ODC development. This permanently disrupted the anatomical organization of ODCs and led to a dramatic increase in receptive field size for binocular cells in primary visual cortex. Our data suggest that early spontaneous retinal activity conveys crucial information about whether thalamocortical axons represent one or the other eye and that this activity mediates binocular competition important for shaping receptive fields in primary visual cortex."

The molecular mechanism of the transport remains unknown. Here, we established a novel in vitro assay procedure, which includes purification of wild and mutant VGLUT2 and their reconstitution with purified bacterial FoF1-ATPase (F-ATPase) into liposomes. Upon the addition of ATP, the proteoliposomes facilitated l-glutamate uptake in a membrane potential (ΔΨ)-dependent fashion. The ATP-dependent l-glutamate uptake exhibited an absolute requirement for ∼4 mm Cl-, was sensitive to Evans blue, but was insensitive to d,l-aspartate. VGLUT2s with mutations in the transmembrane-located residues Arg184, His128, and Glu191 showed a dramatic loss in l-glutamate transport activity, whereas Na+-dependent inorganic phosphate (Pi) uptake remained comparable to that of the wild type. Furthermore, Pi transport did not require Cl- and was not inhibited by Evans blue. Thus, VGLUT2 appears to possess two intrinsic transport machineries that are independent of each other: a ΔΨ-dependent l-glutamate uptake and a Na+-dependent Pi uptake.

VGLUTs belong to the SLC17/type I anion transport family, one of the major facilitator superfamilies (MFS), and are not related to other neurotransmitter transporters such as vesicular acetylcholine transporter and vesicular monoamine transporter (2Reimer R.J.

However, no information on the transport mechanism and mechanistic relationship between the transport of l-glutamate and Pi is currently available.

Recombinant VGLUT activity can be assessed as ATP-dependent l-glutamate uptake in membrane vesicle fractions and/or in detergent-permeabilized cells (2Reimer R.J. Edwards R.H. Pflugers. Arch. 2004; 447: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 3Fremeau R.T. Voglmaier S. Seal R.P. Edwards R.H.

Biochem. 2004; 135: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, VGLUT activity measured by this procedure is too low to allow quantitative evaluation of the effect of mutations. Moreover, it is frequently observed that mutations disturb targeting of the protein to the correct cellular organelle. For instance, sialin, another member of the SLC17 family, is a lysosomal sialic acid/H+ co-transporter and targeted to the plasma membrane when mutations are introduced into its dileucine motif (21Morin P. Sagne C. Gasnier B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4560-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Wreden C.C. Wlizla M. Reimer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1408-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because the VGLUT assay procedure is based on the assumption that the transporter is targeted to acidic organelles and that endogenous ATP fully energizes V-ATPase to drive the uptake, it is not certain whether this assay is valid for mutant VGLUT. Consequently, information on mutant VGLUTs has yet to be published. In the present work, we developed a procedure to assess the activity of wild and mutant VGLUT with purified and thus, well-defined components. This procedure includes mutagenesis, expression of wild and mutant VGLUT2 in insect cells, purification, and co-reconstitution with bacterial F-ATPase. F-ATPase is a well-defined electrogenic proton pump with a pharmacological profile distinct from that of V-ATPase (23Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The proteoliposomes containing purified VGLUT2 and F-ATPase exhibit the remarkable ATP-dependent l-glutamate uptake similar to that of synaptic vesicles. We found that: 1) VGLUT2 has an absolute requirement for Cl- for the l-glutamate transport, 2) three charged amino acid residues in the transmembrane region are responsible for the l-glutamate transport activity, and 3) the transport mechanisms for l-glutamate and Pi are independent of each other. Expression—Recombinant baculoviruses containing wild type and mutant rat VGLUT2 cDNA (24Hayashi M. Otsuka M. Morimoto R. Hirota S. Yatsushiro S. Takeda J. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43400-43401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were constructed using the Bac-N-Blue and Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression systems (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. For the Bac-N-Blue system, VGLUT2 cDNA was amplified by PCR with the primers (5′-TTACAACCATGGAGTCGGTAAAACAAAG-3′ and 5′-GCTTGAATTCGAATAATCATCTCGGT-3′) and ligated into the NcoI and EcoRI sites of pBlueBacHis2b. Resultant plasmid and Bac-N-Blue DNA were used to transfect sf9 cells to generate recombinant baculovirus. For the Bac-to-Bac system, rat VGLUT2 cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primers (5′-CACCATGGAGTCGGTAAAACAAAGGATT-3′ and 5′-TTCGTTATGAATAATCATCTCGGTCCT-3′) and cloned into a pENTR/D-TOPO vector. VGLUT2 cDNA was transferred from the pENTR/D-TOPO vector to a destination vector and named pDEST10-VGLUT2. The resulting VGLUT2 gene encoded an N-terminal His6 tag. DH10Bac cells carrying bacmid DNA were transformed with pDEST10-VGLUT2. Recombinant bacmid was isolated from DH10Bac cells and used for transfection of Sf9 cells to generate recombinant baculoviruses. Sf9 or High Five cells were used for expression of VGLUT2 protein. Sf9 cells (2 × 107 cells/10-cm dish) were grown in complete TNM-FH medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.25 μg/ml Fungizone and 100 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin at 27 °C. Alternatively, High Five cells (1 × 107 cells/10-cm dish) were grown in Express Five medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 μg/ml gentamicin at 27 °C. Cells were infected by recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 2 and cultured a further 72 h for sf9 and 48 h for High Five. Afterward, the cells were harvested for membrane preparation. Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced to pDEST10-VGLUT2 by PCR. The sequence was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The following primers were used: R88A, 5′-GTTACAGGCGATACCAAAGG-3′; H128A, 5′-CCCGGCAATCATCCCCACAGTCT-3′; R184A, 5′-CAATATTGCAACAAAGATGACGCA-3′; R184K, 5′-CAATATTTTAACAAAGATGACGCA-3′; R184E, 5′-CAATATTTCAACAAAGATGACGCA-3′; E191D, 5′-GTCGACGGCGTCACCTACCCA-3′; E191Q, 5′-GGTGACGCCCTGCACAAGTC-3′; E191A, 5′-AGGTGACGCCGGCCACAAGTCC-3′; and R322A, 5′-AAGTCCAACTCGCGCAGAAGTTT-3′. Purification—Insect cells (1 ∼ 2 × 107 cells/dish) were suspended in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m potassium acetate, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin and disrupted by sonication with a TOMY UD200 tip sonifier. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min to remove debris, and the resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 160,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet (membrane fraction) was suspended in buffer containing 20 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin (∼1.5 mg protein/ml). The membrane fraction was solubilized by addition of octyl glucoside (2% final) to suspension. After centrifugation at 260,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was added to 1 ml of Ni-NTA Superflow resin (Qiagen) and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with shaking. The resin was poured into a column and washed with 10 ml 20 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.0, 5 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol and 1% octyl glucoside. VGLUT2 was eluted from the resin with 3 ml of the same buffer containing 60 mm imidazole. The eluate containing purified VGLUT2 was stored at -80 °C. Bacterial F-ATPase was expressed in Escherichia coli cells strain DK8/pBWU13 and purified by glycerol density gradient centrifugation as described previously (25Moriyama Y. Iwamoto A. Hanada H. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22141-22146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstitution—Co-reconstitution of purified recombinant VGLUT2 and bacterial F-ATPase into liposomes was carried out by the freeze-thaw method described in Ref. 25Moriyama Y. Iwamoto A. Hanada H. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22141-22146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. In brief, 10 μg of VGLUT2 was mixed with 90 μg of F-ATPase and prepared liposomes (0.5 mg lipid; see below), frozen at -80 °C and left at this temperature for at least 5 min. The mixture was thawed quickly by holding the tube in the hands and diluted 60-fold with reconstitution buffer (20 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m potassium acetate and 5 mm magnesium acetate). Reconstituted proteoliposomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 160,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and suspended in 0.4 ml of 20 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.0 containing 4 mm KCl, 0.1 m potassium acetate and 5 mm magnesium acetate. Proteoliposomes for phosphate transport assay were prepared without F-ATPase. Liposomes were prepared as follows: soybean lecithin (20 mg; Sigma Type IIS) was suspended in 2 ml 20 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The mixture was sonicated in a bath-type sonicator until clear, divided into small aliquots, and stored at -80 °C until use. Protease Treatment—Reconstituted proteoliposomes (50 μg/ml) were incubated for 1 h at 27 °C in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.0, 100 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.5 μg/ml trypsin. Digestion was terminated by the adding of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 1 mm. The reaction mixture was analyzed on a dot blot probed with antibodies specific for the first loop region (G86-G134) of VGLUT2 (26Jung S.K. Morimoto R. Otsuka M. Omote H. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2006; 29: 547-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Transport Assay—Reconstituted proteoliposomes (5 μg of total protein) were suspended in 20 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 4 mm KCl, and 0.1 m potassium acetate and incubated for 3 min at 27 °C. ATP was added to give a final concentration of 2 mm and the mixture incubated for a further 3 min. The assay was initiated by addition of l-[2,3-3H]glutamate (0.5 MBq/μmol), and 130-μl aliquots were taken at the times indicated and centrifuged through a Sephadex G-50 (fine) spin column at 180 × g for 1 min (27Moriyama Y. Tsai H.L. Futai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Radioactivity of the eluate was measured. For Na+-driven Pi transport, reaction was started by the addition of proteoliposomes to the reaction mixture containing 20 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 m sodium acetate and 100 μm [32P]Na2HPO4 (3.7 MBq/μmol). Throughout the study, the results on transport assays are expressed as means ± S.E., n = 3. Homology Modeling—The structural model of VGLUT2 was generated by MODELLER 6 V3 (28Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10448) Google Scholar) based on the three-dimensional crystal structure of glycerol-3-phosphate transporter (PDB code 1PW4) (29Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.-N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) after sequence alignment using ClustalX (30Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55409) Google Scholar). Miscellaneous Procedures—Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS and Western blotting were performed as described (25Moriyama Y. Iwamoto A. Hanada H. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22141-22146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of ΔpH (acidic inside) and ΔΨ (positive inside) were measured by fluorescence quenching techniques with acridine orange and oxonol V, respectively, using a Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer as described previously (18Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22314-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 25Moriyama Y. Iwamoto A. Hanada H. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22141-22146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was assayed using bovine serum albumin as a standard (31Schaffner W. Weiβmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar). Internal volume of proteoliposomes were determined by measurement of exclusive volume with [14C]mannitol as a nonpermeable molecule. Expression, Purification, and Reconstitution of VGLUT2— We employed a baculovirus overexpression system for the expression and purification of wild and mutant VGLUT2. Upon infection, the High Five cells expressed His-tagged VGLUT2 as revealed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). Maximum expression was obtained 48-72 h after infection at an m.o.i. of 1 ∼ 2. The membrane vesicles prepared from insect cells did not show any ATP-dependent l-glutamate uptake under the standard assay conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” After solubilization of the membrane fraction with octyl glucoside, VGLUT2 was purified to near homogeneity by Ni-NTA column chromatography (Fig. 1B, lane 4). The extent of enrichment over membranes, which was roughly estimated by Western blot analysis, was 4.0-fold for Sf9 cells and 5.5-fold for High Five cells with recoveries of ∼3 and ∼50%, respectively. Hence, we used High Five cells for purification of VGLUT2. Purified VGLUT2 was incorporated into liposomes with purified bacterial F-ATPase using the freeze/thaw/dilution procedure. The resultant proteoliposomes contained VGLUT2 as well as F-ATPase (Fig. 1B). Almost 50% of the cytoplasmic region of VGLUT2 incorporated in proteoliposomes was accessible to digestion with excess trypsin, indicating that about half of the VGLUT2 was oriented with the cytoplasmic face directed to the outside of the vesicle. F-ATPase-coupled l-Glutamate Uptake—Because VGLUT utilizes ΔΨ as the driving force of l-glutamate uptake, generation of a stable ΔΨ is required for the in vitro transport assay. We used F-ATPase as a generator of ΔΨ. Upon the addition of ATP, the proteoliposomes facilitated l-glutamate uptake in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Omission of VGLUT reduced the uptake to a very low background level, indicating that VGLUT2 was an obligatory factor for the l-glutamate uptake (Table 1). Omission of F-ATPase reduced l-glutamate uptake to the same extent as omitting ATP, suggesting that l-glutamate uptake was the sum of active and passive transport through VGLUT (Table 1). Because the internal volume of the reconstituted proteoliposomes corresponded to 0.034% of total reaction mixture, the concentration gradient of l-glutamate across liposomal membrane was around 7-fold under steady state conditions. Establishment of the l-glutamate concentration gradient was also confirmed by the addition of 1 μm CCCP: this proton conductor caused rapid release of internal l-glutamate accumulated in proteoliposomes (supplemental Fig. S1).TABLE 1Reconstitution and the effects of various ligands on l-glutamate uptake l-Glutamate uptake was measured in the presence or absence of various ligands as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reconstituted vesicles were preincubated with these ligands for 2 min before addition of ATP. l-Glutamate uptake at 5 min was determined in the presence of 100 μm l-glutamate. l-Glutamate uptake of the complete reaction was 18.9 ± 1.6 (nmol/mg total protein/5 min). For control reactions without F-ATPase or VGLUT2, the same volume of proteoliposome mixture as the complete sample was used.Systeml-Glutamate uptake%Complete100.0 ± 8.4-VGLUT25.9 ± 0.6-F-ATPase18.4 ± 2.2-ATP22.1 ± 2.9Complete + 1 mm NaN314.1 ± 2.7Complete + 1 μm Bafilomycin A185.3 ± 3.5Complete + 1 μm Evans blue21.3 ± 2.9Complete + 10 mm d,l-aspartate98.1 ± 3.7Complete + 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide93.2 ± 7.2Complete + 1 μm CCCP27.0 ± 5.3Complete + 2 mm (NH4)2SO495.5 ± 9.3Complete + 2 μm valinomycin46.8 ± 4.1Complete + 2 μm nigericin72.6 ± 3.0Complete + 2 μm valinomycin + 2 μm nigericin18.0 ± 1.6 Open table in a new tab The l-glutamate uptake was inhibited by azide, a F-ATPase inhibitor, but not by bafilomycin A1, a V-ATPase inhibitor, indicating a successful switch from the primary H+-pump of V-ATPase to F-ATPase (Table 1). Both ATP-dependent and independent l-glutamate uptake exhibited saturation kinetics (Fig. 2B). The apparent Km and Vmax values of ATP-dependent l-glutamate uptake were 4.8 mm and 120 nmol/mg/min for l-glutamate, respectively (Fig. 2B). The Km and Vmax of the purified system were ∼4- and 14-fold higher than l-glutamate uptake in synaptic vesicles, respectively (32Wolosker H. de Souza D.O. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11726-11731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The reason for the increased Km value is considered under “Discussion.” The purified VGLUT2 can be stored at -80 °C for at least a few months without loss of the transport activity. Properties of l-Glutamate Uptake—Unique properties of VGLUT have been elucidated during the past decade, such as the requirement for ΔΨ as the driving force, insensitivity to d,l-aspartate, sensitivity to Evans blue, and the dependence on Cl- (1Maycox P.R. Hell J.W. Jahn R. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 83-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 15Naito S. Ueda T. J.

Yamamoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22314-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, these properties were obtained with synaptic vesicle fractions that contained many other proteins that could interfere with interpretation of the data. We, therefore, reevaluated the basic properties of VGLUT2 (Table 1). The ATP-dependent l-glutamate uptake was sensitive to carbonylcyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), indicating that ΔμH+ drove the uptake. Valinomycin reduced the l-glutamate uptake to 47% of the control, while nigericin in the presence of K+ showed limited effect. A combination of valinomycin and nigericin abolished the activity. Furthermore, ammonium sulfate, a dissipator of transmembrane pH gradient (ΔpH) but not of ΔΨ, did not affect the l-glutamate uptake. These results indicated that ΔΨ was a much stronger driving force for uptake than was ΔpH. High concentrations of d,l-aspartate did not affect l-glutamate uptake. Evans blue, a known inhibitor of VGLUT (33Roseth S. Fyske E.M. Fonnum F. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 34Thompson C.M. Davis E. Carrigan S. Cox H.D. Bridges R.J. Gerdes J.M. Curr. Med. Chem. 2005; 12: 2041-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), prevented l-glutamate uptake. Furthermore, preincubation of VGLUT2 with 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide failed to inhibit l-glutamate uptake, suggesting that VGLUT2 does not have N-ethylmaleimide-accessible cysteine residues that are important for the transport activity. Requirement for Cl-—The most remarkable feature of VGLUT is its biphasic dependence on Cl- for l-glutamate uptake in synaptic vesicles (15Naito S. Ueda T. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 16Maycox P.R. Deckwerth T. Hell J.W. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15423-15428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hartinger J. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23122-23127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22314-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar): ATP-dependent l-glutamate uptake is stimulated by low concentrations of Cl- (∼4 mm) and inhibited at higher concentrations of Cl-. In our purified system, an almost absolute requirement of Cl- was observed; essentially no ATP-dependent l-glutamate uptake is observed in the absence of Cl-. Then, the ATP-dependent uptake activity appeared upon the addition of Cl- and was maximal at ∼4 mm, gradually decreased with increasing concentrations of Cl- (Fig. 3). Under these conditions, the ATP-dependent generation of ΔΨ as detected by oxonol-V fluorescence, was maximal in the absence of Cl- and continuously decreased with increasing Cl- concentrations, while ΔpH, as detected by acridine orange fluorescence, is negligible in the absence of Cl- and increases with Cl- concentration. Thus, VGLUT2 obligatory requires Cl- for the l-glutamate uptake, and the biphasic Cl- effect is because of a combination of activation of VGLUT2 by Cl- and decreased driving force by higher Cl- concentrations. Mutational Analysis—Recent analyses of structure-function relationship of membrane transporters have pointed out the functional importance of the conserved charged amino acid residues in transmembrane domains. The topological model of VGLUT2 predicts twelve transmembrane spanning helices (26Jung S.K. Morimoto R. Otsuka M. Omote H. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2006; 29: 547-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); several charged amino acid residues have been identified that are conserved in these putative transmembrane regions of the SLC17 or VGLUT families (19Ni B.

https://openalex.org/W2024275092,"Endometrial cancer is the third most common gynecologic malignancy and the ninth most common malignancy for females overall in Hong Kong. Approximately 80% or more of these cancers are endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinomas. The aim of this study was to reveal genes contributing to the development of endometrioid endometrial cancer, which may impact diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of the disease. Whole-genome gene expression analysis was completed for a set of 55 microdissected sporadic endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinomas and 29 microdissected normal endometrium specimens using the Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide microarray. Selected genes of interest were validated by quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Pathway analysis was performed to reveal gene interactions involved in endometrial tumorigenesis. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering displayed a distinct separation between the endometrioid adenocarcinomas and normal endometrium samples. Supervised analysis identified 117 highly differentially regulated genes (⩾4.0-fold change), which distinguished the endometrial cancer specimens from normal endometrium. Twelve novel genes including DKK4, ZIC1, KIF1A, SAA2, LOC16378, ALPP2, CCL20, CXCL5, BST2, OLFM1, KLRC1 and MBC45780 were deregulated in the endometrial cancer, and further validated in an independent set of 56 cancer and 29 normal samples using qRT-PCR. In addition, 10 genes were differentially regulated in late-stage cancer, as compared to early-stage disease, and may be involved in tumor progression. Pathway analysis of the expression data from this tumor revealed an interconnected network consisting of 21 aberrantly regulated genes involved in angiogenesis, cell proliferation and chromosomal instability. The results of this study highlight the molecular features of endometrioid endometrial cancer and provide insight into the events underlying the development and progression of endometrioid endometrial cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2017675745,"Functional imaging signals arise from metabolic and hemodynamic activity, but how these processes are related to the synaptic and electrical activity of neurons is not well understood. To provide insight into this issue, we used in vivo imaging and simultaneous local pharmacology to study how sensory-evoked neural activity leads to intrinsic optical signals (IOS) in the well-defined circuitry of the olfactory glomerulus. Odor-evoked IOS were tightly coupled to release of glutamate and were strongly modulated by activation of presynaptic dopamine and GABA-B receptors. Surprisingly, IOS were independent of postsynaptic transmission through ionotropic or metabotropic glutamate receptors, but instead were inhibited when uptake by astrocytic glutamate transporters was blocked. These data suggest that presynaptic glutamate release and uptake by astrocytes form a critical pathway through which neural activity is linked to metabolic processing and hence to functional imaging signals."

Although the opposite phenomenon of desynchronization is well known from EEG studies, it is largely neglected on the neuronal level. We here provide an example of in vivo recordings from weakly electric fish demonstrating that, depending on the social context, different types of natural communication signals elicit transient desynchronization as well as synchronization of the electroreceptor population without changing the mean firing rate. We conclude that, in general, both positive and negative changes in the degree of synchrony can be the relevant signals for neural information processing."
https://openalex.org/W2020890069,"Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with poor prognosis. Production of large quantities of extracellular matrix and early metastasis are characteristics of this disease. One important step in the development of various cancers is the loss of E-cadherin gene expression or inactivation of E-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion. It has been shown that collagen type I promotes downregulation of E-cadherin expression, which correlates with enhanced cell migration and invasiveness. In this context, we elucidated the role of Smad-interacting protein 1 (SIP1), which has been discussed as a negative regulator of E-cadherin gene expression. We demonstrate that SIP1 upregulation shows an inverse relationship with E-cadherin in advanced pancreatic tumour stages. In Panc-1 cells, SIP1 expression can be induced by exposure to collagen type I in a src-dependent manner. In addition, overexpression of SIP1 reduces E-cadherin mRNA and protein levels. Taken together, these results suggest that SIP1 is involved in the progression of pancreatic cancer and plays a role in mediating signal transduction from collagen type I to downregulate E-cadherin expression."
https://openalex.org/W2037332721,"Ionizing radiation exposure results in the activation of several tyrosine kinase receptors that participate in radiation-induced DNA damage response and radioresistance. We previously showed that insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) inhibition enhanced radiosensitivity of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. In this paper, we demonstrate that in U1810 NSCLC cells γ-radiation activates IGF-1R within 10 min, with a maximal activation effect 2 h post-irradiation. Impairment of IGF-1R tyrosine kinase activity enhances human lung cancer cells radiosensitivity by a mechanism that involves phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and p38 kinase. In an active form, IGF-1R binds and activates p38 kinase, promoting receptor signaling. Conversely, inhibition of IGF-1R phosphorylation results in IGF-1R/p38 complex disruption and p38 kinase inactivation. We have also demonstrated that in insulin-like growth factor-1-stimulated cells, Ku-DNA-binding activation is induced by ionizing radiation within 4 h, reaches a maximum level at 12 h and remains active up to 72 h. Blockade of IGF-1R activity or its downstream signaling through p38 kinase induces a decrease in radiation-mediated Ku-DNA-binding activation and downregulates the level of Ku86, without affecting Ku70 expression in the nucleus of U1810 cells. The IGF-1R signaling via PI3-K does not interfere with the p38 signaling, the Ku-DNA-binding activity or the level of Ku86. Our present study demonstrates for the first time that ionizing radiation activates IGF-1R. Inhibition of IGF-1R signaling via p38 kinase induces radiosensitivity by a novel mechanism involving nuclear Ku86."
https://openalex.org/W2007573950,"PTEN, encoding a lipid phosphatase, is a tumor suppressor gene and is mutated in various types of cancers. It is reported to regulate G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle by influencing the expression, protein stability and subcellular location of cyclin D1. Here, we provide evidence that PTEN modulates the transcription and protein stability of cyclin D2. Targeted deletion of Pten in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) endowed cells with greater potential to overcome G1 arrest than wild-type MEFs and led to the elevated expression of cyclin D2, which was suppressed by the introduction of PTEN. We further defined a pathway involving GSK3beta and beta-catenin/TCF in PTEN-mediated suppression of cyclin D2 transcription. LiCl, an inhibitor of GSK3beta, abolished inhibitory effect of PTEN on cyclin D2 expression, and TCF members could directly bind to the promoter of cyclin D2 and regulate its transcription in a CREB-dependent manner. Our results indicate that the downregulation of cyclin D2 expression by PTEN is mediated by the GSK3beta/beta-catenin/TCF pathway in cooperation with CREB, and suggest a convergence from the PI-3 kinase/PTEN pathway and the Wnt pathway in modulation of cyclin D2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2149194080,"Protein tyrosine O-sulfation is a post-translational modification mediated by one of two Golgi tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases (TPST1 and TPST2) that catalyze the transfer of sulfate to tyrosine residues in secreted and transmembrane proteins. Tyrosine sulfation plays a role in protein-protein interactions in several well defined systems. Although dozens of tyrosine-sulfated proteins are known, many more are likely to exist and await description. Advancing our understanding of the importance of tyrosine sulfation in biological systems requires the development of new tools for the detection and study of tyrosine-sulfated proteins. We have developed a novel anti-sulfotyrosine monoclonal antibody (called PSG2) that binds with high affinity and exquisite specificity to sulfotyrosine residues in peptides and proteins independently of sequence context. We show that it can detect tyrosine-sulfated proteins in complex biological samples and can be used as a probe to assess the role of tyrosine sulfation in protein function. We also demonstrate the utility of PSG2 in the purification of tyrosine-sulfated proteins from crude tissue samples. Finally, Western blot analysis using PSG2 showed that certain sperm/epididymal proteins are undersulfated in Tpst2-/- mice. This indicates that TPST1 and TPST2 have distinct macromolecular substrate specificities and provides clues as to the molecular mechanism of the infertility of Tpst2-/- males. PSG2 should be widely applicable for identification of tyrosine-sulfated proteins in other systems and organisms.

PSG2 should be widely applicable for identification of tyrosine-sulfated proteins in other systems and organisms. Protein tyrosine O-sulfation is a post-translational modification that occurs in most eukaryotes (1Huttner W.B. Nature. 1982; 299: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 3Huttner W.B. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 6: 97-140Google Scholar). In mouse and man, tyrosine sulfation is mediated by one of only two tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases (EC 2.8.2.20), TPST1 and TPST2 (4Ouyang Y.B. Lane W.S. Moore K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2896-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 6Beisswanger R. Corbeil D. Vannier C. Thiele C. Dohrmann U. Kellner R. Ashman K. Niehrs C. Huttner W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11134-11139Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These enzymes catalyze the transfer of sulfate from 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate, the universal sulfate donor, to tyrosine residues in polypeptides (7Lee R.W. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11326-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TPST enzymes are type II transmembrane proteins that reside in the trans-Golgi network and have luminally oriented catalytic domains (4Ouyang Y.B. Lane W.S. Moore K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2896-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 6Beisswanger R. Corbeil D. Vannier C. Thiele C. Dohrmann U. Kellner R. Ashman K. Niehrs C. Huttner W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, tyrosine sulfation occurs only on soluble and transmembrane proteins that transit the Golgi en route to either secretion or incorporation into the plasma membrane. Accordingly, all of the native tyrosine-sulfated proteins described to date fall into one of these two categories (2Moore K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24243-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Consensus features for tyrosine sulfation have been proposed based on the amino acid sequences flanking known sulfation sites coupled with in vitro studies on the sulfation of various synthetic peptides (PROSITE accession number PS00003). In addition, a software tool for prediction of tyrosine sulfation sites in proteins called Sulfinator has been developed (9Monigatti F. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Jung E. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2002; 15: 769-770Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, the positive predictive value of these features and the Sulfinator tool is not known. Some known tyrosine sulfation sites do not fulfill proposed consensus features, and some are not predicted by Sulfinator. Thus, unlike some other post-translational modifications, there is no way to reliably predict sites of sulfation. Tyrosine sulfation plays a role in protein-protein interactions in several well defined systems. For example, tyrosine sulfation of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1 2The abbreviations used are: PSGL-1, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1; HCII, heparin cofactor II; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pY, phosphotyrosine; sY, sulfotyrosine; scFv, single chain Fv; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; MBS, MOPS-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; NRK, normal rat kidney; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; FTICR, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride. 2The abbreviations used are: PSGL-1, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1; HCII, heparin cofactor II; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pY, phosphotyrosine; sY, sulfotyrosine; scFv, single chain Fv; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; MBS, MOPS-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; NRK, normal rat kidney; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; FTICR, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride.; CD162) expressed on leukocytes is required for cell-cell interactions mediated by P- and L-selectins in the vasculature (10Wilkins P.P.

In the co-crystal of the lectin/epidermal growth factor domain of P-selectin and a recombinant glycosulfopeptide mimetic of the N-terminal domain of PSGL-1, the sulfate groups at Tyr48 and Tyr51 are involved in direct protein-protein contacts with P-selectin (13Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T. Cell. 2000; 103: 467-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). A great deal of recent interest has focused on the role of tyrosine sulfation in G-protein-coupled receptor function after Farzan et al. (14Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) showed that CCR5, a major human immunodeficiency virus coreceptor, is tyrosine-sulfated. Sulfation of 1 or more tyrosine residues in the N-terminal extracellular domain of CCR5 is required for optimal binding of CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 and for optimal human immunodeficiency virus coreceptor function. Similar studies indicated that tyrosine sulfation of the N-terminal domains of other chemokine receptors (CXCR4, CCR2B, CX3CR1, CCR8, CXCR3) as well as other G-protein-coupled receptors (C5a; C3a; SIP1; and the follicle-stimulating, luteinizing, and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors), is required for optimal binding of their cognate ligands (2Moore K.L.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4622-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). However, for many of the known tyrosine-sulfated proteins, there is no information on the role of the sulfotyrosine residue(s) in protein function. Many more tyrosine-sulfated proteins are likely to exist and await description. However, the pace of discovery has been very slow. One the major barriers to developing a full understanding of the importance of tyrosine sulfation in biological systems has been a lack of a facile means to identify additional tyrosinesulfated proteins and probes to explore the role of tyrosine sulfation in protein function. An antibody reagent able to detect sulfotyrosine residues would be highly desirable. We attempted to generate anti-sulfotyrosine monoclonal antibodies using the strategy employed by Glenney et al. (29Glenney Jr., J.R. Zokas L. Kamps M.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 109: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) to generate anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies. However, we failed to generate detectable antibody responses to sulfotyrosine in mice. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel anti-sulfotyrosine antibody generated using phage display technology. We show that this antibody binds with high affinity and exquisite specificity to sulfotyrosine residues in peptides and proteins independently of the sequence context. Furthermore, we show that it can detect tyrosine-sulfated proteins in complex biological samples, and we demonstrate its utility in affinity purification of tyrosine-sulfated proteins from crude tissue samples. Materials—Human neutrophil PSGL-1 and human platelet P-selectin were purified as described previously (30Moore K.L. Eaton S.F. Lyons D.E. Lichenstein H.S. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol.

Purified bovine factors X1 and X2 were provided by Charles Esmon (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation), and human heparin cofactor II (HCII) expressed in Escherichia coli (32Han J.H. Tollefsen D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3203-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was a gift from Douglas Tollefsen (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Purified human plasma C4 was purchased from Advanced Research Technology (San Diego, CA), and human plasma HCII and mouse fibrinogen were from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Phosphotyrosine (pY) and sulfotyrosine (sY) were purchased from Sigma and Bachem, respectively. The pentapeptides LDYDF, LD(sY)DF, and LD(pY)DF were synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified (>95% purity) by Biosynthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (mAb) PY20 was purchased from MP Biomedicals. Identification of Antibody Binding to Sulfotyrosine—A single chain Fv (scFv) phagemid library, an expanded version of the 1.38 × 1010 library (33Vaughan T.J. Williams A.J. Pritchard K. Osbourn J.K.

Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar), was used to select antibodies that bind to a protein containing sulfated tyrosines. The immobilized target protein was the purified dimeric 19ek.Fc recombinant protein (13Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T. Cell. 2000; 103: 467-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), which contains three sulfated tyrosines within the N-terminal 19 amino acids of human PSGL-1 (QATE(sY)E-(sY)LD(sY)DFLPETEPP) and is fused to human IgG1 Fc via an enterokinase cleavage site. Several scFv clones were isolated following multiple rounds of a panning procedure (33Vaughan T.J. Williams A.J. Pritchard K. Osbourn J.K. Pope A.R. Earnshaw J.C. McCafferty J. Hodits R.A. Wilton J. Johnson K.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The purified PSG2 scFv clone was identified as an scFv fragment whose binding to 19.ek.Fc was inhibited in the presence of increasing concentrations of the murine PSGL-1/Fc fusion protein, which contains sulfated tyrosines within a different sequence context (34Yang J. Galipeau J. Kozak C.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4176-4186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PSG2 scFv fragment was converted to a full-length intact IgG4λ antibody (designated PSG2) and expressed in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells as described (35Thompson J.E. Vaughan T.J. Williams A.J. Wilton J. Johnson K.S. Bacon L. Green J.A. Field R. Ruddock S. Martins M. Pope A.R. Tempest P.R. Jackson R.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 227: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). PSG2 Purification—PSG2-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells were expanded from a single vial of frozen cells in α-minimal essential medium (Mediatech, Inc.) containing 10% heatinactivated dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 nm methotrexate, 1 mg/ml G418, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin into 850-cm2 roller bottles. At ≈90% confluence, the serum-containing medium was removed; the monolayer washed with warm phosphate-buffered saline; and the medium was replaced with α-minimal essential medium, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The conditioned medium was harvested and replaced with fresh medium twice each week until senescence. The conditioned medium was clarified by centrifugation, followed by addition of benzamidine toa 5 mm final concentration, sterilization by passage through a 0.2-μm filter, and freezing at -20 °C. To purify PSG2, the conditioned medium was batch-adsorbed to protein G-Sepharose overnight at room temperature; the resin was packed into a column and washed extensively with MOPS-buffered saline (MBS; 0.1 m NaCl and 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5); and bound mAb was eluted with ImmunoPure® Gentle Ag/Ab Elution Buffer (Pierce). Eluted mAb was exhaustively dialyzed against MBS, clarified by centrifugation (48,000 × g, 30 min), and stored at -80 °C. The purified IgG was >95% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE. The purified material co-eluted with an IgG standard on a Tosoh Bioscience G3000 SWXL size exclusion column (7.8 × 300 mm) using 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.7, as the mobile phase. Epitope Mapping—Peptide spot synthesis was performed as described previously (36Bridges K.G. Chopra R. Lin L. Svenson K. Tam A. Jin G. Cowling R. Lovering F. Akopian T.N. DiBlasio-Smith E. Annis-Freeman B. Marvell T.H. LaVallie E.R. Zollner R.S. Bard J. Somers W.S. Stahl M.L. Kriz R.W. Peptides (N.Y.). 2006; 27: 1877-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The arrays were defined on the membranes by coupling a β-alanine spacer, and peptides were synthesized using standard diisopropyl carbodiimide/hydroxybenzotriazole coupling chemistry as described previously (37Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 38Molina F. Laune D. Gougat C. Pau B. Granier C. Pept. Res. 1996; 9: 151-155PubMed Google Scholar). Activated amino acids were spotted using an Abimed ASP 222 robot, and the washing and Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) deprotection steps were done manually. Following the final synthesis cycle, the membranes were treated with acetic anhydride, and side chains were deprotected, resulting in an array of peptides that were N-terminally acetylated and attached via the C terminus. Membranes were washed with methanol, blocked with 1% casein in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 100 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.9), and then incubated with 1 μg/ml PSG2 in TBS for 1 h with gentle shaking. The membranes were washed four times for 2 min with TBS and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-Fc antibody in TBS and 1% casein. After washing with TBS, bound protein was visualized using Super Signal West reagent (Pierce) and a digital camera. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—All samples were electrophoresed on 4-15% Tris-HCl/SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). For Coomassie Blue staining, 1 μg of purified proteins was loaded, whereas for Western blotting, 10-20 ng of proteins was loaded. For Western blotting, the PSG2 or control IgG4λ mAb was used as primary antibody at 30 ng/ml, followed by 200 ng/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG as secondary antibody. Bound secondary antibody was detected using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences), followed by either autoradiography or imaging on a Storm 860 scanner (GE Healthcare). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—Microtiter plates (Immulon 1B, Dynex) were coated with bovine factor X1 or X2 (5 μg/ml, 100 μl/well) in sodium carbonate, pH 9.6, overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, blocked with TBS and 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h, and washed twice with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Tyrosine sulfate, tyrosine phosphate, or various peptides in MBS were added (50 μl/well) to triplicate wells. PSG2 (60 ng/ml, 50 μl/well) in MBS was then added to all wells. After 1 h, plates were washed five times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG in the same buffer was added (100 μl/well) and incubated for 1 h. Plates were washed five times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and then 2,2′-azinodi(3-ethylbenzthiazoline 6-sulfonate) peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.) was added (100 μl/well). Plates were read at 405 nm using a VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp.). Pervanadate Treatment of Normal Rat Kidney (NRK) Cells—NRK cells (ATCC CRL-6509) were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mml-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. A fresh stock solution of pervanadate ions (30 mm) was prepared by combining 100 μl of 100 mm Na3VO4, 10 μl of 30% H2O2, and 223 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, followed by incubation in the dark for 10 min at room temperature. NRK cells were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in complete medium alone or containing 100 μm pervanadate. After 30 min, the medium was removed, and the cells were detached and collected by centrifugation (90 × g, 5 min). Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation, and cell pellets were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 160 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Lysates were incubated in the dark for 20 min at 4 °C and then clarified by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Protein content was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and lysates were snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C until used. Glycan Array Screening—The PSG2 mAb was used to screen a glycan microarray (Glycan Array version 3.5) at the Protein-Glycan Interaction Core of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center) as described previously (39Bochner B.S.

In total, 206 unique glycans are represented on the array. Briefly, biotinylated glycosides (40Korchagina E. Bovina N.V. Bioorg. Khim. 1992; 18: 283-298PubMed Google Scholar) were bound to streptavidin-coated microtiter plates in replicates of four. Purified bovine factors X1 and X2 were biotinylated using sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce) and included on the array (30 pmol/well) as negative and positive controls, respectively. Precoated plates were washed three times with 100 μl of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20). The PSG2 mAb (10 μg/ml) in wash buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin was added to each well and incubated for 1 h. The plates were washed, and 25 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human IgG (2 μg/ml) in wash buffer was added and incubated for 1 h. The wells were washed three times; 25 μl of wash buffer was added to each well; and bound secondary antibody was detected using a VICTOR2™ 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 535 nm, respectively. Generation of Tpst Double Knock-out Mice—Tpst1-null (Tpst1tm1Klm, MGI:2183366) and Tpst2-null (Tpst2tm1Klm, MGI:3512111) mice were generated and characterized as described previously (41Ouyang Y.B.

The Tpst1 and Tpst2 genes reside on chromosome 5, and the physical distance between the two is ≈18.4 megabases. To generate the Tpst double knock-out mice, Tpst1-/- males were mated with Tpst2-/- females to generate obligate in trans compound heterozygotes. Male and female offspring from this cross were mated, and their offspring were screened by PCR for the presence of the wild-type and mutant alleles at both loci as described (41Ouyang Y.B.

Briefly, 2 ml of 1 μg/ml human platelet P-selectin in Hanks' balanced salt solution was coated on 35-mm tissue culture plates overnight at 4 °C and blocked with 1% human serum albumin in Hank's balanced salt solution for 2 h at room temperature. Human neutrophils were isolated as described previously (44Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 76: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), resuspended at 4 × 106 cells/ml in Hank's balanced salt solution and 1% human serum albumin, and perfused over the P-selection surface at a wall shear stress of 1 dyne/cm2. Neutrophil adhesion was allowed to equilibrate for 4 min, and then non-adherent cells were flushed from the system with Hank's balanced salt solution and 1% human serum albumin. After an additional 4 min of perfusion, the control human IgG4λ (50 μg/ml) or PSG2 (50 μg/ml) mAb was added to the perfusate. Neutrophil adhesion was visualized by phase-contrast video microscopy, and the number of rolling neutrophils was determined every 20 s. PSG2 Affinity Chromatography and Peptide Sequencing—Epididymides were collected from 10 sexually mature wild-type mice and homogenized in cold MBS containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science) using a Dounce homogenizer. A post-nuclear supernatant was obtained (800 × g, 10 min), which was then subjected to centrifugation (100,000 × g, 60 min) to prepare a soluble protein fraction. The soluble fraction (8.5 ml, ≈28 mg of total protein) was applied to a PSG2-Affi-Gel-10 column (4 mg of mAb/ml of resin, 0.9 × 5 cm) at 50 μl/min. The column was washed extensively with MBS and then with 100 mm NH4OAc, and the column was eluted with the sulfated peptide LD(sY)DF (4 mm) in 100 mm NH4OAc at 30 μl/min. Flow-through and elution fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE, followed by PSG2 Western blotting or silver staining. Sperm/epididymal proteins eluted from the PSG2 column were concentrated and electrophoresed on 4-15% Tris-HCl/SDS-polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions, and separated proteins were visualized by colloidal Coomassie Blue staining. Gels were washed with H2O, and bands were excised, washed again with H2O and then with 60% acetonitrile in H2O, and dried in a SpeedVac. The gel pieces were reduced in 10 mm dithiothreitol in 50 mm NH4HCO3 for 1 h at 56 °C and alkylated in 55 mm iodoacetamide in 50 mm NH4HCO3 for 45 min at 22 °C in the dark. After washing with 50 mm NH4HCO3, the gel pieces were dehydrated with 60% acetonitrile in H2O and dried. Gel pieces were re-swollen with trypsin in 50 mm NH4HCO3 and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were eluted from the gel slices by repeated extraction (three times, 60 min) with 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O. Eluates were pooled, dried down, and redissolved in 2% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid prior to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Nano-LC-MS/MS experiments were performed on a Thermo Electron LTQ FT hybrid linear ion trap/7-tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer equipped with a Thermo Electron nanospray ion source, Surveyor MS pump, and microautosampler. The tryptic peptide mixture was separated on a PicoFrit column (12 cm, inner diameter, × 50 μm) packed with C18 reversed-phase resin (Magic C18AQ, 100-Å pore size, 3-μm particle size, Michrom Bioresources, Inc.). The column was equilibrated before sample injection for 10 min at 2% solvent B (0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile) and 98% solvent A (0.1% (v/v) formic acid in H2O) at a flow rate of 140 nl/min. The column was developed with a linear gradient of 2-50% solvent B over 30 min at a flow rate of 320 nl/min. The LTQ FT mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent acquisition mode using the TOP10 method: a full-scan mass spectrum acquired in the FTICR mass spectrometer, followed by 10 MS/MS experiments performed with the LTQ FT mass spectrometer on the 10 most abundant ions detected in the full-scan mass spectrum. All tandem mass spectra from each LC-MS run were searched against the NCBI Protein Database using the Mascot search engine. Searches were performed with tryptic specificity allowing four missed cleavages and a tolerance on the mass measurement of 10 ppm in MS mode and 0.5 Da for MS/MS ions.

https://openalex.org/W1980353756,"It is well established that ligand-gated chloride flux across the plasma membrane modulates neuronal excitability. We find that a voltage-dependent Cl− conductance increases neuronal excitability in immature rodents as well, enhancing the time course of NMDA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials (mEPSPs). This Cl− conductance is activated by CaMKII, is electrophysiologically identical to the CaMKII-activated CLC-3 conductance in nonneuronal cells, and is absent in clc-3−/− mice. Systematically decreasing [Cl−]i to mimic postnatal [Cl−]i regulation progressively decreases the amplitude and decay time constant of spontaneous mEPSPs. This Cl−-dependent change in synaptic strength is absent in clc-3−/− mice. Using surface biotinylation, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and coimmunoprecipitation studies, we find that CLC-3 channels are localized on the plasma membrane, at postsynaptic sites, and in association with NMDA receptors. This is the first demonstration that a voltage-dependent chloride conductance modulates neuronal excitability. By increasing postsynaptic potentials in a Cl− dependent fashion, CLC-3 channels regulate neuronal excitability postsynaptically in immature neurons."

When a stimulus pattern is presented to the system, the network dynamics are drawn toward the attractor that corresponds to the memory associated with that stimulus. The formation of the attractor landscape is achieved by overlapping patterns of synaptic modifications adhering to the Hebbian paradigm (Hebb, 1949Hebb D.O. The Organization of Behavior: A Neuropsychological Theory. Wiley, New York1949Google Scholar) such that each synapse is involved in the storage of multiple related memories. Inevitably, this common synaptic representation implies interactions, or associations, between memories stored in the same network. Attractor dynamics is commonly believed to underlie the persistent activity observed in the neocortex during working memory experiments (Fuster and Alexander, 1971Fuster J.M. Alexander G.

It was also suggested that the hippocampal region CA3 could be an anatomical substrate where attractor neural networks (ANN) reside (Treves and Rolls, 1994Treves A. Rolls E.T. Computational analysis of the role of the hippocampus in memory.Hippocampus. 1994; 4: 374-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Several models of place-specific activity in hippocampus based on ANNs were proposed in the literature (e.g., Tsodyks and Sejnowski, 1995Tsodyks M. Sejnowski T.

A new evidence for attractor dynamics emerged in a recent study by Wills et al., 2005Wills T.J. Lever C. Cacucci F. Burgess N. O'Keefe J. Attractor dynamics in the hippocampal representation of the local environment.Science. 2005; 308: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar where activity of hippocampal place cells was recorded while rats explored a set of environments of different shapes. Initially, when the rats explored a circle- and a square-shaped environment, the similarity between the representations of these two environments by the population activity of hippocampal cells (i.e., the place fields for all the cells that were active in these environments) was low. Later, the rats explored a set of environments of intermediate shapes between the circle and the square. Surprisingly, no gradual change in the representations was observed; instead, most cells abruptly changed their place fields at the same intermediate shape (see Figure 1A). Wills et al., 2005Wills T.J. Lever C. Cacucci F. Burgess N. O'Keefe J.

Progressive transformation of hippocampal neuronal representations in ""morphed"" environments.Neuron. 2005; 48: 345-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, in which similar experiments yielded very different results. Instead of observing two distinct place-dependent activity patterns, Leutgeb et al., 2005Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Treves A. Meyer R. Barnes C.A. McNaughton B.L. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Progressive transformation of hippocampal neuronal representations in ""morphed"" environments.Neuron. 2005; 48: 345-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar reported that the similarity between representations of the subsequent environments in the sequence gradually decreased (see Figure 1B), with different cells changing their place field properties at different paces. It was also observed that the resulting representations were significantly skewed toward the first shape in the sequence, such that the overlap between the circular and square representations was increased significantly compared to the pretraining phase, indicating their partial merging (Figure 1B). An important difference between the ways the experiments were performed in these two studies concerned the order in which the animals explored the morphed environments. While in the Leutgeb et al., 2005Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Treves A. Meyer R. Barnes C.A. McNaughton B.L. Moser M.B. Moser E.I.

Attractor dynamics in the hippocampal representation of the local environment.Science. 2005; 308: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, a scrambled-order exploration was performed. Taken together, these two studies indicate that place representations can be modified due to exposure to morphed environments, and that the changes in representation are contingent upon a particular order of exposure. Our recent psychophysical study (Preminger et al., 2005Preminger S. Sagi D. Tsodyks M. Morphing visual memories through gradual associations.Perception. 2005; 34: 14Google Scholar; S.P., D.S., and M.T., unpublished data) indicates that similar processes can occur in a very different system and can have a direct and dramatic effect on behavior. In this experiment subjects repeated an identification task on a sequence of morphed faces, gradually transforming from one prelearned face (“source”) to another initially distinguishable face (“target,” see Figures 2A and 2B). This resulted, under certain conditions, in partial merging: an increasing fraction of the morph faces were identified as the source face (Figure 2C). Importantly, this effect only occurred when the faces were presented to subjects in a gradual order, albeit interrupted by numerous other familiar and unfamiliar faces. Presentation of the same sequence of images in a random order yielded no significant change in identification (Figure 2C), again indicating the important role of learning order. In the current contribution, we show that ANN models allow memory representations of correlated stimuli that depend on learning order. To this end, we introduce a network that stores incoming patterns via novelty-facilitated modifications of synaptic connections. When a quasicontinuous set of patterns (morph sequence) is stored in the network, the resulting attractor representations strongly depend on the order of exposure. In particular, we show that when morph patterns are presented in a gradually increasing order, the network exhibits a stronger tendency for merged representations compared with random order. These results provide a unified theoretical explanation for the experimental observations described above and provide a general framework for studying the effects of context on memory representation. Throughout the analysis, we use the Hopfield network (Hopfield, 1982Hopfield J.J. Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1982; 79: 2554-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (11057) Google Scholar) as our modeling framework for studying attractor dynamics of long-term memory. We describe the neurons in the network with binary variables, Si(t) (+1 if the i-th neuron is active at time t, and −1 otherwise). At every time step, the state of each neuron is updated according to the total synaptic input it receives from the rest of the network via synaptic connections with the strengths Jij (for a connection from neuron number j to neuron number i):Si(t+1)=sign(∑j=1NJijSj(t))(1) where sign(·) is the sign function sign(x) = 1 if x > 0, sign(x) = −1 if x < 0. We assume that stimuli to be stored in memory are encoded as network activity patterns, also binary, denoted as ξiμ (μ being the index of the corresponding pattern). In the original Hopfield model, the patterns are stored (or learned) by adding Hebb-like terms to the strength of each synapse such that when all of the patterns are learned, the connections acquire the following values:Jij=1N∑μξiμξjμ(2) The memories are retrieved by providing an initializing input and then allowing the network to evolve autonomously by updating the neuron's activity states according to Equation 1, until they converge to one of the stable states, or attractors. Indeed, it was shown in earlier work that all the memories stored in the network can be reliably retrieved provided that the patterns representing them are uncorrelated and that the total number of patterns is smaller than the critical capacity (Hopfield, 1982Hopfield J.J. Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1982; 79: 2554-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (11057) Google Scholar, Amit et al., 1985bAmit D.J. Gutfreund H. Sompolinsky H. Storing infinite number of patterns in a spin glass model for neural networks.Phys. Rev. Lett. 1985; 55: 1530-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). We will use the Hopfield formulation and its extension (described below) to store a sequence of gradually changing patterns that mimics the set of morph stimuli used in the experiments described above. We will consider a set of binary patterns, ξμ, with the index μ now representing the position of the pattern in the morph sequence (0 ≤ μ ≤ 1, see Figure 3). The sequence is constructed by first choosing the source (ξ0) and the target (ξ1) patterns randomly, such that for approximately half of the neurons, the source and the target states match each other (ξi0=ξi1), and for the other half of the neurons, the source and target do not match (ξi0=−ξi1). At every step of morphing, we gradually update the state of a fixed number of randomly chosen neurons, for which there is a remaining mismatch between the previous state and the target one, such that the target pattern is obtained at the end. The standard analysis identifying the entire set of stored patterns with attractors of the dynamics crucially depends on the assumption that the patterns are uncorrelated, i.e.:1N∑iξiμξiν≈0for every μ ≠ ν, such that interference between different patterns during the memory retrieval is minimal. However, for the morph sequence construction described above, the correlation between a pair of patterns (ξμ and ξν) decreases gradually from 1 to 0 as the distance between them increases:1N∑iξiμξiν=1−|μ−ν| This results in a much stronger interference between the patterns, and it consequently results in very different behavior of the network when stored memories are being retrieved (see Experimental Procedures A for the mathematical solution of the model). If we limit ourselves to the initial states of the network that are positively correlated with the morph patterns, our analysis shows that after one step of the dynamics (we consider parallel dynamics in which all of the neurons are updated simultaneously), the network activity states pass exclusively through the morph sequence. The entire dynamics can therefore be described as a sequence of morph patterns, with indices μ0, μ1, μ2…. Eventually the dynamics converge to a stable steady state, ξμ∗, which is an attractor of the network. As shown in Experimental Procedures A, in the limit of a large number of patterns, the index μ∗ can be found by solving the following equation:∫0μ∗dν(1−|ν−μ∗|)=∫μ∗1dν(1−|ν−μ∗|)(3) Since the expression under the integral is the correlation of the attractor (μ∗) with other patterns (ν), this condition arises from the requirement that opposing interferences from both sides of the attractor balance out to produce an equilibrium state. It is thus clear that the only solution of this equation is μ∗ = 0.5. We conclude that a Hopfield network that stores a sequence of morph patterns possesses a single attractor state that coincides with the middle point in the sequence, ξ0.5. This analysis illustrates the emergence of a single attractor representation of an entire sequence of correlated patterns that are stored in a Hopfield network via the standard Hebb-like connectivity rule. The experimental results described in the introduction (Leutgeb et al., 2005Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Treves A. Meyer R. Barnes C.A. McNaughton B.L. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Progressive transformation of hippocampal neuronal representations in ""morphed"" environments.Neuron. 2005; 48: 345-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, and Wills et al., 2005Wills T.J. Lever C. Cacucci F. Burgess N. O'Keefe J. Attractor dynamics in the hippocampal representation of the local environment.Science. 2005; 308: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, Preminger et al., 2005Preminger S. Sagi D. Tsodyks M. Morphing visual memories through gradual associations.Perception. 2005; 34: 14Google Scholar) indicate that the attractor representation depends on the training protocol. The Hopfield model, however, cannot account for this effect, since it predicts that morph patterns invariably merge into one attractor representation. We therefore introduce an extended model where patterns are stored into the network with variable weights:Jij=1N∑μwμξiμξjμ(4) In this formulation, the Hebb-like terms ξiμξjμ, which encode the memorized patterns, are modulated by corresponding weights wμ. The idea behind this approach is that depending on the way the patterns are presented for learning (temporal order, frequency of presentation, temporal proximity, presence of intervening patterns, etc.), they may acquire different “saliencies” that are captured by the weights wμ in Equation 4. Before delving into the learning process during which the weights are acquired, we first address the issue of how a given distribution of weights can give rise to multiple attractor states. Similarly to the Hopfield model, the dynamics of network states pass exclusively through patterns of the morph sequence. The condition for the fixed point value of the index μ∗, which generalizes Equation 3, is now:∫0μ∗dνwν(1−|ν−μ∗|)=∫μ∗1dνwν(1−|ν−μ∗|)(5) which again expresses the balance of interferences between the attractor and other patterns. Depending on the particular distribution of the weights, this equation may have more than one solution. The attractor states of the network correspond to those solutions that are stable, i.e., the ones to which the network converges via its intrinsic dynamics (Equation 1). For some specific choices of weight distributions, Equation 5 can be solved explicitly and the exact attractor landscape can be obtained. For the uniform weight distribution (wμ ≡ w for all μ), Equation 5 reduces to Equation 3, with a single solution (μ∗ = 0.5). If however the weights are biased toward the source and the target of the morph sequence (μ = 0 and μ = 1, respectively), the network can acquire two attractors. For instance, if wμ = (μ − 0.5)2, then there are three solutions to Equation 5: two stable ones (attractors) with μ∗ = 0.5 − 1/8 and μ∗ = 0.5 + 1/8, and an unstable one with μ∗ = 0.5. The first attractor represents the first half of the morph sequence (patterns with μ < 0.5), with the second attractor representing the remaining half. This result demonstrates that different distributions of saliency weights induce different attractor landscapes. In order to relate the above analysis to the experimental results on history-dependent memory representations, we propose a particular learning process that demonstrates how saliency weights can be acquired throughout learning. Clearly, a required learning mechanism must depend not only on the current input but also on previous experience. Previous experience can in turn be encoded by the attractor landscape itself at the time of the new exposure. We suggest that this dependency can be captured by saliency weights assigned to different patterns presented for learning (see Equation 4). In particular, we propose that the changes in the weights are determined by the perceived “novelty” of the presented pattern. Intuitively, we think of the pattern's novelty as being a measure of its similarity to an existing attractor, i.e., the pattern is perceived as “novel” if the network does not already possess a similar attractor state, and “not novel,” or “familiar,” if it is similar to an already existing attractor. Mathematically, one could use the number of mismatches between the presented pattern and the attractor state to which it converges (called the Hamming distance) as a novelty signal. Alternatively, one can use the Hamming distance between the presented pattern and the one obtained after one step of iteration (both rules result in very similar behaviors). The second choice seems to be more biologically realistic, as it does not require the initial state of the network to be remembered until it converges to an attractor. We therefore define the change in the synaptic connection between neurons i and j, after the presentation of a pattern μ, to be proportional to a local Hebb-like term, ξiμξjμ, modulated by the global novelty signal defined above. Importantly, the novelty signal is the same for all the connections in the network. This synaptic modification rule is equivalent to the following update of the saliency weight, wμ, corresponding to the currently presented pattern (see Equation 4):wμ→wμ+ηH(6) where H is the Hamming distance between ξμ, the pattern presented for learning, and the state of the network after one step of the dynamics. η is a positive constant that defines the speed of learning. With this learning algorithm, we can simulate the effect of an arbitrary learning protocol on the formation of the attractor states of the network. One can already see from this formulation that the novelty-based learning acts to counterbalance the merging of morph patterns into a single representation. Indeed, if we consider the case where patterns are stored in the network with uniform saliency weights, then, as demonstrated above, the network possesses a single attractor at the middle of the morph sequence. If the network is subsequently exposed to the same sequence, the novelty factor will be higher for the patterns that are farther away from the attractor, so that the weights will become more biased toward the ends of the sequence. As we saw above, this bias may split the attractor in two. In fact, we expect that repeated exposure to the morph patterns will eventually result in a formation of multiple attractor states covering the morph sequence. The experimental results have demonstrated that depending on the protocol, representations of morph patterns can either “converge” toward each other or keep a categorical distinction between patterns. Here we show how these findings can be captured by the extended Hopfield model combined with the novelty-dependent learning mechanism. To this end, we examine the performance of our model by implementing learning protocols similar to the ones used in the above mentioned studies of hippocampal spatial representations (Leutgeb et al., 2005Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Treves A. Meyer R. Barnes C.A. McNaughton B.L. Moser M.B. Moser E.I.

Lever C. Cacucci F. Burgess N. O'Keefe J. Attractor dynamics in the hippocampal representation of the local environment.Science. 2005; 308: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Specifically, we simulate the learning of morph sequence patterns in our attractor network model with novelty-based learning by presenting morphed patterns according to one of two protocols: gradual protocol, where the morph sequence is presented in a gradually increasing index order, or mixed protocol, where the morph patterns are presented in a randomly ordered sequence. The simulation results are shown in Figure 4. At the beginning of the learning procedure, two random uncorrelated patterns (source and target, corresponding to circle- and square-shaped environments) were stored in the network with equal initial weights, to represent the prelearned circle and square environments. Next, the morphed patterns were presented according to the gradual or mixed protocols. Learning was performed after presentation of each pattern, based on Equation 6. As seen in Figure 4A, after one learning session of the gradual protocol, where each of the morph patterns was presented once, the representation of the last morph pattern exhibited a marked positive correlation with the representation of the first pattern, similarly to the experimental findings of Leutgeb et al., 2005Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Treves A. Meyer R. Barnes C.A. McNaughton B.L. Moser M.B. Moser E.I.

On the other hand, a simulation of the mixed protocol produced a categorically-shaped representation where groups of patterns on both edges of the sequence were merged into a single attractor and attractors of the first and last patterns were the same as before the training, corresponding to the findings of Wills et al., 2005Wills T.J.

To investigate the behavior of the learning rule with repetition of the learning, we continued to simulate the protocols, repeating the gradual or mixed presentation correspondingly for multiple sessions. We observed that for both protocols, as the presentation of the patterns was repeated, each pattern was more likely to be drawn to itself, although in different paces, and the correlation between the representations of the source and target decreased (Figures 4B and 4C). This is similar to the findings of Leutgeb et al., 2005Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Treves A. Meyer R. Barnes C.A. McNaughton B.L. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Progressive transformation of hippocampal neuronal representations in ""morphed"" environments.Neuron. 2005; 48: 345-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, who observed a decrease in correlation between the representations of the two end shapes after multiple repetitions of the gradual protocol. The simulations presented above indicate that gradual-order presentation of correlated patterns results in stronger merging effects than random-order exposure to the same patterns. This conclusion is in broad agreement with the experimental observations on hippocampal place representation and face recognition. In the next two sections we present a more rigorous analysis in order to ascertain that the difference between gradual-order and random-order exposure is a general feature of the model and does not depend on the fine details of the learning procedures. In order to understand the dynamics of representations throughout the learning process, we need to establish a theory that allows an estimation of the number of attractors and their locations for a general-form distribution of the saliency weights, wμ. A central notion in our analysis is the energy function (Hopfield, 1982Hopfield J.J. Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1982; 79: 2554-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (11057) Google Scholar) that depends on the position of the current activity state of the network on the morph sequence μ (see Experimental Procedures B):E(μ)=−12∫01dνwν(1−|μ−ν|)2(7) Importantly, when the network state evolves in time according to the update equations (Equation 1), the energy function cannot increase, so in order to determine the position of attractors, one should only find its local minima. This is illustrated in Figures 5A and 5B where we show the familiar example with constant weights (wμ ≡ 1). The energy function has a single local minimum at μ = 0.5, as expected from our earlier analysis (see Equation 3). The next example, in Figure 5C, represents a class of weight functions in which the two edges of the morph sequence are accentuated. The energy function (Figure 5D) shows two local minima corresponding to two attractor states, which could represent the experimental results of Wills et al., 2005Wills T.J. Lever C. Cacucci F. Burgess N. O'Keefe J. Attractor dynamics in the hippocampal representation of the local environment.Science. 2005; 308: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar (see Figure 4A). The analysis of the energy function allows us to relate the structure of the attractor landscape to the"

Suppression of endogenous MST3 by small interference RNA enhanced cellular migration in MCF-7 cells with reduced expression of E-cadherin at the edge of migrating cells. The alteration of cellular migration and protruding can be rescued by RNA interference-resistant MST3. The expression of surface integrin and Golgi apparatus was not altered, but phosphorylation on tyrosine 118 and tyrosine 31 of paxillin was attenuated by MST3 small interfering RNA (siRNA). Threonine 178 was determined to be one of the two main autophosphorylation sites of MST3 in vitro. Mutant T178A MST3, containing alanine instead of threonine at codon 178, lost autophosphorylation and kinase activities. Overexpression of wild type MST3, but not the T178A mutant MST3, inhibited migration and spreading in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. MST3 could phosphorylate the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-PEST and inhibit the tyrosine phosphatase activity of PTP-PEST. We conclude that MST3 inhibits cell migration in a fashion dependent on autophosphorylation and may regulate paxillin phosphorylation through tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST.

The group of Ste20 kinases is related to yeast sterile 20 proteins, which are a component of the pheromone-response pathway in budding yeast (1Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Ste20 belongs to the STE group, which is among the newest groups added in the new classification of protein kinases (2Hanks S.K. Hunter T.

The mammalian Ste20 family consists of two structurally distinct subfamilies, including P21-activated kinases (PAK) and germinal center kinases (GCK). PAK regulates several critical signal pathways through the interaction with many proteins, including Rho GTPase (4Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 5Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation plays an important role in the activation of PAK (6Zhan Q. Ge Q. Ohira T. Van Dyke T. Badwey J.A. J.

MST1 and MST2 undergo autophosphorylation and are activated by a variety of stress stimuli (9Praskova M. Khoklatchev A. Ortiz-Vega S. Avruch J. Biochem.

Lee W.S. Lai M.D. Lu T.J. Huang C.L. Leu T.H. Shih H.M. Fang H.I. Robinson D.R. Kung H.J. Yuan C.J. J. Biol.

Huang C.Y. Chang C.H. Yuan C.J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). One unique feature of MST3 is the preference for Mn2+ as the cofactor in the kinase reaction, an unusual feature for a serine/threonine kinase (19Schinkmann K. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28695-28703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recently, we have further demonstrated that Zn2+ is also a cofactor for MST3 (22Lu T.J. Huang C.Y. Yuan C.J. Lee Y.C. Leu T.H. Chang W.C. Lu T.L. Jeng W.Y. Lai M.D. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 1306-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Cell migration is an important process that is essential for development and life long physiological processes (23Horwitz R. Webb D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R756-R759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 24Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3773) Google Scholar). Migration can be viewed as a cyclical process. First, cells begin to polarize and make protrusions in response to outside stimuli. Second, cells form adhesions that attach the protrusion to the substratum. Third, these adhesions partially act as tracking points for migration. Finally, contraction moves the cell body forward and releases the attachment through disassembly of the adhesion at the rear end, allowing the cycle to begin again.Several types of adhesion occur in different cell types on various substrata. One type of adhesion involves integrin, a heterodimeric receptor consisting of α and β chains. Binding of ligand changes the interaction between the α and β chain cytoplasmic domains and integrin clustering (25Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Activated integrins preferentially localize to the site of new adhesion and establish interactions with several proteins, including focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, p130 Crk-associated protein (p130 CAS), and others (26Goldfinger L.E. Han J. Kiosses W.B. Howe A.K. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Nishiya N. Kiosses W.B. Han J. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Paxillin is usually recruited to the leading edges of migrating cells, where it acts as a scaffold for protein interactions (29Turner C.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E231-E236Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), and paxillin is essential for protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-PEST inhibition of cell spreading and membrane protrusion (30Jamieson J.S. Tumbarello D.A. Halle M. Brown M.C. Tremblay M.L. Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5835-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation on Tyr-31/118 is observed during cell migration and adhesion (31Nakamura K. Yano H. Uchida H. Hashimoto S. Schaefer E. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27155-27164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Chen H.Y. Shen C.H. Tsai Y.T. Lin F.C. Huang Y.P. Chen R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10558-10572Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Replacement of Tyr-31/118 with phenylalanine reduces cell motility with reduced Crk-II association (33Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Valles A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), whereas coexpression of the Crk-II adaptor protein and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B promotes cell migration accompanying decreased tyrosine phosphorylation on paxillin (34Takino T. Tamura M. Miyamori H. Araki M. Matsumoto K. Sato H. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3145-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although paxillin is postulated as being a positive regular of cell migration (35Hagel M. George E.L. Kim A. Tamimi R. Opitz S.L. Turner C.E. Imamoto A. Thomas S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 901-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), small interference RNA (siRNA) directed against paxillin can enhance cell migration at certain circumstances (36Yano H. Mazaki Y. Kurokawa K. Hanks S.K. Matsuda M. Sabe H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 37Schaller M.D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 157-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).In contrast to other members of the MST family, the biological functions of MST3 are less understood. RNA interference (RNAi) technology has become a powerful tool for studying protein function (38Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11577) Google Scholar, 40Wu M.T. Wu R.H. Hung C.F. Cheng T.L. Tsai W.H. Chang W.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); therefore, we investigated the altered phenotype generated by silencing the expression of MST3 with RNAi. Our results indicate that autophosphorylated MST3 inhibits cellular migration associated with alteration of paxillin phosphorylation. In addition, MST3 can phosphorylate PTP-PEST and inhibit its phosphatase activity, which may account for the change of paxillin phosphorylation.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Antibodies—MCF-7 and MDCK cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in defined minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (DMEM/FCS). MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in Leibowitz's L15 medium, supplemented with 14 mm NaHCO3 and 10% fetal calf serum. MCF-10A cells were kindly provided by Dr. Mien-Chie Hung and cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 5% equine serum, 0.5 μg/ml Fungizone, 10 μg/ml insulin, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone. Antibodies utilized were anti-GM130 Ab (610822; BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-paxillin (610052; BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-cadherin antibody (610920; BD Transduction Laboratories), Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (A-11001; Molecular Probes, Inc., Carlsbad, CA), anti-paxillin-PY118 Ab (44-720G; BIOSOURCE), and anti-paxillin-PY31 (44-722G; BIOSOURCE). Anti-MST3 antiserum was prepared as described before (20Huang C.Y. Wu Y.M. Hsu C.Y. Lee W.S. Lai M.D. Lu T.J. Huang C.L. Leu T.H. Shih H.M. Fang H.I. Robinson D.R. Kung H.J. Yuan C.J. J. Biol.

Cheng T.L. Tsai W.H. Chang W.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 41Cheng T.L. Chang W.W. Su I.J. Lai M.D. Huang W. Lei H.Y. Chang W.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 336: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The target sequence of MST3 was 5′-GGAGAAGAGCCAGGCGTGC-3′ (nucleotides 1127–1145 of MST3 from the start codon). Cells were cotransfected with the pHsU6 vectors containing shRNA of targeting sequences and pCMV-neo by using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). The stable transfectants were selected with G418. To monitor the efficacy of MST3-RNAi, the expression of MST3 in MCF7 stable transfectants was analyzed by Western blotting and probed with anti-MST3 antiserum.MST3 Mutant Plasmids—Wild type HA-MST3 and the indicated mutants were constructed between NotI and EcoRI sites in pcDNA3.0 with HA epitope tags added to the N terminus. PCR-directed mutagenesis was used to achieve the desired mutations. The primers for MST3 T178A were as follows: forward primer, 5′-CAAAAGGGCCTTCTTCGTGGGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCCCACGAAGAAGGCCCTTTTG-3′. The primers for MST3 T264A were as follows: forward primer; 5′-CTTTAGACCCGCTGCTAAGGAGTT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AACTCCTTAGCAGCGGGTCTAAAG-3′. The underlined base pairs represent the mutated amino acids. The sequence altered in RNAi-resistant MST3 is GGAGAAAAGCCAAGCTTGC (nucleotides 1127–1145) without altering the amino acid sequence. All mutant MST3 plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Wound-healing Assays—Cells were plated onto glass-based dishes coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (FN) at a saturation density (1.2 × 106 cells/35-mm diameter). Cells were then scratched manually with a blade 24 h after plating. The wounded regions were allowed to heal for a defined time in DMEM/FCS. Images for these cells were observed by phase-contrast microscopy using a CKII microscope (Olympus, Japan).Migration Assays—Cells were cultured to confluence in DMEM/FCS. The lower compartment of a Boyden chamber was filled with 1 μg/ml FN (26 μl/well), and 5 × 105/ml cells in serum-free medium were added to the upper compartment of the chamber (50 μl/well). The chambers were separated by a polycarbonate filter (25 × 80 mm, 8 μm pore size, polyvinylidene difluoride; GE Osmonics, Trevose, PA). The cells were allowed to migrate for a defined time at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Nonmigrated cells remaining on the upper surface of the filter were removed mechanically by scraping with a cotton swab. Cells that had migrated through the pores were fixed in methanol for 8 min and then stained with 10% Giemsa stain-modified solution (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). Cells were examined and counted with U-5RE-2 microscope (Olympus, Japan).Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assay—Cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed using 300 μl of lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4·2H2O, 6 mm deoxycholate, 1% Igepal-Ca-630 (Sigma), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% aprotinin (Sigma), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After a 15-min centrifugation at 8000 rpm, supernatant containing 300 μg of total proteins was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of anti-HA Ab (Roche Applied Science). The immunocomplex was harvested with 35 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer three times and 1× Tris-buffered saline three times and then suspended in 30 μl of 1× Tris-buffered saline buffer. The HA-MST3-immunoprecipitate bound to protein A-Sepharose was incubated with 30 μl of 2× kinase buffer containing 40 mm PIPES, 20 μm cold ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (2500 Ci per mmol), 4 μg of histone H3, or myelin basic protein (MBP) and 2 mm Mn2+ or Mg2+ at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 6 μl of 10× SDS loading buffer. After boiling for 5 min, proteins in the kinase reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried, and substrate phosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography.In Vitro Kinase Assay with Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase—0.5 μg of recombinant MST3 was incubated with 1 μgof recombinant PTP1B (amino acids 1–321) enzyme (Exalpha Biologicals), 0.5 μg of myelin basic protein, or 0.5 μg of recombinant PTP-PEST (amino acids 2–300) enzyme (Exalpha Biologicals) in kinase buffer described as above. Kinase reactions were performed at room temperature for 15 min and stopped by the addition of 6 μl of 10× SDS loading buffer.MST3 Substrate Peptide Assay—The sequences of peptide 178, 264, G peptide, and 178A are (respectively) TQIKRNTFVGTPFWMAPEVIKQS (residues 172–194 of MST3), KEPSFRPTAKELLKHKFI (residues 257–274 of MST3), KPGFSPQPSRRGSESSEEVYV, and TQIKRNAFVGTPFWMAPEVIKQS. The sequence of peptide NDR is YKNKDWVFINYTYKRFEGLTAR (residues 433–454 of NDR kinase). Peptide 264 was predicted to be the potential auto-phosphorylation residue of MST3. One mm of peptide 178, peptide 264, NDR peptide, G peptide, or whole MBP protein was reacted with 1 μm baculovirus-expressed MST3 or immunoprecipitated MST3 with 2 mm Mn2+ and [33P]ATP. The amount of 33P incorporated into a given amount of synthetic peptide was quantified by spotting the phosphorylated peptide on P81 paper and counting the radioactivity in a Cerenkov counter. Kinetic parameters were determined by varying the concentration of peptide from 0.4 to 2.4 mm while maintaining the ATP concentration at 10 μm.Phosphopeptide Analysis—MST3 (178) peptide (25 μg), His-tagged recombinant MST3 (1 μm), or both were incubated in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1 pmol of ATP = 1000 cpm), 20 mm Mg2+ at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 4× Laemmli sample buffer, and the reaction products were resolved in 16.5% SDS-PAGE. The bands of 32P-labeled T178 peptide and of 32P-autophosphorylated MST3 were excised and digested by 10 μg of trypsin at 37 °C for 48 h. The resulting tryptic phosphopeptides from 32P-labeled T178 peptide (∼3,000 cpm), 32P-autophosphorylated MST3 (∼3,000 cpm), or both 32P-labeled MST3 (178) peptide (∼1,500 cpm) and 32P-autophosphorylated MST3 (∼1,500 cpm) were subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide map analysis as described before (42Yang S.D. Yu J.S. Shiah S.G. Huang J.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1416-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed in the first dimension on cellulose-coated TLC plates (Merck) in a solution (formic acid/acetic acid/water, 50:156:1794 by volume) at 1 kV for 40 min followed by ascending chromatography in the second dimension in a solution (butanol-1/pyridine/acetic acid/water, 15:10:3:12 by volume) for 6–8 h. The air-dried plates were exposed to x-ray films for autoradiography.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were plated on 10 μg/ml fibronectin-coated glass-based dish. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The permeabilized cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with anti-GM130, anti-paxillin, and anti-cadherin antibody. Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG was used to visualize proteins. Images for these proteins were obtained by fluorescent microscopy (NIKON 80I fluorescence microscope, Japan) or confocal microscopy (LSM510 Pascal, Carl Zeiss, Germany).Cell Sorting with Flow Cytometry—Cells were cotransfected with the indicated plasmids and pEGFP-N1 plasmid (Clontech) by Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were mechanically dissociated to obtain a single cell suspension in a solution containing 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (1500 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C), filtered through a 0.35-μm filter (Falcon), and kept on ice until FACS analysis. Cell sorting was performed on a FACSAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with 488-nm argon and 633-nm He-Ne lasers. The green fluorescent protein-expressing cells were seeded on a FN-coated dish to observe cell protrusion or sorted for analysis with Boyden chamber migration assay.Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase Activity—PTP-PEST activity was measured by using 6,8-difluoro 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were lysed on ice with 0.5% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C and 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with PTP-PEST antibody (AG10, Cell Signaling). The immunoprecipitated PEST was added to the substrate-coated assay wells. Samples were incubated for 1 h, and phosphatase activity was determined by using a fluorimeter at an excitation/emission wavelength of 358/452 nm. The PTP-PEST plasmid was purchased from OriGene Technologies Inc.Statistical Analysis—All the statistical analyses were performed with Student's paired t test.RESULTSEstablishment of MST3-RNAi Transfectants—To investigate the biological function of MST3, we constructed U6 promoter plasmid-based shRNA targeting at nucleotides 875, 1127, and 1170 on the MST3 gene. The efficacy of the three shRNA-MST3 constructs was determined by cotransfection of the shRNA and HA-MST3 expression plasmids into COS-1 cells. The shRNA targeting at nucleotide 1170 had no effect, whereas the shRNA targeting nucleotide 1127 was the best among the three, inhibiting more than 90% of HA-MST3 expression (data not shown). The MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was cotransfected with the plasmid expressing shRNA against MST3 and a neomycin marker. Two stable clones (RNAi-1 and RNAi-2) were established by selection with G418. The other two stable clones (vector-1 and vector-2) had no shRNA integration. The expression of endogenous MST3 of RNAi-1 or RNAi-2 cells was less than 20% of control transfectants or MCF-7 parental cells (Fig. 1A). The growth rates of MST3-RNAi transfectants were similar to that of parental cells and control transfectants (data not shown).Down-regulation of MST3 Enhanced Cell Migration—Because YSK1, a member of MST family, played a role in cellular migration (14Preisinger C. Short B. De Corte V. Bruyneel E. Haas A. Kopajtich R. Gettemans J. Barr F.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 1009-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), we further examined whether MST3 affected cellular migration. A wound-healing assay was performed to monitor cell migration. Cell migration toward the wound was recorded at 24 and 72 h after scratching. MST3 RNAi transfectants migrated faster than control transfectants (Fig. 1B). Decreased expression of E-cadherin and loss of cellular contacts is usually observed at the migrating cell edge in collective cell migration (36Yano H. Mazaki Y. Kurokawa K. Hanks S.K. Matsuda M. Sabe H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The expression of E-cadherin was much lower in the leading cell edges of MST3 RNAi transfectants (Fig. 1C, lower panel). Conversely, the expression of E-cadherin in the center of the cell mass was not significantly altered between MST3 RNAi and control transfectants (Fig. 1C, upper panel).In addition to the wound-healing assay for measuring collective cell migration (36Yano H. Mazaki Y. Kurokawa K. Hanks S.K. Matsuda M. Sabe H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), Boyden chamber assay was used to assess the cell migration without cell-cell interaction (Fig. 1D). Both RNAi transfectants displayed a significant enhancement of cell migration than control transfectants.Effect of Down-regulation of MST3 on Paxillin Phosphorylation and Cellular Protruding—The expression of integrins α3 and β1 was not altered by the expression of MST3 siRNA (data not shown). Antibody to activated integrin (conformation-specific antibody for β44) did not produce a significant difference upon flow cytometric analysis (data not shown). In contrast, decreased phosphorylation on residue 118 on paxillin was evident on MST3 RNAi transfectants at 24 or 48 h after plating (Fig. 2, A and B). A minor decrease of phosphorylation of Tyr-31 on paxillin was observed in MST3 RNAi transfectants. To assess if the altered paxillin phosphorylation was associated with change of distribution for MST3 RNAi transfectants, cells were plated for 24 h, and the localization of paxillin was determined using an immunofluorescence analysis. Paxillin formed speckles on one edge of the MST3 RNAi transfectants (Fig. 2C). However, the distribution of paxillin in RNAi transfectants was not altered in the spread cells. The RNAi transfectants spread faster than the control transfectants, and the percentage of protruded cells was determined in triplicate experiments (Fig. 2D). Because YSK1 might affect Golgi distribution, we examined the GM130 distribution in RNAi transfectants. The GM130 distribution was not altered in the transfectants (data not shown).FIGURE 2Down-regulation of MST3 regulates paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation and cell protrusion. A, one representative Western blot is shown for the expression of paxillin and for tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. Cell lysates were obtained 24 and 48 h after plating the cells on fibronectin (FN)-coated glass-based dishes. B, the Tyr-31 and Tyr-118 phosphorylation of paxillin was quantitated with densitometry in three independent experiments. The relative fold over the MCF-7 parental cells was plotted. C, paxillin distribution. Twenty four hours after plating, paxillin distribution was detected by staining with anti-paxillin antibody. D, quantification of the percentage of spread cells. Cell protruding was determined 24 h after plating. One hundred cells in randomly chosen fields were selected, and the length of individual cell larger 50 μm was defined as spread cell. * represents p < 0.05; ** represents p < 0.01, and *** represents p < 0.001 between RNAi and control vector clones.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Enhancement of Cell Migration and Protruding Can Be Rescued by RNAi-resistant MST3—To further examine the specificity of MST3 siRNA, we performed the rescue assay with RNAi-resistant HA-MST3 (Rnai-R-HA-MST3). Three nucleotides of wild type MST3 were mutated to create resistance to shRNA-MST3 siRNA, and the encoding protein was not altered. The shRNA-MST3 could only weakly degrade the RNAi-resistant HA-MST3 in transiently transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 3A, right panel). The MCF-7-Rnai-2 cells were further transfected with pcDNA3.0, HA-MST3, or Rnai-R-HA-MST3 plasmid and examined for the expression of HA-tagged MST3. The expression of HA-MST3 was only detected in cells transfected with Rnai-R-HA-MST3 (Fig. 3A, left panel). The protruding rate of MCF-7-Rnai-2 cells expressing Rnai-R-HA-MST3 was significantly lower than that of the pcDNA3.0 plasmid transfectants (Fig. 3B). This indicated that the RNAi-resistant MST3 could rescue the enhancement of spreading by shRNA-MST3 in MCF-7-Rnai-2 cells. The transfected cells were further sorted by flow cytometry and analyzed for cell migration. Reintroduction of"

We previously reported that DIF-3 activates glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), resulting in the degradation of cyclin D1 in HeLa cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of DIF-3 on cyclin D1 mutants (R29Q, L32A, T286A, T288A, and T286A/T288A) to clarify the precise mechanisms by which DIF-3 degrades cyclin D1 in HeLa cells. We revealed that T286A, T288A, and T286A/T288A mutants were resistant to DIF-3-induced degradation compared with wild-type cyclin D1, indicating that the phosphorylation of Thr286 and Thr288 were critical for cyclin D1 degradation induced by DIF-3. Indeed, DIF-3 markedly elevated the phosphorylation level of cyclin D1, and mutations introduced to Thr286 and/or Thr288 prevented the phosphorylation induced by DIF-3. Depletion of endogenous GSK-3β and dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 1B (DYRK1B) by RNA interference attenuated the DIF-3-induced cyclin D1 phosphorylation and degradation. The effect of DIF-3 on DYRK1B activity was examined and we found that DIF-3 also activated this kinase. Further, we found that not only GSK-3β but also DYRK1B modulates cyclin D1 subcellular localization by the phosphorylation of Thr288. These results suggest that DIF-3 induces degradation of cyclin D1 through the GSK-3β- and DYRK1B-mediated threonine phosphorylation in HeLa cells.

J. 1988; 249: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), also affect mammalian cells. In the DIF family (DIF-1, DIF-2, and DIF-3), DIF-3 (1-(3-chloro-2,6-dihydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-1-hex-anone) is the most potent inhibitor of proliferation in mammalian cells (3Kubohara Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 381: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the target molecule of DIFs is unknown, even in Dictyostelium. Although Shimizu et al. (4Shimizu K. Murata T. Tagawa T. Takahashi K. Ishikawa R. Abe Y. Hosaka K. Kubohara K. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2568-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) recently reported that calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE1) could be a pharmacological target molecule for DIF-1, specific inhibitor for PDE1 failed to mimic the antiproliferative effect of DIF-1. We reported that DIF-1 and/or DIF-3 inhibited mammalian cell proliferation by suppressing the expression of cyclin D1 via the activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) (5Miwa Y. Sasaguri T. Kosaka C. Taba Y. Ishida A. Abumiya T. Kubohara Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Yasmin T. Takahashi-Yanaga F. Mori J. Miwa Y. Hirata M. Watanabe Y. Morimoto S. Sasaguri T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms underlying cyclin D1 degradation induced by DIFs are not yet known. Cyclin D1 is synthesized in the early G1 phase and plays a key role in the initiation and progression of this phase (9Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 10Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4927) Google Scholar). There is a destruction box-like motif in the N terminus, which is required for cyclin D1 degradation induced by genotoxic stress (11Agami R Bernards R. Cell. 2000; 102: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The expression level of cyclin D1 is regulated by ubiquitin-dependent mechanism, which is triggered by the phosphorylation of threonine residues located near the carboxyl terminus of cyclin D1 (12Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Diehl et al. (13Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar) reported that GSK-3β phosphorylates cyclin D1 on Thr286, thereby stimulating cyclin D1 turnover in response to mitogenic signals. According to the model they proposed, cyclin D1 phosphorylation on Thr286 by GSK-3β induces the exclusion of cyclin D1 from nucleus to initiate its proteasomal degradation. Recently, Zou et al. (14Zou Y. Ewton D.Z. Deng X. Mercer S.E. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) reported that dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 1B (DYRK1B), a member of the DYRK family, phosphorylates cyclin D1 on Thr288, also resulting in its degradation. GSK-3β, a member of the Wnt signaling pathway, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in a variety of cellular processes. Although GSK-3β is a cytosolic protein, it is translocated into the nucleus when activated (15Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 17Harwood A.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). DYRK1B, also a serine/threonine kinase found in nucleus (18Leder S. Weber Y. Altafaj X. Estivill X. Joost H.G. Becker W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), is highly expressed in normal skeletal muscle and certain carcinoma cell lines, including HeLa cells, and is not detectably expressed in many normal tissues (19Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). There are some similarities between GSK-3β and DYRK1B, because they phosphorylate the same substrates (glycogen synthase and cyclin D1) (14Zou Y. Ewton D.Z. Deng X. Mercer S.E. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Skurat A.V. Dietrich A.D. J. Biol.

In this study, we investigated the effect of DIF-3 on cyclin D1 and found that the threonine residues, but not the destruction box-like motif, play a key role in cyclin D1 degradation induced by DIF-3 in HeLa cells. Moreover, we revealed that not only GSK-3β but also DYRK1B was involved in the phosphorylation of cyclin D1 induced by DIF-3 in HeLa cells. Thus DIF-3 efficiently induced degradation of cyclin D1. Chemicals—DIF-3 (1-(3-chloro-2, 6-dihydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-1-hexanone) was synthesized according to Masento et al. (21Masento M.S. Morris H.R. Taylor G.W. Johnson S.J. Skapski A.C. Kay R.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). SB216763 was purchased from BIOMOL international. The monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody, anti-FLAG M2 antibody, and N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) were from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-cyclin D1 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody was from Abcam. Polyclonal anti-DYRK1B antibody was from ABGENT. Monoclonal anti-histone H3 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The wild-type human cyclin D1 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described previously (6Takahashi-Yanaga F. Taba Y. Miwa Y. Kubohara Y. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Morimoto S. Sasaguri T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9663-9670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Human cyclin D1 mutants R29Q, L32A, T286A, T288A, and T286A/T288A were generated by a QuikChange® Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The FLAG-tagged human cyclin D1 constructs were also generated. Human cyclin D1 pGL3 basic luciferase reporter construct was a generous gift from Drs. O. Tetsu and F. McCormick, University of California San Francisco. Transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine™Plus transfection reagent (Invitrogen). RNA Interference (RNAi)—GSK-3β validated Stealth™ RNAi was purchased from Invitrogen. Double-stranded Stealth™ RNAi specifically targeting human DYRK1B (5′-gccugguauuugagcugcuguccua-3′) was synthesized (Invitrogen). Transfection of RNAi was carried out according to the manufacturer protocol using Lipofectamine™ 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Stealth™ RNAi negative controls, which are the GC-matched scrambled sequence, were also purchased from Invitrogen. Western Blot Analysis—Samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semi-dry transfer system (1 h, 12 V). After blocking with 5% skim milk for 1 h, the membrane was probed with a first antibody. The membrane was washed three times and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h. Immunoreactive proteins on the membrane were visualized by treatment with a detection reagent (LumiGLO, Cell Signaling Technology). An optical densitometric scan was performed using Science Lab 99 Image Gauge Software (Fuji Photo Film). Luciferase Reporter Assay—HeLa cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmid and pRL-SV40, a Renilla luciferase expression plasmid (Toyo Ink Mfg Co) for the control of transfection efficiency. Cells were cultured for 24 h after transfection and stimulated with DIF-1 (30 μm) for 1 h. The luciferase activity was determined with a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507, Berthold Technologies) and normalized with respect to Renilla luciferase activity. 32P Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were preincubated in phosphate-free medium (Invitrogen) for 1 h and ALLN (20 μm) was added to prevent cyclin D1 degradation. Subsequently, cells were labeled with 100 μci/ml of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer) for 1 h followed by stimulation with DIF-3. Cells were lysed on ice in the lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 3 min. The cell lysate was precleared with protein G-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) and then incubated with protein G-Sepharose CL-4B and an anti-cyclin D1 antibody or an anti-FLAG antibody (2 μg) at 4 °C for 3 h. After incubation, proteins bound to the antibody/protein G-Sepharose complex were precipitated by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min and washed three times with the lysis buffer. The samples were denatured in SDS sample buffer and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by the transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane prior to autoradiography. The radioactive bands were quantified using Science Lab 99 Image Gauge Software (Fuji Photo Film). After autoradiography, the membrane was subjected to Western blot analysis for cyclin D1. In Vitro DYRK1B Kinase Reaction—The in vitro kinase assay of DYRK1B was carried out according to Lim et al. (22Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were stimulated with or without DIF-3 and immunoprecipitation was carried out using 2 μg of anti-DYRK1B antibody. The immunoprecipitated samples were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with a kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The kinase activities of DYRK1B were tested with 30 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 20 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) from Upstate Biotechnology. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of SDS sample buffer. Samples were then separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 prior to autoradiography. The radioactive bands were quantified using Science Lab 99 Image Gauge Software (Fuji Photo Film). Flow Cytometry—Cells harvested by the trypsin/EDTA treatment were suspended in hypotonic fluorochrome solution containing 50 μg/ml of propidium iodide (PI), 0.1% sodium citrate, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (6Takahashi-Yanaga F. Taba Y. Miwa Y. Kubohara Y. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Morimoto S. Sasaguri T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9663-9670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 103) for each sample were analyzed for fluorescence by a Becton-Dickinson FACScalibur. Purification of Nucleic Proteins—Nucleic proteins were purified from cells transfected with indicated plasmid using NE-PER™ nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce). Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells plated on coverslips were transfected with FLAG-tagged cyclin D1 constructs. Immunofluorescence detection of FLAG-tagged cyclin D1 was performed as described previously using an anti-FLAG antibody (6Takahashi-Yanaga F. Taba Y. Miwa Y. Kubohara Y. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Morimoto S. Sasaguri T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9663-9670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Effect of DIF-3 on Cyclin D1 and Its Mutants—There are at least three independent motifs in cyclin D1 involved in its degradation. The first one is the Arg-X-X-Leu destruction box (Arg29-X-X-Leu32), which plays a major role in rendering cyclin D1 susceptible to degradation by ionizing radiation (11Agami R Bernards R. Cell. 2000; 102: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The second one is Thr286, which is phosphorylated by GSK-3β to induce cyclin D1 degradation (12Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 13Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). The third one is Thr288, recently identified by Zou et al. (14Zou Y. Ewton D.Z. Deng X. Mercer S.E. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), who reported that a serine/threonine kinase DYRK1B phosphorylates cyclin D1 at Thr288, also leading to the degradation of cyclin D1. Therefore, we investigated five different mutants of cyclin D1 (R29Q, L32R, T286A, T288A, and T286A/T288A) to determine the mechanisms by which DIF-3 induces cyclin D1 degradation in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, the effect of DIF-3 on overexpressed wild-type cyclin D1 was similar to the effect on intrinsic cyclin D1. While R29Q and L32R mutants were fully responsive to DIF-3, T286A, T288A, and T286A/T288A mutations significantly reduced the effect of DIF-3 (Fig. 1B). Among these three mutations, T286A/T288A most strongly resisted DIF-3. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of both Thr286 and Thr288 were critical for DIF-3-induced cyclin D1 degradation. To analyze the effect of DIF-3 on cyclin D1 promoter activity, we performed luciferase reporter assay using the human cyclin D1 promoter construct pGL3-basic vector (8Yasmin T. Takahashi-Yanaga F. Mori J. Miwa Y. Hirata M. Watanabe Y. Morimoto S. Sasaguri T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, DIF-3 did not have significant effect on promoter activity after 1 h incubation (440757.8 ± 15929.4 (mean ± S.E., n = 6) for control cells and 425032.3 ± 10135.5 (mean ± S.E., n = 6) for DIF-3-treated cells). This result is consistent with our previous report (6Takahashi-Yanaga F. Taba Y. Miwa Y. Kubohara Y. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Morimoto S. Sasaguri T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9663-9670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) which showed that DIF-3 reduced cyclin D1 mRNA amount after 3 h incubation. Because cells were treated with DIF-3 for 1 h to analyze the effect of DIF-3 on cyclin D1 mutants, we concluded that the reduction of cyclin D1 protein amount was caused by the protein degradation induced by DIF-3. DIF-3-phosphorylated Cyclin D1 at Thr286 and Thr288—We subsequently examined whether DIF-3 induces the phosphorylation of cyclin D1 in intact cells. We have previously reported that ALLN, which inhibits ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation of cyclins, prevented the DIF-3-induced cyclin D1 degradation in HeLa cells. Therefore, cells were pretreated with ALLN to avoid cyclin D1 degradation induced by DIF-3 and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Cyclin D1 was immunoprecipitated for analysis by autoradiography and immunoblotting. By the immunoprecipitation, 51.3 ± 4.5% (mean ± S.E., n = 3) of cyclin D1 was cleared from the lysate. As shown in Fig. 2A, DIF-3 induced phosphorylation of cyclin D1 in a time-dependent manner. Pretreatment with LiCl, which inhibits GSK-3β, prevented the phosphorylation of cyclin D1 induced by DIF-3 (Fig. 2B). To determine whether Thr286 and Thr288 residues are involved in DIF-3-induced cyclin D1 phosphorylation, mutated cyclin D1 proteins (T286A, T288A and T286A/T288A) were overexpressed in HeLa cells. The effect of DIF-1 was greatly attenuated in the T286A mutant and significantly reduced in the T288A cyclin D1 mutant (Fig. 2C). T286A/T288A double mutation almost completely abolished the phosphorylation induced by DIF-3. This result was well correlated with the result shown in Fig. 1B. Thus, DIF-3 seemed to induce cyclin D1 phosphorylation at Thr286 and Thr288, triggering cyclin D1 degradation. Inhibition of GSK-3β Attenuated DIF-3-induced Cyclin D1 Degradation—We previously reported that DIF-3 activated GSK-3β and induced cyclin D1 degradation by the acceleration of ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent proteolysis in HeLa cells (6Takahashi-Yanaga F. Taba Y. Miwa Y. Kubohara Y. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Morimoto S. Sasaguri T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9663-9670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of GSK-3β in DIF-3-induced cyclin D1 degradation, HeLa cells were pretreated with SB216763, a specific GSK-3α and β inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 3A, although SB216763 (20 μm) attenuated the degradation of cyclin D1 induced by DIF-3, this compound could not fully inhibit DIF-3 action, even if this concentration of SB216763 caused complete inhibition of GSK-3β activity in in vitro kinase assay using phospho-Glycogen Synthase Peptide-2 (Upstate Biotechnology) as substrate (data not shown). Subsequently, we attempted to deplete endogenous GSK-3β using RNAi to determine the involvement of GSK-3β in DIF-3 action. As shown in Fig. 3B, the protein level of GSK-3β was markedly reduced by transfection with GSK-3β RNAi. The depletion of GSK-3β by transfection with GSK-3β RNAi attenuated the effect of DIF-3 on cyclin D1 degradation, while control RNAi (GC-matched scrambled sequence) did not have a significant effect (Fig. 3C). These results clearly indicated the involvement of GSK-3β in the DIF-3-induced cyclin D1 degradation but GSK-3β was unlikely to be the only kinase responsible for cyclin D1 degradation induced by DIF-3. Depletion of DYRK1B Attenuated the Cyclin D1 Degradation Induced by DIF-3—Recently, it has been reported that DYRK1B phosphorylates cyclin D1 at Thr288 leading to the proteolysis of cyclin D1 (14Zou Y. Ewton D.Z. Deng X. Mercer S.E. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because DIF-3 induced phosphorylation of Thr288, the involvement of DYRK1B in the DIF-3-induced degradation of cyclin D1 was investigated. For this purpose, endogenous DYRK1B was depleted with RNAi. As shown in Fig. 4A, the protein level of DYRK1B was markedly reduced by transfection with DYRK1B RNAi. Although the control RNAi (GC matched scrambled sequence) did not have a significant effect, the depletion of DYRK1B significantly attenuated the effect of DIF-1 on cyclin D1 degradation (Fig. 4B), suggesting the involvement of DYRK1B in cyclin D1 degradation induced by DIF-3. DIF-3 Activated DYRK1B—To clarify the effect of DIF-3 on DYRK1B activity, in vitro kinase assay was carried out using MBP as substrate (22Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were stimulated with or without DIF-3 for 30 min and DYRK1B was immunoprecipitated to subject to kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 5A, DIF-3 significantly activated DYRK1B by 200% of control after 30 min incubation. Since LiCl almost completely inhibited cyclin D1 phosphorylation induced by DIF-3, the effect of LiCl on DYRK1B activity was examined. Interestingly, LiCl also attenuated the DYRK1B activity but failed to complete inhibition of this kinase (Fig. 5A). This result was agreeable with previous report which observed that LiCl strongly inhibit GSK-3β and weakly but significantly attenuated DYRK1B (14Zou Y. Ewton D.Z. Deng X. Mercer S.E. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We subsequently examined the effect of DYRK1B RNAi. As shown in Fig. 5B, DYRK1B RNAi markedly reduced the kinase activity to 30% of control and this reduction was well correlated with the reduction of DYRK1B protein level by RNAi shown in Fig. 4A. GSK-3β and DYRK1B Phosphorylated Thr286 and Thr288 on Cyclin D1, Respectively, and Modified Cyclin D1 Subcellular Localization—Next, we examined the effect of depletion of GSK-3β and DYRK1B on cyclin D1 phosphorylation induced by DIF-3. As shown in Fig. 6A, the depletion of GSK-3β or DYRK1B significantly reduced but did not abolish the cyclin D1 phosphorylation induced by DIF-3. Subsequently, we examined the effect of depletion of GSK-3β or DYRK1B on phosphorylation of cyclin D1 mutants to clarify which site(s) on cyclin D1, Thr286 or Thr288, are phosphorylated by GSK-3β or DYRK1B. For this experiment, we used FLAG-tagged wild-type and mutated cyclin D1 expression vectors. Fig. 6B showed that DIF-3 failed to induce phosphorylation on T288A cyclin D1 mutant after GSK-3β depletion. On the other hand, T286A cyclin D1 mutant was not significantly phosphorylated by DIF-3 treatment after depletion of DYRK1B. These results suggested that Thr286 was phosphorylated by GSK-3β and Thr288 was phosphorylated by DYRK1B, similarly to the previous reports (13Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar, 14Zou Y. Ewton D.Z. Deng X. Mercer S.E. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We further examined the subcellular localization of wild-type and mutant cyclin D1. As shown in Fig. 6C and D, FLAG-tagged T286A and T288A cyclin D1 mutants were abundant in nucleus compared with wild-type. DIF-3 induced export of wild-type cyclin D1 from the nucleus, whereas T286A and T288A mutations significantly reduced the effect of DIF-3, suggesting that not only Thr286 but also Thr288 plays an important role to modulate the subcellular localization of cyclin D1. Taken together, Thr286 and Thr288 were likely to be phosphorylated by GSK-3β and DYRK1B, respectively, and subcellular localization of cyclin D1 seemed to be modulated by GSK-3β and DYRK1B. GSK-3β and DYRK1B Were Independently Involved in Cyclin D1 Degradation Induced by DIF-3— Furthermore, to investigate the relationship between GSK-3β and DYRK1B in DIF-3 action, RNAi of GSK-3β and DYRK1B were co-transfected. As shown in Fig. 7A, co-transfection of GSK-3β and DYRK1B RNAis exhibited an additive effect for cyclin D1 degradation, suggesting that GSK-3β and DYRK1B independently induce the phosphorylation and the degradation of cyclin D1. Because we previously reported that cyclin D1 depletion is associated with cell cycle arrest following exposure to DIF-3 (6Takahashi-Yanaga F. Taba Y. Miwa Y. Kubohara Y. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Morimoto S. Sasaguri T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9663-9670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of reduction of GSK-3β and/or DYRK1B on DIF-3-induced cell cycle arrest. Although transfection of GSK-3β or DYRK1B RNAi did not have a significant effect on the DIF-3-induced increase in the number of G0/G1 cells, co-transfection of GSK-3β and DYRK1B RNAis significantly attenuated the effect of DIF-3 (Fig. 7B). This result indicated that GSK-3β and DYRK1B played important roles in cell cycle arrest induced by DIF-3 in HeLa cells. Cyclin D1 degradation is facilitated by the phosphorylation of the specific threonine residues 286 and 288, according to previous reports (12Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 14Zou Y. Ewton D.Z. Deng X. Mercer S.E. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that both residues play important roles in DIF-3-induced cyclin D1 degradation. It has been reported that GSK-3β and IκB kinase α (IKK α) phosphorylate Thr286 (23Kwak Y.T. Li R. Becerra C.R. Tripathy D. Frenkel E.P. Verma U.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33945-33952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and that DYRK1B phosphorylates Thr288 of cyclin D1. Although we examined the effect of DIF-3 on IKKα, DIF-3 did not activate this kinase (data not shown). Therefore, GSK-3β seemed to be the only candidate kinase that phosphorylated cyclin D1 at Thr286 upon DIF-3 stimulation. The activity of GSK-3β is increased by the dephosphorylation of Ser9 (15Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 17Harwood A.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and we previously reported that DIF-3 induced the dephosphorylation of Ser9 and stimulated GSK-3β activity (6Takahashi-Yanaga F. Taba Y. Miwa Y. Kubohara Y. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Morimoto S. Sasaguri T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9663-9670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Akt and p90RSK, which are activated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and MAPK cascade, respectively, are candidate enzymes for the phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser9 (24Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar, 25Cross D. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar). However, as we reported previously, DIF-3 did not suppress Akt and even activated p90RSK (6Takahashi-Yanaga F. Taba Y. Miwa Y. Kubohara Y. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Morimoto S. Sasaguri T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9663-9670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). MKK3 has been reported to enhance DYRK1B kinase activity (22Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and we found that DIF-3 also activated MKK3. 3F. Takahashi-Yanaga, unpublished observation. This result might indicate that DIF-3 activates DYRK1B through MKK3 activation. However, we could not address the mechanisms how DIF-3 activates GSK-3β, DYRK1B, and/or MKK3 at present. Further study is required to clarify this point. Shimizu et al. (4Shimizu K. Murata T. Tagawa T. Takahashi K. Ishikawa R. Abe Y. Hosaka K. Kubohara K. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2568-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) reported that PDE1 is a pharmacological target molecule for the DIF-1. Although they showed that DIF-1 strongly inhibited PDE1 activity, they also reported that specific PDE1 inhibitor, 8-methoxymethyl-3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (8-MIBMX) only weakly inhibited cell proliferation in K562 human leukemia cells at the concentration of 300 μm and failed to mimic the effect of DIF-1. Moreover, we found that PDE inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), did not induce cyclin D1 degradation (data not shown). Therefore, it is unlikely that DIFs induce cyclin D1 degradation through the inhibition of PDE1. Recently, we reported that phosphorylation of Thr286 is a crucial event in DIF-1 action to induce cyclin D1 degradation in the squamous cell carcinoma cell line NA, since a T286A mutant of cyclin D1 was much more stable compared with a T288A mutant after DIF-1 treatment (7Mori J. Takahashi-Yanaga F. Miwa Y. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Morimoto S. Shirasuna K. Sasaguri T. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 310: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that both Thr286 and Thr288 residues were strongly phosphorylated by DIF-3 and T286A and T288A cyclin D1 mutants were resistant to DIF-3 treatment in HeLa cells, suggesting that not only Thr286 but also Thr288 plays an important role in DIF-3 action. This difference might be caused by the difference of the expression level of DYRK1B in NA cells and HeLa cells. To our knowledge, no studies on the expression of DYRK1B in NA cells have been reported, whereas HeLa cells have been reported to highly express DYRK1B (19Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). The destruction box-like motif in cyclin D1 (Arg29-X-X-Leu32) has been reported to be required for cyclin D1 degradation induced by genotoxic stress (11Agami R Bernards R. Cell. 2000; 102: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of this motif in DIF-3 action, the effect of DIF-3 on two different mutants (R29Q, L32A) were analyzed. We found that these mutants were fully responsive to DIF-3 treatment, indicating that the destruction box-like motif is not required for DIF-3-induced cyclin D1 degradation. This motif exists in cyclin D1 but not in cyclins D2 and D3. We reported that DIF-3 degrades not only cyclin D1 but also cyclins D2 and D3 (6Takahashi-Yanaga F. Taba Y. Miwa Y. Kubohara Y. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Morimoto S. Sasaguri T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9663-9670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, this result is in agreement with our previous observations. In this study, we showed that GSK-3β and DYRK1B, both of which phosphorylate cyclin D1 to induce its degradation, were involved in DIF-3 action. This may have an important implication in DIF-3-induced cyclin D1 degradation, since DIF-3 induces rapid and strong degradation of cyclin D1 (within 1 h). In tumor cells, genes that directly regulate the cell cycle are often damaged. Among them, cyclin D1 is one of the genes strongly implicated in oncogenesis (10Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4927) Google Scholar). Amplification of the gene encoding cyclin D1 and overexpression of cyclin D1 protein have frequently been demonstrated in several types of human malignant neoplasms (26Barnes D.M. Gillett C.E. Brest Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 52: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 29Fu M. Wang C. Li Z. Sakamaki T. Pestell R.G. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5439-5447Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Moreover, DIFs have been reported to inhibit PDE1 activity (4Shimizu K. Murata T. Tagawa T. Takahashi K. Ishikawa R. Abe Y. Hosaka K. Kubohara K. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2568-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and some inhibitors for PDE1 are expected to be applicable to cancer (30Kakkar R. Raju R.V. Sharma R.K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1164-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Lerner A. Kim D.H. Lee R. Leuk. Lymphoma. 2000; 37: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, it could be suggested that DIFs are potent antitumor agents and identification of the target molecule(s) for DIFs may offer ideas for the design of new anticancer drugs."

Several recent studies have identified novel downstream target genes and shed light on the global transcriptional network regulated by MEF2 in muscle. In our continuing effort to identify novel, downstream pathways controlled by MEF2, we have used mef2a knock-out mice to find those genes dependent on MEF2A transcriptional activity. Here, we describe the characterization of a direct, downstream target gene for the MEF2A transcription factor encoding a large, muscle-specific protein that localizes to the Z-disc/costameric region in striated muscle. This gene, called myomaxin, was identified as a gene markedly down-regulated in MEF2A knock-out hearts.

Myomaxin is expressed as a single, large transcript of ∼11 kilobases in adult heart and skeletal muscle with an open reading frame of 3,283 amino acids. The protein encoded by the myomaxin gene is related to the actin-binding protein Xin and interacts with the sarcomeric Z-disc protein, α-actinin-2.

The mechanisms by which MEF2 (myocyte enhancer factor-2) transcriptional activity is modulated, via specific signal transduction pathways and protein-protein interactions, to regulate gene expression has been extensively characterized (1Black B.L.

We recently reported that the myospryn gene is directly regulated by MEF2A (16Durham J.T. Brand O.M. Arnold M. Reynolds J.G. Muthukumar L. Weiler H. Richardson J.A. Naya F.J. J. Biol.

Using an in silico approach, we identified four such additional cardiomyopathy-associated genes named CMYA1, CMYA2, CMYA3, and CMYA4 in the NCBI data base. These additional CMYA genes are partial human sequences identified by genome scale expression profiling of cardiac muscle (Incyte Genomics) and deposited in the public data base. Interestingly, the full-length mouse orthologs have been reported for human CMYA1, -2, and -4, but those studies were published either prior to the identification of the CMYA genes or failed to point out the similarity to the CMYA genes.

This particular sequence encodes a small portion of Xirp2 that binds F-actin through a novel 16-amino acid repeat sequence named the “Xin repeat” because of its similarity to a repetitive motif present in the muscle protein Xin (19Wang D.Z Reiter R.S. Lin J.L. Wang Q. Williams H.S. Krob S.L. Schultheiss T.M. Evans S. Lin J.J. Development. 1999; 126: 1281-1294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pacholsky D. Vakeel P. Himmel M. Lowe T. Stradal T. Rottner K. Furst D.O. van der Ven P.F. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5257-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A recent paper has also reported the up-regulation of CMYA3 transcripts in hearts from mice exposed to angiotensin II, a known inducer of cardiac hypertrophy (24Duka A. Schwartz F. Duka I. Johns C. Melista E. Gavras I. Gavras H. Am. J. Hypertens. 2006; 19: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of the full-length mouse ortholog of CMYA3/Xirp2, which we have named Myomaxin (myogenic MEF2-activated Xin-related protein). We show that myomaxin is dramatically down-regulated in mef2a knock-out hearts and that it is a direct MEF2 target gene. Furthermore, Myomaxin is localized at the periphery of the Z-disc in striated muscle, where it interacts with sarcomeric α-actinin in two separate subdomains within the actin-binding 16-amino acid repeat region. These findings indicate that Myomaxin may play a role in the regulation of muscle cytoarchitecture downstream of MEF2A. In Silico Analysis and Bioinformatics—Given the similarity of myospryn to CMYA5 (16Durham J.T. Brand O.M. Arnold M. Reynolds J.G. Muthukumar L. Weiler H. Richardson J.A. Naya F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6841-6849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we searched the NCBI data base for additional genes containing the name “cardiomyopathy-associated.” The mouse CMYA3 sequence was identified as one of four such genes whose sequences were deposited by Incyte Genomics. Continued searching of the data base failed to identify additional CMYA genes, indicating that only five novel gene sequences were deposited by Incyte Genomics. Northern Blot Analysis and RT-PCR—A mouse multiple-tissue poly(A)+ RNA blot (Clontech) was hybridized with a 32P-labeled NcoI-EcoRI fragment (nucleotides 8,219-9,051) of the Myomaxin cDNA. For RT-PCR, RNA was extracted from whole hearts using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cDNA was prepared from total RNA using random hexamers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Primers for amplification of the CMYA genes were as follows: CMYA1 (Xin), 5′-CCAGGTAGCTCCTACACCAACCATC-3′ and 5′-TTCAGCTCCTGAATCTCTGAGCGC-3′; CMYA2 (Myomegalin), 5′-GAGGAGCGCATGCAACAGAAGTATGA-3′ and 5′-TGTCGTTTCTCTTGAGACAGCTGTTC-3′; CMYA3 (Myomaxin), 5′-CCCAGCCAAGTGTATGAAGATTGAA-3′ and 5′-ACTGCACCTCTCCTTTGAGGATTTC-3′; CMYA4 (Unc-45), 5′-CCTCGGATGCTTCCAGAGCCAC-3′ and 5′-CCTAGAACCAAGGCCTCCTCCTTCC-3′. For RT-PCR analysis of myomaxin expression during C2C12 differentiation, C2C12s were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells in 10-cm dishes and allowed to grow to confluence (∼3 days) in normal growth medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). The medium was then replaced with differentiation medium (DMEM containing 2% horse serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin), and cells were maintained in differentiation medium for up to 7 days. Cells were harvested at days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 of differentiation in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol, and cDNA was generated as described above. For analysis of myomaxin expression in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, primary cardiomyocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion, as described previously (25Calderone A. Thaik C.M. Takahashi N. Chang D.L. Colucci W.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes at a density of ∼1 × 106 cells and maintained for 24 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing one of the following treatments: 0.5× Nutridoma SP (Roche Applied Science), 0.5× Nutridoma SP plus 100 μm phenylephrine (Sigma), or 10% FBS. Cardiomyocytes were then incubated for 72 h, at which point cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted as described above. Primers used for amplification of myomaxin are the same as above. Primer sequences were as follows: atrial natriuretic factor (mouse and rat), 5′-ACCTGCTAGACCACCTGGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCTTGGCTGTTATCTTCGGTACCGG-3′; BNP (rat), 5′-ATCTCCAGAAGGTGCTGCCCCAGATGA-3′ and 5′-GCCAGGAGGTCTTCCTAAAACAACCTCAG-3′; MCK (mouse), 5′-GATGTCATCCAGACTGGGGTGGACAACC-3′ and 5′-TGAACTCGCCCGTCAGGCTGTTGAG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mouse and rat), 5′-GCCATCAACGACCCCTTCATTG-3′ and 5′-ACTCCACGACATACTCAGCACC-3′; α-Myosin heavy chain (mouse), 5′-CTGCTGGAGAGGTTATTCCTCG-3′ and 5′-GGAAGAGTGAGCGGCGCATCAAGG-3′. Transient Transfections, Coimmunoprecipitations, and Western Blots—COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. For reporter assays, COS cells in 6-well plates, each well containing ∼500,000 cells, were transfected with 0.2 μg of the wild type or mutant forms of the myomaxin promoter in pGL3-Basic (Promega) and 0.2 μg of human MEF2A in pcDNA1 (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and were harvested after 36-48 h. Luciferase assays for the myomaxin promoter in C2C12 cells were performed in the same manner as for COS cells with the exception that 6-well plates were seeded at a density of 300,000 cells/well. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), and protein concentrations were normalized via Bradford assay. For co-immunoprecipitations, COS cells in 100-mm dishes (at 25% confluence) were transfected with 20 μg of expression plasmids for full-length Myomaxin and 5 μg for truncated forms of Myomaxin and α-actinin, using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Myomaxin proteins were fused with an amino-terminal Myc epitope, and α-actinin was fused with an amino-terminal FLAG epitope. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested in ELB buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% IGEPAL, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science)). Extracts were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C using protein A/G-agarose and 1 μl (or 1 μg) of monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Subsequently, the pellet was washed with ELB buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotting using anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma). Gel Shift and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—For gel shift assays, in vitro translated MEF2A was produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) and incubated in the presence of radiolabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to each of the three MEF2 sites in the myomaxin promoter as described previously (16Durham J.T. Brand O.M. Arnold M. Reynolds J.G. Muthukumar L. Weiler H. Richardson J.A. Naya F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6841-6849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For ChIP analysis, C2C12 myoblasts were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 106 in 10-cm dishes induced to differentiate. On day 7, cells were crosslinked with 37% formaldehyde, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and subsequently harvested in cold PBS containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). ChIP assays were carried out according to the manufacturers' suggestions (Upstate Biotechnology) with the following modifications. Cells harvested from one 10-cm dish were sonicated in 800 μlof SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Each 800-μl sample was subsequently split into 200-μl samples and diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer containing protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitations were performed using 4 μg of anti-MEF2A antibody (C-21; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The rat, mouse, and human myomaxin promoter sequences were aligned using the MatInspector program (available on the World Wide Web at www.genomatix.de). Primers used for amplification of the -75 MEF2 site were as follows: 5′-GTGGCTATGGAAGGGAGTTTGAGTG-3′ and 5′-CCAGCTCCACCGAAGAGTCTATGAG-3′. Antibodies and Immunocytochemistry—Rabbit polyclonal anti-Myomaxin antibodies were raised against GST-Myomaxin fusion protein. Antibody BSU2 (GST fusion containing nucleotides 1,699-1,999) was IgG-purified using MabTrap II (Amersham Biosciences) and exhibited the highest specificity with heart and skeletal muscle cryosections. For Western analysis, tissues were extracted in ELB buffer and fractionated in a 6% SDS-PAGE with subsequent immunoblotting using anti-Myomaxin at a dilution of 1:500. For immunostaining, adult mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, hearts were dissected and cryoprotected by immersion in 30% sucrose at 4 °C for 24-48 h. Cryoprotected hearts were then placed in embedding Optimal Cutting Temperature (O.C.T.) compound (Tissue-Tek) and frozen at -80 °C. Hearts were cryosectioned at 15 μm and air-dried on Superfrost Plus Slides (Fisher). Primary antibodies for Myomaxin (BSU2, IgG fraction, dilution 1:100), mouse monoclonal sarcomeric α-actinin (1:100), and secondary antibodies (1:200) for anti-Myomaxin (anti-rabbit Texas Red) and anti-actinin (anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate) were used on heart cryosections. For blocking experiments, GST fusion proteins were constructed for Myomaxin (nucleotides 1,699-1,999) and Myospryn (nucleotides 9,600-9,900), expressed, and purified using glutathione-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences). After the immunostaining procedure, Vectashield (Vector Labs) was applied to heart cryosections and protected with coverslips. In Silico Analysis and Identification of Myomaxin—Given the surprising finding that the MEF2-regulated myospryn gene is the mouse ortholog of human CMYA5 (cardiomyopathy-associated gene 5) we used an in silico approach to identify additional “cardiomyopathy-associated” genes and to test whether these genes are also dysregulated in mef2a knock-out hearts. By searching the NCBI nucleotide data base using the key words “cardiomyopathy-associated,” we found four such additional sequences named CMYA1 (cardiomyopathy-associated gene 1), CMYA2, CMYA3, and CMYA4 (Fig. 1A). All four of these human expressed sequence tags, including CMYA5, were identified by expression profiling of human cardiac muscle and deposited in the NCBI data base (Incyte Genomics, Palo Alto, CA). To determine whether the CMYA1, -2, -3, and -4 genes are similarly dysregulated in mef2a knock-out hearts, we performed RT-PCR with cDNA from postnatal day 5 hearts of mef2a mutant mice using mouse-specific primers for each of these genes. As shown in Fig. 1B, each CMYA gene was down-regulated to some extent (right), but the expression of CMYA3 exhibited the most dramatic down-regulation in mef2a-/- hearts to nearly undetectable levels (left). Similar amplification levels for each of the CMYA genes tested were observed between wild type and heterozygote whole heart cDNA (data not shown). These results indicate that CMYA3 is highly dependent on MEF2A transcriptional activity and have thus named the mouse ortholog, myomaxin (myogenic MEF2-activated Xin-related protein). Regulation of Myomaxin Transcription by MEF2A—To test whether myomaxin represents a direct transcriptional target for MEF2A, we identified the 5′-end of the gene using a combination of the expressed sequence tags data base, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, primer extension, and RNase protection (data not shown). Based on this information, we isolated 5.0 kb of mouse genomic sequence upstream of the first exon and cloned this fragment into the pGL3BASIC-luciferase reporter. MEF2A responsiveness of this 5′ region was tested in transfected COS cells. This 5.0-kb fragment alone exhibited background levels of activity in COS cells. However, when co-transfected with a MEF2A expression vector, the 5.0-kb fragment was induced nearly 5.0-fold (Fig. 2A), indicating that myomaxin is activated by MEF2A. Given the ability of MEF2A to transactivate this upstream fragment, we examined this region for MEF2 binding sites and identified three putative MEF2 sequences exhibiting similarity to the consensus MEF2 site, (C/T)TA(A/T)4TA(G/A). To determine whether MEF2A could bind these sequences, we performed gel mobility shift assays. The MEF2 sequences located at -75 (CTAAAAATAG) and -2937 (TTATTTTTAA) relative to the putative transcription start site bound to in vitro translated MEF2A (Fig. 2C), but binding to the -3096 site (TTATTATTAA) was detectable only upon longer exposure (data not shown). MEF2A failed to bind to the -75 and -2937 MEF2 sites harboring mutations within the core A-T-rich region of the element known to disrupt interactions with MEF2 (Fig. 2C). These results confirm that MEF2A protein directly binds to two MEF2 sites within the myomaxin promoter. To determine whether the myomaxin promoter was being activated through one or more of the MEF2 sites, mutations that disrupt MEF2 binding were introduced within each of the core sequences in the context of the 5.0-kb proximal promoter. As shown in Fig. 2A, mutations within the two upstream MEF2 sites, -2937M and -3096M, had no significant effect on MEF2-dependent transactivation of the myomaxin promoter. In contrast, a mutation within the -75 MEF2 site (-75M), was activated less than 2-fold by MEF2A (Fig. 2A). To further demonstrate that the two upstream MEF2 sites are not necessary for transactivation, we generated a deletion construct lacking the two most upstream sites and determined its ability to be transactivated by MEF2A. This 5′ deletion removed all but the proximal 1.5 kb relative to the transcription start site (Fig. 2B). This construct was induced to a similar level as the 5.0-kb upstream fragment (Fig. 2D), demonstrating that the upstream MEF2 sites are not necessary and that the -75 MEF2 site is sufficient to activate the myomaxin promoter. A mutation of the -75 site in the context of the smaller 1.5-kb fragment also significantly reduced MEF2A-dependent transcription to less than 2-fold (Fig. 2D). To determine whether the 1.5-kb fragment was sufficient to confer muscle specificity, we tested this reporter construct in the C2C12 muscle cell line and showed that this minimal region was highly active in C2 myoblasts as compared with COS cells (Fig. 2E). Moreover, the -75 site is essential for this muscle-specific responsiveness, since a mutation within this proximal MEF2 site nearly completely abolishes muscle-specific reporter activity (Fig. 2E). These results demonstrate that the -75 MEF2 binding site is necessary and sufficient for myomaxin transcriptional regulation. Given the importance of the -75 site for MEF2-dependent transactivation of the myomaxin promoter, we searched for possible evolutionary conservation of the proximal MEF2 site. Indeed, the -75 site and neighboring sequences are conserved between rodents and humans (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the -75 MEF2 site is directly bound by MEF2A in vivo, we performed ChIP analysis on the myomaxin promoter. Nucleosomes were isolated from differentiated C2C12 myotubes and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-MEF2A antibodies (C-21; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). We designed primers that would amplify mouse genomic sequences surrounding the evolutionarily conserved -75 MEF2 site (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, we were able to demonstrate that the -75 MEF2 site in the mouse myomaxin promoter is bound by MEF2A in differentiated myotubes (left). Importantly, ChIP assays performed with IgG and two additional unrelated antibodies, anti-GAL4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-green fluorescent protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), failed to immunoprecipitate the -75 MEF2 site (Fig. 3B, right panel). Collectively, these results demonstrate that myomaxin is a direct transcriptional target for MEF2A. Cloning Full-length Myomaxin—We isolated the full-length mouse Myomaxin cDNA from a Marathon skeletal muscle cDNA library (Clontech) using high fidelity PCR (Roche Applied Science) with gene-specific primers designed against predicted exons in the public data base. These PCR products were sequenced and assembled to generate the full-length cDNA (GenBank™ accession number EF122140). Conceptual translation of the Myomaxin cDNA revealed an open reading frame of 3,283 amino acids with a predicted size of 350 kDa (Fig. 4A). BLAST analysis using the open reading frame of Myomaxin confirms that it is the mouse ortholog of the partial human CMYA3/Xirp2 sequence and also exhibits modest similarity to mouse Xin within the actin-binding 16-amino acid repeat region (amino acids 309-1,599) (Fig. 4A). Using a combination of public (NCBI and Ensembl) and private (Celera) data bases, we identified the entire mouse genomic locus for myomaxin. Mouse myomaxin localizes to chromosome 2 and spans a region covering nearly 100 kilobases (kb) (Fig. 4B). The myomaxin gene has six small exons preceding an unusually large seventh exon, over 9,000 base pairs in length. Surprisingly, the other novel MEF2 target gene we identified recently, myospryn, also encodes a large muscle-specific protein with a large coding exon of over 9,000 nucleotides. Although the myomaxin and myospryn genes do not exhibit any sequence similarity to each other, the resemblance in gene structure is intriguing. Muscle-specific Expression of Myomaxin—Northern analysis of mouse tissues, using a probe derived from the middle portion of the mouse Myomaxin cDNA, revealed a transcript migrating above the 9.5 kb RNA marker and highly restricted to adult heart and skeletal muscle (Fig. 5A, top). Expression was not detected in any other adult mouse tissue. Moreover, myomaxin transcripts were not detected in either mouse aorta or stomach, representative tissues enriched for smooth muscle (Fig. 5A, bottom), indicating a striated muscle-specific expression of the myomaxin gene. myomaxin expression was also examined in the C2C12 myoblast cell line using RT-PCR. myomaxin transcripts were detected in both proliferating C2C12 myoblasts and in differentiating myotubes (Fig. 5B). We observed a modest increase in myomaxin expression at the onset of myogenic differentiation, but surprisingly, the most mature myotubes (day 7) exhibited a robust up-regulation in myomaxin transcription (Fig. 5B). Examination of myomaxin transcripts in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes also showed that myomaxin is expressed in these cells and is up-regulated by hypertrophic stimuli, such as the β-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine, and serum (Fig. 5C). Altogether, these results indicate that myomaxin is a striated muscle-specific gene induced by signals that promote muscle differentiation and growth.

The MAPKs are compact enzymes lacking recognizable protein-protein interaction modules normally found in signaling molecules (3Pawson T. Nash P.

Although the importance of MAPKs in cellular signaling is well established, there is limited understanding of the molecular basis for MAPK recognition by its activators, inactivators, and substrates. Such knowledge is essential for comprehension of the ability of MAPKs to integrate diverse biological stimuli and to transmit signals to the nucleus to generate appropriate cellular responses. Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2), the prototypic member of the MAPK family, has been the subject of intense study. ERK2 is activated by phosphorylation of Thr183 and Tyr185 in the activation lip by the dual specificity MAPK/ERK kinase MEK1. Deactivation of ERK2 activity is carried out by MAPK phosphatase 3 (MKP3) (5Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 6Keyse S.M. Curr.

MKP3 forms a physical complex with ERK2 and is highly specific for ERK2 dephosphorylation with a kcat/Km that is 106-fold higher than that for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate or the bisphosphorylated peptide derived from the ERK2 activation lip (12Zhao Y.

Part of the specificity comes from docking interactions between the N-terminal domain of MKP3 and the non-catalytic regions of ERK2 (12Zhao Y. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol.

Thus, MKP3 substrate specificity is linked to the ability of the substrate to induce productive orientation in the active site. This provides a powerful mechanism to ensure high fidelity in MKP3-mediated ERK2 inactivation. In this mechanism, MKP3 exists in latent inactive states, and upon association with ERK2, MKP3 is activated, leading to selective inactivation of ERK2. The structural basis for the exquisite specificity of ERK2 dephosphorylation by MKP3 has not been elucidated. In fact, it has been notoriously difficult to obtain co-crystals of ERK2 in complex with any of its interacting proteins. To better understand the molecular basis of specific ERK2 recognition by MKP3, we have employed hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (H/DX-MS) to map the interaction surfaces between the two proteins concomitant with complex formation. By combining the information gained from the H/DX-MS experiments and direct biochemical analyses, coupled with molecular modeling, we were able to define the structural elements in both MKP3 and ERK2 that are important for specific recognition. The results also yield a structural model for understanding how efficient and precise docking interactions between ERK2 and its cognate substrates and regulators can be achieved. Protein Expression and Purification—N-terminally His6-tagged ERK2 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified following a published procedure (21Zhou B. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13889-13899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of ERK2/pTpY (ERK2 phosphorylated at both Thr183 and Tyr185) were carried out as described (21Zhou B. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13889-13899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Catalytically inactive MKP3 (MKP3/C293S) with a C-terminal His6 tag and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-MKP3/C293S were expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (14Zhou B. Wu L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35526-35534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis of MKP3 and ERK2—Mutant ERK2 and MKP3 were generated by PCR according to the standard procedure of the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pET15b-His6-ERK2 and pET21a-MKP3-His6 as templates, respectively. All mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. GST Pulldown Analysis—The binding affinity of GST-MKP3/C293S for ERK2 or ERK2/pTpY was determined by GST pulldown and Western blot analyses. Five μg of GST-MKP3/C293S in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.3) was immobilized on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) by gentle agitation at 4 °C for 2 h. Different concentrations of ERK2 or ERK2/pTpY in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 were incubated with 20 μl of GST-MKP3/C293S-bound beads with gentle agitation at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing the beads once with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and three more washes with phosphate-buffered saline, 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer was added to the beads. GST-MKP3/C293S and bound ERK2 (or ERK2/pTpY) were released by boiling the beads for 5 min at 95 °C. The sample was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant (15 μl) was loaded onto 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electro-phoresis, the proteins on the gel were transferred at 25 mA to nitrocellulose membrane overnight at 4 °C. Rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody (catalog no. 9101, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and rabbit anti-p44/42 MAPK antibody (catalog no. 9102, Cell Signaling Technology. Inc.) were used as primary antibodies to detected phospho-ERK2 and ERK2, respectively, on the membrane. H/DX-MS—Hydrogen/deuterium exchange in MKP3/C293S and ERK2/pTpY, either alone or in complex, was initiated by diluting 1 μl of the stock solution (200 μm) to 19 μl of the D2O buffer (20 mm Tris and 100 mm NaCl, pD 7.5) on ice. The lower temperature was chosen because exchange was too rapid to be monitored at room temperature by manual quenching. The final protein concentration was 10 μm. The resulting hydrogen/deuterium exchange solutions were maintained at 0 °C by leaving the sample on ice and allowed for exchange for different periods of time. At appropriate intervals, the hydrogen/deuterium exchange reaction was quenched by the addition of an equal volume of cold 0.5 m phosphate buffer, pH 2.5. One μl of the deuterated protein solution was loaded immediately onto a Vydac C4 column (1.0 × 50 mm) and analyzed by mass spectrometry for global exchange. Changes in deuterium incorporation within specific regions of proteins can be detected by peptidic digestion of the deuterium-labeled proteins, followed by HPLC separation and mass spectrometric analysis. To analyze hydrogen/deuterium exchange in segments of MKP3/C293S and ERK2/pTpY proteins, the hydrogen/deuterium exchange reaction was quenched by the addition of an equal volume of cold 0.5 m phosphate buffer, pH 2.5, in the presence of 20 μm pepsin. Immediately, 5 μl of the sample was injected into the sample loop, where pepsin digestion proceeded at 0 °C for 4 min. The pepsin digests were subsequently separated on a Vydac C18 column (1.0 × 50 mm). A Shimadzu HPLC system equipped with two LC-10ADVP pumps was used to generate an acetonitrile gradient. Solvent A was 94.9% H2O containing 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid, and Solvent B was 95% acetonitrile containing 4.9% H2O and 0.1% formic acid. A low volume static mixing tee was used to minimize the delay period for HPLC. The solvent pre-cooling coil, static mixing tee, Rheodyne injector, and column were immersed in an ice bath (0 °C) to minimize back-exchange with HPLC solvents. After being desalted at 5% solvent B for 5 min, the protein eluted with a 2-min 30-50% solvent B gradient, and the peptidic peptides eluted with a 0.5-min 5-15% solvent B gradient, followed by an 8-min 15-45% solvent B gradient. The column effluent (50 μl/min) was delivered directly to a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Deca XP Plus ion trap mass spectrometer for mass analyses of the deuterated protein and its peptic fragments. MagTran Version 1.0 software (written by Dr. Zhongqi Zhang) was used to determine the centroid value for each peak in the list processed from the mass spectrum. The sequences of the peptide fragments obtained after pepsin digestion were identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The total ion intensity of the peptides was detected in the m/z range of 400-2000. Mass scanning was followed by collision-induced dissociation to acquire a tandem mass spectrum within a peak during the HPLC run. Tandem mass spectra were interpreted by searching peptide data bases using the SEQUEST algorithm. The extent of hydrogen/deuterium exchange was calculated using Equation 1, D=m-m0%m100%-m0%H(Eq. 1) where m is the measured mass of the deuterated protein or peptide; m0% is the measured mass of a “zero-deuteration” control prepared by adding 1 μl of 200 μm protein solution to a 19:20 (v/v) mixture of deuterated buffer and quenching buffer; m100% is the measured mass of a “full-deuteration” control prepared by incubating the protein sample for 16 h at room temperature in 3 m deuterated guanidine hydrogen chloride, followed by the addition of an equal volume of cold quenching buffer; and H is the total exchangeable amide hydrogens. Molecular Modeling of ERK2/pTpY and MKP3 Interactions—The crystal and NMR structures of ERK2 and MKP3, together with H/DX-MS and mutagenesis data, were used to generate a model for the ERK2-MKP3 complex. The ERK2-MKP3 kinase interaction motif (KIM; referred to as KIMMKP3; Protein Data Bank code 2FYS) structure (22Liu S. Sun J.P. Zhou B. Zhang Z.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5326-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was utilized as the starting point for modeling the interaction between the N-terminal domain of MKP3 and ERK2. The KIM peptide (residues 64-74) from the NMR structure (Protein Data Bank code 1HZM) (20Farooq A. Chaturvedi G. Mujtaba S. Plotnikova O. Zeng L. Dhalluin C. Ashton R. Zhou M.M. Mol Cell. 2001; 7: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was docked onto the ERK2 structure with contacts analogous to those found in the experimentally determined ERK2-KIMMKP3 structure (22Liu S. Sun J.P. Zhou B. Zhang Z.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5326-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Residues 101-107 in the NMR structure were extended in the model using program O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The orientation of the N-terminal domain of MKP3 relative to ERK2 was adjusted based on the H/DX-MS and mutational results. The resulting model was then stereo-chemically refined by energy minimization using the program CNS (24Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated ERK2 structure (Protein Data Bank code 2ERK) (25Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of MKP3 (Protein Data Bank code 1MKP) (18Stewart A.E. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. McDonald N.Q. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) were utilized as the starting point for modeling the interaction between ERK2 and the C-terminal domain of MKP3. The ERK2/pTpY structure superimposes with a root mean square deviation of 0.59 Å with ERK2-KIMMKP3 and is thus quite similar. The model was created using program O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) based on the following constraints: phospho-Tyr185 in ERK2 binds the MKP3 active site; the WpD loop adopts a closed conformation; there is no contact between MKP3 and ERK2 peptides 54-65 and 330-358 (based on the hydrogen/deuterium exchange results); and the MKP3 peptide 362LYFTAPSN369 occupies the previously implicated ERK2 substrate-binding (SB) site (15Zhang J. Zhou B. Zheng C.F. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29901-29912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Lee T. Hoofnagle A.N. Kabuyama Y. Stroud J. Min X. Goldsmith E.J. Chen L. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Finally, the model was refined using the program CNS (24Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). H/DX-MS has emerged in recent years as a powerful tool for mapping protein-ligand and protein-protein interfaces as well as identifying conformational and dynamic perturbations in proteins (27Hoofnagle A.N. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to define the ERK2/pTpY-MKP3 binding sites by determining the changes in solvent accessibility of the protein backbone amides as a result of complex formation between the full-length proteins in solution. However, given the transient nature of the enzyme-substrate complex, it is difficult to study the binding interaction between wild-type MKP3 and doubly phosphorylated ERK2/pTpY. Fortunately, catalysis by the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily requires an essential nucleophilic Cys (28Zhang Z.Y. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 171-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and the catalytically inactive Cys-to-Ser mutant (e.g. Cys293 in MKP3) retains the ability to bind substrates, but is unable to carry out substrate dephosphorylation. In fact, the Cys-to-Ser mutant binds substrates/ligands with the same affinity as the wild-type enzyme (29Wang F. Li W. Emmett M.R. Hendrickson C.L. Marshall A.G. Zhang Y.L. Wu L. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15289-15299Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31Xie L. Zhang Y.L. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4032-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Consequently, we employed catalytically inactive MKP3/C293S to capture the enzyme-substrate complex and to prevent the hydrolysis of ERK2/pTpY during H/DX-MS analysis. Binding Affinity of MKP3/C293S for ERK2/pTpY—The affinity of MKP3/C293S for ERK2 (Kd = 0.13 ± 0.01 μm) is similar to that of wild-type MKP3 (Kd = 0.17 ± 0.04 μm) (14Zhou B. Wu L. Shen K. Zhang J. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6506-6515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, GST-MKP3 and MKP3 display identical affinity for ERK2 (17Zhou B. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35526-35534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To determine the Kd for MKP3/C293S and ERK2/pTpY, we carried out GST-MKP3/C293S pulldown experiments to measure ERK2/pTpY binding directly. As a control, we also performed GST-MKP3/C293S pulldown of unphosphorylated ERK2. The amount of ERK2 or ERK2/pTpY associated with GST-MKP3/C293S was visualized by anti-ERK2 or anti-phospho-ERK2 antibody and quantified by densitometry (Fig. 1). The dissociation constant (Kd) for ERK2 binding to GST-MKP3/C293S is 0.19 ± 0.06 μm, which is similar to that measured previously by a competition-based assay (14Zhou B. Wu L. Shen K. Zhang J. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6506-6515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Likewise, the Kd determined by the pulldown experiments for GST-MKP3/C293S and ERK2/pTpY is 31 ± 5 nm, which is comparable with the Km of MKP3 for ERK2/pTpY (22 ± 5 nm) (12Zhao Y. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32382-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, GST-MKP3/C293S binds doubly phosphorylated ERK2 6-fold tighter than unphosphorylated ERK2, consistent with the expectation that the interactions between the MKP3 active site and the phosphoamino acids in ERK2 should further enhance the binding affinity between the two proteins. Obviously, characterization of the interfaces between MKP3/C293S and ERK2/pTpY should enhance our understanding of ERK2 recognition by MKP3. Global Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange in Intact MKP3/C293S and ERK2/pTpY—In a typical H/DX-MS experiment, MKP3/C293S and ERK2/pTpY, either alone or in complex, were incubated in D2O to allow exchange of protons with solvent deuterium, and mass spectrometry was used to monitor the in-exchange rates. The final concentration for both proteins was 10 μm. Given the Kd (31 nm) for complex formation, 95% of MKP3/C293S and ERK2/pTpY should be in the bound state under our experimental conditions. C-terminally His6-tagged MKP3/C293S contains 387 amino acids (43,117.5 Da) with 365 exchangeable amide hydrogens, whereas N-terminally His6-tagged ERK2/pYpT has 364 residues (42,328.0 Da) with 343 exchangeable amide hydrogens. Fig. 2 shows the total deuterium incorporation into MKP3/C293S and ERK2/pTpY in either the free or bound form. Within 40 min, a total of 190 amide hydrogens in MKP3/C293S were replaced with deuterium in the absence of ERK2/pTpY, whereas 136 of the MKP3/C293S amide protons were exchanged with deuterium in the presence of ERK2/pTpY, indicating that 54 amide protons in MKP3/C293S were protected from deuterium exchange upon complex formation. Compared with ERK2/pTpY alone, 30 of the ERK2 amide protons were protected from exchange in the ERK2/pTpY-MKP3/C293S complex. These results indicate that an overall decrease in solvent accessibility occurred in MKP3/C293S and ERK2/pTpY as a result of protein-protein interaction. By determining the changes in solvent accessibility of MKP3/C293S and ERK2/pTpY resulting from complex formation, one can identify the ERK2-MKP3 binding interfaces and the structural changes that accompany the complex formation. Changes in Solvent Accessibility in Specific Segments of MKP3/C293S and ERK2/pTpY upon Complex Formation—H/DX-MS combined with peptidic mapping permits segment-specific identification of solvent-accessible exchange sites in proteins. The principle for this approach is that ligand binding or protein-protein interaction perturbs protein structure and thus solvent accessibility of the contact regions. The binding interfaces can be localized by comparing the rates of hydrogen/deuterium exchange on proteins in bound and unbound states. To identify the segments of MKP3/C293S and ERK2/pTpY that displayed altered solvent accessibility, deuterium uptake in MKP3/C293S and ERK2/pTpY was locked in place at various times by rapidly lowering the pH and temperature; the proteins were digested with pepsin; and the resulting peptides were separated by HPLC and analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. This measurement reports time-dependent changes in weighted average peptide masses, which yields rates of hydrogen/deuterium exchange within different regions of the protein (27Hoofnagle A.N. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Overall, 49 peptides (including those with overlapping sequences), covering 92% of the MKP3 amino acid sequence, were identified by MS/MS as shown by the coverage map (Fig. 3). Of the 49 peptides, 30 displayed reduced exchange rates, 2 exhibited an increase in exchange rates, and 17 had no change in deuterium incorporation upon binding to ERK2/pTpY. For ERK2/pTpY, 47 peptides were identified, effectively covering 92.5% of the primary structure (Fig. 4). Upon complex formation with MKP3/C293S, there were 22 peptides displaying a decrease in deuterium incorporation, 22 showing no change, and 3 exhibiting an increase in deuterium incorporation.FIGURE 4H/DX-MS analysis of ERK2/pTpY.

https://openalex.org/W2026210212,"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is necessary for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)-induced cell cycle progression. To determine the molecular mechanism linking PI3K to TSH, we have identified a serine residue in p85αPI3K phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) in vitro and in vivo. Expression of an alanine mutant (p85A) abolished cyclic AMP/TSH-induced cell cycle progression and was lethal in thyroid cells (FRTL-5). The aspartic version of the p85αPI3K (p85D) inhibited apoptosis following TSH withdrawal. The p85αPI3K wild type not the p85A bound PKA regulatory subunit RIIβ in cells stimulated with cAMP or TSH. The binding of the aspartic version of p85αPI3K to RIIβ was independent of cAMP or TSH stimulation. Similarly, binding of PI3K to p21Ras and activation of AKT, a downstream PI3K target, were severely impaired in cells expressing the p85A mutant. Finally, we found that the catalytic activity of PI3K was stimulated by TSH in cells expressing the wild-type p85αPI3K but not in cells expressing p85A. This latter mutant did not affect the epidermal growth factor-stimulated PI3K activity. We suggest that (1) TSH–cAMP-induced PKA phosphorylates p85αPI3K at serine 83, (2) phosphorylated p85αPI3K binds RIIβ-PKA and targets PKAII to the membrane, and (3) PI3K activity and p21Ras binding to PI3K increase and activate PI3K downstream targets. This pathway is essential for the transmission of TSH–cAMP growth signals."
https://openalex.org/W2028676968,"The calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) is an allosteric protein that responds to extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]o) and aromatic amino acids with the production of different patterns of oscillations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). An increase in [Ca2+]o stimulates phospholipase C-mediated production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and causes sinusoidal oscillations in [Ca2+]i. Conversely, aromatic amino acid-induced CaR activation does not stimulate phospholipase C but engages an unidentified signaling mechanism that promotes transient oscillations in [Ca2+]i. We show here that the [Ca2+]i oscillations stimulated by aromatic amino acids were selectively abolished by TRPC1 down-regulation using either a pool of small inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs) or two different individual siRNAs that targeted different coding regions of TRPC1. Furthermore, [Ca2+]i oscillations stimulated by aromatic amino acids were also abolished by inhibition of TRPC1 function with an antibody that binds the pore region of the channel. We also show that aromatic amino acid-stimulated [Ca2+]i oscillations can be prevented by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors or siRNA-mediated PKCα down-regulation and impaired by either calmodulin antagonists or by the expression of a dominant-negative calmodulin mutant.

Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2003; 12: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting that this receptor plays additional, yet to be defined, physiological roles in the regulation of cell function. Indeed, recent evidence indicates that the CaR is involved in the control of intestinal fluid transport (6Geibel J. Sritharan K. Geibel R. Geibel P. Persing J.S. Seeger A. Roepke T.K. Deichstetter M.

Recent studies of CaR activation in individual living cells have shown that the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) oscillates upon stimulation of CaR by an elevation in [Ca2+]o (9Breitwieser G.E. Gama L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1412-C1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Young S.H. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1414-C1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition to its role as a sensor of [Ca2+]o, the CaR is also stimulated by aromatic amino acids (11Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4814-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) that, like [Ca2+]o, induce striking and lasting CaR-mediated [Ca2+]i oscillations (10Young S.H. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1414-C1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, the patterns of [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by aromatic amino acids and [Ca2+]o, which bind to topographically separate sites in the CaR (12Mun H.C. Culverston E.L. Franks A.H. Collyer C.A.

Physiol. 2002; 282: C1414-C1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Aromatic amino acid stimulation of the CaR induces repetitive, low frequency, [Ca2+]i spikes that return to the baseline level, a pattern known as transient oscillations. In contrast, [Ca2+]o-elicited CaR activation produces high frequency sinus-oidal oscillations upon a raised plateau level of [Ca2+]i. The amplitude, frequency, and duration of [Ca2+]i oscillations are increasingly recognized to encode important information for a variety of biological processes, including gene expression and cell metabolism. However, the precise mechanisms responsible for the generation of different types of [Ca2+]i oscillations remain incompletely understood (14Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). Our previous studies indicated that activation of the CaR by increases in [Ca2+]o promotes sinusoidal [Ca2+]i oscillations through a phospholipase C/inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) cascade (18Rey O. Young S.H. Yuan J. Slice L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22875-22882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and that protein kinase C (PKC) negatively regulates the frequency of [Ca2+]o-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations (19Young S.H. Wu S.V. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46871-46876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the transient [Ca2+]i oscillations elicited by the CaR in response to amino acid stimulation do not involve the PLC/Ins(1,4,5)P3 cascade but a different signaling pathway that requires the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and involves the heterotrimeric proteins of the G12 subfamily, the small GTPase Rho, the scaffolding protein filamin-A, and the cytoplasmic tail of the CaR (18Rey O. Young S.H. Yuan J. Slice L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22875-22882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism(s) that generates the transient [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by the CaR has not been determined, we previously demonstrated that 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, a modulator of cationic channels encoded by transient receptor potential (TRP) genes including TRPC1 (20Xu S.Z.

Neuron. 2002; 34: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), abolished the transient, but not the sinusoidal, [Ca2+]i oscillations mediated by the CaR (10Young S.H. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1414-C1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The most frequently proposed TRPC1 activation signal in mammals is calcium depletion from intracellular stores (reviewed in Refs. 22Beech D.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2005; 451: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar and 23Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). In addition, other mechanisms that do not involve store depletion, such as receptor activation and plasma membrane stretch, can also lead to TRPC1 activation (24Albert A.P. Large W.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Maroto R. Raso A. Wood T.G. Kurosky A. Martinac B. Hamill O.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a new concept of multiplicity of activation, including receptor- and store-operated modes of activation in the same cell, is emerging based on recent studies with the TRPC1-related TRPC5 and TRPC7 channels (27Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1709-C1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Zeng F. Xu S.Z. Jackson P.K. McHugh D. Kumar B. Fountain S.J. Beech D.J. J. Physiol. 2004; 559: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that TRPC1, a highly conserved and widely expressed channel that allows the flux of sodium and calcium across the plasma membrane (29Beech D.J. Xu S.Z. McHugh D. Flemming R. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), is an essential element in the generation of transient [Ca2+]i oscillations in response to stimulation of the CaR by aromatic amino acids. Cell Culture and cDNA Transfections—Human embryonic kidney (HEK-293), obtained from American Type Cell Collection, and HEK-293 cells expressing the CaR (HEK-CaR) (18Rey O. Young S.H. Yuan J. Slice L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22875-22882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air. cDNAs encoding wild-type calmodulin (CaM) and dominant-negative CaM (DN-CaM) were previously described (30Gamper N. Shapiro M.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). cDNA transfections were carried out in Opti-MEM using Lipofectamine Plus according to the manufacturer's suggested conditions (Invitrogen). Immunocytochemistry, Confocal Microscopy, and Quantitative Imaging Analysis—For immunocytochemistry, the cells were fixed in 10% buffered formalin phosphate for 15 min at 25 °C and then permeabilized with a solution of 0.4% Triton X-100-phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min at 25 °C. After extensive PBS washing, the fixed cells were incubated for 18 h at 25 °C in blocking buffer (PBS-1% gelatin-0.05% Tween 20) and then stained at 25 °C for 60 min with the primary antibodies. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 at 25 °C and stained at 25 °C for 60 min with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer and washed again with PBS-0.05% Tween 20. The samples were then mounted with a gelvatol-glycerol solution containing 2.5% 1,4-diazobicyclo-[2.2.2]octane. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss PASCAL (Germany) laser-scanning microscope and a ×63 Zeiss Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective (numerical aperture, 1.45). Alexa 488 was excited with 488 nm light, and its emission (green) was selected through a 505/530 band pass filter. Alexa 546 was excited at 543 nm, and its emission (red) was detected through a 560 long pass filter. Images were collected in multitrack mode using the same image acquisition settings with LSM5 PASCAL imaging system software version 3.2 SP2 (Zeiss). Quantitative imaging analysis to assess the colocalization of the CaR and TRPC1 was performed using Manders' overlap coefficient (31Manders E.M. Verbeek F.J. Aten J.A. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1993; 169: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar) as implemented by CoLocalizer Pro v. 1.4 software. The overlap coefficients generated by Manders' equation have values between 0 and 1; a value of 0 indicates that there is no colocalization, whereas a value of 1.0 means there is complete colocalization. A total of 10 fields from different dishes, each one containing at least 20 cells, were analyzed and the results obtained shown for a representative set of cells. Scatter gram shows the distribution of pixels in the image according to the selected pair of channels (green and red) with colocalized pixels in white. Single Cell [Ca2+]i Imaging—The cells were incubated in saline solution (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution; Invitrogen) without phenol red, containing 138 mm NaCl, 4 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm KCl, 0.3 mm KH2PO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 5.6 mm d-glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 5 μm fura-2 AM for 45-60 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed and placed in an experimental chamber, which was perfused with saline solution at 1.5 ml/min at 37 °C. The chamber, in turn, was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope connected to a digital imaging system. Ratios of images (340 nm excitation/380 nm excitation, emission filter 520 nm) were obtained at 1.5-s intervals (10Young S.H. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1414-C1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A region of interest covering 15 × 15 μm was defined over each cell, and the average ratio intensity over the region was converted to [Ca2+]i using a calibration curve constructed with a series of calibrated buffered calcium solutions (Calcium Calibration Buffer Kit 2; Molecular Probes). A minimum of 100 cells/experiment, each experiment done in at least triplicate, was used to measure [Ca2+]i. Small Inhibitory RNA (siRNA) Transfections and Western Blots—SMART pool siRNA duplexes for human TRPC1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_003304), PKCα (GenBank™ accession number NM_002737), and PKCβ1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_002738) were purchased from Dharmacon. Individual TRPC1 siRNA duplexes (sense sequences), also purchased from Dharmacon, were: oligo 1, GGACUACGGUUGUCAGAAAUU, and oligo 2, GAGAAGAACUGCAGUCCUUUU. HEK-CaR cells plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/35-mm dishes were transfected with siRNA using TransIT-TKO Reagent (Mirus) as recommended by the manufacturer. Control transfections were carried out with TransIT-TKO alone or with Dharmacon siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA (catalog number D-001206-13). siRNA-transfected cells were used 48 h post-transfection. Transfection efficiency was examined with a non-targeting fluorescein-labeled siRNA (Cell Signaling). Western Blot Analysis—Samples of cell lysates were directly solubilized by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following SDS-4.5-15% PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.) and blocked by overnight incubation with 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS-0.05% Tween 20 (PT). Membranes were then incubated at room temperature for 3 h with the primary antiserum diluted in PT. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgGs and enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Analysis of [Ca2+]i Amplitude Response to [Ca2+]o after TRPC1 Down-regulation—HEK-CaR cells transfected with non-targeted siRNA (50 nm), pooled TRPC1 siRNA (50 nm), TRPC1 siRNA1 (50 nm), or TRPC1 siRNA 2 (50 nm) were challenged 48 h post-transfection with 5 mm Ca2+ and the average amplitude of the [Ca2+]i change determined in individual cells. We performed six separate experiments, examining 100cells/condition. In order to combine the data from the separate experiments, we normalized for each experiment the Ca2+ response by dividing the average amplitude from each of the TRPC1 siRNA-transfected cells by the ones transfected with non-targeted siRNA, e.g. pooled TRPC1 siRNA/non-targeted siRNA. The normalized responses from each of the six experiments were used to obtain a cumulative mean normalized response for each siRNA treatment. Materials—Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (anti-PKCα, anti-PKCβ1); Affinity BioReagents (murine monoclonal anti-CaR); Alomone Labs (rabbit polyclonal anti-TRPC1); Abcam (murine monoclonal anti-α-tubulin and anti-actin); Molecular Probes (anti-rabbit Alexa 488 and anti-mouse Alexa 546); and Invitrogen (anti-Myc). Fura-2 AM was purchased from Molecular Probes. All the other reagents were the highest grade commercially available. Expression and Intracellular Distribution of TRPC1 in HEK-293 Cells—HEK-293 stably expressing the human CaR, referred to as HEK-CaR, is a cell system widely used to study the regulation of the CaR (32Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). Initially, we verified that HEK-CaR express TRPC1, and subsequently we examined the intracellular distribution of this channel and the CaR. As shown in Fig. 1, top panel, HEK-CaR cells, as well as the parental HEK-293 cell line, express similar levels of TRPC1 as demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy of HEK-CaR cells co-stained with rabbit anti-TRPC1 and mouse monoclonal anti-CaR revealed TRPC1 immunoreactivity throughout the cytosol and a punctate distribution pattern in the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A), whereas CaR immunoreactivity was most prominent at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B). No immunoreactivity was detected in HEK-CaR cells when the antibodies used against CaR or TRPC1 were preabsorbed with their corresponding immunizing peptides or in HEK-293 cells incubated with the anti-CaR antibody (data not shown). Quantitative imaging analysis of the distribution of TRPC1 and the CaR revealed that both proteins colocalized in discrete regions of the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C) with overlap coefficients of 0.014 ± 0.013 (mean ± S.E.) and 0.25 ± 0.013 for HEK-293 and HEK-CaR cells, respectively, as calculated by Manders' equation (31Manders E.M. Verbeek F.J. Aten J.A. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1993; 169: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). The scatter gram (Fig. 1, inset) provides a qualitative analysis that shows the distribution of green and red pixels as well as the colocalized ones (white) displayed in panel D. The significant colocalization of CaR and TRPC1 is consistent with previous reports showing that these proteins localize to caveolin-rich plasma membrane domains (33Kifor O. MacLeod R.J. Diaz R. Bai M. Yamaguchi T. Yao T. Kifor I. Brown E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F291-F302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11934-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Once we established that HEK-CaR cells express TRPC1, we proceeded to examine the hypothesis that this cation channel mediates the CaR-mediated transient [Ca2+]i oscillations. HEK-CaR cells were transfected with siRNA targeted against TRPC1 to examine changes in [Ca2+]i after stimulation of the CaR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” siRNAs Targeting Different Regions of TRPC1 Prevent Transient [Ca2+]i Oscillations in Response to l-Phe—As illustrated in Fig. 2A, intracellular Ca2+ imaging revealed that addition of 5 mm l-Phe to HEK-CaR cells stimulated striking transient [Ca2+]i oscillations and that each [Ca2+]i peak returned to base-line value. In contrast, an increase in the [Ca2+]o from 1.5 to5mm induced a rapid elevation in [Ca2+]i to a new base-line level followed by oscillatory [Ca2+]i fluctuations. These sinusoidal [Ca2+]i oscillations ceased when [Ca2+]o was returned to 1.5 mm. Addition of l-Phe or [Ca2+]o to wild-type HEK-293 cells did not induce any detectable change in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that the [Ca2+]i oscillations observed in HEK-CaR in response to l-Phe and [Ca2+]o stimulation were associated to the expression of the CaR. In some occasions, we observed in less than 3% of non-stimulated HEK-293 or HEK-CaR cells an upward drift in base-line [Ca2+]i that never exceeds 5% of the initial measurement over 600 s of recording (data not shown). Transfection of HEK-CaR cells with non-targeted siRNA did not affect the production of [Ca2+]i oscillations induced by l-Phe or [Ca2+]o (Fig. 2C). However, the transient, but not sinusoidal, [Ca2+]i oscillations were selectively inhibited in HEK-CaR cells transfected with a pool of TRPC1 siRNA (Fig. 2D). Analysis of the ratio between the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i oscillations in cells transfected with the different TRPC1 siR-NAs and non-targeted siRNA indicates that TRPC1 knock down did not significantly affect the CaR-mediated response to extracellular Ca2+ (pool TRPC1 siRNA/non-targeted siRNA = 1.00 + 0.16, mean ± S.E.; TRPC1 siRNA 1/non-targeted siRNA = 1.07 + 0.18; TRPC1 siRNA 2/non-targeted siRNA = 0.87 + 0.16; see “Experimental Procedures” for further details). To exclude the possibility that the inhibitory effect on l-Phe-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations by the pool of TRPC1 siRNA was due to off-target effects (35Jackson A.L. Linsley P.S. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 521-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), we performed additional experiments using two individual siRNA that targeted different coding regions of TRPC1. We found that the individual siRNAs prevented the production of [Ca2+]i oscillations in response to l-Phe as effectively as the pool of TRPC1 siRNA (Fig. 2, E and F). [Ca2+]i mobilization in response to carbachol stimulation, which acts through muscarinic receptors endogenously expressed in HEK-293 cells, was not affected by TRPC1 siRNA (data not shown). The siRNA directed against TRPC1 reduced the l-Phe-elicited [Ca2+]i oscillations in a dose-dependent manner, i.e. the number of cells responding to l-Phe stimulation decreased as a function of higher concentrations of TRPC1-targeted siRNA (Fig. 2G). As illustrated in Fig. 2, H and I, a significant reduction of TRPC1 protein expression, but not of α-tubulin or actin, was detected in HEK-CaR cells treated either with the pool or with the individual TRPC1 siRNA, indicating that its down-regulation was specific. Non-targeting siRNA neither affects the number of cells responding to l-Phe stimulation nor decreases TRPC1 protein expression levels in HEK-CaR cells (Fig. 2 H and I). Together, these results indicate that TRPC1 siRNA produced an on-target effect and that this effect, i.e. TRPC1 expression down-regulation, inhibits the generation of transient [Ca2+]i oscillations mediated by the CaR in response to l-Phe stimulation. An Antibody Directed against the Pore Region of TRPC1 Blocks the Transient [Ca2+]i Oscillations in Response to l-Phe—As an independent test of the hypothesis that TRPC1 mediates the transient [Ca2+]i oscillations elicited by l-Phe-stimulation of the CaR, we used an antibody that interferes in vivo with the activity of this channel by binding the peptide sequence 557QLYDKGYTSKEQKDC571 located in the pore region of the human TRPC1 (36Rosado J.A. Brownlow S.L. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42157-42163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Exposure of HEK-CaR cells to the anti-TRPC1 antibody for 30 min inhibited l-Pheelicited transient [Ca2+]i oscillations (Fig. 3B) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). Importantly, the anti-TRPC1 antibody did not interfere with the [Ca2+]o-stimulated sinusoidal [Ca2+]i oscillations (Fig. 3B). The transient [Ca2+]i oscillations inhibition mediated by the anti-TRPC1 antibody was abolished by preabsorbing the antibody during 1 h with 15 μg/ml of the immunizing peptide (Fig. 3C). No inhibition of sinusoidal or transient [Ca2+]i oscillations was observed when the cells were exposed to an unrelated antibody, e.g. anti-Myc (Fig. 3D). These results further demonstrate that interference with TRPC1 function blocks the transient, but not the sinusoidal, [Ca2+]i oscillations mediated by the CaR. Because TRPC1 can form homo- and heterotetramers (37Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 38Zagranichnaya T.K. Wu X. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29559-29569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), further experiments are needed to determine whether other TRPCs also participate in the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations mediated by the CaR in response to aromatic amino acid stimulation. Role of PKCα and Calmodulin in the Generation of Transient [Ca2+]i Oscillations—We next asked how TRPC1 could contribute to the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations in response to CaR activation rather than produce a persistent increase in Ca2+ influx, its well known role in mediating store-operated Ca2+ entry in response to Ca2+ depletion from intracellular stores (22Beech D.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2005; 451: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In this context, recent studies demonstrating that the activity of TRPC1 is positively regulated by PKCα and negatively by CaM binding are highly relevant (39Ahmmed G.U. Mehta D. Vogel S. Holinstat M. Paria B.C. Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20941-20949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 40Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that PKCα-mediated TRPC1 activation could enhance the upward phase of the [Ca2+]i spike whereas Ca2+-activated CaM binding mediates the downward phase of each spike. Accordingly, we examined whether PKC and CaM were involved in the production of transient [Ca2+]i oscillations by the CaR. In agreement with our hypothesis, intracellular Ca2+ imaging revealed that the preferential PKCα inhibitors Ro-31-7549 and Ro-32-0432 (41Wilkinson S.E. Parker P.J. Nixon J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) abolished Ca2+ signaling elicited by l-Phe stimulation of the CaR (Fig. 4, B and C). Because the IC50 of these compounds for the PKCs is not sufficient to unambiguously distinguish between the different isoforms (42Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar), we used siRNA-mediated knock down to define the role of PKCα in CaR-mediated [Ca2+]i oscillations. HEK-CaR cells were transfected with a pool of PKCα or PKCβ1 siRNA and the changes in [Ca2+]i after l-Phe stimulation examined in single cells. As we previously demonstrated (see Fig. 2C), non-targeted siRNA did not affect the production of transient [Ca2+]i oscillations (Fig. 4D). However, these oscillations were inhibited by the siRNA targeting PKCα (Fig. 4E) but not PKCβ1 (Fig. 4F). This inhibition was dose dependent (Fig. 4G) and concurrent with a marked reduction of PKCα expression. To examine the role of CaM in the production of transient [Ca2+]i oscillations, HEK-CaR cells were exposed to the CaM antagonists W7 (43Hidaka H. Sasaki Y. Tanaka T. Endo T. Ohno S. Fujii Y. Nagata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4354-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and W-13 (44Tanaka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11078-11080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These agents did not prevent the rise in [Ca2+]i elicited by l-Phe stimulation of the CaR but impaired the downward phase of the transient [Ca2+]i oscillation, resulting in a sustained, non-oscillatory [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 5, B and C). To independently corroborate these results, we interfered with the function of endogenous CaM by expressing a DN-CaM form of this protein that has an alanine substitution in each of the four Ca2+-binding sites (D20A, D56A, D93A, D129A) (30Gamper N. Shapiro M.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Transfection of HEK-CaR cells with a vector encoding wild-type CaM did not had any effect in the transient [Ca2+]i oscillations mediated by l-Phe (Fig. 5D). In contrast, expression of the DN-CaM impaired the downward phase of the transient [Ca2+]i oscillation in a similar fashion as we observed with the CaM antagonists (Fig. 5E). Concluding Remarks—Based on the results presented here, as well as in our previous studies (18Rey O. Young S.H. Yuan J. Slice L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22875-22882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Young S.H. Wu S.V. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46871-46876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a model can be proposed to explain the mechanisms by which the CaR can function in two different modes, triggering high frequency sinusoidal oscillations in response to an increase in [Ca2+]o or low frequency transient oscillations in response to aromatic amino acids in the presence of a threshold [Ca2+]o (Fig. 6). In this model, the activation of the CaR by an elevation in [Ca2+]o leads to phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate to produce two second messengers, Ins(1,4,5)P3 and diacylglycerol. Ins(1,4,5)P3 binds to its intracellular receptor, a ligand-gated Ca2+ channel located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and triggers the release of Ca2+ from internal stores. The rise in the concentration of free intracellular Ca2+ and diacylglycerol activates PKC. Activated PKC then phosphorylates the CaR, at Thr-888, providing the negative feedback needed to cause sinusoidal [Ca2+]i oscillations. The binding of aromatic amino acids to a topographically distinct site from the Ca2+ binding region (12Mun H.C. Culverston E.L. Franks A.H. Collyer C.A. Clifton-Bligh R.J. Conigrave A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29067-29072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) in the extracellular domain of the CaR engages, through its cytoplasmic tail, a multiprotein complex that includes Rho, filamin-A, and TRPC1. This interaction leads to TRPC1 channel opening and extracellular Ca2+ entry, which is further stimulated by PKCα. In this regard, we previously reported that l-Phe stimulation of HEK-CaR promoted oscillatory translocations of PKCα from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (18Rey O. Young S.H. Yuan J. Slice L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22875-22882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent reports indicate that the binding of Ca2+ to the C2 domain of PKCα not only leads to membrane translocation but also promotes a conformational change that enables phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate to access a lysine-rich cluster located in a separated region of the C2 domain and activate the enzyme (45Corbalan-Garcia S.

Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Corbalan-Garcia S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2848-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the membrane-associated state of PKCα is active, as suggested by our model. As [Ca2+]i increases, activated (i.e. Ca2+ bound) CaM binds the C terminus of TRPC1 and inhibits its activity initiating the downward phase of the spike, a function impaired by CaM antagonists and the DN-CaM. The capacity of the CaR to couple to Gαq/phospholipase C (18Rey O. Young S.H. Yuan J. Slice L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22875-22882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or to TRPC1, as proposed in Fig. 6, provides a plausible explanation for the remarkable ability of this receptor to mediate sinusoidal and transient patterns of [Ca2+]i oscillations in response to different agonists, i.e. Ca2+ and aromatic amino acids. In conclusion, our studies identify a novel function of TRPC1, namely as a component of a functional signaling complex formed in the presence of the CaR that mediates transient [Ca2+]i oscillations in response to aromatic amino acids. In addition to the CaR, the members of the C family of G protein-coupled receptors include the metabotropic glutamate receptors, γ-aminobutyric acid receptors, V2R pheromone receptors, and the taste receptors of the T1R subfamily. In view of the structural and functional similarities of the members of this important receptor family, it will be of interest to determine whether TRPC1 or other members of the TRPC family play a role in the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations initiated by activation of these receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2101297848,"The retinoblastoma (pRB) family proteins regulate the E2F transcription factors; their complexes regulate critical transitions through the cell cycle. The function of these pRB family/E2F complexes, which includes p130/E2F4, in response to genotoxic agents, is not well understood. We investigated the role of E2F4 in the genotoxic stress response. Following radiation treatment, E2F4 colocalized with p130 in the nucleus during a radiation-induced stable G2-phase arrest. Arrested cells had significantly decreased expression of Cyclins A2 and B1 and decreased phosphorylation of mitotic protein monoclonal-2 (MPM-2) mitotic proteins. Small interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of E2F4 sensitized cells to subsequent irradiation, resulting in enhanced cellular DNA damage and cell death, as determined by caspase activation and decreased clonogenic cell survival. Downstream E2F4 targets potentially involved in the progression from G2 into M phase were identified by oligonucleotide microarray expression profiling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation localized E2F4 at promoter regions of the Bub3 and Pttg1 mitotic genes following irradiation, which were among the downregulated genes identified by the microarray. These data suggest that in response to radiation, E2F4 becomes active in the nucleus, enforces a stable G2 arrest by target gene repression, and thus provides increased cell survival ability by minimizing propagation of cells that have irreparable DNA damage."

Immunol. 1994; 152: 3254-3263PubMed Google Scholar), only recently is the underlying mechanism beginning to emerge. mTECs express a broad spectrum of peripheral tissue-restricted self-antigens, termed promiscuous gene expression (5Derbinski J.

Kyewski B. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Evidence for a crucial role of this promiscuous gene expression in self-tolerance induction comes from analysis of mice lacking Aire, a transcription factor that is mutated in the human disease autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) (7The Finnish-German APECED ConsortiumNat.

The development of mTECs is accompanied by an increase in the expression levels of CD80 and a carbohydrate epitope that binds the lectin UEA-1 (10Farr A.G. Anderson S.K. J.

Both UEA-1- and UEA-1+ mTECs display promiscuous gene expression (5Derbinski J. Schulte A. Kyewski B. Klein L. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). However, a more recent study shows a close correlation between the expression levels of CD80 and the extent of promiscuous gene expression (6Derbinski J. Gabler J. Brors B. Tierling S. Jonnakuty S.

The genes and signaling pathways that regulate the development of mTECs are not fully understood.NF-κB2 is a member of the NF-κB family of transcription factors that also include p105/p50 (NF-κB1), RelA (p65), RelB, and c-Rel. The full-length NF-κB2 protein p100 is preferentially associated with RelB in the cytoplasm (13Solan N.J. Miyoshi H. Carmona E.M. Bren G.D. Paya C.V. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of the C terminus of p100 by IKKα, which itself is activated by NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), leads to proteolytic processing of p100 into p52 (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol.

This alternative NF-κB signaling pathway is activated by engagement of receptors for B cell-activating factor, LTβ, and CD40 ligand (14Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G. Huhse B. Belich M. Janzen J.

Previous studies with NF-κB2-/- mice demonstrate a crucial role of NF-κB2 in B cell development and secondary lymphoid organogenesis. These mice present a marked decrease in the B cell population in peripheral lymphoid organs and the absence of discrete perifollicular marginal and mantle zones and of germinal centers in the spleen (20Caamano J.H.

Mice deficient in LTβR, IKKα, or carrying a loss-of-function mutant of NIK (NIKaly/aly) all display disorganized thymic medulla, reduced numbers of mTECs, and overt autoimmunity (22Boehm T. Scheu S.

As the LTβR signaling pathway is intimately involved in activation of NF-κB2 (25Dixit V. Mak T.W.

Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, defects in LTβR signaling not only impair processing of NF-κB2 p100 into p52 but also result in accumulation of p100, which may lead to repression of RelB-dependent transcription. In fact, it was recently suggested that it is the increase in the p100 levels, rather than the absence of p52, that might be responsible for the impaired mTEC development observed in IKKα-deficient and NIKaly/aly mice (24Kinoshita D. Hirota F. Kaisho T. Kasai M. Izumi K. Bando Y. Mouri Y. Matsushima A. Niki S. Han H. Oshikawa K. Kuroda N. Maegawa M. Irahara M. Takeda K. Akira S. Matsumoto M. J.

NOD.SCID/NCr mice were purchased from the NCI, National Institutes of Health, at Frederick. All of the animals were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the animal facility of the Medical University of Ohio, and all of the animal procedures were pre-approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Histology and Immunohistochemistry—Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin blocks, sectioned at 5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histological examination of silver-stained lung sections for possible Pneumocystis infection was conducted by the Research Animal Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Missouri. For immunohistochemistry, the paraffin was removed and sections were rehydrated according to standard procedures. For retrieval of B220 and CD3 antigen, the sections were subjected to boiling in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) for 10 min, respectively. Following quenching of endogenous peroxidase activity with H2O2 and blocking with normal serum, the sections were incubated for 1 h with rat mAb against CD45R/B220 (5 μg/ml, RA3-6B2; BD Biosciences) or CD3 (10 μg/ml, CD3-12; Serotec). Isotype-matched rat mAb (10 μg/ml; BD Biosciences) was used as control. After washing, biotinylated rabbit anti-rat antibody (Vector Laboratories) was applied for 30 min. The sections were then incubated for 30 min with ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories), and the immunostaining was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma). The tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and examined under a light microscope.Immunofluorescence—Thymi from 4- to 6-week-old NF-κB2-/- and wild-type mice were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura) and snap frozen. Sections at 5 μm were cut from the frozen blocks, fixed in cold acetone, rehydrated in PBS plus 0.1% saponin (Sigma), and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% goat serum in PBS. The sections were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse Aire polyclonal antibody (27Heino M. Peterson P. Sillanpaa N. Guerin S. Wu L. Anderson G. Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N.

After washing with PBS, the sections were incubated with FITC goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Molecular Probes), FITC mouse anti-hamster IgG (1:200), and biotin mouse anti-rat IgG2a (1:100) for 1 h at room temperature. The biotin-conjugated antibodies were detected with PE-streptavidin (Southern Biotechnology Associates). For direct immunofluorescence staining, sections were incubated with FITC rat anti-mouse B220 mAb (RA3-6B2, 1:1000) or PE rat anti-mouse IgM mAb (R6-60.2, 1:200). Unless indicated, all antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (300 nm; Molecular Probes) was used for counterstaining of nuclei. For detection of immune complexes in renal glomeruli, cryostat sections of kidney were fixed in cold acetone for 15 min, rehydrated in PBS, and blocked with 10% goat serum/3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. The sections were then incubated with FITC goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500; Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. To detect autoantibodies, cryostat sections of various organs from 8-week-old NOD.SCID/NCr mice were fixed in cold methanol for 5 min, blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with 1:40 dilutions of the serum from individual 1-year-old NF-κB2-/- and wild-type littermates. The sections were then incubated with FITC goat anti-mouse IgM (1:200; Southern Biotechnology Associates) for 1 h. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole was used for counterstaining of nuclei as described above. Fluorescent images were taken on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope.Real-time PCR—Real-time PCR quantification was conducted with cDNA prepared from total RNA extracted from individual thymi of 4-week-old NF-κB2-/- and wild-type mice. The primers and probes for Aire, Spt1, fatty acid-binding protein, glutamic acid decarboxylase 67, and glyceraldehyde phosphodehydrogenase were as previously described (28Chin R.K. Lo J.C. Kim O.

PCR reactions in triplicate were performed using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and run on an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR system according to the manufacturer's instruction.In Vivo Anti-CD3 Antibody-induced Apoptosis—NF-κB2-/- and wild-type control mice (4-6 weeks) were injected intraperitoneally with 20 μg of hamster anti-mouse CD3ϵ mAb (145-2C11; BD Biosciences) or, as control, with PBS. Mice were sacrificed 40 h later. Thymocytes were collected and counted, and cell subset distribution was determined by flow cytometry (Epics Elite; Beckman-Coulter) after staining with FITC rat anti-mouse CD4 (GK1.5) and PE rat anti-mouse CD8 (53-6.7, both from BD Biosciences).Analysis of Lung-infiltrating Cells—The infiltrating cells were isolated as described (28Chin R.K. Lo J.C. Kim O. Blink S.E. Christiansen P.A. Peterson P. Wang Y. Ware C. Fu Y.X. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Briefly, lung tissues were finely minced and digested for 30 min in 15 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 1 mg/ml collagenase VIII (Sigma) and 2% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Cell suspensions were passed through a 100-μm Nitex filter, and red blood cells were depleted with ACK lysis buffer (150 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm KHCO3, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.3). The cells were stained with PE rat anti-mouse CD4 (RM4-5), PE rat anti-mouse CD8, FITC rat anti-mouse CD44 (IM7), FITC hamster anti-mouse CD69 (H1.2F3, all from BD Biosciences) and then analyzed by flow cytometry.Analysis of Thymic Stromal Cells—Thymic stromal cells were prepared as described (30Klein L. Klugmann M. Nave K.A. Tuohy V.K. Kyewski B. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 31Muller S.M. Terszowski G. Blum C. Haller C. Anquez V. Kuschert S. Carmeliet P. Augustin H.G. Rodewald H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10587-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, thymi of 4- to 6-week-old mice were minced and slowly stirred in the medium (RPMI 1640 plus 2% fetal bovine serum) to release the majority of thymocytes. The tissue fragments were sequentially digested with 0.5 mg/ml collagenase D (Roche Applied Science) and collagenase D/dispase I (0.2 mg/ml each; Roche Applied Science) in the presence of 25 μg/ml DNase I (Worthington) in the same medium to release epithelial cells. The digests were pooled, disrupted by 5 mm EDTA, and separated on a discontinuous Percoll gradient (Pharmacia) with densities of ρ = 1.115, 1.06, and 1.0 g/ml (from bottom to top) by centrifugation at 1,350 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The thymic epithelial cell fraction was collected from the interphase between ρ = 1.06 and 1.0 and subjected to three-step staining with Mouse BD Fc Block (2.4G2), with rat anti-mouse Ep-CAM (G8.8) and Biotin-UEA-1 or Biotin-CD80 (16-10A1), and then with PE Cy5-conjugated CD45 (30-F11), PE-conjugated Ly51 (BP-1), FITC-conjugated mouse anti-rat IgG2a (RG7/1.30), and PE Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin (all from BD Biosciences). Cells were sorted on Epics Elite (Beckman-Coulter) with appropriate forward and side scatter setting to exclude thymocytes, and the data were analyzed with WinMDI 2.8 software.Analysis of Regulatory T Cells—Single cell suspensions were prepared from the spleen of 4- to 6-week-old mice according to standard procedures. Red blood cells were depleted as described above. Regulatory T cells were detected by staining for the expression of CD4, CD25, and Foxp3, using a mouse regulatory T cell-staining kit (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSMultiorgan Lymphocytic Infiltration in NF-κB2-/- Mice—During a study of apoptosis regulation in thymocytes and T cells by NF-κB2 p100 and its processed product p52, we noticed that a significant number of NF-κB2-/- mice died prematurely when compared with their heterozygous and wild-type littermates (Fig. 1A). Histological examination of various tissue samples revealed that, of the 20 deceased NF-κB2-/- mice, 5 had leukemia or lymphoma, indicated by complete effacement of normal bone marrow and spleen architecture by massive infiltration of medium-sized lymphocytes with pleomorphic nuclei and abundant cytoplasm (data not shown). However, the remaining 15 deceased NF-κB2-/- mice showed no obvious sign of leukemia in their bone marrow and spleen samples. Instead, these mice had extensive perivascular infiltration of morphologically normal lymphocytes in multiple organs (data not shown, see also Fig. 1B). The cellular infiltrates might result in organ dysfunction, leading to premature death.We next examined 20 NF-κB2-/- mice at 10-12 months of age to determine whether the multiorgan lymphocytic infiltration observed in the deceased mice was a consistent feature in NF-κB2-/- mice. All of the NF-κB2-/- mice showed marked lymphocytic infiltration in the lung, liver, and salivary gland (Fig. 1B). Of note, many of the lung lesions appeared to have lymphocytic invasion of artery walls, consistent with vasculitis (Fig. 1B). Immunohistochemical staining of lung sections revealed that most of the infiltrating cells were CD3+ T cells (Fig. 1C). No significant lymphocytic infiltration was found in major organs of the 15 age-matched wild-type littermates examined (Fig. 1B). This phenotype of multiorgan lymphocytic infiltration in NF-κB2-/- mice is very similar to that described for various mouse strains with autoimmunity, such as those lacking Aire, LTβR, IKKα, or with NIK mutation (9Anderson M.S. Venanzi E.S. Klein L. Chen Z. Berzins S.P. von Turley S.J. Boehmer H. Bronson R. Dierich A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Science. 2002; 298: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar, 22Boehm T.

Med. 1998; 187: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that the multiorgan infiltration might represent responses to chronic infection by opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis carinii. Histological examination of silver-stained sections of the lungs from 1-year-old wild-type (n = 2) and NF-κB2-/- (n = 3) mice revealed no indication of Pneumocystis infection (data not shown).Compared with wild-type and heterozygous littermates, NF-κB2-/- mice have significantly fewer and smaller lymph nodes, probably due to a defect in lymph node development. 4B. Zhang and H.-F. Ding, unpublished data. Thus, the observed multiorgan lymphocytic infiltration could be a result of homeostatic reorganization. To investigate this possibility, we isolated infiltrating cells from the lungs and performed flow cytometry analysis for expression of T cell activation and memory phenotype markers (Fig. 1D). The majority of the infiltrating cells in the lungs of NF-κB2-/- mice were CD4+ T cells. Staining for the activation marker CD69 revealed an average 25-fold increase in the percentage of activated CD4+ cells in the lungs of NF-κB2-/- mice. The percentage of the CD4+ cells with the CD44+ memory phenotype was increased by an average of 4-fold. These data indicate that the lymphocytic infiltration in the organs of NF-κB2-/- mice was a result of an active ongoing immune response rather than a passive homeostatic process.Autoimmune Diseases in NF-κB2-/- Mice—Given the apparent autoimmune phenotype of NF-κB2-/- mice, we further examined these mice for signs of autoimmune disease. Of the deceased NF-κB2-/- mice (n = 20), 55% showed pathological evidence of glomerulopathy, including mesangial proliferation, crescent formation, and diffuse interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates (Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescence staining of cryostat-sectioned renal tissues using anti-IgG revealed deposits of immune complexes with a granular pattern in both the mesangial matrix and capillary loops (Fig. 2B), suggesting that these mice had immune complex glomerulonephritis. We also examined 20 NF-κB2-/- mice at 10-12 months of age and found 30% of them had immune complex glomerulonephritis. None of the 15 age-matched or the two deceased wild-type littermates showed any pathological features of autoimmune renal disease.FIGURE 2Autoimmune diseases in NF-κB2-/- mice. A, hematoxylin and eosin staining of formalin-fixed renal sections of deceased NF-κB2-/- and wild-type mice. The renal cortex of the NF-κB2-/- mouse shows mesangial proliferation, crescent formation, and diffuse interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates. B, the presence of IgG-containing immune complexes in glomeruli of the same NF-κB2-/- mouse, revealed by staining cryostat renal sections with FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG. C, NF-κB2-/- mice have autoantibodies to multiple organs, revealed by FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgM staining of NOD.SCID mouse tissue sections of liver, lung, salivary gland, and pancreas preincubated with serum from individual 1-year-old NF-κB2-/- or wild-type mice.

Scale bars, 100 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been shown previously that, despite a marked reduction in the peripheral B cell population and impaired B cell-mediated immune response, NF-κB2-/- mice had a significant increase (4.5-fold) in the levels of serum IgM in comparison with control wild-type littermates (20Caamano J.H. Rizzo C.A. Durham S.K. Barton D.S. Raventos-Suarez C. Snapper C.M. Bravo R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of NOD. SCID mouse tissues with sera from 1-year-old NF-κB2-/- mice (n = 6) revealed the presence of high levels of IgM autoantibodies against multiple organs, including the liver, lung, salivary gland, and pancreas (Fig. 2C). We also detected high levels of antibodies against double-stranded DNA in two of the six serum samples from NF-κB2-/- mice but not in any of the six serum samples from age-matched wild-type littermates (data not shown). Together with the results of kidney histopathological analyses, these findings indicate that NF-κB2-/- mice developed systemic autoimmune disease, a phenotype consistent with a broad defect in self-tolerance induction.NF-κB2 Deficiency Has No Significant Effect on Activation-induced Thymocyte Apoptosis and the Number of Aire-expressing Cells in the Thymus—Self-tolerance is maintained by multiple mechanisms such as expression and presentation of self-antigens in the thymus, induction of apoptosis during negative selection, and production of regulatory T cells (32Hogquist K.A. Baldwin T.A. Jameson S.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 772-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Defects in any one of these mechanisms could lead to autoimmunity. As NF-κB2 regulates death receptor-mediated apoptosis (33Wang Y. Cui H. Schroering A. Ding J.L. Lane W.S. McGill G. Fisher D.E. Ding H.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 888-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which has been shown to play a role in negative selection (34Lamhamedi-Cherradi S.E. Zheng S.J. Maguschak K.A. Peschon J. Chen Y.H. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), we examined NF-κB2-/- mice for the ability of anti-CD3 antibody to induce apoptosis in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, a widely used model of negative selection (35Shi Y.F. Bissonnette R.P. Parfrey N. Szalay M. Kubo R.T. Green D.R. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3340-3346PubMed Google Scholar). No significant difference was observed in the levels of thymocyte death between NF-κB2-/- mice and their age-matched wild-type littermates after injection of anti-CD3 antibody (Fig. 3A). We also performed in vitro assays of anti-CD3-induced apoptosis of thymocytes and obtained similar results (data not shown). Thus, NF-κB2 deficiency has no apparent effect on the ability of thymocytes to undergo apoptosis induced by T cell receptor ligation, at least in the model systems examined.FIGURE 3Effects of NF-κB2 deficiency on activation-induced thymocyte apoptosis and Aire expression. A, in vivo anti-CD3-induced apoptosis in CD4+CD8+ immature thymocytes in 4- to 6-week-old NF-κB2-/- and wild-type mice.

https://openalex.org/W2082400500,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression and activation is critical in the initiation and progression of cancers, especially those of epithelial origin. EGFR activation is associated with the induction of divergent signal transduction pathways and a gamut of cellular processes; however, the cell-type and tissue-type specificity conferred by certain pathways remains to be elucidated. In the context of the esophageal epithelium, a prototype stratified squamous epithelium, EGFR overexpression is relevant in the earliest events of carcinogenesis as modeled in a three-dimensional organotypic culture system. We demonstrate that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway, and not the MEK/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway, is preferentially activated in EGFR-mediated esophageal epithelial hyperplasia, a premalignant lesion. The hyperplasia was abolished with direct inhibition of PI3K and of AKT but not with inhibition of the MAPK pathway. With the introduction of an inducible AKT vector in both primary and immortalized esophageal epithelial cells, we find that AKT overexpression and activation is permissive for complete epithelial formation in organotypic culture, but imposes a growth constraint in cells grown in monolayer. In organotypic culture, AKT mediates changes related to cell shape and size with an expansion of the differentiated compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1985188456,"Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are ubiquitous plant lipid-binding proteins that have been associated with multiple developmental and stress responses. Although LTPs typically bind fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives in a non-covalent way, studies on the LTPs of barley seeds have identified an abundantly occurring covalently modified form, LTP1b, the lipid ligand of which has resisted clarification. In the present study, this adduct was identified as the α-ketol 9-hydroxy-10-oxo-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid. Further studies on the formation of LTP1b demonstrated that the ligand was introduced by nucleophilic attack of the free carboxylate group of the Asp-7 residue of the protein at carbon-9 of the allene oxide fatty acid 9(S),10-epoxy-10,12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid. This reactive oxylipin was produced in barley seeds by oxygenation of linoleic acid by 9-lipoxygenase followed by dehydration of the resulting hydroperoxide by allene oxide synthase.

They form a multigenic family composed by two subfamilies, LTP1 and LTP2, whose members have molecular masses around 9,000 and 7,000, respectively. LTP1 and LTP2 display low or no sequence identities except for a common motif of 8 cysteines forming four disulfide bonds, which is now considered as the LTP signature. This signature is related to an α-helical fold in which a large hydrophobic tunnel or cavity allows the binding of different types of lipids and hydrophobic molecules (1Douliez J.P. Michon T. Marion D. J. Cereal Sci. 2000; 32: 1-20Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 2Marion D. Douliez J.-P. Gautier M.-F. Elmorjani K. Mills E.N.C. Shewry P.R. Plant Food Allergens. Blackwell Science, Oxford, UK2004: 57-69Google Scholar). LTPs have been associated with a multitude of developmental and stress responses, and their precise function is still unknown. Concerning plant development, it has been suggested that LTPs are involved in the mobilization of seed storage lipids (3Edqvist J. Farbos I. Planta. 2002; 215: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), in the formation of cuticles (4Sterk P. Booij H. Schellekens G.A. Van Kammen A. De Vries S.C.

Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 2009-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Concerning plant defense against biotic and abiotic stress, it has been shown that LTPs are associated with cold and wounding stress (10Yubero-Serrano E.M. Moyano E. Medina-Escobar N. Munoz-Blanco J.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and can inhibit fungal growth in vitro (13Garcia-Olmedo F. Molina A. Alamillo J.M. Rodriguez-Palenzuela P. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 14Broekaert W.F. Cammue B.P.A. DeBolle M.F.C. Thevissen K. DeSamblanx G.W. Osborn R.W. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1997; 16: 297-323Crossref Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that LTPs and oomycetous elicitins compete for a plasma membrane receptor involved in the hypersensitive response and systemic acquired resistance (15Blein J.P. Coutos-Thevenot P. Marion D. Ponchet M. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 293-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 16Buhot N. Douliez J.P. Jacquemard A. Marion D. Tran V. Maume B.F. Milat M.L. Ponchet M. Mikes V. Kader J.C. Blein J.P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Besides, the observation that a mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana affected in an LTP2 gene was unable to develop systemic acquired resistance (17Maldonado A.M. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C.J. Cameron R.K. Nature. 2002; 419: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) suggests that, in planta, LTPs are probably involved in the signaling of plant defense mechanisms rather than in a direct inhibitory activity on microbial pathogens. Most of the putative functions of LTPs are related to their capabilities of binding lipids and other hydrophobic molecules. For example, it has been recently shown that LTPs can induce plant protection when they are loaded with jasmonic acid (but not with linolenic acid) (18Buhot N. Gomes E. Milat M.L. Ponchet M. Marion D. Lequeu J. Delrot S. Coutos-Thevenot P. Blein J.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5047-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and that the cell wall-loosening effect of LTP is modulated by lipid binding (9Nieuwland J. Feron R. Huisman B.A. Fasolino A. Hilbers C.W. Derksen J. Mariani C. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 2009-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although LTPs typically bind lipids in a non-covalent way, we have previously found that an adduct is covalently bound to wheat LTP1 (19Douliez J.P. Jegou S. Pato C. Larre C. Molle D. Marion D. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The adduct with a molecular mass of about 294 Da has been also found in barley LTP1, where a structure has been proposed from NMR and mass spectrometry analysis. It was suggested that the adduct corresponds to a new post-translational modification (20Lindorff-Larsen K. Lerche M.H. Poulsen F.M. Roepstorff P. Winther J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33547-33553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The proposed structure was an oxygenated fatty acid derivative with an odd number of carbon atoms (C17) that does not fit with current fatty acid pathways described in plants. The history of allene oxide synthase (AOS) goes back to 1966, in which year Zimmerman reported the formation of the α-ketol fatty acid 13-hydroxy-12-oxo-9-octadecenoic acid from linoleic acid in a preparation of flaxseed (21Zimmerman D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 23: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Sequential actions of lipoxygenase (LOX) and a new enzyme termed “hydroperoxide isomerase” were implicated in this conversion. The reaction mechanism of hydroperoxide isomerase was studied by Hamberg (22Hamberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 920: 76-84Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that the true products are unstable allene oxides, which undergo spontaneous hydrolysis to provide the α-ketols isolated in the earlier studies. In subsequent studies, Brash et al. (23Brash A.R. Baertschi S.W. Ingram C.D. Harris T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3382-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) isolated the methyl esters of two allene oxides and additionally characterized and cloned the hydroperoxide isomerase (24Song W.C. Brash A.R. Science. 1991; 253: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 25Song W.C. Funk C.D. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8519-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This turned out to be a cytochrome P-450 protein related to mammalian thromboxane and prostacyclin synthases and was renamed allene oxide synthase. AOS is widely distributed in higher plants, and a catalytically distinct form related to catalases is present in coral (for reviews, see Refs. 26Tijet N. Brash A.R. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar and 27Feussner I. Wasternack C. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). The primary function of AOS in higher plants is to provide the linolenic acid-derived allene oxide that, in the presence of allene oxide cyclase (28Hamberg M. Fahlstadius P. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 518-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), undergoes cyclization into 12-oxo-10,15-phytodienoic acid. This cyclopentenone serves as the precursor of the jasmonate subfamily of oxylipins (29Vick B.A. Zimmerman D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The present study is concerned with the structure and mode of formation of the covalently modified LTP1. We report that LTP1 traps an allene oxide formed from linoleic acid by sequential action of 9-LOX and AOS. Chemicals—Linoleic acid, [13C]linoleic acid, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) were obtained from Sigma. The oxylipins used including the furane fatty acid 10,13-epoxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid and the α-ketol 9-hydroxy-10-oxo-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid were purchased from Larodan Fine Chemicals, Malmö, Sweden. Maize AOSs were prepared as described previously (28Hamberg M. Fahlstadius P. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 518-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Plant Material—Barley seeds (Hordeum vulgare cv. Scarlett) were provided by Malteurop (Reims, France). Embryos were dissected from dry barley seeds and grounded with liquid nitrogen. For studies on germination, mature barley seeds were sterilized in a solution of sodium hypochloride as described previously (30Dubreil L. Gaborit T. Bouchet B. Gallant D.J. Broekaert W.F. Quillien L. Marion D. Plant Sci. 1998; 138: 121-135Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and were allowed to germinate in the dark at 25 °C on moist paper, and about 40 seedlings were collected daily, transferred in liquid nitrogen, and freeze-dried before LTP extraction. To avoid any artifactual LTP adduction during the extraction process, NDGA was added in the extraction buffer. Purification of Barley LTP1 and LTP1b—LTP1 and LTP1b were extracted as described previously (31Charvolin D. Douliez J.P. Marion D. Cohen-Addad C. Pebay-Peyroula E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The purity of LTPs was checked by SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass ionization spectrometry analyses (ESI-MS), as detailed in a previous work (32Elmorjani K. Lurquin V. Lelion A. Rogniaux H. Marion D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To isolate the non-adducted LTP1, the corresponding barley powder was defatted successively with CH2Cl2-CH3OH 2:1 (v/v) and pure CH2Cl2. After filtration, the defatted barley powder was dried under vacuum for 12 h before extraction. Cleavage and Chemical Modifications of the Lipid-like Adducts—The adduct-protein bond was cleaved by transesterification of LTP1b, the adducted LTP1 with boron trifluoride (BF3), in methanol (33Sattler W. Puhl H. Hayn M. Kostner G.M. Esterbauer H. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The released methyl ester was extracted with CH2Cl2. The organic phase was thoroughly washed with water and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. After filtration, CH2Cl2 was evaporated under a nitrogen stream. The methyl esters were silylated by adding 100 μl of N,O-bis (trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (1% trimethylchlorosilane) (Sigma), and the reaction proceeded for 30 min at 70 °C. LTP1b was also submitted either to methoxyamine derivatization (Pierce), as indicated by the supplier, or to NaBH4 reduction in methanol on ice for 15 min. For NaBH4 reduction and methoxyamine derivatization, jasmone (Sigma) and 13-oxo-9,11-octadecadienoic acid (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) were used as positive controls. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry—Derivatized extracts were separated and identified on an HP-5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a DB5-MS column (30 m × 0.32 mm, film thickness 0.25 um) and coupled to an HP-5971A mass detector. The oven temperature was programmed at 100 °C (1 min) and then increased 20 °C min–1 to 230 °C (1 min), 5 °C min–1 to 280 °C (0 min), and finally, to 20 °C · min–1 to 310 °C. Electron impact ionization was operated at 70 eV. High resolution mass spectrometry was performed with an SX 102 mass spectrometer (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan) coupled to an HP-5890A gas chromatograph (Agilent, Massy, France), and a MDN5S (Supelco, Lyon, France) column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) was used with helium as carrier gas. The column temperature program was: 100 °C (1 min) and then increased 20 °C · min–1 to 230 °C (1 min), 5 °C min–1 to 280 °C (0 min), and finally, to 20 °C · min–1 to 310 °C. Electron impact ionization was operated at 70 eV. The source was held at 250 °C. High resolution (R > 10,000) selected ion monitoring was used as an acquisition technique using perfluorokerosene for mass calibration and lock mass. NMR Characterizations—NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX 400 spectrometer operating at a carbon frequency of 100.62 MHz. The chemical shifts of the carbon were calibrated from internal trimethylsilyl propionic acid with methyl assigned at 0 ppm. The NMR experiments were realized using a single pulse detection of carbon with power-gated 1H decoupling. The 90° carbon pulse was set to 11.25 μs, micro second and a proton decoupling (WALTZ16) of 3 kHz was applied during acquisition (1.25 s) but also during the recycle delay (5 s) to gain signal by nuclear Overhauser enhancement (34Kuhlmann K.F.

Tryptic Digestion of LTP1b—1 mg of adducted LTP1 was reduced with 15 mg of Tris 2-carboxyethylphosphine in a 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 5) with 6 m guanidine HCl for 30 min at 30 °C and then alkylated by adding 15 mg of N-ethylmaleimide at room temperature for 1 h. The protein was purified by HPLC as described above and checked by mass spectrometry. 0.1 mg of reduced and alkylated LTP1b was subjected to trypsin digestion (20:1 by weight) in a 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7) for 15 min at 37 °C. The tryptic fragments were first analyzed by MALDI-MS on a [email protected] instrument (Micromass/Waters, Manchester, UK) equipped with a laser at 337 nm. The peptide mixture was mixed with the matrix preparation (1:1, v/v), consisting of α-cyano-4, hydroxycinnamic acid and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, both dissolved at 5 mg/ml in acetonitrile containing 30% 15 mm NH4H2PO4 and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The tryptic fragments of adducted LTP were further measured by tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). Measurements were performed with a hybrid quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF Global, Micromass/Waters, Manchester, UK) equipped with an ESI source. The peptide mixtures were diluted in water and acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) acidified with 0.1% formic acid (1 nmol · ml–1) and were infused at a continuous flow rate of 2 μl · min–1. Production of Specific Monoclonal Antibody against Adducted LTP1—BALB/c mice received four injections of purified adducted LTP1 emulsified with complete or incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Hybridoma were produced as described by Kohler and Milstein (35Kohler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12724) Google Scholar) and were screened for the presence of antibodies against adducted LTP1 or LTP1 by indirect ELISA. We chose an antibody, named anti-LTP1b, which shares a strong reactivity for the adducted protein, whereas it did not recognize the non-adducted LTP1. Screening of Hybridoma Supernatant—Microtiter plates (NUNC, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated and left overnight at 4 °C with 500 ng/well of adducted LTP1 or LTP1 in 10 mm carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH = 9.6). Uncoated sites were blocked with 4% defatted skimmed milk in phosphate-buffered saline. Hybridoma supernatants were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washes, bound antibodies were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase anti-mouse IgG (170-6516, Bio-Rad; 1/3000 dilution) and orthophenylenediamine as substrate. Determination of Adducted LTP1 Content by Sequential Competitive ELISA—LTP1 was extracted by a gentle stirring of 1 g of barley powder for 1 h at 25°C with 10 ml of water. After centrifugation, 50 μl of supernatant was submitted to ELISA analysis for the quantification of adducted LTP1. Microtiter plates were coated with adducted LTP1 and saturated as described above. Anti-LTP1b antibody at appropriate dilution was preincubated with adducted LTP1 (0.5–20 μg/ml) or with diluted barley extracts for 2 h at 37°C. Samples where added to the microtiter plate and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washes, the remaining antibodies were detected as described for indirect ELISA. Absorbance of the standards was plotted versus concentrations and fitted with log-logit regression. Competitive assay allows a dose-response detection of adducted LTP1 between 0.3 and 5 μg/ml, and no inhibition was observed with non-adducted LTP1 as competitor. Preliminary Characterization of LTP1s from Barley Powders—LTP1b was isolated as described previously (19Douliez J.P. Jegou S. Pato C. Larre C. Molle D. Marion D. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In agreement with the presence of a covalently bound lipid adduct, defatting the material with CH2Cl2-CH3OH did not remove the adduct (data not shown). Extraction and purification (19Douliez J.P. Jegou S. Pato C. Larre C. Molle D. Marion D. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) of LTP1s (adducted and non-adducted) starting with defatted or non-defatted barley powders gave about the same yield of materials, i.e. 65 and 70 mg, respectively, from 100 g of barley powder. Almost all LTP1 was adducted when the protein was extracted from non-defatted barley powder. On the contrary, defatted barley powder yielded only non-adducted LTP1, as shown by ELISA (Table 1) and confirmed by mass spectrometry analyses. Requirement of embryo for the formation of adducted LTP1 was highlighted by comparing the adducted LTP1 contents in soluble protein extracts from three sources, i.e. de-embryonated, embryo, and whole barley seed powders (Table 1). Importantly, no adducted LTP1 was revealed by ELISA in the absence of embryo. As a control, adducted LTP1s could not be detected in an aqueous embryo extract. In another experiment, the embryo powder was re-added to the de-embryonated barley powder, a procedure that allowed the recovery of adducted protein. Therefore, barley embryo and lipids were required for the formation of adducted LTP1.TABLE 1Formation of modified LTP1 on different barley seed fractionSubstrateAdducted barley LTP1mg/gWF1.67 ± 0.16DFNDEFNDDF + EF1.76 ± 0.09 Open table in a new tab Linoleic Acid Is a Precursor of the Lipid-like Adduct—A 1-ml aqueous dispersion of isolated and defatted barley embryo powder (1 mg) was incubated for 15 min with purified LTP1 (1 mg) in the presence or absence of [13C]linoleic acid (0.2 mm). By coupling reversed phase HPLC and mass spectrometry, we observed that adduction proceeded only when linoleic acid was added in the reaction medium and that 13C was incorporated in the adducted LTP1 (molecular mass, 9999 Da). The Lipid-like Adduct Is an α-Ketol—The experiments described above suggested that the lipid adduct was an oxylipin formed via the LOX pathway. In agreement with previous work (19Douliez J.P. Jegou S. Pato C. Larre C. Molle D. Marion D. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the adduct was released from LTP1 by alkaline hydrolysis. After methylation and silylation, GC-MS revealed multiple products that increased in number with time of hydrolysis. This confirmed that the adduct was unstable under alkaline conditions, as observed previously (20Lindorff-Larsen K. Lerche M.H. Poulsen F.M. Roepstorff P. Winther J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33547-33553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Methods employing non-alkaline conditions or in situ stabilization of the adduct prior to alkaline hydrolysis were next tried. First, direct transmethylation was conducted with BF3/methanol on the freeze-dried pure adducted protein. After extraction with CH2Cl2, the transmethylated adduct (I) was analyzed by GC-MS and GC-high resolution mass spectrometry: m/z (ion attribution, elemental composition) (relative intensity percentage): 308 [M+·, C19H32O3]+ (18), 277 [M-OCH3, C18H29O2]+ (9%), 251 [M-C4H9, C15H23O3]+ (10), 151 [C10H15O]+ (100), 95 [C6H7O]+ (32), 165 (12), 55 (8). The MS fragmentation pattern as well as the elemental composition indicated that product (I) (Fig. 1) was identical to methyl 10,13-epoxy-10,12-octadecadienoate, a furan fatty acid methyl ester. The parent ion of m/z 308 is in accordance with methylation of the 294 Da adduct (+14 Da) deduced from the difference between theoretical and experimental masses of the protein. However, when free furan acid was incubated with barley LTP1, no adduction could be observed by LC-MS analysis. Apparently, the furan acid was not present as such in LTP1b but was formed during the BF3 treatment. Secondly, treatments of LTP1b with NaBH4 followed by 0.2 m NaOH released CH2Cl2-extractable material that was derivatized by trimethylsilyl. Two major products (II) and (III) with identical MS fragmentation pattern were obtained: m/z [ion attribution] (relative intensity percentage) 515 [M-15]+(2.5), 419 (11), 329 (419-90) (34), 317 (100), 213 (26), 147 (25), 73 (73). This fragmentation was identical to that observed for the authentic threo and erythro stereoisomers of 9,10-dihydroxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid. Methoxyamine derivatization of LTP1b gave rise to isomers (IV) and (V), identical to the syn-/anti-isomers of the methoxime derivative of authentic 9-hydroxy-10-oxo-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid. In addition, treatment of LTP1b with sodium borodeuteride followed by alkaline hydrolysis produced 9,10-dihydroxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid, which was labeled with one deuterium atom exclusively at C-10, thus showing that this was the original oxo carbon. Furthermore, treatment of the 9-hydroxy-10-oxo-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid (9,10-ketol) standard with BF3/methanol yielded methyl 10,13-epoxy-10,12-octadecadienoate (I), thus confirming the origin of the furan ester formed on transmethylation of LTP1b. All together, these results clearly indicated that the lipid adduct from barley LTP1b is 9,10-ketol. This oxylipin is formed from linoleic acid 9-hydroperoxide in the presence of AOS (36Hamberg M. Hughes M.A. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1989; 19: 64-69PubMed Google Scholar). Structural Characterization of the Lipid-like Adduct Bound to LTP1—Adducted LTP1 was produced from barley LTP1 and defatted barley embryo as described above but using [13C]linoleic acid. Despite the presence of a 13C-enriched adduct, two-dimensional spectra aimed at collecting correlations between directly bound carbons were unsuccessful due to the long acquisition times required. Correlations between protons and carbons were also difficult to acquire as the major protons signals were provided by the protein. The structure was deduced from chemical shifts as well as their hyperfine structure induced by directly bound carbons J-couplings (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table 1). Three carbon signals were detected in the region between 170 and 220 ppm corresponding to the carboxylic acid and carbonyl functions. The COO group (C1) could be distinguished from the carbonyl ones (C10) by a doublet (scalar-coupled with C7) at a higher field (181 ppm). The olefinic carbons (C12 and C13) showed multiplets between 120 and 140 ppm, whereas the C9 carbon resonated at 82.8 ppm. The aliphatic carbons could be observed in the 0–40-ppm region with a net distinction for the methyl group C18 at 16.4 ppm that exhibited a doublet by coupling with the neighboring C17 methylene. The structure deduced from the 13C spectrum fitted well with the above mentioned 9-hydroxy-10-oxo-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid structure. The narrow width of NMR signals suggested that the adduct has a high mobility despite being covalently attached to the protein. To identify the amino acid residue involved in the adduction, LTP1b was reduced and alkylated under acidic conditions to prevent any release or degradation of the adduct. Trypsin hydrolysates of non-adducted and adducted barley LTP1 were compared. Comparison of the mass profiles by MALDI-MS highlighted the probable modification of peptide T1 (MH+ 1088.5 Da) in adducted LTP since this T1 fragment peptide is observed with a MH+ of 1382.5 (data not shown). To locate the modification within the polypeptide chain of fragment T1, the tryptic mixtures of LTP1s were further examined by tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). According to the abundant y″2 and y″3 fragment ions in the MS-MS spectra from LTP1 and LTP1b, Asp-7 was unambigously identified as involved in the adduction (Fig. 3). Barley LTP1 Specifically Traps the Unstable Allene Oxide 9(S)-Epoxy-10,12(Z)-octadecadienoic Acid—When the 9,10-ketol standard was incubated with barley LTP1, no adduction occurred, as indicated by LC-MS analysis (result not shown). α-Ketols are formed by hydrolysis of unstable allene oxides generated from hydroperoxides in the presence of AOS, and it was conceivable that the allene oxide precursor of 9,10-ketol could react directly with LTP1 to produce LTP1b. This allene oxide, i.e. 9(S),10-epoxy-10,12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9,10-allene oxide), has been previously characterized and found to have a t½ of 34 s at 0 °C (36Hamberg M. Hughes M.A. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1989; 19: 64-69PubMed Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, 9,10-allene oxide was generated by incubation of 300 μm 9-HPOD with maize AOS at 0 °C. Under these conditions, complete conversion of the hydroperoxide into allene oxide is achieved within 10 s of incubation, and thereafter, the 9,10-allene oxide will decay exponentially with a first order rate constant of 0.02 s–1 (36Hamberg M. Hughes M.A. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1989; 19: 64-69PubMed Google Scholar). LTP1 (50 μm) was added to such incubates at different times, thereby exposing the protein to the following estimated concentrations of 9,10-allene oxide: 271 μm (addition at 15 s following start of the incubation), 147 μm (addition at 45 s), 32 μm (addition at 2 min), 0.8 μm (addition at 5 min), and 0.002 μm (10 min). LTP1s were analyzed by LC-MS. As seen in Fig. 4A, LTP1 was adducted by the 9,10-allene oxide generated from 9-HPOD. A plot of the percentage of adduction versus the estimated molar ratio of 9,10-allene oxide to LTP1 showed that the adduction was surprisingly efficient (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, a specificity for the 9,10-allene oxide was indicated by the finding that LTP1 exposed in a similar way to 12,13-allene oxide generated from 13-HPOD was only poorly adducted (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2011795675,"Two different pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-containing l-threonine deaminases (EC 4.3.1.19), biosynthetic and biodegradative, which catalyze the deamination of l-threonine to α-ketobutyrate, are present in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Biodegradative threonine deaminase (TdcB) catalyzes the first reaction in the anaerobic breakdown of l-threonine to propionate. TdcB, unlike the biosynthetic threonine deaminase, is insensitive to l-isoleucine and is activated by AMP. In the present study, TdcB from S. typhimurium was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli. In the presence of AMP or CMP, the recombinant enzyme was converted to the tetrameric form accompanied by significant enzyme activation. To provide insights into ligand-mediated oligomerization and enzyme activation, crystal structures of S. typhimurium TdcB and its complex with CMP were determined. In the native structure, TdcB is in a dimeric form, whereas in the TdcB·CMP complex, it exists in a tetrameric form with 222 symmetry and appears as a dimer of dimers. Tetrameric TdcB binds to four molecules of CMP, two at each of the dimer interfaces. Comparison of the dimer structure in the ligand (CMP)-free and -bound forms suggests that the changes induced by ligand binding at the dimer interface are essential for tetramerization. The differences observed in the tertiary and quaternary structures of TdcB in the absence and presence of CMP appear to account for enzyme activation and increased binding affinity for l-threonine.

Enzymes that use pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) 4The abbreviations used are: PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; TdcB, biodegradative threonine deaminase; IlvA, biosynthetic threonine deaminase; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. 4The abbreviations used are: PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; TdcB, biodegradative threonine deaminase; IlvA, biosynthetic threonine deaminase; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. as a cofactor catalyze many important reactions involving amino acids such as transamination, decarboxylation, β- or γ-replacement/elimination, and racemization (1Eliot A.C. Kirsch J.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 383-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). On the basis of the carbon atom subjected to covalent changes, PLP-dependent enzymes are classified into at least three distinct families: α, β, and γ (2Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The α- and γ-families might be distantly related but are clearly not homologous to the β-family. The β-family members whose structures are known include tryptophan synthase (3Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol.

All these enzymes exhibit fold type II, which is characteristic of the β-family of PLP-dependent enzymes. In this family of enzymes, each subunit is formed by two distinct domains, both having typical open α/β architecture. The active sites of these enzymes are composed of residues from only one subunit. Their PLP-binding lysine residue is positioned in the N-terminal segment of the polypeptide chain.Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium are known to possess two distinct PLP-containing threonine deaminases (EC 4.3.1.19), one biosynthetic and the other biodegradative (10Luginbuhl G.H. Hofler J.G. Decedue C.J. Burns R.O. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 120: 559-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Umbarger E. Brown B. J. Bacteriol. 1957; 73: 105-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the enzymes catalyze the deamination of l-threonine to yield α-ketobutyrate and ammonia. Biosynthetic threonine deaminase (IlvA) encoded by the gene ilvA, is constitutively expressed under normal conditions and catalyzes the first reaction in the isoleucine biosynthesis pathway. l-Isoleucine and l-valine act as allosteric inhibitor and activator, respectively. IlvA provided one of the earliest examples of feedback inhibition (12Umbarger H.E. Science. 1956; 123: 848Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Biodegradative (catabolic) threonine deaminase (TdcB), encoded by the gene tdcB in E. coli and S. typhimurium, is induced anaerobically and catalyzes the first reaction in the degradation of l-threonine to propionate. Unlike IlvA, this enzyme is insensitive to l-isoleucine and l-valine and is activated by AMP. The feedback-resistant TdcB is more suited for the industrial production of l-isoleucine when compared with the feedback-inhibited IlvA (13Guillouet S. Rodal A.A. An G. Lessard P.A. Sinskey A.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 3100-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Studies on the TdcB from E. coli and S. typhimurium have shown that the enzymatic activity is enhanced in the presence of AMP due to a large decrease in Km for l-threonine and apparent increase in Vmax (14Bhadra R. Datta P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1691-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 15Dunne C.P. Wood W.A. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1975; 9: 65-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Shizuta Y. Hayaishi O. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1976; 11: 99-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Using various analogs of AMP and other natural nucleotides, the functional atoms or groups of AMP, which are involved in the ligand binding and activation of enzymatic activity have been identified (17Nakazawa A. Tokushige M. Hayaishi O. Ikehara M. Mizuno Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3868-3872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rabinowitz K.W. Shada J.D. Wood W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3214-3217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among other mononucleotide phosphates, CMP showed significant enzyme activation compared with GMP, UMP, and IMP. Further, no enzymatic activation was observed in the presence of ATP, whereas ADP showed slight activation.In the absence of AMP, TdcB exists in monomer-dimer equilibrium at low concentration (19Whanger P.D.

Chem. 1973; 248: 8200-8206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This equilibrium shifts toward the tetrameric form as the concentration of TdcB is increased. Even at low concentrations of TdcB, the presence of AMP induces oligomerization from monomer to tetramer. A number of other biochemical properties of this enzyme, including the capacity and nature of its binding to PLP, kinetic studies and molecular behavior in the presence and absence of AMP, substrate specificity, spectral changes upon addition of l-threonine, inhibition by the reaction product α-ketobutyrate and other α-keto acids, inactivation by certain intermediary metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and reaction mechanism have been studied extensively (14Bhadra R.

However, these investigations did not reveal the exact site of AMP binding and its role in the formation of oligomers or enzyme activation. It is believed that the regulation of enzymatic reaction by an effector involves conformational changes associated with its binding. In oligomeric proteins, these changes may involve relative rearrangement of subunits as well as subtle changes in the conformation of individual subunits. Three-dimensional structure of TdcB and local and global conformational changes associated with AMP binding are important to understand the mechanism by which the activity of TdcB is regulated by AMP.Here, we report the crystal structures of S. typhimurium biodegradative threonine deaminase with PLP bound to the active site Lys58 (as an internal aldimine) in two different crystal forms I and II. The crystal structure of PLP-bound TdcB in complex with CMP has also been determined in another crystal form (crystal form III). This is the first structural description of the biodegradative threonine deaminase. Apart from the overall structural features, the structures of TdcB reveal the mode of PLP binding and its relationship to the expected binding site of l-threonine. Comparison of TdcB structures with IlvA, serine dehydratase, and other members of the β-families of PLP-dependent enzymes has revealed the differences as well as similarities in the overall structure and reaction mechanism. Analysis of the tertiary and quaternary structural changes observed in the presence of CMP has provided a structural basis for understanding CMP-directed oligomerization and enzyme activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCrystallization and Data Collection—Cloning, expression, purification, crystallization, and collection of complete x-ray diffraction data sets for TdcB in two crystal forms I and II have been described previously (25Simanshu D.K. Chittori S. Savithri H.S. Murthy M.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2006; 62: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Briefly, TdcB from S. typhimurium was cloned in pRSET C vector and overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS along with an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag. TdcB was purified to homogeneity using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column chromatography. Diffraction data for TdcB in two crystal forms were collected to resolutions of 2.2 and 1.7 Å, respectively. Both the crystal forms belonged to the space group P1. The volumes of the asymmetric units in these crystals forms were compatible with two and four subunits of TdcB, respectively. Matthews coefficient (VM) and solvent content of both forms were 2.1 Å3 Da-1 and 41.7% (v/v), respectively (26Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7902) Google Scholar). The unit cell volume of crystal form II was almost twice that of crystal form I.Despite extensive efforts, diffraction quality crystals of TdcB in complex with various l-threonine analogs could not be obtained. Attempts to co-crystallize TdcB with AMP and CMP were also made. Crystals of TdcB obtained in the presence of AMP diffracted poorly, whereas crystals of TdcB obtained in the presence of CMP diffracted to a resolution of 3-3.5 Å at an in-house x-ray source. A complete data set to a resolution of 2.5 Å was collected on a TdcB crystal obtained in the presence of CMP and the substrate analog O-methylthreonine on beamline BL44XU at SPring-8, Hyogo, Japan. The data were processed and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK of the HKL suite (27Otwinowsky Z.M. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). TdcB·CMP complex (crystal form III) belonged to the space group P622. The asymmetric unit of the crystal was compatible with one subunit of TdcB with a VM of 3.6 Å3 Da-1 and a solvent content of 65.6% (26Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7902) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Solution and Refinement—Amino acid sequence alignment shows an identity of 34% between TdcB and the N-terminal domain of IlvA. The sequence corresponding to the C-terminal regulatory domain of IlvA is absent in TdcB. Therefore, a model consisting of the atomic coordinates of the N-terminal domain of the IlvA from E. coli (PDB code 1TDJ) (4Gallagher D.T. Gilliland G.L. Xiao G. Zondlo J. Fisher K.E. Chinchilla D. Eisenstein E. Structure. 1998; 6: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) with non-identical residues converted to alanine was used as the search model for structure solution of TdcB by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe (28Nawaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar). Because the quality of the data was better for crystal form II, reflections in the resolution range 15.0-3.0 Å of this crystal form were used for the rotation and translation searches. The highest peak of the translation search had a correlation coefficient of 47.2% and an R-factor of 55.6%. Refinement was initiated with the program REFMAC5 (29Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). The 2Fo - Fc map calculated after initial positional refinement showed good fit for the majority of the main chain. Map improvement by atom update and refinement was carried out using the program Arp/Warp (30Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The quality of the electron density map obtained from Arp/Warp was sufficient to allow unambiguous assignment and building of most amino acid residues using the program COOT (31Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22815) Google Scholar). In the final stages of refinement, inspection of the difference (Fo - Fc) map showed strong positive density for the expected ligand PLP. This was followed by identification of potential sites of solvent molecules by automatic water-picking algorithm of COOT (31Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22815) Google Scholar). The positions of these automatically picked waters were manually checked, and a few more waters were manually identified on the basis of electron density contoured at 1.0 σ in the 2Fo - Fc map and 3.0 σ in the Fo - Fc map. Electron density peaks, which were significantly higher than those of water molecules and were within the coordination distance from the surrounding atoms, were assigned as sodium ions, because the crystals were grown in presence of sodium ions (100 mm trisodium citrate buffer and 50 mm NaCl in the crystallization condition). The four subunits of TdcB in the asymmetric unit were labeled A-D as shown in Fig. 2a, thus forming AB and CD dimers. During the final stages of model building, large stretches of amino acids in the D subunit showed probable alternate conformations. Careful examination indicated that the entire D subunit was present in two conformations. Based on the difference (Fo - Fc) map, occupancies for the two conformations were manually fixed to 80 and 20%, respectively, which implied that one conformation was major (D′) and the other was minor (D″). Final rounds of refinement were performed using REFMAC5 (29Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar), incorporating TLS restraints (29Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). The final model of native TdcB in crystal form II contains four subunits of TdcB, four PLP molecules (bound to Lys58), two sodium ions, and 782 water molecules. The final refinement statistics are given in Table 1.Structures of TdcB in crystal forms I and III were solved by molecular replacement using the atomic coordinates of protein atoms from the A subunit of TdcB crystal form II as the search model. For the TdcB crystal form I, molecular replacement solution using the program MOLREP (32Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4120) Google Scholar) had a correlation coefficient of 67.1% and an R-factor of 41.8% in the resolution range 30-2.5 Å. This was followed by model building and refinement using COOT and REFMAC5, following a protocol similar to the one described for crystal form II. The final model of native TdcB in crystal form I contains two subunits of TdcB, two PLP molecules (bound to Lys58), one sodium ion, and 274 water molecules. For TdcB co-crystallized with CMP and O-methylthreonine (crystal form III), the molecular replacement solution using the program MOLREP had a correlation coefficient of 58.4% and an R-factor of 43.9% in the resolution range 30-3.5 Å. The initial difference Fourier map indicated alternate positions for a few stretches of residues in the polypeptide chain and electron density for CMP, which were incorporated into the model. No electron density corresponding to O-methylthreonine was observed. The final model of TdcB in complex with CMP (hereafter referred to as “TdcB·CMP”) includes one subunit of TdcB, one molecule of PLP (bound to Lys58), CMP, sodium ion, and 62 water molecules. The final refinement statistics are given in Table 1.Structure Analysis—The geometry of the final models was checked using PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Structural superpositions and the r.m.s.d. calculations between the subunits of TdcB were done using the program ALIGN (34Cohen G.E. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1160-1161Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The rotation and translation relating individual subunits of TdcB dimers were also obtained from ALIGN. The r.m.s.d. values for TdcB and the other related proteins were determined using the DALI server (35Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3552) Google Scholar). Average B-factors for protein atoms, water molecules, and ligands were calculated using the BAVERAGE program of the CCP4 suite (36P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). Interactions were evaluated using the CONTACT module of the CCP4 suite. Interface residues were identified by recognizing the residues of one subunit, which were within a cut-off distance of 4.0 Å from the atoms of the other subunit. NACCESS 5S. J. Hubbard and J. M. Thornton (1993) NACCESS, computer program, Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University College, London. was used for surface area calculations.

Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).Activity Assay and Kinetic Studies—Enzymatic activity of the TdcB was routinely examined by measuring directly the formation of α-ketobutyrate at 310 nm (20Shizuta Y. Kurosawa A. Inoue K. Tanabe T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 512-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on a Jasco UV-visible spectrophotometer model V-530 (Japan Spectroscopic Co.) at 25 °C. The standard reaction mixture (0.2 ml) contained 100 μm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 50 μm of l-threonine and rate-limiting concentration of TdcB. The reactions were carried out in the presence and absence of 5 mm CMP or AMP. α-Ketobutyrate produced was determined assuming molar absorbance of 25.6 m-1 at 310 nm. For kinetic studies, the concentration of AMP/CMP was held in excess at 5 mm. Experiments were repeated at least three times from three independent purifications. Kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting the initial velocity versus substrate concentration to the Michaelis-Menten equation, v = (Vmax[S])/(Km + [S]), using the non-linear regression analysis option of the GraphPad Prism software.Gel-filtration Chromatography and Glutaraldehyde Cross-linking—Gel-filtration analysis was carried out using Sephacryl-S 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at 4 °C for the native TdcB and with additional 5 mm AMP/CMP in case of TdcB·AMP or TdcB·CMP complex. The column was calibrated with molecular standards containing aldehyde dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29.0 kDa), and cytochrome c (12 kDa). Elution was monitored by measuring absorption at 280 nm as well as at 400 nm (peak corresponding to the internal aldimine).Purified TdcB in the native form and in the presence of AMP and CMP was incubated with 0.04% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl and 2 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C in dark for various time intervals. The protein samples were then mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and immersed in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Cross-linked adducts were resolved using SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining.Protein Data Bank Accession Numbers—The coordinates and structure factors for native TdcB in crystal forms I and II and TdcB·CMP (crystal form III) have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank and assigned accession codes 2GN0, 2GN1, and 2GN2, respectively.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBiochemical Studies on TdcB—Enzymatic activity was measured by monitoring increases in absorbance at 310 nm at 25 °C due to the product α-ketobutyrate, formed by deamination of l-threonine. Using the purified S. typhimurium TdcB, the Km value for l-threonine was estimated as 123 ± 7 mm. In the presence of 5 mm AMP and CMP, the Km values for l-threonine were 16 ± 2 mm and 32 ± 5 mm, respectively. Thus, AMP and CMP caused a decrease in Km for l-threonine by ∼7.7- and 3.5-fold. The ratios of the observed Vmax values of the enzyme in the presence of AMP and CMP to that of native TdcB were ∼9 and 3, respectively. Thus, interaction of TdcB with AMP/CMP results in the activation of the enzyme.Gel-filtration experiments with TdcB in the absence and presence of CMP showed a shift in the apparent molecular mass of the enzyme from 45 kDa for native TdcB to 100 kDa in the presence of CMP and 120 kDa in the presence of AMP (data not shown). These results are indicative of rapid equilibrium between various forms of the enzyme in solution as observed previously in E. coli as well as in S. typhimurium (14Bhadra R. Datta P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1691-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 19Whanger P.D. Phillips A.T. Rabinowitz K.W. Piperno J.R. Shada J.D. Wood W.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1973; 248: 8200-8206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies involving sucrose density ultracentrifugation have shown that the sedimentation velocity of the enzyme increases smoothly from 4.8 to 7.6 S with increasing enzyme concentration or even at low concentrations of the enzyme in the presence of AMP/CMP (43Blankenhorn D. Phillips J. Slonczewski J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in the S value from 4.8 to 7.6 S corresponded to a shift of dimeric to tetrameric form of TdcB.TdcB was cross-linked in the absence and presence of AMP and CMP with 0.04% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and was analyzed using SDS-PAGE. The cross-linked enzyme in all the three cases showed four polypeptide bands corresponding to one each for monomeric and tetrameric forms and two bands near the expected dimeric form of TdcB (data not shown). Previous studies involving cross-linking of the native TdcB and in the presence of AMP with dimethyl suberimidate followed by reduction and alkylation showed three polypeptides corresponding to the molecular weights of monomer, dimer, and tetramer (14Bhadra R. Datta P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1691-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, the results obtained by various other groups and the present gel-filtration and glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments strongly suggest that, in the presence of AMP or CMP or at high concentration of the enzyme, TdcB is in a tetrameric form.Model Quality—In all the three crystal forms, electron density is of good quality throughout the polypeptide chain except for a few surface residues. In crystal forms I and II, relatively poorer density is observed for the side chains of residues ranging from 108-121 and 125-135. Some of the residues in these regions as well as a few other surface residues have been truncated according to the extent of density observed for their side ch"

In this study, stimulation of mouse macrophages with CpG-B ODN increased cellular Hsp70 expression and prevented apoptosis induced by serum starvation or staurosporine treatment. CpG-B ODN-induced Hsp70 expression depended on TLR9, MyD88, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Inhibition of Hsp70 synthesis by an inhibitor (quercetin) or antisense hsp70 attenuated not only Hsp70 expression but also the anti-apoptotic capacity of CpG-B ODN. Ectopic expression of Hsp70 rescued the inhibitory effect of quercetin on CpG-B ODN-induced anti-apoptosis. Additional experiments demonstrated that quercetin and anti-sense hsp70 modulated CpG-B ODN-induced anti-apoptosis via a caspase-3-independent pathway by down-regulating the survival gene bcl-xL and by increasing translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor. These findings suggest that CpG-B ODN may up-regulate Hsp70 via a TLR9/MyD88/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway to increase Bcl-xL and to decrease apoptosis-inducing factor nuclear translocation, resulting in anti-apoptosis.

Schmid R. Sparwasser T. Heeg K. Lipford G.B. Wagner H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6230-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), which subsequently initiates a signaling cascade involving MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88). Recruitment of MyD88 is followed by the engagement of IRAK (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase) and its adaptor protein, TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6), and activation of transcription factors such as AP1 and NF-κB, resulting in the expression of regulating genes involved in host defense (5Akira S.

Immunol. 2002; 20: 709-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). CpG-A ODNs are effective in activating natural killer cells and stimulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and macrophages to produce high levels of interferon-α (7Verthelyi D. Zeuner R.A. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 519-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 8Lenert P. Rasmussen W. Ashman R.F. Ballas Z.K. DNA Cell Biol. 2003; 22: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, CpG-B ODNs primarily stimulate proliferation of B cells as well as secretion of immunoglobulins, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10. CpG-B ODNs also induce maturation and activation of pDCs and macrophages (7Verthelyi D. Zeuner R.A.

J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). CpG-B ODNs protect B cells and pDCs against spontaneous apoptosis and rescue WHEI-231 B cells from apoptosis induced by IgM (10Yi A.K. Chang M. Peckham D.W. Krieg A.M. Ashman R.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5898-5906PubMed Google Scholar, 12Park Y. Lee S.W. Sung Y.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). They also protect mouse spleen cells as well as RAW264.7 macrophages and human RPMI 8226 B cells against γ-irradiation-induced apoptosis (13Sohn W.J. Lee K.W. Choi S.Y. Chung E. Lee Y. Kim T.Y. Lee S.K. Choe Y.K. Lee J.H. Kim D.S. Kwon H.J. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms of the anti-apoptotic effects of CpG-B ODNs remain to be elucidated. Using proteomic approaches, we found, in a preliminary experiment, that CpG ODNs increase the cellular level of heat shock proteins, notably Hsp70. Heat shock proteins are the most abundant and ubiquitous soluble intracellular proteins and are expressed in both constitutive and inducible forms (14Robert J. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2003; 27: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The primary function of intracellular heat shock proteins appears to be as molecular chaperones to prevent protein aggregation and to contribute to the folding of nascent and altered proteins (14Robert J. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2003; 27: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The Hsp70 family contains stress-inducible Hsp70 and constitutively expressed heat shock cognate protein Hsc70. Hsc70 is constitutively abundant in all cells, whereas the level of Hsp70 is low in normal cells. A high level of Hsp70 has been found in cancer or normal cells after stress induction (15Volloch V.Z. Sherman M.Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3648-3651Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16Garrido C. Gurbuxani S. Ravagnan L. Kroemer G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Hsp70 protects cells from apoptotic death induced by not only ischemia, adriamycin, and UVB radiation but also by pathogenic viruses (17Tsuchiya D. Hong S. Matsumori Y. Shiina H.

Cumulative evidence indicates that cellular damage or stress can induce the expression of Hsp70 to inhibit lysosomal membrane permeabilization (21Nylandsted J. Gyrd-Hansen M. Danielewicz A.

Hsp70 has been reported to exert its anti-apoptotic effects by associating with Apaf1 (apoptotic protease activation factor 1) to prevent the formation of a functionally competent apoptosome, thereby inhibiting caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation (23Jaattela M. Wissing D. Kokholm K. Kallunki T. Egeblad M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6124-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 25Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P.

It can also inhibit caspase-independent apoptosis by directly interacting with apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), thereby preventing AIF-induced chromatin condensation (26Ravagnan L. Gurbuxani S. Susin S.A. Maisse C. Daugas E. Zamzami N. Mak T. Jaattela M. Penninger J.M. Garrido C. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 27Gurbuxani S.

The apoptogenic effect of AIF has been shown to be modulated by a survival gene, bcl-xL (28Otera H. Ohsakaya S. Nagaura Z. Ishihara N. Mihara K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar); however, whether the induced Hsp70 has any effect on Bcl-xL and thereby affects AIF is not well documented. In this study, we used macrophages and pDCs as models to examine the mechanism of CpG-B ODN-mediated anti-apoptosis. Enhanced expression of Hsp70 but not Hsc70 by CpG-B ODN via the TLR9/MyD88/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway increased the level of Bcl-xL and decreased AIF nuclear translocation, thereby possibly playing an important role in CpG-B ODN-induced anti-apoptosis. Reagents—Phosphorothioate-modified CpG-B ODN and GpC ODN were synthesized by MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). The ODN sequences that we used on mouse cells were as follows: CpG-B ODN, 5′-TCC ATG ACG TTC CTG ATG CT-3′; and GpC ODN, 5′-TCC ATG AGC TTC CTG ATG CT-3′. The sequence of CpG-B ODN we used on human cells was 5′-TCC ATG ACG TTC CTG ATG CT-3′, and that of GpC ODN was 5′-TGC TGC TTT TGT GCT TTT GTG CTT-3′. Quercetin, SB203580, and LY294002 were purchased from Sigma. Anti-Hsp70, anti-Hsc70, anti-Hsp90β, anti-AIF, and anti-Bcl-xL antibodies were purchased from Stressgen Biotechnologies (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Cell Culture and Cell Treatment—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells and mouse RAW264.7 macrophages were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 200 mmol/liter l-glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was changed every 2 days for all experiments. Cells were preincubated with or without inhibitors for 1 h before CpG-B ODN treatment unless specified otherwise. The duration of CpG-B ODN treatment varied depending on the requirement of the experiments. pDC and Monocyte/Macrophage Preparation—pDCs and monocytes/macrophages were prepared from splenocytes of 8-week-old male BALB/c mice. Briefly, spleen cells were depleted of erythrocytes, and pDCs and monocytes/macrophages were then purified with a pDC isolation kit and CD11b MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA), respectively, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Plasmid Constructions—The mouse Tlr9 cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA from the mouse RAW264.7 cell line as a template and the following oligonucleotides as primers: 5′-AAG CTT ATG GTT CTC CGT CGA AGG ACT-3′ and 5′-CTC GAG CTA TTC TGC TGT AGG TCC-3′. Because the primers incorporate HindIII and XhoI sites, the PCR product was then cloned into HindIII- and XhoI-digested pcDNA3.0 (purchased from Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3.1-mTLR9. The myd88 cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA from the THP-1 cell line used as a template and the following oligonucleotides as primers: 5′-GGA TCC ATG GCT GCA GGA GGT CCC GGC-3′ and 5′-AAG CTT CTC AGG GCA GGG ACA AGG CCT-3′. Because the primers incorporate BamHI and HindIII sites, the PCR product was then cloned into BamHI- and HindIII-digested pcDNA3.1(–) to generate pcDNA3.1(–)-MyD88. To create the dominant-negative (DN) MyD88 construct pcDNA3.1(–)-DN-MyD88, which is a trun-cated version of MyD88 expressing the N-terminal death domain, pcDNA3.1(–)-MyD88 was used as a template for PCR amplification with a forward primer containing a BamHI restriction site (5′-GGA TCC ATG GCT GCA GGA GGT CCC GGC-3′) and a reverse primer containing a HindIII restriction site (5′-AAG CTT AAT GCT GGG TCC CAG CTC CAG). The PCR product was cloned into BamHI- and HindIII-digested pcDNA3.1(–). The mouse hsp70 cDNA was generated by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA from RAW264.7 cells used as a template and the following oligonucleotides as primers: 5′-GGA TCC ATG GCC AAG AAC ACG GCG ATC-3′ and 5′-AAG CTT ATC CAC CTC CTC GAT GGT GGG-3′. Because the primers incorporate BamHI and HindIII sites, the PCR product was cloned into BamHI- and HindIII-digested pcDNA3.1(–) to generate pcDNA3.1(–)-Hsp70. To create pcDNA3.1(–)-Hsp70AS (26Ravagnan L. Gurbuxani S. Susin S.A. Maisse C. Daugas E. Zamzami N. Mak T. Jaattela M. Penninger J.M. Garrido C. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), the antisense Hsp70 construct pcDNA3.1(–)-Hsp70 was used as a template for PCR amplification with a forward primer containing a HindIII restriction site (5′-CCC AAG CTT AGG ACG CGG GCG TGA TCG-3′) and a reverse primer containing a BamHI restriction site (5′-CCC GGA TCC TTG GCG TCG CGC AGG GCC TTC-3′). The PCR product was cloned into HindIII- and BamHI-digested pcDNA3.1(–). PI3K kinase-deficient plasmid M-p110Δkin-myc was provided by Dr. Anke Klippel (Atugen AG, Berlin, Germany) (29Kuo C.C. Lin W.T. Liang C.M. Liang S.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 5943-5949Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Stable Transfectants—HEK293T and mouse RAW264.7 cells (5 × 106/well) were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid pcDNA3.1(–)-mTLR9, pcDNA3.1(–)-Hsp70, or pcDNA3.1(–)-Hsp70AS using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days after transfection, the antibiotic G418 (1 mg/ml) was used for clonal selection. The G418-resistant clones were expanded and then screened for expression of mouse TLR9 or Hsp70 by Western blotting. Small Interfering RNA Transfection—Double-stranded RNAs were synthesized by Invitrogen. The target sequence for mouse Hsp90β is 5′-GAG CTG ATA CCT GAG TAC CTC AAC T-3′. They were cloned between the BamHI and HindIII sites downstream of the U6 promoter in the pSilencer2.1-U6 neoplasmid (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). The plasmid was transfected into RAW264.7 cells using FuGENE 6. After 48 h, G418 (0.6 mg/ml) was used for clonal selection. The G418-resistant clones were expanded and then screened for expression of mouse Hsp90 by Western blotting. Western Blot Analysis of Cell Lysates—The cells (106/well) were lysed on ice for 15 min with 300 μl of lysis buffer (Pierce) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The supernatants (50∼80 μg of protein/lane) were applied to Novex 4–20% Tris/glycine gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell Viability Assay—3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was used to measure cell viability in terms of metabolic turnover as indicated by the oxidation of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to purple formazan by mitochondria (30Tada H. Shiho O. Kuroshima K. Koyama M. Tsukamoto K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 93: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). In some cases, trypan blue exclusion assay was used. In brief, 20 μl of cell suspension was mixed with 20 μl trypan blue (Sigma), and cells were then counted using a hemocytometer. The ratio of trypan blue-stained cells to total cells in each experiment was determined by counting four different fields. Cellular DNA Fragmentation Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—The level of apoptotic cell death was quantified by cellular DNA fragmentation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science). The assay was based on the incorporation of the nonradioactive thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into the genomic DNA. BrdUrd was added to the cell medium at the time of seeding, and the BrdUrd-labeled DNA fragments were released from the cells into the cytoplasm during apoptosis. The DNA fragments were then detected immunologically by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an anti-DNA antibody-coated microplate to capture the DNA fragment and a peroxidase-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody to detect the BrdUrd contained in the captured DNA fragments. The degree of apoptosis (cytosolic DNA fragments) was quantified following the manufacturer's recommendations. Caspase-3 Activity—Caspase-3 activity was determined by cleavage of the fluorometric substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-aminomethylcoumarin (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and treated with lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The cell lysates (100 μg) were assayed in triplicate with 72 μm caspase-3 fluorometric substrate and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Cleavage of caspase-3 substrate was followed by measurement of emission at 460 nm after excitation at 380 nm using a fluorescence plate reader. Cell Fractionation—Cytosolic and nuclear fractions for AIF studies were prepared by resuspending cells in ice-cold 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture (pH 7.4). Homogenization was performed in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted at 750 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was then spun at 10,000 × g for 25 min. Statistical Analysis—All values are given as the means ± S.D. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Scheffé's test. CpG-B ODN Up-regulates Cellular Hsp70 but Not Hsc70—Using proteomic approaches, we found, in a preliminary experiment, that CpG-B ODN treatment increased the expression of Hsp70 in swine macrophages. In this study, we further found that the expression of Hsp70 was increased by CpG-B ODN but not GpC ODN (negative control) in the mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cell line and mouse spleen pDCs as well as in monocytes/macrophages (Fig. 1, A and B). The increase in Hsp70 expression occurred mainly intracellularly because the level of Hsp70 in the culture medium showed little, if any, change after CpG-B ODN treatment (data not shown). In addition, we also evaluated the time course of elevation of Hsp70 expression. The level of Hsp70 but not Hsc70 in cells after 14–24 h of CpG-B ODN treatment was increased compared with that in cells treated with GpC ODN (negative control) or medium alone (p < 0.005) (Fig. 1A). CpG-B ODN Up-regulates Hsp70 via the TLR9/MyD88/PI3K Pathway—Bacterial CpG DNA has been shown to co-localize in an endosomal compartment with TLR9 after endocytosis (31Ahmad-Nejad P. Hacker H. Rutz M. Bauer S. Vabulas R.M. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1958-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether TLR9 and endosomal maturation play a role in CpG-B ODN-mediated induction of Hsp70, we treated a TLR9-deficient HEK293T cell line with CpG-B ODN and found that CpG-B ODN caused little, if any, increase in the cellular Hsp70 level (supplemental Fig. 1). After the mouse Tlr9 gene was stably integrated into HEK293T cells, however, the cellular level of Hsp70 was greatly increased by CpG-B ODN and was modulated by the addition of chloroquine (Fig. 2, A and B), an inhibitor of endosomal maturation known to affect TLR9 function (4Hacker H. Mischak H. Miethke T. Liptay S. Schmid R. Sparwasser T. Heeg K. Lipford G.B. Wagner H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6230-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Because TLR9 signaling is via an MyD88-dependent pathway (32Hacker H. Vabulas R.M. Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. Wagner H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), we further investigated whether the DN-MyD88 mutant would affect the level of Hsp70 induced by CpG-B ODN. RAW264.7 cells were transiently transfected with various concentrations of DN-MyD88 plasmids for 48 h, followed by Western blot analysis of the cell lysates to detect the expression of Hsp70. CpG-B ODN-mediated induction of Hsp70 was inhibited by DN-MyD88 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results suggest that CpG-B ODN increases the expression of Hsp70 via a TLR9/MyD88 signaling pathway. Because CpG DNA/ODN activates PI3K to regulate a variety of cellular responses (29Kuo C.C. Lin W.T. Liang C.M. Liang S.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 5943-5949Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 33Fukao T. Koyasu S. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 358-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) and because the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in heat shock protein induction under certain stress conditions (34Zhou J. Schmid T. Frank R. Brune B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13506-13513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 35Guo F. Sigua C. Bali P. George P. Fiskus W. Scuto A. Annavarapu S. Mouttaki A. Sondarva G. Wei S. Wu J. Djeu J. Bhalla K. Blood. 2005; 105: 1246-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we treated RAW264.7 cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 before CpG-B ODN treatment. CpG-B ODN-induced Hsp70 expression was inhibited by LY294002 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). Consistent with the findings from inhibitor analysis, the CpG ODN-mediated increase in Hsp70 was inhibited by overexpression of a class I PI3K kinase-deficient plasmid (DN-PI3K, i.e. M-p110Δkin-myc), which inhibited the CpG-B ODN-mediated phosphorylation of the PI3K substrate Akt (Fig. 2E and supplemental Fig. 2). Thus, the PI3K/Akt pathway might be instrumental for CpG-B ODN-mediated induction of Hsp70. Induction of Hsp70 via PI3K Is Positively Associated with CpG-B ODN-induced Cell Survival—Incubation of THP-1 (data not shown) or RAW264.7 (Fig. 3A) cells in serum-starved medium (0% fetal bovine serum (FBS)) for 60 h resulted in an ∼32 or 27% decrease in cell viability, respectively. The addition of CpG-B ODN to cells cultured in serum-starved medium improved the cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, whereas GpC ODN (negative control) had no effect on viability (Fig. 3A). Incubation of RAW264.7 cells in serum-free medium for >60 h (7 days) resulted in even more cell death (>70%), which was nonetheless still preventable by the addition of CpG-B ODN (Fig. 3B). This effect of CpG-B ODN was accompanied by a decrease in cellular DNA condensation and fragmentation (supplemental Fig. 3A), indicating a decline in apoptosis. A similar anti-apoptotic effect of CpG-B ODN was observed in RAW264.7 cells pretreated with the pro-apoptotic agent staurosporine (STS) (supplemental Fig. 3B) and in pDCs (Fig. 3C). The anti-apoptotic effect of CpG-B ODN was blocked by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 but not the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. 3D), suggesting that PI3K plays a more important role than p38 MAPK in mediating the anti-apoptotic effect of CpG-B ODN. To determine whether Hsp70 is indeed involved in CpG-B ODN-mediated anti-apoptosis, we first examined the cellular effects of the Hsp70 synthesis inhibitor quercetin. Although quercetin alone did not affect the viability (Fig. 3B) or DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3E) of RAW264.7 cells, it modulated the anti-apoptotic effect of CpG-B ODN (Fig. 3, B–E and supplemental Fig. 4) and inhibited CpG-B ODN-induced Hsp70 expression (Fig. 4A). Inhibition of Hsp70 expression in transiently transfected RAW264.7 cells with the antisense mouse hsp70 gene also resulted in a decreased CpG-B ODN anti-apoptotic effect (Fig. 4B). Ectopic expression of Hsp70 in RAW264.7 cells decreased the inhibitory effect of quercetin and restored the anti-apoptotic effect of CpG-B ODN (Fig. 4A). Collectively, these results suggest that induction of Hsp70 by CpG-B ODN via the PI3K pathway may play an important role in CpG-B ODN-mediated anti-apoptosis. Hsp70 Participates in CpG-B ODN-mediated Anti-apoptosis via Inhibition of AIF Apoptogenic Effects but Not Caspase-3 Activation—Bacterial CpG DNA has been shown to induce dendritic cell survival via the PI3K pathway by preventing the cleavage of procaspase-3 and by down-regulating the formation of active caspase-3 fragments such as p17 (12Park Y. Lee S.W. Sung Y.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether CpG-B ODN-induced Hsp70 could have any influence on caspase-3 activity, we stably transfected RAW264.7 cells with antisense hsp70 cDNA (RAWHsp70AS) and others with Hsp90β small interfering RNA (RAWHsp90βRNAi) (Fig. 5A). Culture of cells in serum-deprived or STS-supplemented medium significantly increased caspase-3 activation (Fig. 5, B and C), which was modulated by CpG-B ODN but not GpC ODN (negative control). A similar inhibitory effect of CpG-B ODN on caspase-3 activation was found in RAWHsp70AS cells (Fig. 5, B and C), indicating that CpG-B ODN does not depend on Hsp70 to inhibit caspase-3 activation. However, inhibition of Hsp90β by expressing Hsp90β small interfering RNA (RAWHsp90βRNAi) significantly decreased the inhibitory effect of CpG-B ODN on caspase-3 activation (Fig. 5, B and C), suggesting that the modulating effect of CpG-B ODN on STS- or serum starvation-induced activation of caspase-3 likely depends on Hsp90β. To further evaluate the involvement of Hsp70 in the anti-apoptotic effect of CpG-B ODN, we determined the effect of CpG-B ODN on AIF and investigated whether it could involve Hsp70. AIF is a caspase-independent death effector released from mitochondria and subsequently translocated into the nucleus in the apoptotic process (36Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). Much evidence has shown that AIF is essential for serum withdrawal- or STS-induced apoptosis (27Gurbuxani S. Schmitt E. Cande C. Parcellier A. Hammann A. Daugas E. Kouranti I. Spahr C. Pance A. Kroemer G. Garrido C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6669-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 37Joza N. Susin S.A. Daugas E. Stanford W.L. Cho S.K. Li C.Y. Sasaki T. Elia A.J. Cheng H.Y. Ravagnan L. Ferri K.F. Zamzami N. Wakeham A. Hakem R. Yoshida H. Kong Y.Y. Mak T.W. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Kroemer G. Penninger J.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that the amount of AIF contained in the nucleus of control cells was greatly increased after serum starvation (Fig. 6A) or STS treatment (Fig. 6B) and that this nuclear translocation of AIF was inhibited either by stable expression of Hsp70 in RAW264.7 cells (RAWHsp70) or by CpG-B ODN treatment (Fig. 6, A and B). Moreover, the ability of CpG-B ODN to prevent AIF nuclear translocation was impaired in RAWHsp70AS cells and quercetin-treated mouse pDCs (Fig. 6, A and B). Taken together, these results suggest that Hsp70 most likely participates in CpG-B ODN-mediated anti-apoptosis via preventing nuclear translocation of AIF. Because the apoptogenic effect of AIF has been shown to be modulated by the cellular level of Bcl-xL (28Otera H. Ohsakaya S. Nagaura Z. Ishihara N. Mihara K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), we then determined the relation between Hsp70 and Bcl-xL. Fig. 6 (C and D) shows that the Bcl-xL levels were increased in CpG-B ODN-treated mouse macrophages and RAW264.7 cells, but that the enhancement was inhibited in RAWHsp70AS and quercetin-treated mouse macrophages, suggesting that Hsp70 may be positively associated with the anti-apoptotic effect of CpG-B ODN via the Bcl-xL/AIF pathway. It is well known that CpG-B ODN is capable of protecting B cells, macrophages, and pDCs against apoptosis (10Yi A.K. Chang M. Peckham D.W. Krieg A.M. Ashman R.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5898-5906PubMed Google Scholar, 12Park Y. Lee S.W. Sung Y.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, its mechanism of action remains to be further elucidated. Our study demonstrated for the first time that stimulation of macrophages and pDCs with CpG-B ODN but not GpC ODN for 14 h or longer resulted in up-regulation of Hsp70 via the TLR9/MyD88 pathway (Figs. 1 and 2) and that this increase in Hsp70 was positively associated with the anti-apoptotic effect of CpG-B ODN on cells cultured in serum-starved or STS-supplemented medium (Fig. 4). However, attenuation of Hsp70 expression by a synthesis inhibitor or antisense hsp70 cDNA interfered with CpG-B ODN-mediated anti-apoptosis (Figs. 3 and 4). These results thus suggest that the induction of Hsp70 by CpG-B ODN may contribute to the anti-apoptotic effect of CpG-B ODN. Activation of the PI3K/Akt but not p38 MAPK pathway is believed to be positively associated with anti-apoptosis (12Park Y. Lee S.W. Sung Y.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recently, in studying the relation between heat shock proteins and hypoxia-induced apoptosis, Zhou et al. (34Zhou J. Schmid T. Frank R. Brune B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13506-13513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) reported that PI3K/Akt contributes to stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α by provoking expression of heat shock proteins. Our findings that CpG-B ODN up-regulated Hsp70 primarily via the PI3K pathway (Fig. 2, D and E) and that inhibition of PI3K but not p38 MAPK modulated CpG-B ODN-mediated anti-apoptosis (Fig. 3D) provide further evidence for the importance of Hsp70 and PI3K in anti-apoptosis. Although CpG-B DNA has been shown to prevent cell death via inhibition of caspase-3 activation (12Park Y. Lee S.W. Sung Y.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), this study revealed that AIF nuclear translocation, a caspase-independent process, was involved in CpG-B ODN-mediated anti-apoptosis (Fig. 6). Our findings that inhibition of Hsp70 by antisense Hsp70 impaired the ability of CpG-B ODN to prevent AIF nuclear translocation (Fig. 6) but not caspase-3 activation (Fig. 5) suggest that induction of Hsp70 by CpG-B ODN may selectively contribute to the effect of CpG-B ODN on AIF. Recently, Zhu et al. (38Zhu C. Xu F. Wang X. Shibata M. Uchiyama Y. Blomgren K. Hagberg H. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 1016-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) reported that the brain neurons of postnatal day 9 male mice with moderate hypoxia-ischemia displayed a more pronounced translocation of AIF, whereas those of female mice displayed a stronger activation of caspase-3. The advantage of selectively inhibiting AIF translocation but not caspase-3 activation remains, however, to be elucidated. Hsp70 has been shown to increase the expression and transcriptional activity of STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5), thereby improving the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-xL (35Guo F. Sigua C. Bali P. George P. Fiskus W. Scuto A. Annavarapu S. Mouttaki A. Sondarva G. Wei S. Wu J. Djeu J. Bhalla K. Blood. 2005; 105: 1246-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) to inhibit caspase-3 activation and to prevent nuclear translocation of AIF (35Guo F. Sigua C. Bali P. George P. Fiskus W. Scuto A. Annavarapu S. Mouttaki A. Sondarva G. Wei S. Wu J. Djeu J. Bhalla K. Blood. 2005; 105: 1246-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 39Yin W. Cao G. Johnnides M.J. Signore A.P. Luo Y. Hickey R.W. Chen J. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 21: 328-371Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Our experiments showed an increase in the level of Bcl-xL by CpG-B ODN, which was attenuated by inhibiting Hsp70 expression with an inhibitor or antisense Hsp70 (Fig. 6, C and D). Thus, CpG-B ODN might induce the expression of Hsp70, which then activates Bcl-xL to block nuclear translocation of AIF, resulting in anti-apoptosis. Of note, we did not observe a significant decline in the inhibitory effect of CpG-B ODN on caspase-3 activation upon anti-sense Hsp70 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages. CpG-B ODN may thus modulate the activation of caspase-3 in these cells primarily via pathway(s) other than the induction of Hsp70. One of the likely mediators is Hsp90β, which has been shown to be up-regulated after CpG ODN treatment (40Kuo C.C. Kuo C.W. Liang C.M. Liang S.M. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 894-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and which is an excellent modulator of caspase-3 activation (Fig. 5, B and C). The influence of Hsp90β on the anti-apoptotic effect of CpG ODN has been revealed (supplemental Fig. 5), with further study being undertaken to address this issue. In summary, our results demonstrate that CpG-B ODN up-regulates the expression of stress-inducible Hsp70 (without affecting constitutively expressed Hsc70) via a TLR9/MyD88/PI3K signaling pathway. The enhanced Hsp70 protein expression may be positively associated with CpG-B ODN-mediated anti-apoptosis primarily via increasing the level of Bcl-xL and inhibiting AIF translocation without activating caspase-3.

Over the past few years, numerous compounds with remarkable cdk inhibitory activity have been studied in cancer therapy, although it is very difficult to point out the best cdk to target. An excellent candidate appears to be cdk2, whose alteration is a pathogenic hallmark of tumorigenesis. The small molecule described in our study showed an inhibitory effect on the kinase activity of cdk2, a significant growth arrest observed in a colony formation assay and a reduction in the size of the tumor in nude mice, thus suggesting its potential role as a promising new type of mechanism-based antitumor drug, also for the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2063952128,"Emerging evidence indicates that fibrin clotting is regulated by different external factors. We demonstrated recently that decorin, a regulator of collagen fibrillogenesis and transforming growth factor-β activity, binds to the D regions of fibrinogen (Dugan, T.A., Yang, V. W.-C., McQuillan, D.J., and Höök, M. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 13655–13662). We now report that the decorin-fibrinogen interaction alters the assembly, structure, and clearance of fibrin fibers. Relative to fibrinogen, substoichiometric amounts of decorin core protein modulated clotting, whereas an excess of an active decorin peptide was necessary for similar activity. These concentration-dependent effects suggest that decorin bound to the D regions sterically modulates fibrin assembly. Scanning electron microscopy images of fibrin clotted in the presence of increasing concentrations of decorin core protein showed progressively decreasing fiber diameter. The sequestration of Zn2+ ions from the N-terminal fibrinogen-binding region abrogated decorin incorporation into the fibrin network. Compared with linear thicker fibrin fibers, the curving thin fibers formed with decorin underwent accelerated tissue-type plasminogen activator-dependent fibrinolysis. Collectively, these data demonstrate that decorin can regulate fibrin organization and reveal a novel mechanism by which extracellular matrix components can participate in hemostasis, thrombosis, and wound repair.

Fibrinogen and fibrin participate in an array of interactions contributing to hemostasis (1Mosesson M.W. Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 270: 11-30Google Scholar). These interactions follow tissue trauma triggering platelet activation and the coagulation cascade. Thrombin converts fibrinogen into fibrin by releasing the α- and β-chain fibrinopeptides (2Blomback B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25239-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fibrin then rapidly assembles into protofibrils with a half-molecule, staggered, overlapping, and end-to-end arrangement (4Hantgan R.R. Hermans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11272-11281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Spraggon G. Everse S.J. Doolittle R.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Protofibrils coalesce into fibers through sites of lateral interaction that have not yet been completely characterized (7Doolittle R.F. Yang Z. Mochalkin I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Two types of branches that contribute differently to the physical properties of the fibrin network may form (8Mosesson M.W. Siebenlist K.R. Amrani D.L. DiOrio J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thrombin also generates factor XIIIa, which cross-links self-associating fibrin, thus yielding a covalently stabilized provisional matrix (9Takagi T. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 10Folk J.E. Finlayson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1977; 31: 1-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). The extracellular matrix plays important roles in wound repair and vascular disease. Beyond a key role in hemostasis, the fibrin-rich clot containing fibronectin serves as a provisional matrix supporting the migration and proliferation of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts (11Greiling D. Clark R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 861-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Clark R.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Wound strength improves as matrix remodeling replaces these temporary structures with collagen fibers. Decorin is expressed as an abundant small leucine-rich proteoglycan by a variety of cells, including cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, pericytes, and sprouting endothelial cells (13Jarvelainen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23274-23281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Jarvelainen H.T. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Kinsella M.G. Sandell L.J. Sage E.H. Wight T.N. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical staining has revealed decorin in the subendothelial matrix of healthy and diseased vessels (16Radhakrishnamurthy B. Tracy R.E. Dalferes Jr., E.R. Berenson G.S. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1998; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Merrilees M.J. Beaumont B. Scott L.J. Coron. Artery Dis. 2001; 12: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several independent studies have detected decorin in mouse and human atheromas as well as in the macrophage-replete lipid core and the collagenous fibrous cap (18Riessen R. Isner J.M. Blessing E. Loushin C. Nikol S. Wight T.N. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 962-974PubMed Google Scholar, 24Strom A. Ahlqvist E. Franzen A. Heinegard D. Hultgardh-Nilsson A. Histol. Histopathol. 2004; 19: 337-347PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, decorin was detected in the mineralized region of vascular lesions following sudden death (25Fischer J.W. Steitz S.A. Johnson P.Y. Burke A. Kolodgie F. Virmani R. Giachelli C. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 2391-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast to the proteoglycans of normal blood vessels, the dermatan sulfate content of decorin is decreased during atherosclerosis (26Shirk R.A. Parthasarathy N. San Antonio J.D. Church F.C. Wagner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18085-18092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This observation could explain the reduced ability of plaque-derived decorin to accelerate the inactivation of thrombin by heparin cofactor II. In vitro, the antithrombin activity of heparin cofactor II is potentiated by dermatan sulfate-enriched decorin or purified galactosaminoglycans, but not by chondroitin sulfate glycoforms or the isolated decorin core protein (27Whinna H.C. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3920-3924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The small leucine-rich proteoglycans compose a family of 11 extracellular matrix glycoproteins with sequence and structural similarity (28Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 29Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). A shared phenotype among small leucine-rich proteoglycan null mouse strains is a tissue-restricted defect in collagen fiber assembly (30Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E.

Decorin-deficient mice present with fragile skin reminiscent of dermatosparaxis (30Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Ultrastructural images of the dermal collagen from these mice uncovered abnormal variability in fiber girth and interfibrillar spacing. Mechanistic studies in vitro have demonstrated that the core protein of decorin mediates collagen binding requisite for regulating fibrillogenesis (34Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegard D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 38Kresse H. Liszio C. Schonherr E. Fisher L.W. J. Biol.

Structural models of decorin core protein have revealed a non-globular fold with ample surface for an array of interactions (39Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol.

The central domain consists of 12 tandem leucine-rich repeat motifs that potentially can offer binding sites for collagens I, V, and VI; fibronectin; the epidermal growth factor receptor; and transforming growth factor-β (27Whinna H.C.

N- and C-terminal segments containing pairs of cysteinyl residues flank the leucine-rich repeat domains of decorin, all other small leucine-rich proteoglycans, and many proteins of the leucine-rich repeat superfamily (28Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 29Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J.

These disulfide bonds are believed to stabilize the overall modular structure of leucine-rich repeat proteins (35Scott P.G. Winterbottom N. Dodd C.M. Edwards E. Pearson C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 40Scott P.G. McEwan P.A. Dodd C.M. Bergmann E.M. Bishop P.N. Bella J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15633-15638Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that the N-terminal regions of the decorin and biglycan core proteins bind Zn2+ ions when present at low micromolar concentrations (47Yang V.W.C. LaBrenz S.R. Rosenberg L.C. McQuillan D. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12454-12460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This corroborates analytical ultracentrifugation results showing that biglycan proteoglycan occurs as a hexamer in the presence of Zn2+ ions while in monomer-dimer equilibrium with EDTA (48Liu J. Laue T.M. Choi H.U. Tang L.H. Rosenberg L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28366-28373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, we discovered that Zn2+ ions enable the N-terminal region of decorin core protein to self-associate and specifically recognize the D regions of fibrinogen (49Dugan T.A. Yang V.W.C. McQuillan D.J. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13655-13662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This study was designed to assess the effects of decorin-fibrinogen interaction on fibrin clot assembly and structure. We show here that decorin core protein or an N-terminal decorin peptide mimetic containing the fibrinogen-binding site can modulate fibrin clotting. In this process, decorin becomes incorporated into the fibrin network. Fibrin clots formed in the presence of decorin and observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 3The abbreviations used are: SEM, scanning electron microscopy; HBS, Hepes-buffered saline; t-PA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: SEM, scanning electron microscopy; HBS, Hepes-buffered saline; t-PA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. exhibited a novel structure and underwent accelerated fibrinolysis when incubated with plasminogen plus tissue-type plasminogen activator, but not with pre-activated plasmin. Thus, we provide evidence that decorin can act as a novel regulator of fibrin(ogen) function during hemostasis, thrombosis, and wound repair. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Decorin Core Proteins—Recombinant human decorin core protein was produced using a vaccinia virus-based mammalian cell culture system as described previously (49Dugan T.A. Yang V.W.C. McQuillan D.J. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13655-13662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 50Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To prevent decorin core protein from being generated with galactosaminoglycan polysaccharides, we used CHO-745 cells deficient in xylosyltransferase activity (51Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Next, decorin core protein bearing an N-terminal His tag was purified from the cell culture medium on an Ni2+-chelated chromatographic matrix (49Dugan T.A. Yang V.W.C. McQuillan D.J. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13655-13662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 50Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The purity and identity of decorin core protein were verified by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining and by Western blotting with rabbit anti-decorin polyclonal antiserum PR2 and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) (50Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed a doublet of bands that was shown previously to represent intact decorin core proteins harboring two or three N-linked oligosaccharides. Diffusely staining decorin proteoglycans were not observed. Decorin concentrations were quantified using a calculated extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 19,820 m–1 cm–1. To generate core protein depleted of metal ions, 10 μm decorin was mixed with 1 mm EDTA and incubated overnight. Western blotting was employed to confirm that this incubation did not result in the proteolytic fragmentation of decorin. A recombinant peptide mimetic of the murine decorin N-terminal domain was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and refolded with Zn2+ ions as described previously (47Yang V.W.C. LaBrenz S.R. Rosenberg L.C. McQuillan D. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12454-12460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 49Dugan T.A. Yang V.W.C. McQuillan D.J. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13655-13662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The decorin N-terminal domain comprises a 4-residue vector-derived sequence, followed by 41 residues corresponding to the N-terminal segment of mature mouse decorin core protein. Peptide concentrations were calculated with an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 3280 m–1 cm–1. Clotting Assay—Human fibrinogen depleted of plasminogen, von Willebrand factor, and fibronectin (FIB 3, Enzyme Research Laboratories) was incubated for 1.5 h at ambient temperature in the absence or presence of decorin core protein or peptide over a range of concentrations and under the solution conditions specified in each figure legend. Aliquots of 90 μl from each mixture containing 2.0 μm fibrinogen were dispensed into separate wells of a flat-bottomed microtiter plate (Immulon, Dynatech Laboratories, Inc.) (52Hogan K.A. Gorkun O.V. Lounes K.C. Coates A.I. Weisel J.W. Hantgan R.R. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17778-17785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A total of four to six clotting reactions were simultaneously initiated by the addition of 10 μl of thrombin (Novagen) to each well through a multichannel pipette. The final thrombin concentration was 0.25 units/ml. Fibrin clotting was traced by measuring absorbance values at 405 nm over time at 30-s intervals using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp.) online with Softmax software (Phoenix Technologies Ltd.). The data were imported into KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software) for analysis and graphical presentation in PowerPoint (Microsoft). The slope of the steepest segment of each clotting curve was calculated and multiplied by 1000 to give the rate in milli-absorbance/min. Clot turbidity measured 10 min after thrombin addition was reported as the final absorbance at 405 nm because it was found to be equivalent to the turbidity observed 16 h later. Scanning Electron Microscopy—Fibrin clots were prepared in the absence or presence of decorin in duplicate at the concentrations and conditions specified in the figure legends. Each clot was formed on Parafilm within a circular ring cut from the cap of a 200-μl PCR tube (Continental Lab Products) (52Hogan K.A. Gorkun O.V. Lounes K.C. Coates A.I. Weisel J.W. Hantgan R.R. Lord S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17778-17785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thrombin in a 5-μl drop was initially placed in the center of the ring and mixed with 45 μl of a solution containing fibrinogen. After 3 h, the rings with adhering clots were gently removed from the Parafilm and placed in the wells of a microtiter plate containing 150 μl of 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). For buffer exchange, clots were incubated three times in 150 μl of cacodylate buffer for 10 min. The clots were next fixed with 2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (Sigma) in cacodylate, rinsed three times, stained with freshly opened osmium tetroxide (Sigma), and dehydrated through a series of ethanolic solutions. The dehydrated clots were transported in wells containing 100% ethanol, followed by critical point drying in a Balzers apparatus and sputter coating with gold/palladium particles ∼20 nm in diameter. Images were acquired with a Zeiss 1530VP field emission scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY) at the Texas A&M University Microscopy and Imaging Center. A 5.0-mm working distance and a 1.0-kV accelerating voltage were employed. For each set of conditions, at least three separate experiments were conducted in which two clots were observed. From different regions of each image, 50 fibers were randomly selected and measured using NIH Image Version 1.61 according to calibration instructions with the software. Images were imported into PowerPoint, and any adjustment in size was performed carefully to prevent distortions. Immunodetection of Decorin in Fibrin Clot Extracts—Fibrin clots were prepared as described above for the fibrin clotting assay in the absence or presence of decorin core protein with divalent cations (Zn2+ and Ca2+) or with EDTA. Two clots formed under identical conditions were removed from the microtiter plate wells, combined, and sedimented by centrifugation. The supernatant containing soluble unincorporated proteins was removed from the pelleted fibrin clot matrix. The clots were resuspended in 60 μl of Hepes-buffered saline (HBS; pH 7.4) plus 20 μl of 4× reducing sample loading buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 4% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) and solubilized by boiling for 10 min. The clot extracts were then snapfrozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored at –20 °C prior to analysis by Western blotting. The clot extracts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE through 4% stacking and 10% separation slab gels in accord with standard procedures. Following pre-activation of an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.) by rinsing with methanol, proteins were transferred to the membrane in a semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C in 10% (w/v) nonfat dry milk reconstituted in HBS to saturate the remaining protein-binding sites on the membrane. Subsequently, the membrane was washed twice with HBS containing 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 (HBST). A solution comprising PR2 antiserum diluted 2000-fold in HBS with 0.1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk was incubated with the membrane for 30 min. Following two washes with HBST, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 5000-fold in HBS with 0.1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk was mixed with the membrane for 20 min. An alkaline phosphatase-induced stain developed as the membrane was incubated with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (Bio-Rad). Two bands corresponding to decorin core proteins appeared within 10 min at ambient temperature. Similar results were obtained in repeated experiments. The blots were scanned and imported into PowerPoint. Fibrinolysis Assay—Fibrin clots formed in the presence of divalent cations as described above under “Clotting Assay,” but with the omission of the plasmin inhibitor ϵ-aminocaproic acid, were incubated with 100 μl of HBS containing either tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) with Glu-plasminogen or plasmin (53Mullin J.L. Norfolk S.E. Weisel J.W. Lord S.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The decreasing turbidity at 405 nm was traced for 6 h. Turbidity measurements were converted to percentages of clot lysis using Equation 1, %clotlysis=100%×(Ainitial-At)/Ainitial(Eq. 1) where Ainitial and At represent the clot turbidity before initiating lysis and at each time recorded, respectively. The analysis and graphical display were performed as described above under “Clotting Assay.” Effects of Decorin on Fibrin Clotting—The N-terminal region of decorin core protein specifically interacts with the D regions of fibrinogen (49Dugan T.A. Yang V.W.C. McQuillan D.J. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13655-13662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Following thrombin conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin, the D regions play essential roles in the assembly of protofibrils and fibers (1Mosesson M.W. Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 270: 11-30Google Scholar). Consequently, we explored whether decorin binding to the D regions alters fibrin assembly. A previous study has shown that dermatan sulfate-bearing decorin proteoglycans can inhibit thrombin through the activation of heparin cofactor II (27Whinna H.C. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3920-3924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to observe an impact of decorin-fibrinogen interaction on clotting, our experiments were conducted with a recombinant galactosaminoglycan-free form of decorin core protein (49Dugan T.A. Yang V.W.C. McQuillan D.J. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13655-13662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 51Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Initially, fibrinogen was incubated alone or with increasing concentrations of decorin core protein. Aliquots of these solutions in microtiter plate wells were then simultaneously clotted by adding thrombin (Fig. 1A). The subsequent rising turbidity has been shown to indicate the progress of fibrin clot development. Moreover, the turbidity of the clot is proportional to the average fiber girth. A quantitative analysis of the clotting curves revealed the extent to which both the assembly rate and final absorbance of fibrin clots decreased with increasing concentrations of decorin core protein (Table 1). Relative to the clotting of 2.0 μm fibrinogen in the absence of decorin, the addition of a substoichiometric concentration of 0.2 μm decorin reduced the rate and final absorbance by 31 and 22%, respectively. With increasing decorin concentrations up to 1.0 μm, fibrin clotting was further attenuated. However, clots developed similarly whether decorin was present at a concentration of 1.0 or 2.0 μm, indicating saturation. Thus, both the rate of fibrin clot formation and the structure of clots formed are affected by the presence of decorin core protein. Furthermore, the maximum effect is seen with a substoichiometric concentration of decorin.TABLE 1Quantitative effects of increasing decorin core protein concentrations on fibrin clottingDecorin concRateFinal absorbancemilli-absorbance/min0 μm90.0 ± 4.30.206 ± 0.0050.2 μm61.8 ± 4.3 (p < 0.01)0.160 ± 0.004 (p < 0.01)0.4 μm55.0 ± 3.0 (p < 0.002)0.145 ± 0.003 (p < 0.002)1.0 μm38.8 ± 4.3 (p < 0.0003)0.120 ± 0.002 (p < 0.0003)2.0 μm34.5 ± 2.5 (p < 0.0006)0.113 ± 0.001 (p < 0.0006) Open table in a new tab Our previous study showed that a recombinant peptide mimetic of the N-terminal region of decorin core protein completely inhibits the binding of intact decorin proteoglycan to fibrinogen (49Dugan T.A. Yang V.W.C. McQuillan D.J. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13655-13662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the ability of the decorin N-terminal domain to alter thrombin-induced clotting (Fig. 1B). Indeed, decorin peptide also altered fibrin clotting, yet much less potently compared with the intact core protein. The clotting of 2.0 μm fibrinogen was increasingly attenuated by the core protein at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 μm, whereas the effects of decorin peptide were observed over a range of 6.0–30 μm (Table 2). Collectively, these results suggest that decorin regulates clotting by binding to fibrinogen through the N-terminal region of the core protein. The observed differences in the regulatory potency of the intact core protein (45 kDa) and peptide (5 kDa), which bind to fibrinogen with similar affinity (49Dugan T.A. Yang V.W.C. McQuillan D.J.

Hydrolysis of the chromogenic synthetic substrate S-2238 by thrombin was monitored in the absence or presence of decorin core protein, the decorin N-terminal domain, or hirudin (data not shown). As anticipated, the anticoagulant protein hirudin inhibited thrombin activity. However, neither decorin core protein nor peptide had an effect on the rate of chromophore release. Thus, it appears unlikely that decorin core protein attenuates thrombin-induced fibrin clotting through an effect on thrombin activity. Decorin binds to the D regions of fibrinogen that participate in self-association through a number of constitutively interactive sites. To address the possibility that decorin limits fibrin assembly into protofibrils, we used SDS-PAGE to observe the cross-linking of γ-chains during clotting. The rapid cross-linking of fibrin γ-chains depends on the ability of the “a” polymerization sites in the D regions to recognize thrombin-exposed “A” sites emerging from the E regions as well as on the alignment of the C-terminal factor XIIIa cross-linking sites (referred to as γXL) (54Kanaide H. Shainoff J.R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1975; 85: 574-597PubMed Google Scholar, 55Mosesson M.W. Siebenlist K.R. DiOrio J.P. Hainfeld J.F. Wall J.S. J. Clin.

Clots formed over a 5-min period from 2.0 μm fibrinogen in the absence or presence of 0.4–2.0 μm decorin core protein each exhibited complete γ-chain cross-linking into dimers (Fig. 2). Thus, decorinfibrinogen interaction does not disrupt the D-E or γXL-γXL interactions within protofibrils. To observe whether decorin influences the lateral assemb"
https://openalex.org/W1991656112,"Modulation of the ambient redox status by mononuclear phagocytes is central to their role in health and disease. However, little is known about the mechanism of redox regulation during mononuclear phagocyte differentiation and activation, critical cellular steps in innate immunity, and microbial clearance. An important intermediate in GSH-based redox metabolism is homocysteine, which can undergo transmethylation via methionine synthase (MS) or transsulfuration via cystathionine β-synthase (CBS). The transsulfuration pathway generates cysteine, the limiting reagent in GSH biosynthesis. We now demonstrate that expression of CBS and MS are strongly induced during differentiation of human monocytes and are regulated at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, respectively. The changes in enzyme expression are paralleled by an ∼150% increase in S-adenosylmethionine (accompanied by a corresponding increase in phospholipid methylation) and a similar increase in GSH. Activation with lipopolysachharide or infection with Mycobacterium smegmatis diminished expression of both enzymes to a significant extent and decreased S-adenosylmethionine concentration by ∼30% of the control value while GSH and cysteine concentrations increased ∼100 and 300%, respectively. Blockade of the transsulfuration pathway with propargylglycine suppressed clearance of M. smegmatis by macrophages and inhibited phagolysosomal fusion, whereas N-acetylcysteine promoted phagolysosomal fusion and enhanced mycobacterial clearance 3-fold compared with untreated cells. We posit that regulation of the transsulfuration pathway during monocyte differentiation, activation, and infection can boost host defense against invading pathogens and may represent a heretofore unrecognized antimicrobial therapeutic target.

Mononuclear phagocyte (MP 2The abbreviations used are: MP, mononuclear phagocyte; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; MS, methionine synthase; CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PPG, propargylglycine; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CFU, colony-forming unit. ; dendritic cell, monocyte, and tissue macrophage) are among the first lines of host defense against an invading pathogen and represent the most critical cell type that serves to contain or eliminate infection (1Fujiwara N. Kobayashi K. Curr. Drug Targets Inflamm. Allergy. 2005; 4: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 2Taylor P.R. Martinez-Pomares L. Stacey M. Lin H.H. Brown G.D. Gordon S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 901-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). What governs initial clearance of any organism is innate immunity mediated in part through monocyte-macrophage differentiation and activation. In this regard, a body of literature demonstrates that MPs are the principal elements in clearance and inactivation of many microbial pathogens while acting, paradoxically and in parallel, as a major target and cell reservoir for persistent infection (3Blasi F. Tarsia P. Aliberti S. Respiration. 2005; 72: 9-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Such a paradox is underscored by mycobacterial infections and in particular tuberculosis, which shows the uncanny ability to persist in MP lineage cells for periods measured in decades (4Shiloh M.U. Nathan C.F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Monack D.M. Mueller A. Falkow S. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 747-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Eradicating this nidus of infection, in the human host, remains a global health problem. The significance cannot be understated as tuberculosis is responsible for more deaths in the developing world than can be attributed to any other single infectious organism (6Raja A. Indian J. Med. Res. 2004; 120: 213-232PubMed Google Scholar). The pathogenesis of this disease starts from the respiratory route with aerosol being the main portal of microbial dispersion (7Lazarevic V. Nolt D. Flynn J.L. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Once the organism lodges in the lung, mycobacterium encounters the MP, and a variety of pathological outcomes follow dependent on microbial evolution and complex immune responses that occur subsequently (8Clark-Curtiss J.E. Haydel S.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 517-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These include the engagement of surface receptors (specific for binding and pathogen entry), phagosome-lysosome fusion, and direct mycobacterial killing. Only later in the course of an immune response do adaptive immune mechanisms become operative and involve secretion of pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines resulting from presentation of antigens to T cells. Pathogen clearance follows as a terminal outcome. Redox metabolism is critical for innate immune function and tissue homeostasis (9Nathan C. Shiloh M.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8841-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). In the past decade its role in critical MP processes, in microbial surveillance, and in affecting the tempo of inflammatory degenerative disorders has been realized (3Blasi F. Tarsia P. Aliberti S. Respiration. 2005; 72: 9-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Belotsky S.M. Guzu E.V. Karlov V.A. Dikovskaya E.S. Filjukova O.B. Snastina T.I. Inflammation. 1990; 14: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a missing piece to the puzzle linking redox metabolism and disease is how it can be harnessed for therapeutic benefit in favor of the host. We reasoned that since MPs are the first line of defense against invading microbes, the conductor of final immune outcomes of host cell-pathogen interactions, and instigators of inflammatory activities, redox pathways could influence a range of macrophage functions that affect the outcome of pathogen-cell interactions (10Belotsky S.M. Guzu E.V. Karlov V.A. Dikovskaya E.S. Filjukova O.B. Snastina T.I. Inflammation. 1990; 14: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To explore this possibility common monocyte-macrophage activities including cell differentiation, immune activation, and intracellular pathogen killing were investigated for their links to redox metabolism. Macrophages produce prooxidants in abundance (9Nathan C. Shiloh M.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8841-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). GSH is a major intracellular antioxidant whose biosynthesis is limited by cysteine (11Meister A. Larsson A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Diseases. Wiley, New York1995: 1461-1477Google Scholar). The latter can be procured via transport or synthesized via transsulfuration in a pathway that converts the essential amino acid, methionine, to cysteine (Fig. 1). An important junction intermediate in this metabolism is homocysteine, which is either diverted to cysteine or recycled via transmethylation to methionine in a cycle that also furnishes S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), a major methyl group donor. The enzymes at the homocysteine junction that control its intracellular flux are methionine synthase (MS) and cystathionine β-synthase (CBS). The transsulfuration pathway is a quantitatively significant supplier of cysteine utilized for GSH synthesis (12Beatty P.W. Reed D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 204: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Mosharov E. Cranford M.R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13005-13011Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Diminution of the intracellular GSH pool size decreases cell survival, enhances HIV and mycobacterial replication, and increases sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor α-induced cell death (14Malinverni R. de Quay B. Lauterburg B.H. AIDS. 1992; 6: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 15Venketaraman V. Rodgers T. Linares R. Reilly N. Swaminathan S. Hom D. Millman A.C. Wallis R. Connell N.D. AIDS Res. Ther. 2006; 3: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interactions between microbes and MPs are the net result of a complex series of intracellular redox events that determine whether the pathogen evades or succumbs to the immune response (9Nathan C. Shiloh M.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8841-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). However, despite the physiologically important ramifications of redox homeostasis to MP function and immune modulation, fundamental questions regarding the mechanism of redox regulation in these cells remain unanswered. In this study, we report that both the transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways are strongly induced during differentiation of monocytes and that this paralleled increases in the pathway-associated metabolites, AdoMet and GSH. Activation of monocytes or macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or infection with Mycobacterium smegmatis diminished expression of CBS and MS but increased cysteine and GSH levels 300% and ∼100%, respectively, compared with untreated controls. Pharmacological blockade of the transsulfuration pathway by propargylglycine (PPG), diminished the efficiency of bacterial clearance, while supplementation with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a cysteine prodrug, increased the efficiency of bacterial killing by 3-fold. Furthermore, PPG inhibited while NAC enhanced phagolysosomal fusion revealing a mechanistic link between cysteine status and bacteriocidal activities. Modulation of the transsulfuration pathway during differentiation, activation, and infection represents a heretofore unrecognized strategy deployed by macrophages and represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Preparation of Monocytes and Culture—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from HIV-1 and -2 and hepatitis seronegative human donors by leukophoresis and purified by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation (16Gendelman H.E. Orenstein J.M. Martin M.A. Ferrua C. Mitra R. Phipps T. Wahl L.A. Lane H.C. Fauci A.S. Burke D.S. Skiliman D. Meltzer M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1428-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Purified monocytes (1 × 106 cells/ml) were cultured in media-A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen)) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated pooled human serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml ciprofloxacin (Sigma) and 1000 units/ml highly purified recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (a generous gift from Wyeth, Inc., Cambridge, MA). Cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Since detachment of a minority of cells (<10%) was observed, floating and adherent cells were combined during harvesting in all experiments. Fluorimetric Assay Using Cathepsin B—Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 2.5 mm PPG for 24 h. Following incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS and stained with 26X MR-Cathepsin B for 1 h as per the manufacturer's protocol (Immunochemistry Technologies). Labeled cells were detached by gentle pipetting on ice and transferred to a 96-well plate, and fluorescence was measured on a fluorimeter equipped with an excitation filter of 550 nm (540-560 nm) and emission filter of 600 nm (580-620 nm). The number of cells in each sample was determined by labeling nuclei with Hoechst stain (excitation 365 nm, emission 480 nm) and expressing the results after normalization (F600 nm/F480 nm). Western Blot Analysis—Cultured cells were harvested at 24 h intervals over a 7-day period. LPS, when used, was administered as a bolus to a final concentration of 10 ng/ml at day 0. Cells were washed three times with cold PBS, resuspended in PBS, and then harvested and lysed by suspending in lysis buffer as described previously (17Vitvitsky V. Dayal S. Stabler S. Zhou Y. Wang H. Lentz S.R. Banerjee R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: R39-R46Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Zhang W. Braun A. Bauman Z. Olteanu H. Madzelan P. Banerjee R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1554-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). MS, CBS, and actin levels in cell extracts were determined using the respective primary and secondary antibodies and detected using the chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase system (Sigma) as described previously (17Vitvitsky V. Dayal S. Stabler S. Zhou Y. Wang H. Lentz S.R. Banerjee R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: R39-R46Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Zhang W. Braun A. Bauman Z. Olteanu H. Madzelan P. Banerjee R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1554-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The intensity of protein bands was quantified using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) and normalized to the actin level in the same sample. Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was isolated using an RNAqueous kit (Ambion), and 5-7 μg of total RNA from each sample was used. Probes for CBS and MS and the procedure used for Northern blot analysis have been described previously (19Prudova A. Bauman Z. Braun A. Vitvitsky V. Lu S.C. Banerjee R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6489-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 20Oltean S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20778-20784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis was performed using Quantity One software. To account for variations in loading, band intensities were normalized to the 18 S rRNA in each sample, as visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Metabolite Analysis—AdoMet, cysteine, GSH, and GSSG were separated from cells extract and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (21Wise C.K. Cooney C.A. Ali S.F. Poirier L.A. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1997; 696: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). When [35S]methionine was used to label cells, incorporation of radiolabel was determined by measuring radioactivity in the chromatographic fractions corresponding to the specific thiol compounds. The concentration of each metabolite was determined using a calibration curve generated for each compound. Results were normalized to protein concentration in each sample. Phospholipid Methylation—Every 24 h between day 0 and 6 before harvesting, cultured cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated for 1 h in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 μCi/ml [14C]formate (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction was terminated, cells were harvested, and phospholipids were isolated by following a procedure described previously (22Waly M. Olteanu H. Banerjee R. Choi S.W. Mason J.B. Parker B.S. Sukumar S. Shim S. Sharma A. Benzecry J.M. Power-Charnitsky V.A. Deth R.C. Mol. Psychiatry. 2004; 9: 358-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Radioactivity recorded as disintegrations/min was normalized to the protein concentration in each sample. Infection of Human Monocytes and Macrophages with M. smegmatis—M. smegmatis mc2 was grown on Middle-brook 7H9 broth (BD Biosciences) supplemented with 10% albumin, dextrose, and catalase (ADC), and the titer was determined before infection by growing the bacteria on 7H10 plates supplemented with 10% ADC. Cells were infected at either day 1 or 7 in culture in a 24-well plate. Before infection, the cell culture medium was changed with fresh media-A lacking antibiotics. Cells were then infected for 3 h with M. smegmatis at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Following infection, non-phagocytosed bacilli were removed by washing cells three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before resuspending in media-A without antibiotics, followed by incubation with the desired additives (1 mm NAC, 10 ng/ml LPS, 2.5 mm PPG or both NAC and PPG) for 24 h as indicated in the figure legends. The colony-forming unit (CFU) assay was performed as described previously (23Garg S.K. Volpe E. Palmieri G. Mattei M. Galati D. Martino A. Piccioni M.S. Valente E. Bonanno E. De Vito P. Baldini P.M. Spagnoli L.G. Colizzi V. Fraziano M. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In brief, 24 h after incubation, cells were lysed using ice-cold sterile PBS containing 0.1% saponin and serially diluted in PBS containing 0.01% Tween 80 (Sigma) and plated in triplicate on Middle-brook 7H10 agar. M. smegmatis colonies were counted after growth for 3 days at 37 °C. For metabolite analysis, following infection and removal of non-phagocytosed bacilli (as described above), cells were incubated with l-[35S]methionine to a final concentration of 2 μCi/ml in the presence or absence of 2.5 mm PPG for 3 or 8 h. Cells were harvested and analyzed for thiols as described above. Addition of NAC, PPG, or LPS did not affect the viability of either the cells (determined by the methylthiazolyldiphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (24Manthorpe M. Fagnani R. Skaper S.D. Varon S. Brain Res. 1986; 390: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar)) and/or the bacteria (determined at 600 nm) (data not shown). The efficiency of phagocytosis of mycobacteria was evaluated by performing the CFU assay on media collected 3 h following infection. Approximately 90% of mycobacteria were phagocytosed in control and treated cells (data not shown). Confocal Microscopy—The degree of maturation of M. smegmatis-containing phagosomes was assessed using confocal microscopy by colocalization of bacilli stained with auramine and lysosomes stained with the acidophilic dye, Lysotracker Red (Molecular Probes). Following infection and removal of non-phagocytosed bacilli (as described above), macrophages were incubated in media-A lacking antibiotics and stimulated with different additives for 24 h as indicated in the figure legends. At 24 h postincubation, Lysotracker Red in media-A containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) was added at a 1:3000 dilution and incubation was continued for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed to remove unincorporated dye, and samples were prepared for microscopy following the protocol previously described (21Wise C.K. Cooney C.A. Ali S.F. Poirier L.A. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1997; 696: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed on an FN 500 Olympus confocal microscope. Dual display images were collected sequentially at a magnification of ×100 using an argon laser (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 522 nm) for detection of auramine fluorescence and a helium-neon laser (excitation, 543 nm; emission, 598 nm) for detection of Lysotracker Red. Neither PPG nor NAC directly affected the fluorescence of auramine or Lysotracker Red (data not shown). MS and CBS Expression Are Up-regulated during Monocyte-Macrophage Differentiation—Cultivation of monocytes leads to differentiation into macrophage-like cells, which is accompanied by marked morphological and physiological changes (25Buettner M. Meinken C. Bastian M. Bhat R. Stossel E. Faller G. Cianciolo G. Ficker J. Wagner M. Rollinghoff M. Stenger S. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4203-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Blander J.M. Medzhitov R. Science. 2004; 304: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). In this study, we followed the activity of cathepsin B, a lysosomal protease, which increased linearly during the first 5 days of monocyte cultivation (data not shown). Changes in the homocysteine junction enzymes, MS and CBS, were assessed during monocyte-macrophage differentiation. Western blot analysis revealed that both enzymes were undetectable in monocytes but were induced during differentiation (Fig. 2A). MS could be visualized starting from day 2 and continued to increase over a 7-day period. CBS was also detected from day 2 and reached a steady-state level by day 3. A quantitative analysis of the time-dependent increase in MS and CBS expression is shown in Fig. 2B. Northern blot analysis revealed that while increased expression of CBS protein is correlated with changes in its mRNA level, changes in MS were not (Fig. 2, C and D). Furthermore, CBS mRNA levels decreased after day 6, although protein levels were unchanged. Loss of correlation between mRNA and protein levels at later time points is likely related to the stability of CBS, which is reported to have a half-life of 49 h in liver cells (19Prudova A. Bauman Z. Braun A. Vitvitsky V. Lu S.C. Banerjee R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6489-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Changes in Pathway-relevant Metabolites during Monocyte Differentiation—The effect of CBS and MS induction on the intracellular pool of AdoMet, cysteine, and GSH was determined (Fig. 3). Intracellular AdoMet level increased 150% from 0.2 ± 0.1 μmol/g of protein (on day 0) to 0.5 ± 0.15 μmol/g of protein (on day 6) in culture. This was accompanied by a 150% increase in phospholipid methylation measured by incorporation of radiolabel from [14C]formate into cell lipids (Fig. 3B). Under these conditions, the radiolabel in AdoMet is derived from methionine formed via the transmethylation reaction catalyzed by MS (Fig. 1). Hence increased phospholipid methylation is a reflection of increased incorporation of methyl groups derived via the MS reaction into lipids. Intracellular GSH concentration also increased 170% from 26 ± 6 μmol/g of protein (on day 0) to 69 ± 8 μmol/g of protein (on day 4), during monocyte differentiation, whereas cysteine increased transiently at day 1 and returned to initial levels (∼11 μmol/g of protein) thereafter (Fig. 3C). The [GSH]/[GSSG] ratio, an index of the intracellular redox status, exhibited a sharp increase from 30 ± 13 on days 0-1 to 170 ± 36 on day 2 and remained high thereafter (Fig. 3D). Effect of LPS on Pathway Enzymes and Metabolites—The effect of LPS-induced monocyte-macrophage activation on MS and CBS and on pathway-specific metabolites was determined. Western blot analysis revealed that MS and CBS levels were significantly diminished (∼70% on day 3) up to 5 days following LPS addition (Fig. 4, A and B). However, beyond that time, MS and CBS expression in LPS-treated cells was comparable with that in untreated controls. LPS reduced the concentration of AdoMet by ∼30% of untreated controls at each time point (Fig. 4C) and increased cysteine levels ∼300% (Fig. 4D). The kinetics of change in the intracellular GSH was complex (Fig. 4D) and exhibited an initial increase of 30% after 1 day. However, this was transient and was followed by a return to steady-state levels for 4 days before increasing ∼100% thereafter (Fig. 4D). The [GSH]/[GSSG] ratio, an index of the intracellular redox status, showed a sharp increase from 35 ± 18 on days 0-1to130 ± 15 on day 2 (n = 4, p = 0.001) and remained high thereafter (data not shown). Host Transsulfuration Pathway Is Activated during Mycobacterial Infection—Next, the effect of M. smegmatis infection on cysteine and GSH was examined. No significant change in either metabolite was observed in infected monocytes (day 1) versus uninfected controls consistent with the presence of very low levels of CBS in cells at this stage (data not shown). In contrast, a 100 and 33% higher concentration of cysteine and GSH was observed in infected macrophages (day 7) compared with uninfected control (Fig. 5, A and B). In principle, the observed increase in cysteine could result from stimulation of cystine uptake and/or activation of the transsulfuration flux. To assess the contribution of the endogenous pathway to accumulation of cysteine, infected cells were exposed to PPG, a suicide inactivator of cystathionine γ-lyase (Fig. 1). Cysteine and GSH accumulation was inhibited 34 and 32% at 8 h by PPG indicating that the transsulfuration pathway is a significant provider of cysteine under these conditions. The contribution of transsulfuration to GSH synthesis was further investigated by labeling infected cells with [35S]methionine and monitoring incorporation of radiolabel into GSH in the presence or absence of PPG. GSH labeling was inhibited ∼50% at 3 and 8 h following PPG treatment of uninfected cells (Fig. 5C) and paralleled a decrease in cysteine concentrations (Fig. 5A). Under conditions of infection, an ∼40% higher radiolabel incorporation was observed in GSH, and this was inhibited ∼50% after 8 h in the presence of PPG. Transsulfuration Pathway Blockade Impairs Host-mediated Intracellular Killing of Mycobacteria—To assess the physiological significance of the increase in transsufuration flux to infection, human monocytes and macrophages were infected with M. smegmatis, and intracellular mycobacterial viability was monitored using the CFU assay after 24 h (Fig. 6). Addition of PPG to monocytes (day 1) did not have a significant effect on intracellular mycobacterial viability compared with untreated controls (Fig. 6A). However, when macrophages (day 7) were employed, PPG treatment increased bacterial viability ∼2-fold (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, circumvention of the inhibition imposed by PPG with NAC enhanced intracellular clearance of mycobacteria 3-fold compared with untreated controls. The effect of PPG was negated by NAC when the two compounds were coadministered. Blockade of Transsulfuration Arrests Phagosome-Lysosome Fusion—Since phagolysosome biogenesis is an important microbicidal mechanism in macrophages, we hypothesized that the inhibitory effect of PPG on macrophage immunity may affect maturation of phagosomes containing M. smegmatis. To test this hypothesis, the role of the transsulfuration pathway on the degree of maturation of M. smegmatis-containing phagosomes was analyzed by the colocalization of bacilli and lysosomes (Fig. 7A). Following PPG treatment, more M. smegmatis bacilli appeared green, revealing that they were not harbored inside the red-staining acidic vesicles. This result is consistent with the CFU data in Fig. 6 indicating that PPG impairs the innate ability of the macrophage to clear intracellular replicating bacteria. Treatment with NAC significantly increased acidification of M. smegmatis-containing phagosomes, consistent with formation of endosomes. The yellow color indicated colocalization of green bacilli in acidic vesicles. Quantitative analysis of M. smegmatis residing in acidic phagosomes versus total intracellular mycobacteria confirmed the increased incarceration of bacteria in late endosomes in NAC-treated cells (Fig. 7B). MP are the first lines of host defense against microbial pathogens acting as phagocytic cells, function to clear debris and pathogens, secrete bioactive molecules, and regulate adaptive immunity. In these capacities MPs protect the host against environmental, endogenous, microbial, and immune-based injuries. Although oxidation-reduction reactions are central to the response of macrophages to pathogens and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are engaged in the process (9Nathan C. Shiloh M.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8841-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar), fundamental questions remain regarding how MPs modulate redox metabolic pathways during cellular differentiation, activation, and microbial killing. Sulfur transactions are central to the pathogenic success of microbes as key sulfur-containing compounds determine initiation of protein synthesis (N-formylmethionine), methylation reactions (AdoMet), lipid biosynthesis (CoA), and redox homeostasis (mycothiol in Mycobacterium). In fact, sulfur metabolism has been implicated in mycobacterial virulence, antioxidant defense, and antibiotic resistance (27Buchmeier N.A. Newton G.L. Koledin T. Fahey R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 28Rawat M. Newton G.L. Ko M. Martinez G.J. Fahey R.C. Av-Gay Y. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3348-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The high proportion of genes encoding lipid biosynthetic functions that generate the diverse set of lipids found in mycobacteria suggest that sulfur acquisition from the host is critically important for microbial growth in the infected host. Mycobacteria obtain sulfur either via uptake of sulfate (which is assimilated into cysteine or homocysteine (Fig. 1) or methionine, with the latter being the preferr"
https://openalex.org/W1986313254,"Human and experimental heart failure is characterized by increases in type-1 protein phosphatase activity, which may be partially attributed to inactivation of its endogenous regulator, protein phosphatase inhibitor-1. Inhibitor-1 represents a nodal integrator of two major second messenger pathways, adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and calcium, which mediate its phosphorylation at threonine 35 and serine 67, respectively. Here, using recombinant inhibitor-1 wild-type and mutated proteins, we identified a novel phosphorylation site in inhibitor-1, threonine 75. This phosphoamino acid was phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase Cα independently and to the same extent as serine 67, the previous protein kinase Cα-identified site. Generation of specific antibodies for the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated threonine 75 revealed that this site is phosphorylated in rat and dog hearts. Adenoviral-mediated expression of the constitutively phosphorylated threonine 75 inhibitor-1 in isolated myocytes was associated with specific stimulation of type-1 protein phosphatase activity and marked inhibition of the sarcoplasmic calcium pump affinity for calcium, resulting in depressed contractility. Thus, phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at threonine 75 represents a new mechanism of cardiac contractility regulation, partially through the alteration of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transport activity."
https://openalex.org/W2020165438,"Little is known about the biochemical mechanism of translation in cyanobacteria though substantial studies have been made on photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, circadian rhythm, and genome structure. To analyze the mechanism of cyanobacterial translation, we have developed an in vitro translation system from Synechococcus cells using a psbAI-lacZ fusion mRNA as a model template. This in vitro system supports accurate translation from the authentic initiation site of a variety of Synechococcus mRNAs. In Synechococcus cells, rbcL and rbcS encoding the large and small subunits, respectively, of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase are co-transcribed as a dicistronic mRNA, and the downstream rbcS mRNA possesses two possible initiation codons separated by three nucleotides. Using this in vitro system and mutated mRNAs, we demonstrated that translation starts exclusively from the upstream AUG codon. Although there are Shine-Dalgarno-like sequences in positions similar to those of the functional Shine-Dalgarno elements in Escherichia coli, mutation analysis indicated that these sequences are not required for translation. Assays with deletions within the 5′-untranslated region showed that a pyrimidine-rich sequence in the –46 to –15 region is necessary for efficient translation. Synechococcus cells contain two ribosomal protein S1 homologues of 38 and 33 kDa in size. UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that the 38-kDa S1 is involved in efficient translation via associating with the pyrimidine-rich sequence. The present in vitro translation system will be a powerful tool to analyze the basic mechanism of translation in cyanobacteria.

The present in vitro translation system will be a powerful tool to analyze the basic mechanism of translation in cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria are prokaryotes that perform plant-type photosynthesis, and chloroplasts in plants are thought to be derived from an ancestral photosynthetic prokaryote related to cyanobacteria (1McFadden G.I. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 4Gruber T.M. Gross C.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 441-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Cyanobacterial genes are generally transcribed by an Escherichia coli-type RNA polymerase (reviewed in Ref. 5Thornton L.E. Ohkawa H. Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Keren N. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and the regulation of transcription has been extensively analyzed using several representative cyanobacterial species (e.g. Refs. 6Ogawa T.

However, little is known about their post-transcriptional events including RNA processing and translation. The molecular analysis of post-transcriptional processes in cyanobacteria is important to understand the evolutional relationship between cyanobacteria and chloroplasts, as it is known that chloroplast gene expression is regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level (reviewed in Ref. 9Choquet Y. Wollman F.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Several RNA-binding proteins possessing eukaryotic-type RNA-binding motifs (CS-RBD or RRM) (10Sugita M. Sugiura M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Sato N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2161-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and their involvement in various physiological phenomena (12Sato N. Wada A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 1150-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 13Mutsuda M. Sugiura M. Sugita M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1203-1209Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar) have been reported, suggesting that the gene expression of cyanobacteria is also regulated at the RNA level.Prokaryotic mRNAs generally have the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) 3The abbreviations used are: SD, Shine-Dalgarno; UTR, untranslated region; nt, nucleotide; aa, amino acids; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; WT, wild-type. 3The abbreviations used are: SD, Shine-Dalgarno; UTR, untranslated region; nt, nucleotide; aa, amino acids; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; WT, wild-type. sequence in the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR), which participates in translation initiation (14McCarthy J.E. Brimacombe R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 402-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Green R. Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 679-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The distance between a functional SD sequence and a start codon is critical with an optimal spacing of 7–9 nucleotides (nt) in E. coli (16Gold L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 199-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 17Ringquist S. Shinedling S. Barrick D. Green L. Binkley J. Stormo G.D. Gold L. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1219-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Most mRNAs of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 also possess SD-like sequences in 5′-UTRs but their positions vary (18Hirosawa M. Sazuka T. Yada T. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and only 26% of the genes harbor SD-like sequences at the optimal position (19Ma J. Campbell A. Karlin S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5733-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In tobacco chloroplasts, about 40% of the protein-coding genes contain no SD-like sequences within 20 nt upstream from start codons and the remaining 60% have SD-like motifs but not always at a conserved position (20Sugiura M. Hirose T. Sugita M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 437-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Using an in vitro translation system from isolated chloroplasts, it was suggested that translation initiation of chloroplast psbA, rps2 and atpB mRNAs does not depend on the SD-like sequence and requires trans-acting factors that interact with their 5′-UTRs (21Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 23Plader W. Sugiura M. Plant J. 2003; 34: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cyanobacterial rRNAs and ribosomal proteins were assigned mainly based on the DNA sequence similarity with those of E. coli and of chloroplasts (20Sugiura M. Hirose T. Sugita M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 437-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 24Subramanian A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 177-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recent proteomic analyses revealed that chloroplast ribosomes include several additional proteins not found in E. coli ribosomes (25Yamaguchi K. Subramanian A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28466-28482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 29Yamaguchi K. Subramanian A.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 190-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). On the other hand, few biochemical studies have been made for cyanobacterial ribosomes. Ribosomal proteins from Anabaena variabilis have been analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and 50 proteins were detected (30Sato N. Tachikawa T. Wada A. Tanaka A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7063-7071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sato N. Wada A. Tanaka A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 1367-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Ribosomal protein S1 is known to interact with the 5′-UTR and regulate translation initiation in E. coli (32Zhang J. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2605-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34Sengupta J. Agrawal R.K. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11991-11996Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Two proteins related to E. coli S1 were isolated from Synechococcus sp. PCC6301 (35Sugita M. Sugita C. Sugiura M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 36Sugita C. Sugiura M. Sugita M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). E. coli S1 is the largest ribosomal protein (61 kDa) and contains four repeats of the so-called S1 motif (37Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), whereas the cyanobacterial proteins are 33 and 38 kDa in size and possess three S1-like motifs. The presence of two S1 homologues has also been predicted from sequenced genomes in several other cyanobacteria, suggesting that these cyanobacteria have unique mechanisms of translation initiation. However, little is known about the mechanism of translation in cyanobacteria due probably to the lack of tools to analyze translation reactions. In this study, we have developed an in vitro translation system from Synechococcus cells and applied this system to investigate the translation mechanism of Synechococcus rbcS mRNA encoding the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of mRNA Templates—Unless otherwise indicated, all techniques for manipulating DNA and RNA were as described (38Samborook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The 5′-UTR (99 bp) with the following 5′-coding part (329 bp) of psbAI (1,083 bp for the entire coding region; Ref. 39Golden S.S. Brusslan J. Haselkorn R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2789-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and the primer combination of AI-f (5′-AAAGGATCCGATCTGAGAAGTGCTTCACAA-3′, restriction sites underlined) and A-r (5′-AAAAAGCTTCCACCGTTGTACAGCCACTCGT-3′). The PCR product was cut with BamHI and HindIII to fuse with the reading frame (235 bp) of lacZ (354 bp for the entire coding region) in pBluescript SK–(Stratagene) containing an artificial BglII site in the 3′-UTR of lacZ (see Fig. 1A), a gift from T. Hirose. The resulting plasmid was amplified in E. coli XL-I Blue, isolated with a QIAfilter Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen), and linearized with BglII. After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the psbAI-lacZ fusion mRNA was synthesized with T3 MEGASCRIPT™ (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The other lacZ fusion mRNAs were prepared as above using the following primer sets: RS-f (5′-GGGGAGCTCTTCGAATTCGAAACGATGG-3′) and RS-r (5′-GGGGGATCCGTTTGGCACTGCTTGATGTT-3′) for an rbcS (40Shinozaki K. Sugiura M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 200: 27-32Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar) fragment having SacI and BamHI sites, L3-f (5′-GGGGAGCTCCGATCGCCTCCCACGTCGAC-3′) and L3-r (5′-GGGAAGCTTACATCCACCTTTTGACCCGC-3′) for an rpl3 (41Sugita M. Sugishita H. Fujishiro T. Tsuboi M. Sugita C. Endo T. Sugiura M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 195: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) fragment having SacI and HindIII sites, and L4-f (5′-GGGGAGCTCCAAAGGTTCGGTTCCGGGTA-3′) and L4-r (5′-GGGGGATCCTTGACGCTGTAATCGCGGG-3′) for an rpl4 (41Sugita M. Sugishita H. Fujishiro T. Tsuboi M. Sugita C. Endo T. Sugiura M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 195: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) fragment having SacI and BamHI sites. The calculated molecular masses of hybrid translation products were 20.9 kDa (187 amino acids (aa)) for psbAI, 21.6 kDa (187 aa) for rbcS, 20.3 kDa (187 aa) for rpl3, and 20.6 kDa (187 aa) for rpl4. Deleted and site-directed mutants of the 5′-UTR from psbAI and rbcS were constructed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instruction.Growth of Cyanobacterial Cells—Synechococcus 7942 or 6301 cells were grown in the BG-11 liquid medium (42Rippka R. Deuruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) containing 5 mm NaHCO3 at 30 °C for 88 h under continuous light (50 μE/m2/s) with a sterile air of 4 liters/min in a 20-liter polycarbonate vessel. After dark adaptation for 12 h in the above condition except for light, the cells were harvested by continuous centrifugation using a rotor No. 15N (TOMY) at 4,000 × g at 4 °C and were stored at –70 °C.Preparation of S30 Fractions—The cell pellet (∼4 g) defrosted at room temperature was suspended by pipetting in 20 ml of EX buffer (30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.7, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 30 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol and was aliquoted to ∼10 tubes of a Mini Bead-Beater™ (Biospec Products) with 400 mg/tube quartz sand (Katayama Chemical). After short vortex, the suspensions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then immediately put into a 37 °C water bath for ∼3 min to allow partial melting. The suspension was agitated by the Mini Bead-Beater™ for 30 s at the maximal speed. The supernatant (cell extract) was obtained by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 1 min at 2 °C, and the precipitate was resuspended in 200–300 μl each of EX buffer followed by centrifugation. The extraction was repeated two to three times to raise the yield of cell extracts. The combined extract (∼10 ml) was centrifuged twice at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 2 °C. The resulting blue supernatant (∼8 ml) was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min with 40 μm each of 20 non-radioactive amino acids, followed by treatment with micrococcal nuclease (0.26 unit/ml, GE Healthcare) at 30 °C for 15 min in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. The nuclease reaction was stopped by adding 300 mm EGTA to the final concentration of 3 mm. The treated extract was dialyzed twice against 4 liters of EX buffer at 4 °C for 8 h using Spectra/Pore CE MWCO: 3,500 membrane (Spectrum). The dialyzed fraction (S30, ∼15 mg/ml protein) was aliquoted (34 μl each) and stored at –70 °C. S30 was diluted with EX buffer to adjust its protein concentration to 3 mg/ml before use.In Vitro Translation Reaction—The standard reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 40 min in a 25 μl solution containing 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.7, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 30 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm NH4Cl, 1% polyethylene glycol 6000, 1mm ATP, 0.1 mm GTP, 8 mm creatine phosphate, 0.4 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase (Type I, Sigma), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 133 units of RNase inhibitor (TaKaRa), 0.4 mm each of 19 amino acids, 0.37 MBq l-[35S]cysteine (>37 TBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) or 0.37 MBq [35S]l-methionine (>37 TBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), 10 pmol mRNA, and 12 μl of S30 (36 μg of protein). After reaction, proteins were precipitated with 75 μl of cold 100% acetone and were rinsed once with cold 50% acetone. The precipitated protein was suspended in the Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 8 m urea and separated by 0.1% SDS/12.5% PAGE in Tris-glycine or Tris-Tricine running buffer after heat treatment at 95 °C for 3 min. Separated products were visualized and quantified by a Bio-imaging Analyzer (BAS2000, Fuji Photo Film Co.).UV Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—A 32P-labeled rbcS mRNA portion (a 120-nt 5′-UTR with a 67-nt 5′-coding region) was synthesized from the plasmid for rbcS-lacZ fusion mRNA (linearized with PvuI) using the in vitro transcription kit (Stratagene) with [α-32P]UTP (>110 TBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and purified by 4% PAGE containing 8 m urea. The mRNA of 2.5 pmol was incubated for 25 min at 30 °C in the 25-μl translation mixture as above except 35S-labeled amino acids were replaced with the corresponding non-radioactive ones, and then the mixture was diluted with 75 μl of EX buffer. UV cross-linking of the mRNA and proteins was performed twice on ice using a UV illuminator (254 nm, 900 mJ/cm2, FS1500, Funakoshi), and then the mixture was treated with 0.01 unit of RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C. Cross-linked proteins were precipitated and rinsed with 80% acetone. 32P-Labeled proteins were separated by PAGE as above and visualized by the Bioimaging Analyzer. For immunoprecipitation, protein A-Sepharose beads (25 μl wet volume each) were mixed with 250 μl each of antibodies against Synechococcus 38-kDa S1, EF-Tu, Rbp1, and Rbp2 for 1 h at room temperature and then centrifuged to remove excess antibodies. Anti-S1 and anti-EF-Tu were gifts of M. Sugita, and anti-Rbp1 and anti-Rbp2 were as described (13Mutsuda M. Sugiura M. Sugita M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1203-1209Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The beads were washed seven times with 1 ml each of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, added to 100 μl of the reaction mixture containing UV cross-linked proteins, and the suspension was incubated for 3 h at 4°C. After collecting beads by centrifugation and washing three times with 1 ml each of phosphate-buffered saline, the beads were suspended in 25 μlofthe Laemmli Sample buffer and subjected to PAGE as above. 32P-Labeled proteins were visualized by the Bio-imaging Analyzer.RESULTSDevelopment of an in Vitro Translation System—During the course of development and then optimization of an in vitro translation system from the cyanobacterial cells, a psbAI-lacZ fusion mRNA was used as a model template, and translation in vitro was monitored by its 35S-labeled translation products. The psbAI mRNA of Synechococcus elongates PCC7942 (a strain closely related to Synechococcus sp. PCC6301) encodes the D1 protein (40 kDa) inserted into the photosystem II complex and is known as one of the actively translated transcripts in photosynthetic organisms (39Golden S.S. Brusslan J. Haselkorn R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2789-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The fusion to lacZ mRNA makes the translation product soluble, normalizes efficiencies of translation elongation, and eliminates possible effects of the psbAI 3′-UTR on translation initiation. The hybrid mRNA template was synthesized with T3 RNA polymerase from a linearized construct including the 5′-psbAI and the 3′-lacZ gene portions as shown in Fig. 1A.Synechococcus 6301 or 7942 cells were grown to an early log phase and subjected to dark adaptation for 12 h to reduce endogenous mRNA levels. Cell extracts were preincubated with unlabeled amino acids and then treated with micrococcal nuclease to digest endogenous transcripts. These steps were critical to reduce nonspecific translation in vitro. Extensive dialysis was also required to remove EGTA added to inactivate micrococcal nuclease and to standardize reaction constituents. Using this cell extract (S30) and the model template, a major polypeptide of ∼18 kDa was detected on PAGE with a relatively low background (Fig. 1B). This size is ∼3 kDa smaller than the calculated mass of 20.9 kDa. This is probably due to the presence of a long hydrophobic region (21st to 60th amino acids) in the translated products.In vitro reaction conditions were then optimized using the psbAI-lacZ mRNA (data not shown). Optimal buffer conditions were 10 mm magnesium acetate, 40 mm potassium chloride, and 20 mm ammonium chloride in 60 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.7. ATP was essential for translation and its optimal concentration was 2 mm. GTP (the optimum at 0.5 mm) and an ATP-generating system enhanced translation. An RNase inhibitor, leupepcin (thiol proteinase inhibitor), and E. coli tRNAs slightly affected translation, and hence, we did not add them. Translation was hardly detected with the mRNA of 1 pmol or less, but it increased linearly up to 10 pmol and then slowly up to 50 pmol (Fig. 1C). Using 10 pmol of mRNA template, translation increased linearly with S30 amounts (up to 8 mg of protein/ml) (Fig. 1C). Translation was observed after a time lag of ∼10 min and reached a plateau at 60 min (Fig. 1C). We adopted S30 of 3 mg/ml protein, 10 pmol of mRNA template, and 40-min incubation as our standard in vitro reaction. As expected, translation was completely inhibited with 4 μg/ml chloramphenicol (data not shown).To examine whether the optimized in vitro system translates faithfully cyanobacterial mRNAs, we replaced the authentic initiation codon AUG in the psbAI-lacZ mRNA with UAC. The mutated mRNA lost completely its translation activity (Fig. 1B, lane 2). No difference was observed when the authentic UGA stop codon was replaced with UAA (Fig. 1B, lane 3). An exchange of the UGA for UGG produced a long polypeptide of 23 kDa as the 3′-UTR had no additional in-frame stop codon (Fig. 1B, lane 4). This is consistent with that of the predicted product from the start codon to the 3′-end of mRNA (see Fig. 1A), that is, the calculated mass of 25.9 kDa subtracted by 3 kDa due to the hydrophobicity as mentioned above. We also carried out translation reactions in vitro using three additional mRNAs from Synechococcus 6301 rbcS, rpl3, and rpl4 (Fig. 2A; Refs. 40Shinozaki K. Sugiura M. Mol. Gen.

Gene (Amst.). 1997; 195: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All these mRNAs fused with the lacZ mRNA synthesized translation products of practically expected sizes at varied efficiencies (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, our in vitro system supports correct translation from various Synechococcus mRNAs.FIGURE 2In vitro translation with four Synechococcus mRNAs.

Sugiura M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 200: 27-32Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the rbcS mRNA has two possible initiation codons, both AUGs, separated by three nt, named as “1st AUG” and “2nd AUG” in Fig. 3A. To define the actual translation initiation site, we constructed an rbcS-lacZ fusion mRNA including the entire spacer region (93 nt) between rbcL and rbcS coding regions and the 5′-coding sequence (299 nt) of rbcS (see WT (wild-type) in Fig. 4A). An exchange of the 1st AUG for ACG arrested translation completely, while that of the 2nd AUG for ACG still supported translation though reduced activity by half (Fig. 3, A and C). The N-terminal amino acid sequence deduced from the 1st AUG matches that determined from the Synechococcus RbcS (SMKTLPKE—; Ref. 43Sauer J. Schreiber U. Schmid R. Volker U. Forchhammer K. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This result indicates that the 1st AUG, but not the 2nd AUG, is essential for the rbcS mRNA translation.FIGURE 3Identification of the translation start site of rbcS mRNA and effect of SD-like sequences on translation.

Sugiura M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1983; 191: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of these sequences on rbcS mRNA translation, these sequences (S1, S2, and S3) were mutagenized. As shown in Fig. 3D, none of the mutated mRNAs abolished translation. Mutation of S1 (AGGAU to ACCAU) or S3 (AUC to UAC) enhanced translation and that of S2 (UGA to ACA) retained 80% of the wild-type efficiency. It should be noted that mutation of S1, an SD-like sequence (GGA) at a proper position, resulted in 200–250% increase in translation. Thus, the interaction between an SD-like sequence and the 3′-16 S rRNA is unnecessary for rbcS mRNA translation.Sequences Necessary for rbcS mRNA Translation—As described above, translation of the Synechococcus rbcS mRNA requires no SD-like elements, and therefore an additional mechanism should operate to recognize the genuine start site. To identify sequences necessary for the translation initiation of rbcS mRNAs, we first constructed a series of deleted mRNAs based on the rbcS-lacZ fusion mRNA (Fig. 4A) and assayed their translation. Deletion from the 5′-end (–120) to –85 did not significantly affect translation; however, surprisingly a 4-fold increase was observed by deletion up to –47 (Fig. 4B). This result suggests that the original mRNA construct does not possess a maximal activity and that the –84 to –47 region includes a negative element to regulate rbcS mRNA translation.As a long pyrimidine-rich sequence lies in the –46 to –15 region (Fig. 4A), mRNAs with further deletion toward the initiation site were used to examine the role of this sequence. The translation efficiency of these mRNAs was dramatically reduced compared with Δ–66 and Δ–47 mRNAs, and deletion to –15 (removal of the entire pyrimidine-rich sequence) virtually abolished translation (Fig. 4B, Δ–15). We then examined mRNAs with internal deletions. As shown in Fig. 4C, deletion of the whole pyrimidine-rich sequence (Δ–46/–15) caused a drastic reduction (∼10% of the wild-type), and translation decreased to ∼20% by deleting half of the pyrimidine-rich sequence (Δ–27/–15). mRNA quantity was monitored during incubation using WT, Δ–66, and Δ–15 mRNAs. Despite the presence or absence of the pyrimidine-rich region, these mRNAs decayed in a similar manner (∼70% for 40 min), suggesting that the observed difference is not due to the difference in mRNA stability (supplemental Fig. S1). These results confirmed that the pyrimidine-rich region is an important ele"
https://openalex.org/W1964126349,"CTXΦ is a Vibrio cholerae-specific temperate filamentous phage that encodes cholera toxin. CTXΦ lysogens can be induced with DNA damage-inducing agents such as UV light, leading to the release of CTXΦ virions and the rapid dissemination of cholera toxin genes to new V. cholerae hosts. This environmental regulation is directly mediated by LexA, the host-encoded global SOS transcription factor. LexA and a phage-encoded repressor, RstR, both repress transcription from PrstA, the primary CTXΦ promoter. Because the LexA binding site is located upstream of the core PrstA promoter and overlaps with A-tract sequences, we speculated that LexA represses PrstA by occluding a promoter UP element, a binding site for the C-terminal domain of the α subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP) (αCTD). Using in vitro transcription assays, we have shown that the LexA binding site stimulates maximal rstA transcription in the absence of any added factors. The αCTD of RNAP is required for this stimulation, demonstrating that the LexA site contains, or overlaps with, a promoter UP element. LexA represses rstA transcription by normal RNAP but fails to repress rstA transcription catalyzed by RNAP lacking the αCTD. DNase I footprint analysis mapped the αCTD binding site to the upstream promoter region that includes the LexA binding site. The addition of free α subunits blocked the binding of LexA to rstA promoter DNA, indicating that LexA and the αCTD directly compete for binding to their respective sites. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a repressor blocking transcription initiation by occluding a promoter UP element.

CTXΦ, a lysogenic filamentous phage, has played a critical role in the evolution of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera. The ∼6.9-kb CTXΦ genome encodes cholera toxin, the principal virulence factor of this Gram-negative enteric pathogen. Following infection of V. cholerae, the CTXΦ genome integrates in a site-specific fashion near the terminus of chromosome I (1Huber K.E. Waldor M.K.

Even though CTXΦ virions are secreted from V. cholerae without cell lysis, the expression of prophage genes required for CTXΦ virion production is ordinarily repressed, as is also the case for temperate phages that lyse their respective hosts upon prophage induction. Most knowledge of prophage induction has been obtained from studies of phage λ and some closely related temperate phages that are unrelated to CTXΦ. We are studying the environmental conditions and molecular processes that control CTXΦ virion production to expand basic understanding of cellular processes that govern phage development and to gain insight into factors that may contribute to the emergence of new pathogenic V. cholerae strains. Previous studies suggest that the expression of the genes required for CTXΦ production initiates from a single promoter, PrstA. This promoter is located in ig-2, an intergenic region that separates rstA (a gene required for CTXΦ replication) from rstR, the gene encoding the phage repressor (see Fig. 1A). RstR binds to three operators within ig-2 and represses transcription from PrstA (4Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2640-2647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 5Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7035-7039Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition to RstR, we recently found that LexA, a host repressor that regulates the SOS regulon, also represses PrstA (6Quinones M. Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). LexA represses PrstA by binding to an A + T-rich site positioned at -41 to -56 from the start of rstA transcription (Fig. 1A) (6Quinones M. Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This 16-bp sequence is nearly identical to the consensus Escherichia coli LexA binding site (7Courcelle J. Khodursky A. Peter B. Brown P.O. Hanawalt P.C. Genetics. 2001; 158: 41-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The V. cholerae SOS response to DNA damage activates CTXΦ production (6Quinones M. Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). DNA-damaging agents, such as mitomycin C or UV light, increase transcription from PrstA and production of CTXΦ virions from CTXΦ lysogens in a recA-dependent fashion. No stimulation of transcription from PrstA or CTXϕ production was observed following UV treatment of CTXΦ lysogens that contained a noncleavable LexA (6Quinones M. Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We proposed that the activated form of RecA generated by DNA damage provokes the auto-cleavage of LexA, thereby alleviating its repression of PrstA. RstR levels also decline after treatment of CTXΦ lysogens with DNA damaging agents. However, unlike the λ repressor CI, RstR does not appear to undergo RecA-stimulated auto-cleavage, and the mechanism that accounts for the decrease in RstR levels in UV-treated CTXΦ lysogens is unknown. Maximal expression of rstA requires sequences upstream of the -10 and -35 binding sites for the σ subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP) 2The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; WT, wild type. 2The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; WT, wild type. in PrstA (6Quinones M. Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that these sequences, which are rich in runs of A·T or T·A base pairs and overlap with the LexA binding site in PrstA, function as a promoter UP element. UP elements are A + T-rich sequences found upstream of the -35 element in many highly active promoters, where they function to increase promoter strength by binding the C-terminal domain (αCTD) of RpoA, the α subunit of RNAP (8Ross W.

UP elements have also been characterized for the rRNA promoters of a related bacterium, Vibrio natriegens(12Aiyar S.E. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Consistent with the idea that PrstA includes a UP element, we previously reported a reduction in the expression of an rstA::lacZ reporter in E. coli producing a mutant RpoA that does not bind DNA (RpoA R265A) (6Quinones M. Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here, we have used in vitro biochemical assays to establish that the LexA binding site in PrstA overlaps with a UP element. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that LexA represses transcription from PrstA by occluding access of the αCTD to promoter DNA. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—Strains RLG3538 and RLG3545 carry pT7H6-α and pT7H6 R265A, the expression plasmids for the production of His6-tagged RpoA and His6-tagged R265A RpoA, respectively (13Tang H.

E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was used as the host for protein expression. Plasmid p770ig2, the template for in vitro transcription experiments, is a derivative of pRLG770 (14Ross W. Thompson J.F.

Plasmid p770SUB is identical to p770ig2, with the exception that positions -58 to -40 (GGCTGTTTTTTTGTACATT) were substituted with the sequence SUB (GACTGCAGTGGTACCTAGG), which does not function as a UP element (8Ross W.

Plasmid pRLG593 carries the lacUV5 promoter cloned into the same plasmid, pRLG770 (14Ross W. Thompson J.F. Newlands J.T. Gourse R.L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription—Briefly, 25-μl reaction mixtures contained 0.5 nm supercoiled plasmid DNA in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 500 μm ATP, 100 μm CTP and GTP, and 10 μm UTP with [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a specific activity of ∼30 Ci/mmol. The control plasmid pRLG593 was added to each reaction at a concentration of 0.5 nm. RNAP was added to initiate transcription, and the reaction proceeded for 15 min at room temperature (25 °C). In experiments with added repressors, template DNA was preincubated at room temperature for 15 min with LexA and/or RstR in reaction buffer prior to the addition of RNAP. With the exception of experiments utilizing RstR or LexA, reactions were terminated with the addition of an equal volume of stop solution (7 m urea, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 2× Tris borate-EDTA, 0.5% bromphenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol). In experiments that analyze RstR and LexA repression, reactions were terminated by ethanol precipitation. Pellets were air-dried and resuspended in a formamide loading buffer. Samples were heated to 90 °C and electrophoresed on 6% urea-denaturing gels in 1× Tris borate-EDTA. Radiolabeled Century RNA markers (Ambion) were used for the estimation of transcript size. Gel images were collected using the PhosphorImaging system (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation was carried out using ImageQuant TL software (Amersham Biosciences). DNase I Footprints—DNA probes were 5′ end-labeled on the rstA nontemplate strand by PCR with one primer labeled at the 5′ end with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). PCR products were purified on 6% native polyacrylamide gels. DNA was eluted from crushed gel slices by diffusion and collected by ethanol precipitation. Wild-type RNAP, His-α, H265R-α, and/or LexA binding reactions (25 μl) contained ∼250,000 counts/min labeled DNA fragment in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. RNAP αΔ235 binding reactions contain 23 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 32.5 mm KCl, 5.6 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EDTA, 25 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. To compete nonspecific DNA binding by RNAP, heparin sulfate (10 μg/ml) was added for 1 min. 0.4 units of DNase I (Ambion) was then added, and incubation was continued for one additional minute. Reactions were terminated with an SDS/EDTA stop solution, and nucleic acids were collected by ethanol precipitation. Dried DNA pellets were counted directly in a scintillation counter and resuspended in loading buffer (99% formamide, 0.1% 1 n NaOH, 0.01% xylene cyanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) to yield 20,000 cycles/min/μl. G + A sequencing reactions were carried out as previously described (16Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). Samples were heated to 94 °C for 1-2 min prior to loading on prerun 8% sequencing gels. Autoradiography was performed with the PhosphorImaging system (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation of lane profiles was carried out with ImageQuant TL software (Amersham Biosciences BioSciences) without background correction or data normalization. Protein Purification and RNAP Reconstitution—RstRHis6 was prepared as previously described (4Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2640-2647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All in vitro transcription experiments were carried out with reconstituted E. coli RNAP holoenzymes. His-α and His-R265A-α were overexpressed from plasmids pRLG3538 and pRLG3545, respectively, and purified by nickel affinity chromatography as described previously (13Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Protein fractions were dialyzed against storage buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol), concentrated by centrifugation in Centricon filters (Millipore), and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. His-α preparations were estimated to be >90% pure by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For reconstituted RNAP, His-α and His-αΔ235 were overexpressed from plasmid pRLG3538(WT) or pRLG3657(αΔ235) and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. RNA polymerase β, β', and σ70 subunits were overexpressed, and holoenzyme was reconstituted in vitro as described previously (13Tang H. Severinov K. Goldfarb A. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4902-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The specific activities of reconstituted RNAP was determined using a promoter binding assay on lacUV5 (17Ross W. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The LexA Binding Site in PrstA Is Required for Maximal Transcription—To explore the possibility that the LexA binding site in PrstA overlaps with or contains a UP element, we replaced the LexA operator region (positions -40 to -58) (Fig. 1A) with SUB, a 19-bp sequence that was previously shown not to function as a UP element (8Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 15Rao L. Ross W. Appleman J.A. Gaal T.

The influence of this substitution on PrstA activity was assessed by in vitro transcription assays using purified E. coli RNA polymerase. The use of E. coli RNAP is justified by our previous findings that 1) The rstA promoter is efficiently transcribed in both E. coli and V. cholerae (5Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7035-7039Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 6Quinones M. Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), 2) LexA repression of PrstA transcription is observed in both V. cholerae and E. coli (6Quinones M. Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and 3) the αCTD of E. coli and V. cholerae RNAP (including all of the determinants important for DNA binding) are highly conserved (12Aiyar S.E. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A plasmid containing the lacUV5 promoter that lacks a UP element (14Ross W. Thompson J.F. Newlands J.T. Gourse R.L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) was included in the same reaction as a control. The quantity of rstA transcribed in vitro was reduced ∼4-fold when the DNA template carried the SUB sequence in place of the normal DNA sequence upstream of PrstA (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). These observations indicate that the LexA binding site in PrstA includes sequences that stimulate transcription in the absence of additional factors, consistent with the presence of a UP element in the substituted region (-40 to -58). To further investigate whether the LexA binding site includes a UP element, we performed in vitro transcription experiments using RNAP reconstituted with αΔ235, an α subunit that is deleted for the αCTD that directly contacts UP element DNA (18Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 19Blatter E.E. Ross W. Tang H. Gourse R.L. Ebright R.H.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In contrast to WT RNAP, the relative level of rstA transcripts generated by αΔ235 RNAP was reduced ∼4-fold (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 5). Furthermore, in reactions with αΔ235 RNAP, the relative level of rstA transcripts was not reduced when the LexA binding site was substituted by SUB in the template DNA (Fig. 1B, lanes 5-8). Thus, maximal transcription from PrstA requires both the upstream LexA binding site and the intact αCTD of RNAP. Taken together, these observations suggest that PrstA contains a UP element within or overlapping the LexA binding site. RNAP Binding to PrstA—DNase I protection assays were performed to physically define the sites in ig-2 bound by RNAP. Because specific binding of RNAP to promoter sequences is often obscured by nonspecific DNA binding, RNAP-DNA complexes were treated with heparin sulfate, a polyanion that irreversibly binds free RNAP, prior to DNase I treatment. Protection of the PrstA promoter by WT RNAP was observed from ∼-60 to ∼+25, including the core promoter elements (-10, -35, and transcription start site +1) and the region upstream of the core promoter elements (from ∼-45 to ∼-60; Fig. 2, see arrows). Similar to WT RNAP, αΔ235 RNAP protected the core promoter elements (although higher concentrations were required). However, αΔ235 RNAP did not protect sequences upstream of the -35 element (Fig. 2). Thus, the αCTD of RNAP is responsible for the upstream footprint. This region of the promoter overlaps the LexA binding site (-41 to -56) (Fig. 2A). DNase I protection assays were also performed on a promoter construct containing the SUB sequence in place of the LexA box (SUB RstA). WT RNAP protected the core promoter regions but protected sequences upstream of the -35 element weakly or not at all (Fig. 2), consistent with the footprints observed at other promoters lacking UP elements (e.g. lacUV5 and λPR; (21Kolb A. Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Lavigne M. Buckle M. Buc H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Ross W. Aiyar S.E. Salomon J. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5375-5383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Together, the data suggest that the upstream region of PrstA contains sequence-specific binding sites for the αCTDs. To confirm that the protections observed upstream of the -35 element resulted from interactions with the RNAP α subunit, as observed in previous studies with the rrnB P1 promoter (8Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), DNase I protection experiments were also carried out with purified E. coli α subunits (Fig. 3). Free α protected upstream sequences that include those protected by RNAP (Fig. 2), and protection was observed at the α concentrations similar to those required for binding to other UP elements (2 μm; Ref. 8Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). No protection was observed with αR265A (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8), a mutant α that does not bind DNA (8Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 20Gaal T. Ross W. Blatter E.E. Tang H. Jia X. Krishnan V.V. Assa-Munt N. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The sequences protected by purified α extended further upstream than those observed with RNAP holoenzyme (Fig. 2). Similar extended footprints have been observed previously with purified α at other promoters (8Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 19Blatter E.E. Ross W. Tang H. Gourse R.L. Ebright R.H. Cell. 1994; 78: 889-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). There is evidence in some promoters for binding of αCTD to DNA minor grooves upstream of the interactions detected in the rrnB P1 UP element (17Ross W. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Naryshkin N. Revyakin A. Kim Y. Mekler V. Ebright R.H. Cell. 2000; 101: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, it is also possible that the extended footprint with free α simply reflects nonphysiologically relevant interactions of additional α subunits with additional A + T-rich upstream sequences. Although small effects on the transcription of α binding to rstA sequences upstream of -60 cannot be ruled out, the effects of the SUB mutation on PrstA transcription (Fig. 1B) suggests that the -41 to -58 region is sufficient to account for the major effects of αCTD binding on rstA transcription stimulation. To assess whether LexA and α compete for binding to the same site, both proteins were combined with the DNA template at concentrations sufficient to protect their respective binding sites (Fig. 3). Lane 9 shows the LexA footprint in the absence of α. As the α concentration was increased (Fig 3, lanes 11 and 12), protection of the LexA site was reduced, indicating that α inhibits LexA binding. In regions distal to the position -64, where LexA binding does not obscure the α footprint, α binding was also reduced when both proteins were added to the DNA. The simplest interpretation of these footprint data is that the two proteins directly compete for binding to overlapping DNA sites (see also “Discussion”). Such mutual inhibition likely occurs by a direct steric mechanism. The αCTD Is Required for LexA Repression of PrstA in Vitro— Our discovery of a UP element at PrstA plus our finding that free α and LexA compete for binding to upstream DNA, suggests that the mechanism of LexA repression is to physically occlude αCTD from its binding site upstream of PrstA. To further test this model, we investigated whether LexA could repress PrstA transcription catalyzed by reconstituted αΔ235 RNAP, which lacks the αCTD. The plasmid templates for these experiments were p770ig-2 (-160 to +92) and pRLG593 carrying the lacUV5 promoter as a control. LexA specifically reduced PrstA transcription catalyzed by WT RNAP (Fig. 4, lanes 1-4). At high LexA concentrations, there was an ∼5-fold reduction in the level of rstA transcripts, whereas it had little or no effect on transcription from the control lacUV5 template. This partial repression by LexA in vitro is similar to previous in vivo measurements of LexA repression (6Quinones M. Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and is strikingly similar to the 4-fold enhancement of rstA transcription provided by the UP element (Fig. 1B). RstR was a more potent repressor of rstA transcription than LexA, reducing transcription to nearly undetectable levels (Fig. 4, lane 5). In contrast to WT RNAP, rstA transcription by αΔ235 RNAP was not repressed by LexA (Fig. 4, lanes 6-9). Identical results were obtained when the concentration of αΔ235 RNAP was lowered from 40 nm to 20 nm (data not shown). These data indicate that LexA repression of PrstA transcription results from inhibition of αCTD binding to the rstA UP element. Transcription by αΔ235 RNAP was slightly stimulated (∼50%) by LexA (Fig. 4, lanes 6-9). This weak stimulation could be due to fortuitous protein-protein contacts between LexA and αΔ235 RNAP, or through structural changes in promoter DNA upon LexA binding. RstR was still a potent repressor of rstA transcription catalyzed by αΔ235 RNAP (Fig. 4, lane 10), indicating that RstR functions by blocking RNAP binding to the core promoter elements or represses a later step in transcription initiation. These observations demonstrate that LexA and RstR independently repress PrstA in the absence of other cellular factors and that LexA-mediated repression of transcription from PrstA requires the C-terminal domain of α. Our previous studies of the regulation of PrstA revealed that a host repressor, LexA, and the CTXΦ-encoded repressor RstR both repress transcription from PrstA. Using in vitro transcription assays, we showed here that each of these repressors acts directly on PrstA to inhibit transcription. The LexA binding site in ig-2 is centered -48.5 bp from the start of rstA transcription; given its location and high A + T content, we speculated that it overlaps with a binding site for the C-terminal domain (αCTD) of the α subunit of RNAP. Such α binding sites in other highly active promoters are known as UP elements (8Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 11Gourse R.L. Ross W. Gaal T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Our experimental observations support this hypothesis. High level transcription from PrstA was dependent on specific sequences between positions -40 and -58 overlapping the LexA binding site. Replacement of the LexA box in this region with a sequence (SUB) that does not bind to the αCTD significantly reduced transcription from PrstA. The stimulatory effect of this promoter site on PrstA transcription was dependent upon the αCTD of RNAP; in vitro transcription with reconstituted RNAP deleted for the αCTD yielded a pronounced reduction in the level of transcripts from wild-type PrstA but did not reduce transcript levels from a mutant PrstA containing the SUB sequence in place of the LexA box. In DNase I protection experiments, RNA polymerase holoenzyme protected several sites clustered around positions -46 and -58 that likely represent interactions with the αCTD (Fig. 2). α subunit interactions in the context of the RNAP holoenzyme have been observed at a series of positions in the minor groove upstream of the -35 hexamer (23Naryshkin N. Revyakin A. Kim Y. Mekler V. Ebright R.H. Cell. 2000; 101: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24Ross W. Ernst A. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 491-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 25Benoff B. Yang H. Lawson C.L. Parkinson G. Liu J. Blatter E. Ebright Y.W. Berman H.M. Ebright R.H. Science. 2002; 297: 1562-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Typically, the interactions most significant for function are just upstream of the -35 hexamer. In the E. coli rrnB P1 UP element, these sites are centered at -41 and -52 and are referred to as the proximal and distal subsites, respectively (10Estrem S.T. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9761-9766Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 26Estrem S.T. Ross W. Gaal T. Chen Z.W. Niu W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2134-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Because the SUB mutation, which extends from ∼-41 to -58 in the rstA promoter, eliminated effects of upstream sequences on transcription, it is likely that this region contains the α binding sites corresponding to the proximal and distal subsites. Determining the precise limits of the α-DNA interactions in the rstA promoter region will require the use of other reagents (e.g. hydroxyl radical footprinting). LexA and free α competed for binding to this region. Our findings strongly suggest that LexA represses transcription from PrstA by blocking the binding of the αCTD to the promoter UP element. It is likely that αCTD binds to successive minor grooves in the PrstA UP element (e.g. from ∼-40 to ∼-60), similar to its position in other characterized UP elements (8Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 23Naryshkin N. Revyakin A. Kim Y. Mekler V. Ebright R.H.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2134-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The LexA dimer interacts with two successive major grooves using a winged helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif (27Dumoulin P. Ebright R.H. Knegtel R. Kaptein R. Granger-Schnarr M. Schnarr M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4279-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). With its binding site centered at position -48.5, it is likely that LexA would occupy the same face-of-the-helix as the αCTD and would overlap with and/or occlude DNA backbone positions along the minor groove that would be required for αCTD binding. Although UP elements sometimes overlap with binding sites for other DNA binding proteins (28Meijer W.J. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1166-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and it has been proposed previously that repressors could act by blocking binding of the α subunits of RNAP to a UP element (26Estrem S.T. Ross W. Gaal T. Chen Z.W. Niu W. Ebright R.H. Gourse R.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2134-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 29Camacho A. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), to our knowledge our findings represent the first direct demonstration of this type of transcription regulation. This mechanism could, at least in part, explain SOS control of some other promoters. For example, the ssb gene in E. coli has a LexA box centered at position -46.5 (30Keseler I.M. Collado-Vides J. Gama-Castro S. Ingraham J. Paley S. Paulsen I.T. Peralta-Gil M. Karp P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), where LexA binding may also block access of the αCTD to a promoter UP element. A rationale for LexA-mediated repression of high level transcription of SOS genes could be to enable transient bursts of expression of DNA repair genes whose function is important for the amelioration of cellular stress. LexA cleavage during an SOS response would allow for transient high level expression (promoted by αCTD binding to the unoccupied LexA box) of SOS genes; high level expression would be relatively short-lived because resynthesis of LexA after repair of DNA damage would restore expression of these genes to their basal state. The αCTD is a common target for regulatory factors in bacteria. Usually these transcription factor-αCTD interactions are positive, leading to increased transcription (9Busby S. Ebright R.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 743-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), but in some cases, these interactions result in transcription repression. Examples include IclR of E. coli (which has been proposed to repress the aceB promoter by relocation of the αCTD to an upstream position less favorable for stimulating transcription (31Yamamoto K. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)), GalR (where αCTD-GalR interactions inhibit a step in transcription after closed complex formation (32Choy H.E. Park S.W. Aki T. Parrack P. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Adhya S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4523-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 33Choy H.E. Hanger R.R. Aki T. Mahoney M. Murakami K. Ishihama A. Adhya S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)), and Spx of Bacillus subtilis (which has been described as an “anti-α” factor that binds to the αCTD and inhibits transcription initiation (34Newberry K.J. Nakano S. Zuber P. Brennan R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15839-15844Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 35Nakano S. Nakano M.M. Zhang Y. Leelakriangsak M. Zuber P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4233-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, phage T4 encodes factors that ADP-ribosylate the residue in α that is most critical for UP element binding, resulting in inhibition of host transcription and thus an increase in T4 early transcription (36Tiemann B. Depping R. Gineikiene E. Kaliniene L. Nivinskas R. Ruger W. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7262-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The data presented here indicate that LexA, the global SOS repressor, can inhibit transcription initiation in yet another manner, by selectively competing for α subunit binding to a UP element in the primary promoter of CTXΦ."

RegB specifically cleaves GGAG sequences found in intergenic regions, mainly in translation initiation sites. Its activity is very low but can be enhanced up to 100-fold by the ribosomal 30 S subunit or by ribosomal protein S1. RegB has no significant sequence homology to any known protein. Here we used NMR to solve the structure of RegB and map its interactions with two RNA substrates. We also generated a collection of mutants affected in RegB function. Our results show that, despite the absence of any sequence homology, RegB has structural similarities with two Escherichia coli ribonucleases involved in mRNA inactivation on translating ribosomes: YoeB and RelE. Although these ribonucleases have different catalytic sites, we propose that RegB is a new member of the RelE/YoeB structural and functional family of ribonucleases specialized in mRNA inactivation within the ribosome.

Control of messenger RNA decay is a key factor in the regulation of gene expression. Indeed, the expression level of a protein is strongly influenced by the concentration of its mRNA, which, in turn, depends on its synthesis and degradation rates (1Wilusz C.J. Wilusz J. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Perturbation of mRNA stability can lead to dramatic effects on cell physiology and in some cases can induce cancer (2Audic Y. Hartley R.S. Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 479-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, the way the cell controls the lifetime of its mRNA is still a poorly understood aspect in the biology of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In Escherichia coli, it is generally agreed that the initiation of mRNA degradation is induced by an endoribonucleolytic cleavage mediated by ribonucleases E and G with the occasional involvement of RNases III and P (3Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4658-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 4Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). These ribonucleases all generate 5′-phosphate RNA fragments (RNases E, G, and III are metallo-enzymes; RNase P is a ribozyme), have broad specificity, and are involved in other cellular functions. RNases E and G, for example, participate in the maturation of 9 S and 16 S rRNA (5Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2878-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and RNase E is necessary for tRNA processing (6Li Z. Deutscher M.P. RNA. 2002; 8: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).Ribonuclease RegB is radically different from the ribonucleases described above. RegB is involved in the control of the bacteriophage T4 multiplication cycle. It is produced in the early stage of viral infection and facilitates the transition between the early and middle phases of the viral cycle by inactivating early mRNAs (7Uzan M. Favre R. Brody E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8885-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). RegB cleaves its substrates with high specificity in the middle of the GGAG motif found in the ribosome-binding site of most prokaryotic mRNAs (Shine-Dalgarno sequence). Strikingly, it remains active throughout the entire lytic cycle but does not act on middle or late mRNA (8Sanson B. Hu R.-M Troitskayadagger E. Mathy N. Uzan M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast with RNases E, G, III, and P, RegB is only involved in this task and is certainly one of the most specific ribonucleases described to date. It only cleaves GGAG, or to a lesser extent and with reduced efficiency, GGAU sequences (7Uzan M. Favre R. Brody E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8885-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Ruckman J. Parma D. Tuerk C. Hall D.H. Gold L. New Biol. 1989; 1: 54-56PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it does not cleave all such sequences: those present in coding sequences and in middle or late T4 mRNAs are generally resistant (10Sanson B. Uzan M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 141-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By transforming E. coli cells with two plasmids, one coding for RegB, the other for a natural T4 mRNA, it was demonstrated that the pattern of sensitivity observed in vivo can be reproduced in the absence of any other T4 factor, suggesting that additional cleavage determinants are intrinsic to the RNA. In the absence of evidence for additional sequence determinants, we postulated that RegB may recognize a particular RNA structure, and indeed have shown that a particular secondary structure correlates with RNA susceptibility to cleavage (11Lebars I. Hu R.-M Lallemand J.-Y. Uzan M. Bontems F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have also shown that RegB acts as a transphosphorylase, producing 3′-phosphate oligoribonucleotides (7Uzan M. Favre R. Brody E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8885-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Saïda F. Uzan M. Bontems F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Finally, RegB activity as measured in vitro is very low: ∼10-3 mol of substrate are cleaved per mole of enzyme per minute, but this activity is enhanced by a factor up to 100 in the presence of the ribosomal subunit 30 S or of the ribosomal protein S1 (13Ruckman J. Ringquist S Brody E Gold L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26655-26662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lebars I. Hu R.-M Lallemand J.-Y. Uzan M. Bontems F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).These particular features of RegB, especially the involvement of ribosome components in its activity, motivated us to determine its three-dimensional structure and to study its mechanism of action using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and biochemical methods. RegB is a highly toxic protein. It cannot be overproduced in E. coli for structural purposes, especially when isotopic enrichment is required (14Saïda F. Odaert B. Uzan M. Bontems F. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 34: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We overcame this obstacle by isolating a non-toxic point mutant (RegB-H48A) that retains RegB structural integrity and ability to bind substrates (12Saïda F. Uzan M. Bontems F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of RegB and present a map of the interaction sites between the enzyme and two different RNA substrates. We also took advantage of RegB toxicity to identify, by random and site-directed mutagenesis, residues involved in RNA binding or processing. Our results show that, despite the absence of any sequence similarities and a different organization of the active site residues, RegB is structurally related to ribonucleases YoeB and RelE. Interestingly, YoeB and RelE are involved in mRNA inactivation, after nutritional stress, and act on translating messengers. Accordingly, we propose the existence of a new specialized family of transphosphorylases involved in messenger inactivation within the ribosome.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—Typically, a 50-ml overnight culture of the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)-pLysS, transformed with plasmid pEH48A (14Saïda F. Odaert B. Uzan M. Bontems F. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 34: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), was used to inoculate 1 liter of M9 minimal medium (Na2HPO4, 6 g·liter-1 ;KH2PO4, 3 g·liter-1; NaCl, 0.5 g·liter-1; MgSO4, 1 mm; CaCl2, 1.10-4 m) supplemented with 1.0 g·liter-115NH4Cl and 4 g·liter-1 glucose or 2.0 g·liter-1 [13C]glucose, leading to uniformly labeled 15N or 15N/13C samples. Protein expression was induced at A600 = 0.6 using 1.0 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested 3 h later and disrupted by sonication, and the protein was purified on a Talon resin (Clontech) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The protein was then concentrated to ∼0.7 mm, and the elution buffer was exchanged against 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.0), 300 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm dithiothreitol using Micro Bio-spin chromatography columns (Bio-Rad).RNA Synthesis—The S22loop and S26 oligoribonucleotides were synthesized chemically on an Amersham Biosciences LKB Gene Assembler Plus apparatus using Amersham Biosciences polystyrene beads for primer support and phenoxyacetyl β-RNA phosphoramidites. The protocol was adapted from the one used for DNA synthesis, the main differences being the increase in coupling time (20 min) and the use of 5-ethylthio-1H-tetrazol as activator (15Snoussi K. Nonin-Lecomte S. Leroy J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The terminal 5′-O-dimethoxytrityl group was removed on the synthesizer. The oligoribonucleotides were cleaved from the support and unprotected according to Leroy and co-workers (15Snoussi K. Nonin-Lecomte S. Leroy J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Full-length product final yield was >95% in both cases. Accordingly, the two oligoribonucleotides were used without purification.NMR Experiments—All NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance Z-gradient cryoprobe. They were processed using XWINNMR 3.0 (Bruker) and analyzed with Sparky software (University of California San Francisco, Thomas L. Goddard). 1H and 13C chemical shifts were referenced to 3-(trimethylsilyl)-propionic acid-D4. 15N chemical shifts were indirectly referenced from the γ15N/γ1H ratio (16Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). All spectra were measured at 305 K. The backbone assignment was performed on samples of 13C/15N-labeled protein by recording HNCO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNHA, and HBHA(CBCACO)NH triple resonance experiments. Most aliphatic side-chain 1H and 13C frequencies were assigned using an HCCH-TOCSY 5The abbreviations used are: TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence. spectrum recorded on an identical sample dissolved in D2O. A similar experiment was also recorded to try to determine the aromatic 1H and 13C frequencies, but the signal-to-noise ratio was too low to allow its exploitation. Thus, most aromatic 1H and 13C frequencies were identified by using an aromatic 13C-NOESY-HSQC, recorded in D2O on a 13C/15 N sample and two TOCSY and NOESY spectra recorded in D2O on a 15N-labeled sample. The backbone assignment was further verified, and RegB secondary structure and topology were identified through the analysis of the NOE correlations observed in two 15N-NOESY-HSQC experiments (120- and 60-ms mixing time, recorded on an 15N-labeled sample), an aliphatic 13C-NOESY-HSQC experiment (60-ms mixing time, recorded on a 13C/15N-labeled sample dissolved in D2O) and two two-dimensional-NOESY experiments (120- and 60-ms mixing time, recorded on the 15N-labeled sample after H2O to D2O exchange). The NOE correlations used to calculate the structure were picked from the 60-ms 15N-NOESY-HSQC spectrum, from two 60-ms aliphatic 13C-NOESY-HSQC spectra recorded in D2O and H2O and from the 60-ms two-dimensional-NOESY spectrum.RNA binding studies were performed on a 0.2 mm15N-labeled RegB sample in which aliquots of lyophilized RNA were dissolved. Prior to lyophilization, the RNA was dialyzed against pure water and pH neutralized. Each titration point was done by removing the NMR sample from the tube, mixing it with lyophilized RNA and returning it to the tube. Eight 1H-15N-HSQC were recorded for each series, corresponding to RNA/protein ratios of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, and 3. All recording parameters were kept rigorously identical; the only modifications concerned probe tuning and field shimming. All spectra were processed identically.Structure Calculation—First, the 15N- and 13C-NOESY-HSQC spectra were analyzed manually to determine the secondary structure elements and the topology of the RegB structure (see supplemental Fig. S1). The RegB structure was then calculated with the INCA software (17Savarin P. Zinn-Justin S. Gilquin B. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 19: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that used mainly unassigned NOE cross-peaks to perform the structure determination. Typically, the software carried out 22 calculation cycles, each corresponding to an automatic assignment, a structure calculation, and an analysis step. The assignment step converts each NOE cross-peak to a list of possible constraints based on the distances observed in the structures calculated in the preceding cycle. This list is reduced at each cycle, ending, as often as possible, with a single possibility. The calculation step carries out the calculation of 500 structures from the constraint lists by simulated annealing. The 20 best are selected during the analysis step. The program was fed with two lists of unassigned NOE correlations picked from the 60-ms 13C- and 15N-NOE-HSQC spectra, with the two corresponding lists of 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shifts, with a list of distance constraints derived from the identified hydrogen bonds and from manually assigned NOEs, and finally with a list of phi and psi dihedral angle constraints derived from the TALOS analysis of the backbone chemical shifts (18Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar). In the first runs, the assigned distance constraints were derived from the NOE characteristic of the secondary structure elements and of the topology, from several aromatic proton-aromatic proton and aromatic proton-aliphatic proton NOEs and finally from a small number of hydrogen bonds (identified from an H2O-D2O exchange experiment). Similarly, only the phi and psi angles of residues belonging to the unambiguously identified helix and strands were constrained. To favor the convergence of the process (the number of correct structures over the total number of calculated structures), we added, in the last runs, several constraints corresponding to the hydrogen bonds clearly formed in the secondary structure elements and to phi-psi angles predicted by TALOS and compatible with the structures obtained in the previous runs. The coordinates of 15 structures have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank with accession code 2HX6.Random Mutagenesis—Error-prone PCR-mediated mutagenesis was performed using the Taq polymerase in the presence of a balanced desoxyribonucleoside pool, but witha1to10 Mn2+/Mg2+ ratio. 300 pm DNA fragments were amplified by 22 PCR cycles using 3 Taq units in the presence of 0.4 pm oligonucleotides, 0.2 mm each dNTP, 3 mm Mg2+, and 0.3 mm Mn2+. The mutagenesis protocol was independently applied to the 5′-terminal (nucleotides 1-240 and amino-acids 1-80) and 3′-terminal (nucleotides 241-459 and amino-acids 81-153) regions of the gene. After digestion by NdeI and EcoRI (5′-terminal region) or by EcoRI and XhoI (3′-terminal region), the fragments were ligated, respectively, into a pET15b derivative containing the wild-type 3′-terminal region of regB or a pET28b derivative containing the wild-type 5′-terminal region of regB. The ligation mixture was directly used to transform an XL1-Blue E. coli strain, and the viable clones were selected and amplified. Protein expression was induced in the XL1-Blue strain with a λCE6 phage (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. The genes yielding full-length proteins were subsequently sequenced.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Seven regB point mutants (R11Q, E19A, E19V, E21V, D51G, R56L, and E105A) were obtained from the pARNU2 plasmid, with the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit and by using the manufacturer's (Stratagene) recommended protocol. After the PCR, the mutated plasmid was amplified in the XL10-Gold strain provided in the kit and sequenced. An alteration of the enzyme toxicity was then tested by transforming a BL21(DE3) strain (for which the wild-type pARNU2 plasmid is lethal, even in the absence of induction) with 6 ng of each mutated plasmid except E19A and E19V, for which 60 ng was used. The ability of the transformants to overproduce the protein was verified, and minipreps were analyzed by sequencing to check the absence of secondary mutations.RESULTSChoice of the Mutant Protein and the RNA Substrates—RegB is highly toxic to E. coli, preventing its overproduction from standard expression vectors (19Saïda F. Uzan M. Lallemand J.-Y. Bontems F. Biotechnol. Prog. 2003; 19: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 20Uzan M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We assumed that this toxicity was likely due to its ribonuclease activity, the GGAG motif being present in ∼30% of the Shine-Dalgarno sites of E. coli mRNAs (21Barrick D. Villanueba K. Childs J. Kalil R. Schneider T.D. Lawrence C.E. Gold L. Stormo G.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We also assumed that RegB catalytic mechanism involves at least one histidine residue. Accordingly, as previously reported, we mutated each RegB histidine residue to alanine and obtained two non-toxic mutants, H48A and H68A (12Saïda F. Uzan M. Bontems F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Comparison of the HSQC spectra of these two mutants with that of another independently identified inactive mutant (R52L) indicates that these proteins have the same three-dimensional structure. In addition, the H86A mutant conserves 20% of the wild-type activity, and the H48A and H68A (but not R52L) were shown to bind RegB substrates with the same affinity as the wild-type protein. All this strongly suggests that the three mutants are good structural models of the wild-type protein (12Saïda F. Uzan M. Bontems F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We found that the H68A mutant was difficult to overproduce due to its residual activity but obtained a good production yield (∼20 mg·liter-1) for the H48A mutant (14Saïda F. Odaert B. Uzan M. Bontems F. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 34: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which was thus chosen for further analysis.All the T4 Shine-Dalgarno sequences cleaved by RegB have now been identified, 6M. Uzan, unpublished data. but the RegB recognition site remains unknown. All natural substrates tested to date require the presence of the S1 ribosomal protein for efficient cleavage. On the other hand, we already studied several non-natural RegB substrates from a SELEX analysis (11Lebars I. Hu R.-M Lallemand J.-Y. Uzan M. Bontems F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We decided to use two of them, namely the S26 (CGUGGAGACAGACCACACCACG) and the S22loop (GGUGCGAGAAAACGGAGCACC). Both are cleaved by RegB alone but with different efficiencies. The S22loop RNA is cleaved well in the absence of S1 (turnover 20 × 10-3 min-1), whereas S26 requires S1 to reach the same level (8 × 10-3 min-1 in the absence of S1 and 20 × 10-3 min-1 in its presence). The secondary structures of these two RNAs are known (11Lebars I. Hu R.-M Lallemand J.-Y. Uzan M. Bontems F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and their molecular masses (8 kDa) are low compared with that of the protein (18 kDa). Thus, even in the event of slow ligand exchange, we anticipated that the quality of the protein NMR spectra would not be significantly affected by substrate binding.RegB Structure—The superposition of 15 structures obtained at the end of the last computation run is presented in Fig. 1. These structures present no systematic distance violations larger than 0.5 Å or systematic dihedral violations larger than 5°. The covalent geometry is correct (Table 1). 93% of the residues are in the most favorable and additional allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The core of the protein, formed by the first four β-strands and the three α-helices, is correctly defined (root mean square deviation: 0.72 ± 0.11 Å). The loop regions and the last β-strand are more dispersed, but this is mainly due to the fact that we were not able to collect enough data on them (see supplemental Fig. S1 for details about the structure calculation process).TABLE 1NMR and refinement statisticsNMR constraintsDistance constraintsA priori assigned NOEaNumber of constraints assigned by the user at the beginning of the calculation process.282A posteriori unambiguous NOEbNumber of constraints assigned by the program, at the end of the calculation process, from the peaks identified in the 15N and 13C NOE-HSQC experiments.1162A posteriori ambiguous NOEcNumber of constraints still ambiguous at the end of the calculation process.311Hydrogen bonds59Distance repartitionIntra-residual634Sequential359Medium range (i - j ≤ 4)295Long range215Dihedral angle constraintsPhi93Psi93Structure statisticsdMean (maximal - minimal) values.ViolationseNone of the observed violations are systematic.

Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 1, the three α-helices and the β-sheet are amphipathic. In particular, one side of the β-sheet, except for one residue (Arg132), is formed only of hydrophobic residues. The three helices are associated through a series of hydrophobic contacts. A first cluster involves Leu14, Phe18, Phe22, and Ile25 (helix 1); Leu50 and Ile54 (helix 2); and Val63, Phe64, and Phe67 (helix 3). A second cluster is formed of Ile29, Ala32, and Ala35 (helix 1) and Val74 and Leu81 (helix 3). These helices are packed against the hydrophobic side of the β-sheet. The first helix interacts mainly with the first strand through interactions between Leu25, Leu29, Ala32, and Ala35 (helix 1) and Phe41, Leu63, and Tyr65 (strand 1), the second helix is associated to the fourth strand through contacts between Leu49 (helix 2) and Ala134 (strand 4), and the third helix is associated with the second, third, and fourth strands through contacts between Leu66, Ile70, Val77, and Phe80 (helix 3); Leu104 and Ile106 (strand 2); Leu111, Leu113, Phe115, and Val117 (strand 3); and Leu129, Cys131, and Ala134 (strand 4). In contrast, the exposed surface is mainly hydrophilic, with the noticeable exception of the Trp112, Cys118, Cys131, Met133, and Ile135 region of the β-sheet. Most of the surface residues are charged, resulting in a large negative potential surface on the helical side of the protein and a completely positive potential surface on the opposite side (Fig. 1).RNA Binding Study—The 1H-15N HSQC experiment provides a fingerprint of the protein structure, because any structural or environmental change will modify the spectrum. Fig. 2 displays zooms of superposed HSQC spectra of RegB at different RNA/protein ratios. The left and right panels correspond to the RegB/S26 and RegB/S22 titration, respectively. Side chains Asn and Gln NH2 correlations are identified by a line (upper panels).FIGURE 2Analysis of the interactions between RegB and two substrates. The four panels represent zooms on superimposed HSQC recorded at different RNA/protein ratios. The left (A and B) and right (C and D) panels correspond to the RegB/S26 and RegB/S22loop titrations, respectively. The Asn and Gln NH2 side-chain correlations are identified by lines (A and C). The reference experiment (RNA/protein ratio of zero) is in red. The last experiment (RNA/protein ratio of three) is in green. The interpretation of the observed frequency and intensity variations is detailed under “Results.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Clearly, many peaks (e.g. Arg56, Ser82, Asn12-NH2, and Asn137-NH2 (upper panels) or Leu75 and Phe115 (lower panels)) are invariant in all experiments, and their intensities in the reference (in red) or in the last titration map (in green) appear similar, although they vary by 1.5- to 2-fold. Others peaks show moderate (Phe41, Asn78-NH2, Phe18, Cys118, and Cys131) or large (Gln47-NH2, Asn121-NH2, His42, and Leu43) chemical shift changes as substrate concentrations increase. These changes are correlated with larger variations of intensity (3- to 4-fold), particularly notable for His42 and Leu43 (lower panels) and Ser46 (upper panels), for example. Interestingly, all modifications appear very similar in the RegB/S26 and RegB/S22 titrations. The good superposition of most peaks shows that all spectra were actually recorded in reproducible conditions. The intensity variation of these peaks is probably due to the system size increase (∼18 kDa for the free protein, 25 kDa for the complex). This is supported by the observation that intensity changes are generally less pronounced for the side chains. However, we could not exclude the possibility that RNA addition induces partial aggregation of RegB. The continuous chemical shift variation indicates that the exchange frequency between protein free and bound states is larger than the difference in frequencies characterizing the two states: 2πνex ≫ |ωfree - ωbound|. The large intensity variation corresponds to the case where |ωfree - ωbound| comes close to 2πνex, i.e. to the peaks presenting the largest frequency variation. Accordingly, considering that the largest peak shift is ∼0.25 ppm (Asn121), we calculate that the exchange frequency is larger than 150 Hz and the substrate-enzyme complex lifetime smaller than 7 ms. We can also fit the shift function of the protein/RNA ratio to a simple equilibrium model E + S ↔ ES, giving rise to an equilibrium constant of ∼30 μm.The chemical shift differences between the first (reference) and the third (RNA/RegB ratio of 0.5) 1H-15N-HSQC spectra are reported for both substrates in Fig. 3 and indicate that the perturbed amino acids are clustered in three main regions. The first region (Asn4-Ile29) corresponds to the N terminus and the beginning of the first α-helix. The second cluster is formed by the first β-strand and the second α-helix. The third cluster is composed of the fourth β-strand and the preceding loop. As previously shown, these elements are close in space. The first and fourth strands are connected in the β-sheet. The first and second helices are associated and make contact with the first and fourth strands. In addition, the loop between the first helix and the first strand is in the vicinity of the loop preceding the fourth strand (Fig. 1). The figure also shows that the perturbation pattern is globally similar for the two substrates. Some details are even well conserved, such as the succession of perturbed (Ile25, Asn27, and Ile29) and non-perturbed (Asn26 and Glu28) residues at the end of the first α-helix, and the involvement of Ile58 and Glu60. However, there are also some variations: the relative shift intensities of Leu43 and Ser46 and the involvement of Asn78 are different. This suggests that, although the two substrates are bound similarly, the details of the intera"
