https://openalex.org/W2316180691,"The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Brazil has been linked to substantial increases in fetal abnormalities and microcephaly. However, information about the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms connecting viral infection to these defects remains limited. In this study we have examined the expression of receptors implicated in cell entry of several enveloped viruses including ZIKV across diverse cell types in the developing brain. Using single-cell RNA-seq and immunohistochemistry, we found that the candidate viral entry receptor AXL is highly expressed by human radial glial cells, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia in developing human cortex and by progenitor cells in developing retina. We also show that AXL expression in radial glia is conserved in developing mouse and ferret cortex and in human stem cell-derived cerebral organoids, highlighting multiple experimental systems that could be applied to study mechanisms of ZIKV infectivity and effects on brain development."

Here, we recorded BLA neurons during the retrieval of associative memories and used optogenetic-mediated phototagging to identify populations of neurons that synapse in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the central amygdala (CeA), or ventral hippocampus (vHPC). We found that despite heterogeneous neural responses within each population, the proportions of BLA-NAc neurons excited by reward predictive cues and of BLA-CeA neurons excited by aversion predictive cues were higher than within the entire BLA. Although the BLA-vHPC projection is known to drive behaviors of innate negative valence, these neurons did not preferentially code for learned negative valence. Together, these findings suggest that valence encoding in the BLA is at least partially mediated via divergent activity of anatomically defined neural populations.

The ability to appropriately recognize stimuli imbued with either positive or negative valence is critical for survival as well as mental health. The neural circuits underlying the assignment of valence to environmental stimuli are thought to be highly conserved in the mammalian brain (Janak and Tye, 2015Janak P.H. Tye K.M.

The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) receives inputs from multiple sensory modalities (Bordi and LeDoux, 1992Bordi F. LeDoux J.

Previous evidence suggests that valence assignment during memory retrieval is supported by differences in real-time activity among anatomically defined populations of BLA neurons. The BLA and nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been implicated in the formation of cue-reward associations (Ambroggi et al., 2008Ambroggi F. Ishikawa A. Fields H.L. Nicola S.M.

By contrast, the assignment of negative valence has been linked to BLA projections to the central amygdala (CeA; Amorapanth et al., 1999Amorapanth P. Nader K. LeDoux J.E.

Valence processing in the BLA may also mediate innate emotional states; both the BLA and the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) are linked to anxiety (Adhikari, 2014Adhikari A.

We recently showed that projection-target-defined populations of BLA neurons play distinct roles in valence learning (Namburi et al., 2015bNamburi P. Beyeler A. Yorozu S. Calhoon G.G. Halbert S.A. Wichmann R. Holden S.S. Mertens K.L. Anahtar M. Felix-Ortiz A.C. et al.A circuit mechanism for differentiating positive and negative associations.Nature. 2015; 520: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, the real-time activity and mechanisms by which the BLA produces distinct emotional and motivational states have yet to be identified. Here, we hypothesized that during the retrieval of positive or negative associative memories, opposite valences are encoded by anatomically divergent BLA circuits. Using an intersectional, dual-virus approach, we employed optogenetic-mediated “phototagging” in combination with large-scale in vivo electrophysiological recordings to reveal the specific neural code of BLA neurons that synapse in the NAc, CeA, or vHPC, in response to the presentation of cues associated with either rewarding or aversive outcomes. In order to “photoidentify” distinct populations of BLA neurons, we used a dual-virus approach to express the light-activated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in a subpopulation of BLA neurons, defined by axonal termination within a specific downstream region (NAc, CeA, or vHPC; Figure 1A). To this end, we used an anterograde viral vector carrying a construct allowing for cre-dependent ChR2 expression in the BLA and a retrograde viral vector carrying cre-recombinase in the downstream target (see Experimental Procedures; Nieh et al., 2015Nieh E.H. Matthews G.A. Allsop S.A. Presbrey K.N. Leppla C.A. Wichmann R. Neve R. Wildes C.P. Tye K.M.

Herry C. Grenier F. Ehrlich I. Gründemann J. Fadok J.P. Müller C. Letzkus J.J. Lüthi A. Long-range connectivity defines behavioral specificity of amygdala neurons.Neuron. 2014; 81: 428-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). This strategy allows specific targeting and identification of BLA neurons terminating in the region of interest and avoids spurious identification of BLA neurons sending axons of passage through this region, which is a shortcoming of electrical and optical antidromic stimulation. So that we could evaluate the activity of photoidentified cells during valence retrieval, we trained mice to discriminate between two auditory stimuli: one associated with a rewarding outcome of positive valence (sucrose) and the second associated with an aversive outcome of negative valence (quinine; Figures 1B and 1C). After mice learned the reward predictive significance of the conditioned stimulus associated with sucrose delivery (CS-S), as indicated by licking after tone onset and before the delivery of sucrose (Figures 1C and 1D), we introduced a second auditory conditioned stimulus (CS-Q) associated with the delivery of a bitter tastant (quinine; Figure 1B). Mice initially generalized the two tones, exhibiting licking responses for both the CS-S and CS-Q, and progressively learned to discriminate between the two stimuli (Figure 1E; Movie S1). When the mice reached performance criteria for the sucrose association (at least 70% of sucrose deliveries collected during the session) and for the quinine association (at least 70% of quinine deliveries avoided during the session), we performed acute recordings in the BLA over 2 successive days in 21 animals (Figures 1D–1G and S1). To determine the functional response profiles of BLA neurons, we performed recordings with silicon optrodes (Figure 2A), and analyzed neural data after histological confirmation of the placement of the recording electrodes and of the spread of viral expression (Figures 1G, S1, and S2A). During each recording session, ∼30 sucrose and ∼30 quinine trials were presented, and the firing rate of every isolated unit was analyzed in response to the two cues. Of the 1,626 neurons recorded in the BLA, 50% of the neurons were task responsive, meaning that they showed a significant firing rate change in response to one or both cues (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.01; Figures 2B–2D; Table S1). 28% of neurons significantly changed firing rate selectively during the conditioned stimulus associated with sucrose (CS-S) and 9% selectively during the conditioned stimulus associated with quinine (CS-Q). 13% of the units significantly changed their firing rate in response to both cues in a qualitatively similar manner (either excitatory or inhibitory responses), which we termed the “same” way, and less than one percent changed their firing rate in response to both cues in qualitatively distinct directions, which we termed “opposite” ways (Figure 2C). When averaging the proportion of cells responding with excitation or inhibition within the three categories (responsive to the CS-S only, responsive to the CS-Q only, and responsive to both cues in the same way), we found that 53% ± 2% of the units showed excitatory responses, while 47% ± 2% showed inhibitory responses (Figure 2E, illustrated as percentage of total units). We also tested the response of each unit to the unconditioned stimulus (US; Figure S2) and found that 32% of the units responding to the CS also significantly changed their firing rate during the first 500 ms after the delivery of the US (sucrose or quinine), while 18% responded to the US without changing their firing rate to the cues (Figures S2C and S2D). Overall, 50% of the units responded to the delivery of the US (Figure S2E). 37% of the units responded only during the sucrose delivery, 6% responded only during quinine delivery, and 7% responded during both US deliveries (5.7% in a “same” qualitative way and 1.5% in qualitatively “opposite” ways; Figures S2E and S2F). Overall, we found that more cells were inhibited than excited by the US, irrespective of valence (34% ± 3% excitatory compared to 66% ± 3% inhibitory responses; Figure S2F). Because previous studies suggest that a subset of BLA neurons collateralize to multiple downstream targets (Shinonaga et al., 1994Shinonaga Y. Takada M. Mizuno N. Topographic organization of collateral projections from the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus to both the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens in the rat.Neuroscience. 1994; 58: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we estimated the extent of collateralization in each of the BLA neural populations projecting to the NAc, CeA, and vHPC by measuring fluorescence in multiple downstream structures of the BLA (Figures 3A and 3B ) from animals expressing ChR2-eYFP selectively in one projector population (BLA-NAc, BLA-CeA, or BLA-vHPC). This approach allowed us to evaluate the presence of neurites from each of these projection-target-defined populations; however, the presence of fluorescent processes may include fibers of passage and not faithfully represent functional synaptic terminals. We estimated the extent of collateralization based on membrane fluorescence relative to a reference location, shown in Figure 3B. Each of the three BLA projector populations sent collaterals to multiple downstream targets (Figure 3C); however, the fluorescence within the intended target structure always surpassed that in the collateral regions we examined (Figure 3D). In the images we collected, the average relative fluorescence from BLA-NAc projector neurites outside the NAc was 33% ± 9%. The collateral fluorescence observed for BLA-vHPC projectors was 24% ± 5% and only 17% ± 4% for BLA-CeA projectors. We found that BLA-NAc projectors expressed neurites extending across the NAc subregions, and outside the NAc to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), CeA, and vHPC (Figures 3C–3D and S3). The relative fluorescence of BLA-NAc projectors in the CeA was 57% of the fluorescence in NAc ventro-lateral core, which could be partly due to axons of passage that do not locally terminate or form functional synapses. The BLA-vHPC projector population displayed more fluorescence in the medial than in the lateral NAc shell (paired t test, t = 3.77, p < 0.05). However, there was no detectable difference in the amount of membrane fluorescence of BLA-CeA projectors between the medial and lateral NAc shell (paired t test, t = 0.67, p = 0.27). Notably, among our samples, BLA-CeA projectors scarcely expressed membrane fluorescence in the vHPC (∼1% relative eYFP fluorescence). To quantify the extent of synaptic terminals from BLA-NAc projectors in the CeA, we expressed synaptophysin fused to the fluorescent protein mCherry (Calhoun et al., 1996Calhoun M.E. Jucker M. Martin L.J. Thinakaran G. Price D.L. Mouton P.R. Comparative evaluation of synaptophysin-based methods for quantification of synapses.J. Neurocytol. 1996; 25: 821-828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Oh et al., 2014Oh S.W. Harris J.A. Ng L. Winslow B. Cain N. Mihalas S. Wang Q. Lau C. Kuan L. Henry A.M. et al.A mesoscale connectome of the mouse brain.Nature. 2014; 508: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). In mice expressing mCherry in the synaptic terminals and eYFP in the cell membranes of BLA-NAc projectors, the relative mCherry fluorescence in the CeA was only 20% (Figures S3A and S3B), while the relative eYFP fluorescence was 57% (Figure 3D). This finding suggests that BLA-NAc projectors collateralize to the CeA, albeit to a lesser extent than expected by quantifying neurite fluorescence alone, which likely includes fibers of passage. The BLA is known to be an epileptogenic region (Ben-Ari et al., 1980Ben-Ari Y. Tremblay E. Ottersen O.P. Injections of kainic acid into the amygdaloid complex of the rat: an electrographic, clinical and histological study in relation to the pathology of epilepsy.Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 515-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and recurrent collaterals between pyramidal cells in the BLA have been anatomically described (McDonald, 1984McDonald A.J. Neuronal organization of the lateral and basolateral amygdaloid nuclei in the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1984; 222: 589-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To unequivocally distinguish the BLA projection neurons expressing ChR2-eYFP (ChR2+) from the non-expressing neighbors that receive excitatory inputs from projectors in vivo, we empirically determined the photoresponse latencies ex vivo, where visual and electrophysiological validation of opsin expression is possible (Figures 4A, 4B, and S4). We classified neurons in three categories using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in the BLA (Figures 4B and 4C): (1) projectors that exhibit a peak/steady-state current, characteristic of ChR2-expressing neurons in response to a 1 s blue light illumination (ChR2+, 21% of 91 cells), (2) ChR2-negative neighbors receiving direct or indirect synaptic input from ChR2-expressing projectors (responsive neighbors, 25%), and (3) ChR2-negative neighbors that did not respond to illumination (non-responsive neighbors, 54%). We then measured the latencies of the light-evoked action potentials (APs) or excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) from the onset of a 5 ms light pulse to the peak of the response, in mice expressing ChR2 in BLA-NAc projectors (n = 40 cells), in BLA-CeA projectors (n = 19 cells), or in BLA-vHPC projectors (n = 32 cells; Figure 4D). While all ChR2+ projectors fired after photostimulation, only one of the responsive neighbors reached a suprathreshold response, with a latency of 17.3 ms (BLA-NAc neighbor; Figures 4E and 4F). Firing latencies ranged from 2 to 8 ms for BLA-NAc projectors and were significantly shorter than the light-evoked EPSP latencies of their responsive neighbors (10–36 ms, Student’s t test, ∗∗∗p < 0.01). BLA-CeA projectors expressing ChR2 responded faster than their responsive neighbors (1–5 versus 12–18 ms, Student’s t test, ∗∗∗p < 0.01). Finally, the photoresponse latencies of BLA-vHPC projectors ranged from 2 to 5 ms and were shorter than the photoresponse latencies of their responsive neighbors (11–24 ms, Student's t test, ∗∗∗p < 0.01; Figure 4F). Based on these data, we defined the in vivo photoresponse latency threshold as <9 ms for the NAc-projecting BLA neurons, and <6 ms for both the BLA-CeA and BLA-vHPC projectors. In order to perform optogenetic-mediated “phototagging” to identify BLA projectors in vivo, at the end of every recording session, we provided different patterns of photostimulation to compute the photoresponse latency and classify neurons as ChR2-expressing projectors (Figure 5A; see Experimental Procedures). After applying the identification threshold defined by our ex vivo recordings, we found a similar distribution of latencies across the three projector populations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, p > 0.05; Figure 5B). There were no detectable differences in the distribution of firing rates between the BLA-NAc and BLA-vHPC populations compared to the distribution in the BLA (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, p > 0.05), while BLA-CeA projectors have a different distribution of firing rates compared to all BLA neurons (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p < 0.01; Figure 5C). Finally, there were no detectable differences in the distribution of the action potential duration (peak-trough) between each of the three projector populations compared to the BLA distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, p > 0.05; Figure 5D). Altogether, 7% of the units recorded met our criteria for photoidentification (Figure 5E; see Experimental Procedures). Compared to the entire set of BLA neurons, in which 50% were cue-responsive, we found that BLA-NAc, BLA-CeA, and BLA-vHPC projecting populations contained 61%, 52%, and 69% cue-responsive units, respectively (Figure 5F). To visualize the response of each projector population to sucrose and quinine cues without applying any predetermined categories, we computed the average Z score of all recorded BLA neurons, BLA-NAc, BLA-CeA, and BLA-vHPC projectors (Figure 6A) in response to the sucrose cue (CS-S) and to the quinine cue (CS-Q). We compared Z score distances between the CS-S and CS-Q among the four populations (average within cell differences for BLA = 0.28, BLA-NAc = 0.63, BLA-CeA = −0.69, and BLA-vHPC = 1.26; Figure 6B) and found that the response profile of BLA-CeA projectors differed from each of the other three groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.001, BLA-CeA post hoc comparisons: to BLA-NAc ∗∗∗p < 0.001, to BLA ∗p < 0.05, and to BLA-vHPC ∗∗p < 0.01; Figure 6B). To compare CS representation dynamics in BLA projector populations, we projected the Z score time course of each neuron from 500 ms before to 500 ms after cue-onset onto a two-dimensional space using principal components analysis (PCA; Figures 6C, 6D, and S6). The time period between 100 and 500 ms after the cue-onset contributed to the component explaining the highest amount of variance in the dataset (PC1), while the first 100 ms following cue-onset contributed the most to the second principal component (PC2; Figure 6C). Interestingly, PC1 separates responses to the sucrose and quinine cues in all populations as illustrated by the separation of the CS-S and CS-Q vectors along PC1 (Figures 6D, S6B, and S6C). Additionally, PC2 separates the responses between the projector populations, especially separating CeA projectors from NAc and vHPC projectors (Figures 6D and S6C). Altogether, the PCA of the Z score time course suggests that the late cue-response (≥100 ms) contains more information regarding the valence of the cue, while the early cue-response (≤100 ms) contains more information regarding the projection target of the cell. After classification of the units depending on their qualitative response type, we found heterogeneity within each population (Figures 7A and 7B ). We categorized the functional responses into six classes: selectively excited by the CS-S, selectively excited by the CS-Q, excited by both cues, selectively inhibited by the CS-S, selectively inhibited by the CS-Q, or inhibited by both cues (Figures 7C and 7D). Examination of the population profiles of specific projector responses reveals noteworthy absences: for example, zero BLA-NAc neurons were excited by the CS-Q and zero BLA-CeA neurons were inhibited by the CS-Q (Figure 7C). When comparing the proportions of neurons excited or inhibited by one cue (Figure 7D), we found a larger proportion of BLA-NAc projectors excited by the CS-S (10/13 units; 77%), compared to the entire BLA neural population (228/448 units, 51% in the BLA, binomial distribution, +p < 0.1; Figure 7D). We also found that all BLA-CeA projectors responding only to the quinine cue showed an excitatory response (5/5 units; 100%), compared to 71/145 units (49%) of the BLA units (binomial distribution, ∗p < 0.05). We also observed that all recorded BLA-NAc projectors that responded only to the quinine cue showed inhibitory responses (2/2 units, 100%; Figures 7C and 7D). Regarding responses to the unconditioned stimuli (Figures S5 and S7), we did not detect differences in the proportion of excitatory and inhibitory responses to the sucrose and quinine deliveries (binomial distribution, p > 0.05). Finally, we compared the response profiles to the conditioned stimuli in the BLA neural population as a whole and in the three projection-target-defined BLA populations using different classification criteria for the representation of valence previously described in the literature (Figure 7E; for review see Namburi et al., 2015aNamburi P.

In this study, we show that upregulation of HOTAIR induced platinum resistance in ovarian cancer, and increased HOTAIR levels were observed in recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian tumors vs primary ovarian tumors. To investigate the role of HOTAIR during DNA damage induced by platinum, we monitored double-strand breaks and show that HOTAIR expression results in sustained activation of DNA damage response (DDR) after platinum treatment. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of HOTAIR induces NF-κB activation during DDR and interleukin-6 and interleukin-6 expression, both key NF-κB target genes. We show that HOTAIR regulates activation of NF-κB by decreasing Iκ-Bα (NF-κB inhibitor) and establish that by inducing prolonged NF-κB activation and expression of NF-κB target genes during DNA damage, HOTAIR has a critical role in cellular senescence and platinum sensitivity. Our findings suggest that an NF-κB-HOTAIR axis drives a positive-feedback loop cascade during DDR and contributes to cellular senescence and chemotherapy resistance in ovarian and other cancers."

These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which pathogenic tau causes synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD pathogenesis. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) causes gradual memory loss associated with synapse deterioration. Tauopathies, including AD and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau inclusions (FTLD-tau), are characterized by the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, a microtubule-associated protein. Cognitive decline coincides with the deposition of NFTs in AD progression (Giannakopoulos et al., 2003Giannakopoulos P. Herrmann F.R. Bussière T. Bouras C. Kövari E. Perl D.P. Morrison J.H. Gold G.

Tangle and neuron numbers, but not amyloid load, predict cognitive status in Alzheimer’s disease.Neurology. 2003; 60: 1495-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar); however, the presence of NFTs is not sufficient to cause memory loss in FTLD-tau transgenic mice (Santacruz et al., 2005Santacruz K.

Although it is widely accepted that tau plays a significant role in AD pathogenesis, the entity of the toxic species and the mechanism by which tau causes cognitive decline in AD are still unclear. Fine-tuning of synaptic strength in response to neuronal activity is critical for cognitive processes, such as learning and memory. Synapses are particularly vulnerable to toxicity in AD and synapse loss is correlated with cognitive decline (DeKosky and Scheff, 1990DeKosky S.T. Scheff S.W.

Under pathological conditions, tau is missorted from axons into dendritic compartments and postsynaptic spines (Zempel and Mandelkow, 2014Zempel H. Mandelkow E.

Moreover, postsynaptic targeting of Fyn kinase by tau exacerbates excitotoxicity in an AD mouse model (Ittner et al., 2010Ittner L.M. Ke Y.D. Delerue F. Bi M. Gladbach A. van Eersel J. Wölfing H.

These findings support a key role for tau-mediated pathogenesis at postsynaptic sites; yet, how tau affects the synaptic mechanisms underlying the encoding of memory is largely unknown. The activity of p300 acetyltransferase is enhanced in human AD brain (Aubry et al., 2015Aubry S. Shin W. Crary J.F. Lefort R. Qureshi Y.H. Lefebvre C. Califano A. Shelanski M.L.

Likewise, acetylation affects tau in different ways. It inhibits tau binding to microtubules (Cohen et al., 2011Cohen T.J. Guo J.L. Hurtado D.E. Kwong L.K. Mills I.P. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.

These studies support the notion that aberrantly acetylated tau (ac-tau) is pathogenic; but, whether ac-tau induces neuronal dysfunction underlying cognitive decline is unknown. The KIBRA gene was first linked to human memory performance in a genome-wide screen for SNPs (Papassotiropoulos et al., 2006Papassotiropoulos A. Stephan D.A. Huentelman M.J. Hoerndli F.J. Craig D.W.

Osborne D. et al.Common Kibra alleles are associated with human memory performance.Science. 2006; 314: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Predominantly expressed in memory-associated regions of the brain, KIBRA is enriched at postsynaptic sites (Schneider et al., 2010Schneider A. Huentelman M.J. Kremerskothen J. Duning K. Spoelgen R.

Here we report that brains from AD patients with dementia exhibit significantly higher levels of tau acetylated on lysine-274 (K274) and lysine-281 (K281). To define the effects of the aberrant acetylation of these lysines on brain function and cognition, we generated transgenic mice using the murine prion promoter to drive expression of either wild-type human tau (tauWT) or human tau with lysine-to-glutamine substitutions to mimic the charge and structure of acetylated K274 and K281 (tauKQ). We investigated the effects of tauKQ on synaptic plasticity and memory encoding, and we established the dysregulation of postsynaptic mechanisms involving activity-dependent actin polymerization and AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking. Our study also provides a mechanistic connection among aberrant tau acetylation, KIBRA deficiency, and dementia in AD. To investigate the acetylated lysine residues on tau in tauopathy, we immunoprecipitated tau from homogenized human AD brain and rTg4510 mouse brain, an FTLD-tau model that exhibits pathological tau accumulation (Santacruz et al., 2005Santacruz K. Lewis J. Spires T. Paulson J. Kotilinek L. Ingelsson M. Guimaraes A. DeTure M. Ramsden M. McGowan E. et al.Tau suppression in a neurodegenerative mouse model improves memory function.Science. 2005; 309: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar), and we performed analysis by reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). K274 was acetylated in rTg4510 mouse brain (Figure 1A), in agreement with acetylated K274 (ac-K274) observed in human AD brain (Grinberg et al., 2013Grinberg L.T. Wang X. Wang C. Sohn P.D. Theofilas P. Sidhu M. Arevalo J.B. Heinsen H. Huang E.J. Rosen H. et al.Argyrophilic grain disease differs from other tauopathies by lacking tau acetylation.Acta Neuropathol. 2013; 125: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A novel acetylation site on K281 was identified in human AD brain (Figure 1B). K274 and K281 are in the microtubule-binding domain of tau. Two monoclonal antibodies, MAb359 and MAb63, were generated using an ac-tau peptide containing amino acids 264–287 as the antigen (Figure 1C). In HEK293 cells, MAb359 and MAb63 showed strong immunoreactivity for tauWT only in the presence of the acetyltransferase p300 (Figure 1D). A single mutation of lysine to arginine for either K274 (K274R) or K281 (K281R) that blocked p300-induced acetylation eliminated the signal from MAb359 and MAb63, respectively (Figure 1D). Blocking acetylation of other lysines did not affect the immunoreactivity of these antibodies for ac-tau (Figure S1A). These results established the specificity of MAb359 for ac-K274 and MAb63 for acetylated K281 (ac-K281). To assess tau acetylation in an AD-related mouse model, we established a transgenic mouse that expresses tauWT driven by the murine prion promoter, and we crossed it with human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP)-J20 mice that have high hAPP/Aβ levels (Mucke et al., 2000Mucke L. Masliah E. Yu G.Q. Mallory M. Rockenstein E.M. Tatsuno G. Hu K. Kholodenko D. Johnson-Wood K. McConlogue L. High-level neuronal expression of abeta 1-42 in wild-type human amyloid protein precursor transgenic mice: synaptotoxicity without plaque formation.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4050-4058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Modest levels of ac-K274 and ac-K281 were detected in the hippocampus of 6-month-old tauWT mice, and the levels were significantly elevated in doubly transgenic mice that also express hAPP (Figures 1E–1G). To investigate ac-tau levels in human brains, we first confirmed the antibody specificity in a competition assay, in which MAb359 and MAb63 immunoreactivity was blocked by pre-incubation with recombinant human tau acetylated by p300 (Figures S1B and S1C). MAb359 and MAb63 immunoreactivities were markedly higher in the superior temporal gyrus of AD patients with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 5—the most severe dementia cases—than those that were CDR 0 with no cognitive impairments (Figures 1H–1J). In mild dementia cases (CDR 0.5), the amounts of ac-K274 were similar to those of non-dementia cases, whereas ac-K281 levels were significantly greater (Figures 1H–1J). Thus, aberrant acetylation of K274 and K281 is upregulated by high Aβ/hAPP levels and associated with cognitive impairments in AD. To explore how ac-K274 and ac-K281 could contribute to cognitive deficits in AD, we generated transgenic mice expressing human tau with lysine-to-glutamine mutations at K274 and K281 (tauKQ) to mimic acetylation. Since glutamine resembles the chemical structure and neutral charge of acetyl-lysine, this residue substitution is widely used to study the effects of acetylation on specific lysine residues (Hecht et al., 1995Hecht A.

As in the tauWT mice, the murine prion promoter was used to drive tauKQ transgene expression. We established two founder lines: tauKQ mice that expressed HT7-positive human tau at levels similar to tauWT mice and a higher expression line called tauKQhigh (Figures 2A and 2B ). In situ hybridization revealed that the human tau expression patterns in hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum were similar in tauWT, tauKQ, and tauKQhigh lines (Figure S2). Compared with nontransgenic (ntg) controls, similar levels of astrogliosis were induced in the dentate gyrus of all three lines, as detected with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity (Figures 2C and 2D). Phosphorylation of human tau was detected in tauWT mice (Figures S3A–S3D), consistent with another human tau transgenic mouse line (Andorfer et al., 2003Andorfer C. Kress Y. Espinoza M. de Silva R.

Phospho-serine 202/205 (AT8) levels on tauKQ were reduced, whereas phosho-serine 396/404 (PHF-1) and phospho-threonine 181 (AT270) levels were similar to tauWT (Figures S3A–S3D). Caspase-cleaved tau was observed in the hippocampus of tauKQhigh mice, but not in tauWT or tauKQ mice (Figure S3E). Tau was also monitored with MC1 staining, which recognizes a pathological confirmation of tau in FTLD-tau mouse models (Decker et al., 2015Decker J.M. Krüger L. Sydow A. Zhao S. Frotscher M.

Cognitive defects are reversible in inducible mice expressing pro-aggregant full-length human Tau.Acta Neuropathol. 2012; 123: 787-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Consistent with pathogenicity of ac-K274 and ac-K281, tauKQ mice exhibited significantly higher MC1 immunoreactivity than tauWT mice, which was further elevated in tauKQhigh mice (Figures 2E and 2F). To determine if ac-tau affects synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus associated with memory loss, field recordings were performed in the dentate gyrus molecular layer of acute brain slices. After theta-burst stimulation (TBS) of the perforant pathway to dentate granule cell (DGC) synapses, LTP in tauWT slices was sustained at the same level as ntg slices for the duration of the recordings (Figure 3A). In contrast, potentiation significantly declined in tauKQ slices by 60 min after LTP induction (Figure 3B). Since tauWT and tauKQ mice have similar levels of human tau (Figures 2A and 2B), these results support the pathogenicity of ac-K274 and ac-K281. Moreover, tauKQhigh slices exhibited a pronounced LTP impairment (Figure 3C). In basal synaptic transmission, the strength of the perforant pathway inputs and the postsynaptic responsiveness of DGCs in tauWT, tauKQ, or tauKQhigh slices were similar to ntg controls (Figures 3D–3F). Perforant pathway inputs also showed normal presynaptic release properties in slices from tauKQ-expressing mice (Figure 3G). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of DGCs from ntg and tauKQhigh slices revealed comparable AMPAR- and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated synaptic strength (Figures 3H–3J). Thus, the tauKQ-induced LTP deficit is not likely due to insufficient plasticity induction, but rather to the inhibition of long-term synaptic strengthening. To determine the functional outcome of ac-K274 and ac-K281, we focused our behavioral tests on tauKQhigh mice. Spatial learning and memory were examined in the Morris water maze (MWM) test. During hidden platform training, there was no significant difference between 11- and 13-month-old ntg and tauKQhigh mice in spatial learning or swim speed (Figures 4A and 4B ). In 24- and 72-hr probe trials, ntg mice demonstrated robust spatial memory with a strong preference for the target quadrant (Figures 4C and 4D). In contrast, the amount of time that tauKQhigh mice spent in the target quadrant was not significantly different from chance levels in the 72-hr probe trial (Figures 4C and 4D), indicating that tauKQhigh mice were impaired in spatial memory. Besides spatial memory deficits, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD also exhibit deficiencies in distinguishing between similar experiences (Ally et al., 2013Ally B.A. Hussey E.P.

To determine if aberrant ac-tau interferes with the encoding of distinct memories, we performed two different behavioral tests to assess pattern separation in tauKQhigh mice. Mice were first tested in an object-context discrimination task (Jain et al., 2012Jain S. Yoon S.Y. Zhu L. Brodbeck J. Dai J. Walker D. Huang Y. Arf4 determines dentate gyrus-mediated pattern separation by regulating dendritic spine development.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e46340Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) in which they learn to associate specific objects with two distinct contexts during a sample phase, followed by a test phase to assess their ability to distinguish the incongruent object within the familiar context (Figure 4E). At 6–7 months old, ntg, tauWT, and tauKQhigh mice spent an equal proportion of time exploring the objects in the sample phase (Figure 4F). However, unlike ntg and tauWT mice, which spent significantly more time exploring the incongruent object during the test phase, tauKQhigh mice showed no preference, suggesting that tauKQhigh mice were unable to differentiate between previous experiences (Figure 4G). We also examined pattern separation by testing contextual discrimination learning with fear conditioning. The ability of mice to learn to distinguish between two highly similar contexts in this test requires DGC function (McHugh et al., 2007McHugh T.J. Jones M.W. Quinn J.J. Balthasar N. Coppari R.

Current methods for identifying in vivo targets of an RBP are imperfect and not amenable to examining small numbers of cells. To address these issues, we developed TRIBE (targets of RNA-binding proteins identified by editing), a technique that couples an RBP to the catalytic domain of the Drosophila RNA-editing enzyme ADAR and expresses the fusion protein in vivo. RBP targets are marked with novel RNA editing events and identified by sequencing RNA. We have used TRIBE to identify the targets of three RBPs (Hrp48, dFMR1, and NonA). TRIBE compares favorably to other methods, including CLIP, and we have identified RBP targets from as little as 150 specific fly neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2332297986,"The glyoxylate shunt (GS) is a two-step metabolic pathway (isocitrate lyase, aceA; and malate synthase, glcB) that serves as an alternative to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The GS bypasses the carbon dioxide-producing steps of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and is essential for acetate and fatty acid metabolism in bacteria. GS can be up-regulated under conditions of oxidative stress, antibiotic stress, and host infection, which implies that it plays important but poorly explored roles in stress defense and pathogenesis. In many bacterial species, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, aceA and glcB are not in an operon, unlike in Escherichia coli. In P. aeruginosa, we explored relationships between GS genes and growth, transcription profiles, and biofilm formation. Contrary to our expectations, deletion of aceA in P. aeruginosa improved cell growth under conditions of oxidative and antibiotic stress. Transcriptome data suggested that aceA mutants underwent a metabolic shift toward aerobic denitrification; this was supported by additional evidence, including up-regulation of denitrification-related genes, decreased oxygen consumption without lowering ATP yield, increased production of denitrification intermediates (NO and N2O), and increased cyanide resistance. The aceA mutants also produced a thicker exopolysaccharide layer; that is, a phenotype consistent with aerobic denitrification. A bioinformatic survey across known bacterial genomes showed that only microorganisms capable of aerobic metabolism possess the glyoxylate shunt. This trend is consistent with the hypothesis that the GS plays a previously unrecognized role in allowing bacteria to tolerate oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2315845939,"Increasing antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens has rendered some infections untreatable with available antibiotics. Klebsiella pneumoniae, a bacterial pathogen that has acquired high-level antibiotic resistance, is a common cause of pulmonary infections. Optimal clearance of K. pneumoniae from the host lung requires TNF and IL-17A. Herein, we demonstrate that inflammatory monocytes are rapidly recruited to the lungs of K. pneumoniae-infected mice and produce TNF, which markedly increases the frequency of IL-17-producing innate lymphoid cells. While pulmonary clearance of K. pneumoniae is preserved in neutrophil-depleted mice, monocyte depletion or TNF deficiency impairs IL-17A-dependent resolution of pneumonia. Monocyte-mediated bacterial uptake and killing is enhanced by ILC production of IL-17A, indicating that innate lymphocytes engage in a positive-feedback loop with monocytes that promotes clearance of pneumonia. Innate immune defense against a highly antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogen depends on crosstalk between inflammatory monocytes and innate lymphocytes that is mediated by TNF and IL-17A."

Our results support a model in which UPF3A serves as a molecular rheostat that directs developmental events. Gene duplication is an innovative platform for the diversification and adaptation of species. While most duplicated genes are of no immediate selective value and thus undergo degeneration, in rare instances, a duplicated gene provides a useful function and thus it persists over evolutionary time (Innan and Kondrashov, 2010Innan H. Kondrashov F. The evolution of gene duplications: classifying and distinguishing between models.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The specific selective forces that lead to the retention and subsequent alterations in duplicated genes have been widely studied. A clear-cut example of a duplicated gene that is of immediate selective value is when it increases the level of a rate-limiting gene product (Kondrashov et al., 2002Kondrashov F.A. Rogozin I.B. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Selection in the evolution of gene duplications.Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (RESEARCH0008)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene duplication can also lead to a scenario in which the gene paralogs acquire mutations that ultimately subdivide their functions or expression patterns between the paralogs, a process called subfunctionalization (Hittinger and Carroll, 2007Hittinger C.T. Carroll S.B. Gene duplication and the adaptive evolution of a classic genetic switch.Nature. 2007; 449: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, Innan and Kondrashov, 2010Innan H. Kondrashov F. The evolution of gene duplications: classifying and distinguishing between models.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). For example, if the original protein has two or more functions that cannot be independently improved upon, paralogs can provide a division of labor such that each paralog specializes and optimizes the functions independently. Another example of subfunctionalization occurs when there is a divergence in the expression pattern of redundant gene paralogs; this leads to strong selection to maintain all such gene paralogs because each paralog becomes essential for the particular cell types and developmental stages in which it is expressed. In other cases, gene paralogs acquire new functions, a process called neo-functionalization (Innan and Kondrashov, 2010Innan H. Kondrashov F. The evolution of gene duplications: classifying and distinguishing between models.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, Teshima and Innan, 2008Teshima K.M. Innan H. Neofunctionalization of duplicated genes under the pressure of gene conversion.Genetics. 2008; 178: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For example, a protein domain may be created in a newly formed gene paralog that increases the fitness of an organism. While intuitively attractive, the neofunctionalization model suffers from the fact that selection processes act on current functions, not promises of future functions. Thus, it is unclear whether new functions can be sculpted rapidly enough (through mutation) for selective forces to act upon them. In the absence of selection, gene paralogs become non-functional; e.g., deteriorate into pseudogenes. Here, we report an evolutionary outcome of gene duplication—functional antagonism—that can rapidly integrate into existing regulatory circuitry to provide biological benefit. In particular, we identify a gene paralog pair that has evolved to encode proteins with opposing functions. The pathway regulated by this paralog pair is nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD), a highly conserved RNA degradation pathway that has dual roles. One role is to serve as a RNA surveillance pathway that degrades aberrant mRNAs harboring premature termination (nonsense) codons (PTCs). This quality control role is important, as PTC-bearing mRNAs are commonly generated by mutation and biosynthetic errors, including alternative splicing. By reducing the levels of such PTC-containing mRNAs, NMD reduces the expression of truncated proteins, some of which have dominant-negative effects (Chang et al., 2007Chang Y.-F. Imam J.S. Wilkinson M.F. The nonsense-mediated decay RNA surveillance pathway.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, Rebbapragada and Lykke-Andersen, 2009Rebbapragada I. Lykke-Andersen J. Execution of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay: what defines a substrate?.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The second role of NMD is to degrade a subset of normal mRNAs. Studies in which factors crucial for NMD have been depleted or completely ablated in species spanning the phylogenetic scale have revealed dysregulation of a large subset of the “normal transcriptome” (∼3% to 15% of mRNAs) (Lykke-Andersen and Jensen, 2015Lykke-Andersen S. Jensen T.H. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay: an intricate machinery that shapes transcriptomes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). This suggests that NMD serves as an important regulator of normal gene expression. Several contexts have been defined that allow a stop codon in a normal mRNA to trigger mRNA decay. In mammals, the best-established NMD-inducing context is one in which there is at least one exon-exon junction downstream of the stop codon—a dEJ. This allows a set of NMD-enhancing proteins recruited near exon-exon junctions—collectively called the exon-junction complex (EJC)—to avoid being displaced by translating ribosomes (Lykke-Andersen and Jensen, 2015Lykke-Andersen S. Jensen T.H. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay: an intricate machinery that shapes transcriptomes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The EJC directly binds with the UPF3B protein (also known as “UPF3X”), which serves as an adaptor protein that interacts with other NMD factors to trigger rapid RNA decay (Buchwald et al., 2010Buchwald G. Ebert J. Basquin C. Sauliere J. Jayachandran U. Bono F. Le Hir H. Conti E. Insights into the recruitment of the NMD machinery from the crystal structure of a core EJC-UPF3b complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 10050-10055Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, Kadlec et al., 2004Kadlec J. Izaurralde E. Cusack S. The structural basis for the interaction between nonsense-mediated mRNA decay factors UPF2 and UPF3.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Interest in the NMD adaptor protein, UPF3B, intensified when it was discovered that UPF3B mutations cause intellectual disability in humans (Tarpey et al., 2007Tarpey P.S. Raymond F.L. Nguyen L.S. Rodriguez J. Hackett A. Vandeleur L. Smith R. Shoubridge C. Edkins S. Stevens C. et al.Mutations in UPF3B, a member of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay complex, cause syndromic and nonsyndromic mental retardation.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1127-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Intellectual disability patients with UPF3B mutations also commonly suffer from autism or schizophrenia, suggesting that UPF3B, and by implication, NMD, is also important for normal psychiatric behavior (Nguyen et al., 2014Nguyen L.S. Wilkinson M.F. Gecz J. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay: inter-individual variability and human disease.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2014; 46: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The underlying basis for UPF3B function in the nervous system is poorly understood, but one function is to coordinate differentiation decisions in neural stem cells and progenitors. Depletion of UPF3B in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) increases their proliferation and impairs neurite formation, suggesting that NMD promotes the differentiation of already committed neural progenitor cells (Jolly et al., 2013Jolly L.A. Homan C.C. Jacob R. Barry S. Gecz J.

Genet. 2013; 22: 4673-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, substantial evidence indicates that NMD has the opposite effect on neural stem cells—it promotes the stem-like state and proliferation (Lou et al., 2014Lou C.H. Shao A. Shum E.Y. Espinoza J.L. Huang L. Karam R. Wilkinson M.F. Posttranscriptional control of the stem cell and neurogenic programs by the nonsense-mediated RNA decay pathway.Cell Rep. 2014; 6: 748-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because NMD is a branched pathway, it is possible that these different functions emanate from different branches, each of which are known to regulate different subsets of NMD substrate mRNAs (Lykke-Andersen and Jensen, 2015Lykke-Andersen S. Jensen T.H. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay: an intricate machinery that shapes transcriptomes.Nat. Rev. Mol.

RNA. 2012; 3: 807-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). UPF3B is unique among known NMD factors in having a related sister protein—UPF3A. UPF3A and UPF3B are encoded by an evolutionarily ancient paralog pair that exists in most, if not all, vertebrates, including all sequenced mammals, frogs, fish, and birds. It is not known why this gene paralog pair has persisted since the origin of vertebrates. It has been hypothesized that UPF3A and UPF3B have redundant functions (Chan et al., 2007Chan W.-K. Huang L. Gudikote J.P. Chang Y.F. Imam J.S. MacLean 2nd, J.A. Wilkinson M.F.

Psychiatry. 2012; 17: 1103-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), a notion supported by the fact that UPF3A is dramatically upregulated when UPF3B is downregulated or eliminated (Chan et al., 2009Chan W.-K. Bhalla A.D. Le Hir H. Nguyen L.S. Huang L. Gécz J. Wilkinson M.F. A UPF3-mediated regulatory switch that maintains RNA surveillance.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This possibility is also consistent with the association between the magnitude of this UPF3A upregulatory response and the severity of neurological symptoms in intellectual disability patients with UFP3B mutations (Nguyen et al., 2012Nguyen L.S. Jolly L. Shoubridge C. Chan W.K. Huang L. Laumonnier F. Raynaud M. Hackett A. Field M.

Psychiatry. 2012; 17: 1103-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). If indeed UPF3A and UPF3B act redundantly in NMD, it is critical that they also each have unique properties that have allowed them to both persist over evolutionary time. One possibility is that UPF3A and UPF3B have unique expression patterns that allow them to be independently selected for, in accordance with the subfunctionalization model. In support, Upf3a is much more highly expressed in the testis than in other adult organs (Serin et al., 2001Serin G. Gersappe A. Black J.D. Aronoff R. Maquat L.E. Identification and characterization of human orthologues to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Upf2 protein and Upf3 protein (Caenorhabditis elegans SMG-4).Mol. Cell.

Comparison of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay efficiency in various murine tissues.BMC Genet. 2008; 9: 83Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, Upf3b, while ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, is a candidate to be transcriptionally silenced in testicular germ cells given that it is an X-linked gene and thus would be predicted to be subject to meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), which transcriptionally silences genes on the X and Y chromosomes during male meiosis (Turner, 2007Turner J.M.A. Meiotic sex chromosome inactivation.Development. 2007; 134: 1823-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). If indeed Upf3b is transcriptionally silenced in meiotic germ cells, this raises the possibility that Upf3a, which is present on an autosome, might serve to replace Upf3b function in meiotic germ cells, thereby explaining the high expression of Upf3a in the testis and providing a justification for the persistence of these two paralogs over evolutionary time. While potentially attractive, the subfunctionalization model for explaining the long-term persistence of the UPF3A/UPF3B paralog pair suffers from the uncertainty as to whether UPF3A is actually an NMD factor. The only evidence that UPF3A is a NMD factor comes from gain-of-function studies in which UPF3A was tethered downstream of a stop codon in reporter RNAs using the high-affinity RNA-binding proteins MS2 and λN. Such UPF3A-fusion proteins only elicited trace NMD activity (∼20% downregulation), as judged by reporter RNA analysis (Kunz et al., 2006Kunz J.B. Neu-Yilik G. Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E. Gehring N.H. Functions of hUpf3a and hUpf3b in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and translation.RNA. 2006; 12: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, Lykke-Andersen et al., 2000Lykke-Andersen J.

Human Upf proteins target an mRNA for nonsense-mediated decay when bound downstream of a termination codon.Cell. 2000; 103: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In contrast, other human NMD proteins, including UPF3B, exhibited strong NMD activity in this tethering assay. This weak ability of UPF3A to promote NMD is surprising given that it is encoded by an ancient gene (∼500 million years old) that presumably has had ample time to be selected to encode a protein with strong NMD activity. Indeed, UPF3A is poised for such a role, as a single amino-acid substitution is sufficient to convert UPF3A into a strong NMD factor, comparable in activity with UPF3B (Kunz et al., 2006Kunz J.B. Neu-Yilik G. Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E. Gehring N.H. Functions of hUpf3a and hUpf3b in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and translation.RNA. 2006; 12: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In this communication, we addressed this paradox by re-evaluating the function of UPF3A using loss-of-function approaches. Our analysis revealed that UPF3A is actually a broadly acting NMD inhibitor. This discovery implies that UPF3A and UPF3B do not primarily work in a complementary or redundant manner as previously supposed; instead, they oppose each other, allowing this paralog pair to serve as a molecular rheostat to modulate the level of gene expression during development. We addressed the function of UPF3A by performing loss-of-function experiments. Surprisingly, we found UPF3A depletion led to downregulation, not upregulation, of 6 of the 8 NMD substrates we examined in mouse P19 cells (Figure 1A), raising the possibility that UPF3A is a NMD repressor. Since the hallmark of NMD is that it destabilizes its target mRNAs (Maderazo et al., 2003Maderazo A.B. Belk J.P. He F. Jacobson A. Nonsense-containing mRNAs that accumulate in the absence of a functional nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway are destabilized rapidly upon its restitution.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 842-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), we next examined whether UPF3A antagonizes this destabilization. Indeed, we found that depletion of UPF3A destabilized multiple NMD target mRNAs, implying that UPF3A stabilizes NMD target RNAs (Figures 1B and S1A). UPF3A depletion also increased NMD magnitude as judged using a NMD reporter system (Figures 1C, S1B, and S1D) (Boelz et al., 2006Boelz S. Neu-Yilik G. Gehring N.H. Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E. A chemiluminescence-based reporter system to monitor nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 349: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As a converse experiment, we overexpressed UPF3A and found that this impaired the magnitude of NMD (Figure S1E). To determine whether the ability of UPF3A to repress NMD is a peculiarity of P19 cells, we examined mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and found that UPF3A also suppressed the downregulation of most NMD substrates in these cells (Figure 1D).Figure S1UPF3A Is an NMD Inhibitor, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) NMD substrates are stabilized by UPF3A. mRNA half-lives were determined by qPCR analysis as in Figure 1B.

Our evidence that UPF3A is a NMD repressor was at apparent odds with the previous evidence that UPF3A is a weak NMD factor (Kunz et al., 2006Kunz J.B. Neu-Yilik G. Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E.

To reconcile this, we considered the possibility that UPF3A is not a NMD repressor per se, but instead it reduces NMD activity conferred by its paralog UPF3B. By replacing its paralog in molecular interactions with other NMD factors, UPF3A might “repress” NMD merely by virtue of being a weaker NMD factor than UPF3B, which acts in a specific branch of the NMD pathway (Chan et al., 2007Chan W.-K. Huang L. Gudikote J.P. Chang Y.F. Imam J.S. MacLean 2nd, J.A. Wilkinson M.F.

Genet. 2007; 39: 1127-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This hypothesis predicts that depletion of UPF3A in cells already lacking UPF3B would weaken NMD. Alternatively, if UPF3A is a bona fide NMD repressor, depletion of UPF3A would strengthen NMD, even in UPF3B-deficient cells. To test this hypothesis, we generated Upf3b-KO mouse neural stem cells (mNSCs) and matching control cells. We found that depletion of UPF3A in these Upf3b-KO mNSCs decreased the level of all NMD substrates tested (Figure 1E). As a control, we depleted the core NMD factor, UPF1, which triggered the opposite effect, as expected (Figure 1E). This evidence strongly supported the notion that UPF3A is a bona fide NMD repressor in vitro. We found that a subset of NMD substrates escaped UPF3A-mediated NMD repression in some contexts. For example, Gas5 and Snord22 RNA were not downregulated in UPF3A-depleted P19 cells, indicating that these “non-coding” NMD substrate transcripts can escape UPF3A-mediated repression of NMD (Figure 1A). However, both of these transcripts were downregulated in response to UPF3A depletion in MEFs and mNSCs (Figures 1D and 1E). This suggested that the ability of Gas5 and Snord22 RNA to escape UPF3A-mediated repression is not an intrinsic feature of these transcripts, but rather a cell-type-specific response. We conclude that while UPF3A is a broadly acting NMD suppressor, some NMD substrate transcripts can escape its activity in specific cellular contexts, a possibility we explore further below. We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) half-life analysis to globally define mRNAs regulated by UPF3A. If UPF3A is primarily a NMD repressor, this predicts that more RNAs would be destabilized than stabilized in response to UPF3A depletion. Consistent with this prediction, we found that 83% of the mRNAs displaying significantly altered stability were destabilized in response to UPF3A depletion (Figures 2B and 2C ; Table S1). Because destabilization after UPF3A depletion implies these mRNAs are stabilized by UPF3A, we will refer to these mRNAs as “UPF3A stabilized.” Conversely, mRNAs stabilized after UPF3A depletion will be referred to as “UPF3A destabilized.” Figures S2C and S2D show examples of UPF3A-stabilized and UPF3A-destabilized mRNAs, respectively.Figure S2Genome-wide Half-Life Analysis of UPF3A-Regulated mRNAs, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) GO analysis of functional categories overrepresented (p < 0.05) in the UPF3A-destabilized mRNAs defined in Figure 2C.(B) The percentage of transcripts harboring a dEJ from the groups defined in Figure 2C.(C) UPF3A-stabilized mRNAs.

(E) qPCR analysis of NMD substrates in stably UPF3A-depleted (shUPF3A) HeLa cells versus control (shLuc) HeLa cells (described in Chan et al., 2007). To assess whether a significant proportion of the UPF3A-stabilized mRNAs are normally degraded by NMD, we compiled high-confidence NMD substrates identified from previously published studies and determined whether any of these overlapped with the UPF3A-stablized RNAs we identified. This analysis revealed that 350 of the mouse UPF3A-stabilized transcripts in P19 cells are high-confidence NMD substrates (Table S2). We regarded this as a remarkably large number of mRNAs given that few high-confidence NMD substrates have been defined so far. As evidence that UPF3A can also act as a NMD factor, we found that 64 of the UPF3A-destabilized transcripts are also high-confidence NMD substrates (Table S2). Given that our results were obtained with mouse P19 cells, whereas the vast majority of high-confidence NMD substrates were defined in human cells (Table S2), our results suggest that UPF3A acts as both a NMD repressor and NMD factor on conserved NMD target mRNAs. As further evidence for this, human orthologs of mouse mRNAs exhibiting altered stability in UPF3A-depleted mouse P19 cells also exhibited altered mRNA level in UPF3A-depleted human HeLa cells (Figure 2E). NMD is elicited when the stop codon defining the end of the main ORF is present in specific contexts, including when a stop codon is followed by a dEJ (see the Introduction). Consistent with UPF3A acting on mRNAs degraded by NMD, the frequency of dEJs was higher for both UPF3A-stabilized and UPF3A-destabilized mRNAs than mRNAs not exhibiting altered stability in response to UPF3A depletion (Figure S2B). However, this trend was not statistically significant, suggesting that another NMD-inducing feature might also contribute. Indeed, we found that UPF3A-stabilized mRNAs had significantly longer 3′ UTR length than did control mRNAs or UPF3A-destabilized mRNAs (p < 0.0001; Figure 2D), which is consistent with previous findings that long 3′ UTRs can elicit NMD (Lykke-Andersen and Jensen, 2015Lykke-Andersen S.

To study the dynamics of ingestion in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster, we developed Expresso, an automated feeding assay that measures individual meal-bouts with high temporal resolution at nanoliter scale. Flies showed discrete, temporally precise ingestion that was regulated by hunger state and sucrose concentration. We identify 12 cholinergic local interneurons (IN1, for ""ingestion neurons"") necessary for this behavior. Sucrose ingestion caused a rapid and persistent increase in IN1 interneuron activity in fasted flies that decreased proportionally in response to subsequent feeding bouts. Sucrose responses of IN1 interneurons in fed flies were significantly smaller and lacked persistent activity. We propose that IN1 neurons monitor ingestion by connecting sugar-sensitive taste neurons in the pharynx to neural circuits that control the drive to ingest. Similar mechanisms for monitoring and regulating ingestion may exist in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2329612550,"Background Type 2 (T2DM) is believed to be common in Saudi Arabia, but data are limited. In this population survey, we determined the prevalence of T2DM and prediabetes. Materials and Methods A representative sample among residents aged ≥ 18 years of the city of Jeddah was obtained comprising both Saudi and non-Saudi families (N = 1420). Data on dietary, clinical and socio-demographic characteristics were collected and anthropometric measurements taken. Fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were used to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes employing American Diabetes Association criteria. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with T2DM. Results Age and sex standardized prevalence of prediabetes was 9.0% (95% CI 7.5–10.5); 9.4% (7.1–11.8) in men and 8.6% (6.6–10.6) in women. For DM it was 12.1% (10.7–13.5); 12.9% (10.7–13.5) in men and 11.4% (9.5–13.3) in women. The prevalence based on World Population as standard was 18.3% for DM and 11.9% for prediabetes. The prevalence of DM and prediabetes increased with age. Of people aged ≥50 years 46% of men and 44% of women had DM. Prediabetes and DM were associated with various measures of adiposity. DM was also associated with and family history of dyslipidemia in women, cardiovascular disease in men, and with hypertension, dyslipidemia and family history of diabetes in both sexes. Discussion Age was the strongest predictor of DM and prediabetes followed by obesity. Of people aged 50 years or over almost half had DM and another 10–15% had prediabetes leaving only a small proportion of people in this age group with normoglycemia. Since we did not use an oral glucose tolerance test the true prevalence of DM and prediabetes is thus likely to be even higher than reported here. These results demonstrate the urgent need to develop primary prevention strategies for type 2 diabetes in Saudi Arabia."

All completed audio computer-assisted self-interview surveys. Chart abstraction or blood draw provided viral load data. Geographic-level variables were extracted from the United States Census Bureau (e.g., socioeconomic disadvantage, percent of Black and Latino households, percent rural) and Esri Crime (e.g., global crime index) databases as Zip Code Tabulation Areas. AIDSVu data (e.g., prevalence of HIV among youth) were extracted at the county-level. Using HLM v.7, the authors conducted means-as-outcomes random effects multi-level models to examine the association between structural-level and individual-level factors and (1) being on antiretroviral therapy (ART) currently; (2) being on ART for at least 6 months; (3) missed HIV care appointments (not having missed any vs. having missed one or more appointments) over the past 12 months; and (4) viral suppression (defined by the corresponding assay cutoff for the lower limit of viral load at each participating site which denoted nondetectability vs. detectability).Frequencies for the 4 primary outcomes were as follows: current ART use (n = 1120, 59.23%); ART use for ≥6 months (n = 861, 45.53%); at least one missed HIV care appointment (n = 936, 49.50); and viral suppression (n = 577, 30.51%). After adjusting for individual-level factors, youth living in more disadvantaged areas (defined by a composite score derived from 2010 Census indicators including percent poverty, percent receiving public assistance, percent of female, single-headed households, percent unemployment, and percent of people with less than a high school degree) were less likely to report current ART use (OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.72-1.00, p = .05). Among current ART users, living in more disadvantaged areas was associated with greater likelihood of having used ART for ≥6 months. Participants living in counties with greater HIV prevalence among 13-24 year olds were more likely to report current ART use (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.65, p = .02), ≥6 months ART use (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.65, p = .02), and to be virally suppressed (OR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.20-1.87, p = .001); however, youth in these areas were also more likely to report missed medical appointments (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.07-1.63, p = .008).The findings underscore the multi-level and structural factors associated with ART use, missed HIV care appointments, and viral suppression for adolescents and young adults in the United States. Consideration of these factors is strongly recommended in future intervention, clinical practice, and policy research that seek to understand the contextual influences on individuals' health behaviors."

Neurosci. 2012; 32: 8521-8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Neuronal firing and changes in gene expression are linked by excitation-transcription (E-T) coupling, of which little is known in interneurons. In excitatory CNS neurons, upregulation of specific genes (e.g., c-Fos, Arc, and BDNF) depends on activation of CREB by phosphorylation at Ser133 (pCREB). Signaling to nuclear CREB can be triggered by electrical or chemical activation and is mediated by multiple Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways (Cohen and Greenberg, 2008Cohen S. Greenberg M.E. Communication between the synapse and the nucleus in neuronal development, plasticity, and disease.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 183-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). A fast Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent kinase (CaMK) pathway (operating in tens of seconds) and a slower mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (requiring many minutes) can trigger CREB phosphorylation and, thereby, drive gene expression. It has been proposed that interneurons use plasticity pathways distinct from those of principal neurons, on the basis of studies in cortical and hippocampal interneurons reporting low or undetectable levels of αCaMKII (Jones et al., 1994Jones E.G. Huntley G.W. Benson D.L. Alpha calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II selectively expressed in a subpopulation of excitatory neurons in monkey sensory-motor cortex: comparison with GAD-67 expression.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 611-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and calcineurin. It remains unclear whether findings about E-T coupling in excitatory neurons can be reliably extrapolated to GABAergic interneurons. For example, PV+ interneurons are remarkable for their fast-spiking phenotype, firing action potentials (APs) much faster than excitatory neurons at baseline and with stimulation (Kawaguchi et al., 1987Kawaguchi Y. Katsumaru H. Kosaka T. Heizmann C.W. Hama K. Fast spiking cells in rat hippocampus (CA1 region) contain the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin.Brain Res. 1987; 416: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, Royer et al., 2012Royer S. Zemelman B.V. Losonczy A. Kim J. Chance F. Magee J.C. Buzsáki G. Control of timing, rate and bursts of hippocampal place cells by dendritic and somatic inhibition.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The intense activity of PV+ neurons might cause larger and longer elevations of [Ca2+]i that could potentially saturate a replica of the machinery described in excitatory neurons. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the extreme Ca2+ dynamics in PV+ cells might necessitate a distinct E-T coupling pathway, characterized by slower responsiveness and distinct molecular components. Indeed, we uncovered a novel mechanism that differs from that in excitatory neurons in both qualitative and quantitative respects, in using a distinct protein for conveyance of signals to the nucleus, and in restricting levels of the nuclear CREB kinase to slow the dynamics of nuclear CREB phosphorylation. It is well known that activity of excitatory neurons triggers CREB phosphorylation upstream of gene regulation. However, it remains unclear whether CREB phosphorylation also occurs in PV+ inhibitory interneurons in response to physiologic stimuli. To address this in vivo, we subjected anesthetized mice to auditory stimulation, using 70 dB sound pressure level (SPL) broadband noise presented for 20 min. We then co-stained slices from stimulated or non-stimulated (control) mice with antibodies against PV and pCREB, and we examined the primary auditory cortex (Figure 1A). We found that the proportion of PV+ cells with pCREB+ nuclei was ∼3-fold greater after auditory stimulation than in control. This frames a series of questions about signaling to the nucleus in PV+ neurons. In general, CREB phosphorylation can occur in response to Ca2+ increases triggered by synaptic activity or neuronal depolarization. To quantify differences in neuronal activity between PV+ cells and excitatory neurons, we recorded unitary firing activity from putative interneurons and putative excitatory neurons in vivo using silicon probes implanted in rat frontal cortex. Interneurons (red) exhibited both a markedly higher instantaneous firing frequency and an ∼7-fold faster average firing rate than excitatory neurons (blue, Figure 1B). Neurons were classified by spike width: a narrow-spiking population was comprised principally of putative PV+ cells (Kawaguchi et al., 1987Kawaguchi Y. Katsumaru H. Kosaka T. Heizmann C.W. Hama K. Fast spiking cells in rat hippocampus (CA1 region) contain the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin.Brain Res. 1987; 416: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), while a wide-spiking population consisted mainly of excitatory neurons (Stark et al., 2013Stark E. Eichler R. Roux L. Fujisawa S. Rotstein H.G. Buzsáki G. Inhibition-induced theta resonance in cortical circuits.Neuron. 2013; 80: 1263-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These data quantitatively support the general belief that PV+ cells fire much faster than excitatory neurons in vivo. To determine how PV+ and excitatory neurons might differ in their Ca2+ dynamics at firing frequencies observed in vivo, cultured rat cortical neurons were driven by direct stimulation over a range of frequencies. Neurons were loaded with the green Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4, and Ca2+ responses to field stimulation were recorded (NBQX/APV present), followed by post hoc identification of PV+ and excitatory neurons (αCaMKII+) via immunostaining with specific antibodies. Ca2+ rose promptly in response to stimulation at ≥5 Hz (Figures 1C and S1). To capture the difference in firing rates in vivo, we superimposed inhibitory and excitatory responses to stimulus frequencies separated by 5- to 6-fold. In this context, the bulk Ca2+ increases in PV+ cells were higher and broader than in excitatory neurons. For example, PV+ cells firing at 5 or 30 Hz showed much greater Ca2+ responses, respectively, than those in excitatory neurons firing at 1 or 5 Hz (Figure 1C; Figure S1B compares traces obtained at the same frequencies). The impact of the ∼7-fold disparity in firing rates outweighed the ∼2-fold lesser sensitivity of PV+ cells to increases in firing rate (Figure S1C). Thus, based on recordings in culture, the relatively high firing rates of cortical PV+ cells in vivo would be expected to give rise to larger and more prolonged Ca2+ elevations than in excitatory neurons. To verify that this conclusion holds for genetically defined PV+ neurons in vivo, we performed two-photon Ca2+ imaging in the auditory cortex of awake, head-fixed mice. PV+ cells were identified by tdTomato expression and GCaMP6s Ca2+ transients were measured (Figure 1D). We recorded Ca2+ transients from PV+ cells and putative excitatory neurons, both spontaneous events and evoked transients in response to sensory input (pure tones). Targeted juxtacellular recordings confirmed that sound-evoked calcium signals were due to neuronal spiking and that GCaMP6s could detect single APs in PV+ neurons (Figure S2A). In PV+/tdTomato+ cells, sensory stimulation-evoked Ca2+ transients were broader and ∼2-fold higher than in PV−/tdTomato− putative excitatory neurons (Figure 1D4), similar to Figure 1C. The PV+ versus PV− disparity is seen in representative single-neuron recordings (Figures 1D2 and 1D3) and in population data (Figures 1D4 and 1D5). The larger amplitude and broader waveform were presumably due to PV+ cells firing APs at a higher frequency than excitatory neurons, consistent with our in vivo electrical recordings and Ca2+ imaging from cultured neurons. This inference is supported by previous work in auditory cortex showing that PV+ cells fire more rapidly in response to auditory stimuli than excitatory neurons (Li et al., 2015Li L.Y. Xiong X.R. Ibrahim L.A. Yuan W. Tao H.W. Zhang L.I. Differential receptive field properties of parvalbumin and somatostatin inhibitory neurons in mouse auditory cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2015; 25: 1782-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Spontaneous Ca2+ transients also displayed a similar disparity between PV+ cells and excitatory neurons (Figures S2C and S2D), as if differences in firing rates also held for animals at rest. In sum, these data support the idea that PV+ cells in vivo display particularly large Ca2+ increases due to their rapid firing, with possible implications for downstream Ca2+ signaling. The mechanisms for E-T coupling downstream of Ca2+ transients must ensure that inhibitory neurons stay within their useful dynamic range for signaling to the nucleus. Mindful of the differences in Ca2+ flux between PV+ and excitatory neurons, we set out to describe signaling pathways resulting in CREB phosphorylation and gene expression. To determine the requirements for CREB phosphorylation in PV+ cells, we used immunocytochemistry in rat cortical cultures (Figures 2, S3, and S4). Following field stimulation at 10 Hz, pCREB staining in the nucleus increased (average pixel intensity, nucleus − background). Strikingly, pCREB was seen to increase in the nucleus of excitatory neurons (blue), but not in PV+ cells (red), after 10 s of 10-Hz stimulation (Figure 2B). Kinetic differences also were apparent in analysis of frequency dependence. When APs were evoked by field stimulation at various frequencies for 60 s, a saturating level of pCREB in excitatory neurons was triggered by 10-Hz stimulation, while PV+ cells required much higher rates of 30- to 100-Hz stimulation to reach maximal response (Figure 2C). The amplitude of pCREB response was somewhat lower in PV+ cells, in line with less total CREB staining (Figure S4A). More importantly, the frequency-response relationship for PV+ cells was right-shifted by 6- to 10-fold, reminiscent of the ∼7-fold disparity in firing frequency (Figure 1B). This suggests that the sensitivity of PV+ cells to AP firing might be tuned to their high rates of firing and high Ca2+ flux; potentially, these cells also might use significantly different mechanisms of E-T coupling. To dissect the relative contribution of various Ca2+ sources toward CREB phosphorylation in PV+ cells, a 50-Hz stimulus was applied with or without pharmacological inhibition of glutamate receptors or CaV1 channels. In PV+ cells, CREB phosphorylation was blocked by specific CaV1 blocker nimodipine (Figure 2D), but not by APV/NBQX. Conversely, pCREB in excitatory neurons was prevented by either APV/NBQX or nimodipine, consistent with previous findings in hippocampal neurons (Deisseroth et al., 1996Deisseroth K. Bito H.

These data suggest that, in PV+ cells, CaV1 channels, but not glutamate receptors, play a privileged role in pCREB formation, in contrast with the joint dependence on CaV1 and glutamate receptors in excitatory neurons. While the role of CaV1 channels in communication with the nucleus has been characterized extensively in excitatory neurons (Cohen et al., 2015aCohen S.M. Li B. Tsien R.W. Ma H.

To study CaV-dependent signaling in isolation, we depolarized neurons to ∼−20 mV with 40 mM K+ (40K), while blocking spiking and neurotransmission with TTX, APV, and NBQX, and we monitored the phosphorylation of CREB (Figure 2E). Depolarization with 40K triggered a rapid Ca2+ increase (Figure S4B) as well as the formation of pCREB in PV+ cells and excitatory neurons (Figures 2E and S4C). Consistent with pCREB responses to AP stimulation, CREB phosphorylation in PV+ cells occurred with much slower kinetics than in excitatory neurons (PV+ cells, onset t1/2 = 35.9 ± 3.99 s; excitatory neurons, onset t1/2 = 8.24 ± 2.30 s). This time course seems well matched to the relatively long (tens of seconds) spontaneous Ca2+ transients seen in PV+ cells in vivo (Figure S2C). Slower onset kinetics of pCREB were still apparent in PV+ cells in response to stronger depolarization with 60K or 90K (depolarizing neurons to ∼−10 or 0 mV, respectively) (Figure S4D). It remained possible that a 10-s stimulus was sufficient for nuclear signaling, but that fixation interrupted translocation before nuclear pCREB could become visible. To address this issue, we followed a short depolarization (1 or 10 s) with a variable delay period prior to fixation. Following a 10-s depolarization, pCREB in excitatory neurons continued to rise, peaking 15 s after the stimulus ended (Figure 2F). In contrast, PV+ cells showed only a slight rise in pCREB 30 s after stimulation, with no increase at other time points. Likewise, following a 1-s depolarization, excitatory neurons displayed a prominent rise in pCREB after a 10- or 60-s time gap; in contrast, a 1-s depolarization failed to trigger any pCREB in PV+ cells (Figure S4E). Thus, the difference in pCREB at early time points cannot be explained simply by slower communication to the nucleus in PV+ cells once the depolarization-induced signal has been initiated. Instead, we hypothesize that PV+ interneurons and excitatory cells differ substantially in their stimulus requirements for cytonuclear communication. In sympathetic and excitatory neurons, Ca2+ is known to act locally within nanodomains near the CaV1 channel pore to activate a CaMK cascade that triggers translocation of Ca2+/CaM to the nucleus (Deisseroth et al., 1998Deisseroth K.

We first checked that depolarization-triggered pCREB in PV+ cells required CaV1-mediated Ca2+ influx. Indeed, nimodipine prevented pCREB induction upon 40K depolarization (Figure 3A). We next asked whether the target of Ca2+ action in PV+ cells also was localized at the CaV1 channel or whether more distant increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ were necessary. We compared the effects of EGTA, a slow Ca2+ chelator that buffers global Ca2+ but allows local Ca2+ increases within 1 μm of a channel pore, and of the fast Ca2+ chelator BAPTA, which buffers both global and local Ca2+ (Adler et al., 1991Adler E.M.

Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1496-1507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Deisseroth et al., 1996Deisseroth K. Bito H. Tsien R.W. Signaling from synapse to nucleus: postsynaptic CREB phosphorylation during multiple forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity.Neuron. 1996; 16: 89-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). CREB phosphorylation was blocked by BAPTA to the same extent as with nimodipine, but not by EGTA (Figure 3A). Thus, a local Ca2+ rise at CaV1 is necessary and sufficient to trigger pCREB. In contrast, following selective activation of CaV2 channels (90K + nimodipine), the increase in pCREB was prevented by EGTA as well as BAPTA. This indicates that Ca2+ does not act locally near CaV2 to initiate signaling to the nucleus; rather, Ca2+ entering the cell via CaV2 must act over a distance, possibly at CaV1 channels (Wheeler et al., 2012Wheeler D.G. Groth R.D. Ma H. Barrett C.F. Owen S.F. Safa P. Tsien R.W.

In excitatory neurons, local Ca2+ is important for activating a CaMK-mediated pathway (Wheeler et al., 2012Wheeler D.G. Groth R.D. Ma H. Barrett C.F. Owen S.F. Safa P. Tsien R.W.

To test whether CaMKs are important for nuclear signaling in PV+ cells, we applied KN93, a blocker of Ca2+/CaM binding to CaMKs, before 40K stimulation. Indeed, CREB phosphorylation was completely abolished by KN93, but not its inactive congener KN92. The specific CaMKK inhibitor STO609 also prevented pCREB. In contrast, pCREB was not prevented by inhibitors of PKC (bisindolylmaleimide I), PKA (KT5720), or MEK1 (PD98059) (Figures 3B and S5A). Clearly, in the context of a relatively brief stimulation, CaMKs mediate signaling to pCREB. CREB phosphorylation regulates transcription of many target genes (Impey et al., 2004Impey S. McCorkle S.R. Cha-Molstad H. Dwyer J.M. Yochum G.S. Boss J.M. McWeeney S. Dunn J.J. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Defining the CREB regulon: a genome-wide analysis of transcription factor regulatory regions.Cell. 2004; 119: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). To assay activity-dependent gene expression in PV+ cells, we depolarized neurons with 40K (or mock-stimulated in 4K) for 90 s, then waited 90 min before fixation and staining. The 40K triggered significant increases in the immunostaining intensity of protein products of c-Fos, Arc, Gad1 (encoding GAD67), Pvalb (encoding PV), and Wnt2 (Figures 3C, 3D, S5B, and S5C), all of which have a consensus CRE upstream of the cognate gene. The importance of CREB for regulation of PV and GAD67, a new finding, was verified by expression of a dominant-negative CREB (Figure S5D). Thus, depolarization triggered pCREB in tens of seconds, boosting levels of CREB target genes. To determine the role of CaV1 and CaMKs in mediating upregulation of these genes, we treated cells with nimodipine, KN93, or KN92 and assayed gene expression (Figures 3C, 3D, and S5C). Increases in expression of c-Fos, Arc, Gad1, Pvalb, and Wnt2 were all prevented by nimodipine or KN93. The control drug KN92 did not affect the increase in Arc, Pvalb, Gad1, or Wnt2 expression, while increases in c-Fos were partially reduced, possibly because of the inhibitory action of KN92 on CaV1 (Ca2+ flux reduced by ∼55% at 4 μM, Gao et al., 2006Gao L. Blair L.A. Marshall J. CaMKII-independent effects of KN93 and its inactive analog KN92: reversible inhibition of L-type calcium channels.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 345: 1606-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 did not significantly affect increases in expression of Arc, Gad1, Pvalb, or Wnt2, and partially reduced but partly spared the increases in c-Fos (Figure S5E). Overall, activation of CaV1 channels and CaMK signaling is critical in PV+ neurons for a wide range of activity-dependent gene expression, likely acting through Ser133 phosphorylation of CREB. How is a local Ca2+ signal propagated to the nucleus? We tested the possibility that, as in excitatory neurons (Deisseroth et al., 1998Deisseroth K. Heist E.K. Tsien R.W. Translocation of calmodulin to the nucleus supports CREB phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons.Nature. 1998; 392: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), CaM translocation underlies signaling to the nucleus in PV+ neurons. Consistent with this idea, increases in nuclear CaM in PV+ neurons were triggered by 40K (Figures 4A and S6A) or 50-Hz stimulation (Figure S6B) and blocked by nimodipine (Figures 4A and S6B). Furthermore, 40K-triggered increases were blocked by BAPTA but spared by EGTA (Figure 4B). CaM translocation also was blocked by KN93 or STO609, but not by KN92 (Figure 4A). These findings support the hypothesis that CaM translocation depends on local Ca2+ near the CaV1 channel pore and is regulated by a CaM kinase, rather than by free diffusion alone. Is CaM translocation required for CREB phosphorylation in PV cells? This idea was supported by the correlation between increases in nuclear CaM and nuclear pCREB (Figure 4C; R2 = 0.69). Once Ca2+/CaM arrives in the nucleus, it could in principle activate a potent nuclear CaMK cascade that depends steeply on [Ca2+/CaM] (Racioppi and Means, 2008Racioppi L. Means A.R.

We tested the necessity of nuclear CaM for CREB phosphorylation using a nuclear CaM-binding protein (nCaMBP, Wang et al., 1995Wang J. Campos B. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R.

In addition, nCaMBP expression attenuated PV staining intensity in PV+ cells (Figure 4F), supporting the idea that CaM signaling acts through CREB to regulate PV expression. In the wider population of GAD67+ neurons, nCaMBP also prevented pCREB (Figures S6C and S6D) and reduced GAD67 expression (Figure S6E). Thus, nuclear translocation of C"
https://openalex.org/W2341025701,"Gliomas are highly malignant brain tumors that are highly invasive and resistant to conventional therapy. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as PDGFRα (platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α), which show frequent aberrant activation in gliomas, are associated with a process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular alteration that confers a more invasive and drug-resistant phenotype. Although this phenomenon is well documented in human cancers, the processes by which RTKs including PDGFRα mediate EMT are largely unknown. Here, we report that SHP-2 (encoded by PTPN11) upregulates an EMT inducer, ZEB1, to mediate PDGFRα-driven glioma EMT, invasion and growth in glioma cell lines and patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs) using cell culture and orthotopic xenograft models. ZEB1 and activated PDGFRα were coexpressed in invasive regions of mouse glioma xenografts and clinical glioma specimens. Glioma patients with high levels of both phospho-PDGFRα (p-PDGFRα) and ZEB1 had significantly shorter overall survival compared with those with low expression of p-PDGFRα and ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 inhibited PDGFA/PDGFRα-stimulated glioma EMT, tumor growth and invasion in glioma cell lines and patient-derived GSCs. PDGFRα mutant deficient of SHP2 binding (PDGFRα-F720) or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) binding (PDGFRα-F731/42), knockdown of SHP2 or treatments of pharmacological inhibitor for PDGFRα-signaling effectors attenuated PDGFA/PDGFRα-stimulated ZEB1 expression, cell migration and GSC proliferation. Importantly, SHP-2 acts together with PI3K/AKT to regulate a ZEB1-miR-200 feedback loop in PDGFRα-driven gliomas. Taken together, our findings uncover a new pathway in which ZEB1 functions as a key regulator for PDGFRα-driven glioma EMT, invasiveness and growth, suggesting that ZEB1 is a promising therapeutic target for treating gliomas with high PDGFRα activation."
https://openalex.org/W2322194451,"Tumour tissue is infiltrated by myeloid cells that are reprogrammed into alternatively activated/regenerative (M2) macrophages. The contribution of major signalling pathways and their modulators/targets involved in the macrophage reprogramming is poorly known. Glioblastoma (malignant brain tumour) attracts and reprograms brain-resident microglia and peripheral macrophages into cells that increase invasion, angiogenesis and suppress antitumour immunity. Using a ‘function-first’ approach and glioma secretome proteomics we identified osteopontin and lactadherin as proteins that cooperatively activate amoeboid transformation, phagocytosis and motility of primary microglia cultures via integrins and FAK-Akt (focal adhesion kinase-Akt) signalling. A synthetic peptide interfering with integrin ligands blocks glioma–microglia communication, functional activation and M2 gene expression. We found that osteopontin/secreted phosphoprotein 1 (Spp1) produced by non-transformed cells acts as a proinflammatory factor inducing inflammatory signalling and M1 genes, and counteracts the action of lactadherin. Using constructs encoding functional mutants of osteopontin, we demonstrated sequential processing of Spp1 by thrombin and matrix metalloproteinase-3 and/or -7 (MMP-3 and/or -7) in glioma cells, which generates a microglia-activating form devoid of the inflammatory activity, while retaining the M2 reprogramming potential. A similar form of osteopontin is secreted by human glioma cells but not normal human astrocytes. Knockdown of osteopontin or lactadherin in glioma cells reduces intracranial glioma growth, blocks amoeboid transformation of myeloid cells and affects M2 reprogramming of microglia/macrophages. Our findings demonstrate how glioma cells misuse macrophage-activating signals and redesign primarily proinflammatory signals towards their advantage to induce M2 reprogramming of tumour-infiltrating brain macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2328518769,"Thermosensation is critical for optimal regulation of physiology and behavior. C. elegans acclimates to its cultivation temperature (Tc) and exhibits thermosensitive behaviors at temperatures relative to Tc. These behaviors are mediated primarily by the AFD sensory neurons, which are extraordinarily thermosensitive and respond to thermal fluctuations at temperatures above a Tc-determined threshold. Although cGMP signaling is necessary for thermotransduction, the thermosensors in AFD are unknown. We show that AFD-specific receptor guanylyl cyclases (rGCs) are instructive for thermosensation. In addition to being necessary for thermotransduction, ectopic expression of these rGCs confers highly temperature-dependent responses onto diverse cell types. We find that the temperature response threshold is determined by the rGC and cellular context, and that multiple domains contribute to their thermosensory properties. Identification of thermosensory rGCs in C. elegans provides insight into mechanisms of thermosensation and thermal acclimation and suggests that rGCs may represent a new family of molecular thermosensors."

As a basis for the entrainment of whisking by breathing, but not vice versa, we provide evidence for unidirectional connections from the preBötC to the vIRt. The preBötC further contributes to the control of the mystacial pad. Lastly, we show that bilateral synchrony of whisking relies on the respiratory rhythm, consistent with commissural connections between preBötC cells. These data yield a putative circuit in which the preBötC acts as a master clock for the synchronization of vibrissa, pad, and snout movements, as well as for the bilateral synchronization of whisking."
https://openalex.org/W2339848282,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common cancer of bone and the 5th leading cause of cancer-related death in young adults. Currently, 5-year survival rates have plateaued at ~70% for patients with localized disease. Those with disseminated disease have an ~20% 5-year survival. An improved understanding of the molecular genetics of OS may yield new approaches to improve outcomes for OS patients. To this end, we applied murine models that replicate human OS to identify and understand dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) in OS. miRNA expression patterns were profiled in murine primary osteoblasts, osteoblast cultures and primary OS cell cultures (from primary and paired metastatic locations) isolated from two genetically engineered murine models of OS. The differentially expressed miRNA were further assessed by a cross-species comparison with human osteoblasts and OS cultures. We identified miR-155-5p and miR-148a-3p as deregulated in OS. miR-155-5p suppression or miR-148a-3p overexpression potently reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis in OS cells, yet strikingly, did not impact normal osteoblasts. To define how these miRNAs regulated OS cell fate, we used an integrated computational approach to identify putative candidate targets and then correlated these with the cell biological impact. Although we could not resolve the mechanism through which miR-148a-3p impacts OS, we identified that miR-155-5p overexpression suppressed its target Ripk1 (receptor (TNFRSF)-interacting serine–threonine kinase 1) expression, and miR-155-5p inhibition elevated Ripk1 levels. Ripk1 is directly involved in apoptosis/necroptosis. In OS cells, small interfering RNA against Ripk1 prevented cell death induced by the sequestration of miR-155-5p. Collectively, we show that miR-148a-3p and miR-155-5p are species-conserved deregulated miRNA in OS. Modulation of these miRNAs was specifically toxic to tumor cells but not normal osteoblasts, raising the possibility that these may be tractable targets for miRNA-based therapies for OS."

Physiological evidence suggests corticogeniculate feedback may be organized into parallel streams; however, little is known about the diversity of corticogeniculate neurons, their local computations, or the structure-function relationship among corticogeniculate neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2337380334,"Targeted inhibitors of oncogenic Ras (rat sarcoma viral oncogene)-Raf signaling have shown great promise in the clinic, but resistance remains a major challenge: 30% of tumors with pathway mutations do not respond to targeted inhibitors, and of the 70% that do respond, all eventually develop resistance. Before cancer cells acquire resistance, they respond to initial drug treatment either by undergoing apoptosis ('addiction') or by surviving treatment albeit with reduced growth ('tolerance'). As these drug-tolerant cells serve as a reservoir from which resistant cells eventually emerge, inhibiting the pathways that confer tolerance could potentially delay or even prevent recurrence. Here, we show that melanomas and other cancers acquire tolerance to Ras-Raf pathway inhibitors by activating autophagy, which is mediated by the cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Blocking this AMPK-mediated autophagy sensitizes drug-tolerant melanomas to Ras-Raf pathway inhibitors. Conversely, activating AMPK signaling and autophagy enables melanomas that would otherwise be addicted to the Ras-Raf pathway to instead tolerate pathway inhibition. These findings identify a key mechanism of tolerance to Ras-Raf pathway inhibitors and suggest that blocking either AMPK or autophagy in combination with these targeted inhibitors could increase tumor regression and decrease the likelihood of eventual recurrence."

The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is a member of the CXC chemokine receptor family of GPCRs, and together with its ligand CXCL12 (also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1, SDF-1), they are important therapeutic targets. CXCR4 has been shown to be up-regulated in a number of cancers (13Chatterjee S. Behnam Azad B. Nimmagadda S. The intricate role of CXCR4 in cancer.Adv. Cancer Res. 2014; 124: 31-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), plays an important role in the maintenance of stem cells in the bone marrow (14Moll N.M. Ransohoff R.M.

We describe here the engineering of an i-body library from a human single Ig domain and the generation of specific high affinity binders to CXCR4 that appear to be blocking signaling from this GPCR in a selective fashion. Moreover, we demonstrate that these i-bodies can penetrate deep into the ligand binding pocket and contact residues that were previously only accessible to small molecule drugs. Finally, we show that the i-bodies can block inflammatory cell migration but do not mobilize stem cells, a valuable asset for long term therapy for cancer and fibrosis.

The coding sequence for the wild-type human NCAM Ig domain 1 was amplified from a Human Leukocyte Large-Insert cDNA library (BD Biosciences and Clontech) using oligonucleotides A0657 (5′-gtctcgcgccccagccggccatggccctgcaggtggatattgttcccagccag-3′) and A0658 (5′-gctggttgcggccgcctgaaagatcttcacgttgacggtggc-3′) and designated as clone 21H-5 (exact match to residues 20–115 from existing GenBankTM accession number AAH29119.1, residues 20–115). Crystallization trials for 21H-5 were set up using protein concentrated to 30 mg/ml using centrifugal concentrators (Millipore). Crystals were grown by the sitting drop method at room temperature in 1.45 m tri-sodium citrate, pH 6.88. The crystals belong to space group P21 with a = 23.85 Å, b = 107.327 Å, c = 41.748 Å and α = 90°, β = 99.573°, γ = 90°. The asymmetric unit contains two 21H-5 chains and has 38% solvent content. Diffraction data were collected from crystals flash-cooled in mother liquor supplemented with 30% ethylene glycol at 100 K using beamline MX2 at the Australian Synchrotron. Diffraction data were processed with XDS (29Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The 15-mer i-body library was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (35Kunkel T.A. Rapid and efficient site-specific mutagenesis without phenotypic selection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar) and cloned into pHENH6. The i-body 10–20 library was based on the parent clone 21H-5 and was synthesized by GeneArt (now Life Technologies, Inc.) using synthetic oligonucleotides to produce insert sizes in the range 324–354 bp. Fully randomized 6-residue CDR1 and 10–20-residue CDR3 loop regions replaced NH2-27DAKDKD32-COOH and NH2-80TGEDGSES87-COOH, respectively, from 21H-5. These randomized regions were synthesized with nucleotide mixtures of N nucleotide ambiguity at the first and second bases of the codon (25% cytosine, 25% thymine, 25% adenine, 25% guanine) and K nucleotide ambiguity at the third base of the codon position (50% guanine and 50% thymine). The library was amplified and cloned into pHENH6 via SfiI and NotI cloning sites (thus fusing the i-body proteins with the bacteriophage pIII coat protein), and transformed into TG1 cells. Monoclonal antibody 5G8, which recognizes Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (3D7 strain) (28Coley A.M. Campanale N.V. Casey J.L. Hodder A.N. Crewther P.E. Anders R.F. Tilley L.M. Foley M. Rapid and precise epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum AMA1 by combined phage display of fragments and random peptides.Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), was immobilized on Nunc Maxisorp Microplates (Thermo Scientific) at 1 μg/ml. Integral Molecular provided the lipoparticles (in biotinylated and non-biotinylated formats) harboring the human CXCR4 protein, and “null” lipoparticles lacking it. Streptavidin-coated M280 Dynabeads were from Invitrogen. The 15-mer and i-body 10–20 libraries (in pHENH6 and TG1 cells) were amplified at the beginning of each panning campaign according to the following procedure: 1 ml of library stock was inoculated into 10 ml of 2YT medium and incubated for 1 h at 37 °;C with shaking. Ampicillin (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, and after 1 h of incubation at 37 °;C the culture was inoculated into 200 ml of 2YT containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 1% (w/v) glucose (Sigma) and incubation was continued at 37 °;C with shaking until the absorbance at A600 nm was 0.4–0.6. A 25-ml aliquot was removed, to which 1011–1012 of kanamycin-resistant M13KO7 helper phage particles (New England Biolabs) were added. The culture was incubated for 1 h without shaking at 37 °;C, and then the cell pellet was collected by centrifugation at 8,000 × g, resuspended in 3 ml of 2YT, and inoculated into 200 ml of 2YT containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 70 μg/ml kanamycin (Sigma). The culture was incubated for 15 h with shaking at 30 °;C. The supernatant was clarified twice by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and 0.2 volumes of 20% (w/v) PEG 8000 (Sigma) and 2.5 m NaCl (Sigma) was added. The phage particles were precipitated by incubation on ice for 2 h with gentle agitation, then collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and resuspended in 2 ml of PBS. To remove unwanted phage binders to the milk powder blocking solution used in subsequent steps, 500 μl of phage preparation solution was combined with 500 μl of 10% (w/v) milk powder in 1× PBS. Dynabeads (50 μl) were washed twice with 1 ml of PBS and then resuspended in 1 ml of 5% (w/v) milk powder in 1× PBS (MPBS) and incubated at room temperature for 60 min with very gentle rotation. The blocking solution was removed, and beads were resuspended in 50 μl of MPBS. Solution-based panning was then performed using two preliminary negative selection approaches (depletion and competition) to minimize the recovery of unwanted binders (i.e. binders to the blocking solution, Dynabeads, or lipoparticle scaffold). In the depletion-style negative selection method, binders to biotinylated null lipoparticles were removed prior to panning on CXCR4 lipoparticles as follows: 40 μl of biotinylated null lipoparticles were combined with 1 ml of phage and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with mixing. Blocked streptavidin beads (50 μl) were then added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with mixing. Magnetic beads along with biotinylated null lipoparticles and bound phage were removed using a magnetic rack, and the remaining phage supernatant was used for panning against CXCR4 lipoparticles. In the competition-style negative selection method, non-biotinylated null lipoparticles were present in the panning solution where they “competed” with biotinylated CXCR4 lipoparticles for unwanted nonspecific binders; 40 μl of non-biotinylated null lipoparticles were combined with 1 ml of phage and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with mixing. This mixture was used directly in panning against CXCR4 lipoparticles. For panning, 50 μl of biotinylated CXCR4 lipoparticles (equivalent to 40 units of CXCR4) were combined with negatively selected phage and incubated at room temperature for 2 h with mixing. 50 μl of blocked Dynabeads were added, and incubation was continued for 30 min at room temperature with mixing, before magnetic capture of the assembled beads, lipoparticles, and bound phage. Unbound phage were removed by washing with PBS and PBS + 0.5% (v/v) Tween (PBS-T) as follows: round one (R1), three washes with PBS; R2 three washes with PBS-T and then three washes with PBS; R3 and R4, six washes with PBS-T and then six washes with PBS for rounds three and four, and except for R4 the final wash solution was incubated for 5 min prior to removal. Following the last wash of each round, beads were transferred to a clean tube, and antigen-bound phage was eluted with 500 μl of 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.0). The eluate was neutralized to pH 8 with 1.5 m Tris-HCl and used to infect TG1 cells to amplify the selected i-body clones for the subsequent panning round. Amplification of eluted phage between each panning round was performed as follows: eluted phage were added to 10 ml of TG1 cells in log phase, incubated at 37 °;C for 30 min without agitation, and then for 30 min with agitation. 1011–1012 of M13KO7 helper phage particles were added to the infected cells, and incubation at 37 °;C was continued for 30 min without shaking. The culture was then inoculated into 200 ml of 2YT containing ampicillin at 100 μg/ml and kanamycin at 70 μg/ml and incubated overnight at 30 °;C with shaking. Phage were precipitated as described above and subjected to the next panning round. Phage were titered in between panning rounds as follows: 10 μl of each phage preparation was added to 490 μl of log-phage TG1 cells; 20 μl was then removed and diluted with 2YT in a 10-fold series in a 96-well plate. 20 μl of each dilution point was spread onto an agar plate containing ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37 °;C. Phage ELISAs were performed with pools of phage particles eluted from panning rounds and with single-clone phage particles. To prepare phage particles from an individual clone, 10 ml of 2YT with 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with a single colony and incubated with shaking at 37 °;C for 4 h. Helper phage and kanamycin were added, and the cultures were incubated for 15 h as described above. Phage particles were precipitated and resuspended as described above except that the final resuspension volume was 1 ml. For ELISAs, the wells of 96-well plates (Nunc) were coated in duplicate with 100 μl per well of mAb 5G8 or lysozyme at 1 μg/ml or with lipoparticles (CXCR4, CCR5, or null) at 1 unit/well. Phage were diluted at least 1:10 in probing solution (5% MPBS, to normalize titers), added to the wells, and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The wells were washed five times with PBS-T, and then bound phage were detected with an anti-M13-HRP antibody (GE Healthcare) by using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Thermo Fisher) as an enzyme substrate. Separate 4-μl aliquots of crude periplasmic extracts of i-body AD5G8-5 were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 99 °;C, and then cooled at 4 °;C for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged to collect precipitated protein, and the remaining soluble protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie staining. For the long term stability trial, separate 50-μl aliquots (in singlicate) of AD5G8-5 at 0.12 mg/ml were adjusted to pH values of 3, 4.5 (using 0.2 m Na2HPO4 and 0.1 m citric acid), and 7.4 (using PBS), and pH values of 8.5 and 11.0 (using 25 mm borax buffer) and incubated at 4, 37, and 50 °;C for 4 weeks. Unheated control samples were stored at −20 °;C throughout. Following incubation, samples were neutralized to pH 7.4 with 1 m Tris, pH 11.5 (for samples at pH 3.0 and 4.5), or with 1 m HCl (for samples at pH 8.5 and 11.0). Residual active protein was quantified by fully automated SPR-based concentration assay described previously (7Griffiths K. Dolezal O. Parisi K. Angerosa J. Dogovski C. Barraclough M. Sanalla A. Casey J.L. González I. Perugini M.A. Nuttall S. Foley M. Shark variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) single domain antibody fragments: stability and diagnostic applications.Antibodies. 2013; 2: 66-81Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Residual binding activity in diversely treated anti-5G8 i-body samples was determined using a ProteOn XPR36 instrument (Bio-Rad). All immobilization and concentration determination measurements were performed at 25 °;C with instrumental fluidics primed in 1× HBS-EP + (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA 0.05% (v/v) surfactant P20, pH 7.4). The concentration detection method was configured as a direct detection assay with quantification estimates being derived from a calibration standard, that being an untreated sample stored at 4 °;C (t = 0). Standard curve was established by a parallel injection of six different concentrations of t = 0 sample (500, 1,000, 2,000, 4,000, and 8,000 ng/ml) across the immobilized 5G8 IgG protein. Residual active concentrations of unknown samples were determined by injecting six samples simultaneously at 25 ml/min for 60 s and comparing their initial binding rates (at t = 5–20 s) to those generated by the calibration standards. Bound samples were regenerated from the surface with a single injection of 10 mm glycine, pH 2.2, at 100 ml/min for 15 s. Kinetic binding analysis of selected i-bodies with immobilized CXCR4 lipoparticles was performed at 25 °;C using BIAcore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). Streptavidin immobilization was performed in 1× HBS-P+ running buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v), Tween 20). Amine coupling kit (GE Healthcare) and the instructions therein were utilized for the attachment of streptavidin (Sigma; diluted to 100 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5) in all four channels on the sensor chip surface simultaneously, resulting in >6,000 response units of streptavidin being coupled (1 response unit = 1 pg of protein/mm2). All binding experiments involving lipoparticles were performed with 1× HBS/BSA (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml BSA) as instrument running buffer. Biotinylated CXCR4 lipoparticles (Integral Molecular, catalog no. LEV-101B; 3.6 units/ml) were typically diluted 1:20 in the running buffer and immobilized onto a streptavidin-containing channel by injecting at 2 μl/ml for 1,800 s resulting in captured response levels of greater than 2,500 response units. Biotinylated CCR5 and null lipoparticles, used as off-target controls, were immobilized in a similar manner. To determine binding kinetics, serial dilutions (3-fold) of i-bodies diluted in 1× HBS/BSA were injected over immobilized lipoparticles with the association and dissociation phases monitored for 60 and 600 s, respectively. A control measurement of the instrument running buffer (“zero-buffer” blank) solution was also included for double referencing purposes. No regeneration of CXCR4 lipoparticle surface was required between injection cycles as bound i-bodies fully dissociated within 600 s in the running buffer. An SPR assay was designed to assess competition between CXCL12 and the i-bodies. This consisted of i-body injection followed by CXCL12 injection. A streptavidin chip containing immobilized biotinylated CXCR4 lipoparticles was prepared as described above. The assay assumes that binding competition occurs when the pre-bound i-body on the CXCR4 surface, at least partially, reduces the CXCL12 binding response. Injection of running buffer (RB) prior to CXCL12 ligand injection provided a baseline (no inhibition) response. CD spectra were recorded using an AVIV Model 420 CD spectrometer using similar methods described previously (36Perugini M.A. Schuck P. Howlett G.J.

In this study, we identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP1), a crucial factor in DNA repair, as an HBx-interacting protein using a proteomics approach. Coimmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays confirmed the binding and colocalization of HBx and PARP1 in the nucleus. The carboxyl-terminus of HBx protein bound to the catalytic domain of PARP1, and this binding reduced the enzymatic activity of PARP1 in both in vitro and in vivo assays. HBx interrupted the binding of PARP1 to Sirt6, which catalyzes the mono-ADP-ribosylation required for DNA repair. Consistently, overexpression of HBx inhibited the clearance of γH2AX DNA repair foci generated under oxidative stress in Chang liver cells. Recruitment of the DNA repair complex to the site-specific double-strand breaks was inhibited in the presence of HBx, when measured by laser microirradiation assay and damage-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Consequently, HBx increased signs of DNA damage such as accumulation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and comet formation, which were reversed by overexpression of PARP1 and/or Sirt6. Finally, the interaction between PARP1 and Sirt6 was markedly lower in the livers of HBx-transgenic mice and specimens obtained from HCC patients to compare with the corresponding control. Our data suggest that the physical interaction of HBx and PARP1 accelerates DNA damage by inhibiting recruitment of the DNA repair complex to the damaged DNA sites, which may lead to the onset of hepatocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2337307831,"Oncogenic Ras expression is associated with activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, as evidenced by elevated DNA damage, primarily DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and activation of DNA damage checkpoints, which in primary human cells leads to entry into senescence. DDR activation is viewed as a physiological barrier against uncontrolled proliferation in oncogenic Ras-expressing cells, and arises in response to genotoxic stress due to the production of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA and to hyper-replication stress. Although oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is considered a tumor suppressor mechanism, the accumulation of DNA damage in senescent cells is thought to cause genomic instability, eventually allowing secondary hits in the genome that promote tumorigenesis. To date, the molecular mechanisms behind DNA repair defects during OIS remain poorly understood. Here, we show that oncogenic Ras expression in human primary cells results in the downregulation of BRCA1 and 53BP1, two key factors in DNA DSB repair by homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, respectively. As a consequence, Ras-induced senescent cells are hindered in their ability to recruit BRCA1 and 53BP1 to DNA damage sites. Whereas BRCA1 is downregulated at transcripts levels, 53BP1 loss is caused by activation of cathepsin L-mediated degradation of 53BP1 protein. Moreover, we discovered a marked downregulation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) during OIS, and a role for the vitamin D/VDR axis regulating the levels of these DNA repair factors during OIS. This study reveals a new functional relationship between the oncogene Ras, the vitamin D/VDR axis and the expression of DNA repair factors, in the context of OIS. The observed deficiencies in DNA repair factors in senescent cells could contribute to the genomic instability that allows senescence bypass and tumorigenesis."

One mechanism by which the brain accomplishes this is by remapping visual receptive fields around the time of a saccade. In this process a neuron can be excited by a probe stimulus in the current receptive field, and also simultaneously by a probe stimulus in the location that will be brought into the neuron’s receptive field by the saccade (the future receptive field), even before saccade begins. Here we show that perisaccadic neuronal excitability is not limited to the current and future receptive fields but encompasses the entire region of visual space across which the current receptive field will be swept by the saccade. A computational model shows that this receptive field expansion is consistent with the propagation of a wave of activity across the cerebral cortex as saccade planning and remapping proceed. Humans and monkeys have access to an accurate representation of visual space despite a constantly moving eye. One mechanism by which the brain accomplishes this is by remapping visual receptive fields around the time of a saccade. In this process a neuron can be excited by a probe stimulus in the current receptive field, and also simultaneously by a probe stimulus in the location that will be brought into the neuron’s receptive field by the saccade (the future receptive field), even before saccade begins.

A computational model shows that this receptive field expansion is consistent with the propagation of a wave of activity across the cerebral cortex as saccade planning and remapping proceed. Our eyes move constantly, with brief intervals of fixation separated by rapid movements, or saccades. Each saccade changes the retinal location of objects in the world, yet we perceive the world to be stable (Hallett and Lightstone, 1976Hallett P.E. Lightstone A.D. Saccadic eye movements to flashed targets.Vision Res. 1976; 16: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, Mays and Sparks, 1980Mays L.E. Sparks D.L. Saccades are spatially, not retinocentrically, coded.Science. 1980; 208: 1163-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). One way that the brain can solve the problem of spatial accuracy is through the phenomenon of predictive remapping of the visual receptive field: neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) will respond to an object that will be brought into their receptive fields by an impending saccade even before the saccade begins (Duhamel et al., 1992bDuhamel J.R. Colby C.L. Goldberg M.E. The updating of the representation of visual space in parietal cortex by intended eye movements.Science. 1992; 255: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). This enables neurons to respond in a spatially accurate manner when there is a dissonance between the retinal location of a probe stimulus and vector of the saccade necessary to acquire that probe stimulus. The intensity of the response to a probe stimulus in the presaccadic, or current receptive field (CRF), declines as the cell begins to respond to a probe stimulus in the postsaccadic, or future receptive field (FRF) (Kusunoki and Goldberg, 2003Kusunoki M. Goldberg M.E. The time course of perisaccadic receptive field shifts in the lateral intraparietal area of the monkey.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 1519-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Before the saccade, however, there is a period of time during which the cell can respond to stimuli in both the CRF and FRF. This phenomenon is equivalent to a transient expansion of the receptive field, and this increase in receptive field size may be responsible for the well-known mislocalization of objects that flash close to the time of saccade (Dassonville et al., 1992Dassonville P.

Morrone M.C. Burr D.C. Compression of visual space before saccades.Nature. 1997; 386: 598-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). However, it is not known if this paradoxical expansion of the receptive field is limited to the CRF and FRF, or whether the receptive field expands across a larger area of the retina (Figure 1A). To distinguish among these possibilities, we studied the spatial and temporal features of visual remapping by examining the responses of LIP neurons to a task-irrelevant probe stimulus that appeared briefly before, during, or after a saccade at one of five different spatial locations (Figure 1B): the CRF, the FRF, an intermediate location midway between the two receptive fields (IML), a mirror location of IML across the saccade trajectory (MIML), and a distal location (DL) beyond the FRF into which the receptive field would move if the saccade were larger. We found that immediately before the saccade, LIP neurons respond to stimuli flashed in the space across which the saccade sweeps the retinal receptive field, but not elsewhere in the visual field. The latency of responses for probe stimulus at the IML is shorter than that for probe stimulus at the FRF. We present a computational model of perisaccadic remapping that uses a wave of activity across the cortex to provide a mechanism for remapping. The model predicts the extent and timing of receptive field expansion. We recorded perisaccadic activity of approximately 100 LIP neurons in one hemisphere of each of two monkeys. Because the results were similar in both monkeys, we pooled the neurons. We first mapped the receptive field of the neurons, either by using a memory-guided saccade task or an automated method in which we flashed stimuli for 50 ms at randomly chosen locations on a 40° × 40° grid (Falkner et al., 2010Falkner A.L. Krishna B.S. Goldberg M.E. Surround suppression sharpens the priority map in the lateral intraparietal area.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 12787-12797Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We then positioned a fixation point and a saccade target so that the saccade target would not lie in the receptive field of the neuron under study, but the saccade would bring the task-irrelevant probe at FRF into the receptive field. Because LIP receptive fields are large, we usually positioned the saccade target in the ipsilateral visual field, where the saccade would be unable to drive the cell. In our sample, 41 neurons showed remapping, and we studied only these neurons further. For each neuron, we chose three to five possible locations for a task-irrelevant probe stimulus. On each trial, we flashed a probe stimulus for roughly 20–50 ms in one of the five potential probe stimulus locations, chosen pseudorandomly, at a time from 300 ms before to 300 ms after the fixation point disappeared (Figure 1B). The monkey made the same saccade on every trial, and its saccadic accuracy was not affected by any of the probe stimuli. On 10% of the trials, we did not flash a probe stimulus at all, to assess the eye position and perisaccadic sensitivity of the cell and to ensure that the saccade target itself could not evoke a response from the cell. As expected, the probe stimulus in the CRF evoked a brisk response when it appeared well before the beginning of the saccade, with a strong phasic and a weaker tonic response. When it appeared at a time closer to the saccade, the tonic response became weaker and stopped at the beginning of the saccade (Figure 2, left panel). The probe stimulus in the IML was outside the cell’s CRF and FRF. It failed to evoke a response when it appeared well before or after the saccade began (Figure 2, center panel). However, it started to evoke a response slightly before the saccade began. When the probe stimulus first began to evoke a response in the IML, well before the saccade, the response was time locked to the beginning of the saccade, and when the probe appeared closer to the saccade onset, the response was time locked to the appearance of the probe (Figure 2, center panel). Note that the probe in the FRF evoked a response in the neuron when it appeared before the saccade, and continued to do so after the saccade, when it actually lay in the ordinary receptive field of the neuron. This pattern of activity holds across most of the population of neurons that we studied. A total of 35/41 neurons had a statistically significant response to the probe in the IML (p < 0.05 by Wilcoxon signed-rank). We plotted the spatiotemporal activity of the population as a set of heat maps, with response intensity as a function of time from the beginning of the saccade. Neuronal activity was displayed as color, for 10 ms epochs of the time between the disappearance of the probe stimulus and the beginning of the saccade, ranging from the probe stimulus disappearing between 300 and 290 ms before the saccade to 290 to 300 ms after the saccade (Figure 3). When the probe stimulus appeared in the FRF or IML well before the beginning of the saccade, it did not evoke a response. However, as the probe stimulus appeared closer in time to the saccade, it began to evoke a response. Around the beginning of the saccade, the probe stimulus evoked a response from all three spatial locations. To study the response to the probe in all three locations quantitatively, we plotted the normalized mean activity in the first 150 ms after the probe onset against time relative to the beginning of the saccade (Figure 4). The IML response became significantly greater than the baseline (activity in the interval 200–150 ms before the probe onset, a time at which activity did not differ as function of probe location, whether the probe appeared in the FRF or the IML) in the interval 150–100 ms before the saccade (p < 0.003 by Wilcoxon rank-sum) and remained so until the saccade began, but the FRF response became significant only 100–50 ms before the saccade. Furthermore, the peak CRF response was significantly stronger than the peak IML response (p < 6 × 10−5), which was itself significantly stronger then the FRF response (p < 0.03). The expansion of the receptive field along the trajectory of the saccade was limited to areas of the visual field across which the retinal receptive field swept during the saccade. For 17 neurons, we placed a probe stimulus in a location directly across the saccade trajectory from the IML, the MIML (Figure 1). This location drove the cells little if at all when the monkey looked at the original fixation point or the saccade goal, and, unlike for the IML, stimuli at the MIML evoked little activity in the immediate perisaccadic epoch (Figure S1, available online). Furthermore, the receptive field did not expand beyond the trajectory of the saccade. For 14 cells, we placed the fourth probe location along the same trajectory as the IML but expanded beyond where the FRF would be expected during the saccade, the DL (Figure 1). Probes placed in the DL did not evoke any activity in the neurons (Figure S2). To understand remapping in the context of receptive field expansion, we designed a computational model in which activity sweeps across the cortex from the representation of the FRF to the representation of the CRF, in a manner similar to a mental rotation. For simplicity, we first present a unidimensional, unidirectional version of the model. Consider a network with two inputs: a set of visual inputs and a set of corollary discharge (CD) inputs representing saccades of different amplitudes in one direction, and an output layer that is equivalent to the LIP priority map (Figure 5). The visual inputs and LIP output neurons share a retinotopic map, such that a visual probe stimulus arriving in the input layer can drive the LIP output neuron. Each output neuron also receives a CD of the saccade. Finally, each neuron in the output layer receives an input from the adjacent neuron whose response field is closer to the FRF than the CRF. Although the direct visual input can drive the output layer, neither the CD nor the adjacent connections can, by themselves, drive the output layer. To provide the CD signal, we take advantage of the “moving hill” of saccade activity in the superior colliculus: when a monkey makes a long saccade, activity begins in the intermediate layers of the caudal colliculus with neurons whose movement field describes the actual saccade. As the saccade proceeds, CD activity migrates from the saccade amplitude site toward the rostral colliculus, so that saccadic burst cells with movement fields closer to the center of gaze start to discharge at times closer to the end of saccade, until the rostral colliculus begins to discharge, at which time the saccade ends (Munoz and Wurtz, 1995Munoz D.P. Wurtz R.H. Saccade-related activity in monkey superior colliculus. II. Spread of activity during saccades.J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 73: 2334-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The cells with movement fields closer to the fovea discharge when the monkey plans a large saccade, even though the saccade goal does not lie in the movement field of the cell. The cells with small movement fields begin to discharge after the cell whose movement field is the goal of the saccade. We assume that this collicular signal reaches LIP through a disynaptic pathway through the thalamus (Stanton et al., 1977Stanton G.B. Cruce W.L.R. Goldberg M.E. Robinson D.L. Some ipsilateral projections to areas PF and PG of the inferior parietal lobule in monkeys.Neurosci. Lett. 1977; 6: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). During the remapping process, when the probe stimulus appears in the FRF, a neuron whose receptive field lies in the spatial location of the FRF discharges. This neuron is connected to an adjacent cortical neuron whose receptive field lies on a line between the FRF and the CRF (Figure 5). Although the FRF neuron cannot ordinarily excite the adjacent neuron, the presence of the CD signal enables the adjacent neuron to discharge. The second neuron, in turn, projects to an adjacent neuron on the same line, which can now discharge because it is also excited by the CD of the impending saccade. The activity spreads along the cortex until the probe stimulus in the FRF can excite the cell whose receptive field is ordinarily limited to the CRF, as can be seen from the instantiation of the model (Figure 6A; sac and probe 30°). When the FRF is farther away from the CRF, the wave proceeds over a larger area of cortex and takes a longer time to complete the remapping process (Figure 6A; sac and probe 50°). The activation of the CRF cell by the IML probe stimulus occurs as a result of the wave. Consider that the IML probe stimulus is in the FRF for a different cell (XCRF). The CRF cell lies between the IML probe stimulus and the XCRF cell, and the wave of excitation excites the CRF cell as a consequence of the remapping of the XCRF cell (Figure 6A; sac 40°, probe 20°). Because the IML cell is closer in the cortex to the CRF cell, a probe stimulus in its receptive field will excite the CRF cell before a remapped probe stimulus in the FRF, which is consistent with our data. Similarly, the probe stimulus at DL cannot excite the CRF cell because a wave of excitation initiated by a probe stimulus at DL does not reach the CRF cell (Figure 6A; sac 40°, probe 60°). The wave model reproduces the spatiotemporal responses of the CRF neurons to probe stimuli at the CRF, intermediate, FRF, and distal locations (compare Figure 6B with Figure 3). Although it was not constrained to do so, the model also reproduces three properties of remapping that we have discovered: (1) the decrease in response latency as the distance from the probe stimulus to the CRF decreases (Figure 6B; compare with Figure 4), (2) the shift in synchrony from saccade to stimulus onset as the stimulus-saccade interval decreases (Figure 7A; compare with Figure 2), and (3) the decrease in the amplitude in the transient response to the probe stimulus as the distance between the probe and the CRF increases (Figure 7B; compare with Figure 4). We present the mathematical details of the model in the Experimental Procedures. The model as described only works for a single direction of saccade. In order to affect remapping in the opposite direction of saccade, we posit a second group of output neurons that receive CD signals from saccades in the opposite direction, with active lateral connections also in the opposite direction. Output cells sharing a receptive field can mutually excite each other, so that each output cell can report remapping in either direction even though it belongs to a network that only calculates the remapping in one saccade direction (Figure 8A). Segregating the saccadic inputs renders the problem of expanding the model to a two-dimensional retina relatively trivial. Consider two different scenarios: a remapping of the same cell with a 30° saccade and a 330° saccade (Figure 8B). Although the stimulus in the FRF and the saccade goal (FP2) is the same for each saccade, the beginning fixation points are quite different (FP1a and FP1b), as are the spatial locations of the CRF (CRFa and CRFb). In our model, every output cell in LIP is connected to one direction of CD, but instead of being limited to CDs of opposite directions, as in the unidimensional case, different output cells sharing the same CRF are connected to different CDs covering the entire range of saccade directions, ipsilateral as well as contralateral (Figure 8C). This enables a cell with a given CRF to remap to any spatial location of the FRF in the visual field as long as the combination of saccade and original fixation point are geometrically suitable for the remapping. In the example shown, one unidimensional network receives a set of CD inputs in the direction of saccade A (red curved arrow from the 30° line in the superior colliculus), so when the monkey is looking at FP1a and planning a saccade to FP2, it remaps the stimulus in the FRF easily to the CRF, which occupies the spatial location of CRFa. As the wave proceeds along the cortex, the lateral connections between cells with the same retinotopic receptive field excite the entire population of cells. Thus, although only one network receives the proper CD and has a cortical wave that accomplishes the actual remapping, the remainder of the cells exhibit remapping via the lateral connections. The saccade A network does not receive any CD inputs in the direction of saccade B. When the monkey is looking at FP1b and planning a saccade to FP2, a second network, which receives the CD in the direction of saccade B, remaps the stimulus in the FRF to the CRF, which now occupies the spatial location of CRFb. The lateral connections again excite the cells with the same receptive fields as the cells in the remapping network, but those cells do not participate in the remapping wave. Thus, every cell sharing this receptive field will exhibit an appropriate remapping response for every geometrically appropriate saccade, even though only one unidimensional, unidirectional network performed the actual remapping calculation. Although early studies of the physiology of cortical visual areas assumed that receptive fields were locked to the retina (Wurtz, 1969Wurtz R.H. Response of striate cortex neurons to stimuli during rapid eye movements in the monkey.J. Neurophysiol. 1969; 32: 975-986PubMed Google Scholar), more recent studies have shown that this is not always the case. Thus, in V4, retinal locations shift toward the goal of a saccade (Tolias et al., 2001Tolias A.S. Moore T. Smirnakis S.M. Tehovnik E.J. Siapas A.G. Schiller P.H. Eye movements modulate visual receptive fields of V4 neurons.Neuron. 2001; 29: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and toward the locus of the monkey’s attention (Connor et al., 1996Connor C.E.

Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 1306-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) even in the absence of a saccade. In particular, many neurons in LIP (Duhamel et al., 1992bDuhamel J.R. Colby C.L.

Neurophysiol. 1995; 73: 1988-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) show predictive remapping. They shift their receptive fields around the time of a saccade so that a probe stimulus that will be brought into their receptive field by the saccade can drive the cell before the saccade, even though the probe stimulus is in a location that would not drive the cell during a fixation task. Furthermore, stimuli that appear and disappear outside the fixation receptive field can evoke a response after a saccade that brings the spatial location of the vanished probe stimulus into the receptive field, even though the cell may not show predictive remapping (Duhamel et al., 1992bDuhamel J.R.

This study examined the fine structure of the spatial and temporal dynamics of the receptive field shift. We discovered that for predictive shifts, the receptive field expands along the trajectory of the saccade. The receptive field expansion does not occur all at once; probes at the IML evoke a visual response before the probe at the FRF, such that the receptive expands toward the FRF like a rubber band anchored in the CRF. The receptive field does not expand into regions across which the receptive field does not sweep, either for loci between the fixation point and the saccade goal, or for loci beyond the saccade goal. Because the neurons responded to stimuli that occurred well before the saccade, it is clear that the receptive field change occurs as a result of a CD of the motor command. Sommer and Wurtz, 2006Sommer M.A. Wurtz R.H. Influence of the thalamus on spatial visual processing in frontal cortex.Nature. 2006; 444: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar showed that the source of the CD that shifts the receptive fields in the FEF is the superior colliculus, via a signal relayed through the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus. The collicular CD signal, however, is not limited to cells whose movement fields lay at the goal of the saccade. Instead, there is a spread of activity from caudal to rostral, such that neurons with movement fields successively closer to the center of gaze fire later. This moving hill of activity was originally suggested to be a mechanism by which activity in the colliculus terminated the saccade by ultimately exciting the fixation zone in the rostral colliculus (Sparks, 1993Sparks D.L. Are gaze shifts controlled by a ‘moving hill’ of activity in the superior colliculus?.Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 214-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, a band of inactivation across the entire colliculus failed to alter saccade amplitude (Aizawa and Wurtz, 1998Aizawa H. Wurtz R.H. Reversible inactivation of monkey superior colliculus. I. Curvature of saccadic trajectory.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 2082-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), instead only causing a curvature of the saccade. This left no plausible function for the spread of activity in the colliculus, a paradox. Here we demonstrate a model that takes advantage of a CD of the spread of activity in the colliculus to facilitate a transcortical spread of activity that results in the remapping. The model invokes a spread of activity in the cortex from the static representation of the FRF to the static representation of the CRF, using a CD of the saccade to enable a wave of excitation from the cell that originally responded to the FRF probe stimulus to the CRF cell. The model predicts that a probe stimulus at the IML will drive the CRF cell as a consequence of the transcortical spread of activity evoked by remapping of a probe stimulus from the IML to a cell whose receptive field is at XCRF and in whose receptive field IML will lay after the saccade. We developed the model to explain remapping with receptive field expansion. The model also explains three other phenomena of receptive field expansion that we had not imposed as constraints of the model, nor had we predicted when we designed the experiment. (1) There are two modes of latency seen in the response to the IML probe: the response to the IML probe is time locked to the saccade when probe appears well before the saccade, but becomes time locked to the probe appearance when the probe appears closer to the saccade (Figure 7A). When the probe stimulus appears well before the saccade, the IML cell begins to discharge, but it cannot excite the adjacent cell until the CD enables the connection, so the response to the IML probe stimulus is synchronized to the saccade onset. When the CD signal arrives before the probe stimulus, the IML activity can excite the adjacent cell from the very first spike because the corollary signal has already enabled the lateral connection, so the IML response is time locked to the probe appearance. (2) The response to a probe at the IML is greater than the response to a probe at the FRF, and the response to a probe at the CRF is greater than both. The model predicts that the intensity of response would vary with the distance between the CRF and the probe stimulus. (3) The latency of the response to a probe in the IML is less than the latency of the response to a probe in the FRF. In order to generalize from a unidirectional, one-dimensional model to a bidirectional, one-dimensional model that can remap every saccade, we had to assume that the CD signals were segregated, so that in the set of cells sharing a CRF only one subset was connected to a CD of a particular direction. The cells sharing a CRF excite each other by bidirectional lateral connections, so that although only one subset of cells actually calculated the remapping via a moving wave, all cells sharing the CRF will exhibit remapping for both saccade directions. Because the saccadic signals arise in the contralateral superior colliculus (Wurtz and Goldberg, 1972Wurtz R.H. Goldberg M.E. Activity of superior colliculus in behaving monkey. 3. Cells discharging before eye movements.J. Neurophysiol. 1972; 35: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and FEF (Bruce and Goldberg, 1985Bruce C.J. Goldberg M.E.

https://openalex.org/W2341554161,"Metastasis is a critical factor contributing to poor prognosis in cancer, but the underlying mechanisms of metastasis are still poorly understood. We established a highly metastatic cell subline (HOC313-LM) derived from an oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line (HOC313) for uncovering the mechanisms of metastasis, and identified deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) as a metastasis-associated gene within the specific amplification at 19p13.2–p13.13 in HOC313-LM. DHPS-mediated hypusine-modification of eukaryotic translation factor 5A facilitated the translation of RhoA, resulting in the activation of the RhoA signaling pathway and leading to not only increased cell motility, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells in vitro, but also increased tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, the use of N1-Guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane, a DHPS inhibitor, resulted in a significant decrease in tumor formation in vivo. In patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), overexpression of DHPS in ESCC tumors was significantly associated with worse recurrence-free survival, and correlated with distant metastasis. The elucidation of these molecular mechanisms within the hypusine cascade suggests opportunities for novel therapeutic targets in SCC."

Baill. have been reported to possess various biological activities, and have potential in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. This study was designed to investigate the effects of total lignans of Schisandra chinensis (TLS) on cognitive function and neurodegeneration in the model of AD induced by Aβ1–42 in vivo and in vitro. It was found that intragastric infusion with TLS (50 and 200 mg/kg) to Aβ1–42-induced mice significantly increased the number of avoidances in the shuttle-box test and swimming time in the target quadrant in the Morris water maze test. TLS at dose of 200 mg/kg significantly restored the activities of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), as well as the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) both in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex in mice. Results of histopathological examination indicated that TLS noticeably ameliorated the neurodegeneration in the hippocampus in mice. On the other hand, TLS (100 μM) could protect the Aβ1–42-induced primary mouse neuronal cells by blocking the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), change the expressions of Bcl-2 (important regulator in the mitochondria apoptosis pathway). Moreover, TLS also decreased the activity of β-secretase 1 (BACE1), crucial protease contributes to the hydrolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and inhibited the expression of JKN/p38, which involved in the MAPKs signaling pathways in both mice and primary mouse neuronal cells. In summary, TLS might protect against cognitive deficits and neurodegeneration by releasing the damage of oxidative stress, inhibiting the expression of BACE1 and the MAPKs inflammatory signaling pathways."

We have reported that peroxiredoxin 4 (PRDX4), a unique secretory member of the PRDX antioxidant family, protects against NAFLD progression. However, the detailed mechanism and potential effects on the intestinal function still remain unclear.Two weeks after feeding mice a MCD+HF diet, the livers of human PRDX4 transgenic (Tg) mice exhibited significant suppression in the development of NAFLD compared with wild-type (WT) mice. The serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels were significantly lower in Tg mice. In contrast, the Tg small intestine with PRDX4 overexpression showed more suppressed shortening of total length and villi height, and more accumulation of lipid in the jejunum, along with lower levels of dihydroethidium binding. The enterocytes exhibited fewer apoptotic but more proliferating cells, and inflammation was reduced in the mucosa. Furthermore, the small intestine of Tg mice had significantly higher expression of cholesterol absorption-regulatory factors, including liver X receptor-α, but lower expression of microsomal triglyceride-transfer protein.Our present data provide the first evidence of the beneficial effects of PRDX4 on intestinal function in the reduction of the severity of NAFLD, by ameliorating oxidative stress-induced local and systemic injury. We can suggest that both liver and intestine are spared, to some degree, by the antioxidant properties of PRDX4."
https://openalex.org/W2328468871,"Background Alcohol chemically known as ethanol, causes several health, economic and social consequences across the world. Literatures suggest potential harm of alcohol drinking by pregnant women especially to the fetus and the mother. Despite anumber of significant public health problems related to alcohol consumption, this area has been ignored in Nepal and information at the national level is limited. Thus this study aimed at finding the prevalence of alcohol consumption among married women of reproductive age. Methods A nationally representative household survey was carried out from April to August 2013 by taking 16 districts across all 15 eco administrative regions. From the selected districts, 86 village development committees and 14 municipalities were selected as primary sampling units using probability proportionate to size, followed by random selection of 3 wards from each primary sampling unit. Finally, 30 households within each ward were selected using systematic random sampling, and one married women of reproductive age from each household. A total of 9000 married women of reproductive age were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire, on alcohol consumption practices including environmental factors and socio demographic characteristics and were included in the analysis. Results National prevalence of alcohol consumption ever among married women of reproductive age was 24.7% (95% CI:21.7–28.0), last 12 months 17.9% (95% CI:15.3–20.7) and last 30 days (current drinking) 11.8% (95% CI:9.8–14.1). There was substantial variation among the districts ranging from 2% to 60%. Multivariable analysis suggests women with no education or within formal education, dalit and janajatis ethnicity, whose husbands drink alcohol, who brew alcohol at home and women from mountains were significantly at higher risk of consuming alcohol. Among the women who drank alcohol in last 12 months, a substantial proportion of them drank home brewed alcoholic beverages (95.9%, 95% CI:94.3–97.4). Conclusion Alcohol consumption was common practice among married women of reproductive age in Nepal with variation among the subgroups of population. Thus, further investigation and behavior change communication interventions to reduce alcohol consumption especially among the women with higher risk of drinking is essential."
https://openalex.org/W2316191615,"The entry of viruses into host cells is one of the key processes of infection. The mechanisms of cellular entry for enveloped virus have been well studied. The fusion proteins as well as the facilitating cellular lipid factors involved in the viral fusion entry process have been well characterized. The process of non-enveloped virus cell entry, in comparison, remains poorly defined, particularly for large complex capsid viruses of the family Reoviridae, which comprises a range of mammalian pathogens. These viruses enter cells without the aid of a limiting membrane and thus cannot fuse with host cell membranes to enter cells. Instead, these viruses are believed to penetrate membranes of the host cell during endocytosis. However, the molecular mechanism of this process is largely undefined. Here we show, utilizing an in vitro liposome penetration assay and cell biology, that bluetongue virus (BTV), an archetypal member of the Reoviridae, utilizes the late endosome-specific lipid lysobisphosphatidic acid for productive membrane penetration and viral entry. Further, we provide preliminary evidence that lipid lysobisphosphatidic acid facilitates pore expansion during membrane penetration, suggesting a mechanism for lipid factor requirement of BTV. This finding indicates that despite the lack of a membrane envelope, the entry process of BTV is similar in specific lipid requirements to enveloped viruses that enter cells through the late endosome. These results are the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that a large non-enveloped virus of the Reoviridae has specific lipid requirements for membrane penetration and host cell entry."
https://openalex.org/W2336684916,"High-risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) are the causative agents of cervical and anogenital cancers and are associated with 5% of all human cancers. Although prophylactic vaccines targeting a subset of HPV types are available, they are ineffective in HPV-infected individuals. Elucidation of the mechanisms controlling HPV replication may allow development of novel anti-HPV therapeutics. Infectious HPV virions are produced during terminal differentiation of host cells. The process of viral maturation requires synergistic interactions between viral and cellular proteins that leads to amplification of the viral genome and expression of late viral genes. Here we show that the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 13 (KLF13) has a critical role in the HPV life cycle. KLF13 is overexpressed in HPV-positive keratinocytes and cervical cancer cell lines. Expression of KLF13 in normal cervical epithelium is low but increases significantly in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive squamous cervical cancer. After HPV infection, the E7 protein suppresses ubiquitin ligase FBW7 expression leading to an increase in KLF13 expression. Reduction of KLF13 with short hairpin RNA in differentiating HPV-positive cells resulted in diminished levels of viral gene expression and genome amplification. Knockdown of KLF13 also reduced the level of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, which led to the downregulation of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated DNA damage pathway and the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). In addition, neutralization of IL-8 diminished viral genome amplification in differentiating HPV-positive cells. Thus, KLF13 is critical for the activation of the HPV productive life cycle and is likely involved in initiation and progression of cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2336107107,"The endocytic adaptor protein Numb has a major role in development as an intrinsic regulator of cell fate determination and inhibitor of the Notch signaling pathway. In vertebrates, four protein isoforms of Numb are produced through alternative splicing (AS) of two cassette exons (exons 3 and 9). AS of coding exon 9 (E9) produces E9-included (p72/p71) and -excluded (p66/p65) protein products. Expression of Numb isoforms is developmentally regulated and E9-included products are expressed in progenitors, whereas E9-excluded isoforms are dominantly expressed in differentiated cells. Analyses of AS events in multiple cancers previously identified a switch in Numb transcript and protein expression from the E9-excluded to the E9-included isoform, suggesting that misregulation of the mechanisms that control E9 inclusion may have a role in tumorigenesis. Here we identify splicing factors ASF/SF2 and PTBP1 as regulators of E9 splicing and show that activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway promotes E9 inclusion in cancer cells. Our evidence supports a mechanism by which Numb AS is regulated in response to oncogenic signaling pathways, and contributes to activation of downstream pathways to promote tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2338481647,"Metastasis is responsible for >90% of cancer-related deaths. Complex signaling in cancer cells orchestrates the progression from a primary to a metastatic cancer. However, the mechanisms of these cellular changes remain elusive. We previously demonstrated that p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) promotes tumor metastasis. Here we investigated the role of RSK2 in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and its potential implication in cancer cell invasion and tumor metastasis. Stable knockdown of RSK2 disrupted microtubule stability and decreased phosphorylation of stathmin, a microtubule-destabilizing protein, at serine 16 in metastatic human cancer cells. We found that RSK2 directly binds and phosphorylates stathmin at the leading edge of cancer cells. Phosphorylation of stathmin by RSK2 reduced stathmin-mediated microtubule depolymerization. Moreover, overexpression of phospho-mimetic mutant stathmin S16D significantly rescued the decreased invasive and metastatic potential mediated by RSK2 knockdown in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, stathmin phosphorylation positively correlated with RSK2 expression and metastatic cancer progression in primary patient tumor samples. Our finding demonstrates that RSK2 directly phosphorylates stathmin and regulates microtubule polymerization to provide a pro-invasive and pro-metastatic advantage to cancer cells. Therefore, the RSK2–stathmin pathway represents a promising therapeutic target and a prognostic marker for metastatic human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2329000469,"A major cause of preterm labor in pregnant women is intra-amniotic infection, which is mediated by an inflammatory process. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous transmitter, has been implicated to be involved in inflammatory responses. We sought to investigate whether H2S affects infectious preterm birth using the mouse model of lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced preterm birth. Administration of LPS at 0.4 mg/kg with two injections intraperitoneally (i.p.) on gestational day 14.5 induced preterm labor. LPS significantly increased leukocyte infiltration in uterus, stimulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), CCL2 and CXCL15 in myometrium. Administration of NaHS (i.p.) delayed the onset of labor induced by LPS in a dose-dependent manner. NaHS prevented leukocyte infiltration into intrauterine tissues and inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in myometrium and decreased the levels of these cytokines in maternal circulation. H2S also decreased LPS-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2/ nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathways in myometrium. This study provides new in vivo evidence for the roles of H2S in attenuating inflammation, and a potential novel therapeutic strategy for infection-related preterm labor."
https://openalex.org/W2337177550,"Little is known about the biological role of the phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R1) transmembrane protein. In recent years, PLA2R1 has been shown to have an important role in regulating tumor-suppressive responses via JAK2 activation, but the underlying mechanisms are largely undeciphered. In this study, we observed that PLA2R1 increases the mitochondrial content, judged by increased levels of numerous mitochondrial proteins, of the mitochondrial structural component cardiolipin, of the mitochondrial DNA content, and of the mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription factor TFAM. This effect of PLA2R1 relies on a transcriptional program controlled by the estrogen-related receptor alpha1 (ERRα) mitochondrial master regulator. Expression of ERRα and of its nucleus-encoded mitochondrial targets is upregulated upon PLA2R1 ectopic expression, and this effect is mediated by JAK2. Conversely, downregulation of PLA2R1 decreases the level of ERRα and of its nucleus-encoded mitochondrial targets. Finally, blocking the ERRα-controlled mitochondrial program largely inhibits the PLA2R1-induced tumor-suppressive response. Together, our data document ERRα and its mitochondrial program as downstream effectors of the PLA2R1-JAK2 pathway leading to oncosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W2335744179,"People divide their time unequally among their social contacts due to time constraints and varying strength of relationships. It was found that high diversity of social communication, dividing time more evenly among social contacts, is correlated with economic well-being both at macro and micro levels. Besides economic well-being, it is not clear how the diversity of social communication is also associated with the two components of individuals’ subjective well-being, positive and negative affect. Specifically, positive affect and negative affect are two independent dimensions representing the experience (feeling) of emotions. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the daily diversity of social communication and dynamic affect states that people experience in their daily lives. We collected two high-resolution datasets that capture affect scores via daily experience sampling surveys and social interaction through wearable sensing technologies: sociometric badges for face-to-face interaction and smart phones for mobile phone calls. We found that communication diversity correlates with desirable affect states–e.g. an increase in the positive affect state or a decrease in the negative affect state–for some personality types, but correlates with undesirable affect states for others. For example, diversity in phone calls is experienced as good by introverts, but bad by extroverts; diversity in face-to-face interaction is experienced as good by people who tend to be positive by nature (trait) but bad for people who tend to be not positive by nature. More broadly, the moderating effect of personality type on the relationship between diversity and affect was detected without any knowledge of the type of social tie or the content of communication. This provides further support for the power of unobtrusive sensing in understanding social dynamics, and in measuring the effect of potential interventions designed to improve well-being."
https://openalex.org/W2341246595,"Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) is a rare, highly aggressive pediatric malignancy that primarily develops during infancy and early childhood. Despite the existing standard of intensive multimodal therapy, the prognosis of patients with MRT is dismal; therefore, a greater understanding of the biology of this disease is required to establish novel therapies. In this study, we identified a highly tumorigenic sub-population in MRT, based on the expression of CD146 (also known as melanoma cell adhesion molecule), a cell adhesion molecule expressed by neural crest cells and various derivatives. CD146+ cells isolated from four MRT cell lines by cell sorting exhibited enhanced self-renewal and invasive potential in vitro. In a xenograft model using immunodeficient NOD/Shi-scid IL-2Rγ-null mice, purified CD146+ cells obtained from MRT cell lines or a primary tumor exhibited the exclusive ability to form tumors in vivo. Blocking of CD146-related mechanisms, either by short hairpin RNA knockdown or treatment with a polyclonal antibody against CD146, effectively suppressed tumor growth of MRT cells both in vitro and in vivo via induction of apoptosis by inactivating Akt. Furthermore, CD146 positivity in immunohistological analysis of 11 MRT patient samples was associated with poor patient outcomes. These results suggest that CD146 defines a distinct sub-population in MRT with high tumorigenic capacity and that this marker represents a promising therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2337140503,"Chromosomal focal amplifications often cause an increase in gene copy number, contributing to the pathogenesis of cancer. PRR14 overexpression is associated with recurrent locus amplification in lung cancer, and it correlates with a poor prognosis. We show that increased PRR14 expression promoted and reduced PRR14 expression impeded lung cancer cell proliferation. Interestingly, PRR14 cells were markedly enlarged in size and exhibited an elevated activity of the PI3-kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway, which was associated with a heightened sensitivity to the inhibitors of PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Biochemical analysis revealed that PRR14, as a proline-rich protein, binds to the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of GRB2 resulting in PI3K activation. Significantly, two cancer patient-derived PRR14 mutants displayed considerably augmented GRB2-binding and an enhanced ability of promoting cell proliferation. Together with the in vivo data demonstrating a strong tumor-promoting activity of PRR14 and the mutants, our work uncovered this proline-rich protein as a novel activator of the PI3K pathway that promoted tumorigenesis in lung cancer."

We found that Yju3p, the functional orthologue of mammalian monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL), contributes >90% of cellular FAEE hydrolase activity, and its loss leads to the accumulation of FAEE. Heterologous expression of mammalian MGL in yju3Δ mutants restored cellular FAEE hydrolase activity and FAEE catabolism. Moreover, overexpression or pharmacological inhibition of MGL in mouse AML-12 hepatocytes decreased or increased FAEE levels, respectively. FAEEs were transiently incorporated into lipid droplets (LDs) and both Yju3p and MGL co-localized with these organelles. We conclude that the storage of FAEE in inert LDs and their mobilization by LD-resident FAEE hydrolases facilitate a controlled metabolism of these potentially toxic lipid metabolites.

This study was conducted among parents whose children participated in past clinical trials in northern Ghana to assess their knowledge and perceptions of clinical trials and the use of biomedical samples.This was a qualitative study based on eighty in-depth interviews with parents. The participants were randomly selected from among parents whose children were enrolled in a clinical trial conducted in the Kassena-Nankana districts between 2000 and 2003. The interviews were transcribed and coded into emergent themes using Nvivo 9 software. The thematic analysis framework was used to analyze the data.Study participants reported that clinical trials were carried out to determine the efficacy of drugs and to make sure that these drugs were suitable for human beings to use. The conduct of clinical trials was perceived to have helped to reduce the occurrence of diseases such as malaria, cerebrospinal meningitis and diarrhea. Quality of care was reported to be better in clinical trials than in the routine care. Parents indicated that participation in clinical trials positively influenced their health-seeking behavior. Apprehensions about blood draw and the use to which samples were put were expressed, with suspicion by a few participants that researchers sold blood samples. The issue of blood draw was most contentious.Parents perception about the conduct of clinical trials in the study districts is generally positive. However, misconceptions made about the use of blood samples in this study must be taken seriously and strategies found to improve transparency and greater community acceptability."

Mice were immunized with DENV-2 PIV with and without recombinant NS3 protease or NS3 helicase proteins, and NS3 proteins alone on days 0, 14 and 28. The NS3 helicase but not the NS3 protease was effective in inducing T-cell responses quantified by IFN-γ ELISPOT. In addition, markedly increased total IgG antibody titer against virus antigen was seen in mice immunized with the PIV/NS3 helicase combination in the ELISA, as well as increased neutralizing antibody titer measured by the plaque reduction neutralization test. These results indicate the potential immunogenic properties of the NS3 helicase protein and its use in a dengue vaccine formulation."

The pharmacological activities of andrographolide have been widely demonstrated, including anti-inflammation, anti-cancer and hepatoprotection. However, the pharmacological mechanism of andrographolide remains unclear. Therefore, further characterization on the kinetics and molecular targets of andrographolide is essential. In this study, we described the synthesis and characterization of a novel fluorescent andrographolide derivative (ANDRO-NBD). ANDRO-NBD exhibited a comparable anti-cancer spectrum to andrographolide: ANDRO-NBD was cytotoxic to various types of cancer cells and suppressed the migration activity of melanoma cells; ANDRO-NBD treatment induced the cleavage of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and the downregulation of its client oncoproteins, v-Src and Bcr-abl. Notably, ANDRO-NBD showed superior inhibitory effects to andrographolide in all anticancer assays we have performed. In addition, ANDRO-NBD was further used as a fluorescent probe to investigate the uptake kinetics, cellular distribution and molecular targets of andrographolide. Our data revealed that ANDRO-NBD entered cells rapidly and its fluorescent signal could be detected in nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria, and lysosome. Moreover, we demonstrated that ANDRO-NBD was covalently bound to several putative target proteins of andrographolide, including NF-κB and hnRNPK.

https://openalex.org/W2337504232,"Regulation of actin assembly and depolymerization is important for the organization of epithelia. Recent studies have shown that the actin-capping proteins are required to prevent cell extrusion and inappropriate activation of Yorkie (Yki) activity in Drosophila, implicating the importance of actin regulation for epithelial integrity and Yki-dependent tissue growth. However, the role of Twinstar (Tsr), the Drosophila homolog for cofilin/actin depolymerization factor (ADF), in epithelial integrity and Hippo signaling is unknown. Here we demonstrate that reduction of Tsr by RNA interference (RNAi) or mutant clones in wing imaginal disc induces not only F-actin accumulation but also ectopic expression of Wingless (Wg) and Yki target gene expanded (ex). Knockdown of Yki in Tsr-depleted cells reduced the level of ectopic Wg expression. Reduced Tsr also led to downregulation of cell junction proteins and extrusion of affected cells from the basal part of the epithelium. Rho GTPase 1 was upregulated in Tsr-depleted tissue, supporting the Tsr function in the inhibition of cell extrusion from the epithelium. Tsr is also required for blocking cell death and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. Ectopic JNK activation induced caspase activation but did not cause cell extrusion. Further, the invasiveness of Tsr-depleted cells was not suppressed by inhibition of cell death or JNK signaling. In contrast, Yki upregulation was significantly suppressed by cell death inhibition. Taken together, our data suggest that Tsr is required for cell survival and tissue growth by regulating JNK and Yki signaling while maintaining the epithelial integrity by controlling cell junctions.

Current front-line regimes include agents such as fludarabine, which act primarily via the DNA damage response pathway. Key to this is the transcription factor p53. Mutations in the TP53 gene, altering p53 functionality, are associated with genetic instability, and are present in aggressive CLL. Furthermore, the emergence of clonal TP53 mutations in relapsed CLL, refractory to DNA-damaging therapy, suggests that accurate detection of sub-clonal TP53 mutations prior to and during treatment may be indicative of early relapse. In this study, we describe a novel deep sequencing workflow using multiple polymerases to generate sequencing libraries (MuPol-Seq), facilitating accurate detection of TP53 mutations at a frequency as low as 0.3%, in presentation CLL cases tested. As these mutations were mostly clustered within the regions of TP53 encoding DNA-binding domains, essential for DNA contact and structural architecture, they are likely to be of prognostic relevance in disease progression.

Here we show that T. brucei treated with 1 mm deoxyadenosine accumulates higher dATP levels than mammalian cells but that this effect diminishes quickly as the concentration of the deoxynucleoside decreases. Radioactive tracer studies showed that the parasites are partially protected against lower concentrations of deoxyadenosine by the ability to cleave it and use the adenine for ATP synthesis. T. brucei methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (TbMTAP) was found to be responsible for the cleavage as indicated by the phosphate dependence of deoxyadenosine cleavage in T. brucei cell extracts and increased deoxyadenosine sensitivity in TbMTAP knockdown cells. Recombinant TbMTAP exhibited higher turnover number (kcat) and Km values for deoxyadenosine than for the regular substrate, methylthioadenosine.

Consequently, T. brucei grown in the presence of adenine demonstrated increased sensitivity to deoxyadenosine. For deoxyadenosine/adenosine analogues to remain intact and be active against the parasite, they need to either be resistant to TbMTAP-mediated cleavage, which is the case with the three known antitrypanosomal agents adenine arabinoside, tubercidin, and cordycepin, or they need to be combined with TbMTAP inhibitors.

For deoxyadenosine/adenosine analogues to remain intact and be active against the parasite, they need to either be resistant to TbMTAP-mediated cleavage, which is the case with the three known antitrypanosomal agents adenine arabinoside, tubercidin, and cordycepin, or they need to be combined with TbMTAP inhibitors. African sleeping sickness (1Malvy D. Chappuis F. Sleeping sickness.Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 2011; 17: 986-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) is a fatal disease that progresses through two stages and is caused by two subspecies of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, T. brucei gambiense in Western and Central Africa and T. brucei rhodesiense in Eastern and parts of Southern Africa. Treatment of the disease is particularly difficult in the second stage in which the parasites leave the blood and lymph, enter the central nervous system, and eventually cause the patient to fall into a comatose state. T. brucei and related species also cause nagana, a disease in cattle that has a significant impact on socioeconomic development in many parts of rural Africa (2Holmes P. Tsetse-transmitted trypanosomes—their biology, disease impact and control.J. Invertebr. Pathol. 2013; 112: S11-S14Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Many nucleoside analogues have been successfully used as drugs in the fields of cancer, virology, and to some extent parasitology. One advantage of using nucleoside analogues against second stage sleeping sickness is that a large proportion of them can cross the blood-brain barrier via transporters used for the uptake of nucleosides needed by the brain (3Parkinson F.E. Damaraju V.L. Graham K. Yao S.Y. Baldwin S.A. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Molecular biology of nucleoside transporters and their distributions and functions in the brain.Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2011; 11: 948-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Nucleoside analogues need to be phosphorylated inside the cells into their nucleotide forms to inhibit transcription, replication, or other nucleotide-dependent processes. In contrast to mammalian cells, which have several kinases to phosphorylate nucleosides and deoxynucleosides, T. brucei has only two: thymidine kinase primarily phosphorylates thymidine and deoxyuridine (4Ranjbarian F. Vodnala M. Vodnala S.M. Rofougaran R. Thelander L. Hofer A.

Rofougaran R. Mosimann M. Mäser P. Hofer A. Adenosine kinase mediates high affinity adenosine salvage in Trypanosoma brucei.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5380-5388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). T. brucei lacks de novo purine biosynthesis, and adenosine kinase is part of the efficient salvage pathways that enable the parasite to utilize nucleosides and bases from the host (6Vodnala M. Fijolek A. Rofougaran R. Mosimann M. Mäser P. Hofer A. Adenosine kinase mediates high affinity adenosine salvage in Trypanosoma brucei.J. Biol.

It is taken up by T. brucei via efficient transporters (9de Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M.

Potential chemotherapeutic targets in the purine metabolism of parasites.Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 99: 283-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). An alternative pathway that adenosine shares with other purine nucleosides is that the ribose moiety can be first cleaved off and the base salvaged instead. The adenosine cleavage reaction is catalyzed by inosine-adenosine-guanosine-nucleoside hydrolase (IAG-NH) 3The abbreviations used are: IAG-NHinosine-adenosine-guanosine-nucleoside hydrolaseAra-Aadenine arabinosideMTAPmethylthioadenosine phosphorylaseTbT. bruceiBSFbloodstream formBiPbinding proteinNTAnitrilotriacetic acidMTAmethylthioadenosineAPRTadenine phosphoribosyltransferaseNYSMNew York single marker T7NAP/TetRTrxAthioredoxin A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2118-2126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the relative contribution of each pathway for adenosine salvage is not known, the much higher affinity of adenosine kinase than IAG-NH for this substrate suggests that it represents the major route (6Vodnala M. Fijolek A. Rofougaran R. Mosimann M. Mäser P. Hofer A. Adenosine kinase mediates high affinity adenosine salvage in Trypanosoma brucei.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5380-5388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As a side activity, T. brucei adenosine kinase is also able to phosphorylate deoxyadenosine (6Vodnala M. Fijolek A. Rofougaran R. Mosimann M. Mäser P. Hofer A. Adenosine kinase mediates high affinity adenosine salvage in Trypanosoma brucei.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5380-5388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This reaction is detrimental to the parasites because addition of 0.5 mm deoxyadenosine to the culture medium causes the parasites to die within 15 h with grossly elevated dATP levels and a concomitant decrease in ATP, which is consumed in the phosphorylation of the deoxynucleoside (12Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. Allosteric regulation of Trypanosoma brucei ribonucleotide reductase studied in vitro and in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). inosine-adenosine-guanosine-nucleoside hydrolase adenine arabinoside methylthioadenosine phosphorylase T. brucei bloodstream form binding protein nitrilotriacetic acid methylthioadenosine adenine phosphoribosyltransferase New York single marker T7NAP/TetR thioredoxin A. Many adenosine analogues are metabolized in a similar manner as adenosine into their nucleotide forms and affect transcription and other ATP-dependent processes. Cordycepin (3′-deoxyadenosine) and tubercidin (7-deazaadenosine) are two such analogues that inhibit T. brucei growth with IC50 values in the nanomolar range (13Geiser F. Lüscher A. de Koning H.P. Seebeck T. Mäser P. Molecular pharmacology of adenosine transport in Trypanosoma brucei: P1/P2 revisited.Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cordycepin has been shown to cure both stages of the disease in T. brucei-infected mice when given together with deoxycoformycin, which protects the drug from deamination by serum adenosine deaminase (14Rottenberg M.E. Masocha W. Ferella M. Petitto-Assis F. Goto H. Kristensson K. McCaffrey R. Wigzell H. Treatment of African trypanosomiasis with cordycepin and adenosine deaminase inhibitors in a mouse model.J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 192: 1658-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Promising results have also been obtained with 2-fluorocordycepin, which is resistant to adenosine deaminase and can be used as a single agent (15Vodnala S.K. Lundbäck T. Yeheskieli E. Sjöberg B. Gustavsson A.L. Svensson R. Olivera G.C. Eze A.A. de Koning H.P. Hammarström L.G. Rottenberg M.E. Structure-activity relationships of synthetic cordycepin analogues as experimental therapeutics for African trypanosomiasis.J. Med. Chem. 2013; 56: 9861-9873Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). So far, the development of antiparasitic nucleoside derivatives has focused mainly on ribonucleoside analogues such as cordycepin and tubercidin, whereas 2′-deoxynucleoside- and arabinoside-containing analogues are the ones most frequently used in anticancer and antiviral therapies. Arabinoside analogues can be considered equivalent to deoxynucleoside analogues because they are generally phosphorylated by the same kinases as deoxynucleosides and primarily inhibit DNA synthesis and other deoxynucleotide-dependent reactions. Adenine arabinoside (Ara-A) is an example of one such analogue that in combination with deoxycoformycin inhibits T. brucei DNA synthesis and cures T. brucei-infected mice (6Vodnala M. Fijolek A. Rofougaran R. Mosimann M. Mäser P. Hofer A. Adenosine kinase mediates high affinity adenosine salvage in Trypanosoma brucei.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5380-5388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of T. brucei to deoxyadenosine seems surprising in light of the fact that this is a naturally occurring nucleoside. In the current work, we show that T. brucei methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (TbMTAP) normally protects T. brucei cells against deoxyadenosine, but product inhibition by adenine sets an upper level on the capacity of the enzyme. Knowledge of the TbMTAP-mediated protection system is relevant for drug discovery because adenosine kinase substrate analogues need to be resistant to cleavage by TbMTAP (and TbIAG-NH) or be combined with cleavage enzyme inhibitors to be active against the parasite. Consequently, we found that cordycepin, tubercidin, and Ara-A were all resistant to TbMTAP activity and that the presence of the TbMTAP inhibitor adenine in the culture medium could increase deoxyadenosine-induced growth inhibition of T. brucei bloodstream forms (BSFs). T. brucei BSFs were cultivated at 37 °C in HMI-9 medium (16Hirumi H. Hirumi K. Continuous cultivation of Trypanosoma brucei blood stream forms in a medium containing a low concentration of serum protein without feeder cell layers.J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and grown in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. T. brucei procyclic forms were cultivated with similar atmospheric conditions at 27 °C in SDM-79 medium (Gibco) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml hemin (Sigma-Aldrich) (17Brun R. Schönenberger M. Cultivation and in vitro cloning or procyclic culture forms of Trypanosoma brucei in a semi-defined medium. Short communication.Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells (ATCC number CCL-22) and mouse Balb/3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC number CCL-163) were cultivated as monolayers in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with l-glutamine (0.584 g/liter), 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 10 ml/liter 100× penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 7% CO2. Suspensions of human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60 cells, ATCC number CCL-240) were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Growth conditions and additional supplements (glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin) were the same as for the Balb/3T3 and Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells. NTP and dNTP pools from T. brucei and mammalian cells were extracted as described previously (12Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. Allosteric regulation of Trypanosoma brucei ribonucleotide reductase studied in vitro and in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and quantified by PolyWAX A (PolyLC, Columbia, MD) chromatography (18Håkansson P. Hofer A. Thelander L. Regulation of mammalian ribonucleotide reduction and dNTP pools after DNA damage and in resting cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7834-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). A change compared with the previous analyses (12Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. Allosteric regulation of Trypanosoma brucei ribonucleotide reductase studied in vitro and in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) is that here we used the regular T. brucei HMI-9 medium and did not exclude thymidine. The connection of the HPLC equipment to a flow scintillation analyzer (Radiomatic 150TR, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) enabled the detection of radiolabeled metabolites in experiments where the cells were treated with [2,8-3H] deoxyadenosine (Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA). T. brucei TC221 cells were grown to a cell density of 2 × 106 cells/ml (50–100 ml) and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), recentrifuged, and resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. The resulting suspension was vortexed with zirconium beads to lyse the cells and recentrifuged. The supernatant was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the reference. Enzyme assays were performed in the same manner as with the recombinant TbMTAP (see below) except that the phosphate concentration was decreased to 5 mm because cleavage of adenosine was inhibited at higher concentrations in the cell extracts (most likely due to inhibition of IAG-NH). T. brucei cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates (5,000 cells/well for BSFs and 20,000 cells/well for procyclics) containing 200 μl of culture medium with various concentrations of deoxyadenosine or nucleoside analogues (in combination with 2 μm deoxycoformycin). After 48 h, the plates were incubated for 24 h with 20 μl of Alamar Blue dye (Invitrogen) and quantified by fluorescence (540-nm excitation and 590-nm emission) using an Infinite M200 microplate reader (Tecan Group, Männedorf, Switzerland). The low number of cells (5,000 cells/well) for testing deoxyadenosine sensitivity of BSFs was an adjustment because adenine (formed from the cleavage of deoxyadenosine) became detectable in the growth medium at significant levels if the number of cells was higher. The IC50 values were determined by fitting the data to a log[inhibitor] versus response curve (variable slope, four parameters) using GraphPad Prism 5.04 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Approximately 400 bp of the TbMTAP gene was amplified from T. brucei TC221 genomic DNA by using the primers 5′-GTC ACC TCG AGT GCC AAC TTC CGG AAG C-3′ (forward primer; the XhoI site is underlined) and 5′-AGC ACA AGC TTC TTT GTA ATG GCC TCT GGT TT-3′ (reverse primer; the HindIII site is underlined). The PCR product was digested with XhoI and HindIII restriction enzymes and ligated into pZJM (19Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The resulting pZJM-TbMTAP construct was linearized with NotI and transfected into New York single marker T7NAP/TetR (NYSM) T. brucei BSFs (20Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and positive clones were selected in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml phleomycin and 1 μg/ml G418 (20Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. A tightly regulated inducible expression system for conditional gene knock-outs and dominant-negative genetics in Trypanosoma brucei.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Expression of the TbMTAP RNAi construct was induced with 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 7 days. Zirconium bead-homogenized T. brucei cell extracts (see above) were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-TbMTAP immune serum, which was produced by Agrisera AB (Vännäs, Sweden) using recombinantly expressed and purified TbMTAP (see below) as the antigen. Western blotting was carried out using the antibody diluted 10,000-fold in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 containing 2% (w/v) skim milk. After incubation overnight, the membrane was washed and probed with an anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h (GE Healthcare), developed with the ECL system (GE Healthcare), and imaged with the ChemiDocTM Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad). For the determination of the loading control, the membrane was washed and incubated for 2 h with a 10,000-fold dilution of an antibody that recognizes Binding Protein (BiP), a member of the hsp70 heat shock protein family. The membrane was probed with secondary antibody and analyzed by ECL detection as described above. The anti-BiP antibody was a kind gift from J. Bang’s laboratory at the University of Wisconsin Medical School. The TbMTAP gene was amplified from T. brucei TC221 genomic DNA by using the primers 5′-AAC TGC TCA TGA TGT ACA CGA GTC CCC ACG-3′ (TbMTAP forward primer; the BspHI site is underlined) and 5′-ACG GGG TAC CTA TTA CGG AGC GAA TAT GGG ATA TTT-3′ (TbMTAP reverse primer; the Acc65I site is underlined). The PCR product was digested with BspHI and Acc65I and subcloned into a pETM-20 vector (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) that had been digested with NcoI (an isoschizomer of BspHI) and Acc65I. DNA sequencing from both directions confirmed the inserted gene to be correct. The resulting plasmid (pETM-20-TbMTAP) encodes a fusion construct with TbMTAP connected to an N-terminal His-tagged thioredoxin A (TrxA) protein via a linker containing a tobacco etch virus protease recognition site. The vector pETM20-TbMTAP was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells (Merck), grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with 60 μg/ml carbenicillin and 27.2 μg/ml chloramphenicol, induced at an A595 of 0.5 with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and harvested 3 h later. The bacteria were centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (0.3 m NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8). After freezing, thawing, and ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g for 45 min, the supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml nickel-NTA Superflow column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was subsequently washed with 15 ml of 5 mm and then 10 ml of 10 mm imidazole in buffer A. TrxA-tagged TbMTAP protein was finally eluted with 25 ml of 100 mm imidazole in buffer A. The eluted fractions were pooled and concentrated by two different methods. When adenine-free protein was required, the solution was precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 80% saturation at 4 °C (nominally 0.53 g/ml) and centrifuged, and the pellet was dissolved in 600 μl of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 0.1 mm DTT). When yield and stability were of higher importance (general protocol), the protein was concentrated in a 20-ml Vivaspin concentrator with a 30-kDa-molecular mass cutoff (Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany) to a final volume of 600 μl. The concentrated protein (using either of the two concentration methods) was buffer-exchanged into buffer B with a PD-10 Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). TrxA-TbMTAP protein in 7.5 ml of buffer B was mixed with tobacco etch virus protease (2:1 ratio in milligrams) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The digested protein mixture was loaded onto a 1-ml nickel-NTA Superflow column equilibrated with buffer B, and TbMTAP-containing fractions collected in the flow-through were subsequently pooled, concentrated by using a 30-kDa-cutoff 20-ml Vivaspin concentrator, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The Bio-Rad protein assay was used to assess the protein concentration with bovine serum albumin as the reference. The typical yield was 13 mg of TbMTAP from 1 liter of bacterial culture using the general protocol. In enzyme assays using methylthioadenosine (MTA), adenosine, or deoxyadenosine as substrates, the effect of adenine from the TbMTAP stock was negligible because strongly diluted protein solutions were used. With guanosine, inosine, and other low affinity purines and pyrimidines, much more enzyme was needed, and it was then crucial to use protein purified with the extra ammonium sulfate precipitation step. A buffer consisting of 50 mm potassium acetate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 was used to dilute the enzyme to an appropriate concentration (0.05–1000 ng/μl depending on the substrate) prior to use in enzyme assays. The diluted enzyme (generally 2 μl) was mixed with a solution containing the nucleoside substrate in a total volume of 100 μl of 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4 (pH adjusted with KOH). In assays where the reverse reaction was studied (nucleoside synthesis), the phosphate buffer was replaced by 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. The enzyme assay was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by incubation at 100 °C for 2 min in a heating block, and the reaction product was quantified by HPLC using an ACE UltraCore 2.5 Super C18 50 × 2.1-mm column (Advanced Chromatography Technologies, Aberdeen, UK). The column was run isocratically at 0.4 ml/min using a mobile phase consisting of 30 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.8, and 5% (v/v) methanol. This procedure was sufficient to separate adenine (natural or modified) from each nucleoside substrate. Assays with guanine, hypoxanthine, cytosine, uracil, or thymine as reaction products were analyzed at 1 ml/min on an ACE 3 AQ 50 × 4.6-mm column (Advanced Chromatography Technologies) to enable the use of a methanol-free mobile phase (40 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.8). All enzyme assays were performed within the linear range with respect to time and protein concentration. Generally, the levels of dNTPs are much lower than NTPs in T. brucei cells (12Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. Allosteric regulation of Trypanosoma brucei ribonucleotide reductase studied in vitro and in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, when cultivated in the presence of 1 mm deoxyadenosine in the growth medium for 1 h, dATP became the most abundant nucleotide in the cell (Fig. 1A). Similarly to what was observed previously (12Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. Allosteric regulation of Trypanosoma brucei ribonucleotide reductase studied in vitro and in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the level of ATP, which is needed for the phosphorylation of deoxyadenosine, decreased significantly under these conditions (p < 0.001, unpaired t test). The level of dCTP increased, and dGTP decreased (Fig. 1A, inset) as a result of the effect of dATP as a specificity regulator of ribonucleotide reductase (12Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L.

DNA building blocks: keeping control of manufacture.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

The dTTP levels were much higher here than reported previously (12Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L.

Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The effect of deoxyadenosine on dNTP pools is likely to cause inhibition of DNA synthesis and an increased number of replication errors (23Kumar D. Abdulovic A.L. Viberg J. Nilsson A.K. Kunkel T.A.

In Fig. 1B, the dATP accumulation in T. brucei is shown as a function of the deoxyadenosine concentration in the growth medium. The data are plotted in two different ways. Presenting the data as a percentage of the total nucleotide pool (NTPs + dNTPs) has many advantages, including smaller standard errors, less variation depending on who is performing the experiment, and the possibility of comparing cell types with different volumes and thereby different total nucleotide levels. Because the increased dATP pool is to a large extent compens"
https://openalex.org/W2328998528,"Long-term functional stability of isolated membrane proteins is crucial for many in vitro applications used to elucidate molecular mechanisms, and used for drug screening platforms in modern pharmaceutical industry. Compared to soluble proteins, the understanding at the molecular level of membrane proteins remains a challenge. This is partly due to the difficulty to isolate and simultaneously maintain their structural and functional stability, because of their hydrophobic nature. Here we show, how scintillation proximity assay can be used to analyze time-resolved high-affinity ligand binding to membrane proteins solubilized in various environments. The assay was used to establish conditions that preserved the biological function of isolated human kappa opioid receptor. In detergent solution the receptor lost high-affinity ligand binding to a radiolabelled ligand within minutes at room temperature. After reconstitution in Nanodiscs made of phospholipid bilayer the half-life of high-affinity ligand binding to the majority of receptors increased 70-fold compared to detergent solubilized receptors--a level of stability that is appropriate for further downstream applications. Time-resolved scintillation proximity assay has the potential to screen numerous conditions in parallel to obtain high levels of stable and active membrane proteins, which are intrinsically unstable in detergent solution, and with minimum material consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2326519078,"The use of RT-qPCR provides a powerful tool for gene expression studies; however, the proper interpretation of the obtained data is crucially dependent on accurate normalization based on stable reference genes. Recently, strong evidence has been shown indicating that the expression of many commonly used reference genes may vary significantly due to diverse experimental conditions. The isolation of pancreatic islets is a complicated procedure which creates severe mechanical and metabolic stress leading possibly to cellular damage and alteration of gene expression. Despite of this, freshly isolated islets frequently serve as a control in various gene expression and intervention studies. The aim of our study was to determine expression of 16 candidate reference genes and one gene of interest (F3) in isolated rat pancreatic islets during short-term cultivation in order to find a suitable endogenous control for gene expression studies. We compared the expression stability of the most commonly used reference genes and evaluated the reliability of relative and absolute quantification using RT-qPCR during 0-120 hrs after isolation. In freshly isolated islets, the expression of all tested genes was markedly depressed and it increased several times throughout the first 48 hrs of cultivation. We observed significant variability among samples at 0 and 24 hrs but substantial stabilization from 48 hrs onwards. During the first 48 hrs, relative quantification failed to reflect the real changes in respective mRNA concentrations while in the interval 48-120 hrs, the relative expression generally paralleled the results determined by absolute quantification. Thus, our data call into question the suitability of relative quantification for gene expression analysis in pancreatic islets during the first 48 hrs of cultivation, as the results may be significantly affected by unstable expression of reference genes. However, this method could provide reliable information from 48 hrs onwards."

Methods Sixty-two parents completed questionnaires measuring PTSS, depression, and anxiety and the emotional Stroop task via the Internet. The emotional Stroop task included cancer-related words, cardiovascular disease-related words, and neutral words. Results Participants were split in two groups based on the median of PTSS: High-PTSS and Low-PTSS. There was a significant interaction between word-type and group and a planned contrast test of this interaction indicated that the High-PTSS group had longer response latencies on cancer-related words compared to the other word-type and group combinations. Conclusions Findings suggest that PTSS are related to attentional bias towards cancer-related stimuli among parents of children recently diagnosed with cancer. Implications of this finding for the understanding of PTSS in this population, future research, and clinical practice are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2335475622,"The mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases (mtTyrRSs) of Pezizomycotina fungi, a subphylum that includes many pathogenic species, are bifunctional proteins that both charge mitochondrial tRNATyr and act as splicing cofactors for autocatalytic group I introns. Previous studies showed that one of these proteins, Neurospora crassa CYT-18, binds group I introns by using both its N-terminal catalytic and C-terminal anticodon binding domains and that the catalytic domain uses a newly evolved group I intron binding surface that includes an N-terminal extension and two small insertions (insertions 1 and 2) with distinctive features not found in non-splicing mtTyrRSs. To explore how this RNA binding surface diverged to accommodate different group I introns in other Pezizomycotina fungi, we determined x-ray crystal structures of C-terminally truncated Aspergillus nidulans and Coccidioides posadasii mtTyrRSs. Comparisons with previous N. crassa CYT-18 structures and a structural model of the Aspergillus fumigatus mtTyrRS showed that the overall topology of the group I intron binding surface is conserved but with variations in key intron binding regions, particularly the Pezizomycotina-specific insertions. These insertions, which arose by expansion of flexible termini or internal loops, show greater variation in structure and amino acids potentially involved in group I intron binding than do neighboring protein core regions, which also function in intron binding but may be more constrained to preserve mtTyrRS activity. Our results suggest a structural basis for the intron specificity of different Pezizomycotina mtTyrRSs, highlight flexible terminal and loop regions as major sites for enzyme diversification, and identify targets for therapeutic intervention by disrupting an essential RNA-protein interaction in pathogenic fungi.
