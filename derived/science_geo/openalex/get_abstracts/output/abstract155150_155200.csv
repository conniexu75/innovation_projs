https://openalex.org/W2086458197,"Cyclooxygenases (COX) play an important role in lipid signaling by oxygenating arachidonic acid to endoperoxide precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxane. Two cyclooxygenases exist which differ in tissue distribution and regulation but otherwise carry out identical chemical functions. The neutral arachidonate derivative, 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), is one of two described endocannabinoids and appears to be a ligand for both the central (CB1) and peripheral (CB2) cannabinoid receptors. Here we report that 2-AG is a substrate for COX-2 and that it is metabolized as effectively as arachidonic acid. COX-2-mediated 2-AG oxygenation provides the novel lipid, prostaglandin H2 glycerol ester (PGH2-G), in vitro and in cultured macrophages. PGH2-G produced by macrophages is a substrate for cellular PGD synthase, affording PGD2-G. Pharmacological studies reveal that macrophage production of PGD2-G from endogenous sources of 2-AG is calcium-dependent and mediated by diacylglycerol lipase and COX-2. These results identify a distinct function for COX-2 in endocannabinoid metabolism and in the generation of a new family of prostaglandins derived from diacylglycerol and 2-AG.

Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 899-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The discovery of a second COX isoform, COX-2, has provided important insights into the molecular basis of inflammation, hyperalgesia, and cancer and has established a novel pharmacological target for their treatment (2DuBois R.N.

The major functional differences between COX-1 and COX-2 are believed to be related to their differential regulation and tissue distribution (5Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). COX-1 is a constitutive enzyme, whereas COX-2 is inducible and highly regulated by a range of agonists (6Evett G.E. Xie W. Chipman J.G. Robertson D.L. Simmons D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 7Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Lipids Lipid Metab. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). COX-1 activity accounts for PG and thromboxane production in gastric mucosa, kidney, and platelets (3Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2607) Google Scholar). COX-2 activity is primarily responsible for PG biosynthesis in the central nervous system and inflammatory cells (8Masferrer J.L. Zweifel B.S. Manning P.T. Hauser S.D. Leahy K.M. Smith W.G.

Cell Biol. 1993; 197: 494-500Google Scholar). These observations suggest that COX-1 and COX-2 serve different physiological and pathophysiological functions. The possibility that COX-2 has distinct biochemical functions has not been explored extensively. There are conserved structural differences between the active sites of COX-1 and COX-2 which have been exploited in the development of selective COX-2 inhibitors. It is possible that these or other structural differences may have evolved to support separate biochemical functions for the two COX isoforms. The first indication of a separate biochemical function for COX-2 was provided by the observation that it selectively oxygenates the neutral ethanolamide derivative of arachidonic acid, anandamide (11Yu M. Ives D. Ramesha C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21181-21186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) are endogenous ligands for the cannabinoid receptors that bind Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol and mediate its pharmacological effects (12Felder C.C. Glass M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 179-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The cannabimimetic properties of 2-AG were first reported in 1995, and subsequent investigations demonstrated that this monoglyceride is present in vivo at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than anandamide (13Mechoulam R. Ben-Shabat S. Hanus L. Ligumsky M. Kaminski N.E. Schatz A.R. Gopher A. Almog S. Martin B.R. Compton D.R. Pertwee R.G. Griffin G. Bayewitch M. Barg J. Vogel Z. Biochem.

Extensive structure-activity studies suggest that 2-AG is the intrinsic natural ligand for the peripheral cannabinoid (CB2) receptor, widely expressed in immune tissues, and a physiological ligand for the central cannabinoid (CB1) receptor (16Sugiura T. Kodaka T. Nakane S. Miyashita T. Kondo S. Suhara Y. Takayama H. Waku K. Seki C. Baba N. Ishima Y. J. Biol.

The biochemical pathways for the generation of 2-AG are distinct from those responsible for anandamide biosynthesis and involve diacylglycerol production and hydrolysis (18Di Marzo V. Bisogno T. De Petrocellis L. Melck D. Orlando P. Wagner J.A. Kunos G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) (Structures 1–s3). Several observations prompted us to investigate the ability of COX-2 to utilize 2-AG as a substrate. The expression of COX-2 in the central nervous and immune systems parallels the distribution of the CB1 and CB2 receptors, respectively (7Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Lipids Lipid Metab. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar, 12Felder C.C. Glass M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 179-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). 2-AG is present at high levels in regions of the brain and in immune cells where COX-2 is expressed, and 2-AG appears to be unique in its ability to activate efficiently both known cannabinoid receptors (14Stella N. Schweitzer P. Piomelli D. Nature. 1997; 388: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 18Di Marzo V. Bisogno T. De Petrocellis L. Melck D. Orlando P. Wagner J.A. Kunos G. Eur. J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 256: 377-380Google Scholar). Finally, neutralization of the carboxylic acid of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent, indomethacin, by esterification results in potent, highly selective COX-2 inhibitors, suggesting that arachidonyl esters may serve as COX-2 selective substrates (20Kalgutkar A.S. Crews B.C. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett A.B. Kozak K.R. Remmel R.P. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We report here that COX-2 oxygenates 2-AG as effectively as arachidonic acid. COX-2-mediated 2-AG oxygenation was demonstrated with purified enzyme and with intact macrophages. The products of 2-AG oxygenation are PG and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) esters that represent the first entries into a novel class of glyceryl eicosanoids. Site-directed mutagenesis indicates that conserved structural differences between COX-1 and COX-2 contribute significantly to the ability of COX-2 to oxygenate 2-AG. Finally, pharmacological characterization of the biosynthetic pathway leading to glyceryl prostaglandin production in macrophages demonstrates that COX-2 metabolizes 2-AG generated by turnover of diacylglycerol (DAG). These observations identify unique roles for COX-2 in 2-AG metabolism and in the generation of novel PG- and HETE-like lipids. 2-AG, 1-AG, and 1-[6-[[(17β)-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U-73122) were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Diarachidonylglycerols, arachidonic acid, arachidonic acid methyl ester, and arachidonic acid ethyl ester were obtained from NuChek Prep (Elysian, MN). DAG (1-stearyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycerol), indomethacin, ionomycin, and hematin were purchased from Sigma. 1,6-Bis-(cyclohexyloximinocarbonylamino)-hexane (RHC-80267) was obtained from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were obtained from Aldrich. COX-1 was purified from ram seminal vesicles (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI) as described (21Marnett L.J. Siedlik P.H. Ochs R.C. Pagels W.D. Das M. Honn K.V. Warnock R.H. Tainer B.E. Eling T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 328-335PubMed Google Scholar). Apoenzyme was prepared as outlined (22Odenwaller R. Chen Y.-N.P. Marnett L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of murine COX-2 was performed as described (23Rowlinson S.W. Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23305-23310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). COX-2 enzymes were expressed in Sf-9 insect cells by using the pVL1393 expression vector (PharMingen, San Diego) and purified by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration as described (23Rowlinson S.W. Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23305-23310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Apoenzymes were reconstituted with hematin prior to activity assays. COX activity was quantified as described (24Kalgutkar A.S. Kozak K.R. Crews B.C. Hochgesang Jr., G.P. Marnett L.J. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4800-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Enzyme kinetics were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the computer program Enzyme Kinetics 1.5 (Trinity Software, Campton, NH). Initial reaction velocity data were obtained from the linear portion of oxygen uptake curves. Arachidonic acid 2-hydroxyethyl ester and arachidonic acid 2-methoxyethyl ester were synthesized by coupling the carboxylic acid with the appropriate alcohol in the presence ofbis-(2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)phosphinic chloride. The compounds were purified by silica gel chromatography and characterized by1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectrometry (MS). 2-[1-(4-Chlorobenzoyl)-5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl]-N-phenethylacetamide (indomethacin phenethylamide) was synthesized as described (20Kalgutkar A.S. Crews B.C. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett A.B. Kozak K.R. Remmel R.P. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Pentadeuterated 1(3)-prostaglandin glycerol esters were prepared by 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride-mediated coupling of the target prostaglandin with anhydrous2H8-glycerol, purified by preparative thin layer silica gel chromatography (94:6 EtOAc:MeOH), and characterized by MS. Reduction of PGH2-G was accomplished by the rapid addition of SnCl2, Na2S2O4, or triphenylphosphine to incubations of COX-2 and 2-AG (1Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 899-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 25Marnett L.J. Bienkowski M.J. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). UV spectra of oxygenated 2-AG products were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard 1040A HPLC detection system. Saponification of glycerol esters and simultaneous dehydration/isomerization of PGE2 was accomplished by treatment of oxygenated 2-AG products in 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 8) containing 500 μm phenol with an equal volume of 1n NaOH for 1.5 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was acidified with 1.2 volumes 1 n HCl, then extracted with EtOAc. The free acids were analyzed by HPLC with UV detection at 278 nm (PGB2) and 235 nm (HETEs) (Supelcosil LC-18, 25 cm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm eluted with 80:20:0.01 MeOH:H2O:HOAc at 1.5 ml/min). Quantitation of PGE2-G and HETE-Gs generated by human COX-2 oxygenation of 2-AG was accomplished by determining the amounts of PGB2 and HETEs generated by base treatment. The amounts were calculated using standard curves generated by base treatment of known amounts of PGE2 and 11-HETE using 5-HETE as an internal standard. Liquid chromatography (LC)/MS was conducted with a Waters 2690 Separations Module with a Zorbax RX-C18 narrow bore column (15 cm × 2.1 mm, 5 μm) interfaced to a Finnigan TSQ-7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Sodiated analytes were eluted with increasing concentrations of MeCN in 0.001% aqueous NaOAc. Evaluation of glyceryl prostaglandin biosynthesis by RAW264.7 cells was conducted with selected ion monitoring, and quantitation was accomplished using pentadeuterated glyceryl prostaglandin standards. Electrospray ionization was carried out using nitrogen as sheath (76 p.s.i.) and auxiliary gas (14 p.s.i.) to assist with nebulization. A potential of 5.5 kV was applied to the electrospray ionization needle, and the capillary temperature was maintained at 220 °C. Mass spectral parameters were optimized to obtain maximum sensitivity without sacrificing unit resolution. Direct liquid infusion MS was generally conducted with solutions of 10–100 μg/ml (with respect to substrate) in MeOH:H2O or MeCN:H2O at an infusion rate of 10 μl/min. Collision-induced dissociation was accomplished with argon as the collision gas at a pressure of 2.25 × 10−3 torr in the second quadrupole. Displayed mass spectra and chromatograms are representative examples of no fewer than three independent experiments. Low passage number murine RAW264.7 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell activation was performed as described (26Landino L.M. Crews B.C. Timmons M.D. Morrow J.D. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15069-15074Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Briefly, macrophages (30–50% confluence) were activated with IFN-γ (10 units/ml) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 μg/ml) in serum-free DMEM for 7 h at 37 °C prior to treatment. Activated RAW264.7 cell medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh serum-free DMEM or phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle, indomethacin (3 μm), or indomethacin phenethylamide (3 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of 2-AG (20 μm). After 30 min, medium or phosphate-buffered saline was removed and extracted two times with an equal volume of CHCl3:MeOH (2:1). The solvent was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in 1 ml of H2O:MeCN (95:5) and applied to a water-charged C18 solid phase extraction column (Varian). Following a water wash, glyceryl prostaglandins were eluted with H2O:MeCN (3:7). The eluant was lyophilized, dissolved in H2O:MeCN (1:1), and subjected to LC/MS analysis. Exogenous 2-AG metabolism by RAW264.7 cells was evaluated in three independent experiments, and a representative result is displayed. Low passage number murine RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with IFN-γ and LPS as described above. Activated RAW264.7 cell medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh serum-free DMEM. Cells in a single well of a six-well plate were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle, indomethacin (3 μm), U-73122 (5 μm), or RHC-80267 (100 μm) for 20 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle or ionomycin (5 μm). After 20 min, medium was removed and treated with 8.0 ng of pentadeuterated glyceryl prostaglandin standard. Medium was extracted twice with an equal volume of CHCl3:MeOH (2:1). The solvent was evaporated, and the residue was redissolved in H2O:MeCN (1:1), filtered (0.22-μm nylon), and subjected to LC/MS analysis. Incubation of 2-AG with purified recombinant human COX-2 triggered O2 uptake comparable in rate and extent to that observed with arachidonic acid (Fig. 1). In contrast, relatively little O2 uptake was observed after the addition of sheep COX-1 to 2-AG. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed that both human COX-2 and mouse COX-2 oxygenated 2-AG with apparent k cat/K m values similar to those determined for arachidonic acid (TableI). Thek cat/K m of human COX-2 for 2-AG is 60-fold higher than the value of 0.065 s−1μm−1 reported for anandamide (27So O.-Y. Scarafia L.E. Mak A.Y. Callan O.H. Swinney D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5801-5807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Among a series of arachidonyl esters, 2-AG was clearly the preferred substrate (Fig. 2). The initial rate of 2-AG oxygenation displayed in Fig. 2 is approximately half the initial rate of arachidonic acid oxygenation in agreement with thek cat values determined for both substrates with murine COX-2 (Table I). Of particular interest, COX-2 oxygenated the more stable arachidonylglycerol regioisomer, 1-AG, at a markedly reduced rate. In addition, DAG, the biosynthetic precursor for 2-AG, and the related esters, 1,2-diarachidonylglycerol and 1,3-diarachidonylglycerol, were very poor substrates for COX-2 (Fig.2).Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters for COX-2 mediated 2-AG and arachidonic acid oxygenationk catK mk cat/K ms −1μms −1 μm −1Human COX-2 AA 1-aAA, arachidonic acid.14.7 ± 0.56.1 ± 0.62.4 2-AG17.4 ± 1.14.4 ± 0.94.0Murine COX-2 AA20.5 ± 1.68.2 ± 1.62.5 2-AG11.1 ± 0.74.7 ± 0.82.31-a AA, arachidonic acid.

Di-AA-G, diarachidonylglycerol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The products of 2-AG oxygenation were identified by MS. Organic extracts of reaction mixtures containing human COX-2 and 2-AG were infused directly into a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and analyzed following electrospray ionization. Two primary product masses were observed atm/z 449 and 417, which correspond to the sodiated molecular ions of the glyceryl esters of PGH2, PGE2, or PGD2, and 11- or 15-HETE, respectively (Fig. 3 a and Scheme FS1). The presence of sodium in the molecular ions was confirmed by collision-induced dissociation. Treatment of 2-AG/COX-2 incubation mixtures with endoperoxide reducing agents (triphenylphosphine, SnCl2, or Na2S2O4) resulted in the disappearance of the ion at m/z449 and the appearance of a product with a molecular ion atm/z 451 (Fig. 3 b). This is consistent with reduction of PGH2-G to PGF2α-G. Another peak was observed at m/z 377 in reaction mixtures quenched with Na2S2O4 (Fig.3 b) This mass corresponds to the sodiated form of the glyceryl ester of 12-hydroxyheptadeca-5,8,10-trienoic acid (HHT-G, Scheme FS1).Figure FS1In vitro transformations of 2-AG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LC/MS revealed the presence of four primary products in 2-AG/COX-2 reaction mixtures. Two closely eluting polar products each displayedm/z 449 consistent with PGE2-G and PGD2-G (Fig. 4 a). Pentadeuterated standards of glyceryl esters of PGE2 and PGD2 were synthesized and coeluted with these two polar products under multiple chromatographic conditions. In addition, two closely eluting nonpolar 2-AG metabolites were detected with anm/z of 417 consistent with the glyceryl esters of HETEs (Fig. 4 b). Finally, a minor product of intermediate polarity and m/z 377 was observed, which is consistent with HHT-G (data not shown). Estimates of relative amounts of the individual products were made by reversed-phase HPLC with UV detection. The two polar products withm/z 449 exhibited no significant absorption above 215 nm, whereas both the intermediate polarity, minor product and the two nonpolar products exhibited absorption maxima near 235 nm. The 235 nm absorbance maxium indicates the presence of a conjugated diene functionality. Base treatment of the oxygenated 2-AG metabolites afforded free acids that coeluted with standards of 15- and 11-HETE and the PGE2 dehydration/isomerization product, PGB2, which displayed an absorption maximum at 278 nm (Reaction FR1). Relative quantitation of PGE2-G and HETE-Gs was accomplished by HPLC/UV analysis of base-treated COX-2/2-AG incubation mixtures using 5-HETE as an internal standard. PGE2-G was the major product of oxygenation (PGE2-G/HETE-G = 4.0 ± 0.1, n = 5) and 11-HETE-G was more abundant than 15-HETE-G (11-HETE-G/15-HETE-G = 3.4 ± 0.1, n = 5). HETE-G regiochemistry was confirmed by mass spectrometry of saponified, HPLC-purified HETE products which demonstrated collision-induced dissociation patterns consistent with previous reports for 11- and 15-HETE (28MacPherson J.C. Pavlovich J.G. Jacobs R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This product profile for 2-AG oxygenation is similar to that of arachidonic acid oxygenation by COX-2 (29Rowlinson S.W. Crews B.C. Goodwin D.C. Schneider C. Gierse J.K. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6586-6591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The structural requirements for 2-AG oxygenation by COX-2 were probed by site-directed mutagenesis using murine proteins expressed in insect cells from baculovirus vectors and purified to homogeneity. An active site tyrosyl radical formed from Tyr-385 initiates arachidonic acid oxygenation by 13-pro-S hydrogen abstraction, and consequently, the Y385F mutant enzyme fails to oxidize arachidonic acid (30Shimokawa T. Kulmacz R.J. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20073-20076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, no oxygen uptake was detectable when 2-AG was incubated with Y385F mCOX-2. Arachidonic acid binds in the COX active site in an L-shaped conformation with the ω-end inserted in a hydrophobic channel near Gly-533 (Fig. 5) (23Rowlinson S.W. Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J.

Mutations that introduce steric bulk at position 533 prevent arachidonate binding and oxygenation (23Rowlinson S.W. Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol.

Consistent with previous results with arachidonic acid, no oxygen uptake was detected when 2-AG was incubated with the G533V enzyme. Arg-120 has been shown to ion-pair with the carboxylate moieties of both arachidonate and acidic non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (32Bhattacharyya D.K. Lecomte M. Rieke C.J. Garavito R.M.

Substitution of Arg-120 with glutamine in mCOX-2 reduced the maximal rate of 2-AG oxygenation to 11 ± 1% (n = 3) of the wild-type rate. This result was somewhat surprising because 2-AG does not contain a free carboxylate. Nevertheless, taken together, the results suggest that 2-AG binds within the COX-2 active site in a conformation similar to arachidonic acid with the ω-end positioned in the hydrophobic top channel, the polar head group near Arg-120, and the catalytically labile hydrogen situated near Tyr-385. The principal difference in the active sites of COX-1 and COX-2 is the presence in COX-2 of a side pocket off the main cyclooxygenase active site near the carboxylate binding region (34Luong C. Miller A. Barnett J. Chow J. Ramesha C. Browner M.F. Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 35Kurumbail R.G. Stevens A.M. Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J.

A comparable pocket is not accessible in COX-1 because of the substitution of Ile-523 for the Val-523 of COX-2 (36Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Hauser S.D. Rangwala S.H. Koboldt C.M. Seibert K. J. Biol.

This side pocket is the binding site for the substituted sulfonamide or sulfone groups of the COX-2-selective inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib. Other differences between COX-1 and COX-2 in this region include the substitutions R513H and V434I. The side pocket is encoded by all COX-2 genes sequenced to date, yet no physiological consequence of this conserved active site difference has been elucidated. We constructed a triple mutant of COX-2, V523I/R513H/V434I, which comprises the major side pocket differences between the two enzymes, and we incubated it with 2-AG. The maximal rate of O2 uptake by the mutant was 25 ± 3% (n = 3) of that observed with wild-type enzyme. When arachidonic acid was used as substrate, only minor differences were observed between the rates and extents of O2 uptake catalyzed by the triple mutant relative to wild-type COX-2 incubated with arachidonic acid (data not shown). This suggests that one function of the side pocket is to enhance oxygenation of the ester substrate, 2-AG. The ability of 2-AG to serve as a substrate for COX-2 in vitro raised the question of whether it could be oxidized in intact cells, where alternate metabolic enzymes, such as esterases, may compete with COX-2. The murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, was selected to address this question for several reasons. Unactivated RAW264.7 cells express no detectable COX-2 and low levels of COX-1, but IFN-γ and LPS induce COX-2 expression (38Wadleigh D.J. Reddy S.T. Kopp E. Ghosh S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6259-6266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The major arachidonic acid metabolite in these cells is PGD2, so RAW264.7 cells permit the simultaneous evaluation of 2-AG oxygenation to PGH2-G as well as endoperoxide metabolism by PGD synthase (26Landino L.M. Crews B.C. Timmons M.D. Morrow J.D. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15069-15074Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Finally, the CB2 gene is transcribed in RAW264.7 macrophages, suggesting that cannabinoid signaling mechanisms are present and important in these cells (39Jeon Y.J. Yang K.H. Pulaski J.T. Kaminski N.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 334-341PubMed Google Scholar). Glyceryl prostaglandins were not detectable in the medium from unactivated RAW264.7 cells after the addition of a physiologically relevant concentration of 2-AG (20 μm) (Fig.6). However, cells treated with LPS (1 μg/ml) and IFN-γ (10 units/ml) synthesized and released PGD2-G after the addition of 2-AG (Fig. 6). PGD2-G biosynthesis was inhibited by both indomethacin (3 μm) and the highly selective COX-2 inhibitor, 2-[1-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl]-N-phenethylacetamide (indomethacin phenethylamide, 3 μm). No significant endogenous PGD2-G biosynthesis was detectable in the absence of exogenous substrate under these conditions (Fig. 6 and data not shown). These studies demonstrate that 2-AG is a substrate for COX-2 in intact cells and that prostaglandin glycerol esters are released extracellularly. Furthermore, the absence of the nonenzymatic, PGH2-G isomerization product, PGE2-G, demonstrates that cellular PGD synthase metabolizes PGH2-G readily. The striking COX-2-dependent production of PGD2-G by RAW264.7 cells treated with exogenous 2-AG prompted an extension of these studies into a more physiologically relevant setting. We investigated the possibility that cellular COX-2 oxygenates 2-AG released from endogenous cellular stores. 2-AG is generated in vivo through the Ca2+-dependent formation of sn-1-acyl-2-arachidonylglycerols followed by hydrolysis of the sn-1-acyl group by diacylglycerol lipase (14Stella N. Schweitzer P. Piomelli D. Nature. 1997; 388: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 40Bisogno T. Sepe N. Melck D. Maurelli S. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Ionomycin stimulation (5 μm) of IFN-γ/LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells resulted in the production and extracellular release of PGD2-G (Fig. 6). Quantification of PGD2-G using a pentadeuterated standard revealed 7.0 ± 0.1 ng of PGD2-G released/106 cells (mean ± S.E.,n = 9). Thus, activated RAW264.7 cells effect both the biosynthesis and COX-2-dependent oxygenation of the vasomodulatory endocannabinoid, 2-AG, upon calcium ionophore stimulation. Endogenous PGD2-G production was potently inhibited by indomethacin (3 μm) and RHC-80267 (100 μm), a selective diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor (Fig.7) (41Sutherland C.A. Amin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14006-14010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both indomethacin and RHC-80267 effected dose-dependent inhibition of PGD2-G biosynthesis (data not shown). In addition, the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 (5 μm) inhibited PGD2-G biosynthesis by approximately 35% (Fig. 7) (42Bleasdale J.E. Thakur N.R. Gremban R.S. Bundy G.L. Fitzpatrick F.A. Smith R.J. Bunting S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 756-768PubMed Google Scholar). Higher concentrations of U-73122 were not evaluated because of its low aqueous solubility. The moderate inhibition by U-73122 suggests a role for phospholipase C in DAG generation leading to PGD2-G biosynthesis, but we cannot rule out a contribution from phospholipase D (43Bisogno T. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2113-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, PGD2-G biosynthesis is calcium-dependent and results from the sequential actions of DAG lipase, COX-2, and PGD synthase (Scheme FS2).Figure FS2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The present findings establish a function for COX-2 in the oxidation of the endogenous cannabinoid, 2-AG. The striking catalytic efficiency of COX-2 mediated 2-AG oxygenation coupled with evidence that 2-AG is the preferred ester substrate, even when compared with 1-AG, suggests that this endocannabinoid is a natural COX-2 substrate. Comparable oxygenation of 2-AG was observed with human and mouse COX-2, whereas 2-AG was a very poor substrate for sheep COX-1. This suggests that 2-AG oxygenation is a selective function of COX-2. Similar selectivity is observed in the COX-2-dependent oxygenation of anandamide (11Yu M. Ives D. Ramesha C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21181-21186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the present study, no glyceryl prostaglandins were detected after incubation of 2-AG with unactivated RAW264.7 cells, which contain detectable levels of COX-1 (Fig. 6). The identification of active site residues that promote efficient metabolism of 2-AG provides a molecular basis for isoform selectivity and suggests a raison d'être for the highly conserved side pocket in COX-2 enzymes. Thus, in addition to differential regulation and tissue distribution, altered substrate specificity may represent an evolutionary impetus for the existence of two COX isoforms. Our initial studies only evaluated the role of residues that represent conserved differences between COX-2 and COX-1 in the side pocket region. There are other conserved differences between the two enzymes in the lobby region located below Arg-120, and their importance in the differential oxygenation of 2-AG is under evaluation. The ability of intact cells to biosynthesize glyceryl prostaglandins when treated with exogenous 2-AG demonstrates that COX-2 may compete effectively for this endocannabinoid with other enzymes involved in its metabolism (e.g. esterases and acyltransferases). The detection of glyceryl prostaglandins in stimulated RAW264.7 cell medium, in the absence of exogenous 2-AG treatment, elucidates a 2-AG biosynthetic capacity in these macrophages and extends a recent observation that this endocannabinoid is produced in the murine macrophage cell line, J774 (40Bisogno T. Sepe N. Melck D. Maurelli S. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). More importantly, this observation demonstrates that endogenously generated 2-AG is a substrate for COX-2 action. Inhibition of PGD2-G synthesis in macrophages by a DAG lipase inhibitor establishes a direct relationship between DAG production and glyceryl prostaglandin biosynthesis. This suggests that COX-2 occupies a central role in diverse signal transduction pathways involving DAG, endocannabinoids, and novel prostaglandin-like lipids. The ability of the endoperoxide product of COX-2 action, PGH2-G, to serve as a substrate for PGD synthase raises the possibility that 2-AG may be the precursor to a family of eicosanoids as diverse as those produced from arachidonic acid. Our finding that PGD2-G is synthesized intracellularly and released extracellularly suggests that glyceryl prostaglandins are sufficiently stable to serve as intracellular or intercellular mediators. Evaluation of the binding of glyceryl prostaglandins to cell surface or nuclear receptors may provide insight into the mechanisms by which COX-2 produces manifold responses in both the central nervous and immune systems. Finally, these findings establish a role for COX-2 in endogenous cannabinoid metabolism. Although anandamide oxygenation by COX-2 has been reported, previous investigations produced varied results, employed anandamide concentrations significantly higher than those present in vivo, and did not demonstrate oxygenation of anandamide released from endogenous cellular stores (11Yu M. Ives D. Ramesha C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21181-21186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 27So O.-Y. Scarafia L.E. Mak A.Y. Callan O.H. Swinney D.C. J. Biol.

Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2000; 61: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The present findings establish that endogenously released 2-AG is oxygenated by COX-2 in agonist-stimulated macrophages. This suggests that COX-2 may play a regulatory role in endocannabinoid signaling by decreasing 2-AG levels and reducing tone at CB receptors (45Pinto J.C. Potie F. Rice K.C. Boring D. Johnson M.R.

The PON genes appear to have arisen by gene duplication of a common evolutionary precursor because they share considerable structural homology and are located adjacently on chromosome 7 in humans and on chromosome 6 in mice (1Primo-Parmo S.L. Sorenson R.C. Teiber J. La Du B.N. Genomics. 1996; 33: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). PON1, also known as serum paraoxonase/arylesterase (EC 3.1.8.1), is closely associated with high density lipoproteins (HDL)1 and catalyzes the hydrolysis of a variety of aromatic carboxylic acid esters and several organophosphates (2La Du B.N.

Recently, we reported that purified human and rabbit serum PON1 also hydrolyze of a variety of lactones and cyclic carbonate esters, including naturally occurring lactones and pharmacological agents (4Billecke S.

Any physiological role of PON1 is still speculative; however, several lines of evidence suggest that this enzyme protects against atherosclerosis by preventing the oxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) (see Refs. 7Mackness M.I.

PON1 knockout mice are more susceptible to organophosphate toxicity as well as to atherosclerosis produced by an atherogenic diet (11Shih D.M. Gu L. Xia Y.-R. Navab M. Li W.-F. Hama S.

Within a given species, PON1, PON2, and PON3 share about 70% identity at the nucleotide level and about 60% identity at the amino acid level, whereas between the mammalian species particular PONs (1, 2, or 3) share 81–91% identity on the nucleotide level and 79–90% identity at the amino acid level (1Primo-Parmo S.L.

In the present study, a rabbit serum lactonase distinct from PON1 was purified and characterized. This is a 40-kDa protein that has an N-terminal sequence (25 amino acids) that exactly matches the deduced amino acid sequence predicted by the rabbit PON3 cDNA we have cloned and that agrees closely with the sequence reported recently for rabbit liver microsomal paraoxonase (MsPON) (15Ozols J. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 265-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We defined the substrate specificity of the purified rabbit serum PON3 over a number of esters and lactones and confirmed it with transiently expressed recombinant rabbit PON3. Of considerable interest is the close HDL association of serum PON3 and its enhanced ability compared with rabbit serum PON1 to protect LDL against oxidation. Rabbit blood was collected by ear vein bleeding and cardiac puncture of anesthetized (ketamine, 40 mg/kg intramuscular, and acetopromazine, 1 mg/kg intramuscular) New Zealand White female rabbits. The blood was allowed to clot for 30 min at room temperature, and the serum was obtained after centrifugation for 15 min at 2,000 × g. DEAE Bio-Gel A and SDS-PAGE low range protein molecular weight standards were obtained from Bio-Rad. Sephacryl 200 was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cibacron Blue 3GA-agarose type 3000, concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B, Tergitol NP-10, and mevastatin (Compactin) were obtained from Sigma. Lovastatin (Mevacor®) and simvastatin (Zocor®) were purchased as 20-mg tablets from Merck, from which the lactones were extracted with chloroform, evaporated to dryness, and redissolved in methanol. ε-Caprolactone was obtained from Acros Chimica (Fair Lawn, NJ). All other lactones and esters used were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Acetonitrile high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade was purchased from Mallinckrodt Chemical Works. Glacial acetic acid, methanol, and water (HPLC grade) were obtained from Fisher. Centicons and Centriprep concentrators were purchased from Amicon, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The initial steps in the purification of rabbit serum PON3 essentially followed the procedure for purification of serum PON1 previously developed in this laboratory (6Kuo C.-L. La Du B.N. Drug Metab.

Rabbit serum was mixed batchwise with Cibacron Blue 3 GA-agarose in 3 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 μm EDTA, poured into a column, and washed with the same buffer until theA 280 was below 0.3 A units and further with two column volumes of 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2. The column was developed with 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mmCaCl2, 20% glycerol, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate; 10-ml fractions were collected at 1 ml/min. Fractions were monitored for both arylesterase activity (phenyl acetate hydrolysis) and lactonase activity (lovastatin hydrolysis) to localize PON1 and PON3, respectively. The two activities co-eluted after Blue-agarose chromatography of serum but were almost completely separated on a DEAE anion exchange column by elution with a linear 300-ml of 0–175 mm NaCl gradient in TCGT buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% non-ionic detergent Tergitol NP-10). Fractions (5 ml) were collected at 0.55 ml/min. Fractions with arylesterase or lactonase activities were purified further separately on a second DEAE column with a NaCl gradient of 0–120 mm for PON1 and 0–175 mmfor PON3. Fractions with lactonase activity from the second DEAE column were pooled, concentrated 10-fold using a 10-kDa Centricon ultrafiltration unit, and loaded onto a Sephacryl 200 gel filtration column (100 cm × 1 cm). Proteins were eluted with TCGT buffer and 1 ml fractions were collected at 17 ml/h. Fractions with the highest lactonase activities and the lowest contamination with other proteins, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), were pooled and passed through a concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B column. PON3 did not bind to this column and was collected in 25 mmTris/HCl buffer (pH 7.2), 1 mm CaCl2. PON1-containing fractions from a second DEAE column were pooled, loaded on a concanavalin A column, and eluted with a 0–200 mmα-d-mannopyranoside gradient in 25 mmTris/HCl buffer (pH 7.2), 1 mm CaCl2. Finally, the PON1 and PON3 preparations were washed with TCGT buffer using a 50-kDa cut-off Centricon ultrafiltration unit to adjust the buffer and to remove residual concanavalin A fragments. The enzyme preparations were stored at 4 °C without substantial loss of activity for more than 3 months. Protein was determined by its UV absorption at 280 nm or in samples containing Tergitol NP-10 by the BCA protein assay (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's protocol. SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. The N-terminal peptide sequencing was performed at the University of Michigan Protein Sequencing Core Laboratory using the Model 494 HT Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). Total rabbit liver RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the supplier's protocol. RT-PCR was performed with the Titan One-tube RT-PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers for human PON3 (1Primo-Parmo S.L. Sorenson R.C.

(Midland, TX). The RT-PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel. Bands of the expected size (as deduced by their similarity to the human PON3) were excised and submitted for sequencing in our DNA Sequencing Core Laboratory. Based on the obtained sequence, primers RPx3–4 (CTCATCTGGTGCAAAGTTTGG) and RPx3–1 (ACAACAACGCTCTCTTGTAC) were designed (these and all of the primers below were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.) and used for amplification of the 5′- and 3′-ends of rabbit PON3 cDNA using a 5′,3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Based on the sequence of the new primers of these fragments, RPx3–5 (ATCGGAA TTCCATGGCGAAGCTCCTGC) and RPx3–6 (AGGCCTCGAGCTGGAGACTAGAGCAC) were designed and used to amplify the full-length cDNA. The PCR product (∼1200 base pairs) was cloned in the pCR®II vector with a TOPO®TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced. PON3 clones from at least five animals were sequenced in both directions, and the consensus sequence was submitted to the GenBankTM (accession number AF220944). The rabbit PON3 clone in pCR®II vector was digested withEcoRI (Promega) and XhoI (Life Technologies, Inc.) and ligated into a pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector (Invitrogen). The plasmid was propagated in Escherichia coliTOP10 cells (Invitrogen) and then purified using the Qiagen plasmid maxi kit. The insert was sequenced to verify its structure. The highly transfectable 293T/17 human embryonic kidney cell line (ATCC CRL 11268) was used with the permission of David Baltimore (Rockefeller University, New York). Cells were grown in minimum essential medium (Celox Laboratories, Inc., St. Paul, MN) supplemented with 10% heat-deactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA as described (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.30-16.37Google Scholar). The medium containing the recombinant enzyme was collected after allowing transfected cells to grow for 4–5 days. The recombinant PON3 was partly purified using a small Blue-agarose column as described above. The lactonase activity (lovastatin hydrolysis) was used to follow the level of expression/secretion in the culture medium and to localize PON3 in the column fractions. Esterase activities with substrates phenyl acetate, S-phenyl thioacetate, α-naphtyl acetate, and paraoxon were measured as described elsewhere (6Kuo C.-L. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 935-944PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gan K.N. Smolen A. Eckerson H.W. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1991; 19: 100-106PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of aromatic lactones was monitored by the increase in UV absorbance at 270 nm (dihydrocoumarin), 274 nm (2-coumaranone), and 290 nm (homogentisic acid lactone). In a typical experiment a cuvette contained 1 mm substrate (from a 100 mm stock, dissolved in methanol) in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, and 5–20 μl of enzyme in a total volume of 1 ml. The molar difference extinction coefficients (difference between the absorption coefficients of the acid formed and the lactone) used to calculate the rate of hydrolysis were 1295, 876, and 816 m−1cm−1 for dihydrocoumarin, 2-coumaranone, and homogentisic acid lactone, respectively (5Billecke, S., Draganov, D., Counsell, R., Stetson, P., Watson, C., Hsu, C., and La Du, B. N. (2000) Drug Metab. Dispos.,28, in press.Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of other lactones was followed by a colorimetric assay with phenol red (5Billecke, S., Draganov, D., Counsell, R., Stetson, P., Watson, C., Hsu, C., and La Du, B. N. (2000) Drug Metab. Dispos.,28, in press.Google Scholar, 19Billecke S.S. Primo-Parmo S.L. Dunlop C.S. Dorn J.A. La Du B.N. Broomfield C.A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1999; 119–120: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The reaction cuvette contained 1 mm substrate (from a 100 mm stock solution, dissolved in methanol) in 2 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, 0.004% (106 μm) phenol red, 0.005% bovine albumin, and 5–20 μl of enzyme in a total volume of 1 ml. The rate of acid production was followed by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 422 nm. The rate of hydrolysis was derived from a calibration curve obtained using known amounts of HCl as described previously (19Billecke S.S. Primo-Parmo S.L. Dunlop C.S. Dorn J.A. La Du B.N. Broomfield C.A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1999; 119–120: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The enzymatic assays were performed at 25 °C using a dual beam Cary 3E UV/visible spectrophotometer (Varian, Australia). Reference cuvettes containing the appropriate buffer plus substrate were used in each assay to correct for any spontaneous hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of the statin lactones (mevastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin) was analyzed by HPLC using a Beckman System Gold HPLC with a model 126 programmable solvent module, a model 168 diode array detector set at 238 nm, a model 7125 rheodyne manual injector valve with a 20-μl loop, and a Beckman ODS Ultrasphere column (C18, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm). In a final volume of 1 ml, 10–200 μl of enzyme and 10 μl of substrate solution in methanol (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated at 25 °C in 25 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm CaCl2. Aliquots (100 μl) were removed at specified times and added to acetonitrile (100 μl), vortexed, and centrifuged for 1 min at maximum speed (Beckman Microfuge). The supernatants were poured into new tubes, capped, and stored on ice until HPLC analysis. Samples were eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with a mobile phase consisting of the following: A = acetic acid/acetonitrile/water (2:249:249, v/v/v) and B = acetonitrile, in A/B ratios of 50/50, 45/55, and 40/60 for mevastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin, respectively. Under the above conditions the retention times for the carboxylic acid formed and the lactone substrate were as follows: 4.5/6.4 min (mevastatin), 4.4/6.6 min (lovastatin), and 4.8/6.6 min (simvastatin). Response factors for the acid products were calculated from the peak heights after complete alkaline hydrolysis of the lactones in 0.02 m NaOH. Serum was loaded onto a Bio-Gel A-15m column (36 × 1.8 cm) and eluted with 50 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2. Fractions were collected and analyzed on a Hitachi 912 autoanalyzer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for phospholipids, triglycerides, and total and esterified cholesterol using commercially available kits from Wako Bioproducts (Richmond, VA). Representative fractions were combined, concentrated, and analyzed by high performance gel filtration chromatography (HPGC) to determine the lipoprotein cholesterol distribution as described elsewhere (20Kieft K.A. Bocan T.M. Krause B.R. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 859-866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were prepared by sequential flotation ultracentrifugation to isolate very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) (d <1.019 g/ml), LDL (d = 1.019 to 1.063 g/ml), and HDL (d = 1.063 to 1.2 g/ml) (21Hatch F.T. Adv. Lipid Res. 1968; 6: 1-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoprotein fractions were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C for 24 h, then kept at 4 °C in the dark. The isolated fractions were analyzed within the next 3–4 days for enzymatic activities and by HPGC to confirm their identity and purity as described (20Kieft K.A. Bocan T.M. Krause B.R. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 859-866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human LDL was isolated by ultracentrifugation as described above and used within the next 3–4 days. LDL (0.1 mg protein/ml) oxidation was induced with 2–10 μm CuSO4 in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) in the absence or presence of PON3 or PON1 for up to 5 h at 37 °C. The kinetics of lipoprotein oxidation was followed by monitoring conjugated diene formation at 234 nm (22Esterbauer H. Striegl G. Puhl H. Rotheneder M. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1989; 6: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar) using a quartz microtiter plate in a SPECTRAmax® 190 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The lag time was estimated by drawing a perpendicular line to the x axis from the intersection of straight lines drawn through the absorption curves during the lag phase and the propagation phase, as illustrated on Fig.4 A. Lipoprotein oxidation was also determined by the lipid peroxides test, which analyzes lipid peroxides by their capacity to convert iodide to iodine, as measured photometrically at 365 nm (23El-Saadani M. Esterbauer H. El-Sayed M. Goher M. Nassar A.Y. Jurgens G.A. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 627-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purification of PON3 from rabbit serum is summarized in TableI. We used lovastatin hydrolysis (lactonase activity) and phenyl acetate hydrolysis (arylesterase activity) to follow purification of PON3 and PON1, respectively. During the Blue-agarose chromatography of serum, both activities co-eluted (Fig. 1 A) but were resolved by DEAE anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 1 B). Fractions with peak arylesterase activity were eluted at 87 mm NaCl and fractions with peak lactonase activity were eluted at 105 mm NaCl, respectively. The lactonase activity was further purified through a second DEAE and a Sephacryl 200 gel filtration column and correlated with the intensity of a 40-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE. Two other proteins with molecular masses of 50 and 63 kDa co-purified through all steps and became enriched during the purification (Fig. 1 C, 2nd lane). The three proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and each was submitted for N-terminal sequencing. The resolved peptide sequences are presented on TableII. The N terminus of the 40-kDa protein is identical with the deduced amino acids sequence of the rabbit PON3 cDNA we cloned (see below) and 96% identical with the amino acid sequence of MsPON (15Ozols J. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 265-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N terminus of the 50-kDa protein is 73% identical with the deduced sequence (residues 22 to 36) of the human platelet-activated factor acetyl hydrolase (PAF-AH) precursor (25Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Staffarini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Le Trong H. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid of the purified human PAF-AH is Ile-42, and the estimated size of the enzyme on SDS-PAGE is 44–45 kDa (25Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Staffarini D.M. Dietsch G.

Thus, the rabbit analogue of PAF-AH has 20 additional N-terminal amino acids, which could explain the observed difference in the molecular mass. The N terminus of the 63-kDa protein is 93% identical with both human and mouse vanin 1 (26Granjeaud S. Naquet P. Galland F. Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 964-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both PAF-AH and vanin proteins areN-glycosylated (25Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Staffarini D.M. Dietsch G.

The lactonase activity did not bind to the column, and the washout fractions showed a single band on SDS-PAGE with trace contamination of albumin and concanavalin A fragments (Fig.1 C, lanes 3–5).Table IPurification of rabbit serum PON3VolumeProteinActivitySpecific activityYieldFold purificationmlmgnmol/minnmol/min/mg%nSerum1557,0002,2940.331001Blue-agarose721088357.837241st DEAE401032632.614992nd DEAE217.132145.814139Sephacryl 20060.7592125.84382Concanavalin A60.2431130.01.4395Results are given for a typical purification run.

https://openalex.org/W2086222356,"Vanilloid receptor subunit 1 (VR1) is a nonselective cation channel that integrates multiple pain-producing stimuli. VR1 channels are blocked with high efficacy by the well established noncompetitive antagonist ruthenium red and exhibit high permeability to divalent cations. The molecular determinants that define these functional properties remain elusive. We have addressed this question and evaluated by site-specific neutralization the contribution on pore properties of acidic residues located in the putative VR1 pore region. Mutant receptors expressed inXenopus oocytes exhibited capsaicin-operated ionic currents akin to those of wild type channels. Incorporation of glutamine residues at Glu648 and Glu651 rendered minor effects on VR1 pore attributes, while Glu636 slightly modulated pore blockade. In contrast, replacement of Asp646by asparagine decreased 10-fold ruthenium red blockade efficacy and reduced 4-fold the relative permeability of the divalent cation Mg2+ with respect to Na+ without changing the selectivity of monovalent cations. At variance with wild type channels and E636Q, E648Q, and E651Q mutant receptors, ruthenium red blockade of D646N mutants was weakly sensitive to extracellular pH acidification. Collectively, our results suggest that Asp646 is a molecular determinant of VR1 pore properties and imply that this residue may form a ring of negative charges that structures a high affinity binding site for cationic molecules at the extracellular entryway.

Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6985) Google Scholar). VR1 is a nonselective cation channel with high Ca2+permeability that integrates both types of pain-producing stimuli (1Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D.

These channels are activated by vanilloids such as capsaicin, the pungent ingredient of hot red peppers, and by temperatures higher than 40 °C (1Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A.

Recently, the lipid-based anandanamide was shown to be a potential endogenous VR1 agonist (6Zygmunt P. Peterson J. Andersson D. Chuang H. Sørgård M. Di Marzo V. Julius D. Högestätt E. Nature. 1999; 400: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). Activation of the VR1 channel raises intracellular Ca2+ and excites a subset of dorsal root and trigeminal ganglion primary neurons (5Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 159-211PubMed Google Scholar). These neurons transmit noxious information to the central nervous system and release proinflammatory neuropeptides at peripheral terminals (5Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 159-211PubMed Google Scholar, 7). In addition to playing a role in nociception, the high Ca2+permeability exhibited by VR1 strongly desensitizes capsaicin-operated responses (5Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 159-211PubMed Google Scholar, 7). This property partially accounts for the antinociceptive activity exhibited by vanilloids (5Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Pharmacol.

Although the molecular composition and stoichiometry of neuronal VR1 channels is undetermined, heterologous expression of VR1 subunits gives rise to homomeric receptors that recapitulate most of the reported physiological properties (1Caterina M.J.

Nonetheless, there is mounting evidence for molecular heterogeneity of vanilloid receptors, including the identification of a stretch-inactivating channel (11Suzuki M. Sato J. Kutsuwada K. Ooki G. Imai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6330-6335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), a vanilloid receptor-like protein (VRl-1) (12Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar), and an N-terminal splice variant of VR1 (VR.5′sv) (13Schumacher M.A. Moff I. Sudanagunta S.P. Levine J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2756-2762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Structurally, VR1 subunits display a hydrophilic intracellular N terminus domain containing three conserved ankyrin repeats and several kinase consensus sequences (Fig. 1). This protein domain might also contain the vanilloid binding site (13Schumacher M.A. Moff I. Sudanagunta S.P. Levine J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2756-2762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Jung J. Hwang S.W. Kwak J. Lee S.-Y. Kang C.-J. Kim W.B. Kim D. Oh U. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 529-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity analysis of the protein reveals the presence of six putative transmembrane-spanning segments (S1 through S6) and a stretch linking the fifth and sixth segments that contains an amphipathic fragment denoted as the P-loop (Fig. 1). By analogy with shaker-like ion channels, this protein motif could critically contribute to structure the channel permeation pathway (15Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. McKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 68-77Crossref Scopus (5701) Google Scholar). Because this is a newly identified channel family, the molecular determinants that specify its pore attributes are yet unrecognized. Thus, their elucidation is a target of intense research. Amino acid sequence analysis of the VR1 putative pore region reveals the presence of four acidic residues, Glu636, Asp646, Glu648, and Glu651 (Fig. 1), that may play an important role defining the channel ion selectivity and blockade by noncompetitive antagonists such as ruthenium red (RR) (1Caterina M.J.

Recent evidence shows that mutation of Glu648 significantly reduced proton-activated currents without altering heat- or capsaicin-evoked responses or without eliminating the ability of protons to potentiate responses to these stimuli (17Jort S.-V.

Here, we report that site-specific neutralization of these negatively charged positions generated functional, capsaicin-operated ion channels and show that the amino acid at position 646 modulates the RR inhibition efficacy. Furthermore, our results show that neutralization of Asp646 significantly reduced the permeability of divalent cations with respect to Na+ without affecting that characteristic of monovalent cations. Taken together, these experiments support the tenet that Asp646 is a structural determinant of the VR1 pore-forming region.Figure 1Putative molecular determinants of the permeation properties of ionotropic VR1 receptors. The proposed molecular model for VR1 subunits consists of (a) an N-terminal domain containing three ankyrin repeats (●), (b) six transmembrane-spanning segments and a large stretch connecting the fifth and sixth membrane segments that contains a short amphipathic fragment (curved arrow), and (c) an intracellular C-terminal domain.

Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction as described (19Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M.

Mutant receptors were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Capped cRNA was synthesized using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ from Ambion (Austin, TX). 2–5 ng of cRNA was microinjected (V = 50 nl) into defolliculated oocytes (stages V and VI) as described (19Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1994; 6: 60-69Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Oocytes were functionally assayed 3–5 days after cRNA injection. Capsaicin-evoked whole cell currents were measured under voltage clamp (Turbo TEC 10CD; NPI Electronics, Tamm, FRG) with a two-microelectrode voltage clamp (19Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M.

Oocytes were transferred to the recording chamber (V = 0.2 ml) and were perfused (1 ml/min) with the appropriate Ringer's solution in the absence and/or presence of capsaicin as VR1 agonist. Dose-response relationships for RR inhibition were obtained in Mg2+-Ringer's solution (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 115 mm NaCl, 3.0 mm KCl, 0.1 mmBaCl2, 2.0 mm MgCl2). Homomeric VR-1 channels were activated by application of 20 μmcapsaicin in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of RR at a holding potential (V h) of −80 mV. Responses were normalized with respect to that evoked in the absence of channel blocker. Dose-response curves were fitted to a Michaelis-Menten binding isotherm (21Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Sun W.

I-V characteristics were recorded using a ramp protocol (PULSE/PULSEFIT; HEKA, FRG); oocytes were depolarized from −80 mV 20 mV in 4 s (25 mV/s) unless otherwise indicated. Leak currents were measured in the absence of agonist in the external bath medium and subtracted from the ionic current recorded in its presence.

To determine the relative ionic permeabilities of monovalent and divalent cations with respect to Na+, we applied the constant field approximation using the GHK equation (22Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Sun W. Montal M. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 749-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 23Lewis C.A. J. Physiol. 1979; 286: 501-527Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar). As a divalent cation, we used Mg2+, because, at variance with Ca2+, this cation does not block or desensitize VR channels (1Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6985) Google Scholar, 2Tominaga M. Caterina M.J. Malmberg A.B. Rosen T.A. Gilvert H. Skinner K. Raumann B.E. Basbaum A.I. Julius D.

Reversal potentials (V r) were obtained in the following external solutions: 125 mm sodium, 2 mmmagnesium, 125 mm NaCl, 2.0 mmMgCl2; 20 mm sodium, 1 mmmagnesium, 20 mm NaCl, 1.0 mmMgCl2, 105 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMG); 20 mmsodium, 2 mm magnesium, 20 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NMG; 20 mm sodium, 5 mm magnesium; 20 mmNaCl, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 95 mm NMG; 20 mm sodium, 10 mm magnesium, 20 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 85 mm NMG. All Ringer's solutions contained 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 3.0 mm KCl. Since Mg2+ does not activate the endogenous Ca2+-activated, voltage-dependent chloride conductance (24Miledi R. Parker I. J. Physiol. 1985; 357: 173-183Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar), the contribution of Cl− permeability to the reversal potentials was considered negligible. The GHK equation modified to include the contribution of the permeability to divalent cations is as follows (21Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Sun W. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8021-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Sun W. Montal M. Biophys.

The intracellular ion concentration of 130 mm produced the minimal χ2 in the fitting of the experimental data to the GHK equation. Activity coefficients (γ) were taken as 0.25 and 0.75 for Mg2+ and monovalent cations (Na+ and K+), respectively (1Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6985) Google Scholar). The junction potential between the ground electrode and bath consequent to changing the extracellular ionic conditions from 20 mm sodium/1 mm magnesium to 20 mmsodium/10 mm magnesium was 2 mV.V r values were corrected accordingly, plotted as a function of the extracellular ionic activity, and fitted to the GHK equation with a nonlinear least-squares regression algorithm using the MicroCal ORIGIN version 5.0 (Microcal, Amherst, MA) (21Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Sun W. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8021-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The goodness of fit was inferred from the χ2 test. To study the functional role played by negatively charged residues located within or nearby the proposed P-loop of VR1 channels (Fig. 1), we neutralized these acidic amino acids. Wild type and mutant receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes for functional characterization. Heterologous expression of VR1 transcripts in frog oocytes generated capsaicin-elicited ionic currents that, at concentrations ≤10 μm, activated slowly to reach a relatively stable plateau level and subsided rapidly to base line upon agonist washout (Fig. 2 A). Higher vanilloid concentrations accelerated receptor activation and concomitantly delayed agonist removal (Fig. 2 B). These capsaicin-operated responses exhibited an EC50(concentration of agonist to activate half-maximal response) of ∼0.5 μm, in agreement with other reports (1Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6985) Google Scholar, 2Tominaga M. Caterina M.J. Malmberg A.B. Rosen T.A. Gilvert H. Skinner K. Raumann B.E. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar). Neutralization of acidic residues in the pore region did not significantly modify capsaicin efficacy (EC50 ∼0.2–0.5 μm for E636Q, D646N, E648Q, and E651Q mutants); nor did it change dramatically the maximal response to capsaicin instillation with respect to wild type channels (see legend to Fig. 2). Likewise, the kinetic profile of capsaicin-elicited inward currents was not altered by the mutations performed (data not shown). To investigate whether the mutated amino acids modulate pore properties, we used as a sensitive pore probe the positively charged ruthenium red, a VR1 channel blocker. These studies were performed at saturating vanilloid concentrations to ensure complete and fast channel opening. We choose 20 μm capsaicin because it evoked a rapid activation to a plateau level that readily declined to the original base line upon agonist washout (Fig. 2 B). As illustrated in Fig. 2 C, oocytes expressing wild type channels exhibited capsaicin-operated ionic currents that were rapidly blocked in a concentration-dependent manner by micromolar RR concentrations applied extracellularly. RR inhibition of VR1 channels was washable and weakly voltage-dependent (data not shown). Neutralization of Glu636 and Glu648to glutamine gave rise to functional channels that responded to capsaicin and displayed RR sensitivity similar to that characteristic of wild type receptors (Fig. 2, D and F). Similar results were obtained for E651Q (TableI). In contrast, charge neutralization of Asp646 (D646N) generated channels that were significantly less sensitive to RR than wild type receptors (Fig.2 E). Whereas VR1 channels were blocked by 80% with 1 μm RR, capsaicin-elicited responses from D646N mutants were only reduced by 25%. Complete blockade of D646N channels required RR concentrations as high as 50 μm.Table IRuthenium red blockade efficacy of VR1 channelsSpeciespH 7.4pH 6.4IC50nIC50nμmμmVR10.14 ± 0.090.9 ± 0.101.3 ± 0.071.3 ± 0.1E636Q0.04 ± 0.010.7 ± 0.050.8 ± 0.201.0 ± 0.2D646N1.7 ± 0.201.6 ± 0.33.0 ± 0.401.7 ± 0.4E648Q0.25 ± 0.061.4 ± 0.31.5 ± 0.251.3 ± 0.3E651Q0.16 ± 0.031.1 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.231.1 ± 0.2M644Y0.20 ± 0.120.7 ± 0.1NDE636K/K639E0.17 ± 0.060.9 ± 0.08NDExperimental values were fitted to the logistic equationI blocker/I agonist = 1/(1+(blocker/IC50)n), where IC50 denotes the [blocker] to inhibit half of the maximal agonist response, andn is the steepness of the relationship.

E636K and D646K did not exhibit capsaicin-evoked ionic currents. Data are given as mean ± S.E., with N ≥ 3. ND, not determined. RR sensitivity of VR1 species was quantified from dose-response relationships (Fig. 3, top, and Table I). RR blocked VR1 wild type channels with an IC50 of 0.14 ± 0.09 μm and a steepness,n, of 0.9 ± 0.3. Neutralization of Glu648and Glu651 did not significantly alter RR blockade efficacy (IC50 = 0.25 ± 0.06 μm for E648Q, and IC50 = 0.16 ± 0.03 μm for E651Q). Replacement of E636 by glutamine, however, increased the RR blockade efficacy by ∼3-fold (IC50 = 0.04 ± 0.01 μm). In contrast, mutation of Asp646 to asparagine reduced RR sensitivity by ∼10-fold (IC50 = 1.7 ± 0.2 μm). These data suggest that Asp646 is a molecular determinant of RR sensitivity and that the residue at position 636 modulates pore blockade. Replacement of the acidic residues by lysine at these positions (E636K and D646K) or simultaneous neutralization of both residues, E636Q/D646N, did not produce functional capsaicin-operated channels, precluding a detailed study of the functional interplay of these two protein positions. The stability of a complex between RR and pore acidic residues will be determined by their degree of protonation and the spatial arrangement of carboxylic groups. Accordingly, protonation of acidic groups involved in RR binding should weaken its blockade efficacy. We tested this prediction by obtaining the RR inhibition efficacy for all VR1 species at acidic extracellular pH (pHo). As illustrated in Fig. 3 (bottom), VR1 wild type and E636Q, E648Q, and E651Q mutant receptors exhibited ⩾10-fold lower sensitivity to RR blockade at pHo 6.4 (Table I) as compared with the neutral pHo 7.4. In marked contrast, extracellular acidification reduced by only 2-fold RR blockade efficacy of D646N mutants (Table I and Fig. 3, bottom). These observations suggest that carboxylate groups involved in RR binding become protonated at pHo 6.4, resulting in a reduced RR blocking sensitivity. That carboxylate groups exhibit rather neutral pK a values is not surprising, since pK a of acidic groups buried inside proteins can vary several units depending on the dielectric environment (25Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. Freeman & Co., New York1985Google Scholar), as evidenced for Ca2+ channels and cyclic GMP-gated channels (26Seifert R. Eismann E. Ludwing J. Baumann A. Kaupp U.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Klöckner Mikala G. Schwartz A. Varady G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22293-22296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These studies could not be carried out at pHo ≤6.0 because we observed activation of endogenous currents that were insensitive to RR. Collectively, these results imply that protonation of acidic residues implicated in RR binding modulates blockade efficacy. The observation that RR inhibition of D646N channels is largely insensitive to pHo acidification supports the notion that this residue is a structural determinant of the high affinity RR binding site. The 2-fold reduction of RR inhibition efficacy observed in the D646N mutant may result from the reported strong delocalization in the amide group of asparagine that makes this group capable of associating with protons and possibly with cations (28Bash, H., and Tora, H. (1992) The Chemistry of Acid Derivatives, Suppl. B, Vol. 2, pp. 1–50, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.Google Scholar, 29Zalaweski, R. I. (1992) The Chemistry of Acid Derivatives, Suppl. B, Vol. 2, pp. 305–369, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.Google Scholar). Alternatively, an electrostatic influence exerted by the three other neighboring glutamate residues can not be ruled out. Since Asp646 appears to be an important structural determinant of VR1 channel blockade, it is conceivable that this residue also contributes to define the ionic permeability, especially to divalent cations. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the relative ionic permeability of wild type and D646N mutant channels. We focused on Mg2+ for two reasons: (a) Mg2+ is not an activator of the endogenous calcium-activated chloride conductance (24Miledi R. Parker I. J. Physiol. 1985; 357: 173-183Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar); and (b) at variance with Ca2+, Mg2+ does not block nor desensitize VR1 channels at millimolar concentrations. Indeed, attempts to measure the relative Ca2+ permeability failed due to the large blockade and desensitization of VR1 channels provoked by this cation, consistent with previous observations (1Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6985) Google Scholar, 2Tominaga M. Caterina M.J. Malmberg A.B. Rosen T.A. Gilvert H.

Capsaicin-evoked ionic currents from VR1 wild type channels in the presence of [Ca2+]o ≥ 1 mm were ≤10 nA, preventing the accurate measurement of reversal potentials. For VR1 wild type channels, I-V relationships obtained at low [sodium]o (20 mm) and 1 mmMgCl2 are fairly linear, with a slight inward rectification at negative membrane potentials, and exhibit a reversal potential (V r) of −36 ± 3 mV (Fig.4 A). A 10-fold increase in [Mg2+]o shifted the reversal potential up to 25 mV toward more depolarizing potentials (Fig. 4 A), indicating that VR1 channels are permeable to Mg2+. Mutation of Asp646 to asparagine slightly affected the I-V characteristics but significantly altered the permeability to Mg2+ (Fig. 4 B). As shown, a 10-fold increase in [Mg2+]o moved V r ∼10 mV toward positive potentials. This displacement ofV r was 15 mV smaller than that observed for VR1 channels, suggesting that the D646N mutant receptor exhibits lower permeability to Mg2+. At variance with the D646N mutant, neutralization of the other negatively charged residues did not significantly affect the apparent Mg2+ permeability, as evidenced by the similar shift in V r consequent to changing the extracellular ionic conditions (TableII). Analysis of I-V relationships obtained varying the [Na+]osuggested that the permeability to monovalent cations was unaffected by the mutations (Table II).Table IIReversal potentials of VR1 mutantsSpeciesV rΔV r125 mm = Na, 2 mm Mg20 mm = Na, 2 mm Mg20 mm = Na, 5 mm MgΔ [Na+]oΔ [Mg2+]omVmVVR16 ± 4−30 ± 5−20 ± 13610E636Q4 ± 3−31 ± 6−21 ± 43510D646N−2 ± 4−33 ± 3−29 ± 331 4 2-ap < 0.05.E648Q7 ± 5−28 ± 4−19 ± 335 9E651Q3 ± 4−36 ± 5−24 ± 43912M644Y1 ± 2−26 ± 2−19 ± 227 7 2-ap < 0.05.E636K/K639E3 ± 1−31 ± 3−22 ± 2349Reversal potentials (V r) were obtained fromI-V relationships as the voltage at which the capsaicin-evoked ionic current was zero.

Here we examine the mechanism by which the activation of β-adrenergic receptor induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and DNA ladder analyses revealed that isoproterenol (Iso) induced the apoptosis of cardiac myocytes of neonatal rats through an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels. The Iso-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis was strongly inhibited by the L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist nifedipine and by the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A and FK506. Iso reduced the phosphorylation levels of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bad and induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol through calcineurin activation. Infusion of Iso increased calcineurin activity by ∼3-fold in the hearts of wild-type mice but not in the hearts of transgenic mice that overexpress dominant negative mutants of calcineurin. Terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling analysis revealed that infusion of Iso induced apoptosis of cardiac myocytes and that the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes was significantly less in the hearts of the transgenic mice compared with the wild-type mice.

Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar), it remains unknown whether calcineurin is involved in β-adrenergic stimulation-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis.DISCUSSIONMany lines of evidence have suggested that activation of the sympathetic nervous system is observed in patients with heart failure and exerts deleterious effects on human hearts (7Hasking G.J. Esler M.D. Jennings G. Burton D. Johns J.A. Korner P.I. Circulation. 1986; 73: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 26Swedberg K. Viquerat C. Rouleau J.L. Roizen M. Atherton B.

Cardiol. 1985; 17: 291-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Activation of the sympathetic nervous system provides the rationale for the use of β-adrenergic receptor antagonists to treat heart failure. In fact, therapeutic interventions by β-adrenergic receptor antagonists not only improve cardiac contractility but also improve the prognosis of heart failure (28Doughty R.N. McMahon S. Sharpe N. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1994; 23: 814-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Newton G.E. Parker J.D. Circulation. 1996; 94: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30Yoshikawa T. Handa S. Anzai T. Nishimura H. Baba A. Akaisi M. Mitamura H. Ogawa S. Am. Heart J. 1996; 131: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the mechanism by which β-adrenergic stimulation induces injury of cardiomyocytes.Apoptosis has been demonstrated to occur in the myocardium in a variety of pathological situations. The number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes is increased in the myocardium obtained from heart failure patients (1Narula J.N. Haider N. Virmani R. DiSalvo T.G. Kolodgie F.D. Hajjar R.J. Schmidt U. Semigran M.J. Dec G.W. Khaw B.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1182-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar,2Olivetti G. Abbi R. Quaini F. Kajstura J. Cheng W. Nitahara J.A. Quaini E.

Furthermore, prominent cardiomyocyte apoptosis was observed in the hearts of transgenic mice overexpressing GTP-binding proteins α, which transmit signals from β-adrenergic receptors to adenylyl cyclase, and treatment with β-adrenergic receptor antagonists prevented cardiomyocyte apoptosis in mice (31Asai K. Yang G.P. Geng Y.J. Takagi G. Bishop S. Ishikawa Y. Shannon R.P. Wagner T.E. Vatner D.E. Homcy C.J. Vatner S.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that β-adrenergic stimulation may induce deterioration of cardiac function by inducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis during the development of heart failure. Stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors activates adenylate cyclase, which increases intracellular cAMP. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase A activates L-type Ca2+ channels, leading to a significant increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels. In the present study, Iso increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells. A calcium ionophore, ionomycin, which causes a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+concentration, increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells as much as did maximum Iso stimulation. Pretreatment with the L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist nifedipine and the selective calcineurin inhibitors CsA and FK506 strongly inhibited the Iso-induced increase in TUNEL-positive cells and Iso-induced DNA ladder formation. Taken together, these results suggest that the Ca2+-calcineurin pathway plays a critical role in β-adrenergic receptor-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis.The Bcl-2 family proteins are important regulators of cell death in mammalian cells. Apoptosis is determined by the relative balance between proapoptotic molecules such as Bad and Bax and antiapoptotic molecules such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Phosphorylated Bad is sequestered in the cytosol by 14–3-3 proteins and is inactivated, thus promoting cell survival. Dephosphorylated Bad promotes cell death at least in part through heterodimerization with the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. The present study demonstrated that Iso as well as a calcium ionophore transiently reduced phosphorylation levels of Bad and that Iso-induced dephosphorylation of Bad was abolished when the Ca2+-calcineurin pathway was inhibited by calcineurin inhibitors and an L-type Ca2+channel antagonist. Furthermore, we examined the subcellular distribution of cytochrome c in cardiomyocytes in the presence or absence of Iso. Iso significantly induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, and the Iso-induced release of cytochrome c was reduced by pretreatment with calcineurin inhibitors. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL function in the mitochondrial membrane as antiapoptotic molecules by preventing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (24Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). When Bad is dephosphorylated and translocated from the cytosol to mitochondria, Bad has been reported to form a complex with Bcl-2 and induce the release of cytochrome c (14Wang H. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). These results and observations collectively suggest that calcineurin plays an important role in the Iso-induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, possibly through dephosphorylating Bad in cardiac myocytes.It has been reported that the calcineurin inhibitors prevent the development of cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy in rodent models (32Sussman M.A. Lim H.W. Gude N. Taigen T. Olson E.N. Robbins J. Colbert M.C. Gualberto A. Wieczorek D.F. Molkentin J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In the present study, to elucidate whether calcineurin is involved in the apoptosis of cardiac myocytes in vivo, we generated dn calcineurin transgenic mice under the control of cardiac myocyte-specific α-myosin heavy chain promoter. It has been reported that transfected ΔCnA induces the redistribution of Bad from the cytosol to mitochondria and the translocation of another calcineurin substrate, nuclear factor of activated T cells, from the cytosol to the nucleus. In contrast, dn calcineurin, a trans-dominant inhibitory mutant of calcineurin, prevented the Ca2+-induced redistribution of Bad and nuclear factor of activated T cells and reduced apoptosis, indicating that dn calcineurin was effectively suppressing endogenous calcineurin function (14Wang H. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Infusion of Iso increased the calcineurin activity and the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the heart. Iso-induced increases in the number of TUNEL-positive cells as well as in calcineurin activity were significantly less in the hearts of the transgenic mice or FK506-treated mice than in the hearts of wild-type mice. These results suggest that stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors also induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis through calcineurin in vivo.Our results collectively suggest that the Ca2+-calcineurin pathway plays a critical role in the progression of heart failure by regulating cardiomyocyte apoptosis and that inhibition of the Ca2+-calcineurin pathway may be effective in the treatment of heart failure. To the contrary, De Windt et al. (33De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Taigen T. Wencker D. Condorelli G. Dorn G.W., II Kitsis R.N. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) recently reported that calcineurin activation prevents apoptosis of cardiac myocytes and that calcineurin transgenic mice hearts significantly increased TUNEL-positive cells of non-cardiomyocytes but not of cardiomyocytes. The reason for the discrepancy is unknown at present; however, it may come from the different stimuli. De Windtet al. (33De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Taigen T. Wencker D. Condorelli G. Dorn G.W., II Kitsis R.N. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) have reported that the activation of calcineurin protects cardiomyocytes against apoptosis induced by 2-deoxyglucose and staurosporine in vitro and by ischemia/reperfusion in vivo. We also observed that ischemia/reperfusion induced more apoptosis in the hearts of transgenic mice expressing dn calcineurin than in the hearts of wild-type mice. 2Y. Zou and I. Komuro, unpublished observation. It has been reported that calcineurin can activate opposing pathways that either suppress or induce apoptosis in the same cells (34Lotem J. Kama R. Sachs L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12016-12020Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Further studies are necessary to elucidate in what situations calcineurin induces or suppresses cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Heart failure is the final clinical manifestation of a variety of human heart diseases, including idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and coronary artery disease. In these pathologic conditions, cardiomyocytes undergo apoptosis, and a loss of cardiomyocytes is postulated to cause heart failure (1Narula J.N. Haider N. Virmani R. DiSalvo T.G. Kolodgie F.D. Hajjar R.J. Schmidt U. Semigran M.J. Dec G.W. Khaw B.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1182-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 2Olivetti G. Abbi R. Quaini F. Kajstura J. Cheng W.

However, the mechanism by which cardiomyocytes fall into apoptosis is still unknown. Recently, accumulating evidence has suggested that various factors such as angiotensin II, tumor necrosis factor-α, and oxidative stress induce apoptosis of cardiac myocytes (4Leri A. Claudio P.P.

An adrenergic receptor agonist, norepinephrine, has been reported to be elevated in the plasma of heart failure patients (7Hasking G.J. Esler M.D. Jennings G. Burton D. Johns J.A. Korner P.I. Circulation. 1986; 73: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar) and to induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis (8Communal C. Singh K. Pimentel D.R. Colucci W.S.

Circulation. 1999; 100: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that isoproterenol (Iso)1 induces apoptosis of cardiac myocytes in vivo through β-adrenergic receptors (10Shizukuda Y. Buttrick P.M. Geenen D.L. Borczuk A.C. Kitsis R.N. Sonnenblick E.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H961-H968PubMed Google Scholar) and that norepinephrine-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis is suppressed by protein kinase A inhibitors (8Communal C. Singh K.

Selective overexpression of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins α, which transmit signals from β-adrenergic receptors to adenylyl cyclase, has also been reported to induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis in transgenic mice hearts (11Geng Y. Ishikawa Y. Vatner D.E. Wagner T.E. Bishop S.P. Vatner S.F. Homcy C.J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These results suggest that activation of protein kinase A through β-adrenergic receptors induces apoptosis of cardiac myocytes during the development of heart failure. Activation of β-adrenergic receptors increases intracellular Ca2+ levels through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ has been reported to induce apoptosis in some cell types through activation of a Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (12Shibasaki F. McKeon F. J.

Furthermore, we examined the subcellular distribution of cytochrome c in cardiomyocytes in the presence or absence of Iso. Iso significantly induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, and the Iso-induced release of cytochrome c was reduced by pretreatment with calcineurin inhibitors. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL function in the mitochondrial membrane as antiapoptotic molecules by preventing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (24Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). When Bad is dephosphorylated and translocated from the cytosol to mitochondria, Bad has been reported to form a complex with Bcl-2 and induce the release of cytochrome c (14Wang H. Pathan N.

These results and observations collectively suggest that calcineurin plays an important role in the Iso-induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, possibly through dephosphorylating Bad in cardiac myocytes. It has been reported that the calcineurin inhibitors prevent the development of cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy in rodent models (32Sussman M.A. Lim H.W. Gude N. Taigen T. Olson E.N.

In the present study, to elucidate whether calcineurin is involved in the apoptosis of cardiac myocytes in vivo, we generated dn calcineurin transgenic mice under the control of cardiac myocyte-specific α-myosin heavy chain promoter. It has been reported that transfected ΔCnA induces the redistribution of Bad from the cytosol to mitochondria and the translocation of another calcineurin substrate, nuclear factor of activated T cells, from the cytosol to the nucleus. In contrast, dn calcineurin, a trans-dominant inhibitory mutant of calcineurin, prevented the Ca2+-induced redistribution of Bad and nuclear factor of activated T cells and reduced apoptosis, indicating that dn calcineurin was effectively suppressing endogenous calcineurin function (14Wang H. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Infusion of Iso increased the calcineurin activity and the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the heart. Iso-induced increases in the number of TUNEL-positive cells as well as in calcineurin activity were significantly less in the hearts of the transgenic mice or FK506-treated mice than in the hearts of wild-type mice. These results suggest that stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors also induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis through calcineurin in vivo. Our results collectively suggest that the Ca2+-calcineurin pathway plays a critical role in the progression of heart failure by regulating cardiomyocyte apoptosis and that inhibition of the Ca2+-calcineurin pathway may be effective in the treatment of heart failure. To the contrary, De Windt et al. (33De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Taigen T. Wencker D. Condorelli G. Dorn G.W., II Kitsis R.N. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) recently reported that calcineurin activation prevents apoptosis of cardiac myocytes and that calcineurin transgenic mice hearts significantly increased TUNEL-positive cells of non-cardiomyocytes but not of cardiomyocytes. The reason for the discrepancy is unknown at present; however, it may come from the different stimuli. De Windtet al. (33De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Taigen T. Wencker D. Condorelli G. Dorn G.W., II Kitsis R.N. Molkentin J.D. Circ.

We also observed that ischemia/reperfusion induced more apoptosis in the hearts of transgenic mice expressing dn calcineurin than in the hearts of wild-type mice. 2Y. Zou and I. Komuro, unpublished observation. It has been reported that calcineurin can activate opposing pathways that either suppress or induce apoptosis in the same cells (34Lotem J. Kama R. Sachs L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12016-12020Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Further studies are necessary to elucidate in what situations calcineurin induces or suppresses cardiomyocyte apoptosis."

In FcεRI-stimulated mast cells, the total Syk tyrosine phosphorylation paralleled the phosphorylation of its activation loop tyrosines and downstream propagation of signals for histamine release. In contrast, the cell surface binding of anti-ganglioside monoclonal antibody AA4 induced only strong general tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and minimal histamine release and weak phosphorylation of activation loop tyrosines.

The signal transduction pathway initiated by this receptor has many similarities to those of antigen receptors on T or B cells.

In these Syk-deficient cells, antigen stimulation does not induce cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation, calcium mobilization, or degranulation, and these defects are reconstituted by the expression of Syk. Syk family tyrosine kinases are also important for signaling from other immunoreceptors such as the Fcγ receptors and T or B cell receptors (23Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T.

Phosphopeptide mapping has identified 10 tyrosine residues in Syk that are autophosphorylated after an in vitro kinase reaction (29Furlong M.T. Mahrenholz A.M. Kim K.H. Ashendel C.L. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 1997; 1355: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at these tyrosine residues may provide binding sites for substrates or may be important for regulating the catalytic activity of Syk. Indeed, phosphorylation of Tyr317 of Syk negatively down-regulates signal transduction in mast cells, probably by a pathway that involves Cbl, a negative regulator of protein tyrosine kinases (30Lupher Jr., M.L.

Similarly, the tyrosine residues in the activation loop of Syk (Tyr519 and Tyr520 in rat Syk) are essential for propagating downstream signaling events (34Kurosaki T. Johnson S.A. Pao L. Sada K. Yamamura H. Cambier J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 35El-Hillal O. Kurosaki T. Yamamura H. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation is a critical feature for regulating Syk enzymatic activity and for its function. Structural studies suggest that activation loop tyrosines are important for regulating the enzymatic activity of many kinases. In the nonactivated state, these tyrosines occupy the catalytic center and hinder ATP and/or substrate binding. Phosphorylation of one or both of the tyrosines induces a conformational change that moves the loop out of the catalytic site, thereby allowing the binding of ATP and/or substrate. Therefore, the phosphorylation of these activation loop tyrosines is thought to regulate enzymatic activation. The crystal structure of the enzymatic domain of Syk or ZAP70 has not been established, although data suggest that a similar model also applies to these kinases. For example, mutants of Syk with the activation loop tyrosines mutated fail to signal from antigen receptors although there is no loss of in vitro enzymatic activity (34Kurosaki T. Johnson S.A. Pao L. Sada K. Yamamura H. Cambier J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 36Zhang J. Kimura T. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4366-4374PubMed Google Scholar). There are still unresolved questions in understanding the relationship of Syk tyrosine phosphorylation with its function. For example, in the RBL-2H3 mast cell line both FcεRI stimulation and the cell surface binding of anti-ganglioside mAb AA4 induce similar levels of Syk tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the response of the cell to these two stimulants is dramatically different. Whereas FcεRI aggregation results in degranulation, mAb AA4 binding induces only minor, if any, histamine release (37Swaim W.D. Minoguchi K. Oliver C. Hamawy M.M. Kihara H. Stephan V. Berenstein E.H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19466-19473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, examination of the phosphorylation of individual tyrosine residues will be necessary to better understand the function of Syk and the signal transduction pathways. In the present study, a polyclonal antibody was developed that specifically detected the phosphorylation of the Syk activation loop tyrosines. This antibody, in combination with synthetic phosphopeptides, can distinguish the phosphorylation status of each of the two adjacent tyrosine residues. We compared the FcεRI- and mAb AA4-induced histamine release with the total and activation loop tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk. The results demonstrate that Syk activation loop tyrosine phosphorylation is directly related to the capacity of Syk to propagate downstream intracellular signals. Our experiments also suggest that, in vivo, both tyrosine residues in the Syk activation loop were phosphorylated after FcεRI stimulation. Furthermore, Syk kinase activity played the major role in phosphorylating these two tyrosines. Triton X-100 and protein A-agarose beads were obtained from Sigma. The materials for electrophoresis were from Novex (San Diego, CA). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G-10 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-ganglioside monoclonal antibody AA4, mouse and rabbit anti-Syk antibody, and other materials not indicated were as described previously (21Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 38Basciano L.K. Berenstein E.H. Kmak L. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11823-11831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-Syk antibody was raised to a sequence in the linker region between the second SH2 domain and the kinase region and has been characterized previously (8Benhamou M. Ryba N.J.P. Kihara H. Nishikata H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23318-23324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized using a Milligen model 9500 peptide synthesizer. The parent peptide NH2-ALRADENYYKAQTHGC-COOH, corresponding to the activation loop of rat Syk amino acid sequence 512–526, was made using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbony chemistry, with a cysteine COOH-terminal resin. For mono- and diphosphorylated peptides, a phosphorylated derivative of tyrosine was used instead of Tyr. Rabbits were immunized with the conjugate of the diphosphorylated peptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma) via the COOH-terminal cysteine residue usingm-maleimido-benzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide as a cross-linking reagent. The phosphopeptide-specific sera were purified by negative absorption with CH-Sepharose affinity beads containing the native, nonphosphorylated peptide. Rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells, Syk-negative variant TB1A2 cells, and their wild-type or activation loop tyrosine mutant transfectants (Y519F mutant, Y520F mutant, and Y519F/Y520F mutant) have been described previously (21Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 36Zhang J. Kimura T. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4366-4374PubMed Google Scholar). A point mutation of Lys396 to Arg (dead kinase) was prepared by using a polymerase chain reaction-based method and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The dead kinase cDNA was cloned into pSVL expression vector and stably expressed in Syk-negative TB1A2 cells as described previously (21Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). For FcεRI activation, the monolayers were cultured overnight either without or with antigen-specific IgE. The cells cultured with IgE were stimulated with the antigen at concentrations from 0.01 to 1.0 μg/ml. In some experiments, cells cultured without IgE were stimulated with different concentrations of AA4 antibody. After stimulation for the indicated times, the supernatants were removed for histamine analysis. For pervanadate stimulation, cells cultured without IgE were stimulated with 0.4 mm pervanadate for 30 min at 37 °C. After stimulation, the cell monolayers were rinsed with ice-cold PBS containing 2 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 90 milliunits/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml pepstatin) and solubilized in Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF plus protease inhibitors and Na3VO4). The postnuclear supernatants were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Syk antibody bound to protein A-agarose beads. After rotation at 4 °C for 1 h, the beads were washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer as described previously (11Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22427-22432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blots were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10, anti-Syk activation loop phosphotyrosine antibody (anti-phospho-AL-Syk), or mouse anti-Syk antibody. In all blots, proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance). Syk immunoprecipitated from nonstimulated cells was further washed with kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm MnCl2) and resuspended in 25 μl of this kinase buffer. The kinase reactions were at 4 °C with 5 μm ATP and with or without diphosphorylated γ-ITAM peptide in the reaction solution. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 10 min. The eluted proteins were separated under reducing conditions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrotransferred to membranes, and blotted by anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10, anti-phospho-AL-Syk, or mouse anti-Syk antibody. In all blots, proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance). To examine the function of tyrosine phosphorylation of the Syk activation loop, we generated an antibody against a phosphopeptide based on the activation loop sequence. The serum was adsorbed by the corresponding nonphosphorylated peptide to deplete antibodies reactive with the native activation loop tyrosines. The specificity of the antibody was tested using Syk-negative mast cells reconstituted with wild type or activation loop mutant forms of Syk (21Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 36Zhang J. Kimura T. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4366-4374PubMed Google Scholar). These different forms of Syk had the two tyrosines in the putative activation loop (tyrosine residues 519 and 520 of the rat sequence) mutated to phenylalanine either singly or in combination (Y519F mutant, Y520F mutant, and Y519F/Y520F mutant). The different cell lines were treated with pervanadate to induce maximum tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Syk was then immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with a rabbit antibody that binds a sequence in the linker region of Syk. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with either mAb 4G10 that binds general phosphotyrosine residues or with the specific anti-Syk activation loop phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig.1 A). The different forms of Syk from the pervanadate treated cells gave a strong phosphorylation signal with anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody. In contrast, with the anti-phospho-AL-Syk antibody a strong signal was observed only with the wild-type Syk, while the Y519F and Y520F mutant proteins gave positive but weaker signals, and there was no signal with the Y519F/Y520F mutant. As expected, the anti-phospho-AL-Syk did not react with the nonphosphorylated Syk. Therefore, this antibody is phosphospecific for the activation loop tyrosines of Syk and does not bind to the native molecule or other phosphotyrosyl residues in Syk.Figure 1Specificity of the Syk activation loop phosphospecific antibody. A Syk-negative mast cell line stably transfected with wild type or the different Syk mutants was either not stimulated or stimulated with pervanadate for 30 min. Syk was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Syk, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblot analysis. A, immuno-blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Anti-PY), anti-phospho- AL-Syk, or anti-Syk antibody. B, immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Anti-PY), anti-phospho-AL-Syk, and anti-phospho-AL-Syk in the presence of the synthetic peptide with either the first (pYY) or the second (YpY) tyrosine phosphorylated. The peptides were used at 0.025 nm. The different forms of Syk in these cells are as follows: wild-type (WT), Y519F (FY), Y520F (YF), and Y519F/Y520F (FF) mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Synthetic phosphorylated peptides with the same backbone as that used for immunization were then used to determine whether the anti-phospho-AL-Syk antibody could distinguish the phosphorylation of each of the two adjacent tyrosines in the activation loop (Fig.1 B). These phosphopeptides with either the first or the second tyrosine phosphorylated rendered the antibody specific to the reciprocal site. For example, when a peptide with the first tyrosine phosphorylated was added to the anti-phospho-AL-Syk antibody, there was a signal only when the second tyrosine of the activation loop was phosphorylated. These experiments demonstrate that anti-phospho-AL-Syk specifically detects the phosphorylation status of both activation loop tyrosines of Syk. A puzzling aspect of mast cell signal transduction is that some cell stimulants, such as the anti-cell surface ganglioside mAb AA4, induce strong tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins including Syk, but not histamine release (37Swaim W.D.

To investigate whether this is related to differences in the phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosines, RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated by either IgE plus specific antigen or by mAb AA4 (Fig.2). As had been observed previously (37Swaim W.D. Minoguchi K. Oliver C. Hamawy M.M. Kihara H. Stephan V. Berenstein E.H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19466-19473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by using anti-general phosphotyrosine antibodies, both FcεRI-stimulation and mAb AA4 binding resulted in strong tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk. However, immunoblotting with anti-phospho-AL-Syk and analysis of histamine release detected marked differences with these two stimulants. Receptor aggregation with IgE plus antigen induced strong phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosines and dramatic histamine release, while mAb AA4 binding only stimulated minor Syk activation loop tyrosine phosphorylation and minimal histamine release. To further confirm the relationship between Syk activation loop tyrosine phosphorylation and cell degranulation, RBL-2H3 cells were incubated with different concentrations of antigen or AA4 antibody, and histamine release, the total Syk and activation loop tyrosine phosphorylation determined (Fig.3). The results were similar; after IgE plus antigen stimulation, there was histamine release together with strong tyrosine phosphorylation signals of both whole Syk and the activation loop tyrosines. In contrast, mAb AA4 binding induced only strong tyrosine phosphorylation for whole Syk. These experiments suggest that, compared with total Syk tyrosine phosphorylation, the activation loop tyrosine phosphorylation is a better indicator for Syk functional activation that leads to degranulation. We then examined the role of Syk itself in the phosphorylation of its activation loop tyrosines. Syk was immunoprecipitated from nonstimulated RBL-2H3 cells and subjected to anin vitro kinase assay with or without diphosphorylated γ-ITAM peptide (Fig. 4). As reported previously, the immunoprecipitated Syk from these quiescent cells was not tyrosine-phosphorylated but had intrinsic kinase activity, which was enhanced by the addition of diphosphorylated γ-ITAM peptide (15Kimura T. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1471-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with anti-phospho-AL-Syk indicated that Syk was able to phosphorylate its own activation loop tyrosines in the absence of other kinases. The addition of diphosphorylated γ-ITAM enhanced this function. Therefore, Syk is capable of phosphorylating its activation loop tyrosines in vitro. To further define the role of Syk for the in vivophosphorylation of its own activation loop tyrosine, cells expressing wild-type Syk or kinase-dead Syk were stimulated with IgE plus specific antigen (Fig. 5). Since the extent of the tyrosine phosphorylation of kinase-dead Syk was low, we used different amounts of the cell lysates in the immunoblots to estimate the level of phosphorylation. The receptor-induced total phosphorylation of kinase-dead Syk was approximately 20% as much as that of wild type Syk; however, the activation loop tyrosine phosphorylation of kinase-dead Syk showed a more dramatic decrease (less than 10% of wild type). Therefore, in mast cells Syk plays the major role in the receptor-induced phosphorylation of its own activation loop tyrosines, while other kinases, such as Lyn, probably make minor contributions to this phosphorylation. One of the differences between Syk and ZAP70 is that each of the two adjacent tyrosines in the activation loop of Syk is essential for propagation of receptor-induced signaling (36Zhang J. Kimura T. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4366-4374PubMed Google Scholar, 39Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18730-18733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In the present study, we noticed that after pervanadate stimulation, the 519 and 520 tyrosine residues of Syk were both phosphorylated (Fig.1 B). We then investigated the FcεRI-induced phosphorylation of the two activation loop tyrosines in wild-type Syk. After IgE plus antigen stimulation, Syk was immunoprecipitated from RBL-2H3 cells and analyzed by blotting with anti-phospho-AL-Syk antibody in the presence or absence of phosphopeptides to render it site-specific (Fig. 6). Both 519pY and 520pY peptides obviously inhibited the activation loop tyrosine phosphorylation signal. The inhibition with the two peptides demonstrates that after receptor aggregation both tyrosine residues in the activation loop are phosphorylated. To study the mechanism of Syk regulation by phosphorylation, an antibody was developed that was specific for the phosphorylated tyrosines in the activation loop of Syk. By using this antibody, we found that both tyrosine residues at the Syk activation loop were phosphorylated in vivo. Syk played a major role in phosphorylating these tyrosines. In antigen-stimulated cells the FcεRI-induced phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosines paralleled the total Syk phosphorylation, and both correlated with downstream propagation of signals for histamine release. However, the cell surface binding of anti-ganglioside mAb AA4 induced only strong total Syk tyrosine phosphorylation, minimal histamine release and weak phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosines. Although Syk and ZAP70 belong to the same tyrosine kinase family and have many functional and structural similarities, there are differences in their signaling capacity and the mechanism of their regulation (41Couture C. Williams S. Gauthier N. Tailor P. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 42Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W.G. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 145-154PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of Syk can be induced by binding to phosphorylated ITAM, while ZAP70 requires additional stimulatory input from Lck (13Rowley R.B.

In the Jurkat T cell line, Syk, but not ZAP70, can transduce T cell receptor signals independent of CD45 and of Lck (47Chu D.H. Spits H. Peyron J.F. Rowley R.B. Bolen J.B. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6251-6261Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Similarly, in a Syk and CD45 double deficient mast cell line, the expression of Syk but not ZAP70 reconstitutes FcεRI signaling (48Zhang J. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2508-2516PubMed Google Scholar). In the in vitro experiments, we found that Syk phosphorylated its activation loop tyrosines probably by a trans-phosphorylation reaction. The addition of diphosphorylated ITAM peptides to immunoprecipitated Syk enhanced the rate of this phosphorylation. The results from the in vivo study also support this model. In FcεRI-activated cells, there was strong phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosines of wild type Syk but only minimal phosphorylation at this site of the kinase-inactive Syk. Altogether, these results suggest that Syk plays a major role in phosphorylating its activation loop tyrosines, while other kinases, such as Lyn, are playing a minor contribution in this process (10Kurosaki T. Takata M. Yamanashi Y. Inazu T. Taniguchi T. Yamamoto T. Yamamura H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the activation loop tyrosines of ZAP70 and Syk have demonstrated another difference between these two kinases. For ZAP70, mutation of the first activation loop tyrosine to Phe increasesin vitro kinase activity and enhances the in vivoactivation signal in a Syk-negative avian B cell line, whereas ZAP70 with a mutation of the second tyrosine has normal enzymatic activity but cannot transmit antigen-receptor signaling (39Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 40Wange R.L. Guitian R. Isakov N. Watts J.D. Aebersold R.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation of either one of these two tyrosines in Syk results in a loss of its capacity to function in the IgE-receptor signaling pathway, although the mutations have no effect on in vitroenzymatic activity (36Zhang J. Kimura T. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4366-4374PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that in normal RBL-2H3 cells, both tyrosines of the activation loop were phosphorylated after IgE receptor stimulation. Since in RBL-2H3 cells IgE plus antigen induced more than 60% histamine release, it appears unlikely that the phosphorylation of any one tyrosine of the activation loop plays an inhibitory role in propagating degranulation. Therefore, this observation supported the results of functional studies of Syk activation loop mutants in which it was found that if either one of the tyrosines was mutated there was loss of the signal for degranulation. Syk contains multiple tyrosine residues, 10 of which are autophosphorylated in vitro (29Furlong M.T. Mahrenholz A.M. Kim K.H. Ashendel C.L. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 1997; 1355: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of these different tyrosines has demonstrated that several of these residues are important in up- or down-regulating Syk function. For example, the putative Cbl interaction site, Tyr317, negatively regulates Syk signaling (30Lupher Jr., M.L. Rao N. Lill N.L. Andoniou C.E. Miyake S. Clark E.A. Druker B. Band H. J. Biol.

Similarly, mutation of the three tyrosines at the COOH-terminal region of Syk results in a gain of function in T cell lines (49Zeitlmann L. Knorr T. Knoll M. Romeo C. Sirim P. Kolanus W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15445-15452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, Tyr519 and Tyr520 in the activation loop of Syk are essential for propagating IgE-induced signals for degranulation (34Kurosaki T. Johnson S.A. Pao L. Sada K. Yamamura H. Cambier J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 36Zhang J. Kimura T. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4366-4374PubMed Google Scholar). Since the total tyrosine phosphorylation of a molecule is the sum of the phosphorylation of such sites that have positive or negative functional effects, it is not surprising that strong tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk is not always a standard for downstream propagation of signals (37Swaim W.D. Minoguchi K. Oliver C. Hamawy M.M. Kihara H. Stephan V. Berenstein E.H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19466-19473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present experiments, we compared the FcεRI- and anti-ganglioside mAb AA4-induced histamine release to the total and activation loop tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk. We found that the phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosines but not the total phosphorylation of Syk correlates with antigen- or AA4-mediated degranulation. Therefore, phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosines rather than total phosphorylation is a better criterion for the functional activation of Syk. Although mAb AA4 induced minimal tyrosine phosphorylation of the activation loop, it resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of many cellular proteins (37Swaim W.D. Minoguchi K. Oliver C. Hamawy M.M. Kihara H. Stephan V. Berenstein E.H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19466-19473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, there is minimal FcεRI-induced phosphorylation of cellular proteins in cells in which Syk activation loop tyrosines cannot be phosphorylated because they are mutated to Phe. There are several possible reasons for this difference in total cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylations. These mAb AA4-induced phosphorylations, unlike those by receptor aggregation, may not be due to Syk but my instead result from activation of other kinases such as Lyn. In fact, the ganglioside recognized by mAb AA4 is in membrane rafts and closely associated with Lyn (37Swaim W.D. Minoguchi K. Oliver C. Hamawy M.M. Kihara H. Stephan V. Berenstein E.H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19466-19473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also possible that the low level phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosines in mAb AA4-stimulated cells may be enough to activate Syk to propagate downstream phosphorylation of proteins; however, this cannot occur in the activation loop mutated Syk. In both mAb AA4- and receptor-stimulated cells there was strong total phosphorylation of Syk, indicating that these stimuli result in differences in the ratio of the level of phosphorylation of tyrosines in the activation loop to other sites in the molecule. The ratio in the phosphorylation of different tyrosine residues that can either up- or down-regulate Syk function could then control downstream events. Both receptor aggregation and mAb AA4 induced strong tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and other cellular proteins although only IgE-antigen resulted in degranulation. Total cellular tyrosine phosphorylations do not always correlate with degranulation. For example, when doubly negative CD45−/−Syk−/− cells are transfected with ZAP70 there is minimal tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins without degranulation; the cotransfection with CD45 does not change this level of phosphorylation but results in degranulation (48Zhang J. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2508-2516PubMed Google Scholar). Another difference is that the rate of the total tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk is much slower with mAb AA4 than with receptor activation (Fig. 2). This may be critical for the organization of the complex of molecules that are important for signaling. As discussed above, the ratio in the phosphorylation of different tyrosines that can either activate or inhibit Syk function could regulate downstream signals for degranulation. In the in vitro kinase reaction, there was autophosphorylation of Syk including phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosines in the absence of any detectable Lyn. The binding of diphosphorylated ITAM results in a conformational change in Syk that stimulates kinase activity, thus increasing autophosphorylation (15Kimura T. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1471-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and the phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosines (Fig. 4). Conformational changes in the molecule may therefore make activation loop tyrosines accessible for transphosphorylation. In vivo,there was low level phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosines of the kinase-dead Syk, indicating the activity of another kinase, probably Lyn. These results suggest that Syk may be activated by several mechanisms that include conformational change due to ITAM binding, autophosphorylation, and phosphorylation by other kinases. In summary, a specific, anti-Syk activation loop phosphotyrosine antibody was generated. By using this antibody, we found that both of the tyrosines in the activation loop were phosphorylated following antigen stimulation. Syk played the major role in phosphorylating its activation loop tyrosines. In FcεRI-stimulated or anti-ganglioside mAb AA4-stimulated mast cells, only phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosines, but not the total Syk tyrosine phosphorylation, correlated with the functional response of degranulation. Therefore, the tyrosine phosphorylation of the activation loop rather than total phosphorylation of Syk is a better indicator of in vivo Syk functional activation.

In mammals, pineal melatonin production is elevated at night in response to sympathetic stimulation driven by a circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN1; see Ref. 12). Light acts through the retina to modulate SCN stimulation of the pineal gland.

A critical regulatory element of all melatonin rhythm-generating systems is the penultimate enzyme in the serotonin →N-acetylserotonin → melatonin pathway, AANAT (EC2.3.1.87). Large changes in the activity of this enzyme control large changes in the rate of production and circulating levels of melatonin. The regulatory mechanisms that control dynamic changes in melatonin production, including the circadian rhythm, act through AANAT, making this enzyme the molecular interface in vertebrates between photoneurochemical regulatory mechanisms and melatonin synthesis. A variety of AANAT regulatory systems and strategies has evolved (10Klein D.C. Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H. Weller J.L. Bernard M. Gastel J.A. Zatz M. Iuvone P.M. Rodriguez I.R. Begay V. Falcon J.

One of the most fascinating is the chicken pineal, in which the circadian rhythm in melatonin production in part reflects a circadian rhythm in AANAT mRNA (25Bernard M. Klein D.C. Zatz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this tissue there appears to be a close link between the circadian clock and the AANAT gene, as in the pike and zebrafish pineal gland (20Cahill G.M.

In these systems, a circadian rhythm in AANAT mRNA persists in constant lighting conditions in culture. A central issue in the field of circadian biology is defining the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian clocks. Molecular components that comprise these pacemakers have been identified in a diverse set of organisms including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the mouse, and a fungus (27Dunlap J.C.

In addition, another gene named MOP4 (alternatively termedNPAS2) has also been shown to interact with certain clock genes (28Hogenesch J.B. Gu Y.-Z. Jain S. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5474-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 29Kume K. Zylka M.J. Sriram S. Shearman L.P. Weaver D.R. Jin X. Maywood E.S. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M.

Based on these cross-species parallels, the mammalian genes were postulated to be components of an intracellular transcriptional/translational feedback loop (27Dunlap J.C.

The exact mechanism whereby the clock genes interact is still a matter of debate, and it is likely that additional components remain to be discovered. We have pursued the question of how the clock regulates AANAT expression in the chicken pineal gland by cloning and characterizing the 5′-flanking region of the cAANAT gene. Our data reveal that this region contains an E box element, which is closely associated with circadian gene expression in other systems (27Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar, 30Reppert S.M.

Our studies indicate that cAANAT transcription can be regulated via this DNA element, that homologs of mammalian clock genes, Clock,bmal1, and MOP4, are co-expressed in the chicken pineal gland and retina, and that BMAL1/CLOCK and BMAL1/MOP4 heterodimers bind to the E box element and enhance transcription. A chicken cosmid library subcloned into pWE 15 vector (Stratagene; a gift from Dr. Ignacio Rodriguez, NEI, National Institutes of Health) was screened with a random-primed32P-labeled full-length (1.4-kb) cAANAT cDNA probe. This identified four positive clones; the one (clone 76) with the largest 5′-flanking region was selected for further study. Plasmid DNA of clone 76 was prepared on Qiagen columns and digested withHindIII. An ∼6-kb fragment was gel-purified and subcloned into the phagemid vector pBluescript II SK(+) that has been cut withHindIII and dephosphorylated. A positive clone (2A76) was selected and used for subsequent experiments. One-day-old chicks (White Leghorn, Truslow Farms, Baltimore) were housed (for 10–11 days) in heated brooders on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (LD 12:12; lights on zeitgeber time (ZT) 0–12) with lights provided by cool white fluorescent tubes. Following this, the animals were released into either constant darkness (DD) or constant light (LL). Three chicks were sacrificed in DD every 4 h beginning at the second 24-h period. In LL experiments, three animals were sacrificed every 6 h. Dissection in “darkness” were performed under dim red light (Wratten number 92; <1 min from exposure to freezing of tissue). For cell culture experiments, animals were killed between ZT 6 and ZT 8. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The transcription start point(s) within the cAANAT gene was determined by S1 nuclease analysis (32Baler R. Covington S. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6979-6985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), using total RNA from nighttime (ZT 18) chicken pineal gland and retina as templates. A 32P-labeled single-stranded probe (481 nucleotides) was generated by asymmetric PCR using primers NAT 50 (5′-CATTACTTCTGCTGACCTTCC-3′) and NAT 27 (5′-TCCTCTCCAGCCTGATCCTG-3′; “driving” primer). The probe was gel-purified and added (60,000 cpm) to 30 μg of total RNA from pineal, retina, or transfer RNA (negative control), in 20 μl of S1 hybridization buffer (80% deionized formamide, 40 mm Pipes, pH 6.4, 400 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA). The mixtures were denatured and hybridized overnight at 44 °C. Samples were than digested with 40 units of S1 nuclease at 37 °C for 60 min. After ethanol precipitation, samples were boiled and electrophoresed on a 6% sequencing gel. A dideoxy nucleotide sequencing reaction of clone 76, primed with a 32P-end-labeled probe of NAT 27, was run in parallel for size comparison. Pineal glands were dissected from chicks at nighttime (ZT 18) and quick-frozen on solid CO2 dry ice. Crude cell extracts were prepared as described (32Baler R. Covington S. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6979-6985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and corrected for protein (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211925) Google Scholar). Aliquots were stored at −80 °C. For the initial screening of the cAANAT 5′-flanking region, T4 polynucleotide kinase was used to end label PCR fragments (∼80 to 300 bp) with 32P and used as probes. Binding reactions were conducted for 20 min at room temperature using 30,000 cpm of radiolabeled probe (∼2 fmol), 10 μg of cell extract, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), in a reaction volume of 20 μl. Where indicated, unlabeled DNA (200-fold molar excess) was added to the binding reaction as competitors and incubated with the extract for 15 min on ice prior to the addition of labeled probe. Complexes were resolved by electrophoresis at 4 °C on a 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gel equilibrated in 1× TGE buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA). Gels were dried; they were then imaged and analyzed using a STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Partial cDNAs of chicken bmal1, MOP4 , andClock were isolated by degenerate-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using chicken pineal cDNA as template and Ex-TaqDNA polymerase (Takara). Primers used were M3F1 (forward, 5′-AGAT(CT)GA(AG)AAGCGGCGTCGGGA-3′) and M3R1 (reverse, 5′-ACTCCTT(AG)AC(CT)TTG(GC)C(AT)AT(AG)TC-3′) for bmal1, and CKF1 (forward, 5′-GATTCCT(GT)AC(GC)AA(AG)GGCCA(AG)CAGTGGATATGG-3′) and CKR2 (reverse, 5′-CTGCTGTTGTTG(CT)TG(CT)TGTTGCTG-3′) forMOP4 and Clock. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 5 min and then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. PCRs were size-fractionated, and DNA fragments with the predicted size (384 bp for bmal1, approximately 1.2 kb for MOP4 and 490 bp forClock) were gel-purified and subcloned into the pGEMT-Easy vector (Promega). Plasmid DNA were made from positive bacterial colonies and sequenced. Subsequently, specific internal primers for chicken MOP4, M4F1 (forward, 5′-TGGAGAGGAGACAGGAGATG-3′) and M4R1 (reverse, 5′-GGTTGAGAAGGCAAGGAAG-3′) were used to amplify a fragment (333 bp) using chicken pineal cDNA, subcloned, and sequenced to confirm authenticity. The full-length cDNA of chickenbmal1 (GenBankTM accession number AF205219) andClock (GenBankTM accession number AF144425) was subsequently cloned by screening a chicken pineal cDNA library using the partial cDNA. Northern blot analysis was performed as described (34Chong N.W.S. Cassone V.M. Bernard M. Klein D.C. Iuvone P.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 61: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, a 20-μg sample of total RNA was prepared from a pool of three pineal glands or retinas and loaded on a 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gel. RNA was than transferred to a nylon membrane (Nytran, Schleicher & Schuell) by passive capillary blotting with 20× SSC. The transferred RNA was cross-linked to the membrane in an UV Stratalinker (Stratagene; 120 mJ, 35 s). Blots were probed with random-primed 32P-labeled cDNAs of chickenbmal1 (1.9 kb), MOP4 (1.2 kb), Clock(490 bp), and cAANAT (1.4-kb, see Ref. 35Bernard M. Iuvone P.M. Cassone V.M. Roseboom P.H. Coon S.L. Klein D.C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Data were normalized for variations in RNA loading and transfer efficiency, by probing with a 2-kb human β-actin cDNA (CLONTECH). All probes were hybridized at 68 °C in QuikHyb (Stratagene), and the final wash was at 60 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min. Hybridized blots were imaged and analyzed using a PhosphorImager. Transcript sizes were estimated by comparison with standard RNA markers (RNA Molecular Weight Marker I; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A luciferase reporter plasmid carrying the entire 5′-flanking region of the cAANAT gene was prepared using aHindIII/HindIII fragment generated from genomic clone 2A76 (35Bernard M. Iuvone P.M. Cassone V.M. Roseboom P.H. Coon S.L. Klein D.C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This fragment was gel-purified and partially digested with the restriction enzyme NcoI; the largest portion of the digest (∼4 kb; −3999 to +120) was gel-purified, blunt-ended with Klenow fragment, and subcloned into the SmaI site of the reporter vector pGL3-Basic (Promega). A series of 5′-deletions of the constructed plasmid (pGL3-Basic HindIII; −3999 to +120) was created using appropriate combinations of restriction enzymes, filled in, and religated; KpnI and EcoRI for pGL3-B 3136 (−3136 to +120), KpnI alone for pGL3-B 1981 (−1981 to +120), KpnI and NcoI for pGL3-B 1633 (−1633 to +120), KpnI and MluI for pGL3-B 1309 (−1309 to +120), and KpnI and NotI for pGL3-B 870 (−870 to +120). In other cases, the DNA fragments were obtained by PCR with ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara) and gel-purified. The ends of these DNA fragments were blunted with Klenow fragment and subcloned into the SmaI site of pGL3-Basic. pGL3-B 484 (−484 to +120) and pGL3-B 217 (−217 to +120) were achieved with this strategy. To generate E box (CACGTG; −49 to −44) deletion mutations, cAANAT-luciferase reporter plasmids were linearized withPmlI and treated with Klenow at 37 °C for 30 min. The digested plasmids were religated and used to transformEscherichia coli. Bacterial colonies were picked and subjected to PCR using appropriate primers upstream and downstream to this E box. PCRs were then digested with PmlI; successful mutations were DNA fragments that were resistant to PmlI digestion. Plasmid DNA were isolated from these positives and sequenced. The mutation analyzed in the present study had a “G” deletion (CACGTG → CAC*TG). For pGL3-TK, the thymidine kinase (TK) minimal promoter was excised from the luciferase vector, PRL-TK (Promega), with HindIII and BglII and gel-purified. This DNA fragment (760 bp) was inserted into the pGL3-Basic vector that has been cut with the same restriction enzymes. pGL3-TKNATE box4 was constructed using a sequence containing four 17-bp tandem repeats, each containing the E box with 7 bp of 5′- and 4 bp of 3′-flanking sequences (5′-ACTTCATCACGTGCTCC-3′). Supercoil plasmid DNAs was prepared on Qiagen columns. The correct orientations of all constructs were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. Full-length coding regions of chicken bmal1 and Clock were PCR-amplified from the original excised plasmid DNA using Expand DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and ligated into pcDNA3.1 V5-His expression vector (Invitrogen). Correct orientation of each construct was verified by sequence analysis. Human expression plasmids of BMAL1 (MOP3) and MOP4 were a gift from Dr. John Hogenesch and Dr. Chris Bradfield (University of Wisconsin Medical School), and the arginine vasopressin (AVP) E box luciferase reporter constructs and mouse CLOCK expression plasmid were provided by Dr. Steven Reppert (Harvard Medical School). Chicks were killed by decapitation, and the pineal glands were removed and chilled in sterile complete culture medium. Complete medium had the following composition: modified McCoy's 5A medium (catalog number 12330-031, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 25 mm Hepes buffer,l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin (Sigma), 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B (Sigma), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Primary cultures of dissociated chick pineal cells were prepared as described (36Barrett R.K. Takahashi J.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5681-5692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The dissociated cells were put through a cell strainer (70 μm; Falcon) and pelleted. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pelleted cells were resuspended in complete culture medium and plated in two wells of a 6-well plate (Costar Corp) in 3 ml of culture medium per well. After 60 min, cells in suspension were harvested, collected, and resuspended in complete culture medium (0.5 × 106 cells/ml); and 0.4-ml samples were transferred to individual wells in Vitrogen (Collagen BioMedical)-coated 24-well plates (Costar Corp.). After 60 min, the culture media were changed to Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and pineal cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each reaction contained 1 μg of plasmid with the promoter-luciferase construct, 4 μl of Plus reagent, 1 μl of LipofectAMINE, and 0.1 μg of an internal control, PRL-TK (Promega). Plasmid DNAs and transfection reagents were diluted separately into equal volumes (50 μl each) of Opti-MEM and mixed briefly. Following a further 3-h incubation, 1 ml of complete media was added to each well. Cells were harvested 48 h later and lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega; 50 μl per well). Lysates were immediately assayed for luciferase activity by the use of the Promega Dual Luciferase Assay system (catalog number E1960) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 10-μl sample of cell lysate was added to a 100-μl volume of luciferin substrate; luminescence was measured with a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG & G) set for a 2-s delay and 10-s integration. Relative luciferase activity was normalized to PRL-TKRenilla luciferase activity to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. For co-transfection experiments, COS-7 cells (grown to ∼50% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) were transfected with 200 ng of each expression plasmid, 100 ng of pGL3-TKNATE box4, and 20 ng of PRL-TK (internal control) and pTarget (Promega) or pcDNA3.1 to keep the amount of DNA per transfection constant. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and assayed for luciferase activity as described above. Co-transfection experiments using AVP E box reporter constructs were done essentially as described (37Jin X. Shearman L.P. Weaver D.R. Zylka M.J. De Vries G.J. Reppert S.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA of the cAANAT was used to screen a chicken cosmid library. This identified genomic clone 2A, which was purified and digested with HindIII to release a ∼6-kb insert, and was subsequently subcloned into pBlueScript II SK(+). Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking region of cAANAT gene (GenBankTM accession number AF193072) revealed that it contained several possible regulatory elements (Fig.1 A). A putative TATA box (TATAA) occurs at position −25 upstream of the transcription start point (TSP). A GC-rich region is present (−1403 to −1385), which could function as an Sp1-binding (38Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) and/or AP-2-binding (39Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) site, and an A/T-rich region occurs at position −468 to −422, which contains eight repeats of -TTATT- as the core sequence; the A/T-rich elements may act as binding sites for MEF-2 transcription factors (40Olson E.N. Perry M. Schulz R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar,41Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). In addition, this region could also provide binding sites for the photoreceptor-specific transcription factor CRX (Cone-rod homeobox containing protein (42Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G.

Of special interest was the present finding of an E box element (CACGTG) at position −49 to −44. E box elements are well defined recognition sites for basic helix-loop-helix-PER-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS)-binding domains (43Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3687-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The TSP was identified using S1 nuclease protection analysis of total RNA isolated from nighttime and daytime chicken pineal glands. A major protected product was detected using the nighttime tissue indicating that the cAANAT gene is likely to be transcribed from a single TSP located at the “G” residue (designated +1) in the sense strand of the gene (Fig. 1 B). A similar protected product was also obtained when total RNA from nighttime chicken retina was used. To identify regulatory regions in the 5′-upstream portion of the cAANAT gene, a fusion gene construct pGL3-B HindIII was made, containing a segment from −3999 to +120 (relative to the TSP). This was fused to the promoterless luciferase gene in pGL3-Basic. Deletion constructs of the 5′-flanking region of the cAANAT gene were transfected into primary chick pineal cells (Fig.2 A). Luciferase activity was normalized to the level of Renilla luciferase activity by the co-transfected plasmid pRL-TK. Progressive deletions from the 5′-end increased reporter expression, the highest activity being pGL3-B 217 (−217 to +120). These results suggest either a negative element(s) resides within the region between position −3999 to −217, and/or an enhancer element(s) is located within the shorter fragment (−217 to +120). By taking into account the location of the putative TATA box, it appeared likely that the enhancer element(s) resides between position −217 and −25. Examination of this small fragment of the cAANAT 5′-flanking region (217 bp) revealed several potential recognition elements for DNA-binding proteins, including the E box. Putative cis-acting element(s) involved in cAANAT transcription were identified using EMSA. DNA fragments (∼80–300 bp) of the 5′-flanking region (from −1700 to −1), which were amplified using reverse transcriptase PCR and end-labeled with 32P, were used as probes. Initial screening showed that three small stretches were capable of recruiting DNA-binding proteins. These include the E box at position −49 to −44, two ta"

It is shown here that poly(ADP-ribose) serves as an energy source for the final and rate-limiting step of BER, DNA ligation. This conclusion was drawn from experiments in which the fate of [32P]poly(ADP-ribose) or [32P]NAD added to HeLa nuclear extracts was systematically followed. ATP was synthesized from poly(ADP-ribose) in a pathway that strictly depended on nick-induced DNA synthesis. NAD was used for the synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose), which, in turn, was converted to ATP by pyrophosphorylytic cleavage utilizing the pyrophosphate generated from dNTPs during DNA synthesis. The adenylyl moiety was then preferentially used to adenylate DNA ligase III, from which it was transferred to the 5′-phosphoryl end of the nicked DNA. Finally, ligation to the 3′-OH end resulted in the release of AMP. When using NAD, but not poly(ADP-ribose), in the presence of 3-aminobenzamide, the entire process was blocked, confirming poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation to be the essential initial step.

The major pathway, BER,1 is initiated by DNA glycosylases that cleave the base-deoxyribose glycosyl bond of a damaged nucleotide residue. Then, endonucleases are recruited that cleave the chain on the 5′ side of the abasic site. As a result, nicked DNA intermediates occur. Nicked DNA, in turn, triggers the catalytic activities of DNA polymerase β (Pol β) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) (2Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K.

However, the actual function of PARP-1 in the BER process and the mechanism whereby poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis stimulates ligation (14Satoh M.S. Lindahl T. Nature. 1992; 356: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar) have still remained obscure (reviewed in Ref. 9Dantzer F. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Flatter E. De La Rubia G.

X-ray repair cross-complementing protein-1 (XRCC1) was the first human gene product isolated that mediates the cellular response to ionizing radiation (15Thompson L.H. Brookman K.W. Jones N.J. Allen S.A. Carrano A.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6160-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This protein is apparently essential and required for the BER pathway (16Tebbs R.S.

Recent investigations demonstrated specific interactions of XRCC1 with Pol β, DNA ligase III (Lig III), and PARP-1 (13Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T.

Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar, 9Dantzer F. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Flatter E. De La Rubia G. Oliver J. Rolli V.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4387-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Most situations requiring highly efficient DNA repair are accompanied by a dramatic decrease of the cellular ATP concentration. Considering that ligation represents the rate-limiting, ATP-dependent step in BER, it appears reasonable to expect a compensatory mechanism that would enable efficient DNA repair even in situations of energy deprivation. In the present report, it is demonstrated that poly(ADP-ribose) synthesized by PARP-1 may serve as a source of ATP that is specifically used for ligation. This finding provides a molecular mechanism for previous observations, in vivo and in vitro, demonstrating the specific stimulation of ligation by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation during BER. All reactions were carried out with nuclear HeLa cell extracts purchased from Promega or prepared (21Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3880) Google Scholar). In standard reactions (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 7 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mmdithiothreitol, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aphidicolin), 8 μg of nuclear protein were incubated with 200 ng of nicked plasmid DNA. Further additions are indicated in the legends to the figures. The reaction volume was 10 μl, and incubations were conducted at 30 °C for the time periods indicated. All data presented are representative of at least three independent experiments. Nicked plasmid was obtained by controlled incubation of an empty vector plasmid, pUC 9, with DNase I and subsequent purification of nicked plasmids by CsCl ethidium bromide centrifugation. Poly(ADP-ribose) was synthesized with 10 μg/ml purified recombinant PARP-1 from 100 μm NAD as described before (22Griesenbeck J. Oei S.L. Mayer-Kuckuk P. Ziegler M. Buchlow G. Schweiger M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7297-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Synthesized polymers were freed of residual amounts of DNA by DNase treatment followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitation. Reactions were stopped by precipitation with 10 volumes of acetone. Precipitated nucleotides were redissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mmEDTA. Samples containing equal amounts of radioactivity (as estimated by Cerenkov counting) were subjected to cellulose-coated plates (Machery-Nagel). Chromatography was performed as described before (23Hagen T. Ziegler M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1340: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) using the solvent system isobutyric acid/25% NH4OH/H2O (96/4/19 (v/v/v)). After separation was completed, the cellulose plates were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Reactions were stopped, and proteins were separated by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For analysis of plasmids, reactions were stopped, and after phenol/chloroform extraction, DNA was precipitated with ethanol, resuspended, and applied to 1% agarose gels in 90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3, and 50 μg/ml chloroquine. HeLa cells were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. A medium change of confluent cells was performed 2 h before treatment with methyl-N′-nitro-N′-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). At a density of 106 cells/ml, a 10-ml culture was treated with 100 μm MNNG for 5 min. The cells were then centrifuged and washed twice, and the culture was continued in a culture flask at 37 °C. 1-ml aliquots of the cell culture were taken after the time intervals indicated, and nuclear extracts were prepared (21Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3880) Google Scholar). Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and nick-induced DNA synthesis activities of nuclear extracts were determined under the same conditions as described above. However, the 10-μl reactions contained only 0.5 μg of nuclear protein. Incorporation of ADP-ribose was measured by using 1 μm [α-32P]NAD (NEN Life Science Products) and incubating for 15 min at ambient temperature. Incubations were stopped by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Incorporation of32P-labeled ADP-ribose into washed precipitates was determined by Cerenkov counting. Nick-induced DNA synthesis was measured by using 0.1 mm dATP, dGTP, and dTTP and 1 nm [α-32P]dCTP. Incubations were continued for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped, and after phenol/chloroform extraction, DNA was precipitated with ethanol, resuspended, and subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Incorporation of labeled nucleotides was determined by Cerenkov counting of excised gel pieces. All data presented are representative of at least three independent experiments. First, the metabolism of α-32P-labeled deproteinized poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) incubated in the presence of nicked DNA was analyzed in HeLa nuclear extracts. The major product of PAR degradation is ADP-ribose (Fig. 1 A, lane 1) arising from the activity of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase activity present in nuclear extracts (24Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Althaus F.R. Mutat. Res. 1989; 218: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 25Lin W. Ame J.C. Aboul-Ela N. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11895-11901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the presence of 1 mm deoxynucleotides (dNTPs), which allowed nick-induced DNA synthesis, in addition to radiolabeled ADP-ribose and AMP, labeled ATP was detected (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). Addition of only one or two unlabeled dNTPs failed to support the generation of labeled ATP. A mixture of at least three dNTPs enabled the synthesis of labeled ATP from labeled PAR (not shown). On the other hand, addition of 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate instead of dNTPs did not give rise to the generation of significant amounts of ATP (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). Thus, synthesis of ATP strictly depended on DNA synthesis. Moreover, the requirement for dNTPs indicated that the pyrophosphate released during DNA synthesis is specifically channeled to the ATP-forming activity, because added pyrophosphate was inefficient. It should be pointed out that the only feasible direct pathway for the generation of ATP from poly(ADP-ribose) includes the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond of ADP-ribose by a pyrophosphorylase, yielding ATP and ribose-5′-phosphate (26Maruta H. Matsumura N. Tanuma S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). If radioactively labeled ADP-ribose was used in similar reactions, synthesis of ATP was only detected at very high concentrations (10 mm) of pyrophosphate (not shown). The dependence of ATP generation on the presence of ADP-ribose polymers was further supported by incubations of nuclear extracts with dNTPs and α-32P-labeled NAD (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2–4). The synthesis of labeled ATP from labeled NAD was not detected, if the reaction was performed in the presence of the inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). However, the presence of 3-AB did not prevent the synthesis of radiolabeled ATP from labeled PAR (Fig. 1 B, lane 10). Consequently, dNTP-dependent formation of ATP exhibited an absolute requirement for PAR, either added directly or synthesized by endogenous PARP activity. ATP generation from labeled NAD or labeled PAR (Fig. 1 B) attained a maximum after about 20 min of incubation (compare in Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 8 versus lanes 4 and 9). If an amount of [α-32P]ATP equivalent to that of NAD or ADP-ribose units in PAR was used instead, it was almost entirely metabolized to ADP. Also, in this case, only a very little AMP (<1%) was formed (Fig. 1 C, right lane). In contrast, ATP synthesized from PAR coupled to DNA synthesis was apparently not degraded to ADP (see Fig.1, A and C). This suggests that the PAR-derived ATP is inaccessible to ATPases, such as topoisomerases, helicases, or kinases, but is accessible only to enzymes metabolizing ATP to AMP. Thus, the pathway of ATP synthesis using PAR as intermediate product appeared to provide ATP for a specific reaction. In the first step of DNA ligation, ATP is used to form an adenylated ligase intermediate. In subsequent steps, the adenylyl group is transferred to the 5′-phosphoryl donor, and eventually, AMP is released when the 5′-phosphoryl and the 3′-OH ends are joined. Owing to the fact that both PARP-1 and Lig III are constituents of the BER complex (17Caldecott K.W. McKeown C.K. Tucker J.D. Ljungquist S. Thompson L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 68-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 19Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Johnson P. Shall S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4387-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 20Cappelli E. Taylor R. Cevasco M. Abbondandolo A. Caldecott K. Frosina G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23970-23975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), it appeared to be a likely possibility that Lig III (molecular weight, 103,000) is specifically using ATP generated from PAR as described above. To test this possibility, nuclear extracts were incubated in the presence of nicked DNA, dNTPs, and α-32P-labeled NAD for several time intervals, similarly to reactions shown in Fig. 1 B, lanes 2–4. Proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently subjected to autoradiography (Fig. 1 D). As expected, the major radioactively labeled protein represented automodified endogenous PARP-1 (molecular weight, 116,000) or PARP-1-fragments (Fig. 1 D, asterisks), in accordance with previous reports showing that the predominant reaction of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation represents automodification of PARP-1 itself (27Ogata N. Ueda K. Kawaichi M. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4135-4137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A further radiolabeled protein with an apparent molecular weight of about 100,000 was detected (Fig.1 D, arrow on right), the modification of which was sensitive to treatment with acid (Fig. 1 D, lane 4, arrow on right). Compared with poly(ADP-ribosylation), adenylation of proteins is relatively unstable, especially at acidic pH. Incubation of nuclear extracts with [α-32P]ATP and separation of proteins on SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography visualized proteins modified by adenylation (Fig. 1 E, left lane). As expected, several adenylated proteins exhibited apparent molecular masses corresponding to those of known human DNA ligases (28Tomkinson A.E. Levin D.L. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), i.e. Lig I (125 kDa), Lig III (103 kDa), and Lig II (70 kDa) (Fig. 1 E, left lane). If, prior to the adenylation reaction using [α-32P]ATP, unlabeled NAD and dNTPs were incubated with the nuclear extract, the pattern of modified proteins was similar, except that the 103-kDa protein (most likely Lig III) was not labeled. Obviously, this protein had already been adenylated by unlabeled ATP formed during the preincubation in the presence of NAD and dNTPs. Modification of Lig III directly from dNTPs or NAD was excluded by adding an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation: if the preincubation with NAD and dNTPs was conducted in the presence of 3-AB, labeling of the 103-kDa protein with [α-32P]ATP was undiminished (not shown). The subsequent step after adenylation of DNA ligases is the activation of the donor DNA by transferring the adenylyl group to the phosphorylated 5′-end of a DNA nick. The resulting DNA-AMP complex then reacts with the 3′-OH acceptor group, leading to the ligation of the phosphorylated 5′-end with the 3′-OH under release of AMP. The intermediate DNA-AMP complex can be trapped, if the final joining step of the ligation is prevented. This was accomplished by using 2′-3′-dideoxy NTPs. The specific synthesis of ATP from PAR (see Fig. 1) was still significant, if a mixture of ddATP, ddCTP, dGTP, and dTTP was used instead of dNTPs (not shown). Therefore, during nick-induced DNA synthesis, the incorporation of ddAMP or ddCMP into nicked plasmids would lead, in part, to DNA-AMP intermediates of nicked plasmids with 2′-3′-dideoxy-ends adjacent to an adenylated 5′-end. This possibility was verified in ligation reactions in nuclear extracts using nicked DNA, α-32P-labeled NAD, and unlabeled ddATP, ddCTP, dGTP, and dTTP (Fig. 1 F). The formation of labeled DNA-[32P]AMP complexes was clearly detectable, but only in the absence of 3-AB (Fig. 1 F), that is, only if poly([α-32P]ADP-ribosyl)ation was allowed to occur. These observations provide direct evidence for the conclusion that the adenylyl moieties of poly(ADP-ribose) may be used to activate the 5′-phosphoryl ends of nicked DNA. In this NAD-dependent pathway, the activities of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, DNA synthesis, and ligation contribute directly to the ligation of nicked DNA only when combined together. All the enzymes implicated in this mechanism (PARP-1, Pol β, and Lig III) interact with the scaffold protein XRCC1 within the BER complex. Heterodimerization of XRCC1 and Lig III leads to enhanced ligation activity (20Cappelli E. Taylor R. Cevasco M. Abbondandolo A. Caldecott K. Frosina G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23970-23975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). On the other hand, interaction of XRCC1 with either PARP-1 or Pol β results in a down-regulation of the respective catalytic activity (13Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 18Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). It was confirmed in this study that in cultured HeLa cells during BER Pol β and PARP-1 activities are indeed similarly regulated (Fig. 2 A). Treatment of HeLa cells with 100 μm MNNG, a well known inductor of the BER pathway, led to transient activation of both PARP-1 and Pol β activities followed by a sharp decline after about 30 min. The assay of DNA synthesis used in this study was restricted to Pol β activity, because other known DNA polymerases were inhibited by aphidicolin (29Friedberg E.C. DNA Repair. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1985Google Scholar). As tested for PARP-1 in quantitative Western blot analyses (not shown), the modulation of activity was not caused by changes of protein expression. This holds true also for the reactivation after about 3 h following the MNNG treatment. Thesein vivo experiments support the conclusion of previous studies that during DNA repair both PARP-1 and Pol β activities are regulated in concert by their interaction with XRCC1. The time course of the activation of PARP-1 and Pol β also paralleled the enhanced occurrence of poly(ADP-ribose) and depletion of the cellular NAD, ATP, and dNTP pools reported in earlier studies (30Das S.K. Berger N.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 137: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 31Sims J.L. Berger S.J. Berger N.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5188-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The onset of the final step of BER, ligation, coincides with these events. The ligation step is most important for successful DNA repair; it is rate-limiting and ATP-dependent. The data presented so far suggested that synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) may serve as an emergency device to complete DNA repair under conditions of cellular ATP depletion. It would be expected then that availability of sufficient ATP should suppress such a pathway. This hypothesis was tested by adding 5 mm ATP to incubations of HeLa nuclear extracts in the presence of nicked DNA, dNTPs, and α-32P-labeled NAD. Surprisingly, under these conditions, modification of nuclear proteins other than PARP-1 or its fragments was not just inhibited but virtually absent (Fig. 2 B, left panel, lane 2), as opposed to the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation observed in the absence of ATP (lane 1, cf. also Fig. 1 D). Moreover, 32P adenylation of Lig III was also not detectable. Analysis of radiolabeled nucleotides confirmed that in the presence of 5 mm ATP, hardly any of the added [α-32P]NAD was metabolized (Fig. 2 B, right panel, lane 2). Addition of other NTPs, dNTPs, ADP, or AMP at the same concentration (5 mm) did not cause any comparable effect. A direct effect of ATP on PARP-1 was also excluded, because the catalytic activity of the isolated enzyme did not exhibit such a sensitivity toward ATP (not shown). Moreover, addition of isolated recombinant automodification domain of PARP-1 (amino acids 337–573) resulted in the partial recovery of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3). However, adenylation of Lig III was still not detectable. The automodification domain of PARP-1 is known to mediate specific interaction with partner proteins (22Griesenbeck J. Oei S.L. Mayer-Kuckuk P. Ziegler M. Buchlow G. Schweiger M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7297-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), in particular XRCC1 (18Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that excess of this domain affected the binding of the endogenous PARP-1 to XRCC1, and thus to the BER complex. Consequently, PARP-1 inhibition was abolished, but the BER complex was disabled to synthesize ATP. The suggested effect of the added automodification domain of PARP-1 was further supported by analysis of nick-induced DNA synthesis and ligation catalyzed by the nuclear extracts. Whereas DNA synthesis, but no ligation, was observed in the absence of ATP (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1), the presence of 5 mm ATP led to ligation but suppressed nick-induced DNA synthesis (Fig. 2 C, lanes 2). Addition of the automodification domain of PARP-1 restored nick-induced DNA synthesis in the presence of ATP. Still, the ligated plasmid (closed circle) did not contain radiolabel of the added dNTPs (Fig.2 C, lanes 3). It is well known that DNA repair processes need a high level of ATP. Therefore, in vitro assays are usually conducted in the presence of about 2 mm ATP and a regenerating system (32Wood R.D. Robins P. Lindahl T. Cell. 1988; 53: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated in the experiment shown in Fig. 2 D that in the absence of any added ATP or an ATP regenerating system nicked plasmids can be rejoined by HeLa nuclear extracts. However, rejoining occurs only if the conditions established above for the ATP synthesis from PAR are met. That is, conversion of nicked circles to closed circles was only observed if PAR (either directly added or formed from NAD by endogenous PARP-1) and dNTPs were present (Fig. 2 D, lanes 5 and 6). As mentioned before, added ADP-ribose did not serve as a substitute for PAR. The results of the present study support the conclusion that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation may directly contribute to the process of BER by providing a source of ATP for the ligation step. It is important to note that the favorable effects of NAD and PARP on ligation have long been known. Originally, the observed stimulation of strand break rejoining was suspected to be caused by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of a ligase (10Creissen D. Shall S. Nature. 1982; 296: 271-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, this suggestion has not been confirmed. In initial in vivo studies, antisense RNA expression was used to deplete cells of PARP-1. It was observed that the absence of PARP-1 resulted in a significant delay of DNA strand break rejoining (11Ding R. Pommier Y. Kang V.H. Smulson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12804-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, analyses of cells derived from PARP-1–/– mice also revealed a substantial reduction of the DNA ligation activity (12Trucco C. Oliver F.J. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In the meantime, the BER complex has been well studied, and direct interactions of the proteins involved have been established, both in vitro and in vivo. It was clearly demonstrated that NAD, which provides the substrate for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, accelerates the ligation step without influencing, for example, Pol β activity (13Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Considering the dramatic decrease of the cellular ATP concentration following exposure to genotoxic agents (30Das S.K. Berger N.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 137: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 31Sims J.L. Berger S.J. Berger N.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5188-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), a role of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation may be the extraction of energy from NAD and its immediate use for DNA repair, specifically ligation. Along this line, the high affinity of PARP-1 for DNA nicks would ensure that NAD is preferentially used at sites in need of DNA repair. Taking into account previous reports proposing the existence of a functional complex consisting of XRCC1, DNA polymerase β, Lig III, and PARP-1 (see Ref.9Dantzer F. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Flatter E. De La Rubia G. Oliver J. Rolli V. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Biochimie. 1999; 81: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar for review), the capability of these constituents of the BER complex to produce ATP from poly(ADP-ribose) provides a rationale for the tight interaction of these proteins (Fig. 3). In addition, the stimulatory influence of NAD specifically on the ligation reaction can be attributed to the generation of ATP, which is apparently directly channeled to the ligase. According to the data presented, the pathway of ATP synthesis does not necessarily include the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) to ADP-ribose. However, ADP-ribose may be generated within the tight complex of participating enzymes and may not be substituted for by added ADP-ribose, similar to the situation found for pyrophosphate (Fig.1 A, lane 3). ATP formation using pyrophosphate generated from dNTPs during nick-induced DNA synthesis is difficult to demonstrate directly, because the γ-phosphate group of only a single added [γ-32P]dNTP is readily detectable in ATP (not shown), presumably owing to transphosphorylation of ADP in the nuclear extracts. Nevertheless, the requirement of DNA synthesis to generate ATP from PAR strongly suggests the involvement of pyrophosphate. Furthermore, high concentrations (10 mm) of added pyrophosphate were effective to synthesize ATP from PAR in the absence of dNTPs (not shown). Therefore, it would appear that the detected ATP synthesis includes pyrophosphorolytic cleavage of ADP-ribose, yielding ribose phosphate as its second product. An enzymatic activity catalyzing this kind of reaction has been detected previously in HeLa cell extracts (26Maruta H. Matsumura N. Tanuma S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is of importance to the emerging model (Fig. 3) that the specific generation of ATP requires the synthesis of DNA, which is accompanied by the liberation of pyrophosphate. It is this ATP that is at least preferentially used by Lig III for its autoadenylation and subsequent activation of the DNA donor (5′-phosphorylated end) and, thus, mediates ligation. Moreover, the final phase of BER, including nick-induced DNA synthesis, generation of ATP from PAR, and ligation, appears to be accomplished by an autonomous complex. Bulk phase ATP and pyrophosphate are apparently not used by this complex. Rather, a high cellular energy state (that is, high ATP concentrations) may possibly serve as a signal that favors direct ligation of nicked DNA or execution of the Pol β-dependent short-patch repair pathway (2Sobol R.W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13741-13743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). An important observation (Fig. 2 B) relates to the potential function of Lig III and PARP-1 as molecular nick sensors.

According to the data presented in Fig. 2,B and C, at high ATP concentrations, Lig III is readily adenylated. At the same time, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and DNA synthesis are strongly inhibited. A possible explanation would be that adenylation of Lig III within the BER complex enhances its affinity to DNA nicks or at least causes the BER complex to assume a conformation that prevents DNA binding of PARP-1 and thereby poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Such a mechanism would restrict the use of NAD as an energy source to emergency situations of ATP shortage. We thank G. Buchlow for technical assistance."

Several attempts to generate an antibody to p53 phosphorylated at Ser6 using a phosphoserine-containing peptide as an immunogen were unsuccessful; however, phosphorylation-specific antibodies were produced by using the phosphoserine mimetic,l-2-amino-4-phosphono-4,4-difluorobutanoic acid (F2Pab), in place of phosphoserine. Fmoc-F2Pab was prepared by an improved synthesis and chemically incorporated using solid phase peptide synthesis. Affinity-purified antibodies elicited by immunizing rabbits with an F2Pab peptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin recognized a p53(1–39) peptide phosphorylated only at Ser6 but not the unphosphorylated peptide or the same peptide phosphorylated at Ser9, Ser15, Ser20, Ser33, or Ser37. Untreated A549 cells exhibited a background of constitutive phosphorylation at Ser6 that increased approximately 10-fold upon exposure to either ionizing radiation or UV light. Similar results were obtained for Ser9 using antibodies raised against a conventional phosphopeptide. Ser9 was phosphorylated by casein kinase 1in vitro in a phosphoserine 6-dependent manner.

Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). p53 normally is a short-lived protein that is maintained at low levels in unstressed cells. After cells are exposed to DNA damage-inducing agents, the p53 protein is transiently stabilized and accumulates in the nucleus where it also is activated as a transcription factor. Both stabilization of the p53 protein and activation of its sequence-specific DNA binding ability are widely believed to be mediated, at least in part, by posttranslational modifications (3Appella, E., and Anderson, C.

The serines at positions 4, 6, and 9 with respect to the N terminus of murine p53 are reported to be phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro by casein kinase 1 (CK1) or a CK1-like enzyme (13Knippschild U.

CK1-δ is a homolog of the budding yeast kinase Hrr25, a nuclear Ser/Thr protein kinase that was isolated in a screen for mutants sensitive to double-stranded breaks (14Graves P.R. Haas D.W.

In human p53, serine 4 is replaced by proline, but the serines at positions 6 and 9 are conserved in most species for which sequence information is available (17Soussi T. May P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 623-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To determine whether these residues in human p53 become phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, we attempted to produce antibodies that recognize human p53 only when it is phosphorylated at these residues. Although hyperimmunization of a rabbit with a p53 peptide phosphorylated at the Ser9 position yielded antibodies that recognized p53 peptides phosphorylated at Ser9, repeated attempts to produce antibodies that reacted with phosphorylated Ser6 by immunizing with a similar phosphopeptide failed. One possible reason for this failure is that the immunizing peptide becomes rapidly dephosphoryated. To circumvent dephosphorylation of the immunogen, we chemically incorporated a stable serine phosphate mimetic, F2Pab, in place of serine phosphate in the p53 peptide used for immunizations (Fig. 1). In contrast to the natural phosphopeptide, immunization with the F2Pab-mimetic peptide produced antisera that reacted strongly and specifically with a p53 peptide phosphorylated at Ser6. Using the resulting affinity purified antibodies, we report here that human p53 becomes rapidly and strongly phosphorylated at Ser6 as well as at Ser9 in response to exposing cells to either ionizing radiation or UV light. The intermediate,t-butoxycarbonyl-l-F2Pab(OEt)2-OH, was prepared in 24% yield by our improved procedure in five steps, based on the methods of Berkowitz et al. (18Berkowitz D.B. Eggen M. Shen Q. Shoemaker R.K. J. Org. Chem. 1996; 61: 4666-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and Otakaet al. (19Otaka A. Miyoshi K., T.R. Burke J. Roller P.P. Kubota H. Tamamura H. Fujii N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 927-930Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Treatment of this intermediate with 1m trimethylsilyl triflate/2 mdimethylsulfide/trifluoroacetic acid provided l- F2Pab-OH, which was reacted with Fmoc-OSu to obtain Fmoc-l-F2Pab-OH in 75% yield. Peptides were synthesized by the solid phase method with Fmoc chemistry using an Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer (Foster City, CA). Phosphoserine was incorporated as Fmoc-Ser[PO(OBzl)OH] (Novabiochem, San Diego, CA), andl-2-amino-4-phosphono-4,4-difluorobutanoic acid (l-F2Pab) was incorporated as Fmoc-F2Pab-OH. The peptide was cleaved from the resin, and side chain protecting groups were removed with regent K (trifluoroacetic acid/phenol/thioanisole/H2O/ethandithiol 82.5:5:5:5:2.5) for 3 h at room temperature. The peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a Vydac C-8 column (Hesperia, CA) with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/water/acetonitrile. The mass of peptides was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a Finnigan MAT SSQ 7000 (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to p53 phosphorylated at Ser6 was raised against the human p53 sequence Ac-1–12(6F2Pab)Cys (i.e.Ac-MEEPQ(F2Pab)DPSVEPC) conjugated through the added C-terminal cysteine to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Sera from an immunized rabbit were affinity purified by use of the natural phosphopeptide Ac-1–12(6P)Cys (i.e. Ac-MEEPQS(P)DPSVEPC) coupled to Sulfolink (Pierce). The purified antibodies then were passed through a column coupled with the unphosphorylated peptide p53(Ac-1–12Cys) (i.e. Ac-MEEPQSDPSVEPC) to deplete antibodies that react with unphosphorylated p53. Antibody specific for p53 phosphorylated at Ser9 were prepared as described (7Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Rabbits were immunized with Ac-4–15(9P)Cys (i.e.Ac-PQSDPS(P)VEPPLSC) coupled to KLH. Phosphoserine 9-specific antibodies were purified with the use of the corresponding Sulfolinked phospho- and unphosphorylated peptides. The specificity of each antibody was confirmed by ELISA and immunoblot assays. Dot blots were prepared by spotting 1 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution of each peptide onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 2 h, washed in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, and then processed as for Western blot analysis. A549 (ATCC CCL-185), a human lung carcinoma cell line that expresses wild-type p53, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA); NCI-H1299 (ATCC CRL-5803), a human lung carcinoma cell line that is null for both p53 alleles (20Mitsudomi T. Steinberg S.M. Nau M.M. Carbone D., D., D.A. Bodner S. Oie H.K. Linnoila R.I. Mulshine J.L. Minna J.D. et al.Oncogene. 1992; 7: 171-180PubMed Google Scholar), was obtained from A. Fornace, Jr. (NCI, National Institutes of Health). Cells were grown to 50–70% confluency in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 nm glutamine in 150-mm dishes. Cells were seeded 24 h prior to treatment and were 60–70% confluent at the time of treatment. After being washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the cultures were exposed to UV irradiation using a Stratagene UV Stratalinker 2400 or to ionizing radiation using a Shepherd Mark I137Cs irradiator at a dose rate of 3.2 Gy/min. The proteasome inhibitor ALLN (Calbiochem) was added to cells at a final concentration of 20 μm as described (5Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar); adriamycin was added to cultures at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml and remained in the cultures until they were harvested. At the times indicated (see Fig. 5), cultures were harvested and processed for immunoprecipitation essentially as described (7Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) except that in place of immunoprecipitation with protein G-Sepharose, p53 was collected by centrifugation with a 1:1 mixture of PAb1801- and DO-1-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). 5 μg of each antibody-conjugate was used for 1300 μg of extract protein; after incubation for 2 h at 45 °C, the beads were washed five times by centrifugation. To avoid possible interference by the IgG heavy chain, the reducing agent was omitted from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. For preparation of phosphorylation-specific antibodies for p53 Ser6 and Ser9, we first attempted to prepare phosphorylation site-specific antibodies that recognize phosphorylated Ser6 or Ser9 of human p53 by immunizing rabbits with chemically synthesized p53 phosphopeptides conjugated to KLH as described (7Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 8Sakaguchi K. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Roy S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9278-9283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In the case of a rabbit immunized with p53(Ac-4–15(9P))C-KLH, purified antibodies were readily obtained from serum taken 6 weeks after the start of immunization that reacted specifically with the peptide p53(1–39) phosphorylated at Ser9 but not with the unphosphorylated peptide nor with peptides phosphorylated at other known N-terminal phosphorylation sites (Fig. 2). In the case of Ser6, however, no phosphorylation-specific antibody was obtained from any of four rabbits immunized with p53(Ac-1–12(6P))C-KLH, even after 9 weeks of immunizations. In contrast, antibodies specific for the unphosphorylated p53 peptide readily were detected in this period (Fig. 3 A). To circumvent possible dephosphorylation of the immunizing peptide, we prepared a second peptide conjugate, p53(Ac-1–12(6F2Pab)C)-KLH, containing the phosphoserine mimetic,l-2-amino-4-phosphono-4,4-difluorobutanoic acid (F2Pab) (19Otaka A. Miyoshi K., T.R. Burke J. Roller P.P. Kubota H. Tamamura H. Fujii N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 927-930Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar), in place of phosphoserine at residue 6. Immunization with this peptide yielded antibodies that recognized both an unphosphorylated p53 N-terminal peptide and an N-terminal peptide phosphorylated at Ser6. Indeed, the titer of antibodies in each of the initial four bleedings was higher for the phosphorylated peptide compared with the unphosphorylated peptide (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, antibodies affinity purified from serum obtained 8 weeks after the initial immunization were highly reactive and specific for p53(1–39)(6P) (Fig. 2).Figure 3Time course of antibody development after immunization with p53(Ac-1–12(6P))C-KLH or p53(Ac-1–12(6F2Pab))C-KLH. Rabbits were immunized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Serum was prepared from rabbits at three (bleed 1), five (bleed 2), seven (bleed 3), and 9 weeks (bleed 4) after the initial immunization, and 5 μl of each serum was used in a standard ELISA assay with the unphosphorylated p53 N-terminal peptide p53(1–39) and with the phosphorylated peptide p53(1–12(6P)). Assays were incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The absorbance at 405 nm because of hydrolysis of the 2,2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) substrate is proportional to the fraction of antibody in each serum that recognized the indicated substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further characterize both phospho-specific antibodies, we performed quantitative ELISA assays using the purified antibodies and selected unphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides (Fig.4). As expected, the purified PAbSer(P)9 reacted with p53(Ac-1–12) phosphorylated at Ser9 but not with the unphosphorylated peptide (Fig. 4, right panel). These antibodies also reacted well with p53(Ac-1–12) phosphorylated at both Ser6 and Ser9, indicating that phosphorylation at Ser6 will not significantly affect the ability of the purified PAbSer(P)9 antibodies to recognize p53 phosphorylated at both residues. Previous studies by us and others have shown that phosphorylation at closely spaced sites can interfere with recognition by phosphorylation-specific antibodies (8Sakaguchi K. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Roy S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9278-9283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Likewise, antibodies raised against p53(Ac-1–12(6F2Pab)) and affinity purified with the natural phospho-Ser6 peptide (PAbSer(P)6 antibodies) recognized well p53(Ac-1–12) phosphorylated at Ser6 or at Ser6 and Ser9 and did not recognize the unphosphorylated peptide (Fig. 4, left panel). Surprisingly, however, these antibodies hardly recognized the p53(Ac-1–12(6F2Pab) peptide (solid squares). Therefore, we also purified antibodies from PAbSer(P)6 crude serum, i.e. from a rabbit immunized with p53(Ac-1–12(6F2Pab)C)-KLH, on Sulfolinked p53(Ac-1–12(6F2Pab)C) instead of the natural phosphoserine-containing peptide (Fig. 4, middle panel). These antibodies behaved in the opposite manner; they recognized p53(Ac-1–12(6F2Pab) well but barely recognized the natural phospho-Ser6 peptide. These data indicate that although F2Pab functioned as a phosphoserine mimetic to induce the production of phosphoserine-specific antibodies, there appear to be significant differences in the structure of phosphoserine and F2Pab or of the resulting peptides such that most antibodies that recognize phosphoserine cannot also recognize peptidyl-F2Pab. To determine whether human p53 is phosphorylated at Ser6and Ser9 after exposure to DNA damage-inducing agents, we exposed A549 cells, a human lung carcinoma cell line with wild-type p53, to 8 Gy of ionizing radiation, to 25 J/m2 of UV-C light, or to 0.2 μg/ml of adriamycin. As a control, cells also were treated with ALLN, a proteasome inhibitor that blocks Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation and induces the accumulation of p53 to about the same extent as DNA damage-inducing agents. Cell extracts were prepared at different times after exposure, the p53 was immunoprecipitated with a p53 antibody mixture attached to agarose beads, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the membrane was probed either with phosphorylation site-specific antibody preparations or with DO-1, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope in the transactivation domain of human p53. As can been seen from Fig.5, there was a low level of constitutive phosphorylation at both Ser6 and Ser9 that rose slightly after ALLN treatment approximately in parallel with the increase in p53. In sharp contrast to treatment with ALLN, there was a rapid and strong phosphorylation of Ser6 in response to IR that was clearly observed by 1 h after irradiation and reached a plateau between 2 and 24 h before declining to near baseline values by 72 h after exposure. In other experiments (data not shown), an increase in Ser6 phosphorylation could be observed by as little as 5 min after exposure to 8 Gy. Phosphorylation at Ser9 in response to IR followed a similar time course to phosphorylation at Ser6, but the apparent intensity of the damage-induced phosphorylation at Ser9 was not as great as at Ser6. Ser6 also became intensely phosphorylated in response to UV-C and to treatment with adriamycin; however, the induction of phosphorylation was slower with UV-C and adriamycin compared with induction with IR, and the response to both agents was prolonged in comparison with IR. Maximum phosphorylation of Ser6occurred between 8 and 48 h with UV and between 4 and 24 h with adriamycin, and residual elevated phosphorylation was still seen 96 h after exposure was initiated. Once again, the time course of induced phosphorylation at Ser9 paralleled that at Ser6, but phosphorylation at Ser9 appeared to be less intense. Thus, the phosphorylation response to adriamycin was intermediate between the responses to IR and UV-C. The similarity of the time course of phosphorylation at Ser6 and Ser9 suggested that phosphorylation of Ser9 might be coupled to phosphorylation of Ser6. Recently, we showed that Thr18 of human p53 is phosphorylated by a casein kinase 1-like enzyme in response to DNA damage (8Sakaguchi K. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Roy S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9278-9283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The specificity of CK1, a ubiquitously expressed protein kinase, is directed to specific serines and threonines by phosphorylation at the −3 position (21Flotow H. Graves P.R. Wang A. Fiol C.J.

Ser9 bears a relationship to Ser6 that is similar to the relationship between Thr18 and Ser15; therefore, we asked whether CK1 also could phosphorylate Ser9. Fig.6 shows that p53(Ac-1–12), as expected, was not phosphorylated by recombinant CK1-δ. However, the peptide p53(Ac-1–12)(6P), was readily phosphorylated by CK1-δ. The response of mammalian cells to DNA damage is complex (reviewed in Refs. 24Anderson C.W. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Carr A.M. Hoekstra M.F.

Chem. 1997; 378: 1217-1229PubMed Google Scholar). Cell cycle progression is controlled by several checkpoints that are activated by DNA damage, by other stresses, and by mechanisms that ensure the orderly progression of cell cycle events. One of the most important mammalian cell cycle checkpoint proteins is the tumor suppressor p53. The p53 gene is inactivated in the majority of human cancers (27Hollstein M. Moeckel G. Hergenhahn M. Spiegelhalder B. Keil M. Werle-Schneider G. Bartsch H. Brickmann J. Mutat Res. 1998; 405: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Studies over the last 20 years have shown that human p53 is a 393-amino acid, nuclear phosphoprotein that functions in part as an activator of transcription (reviewed in Refs. 1Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholarand 2Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). In normal, undamaged cells p53 is rapidly degraded. Treating cells with a variety of DNA damage-inducing agents induces a transient accumulation of p53 protein and activates it as a transcription factor. Human p53 has been shown to be phosphorylated at several N-terminal and C-terminal sites that in vitro affect site-specific DNA binding and interactions with other cellular and viral proteins (3Appella, E., and Anderson, C. W. (2000) Pathol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar,4Meek D.W. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that p53 becomes phosphorylated at two previously undescribed sites, Ser6 and Ser9, in response to exposing cells to ionizing radiation or adriamycin, both of which produce DNA strand breaks, and after exposure to UV light, which produces bulky lesions in DNA. Although detection of phosphorylations by Western immunoblot analysis with phosphorylation-specific antibodies is a qualitative technique, Ser6 appears to be one of the most strongly phosphorylated sites in response to DNA damage, and this site, together with Ser15, is one of the earliest DNA damage-induced posttranslational modifications to p53 that has been detected. Ser9 appears to be less strongly phosphorylated, but the time course of its phosphorylation closely paralleled that of Ser6, suggesting that phosphorylation of the two sites might be linked (see below). Studies with phosphorylated peptides suggest that phosphorylation at Ser9 should not interfere with the detection of phosphorylation at Ser6 and vice versa (Fig. 4). Serines 6 and 9 are conserved in most (e.g. human, monkey, mouse, rat, and hamster) but not in all (e.g. cow, sheep, and cat) mammalian species. Murine p53 is phosphorylated at residues homologous to Ser6and Ser9, as well as at Ser4, which is not present in human p53, by a DNA damage-induced or activated protein kinase that resembles CK1 (4Meek D.W. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 13Knippschild U. Milne D.M. Campbell L.E. DeMaggio A.J. Christenson E. Hoekstra M.F. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In vitro, recombinant CK1-δ does not phosphorylate (8Sakaguchi K. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Roy S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9278-9283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), or at best phosphorylates poorly, the N terminus of unmodified human p53 or unmodified N-terminal p53 peptides, but we recently showed that CK1-δ will phosphorylate human p53 at Thr18 in vitro if it is targeted to this site by prior phosphorylation of Ser15. Ser9, like Thr18, is situated 3 residues distal to a site that becomes strongly phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, and Ser9was phosphorylated in vitro by CK1-δ in a Ser6phosphorylation-dependent manner (Fig. 6). We speculated that the phosphorylation of Ser9 and Thr18 by CK1-δ or a CK1-δ-like enzyme in a cascade-like manner that depends on the damage-dependent phosphorylation of the upstream −3 residue may serve as a mechanism for amplifying the biochemical effect of the initial phosphorylation. In contrast to the reported situation with murine p53, however, Ser6 of human p53 in N-terminal peptides was not phosphorylated by CK1-δ in vitro. The rapid and strong phosphorylation of this site in vivosuggests that it is recognized by an as yet unknown DNA damage-activated protein kinase. A significant problem in the study of p53 and its response to DNA damage has been that such studies have required labeling cells with large amounts of radioactive precursors, which themselves cause DNA damage and modification of p53 (28Dover R. Jayaram Y. Patel K. Chinery R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1181-1184PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yeargin J. Haas M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 423-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Antisera that specifically recognize peptidyl-phosphotyrosine have been available for several years, but antisera that specifically recognize peptidyl phosphoserine or phosphothreonine became available only recently (30Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). It was immediately apparent that if antibodies could be produced that recognize specific phosphorylation sites in p53, then phosphorylation at these sites could be monitored without the complication of exposing cell to high levels of DNA damaging radiation. However, producing antisera that recognized specific sites in proteins only when phosphorylated is not a trivial task, and one potentially limiting factor is dephosphorylation of the immunizing peptide by cellular phosphatases after injection of the phosphopeptide conjugates. To circumvent the dephosphorylation problem, we explored the use of a fluorine analog of phosphoserine, F2Pab, which can be chemically incorporated into peptides as the Fmoc-derivative at the desired site (19Otaka A. Miyoshi K., T.R. Burke J. Roller P.P. Kubota H. Tamamura H. Fujii N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 927-930Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Miyoshi K. Otaka A. Kaneko M. Tamamura H. Fujii N. Peptide Chemistry. 1995; 33: 25-28Google Scholar). The F2Pab-phosphoserine mimetic is resistant to hydrolysis by the phosphatases in cells that remove phosphates from proteins and peptides, and, in contrast to methylene derivatives, the second ionization constant of the phosphonate (pKa2) is close to that of phosphate (32Chen L. Wu L. Otaka A. Smyth M.S. Roller P.P. Burke Jr., T.R. den Hertog J. Zhang Z.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, F2Pab-derivatized peptides appear to be stable, effective mimics of protein phosphorylation sites. Recently we showed that antibody raised to the peptide p53(13–19(15F2Pab))A13–19(15F2Pab))AC coupled to KLH, i.e. to PL(F2Pab)QETFAPL(F2Pab)QETFAC-KLH, was capable of specifically recognizing p53 phosphorylated at Ser15(8Sakaguchi K. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Roy S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9278-9283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, we and others had previously shown that site-specific antibodies could be raised to this site using conventional phosphopeptides. In the case of Ser6, multiple attempts to produce a phosphopeptide-specific antibody were unsuccessful even though antibodies that recognized the N-terminal segment of p53 were produced. In contrast, with the substitution of F2Pab for the natural phosphoserine, antibodies that specifically recognized phosphorylated Ser6 can be readily obtained. A surprising finding is the observation that antibodies raised by immunizing with peptidyl-F2Pab and purified using a natural phosphopeptide reacted only poorly with the immunizing peptidyl-F2Pab peptide. Conversely, antibodies from the same bleeding that were purified using peptidyl-F2Pab reacted only poorly with the homologous, natural phosphoserine peptide. This result suggests that F2Pab may adopt two or more conformations, only one of which truly imitates phosphoserine. Antibodies are elicited that recognize both conformations, but these antibody populations cross-react with the alternate conformation(s) poorly. However, because we have not measured antibody recovery, there may be a third population of elicited antibodies that recognize both conformations but that were not recovered by our purification procedures. Thus, although further studies will be required to understand the nature of the immunogenic response to F2Pab-containing peptides, our initial successes strongly suggest that the use of the F2Pab as a mimetic for phosphoserine can provide a functional approach to developing phosphorylation-specific antisera that may even extend to developing monoclonal producing hybridomas."

The aims of the present study were (i) to examine the role of cytoplasmic signaling through MAPK pathways in tonicity regulation of COX-2 expression in collecting duct cells and (ii) to assess the possible contribution of COX-2 to the survival of inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells under hypertonic conditions. In mIMCD-K2 cells, a cell line derived from mouse IMCDs, hypertonicity induced a marked increase in COX-2 protein expression. The stimulation was reduced significantly by inhibition of MEK1 (PD-98059, 5–50 μm) and p38 (SB-203580, 5–100 μm) and was almost abolished by the combination of the two compounds. To study the role of JNK in tonicity-stimulated COX-2 expression, IMCD-3 cell lines stably transfected with dominant-negative mutants of three JNKs (JNK-1, -2, and -3) were used. Hypertonicity-stimulated COX-2 protein expression was significantly reduced in dominant-negative JNK-2-expressing cells and was unchanged in dominant-negative JNK-1- and JNK-3-expressing cells compared with controls. The reduction of COX-2 expression was associated with greatly reduced viability of dominant-negative JNK-2-expressing cells during hypertonicity treatment. 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) (2–8 μm), an inhibitor of Src kinases, reduced the tonicity-stimulated COX-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas PP3, an inactive analog of PP2, had no effect. Inhibition of COX-2 activity by NS-398 (30–90 μm) and SC-58236 (10–20 μm) significantly reduced viability of mIMCD-K2 cells subjected to prolonged hypertonic treatment. We conclude that 1) all three members of the MAPK family (ERK, JNK-2, and p38) as well as Src kinases are required for tonicity-stimulated COX-2 expression in mouse collecting duct cells and that 2) COX-2 may play a role in cell survival of medullary cells under hypertonic conditions. We have previously shown that hypertonicity stimulates cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in cultured medullary epithelial cells.

Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F983-F996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that the osmotic responsiveness of cells is a complex process involving the participation of multiple mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).1 It has been shown in yeast that high osmolality glycerol (Hog1) kinase, the yeast homolog of p38 kinase, is activated by hypertonicity and is responsible for the induction of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the enzyme essential for production of glycerol, the major organic osmolyte in yeast (2Ruis H. Schüller C. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 3Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a yeast Hog1 deletion mutant is lethal under hypertonic conditions, and the lethality is rescued by overexpression of mammalian wild-type p38 (4Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar) or c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (5Galcheva-Gargova Z. Dérijard B. Wu I.H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The evidence supports a critical role of MAPKs in the regulation of osmolyte accumulation during osmotic stress in yeast. Several studies indicate that mammalian MAPKs may have a similar function in tonicity responses as their yeast homologs. Several groups have demonstrated that all three members of the MAPK family, p38, JNK, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), can be activated in mammalian cells by hypertonicity (6Moriguchi T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 800-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), hypertonicity was shown to selectively activate JNK-2, but not JNK-1, in mouse medullary epithelial cells, and a dominant-negative mutant of JNK-2 reduced cell viability under hypertonic conditions independent of inositol accumulation. Cyclooxygenase (COX) plays a key role in regulation of prostaglandin synthesis and is probably rate-limiting under some circumstances. Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified by molecular approaches, a constitutive form (COX-1) and an inducible form (COX-2). The two forms share similar enzymatic properties, but differ markedly with respect to cellular expression pattern and regulation. In general, COX-1 is expressed constitutively in a wide variety of tissues and is considered to have “housekeeping” functions. COX-2 is more restricted in its expression and can be dramatically induced in inflammatory cells by cytokines as well as by mitogenic factors (11Hershman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Inducibility is also a characteristic of COX-2 expression in a variety of organ systems, including the kidney. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that chronic salt loading (12Yang T. Singh I. Pham H. Sun D. Smart A. Schnermann J.B. Briggs J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F481-F489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or water deprivation (13Yang T. Schnermann J.B. Briggs J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 46: F1-F9Google Scholar) induced COX-2, but not COX-1, expression in the renal medulla in vivo and that hypertonicity induced COX-2, but not COX-1, expression in collecting duct cell lines in vitro. The present study examined the signaling pathway responsible for the tonicity-stimulated COX-2 expression in inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cell lines. We demonstrate that inhibition of any one of the three MAPKs p38, ERK, and JNK-2 by SB-203580, PD-58059, and a dominant-negative mutant, respectively, significantly suppressed hypertonicity-stimulated COX-2 expression in cultured medullary epithelial cells. Blockade of JNK-1 or JNK-3 was without effect, however. Inhibition of the Src kinase family by PP2 also suppressed hypertonicity-stimulated COX-2 expression. We further show that COX-2 inhibitors induced a marked reduction of cell viability of medullary epithelial cells under hypertonic conditions. Cell culture media and serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. PD-98059 was obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA), and SB-203580 from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Tyrphostin-23 and -51 and MTT tetrazolium salt were from Sigma. Anti-murine COX-2 polyclonal antibody and NS-398 were obtained from Cayman Chemical Co., Inc. (Ann Arbor MI). SC-58236 was a generous gift from Monsanto. mIMCD-K2 is an established inner medullary collecting duct cell line that was provided by Dr. Bruce Stanton (14Kizer Z.L. Lewis B. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 37: F347-F355Google Scholar). The cells were routinely propagated in Opti-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. JNK dominant-negative mutant cells were generated from the mouse IMCD-3 cell line provided by Dr. Steve Gullans (10Wojtaszek P.A. Heasley L.E. Siriwardana G. Berl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 800-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). IMCD-3 cells were propagated in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Generation of the three stable JNK dominant-negative cell lines has been described previously (10Wojtaszek P.A. Heasley L.E. Siriwardana G. Berl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 800-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in two independent clones of each stable cell line. Cells were lysed and sonicated in 30 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentrations were determined by Coomassie reagent. 100 μg of protein from the whole cell lysate were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked overnight with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, followed by incubation for 1 h with rabbit anti-murine COX-2 polyclonal antiserum at a dilution of 1:1000. After washing with Tris-buffered saline, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and visualized with ECL kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The assay was performed as described previously (15Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (4357) Google Scholar). Briefly, mIMCD-K2 cells grown in six-well plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 37 °C with 1 ml of MTT (1 mg/ml) for 2 h. After replacing the MTT solution with 1 ml of 1-propanol, cells were gently shaken at room temperature for 10 min. Absorbance at 540 and 690 nm was read in 20-μl samples in a spectrophotometer, and results are expressed as the difference between specific absorbance at 540 nm and background absorbance at 690 nm. PGE2 in the culture medium was measured with an enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical Co., Inc.). The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 25 or 50 μl of the medium, along with a serial dilution of PGE2 standard samples, were mixed with appropriate amounts of acetylcholinesterase-labeled tracer and PGE2 antiserum and incubated at room temperature for 18 h. After the wells were emptied and rinsed with wash buffer, 200 μl of Ellman's reagent containing substrate for acetylcholinesterase were added. The enzyme reaction was carried out on a slow shaker at room temperature for 1 h. The plates were read at 415 nm, and the results were analyzed by DeltaSOFT II software. Values represent means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test, with p < 0.05 being considered statistically significant. Confluent mIMCD-K2 cells were pretreated with SB-203580, PD-98059, or NS-398 for 30 min, followed by hypertonic treatment for 16 h. PGE2 release was determined by enzyme immunoassay. As we have shown previously (13Yang T. Schnermann J.B. Briggs J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 46: F1-F9Google Scholar), hypertonic treatment induced a 50-fold increase in PGE2 release from mIMCD-K2 cells. The stimulation was significantly suppressed by all three compounds (Fig.1). Among these inhibitors, SB-203580 exhibited the most potent effect, and it also abolished basal PGE2 release. Consistent with our previous observations (13Yang T. Schnermann J.B. Briggs J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 46: F1-F9Google Scholar), hypertonicity induced a marked increase in COX-2 protein expression in mIMCD-K2 cells. As shown in Figs. 2 and3, this stimulation was partially suppressed by both SB-203580 and PD-98059, commonly used inhibitors of p38 kinase and MEK1 (16Sheikh-Hamad D. Di Mari J. Suki W.N.

Combined treatment with the two inhibitors almost completely abolished the stimulatory effect of hypertonicity (Fig. 3 C). It has been reported that SB-203580 can inhibit cyclooxygenase activity (18Borsch-Haubold A.G. Pasquet S. Watson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28766-28772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the effect of SB-203580 might be a secondary consequence of COX inhibition, we examined the effect of SC-58236, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, on COX-2 expression in mIMCD-K2 cells. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of SB-203580 on COX-2 expression, SC-58236 stimulated COX-2 expression (Fig. 2 D).Figure 3Effect of the MEK1 inhibitor PD-98059 alone and in combination with SB-203580 on hypertonicity-stimulated COX-2 protein expression in cultured mIMCD-K2 cells.

Densitometric values of COX-2 protein from two independent clones of each cell line were averaged. Hypertonicity significantly induced COX-2 expression in neomycin control and JNK-1 and JNK-3 dominant-negative cell lines. In contrast, stimulation was significantly blunted in the two clones of the JNK-2 dominant-negative cell line (Fig. 4). COX-2 protein in JNK-2 dominant-negative cells in the basal state was also reduced compared with neomycin control and JNK-1 dominant-negative cell lines. The reduction of COX-2 expression was associated with greatly reduced viability of cells expressing dominant-negative JNK-2 during the hypertonic treatment as determined by MTT assay (Fig.5).Figure 5Cell viability of various stable JNK cell lines following exposure to hyperosmolarity. The stable IMCD cells were exposed to hyperosmolarity (600 mosmol/liter by addition of NaCl to the medium) for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay.

In contrast, PP2, an inhibitor of non-receptor Src tyrosine kinases (2–8 μm), significantly reduced tonicity-stimulated COX-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas PP3, an inactive analog of PP2, had no effect (Fig. 6 A). To test a potential function of COX-2 as a cytoprotective agent during an osmotic challenge, we examined the effect of COX-2 inhibitors on cell viability of mIMCD-K2 cells exposed to hypertonic medium. mIMCD-K2 cells were grown for 7 days in hypertonic or isotonic medium in the presence or absence of the COX-2-specific inhibitors NS-398 and SC-58236. To achieve maximal osmotic stress, the initial medium osmolarity of 600 mosmol/liter was increased over 3 days to 750 mosmol/liter by adding NaCl and was maintained at this level until day 7. Cell viability was assessed by morphological analysis (Fig.7) and MTT assay (Fig.8). Under hypertonic conditions, both NS-398 (30–90 μm) and SC-58236 (10–20 μm) significantly reduced cell viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner. These effects became apparent at 3 days and were maximal at 7 days of drug treatment. At this time, NS-398 (90 μm) and SC-58236 (20 μm) reduced the optical density from 0.095 ± 0.027 to 0.059 ± 0.020 (n = 4, p < 0.05) and 0.035 ± 0.008 (n = 4, p < 0.01), respectively. In contrast, neither drug had any obvious effect on cell viability under isotonic conditions.Figure 8Analysis of cell viability by MTT assay.Confluent mIMCD-K2 cells were treated with isotonic or hypertonic medium in the presence or absence of 90 μm NS-398 or 20 μm SC-58236 for 7 days.

In addition, the selective non-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 suppresses the stimulation of COX-2 by hypertonicity, whereas inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase has no effect. These findings indicate that activation of multiple MAPKs as well as non-receptor tyrosine kinases participates in the cytoplasmic signaling pathways that mediate the effect of hypertonicity on COX-2 expression in medullary epithelial cells. Finally, our data show that COX-2 inhibitors cause a marked reduction of cell viability of medullary epithelial cells under hypertonic, but not isotonic, conditions, supporting the notion of a cytoprotective function of COX-2 in the cellular response to hypertonicity. An impressive body of work has established that cells adapt to environmental hypertonicity by inducing a cluster of osmolyte-associated genes, including aldose reductase and the transporters for betaine, taurine, and myo-inositol. The expressed proteins are responsible for the synthesis or uptake of compatible organic osmolytes (1Burg MB. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F983-F996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kultz D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The complexity of the intracellular mechanisms mediating the response to environmental osmotic changes is revealed by recent observations that hypertonicity activates multiple protein kinases, including all three MAPKs p38, JNK, and ERK, as well as tyrosine kinases, including epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (20Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), and that activation of these kinases is associated with the induction of immediate early genes, includingEgr-1 and c-fos (21Zhang Z. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F837-F842PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cohen D.M. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F593-F600PubMed Google Scholar). It is well established that the p38 homolog Hog1 regulates the production of the major yeast osmolyte glycerol, a prerequisite for yeast growth under hypertonic conditions. Conflicting observations exist regarding the association of MAPKs with osmolyte accumulation in mammals (23Kultz D. Garcia-Perez A. Ferraris J.D. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13165-13170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24Nadkarni V. Gabbay K.H. Bohren K.M. Sheikh-Hamad D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that the function of MAPKs in the osmotic response in mammalian cells is not limited to regulating the accumulation of compatible osmolytes. In support of this notion is the finding that p38 and ERK play a role in hypotonicity-stimulated HSP-70 expression (16Sheikh-Hamad D. Di Mari J. Suki W.N. Safirstein R. Watts III, B.A. Rouse D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1832-1837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition, a study by Wojtaszek et al. (10Wojtaszek P.A. Heasley L.E. Siriwardana G. Berl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 800-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that a dominant-negative mutant of JNK-2 reduced cell viability without affecting inositol uptake. It appears that MAPKs are involved in the osmotic response in mammalian cells through more diverse mechanisms than in yeast and that the activation of multiple MAPK pathways may affect both osmolyte-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The major contribution of the present study is the demonstration that COX-2 is a target of MAPKs in mammalian cells during osmotic perturbations and that it exerts a cytoprotective function during hypertonic stress. The MAPK/COX-2 relationship appears to be a novel pathway in the overall osmotic response of mammalian cells that is probably dissociated from osmolyte accumulation. Using pharmacological blockade of p38 and ERK pathways and dominant-negative mutants of various forms of JNK (JNK-1, -2, and -3), we have demonstrated that interference with each of the three MAPK pathways significantly suppresses hypertonicity-stimulated COX-2 expression and that combined inhibition of p38 and ERK virtually completely abolishes the stimulation. This is consistent with the finding that MAPK inhibitors suppress hypertonicity-stimulated PGE2 release. The inhibition of COX activity by SB-203580 is particularly potent in that it abolishes even basal PGE2release. This is likely due to an inhibitory effect of SB-203580 on COX-2 expression and COX activity (18Borsch-Haubold A.G. Pasquet S. Watson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28766-28772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that all three MAPK pathways are required for the induction of COX-2 by hypertonicity and that the different MAPK pathways act in an additive fashion. Simultaneous activation of more than one MAPK pathway is also required for the stimulation of COX-2 expression by both cytokines (17Guan Z. Buckman S.Y. Miller B.W. Springer L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28670-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and ceramide (25Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that cooperative action of multiple MAPKs mediates the activation of COX-2 in response to various external stimuli. The detailed mechanism for MAPK-mediated activation of COX-2 expression is not clear. It is possible that the three MAPKs p38, ERK, and JNK-2 phosphorylate different transcription factors that form a complex and that bind to osmolality-responsive elements in the COX-2 promoter region. The specificity of the signaling pathway for a given stimulus is likely determined by differences in upstream mediators. However, the existence of various isoforms of MAPKs could also contribute to the specificity of the signaling. In support of this notion are the findings that hypertonicity selectively activates JNK-2, but not the other isoforms of JNK, and that hypertonicity-stimulated COX-2 is reduced only in JNK-2-expressing cells, but not in dominant-negative JNK-1- and JNK-3-expressing cells. It has been noted that tyrosine kinases are involved in the signaling mechanism for both cytokine- and mitogen-stimulated COX-2 expression in pancreatic islet and mesangial cells (26Corbett J.A.

We have previously shown that genistein significantly inhibited hypertonicity-stimulated COX-2 expression in mIMCD-K2 cells (13Yang T. Schnermann J.B. Briggs J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 46: F1-F9Google Scholar). Although it has been observed previously that hypertonicity can activate epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase in HeLa cells, blockade of this kinase with its specific inhibitors tyrphostin-23 and -51 had no effect in medullary epithelial cells. In contrast, PP2, an inhibitor of the non-receptor-linked tyrosine kinase of the Src family, significantly suppressed hypertonicity-stimulated COX-2 expression. This finding suggests that hypertonicity-stimulated COX-2 expression is associated with Src kinase activation. Concomitant activation of Src and MAPK has been shown previously to regulate COX-2 expression in breast cells (29Subbaramaiah K. Telang N. Ramonetti J.T. Araki R. DeVito B. Weksler B.B. Dannenberg A.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4424-4429PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lee R.J. Albanese C. Stenger R.J. Watanabe G. Inghirami G. Haines III, G.K. Webster M. Muller W.J. Brugge J.S. Davis R.J.

We speculate that Src kinases in renal medullary cells may be activated by osmotic stress and that they may function as osmosensors that transduce the signal to MAPKs, leading to activation of COX-2 expression. Our present results show that the COX-2 inhibitors NS-398 and SC-58236 reduced cell viability of medullary epithelial cells during exposure to hypertonicity, but had no obvious effect under isotonic conditions, supporting the cytoprotective function of COX-2 in medullary cells. This finding is consistent with a number of previous observations on the growth-promoting and cytoprotective function of COX-2. For example, it has been shown that inhibition of COX-2 induces cell death in cultured medullary interstitial cells and colon cancer cells (31Hao C.M. Kömhoff M. Guan Y. Redha R. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F352-F359PubMed Google Scholar, 32Sheng H. Shao J. Kirkland S.C. Isakson P. Coffey R.J. Morrow J. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2254-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) and that overexpression of COX-2 is protective against apoptosis in intestinal endothelial cells (33Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the cytoprotective action of COX-2 is not clear. Recent studies have demonstrated that 15-deoxy-Δ12–14-prostaglandin J2 is a natural ligand for the γ-isoform of the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor, an observation that, together with the presence of COX-2 in the nuclear envelope, establishes the existence of a nuclear pathway for the action of prostaglandins (34Forman B.M.

Physiol. 1997; 273: F1013-F1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) laboratories have demonstrated predominant expression of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-γ in the renal medulla, where COX-2 is abundantly expressed. These findings raise the possibility that COX-2 products may exert their cytoprotective role through nuclear receptors. In summary, our data show that inhibition of one of the three MAPKs p38, ERK, and JNK-2 significantly suppresses hypertonicity-stimulated COX-2 expression in cultured medullary epithelial cells. Selective inhibition of the Src kinase family by PP2 also suppresses the hypertonicity-stimulated COX-2 expression. Furthermore, COX-2 inhibitors induce a marked reduction of cell viability of medullary epithelial cells under hypertonic conditions. We conclude that hypertonicity stimulates COX-2 expression through activation of multiple MAPKs as well as Src kinases and that the induction of COX-2 may exert a specific cytoprotective function in the overall osmotic response of medullary epithelial cells."

Here we demonstrate that highly purified mammalian eIF2 contains an additional polypeptide of apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa. This polypeptide co-purified with eIF2 through five different chromatography procedures. A cDNA clone encoding the polypeptide was isolated, and its sequence closely matched that of a protein previously termed ABC50, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins. Antibodies to ABC50 co-immunoprecipitated eIF2 and vice versa, indicating that the two proteins interact. The presence of ABC50 had no effect upon the ability of eIF2 to bind GDP but markedly enhanced the association of methionyl-tRNA with the factor. Unlike the majority of ABC proteins, which are membrane-associated transporters, ABC50 associates with the ribosome and co-sediments in sucrose gradients with the 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits. The association of ABC50 with ribosomal subunits was increased by ATP and decreased by ADP. ABC50 is related to GCN20 and eEF3, two yeast ABC proteins that are not membrane-associated transporters and are instead implicated in mRNA translation and/or its control. Thus, these data identify ABC50 as a third ABC protein with a likely function in mRNA translation, which associates with eIF2 and with ribosomes.

One of the key initiation factors is eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2),1 a heterotrimeric protein (subunits α, β and γ) that binds guanine nucleotides and mediates the transfer of the initiator Met-tRNAi (as a ternary complex, eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi) to the 40 S ribosomal subunit (1Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). This step is required for all translation initiation events, and eIF2 is known to play an important role in the regulation of translation initiation under a variety of conditions (1Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar,2Price N.T. Proud C.G. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 748-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). At a late stage in the initiation process the GTP bound to eIF2 is hydrolyzed to GDP plus Pi and an inactive eIF2·GDP complex is released from the ribosome (reviewed in Refs. 1Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar and 3Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). GTP hydrolysis may be activated by the interaction of eIF2 with another translation factor, eIF5 (1Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Because the rate of dissociation of GDP from eIF2 is very low, regeneration of active eIF2·GTP requires an additional protein termed eIF2B (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor; reviewed in Ref. 3Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). eIF2B is a heteropentameric protein (subunits α–ε) and also plays an important role in the regulation of translation initiation (see below). The γ-subunit of eIF2 binds GDP or GTP (4Hannig E.M. Cigan A.M. Freeman B.A. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 506-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas eIF2α plays a regulatory role; phosphorylation of eIF2α at Ser51results in inhibition of the eIF2B-catalyzed recycling of eIF2 (reviewed in Refs. 2Price N.T. Proud C.G. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 748-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and 3Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2α is important in the overall regulation of translation in response to numerous different types of cell stress as discussed below. The role of eIF2β is less clear. There is data suggesting that it is required for Met-tRNAi binding (5Flynn A. Oldfield S. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and is involved in the selection of the start site for initiation of translation (6Donahue T.F. Cigan A.M. Pabich E.K. Valavicius B.C. Cell. 1988; 54: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Other studies have indicated that it interacts with eIF5 (7Das S. Maiti T. Das K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31712-31718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and with eIF2B (8Kimball S.R. Heinzinger N.K. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3039-3044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser51 in eIF2α is involved in the regulation of the activity of eIF2 and the overall rate of protein synthesis under a variety of conditions in eukaryotic organisms (9Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar). When phosphorylated on its α-subunit, eIF2 is a potent competitive inhibitor of eIF2B and thus causes inhibition of overall peptide chain initiation (9Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar). A number of kinases capable of phosphorylating Ser51 have been identified, these include the double-stranded RNA-activated eIF2α kinase RNA-dependent protein kinase (10Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 241-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the heme regulated kinase haem-regulated inhibitor (11Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and most recently, the endoplasmic reticulum-associated eIF2 kinase (RNA-dependent protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase/pancreatic eIF2α kinase (12Shi Y. Vattem K.M. Sood R. Liang J. Stramm L. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 17: 7499-7509Crossref Google Scholar, 13Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar)). In yeast, there is a further well characterized regulatory mechanism involving the phosphorylation of eIF2 by the protein kinase GCN2, which is believed to be activated by uncharged tRNA in response to amino acid starvation (14Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). GCN2 contains both a kinase domain and a region similar to histidinyl-tRNA synthetase that may bind tRNA. In yeast, inhibition of eIF2B through the phosphorylation of eIF2α leads to up-regulation of the translation of the mRNA encoding the transcriptional regulator GCN4, thus promoting transcription of genes encoding enzymes involved in amino acid biosynthesis (14Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The genetic tractability of yeast has allowed the identification of several other genes involved in this regulatory mechanism. These include GCN1 and GCN20, which are both required for the activation of GCN4 synthesis, and, in particular, the activation of the kinase GCN2, in response to amino acid deprivation (15Marton M.J. Crouch D. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3541-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Marton M.J. Hinnebusch A.G.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4474-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GCN20 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins and forms a complex with GCN1 that appears to be present upon elongating ribosomes, but the precise roles played by these proteins in the regulation of GCN2 remains to be established. Recent data indicate that higher eukaryotes also possess GCN2-like enzymes (18Santoyo J. Alcalde J. Mendez R. Pulido D. de Haro C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12544-12550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 19Sood R. Wek R.C. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 2196Google Scholar, 20Sood R. Porter A.C. Olsen D. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Genetics. 2000; 154: 787-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because cDNAs for such enzymes have been cloned from fruit flies and mammals. Indeed, it has been known for some years that manipulations that lead to accumulation of uncharged tRNA (e.g. incubation of rat liver cells without essential amino acids (21Everson W.V. Flaim K.E. Susco D.M. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C18-C27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), treatment of rat liver cells with an inhibitor of histidinyl-tRNA synthetase (histidinol) (22Kimball S.R. Antonetti D.A. Brawley R.M.

Clemens M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)) lead to increased phosphorylation of eIF2α, indicative of the operation of a GCN2-like system. Here we identify a protein that co-purifies and interacts with mammalian eIF2 and show that it is the rabbit homologue of human ABC50 which had previously been identified as a protein (with no known function) whose expression is elevated in tumor necrosis factor α-stimulated synoviocytes (25Richard M. Drouin R. Beaulieu A.D. Genomics. 1998; 53: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It contains the motifs of the ABC family of proteins and exhibits sequence similarity to the members of the eEF3 subfamily (which includes the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins eEF3 and GCN20) (25Richard M. Drouin R. Beaulieu A.D. Genomics. 1998; 53: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We show that mammalian ABC50, like yeast eEF3 and GCN20, is associated with the translational machinery. Unless otherwise indicated all chemicals and biochemicals were obtained from Sigma or Merck. eIF2 and eIF2B was purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysates or HeLa cell lysate essentially as described previously (26Oldfield S. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (using Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, Millipore) were carried out as detailed earlier (27Price N.T. Nakielny S.F. Clark S.J. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1008: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Blots were developed using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To obtain internal peptide sequence data for p110, preparations of eIF2 rich in this polypeptide (as assessed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the region of the gel containing p110 was excised. Cleavage of the protein using CNBr treatment, separation of the fragments by Tricine-SDS-PAGE, and transfer to Immobilon-P membrane were performed as described earlier (28Price N.T. Francia G.

Howland (Department of Biosciences, University of Kent at Canterbury) on a Procise 492 Protein Sequenator (PerkinElmer Biosystems) and phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were identified by on-line reverse-phased high pressure liquid chromatography utilizing a phenylthiohydantoin C18 column (2.1 × 220 mm, 5-mm particle size; PerkinElmer Biosystems). PerkinElmer Biosystems reagents and solvents were used where available. DNA or protein sequences were used to search the data bases available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site using the Advanced Gapped Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) program (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). DNA and protein sequences identified by these searches were recovered from the GenBankTM and GenProt data bases using the National Center for Biotechnology Information Entrez program. DNA and protein sequences were aligned using the ClustalW Multiple Sequence Alignment program at the European Bioinformatics Institute web site or the BLAST 2 sequences program at the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site. Shading and editing of these alignments was performed using the GeneDoc Multiple Sequence Alignment Editor and Shading Utility obtained from the Pittsburg Supercomputing Center web site. Total RNA (about 2 mg) was isolated from 1 g of rat testis tissue using TRIZOL® reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the mRNA (about 20 μg) was isolated from this total RNA using the Oligotex mRNA mini-prep kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA synthesis, using oligo(dT)15 as the primer was performed using Expand™ Reverse Transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The production of an [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) radiolabeled DNA probe for p110/ABC50 was achieved using the Random Primed Labeling Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with the primers p110 FOR 3 (5′-GTA CCA GCA GAA GCA GAA-3′) and p110 REV 2 (5′-CAG TCA GCA GCA GGA GTA-3′) and the rat testis cDNA generated above. DNA screening of a Stratagene UNI-ZAP™ rat skeletal muscle cDNA library was performed essentially as described by the supplier using this probe. Phage found to contain the p110 cDNA had the pBluescript SK(−) phagemid excised and isolated using the ExAssist/SOLRTMprotocol (Stratagene). The isolated phagemids were sequenced using T7 and T3 primers and the following primers: p110 FOR 1 (5′-AGTCATGGTCAACCGACCTC-3′), p110 FOR 2 (5′-GGCTTCTTTAACCAGCAGTA-3′), p110 FOR 3, p110 FOR 4 (5′-GTCTGTGCCAGCCAGTGAT-3′), p110 REV 1 (5′-TCACACACATCAAG-3′), p110 REV 2, p110 REV 3 (5′-CTGAGACTCCTCATCCTG-3′), p110 REV 4 (5′-TAGTTTCTCAGCGGCAGTA-3′), and p110 REV 5 (5′-GCCTGGGACACAGAGAAGTC-3′). The region of the rat p110 cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 169–1216 of GenBankTMsequence AF027302 was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction from the rat testis cDNA using the p110 FOR 5 (5′-CAAAGTAGTGAAGAAAGGC-3′) and p110 REV 2 primers andTaq DNA polymerase. The products were ligated into the pGEM-TEASY vector (Promega) and insert DNA sequenced as above. Rapid amplification of the 5′ end of the rat p110 cDNA was performed essentially as described previously (31Ausabel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidmann J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 15.27-15.32Google Scholar) using the p110 REV 4, p110 REV 3, or p110 REV 1 primer. The products were cloned into the pGEM-TEASY vector as above. Plasmid DNA was isolated, and insert DNA was sequenced. A peptide with sequence DEESQEAPELLKRPKEC was prepared by Kevin Howland (University of Kent at Canterbury) and used to generate a rabbit anti-p110 antiserum. The anti-p110 immunoglobulins were purified from this serum using the peptide cross-linked to Affi-gel (Bio-Rad) as described (32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Purified rabbit eIF2/p110 obtained from the purification procedure above (5–10 μg) was added to a mixture (final volume, 75 μl) consisting of IP buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.6, 0.07% (w/v) SDS, 0.7% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.7% (v/v) Triton X-100) and a 110 volume of either PBS, pH 7.6, or the following antisera as indicated in the results: preimmune antiserum from rabbits prior to injection with antigen, mouse monoclonal anti-eIF2α antiserum, or purified rabbit anti-p110 peptide antiserum. The reactions were mixed briefly and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. PANSORBIN® cell suspension (20 μl) in RIPA buffer (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 150 mm KCl, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) was then added to each reaction, mixed briefly, and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The suspensions were then centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 2 min in a benchtop microcentrifuge to pellet the antigen/antibody/PANSORBIN® cell complexes. The supernatants were removed, and the pellets were resuspended and washed in 500 μl of RIPA buffer. This wash procedure was repeated a further two times and, finally, once in 500 μl of PBS buffer. SDS-PAGE (2×) sample buffer (25 μl) was added to each of the final pellets which were then frozen at −80 °C and thawed to aid resuspension of the pellet. The samples were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. HEK 293 cells were maintained and passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v) and antibiotic/antimycotic (1% v/v; Life Technologies, Inc.). Lysis of cells at 70–80% confluency was achieved in ice-cold SDG100 buffer (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 1 μm microcystin) containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Nuclei and membranous material was removed by centrifugation (15 min at 3,500 × g, 4 °C). The cleared lysate was layered gently onto 0.8 msucrose (in SDG100 buffer) and centrifuged (2 h at 290,000 ×g, 4 °C) in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor. After centrifugation, the cleared lysate at the top of the cushion and the sucrose layer were removed separately, and after a brief rinse in 100 μl of PBS, pH 7.6, the ribosomal pellet was resuspended in SDG500 buffer (as SDG100 buffer except 500 mm KCl). The salt washed ribosomes were then centrifuged as before except using a 0.8 m sucrose cushion in SDG500 buffer. HEK 293 cells were maintained and lysed into SDG100 buffer (except at 7 mmMgCl2) + 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 as above. After the lysate had been cleared, it was layered onto 20–50% (w/v) sucrose gradients (15 ml, prepared in SDG100 buffer) and centrifuged (3.5 h at 110,000 × g, 4 °C) in a Beckman SW28.1 rotor. Where indicated in the results, ATP or ADP was added to the cleared lysate to give a final concentration of 5 mm, and this was then layered onto a gradient that contained 5 mm ATP or ADP as appropriate. Each gradient was fractionated using a Brandel model 184 Fractionator by displacement with 60% (w/v) sucrose at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The A 260 of the displaced gradient was analyzed in a 5-mm-path length ISCO Type 6 Optical Unit and recorded using an ISCO model UA-5 Absorbance/Fluorescence meter. Fractions (0.35 ml) were collected using a Gilson Microfraction model 203 fraction collector. Trichloroacetic acid precipitation of each of the fractions obtained was performed, and the precipitated samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting analysis. Gel filtration was performed using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superose 6 HR10/30 column on a Bio-Rad Biologic FPLC System. Protein samples were dialyzed into the column running buffer (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 150 mmKCl, 1 mm DTT, 5% (v/v) glycerol, unless otherwise indicated), and the dialysate (250 μl) was loaded onto the column and eluted in the running buffer at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions (300 μl) were collected, and peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the antisera indicated in the results. The column was calibrated using the standards from the molecular mass marker kit for gel filtration chromatography (molecular mass range, 12,000–200,000 Da; Sigma). The kit was supplemented with thyroglobulin (molecular mass, 669,000 Da) and apoferritin (443 000 Da) to increase the upper end of the calibration range. The standards were loaded and eluted under the same buffer and flow rate conditions as above. These assays were performed essentially as described previously (5Flynn A. Oldfield S. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of several preparations of eIF2 that had been isolated from rabbit reticulocytes as described previously (26Oldfield S. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) indicated the consistent presence of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 110 kDa in addition to the three subunits of eIF2 (Fig.1 A). This polypeptide (henceforth termed p110) appeared to co-elute with eIF2 from the later ion exchange column steps of our standard purification procedure (Fig.1 B). This co-purification of p110 with eIF2 was analyzed further as described below. To obtain information on the identity of this protein, the p110 protein band was excised from a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and cleaved with CNBr. After transfer to Immobilon-P membrane and Amido Black staining, five distinct bands were observed. These were excised, and the derived peptides were sequenced as described under “Materials and Methods” (Table I).Table IThe N-terminal sequence data obtained from the CNBr digestion of rabbit p110p110 peptide fragmentPeptide sequence obtained.Band 1No data obtainedBand 2(e/s)RLKKLXVPAXDBand 3E(r/f)LKKBand 4(S/Y/L)(Q/E/F/K)(N/T/G)(A/P/K)(Q/S)Band 5YQQKQKELLKQ(Y/C)EKQN-terminal sequence data for rabbit p110 were obtained as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data for the bands resolved by Tricine-SDS-PAGE are presented in order of slowest (band 1) to fastest (band 5) migrating fragments.

Open table in a new tab N-terminal sequence data for rabbit p110 were obtained as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data for the bands resolved by Tricine-SDS-PAGE are presented in order of slowest (band 1) to fastest (band 5) migrating fragments. Ambiguities in the assignment of residues are represented within parentheses by the potential candidates at that site. Lowercase letters indicate a low degree of certainty in the assignment of that residue, and X indicates an undefined residue. The data for bands 2 and 5, which gave the longest and clearest sequences, were used to search the data bases available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site. Note, band 3 appears to be a more complete digest of the same peptide fragment as band 2 because they both contain the same sequence in their first five residues, and band 4 appears to be a mixture of multiple fragments. At the time of the initial analysis, no sequences were identified in the nonredundant data base of sequences, suggesting that the p110 protein was novel. However, tBLASTn analysis of the data base of expressed sequence tags (dbEST) led to the identification of several mouse and human ESTs encoding for peptide sequences showing 100% identity to the band 5 sequence (when a Y residue was used at the location of the indicated ambiguity in Table I). Alignment of all the ESTs identified in this manner suggested that they all encoded the same protein (data not shown). The largest sequences were a 2,207-nt-long human EST (GenBankTM accession number U66677) and a 491-nt-long murine EST (GenBankTM accession number AA014138). No EST sequences containing the band 2 sequence were identified at this time. The polypeptide sequence predicted from the EST alignment appeared to be the C-terminal end of p110 because many of the ESTs identified contained an in-frame stop codon and a polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) downstream. To clone and sequence the cDNA encoding for p110, primers were designed for the production of an oligonucleotide probe by the polymerase chain reaction amplification of the cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 18–418 of the AA014138 sequence. This probe was used to screen a rat skeletal muscle cDNA library for phage containing the p110 cDNA. One clone was identified and the cDNA insert of its phagemid sequenced (GenBankTM accession number AF293383). Analysis of the insert sequence demonstrated that it was a chimeric molecule because approximately 700 nt encoded for rat parvalbumin and the remaining 2400 nt were found to show >95% identity to the alignment of the previously identified EST sequences and also 89% identity to a newly submitted human cDNA sequence for a protein of unknown function that had been termed ABC50 (with GenBankTMaccession number AF027302 and GenProt accession number AAC70891). The mRNA for this protein had been identified by virtue of its increased expression in synoviocytes stimulated with tumor necrosis factor α (25Richard M. Drouin R. Beaulieu A.D. Genomics. 1998; 53: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The band 2/band 3 and band 5 sequences in Table I were all present in the ABC50 protein sequence. Thus, the rabbit and rat p110 proteins were identified as homologues of the human ABC50 protein. Alignment of the rat p110 cDNA sequence from the phagemid insert with the ABC50 cDNA indicated that the rat sequence lacked approximately 800 nt from its 5′ end. To obtain these missing sequence data, the published ABC50 cDNA sequence was used in BLAST searches to identify rat EST sequences for the 5′ end of the rat cDNA. None were found that corresponded directly to the extreme 5′ end of the ABC50 cDNA sequence, but an EST (GenBankTM accession number H34173) corresponding to nucleotides 168–406 of AF027302 was identified. Using this EST sequence, a polymerase chain reaction primer was designed for the amplification of the rat p110 cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 169–1216 of AF027302 as described under “Materials and Methods.” Using this strategy, the sequence data were extended to within 169 nt of the 5′ end of the published human sequence. To extend this sequence further, 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends reactions were attempted but proved unsuccessful, and no further sequence data were obtained for the rat p110 cDNA. The sequence data obtained for the rat p110 cDNA were aligned with that of the human ABC50 cDNA and found to exhibit 88% identity. The most significant difference between the two sequences was the presence of an 102-nt insert in the rat cDNA (between nucleotides 745 and 746 of AF027302). The rat p110 cDNA sequence was translated using the Translate tool at the ExPASy web site, and the sequence predicted was used to perform BLAST searches of the National Center for Biotechnology Information data bases. The sequences showing the highest similarity to the rat p110 protein were aligned using the ClustalW program at the European Bioinformatics Institute web site, and this alignment was edited using the GeneDoc program (data not shown). From this alignment, the rat p110 protein sequence was found to be 88% identical and 91% similar to ABC50, with a 34-amino acid insert (because of the nucleotide sequence insert noted above) occurring between residues 217 and 218 of the AAC70891 sequence. However, two human EST sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers AA083604and AA587878) as well as several murine ESTs were identified, which showed high identity (>90%) to this insert sequence, suggesting that two or more isoforms of p110/ABC50 may occur within mammals. In addition, searches of the public data bases revealed four uncharacterized proteins from Caenorhabditis elegans, an uncharacterized protein from Drosophila melanogaster, an uncharacterized protein from Arabadopsis thaliana, an uncharacterized protein from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and two characterized proteins from S. cerevisiae that show >35% identity/>55% similarity to the p110/ABC50 sequences (summarized"

In this study we have employed molecular approaches to further investigate the mechanism by which Vpr exerts its regulatory effect upon the LTR. We show that by structural and functional interaction with Tat, a potent viral regulatory protein, Vpr synergistically enhances the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 LTR. Because Tat utilizes cyclin T1 and its partner, CDK9 to elevate the level of transcription from the LTR, we examined the cooperativity between Vpr, Tat, and cyclin T1/CDK9 on viral gene transcription. Results from co-transfection studies indicated superactivation of LTR by Tat and cyclin T1/CDK9 in the presence of wild type Vpr. This activation was not observed with the R73S mutant of Vpr, which contains arginine to serine transition at residue 73. Interestingly, expression of R73S mutant in cells exerts a negative effect on the observed superactivation of the LTR by Tat, cyclin T1/CDK9, and wild type Vpr. Results from protein-protein interaction studies indicated that Vpr is associated with both Tat and cyclin T1 in cells expressing these proteins. Use of deletion mutant proteins in binding studies revealed that the binding sites for Tat and Vpr within cyclin T1 are distinct and that association of these two viral proteins with cyclin T1 is independent from each other. These observations suggest a working model on the cooperative interaction of Vpr with viral and cellular proteins and its involvement in control of viral gene transcription and replication. Moreover identification of R73S mutant of Vpr provides a new therapeutic avenue for controlling HIV-1 gene transcription and replication in the infected cells.

Because of its association with the p6 region of the p55gag precursor (1Paxton W. Connor R.I. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7229-7237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Vpr is efficiently packaged into virions (2Cohen E.A. Dehni G. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3097-3099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vpr has been considered a late gene product, although recent studies have implicated a functional role at the immediate-early phase during HIV-1 infection (3Hrimech M. Yao X.J. Bachand F. Rougeau N. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4101-4109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vpr enhances viral replication in nondividing macrophages and causes proliferating human cells to undergo an arrest or delay in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (4Emerman M. Curr. Bio. 1996; 6: 1096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 5He J. Choe S. Walker R. Di Marzio P. Morgan D.O. Landau N. J.

This latter property of Vpr serves to amplify the activity of the viral promoter and enhances the replication of HIV-1 (7Cohen E.A. Lu Y. Gottlinger H. Dehni G. Jalinoos Y. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1990; 3: 601-608PubMed Google Scholar, 8Goh W.C. Rogel M.E. Kinsey C.M. Michael S.F. Fultz P.N. Nowak M.A. Hahn B.H. Emerman M. Nat.

The mechanisms by which Vpr modulates progression of the cell cycle and transcriptional activation of HIV-1 are not fully understood. Many of the determinants of cell cycle arrest reside in the arginine-rich COOH-terminal portion of the Vpr protein (10Di Marzio P. Choe S. Ebright M. Knoblauch R. Landau N. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7909-7916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zhou Y. Lu Y. Ratner L. Virology. 1998; 242: 414-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This COOH-terminal region most closely resembles a canonical nuclear localization signal; however, this region can be deleted with no impairment of nuclear localization (10Di Marzio P. Choe S. Ebright M. Knoblauch R. Landau N. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7909-7916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of the HIV-1 LTR by Vpr was shown to be mediated, at least in part, through its direct interaction with the cellular transcription factor Sp1, which binds to the GC-rich DNA sequence of LTR (12Sawaya B.E.

Singer G. Feng Y. Park K. Zhao L.J. Gene (Amst. ). 1998; 212: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Vpr also associates with a number of cellular factors including p300 and TFIIB and modulates the activity of the HIV-1 LTR (13Wang L. Mukherjee S. Jia F. Narayan O. Zhao L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25564-25569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 15Agostini I. Navarro J.M. Rey F. Bouhamdan M. Spire B. Vigne R. Sire J. J. Mol.

A. 1998; 95: 5281-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some of these factors also cooperate with the viral potent transcriptional activator, Tat (17Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C. Burny A. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. Benkirane M. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6018-6106Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 18Xiao H. Lis J.T. Jeang K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6898-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that Tat activation of LTR transcription is mediated through its binding to TAR RNA sequence located at the 5′ end of nascent viral transcripts (19Berkhout B. Silverman R.H. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1989; 59: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have demonstrated that Tat has the ability to enhance HIV-1 LTR activity in the absence of TAR in cells derived from the central nervous system as well as in lymphoid cells under certain physiologic conditions (20Harrich D. Garcia J. Mitsuyasu R. Gaynor R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4417-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 21Taylor J.P. Pomerantz R. Bagasra O. Chowdhury M. Rappaport J. Khalili K. Amini S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3395-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Further studies have revealed that TAR-independent activation of the LTR can be mediated by NF-κB proteins (21Taylor J.P. Pomerantz R. Bagasra O. Chowdhury M. Rappaport J. Khalili K. Amini S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3395-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Taylor J.P. Pomerantz R.J. Raj G.V. Kashanchi F. Brady J.N. Amini S. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3971-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tat also binds with high affinity and specificity to cyclin T1, an event that is believed to induce the elongation process of RNA polymerase II (23Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 24Shilatifard A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The 87-kDa cyclin T1 binds to the cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK9 (PITALRE) to form a complex called p-TEFb (positive transcriptionelongation -factor b) (25Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). According to one model, although Tat/p-TEFb complexes bind to TAR, CDK9 phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, and that enhances the level of viral gene transcription (26Fujinaga K. Cujec T.P. Peng J. Garriga J. Price D.H. Grana X. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Tat and Vpr are involved in the activation of the HIV-1 LTR through either the interaction with several common cellular regulatory proteins (13Wang L. Mukherjee S. Jia F. Narayan O. Zhao L.J.

Virus Genes. 1989; 3: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we focused our attention on the structural and functional interplay between these two viral proteins. In this study we provide evidence for the physical interaction of Vpr with Tat and demonstrate that cooperativity between Tat, Vpr, cyclin T1, and CDK9 is functionally significant because it leads to up-regulation of viral gene transcription. HIV-1 LTR Luciferase reporter plasmid was a gift from Nicole Israel (Pasteur Institute). To construct CMV-HA-Tat, a 300-bp Tat cDNA from pcDNA3-Tat was excised upon treatment of the DNA with BamHI-EcoRI, and the fragment was inserted into HindIII-BamHI sites of pcDNA3-HA. The plasmid pEBV-His B-Vpr contains the coding region of the Vpr gene cloned downstream of a histidine epitope tag. HIV-1 glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-Tat expression vectors (1–86), (1–72), (1–48), and (Δ2–36) were obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program of the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). GST-Tat (1–67), (1–50), (1–40), (20–72), (30–72), (40–72), and (50–72) were a gift from K.T.Jeang (Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). PGEX-2T-Cyclin (wild type and deletion mutants) were described by Fujinaga et al. (28Fujinaga K. Taube R. Wimmer J. Cujec T.P. Peterlin B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U A. 1999; 96: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). pCDNA3-CDK9 and GST-CDK9 were a gift from A. Giordano (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). CMV-Cyclin T1 and CMV-HA-Cyclin T1 full-length constructs were a gift from D. H. Price (University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa) and K. Jones (The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA). To create a chimeric proviral HIV-1, a 100-bp DNA fragment from CMV-Vpr R73S was inserted in place of EcoRI-SalI sites of the wild type proviral pNL4–3. To construct EYFP-Tat, a 300-bp cDNA was excised with BamHI-EcoRI from pcDNA3-Tat and inserted into BglII-EcoRI sites of EYFP. To generate ECFP-Vpr wild type, a 300-bp cDNA was excised with BamHI-HindIII from pGEX-2T-Vpr (gift from Joseph Kulkowski, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA) and inserted into BglII-HindIII sites of ECFP. Purified primary human fetal central nervous system cultures were prepared from 12–16-week-old human fetal brain tissue (purchased from Advanced Bioscience Resources, Inc, Alameda, CA) by a modified procedure based on the methods of Cole and de Vellis (29Cole R. de Vellis J. Federoff S. Richardson A. Protocols for Neural Cell Culture. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 117-130Crossref Google Scholar) and Yong and Antel (30Yong V.W. Antel J.P. Federoff S. Richardson A. Protocols for Neural Cell Culture. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 157-172Crossref Google Scholar). Human astrocytic glial cell line U-87MG was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Human lymphocytic T-cells, CEMx174, were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells (5 × 105) cultured on 60-mm plates and grown overnight were transfected by the Lipofectine method for primary human fetal central nervous system cultures or by DEAE-dextran method for CEMx174. 1-ml aliquots of supernatant were taken at days 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 for p24 ELISA analysis (Coulter-Immunotech). Primary human fetal microglia or astrocytes were transfected with 0.1 μg of reporter plasmid (LTR-luciferase) or co-transfected with reporter DNA and 0.5–0.75 μg of various expression vectors. To control the concentration of the promoter DNA sequence in transfection, pcDNA3 empty plasmid DNA was added to the transfection mixture. Each transfection was repeated a minimum of three separate times with at least three different plasmid preparations. Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection, and Luciferase assays were performed (Promega, Madison, WI). HIV-1 GST-Tat, GST-Vpr, and GST-cyclin T1 fusion proteins were prokaryotically expressed and purified as described (31Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The integrity and purity of the GST fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Known amounts of bovine serum albumin were included on the same gel for determination of the yield of the full-length proteins. Radiolabeled Vpr, cyclin T1, and Tat proteins were synthesized with the TNT-coupled wheat germ extract system according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega, Madison, WI). For in vitro binding assays, 3 μl of35S-labeled in vitro translated Vpr, cyclin T1, or Tat were incubated with 5 μg of GST or fusion proteins GST-Tat (full-length or deletion mutants), GST-Vpr (wild type or mutant), or GST-cyclin T1 (full-length or deletion mutants), coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads in 300 μl of LB 150 for 1 h at 4 °C with continuous rocking. After the incubation, the beads were pelleted and washed five times with LB 150 buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, were heated to 95 °C for 10 min, and were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. U-87MG cells were transfected with 5 μg of a plasmid encoding wild type pEBV-His B-Vpr and/or 5 μg of a plasmid encoding pcDNA-HA-cyclin T1 and/or 5 μg of a plasmid encoding pcDNA-HA-Tat 86. 48 h post-transfection, cell extracts (300 μg/immunoprecipitated sample) derived from the transfected cells were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with a T7-antibody, which recognizes the His portion in pEBV-His B-Vpr, or with anti-HA (12CA5; from Roche Molecular Biochemicals), which recognizes the HA portion of either pcDNA-HA-cyclin T1 or Tat. The procedure used in Western blots has been described previously (12Sawaya B.E. Khalili K. Mercer W.E. Denisova L. Amini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20052-20057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). p24 antigen capture ELISA for tissue culture supernatants was performed as described by the manufacturer (Coulter-Immunotech). Each sample was assayed over 10,000-fold range of dilution to ensure quantitation was based on an OD value within the linear range of the standards. We utilized primary culture of human microglial cells to investigate the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 LTR. As shown in Fig.1 A, expression of Tat significantly enhanced transcription of the viral promoter in these cell cultures (compare lane 1 with lane 2). Similarly, transfection of these cells in the presence of Vpr alone caused a modest activation of HIV-1 LTR (lane 3). Co-expression of Vpr and Tat led to a synergistic activation of viral transcription (lane 4), suggesting that these two viral proteins cooperate with each other to enhance the function of the HIV-1 LTR. We determined whether enhanced activation of HIV-1 LTR by Tat and Vpr is mediated through direct interaction between Tat and Vpr proteins. First, we examined the ability of these two proteins to interact with each other. When Tat and Vpr were radiolabeled with 35S byin vitro translation and incubated with either GST, GST-Vpr, or GST-Tat fusion protein coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads, we found that 35S-labeled Tat was retained by the GST-Vpr fusion protein (Fig. 1 B), and 35S-labeled Vpr was retained by the GST-Tat fusion protein (Fig. 1 C). The control GST alone was unable to retain either Tat or Vpr (Fig. 1,B and C). These data permit the conclusion that these two proteins interact with each other in an in vitrosystem. A similar binding assay was performed with deletion mutants of Tat, and the results revealed that the region responsible for binding of Vpr is located between amino acids 50–67 of the Tat protein (data not shown). This domain has been shown to serve as the binding site for several cellular factors including Sp1 and Purα (18Xiao H. Lis J.T. Jeang K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6898-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32Gallia G.L. Darbinian N. Tretiakova A. Ansari S.A. Rappaport J. Brady J. Wortman M.J. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1623-1628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that ectopic expression of Tat in cells results in an accumulation of this protein in the nucleus and the nucleolus (33Efthymiadis A. Briggs L.J. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1623-1628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), whereas wild type Vpr localizes to the nucleus and, to a lesser extent, to the cytoplasm (34Mahalingam S. Collman R.G. Patel M. Monken C.E. Srinivasan A. Virology. 1995; 212: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine subcellular localization of these two proteins in the cells expressing both proteins, human astrocytic glial cells, U-87MG were transfected with various DNA plasmids expressing Tat or Vpr fused to either the yellow or cyan fluorescent proteins, respectively (EYFP and ECFP). As shown in Fig. 1 D, EYFP-Tat was found only in the nucleus (top panel), whereas ECFP-Vpr is localized in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm (middle panel). As shown in the bottom panel, Tat and Vpr fusion proteins were detected in the same cell compartment. The control EYFP and ECFP proteins exhibited no evidence of subcellular localization (data not shown). As described earlier, cyclin T1 binds to CDK9 to form the pTEF-b complex (23Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 35Gold M.O. Yang X. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4448-4453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a part of this complex, cyclin T1 is involved in the phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus of RNA polymerase II, which is important in the elongation process of LTR transcription mediated by Tat (23Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 36Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Because the later event requires the interaction between Tat and cyclin T1, we determined whether this binding is affected by Vpr. Plasmids encoding HA-Tat (CMV-HA-Tat), HA-cyclin T1 (CMV-HA-cyclin T), or His-Vpr (EBV-His-Vpr) were introduced into U-87MG cells. Extracts of transfected cells were obtained 48 h after transfection and were co-immunoprecipitated with either T7-antibody, which recognizes the His-tag (Fig.2 A), or with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2 B). Preimmune serum was used as a control for nonspecific binding (Fig. 2, A and B,lanes 2 and 5). The specificity of the antibodies was confirmed by the use of nuclear extracts from nontransfected cells (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 3) or nuclear extracts from cells transfected with either Vpr (Fig. 2 A,lane 9) or cyclin T1 (Fig. 2 B, lane 9). As anticipated, Tat was associated with cyclin T1 (Fig.2 A, lane 7), and surprisingly, Vpr was also able to bind Tat and cyclin T1 (Fig. 2, A, lanes 6 and8, and B, lanes 6–8). These results permit the conclusion that Vpr, in addition to its already established functions, plays a role in the formation of a ternary complex, Tat-Vpr-cyclin T1, and might act as an anchor between Tat and cyclin T1. Furthermore, Vpr is required for optimal transactivation by Tat and therefore might play a role at the early phase of infection. This is in part supported by previous observations, suggesting a potential role for Vpr in the early phase of infection (3Hrimech M. Yao X.J. Bachand F. Rougeau N. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4101-4109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2Cooperative interaction of Vpr with Tat and cellular proteins cyclin T1 and CDK9. Cell lysates were prepared from glial cells transfected with plasmids expressing wild type Vpr fused to T7-His or Tat fused to HA or Cyclin T1 fused to HA. Approximately 300 μg of extract were utilized in immunoprecipitations followed by Western blot utilizing anti-HA (A, lanes 1–9) and anti-T7 (B, lanes 1–9) antibodies. In parallel, 100 μg of extracts were utilized by direct Western blot assay (lanes 1 and 4 of each panel). Preimmune serum was used to verify the specificity of binding (lanes 2 and 5 of each panel). Arrowsdepict the positions of the 87-kDa Cyclin T1 and 14-kDa Vpr.

C, transcriptional activity of Vpr, CDK9, Cyclin T1, and Tat upon the HIV-1 LTR promoter.

Luciferase activity was determined 48 h after transfection. The values shown on thetop of each bar represent the fold activation over the basal HIV-1 LTR promoter arbitrarily set at one. The data represent the mean values of at least three separate transfection experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The formation of a ternary complex prompted us to investigate the implication of these observations in the regulation of LTR transcription. As before, Tat significantly stimulated transcription of HIV-1 LTR in human primary microglial cells (Fig. 2 C,lane 2). Transfection of microglial cells in the presence of plasmids expressing Tat and cyclin T1 or expressing Tat and CDK9 enhanced the level of HIV-1 LTR transcription about 125- and 100-fold, respectively (Fig. 2 C, lanes 4 and 5). In the presence of three expressor plasmids, Tat, cyclin T1, and CDK9, LTR activity was further elevated (135-fold) (Fig. 2 C,lane 6). Vpr stimulated, albeit modestly, transcription of the HIV-1 LTR in human primary microglial cells (Fig. 2 C, lane 3). Transfection in the presence of the plasmids expressing Vpr and cyclin T1 or expressing Vpr and CDK9, augmented the HIV-1 LTR activity about 100- and 150-fold, respectively (Fig. 2 C, lanes 7and 8). Interestingly, simultaneous transfection with plasmids expressing, Vpr, cyclin T1, and CDK9 activated the HIV-1 LTR only about 10 fold (Fig. 2 C, lane 9). HIV-1 LTR was also activated when plasmids expressing Vpr, Tat, and cyclin T1 or Vpr, Tat, and CDK9 were transfected together (Fig. 2 C,lanes 10 and 11, respectively). The activity of the HIV-1 LTR was superenhanced (about 900-fold) when all the expression vectors for Tat, Vpr, cyclin T1, and CDK9 were co-introduced into the cells (lane 12). These data support the conclusion that these proteins work together to modulate the function of HIV-LTR. Evidently, functional interaction of Vpr with either cyclin T1 or CDK9, but not cyclin T1 plus CDK9, results in stimulation of Vpr-mediated transcription of LTR in microglial cells. In the presence of Tat, however, Vpr has the ability to cooperate with both cyclin T1 plus CDK9 and synergizes the stimulatory effect of these proteins upon LTR transcription. To gain more information regarding the interaction between Vpr, Tat, and the cyclin T1/CDK9 complex, we performed binding experiments to determine whether Vpr and Tat share a common binding site on cyclin T1. The region encompassing amino acids 250–300 within the cyclin T1 protein has been previously shown to be important for complexation between Tat and cyclin T1 (28Fujinaga K. Taube R. Wimmer J. Cujec T.P. Peterlin B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U A. 1999; 96: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Full-length cyclin T1 protein and its deletion mutant proteins were utilized in GST pull-down assay. We found that35S-labeled Tat was retained by the GST-cyclin T1 (), (), and () fusion proteins and not by GST-cyclin T1 () fusion protein (Fig. 3). Further, 35S-labeled Vpr was retained by the GST-cyclin T1 () and () fusion proteins and not by GST-cyclin T1 () or () fusion proteins (Fig. 3). GST alone was unable to retain either Tat or Vpr. Reciprocal experiments utilizing radiolabeled cyclin T1 and its mutant variants in GST pull-down assay using GST-Tat and GST-Vpr confirmed these observations and indicated that the region encompassing amino acids 300–479 is important for cyclin T1-Vpr interaction. As seen, the binding region of Vpr-cyclin T1 is different from the one described previously for Tat-cyclin T1 (28Fujinaga K. Taube R. Wimmer J. Cujec T.P. Peterlin B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U A. 1999; 96: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that Tat and Vpr may bind to cyclin T1 separately and independent of each other. In previous studies we demonstrated that mutant R73S of Vpr can function as a transdominant protein and inhibit the effect of wild type Vpr on either the regulation of the cell cycle or the activation of HIV-LTR (37Sawaya B.E. Khalili K. Rappaport J. Serio D. Chen W. Srinivasan A. Amini S. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 38Sawaya B.E. Khalili K. Gordon J. Srinivasan A. Richardson M. Rappaport J. Amini S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4781-4877Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, we evaluated the ability of R73S in cooperating with cyclin T1, CDK9, and Tat in modulating HIV-1 LTR activity and viral replication. First, we determined the ability of this mutant to bind either Tat or cyclin T1. Tat was radiolabeled with 35S by in vitro translation and incubated with either GST or GST-Vpr (R73S) fusion protein coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The GST-Vpr (R73S) fusion protein retained 35S-labeled Tat (Fig.4 A, lane 4); GST alone failed to retain 35S-labeled Tat (Fig. 4 A,lane 3). Reciprocally, R73S was radiolabeled with35S by in vitro translation, and incubated with GST, GST-CDK9, GST-cyclin T1, or GST-Tat fusion proteins, coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. As shown in Fig. 4 B, The GST-cyclin T1 and GST-Tat fusion proteins retained35S-labeled mutant Vpr (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5 and 6) but not GST alone or GST-CDK9 (Fig.4 B, lanes 3 and 4). We then determined the ability of mutated Vpr (R73S) to affect the activation of the HIV-1 LTR. A series of transient transfection assays were performed with primary cultures of human microglial cells (Fig.4 C). The cells were transfected with LTR-luciferase alone or with expression vectors for wild type Vpr, Tat, cyclin T1, CDK9, and Vpr mutant, separately or in various combinations. Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection, and luciferase assays were performed. Surprisingly, mutant R73S was able to inhibit transcription of the HIV-1 LTR in every case (lanes 6, 11,12, 13, 15, and 16). This is an interesting observation in light of the protein binding data shown in A and B of Fig. 4, suggesting that although mutant R73S retains its ability to interact with Tat and cyclin T1, unlike the wild type Vpr, this mutant may not positively cooperate with these activators and synergize their activities. In contrast, it is evident that the functional interaction of R73S with Tat and its partner cyclin T1 abrogates their stimulatory effect upon the LTR transcription. Finally, we determined the effect of R73S on the expression of the HIV-1 LTR in infected cells. The three proviral genomes, pNL4–3 wild type, pNL4–3-Vpr (R73S), and pNL4–3 ΔVpr, were introduced into lymphocytic T-cells, CEMx174, along with LTR-luciferase plasmid. The effects of wild type or mutant Vpr were evaluated through either luciferase (Fig. 4 D) or a p24 antigen ELISA (Fig.4 E). As expected the proviral DNA pNL4–3 lacking Vpr failed to activate expression of the HIV-1 LTR to the same level as pNL4–3 (Fig. 4 D, compare lanes 1 and 2). These observations suggest that although in the absence of Vpr, Tat can enhance transcription of the viral LTR, in the presence of Vpr, this activity is much higher, perhaps because of the association of Vpr with Tat and its cellular partners, i.e. cyclin T and CDK9. The proviral DNA pNL4–3 (R73S) decreased dramatically the activation of HIV-1 gene by more than 80% (Fig. 4 D, comparelanes 1 and 3). This is in accord with earlier observations (37Sawaya B.E. Khalili K. Rappaport J. Serio D. Chen W. Srinivasan A. Amini S. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) on the dominant negative activity of Vpr mutant R73S and suggests that this mutant of Vpr, by associating with Tat and its associated cellular factors, decreases their ability to stimulate transcription of the LTR. Viruses released into the medium were collected 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 days post-transfection and quantitated by p24 antigen ELISA (Fig. 4 E). The chimeric virus pNL4–3 Vpr mutant (R73S) reduced the level of p24 by 75% (compare open circles to solid symbols). This reduction was observed for as long as 15 days post-infection. In this work, we show that Tat can interact with Vpr and that their complexation may be physiologically important for optimal replication of HIV-1. Interestingly, Vpr also interacts with the cellular protein, cyclin T1, which plays a role in Tat-induced transcription of the viral LTR. Moreover, our results have shown a contribution of wild type Vpr and cyclin T1 toward Tat transactivation activity. Further, the activation of HIV-1 LTR by Vpr appears stronger in the presence of cyclin T1 and Tat. By binding to cyclin T1, Vpr adds a new role to its functions. As a part of the p-TEFb complex, cyclin T1 has been shown to be involved in phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal of RNA polymerase II. Although the involvement of Vpr in phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II remains unclear, it is interesting to note the earlier observations demonstrating that Vpr may act upstream of the p34 cdc2 kinase and, by preventing the dephosphorylation of p34 cdc2 kinase, inhibit the progression of cells into mitosis (6Re F. Braten D. Frank E. Luban J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6859-6864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation implicates a possible involvement of protein phosphatase (s) in the effects of Vpr. Also, Vpr plays a role in phosphorylation in yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and in human cells (39Zhao Y. Cao J. O'Gorman M.R., Yu, M. Yogev R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5821-5826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate for the first time the physical link between the two HIV-1 regulatory proteins, Tat and Vpr. Because both Vpr and Tat bind to RNA, we also examined the importance of RNA molecules for the association of Tat and Vpr. We found that treatment of the Vpr-Tat complex with RNase severely affects the level of Vpr interaction with Tat (data not shown). Results from functional studies indicated that the mutant Vpr, R73S, can abrogate Tat-induced transcription of the viral LTR. Accordingly, the virus with mutant R73S poorly replicated in cells and suppressed the effect of Tat on transactivation of the viral LTR. The optimal replication of HIV-1 seems unaffected by the interaction observed between Vpr and cyclin T1 but is decreased when a point mutation is generated in Vpr at position 73 (converting arginine to serine). The R73S mutant of Vpr represses the expression of HIV-LTR even in the presence of wild type Vpr and Tat. This finding suggests that direct interaction of the mutant Vpr with Tat or wild type Vpr results in the formation of a complex that is transcriptionally nonproductive. This notion is supported by earlier binding results demonstrating in vitroand in vivo dimerization of mutant R73S Vpr with wild type Vpr (38Sawaya B.E. Khalili K. Gordon J. Srinivasan A. Richardson M. Rappaport J. Amini S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4781-4877Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The observed inhibition of viral replication with the chimeric Vpr R73S is intriguing because it suggests the potential use of a chimeric protein or small peptide for therapeutic purposes. In addition, the Vpr mutant proteins might be useful for dissecting the steps involved in regulation of HIV-1 gene transcription and identification of the cellular proteins that by communication with viral and cellular proteins orchestrate the viral infection cycle. Also, results from the studies presented here show that in addition to its interaction with Tat, cyclin T1 can be associated with the other viral protein,i.e. Vpr, and this interaction results in enhancement of Vpr transcriptional activity. More recently, we have demonstrated that cooperative interaction of cyclin T1 with Tat and Vpr increases expression of several immunoregulatory genes including tumor necrosis factor α (data not shown). This is an interesting observation because the level of tumor necrosis factor α is shown to be elevated in AIDS patients in particular in brain cells (data not shown). Thus, the observed cooperativity between Tat and Vpr with cyclin T1 may have a broader implication both in control of the HIV-1 LTR and several responsive cellular genes.

At least four distinct mammalian family members have now been described, including PRMT1, PRMT3, CARM1/PRMT4, and JBP1/PRMT5. To more fully define the physiological role of PRMT3, we characterized its unique putative zinc-finger domain and how it can affect its enzymatic activity. Here we show that PRMT3 does contain a single zinc-finger domain in its amino terminus. Although the zinc-liganded form of this domain is not required for methylation of an artificial substrate such as the glutathione S-transferase-fibrillarin amino-terminal fusion protein (GST-GAR), it is required for the enzyme to recognize RNA-associated substrates in RAT1 cell extracts. The recombinant form of PRMT3 is inhibited by high concentrations of ZnCl2 as well as N-ethylmaleimide, reagents that can modify cysteine sulfhydryl groups. We found that we could distinguish PRMT family members by their sensitivity to these reagents; JBP1/PRMT5 and Hsl7 methyltransferases were inhibited in a similar manner as PRMT3, whereas Rmt1, PRMT1, and CARM1/PRMT4 were not affected. We were also able to define differences in these enzymes by their sensitivity to inhibition by Tris and free arginine. Finally, we found that the treatment of RAT1 cell extracts with N-ethylmaleimide leads to a loss of the major PRMT1-associated activity that was immune to inhibition under the same conditions as a GST fusion protein. These results suggest that native forms of PRMTs can have different properties than their GST-catalytic chain fusion protein counterparts, which may lack associated noncatalytic subunits.

Recently, a potential candidate for a type II enzyme, JBP1/PRMT5, has been discovered in mammalian cells with an apparent homologue in yeast, Hsl7 (25Pollack B.P. Kotenko S.V. He W. Izotova L.S.

With the discovery that multiple species catalyze type I methylation reactions, differentiating their functions in vivo can be approached by analyzing their in vitro substrates. To that end, Chen et al. (21Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar) have shown that the recombinant form of PRMT4 preferentially methylates purified histone H3. Furthermore, our comparisons of recombinant forms of PRMT1 and PRMT3 as GST fusion proteins indicate that both enzymes can methylate the synthetic substrate GST-GAR (15Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S.

Additional clues to the functions of the individual PRMT enzymes can be obtained by identifying their binding partners. For example, the polypeptide of PRMT1 is 40.5 kDa, yet gel filtration chromatography indicates that the native complex is present as a 300- to 400-kDa complex (14Lin W.J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2800-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), suggesting a complex subunit structure. Furthermore, through yeast two-hybrid analysis, PRMT1 has been at least transiently linked to a range of proteins involved in signal transduction such as TIS21, BTG1, the interleukin enhancer binding factor 3, and the interferon α/β receptor (10Tang J.

More recently, a yeast two-hybrid screen searching for proteins that interact with the Jak2 receptor tyrosine kinase identified JBP1/PRMT5, another PRMT that may be involved in cell signaling (25Pollack B.P.

Finally, two-hybrid analysis has also shown that CARM1/PRMT4 interacts with the carboxyl terminus of the transcriptional coactivator p160, and it has been hypothesized to potentiate transcription through its methyltransferase activity (21Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Although two-hybrid analysis has suggested that PRMT3 can form both homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers with PRMT1, this interaction was not confirmed by Western analysis of gel filtration column chromatography fractions (15Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis of mammalian PRMTs has shown that all polypeptides contain a common catalytic domain but variable amino- and carboxyl-terminal extensions. Although PRMT1, the predominant catalytic subunit of protein arginine N-methyltransferases in mammalian cells (20Tang J. Frankel A. Cook R.J. Kim S. Paik W.K. Williams K.R. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7723-7730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), has few residues outside the catalytic domain, CARM1/PRMT4 and Hsl7 contain both amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains that show little or no homology to other proteins. Another protein considered to be a member of the PRMT family, although its enzymatic activity has not yet been detected, is PRMT2 (HRMT1L1), which contains a unique SH3 domain in its amino terminus that may interact with polyproline-rich regions in signaling proteins (30Katsanis N. Yaspo M.L. Fisher E.M. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 31Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Lalioti M.D. Rossier C. Silver P.A. Henry M.F. Genomics. 1998; 48: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Finally, PRMT3 contains a unique amino-terminal domain comprised of a putative C2H2 zinc-finger motif and a tyrosine-phosphorylation consensus sequence (15Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). These additional domains may be sites for specific regulation of these enzymes and may determine their substrate specificity as well. In this work, we have focused on the function of PRMT3. Although this protein has not yet been shown to interact with other proteins (15Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), it does contain a potential zinc-finger domain that distinguishes it from other PRMTs, and that may provide an excellent experimental handle for understanding its physiological function. We find that PRMT3 does in fact contain a single zinc-finger domain in its amino terminus and that it is required in the liganded form to recognize RNA-associated methyl-accepting substrates in RAT1 cell extracts. We have also characterized the differential responses of the various PRMT enzymes to inhibition by arginine, Tris, zinc ion, andN-ethylmaleimide. These results suggest that each of these enzymes may play distinct cellular roles. pGEX-plasmid construction to express recombinant glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins GST-Rmt1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (18Gary J.D.

The plasmid pGEX-JBP1 was constructed by PCR-amplifying from pGALFLAGJBP1 a 1.9-kb fragment with primers JBP1-N1 (5′-GTCGACATGGCGGCGATGGCGGTCGGGGGTGCTGGTGGGA-3′) and JBP1-C1 (5′-GCGGCCGCTCAGAGGCCAATGGTATATGAGCGGCCTGTGGGGTTATGA-3′); and the plasmid pGEX-HSL7 was constructed by PCR-amplifying from pGALFLAGHSL7 a 2.5-kb fragment with primers HSL7-N1 (5′-GTCGACATGCATAGCAACGTATTTGTTGGTGTCAAACCAGGCTTTA-3′) and HSL7-C1 (5′-GCGGCCGCTCACAGAGGCAGGGAAAAGGCTCTGCCACAGACATTATGT-3′). JBP1- and HSL7-PCR fragments were digested with SalI and NotI and ligated into pGEX(SN) atSalI/NotI sites (32Han L. Colicelli J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1318-1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The correct coding sequence was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. All GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coliDH5α cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) upon induction with a final concentration of 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Washed cells were resuspended in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride per gram of cells and broken by four 30-s sonicator pulses (50% duty; setting “4”) on ice with a Sonifier cell disruptor W-350 (SmithKline Corp.). The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 23,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. GST fusion proteins were then purified from soluble extracts by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were eluted with 30 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, and 2% glycerol, and then were desalted on a Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column (13.5-cm column height × 2.5-cm inner diameter; 60-ml bed volume) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. For the metal-deficient (apo) forms of PRMT3 and GST-ZF, the loaded beads were first washed with 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA prior to glutathione elution. Proteins were stored at −80 °C. A modification of the Lowry procedure was used to determine protein concentrations of GST fusion proteins and RAT1 cell extracts following precipitation with 1.0 ml of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (33Bailey J. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. 2nd Ed. Elsevier Science Publishers BV, Amsterdam1967: 340-341Google Scholar). A stock solution of bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard. Desalted GST fusion proteins were added to a 0.1% HNO3 solution resulting in final concentrations of 0.70–0.86% HNO3. The metal content was then measured at an absorbance of 206.2 nm in a Thermo Jarrel Ash Iris 1000 ICP-AE (inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission) spectrometer per the manufacturer's instructions. RAT1 fibroblast cells, provided by Dr. Harvey Herschman at UCLA, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, grown to approximately 80–90% confluence, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested by scraping in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, with a commercial mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, catalog no. 1836170; 50 μg/ml antipain dihydrochloride, 40 μg/ml bestatin, 6–60 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.5–10 μg/ml E-64, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 4–330 μg/ml phosphoramidon, 0.1–1 μg/ml Peflabloc SC, 0.06–2 μg/ml aprotonin). Washed cells were lysed by four 10-s sonicator pulses (50% duty; setting “2”) on ice, and subjected to a 30-min centrifugation at 18,000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C. Hypomethylated RAT1 cell extracts were made from RAT1 cells cultured in the presence of 20 μm adenosine dialdehyde (AdOx) for 48 h prior to harvesting, and the supernatant was desalted on a NAP-10 Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 50 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.5. To abolish endogenous methyltransferase activity, AdOx-treated RAT1 cell extracts were heated for 10 min at 70 °C. 3J. Tang, personal communication. In some cases AdOx-treated RAT1 cell extracts were pretreated with bovine pancreatic RNase A (10 mg/ml; Sigma) at a 0.2 mg/ml final concentration for 30 min at ambient temperature prior to methylation reactions (13Frankel A. Clarke S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Purified GST-methyltransferase fusion proteins were incubated with either GST-GAR or heat-denatured AdOx-treated RAT1 cell extracts in the presence ofS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine ([3H]AdoMet; 77 Ci/mmol, from a 10.4 μmstock solution in dilute HCl/ethanol 9:1, pH 2.0–2.5; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 37 °C. Each reaction mixture was buffered with 50 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.5. Specific concentrations of proteins and [3H]AdoMet are indicated in each of the figure legends. Methyltransferase inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) was done by incubating enzymes (either recombinant GST fusion proteins or endogenous proteins in RAT1 cell extracts) with an indicated concentration of N-ethylmaleimide for 20 min at 37 °C as described previously (34Stephenson R.C. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13314-13319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methylation reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1.43 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 24% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue), heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and separated on slab gels prepared from 12.6% (w/v) acrylamide, 1.4% (w/v)N,N-methylenebisacrylamide (1.5-mm × 10.5-cm resolving gel) using the buffer system described by Laemmli at a constant current of 35 mA for approximately 4 h (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, gels were stained in Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 20–30 min, destained in a 10% methanol (v/v), 5% acetic acid (v/v) destain solution to visualize protein bands, and then soaked in EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gels were dried in vacuo, and radioactivity was visualized by fluorography (exposure time at −80 °C is indicated in the figure legends). Methylation was quantitated by scanning the fluorograph in a MultiImage light cabinet and using Alpha Imager 2200 (Alpha Innotech Corp.) software to measure the amount of film exposure for each lane. The horizontal baseline was adjusted to the lowest densitometric measurement to subtract background from the results. The value determined for the control lane was set at 100%, and all subsequent values were set as a percentage of the control. PRMT3 has been postulated to contain an amino-terminal C2H2-type zinc-finger domain (15Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Such domains are present in a wide variety of proteins and often lead to the interaction of an α helix of the domain with the major groove of DNA (36Draper D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 593-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), although other interactions with proteins and RNAs also occur (36Draper D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 593-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 37Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the amino-terminal region of PRMT3 does in fact bind to zinc, we purified several recombinant forms of PRMT3 as GST fusion proteins as indicated in Table I. The proteins were then subjected to ICP-AE spectroscopy to quantify zinc content in the different protein preparations. Neither GST nor the GST fusion protein of PRMT3 without its putative zinc-finger domain, GST-PRMT3ΔZF (containing only amino acids 184–528 of rat PRMT3), were found to contain significant amounts of zinc. However, GST fusion proteins of full-length PRMT3 or its putative zinc-finger domain alone (amino acids 1–183) bound zinc almost stoichiometrically (Table I). Furthermore, when GST-PRMT3 was purified in the presence of chelators prior to desalting it by size-exclusion chromatography, its zinc content could be reduced by approximately half (Table I). These results clearly substantiate the presence of a zinc-finger domain in PRMT3. We found no difference in the methyltransferase activity toward the GST-GAR methyl-accepting substrate between the zinc-containing enzyme GST-PRMT3 and GST-PRMT3ΔZF, but did observe an approximately 34% decrease in activity in the zinc-deficient GST-PRMT3 enzyme (data not shown).Table IPresence of Zn 2+ in GST fusion protein preparationsProtein preparation 1-aNumbers in parentheses indicate amino acid residues of PRMT3 present in the GST fusion proteins.Zn2+/proteinmol/mol1-bAverage ± S.D.GST0.02 ± 0.01GST-PRMT3 (1–528)0.64 ± 0.05“apo”-GST-PRMT3 1-cGST fusion proteins were treated with 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA prior to desalting to make the metal-deficient (apo) form of the enzyme.

Open table in a new tab Zn2+ content was determined by atomic-absorption spectroscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All samples were measured in triplicate, and the experiments were performed on two separate samples. The unique zinc-finger domain of PRMT3 may be involved in the regulation of the enzyme or in the recognition of specific methyl-accepting substrates. To test these hypotheses, GST-PRMT3, GST-PRMT3ΔZF, GST-PRMT1, and GST-ZF-PRMT1 were incubated with heat-denatured hypomethylated extracts from AdOx-treated RAT1 cells as the methyl-acceptor (Fig.1 A). We observed large differences in their respective abilities to methylate substrates in RAT1 cell extracts. For example, neither the full-length GST-PRMT3 or the GST fusion protein lacking the zinc-finger domain appeared to recognize substrates in RAT1 cell extracts not treated with RNase (lanes 2 and 3), whereas GST-PRMT1 and a PRMT1 construct where the zinc-finger domain of PRMT3 was added to its amino terminus both methylated a large number of polypeptides (lanes 4 and 5). However, when RAT1 cell extracts were treated with RNase to uncover new methyl-acceptors (13Frankel A. Clarke S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we found t"
https://openalex.org/W2170546885,"Our group previously described a new type of G protein, the 78-kDa XLαs (extra large αs) (Kehlenbach, R. H., Matthey, J., and Huttner, W. B. (1994) Nature 372, 804–809 and (1995) Nature375, 253). Upon subcellular fractionation, XLαs labeled by ADP-ribosylation with cholera toxin was previously mainly detected in the bottom fractions of a velocity sucrose gradient that contained trans-Golgi network and was differentially distributed to Gαs, which also peaked in the top fractions containing plasma membrane. Here, we investigate, using a new antibody specific for the XL domain, the tissue distribution and subcellular localization of XLαs and novel splice variants referred to as XLN1. Upon immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis of various adult rat tissues, XLαs and XLN1 were found to be enriched in neuroendocrine tissues, with a particularly high level of expression in the pituitary. By both immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy, endogenous as well as transfected XLαs and XLN1 were found to be predominantly associated with the plasma membrane, with only little immunoreactivity on internal, perinuclear membranes. Upon subcellular fractionation, immunoreactive XLαs behaved similarly to Gαs but was differentially distributed to ADP-ribosylated XLαs. Moreover, the bottom fractions of the velocity sucrose gradient were found to contain not only trans-Golgi network membranes but also certain subdomains of the plasma membrane, which reconciles the present with the previous observations. To further investigate the molecular basis of the association of XLαs with the plasma membrane, chimeric proteins consisting of the XL domain or portions thereof fused to green fluorescent protein were analyzed by fluorescence and subcellular fractionation. In both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine cells, a fusion protein containing the entire XL domain, in contrast to one containing only the proline-rich and cysteine-rich regions, was exclusively localized at the plasma membrane. We conclude that the physiological role of XLαs is at the plasma membrane, where it presumably is involved in signal transduction processes characteristic of neuroendocrine cells. Our group previously described a new type of G protein, the 78-kDa XLαs (extra large αs) (Kehlenbach, R. H., Matthey, J., and Huttner, W. B. (1994) Nature 372, 804–809 and (1995) Nature375, 253). Upon subcellular fractionation, XLαs labeled by ADP-ribosylation with cholera toxin was previously mainly detected in the bottom fractions of a velocity sucrose gradient that contained trans-Golgi network and was differentially distributed to Gαs, which also peaked in the top fractions containing plasma membrane. Here, we investigate, using a new antibody specific for the XL domain, the tissue distribution and subcellular localization of XLαs and novel splice variants referred to as XLN1. Upon immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis of various adult rat tissues, XLαs and XLN1 were found to be enriched in neuroendocrine tissues, with a particularly high level of expression in the pituitary. By both immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy, endogenous as well as transfected XLαs and XLN1 were found to be predominantly associated with the plasma membrane, with only little immunoreactivity on internal, perinuclear membranes. Upon subcellular fractionation, immunoreactive XLαs behaved similarly to Gαs but was differentially distributed to ADP-ribosylated XLαs. Moreover, the bottom fractions of the velocity sucrose gradient were found to contain not only trans-Golgi network membranes but also certain subdomains of the plasma membrane, which reconciles the present with the previous observations. To further investigate the molecular basis of the association of XLαs with the plasma membrane, chimeric proteins consisting of the XL domain or portions thereof fused to green fluorescent protein were analyzed by fluorescence and subcellular fractionation. In both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine cells, a fusion protein containing the entire XL domain, in contrast to one containing only the proline-rich and cysteine-rich regions, was exclusively localized at the plasma membrane. We conclude that the physiological role of XLαs is at the plasma membrane, where it presumably is involved in signal transduction processes characteristic of neuroendocrine cells. trans-Golgi network green fluorescent protein postnuclear supernatant phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Heterotrimeric G proteins, which consist of an α-subunit and a βγ complex, transduce extracellular signals detected by heptahelical receptors to intracellular effectors (1Gilman A.G.

Our laboratory previously identified a new type of G protein, XLαs (extra large αs), that is characterized by a bipartite structure (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of XLαs is encoded by exons 2-13 of the Gαs gene and, hence, contains the entire Gαs sequence except for the N-terminal 47 amino acid residues encoded by exon 1 of the Gαs gene. In XLαs, the latter residues are replaced by a novel sequence, referred to as the XL domain, yielding a protein with a molecular mass of 78 kDa and an electrophoretic mobility corresponding to 94,000 (rat XLαs) (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 7Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 253Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Thus, XLαs is the largest known variant of a G protein α-subunit. Little is known about the tissue distribution and subcellular localization of XLαs, and no studies on the possible interaction of XLαs with βγ subunits, heptahelical receptors, and G protein effectors have been reported. Resolving these issues is important for elucidating the as yet unknown function of XLαs. Using in situ hybridization, the XLαs mRNA was previously detected in neuroendocrine but not other tissues (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), but it remains to be established whether or not a neuroendocrine-specific expression holds true for the XLαs protein. Using subcellular fractionation, the ADP-ribosylated form of XLαs has mainly been found in fractions containing trans-Golgi network (TGN)1 (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), but it is unclear whether this reflects the subcellular localization of XLαs under physiological conditions. In the present study, we have generated antibodies specific to the XL domain of XLαs. We have used these antibodies to investigate by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting of adult rat tissues the cellular and tissue distribution of XLαs and novel splice variants referred to as XLN1. In addition, we have studied by (immuno)fluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy, and subcellular fractionation the subcellular localization of immunoreactive XLαs and XLN1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins containing all or portions of the XL domain. In the accompanying paper (32Klemke M. Pasolli H.A. Kehlenbach R.H. Offermanus S. Schultz G. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33633-33640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we investigate the possible interaction of XLαs with βγ subunits, heptahelical receptors, and the classical effector of Gαs, adenylyl cyclase. The peptide NH2-EPAAEPAAEPAAEPA-CONH2, corresponding to amino acid residues 45–59 of the XLαs sequence (corrected translational start, see Kehlenbach et al. (7Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 253Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar); amino acid residues 176–190 of the originally published sequence (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar)), was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via glutaraldehyde and used to raise the rabbit antiserum RK5. RK5 antibodies were affinity-purified using the above peptide coupled to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad). The rabbit antiserum against the C-terminal decapeptide of Gαs and XLαs was the same as described previously (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used were monoclonal anti-insulin antibody (mouse ascites fluid clone K36aC10), monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody (clone TUB 2.1), both purchased from Sigma, and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP affinity-purified antibody (CLONTECH). The plasmid CDM8-XLαs, originally called CDM8-XL (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), contains a ≈2.6-kilobase insert starting at nucleotide position 380 of the originally published sequence (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and encodes the entire XLαs protein sequence (see correction of translational start (7Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 253Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar)) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The isolation of the CDM8-XLN1a and CDM8-XLN1b cDNAs will be described elsewhere. 2Y. Wang and W. B. Huttner, manuscript in preparation. The plasmid CDM8-XLN1a contains the XL-exon spliced to exon 2, exon 3, and exon N1 (8Crawford J.A. Mutchler K.J. Sullivan B.E. Lanigan T.M. Clark M.S. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9879-9885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and encodes a C-terminal-truncated version of the XLαs protein because of the presence of the stop codon-containing exon N1 (Fig. 1 A). The plasmid CDM8-XLN1b is identical to CDM8-XLN1a except for a 95-base pair insertion between the XL-exon and exon 2, which in case of human XLαs has been shown to be due to the additional exon A20 in the XLαs/Gαs gene (9Hayward B.E. Moran V. Strain L. Bonthron D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15475-15480Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To generate the GFP fusion proteins, the following regions of XLαs were amplified from pCDM8-XLαs by polymerase chain reaction introducing a 5′ XhoI and a 3′ BglII restriction site: 1) XL-GFP (amino acids 1–371); 2) XLΔβγ-GFP (amino acids 1–321); 3) XL(Δβγ+C)-GFP (amino acids 1–236); and 4) (P+C)-GFP (amino acids 201–312). The fragments were inserted into theXhoI/BamHI-digested pEGFP-N2 vector (CLONTECH) upstream and in-frame with the EGFP cDNA. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. PC12 cells were grown as described (10Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). [35S]Sulfate labeling and chase of PC12 cells were performed as described (10Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For [35S]cysteine-methionine labeling, PC12 cells on 15-cm dishes were rinsed once with Met/Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in this medium. The cells were then pulse-labeled for 5 min at 37 °C with fresh Met/Cys-free medium containing 1 mCi/dish of [35S]Pro-mix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, >1000 Ci/mmol). After the pulse, cells were chased for 0, 15, or 120 min in normal growth medium (10Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For transient transfection, PC12 cells harvested from a subconfluent 15-cm dish after trypsinization were subjected to electroporation (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser, 960 microfarads, 300 V) in 0.8 ml of PBS containing 45 μg of circular plasmid DNA. HeLa and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa cells on 15-cm dishes were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate protocol (11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar) using 40 μg/dish of circular plasmid DNA. COS-7 cells were transfected in the same way (for the GFP constructs) or (in the case of XLαs) by using the FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 20 μg of circular plasmid DNA/15-cm dish. Wild type and transfected cells were plated on coverslips (polylysine-coated in the case of PC12 cells) for immunofluorescence or on 15-cm dishes (for subcellular fractionation). Cells were used 2 days after transfection, with 10 mm sodium butyrate added in the case of XLαs-transfected PC12 cells during the last 16 h to increase the expression of the transgene (12Gorman C. Howard B. Reeves R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7631-7648Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Pancreas and pituitary of adult rats were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C, infiltrated with 0.5 m sucrose in PBS at 4 °C, frozen in Tissue-Tek on liquid nitrogen and stored at −20 °C. Frozen sections (10 μm) were cut in a Leica Frigocut 2800N cryostat, air-dried on gelatin-coated slides, and processed for immunofluorescence as described (13Iacopetti P. Michelini M. Stuckmann I. Oback B. Aaku-Saraste E. Huttner W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4639-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), except that bovine serum albumin was used instead of fetal calf serum for blocking the sections, with the primary antibodies as follows: affinity-purified anti-XL antibody at 0.1–0.5 μg IgG/ml and monoclonal anti-insulin antibody diluted 1/6000. Indirect immunofluorescence of paraformaldehyde-fixed PC12, HeLa, and COS-7 cells was performed as described (14Rosa P. Weiss U. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Niehrs C. Stelzer E.H.K. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), using 0.1–0.5 μg of IgG/ml (final concentration) of affinity-purified anti-XL antibody. To test its specificity, the affinity-purified anti-XL antibody after dilution to its final concentration was incubated before immunofluorescence overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml EPAA peptide used as antigen. GFP fusion proteins were detected by GFP autofluorescence. For double immunofluorescence, anti-β-tubulin was used at 15 μg of IgG/ml. Wheat germ agglutinin coupled to tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate was used at 50 μg/ml. Secondary antibodies used were fluorescein- or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, and Cy2-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Samples were examined by either conventional fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axiophot) or confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS4D). Posterior lobes of adult rat pituitaries were dissected and fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in the acrylic resin LRWhite (London Resin Corp.). Semithin sections were obtained and stained with 1% toluidine blue, 1% sodium tetraborate to localize the pars intermedia. Ultrathin sections were labeled using affinity-purified anti-XL antibody at 1–5 μg of IgG/ml followed by protein A gold (9 nm). Sections were stained with saturated uranyl acetate in water. PC12 and HeLa whole cell lysates were obtained by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer to the dishes followed by immediate boiling of the samples. Postnuclear supernatant (PNS) from PC12 cells was prepared as described (10Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A total membrane fraction from the PNS was obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. Velocity sucrose gradient centrifugation of the PNS and equilibrium sucrose gradient centrifugation of selected fractions of the velocity sucrose gradient were performed as described (10Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For the analysis of membrane association of GFP fusion proteins transfected into PC12 cells, equal aliquots of the respective PNS were subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Particulate and soluble fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immuno- blotting. For the analysis of the subcellular localization of newly synthesized Gαs and XLαs, velocity sucrose gradient fractions from PC12 cells pulse-labeled for 5 min with [35S]cysteine-methionine and chased for 15 or 120 min were mixed with the respective fractions containing membranes from unlabeled PC12 cells (used as carrier) and diluted with 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2. Membranes were collected by centrifugation (100,000 × g at 4 °C, 1 h). Gαs and XLαs were immunoprecipitated from the membranes using the antiserum against the C-terminal decapeptide of Gαs and XLαs at 1:100 dilution, as described (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). For the analysis of membrane association of newly synthesized Gαs and XLαs, total membranes and cytosol were prepared by centrifugation (100,000 × g at 4 °C, 1 h) of the PNS of PC12 cells pulse-labeled for 5 min with [35S]cysteine-methionine and chased for 0, 15, or 120 min. An aliquot of the total membrane preparation was subjected to carbonate stripping by incubation with 0.1 mNa2CO3, 0.025% saponin, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as described (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Gαs and XLαs were immunoprecipitated from cytosol, total membranes, and carbonate-stripped membranes using the antiserum against the C-terminal decapeptide of Gαs and XLαs, as described (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Adult rat tissues were dissected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen followed by storage at −80 °C until use. Tissue was homogenized in 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. In the case of the pancreas, homogenization was performed in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (pepstatin, leupeptin, chymostatin, antipain, soybean trypsin inhibitor). Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain the total membranes. Membranes were resuspended in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, and then boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE was carried out according to standard procedures. For immunoblotting of velocity sucrose gradient fractions, we used 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS to block the nitrocellulose membranes, the antiserum against the C-terminal decapeptide of Gαs and XLαs at 1:800–1:1000 dilution, and 125I-protein A. For immunoblotting of total membranes from various tissues and of velocity sucrose gradient fractions from PC12 cells expressing various GFP fusion proteins, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% lowfat milk powder in PBS and incubated (i) with either affinity-purified anti-XL antibody at 0.1 μg of IgG/ml or anti-GFP antibody at 1 μg of IgG/ml followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or (ii) with anti-XL antiserum (1:200 to 1:600 dilution) followed by 125I-protein A. To test the specificity of the anti-XL antibody, blots of whole PC12 cell lysate were incubated with the antibody solution containing 10 μg/ml of the EPAA peptide. Tissues from adult rats were directly homogenized in guanidine isothiocyanate, and total RNA was isolated as described (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62897) Google Scholar, 16Xie W.Q. Rothblum L.I. Biotechniques. 1991; 11: 326-327Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis (10 μg of total RNA) was carried out using a [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA fragment corresponding to exons 2–9 of a Gαs cDNA as probe. ADP-ribosylation of PNS using cholera toxin and 32P-NAD was performed as described (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Previous results obtained by in situhybridization showed that the XLαs mRNA occurs predominantly in certain endocrine cells and neurons (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The C-terminal decapeptides of XLαs and Gαs are identical, and hence, use of the corresponding antibody (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) in immunocytochemistry does not allow one to distinguish between these two G proteins. Moreover, in immunofluorescence experiments, no staining was observed with the previously raised antibody (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) against an epitope of the XL domain adjacent to the putative βγ binding site of XLαs (data not shown). To investigate the tissue distribution of XLαs by immunocytochemistry, we therefore raised a new antibody against the EPAA repeats of the XL domain (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), referred to as anti-XL antibody. In immunoblots of a total membrane fraction from PC12 cell PNS, this antibody recognized only XLαs and a group of three proteins of M r 50,000–65,000 (Fig. 2 A). The latter correspond to novel splice variants derived from the rat XLαs/Gαs gene2 and will be referred to as the XLN1 proteins (see Fig.1 A). These contain the entire XL domain followed by C-terminal-truncated αs domains, due to the presence of additional exons in the corresponding mRNAs: in the case of XLN1a, the stop codon-containing N1 exon (8Crawford J.A. Mutchler K.J. Sullivan B.E. Lanigan T.M. Clark M.S. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9879-9885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in the case of XLN1b, the frameshifting 95-base pair insertion (Fig.1 A). Whereas immunoblots using the anti-XL antibody of untransfected HeLa cells showed no immunoreactive bands, immunoblots of HeLa cells transfected with the XLN1a or XLN1b cDNA showed major immunoreactive bands very similar, if not identical, to two of theM r 50,000–65,000 proteins detected in PC12 cells (Fig. 2 A), corroborating their identity as XLN1 proteins. In immunoblots of whole PC12 cell lysate, the immunoreactive bands corresponding to XLαs and the XLN1 proteins were abolished when the anti-XL antibody was used in the presence of the peptide used as antigen (Fig. 2 B), which further documents the specificity of this antibody. Essentially similar results were obtained when immunoblots were probed with an antibody raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the XL domain (data not shown).Figure 2Expression of rat XLαs mRNA and protein in neuroendocrine tissues.

Pituitary (A), anterior pituitary.

Northern blot analysis of various rat tissues revealed the presence of the XLαs mRNA in the adrenal gland, brain, cerebellum, heart, and pituitary gland, with the levels in the brain and heart at the limit of detectability and the levels in the pituitary much higher than in the other neuroendocrine tissues (Fig. 2 C). No XLαs mRNA was detected in kidney, liver, and spleen. These observations are consistent with the neuroendocrine-specific tissue distribution of the XLαs mRNA previously observed by in situ hybridization (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of the XLαs protein and the XLN1 proteins in rat brain, cerebellum, adrenal gland, pancreas (at the limit of detection) and, at very high levels, the pituitary gland but not in liver and kidney (Fig. 2 D). Within the pituitary gland, XLαs and XLN1 immunoreactivity per total protein was much higher in the posterior lobe (containing the pars intermedia plus neurohypophysis) than in the anterior lobe (see legend to Fig.2 D). The level of XLαs and XLN1 immunoreactivity per total protein in the pituitary posterior lobe was ∼80 times (XLαs) to ∼120 times (XLN1) higher than that in the adrenal. Adult rat pituitary cryosections were examined by immunofluorescence using the anti-XL antibody. Strong immunostaining for XLαs/XLN1 was observed in most, if not all, cells of the pars intermedia, the melanotrophs (Fig. 3 a andb). The level of immunostaining was lower in the anterior pituitary and restricted to a subset of cells (Fig. 3, a andc). The neurohypophysis was not immunostained above background (Fig. 3 a). In both anterior pituitary and pars intermedia, the staining was predominantly observed at the cell periphery, delineating the shape of the cells. Immunofluorescence of cryosections of adult rat pancreas showed that the immunoreactivity for XLαs/XLN1 was present in the islets of Langerhans, the endocrine part of the organ, but not in the surrounding exocrine part (Fig. 3 d). Comparison of the staining with that for insulin by double immunofluorescence revealed that XLαs/XLN1 was expressed in most (Fig. 3, d and e,larger arrows) but not all (Fig. 3, d ande, arrowheads) β cells. XLαs/XLN1 expression was not restricted to β cells but also observed in other endocrine cells of the pancreas, as indicated by the presence of cells immunoreactive for XLαs/XLN1 but negative for insulin (Fig. 3,d and e, small arrows). Taken together, XLαs and XLN1 are neuroendocrine-specific proteins expressed in many, but not all, neuroendocrine cells in the adult. Essentially similar results were obtained when immunofluorescence of pituitary and endocrine pancreas was performed using an antibody raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the XL domain (data not shown). Upon subcellular fractionation of PC12 cells, we previously observed a differential distribution of XLαs and Gαs, [32P]ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin, across a velocity sucrose gradient (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The majority of the [32P]ADP-ribosylated Gαs, but at most a quarter of the [32P]ADP-ribosylated XLαs, was recovered in the top fractions of the gradient (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), which are known to contain plasma membrane (17Régnier-Vigouroux A. Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3589-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). By contrast, only about one-third of the [32P]ADP-ribosylated Gαs, but almost two-third of the [32P]ADP-ribosylated XLαs, was recovered in the bottom fractions of the gradient (6Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), which are known to contain TGN membranes (10Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 a shows the results of another such subcellular fractionation experiment, which confirms the previously observed differential distribution of [32P]ADP-ribosylated Gαs and XLαs upon velocity sucrose gradient centrifugation. Surprisingly, however, no significant difference in the distribution upon velocity sucrose gradient centrifugation was observed when immunoreactive rather than [32P]ADP-ribosylated Gαs and XLαs were compared (Fig. 4 b). Immunoblotting using the antibody against the C-terminal decapeptide of Gαs/XLαs showed that for either G protein, the majority was found in the top fractions of the gradient and, at most, one-third in the bottom fractions. Equilibrium sucrose gradient analysis provided further evidence that the XLαs found in the top fractions of the velocity sucrose gradient,i.e. the majority of the immunoreactive XLαs (Fig.4 b) but only about one-third of the [32P]ADP-ribosylated XLαs (Fig. 4 a), was indeed associated with the plasma membrane.

We studied the effects of 37 °C “heat shock” or sublethal menadione, which generates superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, on Leishmania chagasi virulence. Both heat and menadione caused parasites to become more resistant to H2O2-mediated toxicity. Peroxide resistance was also induced as promastigotes developed in culture from logarithmic to their virulent stationary phase form. Peroxide resistance was not associated with an increase in reduced thiols (trypanothione and glutathione) or increased activity of ornithine decarboxylase, which is rate-limiting in trypanothione synthesis. Membrane lipophosphoglycan increased in size as parasites developed to stationary phase but not after environmental exposures. Instead, parasites underwent a heat shock response upon exposure to heat or sublethal menadione, detected by increased levels of HSP70. Transfection of promastigotes withL. chagasi HSP70 caused a heat-inducible increase in resistance to peroxide, implying it is involved in antioxidant defense. We conclude that leishmania have redundant mechanisms for resisting toxic oxidants. Some are induced during developmental change and others are induced in response to environmental stress.

These in turn rapidly react to form toxic effectors such as the hydroxyl radical (⋅OH) and peroxynitrite (ONOO−). Intracellular microbes residing in macrophages in particular must rise to this challenge by preventing oxidant formation, resisting damage from toxic oxygen products, or metabolizing oxidants. Microorganisms have developed a diverse array of mechanisms allowing them to evade oxidant-mediated killing (1Pompella A. Int. J. Vitam. Nutr. Res. 1997; 67: 289-297PubMed Google Scholar). The Leishmania sp. are obligate intracellular protozoa residing in macrophages of their mammalian hosts. The promastigote form of the parasite is inoculated into mammalian skin by a sand fly vector, subjecting it to a sudden change in ambient temperature. Parasites undergo phagocytosis by dendritic cells and macrophages in the skin, exposing them to antimicrobial oxidants generated during phagocytosis (2Pearson R.D. Harcus J.L. Symes P.H. Romito R. Donowitz G.R. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 1282-1286PubMed Google Scholar, 3Murray H.W. Annu. Rev. Med. 1986; 37: 61-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the face of these exposures a subset of parasites survive, convert to obligate intracellular amastigotes, and can eventually lead to disease symptoms (2Pearson R.D. Harcus J.L. Symes P.H. Romito R. Donowitz G.R. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 1282-1286PubMed Google Scholar, 4Murray H.W. Spitalny G.L. Nathan C.F. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 1619-1622PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pearson R.D. Harcus J.L. Roberts D. Donowitz G.R. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 1994-1999PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanisms through which the Leishmania sp. resist the toxic effects of oxidant exposure include the promastigote surface glycolipid lipophosphoglycan (LPG)1which scavenges toxic oxygen products and inhibits macrophage responses (6Chan J. Fujiwara T. Brennan P. McNeil M. Turco S.J. Sibille J.-C. Snapper M. Aisen P. Bloom B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2453-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 7Descoteaux A.

Trypanosomes and Leishmaniasp. also possess trypanothione (TSH), a unique redox-cycling glutathione-spermidine conjugate which, in concert with trypanothione reductase, maintains the intracellular reducing environment (11Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2590-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Disruption of the trypanothione reductase gene or transfection withtrans-dominant inactive trypanothione reductase renders parasites more susceptible to intracellular killing in macrophages capable of generating reactive oxygen intermediates (13Dumas C. Ouellette M. Tovar J. Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Tamar S. Olivier M. Papadopoulou B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2590-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 14Tovar J. Cunningham M.L. Smith A.C.

Finally, similar to other organisms, Leishmania sp. augment their expression of heat shock proteins in response to elevated temperature or other environmental stress. The heat shock proteins are involved in the prevention and repair of damage caused by denatured and aggregated proteins. Their expression can result in a cell with increased resistance to thermally induced injury and cross-resistance to other toxic environmental exposures (15Hightower L.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). We previously found that Leishmania chagasi promastigotes undergo a stress response after exposure to environmental conditions they encounter in their mammalian hosts, including heat or sublethal concentrations of oxidants. This response results in cross-resistance to the toxic effects of either superoxide or hydrogen peroxide and increased virulence (16Wilson M.E. Andersen K.A. Britigan B.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5133-5141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zarley J.H. Britigan B.E. Wilson M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1511-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Promastigotes also undergo a developmental change as they progress from logarithmic to stationary phase in culture medium, which is accompanied by an increase in resistance to H2O2-induced injury and an increase in virulence. Our investigations suggested that different mechanisms account for the inducible oxidant resistance encountered during development as opposed to environmental stress (17Zarley J.H. Britigan B.E. Wilson M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1511-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to investigate mechanisms that might be responsible for inducible resistance to oxidant-mediated toxicity inL. chagasi promastigotes. Such mechanisms are likely essential for survival of the parasite in a mammalian host. A Brazilian isolate of L. chagasi(MHOM/BR/00/1669) was maintained in hamsters by serial intracardiac injection of amastigotes. Parasites were grown as promastigotes at 26 °C in liquid hemoflagellate-modified minimal essential medium (HOMEM) (18Berens R.L. Brun R. Krassner S.M. J. Parasitol. 1976; 62: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and used within 3 weeks of isolation. Some parasites were transferred to serum-free medium (SFM) (16Wilson M.E. Andersen K.A. Britigan B.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5133-5141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Promastigote cultures were seeded at 1 × 106/ml and harvested during logarithmic or stationary phase of growth, defined according to concentration and morphology as we have described previously (17Zarley J.H. Britigan B.E. Wilson M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1511-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Promastigotes in HOMEM were exposed to heat shock by incubation in a 37 °C water bath. Menadione was dissolved in Me2SO (1m) and added at 2.5 μm to cells adapted to SFM, a concentration that we previously determined was sublethal but generated detectable superoxide (16Wilson M.E. Andersen K.A. Britigan B.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5133-5141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control parasites were suspended in the equivalent volume of Me2SO alone. 2 × 106 stress-exposed or control promastigotes in 100 μl of HBSS were exposed in triplicate to varying concentrations of H2O2 (Sigma) in 96-well plates at 26 °C. After 1 h the reaction was stopped by addition of 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 500 units/ml catalase. Parasite viability was measured by incubation in 0.5 mg/ml (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) for 3 h followed by addition of 100 μl of 0.04 n HCl in isopropyl alcohol. Living mitochondria convert MTT to dark blue formazan that is soluble in acid isopropyl alcohol. Formazan was detected on a microplate reader at 570 nm (19Davis L.S. Lipsky P.E. Bottomly K. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Imunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 6.3.7Google Scholar). The percent viability was calculated from the ratio of OD readings in wells with H2O2 versus wells without H2O2 × 100. Promastigote pellets were suspended in 50 volumes of PSDEP buffer (60 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 44 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mm pyridoxal phosphate). They were lysed by six rounds of freeze-thaw and clarified by 15 min of microcentrifugation. ODC activity in recombinant ODC or lysates was measured by the amount of [14CO2] released from 0.4 mm l-[1-14C]ornithine (57 mCi/mmol) at 37 °C and trapped in 200 μl of hyamine hydroxide, exactly as described (20Phillips M.A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 22: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). ODC activity was calculated as the mean nanomoles of [14CO2] produced per mg of protein lysate over 1 h. Putrescine, spermidine, and spermine were quantified as the o-phthalaldehyde derivatized from acid extracts by reverse phase HPLC on a C-18 Percosil 10-μm column as described previously (21Bacchi C.J. Garofalo J. Ciminelli M. Rattendi D. Goldberg B. McCann P.P. Yarlett N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To measure reduced thiols, 108 promastigotes were suspended in 50 μl of HEPPS-buffered saline (40 μm HEPPS, 140 mmNaCl, pH 8.0), and total thiols were derivatized with 50 μl of 2 mm monobromobimane. Derivitized thiols were separated by HPLC on a Beckman Altex C-18 column (4.5 × 250 mm, column diameter 5 μm) using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Series 410 with a 10-μl loop injector. Thiols were eluted with solvents containing 0.25% (w/v) d-camphor sulfonate, pH 2.64, and a linear gradient of 2.5–12.5% n-propyl alcohol. Thiols were detected using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences OS-1 fluorescence detector (excitation wavelength 375 nm; emission 480 nm) (22Yarlett N. Goldberg B. Nathan H.C. Garofalo J. Bacchi C.J. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 72: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Fairlamb A.H. Henderson G.B. Bacchi C.J. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 24: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Standards were purified TSH (Bachem, kindly provided by Dr. Cy Bacchi, Haskins Lab), GSH (Sigma), and dithiothreitol (Sigma) which co-migrates with glutathionyl-spermidine. Promastigote proteins were denatured in 4% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, separated on 10% discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gels (24Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverly S.M. Gene (Amst. ). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and transferred to nitrocellulose. Filters were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin or 5% nonfat dry milk/phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 1:2500 polyclonal rabbit anti-HSP70 generated from recombinant L. chagasi HSP70 or monoclonal antibody E7 to β-tubulin (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa). Secondary antibodies were 1:5000 peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and autoradiography. RNA was extracted using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar). Four μg of total promastigote RNA were separated on 1.2% formaldehyde-containing agarose gels and analyzed by Northern blotting (26Brown T. Mackey K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D.

Filters were probed with 32P-labeled DNAs containing full-length HSP70, HSP90, or 18 S rRNA genes derived fromL. chagasi. A plasmid containing the Leishmania donovani ODC coding region was kindly provided by Buddy Ullman (27Hanson S. Adelman J. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bands were quantified by densitometry (Alpha Innotech Co., San Leandro, CA). 2 × 108 promastigotes in 10 ml of HOMEM were metabolically labeled by overnight incubation in 300 μCi of [3H]mannose (60 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). LPG was extracted sequentially with CHCl3/CH3OH (3:2) with 4 mm MgCl2, CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3), CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1), and CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3). LPG was dissolved in water/ethanol/pyridine/NH4OH (15:15:5:1:0.017), dried, and dissolved in SDS buffer as described (28Turco S.J. Wilkerson J.A. Clawson D.R. J. Biol.

Med. 1995; 181: 685-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis on an 8% SDS Tris-Tricine gel (30Lesse A.J. Campagnari A.A. Bittner W.E. Apicella M.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 126: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), radioactive LPG was detected by autoradiography. TheHSP70 coding region was amplified from a full-lengthHSP70 cDNA previously cloned from an L. chagasi promastigote cDNA expression library (31De Andrade C.R. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. Otsu K. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1992; 30: 330-335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the polymerase chain reaction. Primers introduced BamHI sites (underlined) at both ends of the coding region (top primer 5′-CGCGGATCCGGCAGAGATGACGTTCGACG-3′; bottom primer 5′-CGCGGATCCTGCTCGGGCGACTTAGTC-3′). The reaction product was cloned into the BamHI site of p63XNeo, aLeishmania plasmid shuttle vector kindly provided by Steven Beverly, Washington University, St. Louis. The insert sequence was fully sequenced. Logarithmically growing L. chagasipromastigotes were transfected with 20 μg of purified plasmid vector without insert or p63XNeo containing the HSP70 gene. Single colonies were selected on medium 199-agar plates as described (32LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverly S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Clones were gradually adapted in liquid medium to 1000 μg/ml G418. At the onset of mammalian infection,Leishmania sp. promastigotes are transferred from ambient temperature in an insect vector to 37 °C in a mammalian host. Upon phagocytosis by a macrophage, they are exposed to products of the NADPH oxidase (2Pearson R.D. Harcus J.L. Symes P.H. Romito R. Donowitz G.R. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 1282-1286PubMed Google Scholar, 33Murray H.W. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 153: 1690-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In order to reproduce these conditions, promastigotes were exposed in vitro to 37 °C heat or sublethal concentrations of menadione, a compound that generates both superoxide and H2O2. These exposures each elicited a response that rendered promastigotes more resistant to the toxic effects of H2O2 than unexposed parasites (Fig.1) (16Wilson M.E. Andersen K.A. Britigan B.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5133-5141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously showed that stationary phase promastigotes are more resistant to oxidant toxicity than logarithmically growing promastigotes (17Zarley J.H. Britigan B.E. Wilson M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1511-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Trypanothione is a conjugate of glutathione and spermidine that cycles between oxidized and reduced thiol forms. Similar to GSH in other eukaryotic cells, trypanothione maintains the intracellular reducing environment and contributes to antioxidant defense (12Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 13Dumas C. Ouellette M. Tovar J. Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Tamar S. Olivier M. Papadopoulou B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2590-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting enzyme in trypanothione biosynthesis is ODC (12Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). We queried whether inducible oxidant resistance in promastigotes is associated with increased ODC activity and/or increased levels of reduced trypanothione. Both sublethal menadione and growth to stationary phase caused an increase in the steady state level of ODC RNA (Fig.2). By using light exposures of Northern blots, mRNA abundance was quantified by densitometry as a ratio with 18 S RNA. ODC RNA increased 4.7-fold after 20 h of menadione exposure and 9.2-fold during growth to stationary phase. Changes inHSP70 and HSP90 RNAs were less dramatic.HSP70 RNA increased 1.3- or 2.1-fold, respectively, after menadione exposure or stationary growth. The ratios of HSP90RNAs were 1.6 and 3.7, respectively. We previously documented increased amounts of HSP70 and HSP90 proteins after heat or menadione exposure but decreased HSP70 after growth to stationary phase (16Wilson M.E. Andersen K.A. Britigan B.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5133-5141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Andersen K.A. Britigan B.E. Wilson M.E. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1996; 54: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Despite the increase in ODC mRNA, ODC enzyme activity decreased significantly during growth to stationary phase, and there was a trend toward decreased ODC activity after exposure to sublethal menadione (Fig. 3). There is only one copy of the ODC gene in L. donovani (27Hanson S. Adelman J. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore seems unlikely that the band on ODC Northern blots is derived from a pseudogene, although we cannot formally rule this out as a possible explanation for our results. We propose that ODC and HSP70 can be added to the list of trypanosomatid genes for which the steady state amount of mRNA does not reflect the abundance or activity of the protein (34Andersen K.A.

Promastigotes in logarithmic growth were exposed for 2 h to the ODC inhibitor DFMO (1 mm) versus control (C). Other promastigotes were harvested in (Log) or stationary (Sta) phases of growth. Logarithmic promastigotes were exposed to 2.5 μm menadione (MD) for 2 h or to 37 °C heat shock (HS) for 12 h, whereas controls were maintained in control medium without (HS) or with (MD) Me2SO at 26 °C. Cytosolic fractions of all promastigote cultures were assayed for ODC activity. One unit of ODC represents the nanomoles of [14CO2] produced from l-[1-14C]ornithine per mg parasite protein/h.

To determine whether inducible oxidant resistance was associated with a similar increase, we quantified reduced thiols in promastigotes harvested under different conditions. Reduced thiols were derivatized with monobromobimane and separated by reverse phase HPLC (22Yarlett N. Goldberg B. Nathan H.C. Garofalo J. Bacchi C.J. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 72: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Reduced glutathione (GSH), trypanthione (TSH), and glutathionyl-spermidine intermediates (GSH-Spd) were detected as peaks of fluorescence eluted from the column (Fig.4). To our surprise, the amounts of total reduced trypanothione and glutathione were similar (Fig.5, A and B). The level of reduced trypanothione in stationary phase promastigotes was paradoxically lower than in logarithmic organisms (n = 4) despite their increased resistance to H2O2, paralleling the activity of ODC (see Fig. 3). Exposure to environmental stress (heat or menadione) did not significantly alter the level of either TSH or GSH (heat, n = 4; sublethal menadione,n = 7).Figure 5Levels of reduced trypanothione (A) and glutathione (B) are shown in control promastigotes (open bars) or promastigotes exposed to 1 mm DFMO , 2.5 μm menadione (MD), or 37 °C heat shock (hatched bars). The solvent Me2SO was added to controls (Cont) for menadione exposure. Levels are also shown for promastigotes in logarithmic (open bar) versus stationary (hatched bar) phases of growth. Data represent the mean ± S.E. values for 5 assays, each with triplicate conditions. C andD, promastigotes were exposed to the indicated concentrations of DFMO for 3 days. Susceptibility to H2O2 toxicity was assessed by pre-exposing parasites to varying concentrations of H2O2followed by measuring viability according to the uptake of MTT.C shows a representative toxicity curve.

Protozool. 1981; 28: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Incubation in DFMO was ultimately lethal for promastigote cultures (data not shown). Four or seven days of incubation in 1 μm DFMO decreased the enzyme product putrescine by 82 and 97%, respectively (Table I). DFMO exposure also caused a significant decrease in the amount of reduced trypanothione (Figs. 4 and 5 A; n = 5). However, DFMO caused a paradoxical increase in resistance of promastigotes to H2O2 (Fig. 5, C andD), investigated further below. We conclude that neither developmental nor environmentally induced resistance to oxidant toxicity is accounted for by an increase in ODC activity or reduced trypanothione.Table ILevels of polyamines in promastigotes under different stress conditionsConditionsPutrescineSpermidineSpermineLogarithmic1422 1-aPolyamine levels are mean pmol/107 cells in four replicate HPLC runs.3456330Stationary354168733DFMO 1-bData for DFMO exposure are shown in stationary phase promastigotes.9.01316.1Menadione control 1-cMenadione exposure was performed on logarithmic promastigotes.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether conditions that augment promastigote resistance to H2O2 induce a stress response, we measured the rate of protein synthesis. Promastigotes were exposed for 2 h to 37 °C heat shock, a sublethal concentration of menadione (2.5 μm), buffer alone, or buffer with Me2SO to control for the menadione solvent. Both heat shock and menadione caused an increase in total protein synthesis compared with control conditions. 37 °C heat shock increased [3H]leucine incorporation from 4606 ± 231 to 8393 ± 962 cpm in a representative experiment (3 repeats with duplicate conditions;p < 0.05). Menadione increased leucine incorporation from 5015 ± 214 to 6380 ± 52 cpm in a representative experiment (3 repeats with duplicate conditions; p = 0.06). We performed immunoblots to determine whether heat shock proteins were among those induced by environmental stress. Logarithmically growing promastigotes were exposed to 37 °C heat shock, sublethal menadione (2.5, 5.0 μm), or 1 mm DFMO to inhibit ODC activity. Other parasites were harvested during logarithmicversus stationary growth phases (Fig.6). HSP70 and β-tubulin immunoblots of proteins from these promastigotes showed the following. First, both heat exposure and sublethal menadione caused an increase in the amount of HSP70 protein. Second, growth to stationary phase was associated with a decrease rather than an increase in HSP70 protein expression. Third, DFMO exposure also increased HSP70 protein expression, in addition to its effects on ODC and trypanothione (see Figs. 3 and 5). Thus, the paradoxical increase in H2O2resistance after DFMO exposure could be due to induction of a stress response, similar to other environmental exposures. These blots make it apparent that different responses are induced upon exposure of parasites to environmental stress as opposed to the growth to stationary phase, even though each produces a state of increased oxidant resistance. To investigate the importance of HSP70 itself in oxidant resistance, promastigotes overexpressing HSP70 were raised by transfection with an L. chagasi HSP70 gene. The abundance of HSP70 was quantified by densitometry as the ratio of HSP70 to β-tubulin bands. Despite selection in high levels of G418, when maintained at 26 °C transfected promastigotes expressed only 1.5-fold more HSP70 protein than controls containing empty vector. Exposure of HSP70 overexpressors to 37 °C heat resulted in a 2.3-fold further induction of HSP70 (Fig.7 A). Parasites overexpressing HSP70 protein exhibited increased resistance to H2O2-mediated toxicity (Fig.8). The augmented oxidant resistance was more pronounced after exposure of promastigotes to 37 °C heat, as would be expected given the increase in HSP70 protein after heat shock.Figure 8H2O2 resistance of transfected promastigotes.

https://openalex.org/W2008636587,"Cyclic AMP can either activate or inhibit the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in different cell types; MAPK activation has been observed in B-Raf-expressing cells and has been attributed to Rap1 activation with subsequent B-Raf activation, whereas MAPK inhibition has been observed in cells lacking B-Raf and has been attributed to cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A)-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition of Raf-1 kinase. We found that cAMP stimulated MAPK activity in CHO-K1 and PC12 cells but inhibited MAPK activity in C6 and NB2A cells. In all four cell types, cAMP activated Rap1, and the 95- and 68-kDa isoforms of B-Raf were expressed. cAMP activation or inhibition of MAPK correlated with activation or inhibition of endogenous and transfected B-Raf kinase. Although all cell types expressed similar amounts of 14-3-3 proteins, approximately 5-fold less 14-3-3 was associated with B-Raf in cells in which cAMP was inhibitory than in cells in which cAMP was stimulatory. We found that the cell type-specific inhibition of B-Raf could be completely prevented by overexpression of 14-3-3 isoforms, whereas expression of a dominant negative 14-3-3 mutant resulted in partial loss of B-Raf activity. Our data suggest that 14-3-3 bound to B-Raf protects the enzyme from protein kinase A-mediated inhibition; the amount of 14-3-3 associated with B-Raf may explain the tissue-specific effects of cAMP on B-Raf kinase activity."

The CMTX phenotype of the mutant 5′-UTR further suggested that the wild-type IRES was essential for the translation of the connexin-32 mRNA in nerve cells.

As a consequence eukaryotic mRNAs are usually monocistronic. This is in contrast to prokaryotic mRNAs that often are polycistronic, containing multiple internal ribosome binding sites (Shine-Dalgarno sequence). Eukaryotic RNA sequence elements that can function as internal ribosome entry sites (IRES)1 were first discovered in picornavirus and later also in some other viral RNAs (1Jackson R.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 292-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 2Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA (N. Y. ). 1995; 1: 985-1000PubMed Google Scholar). More recently several cellular mRNAs were also found to contain potential IRES elements (3Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 4Oh S.-K.

Whereas uncapped viral mRNAs by necessity utilize this cap-independent method of translation initiation, it is less clear if cellular mRNAs, presumably capped, would as well. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that cellular IRES elements, in their natural capped mRNAs, could mediate translation in poliovirus-infected cells (8Johannes G. Sarnow P. RNA (N. Y. ). 1998; 4: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar); but it remained unknown whether translation of any cellular gene is IRES-dependent under normal conditions. Recently, there have been examples of IRES-containing cellular mRNAs that are translated in cells under normal physiological conditions in which cap-dependent translation is suppressed (9Sachs A.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 243-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). During mitosis, cap-dependent translation is shut down, but translation of some proteins important for cell cycle progression continues (10Cornelis S. Bruynooghe Y. Denecker G. Van Huffel S. Tinton S. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 11Pyronnet S. Pradayrol L. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 607-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Similarly, during cell stress and apoptosis, cap-mediated translation is impaired. Nevertheless, certain mRNAs such as XIAP, the apoptosis inhibiting factor, continue to be translated under these conditions (12Holcik M. Lefebvre C. Yeh C. Chow T. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). It it not clear why or under what conditions other IRES-containing mRNAs, such as those that code for the transcription factor MYT2 (13Kim J.G. Armstrong R.C. Berndt J.A. Kim N.W. Hudson L.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 12: 119-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or the ion channel Kv1.4 (14Negulescu D. Leong L.E.-C. Chandy K.G. Semler B.L. Gutman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20109-20113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), need a cap-independent mode of translation initiation. Possibly, IRES-mediated translation allows for fine-tuned regulation of expression of these genes. Connexin-32 is a member of the family of gap junction proteins that form cell-cell channels. The protein is expressed in liver and other exocrine glands as well as in the nervous system, e.g. in Schwann cells. The connexin-32 gene is transcribed from two tissue-specific promoters producing mRNAs with different 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTRs) but identical coding regions (15Neuhaus I.M. Dahl G. Werner R. Gene. 1995; 158: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 A). In the liver, connexin-32 mRNA is made from promoter 1 (P1) and in the nervous system from promoter 2 (P2). Mutations in the connexin-32 gene have been linked to one form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX), a neurodegenerative disorder (16Bergoffen J. Scherer S.S. Wang S. Scott M.O. Bone L.J. Paul D.L. Chen K. Lensch M.W. Chance P.F. Fischbeck K.H. Science. 1993; 262: 2039-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar,17Pericak-Vance M.A. Barker D.F. Bergoffen J. Chance P. Cochrane S. Dahl N.

Hered. 1995; 45: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Whereas most of the mutations that were found in patients with CMTX are located in the coding region of the connexin-32 gene, a few non-coding mutations were also described. One of these mutations, a C→T transition found at position −458 in relation to the start codon, called mut-2 throughout this paper, was found in a family of CMTX patients (18Ionasescu V.V. Searby C. Ionasescu R. Neuhaus I.M. Werner R. Neurology. 1996; 47: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It resides in the 5′-UTR of the connexin-32 mRNA. The study of this non-coding mutation led to the discovery of an IRES element in the 5′-UTR of the connexin-32 mRNA. No consensus sequences have been determined as universal IRES recognition elements in eukaryotes. A sequence element is functionally defined as an IRES if it can mediate translation of a downstream cistron in a bicistronic mRNA (2Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA (N. Y. ). 1995; 1: 985-1000PubMed Google Scholar). The nerve-specific 5′-UTR of connexin-32 mRNA fits this definition of an IRES. Themut-2 mutation abolishes IRES function. The fact that a mutation in this sequence abolishes translation of the mRNA, leading to a CMTX phenotype, suggests that the connexin-32 IRES element is essential for the expression of the connexin-32 gene in the nervous system. The Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to mutate the pgCx32–1.8 reporter construct (15Neuhaus I.M. Dahl G. Werner R. Gene. 1995; 158: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) to make the mut-2 construct. Sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis at the University of Miami DNA Core Facility. The mut-2 construct was used for injection into the pronuclei of fertilized mouse eggs (strain B6S-JL) at the University of Miami Transgene Facility. Screening of animals was done by PCR amplification of genomic DNA and Southern blot analysis using luciferase-specific primers and probe. All animal care and use was in accordance with University of Miami guidelines. Animals were anesthetized with ether and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Brain, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve were homogenized in TRI Reagent™ (Molecular Research Center, Inc.), and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol. 1 μg of total RNA was used for RT-PCR. For amplification of the luciferase message the following primers were used: forward primer, ATATGACTCTCCAGCACCG; reverse primer (antisense luciferase coding region), CCAGAGGACTTCATTATCAG. For amplification of the endogenous connexin-32 mRNA the same forward primer and a reverse primer complementary to the Cx32 coding region (CCCTCAAGCCGTAGCATTTT) were used. For sequencing of the remainder of the mRNA other primer pairs were used (data not shown). RT-PCR products were run on 1% agarose gels, and the bands were excised, purified (Qiaex II, Qiagen), and subjected to automated DNA sequence analysis. The complete cDNAs of connexin-32 were cloned into pGEM3zf(+) (Promega) between the HindIII and EcoRI sites of the multiple cloning region to create the P1-cx32 and P2-cx32 constructs. Deletion mutagenesis was performed to remove the nucleotides between the Sp6 transcription start site and that of the natural connexin-32 mRNA.In vitro transcription from this construct yields an mRNA that is identical to the mRNA made in vivo. Plasmids were linearized with SspI. In vitrotranscription was performed with Sp6 RNA polymerase in the presence of cap structure analog (m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G). RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated by ethanol. In vitrotranslation was performed in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system supplemented with canine pancreatic microsomes and [35S]methionine. Translation products were layered onto 3% sucrose and centrifuged for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 2× SDS loading buffer, and the whole sample was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Autoradiography was performed overnight. RNA was analyzed in a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. RNA and protein levels were determined digitally on a Kodak Image Station 440CF. The firefly luciferase coding region from pGL3-promoter (Promega) was PCR-amplified with primers containingSpeI restriction sites in their 5′ ends. In addition, the forward primer used in this reaction contained EcoRI andXhoI sites to facilitate subsequent cloning. The pGL3 PCR product was then cloned into the XbaI site of pRL-CMV (Promega), containing the Renilla luciferase gene, resulting in a bicistronic vector. The P2, mut-2, and EMCV (from pIRES-EGFP, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) elements were all PCR-amplified with primers containingEcoRI and XhoI sites, 5′ and 3′, respectively, and inserted between the two luciferase genes of the bicistronic vector. All sequences were verified by DNA sequence analysis after cloning. A stable stem-loop structure (ΔG = −41 kcal/mol) similar to that used by others (14Negulescu D. Leong L.E.-C. Chandy K.G. Semler B.L. Gutman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20109-20113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was created by synthesizing two complementary oligonucleotides, which upon annealing producedPstI sites at both ends (oligo 1a, GAAAAGCGCAGGTCGCGACCGCGCATGCGCGGTCGCGACCTGCGCTAAACTGCA; oligo 1b, GTTTAGCGCAGGTCGCGACCGCGCATGCGCGGTCGCGACCTGCGCTTTTCTGCA). This stem-loop structure was inserted into the PstI site in the 5′-UTR of the Renilla gene to reduce the high level of expression due to cap-dependent translation. Another stem-loop (ΔG = −40 kcal/mol) was created in a similar way, with EcoRI sites at both ends, and inserted into the EcoRI site to reduce the background level of firefly luciferase due to ribosomal scanning and translational reinitiation (oligo 2a, AATTCAAAAGGCGAGGTCGCGAGCGCACATGTGCGCTCGCGACCT CGCCTAAAG; oligo 2b, AATTCTTTAGGCGAGGTCGCGAGCGCACATGTGCGCTCGCGACCTCGCCTTTTG). Neuro-2a cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium with 2 mml-glutamine, Earle's balanced salt solution, 0.1 mmnon-essential amino acids, 0.1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1 mm sodium pyruvate and 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 15 mm HEPES and 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Transient transfections were performed on cells that were 50–60% confluent in 60-mm dishes with 3 μg of plasmid DNA by the method of calcium phosphate precipitation (19Yu W. Dahl G. Werner R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1994; 255: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), with the exception of HeLa cells. HeLa cells were grown in 6-well plates and were 80% confluent at the time of transfection. Cells were incubated for 6 h with 6 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) mixed with 1 μg of plasmid DNA in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h, cells were lysed with passive lysis buffer, and dual luciferase assays were performed following the manufacturer's protocol. The two luciferase enzymes utilize distinct substrates. 10 μl of cell lysate was mixed with 50 μl of Luciferase Assay Reagent II (Promega, Madison, WI) and measured for firefly luciferase activity for 10 s after a 2-second delay on a Turner Luminometer TD 20/20. Stop and Glo reagent (Promega) was added to quench the firefly luciferase activity, and the activity of Renilla luciferase was measured for 10 s following a 2-second delay. All readings were greater than 100-fold above background. mut-2, a C→T transition found at position −458 in patients with CMTX, is located in the 5′-UTR of the nerve-specific connexin-32 mRNA. To determine the molecular events that might be responsible for the CMTX phenotype caused by mut-2, we used a reporter assay system. The wild-type construct, pgCx32–1.8, contains the rat connexin-32 promoter P2 and its entire 5′-UTR, including the intron, fused to the coding region of the firefly luciferase gene (Fig.1 B). We had previously shown that expression of luciferase from this construct was restricted to cells of the nervous system when expressed in transgenic mice (15Neuhaus I.M. Dahl G. Werner R. Gene. 1995; 158: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We introduced the mut-2 mutation into this construct to simulate the situation found in CMTX patients carrying this mutation. It should be noted that the human, rat, and mouse sequences are 100% identical in this region of the gene. The mut-2 construct was tested for expression of the reporter in NIH 3T3 cells. After transfection, luciferase-specific mRNA levels were measured by Northern blot analysis, and luciferase activity was measured in a scintillation counter set to single photon mode. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 1 C. Whereas both wild-type and mutant mRNA were made at significant levels, no luciferase activity could be seen in cells transfected with the mut-2 construct. Because the mut-2 mutation creates a potential donor splice site, it could be argued that the connexin-32 mRNA is not spliced correctly and thus cannot be translated. To use a system that more closely resembles the in vivo situation, we generated transgenic mice with the mutant construct. We had previously shown that expression of the wild-type construct in transgenic mice is limited to the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerve) (15Neuhaus I.M. Dahl G. Werner R. Gene. 1995; 158: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 D shows the results of RT-PCR of RNA isolated from the nervous tissues of these transgenic mice. As a control, RT-PCR was performed on the same samples with primers specific for the endogenous Cx32 mRNA. Although only semi-quantitative, the RT-PCRs revealed no gross differences in the level of expression of the transgenic and endogenous mRNAs (Fig. 1 D). The size of the RT-PCR product indicated that the mRNA was spliced correctly, suggesting that the potential splice site that was created by the mutation was not used. This was confirmed by sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products. No luciferase activity, however, was detected in these tissues. The luciferase assay is extremely sensitive. Less than one femtogram (10−20 moles) of firefly luciferase can be detected. Thus, the mutant reporter gene was properly transcribed and processed but not translated. This was in contrast to the wild-type connexin-32 reporter construct that showed high levels of luciferase activity in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves of transgenic mice (15Neuhaus I.M. Dahl G. Werner R. Gene. 1995; 158: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). How can a single nucleotide change in an untranslated region completely shut down translation? To answer this question we looked at the role of the wild-type connexin-32 5′-UTR on gene expression. Use of alternative promoters of the connexin-32 gene results in two mRNAs differing only in their 5′-UTR sequences. The effects of the two different 5′-UTRs, one from promoter P1 and the other from promoter P2, on the translational efficiency of the connexin-32 messages were examined in an in vitro translation system. The complete P1 and P2 mRNAs were transcribed in vitro (Fig.2 A) and then translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. The results showed that, whereas the P1-derived connexin-32 message was translated efficiently, little protein was made from the mRNA carrying the wild-type P2-derived 5′-UTR (Fig. 2 B). Comparison of the two 5′-UTRs revealed that the P2-derived 5′-UTR contains additional AUG codons upstream of the connexin-32 initiation site (Fig. 2 C). It has been shown that upstream AUGs (uAUGs) can inhibit cap-dependent translation (20Marth J.D. Overell R.W. Meier K.E. Krebs E.G. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1988; 332: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 21Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21886-21893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Imataka H. Nakayama K. Yasumoto K. Mizuno A. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Hayami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20668-20673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two of these uAUGs, labeled A1 and A2, have flanking sequences that are favorable for initiator codons (23Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar). As expected, when these two uAUGs in the P2 message were mutated to AAGs, more connexin protein was produced (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that the ribosomes in the reticulocyte lysate system cannot bypass the uAUGs in the P2 5′-UTR. Because nerve cells apparently have no problem translating this mRNA in vivo, they must have a mechanism that allows the ribosomes to bypass the uAUGs to allow initiation of protein synthesis from the correct AUG codon. One such mechanism would be the use of an IRES. To investigate this possibility we tested the 5′-UTRs of nerve cell-derived connexin-32 mRNA in a bicistronic assay system that is commonly used to demonstrate IRES activity. We constructed a bicistronic vector, SL2, with two luciferase open reading frames (24Schiavi A. Hudder A. Werner R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The cytomegalovirus promoter drives transcription of the mRNA for these two genes. The first gene, encoding Renilla luciferase (rLUC), should be translated by a cap-dependent mechanism, but the second gene, encoding firefly luciferase (fLUC), should be translated efficiently only if preceded by an internal ribosome entry site. The two luciferase activities can be assayed independently. The wild-type P2 or mutant P2 5′-UTR was inserted between the two luciferase genes, downstream of the second stem-loop structure. Insertion of a known IRES element from EMCV (25Witherell G.W. Schultz-Witherell C.S. Wimmer E. Virology. 1995; 214: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control. The parent vector, SL2, without any IRES, served as negative control. The vectors were transiently transfected into Neuro-2a, NIH 3T3, and HeLa cells, and Renilla (rLUC) and firefly (fLUC) luciferase activities were measured independently. IRES function is determined by the ratio of the two luciferase activities, fLUC/rLUC. The results obtained with the three types of cells are shown in Fig.3. The fLUC/rLUC ratio obtained with the SL2 control construct, containing no IRES, was normalized to the value 1 so that any ratio above this value was due to IRES function. For each cell line tested, the ratio of the two luciferase activities was calculated and normalized to the ratio of the negative control, SL2, in the same cell line. The EMCV construct showed an increase in the fLUC/rLUC ratio of 3–4 over the control. Insertion of the nerve-specific connexin-32 5′-UTR sequence into SL2 raised the fLUC/rLUC ratio by 2.5–5.5, depending on the cell type. In contrast, the 5′-UTR bearing the −458C→T point mutation showed no change in the ratio relative to the control, indicating loss of IRES function. This result, observed in all three cell types, suggested that the region of the P2 5′-UTR where the mut-2 mutation resides was essential for IRES function. Because some IRES-containing 5′-UTRs have been shown to have similar predicted structures, it has been suggested that the ribosome might recognize the secondary structure of the mRNA rather than a specific sequence. The secondary structures of the wild-type and mutant 5′-UTR sequences were predicted by using the Zuker algorithm (26Zuker M. Mathews D.H. Turner D.H.

In fact, the nucleotide at that position is in an open loop structure. This suggests that some of the nucleotides in the loop may be involved in recognition of the IRES by the ribosome. Certain sequence elements have been shown to have a role in IRES function. For example, the sequence GNRA (where N is any nucleotide, and R is a purine) is highly conserved in picornaviruses (28Hoffman M.A. Palmenberg A.C. J. Virol. 1995; 65: 4867-4873Google Scholar) and important for function of the EMCV IRES (29Robertson M.E.M. Seamons R.A. Belsham G.J. RNA (N. Y. ). 1999; 5: 1167-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The mut-2mutation is directly adjacent to this sequence and may form part of this recognition element. Additional common sequences found in IRES elements are polypyrimidine tracts, which have been shown to bind polypyrimidine tract-binding protein, and in some cases this binding was shown to be essential for IRES function. Other IRES elements contain polypyrimidine tracts consisting mainly of poly(rC) sequences. This sequence has been shown to bind the poly(rC)-binding protein, also known as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleo protein (hnRNP) E, which modulates IRES activity. Another sequence element shown to contribute to IRES function is the sequence AGACA (7Huez I. Creancier L. Audigier S. Gensac M.-C. Prats A.-C. Prats H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6178-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Many of the mammalian IRES elements (e.g. c-myc,VEGF, eIF4G, Kv1.4) contain this sequence (6Nanbru C. Lafon I. Audigier S.

The newly identified connexin-32 P2 IRES element contains two polypyrimidine tracts located at positions −442 and −381 (nt 61–68 and 121–127, respectively, in Fig. 4) as well as the AGACA sequence element, located at position −435 (nt 73–77 in Fig. 4). To further characterize the P2 IRES, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on these three elements. If the P2 IRES behaves like other IRES elements, then mutagenesis of at least one of the polypyrimidine tracts or the AGACA sequence would be expected to inhibit IRES function. Bicistronic constructs were made containing the mutated IRES elements, and these mutant constructs were assayed for luciferase activity in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig.5). The pyrimidine tract 1 (PPT1) mutant and the AGACA mutant abolished IRES function. Surprisingly, mutating the PPT2 sequence led to an increase in IRES activity. The effects of the mut-2 mutation on the expression of a reporter gene were tested by transfection experiments with themut-2 construct. The results of this experiment clearly showed that the mutant mRNA was made at levels similar to those observed with wild-type mRNA, but no luciferase activity was detected from the mut-2 construct, indicating that translation of the mutant mRNA did not occur. Identical results were obtained when the mut-2 construct was expressed in transgenic mice. These results suggested that the mut-2mutation did not affect transcription or splicing but rather prevented translation of the mutant mRNA. In a recent publication it was reported that RT-PCR of RNA from sural nerve biopsies of two heterozygous female CMTX patients revealed only wild-type connexin-32 mRNA (30Flagiello L. Cirigliano V. Strazzullo M. Cappa V. Ciccodicola A. D'Esposito M. Torrente I. Werner R. Di Iorio G. Rinaldi M. Dallapiccola B. Forabosco A. Ventruto V. D'Urso M. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 195: 361-365Google Scholar). Because of X-chromosome inactivation only one of the two alleles was expressed in a particular cell. It is possible that those cells that expressed the mutant X-chromosome were eliminated, or at least reduced in number, during development. Because of this, the presence of the mutant mRNA may have been missed by the RT-PCR. The question of how a point mutation in the 5′-UTR of an mRNA can have such a profound effect on translation is intriguing. To address this question, we studied the translation of nerve-specific connexin-32 mRNA in an in vitro reticulocyte lysate system and found that it was much less efficient than that of the liver-specific connexin-32 mRNA. This observation led us to look for the presence of an internal ribosome entry site in the 5′-UTR of the nerve-specific mRNA. Our results with a bicistronic vector system showed that the nerve cell-specific connexin-32 mRNA did indeed contain a functional IRES element. The activity of the connexin-32 IRES is similar to that of the known IRES element from EMCV. Different cell lines exhibit different degrees of IRES activity, possibly because of varying availabilities of protein factors that activate the IRES. This cell-specific behavior has also been observed with other IRES elements (31Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1536-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Further evidence that the 5′-UTR of connexin-32 mRNA represents a true IRES element was provided by our mutation studies. Several short sequence segments of the connexin-32 IRES were also found in other IRES elements. Some of these sequences had been shown to be essential for IRES activity. When these segments were mutated, IRES activity was abolished. Our site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed similar inactivation of the IRES. One mutation, however, located in PPT2, increased IRES activity severalfold. A similar gain-of-function mutation has been reported in a pyrimidine tract of another IRES element (32Zhang J. Yamada O. Ito T. Akiyama M. Hashimoto Y. Yoshida H. Makino R. Masago A. Uemura H. Araki H. Virology. 1999; 261: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results support our conclusion that the 5′-UTR of the nerve-specific connexin-32 mRNA contains abona fide IRES element. Three lines of evidence support our conclusion that this IRES element is essential for expression of connexin-32 in Schwann cells. First, the 5′-UTR of connexin-32 mRNA functions in a bicistronic vector, and the function is abolished by the mut-2 mutation. Second, even though the reporter construct containing the point mutation in the connexin-32 5′-UTR is transcribed in transfected cells and in transgenic mice, it is not translated, whereas the reporter with the wild-type connexin-32 5′-UTR is translated. Third, the mut-2mutation in humans produces a CMTX phenotype. This last point suggests that the connexin-32 protein cannot be synthesized in Schwann cells if the 5′-UTR contains the mut-2 mutation. We recently reported that the mRNA of another connexin, connexin-43, also contains an IRES element. We can only speculate about the need for connexin mRNAs to use IRES elements rather than cap structures for initiation of translation. There are many reports of connexins being detected at the mRNA level by RT-PCR in tissues where protein expression is undetectable. Perhaps the accumulation of translationally inactive mRNA allows the cell to switch on connexin protein synthesis in a matter of seconds. Such an instantaneous turning on of connexin-43 synthesis might be required, for example, in the myometrium, where gap junctions must appear very quickly at parturition to allow the onset of labor. Because the precise role that connexin-32 plays in Schwann cells is unknown, we can only speculate about the need for such fine regulation of protein synthesis. Schwann cells synthesize vast amounts of myelin and form a very distinct highly ordered structure that wraps around axons. Expression of connexin-32 in the wrong place in the membrane could be disruptive to compact myelination. Connexin-32 and myelin proteins must be mutually exclusive in the Schwann cell membrane. Indeed, connexin-32 is only found exclusively in the Schmidt-Lanterman incisures and nodes of Ranvier (16Bergoffen J. Scherer S.S. Wang S. Scott M.O. Bone L.J. Paul D.L. Chen K. Lensch M.W. Chance P.F. Fischbeck K.H. Science. 1993; 262: 2039-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar), where myelin is absent. Perhaps this is the reason why expression of connexin-32 must be tightly regulated at both the translational and transcriptional level. A more definitive answer to this question may have to wait until more is known about the factors that affect IRES activity. A more general argument for the necessity of IRES-mediated translation of connexins might be that cell-to-cell communication is so vital for a cell that the continued synthesis of connexins must be ensured even under conditions where cap-mediated translation is impeded, e.g.heat shock or stress. Many of the cellular IRES elements described thus far are in genes that code for proteins that are involved in growth control (c-Myc, FGF2, TGF-β, platelet-derived growth factor, etc.) or cell survival (Bip, Hsp 70, eIF4G, Apaf1, XIAP). The discovery of an active IRES element in the 5′-UTR of the connexin-32 gene suggests that connexin-32 may belong to one of those classes of proteins that are regulated in the same manner."

Although DNA binding is clearly required, the mechanism by which recruitment of c-Myc to target promoters results in transcriptional activation is highly debated. Much of this controversy comes from the difficulty in clearly defining a true Myc target gene. We have previously determined that cad is a bona fide Myc target gene and thus now use the cadpromoter as a model to study Myc function. Others have shown that Myc can interact indirectly with histone acetylases and have suggested that Myc mediates transcriptional activation by causing an increase in the levels of acetylated histones on target promoters. To directly test this model, we employed a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to examine the levels of acetylated histones on the cadpromoter. Although Myc was bound to the cad promoter in S phase but not in G0 phase, we found high levels of acetylated histones on the promoter in both stages. We also examined acetylated histones on the cad promoter before and after differentiation of U937 cells. Although the levels of c-Myc bound to the cad promoter were greatly reduced after differentiation, we saw high levels of acetylated histones on thecad promoter both before and after differentiation. Finally, we found that a 30-fold change in binding of N-Myc to the telomerase promoter did not result in a concomitant change in histone acetylation. Thus, recruitment of a Myc family member to a target promoter does not necessarily influence the amount of acetylated histones at that promoter. Further investigations are in progress to define the role of Myc in transcriptional activation.

It is overexpressed in tumors by many different mechanisms, including gene amplification, translocation, retroviral insertion, and other means (1Henriksson M. Luscher B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of c-Myc in cell proliferation has been documented by numerous studies. Increased expression of c-Myc is thought to be an important contributor to the neoplastic transformation of the tumor based on intentional overexpression of c-Myc in tissue culture cells and in transgenic mice. For example, cotransfection of Myc and Ras in rat embryo fibroblasts causes these cells to adopt a transformed phenotype (2Stone J. deLange T. Ramsay G. Jakobovits F. Bishop J.M. Varmus H. Lee W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1697-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Overexpression of c-Myc in tissue culture causes increased proliferation of cells with a shortened G1 phase, whereas loss of c-Myc results in slow growth and a longer G1 phase (3Bush A. Mateyka M. Dugan K. Obaya A. Adachi S. Sedivy J. Cole M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3797-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Finally, studies of transgenic mice in which c-Myc overexpression is targeted to a specific tissue have also demonstrated the importance of c-Myc in tumorigenesis. Targeted overexpression of c-Myc in the breast, B lymphocytes, and liver in transgenic mice results in increased formation of tumors in these tissues, although tumor formation is greatly enhanced by coexpression of a cooperating oncogene, such as Ha-Ras (4Sinn E.

The c-myc gene encodes a protein that is a member of the basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper family of transcription factors. Myc heterodimerizes with the protein Max through its C-terminal helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains and binds to an E box motif, which is the hexanucleotide sequence CACGTG (8Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Science. 1991; 251: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). Myc/Max heterodimers activate transcription because of a transactivation domain in the N terminus of the Myc protein (9Kato G.J. Barrett J. Villa-Garcia M. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5914-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Max is also a heterodimerization partner for the Mad proteins; however, Mad/Max heterodimers bind to E boxes and repress transcription via a transcriptional repression domain in the Mad protein (10Ayer D.E. Kretzner L. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1993; 72: 211-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). A commonly accepted model of Myc-mediated transcriptional regulation invokes an exchange of co-repressors and co-activators on Myc target genes that occurs as Myc/Max heterodimers replace Mad/Max heterodimers (Fig. 1). Specifically, it is thought that binding of Mad/Max heterodimers to promoter DNA results in transcriptional repression via histone deacetylation because of the recruitment of mSin3A or mSin3B and subsequent recruitment of HDAC1 or HDAC2 (11Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 12Sommer A. Hilfenhaus S. Menkel A. Kremmer E. Seiser C. Loidl P. Luscher B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 357-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These transcriptional repressor complexes are thought to bind to Myc target genes in quiescent or differentiated cells, i.e. in cells that contain very low amounts of Myc protein. However, proliferating cells contain increased amounts of Myc, and Myc/Max heterodimers replace Mad/Max heterodimers on target promoters. Because Myc can interact with TRRAP, which in turn interacts with the histone acetyltransferase hGCN5, it has been suggested that replacement of Mad/Max with Myc/Max results in increased amounts of acetylated histones on Myc target genes (13McMahon S.B. Wood M.A. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). It is believed that acetylation of lysines of the N-terminal tails of histones in core nucleosomes promotes chromatin remodeling, which then allows site specific transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II basal transcriptional machinery access to the start site of transcription (for review see Ref. 14Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar).Figure 1Current model for Myc-mediated transcriptional activation. Transcriptional repression mediated by Mad/Max is believed to be due to recruitment of the mSin3 repressor complex. mSin3 binds to HDACs, which remove acetyl groups from histone tails and maintain chromatin in a repressive configuration. In contrast, Myc is thought to activate target gene transcription by recruiting proteins with histone acetyltransferase activity through TRRAP or other means. The addition of acetyl groups onto histone tails would result in a more open chromatin configuration allowing RNA polymerase II to bind the promoter and begin transcription.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A direct test of the model described above requires examination of promoter occupancy by acetylated histones on a Myc target gene. However, there is great deal of uncertainty as to which genes are actually regulated by c-Myc. A recent study found that only 5% of the 6000 genes tested using DNA microchips responded to overexpression of c-Myc (15Coller H.A. Grandori C. Tamayo P. Colbert T. Lander E.S. Eisenman R.N. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3260-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). A number of candidate genes have been proposed to be targets of Myc regulation, including odc(ornithine decarboxylase) (16Bello-Fernandez C. Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7804-7808Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), the translation initiation factor eIF4E (17Jones R.M. Branda J. Johnston K.A. Polymenis M. Gadd M. Rustgi A. Callanan L. Schmidt E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4754-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the catalytic subunit of telomerase (tert) (18Wang J.L. Xie L.Y. Allan S. Beach D. G. J., H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1769-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), and cdk4 (19Hermeking H. Rago C. Schuhmacher M. Li Q. Barrett J.F. Obaya A.J. O'Connell B.C. Mateyak M.K. Tam W.

Another complicating factor in the study of Myc target genes is the modest transcriptional activity mediated by the Myc protein. Most genes that respond to increased levels of c-Myc change by only 2–5-fold. Some of the difficulty in identifying a Myc target gene may be due to the presence of other, more abundant, proteins in the cell (such as USF) that can bind to E boxes. Therefore, identification of Myc target genes requires demonstrating that binding of Myc to the promoter region is required for transcriptional regulation. We have recently shown a correlation between promoter occupancy by c-Myc and transcriptional activation of the cad(carbamoyl phosphate synthase/aspartate transcarbamoylase/dihydroorotase) gene. The cadgene encodes the trifunctional enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthase/aspartate carbamoyltransferase/dihydroorotase, which catalyzes the first three rate-limiting steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis.cad expression is minimal in quiescent cells, and expression increases as cells enter the cell cycle, with peak expression occurring at the G1/S phase boundary. The cad gene contains an E box downstream from the transcription start site that is conserved in the mouse, rat, hamster, and human homologues of the gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies have shown that both Myc and USF bind to the cad promoter (20Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, mutations flanking the E box that disrupt Myc binding to the cad promoter but do not affect USF binding result in a loss of growth regulation (21Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8389-8399Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that cad is abona fide Myc target gene, and thus in the studies described below we have used the cad promoter to study Myc function. We have used a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to determine whether changes in histone acetylation correlate with Myc-mediated changes incad expression. We found only modest differences in histone acetylation on the cad promoter as NIH3T3 cells enter the cell cycle from quiescence or as U937 cells exit the cell cycle into a differentiated state. Furthermore, our studies indicate that high levels of histone acetylation are present at the cadpromoter in G0 and in S phase. This high degree of acetylation is not seen in the transcribed regions of thecad gene or at a promoter that is never active in NIH3T3 cells. Additionally, we have examined an N-Myc responsive promoter in neuroblastoma cells, and we do not see changes in histone acetylation that correlate with N-Myc binding. Our results suggest that although high levels of histone acetylation can identify a promoter that has transcriptional potential in a certain cell type, histone acetylation does not appear to be the mechanism by which Myc regulates transcription. NIH3T3 cell cultures were maintained and synchronized as described previously (22Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6–8 × 106 cells were seeded into 500-cm2 tissue culture dishes (1–2 dishes were used per antibody per time point in the formaldehyde cross-linking experiments) and incubated in starvation medium for 48–72 h. Cells were then either stimulated to enter the cell cycle by the addition of stimulation medium for 4 h (early G1 phase) or 12 h (G1/S phase) prior to cross-linking. Progression of the cells through the cell cycle was measured by flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells as described previously (23Means A.L. Slansky J.E. McMahon S.L. Knuth M.W. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Data were acquired on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using CellQuest acquisition and analysis software. The treatment of G0 phase cells with trichostatin A (TSA)1 was performed as follows. 4 × 106 cells were seeded into 225-cm2 tissue culture flasks (5 flasks/experimental condition; combined prior to cell lysis) and incubated in starvation medium for 48–52 h to induce quiescence. Trichostatin A (Sigma) (1 mg/ml, solubilized in 100% ethanol) was diluted in medium and added to the cells at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml of medium (3.30 μm). Cells were then incubated for an additional 16–20 h prior to harvesting. Untreated cells received an equal volume of ethanol without TSA, whereas S phase cells received only stimulation medium 12 h prior to harvesting of RNA and protein. U937 cells were maintained in spinner flasks containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Differentiation of U937 cells was performed by adding all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) to a final concentration of 1 μm. Cells were then incubated for an additional 5 days prior to harvesting; cell cycle analysis of U937 cells was performed as described above for 3T3 cells. Tet21N cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 4 mm l-glutamine. Tetracycline was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml for 2 weeks to repress N-Myc transcription. RNA preparation and RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (20Boyd K.E.

For analysis ofcad mRNA, 35–40 μg of cytoplasmic RNA from serum-starved, serum-stimulated, or TSA-treated cells was incubated with 1 × 105 cpm of probe at 65 °C for 3 h. For analysis of glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, 5–10 μg of cytoplasmic RNA was incubated with 1.7 × 104cpm of probe at 52 °C for 3 h. Unhybridized RNA was digested by the addition of 10 μg of RNase A. The products were resolved on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Signals were collected using a PhosphorImager and quantitated using ImageQuant v4.2a (Molecular Dynamics). Acid-soluble protein was prepared from the nuclei of cells that were harvested for cytoplasmic RNA. The nuclear pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in 10 volumes of protein extraction buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol). Sulfuric acid was added dropwise to a final concentration of 0.4 n (0.2 m) while vortexing gently, and the nuclear lysates were incubated on ice for 1 h with vigorous vortexing every 10 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf 5415C centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precipitated with 3 volumes of 20% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 1 h with vigorous vortexing every 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was washed twice with acidified acetone (0.1% HCl) and twice with acetone, dried completely by desiccation for 30 min, resuspended in 200 μl of H2O, and stored at 4 °C overnight. The concentration and purity of each acid-soluble histone protein preparation was determined using: 1) the Bio-Rad protein assay followed by measurement of A595 using a Shimadzu UV16OU Spectrophotometer and 2) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Protein preparations were stored at −80 °C. For analysis of histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels, 15 μg of acid-soluble protein was used for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Western blot analysis with anti-acetylated histone H3 06–599 (Upstate Biotechnology) or anti-acetylated histone H4 06–598 (Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies. The formaldehyde cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of tissue culture cells were performed as described previously with the following modifications (20Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J.

David Allis), anti-N-Myc sc-791 (Santa Cruz), anti-Max sc-765-X (Santa Cruz), or no antibody, as indicated. Before the first wash, 20% of the supernatant from the IP without antibody for each condition was saved as total input chromatin and was processed with the eluted IPs beginning with the cross-linking reversal step. After the final ethanol precipitation, each IP sample was resuspended in 30 μl of PCR grade TE (10 mmTris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA). Total input chromatin samples were resuspended in 30 μl of TE. For formaldehyde cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of chromatin from mouse livers, livers were harvested from newborn and adult C57BL/6J mice. After harvesting, livers were minced with a razor blade, brought up in 20 ml of medium, and cross-linked for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by addition of 0.125 m glycine. Cross-linked livers were then homogenized to individual cells using a Medi-Machine (BD Bioscience). Cells were transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, centrifuged at 1000 rpm in an Eppendorf 541C Centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the cells, which were then resuspended in cell lysis buffer, and processed for chromatin immunoprecipitation as described above. PCR reactions contained 2 μl of IP sample or 2 μl of a 1:100 dilution of input sample, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 50 ng of each primer, 200 μm each dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, 4 μl of 5 m betaine (Sigma), 1× Thermophilic buffer (Promega), and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) in 20 μl of total volume. After 34–36 cycles of amplification, 8 μl of the PCR products was electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel, and DNA was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. Signals were quantitated using ImageQuant v4.2 (Molecular Dynamics). Fold changes in acetylation were calculated by first dividing the IP signal intensity by the input signal intensity (to control for slightly different cells numbers at each time point) for both the G1/S sample and the G0 sample. Then, the G1/S value was divided by the G0 value.

To test the hypothesis that Myc target genes are regulated via changes in histone acetylation, we first determined whether increased histone acetylation could substitute for promoter-bound Myc to activate transcription of the cad promoter. Quiescent NIH3T3 cells, which contain very low levels of Myc protein, were treated with the drug TSA, an inhibitor of histone deacetylases. Treatment of cells with TSA results in genome-wide increases in the levels of histone acetylation and has been shown to alter the expression of a number of genes (25Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with increasing amounts of TSA for 16 h and harvested for isolation of histones and RNA. As shown in Fig.2 A, TSA treatment of NIH3T3 cells causes a large increase in the amount of acetylated histone H3 and acetylated histone H4. We then examined cad mRNA levels using an RNase protection assay in which a radiolabeled probe is hybridized to the cad message and unprotected RNA is digested with RNase A (Fig. 2 B). We found that treatment of quiescent NIH3T3 cells with even low levels of TSA increased transcription of cad mRNA to approximately S phase levels. This result suggests that forced histone acetylation can bypass regulation of target genes by Myc and supports the model that recruitment of Myc may result in increased acetylation of target promoter histones. The results obtained from treatment of NIH3T3 cells with TSA suggest that histone acetylation may play a role in activation of cadtranscription. To test this hypothesis, we first determined whether the level of acetylation of bulk histones increased when quiescent cells re-entered the cell cycle. NIH3T3 cells were synchronized by starvation in low serum medium for 48 h and then made to progress through the cell cycle through the addition of serum. Flow cytometry was performed to ensure that cells were synchronized and progressing through the cell cycle (Fig. 3 A). Western analysis shows that there was no increase in acetylated histone H3 or acetylated histone H4 in S phase, as compared with quiescent cells (Fig. 2 A), although the antibodies clearly had the ability to detect acetylated histones. However, it was possible that histones bound to specific promoter regions would show a difference in acetylation. Therefore, we performed a formaldehyde cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to determine the levels of histone acetylation at the cad promoter as cells progress from G0 to S phase. Cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde and, after sonicating the chromatin to a length of about 500 base pairs, DNA was immunoprecipitated with antibodies that recognize histones acetylated at their N-terminal tails. After immunoprecipitation, proteins were digested, and purified DNA was analyzed by PCR. We found easily detectable levels of acetylated histone H3 on thecad promoter in quiescent cells when the promoter is inactive, but there was no increase in the amount of acetylated H3 bound to the cad promoter as cells progressed to the G1/S phase boundary (Fig. 3 B). However, the expected increase in binding of Myc to the cad promoter did occur. We also used an antibody that recognized phosphorylated H3 because it has been previously shown that histone H3 phosphorylation levels change throughout the cell cycle at immediate early gene promoters (26Chadee D.N. Hendzel M.J. Tylipski C.P. Allis C.D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24914-24920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), However, we found very low levels of histone H3 phosphorylation at the cad promoter in either G0or S phase. To ensure that the results of the first experiment were valid, we performed a second time course and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment. This time, we used the antibody that recognizes acetylated histone H3 and two different antibodies that recognize acetylated histone H4. As before, the amount of Myc bound to the cadpromoter increased about 7-fold by the G1/S phase boundary. However, we saw only modest increases in the amount of acetylated histone H3. The two different acetylated histone H4 antibodies gave slightly different results. One antibody showed no increase, whereas the other antibody showed a 3.8-fold increase in acetylation. We note that the Western blotting results shown above demonstrate the specificity of the antibodies. We have repeated the chromatin immunoprecipitation a number of times, and although we have seen varying changes in Myc binding as NIH3T3 cells progress through the cell cycle, we do not see a correlation between the increase in Myc binding and the change in histone acetylation at the cadpromoter. The average change in acetylation at the cadpromoter from G0 to G1/S is only about 1.4-fold for histone H3 and 1.4-fold for histone H4 (Fig. 3 D). We also used a different set of primers to monitor changes in acetylation of histones H3 and H4 within the first 500 nucleotides of transcribed sequences of the cad gene; similar to the results shown above for the cad promoter, all changes observed were 2-fold or less (data not shown). Although we did see modest changes in histone acetylation on the cad promoter, it was unclear whether these changes were linked to transcription or whether they were simply due to cell cycle stage-specific changes in histone abundance or to general changes in chromatin structure that occur irrespective of transcription. With the goal of distinguishing between these possibilities, we turned to a second system in which Myc is known to mediate changes in gene expression. In general, differentiated cells express very low levels of Myc protein. The decrease in transcription of Myc target genes because of differentiation is a long term change, and Myc may regulate transcription during an irreversible withdrawal from the cell cycle in a different manner than it does at the G1/S phase boundary. For example, maintaining high levels of histone acetylation on the cad promoter throughout the cell cycle may be necessary for the cyclical regulation of the gene. However, it is possible that histone acetylation on the cadpromoter may be decreased when cells are terminally differentiated. To examine histone acetylation on the cad promoter in a differentiation system we chose to use U937 cells, which are a human monocyte cell line. U937 cells can be made to differentiate into granulocytes with retinoic acid, and it has been previously shown that Myc mRNA and protein levels are greatly decreased after differentiation of these cells (27Larsson L.G. Bahram F. Burkhardt H. Luscher B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). U937 cells were differentiated for 5 days with 1 μm all-trans-retinoic acid, treated and untreated cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde, and chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed with antibodies recognizing Myc and acetylated histones H3 and H4. To ensure that cells treated with retinoic acid had exited the cell cycle, we examined the DNA content of the cells using flow cytometry and found that almost all the"

The entire R1128 gene cluster was cloned and expressed in Streptomyces lividans, a genetically well developed heterologous host. In addition to R1128C, a novel optically active natural product, designated HU235, was isolated. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the biosynthetic gene cluster revealed genes encoding two ketosynthases, a chain length factor, an acyl transferase, three acetyl-CoA carboxylase subunits, two cyclases, two oxygenases, an amidase, and remarkably, two acyl carrier proteins. Feeding studies indicate that the unusual 4-methylvaleryl side chain of R1128C is derived from valine. Together with the absence of a dedicated ketoreductase, dehydratase, or enoylreductase within the R1128 gene cluster, this suggests a functional link between fatty acid biosynthesis and R1128 biosynthesis in the engineered host.

However, ER antagonists have variable effects in different target tissues. For example, tamoxifen is an ER antagonist in breast tissue but an ER agonist in bone (1Love R.R. Mazess R.B. Barden H.S. Epstein S. Newcomb P.A. Jordan V.C. Carbone P.P. DeMets D.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 26: 852-856Crossref Scopus (1013) Google Scholar) and uterine (2Kedar R.P. Bourne T.H. Powles T.J. Collins W.P.

Raloxifene is also an ER antagonist in breast tissue; however, it exerts agonist activity in bone but not uterine tissue (3Black L.J. Sato M. Rowley E.R. Magee D.E. Bekele A. Williams D.C. Cullinan G.J. Bendele R. Kauffman R.F. Bensch W.R. Frolik C.A. Termine J.D. Bryant H.U. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that this tissue-dependent variability may be caused by differential ligand activation of ERα and ERβ at AP1 transcription activation sites (4Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). There is thus a significant need for new ER antagonists that can inhibit ER function at both ER- and AP1-dependent DNA binding sites. The isolation, fermentation, structures, and properties of R1128 A–D (Fig. 1) were described in 1993 (5Hori Y. Abe Y. Ezaki M. Goto T. Okuhara M. Kohsaka M. J. Antibiot.

( Tokyo ). 1993; 46: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These molecules, which were identified as potent ER antagonists, had IC50 values in the range of 0.1–0.3 μm. Although these activities were approximately 7–17-fold less than that of tamoxifen, their selectivity (50-fold better binding to ER as compared with the androgen receptor) and low toxicity (significant inhibition of tumor volume in a subrenal capsule assay at 100 mg/kg; no acute toxicity in mice or rats at 500 mg/kg) profiles were promising (7Hori Y. Abe Y. Nishimura M. Goto T. Okuhara M. Kohsaka M. J. Antibiot. ( Tokyo ). 1993; 46: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, the development of rational approaches to manipulate the structures of these natural products offers an opportunity to optimize their pharmacological properties. As a first step in this direction, we describe the cloning and nucleotide sequence of the R1128 biosynthetic gene cluster and its expression in a model heterologous host, Streptomyces lividans K4-114 (8Ziermann R. Betlach M.C. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We also present evidence that highlights an unusual mechanism for priming this polyketide synthase (PKS). SCP2* is a widely used low-copy vector for Streptomyces sp. (9Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H.

Although cosmid derivatives of SCP2* have been described earlier (10Bierman M. Logan R. O'Brien K. Seno E.T. Rao R.N. Schoner B.E. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 116: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar), their ability to replicate in Streptomyces sp. in a stable manner has not been tested.

To make it suitable for library construction, a series of cloning steps were used to replace the 10.5-kbHindIII/EcoRI segment of pRM5 with the followingcos site containing a 390-base pair sequence (NsiI and EcoRI sites (Fig. 2) are underlined): AAGCTAATTC ATAGATGCAT GTTTGACCGC TTATCATCGA TAAGCTCTGC TTTTTGTTGA CTTCCATTGT TCATTCCACG GACAAAAACA GAGAAAGGAA ACGACAGAGG CCAAAAAGCT CGCTTTCAGC ACCTGTCGTT TCCTTTCTTT TCAGAGGGTA TTTTAAATAA AAACATTAAG TTATGACGAA GAAGAACGGA AACGCCTTAA ACCGGAAAAT TTTCATAAAT AGCGAAAACC CGCGAGGTCG CCGCCCCGTA ACAAGGCGGA TCGCCGGAAA GGACCCGCAA ATGATAATAA TTATCAATTG CATACTATCG ACGGCACTGC TGCCTGCATG GGTCTAGAAA AAATCCGGAC CCACTAGTCC CAGATCTAAA GCTAGAATTC. A cosmid library was constructed in pHU204 using genomic DNA fromStreptomyces sp. R1128. The average insert size was greater than 30 kb. The entire library was transformed into S. lividans K4-114 without further screening. All recombinant DNA procedures and Streptomyces cloning procedures were according to standard protocols (9Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P.

The extract was dried with MgSO4, evaporated, and subjected to column chromatography (SiO2, hexane/ethyl acetate, 1:1). The yellow fractions were dried and further separated on a preparative reverse-phase HPLC column ((25 × 150)-mm C18-IP column (Beckman); isocratic run with 1% acetic acid in water/CH3CN 55:45; flow rate, 20 ml/min; UV-detection with λ of 250 and 350 nm). Three major UV-active peaks (t R = 10.2, 22.5, and 28.3 min) were collected, dried, and analyzed. For the preparation of 13C-labeled polyketides, cultures were grown on R2YE agar medium supplemented with 500 mg/liter sodium [1,2-13C]acetate for 7 days. Products were isolated as described above. Enrichment levels of 0.6% were observed. For supplementation experiments with amino acids, cultures of S. lividans were grown in liquid SMM (13Strauch E. Takano E. Baylis H.A. Bibb M.J. Mol.

A minimal prerequisite for biosynthetic engineering of natural products is the availability of cloned genes, which are typically clustered and coordinately regulated in microorganisms. An ideal strategy for cloning a desired gene cluster would involve its direct identification through heterologous expression in a biologically well studied host. Building on the pioneering studies of Malpartida and Hopwood (14Malpartida F. Hopwood D.A. Nature. 1984; 309: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), recent studies have successfully demonstrated the ability of the model organism, S. lividans, to produce heterologous aromatic polyketides (15Hong S.T. Carney J.R. Gould S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 470-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gould S.J. Hong S.T. Carney J.R. J. Antibiot. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 51: 52-57Google Scholar). However, because the site-specific integrative plasmids used in such efforts could not be readily recovered from transformants of interest, genomic libraries had to be pre-screened for candidate cosmids carrying putative polyketide genes prior to their transfer into S. lividans. There is thus a need for new self-replicating shuttle vectors with carrying capacity for large DNA fragments. We developed a vector pHU204 that has such properties. Plasmid pHU204 (12.16 kb, Fig. 2) is a derivative of pRM5 (11McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. Science. 1993; 262: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). It includes the SCP2* replicon and the colE1 replicon, the thiostrepton (tsr) and carbenicillin (bla) drug resistance genes, and a cos site. Whereas its carrying capacity as a cosmid cloning vector in Escherichia coli is limited to a 40-kb insert, the SCP2* replicon has been used to construct up to 70 kb plasmids in S. lividans. 2Z. Hu, unpublished results. Anticipating that the R1128 gene cluster was under 40 kb in size, a cosmid library was constructed in pHU204 using genomic DNA derived from Streptomyces sp. R1128, the R1128 producer. The entire library was transformed without prior screening into S. lividans K4-114. Several pigmented colonies were identified; one of them, K4-114/pHU235 was cultivated on a larger scale (500 ml on semi-solid R5 agar medium). After neutral extraction and pre-purification using column chromatography, two major UV-active peaks were collected from reverse-phase HPLC, dried, and analyzed. Mass-,1H and 13C NMR spectra revealed that one of the compounds was identical to R1128C. The purified yield of the compound was 1 mg/liter. The second compound, designated HU235, was produced in considerably greater quantities (16 mg/liter). A combination of1H, 13C, 1H,1H COSY, HMBC, HMQC, ROESY-NMR, and IR spectroscopy was used to deduce that HU235 was a novel tetrahydroanthracenone derivative, 3,6,8,9-tetrahydroxy-2-isobutyl-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-anthracenone (Fig. 3; note that the carbon atom numbering in the figure is intended to facilitate tracing of the polyketide backbone, and not as per IUPAC recommendations). Mass spectrometry was performed with the acetylated derivatives. Although nuclear Overhauser effect NMR measurements did not allow unambiguous determination of the relative configurations of the two chiral centers of the molecule, optical rotation analysis revealed that the compound HU235 was optically active ([α]D = 33.0°). This suggests that an enzyme-catalyzed reaction might be involved in the final steps of HU235 formation (see below). Because the carbon chain backbone of HU235 is identical to that of R1128C, the polyketide origin of this product was established by the feeding of sodium [1,2-13C]acetate (Fig. 3). The carbon skeleton comprised of C-2 to C-14 was labeled as expected. (C-1 is eliminated via decarboxylation.) Interestingly, the incorporation efficiency of labeled acetate into the C-15–C-16 multicarbon unit was comparable with that in the remaining multicarbon units of HU235, suggesting that the 4-methylvaleryl moiety is contemporaneously synthesized with the rest of the polyketide skeleton. If so, this raises the question as to the mechanism of reduction of the C-17 carbon atom (discussed below). Cosmid pHU235 was initially sequenced to about 3–4 × coverage using a shotgun approach. Based on this data a 17-kb region of the cosmid was identified that appeared to contain all the biosynthetic genes; accurate sequence of this region was obtained through a combination of subcloning and oligonucleotide walking. The results of sequence analysis of this segment of pHU235 are graphically presented in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 1.Table ILocation and deduced functions of open reading frames (ORFs) in the R1128 gene clusterORFsHomologsGeneStart 1-aAll start codons are ATG except zhuJ and zhuM, which feature GTG.Stop 1-bAll stop codons are TGA except zhuA, zhuE, and zhuJ, which feature TAG.Predicted Protein (kDa)Shine-Dalgarno sequence (relative position to start codon)GeneDeduced Role% identityRef.zhuA162337646AGGAGGA (−13)actI-ORF2Chain length factor (CLF)5728Fernández-Moreno M.A. Martı́nez E.

Open table in a new tab Fourteen genes involved in R1128 biosynthesis were identified. Their putative functions were assigned based on homology with aromatic PKS genes of known function (17Richardson, M. T., and Khosla, C. (1999) Comprehensive Natural Products (Sankawa, U., ed) Vol. 1, pp. 473–494, Elsevier.Google Scholar, 18Khosla C. Gokhale R. Jacobsen J.R. Cane D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 219-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). As in the case of daunorubicin biosynthesis (19Hutchinson C.R. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2525-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), zhuC and zhuH encode an acyltransferase and a primer unit-specific ketosynthase, respectively. Homologs of these genes are found in aromatic PKS gene clusters that utilize primers derived from sources other than malonyl-CoA. The polyketide backbones of R1128A, R1128B, and R1128C are presumably primed by acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and isobutyryl-CoA, respectively. Together with an acyl carrier protein (ACP; encoded by eitherzhuG or zhuN), a ketoreductase, a dehydratase, and an enoylreductase, ZhuC and ZhuH are predicted to generate an ACP-bound intermediate (butyryl-ACP, valeryl-ACP, or 4-methylvaleryl-ACP, respectively) (Fig.5). This intermediate is then transferred onto the ketosynthase-chain length factor (KS-CLF) heterodimer, encoded by zhuA and zhuB, respectively. Together with an ACP (encoded by either zhuG or zhuN) and a malonyl-CoA:ACP malonyltransferase (MAT), which is recruited from the endogenous fatty acid synthase, the KS-CLF heterodimer catalyzes seven additional extension cycles to produce the full-length polyketide chain shown in Fig. 5 (20Carreras C.W. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2084-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This reactive intermediate subsequently undergoes stagewise cyclization and aromatization, catalyzed by thezhuI and zhuJ gene products, to yield the bicyclic intermediate shown in Fig. 5 (21McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 10855-10859Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Lomovskaya N. Doi-Katayama Y. Filippini S. Nastro C. Fonstein L. Gallo M. Colombo A.L. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2379-2386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final cyclization leading to the formation of the anthracycline core of the R1128 compounds is presumably non-catalytic, a feature that is precedented in the biosynthesis of aloesaponarin II (11McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. Science. 1993; 262: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 23Bartel P.L. Zhu C.B. Lampel J.S. Dosch D.C. Conners N.C. Strohl W.R. Beale Jr., J.M. Floss H.G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4816-4826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two homologous cytochrome P450 type oxygenases are encoded by zhuK andzhuM. Homologs of these enzymes are present in several other aromatic polyketide biosynthetic pathways. For example, urdEencodes a gene responsible for the hydroxylation of tetracenomycin to 6-hydroxytetracenomycin (24Decker H. Haag S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6126-6136Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); a similar reaction would be required for anthraquinone formation in the R1128 biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 5). The reason for the presence of two such enzymes in the R1128 gene cluster is unknown, and perhaps reflects redundancy in function. In addition to the above biosynthetic enzymes, the R1128 gene cluster also encodes two other unusual enzymes. First, it contains a homolog (zhuL) of a class of known amidases, such as an enantioselective amidase from a Rhodococcus strain that hydrolyzes 2-arylpropionamides (25Mayaux J.F. Cerbelaud E. Soubrier F. Yeh P. Blanche F. Petre D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6694-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of ZhuL in R1128 biosynthesis is unclear, but this family of amidases also shares similarity to the GatA subunit of glutamyl-tRNAGlnamidotransferases (e.g. the Deinococcus radiodurans enzyme (26Curnow A.W. Tumbula D.L. Pelaschier J.T. Min B. Soll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12838-12843Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)), which is responsible for amide hydrolysis as well as transfer of the resulting amine to glutamyl-tRNA. Perhaps the conserved aminotransferase activity in ZhuL allows it to function as a valine deaminase, an enzyme that is predicted to be involved in conversion of valine into isobutyryl-CoA required for R1128C biosynthesis (see below). Second, the gene cluster encodes three polypeptides, ZhuD, ZhuE, and ZhuF that are homologous to acetyl-CoA carboxylase subunits. ZhuD is predicted to be a biotin carboxylase, ZhuE is predicted to be a biotin carboxyl carrier protein, whereas ZhuF is homologous to carboxyl transferase subunits. Recent studies on jadomycin biosynthesis have revealed the presence of zhuDand zhuE homologs (but not a zhuF homolog) in the jadomycin gene cluster (27Han L. Yang K. Kulowski K. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Hutchinson C.R. Vining L.C. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Genetic inactivation of these subunits leads to significant reduction in jadomycin biosynthesis, underscoring the role of this multisubunit enzyme in the biosynthesis of malonyl-CoA precursors for polyketide biosynthesis. Perhaps the most interesting feature of the R1128 gene cluster is the presence of not one but two ACP genes. This feature is absent in biochemically characterized PKS pathways such as actinorhodin (28Fernández-Moreno M.A. Martı́nez E. Boto L. Hopwood D.A. Malpartida F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19278-19290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or daunorubicin (29Grimm A. Madduri K. Ali A. Hutchinson C.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 151: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 30Ye J. Dickens M.L. Plater R. Li Y. Lawrence J. Strohl W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6270-6280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but is present in the frenolicin PKS (31Bibb M.J. Sherman D.H. Omura S. Hopwood D.A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 142: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (see also GenBank 228 /EBI accession number AAC18105). As in R1128A, the frenolicin polyketide backbone is presumably derived by transfer of a butyryl unit onto the KS-CLF heterodimer (32McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11671-11675Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The mechanistic implications of a dual ACP aromatic PKS system are discussed below. We simply note here that ZhuN is more similar to FrnN (58% identity with FrnN versus 40% identity with FrnJ) (31Bibb M.J. Sherman D.H. Omura S. Hopwood D.A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 142: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), whereas ZhuG is more similar to FrnJ (46% identity with FrnJ versus 40% identity with FrnN, GenBank 228 /EBI accession number AAC18105). Flanking the zhuI locus are three regulatory genes and three genes encoding membrane-bound proteins that are presumably involved in transcriptional control and product export, respectively. Although their nucleotide sequence has not been determined in an error-free form, sufficient coverage was obtained to deduce their functions based on homology (data not shown). No open reading frame could be detected within approximately 1 kb of the zhuA gene, suggesting thatzhuA represents the other end of the R1128 gene cluster. The structures of both HU235 and R1128C suggest the formation of an early 4-methylvaleryl intermediate. Similar branched-chain moieties are present in severalStreptomyces-derived fatty acids and polyketides and are derived from the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (33Zhang Y.X. Denoya C.D. Skinner D.D. Fedechko R.W. McArthur H.A. Morgenstern M.R. Davies R.A. Lobo S. Reynolds K.A. Hutchinson C.R. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2323-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To probe the origin of this unusual starter unit, S. lividansK4-114/pHU235 was grown for 8 days in defined SMM liquid medium (13Strauch E. Takano E. Baylis H.A. Bibb M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) in the presence of leucine or valine. The titers of HU235 and R1128C, quantified via HPLC, are shown in Table 2. Although overall production levels are lower in SMM medium than in R2YE medium (reported above), productivity is dramatically enhanced upon valine supplementation, confirming that the 4-methylvaleryl moiety of R1128C is derived from valine. Oxidation of valine to yield isobutyryl-CoA is known to involve elimination of the carboxyl group as carbon dioxide (33Zhang Y.X. Denoya C.D. Skinner D.D. Fedechko R.W. McArthur H.A. Morgenstern M.R. Davies R.A. Lobo S. Reynolds K.A. Hutchinson C.R. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2323-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).

Here, we have studied the signal transduction properties of XLαs. Like Gαs, XLαs undergoes a conformational change upon binding of GTPγS (guanosine 5′-O-(thio)triphosphate), as revealed by its partial resistance to tryptic digestion, which generated the same fragments as in the case of Gαs. Two approaches were used to analyze XLαs-βγ interactions: (i) ADP-ribosylation by cholera toxin to detect even weak or transient XLαs-βγ interactions and (ii) sucrose density gradient centrifugation to reveal stable heterotrimer formation. The addition of βγ subunits resulted in an increased ADP-ribosylation of XLαs as well as an increased sedimentation rate of XLαs in sucrose density gradients, indicating that XLαs interacts with the βγ dimer. Surprisingly, however, XLαs, in contrast to Gαs, was not activated by the β2-adrenergic receptor upon reconstitution of S49cyc− membranes. Similarly, using photoaffinity labeling of pituitary membranes with azidoanilide-GTP, XLαs was not activated upon stimulation of pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptors or other Gαs-coupled receptors known to be present in these membranes, whereas Gαs was. Despite the apparent inability of XLαs to undergo receptor-mediated activation, XLαs-GTPγS markedly stimulated adenylyl cyclase in S49cyc− membranes. Moreover, transfection of PC12 cells with a GTPase-deficient mutant of XLαs, XLαs-Q548L, resulted in a massive increase in adenylyl cyclase activity. Our results suggest that in neuroendocrine cells, the two related G proteins, Gαs and XLαs, exhibit distinct properties with regard to receptor-mediated activation but converge onto the same effector system, adenylyl cyclase.

XLαs consists of a novel 37-kDa XL domain followed by a 41-kDa αs domain encoded by exons 2-13 of the Gαs gene (1Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B.

Given the subcellular localization of XLαs and its domain structure and in light of the observation that the C-terminal sequence of the XL domain shows a high homology to the exon 1-encoded portion of Gαs (1Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), which promotes binding to the βγ complex, it is important to determine whether or not XLαs functions, like Gαs, in signal transduction. In the present study, we addressed the following questions. First, does XLαs exchange guanine nucleotides and, if so, does this guanine nucleotide exchange lead to a conformational change of XLαs, as has been reported for Gαs (3Audigier Y. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar)? Second, does XLαs interact with the βγ complex? Third, does XLαs couple to heptahelical receptors and, if so, to which ones? And, finally, does XLαs activate adenylyl cyclase, the classical Gαs effector? The rabbit antiserum RK5 (anti-XL) against the EPAA-repeats in the XL domain of XLαs was that described in the preceding paper (32Pasolli H.A. Klemke M. Kehlenbach R.H. Wang Y. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33622-33632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The rabbit antiserum against the C-terminal decapeptide of Gαs and XLαs (anti-αs C terminus) was the same as described previously (1Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The plasmid CDM8-XLαs, originally called CDM8-XL, contains a 2.6-kilobase insert starting at nucleotide 380 of the originally published sequence (1Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and encodes the entire XLαs protein sequence (see correction of translational start (2Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 253Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar)) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promotor. For construction of CDM8-XLαs-wt, the plasmid pGEM-Gαs (kindly provided by Dr. Peter Gierschik, University of Ulm), that encodes the entire rat Gαs protein sequence, was cut with Eco47III andNsiI. The resulting 667-nucleotide fragment, corresponding to amino acid residues 165–386 of Gαs, was cloned into theEco47III and NsiI sites of CDM8-XLαs, resulting in a predicted XLαs protein sequence containing a leucine at position 519 (corrected translational start (2Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 253Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar)) instead of a proline as in CDM8-XLαs (amino acid residue 650 of originally published sequence (1Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar)). The nucleotide exchange and the ligation sites were confirmed by sequencing. For construction of CDM8-XLαs-Q548L, the plasmid pVL-1393-Gαs-Q227L (kindly provided by Dr. Peter Gierschik, University of Ulm), which encodes the entire human Gαs protein sequence, was cut withEco47III and NsiI. The resulting 667-nucleotide fragment, corresponding to amino acid residues 165–386 of Gαs, was cloned into the Eco47III and NsiI sites of CDM8-XLαs, resulting in a predicted XLαs protein sequence carrying a single point mutation (Gln → Leu) at amino acid residue 548 (corrected translational start (2Kehlenbach R.H.

Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The other differences in nucleotide sequence between human pVL-1393-Gαs-Q227L and the rat CDM8-XLαs do not cause any amino acid sequence variation between the two species.) The nucleotide exchange and the ligation sites were confirmed by sequencing. The plasmid CDM8-Gαs (kindly provided by Yanzhuang Wang of our laboratory) encodes the entire rat Gαs protein sequence under the control of the cytomegalovirus promotor. After linearization by NdeI, 10 μg of each plasmid (CDM8-Gαs and CDM8-XLαs-wt) was in vitro transcribed for 4 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 100 μl containing 20 μl of 5× transcription buffer (MBI Fermentas), 3 μl each of ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP (100 mm each), 2 μl of RNase Inhibitor (40 units/μl), 3 μl of T7 RNA polymerase (40 units/μl), and nuclease-free distilled H2O. Two h after the addition of the T7 RNA polymerase, another 3 μl of the polymerase were added. Two μl of a 1:10 dilution of the total in vitro transcription mixture were used directly for in vitro translation. Cell-free translation of in vitro transcribed RNAs was carried out at 30 °C for 1 h using the Promega nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysate following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a typical translation mixture contained 35 μl of the reticulocyte lysate, 7 μl of nuclease-free distilled H2O, 1 μl of RNase Inhibitor (40 units/μl), 1 μl of the amino acid mixture without methionine, 4 μl of thel-[35S]Met/Cys ProMixTM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1000 Ci mmol−1), and 2 μl of the 1:10 diluted total in vitro transcription mixture containing the RNA template. The non-radioactive in vitrotranslation for ADP-ribosylation and the reconstitution of S49cyc− membranes was performed with 1 μl of the amino acid mixture without methionine and 1 μl of the amino acid mixture without cysteine. All steps were performed at 4 °C. In vitrotranslated Gαs and XLαs were mixed with two volumes of immunoprecipitation buffer (3% Triton X-100, 1.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.3% SDS, 450 mm NaCl, 3 mmEDTA, 3.75 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF),1 and 30 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) and incubated for 30 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 ×g, and the supernatant was incubated for 30 min with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose and centrifuged for 5 min at 800 × g. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation using the antiserum against the common C-terminal decapeptide of Gαs and XLαs or the anti-XL antiserum. The samples were incubated with the antibody overnight followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (50 μl of a 50% slurry) and further incubation for 2 h. The Sepharose beads were pelleted and washed twice with buffer A (0.2% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) and buffer B (0.2% Triton X-100, 450 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) and once with buffer C (0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0). Immunoprecipitated material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphoimaging. Tryptic digestion of Gαs and XLαs was performed as described previously (4Audigier Y. Journot L. Pantaloni C. Bockaert J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, in vitro translated35S-labeled proteins were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in TMED (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) in the absence or presence of 100 μm GTPγS and then digested for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence of various concentrations (0–0.5 μg/μl) of trypsin (asl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated; Sigma). Digestion was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer immediately followed by boiling of the samples for 5 min at 95 °C. ADP-ribosylation of in vitro translated XLαs was performed by a modification of the procedure of Audigier (3Audigier Y. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In vitro translated α-subunit (20 μl) was mixed with 30 μl of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 2 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA. After 15 min of incubation on ice, 0.5 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 11 mm CHAPS) either lacking or containing 43 ng β1γ2 was added to the mixture, followed by the immediate addition of 17.5 μl of 0.5m Na3PO4, pH 7.2, 60 mmthymidine, 5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 μCi of32P-NAD+ (800 Ci mmol−1, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of a 0.5 mg/ml solution of cholera toxin A-subunit activated with 25 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C before use. After 60 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction mixture was transferred on ice, and 4 volumes of immunoprecipitation buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS, and 1 mm PMSF) were added. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated overnight with 20 μl of the rabbit antiserum against the C-terminal decapeptide of Gαs and XLαs. Immune complexes were collected using protein A-Sepharose in PBS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Sedimentation analysis using sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed as described previously, with minor changes (5Journot L. Pantaloni C. Bockaert J. Audigier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9009-9015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of Gαs or XLαs translation medium was incubated for 24 h at 0 °C in the absence or presence of 150 ng of purified unlabeled β1γ2 subunits (kindly provided by Dr. Christiane Kleuss, Free University of Berlin) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm GDPβS in a final volume of 100 μl. Samples are loaded on top of linear 5–30% sucrose density gradients prepared from solutions also containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Gradients were centrifuged for 18 h in a Beckman SW60 rotor at 55,000 rpm at 4 °C with the deceleration setting “slow,” and 20 fractions were collected per gradient. PC12 cells were plated on 15-cm dishes and were grown to subconfluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum at 10% CO2 and 37 °C. For transient transfection, cells harvested from a subconfluent 15-cm dish after trypsinization were subjected to electroporation (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser; 960 μF, 300 V) in 0.8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 45 μg of circular plasmid DNA. Transfected cells were plated on a 15-cm dish and used 2 days after transfection, with 10 mm sodium butyrate added during the last 16 h to increase the expression of the transgene (6Gorman C. Howard B. Reeves R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7631-7648Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). S49cyc− cells were grown in flasks to a density of 1 × 105 – 2 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 mg/ml glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. A post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) from PC12 cells was prepared as described (7Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For the determination of adenylyl cyclase activity, total membranes were prepared from the PNS by centrifugation (1 h, 100,000 × g, 4 °C), resuspended in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, at 1–2 mg of protein/ml, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. S49cyc− cells (50 ml, ∼106 cells/ml) were pelleted for 5 min at 800 rpm in a Heraeus Megafuge at 4 °C and washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm PMSF. The cells were resuspended in 10 ml of homogenization buffer (0.25 msucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 10 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.4) and pelleted for 5 min at 1600 rpm in a Heraeus Megafuge. The cells were resuspended in 800 μl of homogenization buffer and homogenized by passage through a 22-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml syringe followed by 10 passes through a cell cracker (EMBL, 12-μm clearance). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 900 × g at 4 °C, and the resulting PNS was centrifuged for 1 h in a Beckman TLA45 rotor at 43,000 rpm at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 10 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT to a final protein concentration of 2 mg/ml, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Adult rats (Wistar strain) were anesthetized with chloroform and killed by cervical dislocation. The pituitaries were removed from the skull and transferred into ice-cold HBS (0.3 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.4). The pituitaries were homogenized in 5 volumes of HBS using a motor-driven glass-Teflon homogenizer at 1000 rpm. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting PNS was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended to a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Reconstitution of the S49cyc− membranes was performed as described previously (8Journot L. Bockaert J. Audigier Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 volume of thein vitro translation mixture was mixed with 1 volume of S49cyc− membranes (2 mg of protein/ml) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, followed by centrifugation for 30 min in a Beckman TLA45 rotor at 43,000 rpm at 4 °C. The resulting membrane pellet was resuspended to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in 10 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT. The reconstituted membranes were kept on ice and immediately used for the adenylyl cyclase assay. The activity of adenylyl cyclase was determined by the method of Salomon (9Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as follows. The activity of the S49cyc− membranes (20 μg of protein) was assayed in a final volume of 100 μl containing 100 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 μm cAMP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mg/ml creatine kinase, 1 mm DTT, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, and GTP, GTPγS, and isoproterenol as indicated in the figure legend. Reactions were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. The adenylyl cyclase activity in PC12 membranes was assayed in the presence of 165 μm ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mg/ml creatine kinase, 0.5 mm DTT, 3 μm GTP, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, and 1 μCi [α-32P]ATP. Reactions were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. AA-GTP labeling was performed essentially as described previously (10Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes (100 μg of protein) were pelleted (10 min, 14,000 × g) and resuspended in 30 μl of incubation buffer (0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 60 mm NaCl, 100 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm benzamidine, and 2–200 μm GDP). Samples then received 10 μl without or with the indicated receptor agonists (see text under “Results” and the legend to Fig. 8), were incubated for 3 min at 30 °C, received 20 μl of [α-32P]AA-GTP (1.4 × 106 cpm/μl), and were further incubated for 1–10 min at 30 °C. Samples were transferred on ice and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 ×g at 4 °C. The membranes were rapidly resuspended in 60 μl of labeling buffer (0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 30 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm glutathione) and immediately irradiated at 265 nm for 10–15 s at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged as above, and the membranes were solubilized in 160 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4) for 10–15 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation as above, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation using an antiserum (5 μl) against the common C-terminal decapeptide of Gαs and XLαs. The samples were incubated with the antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by addition of protein A-Sepharose (60 μl of a 10% slurry) and further incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were pelleted and washed twice with buffer A (1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% SDS, 600 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4) and once with buffer B (300 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4). Immunoprecipitated material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphoimaging. Membranes were washed once with 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, and the membrane proteins (50 μg) were subjected to photoaffinity labeling with [α-32P]AA-GTP as described above in the presence of GTP or ATP as indicated in the figure and with the following modifications. (i) The incubation buffer was 1 mmMgCl2 and 50 mm NaCl, and GDP was omitted; (ii) no receptor agonist was added; (iii) incubation was for 10 min. SDS-PAGE (7.5 or 10% gels) and immunoblotting was performed according to standard procedures. Dried gels were either autoradiographed followed by densitometric scanning or exposed to phosphoimager plates, and the intensity of the bands was determined using a Fuji phosphoimager and MacBAS software. The IMAGE cDNA clone 1499201 was identified by BLAST searching with the rat and human XLαs sequences. It was subsequently obtained from Research Genetics and completely sequenced. The clone encodes the full-length mouse XLαs protein. The sequence was submitted to GenBankTM(accession number AF116268). The originally published sequence of XLαs contains a point mutation in the αs-part (1Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) that leads to a single amino acid exchange (L → P) at position 519 (corrected translational start (2Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 253Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar); amino acid residue 650 of originally published sequence (1Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar)). This point mutation was not found in XLαs mRNAs isolated from rat pituitary or PC12 cells as revealed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis (data not shown), suggesting that it reflects an aberration from the physiological XLαs sequence introduced in the course of construction of the cDNA library from which the original XLαs cDNA was isolated (1Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We therefore constructed an XLαs cDNA, referred to as XLαs-wt, in which this point mutation in the αs-part of XLαs was reversed to the physiological sequence. This cDNA was used in the in vitro transcription/translation experiments performed in this study. In vitrotranslation in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate of a Gαs mRNA, obtained by in vitro transcription of a Gαs cDNA, gave rise to a 46-kDa labeled band (Fig. 1,lane 1). Translation of the in vitro transcribed XLαs-wt mRNA generated a major band of M r94,000 and additional bands of lower apparent molecular weight (Fig. 1,lane 4). Immunoprecipitation of the translation products using an antiserum against the C-terminal decapeptide of Gαs showed that XLαs (Fig. 1, lane 6) contains the same C-terminal epitope as Gαs (Fig. 1, lane 3). Upon immunoprecipitation using an antiserum against the EPAA repeats in the N-terminal region of the XL domain (1Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), referred to as anti-XL antibody, only XLαs mRNA-derived translation products of M r ≤ 94,000 (Fig. 1, lane 5), but no Gαs mRNA-derived translation products (Fig. 1, lane 2), were obtained. This showed that (i) the anti-XL antibody was indeed specific for the XL domain of XLαs, and (ii) the major XLαs mRNA-derived translation products of M r < 94,000 (Fig. 1,lanes 4 and 5) were truncated in the αs domain.In vitro translated Gαs and XLαs, as shown in Fig. 1,lanes 1 and 4, were used in the subsequent experiments. The activation of Gα subunits, i.e. the replacement of GDP by GTP, is associated with a conformational change that is reflected in their differential sensitivity to degradation by trypsin (3Audigier Y. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the presence of GTPγS affected the tryptic digestion of in vitro translated XLαs in the same way as it was described previously for Gαs (3Audigier Y. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In the absence of GTPγS, XLαs, like Gαs, was fully degraded by increasing concentrations of trypsin. In contrast, for both Gαs and XLαs in the presence of GTPγS, 37–35-kDa fragments were protected from tryptic digestion. This strongly suggests that (i) XLαs binds GTPγS and (ii) upon GTPγS binding, the αs domain undergoes the same conformational change as Gαs. In XLαs, the exon 1-encoded portion of Gαs is replaced by the XL domain (1Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The exon 1-encoded portion of Gαs is involved in the interaction of Gαs with the βγ complex (5Journot L. Pantaloni C. Bockaert J. Audigier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9009-9015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the C-terminal region of the XL domain shows a high degree of homology to the exon 1-encoded portion of Gαs and other types of Gα subunits (1Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) (Fig.3, A and B). In particular, the residues that are known to directly contact the βγ dimer (11Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 12Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar) are conserved not only between rat, mouse, and human XLαs (Fig. 3 B) but also between XLαs and the various types of Gα subunits (1Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that XLαs, like Gαs, binds to the βγ complex. To investigate this issue, we used (i) ADP-ribosylation by cholera toxin to detect even weak or transient XLαs-βγ interactions and (ii) sucrose density gradient centrifugation to search for stable heterotrimer formation. The ability of activated cholera toxin to catalyze the ADP-ribosylation of purified (i.e. monomeric), native Gαs (13Graziano M.P. Casey P.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11375-11381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as of in vitro translated Gαs (3Audigier Y. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) is very poor. However, in either case, the addition of βγ subunits before the addition of activated cholera toxin greatly increases the extent of ADP-ribosylation (3Audigier Y. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 13Graziano M.P. Casey P.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11375-11381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation by cholera toxin is an irreversible modification and is therefore a very sensitive method for detecting even weak or transient interactions of in vitro translated Gαs and XLαs with βγ subunits. In the absence of βγ subunits, in vitro translated XLαs was indeed found to be a poor substrate for cholera toxin catalyzed ADP-ribosylation (Fig. 4, lane 4), whereas the addition of exogenous βγ subunits resulted in a >2.2-fold increase in the labeling of both the in vitrotranslated XLαs (Fig. 4, lane 5) as well as the endogenous Gαs present in the reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 4, lanes 2and 5). The labeling of XLαs and Gαs in the absence of added βγ subunits (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 4) is most likely due to the presence of some endogenous βγ in the reticulocyte lysate (14Denker B.M. Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6272-6277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To look for stable heterotrimer formation, we examined the effects of purified βγ subunits on the sedimentation behavior ofin vitro translated XLαs and, for comparison, Gαs, using sucrose density gradients. In the absence of βγ subunits, XLαs (Fig. 5 B, open circles) and Gαs (Fig. 5 A, open circles) sedimented at a rate corresponding to a calculated molecular mass of 78 and 46 kDa, respectively, and hence a monomeric state, as revealed by comparison to the 68-kDa hemoglobin tetramer (Fig. 5, bars). In the presence of βγ subunits, XLαs (Fig. 5 B,filled circles) and confirming previous results (5Journot L. Pantaloni C. Bockaert J. Audigier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266"
https://openalex.org/W2102201203,"Contemporary models for protein translocation in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) identify the termination of protein synthesis as the signal for ribosome release from the ER membrane. We have utilized morphometric and biochemical methods to assess directly the fate of membrane-bound ribosomes following the termination of protein synthesis. In these studies, tissue culture cells were treated with cycloheximide to inhibit elongation, with pactamycin to inhibit initiation, or with puromycin to induce premature chain termination, and ribosome-membrane interactions were subsequently analyzed. It was found that following the termination of protein synthesis, the majority of ribosomal particles remained membrane-associated. Analysis of the subunit structure of the membrane-bound ribosomal particles remaining after termination was conducted by negative stain electron microscopy and sucrose gradient sedimentation. By both methods of analysis, the termination of protein synthesis on membrane-bound ribosomes was accompanied by the release of small ribosomal subunits from the ER membrane; the majority of the large subunits remained membrane-bound. On the basis of these results, we propose that large ribosomal subunit release from the ER membrane is regulated independently of protein translocation.

As is now well established, the association of biosynthetically active ribosomes with the ER membrane occurs through the activity of the signal recognition particle/signal recognition particle receptor targeting machinery (1Walter P. Ibrahimi I. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 2Meyer D.I. Krause E. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1982; 297: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 3Gilmore R. Blobel G. Cell. 1983; 35: 677-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). By this process, ribosome-nascent chain complexes bearing secretory or membrane protein precursors are recognized early in synthesis and are trafficked from the cytosol to the ER membrane (4Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Following the binding of the ribosome-nascent chain complexes to the resident translocon complex of the ER membrane, protein translation proceeds and nascent chains are translocated across or integrated into the ER membrane. Subsequently, the termination of protein synthesis is thought to elicit the release of the ribosomal subunits from the ER membrane to the free, cytoplasmic pool (5Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 852-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 6Mechler B. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasmic pool, the ribosomal subunits are free to participate in the protein synthesis initiation sequence. Should they engage in the synthesis of a secretory or membrane protein precursor, targeting to the ER membrane again occurs, thus describing a cycle of ribosome binding and release.In the pioneering studies on ribosome-membrane interactions in the ER, it was observed that ribosomes bind asymmetrically, with the binding interaction being mediated entirely through the large subunits (7Sabatini D.D. Tashiro Y. Palade G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 19: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 8Florendo N.T. J.

Nature. 1977; 269: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, if isolated ER microsomes were extracted with increasing concentrations of EDTA, the small ribosomal subunit was preferentially released from the membrane, whereas the large ribosomal subunit remained membrane-bound (7Sabatini D.D. Tashiro Y. Palade G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 19: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 8Florendo N.T. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 41: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Confirmation of the nature of ribosome binding to the ER was later obtained by direct ultrastructural analysis of intact cells, where it was observed that the large ribosomal subunit contains the site of membrane attachment (10Unwin P.N. Nature. 1977; 269: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations, it may be predicted that the termination of protein synthesis by membrane-bound ribosomes would be accompanied by the regulated dissociation of large ribosomal subunits from the ER membrane.Do ribosomes cycle between a membrane-bound and free state? This question was first addressed in biosynthetic labeling and exchange studies and yielded differing and somewhat contradictory conclusions (9Baglioni C. Bleiberg I. Zauderer M. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 232: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Mechler B. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 75: 16-24Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the study of Baglioni et al. (9Baglioni C. Bleiberg I. Zauderer M. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 232: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it was proposed that large ribosomal subunits bind to the ER membrane prior to their assembly into polysomes. In contrast, Mechler and Vassalli (11Mechler B. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 75: 16-24Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), using a similar isotope incorporation protocol, concluded that small and large ribosomal subunits enter the membrane-bound polysome fraction from the cytosolic pool at similar rates. Although these studies are in disagreement regarding the entry path for large subunits into membrane-bound polysomes, two points are evident. 1) The biosynthetic labeling and exchange kinetics of membrane-bound large subunits differ from those of membrane-bound small subunits. 2) Membrane-bound and cytosolic ribosome pools constitute a common population. However, because ribosome synthesis and assembly are relatively slow and complex processes, the resolution offered by ribosome biosynthetic labeling studies is not sufficient to analyze directly the temporal coupling between protein synthesis on membrane-bound ribosomes and ribosome exchange between free and bound ribosome pools.The purpose of this study was to investigate experimentally the compartmental fate of membrane-bound ribosomes following the termination of protein synthesis. Do ribosomes dissociate from the ER membrane coincident with the termination of protein synthesis? By using biochemical and morphometric methods in tissue culture cells, we report that in vivo termination yields the preferential release of ribosomal small subunits from the membrane, whereas the large ribosomal subunits remain predominantly in the bound state.DISCUSSIONWe report that the termination of protein synthesis on membrane-bound ribosomes in vivo results in the enhanced release of small ribosomal subunits from the membrane-bound pool; large ribosomal subunits remain in stable association with the ER membrane. Although these data do not support the proposal that the termination of protein synthesis on membrane-bound ribosomes yields the release of large and small ribosomal subunits into the free, cytoplasmic pool, they are consistent with prior data demonstrating that, in vitro, the release of nascent chains from membrane ribosomes results in the enhanced exchange of small but not large ribosomal subunits (21Borgese D. Blobel G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 74: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).From a historical perspective, the question of whether membrane-bound ribosomes participate in a translation-dependent exchange with free ribosomes closely followed the observation that free, cytosolic ribosomal subunits associate and dissociate coincident with the initiation and termination stages of translation (22Kaempfer R. Meselson M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1969; 34: 209-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Falvey A.K. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 53: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Since it had been established that ribosomes were segregated between free and membrane-bound pools, studies were thus performed to determine whether such ribosome pools were kinetically exchangeable (6Mechler B. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Baglioni C. Bleiberg I. Zauderer M. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 232: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Mechler B. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 75: 16-24Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21Borgese D. Blobel G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 74: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Mechler B. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Two experimental approaches were taken. In one approach, radioisotope incorporation studies were performed to determine the rate of entry of ribosomal subunits into the free and membrane-bound pools of intact cells. In the study of Baglioni et al. (9Baglioni C. Bleiberg I. Zauderer M. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 232: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the primary conclusion was that large ribosomal subunits bind to the ER membrane, and polysome assembly occurs as small subunit initiation complexes joined with membrane-bound large subunits to yield translationally active 80 S ribosomes. This conclusion was disputed by Mechler and Vassalli (6Mechler B. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 11Mechler B. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 75: 16-24Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24Mechler B. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in a detailed and rigorous series of investigations. These authors concluded that the kinetics of isotope incorporation into large ribosomal subunits of the free and bound ribosomal pools was such that the formation of 80 S ribosomes must occur in the free ribosome pool. Mechler and Vassalli (11Mechler B. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 75: 16-24Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) did report, however, that the kinetics of membrane dissociation of large and small ribosomal subunits was different, with large ribosomal subunit release lagging that of small subunit release. In contrast to the above referenced studies, which were performed in intact cells, Borgeseet al. (21Borgese D. Blobel G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 74: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) examined ribosomal subunit exchange in vitro and reported that following the release of nascent chains, ribosomal subunit exchange was strictly limited to small subunits; large subunits remained in stable association with the microsomal membranes. Because it could not be unequivocally concluded that thein vitro system faithfully executed the termination reaction as seen in vivo, and it was known that free and membrane-bound ribosomal subunits were structurally and metabolically similar, conclusions regarding the physiological significance of an inexchangeable large ribosomal subunit pool were appropriately conservative (21Borgese D. Blobel G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 74: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Although the isotope incorporation studies provided valuable data demonstrating that free and membrane-bound ribosomes existed in metabolic equilibrium, the experimental approach is hampered by a significant kinetic constraint. That is, the rates of ribosomal subunit biosynthesis and nuclear export are such that isotope incorporation rates must be followed for periods of hours (6Mechler B. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Baglioni C. Bleiberg I. Zauderer M. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 232: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Mechler B. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 75: 16-24Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis, however, occurs in the time frame of seconds to minutes, and thus the relevant exchange kinetics differ by 1–2 orders of magnitude. With this experimental limitation in mind, we re-examined the fate of membrane-bound ribosomes following the termination of protein synthesis through a combined morphometric and biochemical analysis of ribosome-membrane interactions in intact cells. The results of our studies best support the hypothesis that the termination of protein synthesis on membrane-bound ribosomes results in the free exchange of small ribosomal subunits, with the large ribosomal subunits remaining in stable association with the ER membrane. These data thus confirm and extend the conclusions obtained by Borgese et al. (21Borgese D. Blobel G. Sabatini D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 74: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that in the intact cell, large ribosomal subunit release from the ER membrane does not occur coincident with the termination of protein synthesis.What is the fate of membrane-bound large ribosomal subunits after termination? Should such subunits be competent for protein translation, it is likely that protein synthesis could be initiated on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Assuming this to be true, it then becomes necessary to determine whether membrane-bound ribosomes can select mRNA substrates and thus whether membrane-bound ribosomes can catalyze the synthesis of free, cytosolic proteins. Furthermore, as membrane-bound ribosomes are thought to reside in intimate association with the protein conducting channel component of the ER translocon, it is equally important that the compartmental fate of such translation products be determined. As it is known that membrane-bound large ribosomal subunits exchange with the cytoplasmic pool, it is essential that the mechanism of large subunit release be determined and the factors governing this release process be identified. Insights into these questions are presented in the accompanying manuscript (31Potter M.D. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33828-33835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 membrane, the site of nascent secretory and integral membrane protein translocation, contains an abundance of membrane-bound ribosomes. As is now well established, the association of biosynthetically active ribosomes with the ER membrane occurs through the activity of the signal recognition particle/signal recognition particle receptor targeting machinery (1Walter P. Ibrahimi I. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 2Meyer D.I. Krause E. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1982; 297: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 3Gilmore R. Blobel G. Cell. 1983; 35: 677-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). By this process, ribosome-nascent chain complexes bearing secretory or membrane protein precursors are recognized early in synthesis and are trafficked from the cytosol to the ER membrane (4Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Following the binding of the ribosome-nascent chain complexes to the resident translocon complex of the ER membrane, protein translation proceeds and nascent chains are translocated across or integrated into the ER membrane. Subsequently, the termination of protein synthesis is thought to elicit the release of the ribosomal subunits from the ER membrane to the free, cytoplasmic pool (5Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 852-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 6Mechler B. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasmic pool, the ribosomal subunits are free to participate in the protein synthesis initiation sequence. Should they engage in the synthesis of a secretory or membrane protein precursor, targeting to the ER membrane again occurs, thus describing a cycle of ribosome binding and release. In the pioneering studies on ribosome-membrane interactions in the ER, it was observed that ribosomes bind asymmetrically, with the binding interaction being mediated entirely through the large subunits (7Sabatini D.D. Tashiro Y. Palade G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 19: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 8Florendo N.T. J.

Nature. 1977; 269: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, if isolated ER microsomes were extracted with increasing concentrations of EDTA, the small ribosomal subunit was preferentially released from the membrane, whereas the large ribosomal subunit remained membrane-bound (7Sabatini D.D. Tashiro Y. Palade G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 19: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 8Florendo N.T. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 41: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Confirmation of the nature of ribosome binding to the ER was later obtained by direct ultrastructural analysis of intact cells, where it was observed that the large ribosomal subunit contains the site of membrane attachment (10Unwin P.N. Nature. 1977; 269: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations, it may be predicted that the termination of protein synthesis by membrane-bound ribosomes would be accompanied by the regulated dissociation of large ribosomal subunits from the ER membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2007609332,"Growth hormone (GH) exerts sexually dimorphic effects on liver gene transcription through its sex-dependent temporal pattern of pituitary hormone secretion. CYP2C12 encodes a female-specific rat liver P450 steroid hydroxylase whose expression is activated by continuous GH stimulation of hepatocytes. Presently, we investigated the role of liver-enriched and GH-regulated transcription factors in the activation of CYP2C12 gene expression in GH-stimulated liver cells. Transcription of a CYP2C12 promoter-luciferase reporter gene in transfected HepG2 cells was activated 15–40-fold by the liver-enriched hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 3α, HNF3β, and HNF6. Synergistic interactions leading to an ∼300-fold activation of the promoter by HNF3β in combination with HNF6 were observed. 5′-Deletion analysis localized the HNF6 response to a single 5′-proximal 96-nucleotide segment. By contrast, the stimulatory effects of HNF3α and HNF3β were attributable to five distinct regions within the 1.6-kilobase CYP2C12 proximal promoter. GH activation of the signal transducer and transcriptional activator STAT5b, which proceeds efficiently in male but not female rat liver, inhibited CYP2C12 promoter activation by HNF3β and HNF6, despite the absence of a classical STAT5-binding site. The female-specific pattern of CYP2C12 expression is thus proposed to reflect the positive synergistic action in female liver of liver-enriched and GH-regulated transcription factors, such as HNF3β and HNF6, coupled with a dominant inhibitory effect of GH-activated STAT5b that is manifest in males. Growth hormone (GH) exerts sexually dimorphic effects on liver gene transcription through its sex-dependent temporal pattern of pituitary hormone secretion. CYP2C12 encodes a female-specific rat liver P450 steroid hydroxylase whose expression is activated by continuous GH stimulation of hepatocytes. Presently, we investigated the role of liver-enriched and GH-regulated transcription factors in the activation of CYP2C12 gene expression in GH-stimulated liver cells. Transcription of a CYP2C12 promoter-luciferase reporter gene in transfected HepG2 cells was activated 15–40-fold by the liver-enriched hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 3α, HNF3β, and HNF6. Synergistic interactions leading to an ∼300-fold activation of the promoter by HNF3β in combination with HNF6 were observed. 5′-Deletion analysis localized the HNF6 response to a single 5′-proximal 96-nucleotide segment. By contrast, the stimulatory effects of HNF3α and HNF3β were attributable to five distinct regions within the 1.6-kilobase CYP2C12 proximal promoter. GH activation of the signal transducer and transcriptional activator STAT5b, which proceeds efficiently in male but not female rat liver, inhibited CYP2C12 promoter activation by HNF3β and HNF6, despite the absence of a classical STAT5-binding site. The female-specific pattern of CYP2C12 expression is thus proposed to reflect the positive synergistic action in female liver of liver-enriched and GH-regulated transcription factors, such as HNF3β and HNF6, coupled with a dominant inhibitory effect of GH-activated STAT5b that is manifest in males. growth hormone Janus kinase 2 signal transducer and activator of transcription cytochrome P450 gene 2C12 GH-activated nuclear factor hepatocyte nuclear factor insulin response element-A binding protein CAAT/enhancer-binding protein nucleotide(s) fetal bovine serum luciferase polymerase chain reaction electrophoretic mobility shift assay oligonucleotide GH1 signals to hepatocytes and other target cells via its plasma membrane-bound receptor, which is a member of the cytokine/growth factor receptor superfamily (1Moutoussamy S. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Binding of GH to the GH receptor induces receptor dimerization and activation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), a tyrosine kinase that interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the GH receptor and phosphorylates both itself and the cytoplasmic domain of the GH receptor on multiple tyrosine residues. These phosphorylated tyrosines, in turn, serve as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules that contain Src homology 2 domains, including STAT transcription factors and insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (1Moutoussamy S. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2Argetsinger L.S. Carter-Su C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1089-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These primary signaling molecules activate secondary messengers, such as diacylglycerol, calcium, and nitric oxide, and enzymes, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase, protein kinase C, phospholipase A2, and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase. These GH-stimulated signaling pathways regulate a variety of intracellular events, including gene transcription, metabolite transport, and enzymatic activity, and contribute to the overall regulation by GH of whole body growth and metabolism (3Davey H.W. Wilkins R.J. Waxman D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 959-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cytochrome P450 gene CYP2C12 encodes a steroid-disulfate 15β-hydroxylase that is induced in the livers of female rats at puberty. At this same developmental stage, a related P450 gene,CYP2C11, which encodes a steroid 16α- and 2α-hydroxylase, is induced in the livers of male rats (4MacGeoch C. Morgan E.T. Halpert J. Gustafsson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15433-15439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15481-15490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The differential expression of these two CYP genes in male and female rats is established by the sexually dimorphic patterns of pituitary GH secretion (6Waxman D.J. Chang T.K.H. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 391-417Crossref Google Scholar, 7Mode A. Tollet P. Strom A. Legraverend C. Liddle C. Gustafsson J.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1992; 32: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In male rats, GH is secreted intermittently to give regular plasma GH peaks of large amplitude (∼200 ng/ml) each 3–4 h, followed by trough periods of no detectable GH (8Tannenbaum G.S. Martin J.B. Endocrinology. 1976; 98: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In contrast, the female rat GH secretory pattern is characterized by more frequent plasma peaks of smaller amplitude, resulting in a near continuous presence of GH in blood at an average level of 40–60 ng/ml (9Jansson J.-O. Ekberg S. Isaksson O. Endocr. Rev. 1985; 6: 128-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The cellular mechanisms by which the temporal plasma profile of GH regulates CYP2C11 and CYP2C12 gene expression in rat liver are only partially understood. We and others have demonstrated that expression of these two genes is regulated by GH at the level of transcription initiation (10Sundseth S.S. Alberta J.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Legraverend C. Mode A. Westin S. Strom A. Eguchi H. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6 (J. A.): 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We have further established that a liver-expressed, latent cytoplasmic transcription factor, designated STAT5b, undergoes repeated tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in direct response to the male pattern of GH secretion, leading us to propose that STAT5b is a transcriptional activator of male-specific, GH pulse-activated genes such asCYP2C11 (12Waxman D.J.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3245-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Indeed, targeted disruption of theStat5b gene in male mice leads to GH pulse resistance (14Davey H.W. Park S.H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35331-35336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) associated with a selective loss of the male-specific pattern of liver gene expression (15Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 16Park S.H. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Davey H.W. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7421-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Further support for this proposal is provided by the correlation between STAT5b nuclear translocation and gender-specific P450 expression in mouse liver (17Sueyoshi T. Yokomori N. Korach K.S. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and by the presence of bona fide STAT5-binding sites in the 5′-flanking region of several male-specific, GH-dependent liver P450 genes (18Subramanian A. Wang J. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2173-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 2S. H. Park and D. J. Waxman, unpublished data. Several liver-expressed nuclear factors have been proposed to contribute to the female-specific expression of CYP2C12. A continuous GH-activated nuclearfactor, termed GHNF, was demonstrated to be specifically induced or activated by the female plasma pattern of GH secretion and to bind to multiple sites along the female-specific CYP2C12promoter (19Waxman D.J. Zhao S. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29978-29987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus far, however, GHNF has resisted purification and has been only partially characterized. A distinct liver-enriched transcription factor, termed HNF6 (20Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Truong O. Lannoy V.J. Hsuan J.J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9460-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Samadani U. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6273-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), whose expression in liver is stimulated by GH, can bind to and enhance transcription from theCYP2C12 promoter ∼3-fold (22Lahuna O. Fernandez L. Karlsson H. Maiter D. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Gustafsson J. Mode A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12309-12313Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, HNF6 expression displays only a modest sex difference in rat liver (female/male = 2:1) and by itself cannot account for the striking female-specific expression of CYP2C12. The insulin response element-A binding protein (IRE-ABP), a member of the SRY family of transcriptional regulators, was hypothesized to be a transcriptional repressor of CYP2C12 (23Buggs C. Nasrin N. Mode A. Tollet P. Zhao H.F. Gustafsson J.A. Alexander-Bridges M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1294-1309PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, IRE-ABP inhibits activation of CYP2C12 by the liver transcription factor C/EBPα, and this effect was correlated with the overlapping binding sites for C/EBPα and IRE-ABP in the CYP2C12 promoter (23Buggs C. Nasrin N. Mode A. Tollet P. Zhao H.F. Gustafsson J.A. Alexander-Bridges M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1294-1309PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, one of these sites overlaps with the GHNF-binding site ofCYP2C12 found at nt −231 to −185 (19Waxman D.J. Zhao S. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29978-29987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, IRE-ABP has not been shown to be expressed in female liver, and there is no evidence for the regulation of this factor by GH. STAT5b, which is proposed to be a transcriptional activator of male-specific, GH pulse-induced genes (12Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), was recently proposed to additionally act as a transcriptional repressor of female dominant mouseCyp genes, based on our finding that a subset of such genes is up-regulated in livers of STAT5b-deficient male mice (16Park S.H. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Davey H.W. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7421-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This latter proposal is consistent with our finding that the induction of CYP2C12 gene expression by the female plasma pattern of GH secretion is associated with a dramatic down-regulation of the STAT5b signaling pathway (12Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 213-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This study was carried out to identify both liver-enriched and GH-regulated nuclear factors that may contribute to regulated expression of CYP2C12. We demonstrate that the liver-enriched transcription factors HNF3α and HNF3β (25Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Smith E. Litvin O. Costa R.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 26Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Tao W.F. Chen W.S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and HNF6 (20Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Truong O. Lannoy V.J. Hsuan J.J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9460-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Samadani U. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6273-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) bind to and strongly activate the CYP2C12promoter. We show that these latter two factors act in concert, via distinct sets of binding sites, to synergistically enhanceCYP2C12 gene activation. Additionally, we demonstrate that, when activated by GH, STAT5b and the closely related STAT5a down-regulate HNF3- and HNF6-induced CYP2C12 gene transcription. Our findings led us to propose a model whereby STAT5 proteins activated in liver in vivo by the male pulsatile GH pattern contribute to the sex specificity of CYP2C12expression by actively suppressing HNF3- and HNF6-dependentCYP2C12 transcription in adult male rats. The human hepatoma cell line HepG2, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection repository, was maintained in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 units/ml streptomycin. An SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney cell line, COS-1, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Mammalian expression plasmids for rat HNF3α and rat HNF3β, cloned into pNEO-SV40, were provided by Dr. Eseng Lai (Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York) (25Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Smith E. Litvin O.

Rat GH receptor cDNA, cloned into expression plasmid pcDNAI, was provided by Dr. Nils Billestrup (Hagedorn Research Institute, Gentofte, Denmark). Mouse STAT1, STAT3, STAT5a, and STAT5b cDNAs, cloned into expression plasmid pME18S, were obtained from Dr. Alice Mui (DNAX Research Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). cDNAs encoding tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutated forms of mouse STAT5a and STAT5b (designated STAT5a-Y694F and STAT5b-Y699F, respectively) and cDNAs encoding serine-to-alanine mutated STAT5 forms (designated STAT5a-S725A and STAT5b-S730A, respectively), all cloned into pcDNAI, were provided by Dr. Hallgeir Rui (Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD) (28Yamashita H.

The STAT5-activated luciferase reporter plasmid 4X-pT109-LUC was provided by Dr. Mary Vore (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY) (30Ganguly T.C. O'Brien M.L. Karpen S.J. Hyde J.F. Suchy F.J.

A2C12 promoter-firefly luciferase reporter plasmid containing 1632 base pairs of 5′-upstream sequence, designated2C12(−1632/+10)-LUC, was constructed as follows. A 1642-base pair DNA fragment corresponding to nt −1632 to +10 of the rat CYP2C12 gene (nucleotide numbering relative to the2C12 transcription start site) (RATP4515B1; GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank) was synthesized by PCR using the cloned 2C12 promoter as template (plasmid p42) (10Sundseth S.S. Alberta J.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to nt −1632 to −1614 (ON-477, upstream primer containing a 5′-end MluI restriction site) and nt +10 to −9 (ON-366, downstream primer containing a 5′-end BglII restriction site). PCRs were carried out at 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 30 cycles in a Stratagene RoboCycler. The resultant DNA fragment was double-digested by BglII and MluI and then ligated to BglII/MluI-digested pGL3-basic (Promega), which encodes a modified firefly luciferase reporter. The sequence was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. 5′-Deletions of the 2C12(−1632/+10)-LUC plasmid were prepared by PCR amplification of various lengths of the 2C12promoter using upstream oligonucleotides (each containing a 5′-endMluI site) corresponding to the following sequences upstream of the transcription start site: 5′-primer start positions beginning at nt −1398, −1319, −1182, −970, −904, −856, −745, −611, −516, −240, and −96 (see Fig. 2). Primer ON-366 was used as the fixed downstream primer. PCRs using plasmid p42 as template (10Sundseth S.S. Alberta J.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were carried out for 30 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 1 min, 40 to 56 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The resultant PCR products were then cloned into pGL3-basic as described above, and the sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For HepG2 transient transfections, cells were plated in minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS in triplicate in 24-well tissue culture plates (35% confluency; ∼90,000 cells/177 mm2/well) and transfected 24 h later using FuGENETM6 transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For COS-1 transient transfections, similar conditions were used, except that the cells were plated at ∼50% confluency and transfected 5 h later. All transfections were carried out using 185 ng of 2C12promoter-LUC reporter plasmid together with 200 ng of liver-enriched transcription factor expression plasmid or 200 ng of a control expression plasmid (pCI), unless indicated otherwise. When present, 95 ng of GH receptor expression plasmid, 200 ng of STAT expression plasmid, and 90 ng of the STAT-activated reporter plasmid 4X-pT109-LUC (30Ganguly T.C. O'Brien M.L. Karpen S.J. Hyde J.F. Suchy F.J. Vore M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2906-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) were included. In addition, 50 ng of the Renillaluciferase reporter plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) was included in each sample as an internal standard for transfection efficiency. Firefly andRenilla luciferase activities were determined 20–24 h after the initiation of transfection using the Dual-LuciferaseTMreporter assay system (Promega) and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Firefly luciferase values were normalized on the basis of the Renillaluciferase values. In experiments in which HepG2 cells were treated with GH or prolactin (500 ng/ml, unless specified otherwise), cells were plated in minimal essential medium + 10% FBS. The cells were washed 6 h later to remove the FBS and then incubated overnight (∼18 h) in minimal essential medium without serum. Cells were then transfected as described above and were simultaneously treated with either GH or prolactin for a total of 24 h. Normalized luciferase activities were determined as described above. Rat GH and rat prolactin were hormonally pure preparations (SIAFP grade) obtained from Dr. A. Parlow and the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health. Total cell extracts were prepared as follows. HepG2 cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped in lysis buffer containing 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mmNa2P2O7, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Crude extracts were aspirated 10 times through a 27-gauge needle, adjusted to 150 mm NaCl, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored in liquid N2until analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Dc detergent protein assay kit. Rat liver nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (12Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K.

The sense strand oligonucleotide of each probe was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega), annealed to the antisense strand, and then purified. Total HepG2 or COS-1 cell extract (10 μg of protein in 5 μl) or rat liver nuclear extract (3 μg of protein in 5 μl) (12Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol.

Double-stranded,32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (10 fmol, 1 μl) was then added, and incubation was continued for 20 min at room temperature, followed by a 10-min incubation on ice. After addition of 2 μl of loading dye (30% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol), samples were electrophoresed at room temperature through a pre-electrophoresed nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (5.5% acrylamide and 0.07% bisacrylamide; National Diagnostics, Inc., Atlanta, GA) in 0.5× buffer containing 44.5 mm Trizma (Tris base), 44.5 mm boric acid, and 5 mm EDTA. Unlabeled probe competitions were carried out by including up to a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA probe in gel mobility shift buffer.Figure 2Deletion analysis of 2C12promoter: functional characterization of HNF3- and HNF6-binding sites.

Because genes coding for several liver-enriched transcription factors are reported to be inducible by GH (e.g. Refs. 33Clarkson R.W. Chen C.M. Harrison S. Wells C. Muscat G.E. Waters M.J. Mol.

The 5′-flanking sequence of CYP2C12 (nt −1632 to +10 relative to the transcription start site) was found to have significant basal expression activity when fused to a firefly luciferase reporter gene. This basal activity was increased significantly when the cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding the liver factor HNF3β (39.1 ± 2.0-fold stimulation) or HNF6 (14.6 ± 2.6-fold stimulation) (Fig.1).

Based on the generality of this mechanism for reducing obesity, a genetic analysis was initiated to identify genes that control brown adipocyte induction in white fat depots in mice. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed using the variations of retroperitoneal fatUcp1 mRNA expression in progeny of genetic crosses between the A/J and C57BL/6J parental strains and selected AXB recombinant inbred strains. Three A/J-derived loci on chromosomes 2, 3, and 8 and one C57BL/6J locus on chromosome 19 were linked toUcp1 induction in retroperitoneal fat. Although A/J-derived alleles seemed to contribute to elevated Ucp1 expression, the C57BL/6J allele on chromosome 19 increased Ucp1mRNA to levels higher than parental values. Thus, novel patterns of C57BL/6J and A/J recombinant genotypes among the four mapped loci resulted in a transgressive variation of Ucp1 phenotypes. Although the extent of the interchromosomal interactions have not been fully explored, strong synergistic interactions occur between a C57BL/6J allele on chromosome 19 and an A/J allele on chromosome 8.

Connolly E. Cannon B. Trayhurn P. Nicholls D.G. Brown Adipose Tissue. Arnold, London1986: 153-213Google Scholar)). The function of the tissue at birth is to generate heat to protect the animal from the cold. As the animal matures, alternative strategies for protection against cold become available and the discrete character of the tissue is gradually lost, except in small rodents where brown fat remains well defined. In large mammals the small number of brown adipocytes that can be found in normal individuals are generally dispersed throughout the white fat masses (2Lean M.E.J. James W.P.T. Trayhurn P. Nicholls D.G. Brown Adipose Tissue. Arnold, London1986: 339-365Google Scholar). As a consequence, the age-dependent loss of brown adipocyte character has made it questionable whether brown adipocyte thermogenesis can contribute significantly to energy balance and body weight regulation as proposed originally by Rothwell and Stock (3Rothwell N.J. Stock M.J. Nature. 1979; 281: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). For several years it has been repeatedly demonstrated by different groups that adrenergic stimulation of rodents and dogs either by cold exposure or β-adrenergic agonists induces brown adipocytes in white fat depots as evidenced by characteristic histology of the brown adipocyte and/or the analysis of mitochondrial uncoupling protein gene expression (4Young P. Arch J.R.S. Ashwell M. FEBS Lett. 1984; 167: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 5Loncar D. Afzelius B.A. Cannon B. J. Ultrastruct. Mol. Struct.

Physiol. 1994; 266(4 Pt 2): R1371-R1382Google Scholar). However, the high variability and low level of induction and dispersion of the brown adipocytes among white adipocytes precluded an experimental analysis that would lead to an understanding of mechanisms controlling this induction. Recently, an experimental strategy has become possible, which can overcome this problem, that is based on the finding that induction of brown adipocytes in white fat depots is genetically variable among inbred strains of mice (9Collins S. Daniel K.W. Petro A.E. Surwit R.S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 10Guerra C. Koza R.A. Yamashita H. Walsh K. Kozak L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The C57BL/6J strain has a very low capacity for induction, whereas, in A/J mice, brown adipocytes may constitute over 50% of the adipocytes in traditional fat depots. Accordingly, a quantitative trait locus analysis can lead to the identification of genes that determine brown adipocyte induction in adult animals. The first genetic analysis on induction of the brown adipocyte phenotype in white fat depots of A/J and C57BL/6J inbred strains was based on expression in the AXB; BXA recombinant inbred (RI)1 strains (10Guerra C. Koza R.A. Yamashita H. Walsh K. Kozak L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). This analysis established: 1) that variation in Ucp1 mRNA levels correlated positively with the number of brown adipocytes present in fat tissue as quantified by image analysis of tissue sections stained with anti-UCP1 antibody, therefore indicating thatUcp1 expression was an appropriate subphenotype for analyzing brown fat induction; 2) that the level of induction and the degree of difference in expression among strains of mice varied among regional fat depots; 3) that selected AXB and BXA RI strains had levels of brown fat induction and Ucp1 mRNA that greatly exceeded the phenotype of the parental A/J strain, a phenotype known as transgressive variation; and 4) that enhanced mRNA levels reduced adiposity in strains susceptible to dietary obesity following treatment with β3-adrenergic receptor agonists (10Guerra C. Koza R.A. Yamashita H. Walsh K. Kozak L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In this paper we have used backcross and intercross analyses of the parental strains together with selected RI lines to begin to identify the chromosomal regions that encode the genes affecting the phenotypic variation of the induction of retroperitoneal (RP) brown fat in mice. For this purpose the determination of Ucp1 mRNA levels is a comparatively simple molecular phenotype that can be accurately quantified, as opposed to complex morphological or physiological phenotypes like counting the number of brown adipocytes. We also describe efforts to identify interactions occurring between specific QTLs in progeny from segregating crosses that can generate transgressive variation. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that transgressive variation arises, in part, in mice with recombinant genotypes due to synergistic interactions between A/J and C57BL/6J alleles that are located on chromosomes 8 and 19. Male mice, 2 and 3 months old, were used in this study. A/J, C57BL/6J, (C57BL/6J × A/J)F1 hybrid mice and the AXB and BXA recombinant inbred strains (RI) were purchased from the production colonies of The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The (C57BL/6J × A/J)F1 × A/J backcross and the intercross between the AXB10 and AXB8 strains were set up in the research facilities at both the Jackson Laboratory and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Two or three mice per pen were placed in the cold (5 °C) for 1 week with a 12-h light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum a diet of 6.5% fat, 53% carbohydrate, and 18.6% protein. Mice were then sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the fat pads were removed for RNA analysis, whereas the liver, spleen, and a segment of tail were for DNA isolation. The RP fat was immediately homogenized in guanidinium thiocyanate, and RNA was isolated (11Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). Ucp1 expression in RP fat was quantified in (C57BL/6J × A/J)F1 × A/J backcross progeny by Northern blot analysis and in the AXB10 × AXB8 intercross progeny using real time quantitative RT-PCR as described below. Other tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for subsequent analysis. The Chomczynski and Sacchi method was subsequently replaced by the use of TRI reagent, and RNA was isolated using protocols supplied by Molecular Research Center, Inc. (Cincinnati, OH). Northern blots were prepared as described by Derman et al. (12Derman E. Krauter K. Walling L. Weinberger C. Ray M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1981; 23: 731-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and RNA expression was quantified according to procedures described by Guerra et al. (10Guerra C. Koza R.A. Yamashita H. Walsh K. Kozak L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA from each RP fat sample along with 2.7 or 1.35 μg of total brown fat RNA to serve as a standard was loaded onto each gel. Hybridization probes using [32P]dCTP were prepared using previously described methods (13Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). 18 S RNA was used as an internal standard to evaluate RNA loading and transfer. Hybridization signals were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics scanning densitometer. RNA was diluted to 10 ng/ml in formamide then further diluted 1:100 with RNase-free H2O. 10 μl (1 ng) of diluted RNA was used per 50 μl of multiplexed RT-PCR reaction to quantitatively determine bothUcp1 mRNA and 18S ribosomal RNA levels using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system. The primer sequences used forUcp1 detection were as follows. Forward: 5′-CACCTTCCCGCTGGACACT-3′ and reverse: 5′-CCCTAGGACACCTTTATACCTAATGG-3′; for 18S ribosome, forward: 5-AGTCCCTGCCCTTTGTACACA-3′ and reverse: 5′-GATCCGAGGGCCTCACTAAAC-3′. The probe sequences for Ucp1 and 18S ribosome were 5′-6FAM-AGCCTGGCCTTCACCTTGGATCTGA-TAMRA-3′ and 5′-VIC-CGCCCGTCGCTACTACCGATTGG-TAMRA-3′, respectively. A standard was generated using brown fat RNA from A/J mice mixed with brown fat RNA from Ucp1 knockout mice to provide a constant quantity of RNA in each sample. This standard was also designed to yield consistent results in relation to the quantitative data generated from Northern blots. The standard was serially diluted to generate a single standard curve for quantification of both Ucp1mRNA and 18S ribosomal RNA. The samples were run in duplicates for both standards and unknowns. No signal was detected with brown fat RNA from Ucp1 knockout mice. Analysis of RNA samples from 18 backcross progeny with a wide range of expression by both Northern blot and the ABI 7700 RT-PCR method yielded very similar results with a correlation coefficient of 0.98 and an average of 30% discrepancy between the blot and RT-PCR methods. Most of the 30% discrepancy between the results using both methods was due to the enhanced linear range at the lower end of measurement ofUcp1 mRNA expression using the ABI 7700. DNA isolated from tails, liver, or spleen of mice was genotyped using microsatellite markers purchased from Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AB). PCR products were separated using horizontal polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (10Guerra C. Koza R.A. Yamashita H. Walsh K. Kozak L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) or by 4% NuSieve-agarose gel electrophoresis. A genome-wide scan was performed on the DNAs of mice with the 40 lowest and 37 highest levels of RP Ucp1 mRNA from the first 580 of 789 backcross progeny. Markers were spaced at 15- to 20-centimorgan intervals throughout the 20 mouse chromosomes. Chromosomal regions, identified by markers that show significant associations with Ucp1mRNA levels, were analyzed across the region in detail by typing all 789 progeny with available polymorphic markers. Data generated from these experiments were analyzed using both Microsoft Excel and Statview 4.5 (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley CA). Linkage analysis and permutation analysis (14Doerge R.W. Churchill G.A. Genetics. 1996; 142: 285-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were performed using MapManager QTb8 (15Manly K.F. Olson J.M. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). We previously reported that the induction of retroperitoneal (RP) fat Ucp1 mRNA in A/J mice (668 ± 140 S.E.) by cold exposure resulted in a 30- to 40-fold increase in expression as compared with C57BL/6J (B6; 16 ± 4 S.E.) mice (10Guerra C. Koza R.A. Yamashita H. Walsh K. Kozak L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). We also provided preliminary evidence on expression in RI strains that suggested the trait was genetic. We have continued with the analysis of the genetic basis of Ucp1 expression in 789 two (n = 380)- and three (n = 409)-month old male (B6 × A/J)F1 × A/J backcross progeny exposed to the cold for 1 week. A representative autoradiogram of a Northern blot shows the wide variation in signal intensities of RP Ucp1 mRNA in the backcross progeny (Fig. 1). RPUcp1 induction varied up to 3000-fold, being almost undetectable in some animals and in others with levels as high as 3000 units; an amount corresponding to 40% of Ucp1 mRNA in cold-induced interscapular brown fat. The overall mean of RPUcp1 in 2-month old mice (402 ± 22 S.E.) was not significantly different from 3-month old mice (364 ± 24 S.E.). The frequency distribution of the phenotypes in the backcross was without defined modes and similar to the continual range of values observed for the AXB and BXA RI strains (see Table II) (10Guerra C. Koza R.A. Yamashita H. Walsh K. Kozak L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). To determine the location of genes that contribute significantly to RPUcp1 expression in backcross progeny, a genome-wide scan was carried out with 80 microsatellite markers at approximately 20-centimorgan spacing. The genotyping was carried out on 77 individual mice (37 with the highest expression and 40 with the lowest expression) selected from an initial group of 580 backcross progeny. Significant associations (LOD > 3.3) were detected between cold-induced RPUcp1 mRNA levels and loci on chromosomes 2, 3, 8, and 19. Subsequently, analysis of the entire coterie of 789 backcross progeny revealed the 4 QTLs to be most closely linked toD2Mit66 (47 centimorgans), D3Mit10 (49.7 centimorgans), D8Mit128 (31 centimorgans), andD19Mit86 (20 centimorgans). LOD scores for theIba (Induction of brownadipocytes) loci were 8.59, 4.98, 12.54, and 3.63, respectively. The peak markers for all of the Iba QTLs permute to within the highly significant range using methods described by Doerge and Churchill (14Doerge R.W. Churchill G.A. Genetics. 1996; 142: 285-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2represents interval maps with microsatellite markers throughout the chromosomal region of each locus. The enhanced region within each chromosome indicates the 1-LOD confidence interval (16Lander E.S. Botstein D. Genetics. 1989; 121: 185-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Centimorgan distances were determined by the number of recombinants between given markers. The chromosome 19 QTL is particularly interesting, because, in contrast to the other 3 QTLs where the A/J allele is associated with high Ucp1 mRNA levels, the B6 allele is associated with “hyper-elevated” RP Ucp1 mRNA. This pattern of allelic expression may account for the transgressive variation for the RP Ucp1 mRNA phenotype in selected RI strains compared with the A/J parental strain (10Guerra C. Koza R.A. Yamashita H. Walsh K. Kozak L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), as well as in the backcross progeny. Fig. 3 represents a linkage analysis using only the mice that are recombinant within each chromosomal region. This figure displays more precisely the peak location of each QTL.Table IIStrain distribution pattern in RI lines in relationship to Ucp1 mRNA levelsTable IIStrain distribution pattern in RI lines in relationship to Ucp1 mRNA levelsGenotyping data in this table were assembled from the RI strain SDPs in the Mouse Genome Database (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) on the Web and by genotyping of the RI strain DNAs.

Microsatellite markers and relative centimorgan (cM) positions (MGD) for chromosomes 8 and 19 are noted on the top of the table. Boxed in genotypes indicate RI strains with a recombinations between the markers of each chromosome. To assess the contribution of all possible allelic combinations at each locus to the phenotype, we computed the level of Ucp1mRNA in animals with the indicated genotypes at the peak markers for each QTL. Table I represents all combinations of genotypes in the backcross mice and the corresponding RP Ucp1 mRNA levels. Very little overlap occurred between any subset of mice with different numbers of alleles contributing to increased expression (“positive alleles”) as shown by the analysis of significance (p < 0.05). Backcross mice with all homozygous A/J (A) or heterozygous (F) alleles at each of the four loci have values similar to A/J (668 ± 140 S.E.) and (B6 × A/J)F1 mice (129 ± 31 S.E.) respectively. This suggests that the four loci account for the majority of the genetic variance. The relationship between the distribution of positive alleles and mRNA levels among the backcross progeny indicates that synergy occurs among the four loci (Fig. 4). Thesolid line plots the experimental data, whereas thedashed line represents calculated values assuming that only additive interactions occur. Inspection of the data in Table I also reveals that the contribution of a specific QTL to mRNA levels is not constant, but depends on the pattern of alleles at the other three loci. As an illustration of this point, the range of effects for variation at chromosome 19 with the other loci having the same genotype can also be derived from the data in Table I. The presence of a single B6 allele at chromosome 19 contributes from 18 to 256 units and is highly dependent on interactions with other loci. In the B6 parental strain of origin, with a level of expression of 16 units, the B6 allele has virtually no effect and suggests that chromosome 19 cannot function independently to increase RP Ucp1 expression. Similar analyses of the other three QTLs show comparable variation in expression that arises from allelic variability. This type of interaction between QTLs, referred to as epistasis or synergistic interactions, has been observed in the analysis of other complex genetic traits (17Frankel W.N. Valenzuela A. Lutz C.M.

The letter “N” denotes nonsignificance (p > 0.05), whereas boxesmarked 1, 2, 3, and 4indicate significance values of p < 0.05,p < 0.01, p < 0.001, andp < 0.0001, respectively. The phenotypic effects of an A/J versus B6 allele at each of the QTLs appear to depend very much on the alleles present at other chromosomes. Although this feature of the genetic conditions for expression is very interesting, the synergy between chromosome 19 and the other QTLs is particularly important, because the association of the B6 allele at chromosome 19 could explain the transgressive expression observed with the RPUcp1 mRNA phenotype. To further evaluate the interactions of chromosome 19 with other chromosomes, we used the AXB and BXA RI strains. We determined the strain distribution patterns of microsatellite markers within the region of each QTL from data available in the Mouse Genome Database, together with our additional genotyping data of the RI strains (TableII). We also determined Ucp1mRNA levels for each of the strains and rank-ordered the data (Table II). An association of an A/J allele on chromosome 8 and a B6 allele on chromosome 19 with increased Ucp1 expression in the backcross data is also evident in the RI lines. A B6 allele at D19Mit86 and an A/J allele for a gene on chromosome 8 located nearUcp1 (37.7 centimorgans) and D8Mit45 (40.5 centimorgans) occurs for the 10 strains with the highest levels of expression. This allelic pattern is not interrupted until BXA11, which has 387 units of expression. From the lower end of the rank-ordered RI strains, this combination of an A/J allele on chromosome 8 and a B6 allele on chromosome 19 does not occur again until the expression is 186 units of Ucp1 mRNA in the BXA8 strain. There are no exceptions to the combination for the 10 RI strains with the highest expression or the 10 strains with the lowest level of expression. However, the wide range in Ucp1 expression evident among the 10 strains with highest expression underscores the point that quantitative expression is also associated with the action of genes on other chromosomes. Accordingly, the chromosome 8-A/J and chromosome 19-B6 combination is necessary, but not sufficient, for transgressive variation. It implies that the allelic patterns for the QTLs located on other chromosomes are also very important for expression. To further assess the allelic interactions between chromosomes 19 and 8, we analyzed the progeny from an intercross between the AXB10 and AXB8 RI strains. These strains have the lowest (13 units) and highest (1719 units) expression of Ucp1, respectively, and are variant for microsatellite markers within the QTLs on chromosomes 2, 8, and 19 and for theUcp1 structural gene located at 37.7 centimorgans. Both strains have a B6 allele on chromosome 3. The interpretation of the effects of other genes on the chromosome 8 and 19 interactions is therefore a little less complex. There were three reasons for making this cross: one was to provide some insight into dominant, recessive, or codominant effects of this interaction; a second was to clarify the location of the gene on chromosome 8 that interacts with chromosome 19; and a third was to confirm the QTL with an independent cross albeit with the same alleles. Regarding the problem of chromosomal location, the backcross data showed the most significant linkage for the control of Ucp1 expression with D8Mit128 and less linkage to Ucp1 or D8Mit45 (Figs. 2 and 3). On the other hand, the strain distribution patterns in RI lines suggest that the association of Ucp1 mRNA levels with chromosome 8 is stronger in a region more distal to D8Mit128, nearer to theUcp1 structural gene and D8Mit45 (Table II). The interaction plots of the intercross progeny show that the allele-specific interactions clearly exist between the B6 allele atD19Mit86 and an A/J allele on chromosome 8 that is stronger for D8Mit45 than D8Mit128 (Fig.5). In addition, the effects are codominant for the alleles on chromosome 19, but recessive for the A/J allele on chromosome 8 in determining Ucp1 mRNA levels (Fig. 5). The presence of homozygosity for the B6 allele atD19Mit86 and homozygosity for the A/J allele at theUcp1-D8Mit45 region nearly triples the level ofUcp1 mRNA compared with heterozygosity or homozygosity for the B6 allele at Ucp1-D8Mit45. To assess whether these effects shown in the interaction plots are in some way dependent on contributions from chromosome 2, the genotypes forD2Mit66 were determined. It was found that the same 1:2:1 distribution of chromosome 2 alleles were associated with each subset of mice sorted in Fig. 5. This indicates that the effects of allelic interactions between chromosomes 8 and 19 occur even when variation at chromosome 2 is constant. Accordingly, the synergistic interaction between chromosomes 8 and 19 appears to be a major determinant of the quantitative phenotype. The analysis of the synergistic interactions using the recombinant inbred lines described above indicated that the location of theIba3 QTL was not in total agreement with the interval map generated with the backcross data. Accordingly, the QTL linkage analysis of chromosome 8 was determined for AXB10 and AXB8 intercross progeny that were respectively homozygous AA, heterozygous AB, and homozygous BB at chromosome 19 (Fig. 6). The most significant effects occur when D19Mit86 is homozygous BB and with a recessive model for inheritance. The results show that the QTL is spread over a broad region that includes both D8Mit128and D8Mit45. Surprisingly, the single QTL on chromosome 8 resolved into two QTLs that were centromeric and telomeric of the backcross QTL (Fig. 2). The data suggest that the QTL peak atD8Mit128 is a “phantom QTL” generated when more than one QTL lies on the same chromosome (14Doerge R.W. Churchill G.A. Genetics. 1996; 142: 285-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21McMillan I. Robertson A. Heredity. 1974; 32: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Martinez O. Curnow R.N. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1992; 88: 349-356Google Scholar). A consequence of this change in the position of the QTL is that significant effects onUcp1 mRNA expression are located nearerD8Mit45 and the Ucp1 structural gene thanD8Mit128, an association that is also evident in the strain distribution patterns of the RI lines (see Table II). The AXB10-AXB8 intercross also provided useful linkage information with respect to the location of the QTL on chromosome 19. Inspection of the linkage relationships for markers on chromosome 19 shows thatD19Mit106 and D19Mit86 have two recombinants in BXA4 and AXB10 (Table II). The order of markers and their centimorgan positions were determined from the (B6 × A/J)F1 × A/J backcross as shown in Fig. 2. The location of the QTL from the backcross progeny was slightly more significant forD19Mit106 than D19Mit86. However, because the AXB10-AXB8 intercross is not variant for D19Mit106 and phenotypic effects are still present in the intercross progeny, the QTL on chromosome 19 must lie distal to D19Mit106. QTL analysis of (B6 × A/J)F1 × A/J backcross indicated that four highly significant (Iba) loci on chromosomes 2, 3, 8, and 19 control differences in Ucp1 induction. We have evaluated whether genes, known to be involved in the regulation ofUcp1 expression and the differentiation of the brown adipocyte, map to these locations and are, accordingly, candidate genes. The number of physiological systems and, therefore, genes that could be involved in brown adipocyte differentiation could be very large, because the hypothalamus and the sympathetic nervous system are also involved. However, the fact that the same induction phenotype occurs whether the adipocytes are stimulated by cold exposure and, therefore, mediated by the hypothalamus or by intraperitoneal injection of a β3-adrenergic agonist and are hypothalamus-independent, leads us to think that the phenotype is restricted to variant gene expression in the adipocytes of the retroperitoneal fat depot (10Guerra C. Koza R.A. Yamashita H. Walsh K. Kozak L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Therefore, any gene functioning from the stimulation of adrenergic receptors on the surface of the adipocyte, through intracellular signal transduction pathways, to transcription complexes that control gene expression in the nucleus and the mitochondria could be involved. Many of these that have been shown to serve a function in Ucp1 expression have been mapped to the Mouse Genome Database; however, only theUcp1 structural gene itself maps reasonably close to the QTL on chromosome 8. This suggests that major regulatory genes of brown adipocyte differentiation, which also include genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, remain to be discovered. The availability of the AXB and BXA RI lines have been a source of much insight and power in the analysis of this genetic system. Intercross data from the RI lines suggests that the QTL on chromosome 8 is composed of two loci due to the tendency of multiple loci on a chromosome to form a phantom peak on QTL analysis (14Doerge R.W. Churchill G.A. Genetics. 1996; 142: 285-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21McMillan I. Robertson A. Heredity. 1974; 32: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Martinez O. Curnow R.N. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1992; 88: 349-356Google Scholar). However, these loci do not account for all of the genetic determinants involved in the variance associated with Ucp1 induction. Based on the data in Table I and evidence suggesting that the B6-derived allele on chromosome 19 exerts codominant affects on chromosome 8 (Fig. 5), we estimate that the highest level ofUcp1 mRNA in mice with the AAAB genotype at chromosomes 2, 3, 8, and 19, respectively, would be 1021 units. Because the highest level of mRNA present in RI lines is 1730 units for AXB8, which have the AAAB genotype at the 4 Iba loci, these four chromosomal regions account for approximately 60% of maximal levels of expression. Whether the remaining 40% of the genetic variance comes from many minor gene effects or one or two major loci that are recessive for the B6 allele, and therefore not revealed in the backcross to the A/J parent, remains to be determined. Additional intercrosses among the RI lines can identify new major loci, if they exist. Ucp1 mRNA expression in the RI lines suggests that not all QTLs can independently increase Ucp1 expression. The A/J allele at chromosomes 2, 3, and 8 conferred higher levels ofUcp1 expression. In contrast, the B6 allele at theIba4 locus on chromosome 19 was associated with elevatedUcp1 expression. Because B6 mice have very low levels of expression, it suggests that the B6 allele at Iba4 cannot by itself increase Ucp1 mRNA levels. This is evident from intercross data in Fig. 5, which shows that increases inUcp1 mRNA depend on an interaction with a gene on chromosome 8 that carries the A/J allele. In addition, AXB1 and BXA1 strains with a B6 allele at Iba4 have among the lowest levels of expression when the allele at Iba3 is derived from B6 (Table II). Thus Iba4 has no main gene effect by itself, but only through its interactions with Iba3. Of courseIba4 could also be interacting with other chromosomes to determine other phenotypes. Although it is possible thatIba4 on chromosome 19 is interacting with theUcp1 structural gene on chromosome 8, it is difficult to reconcile a recessive rather than a codominant phenotype for a gene at which transcription is occurring, as it is in this case,i.e. production of Ucp1 mRNA. It is easier to imagine a post-transcriptional mechanism akin to dominant-negative interactions of protein complexes involved in the initiation of transcription to explain recessivity. The ability to induce brown adipocytes and Ucp1 expression in white fat is not unique to rodent models. Many animals, including humans appear to retain some capacity to induce brown adipose tissue. As newborns, humans have an abundance of brown fat, which is mostly lost by early adulthood (23Lean M.E. James W.P. Jennings G. Trayhurn P. Clin Sci. 1986; 71: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, brown adipocytes have been observed to be interspersed with peri-renal white fat in human adults (24Garruti G. Ricquier D. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1992; 16: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar), and adults with pheochromocytoma have an abundance of brown fat (25Lean M.E. James W.P. Trayhurn P. Int. J. Obes. 1986; 10: 219-227PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ricquier D. Nechad M. Mory G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1982; 54: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the capacity for brown adipocyte formation in human adults is not permanently lost, but may very well lie dormant and can be reactivated with the proper stimuli. It has been shown that human adipocytes in culture can be stimulated to express Ucp1 following exposure to adrenergic agonists or thiazolidinediones (27Champigny O. Ricquier D. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1907-1914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Digby J.E. Montague C.T. Sewter C.P. Sanders L. Wilkison W.O. O'Rahilly S. Prins J.B. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Using the mouse models described in this manuscript to gain further insight about the genetics controllingUcp1 expression in white fat and its relationship to adiposity may ultimately provide new mechanisms for the development of therapeutics to control obesity in humans. The conclusions from this study underscore the genetic complexity controlling metabolic variation among closely related strains of mice.Ucp1, the core of one of the systems for the regulation of obesity in rodents, (29Kopecky J.

Kuhn C.M. Cochrane C. McCubbin J.A. Feinglos M.N. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1163-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). A minimum of four to five genes are involved in Ucp1 expression alone, and additional variant genes will be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and other processes relevant to the induction of brown adipocytes in white fat depots. Hence, the number of variant genes involved in metabolic systems associated with the obese phenotype could be much larger than currently estimated.

Glycolaldehyde was more toxic to the SOD-null strain than to its SOD-replete parent, and this differential effect was oxygen-dependent. The product, glyoxal, could be trapped in the medium by 1,2-diaminobenzene and assayed as quinoxaline. The SOD-null strain produced more glyoxal and eliminated it more slowly than the SOD-replete parent strain. Glyoxal was ∼10 times more toxic than glycolaldehyde and was more toxic to the SOD-null strain than to the parental strain. 1,2-Diaminobenzene protected against the toxicity of glycolaldehyde. TheseEscherichia coli strains contained the glutathione-dependent glyoxalases I and II, as well as the glutathione-independent glyoxalase III. Of these enzymes, glyoxalase III was most abundant, and it was inactivated within the aerobic SOD-null strain and also in extracts when exposed to the flux of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide imposed by the xanthine oxidase reaction. Thus, it appears that short chain sugars are oxidized by superoxide yielding toxic dicarbonyls. Moreover, the defensive glyoxalase III is also inactivated by the oxidative stress imposed by the lack of SOD, thereby exacerbating the deleterious effect of sugar oxidation.

The superoxide is a product of air oxidation (1Robertson Jr., P. Fridovich S.E. Misra H.P. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 207: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 2Thornalley P. Wolff S. Crabbe J. Stern A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 797: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 3Sakurai T. Tsuchiya S. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Because the superoxide can also initiate the oxidation of such enediolates, free radical chain oxidations are possible (4Mashino T. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 presents a scheme for the tautomerism of the open chain forms of aldoses (I) to the corresponding enediols (II) and for the sequential oxidations of the enediols to a monoradical (III) and then to a very unstable diradical (IV), which rearranges to the α,β-dicarbonyl (V). The one-electron oxidation can be caused slowly by dioxygen yielding superoxide or more rapidly by superoxide yielding hydrogen peroxide. We have previously noted that short chain sugars are toxic to Escherichia coli, aerobically but not anaerobically and that a scavenger of dicarbonyls, such as aminoguanidine, protected (5Benov L. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25741-25744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because a SOD1-null strain was more prone to this toxicity than the parental strain, we concluded that superoxide was a factor in the oxidation of the short chain sugars and that α,β-dicarbonyls were the proximate toxic products of that oxidation. We did not then actually measure the α,β-dicarbonyls that were supposed to be the cause of the toxicity, nor did we consider the protective actions of glyoxalases that convert α,β-dicarbonyls to α-hydroxy acids. The data presented below fill those gaps and add to our understanding of sugars as sources of superoxide and as targets for that radical. We find that glyoxal is produced from glycolaldehyde more rapidly by a SOD-null strain than by the parental strain. It is also seen that the parental strain eliminates glyoxal more rapidly than the SOD-null strain. One particular α,β-diketone, i.e. methylglyoxal, can be made from dihydroxyacetone phosphate by a specific synthase that is widespread in bacteria and that has been cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed (6Saadat D. Harrison D.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10074-10086Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Totemeyer S. Booth N.A. Nichols W.W. Dunbar B. Booth I.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The α,β-dicarbonyl compounds, whether made by methylglyoxal synthase or as a result of autoxidation of short chain sugars, are potentially toxic because of their propensity to covalently modify both nucleic acids and proteins (8Papoulis A. Al-Abed Y. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Lo T.W. Westwood M.E. McLellan A.C. Selwood T. Thornalley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32299-32305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that under conditions of oxidative stress, such as stress imposed by a lack of SOD, the autoxidation of short chain sugars to dicarbonyls is more of a problem than is the activity of methylglyoxal synthase. Our results also indicate that the specificity of the defensive glyoxalases is broad enough to encompass glyoxal. Methylglyoxal, glyoxal, glycolaldehyde,dl-glyceraldehyde, 1,2-diaminobenzene, aminoguanidine,S-d-lactoylglutathione, glutathione, ATP, and NADP were obtained from Sigma. d-Erythrose was from Fluka. 2,3-Dimethylquinoxaline was from Aldrich. Xanthine oxidase, catalase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Yeast extract, Bacto-peptone, and casamino acids were from Difco. The E. coli strain used was AB1157, which was the parental strain for JI132 that was the ΔsodA/ΔsodB mutant (10Imlay J.A. Linn S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Starter cultures were grown overnight in aerobic LB medium at 37 °C and were then diluted to 2 × 106cells/ml in M9CA medium. LB and M9CA media are as described previously (11Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 68-69Google Scholar). The anaerobic condition was achieved in a BBL Gas Pak anaerobic system (Becton Dickinson). When needed, extracts were prepared from 6-h cultures by centrifugation (washing the cells two times in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8); then the cells, which had been resuspended in this buffer, were disrupted with a French press. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation. Glyoxal and methylglyoxal were assayed in the medium by using 1,2-diaminobenzene as derivatizing reagent by a modification of the protocol of Cordeiro and Ponces Freire (12Cordeiro C. Ponces Freire A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To a 1-ml sample containing glyoxal and/or methylglyoxal, we added 0.2 ml of 5 m HClO4, 0.2 ml of 2,3-dimethylquinoxaline as an internal standard, 0.2 ml of 10 mm 1,2-diaminobenzene, and water to a 2-ml final volume. After 1 h at 25 °C, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed in a LKB-Bromma chromatograph. The column was a 5-μm, 250 × 4-mm RP-18 (Merck LiChrospher). The mobile phase was 40% (v/v) 25 mm ammonium formate buffer, pH 3.4, and 60% (v/v) methanol. A volume of 150 μl was injected. The flow rate was 1.6 ml/min and quinoxalines were detected at 315 nm. Glyoxalase I was assayed by following an increase in A 240 because ofS-d-lactoylglutathione formation (13Mannervik B. Aronsson A.C. Tibbelin G. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). One unit of glyoxalase I is defined as the amount of enzyme required to form 1 μmol of S-d-lactoylglutathione/min. Glyoxalase II was assayed by monitoring the decrease inA 240, accompanying the conversion ofS-d-lactoylglutathione to lactate plus GSH (14Oray B. Norton S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). One unit of glyoxalase II is defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 μmol ofS-d-lactoylglutathione/min. Glyoxalase III was assayed by a modification of the method of Misra et al. (15Misra K. Banerjee A.B. Ray S. Ray M. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) using the HPLC assay for glyoxal and methylglyoxal as described above. One unit of glyoxalase III is defined as the amount of enzyme required to utilize 1 μmol of methylglyoxal or to form 1 μmol ofd-lactate/min. 50 μm xanthine, 2 nm xanthine oxidase, 1 μg of Cu,Zn-SOD, 1 μg of catalase, or 25 mm mannitol were added to the cell extracts to explore the effects of reactive oxygen species. ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose by glucokinase was assayed in cell extracts by monitoring the formation of NADPH and by using excess glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase according to the protocol of Fraenkel and Horecker (16Fraenkel D.G. Horecker B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2765-2771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that a higher ATP concentration (7.5 mm) was used (17Meyer D. Schneider-Fresenius C. Horlacher R. Peist R. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of glucokinase that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of glucose 6-phosphate/min. Glycolaldehyde did not inhibit aerobic growth of the SOD-replete AB1157 strain until its concentration exceeded 4.0 mm (Fig. 2 A, line 1). In contrast, the growth of the SOD-null JI132 strain was suppressed in the lower range of 0–4.0 mm (Fig. 2 A, line 2). This protective effect of endogenous SOD on the sensitivity to glycolaldehyde was not seen under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 2 A, lines 3 and 4). When glyoxal was examined (Fig. 2 B), a similar pattern was seen but at 10-fold lower concentrations. Thus, the anaerobic growth suppression became pronounced above 0.3 mm for both the JI132 and AB1157 strains (Fig. 2 B, lines 3 and 4), and aerobically JI132 was more sensitive than AB1157 (Fig. 2 B, lines 1 and 2). 1,2-Diaminobenzene converts α,β-dicarbonyls to quinoxalines (12Cordeiro C. Ponces Freire A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Deng Y. Yu P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and if glyoxal is the cause of glycolaldehyde toxicity, 1,2-diaminobenzene should protect JI132. Comparison of lines 1 and 2 in Fig. 2 C demonstrates that 2.0 mm glycolaldehyde slowed the aerobic growth of the JI132 strain, whereas lines 3 and 4 in Fig. 2 C show that 1.0 mm 1,2-diaminobenzene significantly lessened the effect of glycolaldehyde. It should be noted that 1,2-diaminobenzene at 1.0 mm did not itself affect the growth of the JI132 strain in the absence of glycolaldehyde, although it was a growth inhibitor at a higher concentration (data not shown). It should also be recalled that 2.0 mm glycolaldehyde or 0.2 mmglyoxal were without effect on the anaerobic growth rates of AB1157 or JI132 (Fig. 2, A and B, lines 3 and4). These data support the conclusions that glyoxal may be a cause of the aerobic toxicity of glycolaldehyde, superoxide plays a role in the conversion of the latter into the former, and somehow superoxide also increases the toxicity of glyoxal. Glycolaldehyde autoxidizes into glyoxal, and the extent of this autoxidation must be known so that corrections for it can be applied to results obtained with E. coli. Line 1 in Fig.3 A presents the accumulation of glyoxal from 2.0 mm glycolaldehyde in M9 medium. The rate was slower in M9CA medium (Fig. 3 A, line 2) presumably because of consumption of glyoxal by reaction with the amino acids in the casein hydrolysate. Aminoguanidine completely eliminated the accumulation of glyoxal (Fig. 3 A, line 3) by coupling with it to form an asymmetrical triazine (19Hirsch J. Petrakova E. Feather M.S. Barnes C.L. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 267: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In accordance with these results, when the persistence of glyoxal was examined (Fig.3 B), glyoxal was seen to be stable in M9 medium (Fig.3 B, line 1) but less stable in M9CA medium (Fig.3 B, line 2). Arginine caused rapid consumption of glyoxal (Fig. 3 B, line 4), whereas the scavenging of glyoxal by aminoguanidine was most pronounced (Fig.3 B, line 3). The effect of 2.0 mm glycolaldehyde on the growth ofE. coli and the concomitant accumulation and consumption of glyoxal were examined. Fig. 4 Ashows that both the SOD-replete AB1157 and the SOD-null JI132 strains grew at the same rates anaerobically (lines 2 and4), whereas aerobically AB1157 grew much faster (line 1) than did JI132 (line 3). The glyoxal content of the medium was also followed as shown in Fig. 4 B. Line 1 shows that aerobic AB1157 accumulated glyoxal to a maximum of 40 μm during the first 4 h of growth and then consumed it during subsequent growth. In contrast, aerobic JI132 continued to accumulate glyoxal to a maximum of 100 μm during the 10 h of observation (line 3). Under anaerobic conditions, there was no accumulation of glyoxal by either strain (lines 2 and 4). Line 5 shows the production of glyoxal by autoxidation in the aerobic M9CA medium without cells, whereas line 6 depicts an anaerobic control for the effect of medium alone. It again appears that JI132 produces glyoxal from glycolaldehyde more rapidly and eliminates it more slowly than AB1157. This is probably why its growth was more strongly inhibited by glycolaldehyde. E. coli is known to contain glyoxalases I, II, and III, although one report states that glyoxalase II was not detected (15Misra K. Banerjee A.B. Ray S. Ray M. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because glyoxalases I and II cooperate in performing the GSH-dependent conversion of α,β-dicarbonyls to α-hydroxy acids, it would be expected that glyoxalase II would be present if glyoxalase I was present. Fig.5 presents the glyoxalase activities in the AB1157 and JI132 strains grown under different conditions. The first point to be made is that glyoxalases I, II, and III are all present, although glyoxalase III > glyoxalase I > glyoxalase II > 0. Hence most of the glyoxalase activity inE. coli is because of the GSH-independent glyoxalase III. A comparison of Fig. 5, A and D, makes it clear that the AB1157 and JI132 strains have comparable glyoxalase activities when grown anaerobically but that JI132 has less glyoxalase III under aerobic conditions. There was no induction of glyoxalase III by growth in the presence of methylglyoxal (Fig. 5 B). Paraquat, which can increase the aerobic production of superoxide, suppressed glyoxalase III in JI132 (Fig. 5 C). Inactivation of the abundant glyoxalase III by superoxide or by reactive species derived therefrom could explain the lower glyoxalase activity in the aerobic JI132 cells than in the AB1157 strain and could also explain the effect of paraquat; it could further clarify why glyoxal was more toxic to JI132 than to AB1157 and why this differential toxicity was oxygen-dependent. Hence, this possibility was explored. The effect of a flux of superoxide, produced by the xanthine oxidase reaction (20Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on the glyoxalase III activity in extracts of E. coli, was examined. Fig. 6 A shows that glyoxalase III activity was diminished in the case of AB1157 by exposure to the xanthine oxidase reaction, whereas Fig. 6 Bshows that the effect on JI132 extracts was greater. Because the SOD endogenous to AB1157 and present in the extract could have accounted for this difference, SOD was added to the extracts and was found to protect completely. Indeed, the added SOD raised the glyoxalase III activity in JI132 extracts to a level greater than that seen in extracts not exposed to the xanthine oxidase reaction. We suppose that this is explained by the inactivation of some glyoxalases III by endogenous superoxide production in the JI132 extracts before the sampling for assay. Superoxide can release Fe(II) from the [4Fe-4S] clusters of dehydratases, and that Fe(II) can reduce hydrogen peroxide to yield the hydroxyl radical (21Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 22Keyer K. Gort A.S. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6782-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 23Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). If hydroxyl radical produced in this way was the cause of the inactivation of glyoxalase III, then catalase should protect by lowering hydrogen peroxide, and mannitol should protect by scavenging the hydroxyl radical. Fig. 6 illustrates the protective effects of catalase and mannitol. It follows that glyoxalase III, the major glyoxalase in E. coli, is sensitive to inactivation by the pro-oxidant conditions created by the lack of SOD and that Fenton chemistry generates the proximate inactivator. Glucokinase was examined in a similar way to see whether the sensitivity of glyoxalase III to oxidation was unusual. Fig.7 shows that glucokinase was not inactivated by the superoxide and hydrogen peroxide produced by the xanthine oxidase reaction. Thus, the sensitivity of glyoxalase III was special and might relate to the thiol group that is essential for its activity and possibly to the binding of iron adjacent to the active site thiol. While assaying for glyoxal in terms of the quinoxaline produced from the reaction with 1,2-diaminobenzene, we also measured methylglyoxal in terms of 2-methylquinoxaline. The primary reason for doing so was to gauge the extent to which methylglyoxal synthase was contributing to dicarbonyl production by its non-oxidative pathway. Fig. 8 indicates that the contribution of the methylglyoxal synthase to the total dicarbonyl production in cells exposed to glycolaldehyde was very small indeed. Thus, M9CA medium conditioned by the growth of JI132 underwent reaction with 1,2-diaminobenzene and then was subjected to HPLC in which quinoxaline, derived from glyoxal, eluted at 3 min, 35 s, and in which 2-methylquinoxaline, derived from methylglyoxal, eluted at 4 min, 20 s. There was no detectable methylglyoxal formed from the glucose present in this medium and in only traces of other dicarbonyls (Fig. 8 A). When 200 μm glyoxal had been added to the culture (Fig. 8 B), it was detected as quinoxaline at zero time eluted at 3 min, 35 s and was progressively consumed at longer times of incubation. Similarly, enriching the medium with 200 μm methylglyoxal gave 2-methylquinoxaline eluting at 4 min, 20 s at zero time and progressively less in samples drawn at longer times of incubation (Fig. 8 C). The consumption of these dicarbonyls by JI132 largely reflects the activity of glyoxalases. When cultures enriched with glycolaldehyde (Fig.8 D) or glyceraldehyde (Fig. 8 E) were examined, the major dicarbonyls detected were glyoxal and methylglyoxal, respectively. However, in the case of glycolaldehyde, the glyoxal was first generated and then consumed during the 24 h of incubation. In contrast, the glyceraldehyde was contaminated with methylglyoxal in the zero time sample. Erythrose (Fig. 8 F) was contaminated by polar dicarbonyls, presumably erythrosone, in which quinoxaline products eluted at 2 min, 35 s. It also contained lesser amounts of glyoxal and methylglyoxal. Short chain sugars, in which carbonyl functions cannot be blocked by the formation of furanose or pyranose rings, are prone to enolization followed by oxidation to toxic dicarbonyls. Thus, they express in an exaggerated way what can also occur with glucose by the slower process of non-enzymatic glycation and oxidations (24Brownlee M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 25Thornalley P.J. Langborg A. Minhas H.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Glycolaldehyde, the simplest sugar, is more toxic to a SOD-null strain of E. coli (JI132) than to its SOD-replete parent (AB1157), and this extra toxicity is oxygen-dependent. The corresponding dicarbonyl, glyoxal, was ∼10 times more toxic than glycolaldehyde, and JI132 was again more sensitive than AB1157 in an oxygen-dependent way. 1,2-Diaminobenzene protected JI132 against the toxicity of glycolaldehyde, presumably by converting glyoxal to the less toxic quinoxaline. We may infer that superoxide is an important cause of the oxidation of glycolaldehyde, and we may explain the greater and oxygen-dependent sensitivity of JI132 to glyoxal on the basis of an oxidative inactivation of glyoxalases. Glycolaldehyde itself becomes toxic at high concentrations, even anaerobically, probably by converting essential amino compounds to carbinolamines and to Schiff base salts. When the SOD-replete AB1157 strain grew aerobically in the presence of glycolaldehyde, glyoxal first accumulated in the medium and was subsequently consumed. The SOD-null JI132, in contrast, accumulated glyoxal during the entire 10 h of incubation. Thus, it appeared that JI132 both converted glycolaldehyde to glyoxal more rapidly and disposed of it more slowly than did AB1157. Glyoxalases I, II, and III were all present in these strains, but the GSH-independent glyoxalase III was the most abundant and suppressed in the JI132 strain grown aerobically; it was further suppressed when JI132 grew in the presence of 1 μm paraquat. Thus, it appears that glyoxalase III was inactivated by the oxidative stress imposed by lack of SOD activity and also by the presence of paraquat. Exposure of bacterial extracts to the superoxide and hydrogen peroxide produced by the xanthine oxidase reaction caused a loss of glyoxalase III activity that was greater in the SOD-null extracts. This inactivation was prevented by SOD, catalase, or mannitol. Glucokinase in the extracts was not inactivated by the xanthine oxidase reaction. Glyoxalase III may be selectively inactivated by a flux of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide because it binds the Fe(II) released from the [4Fe-4S] clusters of dehydratases oxidized by superoxide. This bound Fe(II) would then react with hydrogen peroxide to yield Fe(II)–O, Fe(III)–OH, or hydroxyl radical, and these strong oxidants would preferentially attack the nearest target, which in this case is glyoxalase III. When glucose was the carbon source, no dicarbonyls could be trapped by 1,2-diaminobenzene. This negative result is a measure of the degree of protection provided by blocking sugar carbonyls by hemiacetal ring closure. Moreover, the steady state concentrations of the triosephosphate intermediates of glycolysis must be very low because the equilibrium constant of the aldolase reaction greatly favors fructose 1,6-diphosphate. We conclude that dicarbonyl production from dihydroxyacetone phosphate, by the action of methylglyoxal synthase, must be insignificant and in full accord with the observation that 900-fold overexpression of this synthase did not cause observable detrimental effects (7Totemeyer S. Booth N.A. Nichols W.W. Dunbar B. Booth I.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). MacLean et al. (26MacLean M.J. Ness L.S. Ferguson G.P. Booth I.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) reported that glyoxalase III was the most abundant glyoxalase in E. colibut nevertheless concluded that glyoxalases I plus II were the most important route of methylglyoxal detoxification. This conclusion was based on the heightened sensitivity to methylglyoxal exhibited by a glyoxalase I-null mutant. However, this can be explained by the protective effect of lowering cytoplasmic pH (27Ferguson G.P. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 242-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) because of the activation of potassium efflux by the product of the glyoxalase I reaction, S-lactoylglutathione (26MacLean M.J. Ness L.S. Ferguson G.P. Booth I.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Lowering the pH would slow the reaction of dicarbonyls with target amino or thiol compounds."

Cain is a recently identified protein inhibitor of calcineurin. We now provide evidence that cain is a component of the endocytic protein complex. The proline-rich region of cain forms a stable association with the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1.

The use of other calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporin A and FK506 also blocks endocytosis. Since binding of cain to amphiphysin 1 does not affect amphiphysin's interaction with other endocytic proteins, our results suggest that cain negatively regulates synaptic vesicle endocytosis by inhibiting calcineurin activity, rather than sterically interfering with the assembly of the endocytic protein complex.

The burst of calcium that initiates exocytosis also leads to synaptic vesicle recycling by endocytosis of the released vesicles and is mediated by a unique complex of endocytic proteins, which includes amphiphysin, synaptojanin, dynamin 1, clathrin, and clathrin adapters (3De Camilli P.

We have recently demonstrated that the calcium-sensitive phosphatase calcineurin is physically linked to the endocytic proteins via its interaction with dynamin 1, the GTPase component of the synaptic vesicle coat complex (8Lai M.M.

The calcium-dependent nature of the calcineurin-dynamin 1 interaction acts as a calcium sensor for endocytosis, which is initiated by calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of endocytic proteins.Recently, we and others (9Lai M.M.

Liu J.O. Immunity. 1998; 8: 703-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) identified a novel protein designated cain (calcineurin inhibitor) or cabin (calcineurin-binding protein), which binds to and inhibits calcineurin. Cain/cabin was initially cloned from brain and lymphocyte libraries but has subsequently been found in a broad range of tissues. In T cells, cabin has been shown to regulate T cell receptor (TCR)-induced apoptosis through its interaction with the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) (11Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Jun J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, cain's role in the nervous system has not been clearly elucidated. Given its large size (240 kDa) and modular organization, we had hypothesized that cain may function as a scaffolding protein linking calcineurin to a variety of target proteins. We now show that cain binds to amphiphysin 1 in the endocytic complex and, in providing localized inhibition of calcineurin, serves as a physiologic negative regulator of endocytosis.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCain is a 240-kDa protein that binds calcineurin through a 38-amino acid region near its C-terminal tail (Fig.1 A). It is hypothesized that the rest of cain, which contains several potential protein-protein interacting domains, allows cain to act as a scaffolding protein linking calcineurin to other target proteins in the cell. The mid-portion of cain possesses a proline-rich domain (amino acids 1748–1876) whose properties closely resemble those of other proteins that bind with some selectivity to the SH3 domain of the endocytic protein amphiphysin 1 (15Grabs D. Slepnev V.I. Songyang Z. David C. Lynch M. Cantley L.C. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13419-13425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we wondered whether cain might directly interact with amphiphysin 1 and thereby “deliver” localized inhibition of calcineurin activity within the synaptic endocytic complex. To test this hypothesis, we conducted immunoprecipitation experiments in whole rat brain lysates using anti-cain antibody. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitate with an antibody to amphiphysin 1 reveals a robust interaction between cain and amphiphysin 1, which is not evident with preimmune serum (Fig.1 B).The SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1 has been shown previously to bind the proline-rich region of dynamin 1 (16David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We wondered whether the cain-amphiphysin 1 interaction could co-exist with the dynamin 1-amphiphysin 1 interaction or whether the binding of cain to amphiphysin 1 displaces dynamin 1 from the SH3 domain. To address this issue, we checked the cain immunoprecipitate for other co-immunoprecipitated proteins by Western immunoblotting. We found that amphiphysin 1, dynamin 1, and adaptin all co-immunoprecipitate with cain; whereas an unrelated GTP-binding protein Rap2 does not interact with any member of this complex (Fig. 1 C). Our results demonstrate that both cain and dynamin 1 can simultaneously bind the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1. Furthermore, the stable association between cain and amphiphysin 1 suggests that cain is an integral component of the synaptic endocytic protein complex.To further clarify the domains of cain and amphiphysin that interact, we conducted binding experiments utilizing various truncations of myc-cain and GST-amphiphysin 1 (Fig.2 A). GST-amphiphysin 1 binds to full-length myc-cain and to its proline-rich domain but not to any other portion of cain. To confirm the involvement of the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1, we examined the ability of the isolated SH3 domain of GST-amphiphysin 1 to bind to myc-cain (Fig. 2 B). The SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1 behaves identically as the full-length protein in binding to both the full-length and proline-rich domain of myc-cain, suggesting that it contains all the necessary sequence for binding cain. Thus, interactions between the two proteins are mediated by the proline-rich domain of cain and the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1.Figure 2The proline-rich region of cain binds the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1. A, HEK293 cell lysates expressing the indicated myc-tagged cain constructs were incubated with GST-amphiphysin 1 resin. Bound proteins were visualized by immunoblotting with anti-myc antibody. Only the full-length cain construct (cainFL) and the construct containing the proline-rich region (cainPR) bind GST-amphiphysin 1. The corresponding amino acids of the constructs are as follows: cainFL, aa 1–2182; cainN, aa 1–726; cain2, aa 721–1077; cain3, aa 1070–1230; cain4, aa 1225–1753; cainPR, aa 1748–1876; cainCBD, aa 1880–2173.B, HEK293 cell lysates containing myc-cainFL, myc-cainN, and myc-cainPR constructs were incubated with the GST-amphSH3 resin, which contains the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1. Only the full-length cain protein and the proline-rich region of cain bind GST-amphSH3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In earlier studies, we showed that calcineurin activates synaptic vesicle endocytic process by dephosphorylating endocytic proteins (7Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. De Camilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Since cain is a physiologic inhibitor of calcineurin, we hypothesize that it may deactivate endocytosis. Accordingly, we monitored the uptake of biotinylated transferrin in HEK293 cells, a procedure that has been shown to reflect endocytic events (17van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 18Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). As a positive control, we transfected a dominant negative construct of dynamin 1 (dynamin K44E), in which a lysine critical for the GTPase activity of dynamin has been mutated to glutamic acid. Expression of dynamin K44E has been shown to alter clathrin distribution and block transferrin uptake (19Herskovits J. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In our system, transferrin internalization in HEK293 cells transfected with vector alone increases linearly for 5 min and then plateaus with a modest decline at 25 min. During the linear portion of the time course, transfection with the mutant dynamin K44E construct reduces transferrin uptake by about 34–38%. Since the transfection efficiency is only about 50% (data not shown), this reflects a 70% reduction in endocytosis and is consistent with the known role of dynamin 1 in mediating transferrin endocytosis. These results resemble the findings of Schmid and associates (17van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), who found a 40% reduction of transferrin uptake by the same mutant dynamin construct transiently transfected into HeLa cells at 25–60% efficiency. Mutant dynamin K44E stably transfected into HeLa cells, with presumed 100% efficiency, reduced transferrin uptake about 75% (18Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Overexpression of cain in our system reduces endocytosis to about the same extent as the expression of dominant negative dynamin 1 (Fig.3).Figure 3Cain inhibits transferrin endocytosis.The kinetics of transferrin endocytosis by HEK293 cells transfected with the indicated constructs were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression of cain blocks transferrin endocytosis as potently as the expression of the dominant negative dynamin K44E construct. The results are the mean of four independent experiments. The mean and S.E. values at the 5-min time point are as follows: vector alone, 80 ± 2.9; cain, 60 ± 3.2; dynamin K44E, 61 ± 2.3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)If endocytosis reflects dephosphorylation by calcineurin, then inhibitors of calcineurin other than cain should also reduce endocytosis. The immunosuppressant drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 are known inhibitors of calcineurin (20Snyder S.H. Lai M.M. Burnett P.E. Neuron. 1998; 21: 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 21Liu J. Farmer J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar). Treatment with cyclosporin A or FK506 reduces endocytosis to the same extent as does cain overexpression (Table I). Rapamycin is an immunosuppressant drug that binds with high affinity to FKBP12, but the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex does not affect calcineurin (22Dumont F.J. Melino M.R. Staruch M.J. Koprak S.L.

In our system, rapamycin prevents the ability of FK506 to reduce endocytosis but has no effect on endocytosis by itself. Likewise, GPI1046, another compound that binds FKBP12 but does not inhibit calcineurin (25Steiner J.P. Hamilton G.S. Ross D.T. Valentine H.L. Guo H. Connolly M.A. Liang S. Ramsey C. Li J.H.

In the present study, we extend this model by showing that cain can bind directly to amphiphysin 1 as well as to calcineurin and therefore functions as a physiologic inhibitor of endocytosis (Fig.4). Our co-immunoprecipitation experiments establish that cain binds to calcineurin and to amphiphysin 1 simultaneously, which is consistent with different domains of cain involved in two separate protein-protein interactions. Specifically, the proline-rich domain of cain binds to amphiphysin 1, while its C terminus binds to calcineurin. In our earlier study, we showed that calcineurin binds to dynamin 1 directly and only indirectly to other proteins of the endocytic complex (7Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. De Camilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Since binding of cain to amphiphysin 1 does not affect amphiphysin's interaction with other endocytic proteins, we postulate that cain terminates synaptic vesicle endocytosis by inhibiting calcineurin activity, rather than sterically interfering with the endocytic protein complex assembly.Figure 4Proposed model of the role of cain in negatively regulating endocytosis. Please refer to “Results and Discussion” for a detailed discussion of the proposed model. Briefly, the assembly of endocytic proteins adaptin (adp), amphiphysin 1 (amph1), amphiphysin 2 (amph2), clathrin (cla), dynamin 1 (dyn1), and synaptojanin (syj) into a functional complex is driven by calcineurin (Cn)-mediated dephosphorylation. In the presence of increased intracellular calcium concentration, active calcineurin is delivered to this complex of proteins via its interaction with dynamin 1. Once the endocytic coat complex is fully assembled, cain, which is stably associated with amphiphysin 1, promotes the rephosphorylation and dissociation of endocytic proteins by inactivating calcineurin. In this regard, cain may work in concert with cellular kinases to negatively regulate the assembly of endocytic protein complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 achieve their therapeutic effect of preventing host-versus-graft rejections by inhibiting calcineurin activity. In the present study, we show that these drugs also impair synaptic vesicle endocytosis by mimicking the calcineurin inhibitory action of cain. Post-transplantation patients receiving cyclosporin A or FK506 commonly exhibit a variety of neurologic symptoms including tremors, seizures, and leukoencephalopathy (26Menegaux F. Keeffe E.B.

Future works may elucidate a mechanistic connection between these clinical observations and calcineurin's role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. The release of neurotransmitters from nerve terminals employs a calcium-dependent exocytotic process involving a group of proteins that interact in a calcium-dependent fashion (1Sudhof T.C.

The burst of calcium that initiates exocytosis also leads to synaptic vesicle recycling by endocytosis of the released vesicles and is mediated by a unique complex of endocytic proteins, which includes amphiphysin, synaptojanin, dynamin 1, clathrin, and clathrin adapters (3De Camilli P.

Assembly of the endocytic proteins into a functional complex depends on their dephosphorylation (6Robinson P.J. Sontag J.M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H. Sudhof T.C.

Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the calcium-sensitive phosphatase calcineurin is physically linked to the endocytic proteins via its interaction with dynamin 1, the GTPase component of the synaptic vesicle coat complex (8Lai M.M. Hong J.J. Ruggiero A.M. Burnett P.E. Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25963-25966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The calcium-dependent nature of the calcineurin-dynamin 1 interaction acts as a calcium sensor for endocytosis, which is initiated by calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of endocytic proteins. Recently, we and others (9Lai M.M. Burnett P.E. Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18325-18331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 10Sun L. Youn H.D. Loh C. Stolow M. He W. Liu J.O. Immunity. 1998; 8: 703-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) identified a novel protein designated cain (calcineurin inhibitor) or cabin (calcineurin-binding protein), which binds to and inhibits calcineurin. Cain/cabin was initially cloned from brain and lymphocyte libraries but has subsequently been found in a broad range of tissues. In T cells, cabin has been shown to regulate T cell receptor (TCR)-induced apoptosis through its interaction with the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) (11Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Jun J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, cain's role in the nervous system has not been clearly elucidated. Given its large size (240 kDa) and modular organization, we had hypothesized that cain may function as a scaffolding protein linking calcineurin to a variety of target proteins. We now show that cain binds to amphiphysin 1 in the endocytic complex and, in providing localized inhibition of calcineurin, serves as a physiologic negative regulator of endocytosis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCain is a 240-kDa protein that binds calcineurin through a 38-amino acid region near its C-terminal tail (Fig.1 A). It is hypothesized that the rest of cain, which contains several potential protein-protein interacting domains, allows cain to act as a scaffolding protein linking calcineurin to other target proteins in the cell. The mid-portion of cain possesses a proline-rich domain (amino acids 1748–1876) whose properties closely resemble those of other proteins that bind with some selectivity to the SH3 domain of the endocytic protein amphiphysin 1 (15Grabs D. Slepnev V.I. Songyang Z. David C. Lynch M. Cantley L.C. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13419-13425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we wondered whether cain might directly interact with amphiphysin 1 and thereby “deliver” localized inhibition of calcineurin activity within the synaptic endocytic complex. To test this hypothesis, we conducted immunoprecipitation experiments in whole rat brain lysates using anti-cain antibody. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitate with an antibody to amphiphysin 1 reveals a robust interaction between cain and amphiphysin 1, which is not evident with preimmune serum (Fig.1 B).The SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1 has been shown previously to bind the proline-rich region of dynamin 1 (16David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We wondered whether the cain-amphiphysin 1 interaction could co-exist with the dynamin 1-amphiphysin 1 interaction or whether the binding of cain to amphiphysin 1 displaces dynamin 1 from the SH3 domain. To address this issue, we checked the cain immunoprecipitate for other co-immunoprecipitated proteins by Western immunoblotting. We found that amphiphysin 1, dynamin 1, and adaptin all co-immunoprecipitate with cain; whereas an unrelated GTP-binding protein Rap2 does not interact with any member of this complex (Fig. 1 C). Our results demonstrate that both cain and dynamin 1 can simultaneously bind the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1. Furthermore, the stable association between cain and amphiphysin 1 suggests that cain is an integral component of the synaptic endocytic protein complex.To further clarify the domains of cain and amphiphysin that interact, we conducted binding experiments utilizing various truncations of myc-cain and GST-amphiphysin 1 (Fig.2 A). GST-amphiphysin 1 binds to full-length myc-cain and to its proline-rich domain but not to any other portion of cain. To confirm the involvement of the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1, we examined the ability of the isolated SH3 domain of GST-amphiphysin 1 to bind to myc-cain (Fig. 2 B). The SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1 behaves identically as the full-length protein in binding to both the full-length and proline-rich domain of myc-cain, suggesting that it contains all the necessary sequence for binding cain. Thus, interactions between the two proteins are mediated by the proline-rich domain of cain and the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1.In earlier studies, we showed that calcineurin activates synaptic vesicle endocytic process by dephosphorylating endocytic proteins (7Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. De Camilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Since cain is a physiologic inhibitor of calcineurin, we hypothesize that it may deactivate endocytosis. Accordingly, we monitored the uptake of biotinylated transferrin in HEK293 cells, a procedure that has been shown to reflect endocytic events (17van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 18Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). As a positive control, we transfected a dominant negative construct of dynamin 1 (dynamin K44E), in which a lysine critical for the GTPase activity of dynamin has been mutated to glutamic acid. Expression of dynamin K44E has been shown to alter clathrin distribution and block transferrin uptake (19Herskovits J. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In our system, transferrin internalization in HEK293 cells transfected with vector alone increases linearly for 5 min and then plateaus with a modest decline at 25 min. During the linear portion of the time course, transfection with the mutant dynamin K44E construct reduces transferrin uptake by about 34–38%. Since the transfection efficiency is only about 50% (data not shown), this reflects a 70% reduction in endocytosis and is consistent with the known role of dynamin 1 in mediating transferrin endocytosis. These results resemble the findings of Schmid and associates (17van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), who found a 40% reduction of transferrin uptake by the same mutant dynamin construct transiently transfected into HeLa cells at 25–60% efficiency. Mutant dynamin K44E stably transfected into HeLa cells, with presumed 100% efficiency, reduced transferrin uptake about 75% (18Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Overexpression of cain in our system reduces endocytosis to about the same extent as the expression of dominant negative dynamin 1 (Fig.3).Figure 3Cain inhibits transferrin endocytosis.The kinetics of transferrin endocytosis by HEK293 cells transfected with the indicated constructs were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression of cain blocks transferrin endocytosis as potently as the expression of the dominant negative dynamin K44E construct. The results are the mean of four independent experiments. The mean and S.E. values at the 5-min time point are as follows: vector alone, 80 ± 2.9; cain, 60 ± 3.2; dynamin K44E, 61 ± 2.3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)If endocytosis reflects dephosphorylation by calcineurin, then inhibitors of calcineurin other than cain should also reduce endocytosis.

Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. De Camilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) showed that all of the proteins of the synaptic vesicle endocytic complex, including clathrin, adaptin, dynamin 1, amphiphysin 1, amphiphysin 2, and synaptojanin, must be dephosphorylated to assemble into an active complex (6Robinson P.J.

Previously, we demonstrated that calcineurin is the calcium sensor that initiates these events and mediates the dephosphorylation of these proteins (8Lai M.M. Hong J.J. Ruggiero A.M. Burnett P.E.

In the present study, we extend this model by showing that cain can bind directly to amphiphysin 1 as well as to calcineurin and therefore functions as a physiologic inhibitor of endocytosis (Fig.4). Our co-immunoprecipitation experiments establish that cain binds to calcineurin and to amphiphysin 1 simultaneously, which is consistent with different domains of cain involved in two separate protein-protein interactions. Specifically, the proline-rich domain of cain binds to amphiphysin 1, while its C terminus binds to calcineurin. In our earlier study, we showed that calcineurin binds to dynamin 1 directly and only indirectly to other proteins of the endocytic complex (7Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. De Camilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Since binding of cain to amphiphysin 1 does not affect amphiphysin's interaction with other endocytic proteins, we postulate that cain terminates synaptic vesicle endocytosis by inhibiting calcineurin activity, rather than sterically interfering with the endocytic protein complex assembly. The immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 achieve their therapeutic effect of preventing host-versus-graft rejections by inhibiting calcineurin activity. In the present study, we show that these drugs also impair synaptic vesicle endocytosis by mimicking the calcineurin inhibitory action of cain. Post-transplantation patients receiving cyclosporin A or FK506 commonly exhibit a variety of neurologic symptoms including tremors, seizures, and leukoencephalopathy (26Menegaux F. Keeffe E.B.

The shape of the presynaptic Ca2+ signal largely determines the amount of released quanta and thus the size of the synaptic response. Ca2+-channel function is modulated in particular by the auxiliary β-subunits that interact intracellularly with the pore-forming α1-subunit. Using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer in cultured hippocampal neurons, we demonstrate that functional GFP-β4 constructs colocalize with the synaptic vesicle marker synaptobrevin II and endogenous P/Q-type channels, indicating that β4-subunits are localized to synaptic sites.

The nonconserved amino- and carboxyl-termini of the β4-subunit were found to target the protein to the synapse. Physiological measurements in autaptic hippocampal neurons infected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-β4 revealed an increase in both excitatory post-synaptic current amplitude and paired pulse facilitation ratio, whereas the GFP-β4mutant, GFP-β4(Δ50–407), which demonstrated a cytosolic localization pattern, did not alter these synaptic properties.

Neuronal Ca2+-channels consist of a pore-forming α1-subunit and several auxiliary subunits (β-, α2δ-, and presumably γ-subunits), which are associated with the α1-subunit. Ca2+-channel function is determined by different β-subunits, which modify the gating properties of the channel and most likely the transport of the α1-subunit to the cell surface (3Gregg R.G.

A pre- and post-synaptic localization has been suggested for β1-, β3-, and β4-subunits, but a precise role for any β-subunit in synaptic transmission has not been described so far. New approaches in cell biology to study protein targeting within a cell, e.g. GFP1and viral transfection methods, allow the overexpression of ion channel subunits in cultured neuronal cells to analyze their transport to specific subcellular compartments (12Jareb M. Banker G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Applying these methods, we investigated the distribution and specific function of the Ca2+-channel β4-subunit in cultured hippocampal neurons. We demonstrated that the β4-subunit is localized to presynaptic terminals and that its N and C termini are responsible for this specific targeting. Furthermore, we show that β4-subunits of voltage-gated Ca2+-channels play an important physiological role in synaptic transmission by altering amplitude and activity-dependent properties of the synaptic response. The rat β4 cDNA (13Castellano A. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Perez-Reyes E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12359-12366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified with the following primer pairs, which include restriction sites for subcloning: 5′-GATCTCGAGATGTCGTCCTCCTACGCCAAG and 3′-ACGGTCGACTCAAAGCCTATGTCGGGAGTC. The constructs were subcloned in-frame into pEGFP-C3(CLONTECH) and then excised for cloning into the Semliki Forest virus vector pSFV1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Deletion mutants were constructed using a single PCR reaction where restriction sites for subcloning into pEGFP-C3(CLONTECH) were placed within the oligonucleotide primer. The following primer pairs were used for the deletion mutants: N terminus (aa 1–49), 5′-GATCTCGAGATGTCGTCCTCCTACGCCAAG and 3′-GGGGGATCCCCCCTGTCTGAGGATGAAGCTGGT; C terminus (aa 408–519), 5′-CCCAAGCTTCCTATGACCCCATTGCTGGGG and 3′-ACGGTCGACTCAAAGCCTATGTCGGGAGTC; Δ50–407, 5′-GATCTCGAGTCAGCAGATTCCTATACA and 3′-CCCAAGCTTGGTGCTACTGCTTGTGTGGGT. The pEGFP-C3-β4 deletion clones were subcloned into pSFV by blunt end cloning and correct orientation of the constructs were verified by cDNA sequencing. cDNAs encoding β4 (13Castellano A. Wei X.

Western blotting of infected HEK293 cells with a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH) was performed according to standard procedures as described by Mark et al.(14Mark M.D. Liu Y. Wong S.T. Hinds T.R. Storm D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected with the Ca2+-channel subunits α1A, α2δ, and β4, GFP-β4, or GFP-β4(Δ50–407). cDNAs and whole cell recordings were performed as published previously (15Herlitze S. Garcia D.E. Mackie K. Hille B. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Membrane capacitance and series resistance were compensated electronically using the patch clamp amplifier (EPC-9; HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Voltage protocol design and data acquisition were performed using Pulse++, version 1.7 software (Ulix GmbH, Tuebingen, Germany) on a Macintosh Power PC. Inactivation measurements for control of functional GFP constructs (Figs. 1 and 5) were performed with 10 mm Ba2+ as the current carrier at room temperature. 2- and 10-ms inactivation protocols were measured with 4 mm Ca2+ instead of Ba2+ as the current carrier, also at room temperature (extracellular solution in mm: 100 Tris, 4 MgCl2, 4 CaCl2, pH 7.3, with methanesulfonic acid). Ca2+- and Ba2+-currents were analyzed using the IGOR data analysis package (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Peak currents were determined from the current measured at +10 mV. Currents were elicited by a 500-ms voltage ramp from −70 mV to +50 mV. Time constants of inactivation (τ-inact) were determined by fitting the decay phase of a 1000-ms test pulse from −70 mV to +10 mV with a single exponential or, as shown in Fig. 9, by fitting the decreasing tail currents elicited by 2- or 10-ms test pulses from −70 mV to +10 mV every 50 ms with a single exponential. The percent current reduction was determined by comparing the size of the first elicited tail current and the last elicited tail current with the 20 Hz stimulation protocol. 20 test pulses were applied within the 20 Hz stimulation protocol in HEK293 cells.

Stevens C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). After 9–14 days in culture, cells were infected with 50 μl of an activated Semliki Forest virus containing the cDNAs of GFP-β4 or GFP-β4-deletion constructs following a protocol given in Ashery et al. (17Ashery U. Betz A. Xu T. Brose N. Rettig J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). All measurements were performed 6–18 h after infection. Only dots containing a single neuron forming excitatory synapses (autapses) were used. Extracellular recording solution contained (in mm): 172 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 4 CaCl2, 4 MgCl2, and 0.03 CdCl2 (pH 7.3, 350 mosmol). Patch pipettes (2–3 megaohms) were pulled from borosilicate glass (TWF 150, World Precision Instruments) on a Sutter puller and back-filled with the following (in mm): 145 potassium gluconate, 15 HEPES, 1 potassium-EGTA, 4 Na-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP (pH 7.3). Currents were recorded and analyzed as published previously by Lao et al. (18Lao G. Scheuss V. Gerwin C.M. Su Q. Mochida S. Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Neuron. 2000; 25: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Continental hippocampal cultures were prepared and infected as described above and fixed as described by Market al. (14Mark M.D. Liu Y. Wong S.T. Hinds T.R. Storm D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Neurons were incubated with synaptobrevin II antibody (C69.1 at 1:1000, a gift from R. Jahn, Göttingen, Germany), Ca2+-channel α1A-subunit antibody (Chemicon; 1:60) or MAP2 antibody (Sigma; 1:1000) and then with an Alexa 546-coupled secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands). Cells were embedded in Fluoromount (133 mmTris-HCl, 30% glycerol, 11% Mowiol, 2% diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane. Fluorescence was detected with a conventional fluorescence microscope (Axiophot; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), and images were analyzed with the Metamorph imaging system. A fusion construct between GFP and the β4-subunit was generated to analyze the distribution and function of this Ca2+-channel subunit (Fig.1 a). The GFP was tagged in frame to the N terminus of the β4-subunit using the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C3 and subcloned into the Semliki Forest virus vector (pSFV). We first investigated whether the fusion construct of the virus expresses a protein of the correct size. Western blot analysis of HEK293 cells infected with GFP-β4 revealed an 83-kDa band, the predicted size of the GFP-β4 fusion protein (Fig. 1 b). In addition, the GFP-β4 protein assembled with the α1A- and α2δ-subunits to form a functional voltage-gated Ca2+-channel in HEK293 cells. Whole cell peak currents were measured at +10 mV during a 500-ms voltage ramp from −70 to +50 mV and increased from −38 ± 14 pA (n = 7) for α1A/α2δ to −602 ± 314 pA (n = 11) with the GFP-β4 fusion protein, which was comparable to the wild-type β4 currents (-744 ± 209 pA (n = 23)) (Fig. 1 c). In addition, GFP-β4 revealed the characteristic slow inactivation time constants at 0, +5, +10, and +15 mV (τ-inact) as described for wild-type β4-subunit assembled with P/Q-type Ca2+-channels (188 ± 22 (0 mV), 145 ± 18 (+5 mV), 131 ± 18 (+10 mV), and 130 ± 15 ms (+15 mV) (n = 6) for wild-type-β4; (178 ± 29 (0 mV), 149 ± 18 (+5 mV), 136 ± 12 (+10 mV), and 147 ± 22 ms (+15 mV) (n = 6) for GFP-β4) (Fig. 1 d) (19Stea A. Tomlinson W.J. Soong T.W. Bourinet E. Dubel S.J. Vincent S.R. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10576-10580Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Thus, GFP-β4 constructs yield functional β4-protein, which alters the electrophysiological characteristics of the P/Q-type Ca2+-channels in the expected manner. To investigate the distribution of β4 in hippocampal neurons, 9–14-day-old neurons were infected with the GFP-β4 construct using the Semliki Forest virus gene expression system. Overexpressed GFP-β4-subunits displayed a punctate staining pattern along the neuronal processes (Fig. 2, a–c), as observed for vesicle-transported proteins like synaptobrevin II, syntaxin, or syntaphilin, whereas overexpressed GFP alone showed a diffuse, cytosolic distribution along the neurites (Fig. 2, d–f). Colocalization with the synaptic vesicle marker synaptobrevin II (Fig.2c) revealed that GFP-β4 was indeed transported to synaptic sites. P/Q-type Ca2+-channels are highly expressed in presynaptic terminals (20Westenbroek R.E. Hoskins L. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6319-6330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and play a fundamental role in synaptic transmission (2Dunlap K. Luebke J.I. Turner T.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 89-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Because β4-subunits can assemble with α1A-subunits to form functional channels in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1), we investigated whether β4-subunits colocalize with endogenous presynaptic Ca2+-channels in hippocampal neurons. Costaining between the α1A-subunit encoding for the P/Q-type channel and GFP-β4 demonstrated the colocalization of both proteins (Fig. 3). Next, we investigated whether the β4-subunit is localized to dendrites or axons. Double-labeling with the dendritic marker MAP2 identified the fact that GFP-β4 is transported to both dendrites and axons (Fig. 4). Thus, our results highly suggest that the β4-subunit is targeted to synaptic sites.Figure 3Colocalization of GFP -β4 with Ca 2+ -channel α1A-subunit in cultured hippocampal neurons. a, fluorescence patterns of neurons from low density hippocampal cultures infected with GFP-β4 reveal a punctate staining. b, hippocampal cells were stained with an anti-α1A antibody and visualized with an Alexa 546-coupled secondary antibody.

De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 22Hanlon M.R. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Wallace B.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (Fig.5 a). A high degree of conservation among the β-subunits was observed for domainsII and IV, but not for domains I (N terminus), III, and V (C terminus). To determine which domain of β4 is responsible for targeting this subunit to its specific subcellular localization, we produced several deletion constructs of GFP-β4 according to the domain assignment (Fig. 5 a). These constructs expressed fusion proteins of the expected size (Fig. 5 b). The minimal segments required for punctate localization and colocalization with synaptobrevin II were domain I (N terminus, aa 1–49) and domain V (C terminus, aa 408–519) of the β4-subunit. 97% of the cells infected with the C terminus and 72% of the cells infected with the N terminus colocalized with synaptobrevin II and showed a punctate pattern (TableI). Thus, either N or C terminus alone is sufficient for colocalization with synaptobrevin II (Fig.6, a–f). In contrast, a deletion construct lacking both the N and C termini (aa 50–407; domains II–IV), such as GFP alone, revealed a homogenous, cytosolic localization. 72% of these cells showed no synaptobrevin II colocalization (Fig. 6, g–i) (data summarized in Table I). The punctate staining pattern and its colocalization with synaptobrevin II indicates that the N and C termini of GFP-β4 are sufficient for synaptic targeting.Table IStatistical analysis of punctate staining pattern in hippocampal neurons infected with various β4 constructsInfected constructsNumber of infected cells with punctate stainingNumber of infected cells with no punctate stainingPercentage of infected cells with punctate staining (%)No. of cells analyzedGFP-β42201793237GFP-C-terminus198797205GFP-N-terminus1435772200GFP-β4(Δ50–407)5915428213GFP1917611195Low density hippocampal cultures were prepared and infected with various β4 constructs after 9–14 days in culture, fixed, and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Low density hippocampal cultures were prepared and infected with various β4 constructs after 9–14 days in culture, fixed, and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To investigate the physiological role of GFP-β4, we measured EPSCs in the whole cell, voltage clamp configuration from autaptic hippocampal neurons infected with GFP-β4and GFP-β4(Δ50–407) and compared them with the EPSCs from noninfected neurons. As shown in Fig. 5, c andd, GFP-β4(Δ50–407) assembled to form a functional Ca2+-channel when expressed together with the α1A- and α2δ-subunit in HEK293 cells. The channel revealed inactivation properties comparable with the GFP-β4 assembled channels and increased the whole cell peak current measured at +10 mV (α1A, −48 ± 4 pA (n = 5); α1A/α2δ/GFP-β4(Δ50–407), −1715 ± 390 pA (n = 17)). Since GFP-β4(Δ50–407) did not colocalize with synaptobrevin II, specific presynaptic effects on synaptic transmission should become obvious only in the presence of GFP-β4, but not in the presence of GFP-β4(Δ50–407). Recordings were performed in the presence of 30 μm Cs2+, which reduces the EPSC amplitude by >90%,2 to more easily detect changes in EPSC size and facilitation properties between infected and noninfected cells. EPSC amplitudes for infected cells were related to the average EPSC size measured for noninfected autaptic hippocampal neurons prepared and measured on the same day. The average EPSC size increased drastically from 100 ± 20% (n = 46) for noninfected neurons to 334 ± 63% (n = 40, p < 0.01) for GFP-β4-infected neurons, but decreased for GFP-β4(Δ50–407) infected neurons to 50 ± 17% (n = 34) (Fig. 7,a and b), indicating an increased transmitter release in the presence of GFP-β4 but not GFP-β4(Δ50–407). Short term synaptic enhancements during repetitive synaptic activity are attributable to a presynaptic increase in the number of transmitter quanta released. Ca2+ entry during the conditioning stimulation is required for their induction (23Fisher S.A. Fischer T.M. Carew T.J. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 170-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 24Zucker R.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the effects of GFP-β4 and GFP-β4(Δ50–407) on the facilitation properties of autaptic hippocampal neurons for EPSCs, which were larger than 80 pA and of comparable size in the infected and noninfected neurons. The ratios between the amplitudes of the first evoked EPSCs and the fourth evoked EPSCs for low and high frequency stimulations were determined. Low frequency stimulation (0.2 Hz) produced no EPSC facilitation in control (0.83 ± 0.04 (n = 59)), GFP-β4-infected (0.86 ± 0.05 (n = 33)), or GFP-β4(Δ50–407)-infected (0.92 ± 0.06 (n = 24)) cells (Fig. 8,a and b). In contrast, high frequency stimulation (20 Hz) led to paired pulse facilitation of EPSCs. More importantly, paired pulse facilitation is increased significantly from 1.47 ± 0.07 (n = 44) in control cells to 2.67 ± 0.29 (n = 39) in GFP-β4-infected cells (p < 0.01) but not in GFP-β4(Δ50–407)-infected cells (1.17 ± 0.06 (n = 25)) (Fig. 8, c and d), indicating a presynaptic function of GFP-β4 on paired pulse facilitation. To investigate whether the gating properties of a specific Ca2+-channel type assembled with different β-subunits may account for the altered facilitation properties observed with overexpressed β4-subunits in cultured hippocampal neurons, we analyzed Ca2+-currents (ICa2+) during high frequency stimulation of P/Q-type channels assembled with β4 and β1b. We transfected HEK293 cells with α1A/α2δ and β4 or β1b, respectively, and elicited ICa2+ by a 20 Hz stimulation protocol. P/Q-type channels assembled with the β1b-subunit inactivated faster (32.5 ± 2.1 ms (n = 21)) and to a higher degree (87 ± 2% (n = 17)) than channels assembled with the β4-subunit (54.9 ± 7.5 ms (n = 31); 74 ± 2% (n = 25)) when 10-ms test pulses to +10 mV were applied (Fig. 9). 20 Hz application of 2-ms test pulses to +10 mV had no effect on the size of P/Q-type channel currents assembled with β4, whereas ICa2+ through β1b assembled channels decreased slowly (249 ± 22 ms (n = 20) by 22.5 ± 1.8%) (Fig. 9). Thus, the assembly of P/Q-type Ca2+-channel with different β-subunits at the presynapses may be responsible for the increased facilitation in the presence of overexpressed β4. In this study, we describe the synaptic distribution and function of the Ca2+-channel β4-subunit in cultured hippocampal neurons. Overexpression of a functional GFP-β4 fusion protein in cultured hippocampal neurons revealed a punctate staining pattern similar to the distribution of synaptic proteins synapsin I, synaptophysin (25Fletcher T.L.

Colocalization of GFP-β4 with synaptobrevin II, a highly enriched presynaptic vesicle protein involved in transmitter release (29Elferink L.A. Trimble W.S. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11061-11064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the presynaptic P/Q-type Ca2+-channel α1A-subunit suggests that GFP-β4 is also targeted to the presynaptic terminals. The recent finding that α1A and synaptobrevin are colocalized in mobile transport packets in hippocampal neurons (30Ahmari S.E. Buchanan J. Smith S.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) supports our results. Targeting signals to specific organelles have been identified in the extracellular and transmembrane domains of various proteins (31Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bradke F. Dotti C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Infection of cultured hippocampal neurons with viral vectors is useful for identifying specific axonal sorting signals. For example, synaptobrevin contains a 92-aa long N-terminal region that is responsible for axonal targeting (28West A.E. Neve R.L. Buckley K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas the metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 contains a 60-aa long cytoplasmic domain that mediates both axonal and dendritic targeting (33Stowell J.N. Craig A.M. Neuron. 1999; 22: 525-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To detect sequences responsible for targeting the β4-subunit to presynaptic sites, we made use of the functional map and domain assignments suggested by Walker and De Waard (21Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and Hanlon et al. (22Hanlon M.R. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Wallace B.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The identity of the N and C termini domains is only 2–3%, and these domains may therefore encode for different targeting signals among the β-subunits as suggested by the colocalization of the N and C termini GFP fusion constructs with synaptobrevin. In addition, a β1b-specific acidic sequence in the C terminus has been described as responsible for membrane association of the β1b-subunit (34Bogdanov Y. Brice N.L. Canti C. Page K.M. Li M. Volsen S.G. Dolphin A.C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A comparison of the targeting sequences from the β4-subunit and the presynaptically transported proteins synaptobrevin II and mGluR7 did not reveal any homology. Therefore, the N- and C-terminal targeting sequences of Ca2+-channel β4-subunit are distinct from other known presynaptic targeting signals. Interestingly, the C terminus of β4has been identified as a specifc, low affinity interaction site with the C terminus of α1A (35Walker D. Bichet D. Campbell K.P. De Waard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2361-2367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The specific interaction between α1A- and β4-subunits and the targeting to the presynapse mediated by β4 may indicate how P/Q-type Ca2+-channel complexes are assembled at the presynapse. However, the assembly of β4-subunits with other α1-subunits at the presynapse cannot be excluded. Physiological studies point to a presynaptic function of the Ca2+-channel β4-subunit. For example, in lethargic mice where no functional β4-subunit is expressed (36McEnery M.W. Copeland T.D. Vance C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21435-21438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the excitatory synaptic transmission in the thalamus and hippocampus, as well as the KCl-induced Ca2+-uptake through P/Q-type channels in thalamic and neocortical synaptosomes, is reduced (37Caddick S.J.

In our study, we demonstrate a synaptic function of β4-subunits in synaptic transmission because overexpression of GFP-β4 but not GFP-β4(Δ50–407) increased EPSC amplitude and paired pulse facilitation. One of the factors contributing to facilitation and EPSC size is the amount of Ca2+-influx into the presynaptic terminal through voltage-gated Ca2+-channels. β-subunits have been described as determining the transport of the pore-forming α1-subunits to the cell surface and increasing the number of channels in the plasma membrane (3Gregg R.G. Messing A. Strube C. Beurg M. Moss R. Behan M. Sukhareva M. Haynes S. Powell J.A. Coronado R. Powers P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuron. 2000; 25: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). An increase in the presynaptic Ca2+-channel concentration may account for the larger EPSC amplitudes due to a higher release probability. We therefore measured somatic non-L-type Ca2+-currents in GFP-β4 infected and noninfected hippocampal neurons and observed a slight but not significant increase in current amplitude for GFP-β4 infected cells (−0.748 ± 0.255 nA (n = 9)) compared with noninfected neurons (−0.446 ± 0.123 nA (n = 9)). Thus, other effects leading to an increase in EPSC amplitude and facilitation cannot be excluded. For example, if the Ca2+-channel concentration at autaptic synapses does not change and the release probability at a single synapse is not affected by overexpression of β4, then the successful transmission for a given action potential would remain unchanged. The formation of new synaptic contacts, new active sites, or postsynaptic effects, such as an increase in ligand gated cation channels, would explain our results. However, the altered facilitation properties point to a presynaptic mechanism. The increase in the paired pulse facilitation ratio may reflect the slow inactivation time of presynaptic Ca2+-channels assembled with the β4-subunit for a limited access of Ca2+, because β4 causes Ca2+-channels to inactivate slower compared with channel complexes containing β1b or β3 (19Stea A. Tomlinson W.J. Soong T.W. Bourinet E. Dubel S.J. Vincent S.R. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10576-10580Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 40Brody D.L. Yue D.T. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 889-898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis is underlined by our results showing that in the presence of β4-subunits, inactivation is slower and current reduction is decreased compared with P/Q-type channels expressed with β1b. Therefore, Ca2+-channel complexes containing β4-subunits at the presynapse may contribute to increased synaptic facilitation. In summary, our findings suggest a presynaptic function of Ca2+-channel β4-subunits in synaptic transmission. The specific targeting of β4 depends on its nonconserved N and C termini, which is critical for the localization of the subunit to synaptic terminals and for the short term modulation of synaptic transmission.

Since cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) integrates a number of cell signaling pathways, we investigated whether CBP is important for TRH stimulation of the TSH subunit genes. Cotransfection of E1A in GH3 cells completely blocked TRH stimulation of the TSH subunit genes, suggesting that CBP is a key factor for TRH signaling in the pituitary. CBP and Pit-1 acted synergistically in TRH stimulation of the TSH-β promoter, and amino acids 1–450 of CBP were sufficient for the TRH effect. In contrast, on the human α-GSU promoter, CREB and P-Lim mediated TRH signaling. Intriguingly, CREB was phosphorylated upon TRH stimulation, leading to CBP recruitment to the α-GSU promoter. CBP also interacted with P-Lim in a TRH-dependent manner, suggesting that P-Lim is an important factor for non-cAMP response element-mediated TRH stimulation of this promoter. Distinct domains of CBP were required for TRH signaling by CREB and P-Lim on the α-GSU promoter, amino acids 450–700 and 1–450, respectively. Thus, the amino terminus of CBP plays a critical role in TRH signaling in the anterior pituitary via both Pit-1-dependent and -independent pathways, yielding differential regulation of pituitary gene products.

These hormones consist of two non-identical and noncovalently linked subunits termed α and β. The α subunit (α-glycoprotein hormone subunit (α-GSU)) is common to all members of this family and is expressed in molar excess in the pituitary to facilitate formation of the intact hormone (1Kourides I.A. Gurr J.A. Wolf O. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1984; 40: 79-117PubMed Google Scholar). The β subunit is unique and confers specific biological activity to each dimeric hormone (2Licht P. Denver R.J.

Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). The TSH subunit genes are coordinately regulated at a transcriptional level by thyroid hormone (4Wondisford F.E. Farr E.A.

Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both thyroid hormone and dopamine reduce TSH subunit gene transcription in the anterior pituitary, whereas TRH increases transcription of these genes. However, the transcriptional response of the α-GSU and TSH-β subunit genes is not identical for these stimuli. For example, thyroid hormone treatment inhibits transcription of the α-GSU gene more slowly and to a lesser extent than that of the TSH-β gene. In contrast, transcription of the α-GSU gene is stimulated to a somewhat greater extent compared with the TSH-β gene by TRH (5Shupnik M.A. Greenspan S.L. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12675-12679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the anterior pituitary, TRH bound to its receptor is known to activate phospholipase C, leading to calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation (6Carr F.E. Shupnik M.A. Burnside J.

It has been suggested that the pituitary-specific transcription factor GHF-1/Pit-1 (hereafter referred to as Pit-1) is required for TRH regulation of the TSH-β and prolactin genes in humans and rats (10Steinfelder H. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5942-5945Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Pit-1 is a member of a group of homeobox proteins containing both a homeodomain and a POU-specific domain, both of which are important for DNA binding (11Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In addition to its signaling function in the anterior pituitary, Pit-1 is also necessary for cell-specific expression of prolactin, growth hormone, and TSH (12Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Interestingly, the TSH-β gene does not contain a consensus phorbol ester response element (AP-1 site), which is known to respond to activation of the protein kinase C pathway. Thus, the mechanism by which TRH mediates induction of this gene is unknown. We and others have shown that Pit-1 DNA-binding sites are required for TRH induction of the prolactin and TSH-β genes (13Kapiloff M.S. Farkash Y. Wegner M. Rosenfeld M.G.

These data suggest that the signaling pathways responsible for TRH stimulation of the TSH subunit genes may diverge at least at the level of the transcription factors controlling gene transcription.Several investigators have shown that CREB-binding protein (CBP) integrates a number of diverse cell signaling pathways involving protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and nuclear hormone receptors (18Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). We and others have recently shown that CBP can constitutively bind to Pit-1 and synergistically activate transcription of promoters containing Pit-1 DNA-binding sites (19Xu L. Lavinsky R.M.

We have demonstrated previously that CBP and Pit-1 enhance protein kinase A induction of the prolactin gene in a synergistic manner (20Zanger K. Cohen L.E. Hashimoto K. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 268-275PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we explore the hypothesis that CBP may play a pivotal role in TRH induction of both of the TSH subunit genes and whether distinct TRH signaling mechanisms are responsible for induction of these genes.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we show that CBP mediates TRH signaling on both the human α-GSU and TSH-β promoters via different mechanisms. We have shown that CBP enhances expression of pituitary genes such as growth hormone and prolactin (20Zanger K. Cohen L.E. Hashimoto K. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Mol.

In this study, E1A clearly blocked TRH stimulation of the TSH subunit genes in a pituitary cell line, indicating that CBP may play an important role in TRH stimulation of the anterior pituitary (Fig. 1). We and others have also shown that Pit-1 plays an important role in TRH stimulation of the prolactin and TSH-β subunit genes (10Steinfelder H. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5942-5945Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Steinfelder H.J. Hauser P. Nakayama Y. Radovick S. McClaskey J.H. Taylor T. Weintraub B.D. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 43-52PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a mechanism was proposed whereby CBP bound to Pit-1 would mediate the effect of certain signaling pathways in the pituitary (19Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. Mclnerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D. Korzus E. Kurokawa R. Aggarwal A.K. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

CBP binds to Pit-1 via two distinct domains, the C/H1 and C/H3 domains. On the rat proximal prolactin promoter, CBP synergistically enhances Pit-1-dependent TRH stimulation via the C/H1 domain and protein kinase A stimulation via the C/H3 domain (20Zanger K. Cohen L.E. Hashimoto K. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 268-275PubMed Google Scholar). Our data on the human TSH-β promoter are consistent with the observation that the amino terminus of CBP is sufficient to mediate TRH stimulation via Pit-1 DNA response elements. Since Pit-1 binds to CBP via its C/H1 and C/H3 domains, CBP may be a direct target of the TRH signaling pathway. This is further supported by the work of others studying the prolactin gene or isolated Pit-1 DNA response elements (13Kapiloff M.S. Farkash Y. Wegner M. Rosenfeld M.G.

CBP bound to Pit-1 could also recruit other factors that contain histone acetyltransferase activity such as p/CAF (43Yang X.Y. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) and p/CIP (44Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar) to the transcription complex during TRH stimulation. To date, however, these coactivator proteins have been shown to bind to the C terminus of CBP, which our data clearly show is not required for TRH stimulation of the TSH subunit promoters. Moreover, Chawla et al. (45Chawla S. Hardingham G.E. Quinn D.R. Bading H. Science. 1998; 281: 1505-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) suggested that CBP action is also controlled by nuclear calcium- and calmodulin-dependent kinase IV via the C terminus. This mechanism could be involved since TRH signaling is known to increase Ca2+ influx in the pituitary. However, calcium signaling also appears to act on the C terminus of CBP. Regardless of the mechanism, the amino terminus of CBP contains a coactivator function sufficient for TRH stimulation.Like the TSH-β gene, CBP is also able to activate TRH stimulation of the α-GSU gene. Unlike the TSH-β gene, however, Pit-1 is not required for TRH stimulation. Thus, at the level of the TSH subunit genes, TRH signaling pathways diverge. Previous workers suggested that CREs could in some way be involved in TRH stimulation of the human α-GSU promoter (36Kim D.S. Ahn S.K. Yoon J.H. Hong S.H. Kim K.E. Maurer R.A. Park S.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 528-536PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that phosphorylation of CREB by TRH plays an important role in the ability of CBP to enhance TRH stimulation of this gene. Since the CREB-binding domain of CBP is also required for TRH stimulation of the α-GSU gene, we suggest that phosphorylation of CREB by TRH recruits CBP to the α-GSU promoter to increase transcription (Fig. 7). Traditionally, Ser133 of CREB was thought to be an exclusive target of the protein kinase A signaling pathway (30Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar) and, in contrast, that the protein kinase C signaling pathway regulates phosphorylation of the Jun·Fos (AP-1) complex (46Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). However, others have suggested that calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, and protein kinase C can phosphorylate CREB at Ser133 (47Dash P.K. Karl K.A. Colicos M.A. Prywes R. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5061-5065Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 48Muthusamy N. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22841-22847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 49Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Their data are consistent with our findings since we note that the TRH signaling pathway, which activates protein kinase C and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and increases intracellular levels of calcium, also phosphorylates CREB. The data showing an elevation in intracellular cAMP levels upon TRH stimulation in GH3 cells also support these findings.However, we also found that CBP was able to enhance TRH stimulation on this promoter in the absence of CREs, albeit to a lesser extent. This finding is important since the CREs found in the human α-GSU gene are not conserved in lower mammalian species such as the mouse (37Gordon D. Wood W. Ridgeway E. DNA (N. Y. ). 1988; 7: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Since a significant reduction in TRH stimulation was found when the region between bp −346 and −250 of the α-GSU promoter was deleted, we focused on the region. Located between bp −346 and −313 is a pituitary glycoprotein hormone basal element (12Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is known to bind LIM homeodomain proteins. Mutation of the region in the context of the CRE mutant revealed loss of TRH signaling on the α-GSU promoter. We also demonstrated that P-Lim binds to CBP in TRH-dependent manner on this site and that these proteins synergistically activate the human α-GSU promoter during TRH stimulation. We hypothesize that the P-Lim·CBP complex could be a key mediator of TRH signaling of the α-GSU gene in lower mammals in which the α-GSU promoter contain no consensus CREs.In conclusion, CBP plays a pivotal role in TRH stimulation of the human TSH subunit genes via different amino-terminal domains. As suggested in the model in Fig. 7, recruitment of CBP to the TSH subunit genes involves different DNA-binding transcription factors. The involvement of CBP in TRH stimulation might allow for the integration of other pathways impinging on these genes, such as their negative regulation by thyroid hormone. Thyrotropin (TSH)1 is a member of a pituitary and placental glycoprotein hormone family, which also includes follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and chorionic gonadotropin. These hormones consist of two non-identical and noncovalently linked subunits termed α and β. The α subunit (α-glycoprotein hormone subunit (α-GSU)) is common to all members of this family and is expressed in molar excess in the pituitary to facilitate formation of the intact hormone (1Kourides I.A. Gurr J.A. Wolf O. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1984; 40: 79-117PubMed Google Scholar). The β subunit is unique and confers specific biological activity to each dimeric hormone (2Licht P. Denver R.J. Progress in Comparative Endocrinology. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1990: 427-432Google Scholar, 3Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). The TSH subunit genes are coordinately regulated at a transcriptional level by thyroid hormone (4Wondisford F.E. Farr E.A. Radovick S. Steinfelder H.J. Moates J.M. McClaskey J.H. Weintraub B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14601-14604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), dopamine (5Shupnik M.A. Greenspan S.L. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12675-12679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) (6Carr F.E. Shupnik M.A. Burnside J. Chin W.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both thyroid hormone and dopamine reduce TSH subunit gene transcription in the anterior pituitary, whereas TRH increases transcription of these genes. However, the transcriptional response of the α-GSU and TSH-β subunit genes is not identical for these stimuli. For example, thyroid hormone treatment inhibits transcription of the α-GSU gene more slowly and to a lesser extent than that of the TSH-β gene. In contrast, transcription of the α-GSU gene is stimulated to a somewhat greater extent compared with the TSH-β gene by TRH (5Shupnik M.A. Greenspan S.L. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12675-12679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the anterior pituitary, TRH bound to its receptor is known to activate phospholipase C, leading to calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation (6Carr F.E. Shupnik M.A. Burnside J. Chin W.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 7Carr F.E. Fisher C.U. Fein H.G. Smallridge R.C.

It has been suggested that the pituitary-specific transcription factor GHF-1/Pit-1 (hereafter referred to as Pit-1) is required for TRH regulation of the TSH-β and prolactin genes in humans and rats (10Steinfelder H. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5942-5945Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Pit-1 is a member of a group of homeobox proteins containing both a homeodomain and a POU-specific domain, both of which are important for DNA binding (11Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In addition to its signaling function in the anterior pituitary, Pit-1 is also necessary for cell-specific expression of prolactin, growth hormone, and TSH (12Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the TSH-β gene does not contain a consensus phorbol ester response element (AP-1 site), which is known to respond to activation of the protein kinase C pathway. Thus, the mechanism by which TRH mediates induction of this gene is unknown. We and others have shown that Pit-1 DNA-binding sites are required for TRH induction of the prolactin and TSH-β genes (13Kapiloff M.S. Farkash Y. Wegner M. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1991; 253: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14Steinfelder H.J. Hauser P. Nakayama Y. Radovick S. McClaskey J.H. Taylor T. Weintraub B.D. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3130-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast, the human α-GSU gene, which is also stimulated by TRH, has no Pit-1 DNA-binding sites, but contains two cAMP response elements (CREs) (14Steinfelder H.J. Hauser P. Nakayama Y. Radovick S. McClaskey J.H. Taylor T. Weintraub B.D. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3130-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Jameson J.L. Jaffe R.C.

Diabetes. 1997; 105: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the signaling pathways responsible for TRH stimulation of the TSH subunit genes may diverge at least at the level of the transcription factors controlling gene transcription. Several investigators have shown that CREB-binding protein (CBP) integrates a number of diverse cell signaling pathways involving protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and nuclear hormone receptors (18Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). We and others have recently shown that CBP can constitutively bind to Pit-1 and synergistically activate transcription of promoters containing Pit-1 DNA-binding sites (19Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. Mclnerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D. Korzus E. Kurokawa R. Aggarwal A.K. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

We have demonstrated previously that CBP and Pit-1 enhance protein kinase A induction of the prolactin gene in a synergistic manner (20Zanger K. Cohen L.E. Hashimoto K. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 268-275PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we explore the hypothesis that CBP may play a pivotal role in TRH induction of both of the TSH subunit genes and whether distinct TRH signaling mechanisms are responsible for induction of these genes. DISCUSSIONIn this report, we show that CBP mediates TRH signaling on both the human α-GSU and TSH-β promoters via different mechanisms. We have shown that CBP enhances expression of pituitary genes such as growth hormone and prolactin (20Zanger K. Cohen L.E. Hashimoto K. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 268-275PubMed Google Scholar, 39Cohen L.E. Hashimoto Y. Zanger K. Wondisford F. Radovick S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, E1A clearly blocked TRH stimulation of the TSH subunit genes in a pituitary cell line, indicating that CBP may play an important role in TRH stimulation of the anterior pituitary (Fig. 1). We and others have also shown that Pit-1 plays an important role in TRH stimulation of the prolactin and TSH-β subunit genes (10Steinfelder H. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 43-52PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a mechanism was proposed whereby CBP bound to Pit-1 would mediate the effect of certain signaling pathways in the pituitary (19Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. Mclnerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D. Korzus E. Kurokawa R. Aggarwal A.K. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

CBP binds to Pit-1 via two distinct domains, the C/H1 and C/H3 domains. On the rat proximal prolactin promoter, CBP synergistically enhances Pit-1-dependent TRH stimulation via the C/H1 domain and protein kinase A stimulation via the C/H3 domain (20Zanger K. Cohen L.E. Hashimoto K. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 268-275PubMed Google Scholar). Our data on the human TSH-β promoter are consistent with the observation that the amino terminus of CBP is sufficient to mediate TRH stimulation via Pit-1 DNA response elements. Since Pit-1 binds to CBP via its C/H1 and C/H3 domains, CBP may be a direct target of the TRH signaling pathway. This is further supported by the work of others studying the prolactin gene or isolated Pit-1 DNA response elements (13Kapiloff M.S. Farkash Y. Wegner M. Rosenfeld M.G.

Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). However, others have suggested that calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, and protein kinase C can phosphorylate CREB at Ser133 (47Dash P.K. Karl K.A. Colicos M.A. Prywes R. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5061-5065Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 48Muthusamy N. Leiden J.M. J. Biol.

Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Their data are consistent with our findings since we note that the TRH signaling pathway, which activates protein kinase C and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and increases intracellular levels of calcium, also phosphorylates CREB. The data showing an elevation in intracellular cAMP levels upon TRH stimulation in GH3 cells also support these findings. However, we also found that CBP was able to enhance TRH stimulation on this promoter in the absence of CREs, albeit to a lesser extent. This finding is important since the CREs found in the human α-GSU gene are not conserved in lower mammalian species such as the mouse (37Gordon D. Wood W. Ridgeway E. DNA (N. Y. ). 1988; 7: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Since a significant reduction in TRH stimulation was found when the region between bp −346 and −250 of the α-GSU promoter was deleted, we focused on the region. Located between bp −346 and −313 is a pituitary glycoprotein hormone basal element (12Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is known to bind LIM homeodomain proteins. Mutation of the region in the context of the CRE mutant revealed loss of TRH signaling on the α-GSU promoter. We also demonstrated that P-Lim binds to CBP in TRH-dependent manner on this site and that these proteins synergistically activate the human α-GSU promoter during TRH stimulation. We hypothesize that the P-Lim·CBP complex could be a key mediator of TRH signaling of the α-GSU gene in lower mammals in which the α-GSU promoter contain no consensus CREs. In conclusion, CBP plays a pivotal role in TRH stimulation of the human TSH subunit genes via different amino-terminal domains. As suggested in the model in Fig. 7, recruitment of CBP to the TSH subunit genes involves different DNA-binding transcription factors. The involvement of CBP in TRH stimulation might allow for the integration of other pathways impinging on these genes, such as their negative regulation by thyroid hormone. We thank M. C.

https://openalex.org/W2089407373,"Abstract The c-myc gene is translocated to one of the immunoglobulin genes in Burkitt's lymphoma resulting in deregulated expression of c-myc. Several enhancers have been shown to be important for expression of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. Four enhancer regions (murine-hypersensitive sites (MHS) 1, 2, 3, and 4) located 3′ of the murine immunoglobulin heavy chain gene play a role in activating expression of the translocated c-myc gene. The enhancer regions also result in a shift in transcriptional initiation from the P2 promoter to P1 that is characteristic of the translocated c-myc allele. We found that the most 3′ enhancer region (MHS4) activated the c-mycpromoter by 46-fold in the Raji Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, and it was the most active enhancer in these cells. The addition of enhancer regions MHS1,2 and 3 to MHS4 increased c-myc transcription by an additional 3-fold and resulted in the full promoter shift from P2 to P1. By deletion analysis of enhancer region MHS4, we located a region that was critical for the transcriptional activity of MHS4. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis revealed that NF-κB/Rel family members bound to this region. Mutation of the NF-κB binding site abolished both the enhancer activity and the promoter shift activity of MHS4. An active NF-κB site was also identified in the human HS4 enhancer. Inhibition of c-mycpromoter activity driven by the immunoglobulin enhancers was observed with expression of a super-repressor IκBα construct. These results indicate that the NF-κB/Rel transcription factors play an important role in the deregulation of the translocated c-myc gene in Burkitt's lymphoma and suggest that interference with NF-κB function may represent a new approach to the treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma."
https://openalex.org/W2050286659,"Efficient release of ligands from the Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) of the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor at endosomal pH requires a small set of conserved amino acids that includes a critical histidine residue. When these residues are incorporated at corresponding positions in an homologous galactose-binding derivative of serum mannose-binding protein, the pH dependence of ligand binding becomes more like that of the receptor. The modified CRD displays 40-fold preferential binding to N-acetylgalactosamine compared with galactose, making it a good functional mimic of the asialoglycoprotein receptor. In the crystal structure of the modified CRD bound to N-acetylgalactosamine, the histidine (His202) contacts the 2-acetamido methyl group and also participates in a network of interactions involving Asp212, Arg216, and Tyr218 that positions a water molecule in a hydrogen bond with the sugar amide group. These interactions appear to produce the preference forN-acetylgalactosamine over galactose and are also likely to influence the pK a of His202. Protonation of His202 would disrupt its interaction with an asparagine that serves as a ligand for Ca2+ and sugar. The structure of the modified CRD without sugar displays several different conformations that may represent structures of intermediates in the release of Ca2+ and sugar ligands caused by protonation of His202."

Tax is known to suppress cellular nucleotide excision repair (NER), and this activity has been proposed to play an important role in Tax transformation. In this study we have investigated the mechanism by which Tax suppresses NER with specific focus on the previously characterized ability of Tax to inhibit p53 function. Suppression of NER by Tax was rescued by overexpression of wild-type p53; however, a p53 transactivation-incompetent mutant did not restore NER activity. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, a major transcriptional target of p53, plays an important role in regulating DNA replication and repair. Overexpression of p21 reversed Tax-induced suppression of NER; however, a p21 C-terminal mutant that lacks the proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding domain did not restore NER activity. Thus, p53 and its downstream effector p21 can inhibit Tax-mediated suppression of DNA repair. These results imply that the inactivation of p53 function by Tax contributes to Tax suppression of DNA repair.

Ruscetti F.W. Gadzar A.F. Bunn P.A. Minna J.D. Gallo R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3911) Google Scholar), and a neurodegenerative disease, known as tropical spastic paraparesis or HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (2Gessain A. Barin F. Vernant J.C. Gout O. Maurs L. Calander A. DeThe G. Lancet. 1985; 2: 407-409Abstract PubMed Scopus (2393) Google Scholar). ATL develops in less than 5% of HTLV-1-infected individuals after a long clinical latency of several decades. Cytogenetic studies of leukemic cells from ATL patients and HTLV-1-immortalized lymphocytes have identified diverse chromosomal abnormalities (reviewed in Ref. 3Kao S.-Y. Lemoine J.F. Marriott S.J. Res. Adv. Virol. 2000; 1: 1-12Google Scholar). Although such chromosomal changes are common in HTLV-1-transformed cells, no consistent abnormalities have been found in all ATL patients (3Kao S.-Y. Lemoine J.F. Marriott S.J. Res. Adv. Virol. 2000; 1: 1-12Google Scholar). In combination with this genetic damage, the long latency associated with HTLV-1-induced leukemogenesis and the small percentage of infected individuals who develop ATL suggest that an accumulation of DNA damage induced by a generalized dysregulation of host DNA replication or repair contributes to neoplastic transformation. The accumulation of DNA damage in HTLV-1-transformed cells has been associated with expression of the viral gene, tax. Cells expressing HTLV-1 Tax display an increased frequency of micronuclei formation (4Majone F. Semmes O.J. Jeang K.-T. Virology. 1993; 193: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Saggioro D. Majone F. Forino M. Turchetto L. Leszl A. Chieco-Bianchi L. Leuk. & Lymphoma. 1994; 12: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that typically results from chromosomal damage. In addition, Tax expression has been associated with an increased mutation frequency of the cellular genome (6Miyake H. Suzuki T. Hirai H. Yoshida M. Virology. 1999; 253: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The ability of Tax to suppress cellular DNA repair may provide the basis for both of these effects. Tax represses expression of human β-polymerase (7Jeang K.-T. Widen S.G. Semmes O.J. Wilson S.H. Science. 1990; 247: 1082-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), an important enzyme involved in base excision repair, suggesting that Tax may interfere with this DNA repair pathway. Recently, Tax has been shown to suppress directly both nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (8Kao S.-Y. Marriott S.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4299-4304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Philpott S.M. Buehring G.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), further supporting a role for Tax in the genome instability observed in HTLV-1-infected cells. Tax is an activator of viral and cellular transcription and has been shown to transactivate the human proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) promoter (10Ressler S. Morris G.F. Marriott S.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of Tax to suppress NER correlates with its ability to activate PCNA gene expression (8Kao S.-Y. Marriott S.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4299-4304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCNA, an essential protein expressed in all proliferating eukaryotic cells, is a cofactor of DNA polymerase δ and plays crucial roles in DNA replication, DNA repair, and chromatin assembly (for review, see Ref.11Kelman Z. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The effect of PCNA on DNA replication and repair is coupled through a complex pathway involving cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), and p21. PCNA can directly bind to cyclin D1 and p21 (12Flores-Rozas H. Kelman Z. Dean F.B. Pan Z.-Q. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). p21 (Cip1, Waf1, and Sdi1), a potent inhibitor of cdk activity whose expression is regulated by p53 (15El-Deiry W.S.

Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3141) Google Scholar), is an important regulator of cellular DNA repair and cell cycle progression. Following DNA damage, p21 expression is activated by p53. p21 then associates with PCNA and inhibits the ability of PCNA to stimulate DNA replication without interfering with PCNA-dependent DNA repair (17Li R. Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 371: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 18Luo Y. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Nature. 1995; 375: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of the p21·PCNA complex is important, as overexpression of PCNA promotes nucleotide misincorporation as well as incorporation of a nucleotide analog by polymerase δ (19Mozzherin D.J. McConnell M. Jasko M.V. Krayevsky A.A. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31711-31717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Mozzherin D.J.

Thus, excess PCNA appears to overcome the p21 block of DNA replication, thereby allowing DNA polymerase δ synthesis past template lesions and promoting the introduction of non-template mutations. p53 is an important regulator of cellular genome stability and an inducer of apoptotic cell death. Loss or inactivation of p53 has been causally associated with oncogenic transformation (21Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 181-205PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations within the p53 gene in HTLV-1-transformed cells are not observed as frequently as in other types of tumors (22Cereseto A. Diella F. Mulloy J.C. Cara A. Michieli P. Grassmann R. Franchini G. Klotman M.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that p53 may be inactivated by alternative means during HTLV-1 transformation. Tax can inactivate p53 through several pathways, including repression of p53 transcription (23Uittenbogaard M.N. Giebler H.A. Reisman D. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28503-28506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and inactivation of p53 transactivation ability (22Cereseto A. Diella F. Mulloy J.C. Cara A.

Inactivation of p53 function by Tax occurs by inducing p53 phosphorylation (27Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6348-6355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), competition for CBP binding (28Ariumi Y. Kaida A. Lin J.Y. Hirota M. Masui O. Yamaoka S. Taya Y. Shimotohno K.

We previously demonstrated that overexpression of PCNA induced by Tax inhibited DNA repair and allowed DNA replication in the presence of DNA damage (8Kao S.-Y. Marriott S.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4299-4304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kao S.-Y. Lemoine F.J. Marriott S.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2240-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated the role of p53 in the suppression of DNA repair by Tax. The results demonstrated that p53 and its downstream target, p21, can both rescue Tax-mediated suppression of NER. Thus, the ability of Tax to inhibit p53 function and its ability to activate PCNA gene expression both contribute to Tax suppression of NER. pCMV-Tax, pMSV-Luc, and pcDNA-PCNA have been described previously (10Ressler S. Morris G.F. Marriott S.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pCMVp21SDI1/HA is an HA-tagged wild-type p21 expression vector, and pCMVp21SDI1/HAΔ142–147 is an HA-tagged p21 expression vector containing a deletion mutation in the PCNA binding domain. Both p21 plasmids were received from James Smith (Baylor College of Medicine) (32Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17060-17063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and are designated here as wt p21 and mt p21, respectively. p53-LTRA and p53-LTRV are wild-type and mutant p53 expression vectors, respectively. Both p53 plasmids were received from G. Lozano (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston) (33Raycroft L. Wu H.Y. Lozano G. Science. 1990; 249: 1049-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), and are designated here as wt p53 and mt p53, respectively. The luciferase reporter, pG13pyLuc, contains 13 copies of a consensus p53-responsive element and was provided by John Brady (NCI, National Institutes of Health). CREF cell lines have been described previously (8Kao S.-Y. Marriott S.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4299-4304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type and p53-deficient mouse fibroblast cells were received from L. A. Donehower (Baylor College of Medicine) (34Donehower L.A. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (3988) Google Scholar). One million cells were lysed in 1 ml of SDS sample buffer. Fifty microliters of the lysates were electrophoresed in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) and probed with either an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), an anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody (PC-10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), an anti-Tax polyclonal antibody (35Lydy S.L. Conner M.E. Marriott S.J. Virology. 1998; 250: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), or an anti-p53 polyclonal antibody (Ab-7, Oncogene Science). Immunoreactivity was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The expression of α-actin was used as an internal loading control and was detected using an anti-actin polyclonal antibody (20–33, Sigma). Asynchronously growing CREF-Neo and CREF-Tax cells were trypsinized, and 1 × 106 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 2 ml of 0.9% NaCl. The cells were fixed in 5 ml of 95% ethanol. DNA content was analyzed by staining with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) and RNase A treatment, followed by flow cytometric analysis (Epic Profile, Coulter Co). The pMSV-Luc reporter plasmid was damaged in vitro by exposure to 1000 J/m2 of UV-C light using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). CREF cells were transfected with 4 μg of UV-irradiated or non-irradiated pMSV-Luc plasmid, together with an undamaged CAT reporter plasmid (pSV2-CAT) and other test plasmids. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and resuspended in 400 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The cell pellet was disrupted by a single freeze-thaw cycle. For the luciferase assay, 25 μl of the total cellular extract was added to 50 μl of luciferase substrate (Promega). Luciferase activity was quantitated in a Turner TD-20e luminometer. CAT assays were performed by a single phase-extraction assay using 25 μl of the total cellular extract as described previously (10Ressler S. Morris G.F. Marriott S.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized to CAT activity of the same extract. Repair activity was calculated by setting normalized luciferase activity from cells cotransfected with non-irradiated pMSV-Luc and test plasmids to 100%. The repair activity of duplicate cells cotransfected with irradiated pMSV-Luc and identical test plasmids was reported as a percentage of that activity. HeLa cells were grown in 60-mm dishes and transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with a total of 14 μg of DNA, which included pSV2-CAT plasmid, pG13pyLuc reporter plasmid, wt p53 or mt p53 expression vectors, and/or pCMV-Tax. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and resuspended in 400 μl of reporter lysis buffer. Luciferase and CAT assays were then performed as described above. The luciferase activity was normalized to CAT activity of the same extract. The normalized luciferase activity of cells transfected with the pG13pyLuc alone was set to “1,” and fold activation of the remaining samples was calculated accordingly. Statistic calculations were performed with MINITAB for Windows software (Minitab Inc.). All error bars presented represent the statistical results from more than three independent experiments. We have previously shown that the HTLV-1 Tax protein suppresses cellular NER and that this activity correlates with its ability to activate transcription from the PCNA promoter (8Kao S.-Y. Marriott S.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4299-4304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the effect of Tax on the PCNA promoter results in increased endogenous PCNA protein expression in CREF cells, a Tax expression plasmid was transfected into CREF cells, and PCNA protein levels were measured by Western blot (Fig.1 A). The expression of cellular PCNA increased 2.6-fold above basal level (compare lanes 1 and 4) following introduction of 1 μg of Tax expression plasmid. This result correlates well with our previous finding that Tax activates the PCNA promoter. Cells overexpressing PCNA following Tax transfection also showed reduced DNA repair (data not shown) as described previously (8Kao S.-Y. Marriott S.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4299-4304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCNA expression in normal cells fluctuates about 2.7-fold throughout the cell cycle with maximal levels being observed in late G1 and early S phases (36Bravo R. Celis J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 127: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is possible that the observed increase in PCNA expression described above is a result of Tax altering cell cycle progression, such that a greater proportion of cells are in G1 and early S phases of the cell cycle and therefore display elevated PCNA protein levels. To test this possibility, the effect of Tax expression on cell cycle progression was examined. The cell cycle distribution patterns of CREF cells stably expressing Tax (CREF-Tax) and control cells (CREF-Neo) were analyzed (Fig. 1 B). The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was similar both in the presence (G1, 58.1%; S, 22.5%; and G2/M, 19.9% in CREF-Tax) and in the absence (G1, 59.2%; S, 21.3%; and G2/M, 19.5% in CREF-Neo) of Tax. Therefore, Tax expression does not grossly alter cell cycle distribution. This result suggests that the elevated PCNA protein levels observed in cells expressing Tax does not result from an indirect effect of Tax on cell cycle progression but rather from activation of the PCNA promoter. The tumor suppressor p53 is an important regulator of genome stability and is required for efficient repair of DNA damage by NER (37Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28073-28080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 38Smith M.L. Chen I.-T. Zhan Q. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1053-1095PubMed Google Scholar). p53 expression is stimulated in the presence of DNA damage and functions to transcriptionally activate expression of p21 as well as other cellular genes. p21 then binds PCNA to block DNA replication and stimulate DNA repair. The ability of Tax to inhibit p53 function (25Mulloy J.C. Kislyakova T. Cereseto A. Casareto L. LoMonico A. Fullen J. Lorenzi M.V. Cara A. Nicot C. Giam C.Z. Franchini G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8852-8860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pise-Masison C.A. Choi K.S. Radonovich M. Dittmer J. Kim S.J. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that downstream genes may not be properly regulated in Tax-expressing cells. These effects, in combination with Tax activation of PCNA expression, could coordinately interfere with DNA repair and stimulate the replication of damaged DNA. To examine the effect of p53 overexpression on NER activity suppressed by Tax, DNA repair was measured using a host cell reactivation (HCR) assay (Fig. 2). A reporter plasmid (pMSV-Luc) was UV-irradiated, or mock-treated, and then transfected into CREF cells either with or without p53 and Tax expression plasmids. Since UV-induced lesions provide a strong block to transcription, expression of the UV-irradiated luciferase reporter reflects the repair activity of these cells. As observed previously, Tax alone suppressed NER to about 50% that observed in cells transfected with the backbone vector control, pSV2-neo. This effect was dose-dependent and correlated with induction of PCNA gene expression following Tax transfection into p53+ cells as previously reported (8Kao S.-Y. Marriott S.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4299-4304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cotransfection of a wt p53 expression plasmid (p53-LTRA) into CREF cells resulted in a dose-dependent rescue of NER activity suppressed by Tax. The effect of wt p53 on NER was specific since a p53 mutant, p53-LTRV (alanine 146 to valine), which is defective in transactivation activity did not restore DNA repair activity. A previous study demonstrated that the rate of point mutation accumulation in wild-type and p53-deficient mouse fibroblasts was indistinguishable (39Sands A.T. Suraokar M.B. Sanchez A. Marth J.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8517-8521Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This result supports the existence of one or more cellular mechanisms for DNA repair in the absence of p53. Therefore, we wished to confirm that the suppression of DNA repair by Tax involves a p53-dependent pathway. p53-deficient fibroblasts were used to determine whether Tax could interfere with DNA repair in cells that were already lacking p53 (Fig.3). Consistent with previous studies, the p53−/− fibroblasts retained partial DNA repair activity as compared with p53+/+ fibroblasts. Tax expression did not significantly affect repair activity of p53 null cells suggesting that Tax does not interfere with p53-independent DNA repair pathways. Transfection of wild-type p53 or p21 resulted in increased DNA repair activity in the p53 null fibroblasts. However, cotransfection of wild-type p53 together with Tax into p53 null fibroblasts resulted in reduced DNA repair activity similar to the endogenous activity observed in p53 null cells and in cells transfected with Tax alone. These results demonstrate that the suppression of DNA repair by Tax involves a p53-dependent DNA repair pathway. The results above suggest that Tax may interfere with a downstream effector of p53. Since Tax has been shown to inactivate endogenous p53 function, it was possible that the inhibition of DNA repair by Tax involved a direct effect on p53 transcriptional activity. To examine this possibility we tested the effect of Tax on p53 transactivation of a p53 responsive promoter (pG13pyLUC) in a transient transfection assay. Introduction of wt p53 resulted in a 40-fold activation of pG13pyLUC, whereas the transactivation defective p53 mutant and Tax each failed to activate this p53-dependent reporter (Fig.4). Cotransfection of Tax with wt p53 resulted in a 4-fold reduction in transcriptional activity of the p53 responsive reporter as previously reported by others (25Mulloy J.C. Kislyakova T. Cereseto A. Casareto L. LoMonico A. Fullen J. Lorenzi M.V. Cara A. Nicot C. Giam C.Z. Franchini G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8852-8860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pise-Masison C.A. Choi K.S. Radonovich M. Dittmer J. Kim S.J. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, increasing amounts of wt p53 with a constant amount of Tax resulted in increased pG13pyLUC activity reaching a maximum of approximately 30-fold at 8 μg of wt p53. Mutant p53 did not activate pG13pyLUC in the presence of Tax. Thus, transfected p53 is capable of activating a p53-dependent promoter in the presence of Tax, albeit at levels reduced from normal. These results suggest that the rescue of DNA repair upon transfection of p53 (observed in Fig. 2) could result from transcriptional activation of downstream p53-dependent genes. p53 has multiple activities including protein interaction and transcriptional activation. Transcriptional activation of downstream cellular genes by p53 is important for maintaining genome stability. The p53 mutant p53-LTRV is a temperature-sensitive mutant that is inactive at 37 °C, but at 32 °C it regains transcriptional activity. To determine whether the transactivation function of p53 contributes to its ability to rescue DNA repair suppressed by Tax, the effect of mt p53 on DNA repair activity was tested in CREF cells at permissive and non-permissive temperatures. At 37 °C, the non-permissive temperature, mutant p53 did not rescue cellular NER suppressed by Tax (Fig. 5,left panel). However, when incubated at 32 °C, the permissive temperature at which mt p53 regains transactivation activity, NER activity suppressed by Tax was restored to levels observed with wt p53 (Fig. 5, right panel). Cotransfection of a luciferase reporter containing p53 responsive elements (pG13pyLuc) under the same conditions demonstrated that mt p53 was transcriptionally active at 32 °C but not at 37 °C (data not shown). Thus, a p53-dependent gene(s) appears to play a role in the rescue of DNA repair suppressed by Tax. Since the suppression of DNA repair by Tax appears to involve a p53-dependent pathway, we next investigated whether a downstream target of p53 is involved in suppression of DNA repair by Tax. Following DNA damage, p53 activates transcription of several downstream genes including p21 (15El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7869) Google Scholar). p21 is an important modulator of NER, facilitating the repair of UV-induced DNA damage (40Sheikh M.S. Chen Y.Q. Smith M.L. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1875-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) by binding to other regulatory proteins. Specifically, p21 binds to PCNA causing a shift in activity of the complex from DNA replication to DNA repair. A C-terminal truncation mutant of p21, which lacks the PCNA-interacting domain, fails to stimulate DNA repair in p21 null cells (41McDonald E.R. Wu G.S. Waldman T. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2250-2255PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, p21-dependent DNA repair activity requires PCNA binding and likely involves sequestration of free PCNA. We propose that in the presence of excess PCNA (due to Tax activation) there is insufficient p21 to sequester sufficiently PCNA, and DNA repair cannot proceed. This effect is compounded by the inactivation of p53 function by Tax. To test this possibility, p21 and Tax expression plasmids were cotransfected into CREF cells. As seen previously, Tax suppressed NER to about 50% that observed in the absence of Tax. The addition of wt p21 (pCMVp21SDI1/HA) resulted in partial rescue of NER activity suppressed by Tax in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.6). Following transfection of a p21 mutant that lacks the PCNA binding domain (pCMVp21SDI1/HAΔ142–147), DNA repair activity did not differ significantly from that observed in cells expressing Tax alone. The inability of this p21 mutant to restore cellular NER suggests that the rescue of NER by p21 requires its association with PCNA. Analysis of transfected wt and mt p21 by immunoblot showed the expected dose-dependent expression (Fig. 6, bottom). Consistent Tax expression was observed in all cells transfected with the Tax expression vector, and actin expression was monitored to confirm equivalent loading. NER is a major cellular defense against the carcinogenic effect of UV irradiation. NER removes UV-induced DNA damage as well as bulky lesions caused by a variety of other genotoxic agents (42Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 283-288Google Scholar). Various types of genetic defects in NER are found in individuals with inherited syndromes that predispose them to cancer such as xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy (for review see Ref. 43Wood R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 135-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Viral transforming proteins have also been shown to suppress NER. Hepatitis B virus X protein associates with a human homolog of UV-damaged DNA-binding protein, resulting in suppression of NER (44Becker S.A. Lee T.H. Butel J.S. Slagle B.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 266-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human papillomavirus virus E6 protein has been shown to suppress NER by inactivation of p53 (45Ford J.M. Baron E.L. Hanawalt P.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 599-603PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study we also demonstrated that HTLV-1 Tax protein disrupts NER (8Kao S.-Y. Marriott S.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4299-4304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the suppression of cellular DNA repair may be a common feature by which oncogenic viruses transform cells. In addition to its ability to suppress cellular DNA repair (8Kao S.-Y. Marriott S.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4299-4304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Philpott S.M. Buehring G.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), Tax expression has been associated with an increase in cellular DNA mutations (4Majone F. Semmes O.J. Jeang K.-T. Virology. 1993; 193: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Saggioro D. Majone F. Forino M. Turchetto L. Leszl A. Chieco-Bianchi L. Leuk. & Lymphoma. 1994; 12: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Miyake H. Suzuki T. Hirai H. Yoshida M. Virology. 1999; 253: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These effects of Tax may play important roles in Tax-mediated transformation. Although several lines of evidence demonstrate the suppression of cellular DNA repair by Tax, the mechanism of this suppression has not been fully defined. In previous studies, we have shown that the suppression of NER by Tax correlates with its ability to activate PCNA gene expression and that PCNA overexpression, in the absence of Tax, suppresses DNA repair activity (8Kao S.-Y. Marriott S.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4299-4304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current study extends these findings by demonstrating that the suppression of DNA repair by Tax also involves disruption of the p53-p21 damage response pathway. It is currently believed that the presence of DNA damage induces p53, which in turn activates p21 expression. p21 associates with PCNA to block its replication function, allowing cells to repair DNA damage. However, in cells expressing Tax, the p53 transactivation function is inhibited (25Mulloy J.C. Kislyakova T. Cereseto A. Casareto L. LoMonico A. Fullen J. Lorenzi M.V. Cara A. Nicot C. Giam C.Z. Franchini G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8852-8860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pise-Masison C.A. Choi K.S. Radonovich M. Dittmer J. Kim S.J. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite Tax inhibition of p53 function, overexpression of p53 in this study restored NER activity suppressed by Tax. Two different mechanisms have been proposed through which Tax may inactivate p53 function. First, p53 and Tax have been shown to mutually repress one another by competing for cellular CBP binding (30Gartenhaus R.B. Wang P. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1995; 9: 2082-2086PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of wt p53 may out-compete Tax for CBP binding, resulting in activation of p53-dependent promoters. Alternatively, Tax has been shown to stimulate p53 phosphorylation through an NF-κB dependent mechanism resulting in inhibition of p53 function. The presence of elevated p53 in our study may provide excess substrate for this reaction, resulting in active p53. These possibilities are testable and will be the focus of future studies. The inhibition of p53 function by Tax appears to contribute to Tax suppression of DNA repair, as overexpression of transcriptionally active p53 rescued repair activity in this study. These results suggest that the inactivation of p53 and subsequently its downstream targets play important roles in Tax suppression of DNA repair. Our demonstration that p21 overexpression restores DNA repair activity suppressed by Tax (Fig. 6) suggests that p21 levels in Tax-expressing cells are insufficient for p21 to regulate DNA repair. We hypothesize that the inactivation of p53 transactivation function in Tax-expressing cells results in reduced p21 expression and, subsequently, free PCNA which can stimulate DNA replication and suppress DNA repair. Thus, the ability of Tax to inhibit p53 function and to activate PCNA expression combine to overcome the normal inhibitory effect of p21 on DNA replication in the presence of DNA damage. Interestingly, Tax has been shown to activate directly expression from the p21 promoter (22Cereseto A. Diella F. Mulloy J.C. Cara A. Michieli P. Grassmann R. Franchini G. Klotman M.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We were unable to confirm Tax transactivation of endogenous p21 levels in CREF cells, so at this time we cannot determine whether direct activation of the p21 promoter plays a role in Tax suppression of NER. However, Tax did not activate a p21 promoter construct driving CAT expression in these cells (data not shown), and transient p21 expression was able to rescue Tax suppression of DNA repair (Fig. 6), suggesting that p21 levels are not significantly elevated in these cells. Through its effects on p53, p21, and PCNA, Tax interferes with DNA repair and allows cells to replicate in the presence of DNA damage. Reduced DNA repair capacity and replication of damaged DNA promotes fixation of mutations in the genome and increases the chances of cellular transformation, a phenomenon previously known as the mutator phenotype (46Loeb L.A. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3075-3079PubMed Google Scholar). These effects are consistent with the presence of chromosomal abnormalities in HTLV-1-transformed cells and may explain the small percentage of infected individuals who progress to disease and the long period of clinical latency prior to the onset of disease.

https://openalex.org/W2069426158,"In activated neutrophils NADPH oxidase is regulated through various signaling intermediates, including heterotrimeric G proteins, kinases, GTPases, and phospholipases. ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) describes a family of GTPases associated with phospholipase D (PLD) activation. PLD is implicated in NADPH oxidase activation, although it is unclear whether activation of PLD by ARF is linked to receptor-mediated oxidase activation. We explored whether ARF participates in NADPH oxidase activation by formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP) and whether this involves PLD. Using multicolor forward angle light scattering analyses to measure superoxide production in differentiated neutrophil-like PLB-985 cells, we tested enhanced green fluorescent fusion proteins of wild-type ARF1 or ARF6, or their mutant counterparts. The ARF6(Q67L) mutant defective in GTP hydrolysis caused increased superoxide production, whereas the ARF6(T27N) mutant defective in GTP binding caused diminished responses to fMLP. The ARF1 mutants had no effect on fMLP responses, and none of the ARF proteins affected phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-elicited oxidase activity. PLD inhibitors 1-butanol and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, or the ARF6(N48R) mutant assumed to be defective in PLD activation, blocked fMLP-elicited oxidase activity in transfected cells. The data suggest that ARF6 but not ARF1 modulates receptor-mediated NADPH oxidase activation in a PLD-dependent mechanism. Because PMA-elicited NADPH oxidase activation also appears to be PLD-dependent, but ARF-independent, ARF6 and protein kinase C may act through distinct pathways, both involving PLD."
https://openalex.org/W2078834369,"Endocytosis of agonist-activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is required for both resensitization and recycling to the cell surface as well as lysosomal degradation. Thus, this process is crucial for regulation of receptor signaling and cellular responsiveness. Although many GPCRs internalize into clathrin-coated vesicles in a dynamin-dependent manner, some receptors, including the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR), can also exhibit dynamin-independent internalization. We have identified five amino acids, located in the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains and the third intracellular loop, that are essential for agonist-induced M2 mAChR internalization via a dynamin-independent mechanism in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells. Substitution of these residues into the M1 mAChR, which does not internalize in these cells, is sufficient for conversion to the internalization-competent M2 mAChR phenotype, whereas removal of these residues from the M2 mAChR blocks internalization. Cotransfection of a dominant-negative isoform of dynamin has no effect on M2mAChR internalization. An internalization-incompetent M2mutant that lacks a subset of the necessary residues can still internalize via a G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 and β-arrestin-dependent pathway. Furthermore, internalization is independent of the signal transduction pathway that is activated. These results identify a novel motif that specifies structural requirements for subtype-specific dynamin-independent internalization of a GPCR."

To date, three AVP receptor subtypes (V1a, V1b, and V2) have been cloned and characterized according to their tissue distribution and functional properties. The V2 receptor subtype is predominantly expressed in the kidney, mediating the antidiuretic effects of AVP. The activated V2 receptor couples to the heterotrimeric G protein Gs and activates adenylyl cyclases (1Birnbaumer L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3304-3310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and can be pharmacologically differentiated by their binding affinities to various AVP agonists and antagonists (4Baertschi A.J.

Hashimoto S. Kawashima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27088-27092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the V1a receptor is expressed in different neuronal and nonneuronal tissues. In nonneuronal tissues, the V1a receptor induces a wide range of physiological effects such as contraction of vascular smooth muscles, stimulation of hepatic glycogenolysis and cell proliferation (for a review, see Refs. 7Howl J. Wheatley M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and8Barberis C. Morin D. Durroux T. Mouillac B. Guillon G. Seyer M. Hibert M. Tribollet E. Manning M. Drug News Perspect. 1999; 12: 279-292Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). By binding to GPCRs, many hormones and neurotransmitters activate various subtypes of the phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) (9Exton J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to the two second messenger molecules, diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. While diacylglycerol stimulates the activity of protein kinase C and Ca2+influx, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binds to receptors in the endoplasmatic reticulum leading to the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores and increases the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). The activity of most PLC-β isozymes is regulated by G protein α-subunits of the Gq family (αq, α11, α14, α15/16). Thus, hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and the subsequent increase in [Ca2+]i mediated by receptors coupling to G proteins of the Gq family are not inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX). However, in some cell types, e.g.cells of the hematopoietic origin, the receptor-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i can be blocked by pretreatment of the cells with PTX (10Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M. Biochem.

Nevertheless, PLC-β1, -β3, and -β4 are preferentially activated by the α subunits of the Gq family (14Jhon D.-Y. Lee H.-H. Park D. Lee C.-W. Lee K.-H. Yoo O.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

In most of the cell lines studied, the AVP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i involves coupling of the V1areceptor to the PTX-insensitive G proteins Gq and G11 and subsequent activation of PLC-β (19Wange R.L.

Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, which are derived from embryonic mouse cells, endogenously express several GPCRs for neuropeptides such as bradykinin, bombesin, or AVP and, therefore, have widely been used to study intracellular signal transduction pathways induced by neuropeptides. In addition, these cells provide a useful model to study the regulation of cell growth. Swiss 3T3 cells express the V1a receptor subtype (21Serradeil-Le Gal C. Bourrie B. Raufaste D. Carayon P. Garcia C. Maffrand J.P. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 633-641PubMed Google Scholar). Using the technique of photoaffinity labeling of receptor-activated Gα subunits with the GTP analog [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide (aaGTP), it has been shown that the AVP receptor in Swiss 3T3 cells activates Gqand G11. No activation of Gi by AVP was detected in this study (22Offermanns S. Heiler E. Spicher K. Schultz G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These results are in accordance with other studies showing that the AVP-induced activation of PLC-β through the V1a receptor in various cell systems is insensitive to pretreatment of the cells with PTX (for a review, see Ref. 23Thibonnier M. Berti-Mattera L.N. Dulin N. Conarty D.M. Mattera R. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 119: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, AVP-induced stimulation of DNA synthesis has been reported to be partially sensitive to PTX (24Taylor C.W. Blakeley D.M. Corps A.N. Berridge M.J. Brown K.D. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 917-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that the V1areceptor subtype principally is able to couple to PTX-sensitive G proteins in these cells. Remarkably, AVP-induced 3H-labeled inositol phosphate formation was also inhibited by 23% by PTX pretreatment of the Swiss 3T3 cells in that study. Herein, we studied the functional coupling of the AVP receptors in Swiss 3T3 cells to G proteins leading to the release of calcium from intracellular stores. We will provide evidence that AVP-evoked calcium release is mediated solely by the V1a receptor subtype and that coupling of these receptors to Gi3 and Gq/11 is dependent on the cell cycle.

Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air at 37 °C. Pretreatment with PTX was performed by adding 100 ng/ml to the culture medium for 24 h prior to experiments. For measurement of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and for photoaffinity labeling of G proteins, cells were cultured until they reached confluence. Before processing for experiments, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 6 h either in fresh DMEM containing 10% FCS (proliferating cells) or DMEM without FCS (quiescent cells). Synchronization of cell growth in individual phases of the cell cycle was performed with exponentially growing Swiss 3T3 using the following protocols. For G0/G1 phase, cells were washed with PBS and cultured in DMEM without FCS for 12 h, cultured another 16 h in fresh medium containing 10% FCS (G0/G1 cells) and were detached from the culture flask with Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer (118 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). For G1/S phase, aphidicolin (5 μg/ml) was added to freshly changed culture medium (+10% FCS), and cells were detached 20 h later with Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer. For G2/M phase, nocodazole (500 ng/ml) was added to freshly changed culture medium (+10% FCS), and synchronized cells were detached from the culture flask 20 h later by gentle shaking. Control cells were maintained in culture medium containing 10% FCS (proliferating cells). For membrane preparation, Swiss 3T3 cells were washed twice with PBS; scraped off the tissue culture flask; resuspended in ice-cold buffer consisting of 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mmKH2PO4; and homogenized by nitrogen cavitation. Membranes were then sedimented at 100,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in 10 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.4). Protein concentration was determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and membranes were stored at −70 °C until they were used. For analysis of cell cycle progression, samples of differently cultured cells were treated with ice-cold ethanol. Cell nuclei were sedimented by centrifugation, stained with propidium iodide in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS supplemented with RNase (25 μg/100 μl), and counted according to the DNA amount using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton-Dickinson FACScan, Heidelberg, FRG). Cells with an unreplicated complement of DNA (2n) were assigned to G0/G1 phase, cells with a fully replicated complement of DNA (4n) were assigned to the G2/M phase, and those cells containing an intermediate amount of DNA were assigned to the G1/S phase. Synthesis of [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide and photoaffinity labeling of receptor-activated G proteins were performed as described (26Offermanns S. Schultz G. Rosenthal W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 286-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of G proteins, photolabeled membranes were solubilized in 40 μl of 2% (w/v) SDS, and 120 μl of precipitation buffer (1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 1% (w/v) desoxycholate, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) was added. Thirty μl of an antiserum specific for Gαq/11 (AS 370) or 20 μl of an antiserum against all three isoforms of Gαi (AS 266) were added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added for 1 h, pelleted by centrifugation, and washed twice with 1 ml of buffer A (1% (w/v) Nonidet-P40, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 600 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and twice with 1 ml of buffer B (300 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Samples were subjected to standard SDS-PAGE, and dried gels were analyzed for radioactivity with a phosphor imager (Fuji BAS 1000, Raytest, München, FRG). Quantitative analysis of the digitized gel images was performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet). The values are given as arbitrary units. Swiss 3T3 cells were grown on glass coverslips until they reached 50–70% confluence in culture medium containing 10% FCS. The cells were microinjected with phosphorothioate oligonucleotides 48 h prior to measurement of cytosolic Ca2+ and then serum-starved as described. Sequence specificity for the individual G protein α-subunits of oligonucleotides used in this study were optimized by sequence comparison and multiple alignment using MACMOLLY TETRA software (Softgene, Berlin, FRG). Approximately 10–20 fl of a solution containing 30–50 μm oligonucleotides dissolved in 100 mm KCl was injected into the nuclei of individual cells. Microinjection was performed with a manual injection system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, FRG) using microcapillaries pulled from borosilicate glass tubes with filament (outlet diameter of 0.5 μm). To facilitate localization of injected cells, coverslips were imprinted with squares, and Texas Red-conjugated bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml) was added to the injection solution. Only cells within the square were injected, and cells on the same coverslip outside the square were used as control cells. The following oligonucleotide sequences were used: anti-αq11.2s, ATGGACTCCAGAGT; anti-αi-common, GCCGCCTTGTCCTG; anti-αi1, TGTCCTTCCACAGTCTCTTTATG; anti-αi2, ATGGTCAGCCCAGAGCCTCCGG; anti-αi3, CATCTCGCCATAAACGTTTAATC; sense-αq/11.2 s, ACTCTGGAGTCCAT; sense-αi3, GATTAAACGTTTATGGCGAGATG; missense-αq/11.2 s, TGAGACCTCAGGTA; missense-αi3, CTAATTTGCAAATACCGCCGCTCTAC. For microinjection of antibodies, polyclonal antisera against Gαq/11 (AS 370), Gαi-common (AS 86), or Gαz (AS 404) were diluted 1:100 in injection solution (100 mm KCl, 5 mg/ml Texas Red-conjugated bovine serum albumin) and injected into the cytoplasm of individual cells 1 h prior to measurement of [Ca2+]i. Cells grown on coverslips were washed twice with PBS and fixed with acetone for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were additionally washed three times with PBS containing 3% FCS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal rabbit antisera either against Gαq/11 (AS 370) or against all three isoforms of Gαi (AS 266). Both antisera were used in a dilution of 1:100 in PBS containing 3% FCS. Following four washes with PBS, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat antibody against rabbit IgG (1:1000). Cells were washed four times with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and mounted with Moviol (Hoechst, Frankfurt, FRG). Images of the stained cells were obtained with an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100; Zeiss, Oberkochen, FRG) connected to a digital video imaging system (T.I.L.L. Photonics, München, FRG) using monochromatic light at 495 nm and an exposure time of 1 s. Quantitative analysis of the digitized images of the control and injected cells was performed on a Macintosh computer using NIH Image. The significance of the results was determined using aU test, errors are given as S.E., and the values are given as arbitrary units. For measurement of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in suspension, cells were detached from tissue culture flasks, resuspended in serum-free DMEM, and loaded with 5 μm fura-2/AM for 20 min at 37 °C. Fura-2-loaded cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 300 × g and resuspended at a concentration of 4 × 105 cells/ml in incubation buffer consisting of 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.3 mmKH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 1.5 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4. Aliquots (2 ml) of the cell suspension were transferred to an acrylic cuvette and stirred continuously, and fluorescence was recorded in a luminescence spectrometer (LS 50 B; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C with dual wavelength excitation of 340 and 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm. Before cells were stimulated with 100 nm AVP, extracellular Ca2+ was chelated by the gradual addition of 20-μl aliquots of Tris/EGTA (20 mm) until a stable base line was reached. For measurement of [Ca2+]i in single cells, cells were grown on glass coverslips and loaded with 5 μm fura-2/AM for 30 min. The cells were washed twice in incubation buffer, mounted on an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 100), and washed with incubation buffer supplemented with 1 mm EGTA instead of CaCl2. Determination of [Ca2+]i in individual cells was performed with an imaging system (T.I.L.L. Photonics) as described (27Dippel E. Kalkbrenner F. Wittig B. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i values were calculated using a formula provided by Grynkiewicz et al. (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The Δ[Ca2+]i was calculated as the difference of maximum [Ca2+]i after stimulation with AVP and basal [Ca2+]i prior to stimulation. The significance of the results was determined using a U test, and errors are given as S.E. Binding assays on Swiss 3T3 membranes were performed in 250 μl of incubation medium (1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mg/ml bacitracin, 0.05 mg/ml soy bean trypsin inhibitor, pH 7.4) containing 1–300 pm of the linear AVP antagonist125I-phenylacetyl-d-Tyr(Me)-Phe-Gln-Asn-Arg-Pro-Arg-Tyr-NH2(PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was performed in duplicate and started by the addition of membranes (5–15 μg/assay), and the mixture was incubated 1 h at 20 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 4 ml of ice-cold buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl, 0.5 mm EDTA), followed by filtration through GF/C glass microfiber filters (Whatmann, Maidstone, UK) presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). Filters were washed four times with 4 ml of ice-cold buffer, and radioactivity was counted in a γ-counter (COBRA 5002, Packard, Meriden, MA). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 3 μm unlabeled AVP. Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The significance of the results was determined using a U test, and errors are given as S.D. Aliquots of membrane preparations of G0/G1 cells and proliferating cells (50 μg each) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide), and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond-C Extra; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nonspecific interactions were blocked overnight at 4 °C with a solution of 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated either with an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody against Gαq/11 (SC-392) or Gαi3 (SC-262) (each 1:400; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by a 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody from goat (1:2500; Sigma). G proteins were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and chemiluminescence signals were quantified with a bioimaging system (Fuji BAS 1000, Raytest, München, FRG). Aliquots of membrane preparations of G0/G1 cells and proliferating cells (100 μg each) and 100 ng of recombinantly expressed RGS5 and RGS16 were subjected to SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide), and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond-C Extra; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nonspecific interactions were blocked overnight at 4 °C with a solution of 3% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 (TTBS). Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated either with polyclonal goat antipeptide antibody against RGS1 (1:500; sc-6210, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), with polyclonal rabbit antipeptide antibody against RGS2 (1:2000; Ref. 29Neill J.D.

Kehrl J.H. Dunn M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 714-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with polyclonal rabbit antibody against recombinantly expressed His-tagged RGS4 (1:2000), with polyclonal rabbit antibody against recombinantly expressed His-tagged RGS5 (1:1000), with goat polyclonal peptide antibody against RGS7 (1:1000; SC-8139, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or with polyclonal rabbit antibody against recombinantly expressed His-tagged RGS16 (1:1000) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by a 2-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2000 in TTBS; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In the case of RGS1, an anti-goat IgG antibody was used. RGS proteins were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In a previous publication, the G protein coupling of the AVP receptor in Swiss 3T3 cells was studied using the technique of photoaffinity labeling of receptor-activated G proteins with aaGTP and subsequent immunoprecipitation of activated G protein α-subunits with subtype-specific antibodies (22Offermanns S. Heiler E. Spicher K. Schultz G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In these experiments, membranes prepared from Swiss 3T3 cells grown under regular cell culture conditions were used, i.e. with change of the medium every second day, and cells were split before confluence was reached. The addition of AVP to the Swiss 3T3 membranes induced activation of both Gαq and Gα11, but no activation of Gαi was detected (22Offermanns S. Heiler E. Spicher K. Schultz G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We used the same technique, but compared membranes from cells grown under various cell culture conditions. The cells were grown in the same medium until they reached confluence for several days, and then the conditioned medium was replaced for 6 h by either fresh culture medium (DMEM) containing 10% FCS (“proliferating cells”) or DMEM devoid of FCS (“quiescent cells”). In membranes prepared from proliferating cells as well as in membranes prepared from quiescent cells, we confirmed the AVP-induced activation of Gαq and Gα11 (Fig. 1 A,lanes 1 and 2, 2470 and 222 arbitrary units, respectively, and lanes 5 and6, 4846 and 1760 arbitrary units, respectively). In membranes prepared from quiescent cells, however, incorporation of aaGTP into Gαq and Gα11 was more prominent in the absence and presence of AVP. In addition, an antibody directed against all three subtypes of the Gαi proteins (AS266) precipitated more aaGTP-labeled αi-subunit in AVP-stimulated membranes than in control membranes (Fig. 1, comparelane 7 with lane 8, 643 and 220 arbitrary units, respectively), indicating the coupling of AVP receptors to Gi proteins. No activation of Giproteins by AVP could be detected in proliferating cells (see in Fig.1, lanes 3 and 4, 557 and 547 arbitrary units, respectively). To address the question whether the AVP-induced activation of Gi proteins in membranes prepared from quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells leads to a functional coupling to an effector system, the AVP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was measured in Swiss 3T3 cell suspensions. The AVP-induced increase of [Ca2+]i was completely abolished by preincubation of the cells with a linear peptide antagonist specific for the V1a receptor [1-(β-mercapto-β,β-cyclopenthamethylene propionic acid),O-Me-Tyr2,Arg8]vasopressin (7Howl J. Wheatley M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Kruszynski M. Lammek B. Manning M. Seto J. Haldar J. Sawyer W.H. J. Med. Chem. 1980; 23: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), indicating that the activation of PLC-β and subsequent increase in [Ca2+]i in Swiss 3T3 cells is mediated solely by the V1a receptor subtype (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows the mean values of the amplitude of the AVP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i (Δ[Ca2+]i) of 3–7 experiments with Swiss 3T3 cells cultured under the described cell culture conditions and pretreated with or without PTX (100 ng/ml for 24 h). In quiescent cells, AVP induced a significant (p < 0.05) higher Ca2+ amplitude than in proliferating cells (Fig. 2, open bars). The basal calcium concentrations were not significantly different under both conditions (data not shown). In proliferating cells, the AVP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was not inhibited by preincubation of the cells with PTX (see Fig. 2). In contrast, pretreatment of quiescent cells with PTX inhibited the AVP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i by 50% (see Fig. 2). To confirm that the dual coupling of the V1a receptor to G proteins of the Gq/11 and the Gi subfamilies is a characteristic of the quiescent state of the cells, we analyzed the AVP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in various phases of the cell cycle. To clearly define the quiescent state of cell growth as G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle in (in the following referred to as G0/G1 cells) we used defined protocols for synchronization of proliferating, subconfluent cells. For arresting the cell growth in the G0/G1 phase, subconfluent cells were serum-starved for 8 h, and then the serum-free medium was replaced by serum-containing medium. Synchrony of cell growth in the G1/S phase of the cell cycle was reached by preincubation of the cells with aphidicolin and in G2/M phase by using nocodazole. The phases of the cell cycle were analyzed by staining the DNA with propidium iodide and measurement of the DNA content by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 3 A). Control cells cultured in medium containing FCS, which was changed every second day, were found to proliferate desynchronously. Sixty-two percent of the cells were in the G0/G1 phase, 26% in the S phase, and 12% in the G2/M phase (see Fig.3 A, a). From the cells that were serum-starved (DMEM without FCS for 12 h and subsequent incubation in medium with 10% FCS for 16 h), 92% were found in the G0/G1 phase, 1% in the S phase, and 4% in the G2/M phase (see Fig. 3 A, b). From the cells treated with aphidicolin (4 μg/ml for 12 h), 75% were found in the G0/G1 phase, 24% in the S phase, and 0.3% in the G2/M phase (see Fig. 3 A,c). From the cells arrested with nocodazole (500 ng/ml for 12 h), 6% were found in the G0/G1 phase, 5% in the S phase, and 88% in the"

An insoluble form of expressed WbpO was purified in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. After refolding, this preparation of WbpO (designated as WbpORf) exhibited stable secondary structure at pH 7.5 to 8.2, and it was enzymatically active. Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry analysis showed that WbpORf catalyzed the conversion of UDP-GalNAc to UDP-GalNAcA. 26 and 22% of the substrate could be converted to UDP-GalNAcA in the presence of NAD+and NADP+ as the cofactors, respectively. TheK m values of WbpORf for UDP-GalNAc, NAD+, and NADP+ were 7.79, 0.65, and 0.44 mm, respectively. WbpORf can also catalyze the conversion of UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-GlcNAcA.

Lam J.S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 243-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 is one of many virulence factors involved in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa, and it is also implicated as the surface antigen interacting with cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein on epithelial cells of healthy individuals (2Pier G.B.

A-band LPS is a common antigen and is composed of trisaccharide repeating units of α-d-rhamnose. B-band LPS O-antigen is serotype-specific. It is composed of a heteropolymer of di- to pentasaccharide repeating units. Due to its importance in virulence and its potential as a vaccine component, LPS in P. aeruginosahas been extensively studied at the molecular level (4Rocchetta H.L. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. Microbiol.

Biochem. 1998; 255: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although the genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of α-d-GalNAcA have been described in a few studies (1Stanislavsky E.S. Lam J.S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 243-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hashimoto Y. Li N. Yokoyama H. Ezaki T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4456-4465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lin W.S. Cunneen T. Lee C.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7005-7016Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the enzyme activities of these gene products have not been elucidated. At present UDP-GalNAcA is not commercially available; therefore, a better understanding of the enzyme involved in the synthesis of this uronic acid sugar would provide the methodology for its production. The sequencing and characterization of the complete cluster ofwbp genes involved in the biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa serotype O6 LPS has recently been accomplished by our laboratory (20Bélanger M. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3505-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Based on homology analysis, one of the genes of the O6 LPS biosynthetic cluster, wbpO, was thought to be an enzyme involved in the synthesis of α-d-GalNAcA. Importantly, a knockout mutant of wbpO is deficient in B-band LPS production (20Bélanger M. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3505-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, WbpO has significant homology to VipA (64% identity), an enzyme presumed to be involved in the formation ofd-GalNAcA molecule of Vi-antigen in S. typhi(18Hashimoto Y. Li N. Yokoyama H. Ezaki T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4456-4465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A wbpO mutant was successfully complemented byvipA, and the production of B-band LPS of P. aeruginosa O6 was fully restored (20Bélanger M. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3505-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This indicated that WbpO and VipA are functional homologues of each other. These observations suggested that WbpO could be a UDP-N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) dehydrogenase that catalyzes the conversion of UDP-GalNAc to UDP-GalNAcA, which may be an intermediate in the synthesis of the α-d-GalNAcA moiety of the B-band O-unit in serotype O6. This study is the first report of the expression, purification, and function identification of an enzyme, WbpO, involved in the synthesis of UDP-GalNAcA. Amino acid homology analysis of WbpO was accomplished by using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) through data base Non-redundant GenBankTM CDS (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Protein motif analysis was performed by using the San Diego Supercomputer Center-Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation data base via the. wbpO was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the following primers. The upstream primer was 5′-TTT GTT ACA TAT GAA GGA TCT GAA GGT TGC A-3′, and the downstream primer was 5′-TAT TAC TCG AGAGAC AGG CGT AGA TCA GAC-3′, which contained NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively. The downstream primer also contained the indicated mutation sites to change the original stop codon TAA to TCT coding serine. This polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into theNdeI and XhoI sites of pET30a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and the sequence encoding His6 tag on pET30a was in frame with wbpO. This construct was transformed into E. coli JM109 by CaCl2transformation (22Huff J.P. Grant B.J. Penning C.A. Sullivan K.F. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 570-577PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on Luria agar (Fisher) containing 30 μg·ml−1 kanamycin. Both strands of DNA were sequenced to confirm the sequence of the clonedwbpO. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strain (Novagen, Madison) was used to express WbpO. It was grown overnight at 37 °C in Terrific Broth (TB) (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A2Google Scholar) medium containing 30 μg·ml−1 kanamycin and 34 μg·ml−1 chloramphenicol with agitation and then inoculated at 2% (v/v) into 300 ml of fresh TB medium and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. Overexpression of the recombinant WbpO was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-O-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3.5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min, and the cell pellet was stored at −20 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (24Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) following the procedure described by the manufacturer (Pierce), and bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. Frozen cell pellet (0.4 g, wet weight) was suspended in 20 ml of suspension buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8) and sonicated on ice for 2 min with Sonicator Ultrasonic Processor XL 2020 (MANDEL Scientific Company Ltd., Guelph, Ontario, Canada). The cell extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet containing the insoluble WbpO was dissolved in 5 ml of suspension buffer with the addition of 6 m guanidine HCl (GdnHCl) and 5 mm imidazole. It was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) on a chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using nickel as a chelating agent, which has high selective binding for proteins with His6 tags, under denaturing conditions. The resin was first charged with 50 mm NiSO4 and then equilibrated with loading buffer (6 m GdnHCl, 5 mm imidazole in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). Crude WbpO in 6 mGdnHCl was loaded 3 times onto a 1.6-cm diameter column containing 3 ml of resin. The column was first washed with 20 bed volumes of loading buffer and then 4 bed volumes of 20 mm imidazole in loading buffer. WbpO was eventually eluted with 4 bed volumes of 200 mm imidazole in loading buffer and subjected to refolding. The refolding of WbpO began with reducing GdnHCl concentration from 6 to 2 m by dilution with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at a rate of 0.5 ml·min−1. At the completion of this step, 5 mm reduced and 1 mm oxidized glutathione were added. A protease inhibitor mixture that contains 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, bestatin, pepstatin A,trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane, andN-(α-rhamnopyranosyloxyhydroxyphosphiny)-Leu-Trp(phosphoramidon) was added. The protein solution was then slowly stirred at 4 °C for 30 h to allow refolding, followed by slow dilution at an extremely low rate of 0.2 ml·min−1 and concentration with ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltration was performed under 50 pounds/square inch N2 in a stir cell with YM3 membrane (Amicon, Sunnyvale, CA) which has a molecular mass cut-off at 3,000 Da. GdnHCl was finally removed by extensive dialysis against 200 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 3 buffer changes. All the purification and refolding procedures were performed between pH 7.5 and 8.0, which is well above the pI 5.8 of WbpO to minimize protein precipitation. Any precipitate observed during the refolding and dilution steps was removed by filtration through a 0.2-μm filter. The supernatant of the cell extract containing the soluble WbpO (WbpOSol) was subjected to purification under native conditions, which was carried out under the same conditions as the purification under denatured condition except that no GdnHCl was present. WbpOsol was eluted with 40–120 mmimidazole and then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The protein fraction in 6 mGdnHCl eluted from IMAC column was diluted to 1 m GdnHCl and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid for analysis with 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Western immunoblotting following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Burnette (26Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5927) Google Scholar) using Penta-HisTM Antibody (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) diluted to 1:1,000 in 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline as the first antibody. CD of WbpO protein was measured with a JASCO J-600 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 20 °C. Secondary structure fractions were tabulated using the JASCO Protein Secondary Structure Estimation Program (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Tokyo, Japan) which is based on the algorithm of Chang et al. (27Chang C.T. Wu C.S. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), and our results were analyzed using the data base of Hennessey and Johnson (28Hennessey Jr., H.P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded between 190 and 250 nm, and three spectra of each sample were obtained and their values averaged. All protein samples were adjusted to 0.3 mg·ml−1 in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and were degassed before scanning. The base line was also corrected with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer. Measurements were performed with a cell path length of 1 mm. Molar ellipticity was expressed in units of degree × cm2 × dmol−1 of amino acid residues. The secondary structure of WbpO based on its amino acid sequence was predicted using data base PredictProtein (29Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme reaction mixture contained 1.0 mm UDP-GalNAc, 2.5 mmβ-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), or β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+), 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.2, in a total volume of 0.1 ml. The reaction was initiated by addition of purified WbpO solution, then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, quenched by boiling for 10 min, and stored at −20 °C for product analysis. Enzyme reaction was monitored by recording the absorbance of the solution at 340 nm which indicates NAD(P)H production. Sugar compositional analysis was performed by high performance anion exchange liquid chromatography (HPAEC) equipped with a pulsed amperometric detector on a Waters 625 LC system (Millipore, Milford, MA). Sugars were separated on a CarboPac PA1 anion exchange column (4 × 250 mm, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) equipped with a PA1 guard column, at a flow rate of 1.0 ml·min−1. Neutral and amino sugars were separated with 14 mm NaOH in the initial 10 min. Acidic sugars were then eluted by an application of a linear salt gradient up to 100 mm NaOH and 150 mm NaOAc within 10 min. The column was maintained in these conditions for 5 min and then washed with 150 mm NaOH for 5 min before being re-equilibrated with 14 mm NaOH for 20 min. The conversion ratio of UDP-GalNAc to UDP-GalNAcA was estimated based on the comparison of peak areas under substrate and product, respectively, from HPAEC. Sugar analysis by CE-MS or CE-MS/MS was performed using a crystal model 310 CE instrument (AYI Unicam, Boston) coupled to an API 3000 mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) via a micro-ion spray interface. The fused silica capillaries used were 192 (outer diameter) × 50 μm (inner diameter) (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ). The separations were obtained on a 90-cm long capillary using 50 mmmorpholine/formate, 5% methanol, pH 9.0, and a voltage of 30 kV was applied. Collision-induced dissociation of selected precursor ions was achieved using nitrogen as collision gas at collision energies of typically 60–70 eV. The enzyme reaction was performed at room temperature in 10 mmammonium acetate, pH 8.5, with a total volume of 100 μl containing sugar (UDP-GalNAc or UDP-GlcNAc), NAD(P)+, WbpORf (0.1–12 μg), and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The K m and V max values of WbpORf were determined based on Michaelis-Menten equations, and the sugar concentrations added ranged from 2 to 40 mm,and the cofactor concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 5 mm. The enzyme reaction is monitored by following the reduction of NAD+ at 340 nm using spectrophotometer (DU® Series 520 spectrophotometer, Beckman Instruments, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), and the initial velocities were measured during the first 30 s after the initiation of the reaction with NAD(P)+. NAD(P)H concentrations were determined using the absorbance at 340 nm with ε340 = 6,220m−1·cm−1. For the determination of the K m value for the cofactors, an excess amount of sugar (40 mm) was used, and the cofactor concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 5 mm. UDP-GalNAc, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-Gal were used as the substrate, respectively, for the determination of the specificity of WbpORf, and the reactions were carried out in the presence of 5 mm NAD+. The enzyme reactions using UDP-GalNAc or UDP-GlcNAc were analyzed by CE-MS/MS to identify the product. Enzyme reactions containing 10 mm final concentration of MgCl2, MnCl2, or KCl in addition to 6 mm UDP-GalNAc, 10 mm NAD+, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.4 μg of enzyme were monitored at 340 nm for 30 min at room temperature. Comparison of the sequence of WbpO (GenBankTM accession number AF 035937) with other proteins in the GenBankTM data base indicated that WbpO has high homology to VipA (64% identity) and CapL (57% identity). VipA is involved in the biosynthesis of S. typhi Vi-antigen, a homopolymer polysaccharide consisting of GalNAcA (18Hashimoto Y. Li N. Yokoyama H. Ezaki T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4456-4465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Waxin H. Virlogeux I. Kolyva S. Popoff M.Y. Res.

Li N. Yokoyama H. Ezaki T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4456-4465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). WbpO showed moderate homology with EpsD, a putative NDP-GalNAcA dehydrogenase inBurkholderia solanacearum, with an identity of 29% (31Huang J. Schell M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It also demonstrated homology with putative UDP-ManNAcA dehydrogenases inMethanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (B7, 32% identity) (32Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H. Dubois J.

Four conserved motifs located at the N terminus of these sequences (Fig.1) were found using San Diego Supercomputer Center/Multiple EM for motif elicitation alignment tool. These motifs also coincide with the conserved secondary structures. Motif-1 contains a GXGXXG consensus (whereX represents any amino acid and G represents glycine) in a βαβ secondary structure, indicating the possible involvement of nucleotide (i.e. NAD+ or NADP+) in the WbpO function. Part of Motif-2 is in β-strand structure conformation, whereas the whole Motif-3 containing 27 amino acids is in α-helical structure. However, Motif-2, -3, and -4 do not correspond to any known functional signature. These alignment results clearly suggest that WbpO could be an enzyme involved in the formation of uronic acid in polysaccharide biosynthesis. Furthermore, complementation data previously obtained by our laboratory demonstrated that the knockout mutant of WbpO could be cross-complemented by VipA from S. typhi to restore the production of B-band LPS in O6 (20Bélanger M. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3505-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All the above evidence led to the assignment of the function of WbpO as a putative UDP-GalNAc dehydrogenase that produces UDP-GalNAcA.Figure 1Alignment of WbpO.

Results from Western immunoblotting with Penta-HisTM Antibody showed a band corresponding to 46 kDa (Fig. 2 B) indicating that the His6 tag was expressed as part of WbpO. A limited amount of WbpO was also present in the non-induced culture (Fig. 2 B,lane 3). Solubility analysis (data not shown) on the expressed protein showed that approximately 90% of the expressed WbpO was found in the cell debris fraction. The purification of soluble form of WbpO by IMAC under native conditions yielded >95% pure WbpO (Fig. 2 A, lane 6), and the same purity of WbpO was also achieved by the purification of the insoluble form with IMAC under denaturing conditions (Fig. 2 A, lane 9). Effective refolding of WbpO required optimization of the ratios of reduced and oxidized glutathione. The final concentrations of 5 and 1 mm of reduced and oxidized glutathione, respectively, were deemed optimal for achieving the highest yield of 2 mg·g−1 cell pellet of WbpO with approximately 99% purity (Fig. 2 A, lane 7). The CD spectrum of WbpOSolshowed a minimum at 208 nm and a shoulder at 220 nm (Fig.3), which are the characteristics of proteins that have an α-helical conformation (36Dahan D. Srikumar R. Laprade R. Coulton J.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 37Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 38Lambert J.B.

The CD spectrum of refolded WbpO (WbpORf) showed different patterns and weaker ellipticities than that of WbpOSol. This suggests a lower percentage of α-helical structure than in WbpOSol, and these results are consistent with the calculations, 29.2% for WbpOsol and 22.0% for WbpORf, respectively, as shown in TableI. WbpORf also showed altered CD spectrum with a minimum circular dichroism signal at 198 nm, which indicated an increased content of β-turn in the secondary structure (39Kahn P.C. Beychok S. J. Am.

We have previously identified an intronic distal downstream enhancer (IDDE) region that is required for neural cell-specific inclusion of N30. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which the IDDE promotes N30 exon usage. In vitro splicing analysis using neural cell nuclear extracts and two-exon pre-mRNA substrates, which consist of the N30 exon and either the upstream (E5) or downstream (E6) exon, demonstrates that the IDDE activates upstream E5-N30 splicing by facilitating early prespliceosome complex formation. The IDDE has no effect on N30-E6 splicing where the IDDE resides. Inspection of splice site consensus sequences shows that a polypyrimidine (Py) tract preceding N30 is suboptimal for U2AF binding. Optimizing the Py tract completely relieves the requirement for the IDDE in E5-N30 splicingin vitro. In transfected cells, the wild-type minigene transcripts, which consist of three exons, E5, N30, and E6, undergo neural cell-specific and IDDE-dependent alternative splicing of N30. Optimizing the Py tract in minigenes also completely relieves the requirement for the IDDE in N30 inclusion. Furthermore, overexpression of the truncated U2AF65, which contains the arginine and serine dipeptide-rich domain and linker domain, but lacks the RNA binding domain, selectively inhibits the IDDE-mediated N30 inclusion in mRNA from the wild-type minigene in a dominant negative fashion. These results support the hypothesis that the IDDE facilitates the recognition of the 3′ splice site preceding N30 by a network of protein-protein interactions implicated in the recruitment of U2AF to a suboptimal Py tract.

Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar and 4MacDougall C. Harbison D. Bownes M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 353-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, however, much less is known about the mechanisms and cellular factors involved in regulated alternative splicing. Studies of vertebrate genes aimed at understanding the regulation of alternative splicing have led to identification of a number of pre-mRNA features that influence alternative splice site selection. These include the sequence of the 5′ and 3′ splice sites, branch point sequence and location, exon size, intron size, and specific RNA sequences (enhancers or repressors) located in exons or introns. Many parameters can affect splicing in ways that are complex and not readily predictable. cis-Acting RNA sequences can enhance or repress utilization of alternative splice sites. Elements that promote splicing of an adjacent splice site are known collectively as splicing enhancers and are classified by their location as exonic or intronic enhancers. Exonic enhancers are often rich in purine residues (5Watakabe A. Tanaka K. Shimura Y. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 6Lavigueur A. La Branche H. Kornblihtt A.R. Chabot B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2405-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 7Lynch K.W. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 284-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These exonic splicing enhancers bind to members of the SR protein family, which contain a characteristic arginine and serine dipeptide repeat (RS)1 domain and RNA binding domains (for review see Refs. 8Fu X.-D. RNA (NY ). 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar and 9Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). For exonic enhancers, which can recruit SR proteins, there is evidence that the enhancer-protein complex functions by stimulating spliceosome assembly at the upstream 3′ splice site. A large number of exons have this enhancer element. Only a few of them, however, appear to be a target for cell type-specific regulation. In addition to exonic enhancers, a number of splicing events are controlled by intronic splicing enhancers (10Black D.L.

These sequences have been found in the introns downstream of small and/or cell type-specific exons, and their presence is required for the splicing of these exons. However, with a few exceptions (16Gallego M.E. Gattoni R. Stévenin J. Marie J. Expert-Bezancon A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1772-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Min H. Chan R.C.

Science. 1998; 280: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), the proteins that mediate enhancer effects remain unidentified. Moreover, how these enhancers affect spliceosome assembly is not known. We have been using the human nonmuscle myosin heavy chain (NMHC)-B gene as a model system to study the regulatory mechanisms responsible for neural cell-specific alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. TheNMHC-B gene encodes a polypeptide of approximately 200 kDa. A dimer of this gene product, together with two pairs of light chains (20 and 17 kDa), constitutes a myosin molecule that demonstrates force-generating ATPase activity when it interacts with actin. TheNMHC-B gene is expressed ubiquitously in most cell types (24Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar); however, in neural cells, specific forms of NMHC-B are generated by cassette-type alternative splicing. NMHC-B has been shown to play an important role in neural cell migration and adhesion in NMHC-B-depleted mice (25Üren D. Hwang H.-K. Hara Y. Takeda K. Kawamoto S. Tullio A.N., Yu, Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Tresser N. Grinberg A. Preston Y.A. Adelstein R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing occurs at two different locations in the pre-mRNA (26Takahashi M. Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17864-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One alternative exon (N30), consisting of a 30-nt coding sequence, is located between the constitutive exons E5 and E6. The 10 amino acids encoded by the N30 exon is located near the ATP-binding region of the molecule and includes a serine residue that has been shown to be phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase and brain-specific cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 (27Pato M.D. Sellers J.R. Preston Y.A. Harvey E.V. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2689-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting a specific role of this isoform in a signal transduction pathway. The other alternative exon, consisting of a 63-nt coding sequence, is located between constitutive exons E15 and E16, which is near the actin-binding region. Inclusion of these two alternative exons is restricted to neural cells in mammals and birds. The two alternative splicing events, however, appear to be regulated differentially by agonist stimulation in cultured neural cells as well as during brain development (28Itoh K. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14533-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have focused on N30 regulation, since some culture systems maintain regulation of N30 splicing (14Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17613-17616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Itoh K. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14533-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that a minigene encompassing E5-N30-E6 reproduced cell type-specific and differentiation state-dependent regulation of N30 inclusion, using a transient minigene transfection system (14Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17613-17616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the previous study established that neural cell-specific N30 inclusion requires a cis-acting intronic enhancer sequence that is located 1.5 kb downstream of exon N30. This intronic enhancer region, 142 nucleotides (nts) in length, is now designated as an intronic distal downstream enhancer (IDDE) region (corresponding to fragment d in Ref. 14Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17613-17616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we attempted to find out how the IDDE promotes N30 exon usage during the splicing reaction usingin vitro splicing and minigene transfection systems. The experimental data shown here support the hypothesis that the IDDE facilitates recognition of the 3′ splice site preceding the N30 exon by a network of protein-protein interactions implicated in the recruitment of U2AF to a suboptimal polypyrimidine (Py) tract. For in vitro splicing substrates, defined portions of the genomic DNA (see Fig.1 C) were amplified and connected by recombinant PCR using the appropriate synthetic primers and were introduced into pBluescriptIISK(−) (Stratagene), which contains the T7 promoter. Unique restriction enzyme sites were engineered at the junctions between the different portions of the genomic DNA.Figure 1Schematic diagrams of the humanNMHC-B gene surrounding alternative exon N30 and the constructs used in this study. A, native gene.Rectangles and horizontal lines in the diagram indicate exons and introns, respectively. E5 and E6 are constitutive exons, and N30 and R18 are alternative exons. Inclusion of R18 in the mRNA is always associated with N30 inclusion. However, N30 inclusion occurs without R18 inclusion, and inclusion of N30 alone is the dominant form of neural mRNA. Inclusion of both N30 and R18 can be found to a small extent in a limited number of neural cell lines but not in neural tissues of animals. The IDDE is located between nts 1544 and 1685 downstream of N30 in the native gene. Exon size and the IDDE are not drawn to scale. B, minigene. Minigenes are constructed by inserting the human NMHC-B genomic DNA fragments indicated into the intron between exons E2 and E3 of the rat preproinsulin gene (PPI). Transcription of the minigene is driven by the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (RSVLTR).

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17613-17616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The constructs for in vitro splicing substrates and minigenes bearing the mutations m1 and m2 were generated by recombinant PCR. For U2AF65 expression, a plasmid pCS3+MT (29Roth M.B. Zahler A.M. Stolk J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), which contains the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer, Myc epitope tags, and SV40 poly(A) signal, was used as a host vector. This vector was a gift from Dr. Yongsok Kim (NHLBI, National Institutes of Health). The nuclear localization signal of the SV40 large T antigen was introduced following the 5th copy of the Myc epitope. The full-length coding sequence for human U2AF65 was obtained from HeLa cell mRNA by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and introduced downstream of the nuclear localization signal. Truncated U2AF65 fragments were further amplified by PCR and introduced into the same vector. The expressed proteins contain five copies of the Myc epitope and a nuclear localization signal at the amino terminus. All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Nuclear extracts from Y79 cells were prepared according to protocols previously described (30Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Curr. Protocols Mol. Biol. 1990; 2: 12.1.1-12.1.9Google Scholar). Cells are washed in phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 1850 × g. Packed cells are quickly resuspended in 5× the packed cell volume of the hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9 at 4 °C, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol (DTT)) and are centrifuged for 5 min at 1850 ×g. The cells are resuspended in the hypotonic buffer to a final volume of 3× the original packed cell volume and allowed to swell for 10–15 min on ice. The swollen cells are homogenized with 10–15 strokes in a glass Dounce homogenizer to obtain >70% of cell lysis and the nuclei are centrifuged for 15 min at 3300 ×g. The nuclear pellets are resuspended in the low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.4 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm DTT) with a volume equal to 0.33–0.5× the packed nuclear volume. High salt buffer (0.33–0.5× the original packed nuclear volume), consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.2 m KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.4 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm DTT, is added to the suspended nuclei, and then the entire suspension is homogenized with 3–5 strokes in the Dounce homogenizer. Following extraction for 30 min with stirring, the nuclear suspension is centrifuged for 30 min at 25,000 × g. The resulting supernatant is dialyzed against a buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.4 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm DTT for 2–4 h. The insoluble materials are removed by centrifugation. The aliquoted nuclear extracts are quickly frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −70 °C. All procedures are performed at 0–4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Typically, protein concentrations of 7–10 mg/ml were obtained. Capped splicing RNA substrates, uniformly labeled with [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), were synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) from the template plasmids linearized by the appropriate restriction enzymes. In vitro splicing assays were performed in 15-μl volumes containing 5 μl of nuclear extracts, 1 μl of a 15× concentrated splicing mix (4.5 mm MgCl2, 22.5 mm ATP, 75 mm creatine phosphate, and 75 mmdithiothreitol), 40 units of RNasin (Promega), and 2 ng of capped and labeled pre-mRNA substrates. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 0.5–4 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of proteinase K, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The resulting RNAs were electrophoresed in denaturing urea-polyacrylamide (4.5, 6, and 10%) gels and autoradiographed. The debranching reaction was performed as described previously (31Ruskin B. Green M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For analysis of spliceosome complexes, the splicing reaction was performed under the same conditions as described above. The reaction was started by addition of the labeled pre-mRNA and incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times. The reaction was stopped by addition of heparin (final concentration 5 mg/ml) and placed on ice for 10 min prior to electrophoresis. Samples for zero time incubation were assembled by first adding heparin to the reaction mixture without the pre-mRNA, and then the pre-mRNAs were added on ice. The reaction mixture was electrophoresed in a native polyacrylamide gel (4% acrylamide with 0.052% bisacrylamide) using a running buffer containing 25 mm Tris and 192 mm glycine at 120 V/10 cm for 2–3 h. The dried gels were autoradiographed. The spliced RNA products were reverse-transcribed by Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using random primers. The resulting cDNAs were amplified by Ampli Tag (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using primers 5′-GAGCTGTCAGTTATAGCAGTGTG-3′ and 5′-TGCACATTGGCTTGGTGCTTTGGA-3′, followed by the second amplification using primers 5′-GTGTGGAGAGTAGACTGGCTTCC-3′ and 5′-TGGAAATGGCTTACTGCTAGGCA-3′. The products were subcloned in pGEM-T (Promega). DNA sequencing was performed using dRhodamine termination cycle sequencing reagents (PE Applied Biosystems). The minigenes were transfected into Y79 cells using Lipofectin and into HeLa cells by the calcium-phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (14Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17613-17616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For cotransfection of a minigene with the U2AF65 expression constructs, indicated amounts of the U2AF65 construct and the empty host vector (total 1.25 μg) and the wild-type minigene containing IDDE (1 μg) were cotransfected into 2 × 106 Y79 cells with 7–8 μl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). After transfection, Y79 cells were replated on poly-d-lysine-coated plates and maintained in 2 mm sodium butyrate containing medium for 4–6 days before being harvested. Preparation of total RNA from transfected cells, analysis of mRNAs derived from the minigenes by RT-PCR, and quantitation of RT-PCR products by using 5′ end 32P-labeled primers was performed as described previously (14Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17613-17616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments that required both protein and mRNA analyses were conducted in parallel. To detect exogenously expressed Myc-tagged U2AF65 proteins, the total protein extracts were prepared by addition of SDS sample buffer directly to the transfected cells. Protein samples were electrophoresed in denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.). A monoclonal antibody specific to the Myc epitope (Invitrogen) was used for detection with the SuperSignal System (Pierce). In a previous study, we have defined an intronic enhancer region, IDDE, which is required for neural cell-specific alternative splicing of the cassette-type exon, N30, in human NMHC-B pre-mRNA (see Fig. 1). In the presence of the IDDE, the mRNA from a minigene transfected into human neural retinoblastoma Y79 cells can include the N30 exon, similar to the endogenous NMHC-B mRNA, whereas in the absence of the IDDE, the minigene mRNA excludes exon N30. Exon N30 is skipped in the mRNAs from minigenes both with and without the IDDE in transfected non-neural cell lines, such as HeLa and NIH3T3 cells (14Kawamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17613-17616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). Therefore, the IDDE confers neural cell specificity on N30 inclusion. To investigate how the IDDE enhances N30 recognition and promotes removal of the upstream and downstream introns, we first established anin vitro splicing assay system for NMHC-B pre-mRNA using Y79 nuclear extracts. We chose Y79 cells as a source of nuclear extracts since endogenous Y79 mRNA includes the N30 exon to a large extent, similar to the retina, and more than whole brain. These Y79 cells have been used to identify the IDDE in a minigene transfection system. We analyzed the effects of the IDDE on in vitro splicing of pre-mRNA in the context of three different two-exon substrates that consist of the N30 exon and either the upstream (E5) or downstream (E6) exon and E5-E6 alone. A diagram of the pre-mRNA substrates is shown in Fig. 1 C, comparing them to the native gene (A) and the minigenes (B) used in the experiments below. The middle 345 nts of the intron between E5 and N30 was removed from the pre-mRNA for in vitro splicing in order to obtain better splicing efficiency, since this portion is dispensable for the neural cell-specific N30 inclusion in the minigene context. 2S. Kawamoto, unpublished observations. The in vitro transcribed pre-mRNAs were incubated with Y79 nuclear extracts, and the resulting RNAs were analyzed by denaturing urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. The pre-mRNAs consisting of the N30 and E6 exons with and without the IDDE undergo efficient splicing (lanes 6 and 8 in Fig. 2). The cleaved N30 exon and the lariat containing intron-E6 intermediate products as well as the spliced mRNA and the lariat intron final products are readily detected. Identities of the intermediate and final product RNAs were inferred from the size of the products, the time course of their appearances, their electrophoretic mobility in different polyacrylamide concentration gels, and the effect of treating the products with S100 fractions containing debranching activity (data not shown). Relative amounts of each of the four products from the pre-mRNA containing the IDDE are roughly equal to those from pre-mRNA lacking the IDDE, indicating that there is no effect of the IDDE on the splicing efficiency of N30-E6. In contrast, pre-mRNA consisting of the E5 and N30 exons, in the absence of the IDDE, is poorly spliced. Neither the expected intermediates nor the final products are detectable (lane 2 in Fig. 2). However, including the IDDE downstream of N30 in the pre-mRNA causes marked activation of E5-N30 splicing. All four intermediate and final products are now readily seen (lane 4 in Fig. 2). Thus, the IDDE promotes removal of the intron between E5 and N30. We also analyzed pre-mRNA consisting of the two constitutive exons E5 and E6. In the absence of the IDDE, this pre-mRNA substrate is efficiently spliced (lane 10 in Fig. 2). The 5′ splice donor sequence following E5 is readily used in the context of the E5-E6 pre-mRNA. Since all these splicing reactions are carried out using two-exon pre-mRNA, without a competing exon, poor efficiency of the E5-N30 splicing in the absence of the IDDE is likely due to the intrinsically poor recognition signals of the 3′ splice site preceding the N30 exon. Thus, the IDDE appears to promote the recognition of the 3′ splice signal of the N30 exon. Pre-mRNA splicing is a multistage, dynamic biochemical reaction taking place within the spliceosome. It has been well documented that assembly of the spliceosome proceeds through a highly ordered pathway of complex formation, involving 5 snRNAs and over 50 distinct protein components. A series of complexes are distinguished at different stages of spliceosome assembly in the order E → A → B → C (32Reed R. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1996; 6: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To determine at what stage during the splicing reaction the IDDE functions, we analyzed spliceosome assembly using the E5-N30 pre-mRNAs with and without the IDDE. The splicing reaction mixture at different time points was resolved by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both pre-mRNAs form large quantities of complex H in which hnRNP proteins bind nonspecifically to the pre-mRNAs (Fig.3). Complex H is not considered a functional intermediate in the spliceosome assembly pathway. The initial prespliceosome complex E, in which U1snRNP and U2AF are recruited to the 5′ and 3′ splice sites, respectively, cannot be separated out from complex H in this assay system. By 15 min, the pre-mRNA containing the IDDE can form prespliceosome complex A in which U2snRNP is recruited to the 3′ splice site (lanes 2–4in Fig. 3). The observation that this slower migrating complex appears in an ATP-dependent manner (lanes 9 and10 in Fig. 3) meets a criterion for complex A. Upon removal of the IDDE, however, formation of the A complex is greatly diminished at all time points analyzed (lanes 5–8 in Fig. 3). The subsequent complexes B and C can hardly be seen at this time. This may be due to the overall lower efficiency of splicing of NMHC-B pre-mRNA compared with widely used in vitro splicing substrates such as β-globin pre-mRNA. The splicing efficiency of NMHC-B pre-mRNAs is severalfold lower compared with that of β-globin pre-mRNA (data not shown). Although whether pre-mRNA lacking the IDDE can recruit U2AF, whose binding is a prerequisite for efficient U2snRNP binding, has not been determined, it does appear that the IDDE facilitates spliceosome assembly at an early stage before formation of complex A. The above data indicate that the 3′ splice site region preceding exon N30 is poorly recognized by spliceosome components in the absence of the IDDE. Therefore, we focused on analyzing this 3′ splice region in detail. For this purpose, the location of the branch site was determined by RT-PCR. It has been reported that some reverse transcriptases pause at the 2′–5′ linkage position of a template RNA but, eventually, are capable of reading through this backbone (33Vogel J. Hess W.R. Börner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2030-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The lariat-containing RNA mixtures were reverse-transcribed, and the resulting cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the primer set diagrammed in Fig.4 A. This primer set selectively permits the cDNA of the lariat RNA to be amplified, but fails to amplify the cDNA of the linear RNA (Fig. 4 A right versus Fig. 4 A, left). The sequences of the PCR products are shown in Fig. 4, B1 and2. The arrows shown are at the junction between the end of the 5′ splice site nucleotide and the branch site. In the first case, reverse transcriptase misincorporates adenosine instead of thymidine at the branch point (Fig. 4 B1), a"

Although gene expression can be regulated at many levels, the rates at which individual mRNAs decay is a major factor contributing to steady-state mRNA levels (reviewed in Ref. 2Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 16-95Crossref Google Scholar). The degradation rates of individual mRNAs can vary by an order of magnitude or more. Additionally, these rates can vary as a consequence of differentiation or a particular stage of the cell cycle. Such variations apparently comprise part of the normal pleiotropic response to cellular proliferation and differentiation signals and usually involve only a subset of mRNAs. One such developmental system for studies of gene expression is the human cell line K562 (3Lozzio C.B. Lozzio B.B. Blood. 1975; 45: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Dean A. Ley T.J. Humphries R.K. Fordis M. Schecter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5515-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). K562 cells are bipotential for erythroid and megakaryoblastic development. Treatment of K562 cells with the protein kinase C activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA1) leads to loss of erythroid properties and maturation into megakaryoblasts, the precursor to platelets (reviewed in Ref. 5Alitalo R. Leuk. Res. 1990; 14: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The maturation processes resemble those observed during normal platelet development and include the following: inhibition of cellular replication; increase in cell volume; loss of glycophorin A, an erythroid membrane protein; and synthesis of megakaryoblast proteins, such as glycoprotein IIIa, platelet peroxidase, thromboxane A2 receptors, the A and the B chains (c-sis) of PDGF, TGF-β1, urokinase-plasminogen activator and its specific inhibitor, type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor. Differentiation of a number of hematopoietic cell types appears to require inhibition of cellular proliferation. High level expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene appears to favor cellular proliferation over differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 6Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). This conclusion is based upon three observations: (i) c-mycexpression declines an order of magnitude during the early stages of differentiation (7Lachman H.M. Skoultchi A.L. Nature. 1984; 310: 592-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 8Lachman H.M. Hatton K.S. Skoultchi A.I. Schildkraut C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nienhuis A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Thus, changes in the levels and timing of c-myc expression are essential to permit hematopoiesis, and it is thus important to understand at the molecular level how the cell effects these changes. Transcription of the c-myc gene appears to be constitutive during differentiation of K562 cells to megakaryoblasts (17Colamonici O.R. Trepel J.B. Vidal C.A. Neckers L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1847-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, steady-state levels of c-mycmRNA decline at least 10-fold during the course of differentiation of murine erythroid leukemia cells, human monoblastic cells, and K562 cells (10Coppola J.A. Cole M.D. Nature. 1986; 320: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11Dmitrovsky E. Kuehl W.M. Hollis G.F. Krisch I.R. Bender T.P. Segal S. Nature. 1986; 322: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 12Lachman H.M. Cheng G. Skoultchi A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This suggests that mRNA destabilization may exert a role in c-myc down-regulation during hematopoiesis. Here, I have examined the decay of c-myc mRNA during megakaryoblastic differentiation of K562 cells, utilizing both whole cells and in vitro mRNA decay assays. TPA induces a 20-fold decline in c-myc mRNA levels within 2 h. The decline likely results in part from a 4-fold acceleration in the decay rate of c-myc mRNA beginning 30–60 min after TPA addition. An in vitro mRNA decay system reconstitutes the destabilization effect and requires two cellular fractions: polysomes from TPA-treated cells and the 130,000 × gpostribosomal supernatant (S130) from either untreated or TPA-treated cells. Therefore, TPA appears to activate or induce a polysome-associated component that, in concert with the S130 factor(s), acts to promote the rapid decline in c-myc mRNA levels in differentiating megakaryoblasts. In proliferating cells, c-myc mRNA rapidly decays by a sequential pathway involving rapid removal of the poly(A) tract to generate a deadenylated or oligoadenylated form; this is followed by degradation of the mRNA body generating 3′-terminal decay intermediates. Its decay then continues in a 3′→5′ direction (18Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16174-16179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). c-myc mRNA decays via this pathway in vitro as well (19Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 20Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34770-34774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, in differentiating cells and in extracts of these cells, c-myc mRNA appears to decay, at least in part, by an additional mechanism that may not require prior conversion of polyadenylated molecules to a deadenylated form. Restriction enzymes, RNasin, and plasmid pGEM-7Zf(+) were obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Plasmid pSM-1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). TPA and RNase T1 were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). RNase H and oligo(dT)-cellulose type 7 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). Creatine phosphate, creatine phosphokinase, actinomycin D, and yeast tRNA were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). [α-32P]UTP and [α-32P]GTP were from ICN Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). Oligodeoxynuclotide synthesis was performed by Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). All other reagents were molecular biology grade. A radiolabeled probe for detection of human γ-globin mRNA by nuclease S1 mapping was prepared by 3′-end labeling of plasmid pDCY2 digested with EcoRI as described (19Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The remaining probes, described below, were prepared by in vitro transcription of linearized plasmid templates using SP6 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP (>800 Ci/mmol), unless otherwise noted, as described (19Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The same c-myc probe was used for both RNase protection assays and for RNA blot analyses. It was prepared by in vitro transcription of SspI-digested plasmid pSP65myc(CLARI) (19Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). For PDGF-B (c-sis) mRNA, the 2.8-kb HindIII-SacI fragment of plasmid pSM-1 (21Ratner L. Josephs S.F. Jarrett R. Reitz Jr., M.S. Wong-Staal F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 5007-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the HindIII-SacI site of plasmid pGEM-7Zf(+) to generate plasmid pGEM-huSIS-5′. The PDGF-B probe was prepared by in vitro transcription ofBamHI-digested plasmid pGEM-huSIS-5′. The probe protects a 277-nt region spanning nt 1949–2225. The β-actin probe was prepared by in vitro transcription of EcoRI-digested plasmid pGW02. This probe protects a 189-nt region spanning nt 1261–1449. For TGF-β1, clone 589749 (GenBank™ accession numberAA148092) from the IMAGE consortium human cDNA library (Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and their Expression (22Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soarer M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar)) was obtained from Genome Systems, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). A DNA fragment spanning nt 1607–1861 of the TGF-β1 cDNA sequence (23Derynck R. Jarrett J.A. Chen E.Y. Eaton D.H. Bell J.R. Assoian R.K. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1985; 316: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using a 5′-primer incorporating aHindIII site and a 3′-primer incorporating anEcoRI site. The fragment was subcloned into theHindIII-EcoRI sites of pGEM-7Zf(+) to generate plasmid pTGFβ (nt 1607–1861). The TGF-β1 probe was prepared byin vitro transcription of HindIII-digested plasmid pTGFβ (nt 1607–1861) using T7 RNA polymerase. A 245-nt,32P-labeled, sense-strand RNA containing the c-myc coding region determinant (CRD (24Bernstein P.L. Herrick D.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar)) was prepared by transcription of EcoRI-digested plasmid pGEM-myc(XhoII/Nsi) (gift of J. Ross) using [α-32P]GTP. All probes were labeled to a specific activity of at least 20,000 cpm/fmol. TPA was dissolved in 100% ethanol, and its concentration was determined by absorbance at 333 nm, using ε = 5400. Exponentially dividing K562 cells, a human cell line established from a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (3Lozzio C.B. Lozzio B.B. Blood. 1975; 45: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Dean A. Ley T.J. Humphries R.K. Fordis M. Schecter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5515-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), were cultured for 1 h either without or with TPA (20 ng/ml final concentration). Cells were then cultured with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D for various lengths of time at 37 °C to inhibit transcription. For each time point, cells were harvested and total RNA was prepared by lysis of cells, phenol extraction of proteins, and pelleting of RNA through a pad of CsCl as described (25Ross J. Peltz S.W. Kobs G. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4362-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by absorption at 260 nm. In some experiments 10-μg aliquots of RNA from each time point were separated into poly(A+) and poly(A−) fractions by batch adsorption and elution with oligo(dT)-cellulose as described (18Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16174-16179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). γ-Globin mRNA was detected by S1 nuclease mapping as described (18Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16174-16179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). c-myc, PDGF-B, TGF-β1, and β-actin mRNAs were detected by RNase P1+T1 protection assays as described (19Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Bands were quantified by capturing the gel images from x-ray film using a Kodak DC120 digital camera and then analyzing the images using 1D Image Analysis Software (version 3.0; Eastman Kodak, New Haven, CT). 10 μg of each RNA sample was subjected to oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage exactly as described (18Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16174-16179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using an antisense c-mycoligodeoxynucleotide (5′-CAAGTTCATAGGTGATTGCTG-3′), which anneals approximately 400 nt upstream of poly(A) site 2 (19Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). RNA samples were then fractionated in a denaturing agarose gel and blotted to a membrane. The 3′-end of c-myc mRNA was detected by incubating the membrane with a 32P-labeled, 3′-end-specific probe (see above), washing the membrane, and exposing it to x-ray film as described (19Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This RNase H mapping procedure permits a higher resolution analysis of poly(A) tract lengths than traditional Northern blotting (26Brewer G. Ross J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Brewer G. Promega Notes. 1992; 40: 11-13Google Scholar). Polysomes and the 130,000 × g postribosomal supernatant (S130) were prepared from K562 cells using Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1.5 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg each of leupeptin and pepstatin A per ml, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described previously (19Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In vitromRNA decay reactions were incubated at 37 °C (unless otherwise noted) for various times in 10-μl volumes containing 0.3A 260 units of polysomes and 28 μg of S130 protein (or 28 μg of BSA as a control). These amounts correspond to approximately 1 × 106 cell equivalents of polysomes and S130. Reactions also contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 unit of creatine phosphokinase, 1 mm ATP, 0.4 mm GTP, 0.1 mm spermine, and 2 units of RNasin. RNA was purified for each time point, and c-myc and γ-globin mRNAs were analyzed as described above. To characterize the protein and nucleic acid requirements of an S130-associated activity required for TPA-induced destabilization of c-myc mRNA in vitro, S130 from TPA-treated cells was treated with either proteinase K or micrococcal nuclease, exactly as described by Brewer and Ross (28Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1996-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). 1 ng of 32P-labeled RNA containing the c-myc CRD was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in mixtures identical to in vitro mRNA decay reactions except that they also contained 10 μg of tRNA and 10% glycerol. Unbound RNA was digested by addition of 1 unit of RNase T1 and incubation at 30 °C for 10 min. To reduce nonspecific protein-RNA interactions, 50 μg of heparin was added and incubation was continued for 10 min. Protein-RNA complexes were resolved in a 6% native polyacrylamide gel as described (24Bernstein P.L. Herrick D.J. Prokipcak R.D. Ross J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 29Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 30Leeds P. Kren B.T. Boylan J.M. Betz N.A. Steer C.J. Gruppuso P.A. Ross J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), detected by exposure to x-ray film, and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Proteins were fractionated in 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose in 10 mm CAPS. For CRD-BP the blot was incubated with chicken anti-CRD-BP IgY (gift of J. Ross) at 1:2000 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% milk solids and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (31Zelus B.D. Stewart R.S. Ross J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2411-2419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For AUF1 the blot was incubated with rabbit anti-AUF1 serum at 1:3000 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% milk solids (32Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin antibodies and developed by chemiluminescence (Pierce). TPA treatment of K562 cells activates a genetic program that results in changing patterns of gene expression leading to megakaryoblastic differentiation. c-myc mRNA is known to decline in K562 cells after 1 day of TPA treatment (17Colamonici O.R. Trepel J.B. Vidal C.A. Neckers L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1847-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, I wished to determine if there were rapid fluctuations in c-myc levels at early times after induction of differentiation. To examine potential fluctuations in c-mycexpression during differentiation, exponentially dividing K562 cells were cultured in the presence of TPA. RNA was extracted from cells at various times, and the level of c-myc mRNA was measured by RNase P1+T1 protection assay employing a 620-nt radiolabeled RNA probe complementary to the 3′-terminal 210 nt of c-mycmRNA (Fig. 1). The time-zero RNA generated four protected fragments corresponding to c-mycmRNA molecules polyadenylated at four closely spaced sites. Historically, these are referred to as poly(A) site 2 (19Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Quantitation of band intensities as a function of time indicated that the level of c-myc mRNA declined about 20-fold within 2 h. This effect was also reproducible, having been observed in two independent experiments and with multiple repeats of the RNase protection assay (data not shown). After 2 h, levels of c-myc mRNA then increased transiently and then decreased again over the next several days. Because K562 cells can lose their capacity for differentiation during long-term culture (33Lumelsky N.L. Forget B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3528-3536Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the levels of γ-globin, PDGF-B, TGF-β1, and β-actin mRNAs were also examined to ensure that the cells have maintained their fidelity for differentiation. Both PDGF-B and TGF-β1 are markers for megakaryoblastic differentiation (5Alitalo R. Leuk. Res. 1990; 14: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The levels of γ-globin mRNA, an erythroid-specific mRNA, remained relatively constant for 24 h but then declined about 80% by 72 h. This is consistent with the loss of erythroid properties. By contrast, the levels of both PDGF-B and TGF-β1 mRNAs were induced by TPA. β-Actin mRNA levels were maximal at 6 h of TPA treatment and then steadily declined between 6 and 72 h. This result is consistent with other reports concerning TPA-induced differentiation of K562 cells to megakaryoblasts, where a decrease in β-actin expression was reported to occur as differentiation proceeded (34Siebert P.D. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3868-3874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results are consistent with TPA-induced maturation of K562 cells to megakaryoblasts. Rapid down-regulation of c-myc mRNA levels is an essential step in the early stages of differentiation of a number of hematopoietic cell lineages (10Coppola J.A. Cole M.D. Nature. 1986; 320: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11Dmitrovsky E. Kuehl W.M. Hollis G.F. Krisch I.R. Bender T.P. Segal S.

A. 1986; 83: 6480-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Prochownik E.V. Kukowska J. Nature. 1986; 322: 848-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 14Kume T.U. Takada S. Obinata M.

A. 1988; 85: 2638-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In K562 cells, the levels of c-myc mRNA decline (Fig. 1) even though transcription of the gene remains active (17Colamonici O.R. Trepel J.B. Vidal C.A. Neckers L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1847-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine if c-myc mRNA is destabilized during this early period, K562 cells were treated with TPA for 1 h and exposed to actinomycin D to inhibit transcription. Cells were harvested for purification of total RNA at various time points. Decay of c-myc mRNA was examined by RNase protection assay. The mRNA was degraded 4-fold faster in TPA-treated cells (estimated half-life 10 min) than in untreated cells (half-life 45 min) (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 10–16 with lanes 3–9; Fig.2 B; see also Fig. 6). By contrast, γ-globin mRNA remained stable (Fig. 2 C). Thus, mRNA destabilization is selective during the early stages of differentiation, and destabilization of c-myc mRNA likely contributes to its rapid decline during TPA treatment.Figure 6Analyses of poly(A+) and poly(A−) c-myc mRNA decay in dividing and differentiating K562 cells. Actinomycin D was added to cultures of either dividing cells or cells treated with 20 ng/ml TPA for 1 h. Total RNA was isolated at the indicated time points. An aliquot of RNA from each time point was separated into poly(A+) and poly(A−) fractions by batch adsorption and elution with oligo(dT)-cellulose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” RNAs were analyzed for c-mycmRNA by RNase P1+T1 protection assay and visualized by exposure to x-ray film.

The plots are presented to the right of each gel panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our long-term goal is to define the cellular components required for regulation of c-myc mRNA decay in dividing and differentiating cells. We and others have utilized cell-free systems to dissect mRNA decay (reviewed in Ref. 35DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1997; 18: 65-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar; see also Ref.36Ford L.P. Watson J. Keene J.D. Wilusz J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Polysomes, with or without the S130 fraction, are incubated for various times in a buffer containing monovalent and divalent cations, ATP/GTP, an ATP-regenerating system, and RNasin (to inhibit indiscriminate degradation of all RNAs). The decay of individual mRNAs is then assessed by nuclease protection assays. Trans-acting factors that contribute to the decay of c-myc mRNA are localized in both the polysome and S130 fractions (19Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 20Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34770-34774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1996-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, to identify cellular factors required to reconstitute TPA-induced destabilization of c-myc mRNAin vitro, polysome and S130 fractions from untreated (control) and TPA-treated cells were mixed in a variety of combinations and incubated for various times in decay reactions. Decay of endogenous, polysome-bound c-myc mRNA was then assessed in each case by RNase protection assays. Either control S130 or TPA S130 mixed with control polysomes accelerated c-myc mRNA decay relative to reactions supplemented with BSA (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 8–16 with lanes 3–7), consistent with earlier identification of an S130-associated destabilizing activity in dividing cells (28Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1996-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, control S130 and TPA S130 were equally effective. Likewise, either control S130 or TPA S130 mixed with TPA polysomes accelerated c-myc mRNA decay relative to reactions supplemented with BSA (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 8–16 with lanes 3–7). Again, control S130 and TPA S130 were equally effective. However, the magnitude of the destabilization effect was greatest in reactions containing polysomes from TPA-treated cells and S130 from either control cells or TPA-treated cells (compare Fig. 3 B, lanes 8–16with Fig. 3 A, lanes 8–16). These data are depicted in graph form in Fig. 3 C (left panel). Thus, a TPA-inducible component appeared to be associated with polysomes. This TPA-inducible, polysome-associated component(s) required the S130 fraction, however, because c-myc mRNA decay rates were comparable in polysome-containing reactions supplemented with BSA instead of the S130 (compare Fig. 3 A,lanes 3–7 with Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–7). Additionally, the TPA-induced destabilizing effect observed with the S130s and TPA polysomes was selective, because γ-globin mRNA was stable under these conditions (Fig. 3 D). Taken together, the results indicate that: (i) TPA-induced destabilization of c-myc mRNA can be reconstituted in vitro; (ii) destabilization in vitro requires polysomes from TPA-treated cells and S130; and (iii) the S130 from either untreated or TPA-treated cells is equally effective. Thus, although the TPA-inducible component(s) fractionates with polysomes, it must act in concert with S130 components to effect destabilization of c-myc mRNA. Thein"

TATA-binding protein acidic activation domain glutathioneS-transferase phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis upstream activation sequence The TATA-binding protein (TBP)1 is a critical factor in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription in eukaryotic cells. TBP recognizes the TATA box present in many promoters and binds in the minor groove, bending and kinking the DNA sharply into an unusual geometry that is probably important for assembly of the complete preinitiation complex (for a review, see Ref. 1Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies in yeast have shown that TBP associates with the promoters of many genes only when the activators that regulate them are induced (2Li X.-Y. Virbasius A. Zhu X. Green M.R.

The type of information obtained in such studies is important for evaluating various mechanistic models for how activators might affect TBP function. In this study, we probe the biochemistry of a complex formed by the acidic activation domain (AAD) of the Gal4 protein (11Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 12Johnston S.A. Salmeron Jr., J.M. Dincher S.S.

The ability of mutant Gal4 AADs to function in vivo correlates well with their ability to bind TBP in vitro (6Melcher K. Johnston S. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3951-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), supporting, but not proving, the idea that this complex is biologically relevant. It is demonstrated here that this complex is composed of 2 eq of the AAD and 1 eq of TBP. Competitive binding studies show that the Gal4 AAD and TATA box-containing DNA compete for limiting TBP, suggesting that the AAD and DNA bind overlapping sites on TBP. Finally, the association and dissociation kinetics of the AAD2-TBP complex are probed. The implications of these results for models of Gal4-activated transcription are considered.

Gene (Amst. ). 1993; 126: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were purified from overexpressingEscherichia coli strains as described. For the determination of the stoichiometry of the Gal4 AD-TBP complex, a derivative of GST-Gal4 AAD that also included a C-terminal His6 tag was constructed, expressed, and purified. This was done to obtain very pure full-length protein by double affinity purification over sequential glutathione-Sepharose and nickel-saturated chelating-Sepharose columns. This protocol eliminated proteolysis products completely, which otherwise constituted a significant portion of the preparation. The expression plasmid was constructed as follows. The activation domain of Gal4p was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using the following primers: 5′-CCG GGA TCC TTA GTA GTG GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG CGA TCC TCT CAT GGT ATC TTC ATC ATC GAA TAG-3′ and 5′-GGT TGG ACG CCA TGG ACG ACC AAA CTG CGT ATA ACG CG-3′ and pGEXcs34 (16Parks T.D. Leuther K.K. Howard E.D. Johnston S.A. Dougherty W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) as the template. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested withNcoI and BamHI and cloned into the plasmid pGEXcs digested with NcoI and BamHI. This provided the expression plasmid pGEXcs34(AD)-His6. To purify GST-Gal4 AAD-His6, the plasmid pGEXcs34(AD)-His6 was transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. The fresh transformant was grown overnight at 37 °C in 10 ml of Luria broth containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol (75 and 25 mg/liter, respectively) and then transferred to 1 liter of Luria broth containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol and grown to an A 600 of 0.5. Expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The culture was grown at 37 °C for another 2 h, after which the cells were collected by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in 1× PBS (20 mmsodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3) in the presence of protease inhibitors phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, and leupeptin (final concentration of 1 mm, 1 mg/liter, and 1 mg/liter, respectively). Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 45 min. The cleared lysate was loaded on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with 1× PBS and washed with PBS and eluted with 30 mm glutathione. The eluate was diluted 10-fold with 1× binding buffer and further purified on chelating-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The concentrations of the GST-Gal4 AAD-His6 and TBP180 stocks employed in the experiment to determine the stoichiometry of the complex (see below) were determined using amino acid analysis (performed on an ABI 420 amino acid analyzer). GST-Gal4 AAD-His6 (1 μm) was mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the indicated amount of TBP180 (see Fig. 1) was added in a total volume of 400 μl in 1× HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol). After incubation on a rotator at 4 °C for 30 min, the beads were washed three times with 1× HBS (with 300 mmNaCl) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by washing once with 1× HBS (300 mm NaCl) without detergent. The beads were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated at 95 °C for 3 min, and loaded onto the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. TBP180 and GST-Gal4 AAD-His6 standards of known concentration were run on the same gel. The intensities of these bands were analyzed by video densitometry. A 14-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a consensus TATA box (5′-GCT ATA AAA GGG CA-3′) was 5′-labeled with fluorescein. 10 nmTBP, the indicated amount of GST-Gal4 AAD or GST (see Fig. 2), and 5 nm of the labeled TATA DNA were mixed in 500 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 4 mmmagnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol, 150 mm potassium glutamate, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), and the solution was allowed to come to equilibrium by incubating at room temperature for 45 min. The sample was then placed into the cavity of a fluorescence spectrometer equipped to measure anisotropy (Panvera Beacon 2000), and the polarization of the emitted light was recorded. 20 nm TBP and 50 nm32P-labeled TATA-containing DNA (double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a consensus sequence (5′-GCT ATA AAA GGG CA-3′)), or a “T6-substituted” sequence (5′-GCT ATA ATA GGG CA-3′) were mixed in 50 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 4 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 75 mm potassium glutamate, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) at room temperature. The GST-Gal4 AAD concentration was 2 μm if present. After the desired time of incubation, 140 μl of competitor solution (containing 1 μm TATA DNA (5′-GCT ATA AAA GGG CA-3′) and 200 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA) was added to the reactions. This served to remove any TBP nonspecifically bound to the labeled DNA. The reaction mixtures were then loaded onto a nitrocellulose membrane (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell) in a BioDot apparatus (Bio-Rad). All wells were washed with 500 μl of reaction buffer. The dried membrane was scanned with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) to quantitate the amount of labeled DNA retained. The data were analyzed with ImageQuant software. 40 nm Gal4-(1–93 + 768–881), 10 nmF-UAS21(5′-GAC GGA GGACTG TCC TCC GAG-3′, end-labeled with fluorescein), and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was mixed in GD buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 μmZnSO4, 50 μm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) at room temperature for 15 min to allow complex formation. TBP and TATA DNA were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:3 at 4 °C for 30 min. This TBP-TATA mixture (in parallel experiments, either TBP alone or TATA DNA alone) was then mixed with the Gal4-UAS complex solution at the indicated concentration and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The samples were placed into the cavity of a fluorescence spectrometer equipped to measure anisotropy (Panvera Beacon 2000), and the polarization of the emitted light was recorded. Purified His6TBP or yeast crude lysate was incubated with excess TATA-containing double-stranded DNA (5′-GGA ATT CGG GCT ATA AAA GGG GGA TCC G-3′) in GTD buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 75 mmpotassium acetate, 20 μm zinc sulfate, 4 mmmagnesium chloride, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μm EDTA, and 10% (w/v) glycerol) at 4 °C for 1 h. Then GST-Gal4 AAD-bound glutathione beads were added, and the reactions were further incubated at 4 °C for 45 min. The final concentrations of GST-Gal4 AAD, TATA DNA, purified TBP, and TBP in yeast lysate were 12 μm, 6 μm, 12 nm, and 6 nm, respectively. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed with GTD buffer three times. The beads were then resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated at 95 °C for 10 min, and loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The amount of TBP was compared by Western blot. Chemical cross-linking experiments were carried out as described (17Fancy D.A. Kodadek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6020-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The concentrations of GST-Gal4 AAD, GST, and TBP used in this experiment were 1.3, 1.3, and 0.16 μm, respectively. TBP180 (0.3 μm) was added to a solution containing GST-Gal4 AAD (1 μm) immobilized on glutathione beads in a final volume of 400 μl in 1× HBS buffer (see above). After various time increments (0, 3, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min of incubation on a rotor at 4 °C) aliquots were removed, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was discarded. As described for the stoichiometry experiment, the beads were washed three times with 1× HBS buffer (300 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and then a final time with 1× HBS buffer that did not contain detergent. The resulting beads were then resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated at 95 °C for 10 min. The degree of complex association as a function of time was assessed by separating the resulting protein mixtures with SDS-PAGE and then quantifying the appropriate bands with densitometry. As described under the stoichiometry experimental section, standards of known concentration of both GST-Gal4 AAD and TBP180 were also run on the gel to standardize the intensities of the bands for the pull-down lanes. An additional control lane represents a GST pull-down experiment (instead of GST-Gal4 AAD) to demonstrate that the binding of TBP is specific for the activation domain. Reaction mixture containing 40 nm Gal4p-(1–93 + 768–881), 10 nm F-UAS21, and 720 nm TBP in GD buffer was incubated at room temperature for 60 min to allow triple complex formation. GST-Gal4 AAD was then added to a final concentration of 10 μm, and the sample was immediately placed into the fluorescence polarization analyzer and the polarization value was recorded at 30-s intervals for 18 min. Gal4p binds to DNA as a dimer (18Carey M. Kakidani H. Leatherwood J. Mostashari F. Ptashne M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and we have previously shown that a single Gal4p dimer bound stably to a promoter can maximally activate transcription in vivo (19Xu H. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7677-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, two AADs are sufficient to satisfy whatever requirement there is for activated transcription in yeast, at least for the GAL genes. This raises the interesting question of whether each of the two AADs in the dimer contact the same or different factors at any particular stage of the transcription cycle. Specifically, for the purposes of this study, when Gal4p binds TBP, are both AADs occupied in this interaction or is one free to bind a different transcription factor? To determine the stoichiometry of the Gal4 AAD-TBP complex, a protein composed of GST fused to the 34-residue core region (residues 841–875) of the Gal4 AAD (GST-Gal4 AAD) and a C-terminal 6-histidine tag was titrated with the conserved carboxyl 180-residue fragment of yeast TBP (TBP180) (14Kim Y. Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Each protein was purified to apparent homogeneity, and their concentrations were determined accurately by amino acid analysis. The experiment employed GST-Gal4 AAD at a concentration of 10−6m to ensure stoichiometric binding (the reported K D of this complex is approximately 10−7m (6Melcher K. Johnston S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7Wu Y. Reece R.J. Ptashne M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3951-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar)). As shown in Fig. 1, binding of TBP180 to GST-Gal4 AAD saturated cleanly at a molar ratio of two GST-Gal4 AAD molecules for each TBP180. Addition of more than 0.5 eq did not increase the amount of TBP180 retained by the AAD, even at these high protein concentrations. Similar results were obtained with full-length TBP (data not shown). Although this experiment was conducted with an artificial AAD-containing fusion protein, it seems likely that GST-Gal4 AAD is a reasonable model for how the AAD is presented to TBP normally, because both GST and Gal4p are native dimers. This 2:1 stoichiometry argues that if DNA-bound Gal4p binds to TBP in vivo, both AADs are involved in the association. It is important to point out that these data cannot distinguish between a 2:1 and a 4:2 complex because both would have a 2:1 ratio of proteins. Because TBP can form a stable homodimer (20Coleman R.A. Taggart A.K.P. Benjamin L.R. Pugh B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13842-13849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the 4:2 species must be considered. Unfortunately efforts to resolve this issue using analytical ultracentrifugation or gel filtration, which require the complex to remain intact for long periods of time, failed to provide clear-cut results (data not shown). However, on the basis of cross-linking and other data presented below, it seems likely that the complex has only one molecule of TBP in it. A common model for how an activator might stimulate TBP function is that it enhances TBP-TATA binding, for example, through cooperative binding to the promoter. The effect of the Gal4 AAD on TBP-TATA interactions has not been investigated previously, so it is unclear if the Gal4 AAD-TBP complex has properties consistent with this kind of model. Indeed, previous mutagenesis studies (6Melcher K. Johnston S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 21Kim T.K. Hashimoto S. Kelleher R.J. Flanagan P.M. Kornberg R.D. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1994; 369: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have indicated that the TBP residues most critical for Gal4 AAD binding are located on the DNA binding surface of the protein, suggesting that the AAD and DNA might compete for TBP. To probe this point, a fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide containing a consensus TATA sequence was mixed with TBP and increasing amounts of GST-Gal4 AAD (or GST as a control). TBP-DNA binding was monitored by fluorescence polarization (22Heyduk T., Y., M. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Method. Enzymol. 1996; 274: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). When the free fluorescein-labeled DNA is excited with polarized light, little of the emitted light retains the original polarization due to relatively rapid tumbling in solution. However, binding of the much larger TBP molecule reduces the tumbling rate of the DNA and results in a large increase in polarization of the emitted light. Thus, if the Gal4 AAD competes with DNA for limiting TBP, then the polarization would be expected to decrease as the AAD concentration increases. As shown in Fig.2 A, this is exactly the result observed. A semilog plot of the degree of polarization plotted against the GST-Gal4 AAD concentration is linear, consistent with a simple competition between GST-Gal4 AAD and the labeled DNA (Fig.2 B). However, no effect was observed when the TBP-TATA complex was challenged with GST alone (Fig. 2 A). This experiment demonstrates that the Gal4 AAD and TATA-containing DNAs compete for TBP. Combined with the mutagenesis data (21Kim T.K. Hashimoto S. Kelleher R.J. Flanagan P.M. Kornberg R.D. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1994; 369: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), this argues that the AAD and DNA both bind to the convex underside of the TBP “saddle” (23Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.-H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), although we cannot absolutely rule out an allosteric competition model. Fig. 3 shows an experiment that corroborates the conclusion that the Gal4 AAD and DNA bind TBP competitively. In this case, TBP was preincubated with GST-Gal4 AAD (or GST as a control) to allow for complex formation, then a radiolabeled TATA-containing oligonucleotide was added, and the rate of TBP-DNA complex formation was measured by nitrocellulose filter binding. Experiments were carried out with either a consensus TATA sequence (TATAAAA) or one that binds TBP with an approximately 2-fold lower affinity (TATAATA). In each case, the presence of GST-Gal4 AAD inhibited the rate of association of TBP with the TATA-containing oligonucleotides. This competition between the Gal4 AAD and TATA DNA for TBP binding was also found in experiments using a different derivative of the activator, Gal4-(1–93 + 768–881), that contains a much larger fragment of the native C terminus as well as the N-terminal DNA-binding domain. It binds to TBP in vitro with aK D of 200 nm. 2Y. Xie and T. Kodadek, unpublished data. When this Gal4 derivative was mixed with a fluorescein end-labeled 21-base pair oligonucleotide containing a consensus Gal-UAS, an increased polarization value seen relative to free DNA was observed, as expected (not shown). Titration of the Gal4 derivative-UAS complex with TBP resulted in a further increase in the fluorescence polarization, reflecting binding of TBP to the AAD (TBP alone did not bind to the UAS DNA at such concentrations, data not shown). It should be noted that although the change in polarization upon TBP addition is modest, this is expected. Because of the lifetime of the fluorescein excited state, the magnitude of changes in the polarization value become very small as the mass of the molecule approaches about 100 kDa and the mass of the Gal4 derivative-DNA complex is already 60 kDa. In any case, the data presented were highly reproducible, and careful measurements do allow this technique to be employed in the 60–100-kDa molecular mass range. In contrast to adding TBP alone to the Gal4 derivative-DNA complex, if the TBP was first saturated with a TATA box-containing oligonucleotide prior to addition to the Gal4 derivative-UAS complex, no such increase was detected (Fig. 4). This indicates that TBP-Gal4p-(1–93 + 768–881) association was blocked by the TATA-containing DNA. We conclude that both the core 34-residue AAD and the much larger C-terminal 768–881 fragment compete with DNA for TBP and that this result is likely to reflect the behavior of native Gal4p These experiments utilized purified, recombinant TBP. A concern is that the results might not reflect the properties of TBP in its native environment, where it is associated with other transcription factors such as TBP-associated factors (24Dynlacht B.D. Hoey T. Tjian R. Cell. 1991; 66: 563-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 25Poon D. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15325-15328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To address this point, the effect of TATA-containing DNA on the ability of GST-Gal4 AAD to bind purified TBP was compared with its effect on TBP binding out of a whole cell extract. A pull-down experiment was employed in which the GST-Gal4 AAD was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. As shown in Fig.5, bead-bound GST-Gal4 AAD retained TBP from an extract, consistent with previous findings. But this binding was almost completely abrogated when a TATA-containing oligonucleotide (approximately equal in concentration to the AAD) was added to the extract prior to exposure to the bead-bound AAD. The result was similar to that obtained using purified, recombinant TBP (Fig. 5). These data indicate that the binding experiments using purified proteins are representative of Gal4 AAD-TBP interactions when the latter can associate with other proteins. It was also of interest to examine the kinetics of the formation and the dissociation of the Gal4 AAD-TBP complex. To determine the association rate, GST-Gal4 AAD and TBP180 were incubated together for various time intervals, and then the complexes were pulled down using glutathione-agarose beads. The concentrations of GST-Gal4 AAD (1 μm) and TBP180 (0.3 μm) were above the reported K D of the complex (2 × 10−7m) to encourage complex formation. As shown in Fig. 6, the amount of TBP pulled down by the GST-Gal4 AAD increased slowly with time, reaching half-saturation in about 10–11 min. GST lacking an AAD fusion did not bind detectable amounts of TBP even after 30 min (data not shown). A potential complication with this experiment is that the TBP must associate with a bead-bound AAD, and this heterogeneous aspect of the reaction might result in kinetics that do not reflect the true solution phase association rate of the proteins. Therefore, a chemical cross-linking experiment was used to monitor association of GST-Gal4 AAD and TBP in solution. We employed chemistry developed recently in our laboratory in which a water-soluble Ru(II) complex, tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) chloride hexahydrate, is activated by photolysis with visible light in the presence of ammonium persulfate (26Fancy D. Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 551-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The resultant Ru(III) complex mediates very rapid and efficient cross-linking of closely associated proteins. In many cases, good yields of cross-linked products can be obtained in 1 s or less, making this technique useful for monitoring association reactions that occur over several seconds or minutes. GST-Gal4 AAD (1.3 μm) and TBP (0.16 μm) were mixed together in a buffer containing the Ru(II) complex and ammonium persulfate at time 0. At the times indicated in Fig. 7, the sample was irradiated for 0.5 s, then quenched immediately by the addition of a reducing buffer. The degree of GST-Gal4 AAD-TBP cross-linking was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an antibody raised against TBP. An identical experiment was done using GST (1.3 μm) in place of GST-Gal4 AAD as a control. As shown on the left side of Fig. 7, cross-linking in the presence of GST lacking an AAD produced only two TBP-containing bands, the monomer and the homodimer. No spurious bands due to GST-TBP cross-linking were observed. The production of TBP homodimers was expected because this protein has previously been reported to dimerize (20Coleman R.A. Taggart A.K.P. Benjamin L.R. Pugh B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13842-13849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). When GST-Gal4 AAD was mixed with TBP, there was a reduction of the TBP dimer band, and at least two new bands of higher molecular mass were produced at early times (Fig. 7, right side). One had the mobility expected of the (GST-Gal4 AAD)2-TBP cross-linked complex, and the other was of higher apparent molecular mass. The latter species gradually disappeared over the course of the experiment, and the band representing the two GST-Gal4 AAD molecules and one TBP molecule cross-linked together intensified. Finally, a less intense band corresponding to a GST-Gal4 AAD-TBP cross-link also appeared and intensified over the course of this experiment. The latter species presumably results from incomplete cross-linking of the (GST-Gal4 AAD)2-TBP complex. Finally, at later times, only bands resulting from a complex containing two molecules of GST-Gal4 AAD and one molecule of TBP are detectable by cross-linking. This suggests that the GST-Gal4 AAD-TBP complex indeed has a 2:1, rather than 4:2, stoichiometry, although we cannot absolutely rule out the latter based on cross-linking data alone. The pull-down and cross-linking experiments were done under similar conditions except that the latter employed a lower TBP concentration (0.16 versus 0.3 μm). Although both reveal a modest rate of association between the Gal4 AAD and TBP, it is interesting that the cross-linking bands assigned to the AAD2-TBP complex seem to appear with a rate faster than that observed in the pull-down experiment, which employed a higher TBP concentration. This could be due to the differences between heterogeneous and homogeneous reaction conditions. Alternatively, this apparently counterintuitive result could be explained by the well known phenomenon of TBP dimerization. It is the dissociation of these dimers that limits the association of TBP with DNA (27Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13850-13859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Coleman R.A. Pugh B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Since the Gal4 AAD and DNA appear to bind similar surfaces of TBP, we speculate that AAD-TBP association is also limited by TBP dimer dissociation. There may be more monomeric TBP present at the lower concentration employed in the cross-linking reaction. Invoking the TBP dimer as the initial form of the protein in this experiment also provides a possible rationalization for the high molecular mass product formed initially in the cross-linking reaction. This might be ascribed to a weaker, transient association of the GST-AAD dimer with the TBP homodimer, although we cannot assign this species in an unequivocal fashion. It can be detected by the highly efficient Ru(II)-mediated cross-linking reaction, but not by pull-down experiments in which the pellet is washed several times. In summary, if one considers the complications of the TBP homodimer, it is difficult to say what the association rate of TBP with the Gal4 AAD really is because the value obtained will be highly condition-dependent. This makes it is difficult to say how well any number measured would reflect the in vivosituation when an unknown fraction of the TBP exists in dimeric form. To measure the kinetics of dissociation of the Gal4 AAD-TBP complex, a complex was formed between the Gal4-(1–93 + 768–881) derivative and a fluoresceinated 21-mer oligonucleotide containing a consensus, high affinity 17-base pair Gal4p binding site. This complex was then incubated with TBP, resulting in an increase in the polarization of the fluorescent signal. The DNA-Gal4-(1–93 + 768–881)-TBP complex was then challenged with an excess of GST-Gal4 AAD. The dissociation of TBP from the DNA-Gal4-(1–93 + 768–881) complex was monitored by the resultant decrease of the fluorescence polarization. The data obtained from this experiment (Fig. 8 A) reveal that the TBP-Gal4p complex has a half-life of 4 min under these conditions (k diss = 3.2 × 10−3 s−1). The Gal4 derivative-DNA complex was very stable over the life of the experiment (Fig. 8 B) and therefore, all of the drop in polarization observed in Fig. 8 A can be ascribed to TBP dissociation from the Gal4 derivative-DNA complex. The experiments described here demonstrate that the Gal4 AAD and TBP form a well defined complex of 2:1 stoichiometry that is relatively slow to form and has a half-life of approximately 4 min. If the Gal4 AAD binds monomeric TBP, as the data suggest, then the slow association rate probably reflects, at least in part, the relatively slow dissociation rate of TBP dimers. The most striking result obtained in this study is that the Gal4 AAD and DNA compete for binding to TBP. This finding is consistent with earlier studies, which demonstrated that mutations that alter binding of the AAD to TBP are located on the DNA binding surface of the basal factor (6Melcher K. Johnston S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 21Kim T.K. Hashimoto S. Kelleher R.J. Flanagan P.M. Kornberg R.D. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1994; 369: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We note that the AAD of the herpes simplex virus VP16 has also been shown to recognize the DNA binding surface of TBP (29Nishikawa J. Kokubo T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This finding is apparently at odds with a common model for activator-stimulated TBP function, which is that the activator and TBP bind cooperatively to promoters. Indeed, recent studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that the Gal4 activator and TBP do not bind DNA cooperatively in vitro orin vivo. 3Y. Xie, L. Sun and T. Kodadek, submitted for publication. This is not to say that the Gal4 activator might not stimulate TBP function in some other fashion. However, mechanistic models will have to take into account this observation that DNA and the Gal4 AAD cannot co-occupy TBP. The impact of the kinetic measurements reported here is harder to judge. It is known that the GAL genes respond rapidly upon induction in yeast, so if the Gal4 protein does somehow stimulate TBP binding, this must be a relatively fast process. We observe relatively slow association and dissociation kinetics of the complex, which would seem to be at odds with rapid induction of transcription. However, there remains the possibility that the kinetics of binding of the intact Gal4p to TBP in vivo might differ quantitatively from those observed in our in vitro experiments, because one suspects that TBP dimerization plays a major role in the association rate at least. It is also possible that the dissociation rate could vary significantly in vivo from the value measured in vitro. However, this value should be relatively unaffected by TBP dimerization. Furthermore, a very large AD-containing C-terminal fragment was employed in the off-rate experiment (Fig. 8), making it less likely that a complex containing intact Gal4p would exhibit substantially different kinetics. Nonetheless, it remains possible that a putative complex between TBP and the native Gal4 protein associates and dissociates rapidly enough to play a kinetic role in the formation of a transcription complex, for example by competing an inhibitor from TBP, then “handing off” TBP to the DNA (30Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 551-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the possibility must be considered that the Gal4 AAD-TBP association may not be biologically relevant. While it has been shown here that the proteins do form a well defined 2:1 complex, the biochemical properties of the complex do not seem to obviously support any of the common models for activation. While it is clear that induction of Gal4p activity in vivo does stimulate TBP-TATA binding (2Li X.-Y. Virbasius A. Zhu X. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 399: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 3Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), this could be an indirect effect not involving direct Gal4 AAD-TBP contacts."
https://openalex.org/W1969877772,"Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that control cell cycle progression are regulated in many ways, including activating phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue. This essential phosphorylation is carried out by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK). Here we examine the effects of replacing this threonine residue in human CDK2 by serine. We found that cyclin A bound equally well to wild-type CDK2 (CDK2 Thr-160 ) or to the mutant CDK2 (CDK2 Ser-160 ). In the absence of activating phosphorylation, CDK2 Ser-160 -cyclin A complexes were more active than wild-type CDK2 Thr-160 -cyclin A complexes. In contrast, following activating phosphorylation, CDK2 Ser-160 -cyclin A complexes were less active than phosphorylated CDK2 Thr-160 -cyclin A complexes, reflecting a much smaller effect of activating phosphorylation on CDK2 Ser-160 . The kinetic parameters for phosphorylating histone H1 were similar for mutant and wild-type CDK2, ruling out a general defect in catalytic activity. Interestingly, the CDK2 Ser-160 mutant was selectively defective in phosphorylating a peptide derived from the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. CDK2 Ser-160 was efficiently phosphorylated by CAKs, both human p40 MO15 (CDK7)-cyclin H and budding yeast Cak1p. In fact, the k cat values for phosphorylation of CDK2 Ser-160 were significantly higher than for phosphorylation of CDK2 Thr-160 , indicating that CDK2 Ser-160 is actually phosphorylated more efficiently than wild-type CDK2. In contrast, dephosphorylation proceeded more slowly with CDK2 Ser-160 than with wild-type CDK2, either in HeLa cell extract or by purified PP2Cβ. Combined with the more efficient phosphorylation of CDK2 Ser-160 by CAK, we suggest that one reason for the conservation of threonine as the site of activating phosphorylation may be to favor unphosphorylated CDKs following the degradation of cyclins."
