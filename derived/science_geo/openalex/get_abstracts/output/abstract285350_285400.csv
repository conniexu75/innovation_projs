The amount of nuclear DNA in the homogenates of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants was accurately and rapidly determined by flow microfluorometry, and the distribution of nuclei involved in the cell cycle was charted for tissues selected from different physical locations or developmental stages."
https://openalex.org/W2080074668,"The scanning tunneling microscope has been used to desorb hydrogen from hydrogen-terminated silicon (100) surfaces. As a result of control of the dose of incident electrons, a countable number of desorption sites can be created and the yield and cross section are thereby obtained. Two distinct desorption mechanisms are observed: (i) direct electronic excitation of the Si-H bond by field-emitted electrons and (ii) an atomic resolution mechanism that involves multiple-vibrational excitation by tunneling electrons at low applied voltages. This vibrational heating effect offers significant potential for controlling surface reactions involving adsorbed individual atoms and molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2052068549,"A class of amphiphilic macromolecules has been synthesized by combining well-defined polystyrene (PS) with poly(propylene imine) dendrimers. Five different generations, from PS-dendr-NH(2) up to PS-dendr-(NH(2))(32), were prepared in yields of 70 to 90 percent. Dynamic light scattering, conductivity measurements, and transmission electron microscopy show that in aqueous phases, PS-dendr-(NH(2))(32) forms spherical micelles, PS-dendr-(NH(2))(16) forms micellar rods, and PS-dendr-(NH(2))(8) forms vesicular structures. The lower generations of this class of macromolecules show inverted micellar behavior. The observed effect of amphiphile geometry on aggregation behavior is in qualitative agreement with the theory of Israelachvili et al. The amphiphiles presented here are similar in shape but different in size as compared with traditional surfactants, whereas they are similar in size but different in shape as compared with traditional block copolymers."
https://openalex.org/W2088524202,"The thermal stability of the electric field induced poled order in a new class of second-order optically nonlinear polymers, ""donor-imbedded"" side-chain polyimides containing no flexible connectors or tethers to the nonlinear optical (NLO) chromophore, is investigated. In these polymers, the electron-donor part of the chromophore is a diaryl-substituted amine that is incorporated as a part of the polymer backbone. The donorimbedded systems used in this study have exceptional chemical stabilities at elevated temperatures (350 degrees C) and impressive poled order stability at extremely high temperatures (300 degrees C). In both respects, they were significantly more stable than a true side-chain polyimide with a similar NLO-active chromophore covalently linked to the polymer backbone by a flexible tether group."

By day they rest over coral heads, where they excrete substantial quantities of ammonium and particulate nitrogen and phosphorus into the nutrient-poor waters. The percentages of these nutrients contributed by the fish were comparable to those from other sources. Coral heads with resident fish schools grew faster than those without resident schools, indicating that fish may be more beneficial to the corals than has been assumed."
https://openalex.org/W2041661627,Detrital carbon accumulation accounts for most of an ecosystem's capacity to store organic carbon because the carbon contained as plant detritus exceeds that stored in living plants by about threefold. A comparative analysis of the mass and turnover of detrital carbon in ecosystems demonstrates that these properties are strongly related to the turnover rate of the dominant primary producers and are poorly related to ecosystem primary production. These results contribute to an understanding of the factors that control carbon storage in ecosystems and the role of carbon storage in the global carbon budget.

https://openalex.org/W2031296121,"The Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) satellite conducted extensive observations of the jovian system before, during, and after the impact of the fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in July 1994. About 2 to 4 hours after the impacts of several of the larger fragments, the brightness of the neutral helium (He I) resonance line at 58.4 nanometers temporarily increased by a factor of about 10. The transient 58.4-nanometer brightenings are most simply explained by resonant scattering of sunlight from the widespread high-altitude remnants of the larger impact plumes. Other possible sources of emission, such as electron impact excitation of He or radiative recombination of He(+), may contribute to the observed signal."
https://openalex.org/W2026227178,"The primary database used to assess climatic warming over the last 100 to 150 years is the history of surface air temperatures (SATs) as recorded on a daily basis for weather forecasting. Climatic information missing from the truncated SAT record may be found in borehole temperature profiles. Changes in ground surface temperature (GST) propagate into the subsurface, exponentially decreasing in amplitude with increasing time and depth. Studies to date have shown that changes in SAT tend to be tracted in GST changes and GST is a valid indicator of climate change. Studies of borehole temperatures provide a relatively good constraint on the total magnitude of warming; inferences concerning the date at which the warming trend began and the rate at which it proceeded are much less certain. The available evidence from both GST and SAT studies is sonsistant with a major climatic warming over the North American Continent that likely began near the middle of the 19th century in the east, later in the west. The magnitude of warming in the east estimated from changes in GST significantly exceeds that estimated from SAT. A cause and effect relationship between anthropogenic activities and climatic warming cannot be demonstrated unambiguously at themore » present time. 29 refs., 2 figs.« less"
https://openalex.org/W2011624858,Male hybrids of reciprocal crosses between gray and pinewoods tree frogs (Hyla chtysoscelis x H. femoralis) that were raised to sexual maturity in the laboratory produced distinctive vocalizations. Hybrid females preferred the calls of hybrids to calls of gray tree frogs and also chose synthetic calls with a pulse repetition rate typical of the hybrids in preference to calls with a rate typical of pinewoods tree frogs.
https://openalex.org/W2039714699,Recent estimates for the size of the aggregate North American Indian population in A.D. 1492 vary from about 18 million to less than 2 million. The unusually favorable archaeological characteristics of Mohawk Iroquois sites in eastern New York have allowed a detailed demographic reconstruction of one case for the period A.D. 1400 to 1776. The case indicates that exogenous epidemics did not reach the region until the 17th century and supports arguments favoring the lower populations estimates for North America as a whole.
https://openalex.org/W2068913957,"Certain isolates of the plant-pathogenic fungus Stemphylium botryosum produce a phytotoxin, stemphyloxin I. This toxin (C(21)H(34)O(6)) was crystallized and its structure was determined by x-ray crystallography to be a beta-ketoaldehyde trans-Decalin. This compound is a highly unusual natural product. Iron (Fe(3+)) controls production of toxin by this fungus. Furthermore, iron reacts with the toxin to yield a colored product which aids in its detection on chromatograms and in its quantitative estimation by colorimetry.;"
https://openalex.org/W2089657424,"Detailed studies of the seismicity of several subduction zones demonstrate that shallow-dipping thrust zones turn to steeper angles at depths of about 40 kilometers. An increased downward body force resulting from shallow phase changes in subducted oceanic crust may be the cause of this increased dip angle. In addition, the volume reduction associated with phase changes may produce sufficiently large stresses in neighboring rocks to cause the seismicity of the upper Benioff zone."
https://openalex.org/W2071474129,"This article is a technical comment and author response to the the discovery of naturally occuring fullerenes in Shunga rock samples. The commenting researchers did not find detectable amounts of fullerenes in a variety of carbon-rich rocks. They hypothesize that the fullerenes found in the Shunga sample were probably a localized event. The original researchers, Buseck and Tsipursky, provide a rebuttal with further comments including parallels to other minerological occurences. All agreed that more data are needed. 10 refs."
https://openalex.org/W2077607387,"Röntgensatellit (ROSAT) observations made shortly before and during the collision of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter show enhanced x-ray emissions from the planet's northern high latitudes. These emissions, which occur at System III longitudes where intensity enhancements have previously been observed in Jupiter's ultraviolet aurora, appear to be associated with the comet fragment impacts in Jupiter's southern hemisphere and may represent brightenings of the jovian x-ray aurora caused either by the fragment impacts themselves or by the passage of the fragments and associated dust clouds through Jupiter's inner magnetosphere."
https://openalex.org/W1986271917,"Some strains of Rhizobium japonicum can use hydrogen as an energy source for growth under microaerophilic conditions. Mutant strains have been selected that use hydrogen in the presence of high partial pressures of oxygen. The mutants contain more hydrogenase than the parent strain, both as free-living cells and as bacteroids in nitrogen-fixing soybean root nodules."
https://openalex.org/W2048021375,"Silver nitrate, alpha-aminooxyacetic acid, and aminoethoxyvinylglycine, three potent inhibitors of ethylene synthesis and action, induced the same kind of phenovariation in the liverwort Plagiochila arctica Bryhn and Kaal (Hepaticae) as do antagonists of the synthesis of hydroxyproline-containing protein. This finding (i) supports the hypothesis that hydroxyproline-protein has a role in ethylene-mediated suppression, (ii) provides evidence that the role of ethylene in the correlative development of leafy liverwort gametophytes may be similar to its role in flowering plants, and (iii) contributes to the characterization of a morphoregulatory system that mediates cellular suppression in leafy liverworts and possibly all land plants."

https://openalex.org/W2055725930,"Published studies on greenhouse warming have been ambivalent as to whether warming has arrived. Now two independent studies of the climate record have incriminated the green-house effect in global warming, although they fall short of convicting it. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg are confident they have exonerated natural climatic variability, saying the observed global warming seems to large to account for the warming effect. A group from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory directly implicates greenhouse warming by finding its geographic `fingerprinting` in the climate record of the past century. This article discusses both studies and how the results will affect future concerns in the area of greenhouse warming."

One would reduce fusion research by a third, cut renewable energy programs by half, and halt science education funding for universities but leave the department intact. The other would dismantle DOE uring the next 3 years and likely lead to the closing, consolidation, or sale of many of DOE`s 30 national laboratories. What will happen is still very unclear."
