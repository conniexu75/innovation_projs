https://openalex.org/W1983117400,"That manganese nodules and adjacent deep-sea sediments are accumulating manganese at almost the same rate has been established by thorium-230 dating of both sediments and nodules of known manganese content. The rate of manganese deposition is nearly constant over the world oceans. A relatively simple model of nodule evolution explains the distribution of manganese nodules between sediment column and sediment-water interface; the model appears to apply to other trace elements such as copper, nickel, and cobalt."

This relationship, though facultative, has advantages for both associates. The sponge has a continually enlarging substrate that is free from competitive sessile forms. The coral may benefit from an increased feeding efficiency as a result of water currents produced by the sponge and it is protected from invasion by boring forms, notably clionid sponges."

https://openalex.org/W1998561679,"Seismic methods are now being used to determine not only Earth's elastic properties, but also by how much it departs from a perfectlyelastic body. The seismic anelasticity (Q) varies by several orders of magnitude throughout the mantle, the main feature being an extremely dissipative zone in the upper mantle above 400 kilometers. Recent determinations of viscosity by McConnell show a similar trend. The two sets of data indicate that the ratio of viscosity to Q is roughly a constant, at least in the upper mantle of Earth. On the assumption that this relation is valid for the rest of Earth, viscosities are estimated in regions that are inaccessible for direct measurement. The implied presence of a low-viscosity zone in the upper mantle, overlying a more viscous, less deformable, lower mantle, reconciles viscosites calculated from the shape of Earth and from postglacial uplift. The mismatch of the deformational characteristics at various levels in Earth, coupled with the changing rate of rotation, may be pertinent to the rate of release of seismic energy as a function of depth."

The photopic visibility curve displays two prominent peaks, one at approximately 480 mmicro, and the other with wavelength maximum at approximately 540 mmicro. Reduction of background illumination results in a great increase in sensitivity at 480 mmicro relative to the 540-mmicro peak. This suggests that the scallop may possess photoreceptors that behave like rods in vertebrates. sensitivity of this animal."

Among these men, most of whom have already passed away, few left a greater impress on American chemistry or American chemists than did Professor Johnson, for his whole life was devoted to training workers in his chosen field, to making others realize what chemistry could do for them and to developing institutions and methods to extend the knowledge of chemistry and make this available to those engaged in productive occupations. The principal field to which he devoted his efforts was the application of science to agriculture, the results of which efforts are far better appreciated today, when the practical returns are so apparent than they were during the years of his greatest activity when he was patiently struggling against the conservatism of the so-called practical men who were persuaded with difficulty to make the beginning which was essential to demonstrate the truth of what he was trying to teach them. Professor Johnson was born July 3, 1830, in Kingsboro, Fulton County, New York. His parents were of Connecticut origin but were taken by their parents to New York state when children. Although his father spent most of his active life in successful business he early retired to a large and fertile farm, soon after 1830, I ; = ; I _T-za. I .1-e-, , -. X , m r w-----I T,--"
