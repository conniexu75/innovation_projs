https://openalex.org/W2070924692,"Two genome-wide RNA interference screens published in this issue identify human host factors required for influenza A virus replication in lung epithelia cell lines. König et al. identify 295 host genes required for influenza replication. Of those, 219 are required for efficient wild-type virus growth, and 23 are required for viral entry. Karlas et al. report the discovery of 287 host genes influencing virus replication. An independent assay confirmed 168 hits (59%) inhibiting either the endemic H1N1 (119 hits) or the current pandemic swine-origin (121 hits) influenza A virus strains, with an overlap of 60%. These studies should provide a number of potential targets for host factor-directed antivirals for treatment of influenza viral infection. The small coding capacity of the influenza A virus demands that the virus use the host cellular machinery for many aspects of its life cycle. An integrated systems approach, based on genome-wide RNA interference screening, is now used to identify 295 cellular cofactors required for early-stage influenza virus replication. Knowledge of these host cell requirements provides further targets that could be pursued for antiviral drug development. Influenza A virus is an RNA virus that encodes up to 11 proteins and this small coding capacity demands that the virus use the host cellular machinery for many aspects of its life cycle1. Knowledge of these host cell requirements not only informs us of the molecular pathways exploited by the virus but also provides further targets that could be pursued for antiviral drug development. Here we use an integrative systems approach, based on genome-wide RNA interference screening, to identify 295 cellular cofactors required for early-stage influenza virus replication. Within this group, those involved in kinase-regulated signalling, ubiquitination and phosphatase activity are the most highly enriched, and 181 factors assemble into a highly significant host–pathogen interaction network. Moreover, 219 of the 295 factors were confirmed to be required for efficient wild-type influenza virus growth, and further analysis of a subset of genes showed 23 factors necessary for viral entry, including members of the vacuolar ATPase (vATPase) and COPI-protein families, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) proteins, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-β. Furthermore, 10 proteins were confirmed to be involved in post-entry steps of influenza virus replication. These include nuclear import components, proteases, and the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) IIβ (CAMK2B). Notably, growth of swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus is also dependent on the identified host factors, and we show that small molecule inhibitors of several factors, including vATPase and CAMK2B, antagonize influenza virus replication."
https://openalex.org/W2020246476,"Reprogramming of somatic cell nuclei to yield induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells makes possible derivation of patient-specific stem cells for regenerative medicine. However, iPS cell generation is asynchronous and slow (2-3 weeks), the frequency is low (<0.1%), and DNA demethylation constitutes a bottleneck. To determine regulatory mechanisms involved in reprogramming, we generated interspecies heterokaryons (fused mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and human fibroblasts) that induce reprogramming synchronously, frequently and fast. Here we show that reprogramming towards pluripotency in single heterokaryons is initiated without cell division or DNA replication, rapidly (1 day) and efficiently (70%). Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown showed that activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID, also known as AICDA) is required for promoter demethylation and induction of OCT4 (also known as POU5F1) and NANOG gene expression. AID protein bound silent methylated OCT4 and NANOG promoters in fibroblasts, but not active demethylated promoters in ES cells. These data provide new evidence that mammalian AID is required for active DNA demethylation and initiation of nuclear reprogramming towards pluripotency in human somatic cells."

We report two new loci associated with NSCL/P at 17q22 (rs227731, combined P = 1.07 x 10(-8), relative risk in homozygotes = 1.84, 95% CI 1.34-2.53) and 10q25.3 (rs7078160, combined P = 1.92 x 10(-8), relative risk in homozygotes = 2.17, 95% CI 1.32-3.56)."
https://openalex.org/W2048677414,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a pattern of kidney injury observed either as an idiopathic finding or as a consequence of underlying systemic conditions. Several genes have been identified that, when mutated, lead to inherited FSGS and/or the related nephrotic syndrome. These findings have accelerated the understanding of glomerular podocyte function and disease, motivating our search for additional FSGS genes. Using linkage analysis, we identified a locus for autosomal-dominant FSGS susceptibility on a region of chromosome 14q. By sequencing multiple genes in this region, we detected nine independent nonconservative missense mutations in INF2, which encodes a member of the formin family of actin-regulating proteins. These mutations, all within the diaphanous inhibitory domain of INF2, segregate with FSGS in 11 unrelated families and alter highly conserved amino acid residues. The observation that alterations in this podocyte-expressed formin cause FSGS emphasizes the importance of fine regulation of actin polymerization in podocyte function."
https://openalex.org/W2006482057,"Nicholas Hastie and colleagues show that Wt1 is required for the epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition in the developing epicardium and the formation of mesenchymal cardiovascular progenitors. Wt1 directly regulates the transcription of Snail and E-cadherin, two well-known mediators of EMT. The epicardial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is hypothesized to generate cardiovascular progenitor cells that differentiate into various cell types, including coronary smooth muscle and endothelial cells, perivascular and cardiac interstitial fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. Here we show that an epicardial-specific knockout of the gene encoding Wilms' tumor-1 (Wt1) leads to a reduction in mesenchymal progenitor cells and their derivatives. We show that Wt1 is essential for repression of the epithelial phenotype in epicardial cells and during embryonic stem cell differentiation through direct transcriptional regulation of the genes encoding Snail (Snai1) and E-cadherin (Cdh1), two of the major mediators of EMT. Some mesodermal lineages do not form in Wt1-null embryoid bodies, but this effect is rescued by the expression of Snai1, underscoring the importance of EMT in generating these differentiated cells. These new insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating cardiovascular progenitor cells and EMT will shed light on the pathogenesis of heart diseases and may help the development of cell-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2081014745,"To identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that may have a causal role in hepatocarcinogenesis, we used an animal model in which C57BL/6 mice fed choline-deficient and amino acid defined (CDAA) diet develop preneoplastic lesions at 65 weeks and hepatocellular carcinomas after 84 weeks. miRNA expression profiling showed significant upregulation of miR-181b and miR-181d in the livers of mice as early as 32 weeks that persisted at preneoplastic stage. The expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease 3 (TIMP3), a tumor suppressor and a validated miR-181 target, was markedly suppressed in the livers of mice fed CDAA diet. Upregulation of hepatic transforming growth factor (TGF)beta and its downstream mediators Smad 2, 3 and 4 and increase in phospho-Smad2 in the liver nuclear extract correlated with elevated miR-181b/d in mice fed CDAA diet. The levels of the precursor and mature miR-181b were augmented on exposure of hepatic cells to TGFbeta and were significantly reduced by small interference RNA-mediated depletion of Smad4, showing the involvement of TGFbeta signaling pathway in miR-181b expression. Ectopic expression and depletion of miR-181b showed that miR-181b enhanced matrix metallopeptidases (MMP)2 and MMP9 activity and promoted growth, clonogenic survival, migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells that could be reversed by modulating TIMP3 level. Further, depletion of miR-181b inhibited tumor growth of HCC cells in nude mice. miR-181b also enhanced resistance of HCC cells to the anticancer drug doxorubicin. On the basis of these results, we conclude that upregulation of miR-181b at early stages of feeding CDAA diet promotes hepatocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2077412978,"The existence of a hypothalamic gonadotropin-inhibiting system has been elusive. A neuropeptide named gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH, SIKPSAYLPLRF-NH(2)) which directly inhibits gonadotropin synthesis and release from the pituitary was recently identified in quail hypothalamus. Here we identify GnIH homologs in the human hypothalamus and characterize their distribution and biological activity. GnIH homologs were isolated from the human hypothalamus by immunoaffinity purification, and then identified as MPHSFANLPLRF-NH(2) (human RFRP-1) and VPNLPQRF-NH(2) (human RFRP-3) by mass spectrometry. Immunocytochemistry revealed GnIH-immunoreactive neuronal cell bodies in the dorsomedial region of the hypothalamus with axonal projections to GnRH neurons in the preoptic area as well as to the median eminence. RT-PCR and subsequent DNA sequencing of the PCR products identified human GnIH receptor (GPR147) mRNA expression in the hypothalamus as well as in the pituitary. In situ hybridization further identified the expression of GPR147 mRNA in luteinizing hormone producing cells (gonadotropes). Human RFRP-3 has recently been shown to be a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion in cultured sheep pituitary cells by inhibiting Ca(2+) mobilization. It also directly modulates GnRH neuron firing. The identification of two forms of GnIH (RFRP-1 and RFRP-3) in the human hypothalamus which targets human GnRH neurons and gonadotropes and potently inhibit gonadotropin in sheep models provides a new paradigm for the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in man and a novel means for manipulating reproductive functions."
https://openalex.org/W2161031052,"Hypoxia has been shown to promote tumor metastasis and lead to therapy resistance. Recent work has demonstrated that hypoxia represses E-cadherin expression, a hallmark of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, which is believed to amplify tumor aggressiveness. The molecular mechanism of E-cadherin repression is unknown, yet lysyl oxidases have been implicated to be involved. Gene expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX) and the related LOX-like 2 (LOXL2) is strongly induced by hypoxia. In addition to the previously demonstrated LOX, we characterize LOXL2 as a direct transcriptional target of HIF-1. We demonstrate that activation of lysyl oxidases is required and sufficient for hypoxic repression of E-cadherin, which mediates cellular transformation and takes effect in cellular invasion assays. Our data support a molecular pathway from hypoxia to cellular transformation. It includes up-regulation of HIF and subsequent transcriptional induction of LOX and LOXL2, which repress E-cadherin and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

Lysyl oxidases could be an attractive molecular target for cancers of epithelial origin, in particular because they are partly extracellular. Constant availability of molecular oxygen is crucial for the structure and function of any mammalian cell. Therefore, cellular responses to reduced oxygen tensions (hypoxia) play an important role in development and many aspects of physiological homeostasis. Many important disease processes, including ischemic vascular diseases and cancer, involve reduced tissue oxygenation, and cellular adaptation to this is implicated in disease progression and clinical outcome. The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) 2The abbreviations used are: HIFhypoxia-inducible transcription factorHREhypoxia response elementRCCrenal cell carcinomaEMTepithelial to mesenchymal transitionECMextracellular matrixDP2,2′-dipyridylβ-APNβ-aminopropionitrileBCSbathocuproinedisulfonic acidsiRNAsmall interfering RNADAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. is a central mechanism responding to low cellular oxygenation and mediates a variety of systemic and local adaptive responses, including the control of red cell production, regulation of angiogenesis, modulation of vascular tone, enhancement of glycolysis, and cellular glucose uptake (for a review, see Refs. 1.Semenza G.L.

HIF consists of a heterodimer of α- and β-subunits, both being basic helix-loop-helix-Per Arnt Sim domain proteins. Whereas HIFβ is constitutively expressed, HIFα subunits are unstable and inversely correlated to the availability of molecular oxygen. At least two oxygen-regulated isoforms of HIFα have been identified, HIF-1α and HIF-2α, sharing a high degree of sequence homology and a similar domain structure (4.O'Rourke J.F. Tian Y.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Pugh C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2060-2071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Regulation of HIF is primarily governed by oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of its HIFα subunits, which influences protein stability and transcriptional activity. Growth and behavior of tumor cells is strongly dependent on their microenvironment, where hypoxia is both a stress factor and an important signal (for a review, see Refs. 5.Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar and 6.Harris A.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar). Dating back to 1927, Otto Warburg had already described that tumor cells have a much increased utilization of the glycolytic pathway (7.Warburg O. Wind F. Negelein E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1927; 8: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). Since then, a number of studies have established that indeed HIF is necessary to activate glycolysis in tumor cells in order to maintain energy homeostasis (8.Seagroves T.N. Ryan H.E. Lu H. Wouters B.G. Knapp M. Thibault P. Laderoute K. Johnson R.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3436-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 9.Semenza G.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2007; 39: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Accordingly, most (but not all) experimental studies have demonstrated that HIF is a growth-promoting mechanism for tumors (10.Pouysségur J. Dayan F. Mazure N.M. Nature. 2006; 441: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar, 11.Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In human solid tumors, HIFα subunits are regionally stabilized in response to microenvironmental stimulation, of which hypoxia would presumably be the most important stimulus (first described in Refs. 12.Zhong H. De Marzo A.M. Laughner E. Lim M. Hilton D.A. Zagzag D. Buechler P. Isaacs W.B. Semenza G.L. Simons J.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5830-5835PubMed Google Scholar and 13.Talks K.L. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Harris A.L. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the majority of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), HIFα subunits are globally stabilized (14.Wiesener M.S. Münchenhagen P.M. Berger I. Morgan N.V. Roigas J. Schwiertz A. Jürgensen J.S.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2957-2961PubMed Google Scholar), which is the result of biallelic inactivation of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. The VHL gene product has previously been shown to be part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex targeting HIFα subunits for degradation (16.Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J.

Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 680s-684sCrossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Importantly, the VHL-associated HIF activation not only seems to be relevant for tumor growth in RCC but also plays a dominant role in tumorigenesis. HIFα is activated in the earliest renal lesions of the familial VHL syndrome (18.Mandriota S.J. Turner K.J. Davies D.R. Murray P.G. Morgan N.V. Sowter H.M. Wykoff C.C. Maher E.R. Harris A.L. Ratcliffe P.J. Maxwell P.H. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 459-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) and seems to be the decisive factor for growth initiation of experimental RCCs, where HIF-2α plays the dominant role over HIF-1α (19.Maranchie J.K.

Further to the unique role of the VHL/HIF axis, RCCs show a typical clinical feature, which is resistance to established forms of therapy with radiation and chemotherapy and a high rate of metastasis at diagnosis (24.Cohen R.B. Cohen E.P. Cancer and the Kidney. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2005: 201-226Google Scholar). To date, it can only be speculated whether these features are linked to each other. However, extensive data has accumulated which points toward hypoxia-driven dedifferentiation of tumor cells, which could lead to the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to enhanced invasion and metastasis (25.Sullivan R. Graham C.H. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 26.Axelson H. Fredlund E. Ovenberger M. Landberg G. Påhlman S. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Clinically, this has been suspected for a long time, because severely hypoxic tumors have been described to be more aggressive and less responsive to therapy (27.Vaupel P. Mayer A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 28.Brown J.M. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1408-1416PubMed Google Scholar). The process of EMT is characterized by a complex dedifferentiation program, where epithelial cells lose their polarity and epithelial surface markers and induce the expression of mesenchymal markers, resulting in fibroblast-like and motile phenotypic cells (29.Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5366) Google Scholar, 30.Grünert S. Jechlinger M. Beug H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In general, the invasive and metastatic phenotype is associated with down-regulation of E-cadherin expression, a hallmark of EMT (31.Behrens J. Mareel M.M. Van Roy F.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2435-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), being a mediator and indicator of EMT, simultaneously. Several mechanisms like genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional changes have been implicated in the regulation of E-cadherin expression during tumor progression (32.Peinado H. Olmeda D. Cano A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 415-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). Importantly, recent studies have shown that E-cadherin expression can depend on the VHL status of cells, where hypoxic incubation was able to suppress E-cadherin protein expression (33.Imai T. Horiuchi A. Wang C. Oka K. Ohira S. Nikaido T. Konishi I. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1437-1447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 34.Esteban M.A. Tran M.G. Harten S.K.

Okuyama H. Baek J.H. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2725-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), confirming a hypothesis that was previously formulated (36.Beavon I.R. Mol. Pathol. 1999; 52: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These data indicate that VHL and/or HIF are capable of regulating E-cadherin, possibly influencing the process of EMT. The mechanism by which hypoxia and/or HIF represses E-cadherin expression is less clear, because a number of different pathways have been suggested. The HIF target gene lysyl oxidase (LOX) has been implicated in involvement in E-cadherin regulation. LOX has been drawn as one of the highest regulated genes from numerous gene arrays searching for novel HIF-regulated genes, performed by us and others (37.Wang V. Davis D.A. Haque M. Huang L.E. Yarchoan R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3299-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 38.Elvidge G.P. Glenny L. Appelhoff R.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Ragoussis J. Gleadle J.M. J. Biol.

Eckardt K.U. Wiesener M.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 2016-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Importantly, LOX has been shown to be a direct target of HIF-1, which is functionally required for hypoxia-induced metastasis (40.Erler J.T. Bennewith K.L. Nicolau M. Dornhöfer N. Kong C. Le Q.T. Chi J.T. Jeffrey S.S. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 2006; 440: 1222-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the lysyl oxidases LOX and LOX-like 2 (LOXL2) have been shown to physically interact with Snail, an important repressor of E-cadherin, which might influence Snail activity (41.Peinado H. Del Carmen Iglesias-de la Cruz M. Olmeda D. Csiszar K. Fong K.S. Vega S. Nieto M.A. Cano A. Portillo F. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3446-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Lysyl oxidases are a family of copper-dependent amine oxidases, catalyzing the covalent cross-link of the component side chains of collagen and those of elastin, thus stabilizing these proteins in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Four LOX-like (LOXL) proteins have been described so far, with varying degrees of similarity to LOX. Interestingly, the lysyl oxidases seem to carry additional functions beyond ECM stabilization, because they were found not only in the extracellular compartment but also in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, influencing proliferation and transformation between the normal and the malignant phenotype (for a review, see Refs. 42.Payne S.L. Hendrix M.J. Kirschmann D.A. J. Cell Biochem. 2007; 101: 1338-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar and 43.Lucero H.A. Kagan H.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2304-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). LOX and LOXL2 have been demonstrated to be highly expressed in many human cancers, partly and adversely in correlation to clinical outcome (42.Payne S.L. Hendrix M.J. Kirschmann D.A. J. Cell Biochem. 2007; 101: 1338-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In our study, we have investigated the role of LOX and LOXL2 in hypoxic repression of E-cadherin. We demonstrate that LOXL2 is also a direct HIF-1 target gene and that induction of lysyl oxidases is necessary and sufficient to repress E-cadherin in hypoxia. Our data provide experimental confirmation of a hypothesis that has been recently suggested, spanning a molecular pathway from hypoxia to HIF and lysyl oxidases, which is essential for E-cadherin repression (10.Pouysségur J. Dayan F. Mazure N.M. Nature. 2006; 441: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar) and which may be most relevant for development and progression of RCC. Hep3B, HEK293, and HeLa cells were from the European Cell Collection. The following cell lines were kind gifts from different investigators: HKC-8 (L. Racusen, Baltimore, MD), A498 (P. Staller, Copenhagen, Denmark), RCC4 (P. Ratcliffe, Oxford, UK), RCC10 (T. Acker, Frankfurt, Germany). The last three were VHL-deficient RCC cell lines and were analyzed in parallel with stably reconstituted lines. All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (all from PAA) to subconfluence and exposed to either normoxia or hypoxia (1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2) for the indicated time points. Hypoxic incubations were performed in an “invivo400” hypoxic workbench (Ruskinn Technology Ltd., West Yorkshire, UK). Reagents used to treat cells were 2,2′-dipyridyl (DP) (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) and dimethyloxaloylglycine (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany). β-Aminopropionitrile (β-APN), bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS), d-penicillamine, and cobalt chloride (CoCl2) were from Sigma. Tissues were from a historical collection (14.Wiesener M.S. Münchenhagen P.M. Berger I. Morgan N.V. Roigas J. Schwiertz A. Jürgensen J.S. Gruber G. Maxwell P.H. Löning S.A. Frei U. Maher E.R.

Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before nephrectomy. The collection of human tissues was approved by the local ethics committee. For mRNA knockdown, the following sequences were used at 100 nm (Eurogentec, Bruxelles, Belgium): HIF-1α, 5′-GCCACUUCGAAGUAGUGCUTT-3′; HIF-1α.2, 5′-CUGAUGACCAGCAACUUGATT-3′; HIF-2α, 5′-GCGACAGCUGGAGUAUGAATT-3′; HIF-2α.2, 5′-CAGCAUCUUUGAUAGCAGTT-3′; LOX, 5′-GACUGCCAGUGGAUUGAUATT-3′; LOXL2, 5′-GCGGGCUCUUAAACAACCATT-3′; LOXL2.1, 5′-GGCAAUGAGAAGUCCAUUATT-3′; LOXL2.2, 5′-GAAUCCGAUUACUCCAACATT-3′. As a negative control, we used an siRNA targeting green fluorescence protein, 5′-GGUGUGCUGUUUGGAGGUCTT-3′. Cells were transfected with the siRNAs at 50% confluence by the use of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were homogenized into extraction buffer (7 m urea, 10% glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride, Complete Mini EDTA-free) using a T8 Ultra-Turrax homogenizer (IKA, Staufen, Germany) for 10 s at full speed. Extracts were quantified using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore, Bedford, MA) overnight in blotting buffer (10 mm Tris, 100 mm glycine, 10% methanol, 0.05% SDS). Membranes were blocked with 3% fat-free dried milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with monoclonal antibodies against E-cadherin (0.2 μg/ml; clone HECD-1, Abcam (Cambridge, UK)), HIF-1α (1 μg/ml; clone 54 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY)), and β-actin (0.48 ng/ml; clone AC-15 (Sigma)) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse antibodies (0.5 ng/ml; DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark)). Signals were visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce). The displayed results are representative data of independent experiments. The pGL2/LOXL2 reporter construct, including a 502-bp fragment of the first intron of the LOXL2 gene (nucleotides +1758 to +2260; accession number NT_023666) was generated, amplified from human genomic DNA (forward primer, 5′-cgacgcgtaaattgagtctcacta-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ggaagatcttgtcagccaatgtgtg-3′ (generated MluI and BglII restriction sites are underlined) and cloned in the pGL2 promoter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). For sequential analysis of the three putative hypoxia response elements, site-directed mutagenesis was performed, generating the plasmids pGL2/LOXL2-mut1–3. For mutagenesis, the following primers were used: LOXL2-Bmut1, 5′-cgcTTTtttgtgtatgcatgtgtg-3′; LOXL2-Bmut1′, 5′-aaaAAAgcgcgcgtgcacacacag-3′; LOXL2-Bmut2, 5′-ggcTTTtgtgtgtgcacgcaat-3′; LOXL2-Bmut2′, 5′-acaAAAgcccgcgcacacacacc-3′; LOXL2-Bmut3, 5′-atgtgtgcTTTtgtgtatatgtatatgtgt-3′; LOXL2-Bmut3′, 5′-atatacacaAAAgcacacatgcgtgcaca-3′. For luciferase reporter assays cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected at a confluence of ∼50–60% with 0.3 μg of the LOXL2 luciferase reporter plasmids or 0.1 μg of the E-cadherin reporter plasmids and 0.1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase expression vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using jetPei transfection reagent (Polyplus, New York, NY) for HEK-293 cells or FuGene HD reagent (Roche Applied Science) for HKC-8, following the manufacturer's instructions. One day after transfection, cells were stimulated with hypoxia for 24 h. For HIF-1 overexpression, 50 ng of the expression plasmids HIF-1α and HIF-1β or an equimolar amount of the empty pcDNA3 vector was co-transfected. For RNA knockdown, cells were transfected with siRNAs as described above the day before reporter transfection. Luciferase activities were determined using luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and normalized to β-galactosidase expression. For 48-h overexpression of lysyl oxidases, cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes or on glass slides and transfected with FuGene HD (Roche Applied Science) with 10 μg of pcDNA-hLOX or pcDNA-hLOXL2-FLAG. RCC10 and RCC10/VHL cells were grown on glass slides to subconfluence and exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 48 h. 3% paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies to E-cadherin (Abcam) (clone HECD-1, 0.2 μg/ml), FLAG tag (Stratagene) (clone M2, 4 μg/ml), and ZO-1 (Invitrogen) (2.5 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Actin staining was performed with phalloidin-FluoroProbe 547 (0.164 nmol/ml; Interchim (Montlucon, France)). Cells were incubated with fluorescent dye-labeled secondary antibodies (AlexaFluor 488 or AlexaFluor 584; 0.4 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) at room temperature for 1 h. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (6.5 μg/ml; Invitrogen) for 1 h. Cells were mounted at 4 °C with Mowiol (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Images of cells were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescence microscope (Düsseldorf, Germany) and a CCD camera (SPOT RT KE/SE, Visitron Systems (Puchheim, Germany)), using the Spot Advanced 4.6 software (Visitron Systems). For analysis of mRNA expression, cells were exposed to hypoxia or stimulated with hypoxia mimetics 16 h before total RNA was prepared using RNazol B (Biozol, Eching, Germany). 32P-Labeled antisense RNA probes were transcribed with SP6 or T7 polymerase from plasmids containing cDNA fragments of human HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and U6 small nuclear RNA (U6sn), as described (44.Wiesener M.S. Turley H. Allen W.E. Willam C. Eckardt K.U. Talks K.L. Wood S.M. Gatter K.C. Harris A.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Maxwell P.H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For lysyl oxidases, probes were generated in pcDNA3 (LOX, accession number NM_002317, nucleotides 805–990; LOXL2, accession number NM_002318, nucleotides 1049–1213). Displayed results are representative data of independent experiments. Two independent chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using the Upstate protocol (Millipore). Cells were sonicated in 15-s on/off pulses for a total of 12 min (Bioruptor, Diagenode). Chromatin was immunoprecipitated using rabbit polyclonal antiserum to HIF-1α (PM14), which has previously been shown to perform well in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and to be highly specific for HIF-1α (45.Lau K.W. Tian Y.M. Raval R.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Pugh C.W. Br. J. Cancer. 2007; 96: 1284-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Preimmune serum was used as a negative control. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was amplified using the Sigma whole genome amplification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time quantitative PCR for DNA quantification employed SYBR Green gene expression assays on a StepOne thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Normalization was to β-actin DNA, and -fold enrichment at each locus was calculated using the ΔΔCt method. For the quantitative PCR, the following primers were used: β-actin-fw, 5′-accatggatgatgatatcgcc-3′; β-actin-rev, 5′-gccttgcacatgccgg-3′; LOXL2-fw, 5′-cacacatacacgtgcacaca-3′; LOXL2-rev, 5′-aggctctccccaaggaaat-3′. Recombinant protein for HIF-1α and HIF-1β was generated by in vitro transcription and translation using the TNT® quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) and incubated with a 32P-labeled 24-bp LOXL2 HRE1 wild type (sense strand, 5′-gcacgcgcgcacgtttgtgtatgc-3′) and the LOXL2-mut1 (sense strand, 5′-gcatacacaaacgtgcgcgcgtgc-3′) oligonucleotide probe. For supershift assays, anti-HIF-1α antibody (clone 54, Transduction Laboratories; 750 ng) was added, and reactions were incubated for 20 min on ice before electrophoresis. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described (16.Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4025) Google Scholar). Collagen gel was prepared by mixing calf skin type I collagen G (Serva Electrophoresis GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) and rat tail type I collagen R (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) at a ratio of 1:1. 0.1 volume of sodium bicarbonate (22 mg/ml) and 0.1 volume of 10× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were added, and the solution was neutralized with sodium hydroxide. Aliquots of 1.2 ml were allowed to gelatinize in 6-well culture dishes at 37 °C. 5 × 104 tumor cells were directly seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum onto the collagen surfaces. Cells invading the collagen gel were detected by focusing down into the matrix and quantified by counting 20 optical fields/well (31.Behrens J. Mareel M.M. Van Roy F.M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2435-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) 3 days after seeding. For inhibition of lysyl oxidases, assays were performed in the presence of β-APN. For lysyl oxidase knockdown, cells were transfected with siRNAs as described above 24 h before seeding on collagen I gel. Statistical analysis was performed using the two-sided Student's t test. Statistical significance was presumed at a value of <0.05. The cell line RCC10 (46.Krieg M. Haas R. Brauch H. Acker T. Flamme I. Plate K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5435-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) has been studied in the context of VHL-dependent E-cadherin regulation before (34.Esteban M.A. Tran M.G. Harten S.K. Hill P. Castellanos M.C. Chandra A. Raval R. O'brien T.S. Maxwell P.H. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3567-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the results of immunofluorescent staining for different markers of EMT in RCC10 cells, which are either defective (RCC10) or reconstituted for VHL (RCC10/VHL). Since the reconstituted cells show hypoxic inducibility for HIF and its target genes, we studied RCC10/VHL cells also in normoxia and hypoxia. As reported previously, the VHL status of the cells strongly determines the expression of E-cadherin, with no detectable signal in VHL-deficient cells and marked membranous expression in VHL-reconstituted cells. After 36 h of hypoxia (1% O2), E-cadherin expression in RCC10/VHL cells was completely abolished (Fig. 1, top panels). Similar results were found for other markers of EMT, actin stress fibers and ZO-1 (zonular occludens protein-1). RCC10/VHL cells showed only a moderate amount of actin stress fibers in normoxia, but a clear increase occurred after incubation in hypoxia (Fig. 1, middle panels). In contrast, VHL-deficient RCC10 cells displayed high levels of actin stress fibers already in normoxia. Similarly, ZO-1 expression, a marker for epithelial differentiation, showed a clear dependence for VHL and hypoxia (Fig. 1, lower panels). ZO-1 was strongly expressed in normoxic RCC10/VHL, where specific staining appeared as a continuous membranous pattern. In contrast, VHL-deficient RCC10 cells displayed weaker and irregular membranous expression. In hypoxic RCC10/VHL cells, the expression of ZO-1 could be significantly reduced, and discontinuous membranous staining appeared. Furthermore, RCC10 cells showed clear morphological differences between the VHL-deficient and VHL-reconstituted cell lines, which is best seen in the ZO-1 staining (Fig. 1, lower panels). Cells lacking VHL displayed a spindel-like, fibroblastoid cell shape. In contrast, VHL-reconstituted RCC10 cells showed an epitheloid cell morphology with a typical cobblestone appearance. Taken together, these findings are compatible with the process of EMT, induced by hypoxia and VHL deficiency. However, this feature is not complete because fibronectin and vimentin staining did not display these changes (data not shown). Because both VHL and hypoxia are dominant regulators of the transcription factor HIF, we were interested in identifying putative HIF target genes that could mediate cellular transformation by an Affymetrix gene array in Hep3B cells (39.Warnecke C. Weidemann A. Volke M. Schietke R. Wu X. Knaup K.X. Hackenbeck T. Bernhardt W. Willam C. Eckardt K.U. Wiesener M.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 2016-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This array identified two lysyl oxidases to be highly induced by HIF, LOX and a related protein, LOXL2 (LOX-like 2), which have been implicated in regulation of E-cadherin (see Introduction and Ref. 10.Pouysségur J. Dayan F. Mazure N.M. Nature. 2006; 441: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). LOX and LOXL2 were induced 13- and 7.5-fold, respectively, in comparison with the untreated control. Importantly, HIF-1α siRNA reduced the expression of both lysyl oxidases significantly (Fig. 2A). We next aimed for verification of the array data by the specific and quantitative RNase protection assay for both genes. Samples from Hep3B and HeLa cells confirmed the regulation (Fig. 2B). Exposure of the cells to hypoxia (1% O2) or tre"
https://openalex.org/W2153977089,"Gamma-frequency oscillations depend on phasic synaptic GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R)-mediated inhibition to synchronize spike timing. The spillover of synaptically released GABA can also activate extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs, and such tonic inhibition may also contribute to modulating network dynamics. In many neuronal cell types, tonic inhibition is mediated by delta subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs. We found that the frequency of in vitro cholinergically induced gamma oscillations in the mouse hippocampal CA3 region was increased by the activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) on interneurons. The NMDAR-dependent increase of gamma oscillation frequency was counteracted by the tonic inhibition of the interneurons mediated by delta subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs. Recordings of synaptic currents during gamma activity revealed that NMDAR-mediated increases in oscillation frequency correlated with a progressive synchronization of phasic excitation and inhibition in the network. Thus, the balance between tonic excitation and tonic inhibition of interneurons may modulate gamma frequency by shaping interneuronal synchronization."

We used simultaneous adaptive optics imaging and psychophysical testing to measure cone spacing and resolution across the fovea, and found that resolution was limited by cone spacing only at the foveal center. Immediately outside of the center, resolution was worse than cone spacing predicted and better matched the sampling limit of midget retinal ganglion cells."
https://openalex.org/W2136384158,"Cold is a limiting environmental factor that adversely affects plant growth and productivity. Calcium/calmodulin-mediated signaling is believed to play a pivotal role in plant response to cold stress, but its exact role is not clearly understood. Here, we report that CRLK1, a novel calcium/calmodulin-regulated receptor-like kinase, is crucial for cold tolerance in plants. CRLK1 has two calmodulin-binding sites with different affinities as follows: one located at residues 369–390 with a Kd of 25 nm, and the other located at residues 28–112 with a Kd of 160 nm. Calcium/calmodulin stimulated the kinase activity, but the addition of chlorpromazine, a calmodulin antagonist, blocked its stimulation. CRLK1 is mainly localized in the plasma membrane, and its expression is stimulated by cold and hydrogen peroxide treatments. Under normal growth conditions, there is no noticeable phenotypic difference between wild-type and crlk1 knock-out mutant plants. However, as compared with wild-type plants, the crlk1 knock-out mutants exhibited an increased sensitivity to chilling and freezing temperatures. Northern analysis showed that the induction of cold-responsive genes, including CBF1, RD29A, COR15a, and KIN1 in crlk1 mutants, is delayed as compared with wild-type plants. These results indicate that CRLK1 is a positive regulator of cold tolerance in plants.

IntroductionCold, a major environmental factor, affects plant growth and reduces productivity (1.Thomashow M.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar). It has been well documented that numerous cold-induced physiological and biochemical responses exist, including accumulation of reactive oxygen species, changes in membrane lipid composition, and the accumulation of compatible osmolytes (1.Thomashow M.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar, 2.Browse J. Xin Z. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cold acclimation also induces the expression of certain COR genes such as RD29A, COR15a, and KIN1, which function to stabilize membranes against freezing-induced injury (1.Thomashow M.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar). The CBF/DREB1- or CRT/DRE-binding factors, a family of closely related AP2/ERF transcription factors, play a major role in controlling the COR gene expression (3.Shinozaki K. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Seki M. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 410-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar), and CBFs themselves are activated by cold through ICE1 (4.Chinnusamy V. Ohta M. Kanrar S. Lee B.H.

A variety of stress signals, such as cold, high salt, and hydrogen peroxide, triggers rapid increases in Ca2+ levels in plant cells (11.Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R.

Intracellular free Ca2+ changes are recognized by Ca2+ receptors such as calcium-dependent protein kinases (10.Sanders D. Pelloux J. Brownlee C. Harper J.F.

Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 123-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Ca2+/CaM-mediated signaling via the phosphorylation cascade is crucial for regulating COR gene expression and cold acclimation (20.Tähtiharju S. Sangwan V. Monroy A.F. Dhindsa R.S. Borg M. Planta. 1997; 203: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 21.Townley H.E. Knight M.R. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1169-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22.Monroy A.F. Sarhan F. Dhindsa R.S. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1227-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the identity of the CaM-regulated protein kinase(s) involved in cold signal transduction.In the Arabidopsis genome, there are at least 600 receptor-like kinases (RLKs) representing nearly 2.5% of the annotated protein-coding genes. The RLKs resemble animal receptor kinases in that they have the general structure of an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane sequence, and an intracellular kinase domain. The function of most of the plant RLKs is not well understood (23.Shiu S.H. Bleecker A.B. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 530-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). It has been reported that CaM interacts with Brassica oleracea S locus receptor kinase (24.Vanoosthuyse V. Tichtinsky G. Dumas C. Gaude T. Cock J.M. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and Arabidopsis AtCaMRLK1 (25.Charpenteau M. Jaworski K. Ramirez B.C. Tretyn A. Ranjeva R. Ranty B. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but CaM has no effect on the activity of these kinases. Earlier, we characterized a CaM up-regulated cytoplasmic receptor-like kinase, but its function is not yet known (18.Yang T. Chaudhuri S. Yang L. Chen Y. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42552-42559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here, we report the isolation of a plant-specific, plasma membrane-anchored Ca2+/CaM-regulated RLK (CRLK1) from an Arabidopsis cold-stressed cDNA library. Characterization of the crlk1 null mutants and complementation lines suggests that CRLK1 confers freezing tolerance by acting as a positive regulator of COR gene expressions.DISCUSSIONOur results document that CRLK1 is a calcium/CaM-regulated RLK anchored in plasma membrane. Calcium/CaM binding to CRLK1 regulates its kinase activity and plays a critical role in cold acclimation in planta. It has been well documented that the cold-induced changes in intracellular Ca2+ level is critical for plants to fully acclimate and for maximal cold induction of some COR genes (11.Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that calcium/CaM-mediated signaling is involved in the cold induction of COR genes because CaM genes are themselves induced by low temperature (34.Polisensky D.H. Braam J. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 1271-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and CaM inhibitors have been shown to inhibit cold-induced COR expression (20.Tähtiharju S. Sangwan V. Monroy A.F. Dhindsa R.S. Borg M. Planta. 1997; 203: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Our results support that CaM acts as a positive regulator during cold acclimation. However, overexpression of CaM3 in Arabidopsis resulted in the inhibition of the COR expression, suggesting that this specific CaM gene may function as a negative regulator (21.Townley H.E. Knight M.R. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1169-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There are 11 CaM genes in Arabidopsis, some of which show spatial and temporal regulation in the cell (15.Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 505-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Hence, it cannot be generalized that all CaMs show similar response to cold.There are two CaM-binding sites in CRLK1. Although no significant role was detected for CaM binding to the N-terminal site on protein phosphorylation, we cannot exclude other roles for this binding. The mammalian epidermal growth factor receptor is a member of the CaM-binding receptor tyrosine kinase family with a CaM-binding site near the transmembrane domain. CaM regulates intracellular trafficking of epidermal growth factor receptor and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (35.Tebar F. Villalonga P. Sorkina T. Agell N. Sorkin A. Enrich C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2057-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to further dissect the function of the N-terminal CaM binding.CRLK1 is localized in the plasma membrane, which is required for its function in planta because the truncated form of CRLK1 lacking the transmembrane domain did not rescue the phenotype of crlk1 null mutants. In the Arabidopsis genome, out of 600 RLK genes, more than 200 RLKs have no receptor configuration, and very few of them have known functions (36.Shiu S.H. Bleecker A.B. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: re22PubMed Google Scholar). Tomato Pto protein kinase, which confers resistance to the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, is a cytoplasmic RLK without an extracellular domain and transmembrane domain. Pto is activated by avrPto, a small peptide secreted by P. syringae (37.Tang X. Frederick R.D. Zhou J. Halterman D.A. Jia Y. Martin G.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2060-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Thus, even though CRLK1 has no receptor configuration, it could function directly in transducing an extracellular signal into cells in a manner similar to Pto, as well as playing a role in transducing the Ca2+/CaM-mediated signal triggered by stress. Alternatively, CRLK1 may form a dimer or oligomer with an RLK(s) with receptor configuration to recognize an extracellular ligand(s) or interact with other membrane protein(s) similar to TAK1. TAK1, a thylakoid membrane protein kinase without a receptor configuration, is required for light harvesting by phosphorylating the light-harvesting complex proteins in the thylakoid membrane (38.Snyders S. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9137-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Isolation of CRLK1-interacting proteins/substrates will help in further dissecting this signal pathway. Accumulating evidence indicates that protein phosphorylation is involved in the pathway connecting the cold-triggered calcium changes and cold acclimation (22.Monroy A.F. Sarhan F. Dhindsa R.S. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1227-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 39.Monroy A.F. Dhindsa R.S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 321-331PubMed Google Scholar). However, the protein kinase(s) responsible for inducing cold-regulated genes and activating freezing tolerance is elusive. Our results suggest that calcium/CaM/CRLK1-regulated phosphorylation can be an important signal node in the cold signal transduction pathway.Identification of CRLK1 as a Ca2+/CaM-regulated protein kinase lays the groundwork for improving plant stress tolerance. In recent years, we have been able to define the structure/function relationships of Ca2+/CaM-binding proteins by manipulating their Ca2+ and/or CaM-binding sites (40.Yang T. Du L. Poovaiah B.W. Funct. Plant Biol. 2007; 34: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For example, altered Ca2+/CaM binding to DWF1 documented the possibility of producing size-engineered plants (6.Du L. Poovaiah B.W. Nature. 2005; 437: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), although altered Ca2+ and Ca2+/CaM binding to chimeric calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase produces spontaneous nodulation (7.Gleason C. Chaudhuri S. Yang T. Muñoz A. Poovaiah B.W. Oldroyd G.E. Nature. 2006; 441: 1149-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Recently, we characterized the CaM-binding transcription factor AtSR1, which doses the salicylic acid level and regulates plant immunity (41.Du L. Ali G.S. Simons K.A. Hou J. Yang T. Reddy A.S.

Redesigning CRLK1 orthologs in crop plants by manipulating their CaM-binding sites will help to enhance their ability to respond to the stress signal and to engineer stress-tolerant crops. IntroductionCold, a major environmental factor, affects plant growth and reduces productivity (1.Thomashow M.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar). It has been well documented that numerous cold-induced physiological and biochemical responses exist, including accumulation of reactive oxygen species, changes in membrane lipid composition, and the accumulation of compatible osmolytes (1.Thomashow M.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar, 2.Browse J. Xin Z. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cold acclimation also induces the expression of certain COR genes such as RD29A, COR15a, and KIN1, which function to stabilize membranes against freezing-induced injury (1.Thomashow M.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar). The CBF/DREB1- or CRT/DRE-binding factors, a family of closely related AP2/ERF transcription factors, play a major role in controlling the COR gene expression (3.Shinozaki K. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Seki M. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 410-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar), and CBFs themselves are activated by cold through ICE1 (4.Chinnusamy V. Ohta M. Kanrar S. Lee B.H.

A variety of stress signals, such as cold, high salt, and hydrogen peroxide, triggers rapid increases in Ca2+ levels in plant cells (11.Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R.

However, little is known about the identity of the CaM-regulated protein kinase(s) involved in cold signal transduction.In the Arabidopsis genome, there are at least 600 receptor-like kinases (RLKs) representing nearly 2.5% of the annotated protein-coding genes. The RLKs resemble animal receptor kinases in that they have the general structure of an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane sequence, and an intracellular kinase domain. The function of most of the plant RLKs is not well understood (23.Shiu S.H. Bleecker A.B. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 530-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). It has been reported that CaM interacts with Brassica oleracea S locus receptor kinase (24.Vanoosthuyse V. Tichtinsky G. Dumas C. Gaude T. Cock J.M.

J. 2004; 379: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but CaM has no effect on the activity of these kinases. Earlier, we characterized a CaM up-regulated cytoplasmic receptor-like kinase, but its function is not yet known (18.Yang T. Chaudhuri S. Yang L. Chen Y. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol.

Here, we report the isolation of a plant-specific, plasma membrane-anchored Ca2+/CaM-regulated RLK (CRLK1) from an Arabidopsis cold-stressed cDNA library. Characterization of the crlk1 null mutants and complementation lines suggests that CRLK1 confers freezing tolerance by acting as a positive regulator of COR gene expressions. Cold, a major environmental factor, affects plant growth and reduces productivity (1.Thomashow M.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Characterization of the crlk1 null mutants and complementation lines suggests that CRLK1 confers freezing tolerance by acting as a positive regulator of COR gene expressions. DISCUSSIONOur results document that CRLK1 is a calcium/CaM-regulated RLK anchored in plasma membrane. Calcium/CaM binding to CRLK1 regulates its kinase activity and plays a critical role in cold acclimation in planta. It has been well documented that the cold-induced changes in intracellular Ca2+ level is critical for plants to fully acclimate and for maximal cold induction of some COR genes (11.Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that calcium/CaM-mediated signaling is involved in the cold induction of COR genes because CaM genes are themselves induced by low temperature (34.Polisensky D.H. Braam J. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 1271-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and CaM inhibitors have been shown to inhibit cold-induced COR expression (20.Tähtiharju S. Sangwan V. Monroy A.F. Dhindsa R.S. Borg M. Planta. 1997; 203: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Our results support that CaM acts as a positive regulator during cold acclimation. However, overexpression of CaM3 in Arabidopsis resulted in the inhibition of the COR expression, suggesting that this specific CaM gene may function as a negative regulator (21.Townley H.E. Knight M.R. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1169-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There are 11 CaM genes in Arabidopsis, some of which show spatial and temporal regulation in the cell (15.Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 505-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Hence, it cannot be generalized that all CaMs show similar response to cold.There are two CaM-binding sites in CRLK1. Although no significant role was detected for CaM binding to the N-terminal site on protein phosphorylation, we cannot exclude other roles for this binding. The mammalian epidermal growth factor receptor is a member of the CaM-binding receptor tyrosine kinase family with a CaM-binding site near the transmembrane domain. CaM regulates intracellular trafficking of epidermal growth factor receptor and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (35.Tebar F. Villalonga P. Sorkina T. Agell N. Sorkin A. Enrich C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2057-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to further dissect the function of the N-terminal CaM binding.CRLK1 is localized in the plasma membrane, which is required for its function in planta because the truncated form of CRLK1 lacking the transmembrane domain did not rescue the phenotype of crlk1 null mutants. In the Arabidopsis genome, out of 600 RLK genes, more than 200 RLKs have no receptor configuration, and very few of them have known functions (36.Shiu S.H. Bleecker A.B. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: re22PubMed Google Scholar). Tomato Pto protein kinase, which confers resistance to the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, is a cytoplasmic RLK without an extracellular domain and transmembrane domain. Pto is activated by avrPto, a small peptide secreted by P. syringae (37.Tang X. Frederick R.D. Zhou J. Halterman D.A. Jia Y. Martin G.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2060-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Thus, even though CRLK1 has no receptor configuration, it could function directly in transducing an extracellular signal into cells in a manner similar to Pto, as well as playing a role in transducing the Ca2+/CaM-mediated signal triggered by stress. Alternatively, CRLK1 may form a dimer or oligomer with an RLK(s) with receptor configuration to recognize an extracellular ligand(s) or interact with other membrane protein(s) similar to TAK1. TAK1, a thylakoid membrane protein kinase without a receptor configuration, is required for light harvesting by phosphorylating the light-harvesting complex proteins in the thylakoid membrane (38.Snyders S. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9137-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).

Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1227-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 39.Monroy A.F. Dhindsa R.S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 321-331PubMed Google Scholar). However, the protein kinase(s) responsible for inducing cold-regulated genes and activating freezing tolerance is elusive. Our results suggest that calcium/CaM/CRLK1-regulated phosphorylation can be an important signal node in the cold signal transduction pathway. Identification of CRLK1 as a Ca2+/CaM-regulated protein kinase lays the groundwork for improving plant stress tolerance. In recent years, we have been able to define the structure/function relationships of Ca2+/CaM-binding proteins by manipulating their Ca2+ and/or CaM-binding sites (40.Yang T. Du L. Poovaiah B.W. Funct. Plant Biol. 2007; 34: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For example, altered Ca2+/CaM binding to DWF1 documented the possibility of producing size-engineered plants (6.Du L. Poovaiah B.W. Nature. 2005; 437: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), although altered Ca2+ and Ca2+/CaM binding to chimeric calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase produces spontaneous nodulation (7.Gleason C. Chaudhuri S. Yang T. Muñoz A. Poovaiah B.W. Oldroyd G.E. Nature. 2006; 441: 1149-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Recently, we characterized the CaM-binding transcription factor AtSR1, which doses the salicylic acid level and regulates plant immunity (41.Du L. Ali G.S. Simons K.A. Hou J. Yang T. Reddy A.S. Poovaiah B.W. Nature. 2009; 457: 1154-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2060955024,"Changes in whole body energy levels are closely linked to alterations in body weight and bone mass. Here, we show that hypothalamic signals contribute to the regulation of bone mass in a manner consistent with the central perception of energy status. Mice lacking neuropeptide Y (NPY), a well-known orexigenic factor whose hypothalamic expression is increased in fasting, have significantly increased bone mass in association with enhanced osteoblast activity and elevated expression of bone osteogenic transcription factors, Runx2 and Osterix. In contrast, wild type and NPY knockout (NPY −/−) mice in which NPY is specifically over expressed in the hypothalamus (AAV-NPY+) show a significant reduction in bone mass despite developing an obese phenotype. The AAV-NPY+ induced loss of bone mass is consistent with models known to mimic the central effects of fasting, which also show increased hypothalamic NPY levels. Thus these data indicate that, in addition to well characterized responses to body mass, skeletal tissue also responds to the perception of nutritional status by the hypothalamus independently of body weight. In addition, the reduction in bone mass by AAV NPY+ administration does not completely correct the high bone mass phenotype of NPY −/− mice, indicating the possibility that peripheral NPY may also be an important regulator of bone mass. Indeed, we demonstrate the expression of NPY specifically in osteoblasts. In conclusion, these data identifies NPY as a critical integrator of bone homeostatic signals; increasing bone mass during times of obesity when hypothalamic NPY expression levels are low and reducing bone formation to conserve energy under ‘starving’ conditions, when hypothalamic NPY expression levels are high."
https://openalex.org/W2135445350,"A CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is displayed by a distinct subset of colorectal cancers with a high frequency of DNA hypermethylation in a specific group of CpG islands. Recent studies have shown that an activating mutation of BRAF (BRAF(V600E)) is tightly associated with CIMP, raising the question of whether BRAF(V600E) plays a causal role in the development of CIMP or whether CIMP provides a favorable environment for the acquisition of BRAF(V600E). We employed Illumina GoldenGate DNA methylation technology, which interrogates 1,505 CpG sites in 807 different genes, to further study this association. We first examined whether expression of BRAF(V600E) causes DNA hypermethylation by stably expressing BRAF(V600E) in the CIMP-negative, BRAF wild-type COLO 320DM colorectal cancer cell line. We determined 100 CIMP-associated CpG sites and examined changes in DNA methylation in eight stably transfected clones over multiple passages. We found that BRAF(V600E) is not sufficient to induce CIMP in our system. Secondly, considering the alternative possibility, we identified genes whose DNA hypermethylation was closely linked to BRAF(V600E) and CIMP in 235 primary colorectal tumors. Interestingly, genes that showed the most significant link include those that mediate various signaling pathways implicated in colorectal tumorigenesis, such as BMP3 and BMP6 (BMP signaling), EPHA3, KIT, and FLT1 (receptor tyrosine kinases) and SMO (Hedgehog signaling). Furthermore, we identified CIMP-dependent DNA hypermethylation of IGFBP7, which has been shown to mediate BRAF(V600E)-induced cellular senescence and apoptosis. Promoter DNA hypermethylation of IGFBP7 was associated with silencing of the gene. CIMP-specific inactivation of BRAF(V600E)-induced senescence and apoptosis pathways by IGFBP7 DNA hypermethylation might create a favorable context for the acquisition of BRAF(V600E) in CIMP+ colorectal cancer. Our data will be useful for future investigations toward understanding CIMP in colorectal cancer and gaining insights into the role of aberrant DNA hypermethylation in colorectal tumorigenesis."

We have developed and validated a system of Grapevine Molecular Networks (VitisNet).The sequences from the Vitis vinifera (cv. Pinot Noir PN40024) genome sequencing project and ESTs from the Vitis genus have been paired and the 39,424 resulting unique sequences have been manually annotated. Among these, 13,145 genes have been assigned to 219 networks. The pathway sets include 88 ""Metabolic"", 15 ""Genetic Information Processing"", 12 ""Environmental Information Processing"", 3 ""Cellular Processes"", 21 ""Transport"", and 80 ""Transcription Factors"". The quantitative data is loaded onto molecular networks, allowing the simultaneous visualization of changes in the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome for a given experiment.VitisNet uses manually annotated networks in SBML or XML format, enabling the integration of large datasets, streamlining biological functional processing, and improving the understanding of dynamic processes in systems biology experiments. VitisNet is grounded in the Vitis vinifera genome (currently at 8x coverage) and can be readily updated with subsequent updates of the genome or biochemical discoveries.

https://openalex.org/W2007283154,"Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the paradigm of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment; however, it also induces de novo DNA-hypermethylation, a process that may be involved in the development of drug-resistant phenotypes by inactivating genes required for drug-cytotoxicity. By using an expression microarray analysis, we aimed to identify those genes reactivated in a set of two cisplatin (CDDP) resistant and sensitive NSCLC cell lines after epigenetic treatment. Gene expression, promoter methylation and CDDP-chemoresponse were further analyzed in three matched sets of sensitive/resistant cell lines, 23 human cancer cell lines and 36 NSCLC specimens. Results revealed specific silencing by promoter hypermethylation of IGFBP-3 in CDDP resistant cells, whereas IGFBP-3 siRNA interference, induced resistance to CDDP in sensitive cells (P<0.001). In addition, we found a strong correlation between methylation status and CDDP response in tumor specimens (P<0.001). Thus, stage I patients, whose tumors harbor an unmethylated promoter, had a trend towards increased disease-free survival (DFS). We report that a loss of IGFBP-3 expression, mediated by promoter-hypermethylation, results in a reduction of tumor cell sensitivity to cisplatin in NSCLC. Basal methylation status of IGFBP-3 before treatment may be a clinical biomarker and a predictor of the chemotherapy outcome, helping to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from CDDP therapy alone or in combination with epigenetic treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1982343022,"Ubc9 is an E2-conjugating enzyme that transfers the activated small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to protein substrates, and thus it has an important function in sumoylation-mediated cellular pathways. We have earlier reported that Ubc9 promotes tumor growth in the xenograft mouse model using breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in part through regulation of Bcl-2 expression. In this study, we show that ectopic expression of wild-type Ubc9 (Ubc9-WT) promotes cell invasion and metastasis. Surprisingly, the dominant negative mutant Ubc9 (Ubc9-DN) also causes the same phenotype, indicating that the ability of Ubc9 to promote invasion and metastasis is distinct from its ability to conjugate SUMO to protein substrates. Of considerable interest, several microRNAs such as miR-224 are regulated by Ubc9. Although ectopic expression of Ubc9 causes downregulation of miR-224, suppression of Ubc9 by Ubc9-siRNAs leads to its upregulation. We further show that miR-224 can inhibit cell invasion and directly targets CDC42 and CXCR4, and that suppression of CDC42 and CXCR4 by RNAi causes inhibition of Ubc9-mediated invasion. Together, these results show a molecular link between Ubc9 and the metastasis genes such as CDC42 and CXCR4, and thus provide new insight into the mechanism by which Ubc9 promotes tumor invasion and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2076493325,"To define a functional role for the endosomal/lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L (Ctsl) during squamous carcinogenesis, we generated mice harboring a constitutive Ctsl deficiency in addition to epithelial expression of the human papillomavirus type 16 oncogenes (human cytokeratin 14 (K14)–HPV16). We found enhanced tumor progression and metastasis in the absence of Ctsl. As tumor progression in K14–HPV16 mice is dependent on inflammation and angiogenesis, we examined immune cell infiltration and vascularization without finding any effect of the Ctsl genotype. In contrast, keratinocyte-specific transgenic expression of cathepsin V, the human orthologue of mouse Ctsl, in otherwise Ctsl-deficient K14–HPV16 mice restored the phenotype observed in the control HPV16 skin. To better understand this phenotype at the molecular level, we measured several oncogenic signal transduction pathways in primary keratinocytes on stimulation with keratinocyte-conditioned cell culture medium. We found increased activation of protein kinase B/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in protease-deficient cells, especially if treated with media conditioned by Ctsl-deficient keratinocytes. Similarly, the level of active GTP-Ras was increased in Ctsl-deficient epidermis. We conclude that Ctsl is critical for the termination of growth factor signaling in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment of keratinocytes and, therefore, functions as an anti-tumor protease."
https://openalex.org/W2040499888,"Targeting Nrf2 signaling appears to be an attractive approach for the treatment of maladaptive cardiac remodeling and dysfunction; however, pharmacological modulation of the Nrf2 pathway in the cardiovascular system remains to be established. Herein, we report that a novel synthetic triterpenoid derivative, dihydro-CDDO-trifluoroethyl amide (dh404), activates Nrf2 and suppresses oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes. Dh404 interrupted the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ligase complex-mediated Nrf2 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation saturating the binding capacity of Keap1 to Nrf2, thereby rendering more Nrf2 to be translocated into the nuclei to activate Nrf2-driven gene transcription. A mutant Keap1 protein containing a single cysteine-to-serine substitution at residue 151 within the BTB domain of Keap1 was resistant to dh404-induced stabilization of Nrf2 protein. In addition, dh404 did not dissociate the interaction of Nrf2 with the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ligase complex. Thus, it is likely that dh404 inhibits the ability of Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ligase complex to target Nrf2 for ubiquitination and degradation via modifying Cys-151 of Keap1 to change the conformation of the complex. Moreover, dh404 was able to stabilize Nrf2 protein, to enhance Nrf2 nuclear translocation, to activate Nrf2-driven transcription, and to suppress angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes. Knockdown of Nrf2 almost blocked the anti-oxidative effect of dh404. Dh404 activated Nrf2 signaling in the heart. Taken together, dh404 appears to be a novel Nrf2 activator with a therapeutic potential for cardiac diseases via suppressing oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2100034650,"Prostate cancer (PCa) growth is dependent on androgens and on the androgen receptor (AR), which acts by modulating gene transcription. Tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) proteins (FKBP52, FKBP51 and Cyp40) interact with AR in PCa cells, suggesting roles in AR-mediated gene transcription and cell growth. We report here that FKBP51 and Cyp40, but not FKBP52, are significantly elevated in PCa tissues and in androgen-dependent (AD) and androgen-independent (AI) cell lines. Overexpression of FKBP51 in AD LNCaP cells increased AR transcriptional activity in the presence and absence of androgen, whereas siRNA knockdown of FKBP51 dramatically decreased AD gene transcription and proliferation. Knockdown of Cyp40 also inhibited androgen-mediated transcription and growth in LNCaP cells. However, disruption of FKBP51 and Cyp40 in AI C4-2 cells caused only a small reduction in proliferation, indicating that Cyp40 and FKBP51 predominantly regulate AD cell proliferation. Under knockdown conditions, the inhibitory effects of TPR ligands, cyclosporine A (CsA) and FK506, on AR activity were not observed, indicating that Cyp40 and FKBP51 are the targets of CsA and FK506, respectively. Our findings show that FKBP51 and Cyp40 are positive regulators of AR that can be selectively targeted by CsA and FK506 to achieve inhibition of androgen-induced cell proliferation. These proteins and their cognate ligands thus provide new strategies in the treatment of PCa."
https://openalex.org/W1988070199,"Background Disruption of the lymphatic vasculature causes edema, inflammation, and end-tissue destruction. To assess the therapeutic efficacy of systemic anti-inflammatory therapy in this disease, we examined the impact of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), ketoprofen, and of a soluble TNF-α receptor (sTNF-R1) upon tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α activity in a mouse model of acquired lymphedema. Methods and Findings Lymphedema was induced by microsurgical ablation of major lymphatic conduits in the murine tail. Untreated control mice with lymphedema developed significant edema and extensive histopathological inflammation compared to sham surgical controls. Short-term ketoprofen treatment reduced tail edema and normalized the histopathology while paradoxically increasing TNF-α gene expression and cytokine levels. Conversely, sTNF-R1 treatment increased tail volume, exacerbated the histopathology, and decreased TNF-α gene expression. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), which stimulates lymphangiogenesis, closely correlated with TNF-α expression. Conclusions Ketoprofen therapy reduces experimental post-surgical lymphedema, yet direct TNF-α inhibition does not. Reducing inflammation while preserving TNF-α activity appears to optimize the repair response. It is possible that the observed favorable responses, at least in part, are mediated through enhanced VEGF-C signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2140151361,"Background Experience can alter how objects are represented in the visual cortex. But experience can take different forms. It is unknown whether the kind of visual experience systematically alters the nature of visual cortical object representations. Methodology/Principal Findings We take advantage of different training regimens found to produce qualitatively different types of perceptual expertise behaviorally in order to contrast the neural changes that follow different kinds of visual experience with the same objects. Two groups of participants went through training regimens that required either subordinate-level individuation or basic-level categorization of a set of novel, artificial objects, called “Ziggerins”. fMRI activity of a region in the right fusiform gyrus increased after individuation training and was correlated with the magnitude of configural processing of the Ziggerins observed behaviorally. In contrast, categorization training caused distributed changes, with increased activity in the medial portion of the ventral occipito-temporal cortex relative to more lateral areas. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that the kind of experience with a category of objects can systematically influence how those objects are represented in visual cortex. The demands of prior learning experience therefore appear to be one factor determining the organization of activity patterns in visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2011053249,"Survival of the conceptus is dependent on continuous progesterone signaling in the maternal decidua but how this is achieved under conditions of oxidative stress that characterize early pregnancy is unknown. Using primary cultures, we show that modest levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase sumoylation in human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs), leading to enhanced modification and transcriptional inhibition of the progesterone receptor (PR). The ability of ROS to induce a sustained hypersumoylation response, or interfere with PR activity, was lost upon differentiation of HESCs into decidual cells. Hypersumoylation in response to modest levels of ROS requires activation of the JNK pathway. Although ROS-dependent JNK signaling is disabled on decidualization, the cells continue to mount a transcriptional response, albeit distinct from that observed in undifferentiated HESCs. We further show that attenuated JNK signaling in decidual cells is a direct consequence of altered expression of key pathway modulators, including induction of MAP kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP1). Overexpression of MKP1 dampens JNK signaling, prevents hypersumoylation, and maintains PR activity in undifferentiated HESCs exposed to ROS. Thus, JNK silencing uncouples ROS signaling from the SUMO conjugation pathway and maintains progesterone responses and cellular homeostasis in decidual cells under oxidative stress conditions imposed by pregnancy.—Leitao, B., Jones, M.

https://openalex.org/W2002178604,"Langerin is categorized as a C-type lectin selectively expressed in Langerhans cells, playing roles in the first line of defense against pathogens and in Birbeck granule formation. Although these functions are thought to be exerted through glycan-binding activity of the C-type carbohydrate recognition domain, sugar-binding properties of Langerin have not been fully elucidated in relation to its biological functions. Here, we investigated the glycan-binding specificity of Langerin using comprehensive glycoconjugate microarray, quantitative frontal affinity chromatography, and conventional cell biological analyses. Langerin showed outstanding affinity to galactose-6-sulfated oligosaccharides, including keratan sulfate, while it preserved binding activity to mannose, as a common feature of the C-type lectins with an EPN motif. By a mutagenesis study, Lys-299 and Lys-313 were found to form extended binding sites for sulfated glycans. Consistent with the former observation, the sulfated Langerin ligands were found to be expressed in brain and spleen, where the transcript of keratan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase is expressed. Moreover, such sulfated ligands were up-regulated in glioblastoma relative to normal brain tissues, and Langerin-expressing cells were localized in malignant brain tissues. Langerin also recognized pathogenic fungi, such as Candida and Malassezia, expressing heavily mannosylated glycans. These observations provide strong evidence that Langerin mediates diverse functions on Langerhans cells through dual recognition of sulfated as well as mannosylated glycans by its uniquely evolved C-type carbohydrate-recognition domain."
https://openalex.org/W2050239959,"Gpd1p is a cytosolic NAD(+)-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase that also localizes to peroxisomes and plays an essential role in the cellular response to osmotic stress and a role in redox balance. Here, we show that Gpd1p is directed to peroxisomes by virtue of an N-terminal type 2 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS2) in a Pex7p-dependent manner. Significantly, localization of Gpd1p to peroxisomes is dependent on the metabolic status of cells and the phosphorylation of aminoacyl residues adjacent to the targeting signal. Exposure of cells to osmotic stress induces changes in the subcellular distribution of Gpd1p to the cytosol and nucleus. This behavior is similar to Pnc1p, which is coordinately expressed with Gpd1p, and under conditions of cell stress changes its subcellular distribution from peroxisomes to the nucleus where it mediates chromatin silencing. Although peroxisomes are necessary for the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in yeast, the localization of Gpd1p to peroxisomes is not. Rather, shifts in the distribution of Gpd1p to different cellular compartments in response to changing cellular status suggests a role for Gpd1p in the spatial regulation of redox potential, a process critical to cell survival, especially under the complex stress conditions expected to occur in the wild."
https://openalex.org/W2100073813,"The nomenclature of lipoxygenases (LOXs) is partly based on the positional specificity of arachidonic acid oxygenation, but there is no unifying concept explaining the mechanistic basis of this enzyme property. According to the triad model, Phe-353, Ile-418, and Ile-593 of the rabbit 12/15-LOX form the bottom of the substrate-binding pocket, and introduction of less space-filling residues at either of these positions favors arachidonic acid 12-lipoxygenation. The present study was aimed at exploring the validity of the triad concept for two novel primate 12/15-LOX (Macaca mulatta and Pongo pygmaeus) and for five known members of the mammalian LOX family (human 12/15-LOX, mouse 12/15-LOX, human 15-LOX2, human platelet type 12-LOX, and mouse (12R)-LOX). The enzymes were expressed as N-terminal His tag fusion proteins in E. coli, the potential sequence determinants were mutated, and the specificity of arachidonic acid oxygenation was quantified. Taken together, our data indicate that the triad concept explains the positional specificity of all 12/15-LOXs tested (rabbit, human, M. mulatta, P. pygmaeus, and mouse). For the new enzymes of M. mulatta and P. pygmaeus, the concept had predictive value because the positional specificity predicted on the basis of the amino acid sequence was confirmed experimentally. The specificity of the platelet 12-LOX was partly explained by the triad hypothesis, but the concept was not applicable for 15-LOX2 and (12R)-LOX."

In this study, we show that infection with KHSV and ectopic expression of K13, but not its NF-kappaB-defective mutant, suppressed the expression of CXCR4. Suppression of CXCR4 by KSHV and K13 was associated with upregulated expression of miR-146a, a microRNA that is known to bind to the 3'-untranslated region of CXCR4 mRNA. Reporter studies identified two NF-kappaB sites in the promoter of miR-146a that were essential for its activation by K13. Accordingly, ectopic expression of K13, but not its NF-kappaB-defective mutant or other vFLIPs, strongly stimulated the miR-146a promoter activity, which could be blocked by specific genetic and pharmacological inhibitors of the NF-kappaB pathway. Finally, expression of CXCR4 was downregulated in clinical samples of KS and this was accompanied by an increased expression of miR-146a. Our results show that K13-induced NF-kappaB activity suppresses CXCR4 through upregulation of miR-146a. Downregulation of CXCR4 expression by K13 may contribute to KS development by promoting premature release of KSHV-infected endothelial progenitors into the circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2035364743,"The p53-inducible gene 3 (PIG3) is originally isolated as a p53 downstream target gene, but its function remains unknown. Here, we report a role of PIG3 in the activation of DNA damage checkpoints, after UV irradiation or radiomimetic drug neocarzinostatin (NCS). We show that depletion of endogenous PIG3 sensitizes cells to DNA damage agents, and impaired DNA repair. PIG3 depletion also allows for UV- and NCS-resistant DNA synthesis and permits cells to progress into mitosis, indicating that PIG3 knockdown can suppress intra-S phase and G2/M checkpoints. PIG3-depleted cells show reduced Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylation after DNA damage, which may directly contribute to checkpoint bypass. PIG3 exhibited diffuse nuclear staining in the majority of untreated cells and forms discrete nuclear foci in response to DNA damage. PIG3 colocalizes with γ-H2AX and 53BP1 to sites of DNA damage after DNA damage, and binds to a γ-H2AX. Notably, PIG3 depletion decreases the efficient induction and maintenance of H2AX phosphorylation after DNA damage. Moreover, PIG3 contributes to the recruitment of 53BP1, Mre11, Rad50 and Nbs1 to the sites of DNA break lesions in response to DNA damage. Our combined results suggest that PIG3 is a critical component of the DNA damage response pathway and has a direct role in the transmission of the DNA damage signal from damaged DNA to the intra-S and G2/M checkpoint machinery in human cells."

Western blotting for vesicle-associated membrane protein type v-SNARE proteins (or synaptobrevins) reveals characteristic alterations to venom-treated excised pancreatic lobules in vitro. Immunocytochemistry by electron microscopy confirms both the SNARE identity as VAMP2 and the proteolysis of VAMP2 as a marked decrease in secondary antibody-conjugated colloidal gold particles that are predominantly associated with mature zymogen granules. Studies with recombinant SNARE proteins were used to determine the specific cleavage site in VAMP2 and the susceptibility of VAMP8 (endobrevin). The VAMP2 cleavage site is between the transmembrane anchor and the SNARE motif that assembles into the ternary SNARE complex. Inclusion of divalent chelating agents (EDTA) with fraction nu, an otherwise active purified component from venom, eliminates SNARE proteolysis, suggesting the active protein is a metalloprotease. The unique cleavages of VAMP2 and VAMP8 may be linked to pancreatitis that develops following scorpion envenomation as both of these v-SNARE proteins are associated with zymogen granule membranes in pancreatic acinar cells. We have isolated antarease, a metalloprotease from fraction nu that cleaves VAMP2, and report its amino acid sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2039810910,"Mono- and polyubiquitylation of proteins are key steps in a wide range of biological processes. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate these different events are poorly understood. Here, we employed NMR spectroscopy to map a non-covalent ubiquitin binding surface (UBS) on the Smurf ubiquitin ligase HECT domain. Analysis of mutants of the HECT UBS reveal that interfering with the UBS surface blocked Smurf-dependent degradation of its substrate RhoA in cells. In vitro analysis revealed that the UBS was not required for UbcH7-dependent charging of the HECT catalytic cysteine. Surprisingly, although the UBS was required for polyubiquitylation of both Smurf itself and the Smurf substrate RhoA, it was not required for monoubiquitylation. Furthermore, we show that mutating the UBS interfered with efficient binding of a monoubiquitylated form of RhoA to the Smurf HECT domain. Our findings suggest the UBS promotes polyubiquitylation by stabilizing ubiquitylated substrate binding to the HECT domain."

We have used the purified leukotriene B(4) receptor BLT2 as a model to investigate the capacity of receptor monomers and dimers to activate the adenylyl cyclase inhibitory G(i2) protein. For this, we overexpressed the recombinant receptor as inclusion bodies in the Escherichia coli prokaryotic system, using a human alpha(5) integrin as a fusion partner. This strategy allowed the BLT2 as well as several other G protein-coupled receptors from different families to be produced and purified in large amounts. The BLT2 receptor was then successfully refolded to its native state, as measured by high-affinity LTB(4) binding in the presence of the purified G protein G alpha(i2). The receptor dimer, in which the two protomers displayed a well defined parallel orientation as assessed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, was then separated from the monomer. Using two methods of receptor-catalyzed guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding assay, we clearly demonstrated that monomeric BLT2 stimulates the purified G alpha(i2) beta(1) gamma(2) protein more efficiently than the dimer. These data suggest that assembly of two BLT2 protomers into a dimer results in the reduced ability to signal."
https://openalex.org/W2081928176,"The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that regulates bile acid homeostasis. It is expressed in the liver and the gastrointestinal tract, but also in several non-enterohepatic tissues including testis. Recently, FXR was identified as a negative modulator of the androgen-estrogen-converting aromatase enzyme in human breast cancer cells. In the present study we detected the expression of FXR in Leydig normal and tumor cell lines and in rat testes tissue. We found, in rat Leydig tumor cells, R2C, that FXR activation by the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or a synthetic agonist GW4064, through a SHP-independent mechanism, down-regulates aromatase expression in terms of mRNA, protein levels, and its enzymatic activity. Transient transfection experiments, using vector containing rat aromatase promoter PII, evidenced that CDCA reduces basal aromatase promoter activity. Mutagenesis studies, electrophoretic mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveal that FXR is able to compete with steroidogenic factor 1 in binding to a common sequence present in the aromatase promoter region interfering negatively with its activity. Finally, the FXR-mediated anti-proliferative effects exerted by CDCA on tumor Leydig cells are at least in part due to an inhibition of estrogen-dependent cell growth. In conclusion our findings identify for the first time the activators of FXR as negative modulators of the aromatase enzyme in Leydig tumor cell lines.

https://openalex.org/W2078904872,"Pancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels control insulin secretion by coupling the excitability of the pancreatic β-cell to glucose metabolism. Little is currently known about how the plasma membrane density of these channels is regulated. We therefore set out to examine in detail the endocytosis and recycling of these channels and how these processes are regulated. To achieve this goal, we expressed KATP channels bearing an extracellular hemagglutinin epitope in human embryonic kidney cells and followed their fate along the endocytic pathway. Our results show that KATP channels undergo multiple rounds of endocytosis and recycling. Further, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate significantly decreases KATP channel surface density by reducing channel recycling and diverting the channel to lysosomal degradation. These findings were recapitulated in the model pancreatic β-cell line INS1e, where activation of PKC leads to a decrease in the surface density of native KATP channels. Because sorting of internalized channels between lysosomal and recycling pathways could have opposite effects on the excitability of pancreatic β-cells, we propose that PKC-regulated KATP channel trafficking may play a role in the regulation of insulin secretion.

The ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel plays a key role in the regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion by the pancreatic β-cells (1.Ashcroft F.M.

Central to this role is its unique ability to couple changes in the metabolism of glucose to changes in membrane potential. A rise in blood glucose levels increases the uptake and metabolism of glucose, resulting in an increase in the intracellular [ATP]/[ADP] ratio and inhibition of KATP channels. This leads to depolarization of the β-cell membrane (caused by inhibition of K+ efflux), stimulating opening of voltage-activated calcium channels, Ca2+ influx, and insulin release (4.Ashcroft F.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2047-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Regulation of KATP channel function by products of metabolism (e.g. nucleotides) as well as other cellular signals (e.g. protein kinases, lipids) has been extensively studied (1.Ashcroft F.M.

By comparison, little is known about how the number of channels at the plasma membrane of the cell is controlled, although there is growing evidence that changes in the membrane density of the channel underlie disease states (7.Dunne M.J.

Intriguingly, a recent report (27.Lim A. Park S.H. Sohn J.W. Jeon J.H. Park J.H. Song D.K. Lee S.H. Ho W.K. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2813-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) has suggested that AMP-activated protein kinase-mediated increases in surface density of KATP channels at least partially underlie the inhibition of insulin secretion under low glucose conditions. These findings further highlight the potential importance of regulation of KATP channel trafficking in the normal control of insulin secretion. protein kinase C hemagglutinin phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate dimethyl sulfoxide phosphate-buffered saline horseradish peroxidase cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor. The cell surface density of membrane proteins is often determined by a balance between forward trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum, endocytosis, and recycling (28.Doherty G.J. McMahon H.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 857-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar, 29.Kennedy M.J. Ehlers M.D. Annu. Rev.

Studies have shown that assembly and forward trafficking of KATP channels is controlled by endoplasmic reticulum localization (31.Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) and exit (19.Taneja T.K. Mankouri J. Karnik R. Kannan S. Smith A.J. Munsey T. Christesen H.B. Beech D.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 9080-9090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to produce rapid changes in cell surface density. On the other hand, both endocytosis and recycling could occur rapidly to produce prompt changes in the cell surface density of the channel. It is therefore not surprising that endocytic mechanisms are often targeted by cellular signals, such as protein kinases, to regulate the density of membrane proteins at the plasma membrane (29.Kennedy M.J. Ehlers M.D. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 325-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 30.Drake M.T. Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Circ.

(22.Hu K. Huang C.S. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2003; 38: 417-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) reported that activation of PKC stimulates endocytosis of KATP channels and that little or no channel internalization occurs in the absence of PKC stimulation. However, a later study demonstrated that KATP channels can undergo constitutive endocytosis in the absence of PKC stimulation using a tyrosine-based endocytic signal located on the Kir6.2 subunit (17.Mankouri J. Taneja T.K. Smith A.J. Ponnambalam S. Sivaprasadarao A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The fate of channels following endocytosis and the contribution of post-endocytic mechanisms to the regulation of cell surface density of KATP channels are not known. Here, we set out to examine the fate of endocytosed KATP channels. Our results show that KATP channels undergo rapid constitutive endocytosis and subsequent recycling to the plasma membrane. Additionally, we demonstrate that the PKC-induced decrease in the surface density of KATP channels is brought about via a reduction in their recycling with endocytosis being unaffected. Finally, PKC activation ultimately causes channels to accumulate in a Lamp1-positive late endosomal or lysosomal compartment with a concomitant increase in the rate of channel degradation. We would suggest that the PKC-mediated decrease in KATP channel surface density will likely prove to have important consequences for β-cell excitability and insulin secretion. HEK293 cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-1573), The HEK293-MSRII cell line was provided by Glaxo-Smith Kline (Stevenage, UK). All of the cell lines were grown in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HEK cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin and streptomycin (100 μg ml−1). For HEK293-MSRII cells, this was supplemented with 500 μg ml−1 G418 (Invitrogen). INS1e cells were a kind gift of Dr. C. B. Wollheim (University Medical Center, Geneva, Switzerland) and were cultured as described previously (17.Mankouri J. Taneja T.K. Smith A.J. Ponnambalam S. Sivaprasadarao A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). cDNA constructs encoding mouse Kir6.2 with an extracellular HA epitope and an additional 11-amino acid linker (pcDNA3-HA-Kir6.2) and hamster SUR1 (pcDNA6-SUR1) are as described previously (17.Mankouri J. Taneja T.K. Smith A.J. Ponnambalam S. Sivaprasadarao A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cell lines were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) 48 h prior to experimentation. A HEK293 cell line stably co-expressing HA-Kir6.2 and SUR1 (hereafter referred to as HA-tagged KATP channels) was generated and propagated in the presence of G418 (500 μg ml−1) and blasticidin (10 μg ml−1) (Invitrogen) as described previously (18.Partridge C.J. Beech D.J. Sivaprasadarao A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35947-35952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4α-PDD), bisindolylmaleimide I, and chelerythrine chloride were purchased from Calbiochem. Stock solutions of PMA and chelerythrine were stored in DMSO at −20 °C and diluted in either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium + 1% ovalbumin (Sigma) for immunocytochemistry and chemiluminescence experiments or extracellular solution for patch clamp experiments. Unless otherwise stated, the cells were pretreated with drugs for 30 min prior to and throughout experimentation. The drug concentrations used throughout were: PMA, 100 nm; and chelerythrine, 10 μm. Control cells were treated with vehicle alone (DMSO) at 0.1%. The cells transfected with HA-Kir6.2 and SUR1 on coverslips were subjected to internalization assay as described previously using the rat monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (clone 3F10; Roche Applied Science) (17.Mankouri J. Taneja T.K. Smith A.J. Ponnambalam S. Sivaprasadarao A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Where required, a third clone encoding a green fluorescent protein-tagged marker protein was included in the transfections. The samples were imaged on a Zeiss 510 META laser scanning confocal microscope under a 63× oil immersion lens (NA 1.40). Green fluorescent protein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, and AlexaFluor488 (494-nm excitation and 519-nm emission) were excited using an argon laser fitted with 488-nm filters, and Cy3 (550-nm excitation and 570-nm emission) was excited using a helium/neon laser fitted with 543-nm filters. To assess recycling of internalized KATP channels, the cells were incubated with rat anti-HA antibody (0.2 μg ml−1) for 2 h at 37 °C to allow antibody labeled channels to undergo internalization. The cells were then washed with PBS, and surface-bound antibody was removed by washing twice with ice-cold acidic buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% acetic acid, pH 2.4). The cells were then incubated at 37 °C to allow recycling of the antibody-labeled internalized channels to occur for the required length of time, before fixing with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Surface (recycled) channels are then labeled with AlexaFluor488-conjugated donkey anti-rat antibody (1:500; Molecular Probes). The cells were then permeabilized with methanol:acetone (50:50) for 5 min and labeled with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rat antibodies (1:500; Jackson Immunoresearch) to stain the nonrecycled channels. In experiments where the dynamics of recycling and reinternalization were followed (see Fig. 2) surface-bound rat anti-HA antibodies were blocked with unconjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibodies (Sigma; 2 μg ml−1) for 1 h at 4 °C. Following three washes with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound antibody, the cells were incubated at 37 °C in the continuous presence of AlexaFluor488-conjugated anti-rat secondary antibody to label the recycled channels. The cells were chilled at the end of the desired time interval, washed, fixed, and permeabilized, before staining with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rat antibodies to label the nonrecycled channels. We refer to the latter method in the text as the secondary antibody capture assay. To study the distribution of the endocytic pool of KATP channels, transfected cells were incubated with rat anti-HA antibody (0.2 μg ml−1) at 37 °C for 1 h to allow internalization. After washing to remove any unbound antibody, the cells were fixed and permeabilized with methanol at −20 °C. Subsequently the cells were labeled with primary antibodies to subcellular organelles as required (mouse anti-EEA1 (BD Laboratories) at 1:250 dilution, goat anti-TGN46/38 (kind gift from Dr. S. Ponnambalam, University of Leeds) at 1:100 dilution, mouse anti-CI-M6PR (Abcam) at 1:250 dilution, and rabbit anti-CI-M6PR (kind gift from Prof. J. P. Luzio, Cambridge University) at 1:200 dilution). The cells were then washed and labeled with appropriate fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies (Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rat (Jackson Immunoresearch) at 1:500 dilution, AlexaFluor488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Molecular Probes), at 1:500 dilution, AlexaFluor488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes), at 1:500 dilution, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-goat (Jackson Immunoresearch) at 1:100 dilution). Co-localization analysis was carried out using Image J software (National Institutes of Health). Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for red and green channels excluding zero pixels. For quantification of steady-state surface levels of KATP channels a modification of a method described previously was employed (22.Hu K. Huang C.S. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2003; 38: 417-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) as described by Mankouri et al. (17.Mankouri J. Taneja T.K. Smith A.J. Ponnambalam S. Sivaprasadarao A.

Briefly, the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and the cell surface channels were labeled with rat anti-HA antibodies for 1 h as above. Following extensive washes with PBS, the channels were labeled with HRP-conjugated anti-rat secondary antibodies (1:500 Sigma) for 1 h and washed, and the cells were lysed in 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The amount of secondary antibody present in cell lysates was measured as the increase in luminescence 2 min following the addition of HRP reporter substrate PS ATTO (Lumigen), using a POLARstar OPTIMA luminometer. For quantification of channel endocytosis, cell surface KATP channels were labeled with rat anti-HA antibody for 1 h at 4 °C followed by washing with chilled PBS. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for the desired time period to permit channel internalization followed by fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. KATP channels remaining at the cell surface were then labeled with HRP-conjugated anti-rat antibodies. The cells were subsequently washed thoroughly and lysed before measuring luminescence. Channel internalization was taken as the loss of luminescence relative to the levels at time 0. To quantify channel recycling, the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of rat anti-HA antibodies to label the endocytic pool of KATP channels. The excess antibodies were removed by washing with chilled PBS, and the cells were subsequently incubated at 37 °C in the presence of HRP-conjugated anti-rat antibodies to label the channels returning to the cell surface. At desired time points, recycling was halted by transferring cells to 4 °C. The cells were then washed thoroughly and lysed, and the chemiluminescence associated with the HRP bound to recycling channels was measured. Channel recycling was presented as the increase in the luminescent signal relative to time 0. The data were obtained from a number of independent experiments (stated as n in the figure legends), each carried out in duplicate. In all cases the luminescent signal was normalized to lysate protein content estimated by bicinchoninic acid assay. Background chemiluminescence measured from untransfected controls was subtracted from all of the test values. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of means. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test; p < 0.05 was considered significant. 24 h prior to recording, the cells were detached from culture vessels using 0.05% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) and seeded at low density onto 35-mm culture dishes. Borosilicate glass microelectrodes were pulled to a resistance of 2.5–4 MΩ when filled with recording solution. Extracellular recording solution contained 138 mm NaCl: 5.6 mm KOH, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, titrated to pH 7.4 with HCl. Intracellular recording solution contained 100 mm KCl, 40 mm KOH, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, titrated to pH 7.2 with HCl. The currents were recorded in 300-ms 10-mV pulse steps between −100 and +50 mV from a holding potential of −40 mV. The recordings were made in standard whole cell patch clamp configuration using an EPC10 amplifier and Patchmaster software (HEKA). The currents were filtered at 3 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz and analyzed offline using Fitmaster software (HEKA). The corrections were made for liquid-liquid junction potential, and 80% series resistance compensation was routinely applied. All of the recordings were made at room temperature. Current (I)-voltage (V) relationships were determined first in the absence and then in the presence of tolbutamide (200 μm). Conductance was measured from the slopes of the I-V curves in the linear region between −100 and −50 mV. KATP conductance was determined by subtracting tolbutamide-insensitive K+ conductance from total conductance and normalized to cell capacitance. To assess the stability of the surface pool of KATP channels, we employed a modification of the cell surface immunoprecipitation method described previously (34.Kwon S.H. Guggino W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15237-15242Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293 cells stably expressing HA-tagged KATP channels were surface-labeled at 4 °C with biotinylated anti-HA Fab fragments (1:500 dilution) (3F10 clone; Roche Applied Science). Excess unbound antibody was removed by multiple washes in chilled PBS. The cells were then treated with either vehicle or PMA as indicated and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 1% ovalbumin for the desired time at 37 °C to allow channel endocytosis and degradation. The cells were subsequently collected and lysed overnight at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1× protease inhibitors (complete mini-EDTA free; Roche Applied Science). The protein concentration of each sample was assessed by BCA assay and 500 μg of protein was used. Channel antibody complexes were then pulled down using neutravidin-agarose beads (Thermo scientific), eluted with 1× SDS buffer, and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-HA antibodies (1:2000 dilution; Immune Systems Ltd.). For quantification of band intensity, densitometry was performed using Image J software (National Institutes of Health). Statistical significance was assessed at p < 0.05 using Student's t test or analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc means comparison as appropriate. Unless otherwise stated, all of the reagents were purchased from Sigma. We have previously demonstrated that plasma membrane KATP channels undergo rapid and constitutive endocytosis (17.Mankouri J. Taneja T.K. Smith A.J. Ponnambalam S. Sivaprasadarao A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The high rate of channel endocytosis together with the relatively long half-life of KATP channels reported earlier (32.Crane A. Aguilar-Bryan L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9080-9090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) led us to believe that channel recycling could play an important role in the regulation of cell surface density. We therefore first set out to examine whether the endocytosed KATP channels recycle back to the cell surface. HEK293 cells co-expressing SUR1 and Kir6.2 with an extracellular HA tag were used in immunofluorescence experiments to look for any recycling of endocytosed channels. Transfected cells were incubated with rat anti-HA antibodies for 2 h at 37 °C to allow the antibodies to bind to the exposed HA epitope of the channels and undergo co-internalization with the channels. Antibodies bound to channels remaining at the cell surface following this incubation were removed by washing with an ice-cold acid strip buffer, pH 2.5. Subsequently the cells were transferred to 37 °C for 1 h to permit recycling of internalized channels. Recycled channels were detected by staining unpermeabilized cells with AlexaFluor488-labeled anti-rat secondary antibodies (green). Nonrecycled channels were detected by permeabilizing the cells and staining with Cy3-labeled anti-rat secondary antibodies (red). Fig. 1A shows that the acid strip step is effective in removing surface antibody labeling (compare left panel with the middle panel) and that internalized channels are recycled to the cell surface (right panel). Recycling could be blocked by treatments known to inhibit recycling; thus lowering the temperature to 19 °C, where endocytosis can occur, but recycling is known to be inhibited, fully blocked recycling (Fig. 1B). Likewise, pretreatment of the cells with monensin (35.Wileman T. Boshans R.L. Schlesinger P. Stahl P. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or primaquine (36.Woods A.J. White D.P. Caswell P.T. Norman J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2531-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), agents that block recycling by preventing acidification of endosomes, also prevented recycling (Fig. 1B). To eliminate the possibility that the anti-HA antibodies undergo internalization and recycling independent of KATP channels, we have examined the ability of a mutant channel (Y330A mutation in Kir6.2) to recycle. This mutation destroys the tyrosine-based internalization motif in Kir6.2 and prevents endocytosis (17.Mankouri J. Taneja T.K. Smith A.J. Ponnambalam S. Sivaprasadarao A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 41"
https://openalex.org/W2039361696,"Background and Methods Malaria in Africa is most severe in young children and pregnant women, particularly in rural and poor households. In many countries, malaria intervention coverage rates have increased as a result of scale up; but this may mask limited coverage in these highest-risk populations. Reports were reviewed from nationally representative surveys in African malaria-endemic countries from 2006 through 2008 to understand how reported intervention coverage rates reflect access by the most at-risk populations. Results Reports were available from 27 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICSs), and Malaria Indicator Surveys (MISs) during this interval with data on household intervention coverage by urban or rural setting, wealth quintile, and sex. Household ownership of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) varied from 5% to greater than 60%, and was equitable by urban/rural and wealth quintile status among 13 (52%) of 25 countries. Malaria treatment rates for febrile children under five years of age varied from less than 10% to greater than 70%, and while equitable coverage was achieved in 8 (30%) of 27 countries, rates were generally higher in urban and richest quintile households. Use of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnant women varied from 2% to more than 60%, and again tended to be higher in urban and richest quintile households. Across all countries, there were no significant male/female inequalities seen for children sleeping under ITNs or receiving antimalarial treatment for febrile illness. Parasitemia and anemia rates from eight national surveys showed predominance in poor and rural populations. Conclusions/Significance Recent efforts to scale up malaria intervention coverage have achieved equity in some countries (especially with ITNs), but delivery methods in other countries are not addressing the most at-risk populations. As countries seek universal malaria intervention coverage, their delivery systems must reach the rural and poor populations; this is not a small task, but it has been achieved in some countries."
https://openalex.org/W2067186466,"Background Site-specific protein labeling or modification can facilitate the characterization of proteins with respect to their structure, folding, and interaction with other proteins. However, current methods of site-specific protein labeling are few and with limitations, therefore new methods are needed to satisfy the increasing need and sophistications of protein labeling. Methodology A method of protein C-terminal labeling was developed using a non-canonical split-intein, through an intein-catalyzed trans-splicing reaction between a protein and a small synthetic peptide carrying the desired labeling groups. As demonstrations of this method, three different proteins were efficiently labeled at their C-termini with two different labels (fluorescein and biotin) either in solution or on a solid surface, and a transferrin receptor protein was labeled on the membrane surface of live mammalian cells. Protein biotinylation and immobilization on a streptavidin-coated surface were also achieved in a cell lysate without prior purification of the target protein. Conclusions We have produced a method of site-specific labeling or modification at the C-termini of recombinant proteins. This method compares favorably with previous protein labeling methods and has several unique advantages. It is expected to have many potential applications in protein engineering and research, which include fluorescent labeling for monitoring protein folding, location, and trafficking in cells, and biotinylation for protein immobilization on streptavidin-coated surfaces including protein microchips. The types of chemical labeling may be limited only by the ability of chemical synthesis to produce the small C-intein peptide containing the desired chemical groups."
https://openalex.org/W2065148696,"The Ras oncogene is known to activate three major MAPK pathways, ERK, JNK, p38 and exert distinct cellular phenotypes, that is, apoptosis and invasion through the Ras-MKK3-p38-signaling cascade. We attempted to identify the molecular targets of this pathway that selectively govern the invasive phenotype. Stable transfection of NIH3T3 fibroblasts with MKK3(act) cDNA construct revealed similar p38-dependent in vitro characteristics observed in Ha-Ras(EJ)-transformed NIH3T3 cells, including enhanced invasiveness and anchorage-independent growth correlating with p38 phosphorylation status. To identify the consensus downstream targets of the Ras-MKK3-p38 cascade involved in invasion, in vitro invasion assays were used to isolate highly invasive cells from both, MKK3 and Ha-Ras(EJ) transgenic cell lines. Subsequently a genome-wide transcriptome analysis was employed to investigate differentially regulated genes in invasive Ha-Ras(EJ)- and MKK3(act)-transfected NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Using this phenotype-assisted approach combined with system level protein-interaction network analysis, we identified FOXM1, PLK1 and CDK1 to be differentially regulated in invasive Ha-Ras(EJ)-NIH3T3 and MKK3(act)-NIH3T3 cells. Finally, a FOXM1 RNA-knockdown approach revealed its requirement for both invasion and anchorage-independent growth of Ha-Ras(EJ)- and MKK3(act)-NIH3T3 cells. Together, we identified FOXM1 as a key downstream target of Ras and MKK3-induced cellular in vitro invasion and anchorage-independent growth signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2006102533,"Accurate taste perception relies on a properly functioning olfactory system. The authors demonstrate a reciprocal connection between taste and olfaction by showing that inactivation of the taste cortex also affects olfactory perception. As anyone who has suffered through a head cold knows, food eaten when the olfactory system is impaired tastes 'wrong', an experience that leads many to conclude that taste stimuli are processed normally only when the olfactory system is unimpaired. Evidence that the taste system influences olfactory perception, however, has been vanishingly rare. We found just such an influence; if taste cortex was inactivated when an odor was first presented, later presentations were properly appreciated only if taste cortex was again inactivated."

https://openalex.org/W2019178213,"Changes in neuronal synchronization have been found in patients and animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Synchronized behaviors within neuronal networks are important to such complex cognitive processes as working memory. The mechanisms behind these changes are not understood but may involve the action of soluble β-amyloid (Aβ) on electrical networks. In order to determine if Aβ can induce changes in neuronal synchronization, the activities of pyramidal neurons were recorded in rat prefrontal cortical (PFC) slices under calcium-free conditions using multi-neuron patch clamp technique. Electrical network activities and synchronization among neurons were significantly inhibited by low dose Aβ42 (1 nM) and initially by high dose Aβ42 (500 nM). However, prolonged application of high dose Aβ42 resulted in network activation and tonic firing. Underlying these observations, we discovered that prolonged application of low and high doses of Aβ42 induced opposite changes in action potential (AP)-threshold and after-hyperpolarization (AHP) of neurons. Accordingly, low dose Aβ42 significantly increased the AP-threshold and deepened the AHP, making neurons less excitable. In contrast, high dose Aβ42 significantly reduced the AP-threshold and shallowed the AHP, making neurons more excitable. These results support a model that low dose Aβ42 released into the interstitium has a physiologic feedback role to dampen electrical network activity by reducing neuronal excitability. Higher concentrations of Aβ42 over time promote supra-synchronization between individual neurons by increasing their excitability. The latter may disrupt frontal-based cognitive processing and in some cases lead to epileptiform discharges."
https://openalex.org/W2018270192,"Vitamin B12 is indispensable for proper brain functioning and cytosolic synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine. Whether its deficiency produces effects on viability and apoptosis of neurons remains unknown. There is a particular interest in investigating these effects in Parkinson disease where Levodopa treatment is known to increase the consumption of S-adenosylmethionine. To cause deprivation of vitamin B12, we have recently developed a cell model that produces decreased synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine by anchoring transcobalamin (TCII) to the reticulum through its fusion with Oleosin (OLEO).Gene constructs including transcobalamin-oleosin (TCII-OLEO) and control constructs, green fluorescent protein-transcobalamin-oleosin (GFP-TCII-OLEO), oleosin-transcobalamin (OLEO-TCII), TCII and OLEO were used for expression in N1E-115 cells (mouse neuroblastoma) and in substantia nigra of adult rats, using a targeted transfection with a Neurotensin polyplex system. We studied the viability and the apoptosis in the transfected cells and targeted tissue. The turning behavior was evaluated in the rats transfected with the different plasmids.The transfection of N1E-115 cells by the TCII-OLEO-expressing plasmid significantly affected cell viability and increased immunoreactivity of cleaved Caspase-3. No change in propidium iodide uptake (used as a necrosis marker) was observed. The transfected rats lost neurons immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxylase. The expression of TCII-OLEO was observed in cells immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxylase of the substantia nigra, with a superimposed expression of cleaved Caspase-3. These cellular and tissular effects were not observed with the control plasmids. Rats transfected with TCII-OLEO expressing plasmid presented with a significantly higher number of turns, compared with those transfected with the other plasmids.In conclusion, the TCII-OLEO transfection was responsible for apoptosis in N1E-115 cells and rat substantia nigra and for Parkinson-like phenotype. This suggests evaluating whether vitamin B12 deficit could aggravate the PD in patients under Levodopa therapy by impairing S-adenosylmethionine synthesis in substantia nigra."
https://openalex.org/W2019603801,"The aim of this study was to identify novel inducers of hair growth using gene expression profiling at various stages of hair-growth induction. First, we analyzed gene expression at the onset of hair growth in mice induced by cyclosporin A (CsA), a well-known hair-growth inducer, using DNA microarray analysis. The results unveiled genes involved in the step-by-step progression of hair growth, including increases in melanin biosynthesis and decreases in immune response at d 2 and the subsequent stimulation of cell proliferation at d 4, followed by the up-regulation of hair specific keratins at d 7 after CsA treatment. With the use of the connectivity map (Cmap), agents that had a similar ""gene signature"" to that of the profiles of CsA-treated mice were identified. Several agents, including CsA, were identified by the Cmap and were evaluated for hair induction activity in vivo. One of the proposed agents, fluphenazine (from the d 2 signature) actually induced hair growth in vivo (ED(50): 2 mM for single application), and the subsequent application of 5 mM iloprost (from the d 4 signature) significantly enhanced the hair-growth effect of fluphenazine. From these results, Cmap analysis was proven to be a useful method that connects gene expression profiles of complicated biological processes, such as hair-growth induction, to effective agents."
https://openalex.org/W2026287766,"O(6)-Alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) plays a major role in repair of the cytotoxic and mutagenic lesion O(6)-methylguanine (m(6)G) in DNA. Unlike the Escherichia coli alkyltransferase Ogt that also repairs O(4)-methylthymine (m(4)T) efficiently, the human AGT (hAGT) acts poorly on m(4)T. Here we made several hAGT mutants in which residues near the cysteine acceptor site were replaced by corresponding residues from Ogt to investigate the basis for the inefficiency of hAGT in repair of m(4)T. Construct hAGT-03 (where hAGT sequence -V(149)CSSGAVGN(157)- was replaced with the corresponding Ogt -I(143)GRNGTMTG(151)-) exhibited enhanced m(4)T repair activity in vitro compared with hAGT. Three AGT proteins (hAGT, hAGT-03, and Ogt) exhibited similar protection from killing by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and caused a reduction in m(6)G-induced G:C to A:T mutations in both nucleotide excision repair (NER)-proficient and -deficient Escherichia coli strains that lack endogenous AGTs. hAGT-03 resembled Ogt in totally reducing the m(4)T-induced T:A to C:G mutations in NER-proficient and -deficient strains. Surprisingly, wild type hAGT expression caused a significant but incomplete decrease in NER-deficient strains but a slight increase in T:A to C:G mutation frequency in NER-proficient strains. The T:A to C:G mutations due to O(4)-alkylthymine formed by ethylating and propylating agents were also efficiently reduced by either hAGT-03 or Ogt, whereas hAGT had little effect irrespective of NER status. These results show that specific alterations in the hAGT active site facilitate efficient recognition and repair of O(4)-alkylthymines and reveal damage-dependent interactions of base and nucleotide excision repair."
https://openalex.org/W2008644797,"Successful gene therapy will require targeted delivery vectors capable of self-directed localization. In this regard, the use of antibodies or single chain antibody fragments (scFv) in conjunction with adenovirus (Ad) vectors remains an attractive means to achieve cell-specific targeting. However, a longstanding barrier to the development of Ad vectors with genetically incorporated scFvs has been the biosynthetic incompatibility between Ad capsid proteins and antibody-derived species. Specifically, scFv require posttranslational modifications not available to Ad capsid proteins due to their cytoplasmic routing during protein synthesis and virion assembly.We have therefore sought to develop scFv-targeted Ad vectors using a secreted scFv that undergoes the requisite posttranslational modifications and is trafficked for secretion. Formation of the scFv-targeted Ad vector is achieved via highly specific association of the Ad virion and a targeting scFv employing synthetic leucine zipper-like dimerization domains (zippers) that have been optimized for structural compatibility with the Ad capsid and for association with the secreted scFv. Our results show that zipper-containing Ad fiber molecules trimerize and incorporate into mature virions and that zippers can be genetically fused to scFv without ablating target recognition. Most importantly, we show that zipper-tagged virions and scFv provide target-specific gene transfer.This work describes a new approach to produce targeted Ad vectors using a secreted scFv molecule, thereby avoiding the problem of structural and biosynthetic incompatibility between Ad and a complex targeting ligand. This approach may facilitate Ad targeting using a wide variety of targeting ligands directed towards a variety of cellular receptors."

Cellular communication forms the basis of eukaryotic complexity and better understanding of how cells influence and are influenced by their neighbors in health and disease is needed. Among the various signals involved in cellular cross-talk are numerous proteins that bind to membrane receptors and initiate cascades, such as those involving Notch (1.Brivanlou A.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 2002; 295: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and Wnt signaling (2.Reya T. Clevers H.

Although several methods, such as protein affinity chromatography, affinity blotting, and immunoprecipitation exist to identify protein-based cellular interactions, those currently in widespread use rely upon proteomic analyses in artificial systems (e.g. yeast two-hybrid), employ manipulations that may conceivably affect protein function (e.g. insertion of protein tags), or rely upon potentially hazardous reagents (e.g. radioactive isotopes). Recently, the technique of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) 3The abbreviations used are: SILACstable isotope labeling of amino acids in cellMSmass spectrometryRBBP7retinoblastoma-binding protein 7BMbone marrowMETmesenchymal to epithelial transitionMSmass spectrometryMS/MStandem MSChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationMLGmurine lung fibroblast cell linePBSphosphate-buffered salineTBItotal body irradiationBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolLCliquid chromatographysiRNAsmall interference RNARbretinoblastomaMTA3metastasis-associated protein 3HDAC1histone deacetylase 1EMTepithelial-mesenchymal transition. has been introduced as a mass spectrometry (MS)-based strategy to quantitatively interrogate the proteome (3.Ong S.E.

SILAC employs either normal or heavy isotope-substituted amino acids that can be metabolically incorporated into proteomes, which can then be quantitatively identified with global, differential MS analysis. As with radioactive labeling of proteins using isotopes such as [35S]methionine, SILAC-labeled proteins do not differ in structure or function compared with their unlabeled counterparts. An obvious advantage of stable isotopes is their safety profile and their ability to be easily used in cell culture (4.Mann M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Standard SILAC experiments usually involve the selective labeling of two populations of cells with heavy and light amino acids, respectively. Cells are then mixed and proteomes are subsequently harvested, digested, and analyzed by MS. Binary analysis of the MS spectra, which appear as a series of peptide pairs, allows discrimination of cellular origin (higher mass peaks representing proteins from heavy labeled cells) and protein abundance (relative intensity of peak) (6.Ong S.E.

These studies indicate that the field of quantitative proteomics, while still in its infancy, has the potential to uncover regulatory cascades in health and disease. Here, we extend the utility of SILAC to identify proteins secreted by one cell type and absorbed by another in a contact-free co-culture system employing murine lung cells with murine hematopoietic or human cancer cell lines and primary murine stem cells. Our interest in developing this application derives from an obvious need to better understand intercellular protein communication. For example, take the broad clinical challenge of cellular therapy and tissue regeneration. While ample work has been done on generating appropriate cells, monitoring in vivo fate, and measuring biological and clinical endpoints of therapy, very little is known regarding how exogenously introduced cells interact with their new tissue microenvironment. Similarly, consider the metastatic foci of certain cancers. A great deal of knowledge is emerging on the genetic re-programming necessary to convert a cell from its normal to malignant to metastatic state. Yet, upon leaving its tissue of origin, what cues, if any, do organs of eventual destination communicate to a metastatic cell (15.Wells A. Yates C. Shepard C.R. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2008; 25: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar)? We summarize experiments using SILAC to catalogue a protein interactome relevant to stem cell and cancer biology. We find irradiation injury to lung cell lines or primary lung tissue ex vivo leads to the secretion of proteins that have not been previously regarded as secretagogues, including the retinoblastoma-binding protein 7 (RBBP7). In-depth molecular investigation revealed that RBBP7 of lung origin is transferred into a wide range of neighboring cells, including primary bone marrow, hematopoietic, and cancer cell lines. Interestingly, the cellular transfer of RBBP7 leads to genotypic changes associated with the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), including the relative reduction of levels of N-cadherin, fibronectin, and vimentin (16.Mani S.A.

In further analysis, we find that RBBP7 serves as transcriptional activator of the E-cadherin gene by binding to its promoter region thereby adding a further layer of complexity to its transcriptional control. Mouse lung-originated MLG cell line (ATCC, CCL-206) was cultured in SILAC® Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium labeling medium, designated as “heavy” medium, containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 100 mg/ml [U-13C6]-l-lysine (K+6) and 100 mg/ml [U-13C6,15N4]-l-arginine (R+10) and 100× l-glutamine (Invitrogen).

Sanchez-Guijo F.M. Dooner G.J. Johnson K.W. Dooner M.S. Greer K.A. Greer D. Pimentel J. Kolankiewicz L.M. Puente N. Faradyan S. Ferland P. Bearer E.L. Passero M.A. Adedi M. Colvin G.A. Quesenberry P.J. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 2245-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). After irradiation, cells were washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then placed on the top of Millicell culture plate insert (Millipore, Billerica, MA), while FDCP1 cells were plated beneath the membrane of well inserts. Light medium was added to both top and bottom. Culture plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 48 h after which FDCP1 and MLG cells were removed for independent downstream analysis. For experiments involving primary murine tissue, mice were exposed to 500 cGy of total body irradiation (TBI) using a Gammacell 40 Exactor Irradiator at 110 cGy/min (MDS Nordion). Control mice received no TBI. Mice were sacrificed, and their lungs were harvested and processed after TBI. Bone marrow (BM) from non-irradiated mice was isolated, and viable cells were quantified, as described previously (18.Aliotta J.M. Sanchez-Guijo F.M. Dooner G.J. Johnson K.W. Dooner M.S. Greer K.A. Greer D. Pimentel J. Kolankiewicz L.M. Puente N. Faradyan S. Ferland P. Bearer E.L. Passero M.A. Adedi M. Colvin G.A. Quesenberry P.J. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 2245-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Transwell culture of minced lung tissue and BM was carried our for 48 h. Prostate cancer cells (DU145WT) and breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) were co-cultured with irradiated MLG cells for 2 days by following the same procedures mentioned above for FDCP1. Trypan blue staining (Invitrogen) was used to measure cell viability, and levels of cellular proliferation were quantified by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (Sigma). After harvesting, FDCP1, BM, and DU145WT cells were then washed once with 1× PBS before treatment with CelLytic® M reagent (Sigma) for 15 min on a shaker. The lysed cells were centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 g to pellet the cellular debris. Protein-containing supernatant was collected. Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) was used to determine protein concentrations. Protein samples were run on NuPAGE® 4–12% Bis-Tris precast Gel (Invitrogen) by using XCell SureLock® Mini-Cell (Invitrogen). The gel was stained by SimplyBlue® SafeStain (Invitrogen). The entire sample lane from the destained gel was cut into ten equal gel pieces for fractionation. Each piece was washed three times with 50% acetonitrile/50% high-performance liquid chromatography grade water prior to mass spectrometric analysis. Gel pieces were washed, reduced with dithiothreitol, and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Gels were then digested with modified trypsin (Promega) at pH 8.3 overnight at 37 °C with shaking. The resulting peptide mixtures from each gel piece after extraction were analyzed separately by data-dependent microcapillary reversed-phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) with a high resolution hybrid quadrupole-time-of-flight QSTAR Pulsar i qTOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) operated in positive ion mode. Self-packed 10-cm length × 75-μm diameter C18 columns were used at a flow rate of 275 nl/min with a gradient of 5% B (acetonitrile) to 38% B over 1 h. The buffer was 0.1% formic acid. MS/MS spectra were searched against the reversed Swiss-Prot protein data base to identify proteins using the Paragon algorithm in ProteinPilot® (Applied Biosystems) software. Proteins with at least two unique peptides matching the forward data base were initially accepted as valid identification followed by manual inspection of the MS/MS data. Post-translational modifications were also considered during data base searches. The ratio of heavy to light peptides was analyzed from the MS scan and calculated by using the ProteinPilot® software. In cases where the ratio of the light and heavy peptides was difficult to determine because of low signal in one of the states, a conservative value of 20 (for up-regulated proteins) or 0.05 for down-regulated proteins was used (9.Gronborg M. Kristiansen T.Z. Iwahori A. Chang R. Reddy R. Sato N. Molina H. Jensen O.N. Hruban R.H. Goggins M.G. Maitra A. Pandey A. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2006; 5: 157-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Each protein SILAC ratio was expressed as the average of all the peptide SILAC ratios per protein integrated across all ten LC/MS/MS datasets. Cellular protein was harvested, quantified by micro BCA assay, and run on NuPAGE® 4–12% Bis-Tris precast Gel (Invitrogen) by using XCell SureLock® Mini-Cell (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, the resolved proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by using XCell II® Blot Module. Upon the completion of transfer, standard protocols of WesternBreeze® Chemiluminescent Detection Kits (Invitrogen) were followed and developed on ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. Image acquisition of Western blot were performed through Epson scan (version 2.68a) by using an Epson Perfection 4990 photo scanner operating at film mode with the following settings: 256 gray shades and a resolution of 600 dpi. To quantify bands, QuantityOne® (Bio-Rad) basic (version 4.62) was used to measure densitometry. Levels of β-actin were used to normalize protein input. Antibodies used in this study were: Anti-β-actin, anti-RBBP7 antibody, and anti-MTA3 from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX), anti-NSDHL from Atlas Antibodies AB (Stockholm, Sweden), anti-hnRNP G from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Hsp86 from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), anti-PRP4 from ProteinTech Group (Chicago, IL), and anti-E-cadherin from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). One hundred million viable FDCP1 cells either cultured alone or co-cultured with irradiated MLG cells for 48 h were treated in 1 ml of PBS (pH 7.5) for 10 min with trypsin (final concentration at 10 μg/ml, Sigma) on ice (19.Jacob L. Lety M.A. Monteiro R.C. Jacob F. Bach J.F. Louvard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 1361-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cell surface proteins released by these mild protease treatments were separated from the cells by low speed centrifugation (200 × g, for 7 min). The remaining cellular material was subjected to protein extraction as described above. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol® (Invitrogen) and then purified by RNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen). The concentrations of all RNA samples were determined by spectrophotometry. Equal amounts of total RNA were used for reverse transcription and PCR, which was carried out on a thermocycler gradient (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY) by using an RT2 First Strand Kit (SuperArray, Frederick, MD) following standard protocols. Primers were designed by using Real-time PCR (TaqMan) Primer Design online tools available from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). Primer sequences are provided in supplemental Table S2. Real-time PCR was performed on Mastercycler® ep realplex (Eppendorf). All reactions were performed in 96-well plates with the following reagents in a final volume of 25 μl: 1 μl of primers (5 μm each for forward and reverse) and 2× Maxima® SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix from Fermentas (Glen Burnie, MD). 10 ng of cDNA was added to this mixture. Triplicate reactions of the target and housekeeping genes were performed simultaneously for each cDNA template analyzed. The PCR reaction consisted of an initial enzyme activation step at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. A cycle threshold value (Ct) value was obtained for each sample, and triplicate sample values were averaged. The 2−ΔΔCt method was used to calculate relative expression of each target gene. Data were analyzed using Student's t test. We considered results to be statistically significant when p < 0.05 (two-sided). Real-time PCR products were also verified by running on 1.5% agarose gel, stained in 1×TAE with added GelStar® (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) then visualized under a UV transilluminator. siRNA pools containing three distinct siRNAs specific against mouse RBBP7 gene and mouse MTA3 gene, and control siRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Nucleofector II device and Cell Line Nucleofector® Kit L (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) were used for transfecting FDCP1 cells. Nucleofector program D-017 was used as described by the manufacturer. Each transfection used 1 μg of siRNAs. After electroporation, cells were incubated in a humidified 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator for 48 h before analyzing gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed according to protocols supplied by Millipore's EZ-ChIP® Kit. Anti-RBBP7 was used as the capture antibody. Normal rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) was used as negative control. Anti-RNA Polymerase II included in this kit was used as positive control antibody. Three serially deleted promoter regions of mouse E-cadherin, spanning from −428, −377, and −293 nucleotides to translation starting site, were PCR-amplified and cloned into pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). Dual-Glo® Luciferase Reagent (Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence was measured by using a TopCount NXT® Microplate Scintillation and Luminescence Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Morphological changes of cells were observed under microscopy with 20× power magnification. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed with cells on coverslips that were fixed in −20 °C cold methanol for 5 min. After fixation, cells were washed with PBS twice and blocked in 1.5% bovine serum albumin/PBST for 30 min at room temperature. Then cells were incubated with primary antibodies E-cadherin and RBBP7 for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in PBS for three times, cells were incubated with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min. The images were viewed and recorded by using Olympus BX40 and SPOT Flex (Diagnostic Instruments, version 4.5). We used an in vitro Transwell cell culture system in which two cell types were jointly cultured but separated by a permeable membrane (0.4-μm pore size) to allow transport of secreted proteins but prevent inter-compartmental cellular migration or contact (Fig. 1A). To optimize experimental techniques, we first used a “donor” murine lung fibroblast cell line (MLG) that had been cultured in SILAC medium for 6 days, corresponding to ∼6 doubling times sufficient to label all proteins with [U-13C6]-l-lysine and [U-13C6,15N4]-l-arginine. Cells were then extensively washed, irradiated, and layered upon an “acceptor” FDCP1 hematopoietic cell line that had been grown in identical cell culture media but with normal lysine and arginine. The effect of irradiation (500 cGy) on cellular health was assessed by serial trypan blue exclusion and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays over 2 days. As seen in Fig. 1B, radiation injury led to cell death and blunted proliferative responses in a statistically significant manner compared with non-irradiated cells maintained in similar conditions over the same time frame. After 48 h of co-culture, FDCP1 cells were harvested, and total cellular proteins were extracted, digested by trypsin, and analyzed by LC/MS/MS using a hybrid quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer. A total of 2528 unique peptides were identified that initially mapped to 461 proteins (supplemental Table S1a). To increase the stringency of identification, we required that each protein associate with at least two unique peptides to be considered as valid identification from the reversed SwissProt data base (20.Graumann J. Hubner N.C. Kim J.B. Ko K. Moser M. Kumar C. Cox J. Scholer H. Mann M. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2008; 7: 672-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Using these criteria, the total number of proteins was reduced to 383 (supplemental Table S1b). To unambiguously assign peptides as heavy, the threshold for peptide ratios (0.201 ± 0.04) was calculated based on the average of ratios of all unique peptides detected and quantified, and 0.205 was used as a cut-off value (supplemental Table S1c). Finally, the peptide ratios for each protein were averaged, and we required that a ratio of >0.5 was needed to classify a protein as heavy (supplemental Table S1d). After applying the abovementioned criteria, a set of seven unique proteins was identified that could be confidently classified as being transferred from MLG cells to FDCP1 cells on the basis of LC/MS/MS data analysis using SILAC (Table 1 and supplemental Table S3).TABLE 1Candidate proteins thought to undergo transfer from MLG to FDCP1 cells based upon MS dataRefSeq accession numberProtein namesGene namesMassTotal identified peptidesNumber of heavy peptidesProtein ratiosDaNP_035071NAD(P)-dependent steroid dehydrogenase-likeNSDHL40,686425.14 ± 0.02NP_033057Retinoblastoma-binding protein 7RBBP747,790623.45 ± 0.01NP_033059RNA binding motif protein, X chromosome retrogeneHNRPG42,162822.58 ± 0NP_034610Heat shock protein 1, αHSP8684,7881531.42 ± 0NP_663590Electron transferring flavoprotein, α polypeptideETFA35,0091020.65 ± 0.02NP_473423Metastasis-associated 3MTA367,077330.57 ± 0.04NP_081573PRP4 pre-mRNA processing factor 4 homologPRP458,370320.51 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab To independently validate this data set, we quantified the levels of six identified proteins for which commercial antibodies were available. Of these six proteins, Western blot examination revealed that five proteins (NSDHL, RBBP7, HNRPG, MTA3, and PRP4) were indeed expressed at higher levels in co-cultured FDCP1 cells compared with control cells (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, none of the proteins had been previously identified as secretagogues, and their functional characterization ranged from metabolic enzymes, transcriptional factors, to mediators of RNA splicing. We next sought to exclude the possibility that increased protein levels derived from increased transcription of their respective genes in FDCP1 cells mediated by components of the MLG secretome. Real-time PCR revealed no significant change of mRNA level of any of the six candidate proteins in co-cultured FCDP1 cells compared with FDCP1 cells cultured alone (Fig. 2B). We next asked whether increased protein levels were simply due to their adsorption onto FDCP1 cell membranes or were indeed due to bona fide cellular entry. Trypsin digestion of co-cultured FDCP1 cells sufficient to destroy membrane adsorbed proteins was carried out, and Western blotting revealed no change at protein level (Fig. 2C). Thus far, our co-culture experiments had used irradiated MLG cells with FDCP1 cells. When irradiation was removed from the experimental flow, levels of the candidate proteins as well as their mRNA level were not increased in FDCP1 cells compared with relevant controls (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, detailed analysis of supernatants from irradiated versus non-irradiated cells revealed that only the former harbored detectable levels of the candidate proteins suggesting that the process of irradiation was critical for enabling protein release from MLG cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Taken together, the higher level of these five proteins in FDCP1 co-cultured cells appeared to result from the direct transfer from MLG cells to FDCP1 cells after the former received irradiative stress. Two transferred proteins were retinoblastoma-binding protein 7 (RBBP7), also referred to as histone-binding protein 7 or retinoblastoma (Rb) protein-associated protein 46, and metastasis-associated protein 3 (MTA3). Both belong to the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex (21.Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 22.Fujita N. Jaye D.L. Kajita M. Geigerman C. Moreno C.S. Wade P.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Constituents of this complex are responsible for the deacetylation of lysine residues of core histones and also serve as transcriptional repressor complexes by associating with many different proteins, thus playing an important role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression, and developmental events (23.Bowen N.J. Fujita N. Kajita M. Wade P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 24.Kaji K. Caballero I.M. MacLeod R. Nichols J. Wilson V.A. Hendrich B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). RBBP7 belongs to a highly conserved WD-repeat protein (25.Hayashi T. Fujita Y. Iwasaki O. Adachi Y. Takahashi K. Yanagida M. Cell. 2004; 118: 715-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and plays an important role in chromatin remodeling, and regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation by binding directly to Rb (26.Qian Y.W. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25507-25513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and BRCA1 (27.Yarden R.I. Brody L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 4983-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which are known tumor-suppressor proteins. To further probe the significance of increased expression of RBBP7 and MTA3 in co-cultured FDCP1 cells, we surveyed the literature on potential downstream effects of these two proteins. We noted that MTA3 increases the expression of E-cadherin by its potent repressive effect on snail transcription by interacting with histone deacetylases (22.Fujita N. Jaye D.L. Kajita M. Geigerman C. Moreno C.S. Wade P.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 28.Toh Y. Nicolson G.L. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2009; 26: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Thus, we profiled levels of E-cadherin in co-cultured FDCP1 cells, and observed an increase of both protein and mRNA levels (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3A). To validate these results, we introduced highly effective siRNAs against MTA3 and RBBP7 together into MLG cells"
https://openalex.org/W1969370753,"According to the current paradigm, allergic airway inflammation is mediated by Th2 cytokines and pro-inflammatory chemokines. Since allergic inflammation is self-limited, we hypothesized that allergen challenge simultaneously induces anti-inflammatory genes to counter-balance the effects of Th2 cytokines and chemokines. To identify these putative anti-inflammatory genes, we compared the gene expression profile in the lungs of ragweed-sensitized mice four hours after challenge with either PBS or ragweed extract (RWE) using a micro-array platform. Consistent with our hypothesis, RWE challenge concurrently upregulated Th1-associated early target genes of the Il12/Stat4 pathway, such as p47 and p65 GTPases (Iigp, Tgtp and Gbp1), Socs1, Cxcl9, Cxcl10 and Gadd45g with the Th2 genes Il4, Il5, Ccl2 and Ccl7. These Th1-associated genes remain upregulated longer than the Th2 genes. Augmentation of the local Th1 milieu by administration of Il12 or CpG prior to RWE challenge further upregulated these Th1 genes. Abolition of the Th1 response by disrupting the Ifng gene increased allergic airway inflammation and abrogated RWE challenge-induced upregulation of GTPases, Cxcl9, Cxcl10 and Socs1, but not Gadd45g. Our data demonstrate that allergen challenge induces two sets of Th1-associated genes in the lungs: 1) Ifng-dependent genes such as p47 and p65 GTPases, Socs1, Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 and 2) Ifng-independent Th1-inducing genes like Gadd45g. We propose that allergen-induced airway inflammation is regulated by simultaneous upregulation of Th1 and Th2 genes, and that persistent unopposed upregulation of Th1 genes resolves allergic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2094415473,"The F-box protein Fbxw7 (also known as Fbw7, SEL-10, hCdc4 or hAgo) mediates the ubiquitylation and thereby contributes to the degradation of proteins that positively regulate cell cycle. Conditional ablation of Fbxw7 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) induces cell-cycle arrest accompanied by abnormal accumulation of the intracellular domain of Notch1 (NICD1) and c-Myc. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the accumulation of NICD1 and c-Myc induces cell-cycle arrest have remained unclear. We have now examined the expression of cell-cycle inhibitors in Fbxw7-deficient MEFs and found that the abundance of p27(Kip1) and p57(Kip2) is paradoxically decreased. This phenomenon appears to be attributable to the accumulation of NICD1, given that it was recapitulated by overexpression of NICD1 and blocked by ablation of RBP-J. Conversely, the expression of p16(Ink4a) and p19(ARF) was increased in an NICD1-independent manner in Fbxw7-null MEFs. The increased expression of p19(ARF) was recapitulated by overexpression of c-Myc and abolished by ablation of c-Myc, suggesting that the accumulation of c-Myc is primarily responsible for that of p19(ARF). In contrast, the upregulation of p16(Ink4a) appeared to be independent of c-Myc. These results indicate that cell-cycle inhibitors undergo complex regulation by the Fbxw7-mediated proteolytic system."

https://openalex.org/W2005651210,"Very little is known about the mechanisms that contribute to organ size differences between species. In the present study, we used a mouse model of embryonic pig tissue implantation to define the role of host Factor VIII in controlling the final size attained by the implant. We show here that pig embryonic spleen, pancreas, and liver all grow to an increased size in mice that are deficient in the Factor VIII clotting cascade. Similar results were obtained using the transplantation model after treatment with the low molecular weight heparin derivative Clexane which markedly enhanced transplant size. Likewise, enhanced size was found upon treatment with the direct thrombin inhibitor Dabigatran, suggesting that organ size regulation might be mediated by thrombin, downstream of Factor VIII. Considering that thrombin was shown to mediate various functions unrelated to blood clotting, either directly by cleavage of protease-activated receptors (PARs) or indirectly by cleaving osteopontin (OPN) on stroma cells, the role of PAR1 and PAR4 antagonists as well as treatment with cleaved form of OPN (tcOPN) were tested. While the former was not found to have an impact on overgrowth of embryonic pig spleen implants, marked reduction of size was noted upon treatment with the (tcOPN). Collectively, our surprising set of observations suggests that factors of the coagulation cascade have a novel role in organ size control."
