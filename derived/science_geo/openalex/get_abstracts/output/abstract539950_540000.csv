To investigate the roles of tumor-specific neoantigens and alterations in the tumor microenvironment in the response to ipilimumab, we analyzed whole exomes from pretreatment melanoma tumor biopsies and matching germline tissue samples from 110 patients. For 40 of these patients, we also obtained and analyzed transcriptome data from the pretreatment tumor samples. Overall mutational load, neoantigen load, and expression of cytolytic markers in the immune microenvironment were significantly associated with clinical benefit. However, no recurrent neoantigen peptide sequences predicted responder patient populations. Thus, detailed integrated molecular characterization of large patient cohorts may be needed to identify robust determinants of response and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors."

We used time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography at an x-ray free-electron laser to resolve the ultrafast structural changes in the carbonmonoxy myoglobin complex upon photolysis of the Fe-CO bond. Structural changes appear throughout the protein within 500 femtoseconds, with the C, F, and H helices moving away from the heme cofactor and the E and A helices moving toward it. These collective movements are predicted by hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations. Together with the observed oscillations of residues contacting the heme, our calculations support the prediction that an immediate collective response of the protein occurs upon ligand dissociation, as a result of heme vibrational modes coupling to global modes of the protein."

Its precursor comes from the very slow-growing mayapple plant. Lau and Sattely used bioinformatics, heterologous enzyme expression, and kinetic characterization, to work out the pathway that makes the precursor in mayapple (see the Perspective by O'Connor). They then successfully transplanted the full biosynthetic pathway into tobacco plants. Science , this issue p. 1224 ; see also p. 1167"
https://openalex.org/W1910957211,"Several studies have suggested that the carbon sink in the Southern Ocean-the ocean's strongest region for the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 -has weakened in recent decades. We demonstrated, on the basis of multidecadal analyses of surface ocean CO2 observations, that this weakening trend stopped around 2002, and by 2012, the Southern Ocean had regained its expected strength based on the growth of atmospheric CO2. All three Southern Ocean sectors have contributed to this reinvigoration of the carbon sink, yet differences in the processes between sectors exist, related to a tendency toward a zonally more asymmetric atmospheric circulation. The large decadal variations in the Southern Ocean carbon sink suggest a rather dynamic ocean carbon cycle that varies more in time than previously recognized."

https://openalex.org/W2134074161,"Coherent control of quantum states has been demonstrated in a variety of superconducting devices. In all these devices, the variables that are manipulated are collective electromagnetic degrees of freedom: charge, superconducting phase, or flux. Here, we demonstrate the coherent manipulation of a quantum system based on Andreev bound states, which are microscopic quasiparticle states inherent to superconducting weak links. Using a circuit quantum electrodynamics setup we perform single-shot readout of this ""Andreev qubit"". We determine its excited state lifetime and coherence time to be in the microsecond range. Quantum jumps and parity switchings are observed in continuous measurements. In addition to possible quantum information applications, such Andreev qubits are a testbed for the physics of single elementary excitations in superconductors."

https://openalex.org/W2237743540,"Generation of the soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R) is a prerequisite for pathogenic IL-6 trans-signaling, which constitutes a distinct signaling pathway of the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). Although in vitro experiments using ectopically overexpressed IL-6R and candidate proteases revealed major roles for the metalloproteinases ADAM10 and ADAM17 in IL-6R shedding, the identity of the protease(s) cleaving IL-6R in more physiological settings, or even in vivo, remains unknown. By taking advantage of specific pharmacological inhibitors and primary cells from ADAM-deficient mice we established that endogenous IL-6R of both human and murine origin is shed by ADAM17 in an induced manner, whereas constitutive release of endogenous IL-6R is largely mediated by ADAM10. Although circulating IL-6R levels are altered in various diseases, the origin of blood-borne IL-6R is still poorly understood. It has been shown previously that ADAM17 hypomorphic mice exhibit unaltered levels of serum sIL-6R. Here, by quantification of serum sIL-6R in protease-deficient mice as well as human patients we also excluded ADAM10, ADAM8, neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3 from contributing to circulating sIL-6R. Furthermore, we ruled out alternative splicing of the IL-6R mRNA as a potential source of circulating sIL-6R in the mouse. Instead, we found full-length IL-6R on circulating microvesicles, establishing microvesicle release as a novel mechanism for sIL-6R generation.

Instead, we found full-length IL-6R on circulating microvesicles, establishing microvesicle release as a novel mechanism for sIL-6R generation. The pleiotropic cytokine IL-6 can exert its signal via two extracellular routes. The first route, termed “classic” IL-6 signaling, relies on IL-6 binding the membrane IL-6R receptor (IL-6R), which in turn leads to dimerization of the second receptor subunit glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and initiation of intracellular signaling cascades (1Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Principles of interleukin (IL)-6-type cytokine signalling and its regulation.Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). In contrast to gp130, which is present on almost every cell of the body, IL-6R expression is much more restricted with mainly hepatocytes and certain leukocyte subtypes bearing IL-6R. Signaling via membrane-bound IL-6R is rather anti-inflammatory and has been shown to be critically involved in plasma cell differentiation, the acute phase response, and fever induction (2Chalaris A. Garbers C. Rabe B. Rose-John S. Scheller J. The soluble interleukin 6 receptor: generation and role in inflammation and cancer.Eur J. Cell Biol. 2011; 90: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Alternatively, IL-6 can engage a soluble form of the IL-6R in solution with the same affinity as the membrane-bound receptor. The resulting binary cytokine complex exhibits agonistic properties and is able to activate cells that only express gp130 but lack membrane-bound IL-6R. This alternative IL-6 signaling pathway has been termed “IL-6 trans-signaling” and greatly expands the spectrum of IL-6 responsive cells (3Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Soluble receptors for cytokines and growth factors: generation and biological function.Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). It has become evident in recent years that most of the pro-inflammatory and deleterious actions of IL-6, which includes generation of autoimmune Th17 cells, inhibition of T cell apoptosis, or proliferation of malignant epithelial cells, can in fact be attributed to IL-6 trans-signaling (4Scheller J. Garbers C. Rose-John S. Interleukin-6: from basic biology to selective blockade of pro-inflammatory activities.Semin. Immunol. 2014; 26: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In humans, a soluble form of the IL-6R is generated by proteolytic release of the ectodomain as well as transcription from an alternatively spliced mRNA lacking the transmembrane region (5Müllberg J. Schooltink H. Stoyan T. Günther M. Graeve L. Buse G. Mackiewicz A. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. The soluble interleukin-6 receptor is generated by shedding.Eur. J.

Isolation of an mRNA encoding a soluble form of the human interleukin-6 receptor.Cytokine. 1992; 4: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Ectodomain shedding of transmembrane proteins represents a swift and highly regulable response of the cell toward extracellular stimuli and is therefore ideally suited to counteract inflammatory insults (7Khokha R. Murthy A. Weiss A. Metalloproteinases and their natural inhibitors in inflammation and immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 649-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). As IL-6R shedding can initiate pathogenic IL-6 trans-signaling, it is of high clinical relevance to identify the protease responsible for sIL-6R release. Although previous studies on IL-6R cleavage almost exclusively relied on ectopically overexpressed receptors or proteases, the closely related proteases ADAM10 3The abbreviations used are: ADAMa disintegrin and metalloproteinaseapoEapolipoprotein EBMDMbone marrow-derived macrophageDPPIdipeptidylpeptidase IPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateTNFRItumor necrosis factor receptor 1TNFαtumor necrosis factor αDLSdynamic light scatteringPLSPapillon-Lefèvre syndromegp130glycoprotein 130. and ADAM17 were identified as IL-6R sheddases in vitro (8Matthews V.

However, the identity of the enzyme that processes IL-6R in vivo, whether under physiological or pathological conditions, remains elusive. In this study, we used cells naturally expressing high levels of IL-6R, as opposed to cells ectopically expressing IL-6R after transfection with an IL-6R cDNA, to elucidate the roles of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in IL-6R cleavage. In contrast to a previous report showing that upon stimulation ectopically expressed murine IL-6R is shed by ADAM10, we report that endogenous IL-6R in human and murine cells is cleaved by ADAM17 in an induced fashion. On the other hand, constitutive release of endogenous IL-6R, regardless of the species, is clearly mediated by ADAM10. a disintegrin and metalloproteinase apolipoprotein E bone marrow-derived macrophage dipeptidylpeptidase I phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 tumor necrosis factor α dynamic light scattering Papillon-Lefèvre syndrome glycoprotein 130. A soluble form of the IL-6R is present in human serum at relatively high levels and several reports have connected serum sIL-6R generation to alternative mRNA splicing (10Honda M. Yamamoto S.

However, whereas serum sIL-6R levels attributed to alternative splicing vary considerably between studies, the bulk of serum sIL-6R (>65%) originates from processes other than differential mRNA splicing (12Dimitrov S. Lange T. Benedict C. Nowell M.A. Jones S.A. Scheller J. Rose-John S. Born J.

A recently identified SNP in the human IL-6R gene located within the ADAM17 cleavage site, which leads to increased sIL-6R protein amounts in the circulation, strongly suggests involvement of a metalloprotease of the ADAM family in serum sIL-6R generation (14Reich D.

Surprisingly, hypomorphic ADAM17 mutant mice showing only residual proteolytic activity (5%) exhibit unaltered sIL-6R serum levels (17Chalaris A. Adam N. Sina C. Rosenstiel P. Lehmann-Koch J.

This indicates that either an alternative protease, e.g. ADAM10, or even an entirely different mechanism is responsible for serum sIL-6R generation. Here, we show that conditional ablation of ADAM10 in myeloid cells, which have been reported to generate the bulk (63%) of blood-borne sIL-6R (18McFarland-Mancini M.M. Funk H.M. Paluch A.M. Zhou M.

We further excluded neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3, which are highly abundant in myeloid cells, from contributing to sIL-6R generation in mouse as well as human blood. Moreover, by employing an elaborate PCR strategy we ruled out alternative splicing as a mechanism generating serum sIL-6R in the mouse. Instead, we were able to locate membrane-associated IL-6R on circulating microvesicles, challenging the prevailing dogma that only metalloproteinases and, in humans, alternative splicing account for the release of sIL-6R into the circulation. THP-1, U937, RAW264.7, and J774.A1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; LGC Standards, Wesel, Germany) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin.

Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from human blood by density gradient centrifugation and monocytes were subsequently purified with CD14 MicroBeads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany).

Nine patients suffering from Papillon Lefèvre syndrome and 9 healthy gender and age (±2 years; in 1 pair 3 years and 6 months) matched control individuals were recruited at the Dept. of Periodontology, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany. Twenty ml of blood were sampled from arm veins and sera was obtained by centrifugation. The serum was stored at −80 °C and after all patients had been sampled sent to Kiel University. All patients underwent a written, informed-consent process approved by the ethics commission of the Medical Faculty of the Goethe-University Frankfurt (31/05). 105 THP-1 cells/96-well were stimulated with PMA ± inhibitors as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were subsequently washed with FACS buffer (1% BSA, PBS) and Fc receptors were blocked with anti-CD16/CD32 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer. Human IL-6R was detected with mouse mAb 4–11 (1:400) and the stained cells were visualized with allophycocyanin-coupled rat anti-mouse IgG1 (eBioscience) by flow cytometry (FACS Canto I, BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA). EDTA mouse blood was blocked with anti-mouse CD16/32 antibody (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) and the different immune cell subsets were detected with anti-CD45, anti-CD11b, anti-Ly6G, anti-Ly6C, anti-CD115, anti-B220, and anti-CD3 (all BioLegend). Murine IL-6R surface expression was assessed using anti-mouse IL-6R mAb (D7715A7, BioLegend). Red blood cells were subsequently lysed and the remaining leukocytes were fixed with RBC lysis/fixation solution (BioLegend), followed by flow cytometry. Heparinized whole human blood was diluted (1:10) in RPMI medium and stimulated with LPS ± inhibitors as indicated in the figure legends. After Fc receptors were blocked (anti-CD16/CD32, eBioscience), human IL-6R expression on circulating monocytes was gauged by flow cytometry using anti-human IL-6R mAb (clone UV4, BioLegend) and anti-human CD14 mAb (clone M5E2, BioLegend).

Microvesicle-free serum was generated by ultracentrifugation (2 h, 100,000 × g) and subsequently used for ELISA analysis. Levels of murine and human sIL-6R were measured using DuoSet ELISA kits from R&D Systems. 1 ml of human serum was diluted with 1 volume of PBS and serum antibodies were depleted by incubating diluted serum twice with a 1:1 mixture of Protein A- and G-Sepharose at 4 °C overnight. Samples were cleared from dead cells and debris by low-speed centrifugation (30 min, 2,000 × g) and afterward spun for 45 min at 12,000 × g to precipitate larger vesicles. The supernatant was then loaded onto a 2-ml 40% sucrose/PBS cushion and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C (Optima LE-80K, Type 70 Ti Rotor; Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). Microvesicle-containing sucrose was diluted with 5 volumes of PBS and again centrifuged for 2 h at 100,000 × g. For Western blotting the microvesicle pellet was lysed in 100 μl of RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors, whereas microvesicles were suspended in PBS for analysis by dynamic light scattering (DLS). DLS measurements were performed on a Laser Spectroscatter 201 (RiNA) at an angle of 90 and 22 °C. Ten μl of microvesicle suspension were applied to a quartz cuvette and size distribution was depicted as the median occurrence out of 100 measurements. RNA was extracted from cells and tissues using the GeneJET RNA purification kit (Fermentas, Thermo Scientific). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA with RevertAidTM Moloney MuLV reverse transcriptase (Fermentas, Thermo Scientific) using oligo(dT)18 primer.

Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. from at least two independent experiments. Statistical significance was calculated using Student's t test and depicted in the figures when n ≥ 3. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. As most, if not all, studies on sIL-6R release so far were carried out in somewhat artificial cellular systems, where either IL-6R or a candidate protease, often genetically engineered, were ectopically introduced into cells, we sought to address IL-6R shedding in a more physiological setting using cells that endogenously express IL-6R. THP-1 as well as U937 cells are human cancer cell lines of monocytic origin that naturally harbor substantial amounts of membrane-bound IL-6R, as evidenced by flow cytometry (Fig. 1C, data not shown). The phorbol ester PMA strongly activates protein kinases PKC and ERK and has widely been used as an activator of ADAM17 (28Horiuchi K. Le Gall S. Schulte M. Yamaguchi T. Reiss K. Murphy G. Toyama Y. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Blobel C.P. Substrate selectivity of epidermal growth factor-receptor ligand sheddases and their regulation by phorbol esters and calcium influx.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). ELISA measurements revealed that sIL-6R protein accumulated in the supernatant of THP-1 and U937 cells upon PMA stimulation, which could be blocked when metalloproteases were globally inhibited by Marimastat (Fig. 1, A and B). To narrow down the metalloproteases involved in endogenous IL-6R shedding we took advantage of the specific inhibitor pair GI254023X/GW280264X, which distinguishes between ADAM17- and ADAM10-mediated proteolysis. Whereas GW280264X blocks both ADAM17 and ADAM10, GI254023X inhibits ADAM10 only (for conciseness inhibitors will be abbreviated to GW and GI hereafter). In both monocytic cell lines PMA-induced shedding was strongly reduced after administration of GW, whereas GI had almost no effect, implicating ADAM17 in stimulated IL-6R proteolysis (Fig. 1, A and B). Small molecule inhibitors tend to have off-target effects and indeed both GI and GW have been reported to additionally inhibit certain matrix metalloproteases (29Ludwig A. Hundhausen C. Lambert M.H. Broadway N. Andrews R.C. Bickett D.M. Leesnitzer M.A. Becherer J.D. Metalloproteinase inhibitors for the disintegrin-like metalloproteinases ADAM10 and ADAM17 that differentially block constitutive and phorbol ester-inducible shedding of cell surface molecules.Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2005; 8: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to additionally validate our results and took advantage of a recently developed ADAM17 inhibitory antibody, which due to its ”cross-domain“ architecture is highly specific for human ADAM17 (19Tape C.J. Willems S.H. Dombernowsky S.L. Stanley P.L. Fogarasi M. Ouwehand W. McCafferty J. Murphy G. Cross-domain inhibition of TACE ectodomain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 5578-5583Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). IL-6R shedding after PMA stimulation was significantly reduced in the presence of the antagonistic ADAM17 antibody D1(A12) confirming that cleavage of the endogenous human receptor is in fact relying on ADAM17 (Fig. 1, A and B). In accordance with this, FACS analysis of PMA-treated THP-1 cells showed drastically reduced levels of cell surface IL-6R compared with untreated cells. Consistent with ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding, the PMA-induced decrease in IL-6R surface expression was inhibited by addition of GW, but not GI (Fig. 1C). Importantly, incubation of THP-1 cells with D1(A12) antibody blocked PMA-induced loss of surface IL-6R to even pre-treatment levels (Fig. 1D). We sought to put our results into a more physiological context and treated in vitro differentiated primary human macrophages with PMA in order to activate ADAM17. Upon stimulation human macrophages released increased amounts of soluble IL-6R, which could be inhibited by GW and D1(A12), but not GI (Fig. 1E). Although PMA is frequently used to trigger ADAM17 activity, we sought to include a more physiological and well defined stimulus of ADAM17-mediated proteolysis. LPS is commonly used to mimic bacterial infection and has been shown to strongly trigger ADAM17-mediated TNFα release (29Ludwig A. Hundhausen C. Lambert M.H. Broadway N. Andrews R.C. Bickett D.M. Leesnitzer M.A. Becherer J.D. Metalloproteinase inhibitors for the disintegrin-like metalloproteinases ADAM10 and ADAM17 that differentially block constitutive and phorbol ester-inducible shedding of cell surface molecules.Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2005; 8: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that LPS might also lead to proteolytic release of endogenous IL-6R from LPS-responsive cells and thus treated human whole blood with LPS followed by assessment of IL-6R surface expression. Flow cytometry revealed that levels of surface IL-6R on CD14+ monocytes were strongly diminished after LPS stimulation, but could be restored by concomitant treatment with GW as well as D1(A12), but not GI (Fig. 1F). These data closely reflect the results obtained with THP-1 and U937 cells and implicates ADAM17 in the proteolytic cleavage of endogenous IL-6R from primary human macrophages and circulating monocytes. To investigate the constitutive release of endogenous IL-6R we incubated THP-1 and U937 cells overnight with or without GI and GW and measured accumulating sIL-6R protein in the cell supernatant by ELISA. Both cell lines showed robust IL-6R shedding in the absence of stimulation, which could be blocked by GI as well as GW (Fig. 1G and data not shown). These results indicate that ADAM10 is critically involved in the constitutive release of endogenous IL-6R from human cells, which confirms previous studies using ectopically expressed human IL-6R (8Matthews V.

https://openalex.org/W2232390838,"Itaconate is a nonamino organic acid exhibiting antimicrobial effects. It has been recently identified in cells of macrophage lineage as a product of an enzyme encoded by immunoresponsive gene 1 (Irg1), acting on the citric acid cycle intermediate cis-aconitate. In mitochondria, itaconate can be converted by succinate-coenzyme A (CoA) ligase to itaconyl-CoA at the expense of ATP (or GTP), and is also a weak competitive inhibitor of complex II. Here, we investigated specific bioenergetic effects of increased itaconate production mediated by LPS-induced stimulation of Irg1 in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and RAW-264.7 cells. In rotenone-treated macrophage cells, stimulation by LPS led to impairment in substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP) of in situ mitochondria, deduced by a reversal in the directionality of the adenine nucleotide translocase operation. In RAW-264.7 cells, the LPS-induced impairment in SLP was reversed by short-interfering RNA(siRNA)—but not scrambled siRNA—treatment directed against Irg1. LPS dose-dependently inhibited oxygen consumption rates (61-91%) and elevated glycolysis rates (>21%) in BMDM but not RAW-264.7 cells, studied under various metabolic conditions. In isolated mouse liver mitochondria treated with rotenone, itaconate dose-dependently (0.5-2 mM) reversed the operation of adenine nucleotide translocase, implying impairment in SLP, an effect that was partially mimicked by malonate. However, malonate yielded greater ADP-induced depolarizations (3-19%) than itaconate. We postulate that itaconate abolishes SLP due to 1) a “CoA trap” in the form of itaconyl-CoA that negatively affects the upstream supply of succinyl-CoA from the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex; 2) depletion of ATP (or GTP), which are required for the thioesterification by succinate-CoA ligase; and 3) inhibition of complex II leading to a buildup of succinate which shifts succinate-CoA ligase equilibrium toward ATP (or GTP) utilization. Our results support the notion that Irg1-expressing cells of macrophage lineage lose the capacity of mitochondrial SLP for producing itaconate during mounting of an immune defense.—Németh, B., Doczi, J., Csete, D., Kacso, G., Ravasz, D., Adams, D., Kiss, G., Nagy, A.

Here, our objective was to examine the duodenal microbiota between obese and normal volunteers using metagenomic techniques. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested duodenal samples from five obese and five normal volunteers using 16S rDNA V6 pyrosequencing and Illumina MiSeq deep sequencing. The predominant phyla of the duodenal microbiota were Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, whereas Bacteroidetes were absent. Obese individuals had a significant increase in anaerobic genera (p < 0.001) and a higher abundance of genes encoding Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (p = 0.0018) compared to the control group. Obese individuals also had a reduced abundance of genes encoding sucrose phosphorylase (p = 0.015) and 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme (p = 0.05). Normal weight people had significantly increased FabK (p = 0.027), and the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway revealed the presence of phospholipase A1 only in the control group (p = 0.05). Conclusions/Significance The duodenal microbiota of obese individuals exhibit alterations in the fatty acid and sucrose breakdown pathways, probably induced by diet imbalance."

https://openalex.org/W2176091847,"The Gauss-peak spectra (GPS) method represents individual pigment spectra as weighted sums of Gaussian functions, and uses these to model absorbance spectra of phytoplankton pigment mixtures. We here present several improvements for this type of methodology, including adaptation to plate reader technology and efficient model fitting by open source software. We use a one-step modeling of both pigment absorption and background attenuation with non-negative least squares, following a one-time instrument-specific calibration. The fitted background is shown to be higher than a solvent blank, with features reflecting contributions from both scatter and non-pigment absorption. We assessed pigment aliasing due to absorption spectra similarity by Monte Carlo simulation, and used this information to select a robust set of identifiable pigments that are also expected to be common in natural samples. To test the method’s performance, we analyzed absorbance spectra of pigment extracts from sediment cores, 75 natural lake samples, and four phytoplankton cultures, and compared the estimated pigment concentrations with concentrations obtained using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The deviance between observed and fitted spectra was generally very low, indicating that measured spectra could successfully be reconstructed as weighted sums of pigment and background components. Concentrations of total chlorophylls and total carotenoids could accurately be estimated for both sediment and lake samples, but individual pigment concentrations (especially carotenoids) proved difficult to resolve due to similarity between their absorbance spectra. In general, our modified-GPS method provides an improvement of the GPS method that is a fast, inexpensive, and high-throughput alternative for screening of pigment composition in samples of phytoplankton material."

JAKs are characterized by dual kinase domain: a tyrosine kinase domain (JH1) that is preceded by a pseudokinase domain (JH2). The majority of disease-associated mutations in JAKs map to JH2, demonstrating its central regulatory function. JH2s were considered catalytically inactive, but JAK2 JH2 was found to have low autoregulatory catalytic activity. Whether the other JAK JH2s share ATP binding and enzymatic activity has been unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of TYK2 JH2 in complex with adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (ATP-γS) and characterize its nucleotide binding by biochemical and biophysical methods. TYK2 JH2 did not show phosphotransfer activity, but it binds ATP and the nucleotide binding stabilizes the protein without inducing major conformational changes. Mutation of the JH2 ATP-binding pocket increased basal TYK2 phosphorylation and downstream signaling. The overall structural characteristics of TYK2 JH2 resemble JAK2 JH2, but distinct stabilizing molecular interactions around helix αAL in the activation loop provide a structural basis for differences in substrate access and catalytic activities among JAK family JH2s. The structural and biochemical data suggest that ATP binding is functionally important for both TYK2 and JAK2 JH2s, whereas the regulatory phosphorylation appears to be a unique property of JAK2.

The JH2s of JAKs lack aspartic acid in the HRD (His-Arg-Asp) motif of the catalytic loop and have an incomplete Gly-rich loop. Recently, JAK2 JH2 and HER3, which also has a non-canonical substitution at the aspartic acid position in the HRD motif, were shown to bind ATP and retain low catalytic activity, indicating that the lack of Asp can be at least partly compensated for (17Shi F.

Crystal structures of inhibitor-bound TYK2 JH2 have recently been solved, but its biochemical and nucleotide binding characteristics are still elusive. Several members of the pseudokinase family, including TYK2, are linked to human diseases, which has raised interest toward their therapeutic targeting. Elucidation of the determinants of nucleotide binding and catalytic activity in pseudokinases is of significant relevance in this context as ATP competitive compounds are one of the most rapidly growing class of drugs. Here we have investigated the structure and function of the pseudokinase domain of TYK2, with a focus on the role of nucleotide binding and determinants of catalytic activity. TYK2 JH2 (556–871) was subcloned into a pFastBac HT vector (Invitrogen) with a His6 tag at the N terminus and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site between the His6 tag and TYK2. TYK2 protein was expressed in baculovirus High Five cells (Invitrogen) grown at 27 °C for 72 h in ESF921 insect cell media (Expression Systems). Cells were processed with a Microfluidizer, and the supernatant was loaded on an affinity column containing Talon IMAC beads (Clontech) and eluted with a gradient of 5–500 mm imidazole. The protein was cleaved with recombinant tobacco etch virus at 4 °C overnight. The digested protein was desalted into MonoQ buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol). The protein was further purified using anion-exchange (MonoQ) and size exclusion (Superdex 200) chromatography. The purified protein was highly homogeneous and was concentrated to 7 mg/ml in the crystallization buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 10% glycerol) before crystallization.

Biotinylated TYK2 JH2 was coupled to immobilized streptavidin on a CM7 sensor chip (GE Healthcare). For kinetic experiments, a flow rate of 50 μl/min was used. The running buffer contains 75 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. The concentration of ATP was changed from 300 μm to 400 nm. Data were analyzed with the Biacore T-1000 evaluation software, version 2.0 (GE Healthcare). 20 μl of 0.5 mg/ml TYK2 JH2 domain (556–871) was incubated with 1 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2. 5 μl of 100× SYPRO Orange dye was added to the mixture. The fluorescence was measured on a Bio-Rad CFX-96 real time PCR machine, and the temperature was increased from 25 to 95 °C with a ramping speed of 1 °C/min. Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) data were collected at synchrotron beamline 12.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) (Berkeley, CA). The wavelength λ = 1.0 Å and sample-to-detector distance were set to 1.5 m, resulting in scattering vectors, q, ranging from 0.01 to 0.33 Å−1. The scattering vector is defined as q = 4π sinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle. All experiments were performed at 20 °C, and data were processed as described (34Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S.

The experimental SAXS data for different protein concentrations were investigated for aggregation using Guinier plots (35Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-angle scattering of x-rays. Wiley, New York1955Google Scholar). The radius of gyration Rg was derived by the Guinier approximation I(q) = I(0) exp(−q2Rg2/3) with the limits qRg < 1.3. The program SCATTER was used to compute the pair-distance distribution functions, P(r) (36Förster S. Apostol L. Bras W.

ADP production following ATP hydrolysis was measured using the ADP-Glo kinase assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Activity measurements were done following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, ADP production was measured in 25-μl reaction volumes in 40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MnCl2, and 100 μm ATP. Reactions were started by adding 500 or 400 ng of recombinant TYK2 JH2 or JAK2 JH2, respectively, and stopped after 0, 20, 40, or 60 min by adding the ADP-Glo reagent. After the addition of the kinase detection reagent, produced luminescence was compared with results from an ADP/ATP standard curve. Measurements were done in triplicate. Mant-ATP (Jena Biosciences) binding to TYK2 JH2 was measured using a QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International) by analyzing FRET between the protein and Mant. Excitation wavelength was 280 nm, while emitted fluorescence was scanned from 300 to 500 nm. For Kd determination, increasing concentrations of concentrated Mant-ATP stocks were added to a buffer solution of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, and 2 μm recombinant JH2 protein in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2. Binding was observed as emitted fluorescence at 440–450 nm, and the measured fluorescence values were corrected for the primary inner filter effect. The Kd value was calculated from quadruplicate measurements using GraphPad Prism 5.02 essentially as described in Ref. 37Zeqiraj E. Filippi B.M. Goldie S. Navratilova I. Boudeau J. Deak M.

Human TYK2 cDNA (TYK2 WT) was cloned into the pCINeo vector (Promega) with a C-terminal HA tag. TYK2 K642A and K930R mutations were introduced using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing. TYK2-deficient 11,1 cells and Sββ cells (kindly provided by S. Pellegrini) have been described previously (38Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

After 8 h, cells were starved overnight and stimulated with 1000 units/ml IFN-α (PeproTech) or 100 units/ml IL-12 (PeproTech) followed by lysis in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science). TYK2 was immunoprecipitated using anti-TYK2 antibody (Millipore, catalogue number 06-638), and phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phospho-Tyr (4G10, Millipore, catalogue number 05-321). STAT1 phosphorylation was analyzed using anti-pSTAT1 antibody (Cell Signaling, catalogue number 9171L). The binding of ATP to TYK2 JH2 was assessed using multiple analytic methods. We measured the binding kinetics of ATP to TYK2 JH2 using surface plasmon resonance (Biacore). The experiments used recombinant human TYK2 JH2 (556–871). As shown in Fig. 1A, ATP binds to TYK2 JH2 with a fast-on and fast-off rate and a measured Kd of 24 μm. We also used a fluorescent methylanthraniloyl ATP analog (Mant-ATP) in a spectrofluorometric assay (37Zeqiraj E. Filippi B.M. Goldie S. Navratilova I. Boudeau J. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M. ATP and MO25α regulate the conformational state of the STRADα pseudokinase and activation of the LKB1 tumour suppressor.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7e1000126Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) to confirm the binding of ATP to TYK2 JH2. The results showed a Kd of 15 μm for Mant-ATP (Fig. 1B), which is weaker than the Mant-ATP binding affinity for JAK2 JH2 (Kd ∼1 μm) (18Ungureanu D. Wu J. Pekkala T. Niranjan Y. Young C. Jensen O.N. Xu C.F. Neubert T.A. Skoda R.C. Hubbard S.R. Silvennoinen O. The pseudokinase domain of JAK2 is a dual-specificity protein kinase that negatively regulates cytokine signaling.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 971-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Next we examined the effect of ATP binding to TYK2 JH2. We used a differential scanning fluorescence assay to study the thermal melting of TYK2 JH2 in the presence and absence of ATP. In this assay, the fluorescent dye SYPRO Orange binds to the hydrophobic regions that are exposed when proteins undergo thermal unfolding, leading to an increase in fluorescence intensity. As shown in Fig. 1C, the apo TYK2 JH2 showed a Tm of 44 °C. Upon ATP binding, the melting temperature of JH2 increased by 4 °C, suggesting that ATP binding stabilizes JH2. To find out whether ATP binding results in conformational changes, we performed SAXS experiments on both apo and ATP-bound JH2s. The scattering profiles of JH2 are virtually identical in the presence and absence of Mg-ATP (Fig. 1D) with a calculated radius of gyration (Rg) of 24.2 nm for apo and 24.0 nm in the presence of Mg-ATP. Taken together, these data suggest that ATP binding does not induce major overall conformational change in JH2, but rather stabilizes the domain. To address the question whether TYK2 JH2 possesses enzymatic kinase activity, we employed an ADP-Glo kinase assay to compare hydrolysis activity of TYK2 JH2 with JAK2 JH2, which was recently found to be an active, albeit weak kinase (18Ungureanu D. Wu J. Pekkala T. Niranjan Y. Young C. Jensen O.N. Xu C.F. Neubert T.A. Skoda R.C. Hubbard S.R. Silvennoinen O. The pseudokinase domain of JAK2 is a dual-specificity protein kinase that negatively regulates cytokine signaling.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 971-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The results show that TYK2 JH2 was able to catalyze ADP production from ATP at rates of ∼50% of that of JAK2 JH2 (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that, despite deviations in its sequence from canonical protein kinases, TYK2 JH2 possesses some residual activity. To further assess the possible kinase activity, we performed in vitro kinase reactions to test for autophosphorylation activity and subjected the purified proteins to mass spectrometry analysis. However, we could not identify any consistent phosphorylation in JH2 (data not shown). Thus, although TYK2 JH2 retains very low ability to hydrolyze ATP, it does not show autophosphorylation and can be considered a catalytically incompetent pseudokinase. In accordance, the regulatory autophosphorylation sites in JAK2 JH2 are not conserved in TYK2 JH2. We were interested to investigate whether the ATP binding capability of TYK2 JH2 is involved in the JH2-mediated regulation of TYK2 activity, as has been earlier reported for JAK2 JH2 (40Liu K.D. Gaffen S.L. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Janus kinases in interleukin-2-mediated signaling: JAK1 and JAK3 are differentially regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation.Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 817-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To this end, the catalytic lysine in the β3 strand of JH2 was mutated to alanine and the full-length TYK2 harboring the corresponding JH2 K642A mutation was analyzed in IFNα and IL-12 signaling. TYK2-deficient 11,1 or Sββ cells were transfected with HA-tagged TYK2 constructs and analyzed for TYK2 JH1 activation loop phosphorylation by Western blotting. Fig. 2B shows"

However, their relative importance in mediating estrogen protective action is unknown. We found that, in the male mouse ventricle, Gper1 transcripts are three- and seventeen-fold more abundant than Esr1 and Esr2 mRNAs, respectively. Analysis of the three ER knockouts (Esr1-/-, Esr2-/- and Gper1-/-) showed that only the Gper1-/- hearts lost their ability to be protected by 40 nM estrogen as measured by heart function, infarct size and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, an index of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) activity. Analysis of Akt, ERK1/2 and GSK-3β salvage kinases uncovered Akt and ERK1/2 transient activation by estrogen whose phosphorylation increased during the first 5 min of non-ischemic perfusion. All these increase in phosphorylation effects were abrogated in Gper1-/-. Inhibition of MEK1/2/ERK1/2 (1 μM U0126) and PI-3K/Akt (10 μM LY294002) signaling showed that the MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathway via GSK-3β exclusively was responsible for cardioprotection as an addition of U0126 prevented estrogen-induced GSK-3β increased phosphorylation, resistance to mitochondrial Ca2+-overload, functional recovery and protection against infarction. Further, inhibiting PKC translocation (1 μM chelerythrin-chloride) abolished estrogen-induced cardioprotection. These data indicate that estrogen-Gper1 acute coupling plays a key role in cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion injury in male mouse via a cascade involving PKC translocation, ERK1/2/GSK-3β phosphorylation leading to the inhibition of the mPTP opening."
https://openalex.org/W2179645736,"The suitability of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in regenerative medicine relies on retention of their proliferative expansion potential in conjunction with the ability to differentiate toward multiple lineages. Successful utilisation of these cells in clinical applications linked to tissue regeneration requires consideration of biomarker expression, time in culture and donor age, as well as their ability to differentiate towards mesenchymal (bone, cartilage, fat) or non-mesenchymal (e.g., neural) lineages. To identify potential therapeutic suitability we examined hMSCs after extended expansion including morphological changes, potency (stemness) and multilineage potential. Commercially available hMSC populations were expanded in vitro for > 20 passages, equating to > 60 days and > 50 population doublings. Distinct growth phases (A-C) were observed during serial passaging and cells were characterised for stemness and lineage markers at representative stages (Phase A: P+5, approximately 13 days in culture; Phase B: P+7, approximately 20 days in culture; and Phase C: P+13, approximately 43 days in culture). Cell surface markers, stem cell markers and lineage-specific markers were characterised by FACS, ICC and Q-PCR revealing MSCs maintained their multilineage potential, including neural lineages throughout expansion. Co-expression of multiple lineage markers along with continued CD45 expression in MSCs did not affect completion of osteogenic and adipogenic specification or the formation of neurospheres. Improved standardised isolation and characterisation of MSCs may facilitate the identification of biomarkers to improve therapeutic efficacy to ensure increased reproducibility and routine production of MSCs for therapeutic applications including neural repair."
https://openalex.org/W2240047080,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of neurons and formation of pathological extracellular deposits induced by amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). Numerous studies have established Aβ amyloidogenesis as a hallmark of AD pathogenesis, particularly with respect to mitochondrial dysfunction. We have previously shown that glycolytic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) forms amyloid-like aggregates upon exposure to oxidative stress and that these aggregates contribute to neuronal cell death. Here, we report that GAPDH aggregates accelerate Aβ amyloidogenesis and subsequent neuronal cell death both in vitro and in vivo. Co-incubation of Aβ40 with small amounts of GAPDH aggregates significantly enhanced Aβ40 amyloidogenesis, as assessed by in vitro thioflavin-T assays. Similarly, structural analyses using Congo red staining, circular dichroism, and atomic force microscopy revealed that GAPDH aggregates induced Aβ40 amyloidogenesis. In PC12 cells, GAPDH aggregates augmented Aβ40-induced cell death, concomitant with disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, mice injected intracerebroventricularly with Aβ40 co-incubated with GAPDH aggregates exhibited Aβ40-induced pyramidal cell death and gliosis in the hippocampal CA3 region. These observations were accompanied by nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor and cytosolic release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Finally, in the 3×Tg-AD mouse model of AD, GAPDH/Aβ co-aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction were consistently detected in an age-dependent manner, and Aβ aggregate formation was attenuated by GAPDH siRNA treatment. Thus, this study suggests that GAPDH aggregates accelerate Aβ amyloidogenesis, subsequently leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal cell death in the pathogenesis of AD."
https://openalex.org/W1729105556,"After the 2011 accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, nursing-home residents and staff were evacuated voluntarily from damaged areas to avoid radiation exposure. Unfortunately, the evacuation resulted in increased mortalities among nursing home residents. We assessed the risk trade-off between evacuation and radiation for 191 residents and 184 staff at three nursing homes by using the same detriment indicator, namely loss of life expectancy (LLE), under four scenarios, i.e. “rapid evacuation (in accordance with the actual situation; i.e. evacuation on 22 March),” “deliberate evacuation (i.e. evacuation on 20 June),” “20-mSv exposure,” and “100-mSv exposure.” The LLE from evacuation-related mortality among nursing home residents was assessed with survival probability data from nursing homes in the city of Minamisoma and the city of Soma. The LLE from radiation mortality was calculated from the estimated age-specific mortality rates from leukemia and all solid cancers based on the additional effective doses and the survival probabilities. The total LLE of residents due to evacuation-related risks in rapid evacuation was 11,000 persons-d—much higher than the total LLEs of residents and staff due to radiation in the other scenarios (27, 1100, and 5800 persons-d for deliberate evacuation, 20 mSv-exposure, and 100 mSv-exposure, respectively). The latitude for reducing evacuation risks among nursing home residents is surprisingly large. Evacuation regulation and planning should therefore be well balanced with the trade-offs against radiation risks. This is the first quantitative assessment of the risk trade-off between radiation exposure and evacuation after a nuclear power plant accident."
https://openalex.org/W2125962197,"Subduction zone megathrust faults produce most of the world's largest earthquakes. Although the physical properties of these faults are difficult to observe directly, their frictional strength can be estimated indirectly by constraining the orientations of the stresses that act on them. A global investigation of stress orientations in subduction zones finds that the maximum compressive stress axis plunges systematically trenchward, consistently making an angle of 45° to 60° with respect to the subduction megathrust fault. These angles indicate that the megathrust fault is not substantially weaker than its surroundings. Together with several other lines of evidence, this implies that subduction zone megathrusts are weak faults in a low-stress environment. The deforming outer accretionary wedge may decouple the stress state along the megathrust from the constraints of the free surface."

https://openalex.org/W1864983342,"Biological invasions are a major threat to biodiversity; however, the degree of impact can vary depending on the ecosystem and taxa. Here, we test whether a top invader at a global scale, the tree Robinia pseudoacacia (black locust or false acacia), which is known to profoundly change site conditions, significantly affects urban animal diversity. As a first multi-taxon study of this kind, we analyzed the effects of Robinia dominance on 18 arthropod taxa by pairwise comparisons of woodlands in Berlin, Germany, that were dominated by R. pseudoacacia or the native pioneer tree Betula pendula. As a negative effect, abundances of five arthropod taxa decreased (Chilopoda, Formicidae, Diptera, Heteroptera, Hymenoptera); 13 others were not affected. Woodland type affected species composition of carabids and functional groups in spiders, but surprisingly did not decrease alpha and beta diversity of carabid and spider assemblages or the number of endangered species. Tree invasion thus did not induce biotic homogenization at the habitat scale. We detected no positive effects of alien dominance. Our results illustrate that invasions by a major tree invader can induce species turnover in ground-dwelling arthropods, but do not necessarily reduce arthropod species abundances or diversity and might thus contribute to the conservation of epigeal invertebrates in urban settings. Considering the context of invasion impacts thus helps to set priorities in managing biological invasions and can illustrate the potential of novel ecosystems to maintain urban biodiversity."

https://openalex.org/W2210209691,"Many bacterial pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, use type IVa pili (T4aP) for attachment and twitching motility. T4aP are composed primarily of major pilin subunits, which are repeatedly assembled and disassembled to mediate function. A group of pilin-like proteins, the minor pilins FimU and PilVWXE, prime pilus assembly and are incorporated into the pilus. We showed previously that minor pilin PilE depends on the putative priming subcomplex PilVWX and the non-pilin protein PilY1 for incorporation into pili, and that with FimU, PilE may couple the priming subcomplex to the major pilin PilA, allowing for efficient pilus assembly. Here we provide further support for this model, showing interaction of PilE with other minor pilins and the major pilin. A 1.25 A crystal structure of PilEΔ1-28 shows a typical type IV pilin fold, demonstrating how it may be incorporated into the pilus. Despite limited sequence identity, PilE is structurally similar to Neisseria meningitidis minor pilins PilXNm and PilVNm, recently suggested via characterization of mCherry fusions to modulate pilus assembly from within the periplasm. A P. aeruginosa PilE-mCherry fusion failed to complement twitching motility or piliation of a pilE mutant. However, in a retraction-deficient strain where surface piliation depends solely on PilE, the fusion construct restored some surface piliation. PilE-mCherry was present in sheared surface fractions, suggesting that it was incorporated into pili. Together, these data provide evidence that PilE, the sole P. aeruginosa equivalent of PilXNm and PilVNm, likely connects a priming subcomplex to the major pilin, promoting efficient assembly of T4aP."

The adult heart is particularly vulnerable to disequilibrium in homeostasis because its regenerative abilities are limited. Here, we report that MLIP (muscle enriched A-type lamin-interacting protein), a unique protein of unknown function, is required for proper cardiac adaptation. Mlip−/− mice exhibited normal cardiac function despite myocardial metabolic abnormalities and cardiac-specific overactivation of Akt/mTOR pathways. Cardiac-specific MLIP overexpression led to an inhibition of Akt/mTOR, providing evidence of a direct impact of MLIP on these key signaling pathways. Mlip−/− hearts showed an impaired capacity to adapt to stress (isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy), likely because of deregulated Akt/mTOR activity. Genome-wide association studies showed a genetic association between Mlip and early response to cardiac stress, supporting the role of MLIP in cardiac adaptation. Together, these results revealed that MLIP is required for normal myocardial adaptation to stress through integrated regulation of the Akt/mTOR pathways.

https://openalex.org/W1923792073,"Sex differences in the brain appear to play an important role in the prevalence and progression of various neuropsychiatric disorders, but to date little is known about the cerebral mechanisms underlying these differences. One widely reported finding is that women demonstrate higher cerebral perfusion than men, but the underlying cause of this difference in perfusion is not known. This study investigated the putative role of steroid hormones such as oestradiol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) as underlying factors influencing cerebral perfusion. We acquired arterial spin labelling perfusion images of 36 healthy adult subjects (16 men, 20 women). Analyses on average whole brain perfusion levels included a multiple regression analysis to test for the relative impact of each hormone on the global perfusion. Additionally, voxel-based analyses were performed to investigate the sex difference in regional perfusion as well as the correlations between local perfusion and serum oestradiol, testosterone, and DHEAS concentrations. Our results replicated the known sex difference in perfusion, with women showing significantly higher global and regional perfusion. For the global perfusion, DHEAS was the only significant predictor amongst the steroid hormones, showing a strong negative correlation with cerebral perfusion. The voxel-based analyses revealed modest sex-dependent correlations between local perfusion and testosterone, in addition to a strong modulatory effect of DHEAS in cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar regions. We conclude that DHEAS in particular may play an important role as an underlying factor driving the difference in cerebral perfusion between men and women."
https://openalex.org/W1791409220,"Cigarettes are commonly sold in packs of 20 units and therefore little is known about the potential impact of pack size on consumption. Using insights from behavioral economics, we suggest that cigarette packs smaller than the standard size may help some smokers cut back and/or quit, consistent with their long-term goals. Results from an online hypothetical purchase experiment conducted in a sample of US smokers reveal that over a third of smokers are willing to pay a price premium to purchase in smaller quantities. Further, a desire to quit smoking and high self-control is associated with preference for a smaller pack. While we provide some preliminary evidence that smaller packs may be beneficial to certain types of smokers, further research should be conducted to assess whether the smaller pack size should be considered in the arsenal of tobacco control policies to help current smokers quit (JEL: I18; I12; D12)"
https://openalex.org/W2173565230,"Small arteries are known to develop functional and structural alterations in hypertension. However, the mechanisms of this remodeling are not fully understood. We hypothesized that altered gene expression is associated with the development of hypertension in mesenteric arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Three sublines of SHR and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) were studied at 6 weeks and 5 months of age. MiRNA and mRNA microarray experiments were performed and analyzed with bioinformatical tools, including Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Principal component analysis showed a clear separation in both miRNA and mRNA expression levels between both ages studied, demonstrating strong age-related changes in expression. At the miRNA level, IPA identified differences between SHR and WKY related to metabolic diseases, cellular growth, and proliferation. The mRNAs differentially expressed between SHR and WKY were related to metabolism, cellular movement and proliferation. The most strongly upregulated gene (9.2-fold) was thrombospondin 4 (Thbs4), a protein involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response that activates transcription factor 6α (ATF6α). ATF6α downstream targets were also differentially expressed in SHR vs. WKY. Differential expression of THBS4, the cleaved form of ATF6α, and two of its targets were further confirmed at the protein level by western blot. In summary, these data revealed a number of genes (n = 202) and miRNAs (n = 3) in mesenteric arteries of SHR that had not been related to hypertension previously. The most prominent of these, Thbs4, is related to vascular ER stress that is associated with hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1813134150,"Radicular pain in humans is usually caused by intraforaminal stenosis and other diseases affecting the spinal nerve, root, or dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Previous studies discovered that a chronic compression of the DRG (CCD) induced mechanical allodynia in rats and mice, with enhanced excitability of DRG neurons. We investigated whether CCD altered the pain-like behavior and also the responses of cutaneous nociceptors with unmyelinated axons (C-fibers) to a normally aversive punctate mechanical stimulus delivered to the hairy skin of the hind limb of the mouse. The incidence of a foot shaking evoked by indentation of the dorsum of foot with an aversive von Frey filament (tip diameter 200 μm, bending force 20 mN) was significantly higher in the foot ipsilateral to the CCD surgery as compared to the contralateral side on post-operative days 2 to 8. Mechanically-evoked action potentials were electrophysiologically recorded from the L3 DRG, in vivo, from cell bodies visually identified as expressing a transgenically labeled fluorescent marker (neurons expressing either the receptor MrgprA3 or MrgprD). After CCD, 26.7% of MrgprA3+ and 32.1% MrgprD+ neurons exhibited spontaneous activity (SA), while none of the unoperated control neurons had SA. MrgprA3+ and MrgprD+ neurons in the compressed DRG exhibited, in comparison with neurons from unoperated control mice, an increased response to the punctate mechanical stimuli for each force applied (6, 20, 40, and 80 mN). We conclude that CCD produced both a behavioral hyperalgesia and an enhanced response of cutaneous C-nociceptors to aversive punctate mechanical stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W1752432280,"Biodiversity experiments show that increases in plant diversity can lead to greater biomass production, and some researchers suggest that high diversity plantings should be used for bioenergy production. However, many methods used in past biodiversity experiments are impractical for bioenergy plantings. For example, biodiversity experiments often use intensive management such as hand weeding to maintain low diversity plantings and exclude unplanted species, but this would not be done for bioenergy plantings. Also, biodiversity experiments generally use high seeding densities that would be too expensive for bioenergy plantings. Here we report the effects of biodiversity on biomass production from two studies of more realistic bioenergy crop plantings in southern Michigan, USA. One study involved comparing production between switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) monocultures and species-rich prairie plantings on private farm fields that were managed similarly to bioenergy plantings. The other study was an experiment where switchgrass was planted in monoculture and in combination with increasingly species-rich native prairie mixtures. Overall, we found that bioenergy plantings with higher species richness did not produce more biomass than switchgrass monocultures. The lack of a positive relationship between planted species richness and production in our studies may be due to several factors. Non-planted species (weeds) were not removed from our studies and these non-planted species may have competed with planted species and also prevented realized species richness from equaling planted species richness. Also, we found that low seeding density of individual species limited the biomass production of these individual species. Production in future bioenergy plantings with high species richness may be increased by using a high density of inexpensive seed from switchgrass and other highly productive species, and future efforts to translate the results of biodiversity experiments to bioenergy plantings should consider the role of seeding density."
https://openalex.org/W2177836376,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as epigenetic markers and regulate the expression of their target genes, including those characterized as regulators in autoimmune diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases. The potential roles of miRNA-regulated genes in RA pathogenesis have greatly aroused the interest of clinicians and researchers in recent years. In the current study, RA-related miRNAs records were obtained from PubMed through conditional literature retrieval. After analyzing the selected records, miRNA targeted genes were predicted. We identified 14 RA-associated miRNAs, and their sub-analysis in 5 microarray or RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets was performed. The microarray and RNA-seq data of RA were also downloaded from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Sequence Read Archive (SRA), analyzed, and annotated. Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified a series of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by comparing studies on RA and the controls. The RA-related gene expression profile was thus obtained and the expression of miRNA-regulated genes was analyzed. After functional annotation analysis, we found GO molecular function (MF) terms significantly enriched in calcium ion binding (GO: 0005509). Moreover, some novel dysregulated target genes were identified in RA through integrated analysis of miRNA/mRNA expression. The result revealed that the expression of a number of genes, including ROR2, ABI3BP, SMOC2, etc., was not only affected by dysregulated miRNAs, but also altered in RA. Our findings indicate that there is a close association between negatively correlated mRNA/miRNA pairs and RA. These findings may be applied to identify genetic markers for RA diagnosis and treatment in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2233073530,"The molecular interactions between macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and the tyrosine kinase receptor c-FMS play a key role in the immune response, bone metabolism, and the development of some cancers. Because no x-ray structure is available for the human M-CSF·c-FMS complex, the binding epitope for this complex is largely unknown. Our goal was to identify the residues that are essential for binding of the human M-CSF to c-FMS. For this purpose, we used a yeast surface display (YSD) approach. We expressed a combinatorial library of monomeric M-CSF (M-CSFM) single mutants and screened this library to isolate variants with reduced affinity for c-FMS using FACS. Sequencing yielded a number of single M-CSFM variants with mutations both in the direct binding interface and distant from the binding site. In addition, we used computational modeling to map the identified mutations onto the M-CSFM structure and to classify the mutations into three groups as follows: those that significantly decrease protein stability; those that destroy favorable intermolecular interactions; and those that decrease affinity through allosteric effects. To validate the YSD and computational data, M-CSFM and three variants were produced as soluble proteins; their affinity and structure were analyzed; and very good correlations with both YSD data and computational predictions were obtained. By identifying the M-CSFM residues critical for M-CSF·c-FMS interactions, we have laid down the basis for a deeper understanding of the M-CSF·c-FMS signaling mechanism and for the development of target-specific therapeutic agents with the ability to sterically occlude the M-CSF·c-FMS binding interface.

Ligand·receptor interactions are fundamental to many processes occurring in living organisms. The evolution of these protein-protein interactions (PPIs) 3The abbreviations used are: PPIprotein-protein interactionM-CSFMmonomeric variant of M-CSFPEphycoerythrinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateRUresponse unitSPRsurface plasmon resonanceYSDyeast surface displayampampicillin. is dependent on the development of highly specific sites of interaction within the ligand·receptor complex. A comprehensive understanding of how specific PPIs evolve requires the precise identification of the binding recognition sites on the protein agonists (1Zhao Y. Muir T.W. Kent S.B. Tischer E. Scardina J.M. Chait B.T. Mapping protein-protein interactions by affinity-directed mass spectrometry.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 4020-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Ligand·receptor recognition depends mainly on the physical and chemical properties of the binding interfaces of the two protein surfaces that become buried upon complex formation. A number of studies on the properties of the binding interfaces have revealed that non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, burial of the hydrophobic area, and van der Waals interactions collectively determine the binding affinity between the proteins (2Chakrabarti P. Janin J. Dissecting protein-protein recognition sites.Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2002; 47: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 3Erijman A. Rosenthal E. Shifman J.M. How structure defines affinity in protein-protein interactions.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9e110085Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This binding affinity may be affected by mutations in one or both of the binding partners. In addition to residues lying in direct binding interfaces, mutations of more distant residues can also influence the binding strength of ligand·receptor complexes, either through allosteric effects (4Murciano-Calles J.

Identification of the residues most crucial for binding of a particular ligand·receptor complex is important not only for understanding the evolution of inter-molecular interactions but also for the design of therapeutic molecules directed at inhibiting these interactions. However, the identification of such residues is frequently a difficult task, especially when a high resolution structure of the ligand·receptor complex is not available. In the absence of a high resolution structure, such residues have to be identified experimentally (i.e. through epitope mapping). One possible technique for such identification is alanine scanning mutagenesis, in which each residue, in turn, is replaced with Ala, and the change in the free energy of binding (ΔΔGbinding) is measured (5Lefèvre F.

However, such a process is time-consuming and laborious, involving protein production and purification and binding affinity measurements for each mutant. Better alternatives lie in approaches based on various display technologies that allow for a quick exploration of all possible mutations and qualitative mapping of the contribution of each residue to the binding affinity (7Cortese R.

Wittrup K.D. Yeast surface display for protein engineering and characterization.Curr. Opin. Struct.

Yeast surface display for screening combinatorial polypeptide libraries.Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). For epitope mapping, in particular, there are two important advantages of YSD as follows: there is no need to produce and purify protein variants (11Chao G. Lau W.L. Hackel B.J. Sazinsky S.L.

Protoc. 2006; 1: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), and in contrast to phage display, the technique is suitable for eukaryotic proteins, preserving their folds and allowing glycosylation, albeit through slightly different sugar compositions compared with those of humans (15Tanner W.

Nevertheless, computational and experimental combinatorial epitope mapping approaches are not mutually exclusive, and their combination is a powerful strategy for studying PPIs. In this study, our combinatorial approach was complemented with computational modeling with the aim to analyze and explain the effects of mutations identified by experimental YSD. For the purpose of this study, we chose to investigate the important complex between the ligand, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and the tyrosine kinase receptor, c-FMS, whose epitope is not known due to the absence of the x-ray structure of the complex. The interactions between M-CSF and c-FMS play key roles in the immune response and in bone metabolism. M-CSF is the most pleiotropic macrophage growth factor, regulating macrophage survival, proliferation, differentiation, and chemotaxis (28Bartelmez S.H. Bradley T.R. Bertoncello I. Mochizuki D.Y.

In this study, we used YSD to map M-CSF positions where mutations result in a significant decrease in the affinity of M-CSF for c-FMS. With purified proteins and computational modeling, we were able to further explain the mechanism by which the identified mutations are predicted to affect the binding affinity of the complex. The gene encoding for the secreted isoform of monomeric human M-CSF (M-CSFM), which is 474 nucleotides long, was purchased from Genscript. To produce M-CSFM, a mutation was inserted at position 31 to convert cysteine to serine so as to prevent dimerization of the monomers. Homology sites to pCTCON (45Colby D.W. Kellogg B.A. Graff C.P.

The gene was amplified using a PCR with Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) with primers that fit pCTCON homology (pCTCON forward, 5′-TAAGGACAATAGCTCGACGATTGAAG-3′, and pCTCON reverse, 5′-CAGATCTCGAGCTATTACAAGTCCTCTTC-3′). Thereafter, the gene was transformed into a competent EBY100 Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain, along with a linear pCTCON plasmid, by using a MicroPulser electroporator (Bio-Rad) for the sake of homologous recombination, as described previously by Wittrup and co-workers (11Chao G. Lau W.L. Hackel B.J. Sazinsky S.L. Lippow S.M. Wittrup K.D. Isolating and engineering human antibodies using yeast surface display.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar); the resultant yeast contained the gene for the monomeric version of M-CSF, designated M-CSFM. The plasmid was extracted from the yeast using ZymoprepTM yeast plasmid miniprep I kit (Zymo Research) and was amplified again using a PCR with Phusion enzyme (primers: SGA forward 5′-CAGTAACGTTTGTCAGTAATTGCG-3′, and SGA reverse 5′-GTGTAAAGTTGGTAACGGAACG-3′). The PCR product was amplified and mutated using the GeneMorph II random mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). The conditions of the PCRs for constructing the three libraries, having different mutation frequencies, were set according to the kit protocol, using DNA polymerase, dNTP mix, and reaction buffer that were supplied with the kit. The primers for the reaction were pCTCON forward and reverse. Different amounts of template DNA (500, 750, and 1000 ng) were inserted into each 50-μl PCR, which had 30 amplification cycles with the aim to obtain different mutation rates in the libraries. The gene libraries were amplified, using another PCR (primers: pCTCON inner forward, 5′-GTTCCAGACTACGCTCTGCAGG-3′, and pCTCON reverse) using Phusion DNA polymerase, to produce ∼30 μg of DNA insert and were transformed into competent S. cerevisiae yeast strain EBY100. The transformed yeast was grown on SDCAA plates (0.54% Na2HPO4, 0.856% Na2HPO4·H2O, 18.2% sorbitol, 1.5% agar, 2% dextrose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% bacto casamino acids), with dilution plating to determine library size, and in SDCAA medium (2% dextrose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% bacto casamino acids, 1.47% sodium citrate, 0.429% citric acid monohydrate, pH 4.5) (11Chao G.

Protoc. 2006; 1: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The libraries were combined to produce a library with 6 × 104 variants. To determine whether there were enough single point mutation variants to cover all possibilities, 90 different plasmids were extracted from the bacteria using HiYield plasmid mini kit (RBC Bioscience, Taiwan) and then sequenced (sequencing laboratory of the National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel). Out of the sequenced plasmids, 29% contained a single point mutation; thus, the library contained 17,400 single point mutation variants at the DNA level, i.e. more than an order of magnitude larger than all the possibilities for single point mutations, which are three times the number of nucleotides in the gene.

Recent advances in sequencing technologies and the reducing cost of sequencing offer exclusive opportunities for exploring important molecular mechanisms underlying specific biological processes. This manuscript describes the large scale sequencing and analyses of mRNA from Acipenser baeri collected at five development time points using the Illumina Hiseq2000 platform. The sequencing reads were de novo assembled and clustered into 278167 unigenes, of which 57346 (20.62%) had 45837 known homologues proteins in Uniprot protein databases while 11509 proteins matched with at least one sequence of assembled unigenes. The remaining 79.38% of unigenes could stand for non-coding unigenes or unigenes specific to A. baeri. A number of 43062 unigenes were annotated into functional categories via Gene Ontology (GO) annotation whereas 29526 unigenes were associated with 329 pathways by mapping to KEGG database. Subsequently, 3479 differentially expressed genes were scanned within developmental stages and clustered into 50 gene expression profiles. Genes preferentially expressed at each stage were also identified. Through GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, relevant physiological variations during the early development of A. baeri could be better cognized. Accordingly, the present study gives insights into the transcriptome profile of the early development of A. baeri, and the information contained in this large scale transcriptome will provide substantial references for A. baeri developmental biology and promote its aquaculture research."

Moreover, phosphorylated FilGAP detected by Phos-tag is also mainly localized in the cytoplasm. Of the six potential phosphorylation sites in FilGAP tested, only mutation of serine 402 to alanine (S402A) resulted in decreased cell spreading on fibronectin. FilGAP phosphorylated at Ser-402 is localized to the cytoplasm but not at the cytoskeleton.

https://openalex.org/W2268512626,"Voltage-gated potassium (K+) channels are present in all living systems. Despite high structural similarities in the transmembrane domains (TMD), this K+ channel type segregates into at least two main functional categories-hyperpolarization-activated, inward-rectifying (Kin) and depolarization-activated, outward-rectifying (Kout) channels. Voltage-gated K+ channels sense the membrane voltage via a voltage-sensing domain that is connected to the conduction pathway of the channel. It has been shown that the voltage-sensing mechanism is the same in Kin and Kout channels, but its performance results in opposite pore conformations. It is not known how the different coupling of voltage-sensor and pore is implemented. Here, we studied sequence and structural data of voltage-gated K+ channels from animals and plants with emphasis on the property of opposite rectification. We identified structural hotspots that alone allow already the distinction between Kin and Kout channels. Among them is a loop between TMD S5 and the pore that is very short in animal Kout, longer in plant and animal Kin and the longest in plant Kout channels. In combination with further structural and phylogenetic analyses this finding suggests that outward-rectification evolved twice and independently in the animal and plant kingdom."

https://openalex.org/W1761825498,"Background Observational studies and small intervention studies suggest alcohol raises gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). We used Mendelian randomization to assess the causal effect of alcohol use on GGT in older Chinese people. Methods An instrumental variable (IV) analysis in 2,321 men and 2,757 women aged 50+ years from phase 3 of the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study with ALDH2 (rs671) genotyped, alcohol use and GGT available was used to assess the causal effect of alcohol use on GGT. Rs671 was used as an IV and F-statistics was used to test for weak instrument hypothesis. An F-statistic of ≥10 indicates the IV is not weak. Results In men, the F-statistic for rs671 on alcohol use was 70. Using IV analysis alcohol use increased GGT by 10.60 U/L per alcohol unit (10 gram ethanol) per day (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.58 to 14.62). The estimate was lower in observational multivariate regression: 3.48 U/L GGT per alcohol unit per day (95% CI 2.84 to 4.11) adjusted for age, education, physical activity and smoking. In women, rs671 was not associated with alcohol or GGT and the F-statistic was 7 precluding IV analysis. Conclusion In Mendelian randomization, we found confirmative evidence that alcohol use increases GGT among Southern Chinese men. Moreover, we found that the ALDH2 variant rs671 was not associated with GGT among Southern Chinese women who generally consume very low levels of alcohol. Taken together our findings strongly suggest that alcohol increases GGT, although we cannot rule out the possibility that other unknown factors may cause a different relation between alcohol and GGT in other populations."
https://openalex.org/W1843763101,"Outbreaks of the corallivorous crown-of-thorns seastar Acanthaster planci (COTS) represent one of the greatest disturbances to coral reef ecosystems in the Indo-Pacific, affecting not only coral reefs but also the coastal communities which rely on their resources. While injection approaches are increasingly used in an attempt to control COTS densities, most of them display severe drawbacks including logistical challenges, high residual environmental impacts or low cost-effectiveness. We tested a new alternative control method based upon acidic injections of cheap, 100% natural products. We investigated the lethal doses, intra- and inter-specific disease transmission and immune responses of COTS when injected with fresh lime juice (extracted from local Citrus arantifolia) and white spirit vinegar. High COTS mortality was achieved with small volumes: 10-20 ml per seastar induced death in 89%/97% of injected specimens after an average 34.3 h/29.8 h for lime juice and vinegar respectively. Highest efficiency was reached for both solutions with double shots of (2 × 10 ml) in two different areas on the body: 100% mortality occurred within 12-24 h, which is similar or faster compared with other current injection methods. Multiple immune measures suggested that death was very likely caused by pH stress from the acidic solutions rather than a bacterial infection. Contagion to either conspecifics or a variety of other reef species was not observed, even at COTS densities 15 times higher than the highest naturally reported. 10 to 20 l lime juice/vinegar could kill up to a thousand COTS at a cost of less than 0.05 USD per specimen; no permits or special handling procedures are required. We conclude that injections of lime juice and vinegar offer great advantages when compared to current best practises and constitute a cheap and natural option for all reefs affected by COTS."

This is especially true for long-distance Palearctic-Afrotropical migrants. We used spatially-explicit information on the δ2H composition of archived feathers from Green-backed/Grey-backed Camaroptera, to create a feather δ2H isoscape for sub-Saharan Africa. We sampled from 34 out of 41 sub-Saharan countries, totaling 205 sampling localities. Feather samples were obtained from museum collections (n = 224, from 1950 to 2014) for δ2H assay. Region, altitude, annual rainfall and seasonal patterns in precipitation were revealed as relevant explanatory variables for spatial patterns in feather δ2H. Predicted feather δ2H values ranged from -4.0 ‰ to -63.3 ‰, with higher values observed in the Great Rift Valley and South Africa, and lower values in central Africa. Our feather isoscape differed from that modelled previously using a precipitation δ2H isoscape and an assumed feather-to-precipitation calibration, but the relatively low model goodness fit (F10,213 = 5.98, p<0.001, R2 = 0.18) suggests that other, non-controlled variables might be driving observed geographic patterns in feather δ2H values. Additional ground-truthing studies are therefore recommended to improve the accuracy of the African feather δ2H isoscape."

The preponderance of the label was located in the fed polyp and in a transport-induced diffusion pattern surrounding the fed polyp. After 6 hours post-feeding particulates re-appeared in the gastrovascular system and their absorption increased the area over which the nutrients were distributed, albeit still in a pattern that was centered on the fed polyp. At later intervals, tracer became concentrated in some stolon tips, but not in others, despite the proximity of these stolons either to the fed polyp or to adjacent stolons receiving nutrients.

https://openalex.org/W2178524435,"Past studies have suggested that a key feature of the mechanism of heparin allosteric activation of the anticoagulant serpin, antithrombin, is the release of the reactive center loop P14 residue from a native state stabilizing interaction with the hydrophobic core. However, more recent studies have indicated that this structural change plays a secondary role in the activation mechanism. To clarify this role, we expressed and characterized 15 antithrombin P14 variants. The variants exhibited basal reactivities with factors Xa and IXa, heparin affinities and thermal stabilities that were dramatically altered from wild type, consistent with the P14 mutations perturbing native state stability and shifting an allosteric equilibrium between native and activated states. Rapid kinetic studies confirmed that limiting rate constants for heparin allosteric activation of the mutants were altered in conjunction with the observed shifts of the allosteric equilibrium. However, correlations of the P14 mutations' effects on parameters reflecting the allosteric activation state of the serpin were inconsistent with a two-state model of allosteric activation and suggested multiple activated states. Together, these findings support a minimal three-state model of allosteric activation in which the P14 mutations perturb equilibria involving distinct native, intermediate, and fully activated states wherein the P14 residue retains an interaction with the hydrophobic core in the intermediate state but is released from the core in the fully activated state, and the bulk of allosteric activation has occurred in the intermediate.

Antithrombin is a slow inhibitor of its target proteases, mainly thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa, in the absence of heparin, whereas the serpin becomes a rapid inhibitor of these proteases in the presence of the glycosaminoglycan. Heparin activates antithrombin partly through an allosteric mechanism wherein activating conformational changes induced in the serpin by a sequence-specific heparin pentasaccharide enhance the inhibition of factors Xa and IXa several hundredfold, although these changes minimally affect thrombin inhibition (5.Olson S.T.

Full-length heparin containing the pentasaccharide produces an additional activating effect through a heparin-bridging mechanism in which binding of both antithrombin and the target protease to the longer heparin chain promotes the inhibitor-protease interaction (7.Olson S.T.

X-ray structures of antithrombin in uncomplexed and heparin pentasaccharide complexed states have revealed that allosteric activation of antithrombin results in marked structural changes in the heparin-binding site and the reactive center loop (RCL) 2The abbreviations used are: RCLreactive center loopSIstoichiometry of inhibitionTNS2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene-6-sulfonateTAPS3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid. protease-binding site as well as global changes in the hydrophobic core.

Recent mutagenesis studies have shown that the exosite is accessible to RCL-bound proteases in the native structure despite RCL insertion into sheet A and contributes to the low antithrombin reactivity with these proteases in the native state (12.Izaguirre G.

However, an x-ray structure of the fluorescein-derivatized variant revealed that the fluorescein substituent did not prevent the insertion of the RCL backbone into sheet A, but it did block side chain insertion and resulted in exposure of the fluorescein moiety on the sheet A surface (16.Huntington J.A.

Activation of antithrombin as a factor IXa and Xa inhibitor involves mitigation of repression rather than positive enhancement.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 3397-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A particularly notable recent report showed that an antithrombin variant fully activated without the need for heparin nevertheless retained an intact RCL-sheet A interaction (21.Dementiev A.

In view of such findings, we were interested in clarifying the role of the RCL-sheet A interaction in the mechanism of heparin allosteric activation. We thus undertook saturation mutagenesis of the P14 residue and performed a comprehensive functional study of 15 P14 variants. Our findings support a minimal three-step model of allosteric activation in which P14 mutations perturb an allosteric equilibrium between a native and intermediate activated state that does not involve RCL expulsion from sheet A. Heparin binding induces the inhibitor to favor intermediate and fully activated states with RCL expulsion associated only with the latter state. Our findings are in keeping with the conformational changes induced in the intermediate activated state being principally responsible for enhancing antithrombin reactivity with factors Xa and IXa. Recombinant antithrombin variants with mutations in the RCL P14 residue were engineered on an N135Q background to block glycosylation at Asn-135 and avoid heterogeneous glycoforms with variable heparin affinities (22.Turk B.

Mutations were introduced in the antithrombin cDNA cloned into the pFASTBac baculovirus plasmid (Invitrogen) by PCR using specifically designed oligonucleotides and the splicing-overlapping extension method as in previous studies (8.Izaguirre G.

Human α-thrombin was purchased from United States Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH), and human factors Xa and IXa were obtained from Enzyme Research Labs (South Bend, IN). Active protease concentrations were determined from standard substrate assays that had been calibrated with active-site titrated enzymes as described (6.Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E.

A synthetic heparin pentasaccharide corresponding to the antithrombin-binding sequence in heparin was provided by Sanofi-Aventis (Toulouse, France). Full-length heparin (50-mer) containing the pentasaccharide-binding sequence was prepared by size exclusion and affinity fractionation of commercial heparin as described (23.Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Kinetic characterization of heparin-catalyzed and uncatalyzed inhibition of blood coagulation proteinases by antithrombin.Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Concentrations of heparins were obtained by stoichiometric binding titrations of plasma antithrombin with the polysaccharides monitored from the tryptophan fluorescence enhancement that reports binding as described (23.Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Kinetic characterization of heparin-catalyzed and uncatalyzed inhibition of blood coagulation proteinases by antithrombin.Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The purity of recombinant antithrombins and their ability to form SDS-stable complexes with proteases was evaluated by SDS-PAGE using 10% acrylamide gels and the Laemmli discontinuous buffer system (27.Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at 25 °C in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG 8000, and 0.1 m NaCl to achieve an ionic strength (I) of 0.15. Ionic strength was varied in some experiments by changing the NaCl concentration. Experiments with factor IXa employed a calcium buffer consisting of 100 mm Hepes, 93.5 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 7.4, I 0.15. Stoichiometries of inhibition (SI) for variant antithrombin reactions with thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa in the absence and presence of pentasaccharide and full-length heparins were measured by incubating fixed concentrations of protease (1–100 nm) with increasing molar ratios of inhibitor to protease sufficient to inhibit >70% protease activity. When present, the heparin concentration was fixed at double the highest concentration of inhibitor. After allowing enough time for completion of the reaction based on measured inhibition rate constants, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was diluted into 1 ml of 100 μm chromogenic substrate (S2238 for thrombin (Chromogenix), Spectrozyme FXa for factor Xa (American Diagnostica), and Pefachrome FIXa for factor IXa (Centerchem)) containing 0.1 mg/ml Polybrene to neutralize heparin, and the residual enzymatic activity was measured from the initial linear rate of absorbance change at 405 nm. Assays of factor IXa activity were done in the Hepes buffer used for factor IXa experiments except that the CaCl2 concentration was increased to 10 mm, and 33% ethylene glycol was added to enhance factor IXa substrate reactivity (28.Sturzebecher J. Kopetzki E. Bode W. Hopfner K.-P. Dramatic enhancement of the catalytic activity of coagulation factor IXa by alcohols.FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The decrease in residual protease activity with increasing molar ratio of antithrombin/protease was fit by linear regression analysis, and the stoichiometry was obtained from the abscissa intercept. Second order association rate constants (ka) for reactions of variant antithrombins with proteases in the absence or presence of heparin pentasaccharide or full-length heparin were measured under pseudo-first order conditions, i.e. employing inhibitor concentrations at least 5-fold greater than that required to fully inhibit protease based on measured values of inhibition stoichiometries. For most reactions performed in the absence of heparin or in the presence of heparin pentasaccharide levels that saturated antithrombin (2-fold molar excess over antithrombin) and for which ka <∼104 m−1 s−1, full reaction time courses (∼3 half-lives) of the loss of protease activity were acquired by sampling of reaction mixtures at varying incubation times and measuring residual protease activity as in determinations of inhibition stoichiometries. For reactions employing protease concentrations of <1 nm, a fluorogenic substrate (50 μm) was used to measure residual reactivity (tosyl-GPR-amido-4-methylcoumarin for thrombin (Sigma), t-butoxycarbonyl-IEGR-amido-4-methylcoumarin for factor Xa, and Pefafluor for factor IXa (Centerchem)) with hydrolysis of substrate monitored at λex 380 nm and λem 440 nm. The time-dependent losses in protease activity were fit by a single exponential function with a zero activity end point for thrombin and factor Xa reactions and nonzero end point for factor IXa reactions to account for a minor fraction of degraded protease resistant to antithrombin inhibition (6.Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Heparin and calcium ions dramatically enhance antithrombin reactivity with factor IXa by generating new interaction exosites.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The second order association rate constant was obtained by dividing the fitted pseudo-first order rate constant, kobs, by the antithrombin or antithrombin-heparin complex concentration (calculated based on measured KD values for the complex). Reactions of each variant were performed with two or more antithrombin concentrations to ensure a proportional relationship between kobs and the antithrombin or antithrombin-heparin complex concentration (23.Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Kinetic characterization of heparin-catalyzed and uncatalyzed inhibition of blood coagulation proteinases by antithrombin.Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). For faster reactions in the presence of heparin pentasaccharide or full-length heparin (ka>∼104 m−1 s−1), reactions were incubated for a fixed time, t, with increasing heparin concentrations. The loss of residual protease activity as a function of heparin concentration in this case conforms to a single exponential with kobs equal to ka × ([AT]0/(KAT, H + [AT]0)) × t, where [AT]o is the total antithrombin concentration and KAT, H is the dissociation constant for the antithrombin-heparin interaction under the conditions of measurement (8.Izaguirre G. Zhang W. Swanson R. Bedsted T. Olson S.T. Localization of an antithrombin exosite that promotes rapid inhibition of factors Xa and IXa dependent on heparin activation of the serpin.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51433-51440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The factor, [AT]0/(KAT, H + [AT]0), corrects for the fraction of added heparin that is complexed with antithrombin. Dividing by this factor and the fixed reaction time, t, then provides ka. Rate constants measured by this method employed at least two different fixed reaction times to ensure a proportional dependence of kobs on t. Some reactions were also monitored continuously, again under pseudo-first order conditions employing at least two fixed antithrombin or antithrombin-heparin complex concentrations, by including a chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate in the reaction and following the exponential decrease in the rate of substrate hydrolysis to an end point (5–10 half-lives) (23.Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Kinetic characterization of heparin-catalyzed and uncatalyzed inhibition of blood coagulation proteinases by antithrombin.Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To ensure pseudo-first order conditions, only inhibitor concentrations that restricted substrate hydrolysis following complete reaction to under 10% were employed. kobs in this case requires correction for the competitive effect of substrate on the inhibition reaction. ka is thus obtained by dividing kobs by the antithrombin or antithrombin-heparin complex concentration and multiplying by the factor (1 + [S]0/Km), where [S]o is the substrate concentration and Km is the independently measured Michaelis constant for protease hydrolysis of the substrate. Reaction of the antithrombin P14 Arg variant, which behaved exclusively as a protease substrate, with factor Xa was measured by monitoring RCL cleavage of the variant on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions, based on the loss of the C-terminal fragment of the serpin upon cleavage (14.Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G. Conformational conversion of antithrombin to a fully activated substrate of factor Xa without need for heparin.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A fixed concentration of the variant (∼700 nm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of factor Xa (0–25 nm) in the absence of heparin for 5 min followed by quenching with SDS buffer and boiling. After SDS-PAGE resolution of uncleaved and cleaved inhibitor bands, the bands were quantitated using Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD), and the disappearance of native antithrombin band intensity and the appearance of cleaved antithrombin band intensity were fit by single exponential curves as a function of the protease concentration. Dividing the fitted exponential rate constant by the fixed reaction time provided the kcat/Km for the substrate cleavage reaction based on the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation assuming a substrate concentration much less than Km. Stoichiometries of heparin pentasaccharide binding to the antithrombin variants were measured in I 0.15, pH 7.4, sodium phosphate buffer (except for the P14 Val variant that employed the same buffer lacking NaCl) by titrations of 200 nm antithrombin with up to a 5-fold molar excess of the saccharide monitored by tryptophan fluorescence changes that report binding (λex 280 nm and λem 340 nm) using an SLM 8000 spectrofluorimeter. The antithrombin concentration employed in this case was at least 100 × KD to ensure stoichiometric binding. Fluorescence changes (corrected for buffer and dilution (<5%)) were fit by the quadratic binding Equation 1, Fobs=F0+ΔFmax×([H]o+n[AT]o+KD−(([H]o+n[AT]o+KD)2−4[H]on[AT]o)1/2)2n[AT]o(Eq. 1) in which Fo is the initial fluorescence; Fobs is the observed fluorescence after each addition of titrant; ΔFmax is the maximal fluorescence change; [H]o and [AT]o are the total heparin and antithrombin concentrations, respectively, and n is the binding stoichiometry. KD was fixed at values estimated from extrapolations of binding measurements at higher ionic strengths (assuming n = 1) and n, Fo, ΔFmax fitted as parameters except for the Val variant in which KD was also fitted (23.Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D.

The affinities of heparin pentasaccharide for the antithrombin variants were quantitated by similar fluorescence titrations of 100–200 nm antithrombin with the pentasaccharide in sodium phosphate buffers of varying ionic strength ranging from 0.05 to 1.

https://openalex.org/W2219577215,"Myosin head (myosin subfragment 1, S1) consists of two major structural domains, the motor (or catalytic) domain and the regulatory domain. Functioning of the myosin head as a molecular motor is believed to involve a rotation of the regulatory domain (lever arm) relative to the motor domain during the ATPase cycle. According to predictions, this rotation can be accompanied by an interaction between the motor domain and the C-terminus of the essential light chain (ELC) associated with the regulatory domain. To check this assumption, we applied differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) combined with temperature dependences of fluorescence to study changes in thermal unfolding and the domain structure of S1, which occur upon formation of the ternary complexes S1-ADP-AlF4- and S1-ADP-BeFx that mimic S1 ATPase intermediate states S1**-ADP-Pi and S1*-ATP, respectively. To identify the thermal transitions on the DSC profiles (i.e. to assign them to the structural domains of S1), we compared the DSC data with temperature-induced changes in fluorescence of either tryptophan residues, located only in the motor domain, or recombinant ELC mutants (light chain 1 isoform), which were first fluorescently labeled at different positions in their C-terminal half and then introduced into the S1 regulatory domain. We show that formation of the ternary complexes S1-ADP-AlF4- and S1-ADP-BeFx significantly stabilizes not only the motor domain, but also the regulatory domain of the S1 molecule implying interdomain interaction via ELC. This is consistent with the previously proposed concepts and also adds some new interesting details to the molecular mechanism of the myosin ATPase cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2229917456,"The RIG-like receptors (RLRs) are related proteins that identify viral RNA in the cytoplasm and activate cellular immune responses, primarily through direct protein-protein interactions with the signal transducer, IPS1. Although it has been well established that the RLRs, RIG-I and MDA5, activate IPS1 through binding between the twin caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) on the RLR and a homologous CARD on IPS1, it is less clear which specific RLR CARD(s) are required for this interaction, and almost nothing is known about how the RLR-IPS1 interaction evolved. In contrast to what has been observed in the presence of immune-modulating K63-linked polyubiquitin, here we show that-in the absence of ubiquitin-it is the first CARD domain of human RIG-I and MDA5 (CARD1) that binds directly to IPS1 CARD, and not the second (CARD2). Although the RLRs originated in the earliest animals, both the IPS1 gene and the twin-CARD domain architecture of RIG-I and MDA5 arose much later in the deuterostome lineage, probably through a series of tandem partial-gene duplication events facilitated by tight clustering of RLRs and IPS1 in the ancestral deuterostome genome. Functional differentiation of RIG-I CARD1 and CARD2 appears to have occurred early during this proliferation of RLR and related CARDs, potentially driven by adaptive coevolution between RIG-I CARD domains and IPS1 CARD. However, functional differentiation of MDA5 CARD1 and CARD2 occurred later. These results fit a general model in which duplications of protein-protein interaction domains into novel gene contexts could facilitate the expansion of signaling networks and suggest a potentially important role for functionally-linked gene clusters in generating novel immune-signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2175685245,"Real-world complex networks are dynamic in nature and change over time. The change is usually observed in the interactions within the network over time. Complex networks exhibit community like structures. A key feature of the dynamics of complex networks is the evolution of communities over time. Several methods have been proposed to detect and track the evolution of these groups over time. However, there is no generic tool which visualizes all the aspects of group evolution in dynamic networks including birth, death, splitting, merging, expansion, shrinkage and continuation of groups. In this paper, we propose Netgram: a tool for visualizing evolution of communities in time-evolving graphs. Netgram maintains evolution of communities over 2 consecutive time-stamps in tables which are used to create a query database using the sql outer-join operation. It uses a line-based visualization technique which adheres to certain design principles and aesthetic guidelines. Netgram uses a greedy solution to order the initial community information provided by the evolutionary clustering technique such that we have fewer line cross-overs in the visualization. This makes it easier to track the progress of individual communities in time evolving graphs. Netgram is a generic toolkit which can be used with any evolutionary community detection algorithm as illustrated in our experiments. We use Netgram for visualization of topic evolution in the NIPS conference over a period of 11 years and observe the emergence and merging of several disciplines in the field of information processing systems."

In this study we investigated the relation between SRBD and C-reactive protein (CRP) as a parameter of inflammation and the influence of SRBD treatment on CRP with additional regard to changes in metabolic and cardiovascular parameters.Polysomnography (PSG) and laboratory data of patients diagnosed with SRBD over a period of 5 years were prospectively collected in a database and retrospectively analysed regarding the association of SRBD (according to apnoea-hypopnoea- index (AHI), duration of events and extent of desaturation) to CRP, blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, quality of life measured via a visual analogue scale (VAS 0-100%), and the effects of SRBD therapy on these parameters.716 patients were included in the study, 171 with mild SRBD (AHI ≥5 to <15/h), 209 with moderate SRBD (AHI 15 to <30/h), 336 with severe SRBD (AHI ≥30/h). Results according to severity of SRBD. Severe SRBD was significantly associated with elevated levels of CRP (3.7 [1.8-7.0] mg/l, vs. moderate (p = 0.001), and mild SRBD (p<0.001), and higher prevalence of hypertension as compared to moderate and mild SRBD (p<0.001, respectively). Results in highly successful treatment. If SRBD treatment was highly successful (AHI <5/h), CRP and quality of life improved significantly (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002), as did blood pressure (p<0.001 for systolic and diastolic values), although BMI increased (p<0.001). Results in partially successful treatment. If success was defined as reduction of AHI of ≥50%, CRP also decreased (p<0.001), as did blood pressure (p<0.001). Again, BMI increased (p<0.001).This is the first study to show an association of SRBD and CRP independently of BMI in a large cohort. The SRBD therapy-induced CRP decrease was not associated with BMI changes or metabolic changes but rather with the magnitude of AHI improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2156376411,"When we first met, we did not sound like natural collaborators: a biologist who had recently arrived from a pharmacy group in the United Kingdom and a materials scientist from a nanomaterials group in Germany. But we had a couple of things in common: We were both postdocs in a nanoparticle lab at CIC biomaGUNE, a biomaterials institute in the Basque Country in Spain, and we were both interested in expanding our horizons and growing beyond our disciplinary training. So, while the odds of us doing any productive work together seemed low at first, we were ultimately able to overcome the struggles and achieve a happy partnership, conducting truly interdisciplinary research.

> “But then we tried an often overlooked strategy: Share an office!” 

For our collaboration to blossom, we've had to bridge cultural, intellectual, and practical differences. In one of our projects, we have been working to quantify how well cells take up nanoparticles with different coatings. To a materials scientist, spending weeks to prepare hundreds of samples just for cells to eat them can be frustrating. Meanwhile, to a biologist, materials scientists tend to have unrealistic expectations—for example, that cells will efficiently endocytose whatever they are fed, without taking into account the fact that they are living things and thus do not always behave as we would like.

Several other mismatches between our fields cropped up. Materials scientists tend to focus on characterizing the material used in the experiment, while biologists primarily want to investigate how the material affects the cells. Planning biology experiments can be very complex; having to respect the life cycle of the cells or organisms can create challenges when collaborators are not used to working with this type of imposed schedule. Materials scientists are also generally expected to publish papers more quickly than biologists are, and biologists place more emphasis on clinical applications than materials scientists do. These differences can make it difficult to agree about when work is ready for publication.

In the beginning, our progress was slow. We quickly reached high levels of frustration, even despair, despite our initial excitement about the projects we planned to tackle. It didn't help that we were also at a delicate point in our careers: the stage when most researchers—ourselves included—start searching for tenure-track positions. Investing most of our efforts into a multidisciplinary collaboration that might not work, and would likely not be completed quickly, was a risky strategy for standing out in the crowd.

But then we tried an often overlooked strategy: Share an office! We soon discovered that we both appreciate the uniqueness of the Basque Country. Our science conversations became interlaced with Basque language tips, suggestions of which mountain to climb over a weekend, and, of course, detailed discussions of the local food and drink. We got to know each other better, and talking about science became easier. We could trade quick suggestions and advice. We could also plan our time better, coordinating experiments and maximizing resources. Our science took a new turn, and the secrets of the interface between biology and materials science seemed to be unfolding. Within a month of sharing an office, we were finally making progress in one of our projects, developing a cell culturing substrate that can release cells or tissues in response to a light source.

So there you have it. Working closely with scientists from different backgrounds and listening to their scientific views can deepen your understanding of other fields—and improve your own research. We have never enjoyed our respective fields as much as we do right now, which we have achieved by stepping out of them. We encourage scientists interested in interdisciplinary research to get to know not only the work of colleagues but also the colleagues themselves; a huge field of scientific and personal joy is out there to explore.

https://openalex.org/W2235392047,"Physicians' ability to make cost-effective decisions has been shown to be affected by their knowledge of health care costs. This study assessed whether Portuguese family physicians are aware of the costs of the most frequently prescribed diagnostic and laboratory tests.A cross-sectional study was conducted in a representative sample of Portuguese family physicians, using computer-assisted telephone interviews for data collection. A Likert scale was used to assess physician's level of agreement with four statements about health care costs. Family physicians were also asked to estimate the costs of diagnostic and laboratory tests. Each physician's cost estimate was compared with the true cost and the absolute error was calculated.One-quarter (24%; 95% confidence interval: 23%-25%) of all cost estimates were accurate to within 25% of the true cost, with 55% (95% IC: 53-56) overestimating and 21% (95% IC: 20-22) underestimating the true actual cost. The majority (76%) of family physicians thought they did not have or were uncertain as to whether they had adequate knowledge of diagnostic and laboratory test costs, and only 7% reported receiving adequate education. The majority of the family physicians (82%) said that they had adequate access to information about the diagnostic and laboratory test costs. Thirty-three percent thought that costs did not influence their decision to order tests, while 27% were uncertain.Portuguese family physicians have limited awareness of diagnostic and laboratory test costs, and our results demonstrate a need for improved education in this area. Further research should focus on identifying whether interventions in cost knowledge actually change ordering behavior, in identifying optimal methods to disseminate cost information, and on improving the cost-effectiveness of care."
https://openalex.org/W2206165588,"Conservational management practices in grasslands have been considered one of the efficient options to enhance the soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation. However, the SOC changes after the conservational management practices vary significantly under different grassland vegetation types and the environmental conditions. At present, it is not clear how the SOC accumulation changes along the soil profile if conservational management practice was adopted. In this study, we collected 663 paired observational data of SOC changes with and without conservational management practices in grasslands of China from 176 published literatures that has both the surface (0‒20 cm) and subsurface (to 40 cm depth) SOC measurements. The differences of SOC density (SOCD) between pre‒management and post‒management in the vertical soil layers were analyzed in order to establish a quantitative relationship of the SOC changes between the subsurface and the surface. The results revealed that in all grasslands, conservational management practices benefits the SOC accumulation by enhancing 0.43‒1.14 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. But the SOC increment weakened downwards along the soil profile. While the surface SOC was enhanced by 17% after conservational management, the subsurface SOC was enhanced by only 7%. The SOC accumulation was closely correlated with restoration duration, pre-management SOCD and the environmental factors and differed greatly among different grasslands and the practices adopted. The alpine and mountain grassland showed a higher annual SOC increment than the temperate grassland with the annual rate of 1.62 and 0.72 Mg C ha-1 yr-1, respectively. The SOC increment caused by the artificial plantation and the grazing exclusion conservational management was more than 2-fold that of the cropland abandonment and the extensive utilization. With the quantitative relationship of the SOC changes between soil layers, we provide a methodological option to estimate SOC changes to layers deeper than the recommendation of IPCC when only the surface layer SOC increment is available."
