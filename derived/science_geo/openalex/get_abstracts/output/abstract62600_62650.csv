https://openalex.org/W2022715289,"A virus from fish with lymphocystis disease was isolated in fish cell cultures. Eleven serial transfers were made and the pathognomonic lymphocystis cells were produced in vitro in each transfer. Fish inoculated with 6th- and 9th-passage material developed the disease, and virus was reisolated front them."

Both types are present on dendritic as well as perikaryal surface. Because of the approximately equal numbers, the hypothesis that one type is excitatory and the other inhibitory naturally arises."

https://openalex.org/W1482162478,"Abstract This report presents a study of the biosynthesis of thryoglobulin from which information was obtained regarding several aspects of the biosynthesis of glycoproteins. A bound protein was released from the thyroid particles with deoxycholate and after isolation was shown to have the carbohydrate composition, the immunochemical properties, and the electrophoretic behavior of soluble thyroglobulin. Radioisotope studies with thyroid slices with the use of 14C-labeled glucose or 14C-labeled leucine as substrate provided evidence that this particle-bound thyroglobulin-like protein is the precursor of the soluble thyroglobulin. In these incubations, the specific activities of all five monosaccharides, as well as of the leucine of the particle-bound protein were found to be considerably higher than those of the isolated soluble protein at all time intervals studied. Additional evidence for this biosynthetic role of the particles was obtained from their ability to synthesize both the carbohydrate and peptide portions of the particle-bound thyroglobulin when incubations of cell-free particle systems with 14C-labeled glucose or leucine were performed. By enzymatic degradation of the radioactive particle-bound and soluble thyroglobulins, it was possible to show that radioactivity was incorporated into both types of carbohydrate units, as well as into various peptide fractions, suggesting that true synthesis of the molecules was taking place. Incubations carried out in the presence of puromycin, both with slices and particle systems, indicated that the peptide portion of the thyroglobulin molecule is synthesized prior to the attachment of the carbohydrate and moreover supported the possibility that the synthesis of the carbohydrate portion occurs by a stepwise process. Studies on the iodine of the thyroglobulin molecule indicated that although some iodination takes place at a particulate site, a significant additional portion must take place at another location. In this report attention is called to the special precautions which have to be taken in the performance of ribonucleic acid determinations in the thyroid in order to avoid the overestimation of this nucleic acid which may result from the large amount of carbohydrate present in this tissue in the form of thyroglobulin. Mention is also made of the observation that thyroglobulin is soluble in ethanol after trichloroacetic acid or perchloric acid precipitation."
https://openalex.org/W2030140691,Renal clearances of inulin and chromium-51 ethylenediaminetetraacetate were compared in sheep. In 41 clearance periods from five animals the mean clearance ratio of the chelate to inulin was 0.95 +/- 0.03 (S.D.). Part of the difference between the two sets of results may have been due to binding of the metal chelate by plasma protein since 1.5 to 2 percent of chromium-51 ethylenediaminetetraacetate in plasma could not be removed by dialysis.
https://openalex.org/W1607451748,Abstract The binding of thyroxine by bovine and human serum albumin has been studied by measurements of the quenching of the ultraviolet fluorescence of the protein. The results obtained by this method have been compared with those of equilibrium dialysis measurements. Both approaches agree in assigning to serum albumin a single binding site of high affinity and three or more weak sites. The binding constant for the combination of albumin with a single molecule of thyroxine is 1.6 x 106 ± 25% at pH 7.4. At pH 7.4 the binding constant for triiodothyronine is about one-sixth that for thyroxine.
https://openalex.org/W1591786733,"Urografin has been shown to be suitable as a supporting medium for isopycnic density centrifugation of Bacillus megaterium spores. The complete separation of vegetative cells and spores can be achieved through the use of such gradients. Vegetative cells were found to have an average density of 1.135 g per cm3, while the average spore density was 1.305 g per cm3. Under normal sporulating conditions the spores formed consisted of a heterogeneous population with a wide spectrum of densities. These density differences could be correlated with such properties as resistance to thermal death and ability to be heat-activated. Spores formed in the absence of Ca++ are less dense than those obtained under the usual conditions. The pattern of cell distribution obtained on the Urografin gradient can serve as a gauge of the efficiency of sporulation and degree of synchrony of a sporulating culture."
https://openalex.org/W2055174962,"A statistically significant experimental model has been developed for reproducing head injury by impact in the monkey. Results with 80 monkeys subjected to occipital impact under specified conditions ( duration of phenomena, 1 to 10 milliseconds) enable the construction of curves relating the production of experimental cerebral concussion in 10, 50, and 90 percent of the monkeys to the average impulse of the blow in pounds-seconds, as well as to the average linear acceleration of the head. These curves are proposed as a baseline from which blows to various parts of the head, as well as nonimpacting impulsive loads, can be studied under various conditions of protection and according to varioucs time regimes."

https://openalex.org/W1989897362,"Machupo virus, the etiologic agent of human hemorrhagic fever in Bolivia, induced chronic asymptomatic infection in laboratory hamsters and colonized individuals of the peridomestic, wild, South American rodent, Calomys callosus. Viruria was detected for more than 500 and 150 days, respectively, in the two species. Chronic viremia was shown only for Calomys. Virus-neutralizing substances were present in parenterally infected adult animals, but not in animals born to, and in contact with, an infected female. Chronic infection in wild rodents may be an important mechanism in the natural history of Machupo and related virus infections."

https://openalex.org/W2076079582,"Calcium ion participates in maintaining electrical connections between the nerve cells of Retzius (Hirudo medicinalis). The conductance across the junction between these cells decreases with decreasing concentration of free, extracellular Ca++. At a certain level of Ca++ withdrawal from the cell system, junctional conductance reaches a critical low point at which the cells become functionally disconnected: the nerve impulses which are normally discharged in synchrony by the cells become asynchronous. These effects of Ca++ on junctional connection are irreversible, in contrast to those on nonjunctional surface membrane permeability."
https://openalex.org/W1994646382,"Calcium takes part in maintaining ion communication between salivary gland cells (Chironomus thummi). Its withdrawal from the cell systems results in virtual disconnection of ion communication, at Ca(++) concentrations which do not noticeably affect cell adhesion. The junctional membrane surfaces. which are normally quite freely permeable to ions, become as impermeable as the nonjunctional membrane surfaces; each cell seals itself off irreversibly as a unit. In maintaining ion communication Mg(++) substitutes for Ca(++)"

These changes appear to precede the transformation of the small lymphocytes into cells which synthesize RNA and eventually undergo mitosis. In both these reports1,2 it is suggested that these lysosomes are in some way involved in the initiation of cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2093120526,"In a group of 21 gelada baboons, three different lactate dehydrogenase patterns were observed after starch-gel electrophoresis of tissue extracts. The patterns indicate that a mutation has occurred in this population in the gene responsible for the A-subunit. The normal and variant homozygotes each contain five isozymes, those containing the A subunit having characteristically different electrophoretic mobilities. The heterozygote contains the expected 15 isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W1529580301,"Abstract The hydrolysis of l-tyrosine ethyl ester by Carlsberg subtilisin, subtilisin BPN', and Novo bacterial proteinase has been examined in mixtures of water with various alcohols. The presence of straight chain alcohols resulted in an apparent inhibition of acid release. It was shown that this inhibition could be accounted for by enzyme-catalyzed transesterification reactions between tyrosine ethyl ester and the various alcohols studied. The subtilisin-catalyzed transesterification reactions are very similar to those catalyzed by chymotrypsin, trypsin, and a Pseudomonas fluorescens cholinesterase."

However, cold agglutinin isolated from the serums of patients with chronic cold-agglutinin hemolytic anemia contains only type K light chains. The experimental evidence suggests that some cold agglutinins contain both types of light chains in the same molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1559631113,"Abstract Formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase was partially purified from extracts of two amethopterin-resistant mutant strains of Streptococcus faecalis, SF/A and SF/Ak. The concentrations of formate, tetrahydrofolate, adenosine triphosphate, and MgCl2 giving half-maximal reaction velocity were determined. The purified enzyme requires Mg++ for maximal activity and is specific for formate. The product of the enzymatic reaction is 10-formyltetrahydrofolate. Tetrahydropteroyltriglutamate can replace tetrahydrofolate; its Km value is 10 times larger than that of tetrahydrofolate. The pH optimum is 6.4 and is ascorbate dependent; the temperature coefficient (35–45°) is 1.9. Inorganic phosphate and ADP inhibit the reaction. Purines, which repress synthesis of the enzyme, are not strong inhibitors of formate activation. Formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase was not found in the amethopterin-sensitive strain, SF/O. The presence of serine hydroxymethyltransferase, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase suggest the preferential utilization of exogenous serine as source of active 1 carbon moieties. Why serine synthesis de novo is independent of a formate-activating enzyme in SF/O is not yet clear."

Hybridizing experiments with radioactively labeled ribosomal RNA showed that the DNA strands complementary to ribosomal RNA were distributed on the heavy side of the DNA band. By fractionating this band the DNA strands coding for ribosomal RNA may be enriched 5- to 20- fold.

https://openalex.org/W1980097938,"THE development of behaviour in a young primate is influenced by both the physical and social characteristics of its environment. Paramount among the latter is the mother1, while later other infants are important as play companions2. Previous investigations3,4 of group-living rhesus monkeys suggested that adult females, other than the infant's own mother, might also play an important part, both by themselves showing maternal, social, play, aggressive and other types of behaviour towards the infant and by influencing the nature of the mother-infant relationship. For example, one adolescent female which, with the male's support, frequently interacted with the two infants in the same group, made their mothers extremely restrictive. In consequence, the infants lived confined lives: while seven other group-living infants were recorded more than 2 ft. from their mothers in a mean of 37 per cent of our observation periods when 17–18 weeks old, these two practically never went this far from their mothers up to this age."
