https://openalex.org/W2066795918,"Plant roots are able to sense soil nutrient availability. In order to acquire heterogeneously distributed water and minerals1,2,3, they optimize their root architecture. One poorly understood plant response to soil phosphate (Pi) deficiency is a reduction in primary root growth with an increase in the number and length of lateral roots4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Here we show that physical contact of the Arabidopsis thaliana primary root tip with low-Pi medium is necessary and sufficient to arrest root growth. We further show that loss-of-function mutations in Low Phosphate Root1 (LPR1) and its close paralog LPR2 strongly reduce this inhibition. LPR1 was previously mapped as a major quantitative trait locus (QTL)12; the molecular origin of this QTL is explained by the differential allelic expression of LPR1 in the root cap. These results provide strong evidence for the involvement of the root cap in sensing nutrient deficiency, responding to it, or both. LPR1 and LPR2 encode multicopper oxidases (MCOs), highlighting the essential role of MCOs for plant development."

Here we show that while ectopically expressed PTIP is capable of interacting with DNA damage response proteins including 53BP1, endogenous PTIP, and a novel protein PA1 are both components of a Set1-like histone methyltransferase (HMT) complex that also contains ASH2L, RBBP5, WDR5, hDPY-30, NCOA6, SET domain-containing HMTs MLL3 and MLL4, and substoichiometric amount of JmjC domain-containing putative histone demethylase UTX. PTIP complex carries robust HMT activity and specifically methylates lysine 4 (K4) on histone H3. Furthermore, PA1 binds PTIP directly and requires PTIP for interaction with the rest of the complex. Moreover, we show that hDPY-30 binds ASH2L directly. The evolutionarily conserved hDPY-30, ASH2L, RBBP5, and WDR5 likely constitute a subcomplex that is shared by all human Set1-like HMT complexes. In contrast, PTIP, PA1, and UTX specifically associate with the PTIP complex. Thus, in cells without DNA damage agent treatment, the endogenous PTIP associates with a Set1-like HMT complex of unique subunit composition. As histone H3 K4 methylation associates with active genes, our study suggests a potential role of PTIP in the regulation of gene expression.

As histone H3 K4 methylation associates with active genes, our study suggests a potential role of PTIP in the regulation of gene expression. Transcriptional regulation at the chromatin level requires concerted action of multiple chromatin remodeling complexes and histone-modifying complexes. Covalent modifications of histones, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of both global and tissue- and developmental stage-specific gene expression. Histone lysine methylation is involved in both gene activation and repression, depending upon the specific lysine residue that gets methylated. For example, methylation at histone H3 lysine 27 is associated with gene repression, while di- and trimethylations at histone H3 lysine 4 (K4) are associated with gene activation (1Bernstein B.E. Humphrey E.L. Erlich R.L. Schneider R. Bouman P. Liu J.S. Kouzarides T. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8695-8700Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 2Santos-Rosa H.

PTIP (Pax transactivation domain-interacting protein) is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein and was first identified, through yeast two-hybrid assays, as a Pax2 transactivation domain-interacting protein (22Lechner M.S. Levitan I. Dressler G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2741-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PTIP carries six tandem BRCT (BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal) domains that are predominantly found in proteins involved in DNA damage response (Fig. 1A). Deletion of PTIP in mice leads to early embryonic lethality at E9.5 due to widespread cell death (23Cho E.A. Prindle M.J. Dressler G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1666-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In vitro, tandem BRCT domains in PTIP function as phosphopeptide binding modules that recognize substrates phosphorylated by DNA damage activated ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia- and RAD3-related (ATR) protein kinases. Upon ionizing radiation, ectopically expressed PTIP shows significantly increased association with DNA damage checkpoint protein 53BP1, translocates to DNA damage-induced foci, and co-localizes with phosphorylated histone H2AX, a marker for DNA double strand break (24Jowsey P.A. Doherty A.J. Rouse J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55562-55569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 302: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). However, the function of endogenous PTIP in cells without DNA damage agent treatment has remained unclear. To understand the normal cellular function of PTIP, we affinity-purified PTIP-associated proteins from nuclear extracts prepared from HeLaS cells that were grown in the absence of DNA damage agent treatment. Mass spectrometry analysis and subsequent purification demonstrated that PTIP associated with ASH2L, RBBP5, WDR5, hDPY-30, NCOA6, a novel protein PA1, SET domain-containing histone methyltransferases MLL3 and MLL4, and substoichiometric amount of JmjC domain-containing putative histone demethylase UTX in a Set1-like complex that carried robust histone H3 lysine 4 (K4) methyltransferase activity. Plasmids—Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) clones obtained from ATCC were used as templates for PCR amplification of full-length cDNAs of mouse PTIP (GenBank™ accession number BC066014), human PA1 (GenBank™ accession number BC003640), UTX (GenBank™ accession number BC093868), RBBP5 (GenBank™ accession number BC053856), and WDR5 (GenBank™ accession number BC016103). Full-length ASH2L cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from HeLaS cells using primers 5′-TAT AGG ATC CTG GTG ATG GCG GCG GCA GGA G-3′ and 5′-CAG CGA CTC GAG TCA GGG TTC CCA TGG GGG AC-3′. FLAG-tagged hDPY-30 was cloned by PCR from HeLaS cDNA using primers 5′-C AGT AGG ATC CTG GCC ACC ATG GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG ATG GAG CCA GAG CAG ATG CTG G-3′ and 5′-TCG CTG CTC GAG TCA GTT TCG ATC TTC AAA CTG TGC-3′. cDNAs for the SET domain-containing COOH-terminal fragments of MLL3 (3,993–4,911 amino acids, GenBank™ accession number NP_733751) and MLL4 (4,289–5,262 amino acids, NP_003473) were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from HeLaS cells. cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for transient expression or as templates for in vitro transcription/translation (Promega). For glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays, cDNAs were cloned into pGEX-5X1 (Amersham Biosciences). For retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into HeLaS cells, FLAG-tagged PTIP, PA1, UTX, and hDPY-30 were cloned into pWZLneo, which carries neomycin resistance gene. For retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), FLAG-tagged PA1 was also cloned into pMSCVpuro and pMSCVhygro (Clontech), which carry puromycin and hygromycin resistance genes, respectively. Cre recombinase gene was subcloned from pBabeCREpuro (gift of Thomas Blankenstein) into pMSCVpuro. All PCR products and plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Antibodies—Rabbit anti-MLL3, anti-MLL4, anti-PA1, and anti-WDR5 antibodies were generated against and affinity-purified by the following peptides: DKRPRGRPRKDGASPFQ and TDKIKKRYRKRKNKLEET (human MLL3 residues 33–49 and mouse MLL3 residues 1334–1351, respectively), FVHSKSSQYRRLRTEWKN and EGDEKKKQQRRGRKRSKL (human MLL4 residues 5105–5122 and 1472–1489, respectively), RSQKREARLDKVLSD (human PA1 residues 193–207), and MATEEKKPETEAARAQP (human WDR5 residues 1–17). Rabbit anti-PTIP antibody was generated against GST-fused mouse PTIP residues 1–316 as described (22Lechner M.S. Levitan I. Dressler G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2741-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and purified on protein A-agarose. Mouse IgG (catalog number sc-2025), anti-BAF170 (sc-10757), and anti-α-tubulin (sc-5286) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit IgG (I-5006), anti-FLAG (F3165), and anti-FLAG M2-agarose (A2220) were from Sigma. Anti-53BP1 (A300–272A), anti-Menin (A300–105A), anti-human NCOA6 (A300–410A), anti-ASH2L (A300–107A), anti-RBBP5 (A300–109A), and anti-hSet1 (A300–289A) were from Bethel Laboratories. Anti-MLL COOH-terminal (05-765) was from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-MRE11 (GTX70212) and anti-RAD50 (GTX70228) were from GeneTex. Anti-NBS1 (611870) and anti-CXXC1 (612334) were from BD Biosciences. Cell Culture and Retrovirus-mediated Gene Transfer—All cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary PTIPflox/flox MEFs were isolated from E13.5 embryos of PTIP conditional knock-out mice (26Kim D. Wang M. Cai Q. Brooks H. Dressler G.R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2007; 18: 1458-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and immortalized by transfection with pcDNA3 expressing SV40T following 3T3 protocol (27Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). Retrovirus infection of immortalized MEFs was performed as described (28Ge K. Guermah M. Yuan C.X. Ito M. Wallberg A.E. Spiegelman B.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). HeLaS cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged full-length mouse PTIP, human PA1 and hDPY-30 (F-PTIP, F-PA1, and F-hDPY-30, respectively) were established using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Briefly, Phoenix amphotropic retrovirus packaging cells were seeded at a density of 1.1 × 106 cells in 4 ml of medium per 6-cm dish. After overnight incubation, cells were transfected with 8 μg of pWZLneo-based plasmids by lipofectAmine2000 (Invitrogen). 48 h later, the cells were changed to fresh medium. Virus-containing supernatant was collected 12 h later, filtered through 0.45-mm membrane, and supplemented with 8 μg/ml polybrene and was added to HeLaS cells that were plated at a density of 3.5 × 105 cells per 6-cm dish 1 day before. Two days later, cells were serial diluted in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Fourteen days later, colonies were expanded, and those expressing FLAG-tagged PTIP were identified by Western blot with anti-FLAG antibody. Purification of PTIP HMT Complex—HeLaS cells expressing FLAG-tagged PTIP or vector only were grown to confluence on 200 × 15 cm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 8% bovine serum and 2% fetal bovine serum. To isolate PTIP-associated proteins, 300 mg of nuclear extracts prepared as described (28Ge K. Guermah M. Yuan C.X. Ito M. Wallberg A.E. Spiegelman B.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) were precleared twice with 0.6 ml of mouse IgG-agarose (Sigma) for 2 h in buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 180 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin (Roche Applied Science), followed by overnight immunoprecipitation with 0.5 ml anti-FLAG M2-agarose at 4 °C. After washing with buffer A for 12 times, bound proteins were eluted twice with 0.25 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma), concentrated with microcon column (Millipore), resolved on 4–15% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad), and analyzed by mass spectrometry. To purify PTIP HMT complex, anti-RBBP5 antibody was cross-linked to protein A-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) using disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce). PTIP-associated proteins purified as above were incubated with immobilized anti-RBBP5 at 4 °C overnight. After washing with buffer A containing 300 mm KCl five times, bound proteins were eluted twice with 100 mm triethylamine (pH 11.5) for 10 min, neutralized with 1 m Tris (pH 7.5), concentrated with microcon column, and resolved on 4–15% SDS-PAGE. For one-step purification of PTIP HMT complex, nuclear extracts prepared from HeLaS cells expression FLAG-tagged PA1 were precleared twice with mouse IgG-agarose in buffer A, followed by overnight immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2-agarose at 4 °C. After extensive washing with buffer A, bound proteins were eluted twice with 0.25 mg/ml FLAG peptide. Mass Spectrometric Protein Identification—For mass spectrometric protein identification, excised gel bands were placed in V-shaped 96-well microtiter plate (Greiner) with needle-punctured bottoms and robotically processed on a Proteam 100 Genesis liquid handling system (Tecan). The robotic procedure encompassed gel destaining in 50% acetonitrile, 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, protein reduction in 10 mm Tris (carboxyethylphosphine) (Pierce), 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, alkylation with iodoacetamide, and digestion with bovine trypsin (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 8 h. The gel-released peptides were captured on Poros 20 R 2 beads (Applied Biosystems), transferred into ZipTips (Millipore), serving as frits, and eluted onto stainless steel sample plates using 60% acetonitrile, 20% methanol, in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and co-crystallized with the MALDI matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid. Single-stage mass spectrometric analyses were performed on a Protof2000 MALDI-quadrupole time-of-flight instrument (PerkinElmer/Sciex) and multistage mass spectrometric fragmentation spectra were obtained on a self-built MALDI-quadrupole ion trap as described previously (29Kalkum M. Lyon G.J. Chait B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Spectra were analyzed by data base searching using Xproteo, Profound, and TheGPM X! Tandem. Co-immunoprecipitation, Western Blot, and GST Pull-down Assay—For co-immunoprecipitation, 1–5 mg of HeLaS nuclear extracts were incubated with 2–5 μg of antibodies. The precipitates were washed five times with buffer A. Western blot and GST pull down of in vitro translated proteins were done essentially as described (28Ge K. Guermah M. Yuan C.X. Ito M. Wallberg A.E. Spiegelman B.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). HMT Assay and Edman Degradation—HMT assay and Edman degradation to map methylation site on histone H3 were done as described (8Hughes C.M. Rozenblatt-Rosen O. Milne T.A. Copeland T.D. Levine S.S. Lee J.C. Hayes D.N. Shanmugam K.S. Bhattacharjee A. Biondi C.A. Kay G.F. Hayward N.K. Hess J.L. Meyerson M. Mol.

Affinity Purification of PTIP-associated Proteins—To understand the normal cellular function of PTIP, we sought to isolate PTIP-associated proteins from cells cultured in the absence of DNA damage agent treatment. For this purpose, a HeLaS cell line stably expressing FLAG-tagged full-length mouse PTIP (F-PTIP) was established using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Nuclear extracts were prepared and were incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide and resolved on 4–15% SDS-PAGE followed by mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. 1B and supplemental Table S1). Consistent with previous reports of interaction between PTIP and 53BP1 (25Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B.

A 159-kDa band was identified as BLM (Bloom Syndrome protein), a RecQ family DNA helicase that has been shown to associate with 53BP1 in response to DNA damage (30Sengupta S. Robles A.I. Linke S.P. Sinogeeva N.I. Zhang R. Pedeux R. Ward I.M. Celeste A. Nussenzweig A. Chen J. Halazonetis T.D. Harris C.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, two bands were identified as MRE11 and RAD50, components of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex that plays key role in DNA damage detection and repair (31van den Bosch M. Bree R.T.

In addition, a 42-kDa band was identified to be a novel protein, which we named as PA1 (PTIP-associated 1). Polyclonal antibodies were raised against PA1, WDR5, MLL3, and MLL4. Western blot using available antibodies confirmed mass spectrometry results (Fig. 1C, top panel). Taken together, our affinity purification led to the identification of two functionally distinct groups of proteins that associated with ectopically expressed PTIP in cell nuclei: those involved in DNA damage response and repair (53BP1, BLM, MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1) and those involved in regulation of gene expression through chromatin methylation on histone H3 K4 (ASH2L, RBBP5, WDR5, hDPY-30, NCOA6, MLL3, and MLL4). PTIP Associates with ASH2L, RBBP5, WDR5, hDPY-30, NCOA6, MLL3, MLL4, and PA1 in One Complex—PTIP-associated proteins isolated as above were adjusted to contain 300 mm KCl and fractionated on Superose 6 gel filtration column followed by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A bottom panel, a portion of PTIP co-eluted in high molecular mass fractions with both groups of PTIP-associated proteins, peaking at fractions with ∼1.8 MDa. Consistent with the presence of ASH2L and RBBP5, these PTIP-containing high molecular weight fractions were associated with robust HMT activity on unmodified histone H3 peptide (Fig. 2A, top panel). These data suggest PTIP and associated proteins may form high molecular weight protein complex(es) with HMT activity. To determine whether the two functionally distinct groups of PTIP-associated proteins co-existed in one complex, PTIP-associated proteins were subjected to immuno-depletion with either anti-53BP1 or anti-RBBP5 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2B, anti-RBBP5 antibody almost completely depleted RBBP5, ASH2L, MLL3, and NCOA6, while it had minimal effect on 53BP1 level. Conversely, anti-53BP1 antibody depleted 53BP1 without affecting the levels of RBBP5, ASH2L, MLL3, and NCOA6, suggesting that the two functionally distinct groups of PTIP-associated proteins did not co-exist in the same complex. Neither anti-53BP1 nor anti-RBBP5 antibodies could significantly deplete the overexpressed PTIP as the majority of which existed as monomer or oligomer as revealed by gel filtration (Fig. 2A). While it remains to be determined how the DNA damage response and repair proteins associate with PTIP, data from gel filtration and immuno-depletion experiments strongly suggest that PTIP associates with RBBP5, ASH2L, MLL3, and NCOA6 in one high molecular weight complex. To purify the PTIP complex associated with HMT activity, PTIP-associated proteins isolated through F-PTIP as described in Fig. 1B were incubated with immobilized anti-RBBP5 antibody. After extensive washing with buffer A containing 300 mm KCl, bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm Triethylamine (pH 11.5) and resolved on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C). Silver staining revealed several prominent bands that migrated at a similar molecular mass as that of MLL4 (∼520–540 kDa), MLL3 (∼520–540 kDa), NCOA6 (250 kDa), PTIP (120 kDa), ASH2L (77 kDa), RBBP5 (67 kDa), PA1 (42 kDa), WDR5 (35 kDa), and hDPY-30 (15 kDa) shown in Fig. 1B. The identities of proteins in each prominent band were confirmed by mass spectrometry and/or Western blotting (data not shown). Consistent with immuno-depletion results (Fig. 2B), no detectable amount of 53BP1 (∼300 kDa) was precipitated by anti-RBBP5 antibody. Thus, PTIP associates with ASH2L, RBBP5, WDR5, hDPY-30, NCOA6, MLL3, MLL4, and PA1 in one complex. One-step Purification of PTIP Complex through FLAG-tagged PA1—Human PA1 (GenBank™ accession number EF195235) contains 254 amino acids and has no recognizable conserved domains (Fig. 3A). Mouse PA1 protein (GenBank™ accession number AAH03932) contains 253 amino acids and shares 87% identity at the amino acid level with its human ortholog. The theoretical molecular mass of PA1 protein is 28 kDa. Probably due to its relatively low pI (isoelectric point) at 4.4, PA1 protein runs at around 42 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Figs. 1B, 2C, and 3C). When ectopically expressed in HeLa cells, PA1 was localized in the nucleus (data not shown). In GST pull-down assay, GST-fused PA1 interacted directly with in vitro translated PTIP but not with ASH2L, RBBP5, WDR5, and NCOA6 (Fig. 3B). The direct interaction between PA1 and PTIP prompted us to test whether the PTIP complex could also be purified through PA1. For this purpose, a HeLaS cell line stably expressing FLAG-tagged PA1 (F-PA1) was established using retroviral gene transfer method. Nuclear extracts were prepared and su"

Whether the improved cardiac function results from regeneration of cardiac myocytes, modulation of remodeling, or preservation of injured tissue through paracrine mechanisms is actively debated. Because no specific stem cell population has been shown to be optimal, we investigated whether the benefit of stem cell transplantation could be attributed to a trophic effect on injured myocardium. Mesenchymal stem cells secrete SDF-1 and the interaction of SDF-1 with its receptor, CXCR4, increases survival of progenitor cells. Therefore, we compared the effects of MSC and MSC engineered to overexpress SDF-1 on cardiac function after AMI. Tail vein infusion of syngeneic MSC and MSC:SDF-1 1 day after AMI in the Lewis rat led to improved cardiac function by echocardiography by 70.7% and 238.8%, respectively, compared with saline controls 5 wk later. The beneficial effects of MSC and MSC:SDF-1 transplantation were mediated primarily through preservation, not regeneration of cardiac myocytes within the infarct zone. The direct effect of SDF-1 on cardiac myocytes was due to the observation that, between 24 and 48 h after AMI, SDF-1-expressing MSC increased cardiac myocyte survival, vascular density (18.2+/-4.0 vs. 7.6+/-2.3 vessels/mm2, P<0.01; SDF-1:MSC vs. MSC), and cardiac myosin-positive area (MSC: 49.5%; mSC:SDF-1: 162.1%) within the infarct zone. There was no evidence of cardiac regeneration by the infused MSC or endogenous cardiac stem cells based on lack of evidence for cardiac myocytes being derived from replicating cells. These results indicate that stem cell transplantation may have significant beneficial effects on injured organ function independent of tissue regeneration and identify SDF-1:CXCR4 binding as a novel target for myocardial preservation."

https://openalex.org/W2170585417,"There are many causes for variation in the responses of the motor apparatus to neural commands. Fast-timescale disturbances occur when muscles fatigue. Slow-timescale disturbances occur when muscles are damaged or when limb dynamics change as a result of development. To maintain performance, motor commands need to adapt. Computing the best adaptation in response to any performance error results in a credit assignment problem: which timescale is responsible for this disturbance? Here we show that a Bayesian solution to this problem accounts for numerous behaviors of animals during both short- and long-term training. Our analysis focused on characteristics of the oculomotor system during learning, including the effects of time passage. However, we suggest that learning and memory in other paradigms, such as reach adaptation, adaptation of visual neurons and retrieval of declarative memories, largely follow similar rules."

https://openalex.org/W2096883497,"The molecular organization of presynaptic active zones is important for the neurotransmitter release that is triggered by depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx. Here, we demonstrate a previously unknown interaction between two components of the presynaptic active zone, RIM1 and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs), that controls neurotransmitter release in mammalian neurons. RIM1 associated with VDCC β-subunits via its C terminus to markedly suppress voltage-dependent inactivation among different neuronal VDCCs. Consistently, in pheochromocytoma neuroendocrine PC12 cells, acetylcholine release was significantly potentiated by the full-length and C-terminal RIM1 constructs, but membrane docking of vesicles was enhanced only by the full-length RIM1. The β construct beta-AID dominant negative, which disrupts the RIM1-β association, accelerated the inactivation of native VDCC currents, suppressed vesicle docking and acetylcholine release in PC12 cells, and inhibited glutamate release in cultured cerebellar neurons. Thus, RIM1 association with β in the presynaptic active zone supports release via two distinct mechanisms: sustaining Ca2+ influx through inhibition of channel inactivation, and anchoring neurotransmitter-containing vesicles in the vicinity of VDCCs."

https://openalex.org/W2121204231,"Migration of neutrophils (PMN) across epithelia is a pathological hallmark of numerous mucosal diseases. Whereas lesions at mucosal surfaces are generally self-limiting, endogenous mechanisms of resolution are incompletely understood. Previous studies revealed that resolvins directly act on PMN to attenuate transendothelial migration, less is known about the influence of resolvins on PMN-epithelial interactions and whether they act on epithelia. We studied the dynamics of resolvin E1 (RvE1) actions on leukocyte transepithelial migration. PMN exposure to RvE1 or chemerin (peptide agonist of ChemR23) reduced transepithelial migration in a concentration-dependent manner. Conversely, activation of epithelial ChemR23 promoted apical clearance of PMN. A nonbiased screen of known PMN ligands expressed on epithelial cells in response to RvE1 revealed selective induction of CD55, an apically expressed antiadhesive molecule. CD55 promoter analysis demonstrated that both RvE1 and chemerin activate the CD55 promoter. Inhibition of CD55 by neutralizing antibody prevented RvE1-dependent augmentation of apical PMN clearance. Taken together these findings implicate a two-hit model of inflammatory resolution, whereby activation of the PMN RvE1 receptor attenuates transepithelial migration and subsequent actions on the epithelium promote CD55-dependent clearance of PMN across the epithelial cell surface promoting active inflammatory resolution."

Furthermore, activation of PPARδ has been proposed to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce glucose levels in animal models of type 2 diabetes. We recently demonstrated that the PPARδ agonist GW501516 activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and stimulates glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be clearly identified. In this study, we first confirmed that incubation of primary cultured human muscle cells with GW501516 induced AMPK phosphorylation and increased fatty acid transport and oxidation and glucose uptake. Using small interfering RNA, we have demonstrated that PPARδ expression is required for the effect of GW501516 on the intracellular accumulation of fatty acids. Furthermore, we have shown that the subsequent increase in fatty acid oxidation induced by GW501516 is dependent on both PPARδ and AMPK. Concomitant with these metabolic changes, we provide evidence that GW501516 increases the expression of key genes involved in lipid metabolism (FABP3, CPT1, and PDK4) by a PPARδ-dependent mechanism. Finally, we have also demonstrated that the GW501516-mediated increase in glucose uptake requires AMPK but not PPARδ. In conclusion, the PPARδ agonist GW501516 promotes changes in lipid/glucose metabolism and gene expression in human skeletal muscle cells by PPARδ- and AMPK-dependent and -independent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2015236261,"We previously reported that up to 50% of messenger RNAs (mRNA) are oxidatively damaged in the affected area of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. The role of RNA oxidation in the cell death process is unknown. In the present study, we used cortical primary dissociated cultures to investigate the relationship between RNA oxidation and neuron degeneration induced by various insults, including hydrogen peroxide, glutamate, and amyloid beta peptide. These insults mediate the production of reactive oxygen species and thus induce oxidative stress. The results showed that RNA oxidation was an early event far preceding cell death, not merely a consequence of dying cells. RNA oxidation occurred primarily in a distinct group of neurons that died later. Identification of oxidized RNA species revealed that significant amounts of mRNAs were oxidized and that some mRNA species were more susceptible to oxidative damage, consistent with findings in the AD brain. The level of protein corresponding to the oxidized mRNA species was significantly decreased. Polyribosome analysis indicated that oxidized bases in mRNAs caused ribosome stalling on the transcripts, which led to a decrease of protein expression. These results suggest that RNA oxidation may be directly associated with neuronal deterioration, rather than harmless epiphenomena, during the process of neurodegeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2002886872,"Prions are proteins that can switch to self-perpetuating, infectious conformations. The abilities of prions to replicate, form structurally distinct strains, and establish and overcome transmission barriers between species are poorly understood. We exploit surface-bound peptides to overcome complexities of investigating such problems in solution. For the yeast prion Sup35, we find that the switch to the prion state is controlled with exquisite specificity by small elements of primary sequence. Strikingly, these same sequence elements govern the formation of distinct self-perpetuating conformations (prion strains) and determine species-specific seeding activities. A Sup35 chimaera that traverses the transmission barrier between two yeast species possesses the critical sequence elements from both. Using this chimaera, we show that the influence of environment and mutations on the formation of species-specific strains is driven by selective recognition of either sequence element. Thus, critical aspects of prion conversion are enciphered by subtle differences between small, highly specific recognition elements. The conformational changes of prion proteins are not only responsible for neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, but also serve as an ancient, but only recently discovered, protein-based mechanism of inheritance. Interactions between these proteins and the resulting conformation changes that create prions are very difficult to study by conventional biophysical methods. As an alternative, Peter Tessier and Susan Lindquist used arrays of over a hundred surface-bound prion peptides — all based on the sequence of yeast's Sup35 prion protein — to map the sequence elements responsible for recognition between prion monomers. The results map the main recognition site to a short stretch of amino acids between residues 9 and 39 for the prion protein of S. cerevisiae, and to recognition regions for the protein from C. albicans. These recognition elements alone are sufficient to drive the conversion of full-length proteins in the non-prion conformation into self-templating amyloid conformations. These same sequence elements also dictate the formation of different prion strains and determine transmission barriers between species. A Sup35 chimaera that traverses the transmission barrier between two yeast species possesses the critical sequence elements from both. This chimaera is used to show that the influence of environment and mutations on the formation of species-specific strains is driven by selective recognition of either sequence element.

https://openalex.org/W2039926575,"β-Arrestins are pleiotropic molecules that mediate signal desensitization, G-protein-independent signaling, scaffolding of signaling molecules, and chemotaxis. Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), a Gαq/11-coupled receptor, which has been proposed as a therapeutic target for inflammation and cancer, requires the scaffolding function of β-arrestins for chemotaxis. We hypothesized that PAR-2 can trigger specific responses by differential activation of two pathways, one through classic Gαq/Ca2+ signaling and one through β-arrestins, and we proposed that the latter involves scaffolding of proteins involved in cell migration and actin assembly. Here we demonstrate the following. (a) PAR-2 promotes β-arrestin-dependent dephosphorylation and activation of the actin filament-severing protein (cofilin) independently of Gαq/Ca2+ signaling. (b) PAR-2-evoked cofilin dephosphorylation requires both the activity of a recently identified cofilin-specific phosphatase (chronophin) and inhibition of LIM kinase (LIMK) activity. (c) β-Arrestins can interact with cofilin, LIMK, and chronophin and colocalize with them in membrane protrusions, suggesting that β-arrestins may spatially regulate their activities.

It is activated by proteolytic cleavage of its N terminus, which unveils a tethered ligand (SLIGRL/SLIGKV, human/mouse) leading to Gαq coupling, hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ (25Macfarlane S.R.

Most PAR-2 actions are thought to lie downstream of Ca2+ mobilization, although for some events, β-arrestin-dependent signaling can oppose the Gαq/Ca2+ pathway (27Wang P. DeFea K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9374-9385Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To date, the molecular mechanisms by which PAR-2 mediates processes such as cytoskeletal reorganization and chemotaxis have not been elucidated. Because cell migration requires the cell to extend pseudopodia at the leading edge while inhibiting extensions and dissolving stress fibers at the trailing edge (28Cramer L.P. Mitchison T.J.

We focused on the actin filament-severing protein cofilin, the activity of which allows for rapid changes in cytoskeletal architecture, creation of new barbed ends for elongation, and recycling of ATP monomers (28Cramer L.P.

In the studies described here, we investigated the following: 1) whether PAR-2 promotes cofilin dephosphorylation and activation through a β-arrestin-dependent mechanism, 2) whether β-arrestins can scaffold and direct subcellular localization of cofilin, 3) whether β-arrestin-dependent cofilin activation is independent of classic Gαq signaling, and 4) whether upstream cofilin regulators CIN and LIMK are regulated by β-arrestins in response to PAR-2 activation. All chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Antibodies and final dilutions for Western blot (WB), immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunofluorescence (IF) were as follows: from Chemicon, rabbit anti-phospho (Ser3)-cofilin (1:100 for IF) and mouse anti-cofilin (4 μg/ml for IP); from BD Pharmingen, mouse monoclonal antibodies to cofilin (1:1000 for WB and 1:250 for IF) and β-arrestin-1 (1:1000 for WB); from Dr. Robert J.

Rabbit polyclonal antibody to CIN has been described previously (36Gohla A. Birkenfeld J. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Activating peptides AP (SLIGRL-NH2 for mouse tethered ligand) and 2fAP (2-furoyl-LIGRL-ornithine-NH2) were synthesized by Genemed Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Fura-2/AM was from Molecular Probes. Muscle pyrene-actin was from Cytoskeleton Inc. Recombinant activated LIMK (amino acids 285-639) and recombinant GST-cofilin were from Upstate. Pharmacological inhibitors were used as follows: Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (Sigma) was prepared in N,N-dimethylformamide and used at 30 μm final concentration, PLC inhibitor U72133 (Tocris) was solubilized in chloroform and reconstituted to 100 mm in Me2SO immediately before use at 1 μm final concentration, and GP antagonist 2A (GP2A) was solubilized at 10 mm in Me2SO and used at a final concentration of 10 μm. Cells were permeabilized in Me2SO before addition of U72133 and GP2A.

MDA-MB-468 cells were purchased from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum. FLAG- and GFP-tagged β-arrestin-1 and -2 were a gift from Dr. Robert Lefkowitz (Duke University Medical Center) and have been described previously (39Dery O. Thoma M.S. Wong H. Grady E.F.

Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed on 70-80% confluent cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and experiments were performed between 24 and 48 h of transfection. 5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish (grown for 24 h) were serum-starved for 2 h, treated with 100 nm 2fAP for 0-90 min at 37 °C, lysed in 0.25 ml of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm NaF, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and benzamidine). 25 μg of cleared lysate protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% for cofilin, 10% for LIMK, and 12.5% for β-arrestin) followed by Western blotting. Blots were imaged using the LICOR Odyssey imaging system, and LICOR software was used to calculate integrated intensities of bands. Images of Western blots were assembled using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 and imported into Canvas. Some gels were spliced to eliminate blank lanes or lanes containing samples unrelated to the figure. Two sets of oligos were used to knock down β-arrestins. The first set were chemically synthesized double-stranded siRNAs (β-arrestin-1, 5′-AAAGCCUUCUGCGCGGAGAAU-3′; β-arrestin-2, 5′-AAGGACCGCAAAGUGUUUGUG-3′; β-arrestin-1 and -2, 5′-ACCUGCGCCUUCCGCUAUG-3′; control (non-targeting sequence), 5′-AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′) with 19-nucleotide duplex RNA and 2-nucleotide 3′ dT overhangs purchased from City of Hope Beckman Research Center (Duarte, CA) and Sigma Genosys in deprotected and desalted form.

A second set of siRNA oligos for each β-arrestin-1 and -2 and siRNA to human Gαq were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and those sequences are proprietary. Each knockdown experiment described herein was confirmed by quantitative Western blot analysis (LICOR Odyssey infrared imaging system) using an internal loading control (ERK1/2, tubulin, or actin). Specificity of β-arrestin siRNA was further confirmed using antibodies that recognize both β-arrestin-1 and -2 (A1CT and A2CT), simultaneously demonstrating knockdown of one β-arrestin while levels of the other are unaffected. Cells (40-50% confluent) were transfected with 20 nmol of siRNA/10-cm dish or 100 pmol of siRNA/30-mm well using Genesilencer (Gene Therapy Systems), Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), or N-ter (Sigma) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Assays were performed 48 h after siRNA transfection. Cofilin/β-Arrestin Interactions—Cleared lysates from confluent 15-cm dishes of untransfected MDA-MB-468 cells (lysis buffer: phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease/phosphatase inhibitors) were incubated with 5 μg of rabbit anti-cofilin (Chemicon) prebound to Protein A-agarose for 4 h, analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE, and blotted with mouse β-arrestin antibody. Alternatively MDA-MB-468 cells were co-transfected with GFP-tagged β-arrestin-1 or -2 and FLAG-cofilin. Cofilin was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-FLAG or anti-GFP. CIN/β-Arrestin Interactions—MDA-MB-468 cells, transfected with both FLAG-β-arrestin and Myc-CIN, Myc-CIN or FLAG-β-arrestin alone, or a vector control were treated with 2fAP for 0-90 min and lysed (lysis buffer: 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease inhibitors). Cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to FLAG or Myc (A14) for 2 h followed by 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-β-arrestin-1, anti-Myc (9E10), or anti-CIN. LIMK/β-Arrestin Interactions—FLAG-β-arrestin-1 and -2 were overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose. Washed beads from transfected or untransfected cells were mixed with recombinant His-tagged LIMK (amino acids 285-639) for 1 h at room temperature, pelleted, washed, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG and anti-His6. Alternatively GST-β-arrestin-1, GST-β-arrestin-2, or GST alone were expressed Escherichia coli (strain BL21DE3), protein expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h, and GST-tagged proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose to >85% purity. Some breakdown of both GST-β-arrestin proteins was observed, accounting for the appearance of 29- and 42-45-kDa bands visible by Coomassie. 5 μg each of each GST fusion protein was incubated with 1 or 5 μg of His-tagged LIMK (amino acids 285-639) for 1 h, LIMK-bound proteins were pulled down with cobalt resin, and both bound and unbound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie. Actin polymerization assays were performed using an Actin Polymerization Biochem kit (Cytoskeleton Inc.). It has been demonstrated by others that addition of depolymerizing factors such as cytochalasin or actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin to pyrene-actin filaments at steady state will cause a decrease in fluorescence reflective of depolymerization/severing activity (44Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 45Cooper J.A. Carraway K.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15538-15546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Although cell extracts will likely contain a myriad of other factors that can affect the actin assembly kinetics, when they are added to filaments that have reached steady state, a decrease in fluorescence reflects the presence of a depolymerizing activity. Cell lysates were prepared from MDA-MB-468 cells and MEFs in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 100 mm KCl, 9mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors). Pyrene-G-actin (10% labeled) was incubated in polymerization buffer (containing 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm ATP) for 2 h at room temperature, the resulting pyrene-F-actin was diluted to 2 μm (final concentration) in Buffer G (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), and fluorescence was monitored for 3000 s. Cell extracts (40 μg of protein/10 μl of lysis buffer) or 10 μl of lysis buffer alone were added after 1000 s. Severing was monitored by measuring the decrease in fluorescence at 386 nm on a Spex Fluoromax-2 fluorometer. Cofilin has been shown to generate free barbed ends available for elongation (31DesMarais V. Ghosh M. Eddy R. Condeelis J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar); thus if the fluorescence decrease observed upon addition of PAR-2-stimulated extracts was due to filament severing activity, addition of G-actin should result in increased polymerization. To confirm that a decrease in fluorescence was accompanied by an increase in free barbed ends, at t = 2200 s, pyrene-G-actin (2 μm) was added back to reactions. This also rules out the possibility that the decrease in pyrene fluorescence was due to quenching. Data were collected using Data Max software 2.2 and analyzed using Kaleidagraph Version 4.0. Cleared cell lysates (LIMK lysis buffer: Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and protease inhibitors) were incubated with anti-LIMK for 8 h at 4 °C. Phosphatase inhibitors were added (1 mm NaF and NaVO4) to cleared lysates just before addition of antibody. Washed beads were incubated in LIMK lysis buffer supplemented with 5 μm cold ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 2 μg of recombinant GST-cofilin at 30 °C for 45 min. Reactions were terminated by transfer of the reaction mixture to 2× Laemmli sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining, and autoradiography. GST-cofilin bands were excised, and incorporated radiolabel was determined by scintillation counting. Immobilized GST-cofilin was phosphorylated with constitutively active His6-LIMK (100 ng of LIMK and 500 ng of GST-cofilin) in LIMK reaction buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 250 μm NaVO4, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.015% Brij 35, 250 μm cold ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 30 min at 30 °C. GST-cofilin was pelleted, washed, incubated with either lysis buffer alone or lysates from MDA-MB-468 cells treated with 100 nm 2fAP for 0-45 min, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Bands were excised and counted in a Beckman scintillation counter. Cells were incubated in physiological salt solution (PSS: 137 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 0.56 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm Hepes, 2.0 mm l-glutamine, and 5.5 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 5 μm Fura-2/AM for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and mounted in a microincubator containing 1 ml of PSS-bovine serum albumin at 37 °C on the stage of a Nikon inverted microscope (40× objective). Agonists were directly added to the bath. The Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, was added at the end of all experiments to determine maximum [Ca2+]. Fluorescence was detected in individual cells using a Nikon charge-coupled device camera and a video microscopy acquisition program (Metafluor). Fluorescence was measured at 340 and 380 nm excitation and 510 nm emission. The ratio of the fluorescence at the two excitation wavelengths, which is proportional to the [Ca2+]i, was determined, and intracellular [Ca2+] was calculated using the Grynkiewicz equation (48Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Average [Ca2+]i values for a range of 10-12 cells were calculated and presented as a single trace. Cells were seeded onto collagen-coated coverslips and allowed to attach overnight. After agonist treatment, cells were fixed in normal buffered formalin and prepared as described previously (9Ge L. Ly Y. Hollenberg M. DeFea K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34418-34426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Serial sections (1 μm; 100× and 63× objectives) were taken on a Zeiss LSM510 at 1× and 4× zoom. Overlays of four individual Z-sections and enlarged images were obtained using Adobe Photoshop 5.0. All graphs and statistical analyses were performed using Kaleidagraph Version 4.0 or Microsoft Excel 2003. All experiments were performed a minimum of three times. Phosphoprotein levels were normalized to total protein levels before calculating -fold change with respect to untreated controls. For LIMK assays, cpm values were normalized to total LIMK immunoprecipitated and total GST-cofilin levels before calculating -fold change with respect to controls. Analysis of variance and Tukey t tests were used to determine statistical significance of and significant differences between values under different conditions. PAR-2 Promotes Cofilin Dephosphorylation and Filament Severing Activity—Cofilin can be activated by dephosphorylation on Ser3; thus, we investigated whether cofilin phosphorylation was altered in response to the PAR-2 activation using the specific PAR-2 activating peptide 2fAP (49Al Ani B.

In the human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-468), we observed a robust decrease in phosphorylation as early as 30 s after PAR-2 activation (Fig. 1, A-C). This effect was dose-dependent (Fig. 1B) and was observed in another breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 (not shown). Max"

The MUC1 C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C) is devoid of a classical nuclear localization signal and is targeted to the nucleus by an unknown mechanism. The present results demonstrate that MUC1-C associates with importin β and not importin α. The results also show that, like importin β, MUC1-C binds to Nup62 (nucleoporin p62). MUC1-C binds directly to the Nup62 central domain and indirectly to the Nup62 C-terminal α-helical coiled-coil domain. We demonstrate that MUC1-C forms oligomers and that oligomerization is necessary for binding to Nup62. The MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain contains a CQC motif that when mutated to AQA abrogates oligomerization and binding to Nup62. Stable expression of MUC1 with the CQC → AQA mutations was associated with targeting to the cell membrane and cytosol and attenuation of nuclear localization. The results further show that expression of MUC1(CQC-AQA) attenuates MUC1-induced (i) transcriptional coactivation, (ii) anchorage-independent growth, and (iii) tumorigenicity.

The tandem repeats are extensively modified by O-linked glycans that contribute to a structure that extends beyond the glycocalyx of the cell. MUC1-N is tethered to the cell membrane as a heterodimer with the MUC1 C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C), which includes a 58-amino acid extracellular domain, a 28-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 72-amino acid cytoplasmic tail (7Merlo G.

Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2834-2839PubMed Google Scholar), leaving MUC1-C to function as a transducer of environmental stress signals to the interior of the cell. In this regard, MUC1-C forms cell surface complexes with members of the ErbB receptor family, and MUC1-C is targeted to the nucleus in the response to heregulin stimulation (20Li Y. Ren J. Yu W.-H.

Proteins containing a classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) are imported into the nucleus by first binding to importin α and then, in turn, importin β (27Weis K. Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 28Stewart M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The cargo-importin α/β complex docks to the nuclear pore by binding to nucleoporins and is transported through the pore by a mechanism dependent on the Ran GTPase. Classical NLSs are monopartite with a single cluster of 4–5 basic amino acids or bipartite with two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a linker of 10–12 amino acids. MUC1-CD contains a RRK motif that does not conform to a prototypical monopartite NLS (29Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, certain proteins containing nonclassical NLSs are transported through the nuclear pore by binding directly to importin β (30Kau T.R. Way J.C. Silver P.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 106-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Importin β associates with several nucleoporins (31Ryan K.J. Wente S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), including Nup62, which is located on both the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic faces of nuclear pore complexes (32Percipalle P. Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Rhodes D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Other studies have indicated that β-catenin is imported into the nucleus by an importin- and nucleoporin-independent mechanism (33Suh E.K. Gumbiner B.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 290: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).The present studies demonstrate that MUC1 is imported into the nucleus by a mechanism involving binding to Nup62. We also demonstrate that MUC1 forms oligomers through a CQC motif in the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain and that MUC1 oligomerization is necessary for nuclear import.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Human ZR-75-1/vector and ZR-75-1/MUC1 small interfering RNA breast cancer cells (13Ren J.

Human HCT116 colon carcinoma and 293 kidney cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates were prepared as described (26Ren J.

Mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing. GFP-tagged MUC1-CD and its mutants were expressed by cloning into the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech). 293 cells were transfected with the expression vectors in the presence of Lipofectamine. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were prepared by expression of pGEX4T1-based vectors in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). His-tagged MUC1-CD proteins were prepared as described (26Ren J.

Stable clones were selected in puromycin (Calbiochem).Binding Assays—Cell lysates were incubated with 5 μgof GST or GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione beads. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the adsorbates were washed and then subjected to immunoblot analysis. An aliquot of total lysate (2%, v/v) was included as a control. For direct binding assays in vitro, purified GST proteins were incubated with purified His-tagged proteins in binding buffer (250 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The adsorbates were analyzed by immunoblotting.Cellular Fractionation—Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were prepared as described (25Li Y. Kufe D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Luciferase Assays—Cells were transfected with pcycD1(161)-luc (34Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase in the presence of Lipofectamine. Luciferase assays (Luciferase Assay System; Promega, Madison, WI) were performed at 48 h after transfection. Transfection efficiency was normalized by β-galactosidase expression.Anchorage-independent Growth—Cells (1 × 105) were suspended in 0.33% Noble agar (Difco) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The cell suspension was layered over 0.5% agar in medium in 100-mm dishes. Colonies of >10 cells were counted at 2 weeks.Tumorigenicity Assays—Cells (1 × 106) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 4–6-week old nude (nu/nu) mice. Tumor volumes were calculated from bidimensional measurements.RESULTSMUC1-C Associates with Nup62—To investigate mechanisms responsible for nuclear import of MUC1-C, we first asked if MUC1-C associates with importins in MUC1-positive and, as a control, MUC1-negative ZR-75-1 cells. Immunoblot analysis of anti-importin α immunoprecipitates with an antibody against the C terminus of MUC1 showed no detectable reactivity (Fig. 1A, left). As a control, the c-Abl protein, which contains an NLS, was detectable in complexes with importin α (Fig. 1A, left). When a similar analysis was performed on anti-importin β immunoprecipitates, reactivity with the anti-MUC1-C antibody was detectable with 15–25-kDa proteins (Fig. 1A, right). The anti-MUC1-C signals detected in the anti-importin β immunoprecipitates corresponded to those obtained with lysates not subjected to immunoprecipitation, indicating that MUC1-C associates with importin β and not importin α. Importin β binds to the C-terminal domain of the nucleoporin p62 (Nup62) (32Percipalle P. Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Rhodes D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Consequently, we asked if MUC1-C associates with Nup62. The results demonstrate that MUC1-C is detectable in anti-Nup62 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B). Using 293 cells that express MUC1 and Myc-tagged Nup62 (Myc-Nup62), immunoblot analysis of anti-Nup62 immunoprecipitates with anti-MUC1-C confirmed the association of MUC1-C and Nup62 (Fig. 1C). In other studies, lysates from ZR-75-1 cells were incubated with GST or GST-Nup62. Analysis of the adsorbates with anti-MUC1-C demonstrated binding of MUC1-C to GST-Nup62 and not to GST (Fig. 1D). These findings indicate that MUC1-C associates with Nup62.MUC1-CD Associates with the Nup62 T-rich and C-terminal Coiled-coil Regions—To localize the region of MUC1-C that associates with Nup62, lysates from 293 cells expressing a Myc-tagged MUC1-CD were incubated with GST or GST-Nup62. The results demonstrate that Nup62 binds to MUC1-CD (Fig. 2A, left). In the reciprocal experiment, lysates from 293 cells expressing Myc-Nup62 were incubated with GST or GST-MUC1-CD. Immunoblot analysis of the adsorbates with anti-Myc confirmed binding of Nup62 to MUC1-CD (Fig. 2A, right). To define the region of Nup62 involved in the association with MUC1-CD (Fig. 2B), 293 cells were transfected with vectors expressing the Nup62 N-terminal FXFG repeats, the T-rich linker region, and the C-terminal α-helical coiled-coil domain (Fig. 2B). Probing the lysates with GST-MUC1-CD demonstrated that MUC1-CD associates with Nup62-(178–327) and Nup62-(328–522) but not with Nup62-(1–177) (Fig. 2C). To confirm these observations, 293 cells expressing MUC1 and Myc-tagged full-length Nup62 or the deletion mutants were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc or IgG. Immunoblot analysis of the precipitates with anti-MUC1-C confirmed binding of MUC1 to Nup62-(178–327) and Nup62-(328–522) and not to Nup62-(1–177) (Fig. 2D). These findings demonstrate that MUC1-CD associates with the Nup62 T-rich linker and C-terminal coiled-coil regions.FIGURE 2MUC1-CD binds to Nup62. A, lysates from 293 cells expressing Myc-MUC1-CD were incubated with GST or GST-Nup62 (left). Lysates from 293 cells expressing Myc-Nup62 were incubated with GST or GST-MUC1-CD (right).

Immunoblot analysis under reducing conditions showed that the ∼10-kDa His-MUC1-CD is also detectable as ∼20-kDa and higher molecular mass forms (Fig. 3A). Moreover, most of the His-MUC1-CD was found at ∼20 kDa or higher under nonreducing conditions, indicating that MUC1-CD forms oligomers in vitro (Fig. 3A). A CQC motif is present at amino acids 1–3 of MUC1-CD (Fig. 2B, scheme). To determine if the cysteines are involved in the formation of MUC1-CD oligomers, we generated MUC1-CD with C-A mutations. Incubation of His-MUC1-CD with GST-MUC1-CD or GST-MUC1-CD(CQC-AQA) and immunoblot analysis of the adsorbates with anti-His demonstrated binding of His-MUC1-CD to GST-MUC1-CD and not GST-MUC1-CD(CQC-AQA) (Fig. 3B). To define the kinetics of oligomer formation, the parameters of His-MUC1-CD binding were determined using His-MUC1-CD immobilized to the sensor chip in a BIAcore. GST-MUC1-CD bound to His-MUC1-CD with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 33 nm (Fig. 3C). Substitution of His-MUC1-CD with His-MUC1-CD(CQC-AQA) showed little if any binding (data not shown). To investigate whether MUC1-CD forms oligomers in cells, we coexpressed Myc-MUC1-CD and GFP-MUC1-CD. Immunoblot analysis of anti-Myc immunoprecipitates with anti-GFP showed that Myc-MUC1-CD associates with GFP-MUC1-CD (Fig. 3D). By contrast, there was no detectable association when Myc-MUC1-CD was coexpressed with a GFP-MUC1-CD-(7–72) mutant deleted at the CQCRRK motif (Fig. 3D). There was also no detectable binding of Myc-MUC1-CD with GFP-MUC1-CD(CQC-AQA), indicating that the cysteines are essential for the interaction (Fig. 3D). These findings demonstrate that MUC1-CD forms oligomers in vitro and in cells by a mechanism dependent on the cysteine residues.FIGURE 3MUC1 forms oligomers. A, purified His-MUC1-CD was incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then separated under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining. B, purified His-MUC1-CD was incubated with GST-MUC1-CD or GST-MUC1-CD(CQC-AQA) for 1 h at room temperature. The adsorbates and input were immunoblotted (IB) with anti-His. C, His-MUC1-CD was immobilized on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chip. GST-MUC1-CD was injected over the chip at the indicated concentrations. Raw binding data were analyzed by BIAevaluation software version 3.0 and fit to a 1.1 Languir binding model. D, anti-Myc immunoprecipitates (IP) prepared from 293 cells expressing the indicated vectors were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Lysates not subjected to immunoprecipitation were used as controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MUC1-CD Binds Directly to Nup62—Incubation of purified GST-Nup62 and purified His-MUC1-CD demonstrated direct binding of MUC1-CD to Nup62 (Fig. 4A, left). Notably, oligomeric MUC1-CD was detectable in the GST-Nup62 adsorbates (Fig. 4A, left). Moreover, there was no detectable binding of MUC1-CD(CQC-AQA) to Nup62 in vitro (Fig. 4A, right). When His-MUC1-CD was incubated with the GST-Nup62 deletion mutants, binding of oligomeric MUC1-CD was detectable with Nup62-(178–327) and not Nup62-(1–177) or Nup62-(328–522) (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that, in contrast to the association of MUC1-CD with both Nup62-(178–327) and Nup62-(328–522) in cells, direct binding of MUC1-CD is selective for Nup62-(178–327) in vitro. In concert with the results obtained with purified proteins, binding of GST-Nup62 to GFP-MUC1-CD in cell lysates was abrogated by mutating CQC to AQA (Fig. 4C, left). Binding of GST-MUC1-CD to Myc-Nup62 in cell lysates was also abrogated by the CQC-AQA mutations (Fig. 4C, right). In addition, coprecipitation of Nup62 and MUC1-CD was abrogated by expressing MUC1-CD-(7–72) or MUC1-CD(CQC-AQA) (Fig. 4D). These findings indicate that MUC1-CD binds directly to Nup62 and that this interaction is dependent on the cysteines in the CQC motif.FIGURE 4Direct binding of MUC1 oligomers and Nup62. A, purified His-MUC1-CD was incubated with GST or GST-Nup62 for 1 h at room temperature (left). Purified His-MUC1-CD or His-MUC1-CD(CQC-AQA) was incubated with GST-Nup62 (right). The adsorbates were immunoblotted (IB) with anti-MUC1-C. Input of the GST proteins was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining. B, purified His-MUC1-CD was incubated with GST or the indicated GST-Nup62 deletion mutants for 1 h at room temperature. The adsorbates were immunoblotted with anti-MUC1-C. Input of the GST proteins was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining. C, lysates from 293 cells expressing GFP-MUC1-CD or GFP-MUC1-CD(CQC-AQA) were incubated with GST-Nup62 (left).

Input of the GST proteins was determined by Coomassie Blue staining.

The results demonstrate the presence of GFP-MUC1-CD and little if any GFP-MUC1-CD-(CQC-AQA) (Fig. 5A). Equal loading and purity of the nuclear fractions were documented by immunoblotting for levels of nuclear PCNA and cytoplasmic IκBα (Fig. 5A). To determine if MUC1 is imported into the nucleus by binding to Nup62, Myc-Nup62-(178–328) was expressed as a decoy to interfere with the interaction between GFP-MUC1-CD and endogenous Nup62. Immunoblot analysis of nuclear lysates demonstrated that Nup62-(178–328) blocks nuclear localization of MUC1-CD (Fig. 5B). By contrast, nuclear localization of EYFP-Nuc, which contains an NLS, was unaffected by Nup62-(178–328) expression (Fig. 5C). These findings indicate that MUC1-CD is imported into the nucleus by interacting with Nup62.FIGURE 5Nuclear import of MUC1 involves the CQC motif and Nup62.

MUC1-C expression was also detectable in two independently selected clones (A and B) of HCT116/MUC1(CQC-AQA) cells (Fig. 6A, left). Analysis of the transfectants by flow cytometry with anti-MUC1-N further demonstrated that, as found with wild-type MUC1 (13Ren J. Agata N. Chen D. Li Y. Yu W.-H. Huang L. Raina D. Chen W.

To determine if MUC1(CQC-AQA) interacts with Nup62, anti-Nup62 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-MUC1-C. The results show that binding of MUC1 to Nup62 is abrogated in the HCT116 cells expressing MUC1(CQC-AQA) (Fig. 6B). To extend this analysis, nuclear and cytosolic lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-MUC1-C. The results show that MUC1-C is detectable to a greater extent in nuclear lysates from HCT116/MUC1, as compared with HCT116/MUC1(CQC-AQA), cells (Fig. 6C). By contrast, cytosolic MUC1-C levels were similar in the HCT116/MUC1 and HCT116/MUC1 (CQC-AQA) cells (Fig. 6C). MUC1 functions as a coactivator of Tcf4-mediated transcription of the cyclin D1 promoter (9Huang L. Ren J. Chen D. Li Y. Kharba"

TNFα signaling decreases peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and glucose transporter isoform 4 (GLUT4) expression in adipocytes, impairing insulin action, and this is mediated in part by the yeast Ste20 protein kinase ortholog Map4k4. Here we show that Map4k4 expression is selectively up-regulated by TNFα, whereas the expression of the protein kinases JNK1/2, ERK1/2, p38 stress-activated protein kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 4/7 shows little or no response. Furthermore, the cytokines interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and IL-6 as well as lipopolysaccharide fail to increase Map4k4 mRNA levels in cultured adipocytes under conditions where TNFα elicits a 3-fold effect. Using agonistic and antagonistic antibodies and small interfering RNA (siRNA) against TNFα receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNFα receptor 2 (TNFR2), we show that TNFR1, but not TNFR2, mediates the increase in Map4k4 expression. TNFR1, but not TNFR2, also mediates a potent effect of TNFα on the phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38 stress-activated protein kinase and their downstream transcription factor substrates c-Jun and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2). siRNA-based depletion of c-Jun and ATF2 attenuated TNFα action on Map4k4 mRNA expression. Consistent with this concept, the phosphorylation of ATF2 along with the expression and phosphorylation of c-Jun by TNFα signaling was more robust and prolonged compared with that of IL-1β, which failed to modulate Map4k4. These data reveal that TNFα selectively stimulates the expression of a key component of its own signaling pathway, Map4k4, through a TNFR1-dependent mechanism that targets the transcription factors c-Jun and ATF2.

Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). MAP kinase activation by a variety of extracellular stimuli can be mediated by many types of cell surface receptors and occurs through protein kinase phosphorylation cascades (for reviews see Refs. 1Kyosseva S.V. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2004; 59: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar and 6Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). Such cascades involve the activation of a MAP kinase kinase kinase, which phosphorylates and activates a MAP kinase kinase, which in turn phosphorylates and activates an effector MAP kinase. This activation pattern is conserved from yeasts to mammals (7Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar). In the past few years much effort has concentrated on identifying additional upstream kinases that regulate the downstream effector MAP kinases. This effort has led to the identification and characterization of the sterile 20 (Ste20p) family of protein kinases, which can act upstream of MAP kinase kinase kinases. Sterile 20 kinases can be divided into two groups, the germinal center protein kinases and the p21-activated protein kinases. One germinal center protein kinase member, which we recently identified as a negative regulator of adipogenesis, is Map4k4 (8Tang X. Guilherme A. Chakladar A. Powelka A.M. Konda S. Virbasius J.V.

Map4k4 is a member of the germinal center protein kinase IV group, which appears to control cellular events ranging from cell motility, rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, and cell proliferation (9Taira K.

The majority of studies focusing on Map4k4 propose that Map4k4 acts as an upstream activator of the c-Jun-N-terminal kinases 1 and 2 (JNK1/2), extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and p38 SAP kinase (12Zohn I.E.

We initially identified Map4k4 in an siRNA screen for regulators of insulin-sensitive deoxyglucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (8Tang X. Guilherme A. Chakladar A. Powelka A.M. Konda S. Virbasius J.V. Nicoloro S.M. Straubhaar J. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Remarkably, silencing of Map4k4 with siRNA caused an increase in the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) along with a corresponding increase in the expression of the insulin-responsive facilitative glucose transporter isoform 4 (GLUT4) (8Tang X. Guilherme A. Chakladar A. Powelka A.M. Konda S. Virbasius J.V. Nicoloro S.M. Straubhaar J. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PPARγ is nuclear hormone receptor that regulates the expression of numerous genes specific to the adipocyte differentiation program, including GLUT4 (16Farmer S.R. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar), which mediates insulin-dependent glucose transport into both muscle and adipose tissue. Selective loss of GLUT4 in muscle or adipose tissue of mice leads to insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and diabetes (17Abel E.D. Peroni O. Kim J.K. Kim Y.B. Boss O. Hadro E. Minnemann T. Shulman G.I. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 18Zisman A. Peroni O.D. Abel E.D. Michael M.D. Mauvais-Jarvis F. Lowell B.B. Wojtaszewski J.F.

Conversely, increased GLUT4 levels in adipose tissue of transgenic mice enhance whole body glucose homeostasis, suggesting that improved glucose disposal in adipose tissue may alleviate metabolic disease (19Shepherd P.R. Gnudi L. Tozzo E. Yang H. Leach F. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22243-22246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the regulation of molecules such as Map4k4 that govern the expression and activity of PPARγ and GLUT4 in adipocytes may provide important insights into potential mechanisms that both promote and alleviate metabolic disease. Our finding that Map4k4 acts as a negative regulator of adipogenesis and insulin-stimulated glucose transport (8Tang X. Guilherme A. Chakladar A. Powelka A.M. Konda S. Virbasius J.V. Nicoloro S.M. Straubhaar J. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) suggested that it may play a role in signaling by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), a cytokine that is also a known negative regulator of adipogenesis and GLUT4 expression (20Ruan H. Hacohen N. Golub T.R. Van Parijs L. Lodish H.F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1319-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 21Ruan H. Miles P.D.G. Ladd C.M. Ross K. Golub T.R. Olefsky J.M. Lodish H.F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3176-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In agreement with this idea, Map4k4 has been suggested to be an upstream element in the TNFα signaling cascade (22Yao Z.

Many studies have recently brought attention to the importance of cytokines in inducing the low grade inflammation observed in obesity (23Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M.

Furthermore, TNFα attenuates metabolic signaling pathways initiated by the insulin receptor that leads to stimulation of glucose uptake (26Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M.

Greenberg A.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). siRNA-based silencing of Map4k4 partially protected against the TNFα-induced depletion of both PPARγ and GLUT4 (8Tang X. Guilherme A. Chakladar A. Powelka A.M. Konda S. Virbasius J.V. Nicoloro S.M. Straubhaar J. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Additionally, siRNA silencing of Map4k4 has recently been shown to completely restore insulin sensitivity in muscle tissue from diabetic humans, in part by down-regulating TNFα activation of JNK1/2 and ERK1/2 (15Bouzakri K. Zierath J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7783-7789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Hence, it appears that Map4k4 functions in the signaling pathways that mediate at least some of the inhibitory effects of TNFα on adipose and muscle tissue processes. We previously noted that Map4k4 mRNA expression may be enhanced after TNFα treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (8Tang X. Guilherme A. Chakladar A. Powelka A.M. Konda S. Virbasius J.V. Nicoloro S.M. Straubhaar J. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), a potentially significant modality through which TNFα may amplify it own acute signaling intensity. Based on this preliminary observation, the aim of the present studies was to further investigate whether Map4k4 protein kinase is indeed increased in adipocytes treated with TNFα and to identify the signaling pathways downstream of the TNFα receptors that control Map4k4 expression. We report here a remarkable specificity of TNFα action on Map4k4 protein kinase expression such that expression of other stress protein kinases such as JNK1/2 and p38 SAP kinase are unaffected by TNFα. Strikingly, TNFα action on Map4k4 is not mimicked by other cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6. It is demonstrated here that this specificity of TNFα responsiveness appears due to a unique robust and prolonged phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38 SAP kinase that leads to activation of the transcription factors c-Jun and ATF2. These latter factors are in turn required for regulated Map4k4 expression. Materials—Mouse recombinant tumor necrosis factor α was obtained from Calbiochem (catalog #654245). Mouse recombinant interleukin-6, mouse recombinant interleukin 1β, and LPS were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog #I9646, I5271, and L6529, respectively). Antibodies against IκBα (sc-371), JNK1/2 (sc-7345), phospho-c-Jun (sc-1694), and phospho-JNK1/2 (sc-6254) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against ATF2 (9226), phospho-ATF2 (9221), p38 SAP kinase (9212), and phospho-p38 SAP kinase (9215) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Antibody to stimulate TNF receptor 1 (AF-425-PB) and TNF receptor 2 (ab7369) were purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN) and Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, MA), respectively. TNF receptor 1 neutralizing antibody (MAB430) was also purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. Normal goat IgG (AB108C) was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc., whereas normal Rat IgG (20005-1) and hamster IgG (20003) were purchased from Alpha Diagnostics International, Inc. (San Antonio, TX). All siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) and were custom ordered SMARTpool™ duplexes. Generation of Map4k4 Antibody—Anti-Map4k4 antibody was generated by injecting rabbits with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein corresponding to amino acids 453–720 of Map4k4. This hydrophilic region was selected because of predicted high antigenicity and high surface probability. The region was amplified by PCR (forward primer 5′-CCCAGGAATTCGAAGAGGAGAGTGGAGAGGGAACAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ACGATGCGGCCGCTCCCGCAGGCTTGAGAGACCG-3′), cloned into a pGEX-5 vector and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. Cultures were induced using 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 6 h and then lysed in STE buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 ng/ml aprotinin, 5 ng/ml leupeptin, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mg/ml lysozyme) followed by the addition of 1% Triton, 2 μg DNase, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm MnCl2 30 min later. The Map4k4 fusion protein was then incubated with glutathione-agarose beads end over end for 1 h at 4°C. The isolated glutathione S-transferase Map4k4 fusion peptide was shipped to Rockland for rabbit injection. 400 μg of protein was injected into two rabbits for the initial immunization followed by three 200-μg injections for immunological boosts at days 7, 14, and 21 after the initial injection. The IgG fractions were then isolated using protein A-agarose beads. To affinity purify the anti-Map4k4 antibodies, 1 mg of lysates from hemagglutinin-Map4K4 expressing COS-1 cells was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then cut as strips between 250 and 150 kDa and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, Tris-buffered saline-Tween for 1 h. The membrane strip was then incubated overnight with 2 ml of the IgG fraction and washed twice with Tris-buffered saline-Tween buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The anti-Map4K4 antibodies were eluted with the addition of 1 ml of glycine (100 mm, pH 2.6) to the strips and incubated for 10 min at room temperature, with occasional vortexing. The eluted antibodies were transferred to a fresh tube containing 0.1 ml of 1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.0, as well as 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% azide to bring the final pH to 7.0. Antibodies were stored at –20 °C. Cell Culture and siRNA Transfection—3T3-L1 fibroblasts were cultured and differentiated into adipocytes as previously described (36Jiang Z.Y. Zhou Q.L. Coleman K.A. Chouinard M. Boese Q. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7569-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). For siRNA transfections, cells 4 days post-induction of differentiation were used as previously described (8Tang X. Guilherme A. Chakladar A. Powelka A.M. Konda S. Virbasius J.V. Nicoloro S.M. Straubhaar J. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.125 × 106 cells were electroporated using 6 nmol of siRNA and then plated in 4 wells of a 12-well plate. Cells were recovered in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) and were cultured for 48 h after the transfection before beginning experiments. TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and LPS Stimulation—3T3-L1 adipocytes, either 7 days post-differentiation or 72 h post-siRNA transfection, were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with the indicated concentrations of TNFα in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for the appropriate time intervals. For cytokine and LPS stimulations, 3T3-L1 adipocytes 4 days post-differentiation induction were harvested and resuspended in 50 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium per 15-cm plate. The adipocytes were distributed such that 1 ml of the harvested adipocytes was distributed per well of a 12-plate (catalog #3515, Corning, Inc., Corning, NY). After 72 h the adipocytes were treated with the appropriate concentration of cytokine for the given period of time. In all experiments cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested on ice as described previously (37Bose A. Guilherme A. Robida S.I. Nicoloro S.M. Zhou Q.L. Jiang Z.Y. Pomerleau D.P. Czech M.P. Nature. 2002; 420: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Protein samples were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were then analyzed by Western blot analysis. Changes in phosphorylation were determined through densitometry using Adobe Photoshop and normalized for loading against the non-phosphorylated kinase or transcription factor, with the exception of c-Jun, whose expression increased during the entire stimulation, and IκBα, whose expression was variable. TNFR1 and TNFR2 Stimulation—3T3-L1 adipocytes were prepared the same as described for the cytokine treatments. 3T3-L1 adipocytes 7 days post-differentiation were treated with the indicated concentrations of antagonistic or agonistic antibodies against TNFR1 or TNFR2 in the presence or absence of TNFα for 24 h. Antibodies were used at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturers for maximal activity. Antagonistic antibodies were also tested for IL-6 induction at 10 times the concentration recommended, and no additional increase in IL-6 mRNA was detected (data not shown). After treatment, the cells were lysed and analyzed the same as for the cytokine treatments. Isolation of RNA and Quantitative Real Time PCR— RNA isolation was performed according to the Trizol reagent protocol (catalog #15596-018, Invitrogen). Briefly, media was aspirated, and the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Next, 1 ml of Trizol reagent was added to each well. The concentration and the purity of the RNA were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260/280 nm. To further determine the quality of the RNA, 1 μg of total RNA was run on a 1% agarose gel, and the quality of the 28 S and 18 S ribosomal bands was inspected visually. cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of RNA and the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (catalog #170-8891) from Bio-Rad. The cDNA was synthesized according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer in a 20-μl reaction volume. For real time PCR, 1 μl of the synthesized cDNA was loaded into 1 well of a 96-well plate for detection of a specific target gene. Primers used are listed in supplemental Fig. 1 and were designed with primer bank (38Wang X. Seed B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e154Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase was used as an internal loading control because its expression did not change over a 24-h period with the addition of TNFα and the silencing of the genes used in this study. 10 pmol of forward and reverse primer along with 12.5 μl of the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) was added to each well along with DNase/RNase-free water for a final volume of 25 μl. Samples were run on the MyIQ Realtime PCR System (Bio-Rad). Relative gene expression was determined using the ΔCT method (39Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116537) Google Scholar). Statistics—The distributional characteristics of the outcomes were evaluated by both a visual inspection of histograms and the Kolmogorov-Smirnoz test performed on model residuals. Transformation by natural logarithms was used in some cases to better approximate a normal distribution and to stabilize variances. The observed effects were evaluated by either one-way or multifactorial analysis of variance (ANOVA). In the presence of significant main and/or interaction effects, pairwise comparisons were made using the Tukey (HSD) multiple comparisons procedure with the exception of Fig. 3, where the Tukey-Kramer method was used due to unequal sample sizes between the groups. Computations were performed using SAS Statistical software package. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. TNFα Signaling Up-regulates the Expression of Map4k4 Protein and mRNA—To better characterize the TNFα-mediated increase in Map4k4 mRNA expression, we examined the dose-response relationship and time course of TNFα action in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1, A and B). The fully differentiated adipocytes were treated with various concentrations of TNFα ranging from 0.1 to 100 ng/ml for 24 h. The cells were then lysed, RNA was isolated, and the Map4k4 mRNA levels were compared using quantitative real time PCR. A maximal increase in Map4k4 mRNA in response to 5–10 ng/ml TNFα was observed that reached about 3-fold (Fig. 1A). This concentration of TNFα corresponds to previously reported concentrations of TNFα that caused maximal impairment of insulin signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (26Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). A time course analysis of the increase in Map4k4 mRNA after 50 ng/ml TNFα showed a 2-fold increase in Map4k4 mRNA at 2 h that increased by 48 h to a maximal stimulation of greater than 4-fold (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the increase in Map4k4 mRNA resulted in a corresponding increase in protein, adipocytes were treated with 50 ng/ml TNFα for 24 h, lysed, and immunoblotted with an antibody we raised in rabbits. At 24 h after the addition of TNFα, a 2.5-fold increase in Map4k4 protein levels was observed (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, treatment with TNFα significantly increases Map4k4 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Map4k4 has been proposed to act in a cascade that stimulates JNK1/2 activity in response to TNFα through a MKK4and MKK7-dependent mechanism (22Yao Z. Zhou G. Wang X.S. Brown A. Diener K. Gan H. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2118-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To determine whether TNFα increases the expression of Map4k4 mRNA selectively among the MAP kinase family, we treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with various concentrations of TNFα over a 24 h period and then measured Map4k4, MKK4, MKK7, JNK1, JNK2, ERK1, and ERK2 protein kinase mRNA levels using quantitative real time PCR. Map4k4 mRNA levels increased 1.5, 2.6 (p < 0.01), and 3.4-fold (p < 0.01) with 1, 5, and 25 ng/ml TNFα, respectively (Fig. 2). In contrast, the expression of MKK4, MKK7, ERK2, JNK1, and JNK2 was unperturbed by TNFα signaling. ERK1 mRNA expression was found to increase only very slightly 1.2-, 1.7 (p < 0.01)-, and 1.4-fold (p < 0.05) at 1, 5, and 25 ng/ml TNFα. Furthermore, in other studies p38 SAP kinase protein expression did not change during treatment with 25 ng/ml TNFα (see Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results suggest that the increase in Map4k4 expression after TNFα treatment is unique among the MAP kinases we tested in its high responsiveness to TN"

In this study, we characterized developmentally regulated brain CS/DS chains using a single chain antibody, GD3G7, produced by the phage display technique. Evaluation of the specificity of GD3G7 toward various glycosaminoglycan preparations showed that this antibody specifically reacted with squid CS-E (rich in the GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-sulfate) disaccharide unit E), hagfish CS-H (rich in the IdoUAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-sulfate) unit iE), and shark skin DS (rich in both E and iE units). In situ hybridization for the expression of N-acetylgalac-tosamine-4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase in the postnatal mouse brain, which is involved in the biosynthesis of CS/DS-E, showed a widespread expression of the transcript in the developing brain except at postnatal day 7, where strong expression was observed in the external granule cell layer in the cerebellum. The expression switched from the external to internal granule cell layer with development. Immunohistochemical localization of GD3G7 in the mouse brain showed that the epitope was relatively abundant in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. GD3G7 suppressed the growth of neurites in embryonic hippocampal neurons mediated by CS-E, suggesting that the epitope is embedded in the neurite outgrowth-promoting motif of CS-E. In addition, a CS-E decasaccharide fraction was found to be the critical minimal structure needed for recognition by GD3G7. Four discrete decasaccharide epitopic sequences were identified.

CS-PGs, which constitute the major population of PGs in the central nervous system, influence the formation of neuronal nuclei and the establishment of boundaries for axonal growth and act as modulators of neuronal outgrowth (11Schwartz N.B. Domowicz M. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The CS chain's backbone consists of repetitive disaccharide units containing d-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues, whereas DS is a stereoisomeric variant of CS with varying proportions of l-iduronic acid (IdoUA) in place of GlcUA. In mammalian tissues, these chains are often found as CS/DS hybrid structures, and further structural variability of these chains during chain elongation is produced by divergent sulfation in the repeating disaccharide units by various sulfotransferases. Sulfation occurs at C-2 of GlcUA/IdoUA and/or C-4 and/or C-6 of GalNAc in various combinations, thereby producing characteristic sulfation patterns and enormous structural diversity. Recent studies have shown that proportions of these disaccharide units in chick, mouse, and pig brain change with development (12Maeda N. He J. Yajima Y. Mikami T. Sugahara K. Yabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35805-35811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K. Tone Y. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

Moreover, oversulfated CS/DS chains from various marine animals showed growth factor-binding and neurite outgrowth-promoting activities in vitro (14Nadanaka S. Clement A. Masayama K. Faissner A.

CS/DS chains act as neuritogenic molecules (for reviews, see Refs. 6Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama T. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Miller J.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar). Such apparently contradictory functions are probably attributed to the structural diversity of CS/DS chains. Significant and various proportions of disulfated disaccharide units, such as the D unit (GlcUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S)) and E unit (GlcUA-GalNAc(4S,6S)), are detected in the brain of cattle (24Saigo K. Egami F. J. Neurochem. 1970; 17: 633-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), embryonic day 13 (E13) mice (25Zou P. Zou K. Muramatsu H. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Habuchi O. Ohtake S. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Muramatsu T. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and E18 rats (26Ueoka C. Kaneda N. Okazaki I. Nadanaka S. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

Recently, we demonstrated that the rare oversulfated disaccharide units D and/or iD (IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S)) and E present in embryonic pig brain-derived CS/DS chains are critical elements for neuritogenesis (27Bao X. Pavao M.S. Dos Santos J.C. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23184-23193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, CS chains from appican, the amyloid precursor protein expressed by rat C6 glioma cells, contained significant proportions of D and E units (28Tsuchida K. Shioi J. Yamada S. Boghosian G.

CS-H, isolated from the hagfish notochord, has a unique oversulfated structure characterized by a major disaccharide H (or iE) unit (IdoUA-GalNAc(4S,6S)) (6Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama T. Mizuguchi S.

The term DS-E for this glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and iE (where “i” represents IdoUA) for the H disaccharide unit have been proposed (6Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama T. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 18Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Further, exogenous DS-E/CS-H exhibited appreciable inhibitory activity in midkine (MK)-mediated neuronal cell adhesion similar to CS-E (26Ueoka C. Kaneda N. Okazaki I. Nadanaka S. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37407-37413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, the presence of oversulfated CS-E and/or iE structures in the mammalian brain has not been rigorously characterized. In biosynthesis, the structural variability of CS/DS chains is generated under the control of multiple sulfotransferases and glucuronyl C5-epimerase, which converts GlcUA to IdoUA (for reviews, see Refs. 31Fransson L.A.

Chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 and -2 catalyze the 4-O-sulfation of GalNAc residues in chondroitin as well as in dermatan, whereas dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 catalyzes the 4-O-sulfation of GalNAc residues in dermatan (Refs. 34Mikami T.

Several other sulfotransferases like N-acetylgalactosamine-4-O-sulfotransferase-1 and -2, which catalyze 4-O-sulfation at the nonreducing terminal GalNAc residues in GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ-, have also been cloned. On the other hand, N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (GalNAc4S-6ST), which catalyzes the transfer of sulfate to the 6-O-position of N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate (GalNAc4S), has been cloned (38Ohtake S. Ito Y. Fukuta M. Habuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43894-43900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) but not yet analyzed in the brain. The gene expression pattern of this sulfotransferase would provide clues for investigating the distribution of CS-E chains in the brain. Hence, we performed in situ hybridization to probe the distribution of GalNAc4S-6ST in postnatal mouse brain and also studied the possible functions of E/iE-containing structures in brain development using a new antibody, GD3G7, generated by the phage display technique (39Smetsers T.F. van de Westerlo E.M. ten Dam G.B.

Poly-d l-ornithine and anti-neurofilament antibody were purchased from Sigma, and MAP2 (anti-microtubule-associated protein 2) was from Leico Technologies Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Laminin isolated from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse tumor was from Invitrogen. A Vectastain ABC kit was obtained from Vector Laboratories. 35S-Labeled 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—For the evaluation of the specificity of the antibody in antigen recognition, streptavidin-coated plates were used. The reactivity of the antibody with various GAG subtypes was tested by ELISA as described previously (42Bao X. Mikami T. Yamada S. Faissner A. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9180-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GAGs were individually biotinylated and immobilized on the plates. Wells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated with 10-fold diluted primary antibody GD3G7. Since this antibody contains a VSV tag, the tag was used to detect binding of the antibody. A hybridoma supernatant of the anti-VSV tag mouse monoclonal antibody P5D4 in 0.1% BSA, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (diluted 5,000-fold) was used, followed by alkaline phosphatase-linked goat anti-mouse Ig (G + M). Enzymatic activity was detected using p-nitrophenylphosphate, and the absorbance was measured at 415 nm. For the inhibitory ELISA, a certain amount of GAG, even-numbered oligosaccharide, or structurally defined oligosaccharide was incubated with the antibody GD3G7 (periplasmic fraction, diluted 10-fold) in a total volume of 50 μl at room temperature for 1 h before being applied to CS-E and streptavidin-coated plates. The inhibition was calculated from the reduced absorbance relative to that obtained from a control incubation without GAG. Construction of a Soluble Form of GalNAc4S-6ST—A zebrafish GalNAc4S-6ST was identified in silico by a TBLASTN search using as a query sequence the mouse counterpart (GenBank™ accession number AB 187269). The cDNA encoding a truncated form of zebrafish GalNAc4S-6ST lacking the first NH2-terminal 81 amino acid residues was amplified by PCR with the pGEM-T Easy Vector containing the full coding sequence of the protein using a 5′-primer containing an inframe BamHI site (5′-GCGGATCCGGGCTCTTTTTAACACC-3′) and a 3′-primer containing a BamHI site located 77 bp downstream from the stop codon (5′-GCGGATCCACCAAGCATCGGCCT-3′). PCR was carried out with KOD-plus-DNA polymerase (TOYOBO, Tokyo) by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 42 s, and 68 °C for 90 s. The PCR products of the expected size were digested with BamHI and cloned into the BamHI site of an expression vector, pEF-BOS/IP (43Kitagawa H. Egusa N. Tamura J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4834-4838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The resultant vector contained the insulin leader peptide and a protein A IgG-binding domain followed by the truncated form of zebrafish GalNAc4S-6ST. Expression of a Soluble Form of Putative GalNAc4S-6ST and Enzyme Assay—The expression plasmid was introduced into COS-1 cells in 100-mm plates using FuGENE™ 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days after the transfection, a 1-ml aliquot of the culture medium was incubated with 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The enzyme-bound beads were washed with and resuspended in the assay buffer described below and used as an enzyme source for the sulfotransferase assay. Sulfotransferase activity toward CS/DS was assayed by a method described previously (44Yamauchi S. Hirahara Y. Usui H. Takeda Y. Hoshino M. Fukuta M. Kimura J.H. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2456-2463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, the standard reaction mixture (60 μl) contained 10 μl of the resuspended beads, 50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm [35S]PAPS (1 or 3 × 105 dpm), and CS-B from porcine skin, which had been pretreated with nitrous acid as the acceptor polysaccharide (2 μg as GlcUA). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and subjected to gel filtration using a syringe column packed with Sephadex G-25 (superfine) (45Kitagawa H. Tsuchida K. Ujikawa M. Sugahara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1083-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The incorporation of [35S]sulfate into the polysaccharide acceptor was quantified by determination of the radioactivity in the flow-through fractions by liquid scintillation counting. Identification of the Transferase Reaction Products—The 35S-labeled CS-B was isolated by gel filtration as described above, dried, and subjected to exhaustive digestion with chondroitinase ABC, AC-I, or B (46Sugahara K. Ohkita Y. Shibata Y. Yoshida K. Ikegami A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7204-7212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The digest was analyzed by anion exchange HPLC on a column of amine-bound silica PA03 (47Sugahara K. Okumura Y. Yamashina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or by gel filtration on a column of Superdex™ peptide (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) equilibrated with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 as described previously (48Kim B.T.

In Situ Hybridization—Brains were quickly removed from P7, P14, P21, and 7-week-old ddY mice and frozen in powdered dry ice. Consecutive brain sections were cut at a thickness of 16 μm with a cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Tokyo, Japan), thaw-mounted onto 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-precoated glass slides, and stored at –80 °C prior to use. The pGEM-T Easy Vector containing a cDNA fragment (∼2.0 kbp) of mouse GalNAc4S-6ST (UniGene Cluster Mm. 213582) was linearized with a restriction enzyme, NcoI or SalI, for synthesis of antisense or sense RNA probes, respectively. After enzymatic digestion, each digest was treated with a mixture of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and purified by ethanol precipitation. 35S-Labeled riboprobes were transcribed using a MAXIscript™ T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) with 5′-α-[35S]thiotriphosphate (∼30 TBq/mmol) (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). Before being loaded on the slides, the radiolabeled probes were mixed individually into a hybridization buffer (50% (v/v) formamide, 10% (v/v) dextran sulfate, 2.5× Denhardt's solution, 4× saline-sodium citrate (SSC), 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5 mg/ml tRNA from brewers' yeast (Roche Applied Science), and 20 mm dithiothreitol) at a concentration of 107 cpm/ml. In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (49Simmons D.M. Arriza J.L. Swanson L.W. J. Histotechnol. 1989; 12: 169-181Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, the brain sections were fixed in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 15 min. This was followed by digestion with proteinase K (2 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 10 min, acetylation in 0.25% (v/v) acetic anhydride in 0.1 m triethanolamine at room temperature for 10 min, and dehydration through graded concentrations of ethanol. After drying, the tissue sections were pretreated with the hybridization buffer without 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate at 55 °C for 1 h and then with the hybridization buffer containing the RNA probe prepared as above and incubated in a moisture chamber at 55 °C for 18 h. The sections were then rinsed twice in 2× SSC containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at room temperature for 5 min; digested with RNase A (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min; rinsed twice in 50% formamide, 2× SSC, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 55 °C for 30 min and subsequently in 2× SSC, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at room temperature for 10 min; and dehydrated through graded concentrations of ethanol. The processed sections were exposed to x-ray films (Bio Max MR; Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1 week for signal detection. Immunohistochemistry—Immunostaining was done as described previously (27Bao X. Pavao M.S. Dos Santos J.C. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23184-23193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, cryosections (18 μm thick) of mouse brain were fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1) and rehydrated with distilled water. The sections were then treated sequentially with the following solutions: 1) 2.5% hydrogen peroxidase in PBS (10 mm, pH 7.4) for 30 min; 2) 1% BSA, 4% normal horse serum in PBS for 60 min; 3) primary phage display antibody in 1% BSA, PBS (diluted 25-fold) overnight at 4 °C; 4) anti-VSV tag mouse monoclonal IgG antibody, P5D4, in 1% BSA, PBS (1,000-fold) for 60 min; 5) anti-mouse IgG biotinylated antibody in 1% BSA, PBS (200-fold) for 60 min; 6) Vectastain ABC solution in PBS (200-fold) for 60 min; 7) 0.06% diaminobenzidine in PBS for 10 min; 8) 0.06% diaminobenzidine, 0.01% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 5 min. Finally, sections were fixed with a series of ethanol solutions and xylene and then mounted with a xylene-based mounting medium. To confirm the specificity of staining with the antibody, brain sections were treated with chondroitinase ABC protease-free (5 mIU/section) to remove CS and DS. To confirm the minimal size for GD3G7, 1 nmol of the CS-E octa- or decasaccharide fraction was preincubated with the primary antibody at 37 °C for 60 min before being added to the sections. In this case, polyester wax sections were used as follows. Brains were fixed overnight in a 3.7% formaldehyde solution and then dehydrated through several changes of ice-cold 70%, 90%, and absolute ethanol for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, brains were placed in 50% (v/v) polyester wax in absolute ethanol over-night at 37 °C followed by 90% polyester wax in absolute ethanol at 37 °C overnight. Brains were embedded in a 90% wax solution, and the blocks were cut serially at 5 μm with a cryostat and were mounted onto glass slides. The slides were dried over-night at 4 °C and then processed for immunostaining as described above. Cell Culture—Hippocampal cells were cultured using E16.5 mouse brains as described previously (16Hikino M. Mikami T. Faissner A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Pavao M.S. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

Dissociated cells were suspended in Eagle's modified essential medium containing an N2 supplement, seeded on poly-d l-ornithine-coated coverslips, and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Neurite Growth Assay—Neurite growth of hippocampal neurons from E16.5 mouse brains was assayed as described previously (16Hikino M. Mikami T. Faissner A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Pavao M.S. Sugahara K. J.

Briefly, plastic coverslips (10 × 10 mm) were treated with 1.5 μg/ml of poly-d l-ornithine in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 8.2, for 2 h at room temperature and then further coated with CS-E or laminin at a dose of 2 or 10 μg/cm2 per coverslip, respectively, in PBS at 4 °C overnight, washed with PBS three times, and incubated with the antibody GD3G7 (10 and 100 μg/ml). After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, the coverslips were washed with PBS three times and then seeded with hippocampal cells at 10,000 cells/cm2. An ir"

We investigated the effects of Nov overexpression by transducing murine ST-2 stromal and MC3T3 osteoblastic cells with a retroviral vector where Nov is under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. We also examined the skeletal phenotype of transgenic mice expressing Nov under the control of the human osteocalcin promoter. Overexpression of Nov in ST-2 cells inhibited the appearance of mineralized nodules and decreased alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin mRNA levels. Nov overexpression inhibited the effect of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 on the phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8; on the transactivation of 12xSBE-Oc-pGL3, a BMP/Smad signaling reporter construct, and of Wnt 3 on cytoplasmic β-catenin levels; and on the transactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling reporter construct 16xTCF-Luc. Nov overexpression did not activate Notch or transforming growth factor β signaling. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays demonstrated direct Nov-BMP interactions. Nov transgenic mice exhibited osteopenia. In conclusion, Nov binds BMP-2 and antagonizes BMP-2 and Wnt activity, and its overexpression inhibits osteoblastogenesis and causes osteopenia."
https://openalex.org/W1998294296,"POU domain transcription factor Oct-4 plays a crucial role in maintaining self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the molecular mechanism controlling Oct-4 levels in ES cells remains largely unknown. To explore the molecular mechanism regulating Oct-4 function, we constructed a mouse ES cell cDNA library and performed yeast two-hybrid screening using the POU domain of Oct-4 as bait. Here, we present novel evidence for Oct-4 interaction with Ubc9, an E2 conjugation enzyme for SUMO modification, and its modification by SUMO-1. The SUMO acceptor site was identified at lysine residue 118. Importantly, disruption of Oct-4 sumoylation reduced Oct-4 protein stability and self-renewal capacity in ES cells. Interestingly, expression of cYes was found to reduce when Oct-4 sumoylation was disrupted or Oct-4 expression downregulated in ES cells. We further demonstrate that Oct-4 was recruited to the cYes promoter region, suggesting that cYes might be a novel downstream gene of Oct-4. Taken together, we first demonstrate the post-translational modification of endogenous Oct-4 by SUMO and the role of sumoylation in regulating Oct-4 protein stability and function. Our findings provide new evidence for the important role of post-translational modification in controlling Oct-4 function in ES cells."
https://openalex.org/W2081958807,"In an attempt to study the role of Eps8 in human carcinogenesis, we observe that ectopic overexpression of Eps8 in SW480 cells (low Eps8 expression) increases cell proliferation. By contrast, expressing eps8 small interference RNA in SW620 and WiDr cells (high Eps8 expression) reduces their proliferation rate. Interestingly, attenuation of Eps8 decreases Src Pi-Tyr-416, Shc Pi-Tyr-317, and serum-induced FAK Pi-Tyr-397 and Pi-Tyr-861. Remarkably, by virtue of mammalian target of rapamycin/STAT3 Pi-Ser-727, Eps8 modulates FAK expression required for cell proliferation. Within 62% of colorectal tumor specimens examined, >2-fold enhancement of Eps8 as compared with their normal counterparts is observed, especially for those from the advanced stage. In agreement with the modulation of FAK by Eps8, the concomitant expression of these two proteins in tumor specimens is observed. Notably, Eps8 attenuation also impedes the motility of SW620 and WiDr cells, which can be rescued by ectopically expressed FAK.

Biosci. 2003; 8: s28-s38Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). During the search for novel EGFR substrates, Eps8 (EGFR pathway substrate number 8) as suggested by its designation was originally identified as a putative EGFR target devoid of phosphotyrosine-binding SH2 domain (3Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoska V. Castagnino P. Miki T. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3799-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Among its 97- and 68-kDa isoforms, only the former is well characterized and thus referred to as Eps8. Later, Eps8 also is the substrate for Src tyrosine kinase (4Maa M.-C. Lai J.-R. Lin R.-W. Leu T.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition to tyrosyl phosphorylation, expression of Eps8 is also affected by Src activity (4Maa M.-C. Lai J.-R. Lin R.-W. Leu T.-H. Biochim. Biophys.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1929-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Remarkably, its aberrant overexpression in murine fibroblasts can lead to cellular transformation (6Maa M.-C. Hsieh C.Y. Leu T.-H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and of note, Eps8 overexpression contributes to Src-mediated transformation (7Leu T.-H. Yeh H.H. Huang C.-C. Chuang Y.-C. Su S.L. Maa M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9875-9881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).As an adaptor protein, Eps8 contains several structural features such as a split pleckstrin homology, a putative nuclear targeting sequence, a central SH3 domain, and several proline-rich regions. Although the split pleckstrin homology confers the ability of Eps8 to associate with plasma membrane in response to serum stimulation and conveys signals to ERK activation (6Maa M.-C. Hsieh C.Y. Leu T.-H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), Eps8 can also complex with Abi-1/E3b1 and RN-tre separately through its SH3 domain (8Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Nomura N. Robbins K.C. Di Fiore P.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2679-2688PubMed Google Scholar, 9Biesova Z. Piccoli C. Wong W.T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). By interacting with Abi-1 or RN-tre, Eps8 integrates signals leading to actin cytoskeleton via Rac and receptor endocytosis via Rab5, respectively (10Scita G. Nordstrom J. Carbone R. Tenca P.

Recently, IRSp53 has been demonstrated as an Eps8-binding protein whose complex with Eps8 reinforces Rac activation and cell migration in fibrosarcoma cells (12Funato Y. Terabayashi T. Suenaga N. Seiki M. Takenawa T. Miki H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5237-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Besides, Eps8 is also identified as an actin capper, which is capable of regulating actin-based motility (13Disanza A. Carlier M.F. Stradal T.E. Didry D. Frittoli E. Confalonieri S. Croce A. Wehland J. Di Fiore P.P. Scita G. Nat.

Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 15Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Upon integrin engagement, FAK becomes activated and autophosphorylated at Tyr-397, which mediates the SH2-dependent binding of Src family tyrosine kinases. Through complex with FAK, Src mediates its phosphorylation at Tyr-407, -576/577, -861, and -925 (18Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell.

Although Pi-Tyr-576/577 and Pi-Tyr-861 individually enhance FAK trans- and cis-phosphorylation activity (20Leu T.-H. Maa M.-C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6992-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), Pi-Tyr-925 provides the binding site for Grb2 SH2 domain and triggers Ras signaling (21Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In addition, FAK may interact with other signaling molecules, including phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase Cas, paxillin, Graf, and Asap1 resulting in cell adhesion and migration (16Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Overexpression of FAK has been reported in many types of tumors and is strongly correlated with tumor invasiveness (23Weiner T.M. Liu E.T. Craven R.J. Cance W.G.

However, its underlying mechanism is still vague.As one of the ten leading cancers, colorectal cancer (CRC), is also one of the major causes of cancer mortality regardless of sex difference worldwide (26Parker S.L. Tong T. Bolden S. CA Cancer J. Clin. 1996; 46: 5-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). Epidemiological studies indicate that the genetic defects in APC gene and genes involved in mismatch repair (i.e. hMSH2, hMLH1, and hPMS2) constitute the majority of inherited CRC (27Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar). Albeit no specific lesions have been identified in the remaining sporadic cases, activation of k-ras oncogene, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, including APC, p53, and DCC, and elevated expression and/or activity of Src (28Talamonti M.S. Roh M.S. Curley S.A. Gallick G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and FAK (24Owens L.V. Xu L. Craven R.J. Dent G.A. Weiner T.M. Konberg L. Liu E.T. Cance W.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2752-2755PubMed Google Scholar) are reported to associate with the progression of colorectal adenoma to invasive carcinoma. Although augmented expression of FAK causes abnormal cell growth (29Yamamoto D. Sonoda Y. Hasegawa M. Funakoshi-Tago M. Aizu-Yokota E. Kasahara T.

In this study, we demonstrated the contribution of Eps8 in human colon cancer. Concurrent with its pivotal role in both cell proliferation and motility in colonocytes, preferentially increased Eps8 in the advanced stage of human CRC specimens was detected. Consistent with the concomitant enhancement of FAK and Eps8 observed in tumor specimen, we demonstrated that Eps8-induced FAK expression could be mediated through mTOR/STAT3 Pi-Ser-727. In addition, Eps8 also elevated the activity of Src, and increased serum-dependent FAK activity. Because forced expression of FAK in Eps8 knockdown cells restored cellular growth and motility, we concluded that Eps8-elicited mitogenesis and locomotion was partly attributable to FAK. Collectively, we not only indicated the involvement of Eps8 in colon tumor formation and progression but also revealed its effect on the expression and activity of FAK.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Lysate Preparation—Five human colon cancer cell lines (i.e. SW480, SW620, LS174T, WiDr, and HCT116) were used in this study. Cultured cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described previously (4Maa M.-C. Lai J.-R. Lin R.-W. Leu T.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas clinical specimens and tumors recovered from cancer cell-inoculated mice were prepared as described before (31Lee J.C. Maa M.-C. Yu H.-S. Wang J.-H. Yen C.-K. Wang S.-T. Chen Y.-J. Liu Y. Jin Y.-T. Leu T.-H. Mol. Carcinogr. 2005; 43: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Antibodies against Eps8 (C-Eps8) or FAK (CTF3) were described previously (4Maa M.-C. Lai J.-R. Lin R.-W. Leu T.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Leu T.-H. Maa M.-C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6992-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were actin, Eps8, FAK (A-17), Myc (9E10), and STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); Paxillin, Cas, and Shc (BD Transduction Laboratories); Pi-Y576 FAK and Pi-Y861 FAK (BIOSOURCE International); Pi-Y397 FAK, Src (GD11), Pi-Y416 Src, and Pi-Y317 Shc (Upstate); and Pi-Y527 Src, Pi-Y705 STAT3, Pi-S727 STAT3, Pi-T389 p70 S6K, p70 S6K, Pi-S2448 mTOR, mTOR, Pi-Y473 Akt, Akt, and cyclin D1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MD). Western immunoblots were performed as described previously (6Maa M.-C. Hsieh C.Y. Leu T.-H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The intensity of each detected band in clinical specimens was quantified by densitometry. For semiquantitation and comparison of the amount of the proteins of interest among the collected specimens, various amounts (0.5×, 1×, and 2×) of lysate of a specific patient with tremendous amounts of Src, Eps8, and FAK were included as a reference. After normalization, the relative expression of interested proteins in various samples can be determined.Tumorigenicity—Approximately 107 cells in 0.1 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline were injected subcutaneously into the hip of 4- to 6-week-old male nude mice (BALB/c-nu). Mice were checked every 2 or 3 days after 1-week inoculation, and the tumor formed was measured as described previously (6Maa M.-C. Hsieh C.Y. Leu T.-H.

The mouse experiments were performed according to the ethical guidelines for laboratory animal use and approved by the Institutional Animal Study Committee.Plasmid Construction and Cell Line Generation—Plasmid pCMV-Myc-Eps8 was described previously (6Maa M.-C. Hsieh C.Y. Leu T.-H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Plasmids pCMV-Myc-FAK and pCMV-Myc-FRNK were constructed by PCR amplification utilizing chicken fak or frnk cDNA (14Schaller M. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

The construction of eps8 siRNA expression construct, pS-hEps8 (5′-GAT CCC GCT GTG ATG CAT TCA TGC ATT CAA GAG ATG CAT GAA TGC ATC ACA GCT TTT TTG GAA A-3′), was similarly carried out as described previously (7Leu T.-H.

To generate control cells (Vec) and cells expressing Myc-FAK and/or Myc-Eps8, SW480 cells or SW620 cells expressing eps8 siRNA were transfected with pBabe (puro) alone or pBabe (puro) plus pCMV-Myc-FAK and/or pCMV-Myc-Eps8 followed by puromycin selection. To generate cells transiently expressing vector or dominant negative STAT3 (i.e. STAT3F), SW620 cells were transfected with pBabe (puro) alone or pBabe (pruo) and a plasmid encoding STAT3 Phe705 (35Yeh H.-H. Lai W.-W. Chen H.H.W. Liu H.-S. Su W.C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4300-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) followed by puromycin selection until they were used.Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)—The amount of fak and gapdh transcript was semiquantitated by RT-PCR as previously described (31Lee J.C. Maa M.-C. Yu H.-S. Wang J.-H. Yen C.-K. Wang S.-T. Chen Y.-J. Liu Y. Jin Y.-T. Leu T.-H. Mol. Carcinogr. 2005; 43: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For the measurement of eps8 transcript, a pair of its specific primers (sense strand, 5′-AAG TGA AAG ACA CAA TGA ATG GTC-3′; antisense strand, 5′-AGG TGT TTC TTC CTG CTC ATG ATA CTG-3′) was used in addition to gapdh specific primers in the reaction mixture. The PCR reaction was carried out in the same condition as fak (31Lee J.C. Maa M.-C. Yu H.-S. Wang J.-H. Yen C.-K. Wang S.-T. Chen Y.-J. Liu Y. Jin Y.-T. Leu T.-H. Mol. Carcinogr. 2005; 43: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Wound Healing Assay—Confluent cells were pretreated with 2 mm hydroxyurea for 24 h followed by scraping the cell layer with a 200-μl pipette tip to generate a wound. The dishes were incubated in fresh regular culture medium containing hydroxyurea (2 mm), and then 30 min later (0 h), three wounded areas in each dish were marked on the surface and photographed, and their wound closure was monitored by microscopy after 48 h. The wounded area was measured by using the AlphaImager™ (Alpha Innotech Corp.) imaging system.Statistic Analysis—Unless indicated, data are presented as means ± S.D. from a representative triplicate experiment. The significance of difference was assessed by using Student's t test. Bonferroni correction was used for controlling type I error in multiple comparisons.RESULTSEps8 Promotes Both Proliferation and Tumorigenesis in Human Colon Cancer Cells—Eps8 expression and cell proliferation of five human colon cancer cell lines (SW480, SW620, LS174T, WiDr, and HCT116) were analyzed. Notably, high Eps8 expressors (i.e. SW620, LS174T, and WiDr) tended to grow more rapidly than those with low Eps8 expression (i.e. SW480 and HCT116) (Fig. 1A). To verify that the amount of Eps8 did play a critical role in proliferation in colon cancer cells, plasmids expressing nonspecific siRNA or eps8-specific siRNA were introduced into SW620 and WiDr cells to obtain the corresponding Ctrl and siRNA cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, Eps8 attenuation resulted in a significant reduction in cellular growth in both cells. In contrast, ectopically expressed Eps8 in SW480 cells (Myc-Eps8-4 and Myc-Eps8–9) or Eps8-attenuated SW620 cells (siRNA-3) resulted in augmented proliferation (Figs. 1C and 4B). These results indicated the importance of Eps8 in mitogenesis of colon cancer cells. To corroborate the involvement of Eps8 in colon tumorigenesis, we observed that, relative to control, there was a significant (>50%) reduction of anchorage-independent growth in eps8 siRNA-expressing SW620 cells, and reintroduction of Eps8 rescued these defects (see Fig. 4, D and E). Consistently, Eps8 attenuation (or overexpression) can significantly reduce (or promote) the growth of tumors inoculated into nude mice (Fig. 2). However, we point out that the failure of SW480-derived Myc-Eps8-4 cells to elevate their in vivo tumorigenic ability to that of SW620 cells (Fig. 2) implicated that Eps8 was not the only determinant responsible for the low malignancy observed in SW480 cells.FIGURE 4Eps8 modulates the expression of FAK that is involved in proliferation of colon cancer cells. A, lysates (100 μg) of indicated cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies as indicated. B, SW620, Ctrl-1, siRNA-3, and siRNA-3 bearing vector (Vec) or Myc-Eps8 (Eps8) were described above. C, the generation of siRNA-1 cells (left) or siRNA-3 cells (right) harboring vector alone (Vec) or plasmid encoding Myc-FAK (FAK) were described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression of Eps8, FAK, and actin in these cells was determined by Western immunoblotting (top). Exogenous Myc-Eps8 and -FAK are marked with an asterisk and an arrow, respectively. For proliferation (bottom), see Fig. 1. D, for colony formation in soft agar, 3 × 103 cells of each cell line were applied in the top agar at the beginning, and the number of colonies (>8 cells) formed after 2-week incubation was counted and plotted. **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.

Because Eps8 interacts with Src SH3 in vitro (4Maa M.-C. Lai J.-R. Lin R.-W. Leu T.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), its overexpression might activate Src. To verify this point, the activity of Src in Eps8-attenuated SW620 cells was determined. As depicted in Fig. 3A, diminished Eps8 reduced the activity of Src, which was reflected by its decreased autophosphorylation on Tyr-416. In addition, ectopically expressed Eps8 restored its activation. Consistently, increased Src Pi-Tyr-527 (a negative regulator) and reduced Shc Pi-Tyr-317 (a Src substrate) were detected in eps8 siRNA cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, a significant reduction of serum-induced FAK activity (as reflected by Pi-Tyr-397 and Pi-Tyr-861) was detected in Eps8 knockdown cells as compared with control (Fig. 3, B and D). Similar results were also observed in WiDr cells (data not shown). To further verify this result, we performed a rescue experiment. Suppressed serum-induced FAK Pi-Tyr-397 and Pi-Tyr-861 was observed in siRNA-3 and siRNA-3/Vec cells, which could be recovered by the restored expression of Eps8 in siRNA-3 cells (Fig. 3, C and E). These findings indicated that Eps8 was able to increase Src activity and phosphorylation of FAK Tyr-397 and Tyr-861. It is worthy to note that, in addition to tyrosyl phosphorylation, the amount of FAK per se was also decreased in Eps8-attenuated cells (Fig. 3, B and C).FIGURE 3Eps8 increases Src activity, Shc Pi-Tyr-317, and serum-induced FAK Pi-Tyr-397 and Pi-Tyr-861. A, lysates (100 μg) prepared from SW620-based control cells (Ctrl-1 and -2), eps8 siRNA-expressing cells (siRNA-1, -2, and -3)(right), and Myc-tagged Eps8-reintroduced siRNA-3 cells (siRNA-3/Eps8)(left) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies as indicated. The relative amounts of Shc Pi-Tyr-317 and Shc were quantified by densitometer scanning, and their ratio is indicated at the bottom with Ctrl-1 given a value of 1.0. Serum-starved SW620-derived cells were stimulated without or with serum for 10 and 30 min. Lysates (100 μg) of each sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies as indicated (B and C). Densitometric quantification of FAK Pi-Tyr-397 and Pi-Tyr-861 of three separate experiments performed as described in panels B and C was normalized with FAK protein level and plotted as shown in panels D and E, respectively. For comparison, the value of Pi-Tyr-397/FAK and Pi-Tyr-861/FAK in 10-min treated Ctrl-1 (D) or SW620 (E) cells was arbitrarily given a value of 1.0. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Eps8 Modulates FAK Expression Required for Proliferation and Anchorage-independent Growth of Colorectal Cancer Cells—The intimate correlation of Eps8 and FAK observed in Fig. 3 (B and C) and the concomitant expression of these two proteins detected in Fig. 1A raised a possibility that the expression of FAK might be modulated by Eps8 or vice versa. To clarify this issue, the levels of FAK in high (SW620 and WiDr) and low (SW480) Eps8-expressing cells were examined. As shown in Fig. 4A, diminished Eps8 in SW620 cells markedly suppressed the expression of FAK but not that of Cas and paxillin. This attenuated Eps8-caused FAK reduction was also observed in WiDr cells. By contrast, Eps8 overexpression in SW480 cells could significantly augment FAK expression. Intriguingly, enhanced FAK did not affect the amount of Eps8 (Figs. 4C and 5). Because FAK has been implicated in proliferation and its expression was suppressed in cells with diminished Eps8 that exhibited a slower growth rate, we speculated that is was involved in Eps8-mediated proliferation. To answer this question, we measured bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in SW620 and WiDr cells harboring vector alone or DNA construct encoding dominant negative FAK (i.e. FRNK). We observed that FRNK could greatly suppress cell proliferation (data not shown). This confirmed the role of FAK in the mitogenic pathway of colon cancer cells. Furthermore, ectopically expressed FAK could alleviate the suppression of mitogenesis and colony-forming ability in soft agar of Eps8-attenuated SW620 cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Remarkably, both the number and size of colonies were increased in response to FAK overexpression (Fig. 4, D and E). To examine whether FAK overexpression alone could elicit cell growth of colon cancer cells in soft agar, SW480-based Eps8, or FAK single overexpressors as well as Eps8/FAK double overexpressors were generated. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, overexpression of Eps8, but not FAK, increased the ability of SW480 to form colonies in soft agar. In addition, a significantly increased number of colonies was detected in cells overexpressing Eps8 and FAK both. Thus, by up-regulating FAK, Eps8 could promote proliferation- and anchorage-independent growth in colon cancer cells.FIGURE 5Overexpression of FAK alone does not enhance cell growth of SW480 in soft agar. Lysates (100 μg) of SW480 and its derived cells (i.e. Vec, FAK-2, Eps/FAK-3, and Eps8–9) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotted with antibodies as indicated. Asterisks in the top panel indicate the ectopically expressed Myc-Eps8 or -FAK.

This was further confirmed by their partial co-localization in the punctate structures observed in confocal microscope (data not shown). Given that Eps8 is an actin capper and is able to increase Src and FAK activity, therefore, its involvement in colonocyte motility is speculated. Indeed, Eps8 attenuation resulted in decreased cell locomotion, and ectopically expressed FAK could rescue this effect (Fig. 6B). Because DNA synthesis was completely inhibited by hydroxyurea (2 mm), a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, present in the medium, the"

SCF(TrCP) recognizes the double phosphorylated DSGΦXS destruction motif in β-catenin and IκB. We show that the same ligase drives endocytosis and degradation of the growth hormone receptor (GHR) in a ligand-independent fashion. The F-box protein β-TrCP binds directly and specifically with its WD40 domain to a novel recognition motif, previously designated as the ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis motif. Receptor degradation requires an active neddylation system, implicating ubiquitin ligase activity. GHR-TrCP binding, but not GHR ubiquitination, is necessary for endocytosis. TrCP2 silencing is more effective on GHR degradation and endocytosis than TrCP1, although overexpression of either isoform restores TrCP function in silenced cells. Together, these findings provide direct evidence for a key role of the SCF(TrCP) in the endocytosis and degradation of an important factor in growth, immunity, and life span regulation.

Understanding how metabolism of cells and organisms is regulated and how this connects to the regulation of longevity, cell cycle, apoptosis, and immunity are major challenges of modern biology (1Sinclair D.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 987-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Growth hormone (GH) 2The abbreviations used are: GH, growth hormone; GHR, growth hormone receptor; UbE, ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; βTrCP, β-transducing repeat-containing protein. and its receptor (GHR) act at these crossroads as becomes apparent in the current study in which we show that a regulator of cell cycle and immunity appears to regulate GH sensitivity of cells. All cells of the human body contain GHRs. Upon GH binding, these receptors initiate signal transduction that results in expression of genes involved in anabolic processes, including increased protein synthesis, lipid degradation, immune function, muscle mass, bone turnover, and tooth development (2Waters M. The Growth Hormone Receptor. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 445-480Google Scholar). The GHR was the first class one cytokine receptor to be cloned (3Leung D.W. Spencer S.A. Cachianes G.

Signal transduction of class-one cytokine receptors recruits members of the Janus kinase family tyrosine kinases that bind to a proline-rich motif in the intracellular membrane-proximal domain, the box 1 motif (4Argetsinger L.S.

For the GHR, Jak2 acts as initiator of several signaling cascades, including Stat activation. Box 1-related activities contribute little to GHR endocytosis (5Alves dos Santos C.M. ten Broeke T. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32635-32641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For receptor tyrosine kinases, both signal transduction and receptor abundance are regulated by their ligands: epidermal growth factor, c-kit, insulin and Notch binding initiate not only signal transduction, they also induce a swift degradation of their receptors. For cytokine receptors, these two parameters seem to have their own independent regulating mechanism. There is good evidence that the GH sensitivity of cells is mainly regulated via the ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis motif (UbE motif) in the cytokine receptor box 2 region (6Strous G.J. dos Santos C.A. Gent J. Govers R. Sachse M. Schantl J. van Kerkhof P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 286: 81-118PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the UbE motif (DDSWVEFIELD) leads to a dramatic drop in endocytosis and lysosomal degradation, rendering the cells more GH-sensitive. The ubiquitin-proteasome system provides the major pathway for nonlysosomal degradation (reviewed in Ref. 7Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The F-box protein β-transducing repeat-containing protein (βTrCP) serves as the substrate recognition subunit in the SCF(βTrCP) ligase (8Winston J.T. Strack P. Beer-Romero P. Chu C.Y. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Classical examples of substrates are β-catenin, NFκB, and IκB (inhibitor of NFκB). Two isoforms exist; βTrCP1 is mainly present in the nucleus, whereas βTrCP2 resides in the cytosol (9Suzuki H. Chiba T. Kobayashi M. Takeuchi M. Suzuki T. Ichiyama A. Ikenoue T. Omata M. Furuichi K. Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These ligases play a pivotal role in cell division and various essential signal transduction pathways for tumorigenesis. Their substrate binding motifs consist of seven propeller-shaped WD40 domains that specifically bind short motifs in its central cavity. These motifs generally are 6 amino acid residues long with a common structure of DSGX2+nS. To be recognized by the SCF(βTrCP), both serine residues need to be phosphorylated. Recently, it became evident that, for a restricted number of plasma membrane proteins, ubiquitination triggers internalization and vacuolar/lysosomal rather than proteasomal degradation (reviewed in Ref. 10Traub L.M. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This pathway is best understood in yeast, where a number of plasma membrane proteins are endocytosed in an ubiquitin-dependent manner (11Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 12Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that monoubiquitination of plasma membrane proteins is sufficient to stimulate their endocytosis (11Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 13Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8143-8153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the GHR, the β-adrenergic receptor, and the epithelial sodium channel, ENaC, are examples of membrane proteins that endocytose in an ubiquitin system-dependent manner (14Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 15Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D.

In some cytokine receptors, the conserved DSGX2+nS motif serves as a degradation signal via the SCF(βTrCP) ligases. Both for the interferon-γ and the PrL receptor, it was shown that this E3 is involved in their degradation. An important finding in these studies was that receptor degradation mainly depends on ligand binding; in addition, phosphorylation at both serine residues of the degron was required (17Kumar K.G.

In the present study, we show that the UbE motif, deviant from the canonical βTrCP recognition motif, is specifically recognized by a functional SCF(βTrCP) complex and that this interaction is instrumental in the endocytosis and degradation of the GHR. Ubiquitination of the GHR is not required, since βTrCP silencing slows degradation of the GHR without lysine residues in the cytosolic tail as efficiently as wild type GHR.

Full-length rabbit GHR cDNA in pcDNA3 was described (20Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins expressing GST-GHR-(271-334), and GST-GHR-(271-318) were produced as described (21Schantl J.A. Roza M. de Jong A.P. Strous G.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). pcDNA-GHR constructs used for alanine scanning of the UbE motif and GHR-(1-399), K271-362R, designated as GHR399-KallR, were constructed as described before (22Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The following siRNA sense sequences were used to silence the following: both βTrCP1 and -2, GUGGAAUUUGUGGAACAUCtt (called “combi probe”); βTrCP1 only, GAUAAUACCAGAGAAGAAUtt; βTrCP2 only, GAGGCCAUCAGAAGGAAACtt; clathrin heavy chain, GCAAUGAGCUGUUUGAAGAUU; GFP and HPV E6/E7 (used as controls), GGCUACGUCCAGGAGCGCACC and CUAACUAACACUGGGUUAUtt, respectively. Dharmacon siGENOME SMARTpool's BTRC NM-003939 was used to silence βTrCP1, and FBXW11 (NM-012300) was used to silence βTrCP2. QuikChange mutagenesis primers to introduce three silent mutations in the target sequence of βTrCP1 for combi TrCP, 5′-TGGTCAGAGTCAGATCAAGTGGAGTTCGTCGAACATCTTATATCCCAAATGTG-3′, and to introduce three silent mutations in the target sequence of TrCP2 for combi βTrCP, 5′-TGGTCTGAATCAGATCAAGTGGAGTTCGTCGAACATCTTATTTCACGAATGTG-3′. Chemically synthesized siRNA duplexes were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Antibody, recognizing the cytoplasmic domain of the GHR, was raised against amino acids 271-318 of the cytosolic tail of the GHR (23van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Alves dosSantos C.M.A. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Antibody (mAb 5) against the extracellular domain of the GHR was from Agen (Acacia Ridge, Australia), goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa680 was from Molecular Probes, Inc., and goat anti-rabbit IgG IRDye800 was from Rockland Immunochemicals Inc. (Gilbertsville, PA). Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2) was from Sigma. The polyclonal anti-βTrCP1 serum was raised in rabbits against a βTrCP1 peptide consisting of amino acids 1-93 fused to glutathione S-transferase. The fusion protein was produced by cloning the DNA encoding amino acids 1-93 of TrCP1 into vector pGEX1λt, after which the construct was expressed in Escherichia coli. Immobilized streptavidin was from Pierce, glutathione-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences, and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from Qiagen. Culture media, fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics for tissue culture were purchased from Invitrogen. Cell Culture—Hek293 and ts41 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Hek293 cells stably expressing the wild type GHR (Hek-wtGHR) were grown in the same medium supplemented with 0.6 mg/ml Geneticin (G418; Invitrogen). All cells used were grown at 37 °C with 5.0% CO2. Twice a week, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), detached from the flask with trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen), diluted in fresh growth medium, and split into new culture flasks. Transfections—Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Seventy percent confluent cultures were transfected with 0.2-0.9 μg of DNA in 12-well plates according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were used for Western blot experiments and 125I-GH binding experiments 1-2 days after transfection. For fluorescence microscopy cells were transfected with Fugene-6 (Roche Applied Science). To silence the expression of both βTrCPs, Hek-wtGHR cells were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the description of the manufacturer; 3 days after transfection, cells were used for Western blot and 125I-GH binding experiments. Control cells were transfected with siRNA-GFP. To control the effect of the gene expression silencing, Hek293 cells were transiently transfected with a pcDNA3-FLAG-βTrCP. Western blots were analyzed using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). 125I-GH Binding and Internalization—125I-Human GH was prepared using chloramine T (20Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). For internalization experiments, cells, grown in poly-d-lysine-coated 12-well plates, were washed with 1 ml of minimal essential medium supplemented with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated at 37 °C in a water bath for 1 h. After washing the cells three times with ice-cold PBS-complete (PBS-c: PBS with 0.135 g/liter CaCl2 and 0.1 g/liter MgCl2), 0.75 ml 125I-GH (180 ng/ml in Mem/Hepes/0.1% bovine serum albumin) was added to the cells. 125I-GH was bound for 2 h on ice. Unbound 125I-GH was aspirated and the cells were washed three times with PBS-c. Cells were incubated 10 min at 37 °C in minimal essential medium, Hepes, 0.1% bovine serum albumin to allow receptor internalization and washed three times with ice-cold PBS-c. Membrane associated 125I-GH was removed by treating the cells twice with 750 μl acid wash (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm glycine, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 2.5) for 5 min on ice. Acid wash was collected in counting tubes, and radioactivity was measured using a LKB γ counter. Cells were solubilized overnight in 1 n NaOH. Internalized 125I-GH was determined by measuring the radioactivity in the collected NaOH. Unspecific counts were determined by incubating the cells with 125I-GH together with excess unlabeled GH (9 μg/ml). Internalization is expressed as a percentage of the total specific radioactivity after 10 min at 37 °C. In Vitro Binding Assay—Wild-type and mutant GHR proteins were expressed in Hek293, and the cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 or 1.0 m NaCl, 50 mm NaF, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The receptors were purified with biotinylated GH and streptavidin beads and stringently washed with lysis buffer. The beads were incubated with in vitro translated and 35S-labeled βTrCP2 for 60 min at 4 °C and extensively washed with lysis buffer, and associated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. cDNA of βTrCP2 constructs in pcDNA3.1/FLAG was used in an in vitro transcription translation system supplemented with [35S]methionine and TNT®-T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate ready reaction mix according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). Binding to GHR-(1-286) was taken as background. To analyze GHR-containing protein complexes at the cell surface, the cells were incubated with biotinylated GH on ice. To recover all GHR-protein complexes from cells, the cells were first lysed and then incubated with biotinylated GH. Equal amounts of cell lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with equal amounts of GST-GHR-(271-334) or GST-GHR-(271-286) bound to GSH beads. Beads were pelleted in an Eppendorf centrifuge and washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and twice with PBS containing protease inhibitors. The beads were boiled in 2× sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins associated with the GST fusion proteins were visualized by autoradiography. To analyze equal loading of the fusion proteins, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brillant Blue and analyzed using an Odyssey imaging system. Production of GST-GHR Fusion Proteins—pGEX-GHR plasmids were used to express GST-GHR fusion proteins in E. coli (strain BL21) (21Schantl J.A. Roza M. de Jong A.P. Strous G.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The synthesis of recombinant proteins was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. GST fusion proteins were purified with GSH-beads (Amersham Biosciences) by the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Immune Fluorescence Microscopy—Cy3-GH was prepared using a Fluorolink-Cy3 label kit according to the supplier's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Transfected cells, grown on coverslips, were incubated for 15 min with Cy3-GH (1 μg/ml) and/or Alexa488-labeled transferrin (5 μg/ml). Cells were washed with PBS to remove unbound label and fixed for 2 h in 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. After fixation, the cells were embedded in Mowiol, and confocal laser-scanning microscopy was performed using a Leica TCS 4D system. Expression of βTrCP Is Required for GHR Endocytosis—Endocytosis of the GHR depends on the ubiquitination machinery, implicating the involvement of an ubiquitin ligase. Since recent studies show that βTrCP is involved in the degradation of certain cytokine receptors, we used small interfering RNA to silence both βTrCP isoforms and study the effects on GHR turnover. Fig. 1A shows that siRNA for βTrCP inhibits GH uptake to the same extent as silencing of clathrin heavy chain: ∼50% as compared with nonrelevant siRNA(GFP). In this experiment, the clathrin heavy chain Western blot signal was reduced to 4% compared with siRNA(GFP)-treated cells. Expression of co-transfected FLAG-tagged βTrCP2 was reduced to 10% using the “combi” silencing oligonucleotides that silence both TrCP1 and TrCP2 (Fig. 1B). We conclude that βTrCP is involved in endocytosis of the GHR. At steady state, almost all (mature, 130-kDa) GHRs are present at the cell surface. To visualize the effect of βTrCP silencing on endocytosis, we incubated the cells with both Cy3-labeled GH and Alexa-488-labeled transferrin. Fig. 1C shows that silencing both βTrCP isoforms resulted in a strong increase of Cy3-GH at the plasma membrane, whereas transferrin recycling remained intact, excluding a general effect on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These results demonstrate that βTrCP is an obligatory part of the GHR endocytosis machinery. Since both GH and transferrin are endocytosed via clathrin-coated vesicles (24van Kerkhof P. Sachse M. Klumperman J. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 3778-3784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it suggests that βTrCP is part of the cargo selection complex for the GHR. An obvious consequence of endocytosis inhibition is an accumulation of GHRs at the cell surface. In Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2, we used Hek293 cells transfected with GHR DNA and silenced for both βTrCP isoforms. To measure the amount of GHRs at the cell surface, the cells were incubated with biotin-GH, and the GH-GHR complexes were isolated and quantitated. siRNA(βTrCP) treatment caused a 2-3-fold increase in GHR at the cell surface. To ascertain that the increase was not due to a silencing effect on the amount GHRs synthesized, metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine was performed and showed that the GHR synthesis was not changed (not shown). The cellular concentration of βTrCP1 was measured on Western blots (Fig. 1D). By this method, using an optimized protocol for βTrCP, we obtained ∼90% silencing. Using this silencing oligonucleotide, βTrCP2 was silenced to the same extent (Fig. 1B). Previous studies have shown that by inhibiting GHR endocytosis through (mutation of) the UbE motif, maximally 60% inhibition of GHR endocytosis was achieved compared with removal of the GHR tail, including the complete UbE motif. Apparently, both βTrCP and clathrin silencing were insufficient to overcome this half-maximal effect on GHR turnover. Combining the two siRNAs did not result in more endocytosis inhibition. In agreement with our previous experience, these effects are too limited to measure half-life differences in dynamic experiments successfully (e.g. using pulse-chase protocols) (21Schantl J.A. Roza M. de Jong A.P. Strous G.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As an important control, based on our previous observations that the GHR itself is not an obligatory ubiquitination target, we used a GHR truncated at amino acid residue 399, in which all 10 lysines are replaced by arginine residues (GHR-(1-399) K271-362R) (22Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Fig. 1D, lanes 3-6, shows that TrCP silencing induces a 2-3-fold increase in cell surface GHRs whether or not lysine residues are present in the receptor tail. To control the experiments of Fig. 1D for equal transfection efficiencies, we co-transfected GFP DNA in all situations and analyzed the cell lysates for GFP; under all (silencing) conditions and various DNA constructs, the transfection efficiency was identical within measurement limits (Fig. 1D, bottom). Since we previously concluded that GHR internalization requires the recruitment of the ubiquitin conjugation system to the GHR UbE motif rather than the conjugation of ubiquitin to the GHR itself, we now conclude that βTrCP is a prime candidate to act as E3. Other Factors of the βTrCP-GHR Complex—Once we established that βTrCP is involved in GHR endocytosis and degradation, we asked whether βTrCP is in a protein complex with the GHR. Pull-down experiments with biotin-GH, depicted in Fig. 2A, show that both co-expressed full-length (lane 4) and mutant TrCP without the F-box domain (lane 5) were present in the isolated complexes. If His6-TrCP1 was used to isolate the protein complex (Fig. 2B), both ER and cell surface GHR were pulled down (lane 4). The interaction occurs intracellularly, as shown in an experiment in which GHR and His6-TrCP1 were expressed in different plates (lanes 1 and 5) and mixed after cell lysis (lane 3). Under these conditions (low cellular concentrations, low temperature, and short time periods) βTrCP does not interact with GHR. Thus, TrCP is in a protein complex with GHR, probably already in the ER. βTrCP generally acts as subunit of a SCF ubiquitin ligase. To examine the functional complex in GHR endocytosis, we co-transfected βTrCP2 and Skp1 together with the GHR. Pull-down experiments with biotinylated GH and Western blot analysis of the isolated complex revealed that Skp1 interacted with GHR only in the presence of βTrCP (Fig. 2A, lane 4). In the absence of βTrCP (lane 6) or in the presence of βTrCP lacking the F-box (lane 5), no Skp1 was isolated. In lanes 10 and 11, we repeated the experiment and asked whether Skp1 might have associated with the GHR protein complex after lysis. As for βTrCP, the interaction does not occur if cell lysates from cells, expressing the components separately, were mixed (M). Together, this implies that GH, GHR, TrCP2, and Skp1 are in the same protein complex. To analyze the involvement of an active SCF complex, we took a genetic approach and expressed GHR in hamster ts41 cells. These cells contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in the NEDD8 activation enzyme, APP-BP1, and fail to degrade substrates via E3s with Cullin family members (e.g. p27 via the SCF(skp2) (25Ohh M. Kim W.Y. Moslehi J.J. Chen Y. Chau V. Read M.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), due to defective neddylation. Thus, the E3-SCF(TrCP) is itself regulated via covalent modification of the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 by UBC12, whereas deneddylation is performed by the signalosome complex. This modification stabilizes the E2-Cullin/Rbx1 interaction and in turn stimulates ubiquitination of the target substrates. Fig. 2C shows that Cy3-GH is endocytosed at the permissive temperature but largely remains at the cell surface at the nonpermissive temperature (39 °C). In the same experiment, Alexa488-labeled transferrin entered the cells undisturbed, although there seemed to be a different distribution intracellularly. This shows that an intact neddylation system is specifically required for uptake of the GHR. Together with the results on βTrCP and Skp1, these data strongly suggest that GHR endocytosis requires a fully functional SCF(βTrCP) complex. βTrCP Interacts with the GHR Tail via the UbE Motif—To further examine the role of βTrCP in GHR endocytosis, we analyzed βTrCP2, since it is dominantly active in the cytosol (26Sadot E. Simcha I. Iwai K. Ciechanover A. Geiger B. Ben-Ze'ev A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1992-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Hek293 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged βTrCP2 together with GHR or the truncation GHR-(1-286) (Fig. 3A). GHR-(1-286) still contains box 1, the attachment site for Jak2, but lacks the UbE motif. This receptor is unable to endocytose and, therefore, accumulates at the cell surface, resulting in a high amount of mature receptor (55 kDa) compared with its 40-kDa ER form (Fig. 3B, left, lane 2). The wild-type GHR migrates at 130 kDa, whereas its precursor ER form appears as a doublet at 110 kDa (lane 1). Cell lysates were incubated with biotinylated GH, and GHR protein complexes were isolated with streptavidin beads. Comparing the full-length GHR with GHR truncated at 286 shows that co-transfected FLAG-labeled βTrCP2 was only isolated if full-length GHR was present (Fig. 3B, left, lanes 3 and 4). In Fig. 3B, right, we used various GHR truncations and mutations to pinpoint the tail segment involved in βTrCP binding. The receptors were purified from transiently transfected Hek293 cells, via biotinylated GH and streptavidin beads, and then incubated on ice with equal amounts of in vitro synthesized 35S-labeled βTrCP. Wild-type GHR and GHR truncated at 434, 369, or 334 bound ∼16% of the input 35S-labeled TrCP. GHRs truncated at 330, 326, and 286 as well as the UbE mutants GHR-D331A and GHR-F327A showed little binding. Mutation of the serine residues in the DSGRTS motif of the full-length GHR (GHR-S366,370A) did not affect the GHR-SCF(TrCP) interaction (Fig. 3B, right, lane 8). Similar UbE Motif Specificity for GHR-βTrCP2 Interaction and GHR Endocytosis—Previously, we have shown that endocytosis of the GHR depends both on a functional ubiquitination system and on an intact UbE motif (20Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 27Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4851-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28van Kerkhof P. Smeets M. Strous G.J. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Using mutational analysis of the UbE motif by changing every single amino acid residue into alanine, the contribution of each amino acid was determined. The experiment identified the key residues in the UbE motif (DDSWVEFIELD) for endocytosis. As shown in Fig. 1, βTrCP is an obvious factor to act as a regulator of GHR endocytosis. Therefore, we used the pull-down assay of Fig. 3B (right) to ask whether βTrCP binds to the GHR in a specific fashion. Each of the amino acids 320-334 were changed in alanine residues, and the 15 GHR constructs were tested in Hek293 cells. The cells were transfected with equal amounts of the different constructs and showed comparable GHR expression judged by the amounts of high mannose (ER-localized) GHR (not shown). Western blot analysis of the cell extracts shows that the mutations E326A, F327A, I328A, and D331A caused a significant increase in mature (130-kDa) GHR (Fig. 4A), indicative of impaired degradation. Biotin-GH was used to isolate the GH-GHR complexes from the cell surface, and the GHRs were incubated with equal amounts of 35S-labeled βTrCP. Most mutations resulted in inhibition of βTrCP binding as compared with wild-type GHR. However, mutation of the same 4 amino acids inhibited the βTrCP binding more than 60% (Fig. 4B). Compared with the mutational analysis previously performed for endocytosis (see Fig. 4C and Fig. 4 in Ref. 22Govers R. ten Broeke T. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we note a striking similarity in patterns; the same 4 amino acid are important for endocytosis of the GHR (27Govers R. van Kerkhof P.

https://openalex.org/W2061829977,"The major protein component in secreted very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) is apoB, and it is established that these particles can reach sizes approaching 100 nm. We previously employed a cell-free system to investigate the nature of the vesicles in which this large cargo exits the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Gusarova, V., Brodsky, J. L., and Fisher, E. A. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 48051–48058). We found that apoB-containing lipoproteins exit the ER as dense lipid-protein complexes regardless of the final sizes of the particles and that further expansion occurs via post-ER lipidation. Here, we focused on maturation in the Golgi apparatus. In three separate approaches, we found that VLDL maturation (as assessed by changes in buoyant density) was associated with conformational changes in apoB. In addition, as the size of VLDL expanded, apoE concentrated in a subclass of Golgi microsomes or Golgi-derived vesicles that co-migrated with apoB-containing microsomes or vesicles, respectively. A relationship between apoB and apoE was further confirmed in co-localization studies by immunoelectron microscopy. These combined results are consistent with previous suggestions that apoE is required for VLDL maturation. To our surprise, however, we observed robust secretion of mature VLDL when apoE synthesis was inhibited in either rat hepatoma cells or apoE–/– mouse primary hepatocytes. We conclude that VLDL maturation in the Golgi involves apoB conformational changes and that the expansion of the lipoprotein does not require apoE; rather, the increase in VLDL surface area favors apoE binding.

Very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) 2The abbreviations used are: VLDL, very low density lipoprotein(s); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; siRNA, small interfering RNA; BSA, bovine serum albumin; OA, oleic acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); apoB, apolipoprotein B100; McA, McArdle-RH7777. transport endogenously synthesized lipids, particularly cholesteryl esters and triglyceride, from the liver to peripheral tissues (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). VLDL assembly is a complex process that consists of at least two steps. In the first step, during its translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, nascent apolipoprotein B100 (apoB) associates with lipids provided by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. This results in the formation of incompletely lipidated “primordial” pre-VLDL particles. In the second step, additional lipid (primarily triglyceride) and other apolipoproteins (e.g. apoE) are added, resulting in the formation of mature, fully lipidated VLDL particles (2Olofsson S.O. Boren J. J. Intern. Med. 2005; 258: 395-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Although it is established that the first step of VLDL assembly occurs in the ER, the location of the additional step(s) during VLDL maturation is less clear. For example, a number of studies have suggested that the ER is the final site of VLDL maturation (e.g. Refs. 3Alexander C.A. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J.

To better distinguish between these models, we previously employed a cell-free system in which the budding of ER-derived, apoB-containing vesicles was reconstituted (13Gusarova V. Brodsky J.L.

In addition to showing that the transport of apoB from the ER is dependent on Sar1, a required factor for COPII secretory vesicle formation, we obtained preliminary evidence that lipids are added to the pre-VLDL species after ER exit. Based on our previous evidence, a major goal of this study was to firmly establish the Golgi as the site of VLDL maturation. Another important goal was to study the requirement for apoE in the full lipidation of VLDL. Although apoE has been well characterized as a factor required for the clearance of VLDL from plasma, there are also studies that have implicated apoE in the assembly or secretion of fully lipidated VLDL (14Kuipers F. Jong M.C. Lin Y. Eck M. Havinga R. Bloks V. Verkade H.J. Hofker M.H. Moshage H. Berkel T.J. Vonk R.J. Havekes L.M. J. Clin.

Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1673-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the observation that a fraction of apoE associates with VLDL within the secretory pathway (18Fazio S. Yao Z. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), including secretory vesicles emerging from the Golgi (19Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Guo L.S. Krisans S. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1589-1603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To address the issues of the site of VLDL maturation and the role of apoE in this process, we have again employed a cell-free system but have supplemented the data with results from immunoelectron microscopy, apoE-deficient primary hepatocytes, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) apoE “knockdown” experiments in rat hepatoma cells. Taken together, our results indicate that the Golgi represents the site of VLDL maturation and that the process of lipid addition to pre-VLDL is associated with apoB conformational changes. Furthermore, we found that neither the assembly nor secretion of mature VLDL requires apoE. Materials—Rabbit anti-rat apoE and rabbit anti-rat apoB antisera were provided by Dr. Janet Sparks (University of Rochester School of Medicine). The following antisera and antibodies were purchased from the indicated companies: goat anti-rat apoE antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-rat albumin antiserum (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, TX), mouse anti-mannosidase II antibody (Covance, Princeton, NJ), rabbit anti-calnexin antibody (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada), mouse anti-β-COP antibody (Sigma), and mouse anti-syntaxin 6 antibody (Pharmingen). Protein A-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell culture media and related supplies were purchased from Invitrogen and Cellgro (Herndon, VA). Protease inhibitor mixture tablets were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Cell Culture—Until their experimental use, rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells (referred to below as McA cells) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was changed every 3 days. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation under denaturing and nondenaturing conditions and Western blotting were performed as described previously (13Gusarova V. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48051-48058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cytosol and Microsomal Membranes—Rat liver cytosol was prepared as described (13Gusarova V. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48051-48058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). ER and Golgi membranes (microsomes) were purified by subcellular fractionation as follows. McA cells were grown on four 100-mm tissue culture dishes and preincubated in low serum medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 0.5% (v/v) horse serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 16 h. Cells were further incubated for 2 h in the same medium with either bovine serum albumin (BSA; 0.13 mm; hereafter referred to as the “–OA” condition, i.e. without exogenous oleic acid) or, to stimulate triglyceride synthesis, with OA/BSA (0.8 mm OA complexed to 0.13 mm BSA; “+OA” condition). The cells were then metabolically labeled for 3 h by the addition of Express 35S protein labeling mixture (100 μCi/ml per dish; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence or absence of OA in Cys/Met-free medium. Next, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 2.5 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture, and 20 units/ml RNase inhibitor). Additional ER and Golgi membranes (microsomes) were homogenized and purified as described (13Gusarova V. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48051-48058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The gradient distribution patterns of the subcellular compartment markers were assayed either enzymatically (for mannosidase II, a Golgi marker) or by Western blotting (for calnexin, an ER marker, and syntaxin 6, a trans-Golgi network marker) (20Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The fractions containing the appropriate markers were then pooled to provide either ER or Golgi microsomes for experimental use. Cell-free Generation of ER- or Golgi-derived Vesicles—In vitro ER vesicle budding assays were performed as described (13Gusarova V. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48051-48058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and in vitro Golgi budding assays were performed as described (21Heimann K. Percival J.M. Weinberger R. Gunning P. Stow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10743-10750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, Golgi membranes (200 μg) were preincubated with 0.1 mm GTPγS for 5 min at 37 °C. Rat liver cytosol (14 mg of protein), supplemented with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and an ATP-regenerating system (4.6 IU/ml creatine phosphokinase, 81 mm creatine phosphate, and 28.6 mm ATP), was added, and the total volume was adjusted to 2 ml with HKM buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 20 mm KCl, and 2.5 mm magnesium acetate). This reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and was terminated by incubation for 10 min in an ice-water slurry. The remnant (unbudded) Golgi cisternae were separated from the vesicles by differential centrifugation at 17,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Density Gradient Fractionation of Golgi-derived Vesicles—After separation from the membranes (see above), Golgi-derived vesicles were separated from the cytosol by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The tube contained a cushion of 200 μl of 2.1 m sucrose overlaid with 200 μl of 20% (w/w) sucrose and 1.8 ml of the cytosol/vesicle mixture (21Heimann K. Percival J.M. Weinberger R. Gunning P. Stow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10743-10750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). All sucrose solutions were prepared in HKM buffer. The cytosol was collected from the loading zone, and the budded vesicles were harvested at the 2.1 m (20%, w/w) sucrose interface. To further fractionate vesicles, the material collected from the interface was resuspended in a total volume of 400 μl of 20% sucrose and layered onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 300 μl of each of the following sucrose solutions: 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, and 25% (w/w) (21Heimann K. Percival J.M. Weinberger R. Gunning P. Stow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10743-10750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The tubes were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. Fractions of 220 μl each were collected from the top of the gradient. Next, apoB and apoE were immunoprecipitated from each fraction with rabbit anti-rat apoB and apoE antisera. To determine the distributions of albumin, the remainder of each fraction was centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C ina Beckman TLA100 rotor; pellets were resuspended in sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% β-mercaptoethanol, and 2.5% bromphenol blue); and Western blot analyses were performed using rabbit anti-rat albumin antiserum. Isolation of Luminal Contents of ER-derived Vesicles and Golgi Microsomes and Sucrose Gradient Separation of ApoB-containing Lipoproteins—Luminal contents were released from microsomes and vesicles by treatment with 0.1 m sodium carbonate (pH 11) and 0.025% deoxycholate as described (13Gusarova V. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48051-48058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J.

The supernatants containing the released lipoproteins were recovered by centrifugation at 60,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100.4 rotor. Lipoproteins were separated according to density by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient (13Gusarova V. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48051-48058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Boren J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, the densities of VLDL1 and VLDL2 particle subpopulations were resolved by ultracentrifugation according to Wang et al. (24Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Nondenaturing Immunoisolation of ER-derived Vesicles and Golgi Microsomes containing ApoB—ER-derived vesicles and Golgi microsomes (obtained as described above) were immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions (in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 2% BSA with rabbit anti-rat apoB antiserum/protein A-Sepharose beads) to preserve the exposure of apoB domains to the cytosol (13Gusarova V. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48051-48058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The supernatant of the immunoprecipitation was reserved; the protein A beads were washed; and the immunoprecipitate was released with NET buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) containing final concentrations of 2% SDS and 1% Triton X-100. The released material was re-immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions in NET buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. ApoB was also immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions from the reserved supernatant. The resulting samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the content of radiolabeled apoB was displayed by fluorography. Protease Susceptibility Studies—To probe the conformation of apoB in either liberated vesicles or microsomes, protease susceptibility assays were performed. Briefly, vesicles or microsomes from radiolabeled McA cells were treated with trypsin at a final concentration 0.1 mg/ml as described (25Gusarova V. Caplan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24891-24900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ApoB was then immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-rat apoB antiserum under denaturing conditions. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and their apoB content was displayed by fluorography. Immunoelectron Microscopy—For immunoelectron microscopy, a subconfluent population of McA cells was washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then removed by gentle scraping with the edge of a razor blade and pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellet was fixed in gelatin and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in a solution containing 20% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1.6 m sucrose, and 55 mm sodium carbonate buffered in phosphate-buffered saline. The embedded cells were frozen, sectioned, and stained essentially as described (26Sullivan M.L. Youker R.T. Watkins S.C. Brodsky J.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-rat apoB antiserum and goat anti-rat apoE antibody were used at dilutions of 1:200 and 1:100, respectively, and visualized using 10- and 4-nm diameter gold particles conjugated to anti-rabbit and anti-goat antibodies, respectively. Inhibition of ApoE Expression by siRNA—Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) was used to transfect McA cells with 10 nm apoE siRNA (catalog no. 16708A, ID 199680, Ambion, Inc.) or 10 nm negative control siRNA-1 (catalog no. 4639) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. After transfection, cells were preincubated in low serum medium in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 16 h and treated with OA (0.8 mm) for 2 h in the same medium. Cells were then labeled with Express 35S protein labeling mixture for 3 h (100 μCi/ml per dish) in the presence of OA in Cys/Met-free medium. The medium was collected; cells were homogenized; and the Golgi microsomes were isolated by subcellular fractionation as described above. Sucrose density gradient separations of the conditioned medium and the luminal contents of the Golgi microsomes were performed as described (24Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Studies of VLDL Secretion from Mouse Primary Hepatocytes—Male C57BL/6 mice and apoE-deficient mice on the C57BL/6 background were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All animals were kept on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and were provided with water and a standard mouse chow diet ad libitum. Hepatocytes were isolated from mouse livers (14–17 weeks old) by a modification of the hepatic portal perfusion described by Klaunig et al. (27Klaunig J.E. Goldblatt P.J. Hinton D.E. Lipsky M.M. Chacko J. Trump B.F. In Vitro. 1981; 17: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Briefly, the portal vein was cannulated, and the liver was perfused at a rate of 4 ml/min with a calcium- and magnesium-free buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 143 mm NaCl, 7 mm KCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA) and then a collagenase solution (100 units/ml collagenase IV; Sigma). Hepatocytes released from the liver capsule were isolated by two rounds of centrifugation at 50 × g for 3 min. Cells were plated onto 100-mm dishes precoated with collagen (Sigma) at a density of 3 × 106 cells/dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% horse serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.2% BSA, 0.6 mm OA/BSA, 0.1 nm insulin (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After a 2-h attachment period, the medium was changed to Met/Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Express 35S protein labeling mixture (200 μCi/ml). To prevent re-uptake of newly secreted VLDL, 10 mg/ml heparin (Sigma) was also added (28Fisher E.A. Pan M. Chen X. Wu X. Wang H. Jamil H. Sparks J.D. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27855-27863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). After 3 h of metabolic labeling, the medium was collected; apoB-containing lipoproteins were separated by a KBr/NaBr step density gradient ultracentrifugation (24Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); and these species were isolated by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE as described above. For quantification of apoB contents in each density fraction, gel bands were excised and assayed by scintillation counting as described previously (29Wang H. Chen X. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 1380-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To ascertain the relationship between the triglyceride and apoB contents of the VLDL1 and VLDL2 density fractions, both Expre35S35S protein labeling mixture (200 μCi/ml) and [3H]glycerol (5 μCi/ml) were used for metabolic labeling of primary hepatocytes. In addition to the procedures described above used to assay apoB contents, aliquots of the VLDL fractions were taken to isolate radiolabeled triglycerides by extraction with Dole's solvent, as we have done before (30Kummrow E. Hussain M.M. Pan M. Marsh J.B. Fisher E.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2155-2163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The ratio of the cpm of triglyceride to apoB was then calculated for each VLDL subfraction (VLDL1 and VLDL2). Stimulation of Triglyceride Synthesis Increases the Content of VLDL-associated ApoB in Golgi Microsomes—In our previous study (13Gusarova V. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48051-48058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we employed a cell-free system and inferred that apoB is not fully lipidated in the ER because pre-VLDL density particles are found in ER-derived secretory vesicles. To investigate the mechanism of post-ER VLDL maturation in greater detail, we chose to characterize Golgi microsomes isolated from metabolically labeled McA cells that were treated in the presence or absence of OA, a standard inducer of triglyceride synthesis and VLDL lipidation. Notably, the isolated Golgi microsomes exhibited low contamination with ER membranes (1.7% based on organelle-specific marker assays; see “Experimental Procedures”). The Golgi microsomes were treated with sodium carbonate and deoxycholate (22Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 23Boren J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to release apoB-containing lipoproteins that were either completely luminal or associated with the inner leaflet of the membrane. The released material was then separated on sucrose density gradients, and the apoB content of each fraction was determined by immunoprecipitation/SDS-PAGE/fluorography. As shown in Fig. 1, the content of apoB in the VLDL fraction (d < 1.005) in Golgi microsomes increased ∼5-fold when cells were treated with OA. Conformational Changes in ApoB in Golgi Microsomes Are Associated with VLDL Maturation—Although apoB does not have a classical transmembrane segment, we reported previously that it has a domain(s) exposed in ER-derived vesicles (13Gusarova V. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48051-48058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To determine whether apoB also exposes a domain in Golgi microsomes, the apoB-containing ER and Golgi vesicles were incubated with trypsin, and the loss of full-length apoB was assessed by immunoprecipitation/SDS-PAGE/fluorography. As shown in Fig. 2A (left panels) and consistent with our previous study (13Gusarova V. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48051-48058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) ∼90% of apoB in ER-derived vesicles was susceptible to protease attack independent of the stimulation of triglyceride synthesis, indicating cytosolic domain exposure. In contrast to the results for the ER-derived vesicles, a significant fraction (43.8 ± 6.2%, n = 3) of apoB associated with Golgi microsomes was protected from trypsin (Fig. 2A, right panels). This effect was observed even in the absence of OA, which supports the maturation of some VLDL in McA cells under basal metabolic conditions (e.g. Refs. 13Gusarova V. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48051-48058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar and 28Fisher E.A. Pan M. Chen X. Wu X. Wang H. Jamil H. Sparks J.D. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27855-27863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Notably, the fraction of protected apoB rose to 71 ± 3.6% (n = 3) when maximal VLDL lipidation had been stimulated by OA treatment. The results suggest that apoB undergoes conformational changes during VLDL maturation in the Golgi. To demonstrate this phenomenon by an independent approach, we performed sequential immunoprecipitation analyses of ER-derived vesicles and Golgi microsomes under nondenaturing and denaturing conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 2B (left panels) and again in agreement with our previous results (13Gusarova V. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48051-48058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), after the first (nondenaturing) immunoprecipitation from ER-derived vesicles, apoB was largely depleted from the supernatant independent of the stimulation of triglyceride synthesis by OA. Indeed, densitometric analyses of the fluorograms revealed that only 5.9 ± 1.1% (n = 3; –OA) and 31.1 ± 4.2% (n = 3; +OA) of apoB remained in the supernatant, consistent with significant apoB domain exposure to the cytosol in ER-derived vesicles. In contrast, substantial amounts of apoB were found in the supernatant fractions in Golgi microsomes: 56.3 ± 3.8% (n = 3) under basal VLDL-forming conditions (–OA) and 76 ± 6.9% (n = 3) under conditions that support maximal lipidation (+OA). These data imply that apoB domain exposure in Golgi microsomes is, in general, less than that in the ER-derived vesicles and is inversely related to the proportion of VLDL that is fully lipidated. Given that apoB conformational changes correlated with the VLDL maturation process in the Golgi, we predicted that the microsomal content of immature apoB-containing lipoproteins (i.e. pre-VLDL or high density lipoprotein density) or mature VLDL would be related to the degree of cytosolic exposure of apoB domains. To test this hypothesis, we isolated Golgi microsomes from McA cells treated with OA and then immunoprecipitated apoB under nondenaturing conditions to separate microsomes with apoB domain exposure or without (remaining in the supernatant). The microsomal contents of apoB-containing lipoproteins from both the supernatant fraction and the original microsomes were released with sodium carbonate and deoxycholate (22Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 23Boren J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subjected to density gradient separation. ApoB was then immunoprecipitated from each fraction and resolved and identified by SDS-PAGE/fluorography (see"

https://openalex.org/W2002575395,"Prostate cancer progression can be predicted in human tumor biopsies by abundant hyaluronan (HA) and its processing enzyme, the hyaluronidase HYAL1. Accumulation of HA is dictated by the balance between expression levels of HA synthases, the enzymes that produce HA polymers, and hyaluronidases, which process polymers to oligosaccharides. Aggressive prostate tumor cells express 20-fold higher levels of the hyaluronan synthase HAS3, but the mechanistic relevance of this correlation has not been determined. We stably overexpressed HAS3 in prostate tumor cells. Adhesion to extracellular matrix and cellular growth kinetics in vitro were significantly reduced. Slow growth in culture was restored either by exogenous addition of hyaluronidase or by stable HYAL1 coexpression. Coexpression did not improve comparably slow growth in mice, however, suggesting that excess hyaluronan production by HAS3 may alter the balance required for induced tumor growth. To address this, we used a tetracycline-inducible HAS3 expression system in which hyaluronan production could be experimentally controlled. Adjusting temporal parameters of hyaluronan production directly affected growth rate of the cells. Relief from growth suppression in vitro but not in vivo by enzymatic removal of HA effectively uncoupled the respective roles of hyaluronan in growth and angiogenesis, suggesting that growth mediation is less critical to establishment of the tumor than early vascular development. Collectively results also imply that HA processing by elevated HYAL1 expression in invasive prostate cancer is a requirement for progression.

Despite improved detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer, this disease remains the second leading cause of malignant mortality in United States males (1Landis S.H. Murray T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A.

The molecular mechanisms underlying this correlation could provide important insights for therapeutic development or improved diagnosis of prostate cancer. HA production is a tightly regulated process that impacts cellular transformation and motility during development (12Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar, 13Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. Fraser J.R. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: A1-A7Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 14Toole B.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). Dynamic HA turnover within tissues controls many acute processes such as wound healing or immune function. HA accumulation is the outcome of a balance between the activity of HA synthases (HAS), enzymes that synthesize the linear polymers (15Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), and hyaluronidases, which process the polymers to biologically potent oligosaccharides (16Stern R. Pathol. Biol. (Paris). 2005; 53: 372-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Excess quantities of large HA polymers have been reported to suppress cellular growth (17Dube B. Luke H.J.

Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 699-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). HAS isozymes (HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3) have been overexpressed in several tumorigenic cell lines and may impact tumor growth kinetics in a dose-dependent fashion (26Itano N. Sawai T. Atsumi F. Miyaishi O. Taniguchi S. Kannagi R. Hamaguchi M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18679-18687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For example, relatively low overexpression of HAS2 augments tumorigenesis, whereas high levels of HAS2 expression either have no effect or suppress growth of subcutaneous tumors. Interestingly a similar effect was recently shown for the hyaluronidase HYAL1 (5Lokeshwar V.B. Cerwinka W.H. Isoyama T. Lokeshwar B.L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7782-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), originally identified as a tumor suppressor (27Csoka A.B. Frost G.I. Heng H.H. Scherer S.W. Mohapatra G. Stern R.

Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) in conjunction with the HA receptor CD44 (33Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). HYAL1 is secreted and deposited to the extracellular space where it may be retained non-covalently by binding to HA (31Harada H. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5597-5607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). HYAL2 is glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored at the cell surface, localized to microdomains with CD44 (35Bourguignon L.Y. Singleton P.A. Diedrich F. Stern R. Gilad E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26991-27007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), stimulation of which signals HA uptake subsequent to its initial extracellular processing by HYAL1/2. HYAL1 exhibits maximal activity at acidic pH, whereas HYAL2 is active in both acidic and neutral conditions, consistent with intracellular lysosomal function of both enzymes upon internalization (36Triggs-Raine B.

Singleton P.A. Diedrich F. Stern R. Gilad E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26991-27007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and within rapidly developing tumors (38Lopez M.V. Blanco P. Viale D.L. Cafferata E.G. Carbone C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11368-11374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) may promote inappropriate activation, particularly of HYAL1, in the extracellular compartment. Differential hyaluronidase activity may thereby translate to a gradient of angiogenic and apoptotic oligosaccharides. The importance of a balance between expression levels of HA biosynthetic and processing enzymes for tumor cell growth is further suggested by the finding that HAS2 overexpression may promote growth in cell types with significant hyaluronidase activity, whereas it inhibits growth of cells lacking hyaluronidase (40Enegd B. King J.A. Stylli S. Paradiso L. Kaye A.H. Novak U. Neurosurgery. 2002; 50: 1311-1318PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that aggressive prostate tumor cell lines secrete excess HA and retain it at the cell surface in large matrices, a property that differentially mediates the interaction of the tumor cells with stromal and epithelial cell types (41Simpson M.A. Reiland J. Burger S.R. Furcht L.T. Spicer A.P. Oegema Jr., T.R. McCarthy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17949-17957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 42Simpson M.A. Wilson C.M.

Production of excess HA by prostate tumor cells is catalyzed by elevated levels of HAS2 and HAS3 specifically in aggressive cells. Inhibition of HAS expression in these cells interferes with tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, and metastasis, so the HA product clearly has a role in these processes in a prostate tumor model (43Simpson M.A. Wilson C.M. McCarthy J.B. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 849-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). When we coexpressed HAS2 and HYAL1 in stable tumor cell lines, resultant subcutaneous tumor sizes were 2-3-fold larger than those arising from either HAS2 or HYAL1 individually transfected cells (44Simpson M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that combined production and processing of HA contribute synergistically to tumor growth mechanisms. Because HAS3 is the most dramatically up-regulated isozyme in metastatic prostate tumor cells, we reasoned that its up-regulated expression would have a demonstrable influence on HA matrix production and sought to test the functional relevance of this correlation. We report here the first overexpression of HAS3 in prostate tumor cells. Stable lines were selected for HAS3 overexpression or for HYAL1/HAS3 coexpression to assess the respective outcomes in mice. Because HAS3 overexpression suppressed tumorigenesis, we additionally developed a tetracycline-inducible system for HAS3 overexpression and directly evaluated the correlation between HA production and prostate tumor cell growth in vitro. Our findings support a model in which excess HA suppresses tumorigenesis by diminishing apparent cellular growth and limiting angiogenesis. HYAL1 is thus implicated in promotion of angiogenesis by dissipation of accumulated HA within tumors, which may facilitate its recognition as an angiogenic signal. Cell Culture, Materials, and Reagents—22Rv1 human prostate adenocarcinoma cells (45Sramkoski R.M. Pretlow 2nd, T.G. Giaconia J.M. Pretlow T.P. Schwartz S. Sy M.S. Marengo S.R. Rhim J.S. Zhang D. Jacobberger J.W. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1999; 35: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) were purchased from ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Selection, characterization, and maintenance of 22Rv1 stable transfectants in standard medium containing 1.25 mg/ml G418 has been described previously (44Simpson M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The pIRES2-EGFP vector and plasmids pTet-On and pTRE-Tight that comprise the tetracycline-inducible mammalian expression system were obtained from Clontech. Doxycycline and Tet System-approved fetal bovine serum were also from Clontech. Anti-FLAG antibody was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Collagens I and IV were from BD Biosciences. Fibronectin, laminin, and calcein-AM were from Invitrogen, and antibodies to α and β integrins were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Human umbilical cord HA, Alcian blue, and tetramethylbenzidine were from Sigma. Streptomyces hyaluronidase was purchased from Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences). Biotinylated hyaluronan-binding protein (HABP) was from Seikagaku (Associates of Cape Cod, East Falmouth, MA). Transfection and Stable Selection of Prostate Tumor Cells—The plasmid constructs encoding FLAG epitope-tagged HYAL1 or HAS3 were described previously (42Simpson M.A. Wilson C.M. Furcht L.T. Spicer A.P. Oegema Jr., T.R. McCarthy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10050-10057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 44Simpson M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 22Rv1 human prostate tumor cells were transfected with 1) vector alone (pIRES2-EGFP), 2) plasmid encoding HYAL1-FLAG, 3) HAS3-FLAG plasmid, or 4) both the HYAL1 and the HAS3 plasmid constructs. Liposome-mediated transfection with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Gene expression was verified by Western blot and by enzyme activity assays as described. Stable 22Rv1 transfectants were obtained by clonal isolation following incubation for 14-20 days with G418 (1.25 mg/ml). Multiple clones were tested for expression, and those with average levels of expression were pooled to eliminate the bias from isolated selection. Once established, stable transfectants were maintained in the selection medium. Western Analysis of Transgene Expression—Conditioned media from cells cultured in 10-cm plates were prepared for Western analysis by diluting 1:1 with SDS gel loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. To prepare whole cell lysates, cultured cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by addition of 0.5 ml of hot SDS gel loading buffer. Cellular lysates were homogenized by shearing through a 26-gauge needle, incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and centrifuged. All samples were normalized for protein content or cell number as indicated. Equal amounts of each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane. After blocking, membranes were probed with anti-FLAG M2 or anti-VP16 antibody as appropriate (2 μg/ml), and blotted proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. For densitometric analysis, samples loaded in triplicate were blotted. Western blots were scanned and converted to grayscale in Adobe Photoshop. Pixel density in identically sized regions encompassing each band was used to calculate the mean ± S.E. for expression levels in HYAL1/HAS3 cotransfectants relative to HAS3 transfectants. Hyaluronidase Activity Assays—Overnight conditioned media from stably transfected cell lines were concentrated 10-fold and electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE on a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.2 mg/ml HA. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature in 3% Triton X-100, the gel was placed in hyaluronidase assay buffer (50 mm sodium formate, pH 4.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C overnight. Hyaluronidase activity was detected as a clear band at the expected molecular weight for HYAL1 upon staining 1 h with 0.5% Alcian blue and destaining with 7% acetic acid. Cell lysates were assayed similarly, and although several light bands were visible, no significant differences were observed between control and HYAL1-transfected cells indicating that the majority of overexpressed HYAL1 was secreted. To quantify hyaluronidase activity, we used a microplate assay essentially as described previously (6Lokeshwar V.B. Lokeshwar B.L. Pham H.T. Block N.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 651-657PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly serial dilutions of concentrated conditioned media normalized for protein content were applied in triplicate to HA-precoated microwell plates. Following a 1-h incubation in hyaluronidase assay buffer, wells were washed and developed with biotinylated HABP followed by avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase with tetramethylbenzidine substrate. Absorbance at 650 nm was used to interpolate specific activity from a concurrent Streptomyces hyaluronidase standard curve. In competition assays, exogenous HA (average molecular mass of ≈20 kDa; Lifecore, Chaska, MN) was included in the 1-h plate incubation. HA Quantification—HA content of transfected cell culture supernatants was determined by competitive binding assay (6Lokeshwar V.B. Lokeshwar B.L. Pham H.T. Block N.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 651-657PubMed Google Scholar, 43Simpson M.A. Wilson C.M. McCarthy J.B. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 849-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 46Frost G.I. Stern R. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Overnight conditioned media from prostate tumor cell cultures were harvested, and cells were counted. Equal volumes of serially diluted media were combined with biotinylated HABP (0.5 μg/ml) and incubated in HA-precoated microtiter plates for 6-8 h. Plates were developed using avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase with tetramethylbenzidine as substrate, and absorbance was read at 650 nm. HA concentration was interpolated from a standard curve and normalized to cell number. HA Pericellular Detection and Quantification—Pericellular HA retention was visualized and quantified by particle exclusion as described previously (42Simpson M.A. Wilson C.M. Furcht L.T. Spicer A.P. Oegema Jr., T.R. McCarthy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10050-10057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 43Simpson M.A. Wilson C.M. McCarthy J.B. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 849-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly cell cultures were incubated with 2 mg/ml aggrecan followed by addition of 1 × 108 fixed red blood cells. After 15 min, cells were viewed with phase-contrast microscopy and digitally photographed at 400× magnification. Matrix retention was quantified using Adobe Photoshop to calculate relative areas for matrices and cellular boundaries of individual cells. HA matrix thickness is presented as the ratio of matrix area to cell area for each transfectant or condition. Growth Assays—Two-dimensional growth in culture was assayed as described previously (43Simpson M.A. Wilson C.M. McCarthy J.B. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 849-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Equivalent passages of each tumor cell line were plated at 5000 cells/well in 24-well plates. At 24-h intervals, quadruplicate wells of each cell line were released with trypsin, neutralized, and manually counted in a hemacytometer. Duplicate counts for each well were averaged to obtain the total cell count per well. Each point is the mean ± S.E. of the total cell counts. Although the graph presents data from a single assay in quadruplicate, the growth trends were reproduced in three additional identical assays. Mouse Subcutaneous Injection—All mice were cared for and maintained under the supervision and guidelines of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male NOD/SCID mice (The Jackson Laboratory) (eight animals per condition) were injected subcutaneously in each flank with 1 × 106 tumor cells suspended in 100 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. After 28 days, mice were sacrificed, and tumors were dissected and weighed. Mean tumor wet weight ±S.E. was plotted for each cell line. Statistical significance was assigned by Student's two-tailed t test. The experiment was repeated with an additional eight animals per cell line, and similar results were obtained. Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence—HA content and vascularization of tumors were detected as described previously (43Simpson M.A. Wilson C.M. McCarthy J.B. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 849-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly after weighing, tumors were divided in halves. One-half was formalin-fixed and embedded in paraffin. The other half was snap frozen in OCT compound. For HA detection, paraffin-embedded tumors were sectioned, dewaxed, probed with biotinylated HABP, and developed using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Irvine, CA). Sections were counterstained with Meyer's hematoxylin to visualize cellular boundaries. White light images were collected at 200× magnification. Vascularization of the tumors was assessed in ethanol-fixed frozen sections (8-μm thickness) by antibody staining for CD31 as described previously (43Simpson M.A. Wilson C.M. McCarthy J.B. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 849-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 47Wild R. Ramakrishnan S. Sedgewick J. Griffioen A.W. Microvasc. Res. 2000; 59: 368-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis Quantification—CD31-phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody staining of frozen sections was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Five random sections from each of three tumors per cell line were digitally photographed with 5-s exposure time. Images saved as TIF files were converted from 16 to 8 bit in Adobe Photoshop, red channel fluorescence was isolated, images were converted to grayscale and inverted, and a black-and-white threshold was arbitrarily set based on levels. The histogram function was used to determine vessel density as represented by density of black pixels at 0 on the black-to-white scale. Average pixel density for each transfectant tumor section was normalized to the average pixel density for untransfected tumor sections. Statistical significance was assigned by Student's two-tailed t test. Extracellular Matrix Adhesion and Blocking—Microplates were precoated with collagen I, collagen IV, laminin, or fibronectin in serially diluted doses for 1 h at 37 °C and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin. Subconfluent cells were released with 1 mm EDTA, washed, and resuspended in adhesion medium (serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1% bovine serum albumin), and labeled with calcein-AM (25 μg/106 cells, 20 min at 37 °C). Labeled cells (104 cells/well) were incubated in quadruplicate wells of the precoated plates for 2 h at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed with three gentle washes in adhesion medium. Remaining adherent cells were lysed with 0.2 n NaOH containing 1% SDS. Fluorescence was measured in a microplate spectrophotometer, and the percentage of adherent cells relative to the input number was calculated from a standard curve of each labeled cell culture. For adhesion specificity tests, cells were preincubated with antibodies against integrins β1, α1, α2, or α5 (5 μg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C prior to placing them in the substrate-coated microplates. Antibodies were present throughout the assay incubation. Generation and Characterization of Tet-inducible 22Rv1 Cells—22Rv1 cells were transfected with pTet-On using FuGENE 6 reagent and selected with 1.5 mg/ml G418 until isolated colonies were obtained. Individual colonies were amplified in the continuous presence of G418 and screened for expression of the tetracycline transactivator-VP16 fusion protein by Western blots probed with anti-VP16 antibody. VP16-positive clones were then tested for inducible gene expression by transient transfection with a GFP or luciferase reporter plasmid. Transfectants were induced by applying media containing 2 μg/ml doxycycline (dox) and digitally photographed or harvested to prepare soluble extracts 48 h later. To characterize HAS3 expression, transient transfectants were initially induced with dox for 48 h at which time conditioned media were assayed for HA content as described above, and membrane-enriched fractions were harvested by mechanical disruption and solubilization in 1% Triton X-100 for Western blotting. In subsequent experiments, control and HAS3 transient transfectants were induced with dox 24 h after transfection and plated (20,000 cells/well) for simultaneous assays of growth rate, HA content, and HAS3 expression as indicated in specific figures. In some experiments, exogenous Streptomyces hyaluronidase (0.2 milliunits/ml final concentration per dose) was added daily throughout the time course. To assay the temporal effects of HA induction, transfectants (20,000 cells/well) were plated and induced identically, but dox was removed after day 4. At that time, all media were removed and replaced with fresh media. In additional experiments, cells were identically plated and assayed, but dox was not added until day 4 at which point all standard media were removed and replaced. Stable Expression of HAS3 and HYAL1—We previously characterized HAS and hyaluronidase isozyme expression and activity in 22Rv1 cells (44Simpson M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). HAS3 was expressed at basal levels comparable to normal prostate and synthesized relatively little HA. Although reverse transcription-PCR indicated expression of HYAL1 message, its enzymatic activity was very low in comparison with that of HYAL1 transfectants. Because our goal was to determine the respective and concerted functions of HYAL1 and HAS3, 22Rv1 cells were deemed an appropriate model in which to overexpress these enzymes. Stable lines were selected for overexpression of FLAG epitope-tagged HYAL1 or HAS3 from a constitutive eukaryotic promoter in the pIRES2-EGFP bicistronic reporter vector. HYAL1/HAS3 cotransfectants were identified that expressed approximately equivalent levels of HYAL1 with respect to the individual HYAL1 transfectants. Conditioned media from each transfectant were compared by Western blot to the vector contr"
https://openalex.org/W2092873962,"Endoglin is a transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily auxiliary receptor. We had previously shown that it suppressed prostate cancer (PCa) cell motility, and that its expression was lost during PCa progression. The mechanism by which endoglin inhibits PCa cell motility is unknown. Here we demonstrate that endoglin abrogates TGFβ-mediated cell motility, but does not alter cell surface binding of TGFβ. By measuring Smad-specific phosphorylation and Smad-responsive promoter activity, endoglin was shown to constitutively activate Smad1, with little-to-no effect upon Smad3. Knockdown of Smad1 increased motility and abrogated endoglin's effects. As type I activin receptor-like kinases (ALKs) are necessary for Smad activation, we went on to show that knockdown of ALK2, but not TGFβRI (ALK5), abrogated endoglin-mediated decreases in cell motility and constitutively active ALK2 was sufficient to restore a low-motility phenotype in endoglin deficient cells. These findings provide the first evidence that endoglin decreases PCa cell motility through activation of the ALK2-Smad1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2026031259,"Nonribosomal peptide natural products are biosynthesized from amino acid precursors by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), which are organized into modules. For a typical NRPS initiation module, an adenylation (A) domain activates an amino acid and installs it onto a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain as a thioester; an elongation module, which has a condensation (C) domain located between every consecutive pair of A and PCP domains, catalyzes the formation of the peptide bond between the upstream aminoacyl/peptidyl-S-PCP and the free amino group of the downstream aminoacyl-S-PCP. d-Amino acid constituents in peptide natural products usually arise from the l-enantiomers through the action of integral epimerization (E) domains of an NRPS. The biosynthetic gene cluster for leinamycin, a hybrid nonribosomal peptide/polyketide containing a d-alanine moiety, does not encode a typical NRPS initiation module with the expected A-PCP-E domains; instead, it has only an A protein (LnmQ) and a PCP (LnmP), both of which are encoded by separate genes. Here we show the results of biochemical experiments as follows: (i) we demonstrate that LnmQ directly activates d-alanine as d-alaninyl-AMP and installs it onto LnmP to generate a d-alaninyl-S-PCP intermediate; (ii) we confirm that aminoacylation of LnmP by LnmQ in trans is the result of specific communication between the separate A and PCP proteins; and (iii) we reveal that leinamycin production can be improved by supplementation of exogenous d-alanine in the fermentation broth of Streptomyces atroolivaceous S-140. These findings unveil an unprecedented NRPS initiation module structure that is characterized by a discrete d-alanine-specific A protein and a PCP. Nonribosomal peptide natural products are biosynthesized from amino acid precursors by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), which are organized into modules.

Nonribosomal peptide natural products include many clinically important drugs such as vancomycin (antibacterial), bleomycin (anticancer), and cyclosporine (immunosuppressant). They are biosynthesized from amino acid precursors by nonribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs) 2The abbreviations used are: NRPS, nonribosomal peptide synthetase; A, adenylation; C or C′, condensation; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; F, formylation; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; IPTG, isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside; LNM, leinamycin; PCP, peptidyl carrier protein; PKS, polyketide synthase; PPi, inorganic pyrophosphate; 4′PP, 4′-phosphopantetheine; DTT, dithiothreitol. that are multifunctional enzymes organized into modules (1Sieber S.A. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 715-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Three groups of NRPS systems are known to date (2Mootz H.D. Schwarzer D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. Chem. 2002; 3: 490-540Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar). (i) Type A (linear) NRPSs are analogous to type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) (3Staunton J. Weissman K.J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 380-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar, 4Fischbach M.A. Walsh C.T. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 3468-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar) in which each module harbors a set of distinct, noniteratively acting activities responsible for the catalysis of one cycle of peptide chain elongation. In this system, the amino acid sequence of the resultant linear peptide chain is co-linear with the number and order of the modules. (ii) Type B (iterative) NRPSs use their modules or domains more than once in the assembly of a single product. This strategy is employed to build up peptide chains containing repeated smaller sequences. (iii) Type C (nonlinear) NRPSs harbor at least one unusual arrangement of the modules or core domains with two primary differences from typical type A NRPSs. One is the unusual internal cyclization or branch point synthase that leads to a deviation from the normal function of a linear NRPS, resulting in a nonlinear peptide product. The other is the specialized condensation or ligase domain that incorporates small soluble molecules, such as amines, into the assembled peptides. Three enzymatic activities, which normally are specified by a module that contains condensation-adenylation-peptidyl carrier protein (C-A-PCP) domains, are necessary for one complete elongation cycle of peptide synthesis catalyzed by an NRPS. The A domain selects the correct amino acid from the pool of available substrates and activates it as an aminoacyl adenylate, and the activated amino acid is then transferred onto the –SH group of the 4′-phosphopantheinyl (4′PP) arm attached to the PCP domain. Next, the C domain, usually present between every consecutive pair of A and PCP domains, catalyzes the peptide bond formation between the upstream aminoacyl/peptidyl-S-PCP and the free amino group of the downstream aminoacyl-S-PCP, thus facilitating the translocation of the growing peptide chain onto the next module. Correspondingly, a typical initiation module requires two catalytic activities arranged as A-PCP didomain for the formation of a starter aminoacyl-S-PCP; a native elongation module can be biochemically converted into an initiation module by deleting the C domain (5Doekel S. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 373-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). One of the hallmarks of nonribosomal peptide natural products is the presence of d-amino acids. For example, three of the four amino acids of glycopeptidolipids (6Billman-Jacobe H. McConville M.J. Haites R.E. Kovacevic S. Coppel R.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), three of the seven amino acids of mycosubtilin (7Duitman E.H. Hamoen L.W.

Ed. 2003; 42: 731-765Crossref Scopus (314) Google Scholar) have the d-configuration. In general, the A domains of NRPSs select the readily available l-amino acids for activation, and epimerization (E) domains generate a d-configuration, whereas the amino acids is tethered to the PCP (1Sieber S.A. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 715-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 2Mootz H.D. Schwarzer D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol.

A number of nonribosomal peptide natural products, such as HC toxin (9Scott-Craig J.S. Panaccione D.G. Pocard J.A. Walton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26044-26049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cyclosporin (10Weber G. Schörgendorfer K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Leitner E. Curr.

Sequence data suggest that the internal C-A-PCP-E module, which activates l-Ala and then epimerizes l-Ala into d-Ala, has been found in the NRPS genes for daptomycin (11Miao V. Coeffet-LeGal M-F. Brian P. Brost R. Whiting A. Penn J. Martin S. Ford R. Parr I. Bouchard M. Silva C.J. Wrigley S.K. Baltz R.H.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 564-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) biosynthesis. The NRPS module for d-Ala incorporation in cyclosporine or HC toxin biosynthesis, however, does not contain an integrated E domain and cannot activate l-Ala; instead, d-Ala is among the pool of available amino acids and is directly activated. In these two cases, d-Ala is provided by a dedicated Ala racemase that is encoded by a separate gene (15Hoffmann K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Kleinkauf H. Zocher R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12710-12714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cheng Y-Q. Walton J.D. J. Biol.

Leinamycin (LNM) (Fig. 1A), a hybrid nonribosomal peptide/polyketide natural product containing a d-Ala, exhibits potent antitumor activity, especially against tumors that are resistant to clinically important anticancer drugs (17Hara M. Takahashi I. Yoshida M. Asano K. Kawamoto I. Morimoto M. Nakano H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1989; 42: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We have reported on the identification, localization, sequencing analysis, and genetic and biochemical characterization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for LNM biosynthesis in Streptomyces atroolivaceus S-140 (18Cheng Y-Q. Tang G.-L. Shen B. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Cheng Y-Q. Tang G.-L. Shen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sequencing analysis of the lnm gene cluster revealed discrete NRPS PCP (LnmP) and A (LnmQ) proteins, instead of a conventional A-PCP-E start module or an A-PCP module for directly loading of d-Ala. The essential role of LnmQ in LNM biosynthesis was proven by gene inactivation and complementation experiments (20Tang G-L. Cheng Y.-Q. Shen B. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Here we show in vitro that LnmQ directly activates d-Ala and loads it onto the –SH group of 4′PP moiety in LnmP as thioester to generate a d-alaninyl-S-PCP intermediate. Transfer of d-Ala between LnmQ and LnmP is mediated through specific interactions between the A and PCP proteins and does not involve dissociation of the aminoacyl-AMP followed by adventitious thiolation by the free-standing PCP in solution. Furthermore, we show that LNM production can be improved by supplementation of exogenous d-Ala in the fermentation broth of S. atroolivaceus. These findings unveil new insights into the biochemistry of NRPS initiation and provide new opportunities for the generation of LNM analogs through engineering the NRPS initiation module. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Biochemicals, and Chemicals—Escherichia coli DH5α was used as host for general subcloning, and E. coli BL21(DE3) was used as the host for protein expression (Novagen, Madison, WI). An LNM producer, S. atroolivaceus S-140, and authentic LNM were gifts from Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd. (Machida, Tokyo, Japan). Cloning vectors pGEM-9Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI) and protein expression vectors pET28a and pET37b (Novagen) were originally from commercial sources. d-Ala was from Sigma, and all other common biochemicals and chemicals were from standard commercial sources. DNA Isolation and Manipulation—Plasmid preparation and DNA fragment extraction were carried out by using commercial kits (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). Restriction enzyme digestions and ligations were done by standard methods (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). PCR primer synthesis and DNA sequencing were carried out at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center. PCRs were performed on a GeneAmp 2400 thermocycler (PE-ABI, Foster City, CA). Expression of lnmQ and lnmP Genes in E. coli and Purification of the Resultant Proteins—The lnmQ gene was amplified by PCR from cosmid pBS3007 (18Cheng Y-Q. Tang G.-L. Shen B. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with the following primer pairs: 5′-CG GAA TTC CAT ATG AGC GGC GCC AAG CTG C (EcoRI-NdeI) and 5′-CG CGC AAG CTT GGA CGC CGG GGC GAG GTT (HindIII). (Restriction enzyme sites introduced into the N- and C-terminal portions of the genes are indicated in the primer sequence in boldface and underlined). PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and extraction from gel slices, digested with EcoRI/HindIII, and ligated into the same sites of pGEM-9Zf(+) to yield plasmid pBS3048. This plasmid was identified by restriction enzyme digestion and confirmed by sequencing, and then its NdeI/HindIII fragment was cloned into the same sites of pET37b to make the expression plasmid pBS3049. The resulting plasmid, as well as pBS3021, an lnmP expression plasmid constructed previously (19Cheng Y-Q. Tang G.-L. Shen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3149-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), was transformed separately into E. coli BL21(DE3) for gene expression. For overproduction of the LnmQ and LnmP proteins, cells harboring pBS3049 (for lnmQ) or pBS3021 (for lnmP) (19Cheng Y-Q. Tang G.-L. Shen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3149-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) were grown in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Cultures (2× 500 ml) were grown to an A600 of 0.4–0.6 at 37 °C and then cooled to 18 °C for 30 min, and gene expression was induced by the addition of 0.2 mm IPTG. Cultures were grown for an additional 18 h. The purification of the His6- or His8-tagged fusion protein with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin was performed according to the manufacturer's manual (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and the resultant proteins were dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol and stored at –80 °C. Amino Acid Specificity Assay of the LnmQ Protein—Amino acid-dependent ATP-sodium pyrophosphate (PPi) assays were performed according to literature procedures (18Cheng Y-Q. Tang G.-L. Shen B. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Linne U. Marahiel M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 388: 293-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Du L. Shen B.

A typical 100-μl assay reaction contained 125 nm LnmQ, 3 mm ATP, 0.1 mm PPi with 0.5 μCi of 32PPi (40.02 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm various amino acids in 75 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer. After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, the assays were stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of 1% (w/v) activated charcoal in 4.5% (w/v) tetrasodium pyrophosphate and 3.5% (v/v) perchloric acid. The precipitates were collected on glass fiber filters (2.4 cm, G-4, Fisher), washed successively with 10 ml of 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate plus 1.4% perchloric acid, 10 ml of water, and 5 ml of ethanol, and briefly dried in air. The filters were mixed with 7 ml of scintillation fluid (ScintiSafe Gel, Fisher) and counted on a Beckman LS-6800 scintillation counter to determine the radioactivity. To determine the kinetic parameters of substrates, reactions were carried out at 30 °C in a total volume of 100 μl that contained 75 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 3 mm ATP, 50 nm LnmQ, 1 mm PPi with 0.8 μCi of 32PPi (12.1Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and increasing concentrations of d-Ala (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 5.0, 7.5, 10, and 15 mm) for 5 min. For Gly, the concentrations were 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 200, 300, and 400 mm, and the reaction time was 10 min. The initial rate conditions were maintained by computing the substrate amino acid at less than 10% conversion, on the assumption that these conditions were within the linear range of enzyme concentration and enzyme turnover. The data were fitted with the Michaelis-Menten equation to extract the kinetic constants. In Vitro Aminoacylation Assays of PCP (LnmP)—The in vitro phosphopantetheinylation and aminoacylation of LnmP were carried out according to literature methods (17Hara M. Takahashi I. Yoshida M. Asano K. Kawamoto I. Morimoto M. Nakano H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1989; 42: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Linne U.

A typical reaction (100 μl) contained 75 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.3 mm CoA, 10 μm LnmP, and 100 nm Svp, a known promiscuous phosphopantetheinyl transferase (23Linne U. Marahiel M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 388: 293-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C to allow complete phosphopantetheinylation of the apoLnmP. Then 0.2 μm LnmQ and 1.5 μCi of d-[14C]Ala or [14C]Gly (55 mCi/mmol, ICN Biomedicals Inc., Irvine, CA) were added into the reaction, followed by 3 mm ATP to initiate the aminoacylation reaction, which was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for another 2–10 min. The reactions were quenched with 0.9 ml of acetone at –80 °C for 2 h; the precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, 4 °C for 20 min, and the protein pellets were redissolved and loaded on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After being stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, destained, and dried, the gels were visualized by a Phosphor Imager (low energy screen, GE Healthcare). Identification of the Reaction Products of LnmQ and LnmP by HPLC and ESI-MS Analysis—After complete phosphopantetheinylation of the apoLnmP (20 μm) as described as above, 0.5 μm LnmQ and 60 μm d-Ala or 200 μm Gly was added into the reaction, followed by 3 mm ATP to initiate the aminoacylation reaction, which was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for another 2–5 min. The reactions were analyzed by injecting a portion into an HPLC equipped with a Jupiter C18 reverse phase column (5 μm, 300 Å, 250 × 4.6 mm) and chromatographing with a linear gradient of 40–75% acetonitrile in water (containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in 25 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with monitoring by a UV detector at 215 nm. Peaks were collected, lyophilized, redissolved in H2O, and subjected to ESI-MS analysis (Agilent 1000 HPLC-MSD SL instrument, Palo Alto, CA). Determination of the Kinetic Parameters of LnmP Aminoacylation by LnmQ—To determine the kinetic parameters for holo-LnmP aminoacylation by LnmQ, reactions were carried out at 30 °C in total volume of 100 μl that contained 75 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 3 mm ATP, 5 nm LnmQ, 2 mm d-Ala (or 40 mm Gly), and various concentrations of holo-LnmP (2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 μm) for 3 min. The ratio of aminoacyl-S-LnmP to holo-LnmP conversion was analyzed by HPLC as described above. The initial rate conditions were maintained by computing the substrate amino acid conversion at less than 10% on the assumption that these conditions were within the linear range of enzyme concentration and enzyme turnover. The data were fitted with the Michaelis-Menten equation to extract the kinetic constants. LNM Production, Isolation, and Analysis—LNM production and isolation from wild type S. atroolivaceus and HPLC analysis were carried out as reported previously (18Cheng Y-Q. Tang G.-L. Shen B. J.

Seed culture (5 ml) was inoculated into the fermentation medium (50 ml), which was allowed to grow at 28 °C, 300 rpm for 10–15 h, and then different concentrations of d-Ala (5, 10, 25 mm) were added separately. After 3–5 h, moisturized Diaion HP-20 resin was added to 5% (w/v), and the fermentation was continued for up to 48 h (18Cheng Y-Q. Tang G.-L. Shen B. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Cheng Y-Q. Tang G.-L. Shen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Characterization of LnmQ as an NRPS A Domain with a Substrate Specificity for d-Ala—According to the LNM structure (Fig. 1A), the widely accepted bacterial NRPS/PKS paradigm (4Fischbach M.A. Walsh C.T. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 3468-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 26Du L. Sánchez C. Shen B. Metab. Eng. 2001; 3: 78-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), sequencing analysis, and the result of in vivo gene replacement (20Tang G-L. Cheng Y.-Q. Shen B. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we have proposed that LnmQ serves as the NRPS A domain of the LNM biosynthetic initiation (or loading) module, to activate d-Ala as an aminoacyl-AMP and transfer it onto LnmP, the PCP partner of LnmQ (Fig. 1A). To validate this hypothesis, we amplified the lnmQ gene by PCR and cloned it into the T7 overexpression vector pET37b. This construction allows the production of LnmQ as a C-terminal His8-tagged protein. LnmQ was overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified by nickel affinity chromatography to homogeneity, as visualized by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1B). The yield of purified fusion protein was ∼20 mg/liter. Substrate-dependent ATP-32PPi exchange assays showed that, among d-Ala, β-Ala, and the 20 proteinogenic l-amino acids tested, d-Ala is the preferred substrate of LnmQ (Fig. 2A). LnmQ also demonstrated activity, albeit much weaker (11% relatively to d-Ala under the specific assay condition), toward Gly. In addition, kinetic parameters for d-Ala and Gly as substrates of LnmQ (Fig. 2, B and C, and Table 1) were comparable with other A domains of NRPSs (27Chen H. O'Connor S. Cane D.E. Walsh C.T. Chem.

The Km value for d-Ala is 1.62 mm, which is 22 times lower than that of Gly; and the catalytic efficiency of d-Ala is 264 mm–1·min–1, which is about 50 times higher than that of Gly. These results support d-Ala as the natural substrate of LnmQ.TABLE 1Apparent Michaelis-Menten constants for LnmQ as an adenylation enzyme toward selected amino acid as determined by the ATP-32PPi exchange assaySubstrateKmkcatkcat/KmRelative efficiencymmmin-1mm-1 min-1d-Ala1.62 ± 0.06427 ± 102641.0Gly36.8 ± 0.7189 ± 3.05.10.019 Open table in a new tab Characterization of LnmP as an NRPS PCP—The lnmP gene, encoding a discrete PCP, is located upstream of lnmQ and is transcriptionally coupled with the lnmQ open reading frame (Fig. 1A). LnmP contains a modestly conserved signature motif of GX(HD)S, in which the Ser residue (underlined) can be posttranslationally modified by the covalent attachment of the 4′PP group (20Tang G-L.

To test LnmP as the PCP partner of LnmQ, we expressed this small gene using the pET28a vector in E. coli and purified the resultant PCP as an N-His6 and C-His6-tagged fusion protein to homogeneity (Fig. 1C), with a yield of ∼50 mg/liter (19Cheng Y-Q. Tang G.-L. Shen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3149-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To our surprise, two distinguishable protein bands were visualized on SDS-PAGE. HPLC and ESI-MS analysis (Fig. 3C, panel I, and Table 2) confirmed that one band was the apo-form, and the other band was the holo-PCP that has a 4′PP group added by E. coli ACPS phosphopantetheinyl transferase (24Du L.

By HPLC analysis, the holo-form represented ∼40% of the total PCP after 18 h of induced expression at 18 °C (Fig. 3C, panel I). When LnmP was incubated with CoA and the Svp phosphopantetheinyl transferase (25Sánchez C. Du L. Edwards D.J. Toney M.D. Shen B. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 725-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the apoPCP was completely converted into the holo-form (Fig. 3C, panel II).TABLE 2ESI-MS analysis of apo-, holo-, and aminoacyl-S-LnmPLnmP[M + H]+ calculated[M + H]+ foundapo-LnmP12,33512,333holo-LnmP12,67512,673d-Alaninyl-S-LnmP12,74612,744Glycinyl-S-LnmP12,73212,730 Open table in a new tab Aminoacylation of LnmP by LnmQ—We previously proposed that LnmQ and LnmP constitute the initiation module that is responsible for chain initiation of LNM biosynthesis by incorporating a d-Ala moiety (Fig. 1A) (19Cheng Y-Q.

To verify whether holo-LnmP can be aminoacylated by LnmQ, we incubated the holo-LnmP and LnmQ with d-[14C]Ala or [14C]Gly and ATP to directly test amino acid loading (Fig. 3A). Reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging to detect specific loading of the 14C-amino-acid onto the 4′PP group of PCP (Fig. 3B). Reaction mixtures with nonradioactive substrates were subjected to HPLC (Fig. 3C), and the resolved apoPCP, holo-PCP, and aminoacyl-S-PCP species were collected and subjected to ESI-MS analysis to confirm the predicted modifications (Table 2). The collective results showed that both d-Ala and Gly can be effectively activated by LnmQ as aminoacyl-AMP and transferred onto holo-LnmP to form the d-Ala or Gly aminoacyl-S-PCP intermediate, and that formation of aminoacyl-S-LnmP is dependent on ATP (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 5) and holo-LnmP (Fig. 3B, lanes 3, 4, 6, and 7). The kinetic parameters of holo-LnmP aminoacylation by LnmQ were subsequently determined (Table 3). The Km values for holo-LnmP as determined with fixed concentrations of d-Ala (at 2 mm) or Gly (at 40 mm) are about 6.2 and 8.0 μm, respectively, whereas the kcat values as determined with d-Ala and Gly are similar, 99"

The p53 tumor suppressor is a critical regulator of many cellular functions including cell growth arrest, apoptosis, and cellular senescence (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar). Its importance is underscored by the observation that it is frequently mutated in ∼40-50% of all human tumors (2Caron de Fromentel C. Soussi T.

Upon DNA damage events and other types of stress stimuli, p53 is quickly stabilized and activated. The exact mechanisms leading to p53 stabilization remain poorly understood, although Mdm2 destabilization as well as post-translational modifications on p53 is thought to play a role (6Stommel J.M. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway consists of E1-activating enzymes, E2-conjugating enzymes, and E3 ubiquitin ligases (7Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In the case of p53, Mdm2 acts as the specific E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53 by mediating the transfer of an ubiquitin moiety from E2-ubiquitin to the p53 substrate. Mdm2 has the capability of catalyzing both monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination of p53, and the particular choice for one or the other has been shown to be dependent on the levels of Mdm2 (8Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W. Science. 2003; 302: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). When Mdm2 levels are low, Mdm2 preferentially catalyzes monoubiquitination of p53. When the levels are high, p53 polyubiquitination occurs. The fates of these different ubiquitinated forms of p53 have significantly different consequences as well. Monoubiquitination acts as a signal for p53 nuclear export, whereas polyubiquitinated p53 is quickly and efficiently degraded by nuclear 26 S proteasomes. Recent studies have shown that ubiquitination, in particular monoubiquitination, serves as an important occurrence for a variety of cellular functions including transcriptional activation, protein-protein interactions, and intracellular localization (9Sigismund S. Polo S. Di Fiore P.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 286: 149-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The movement of proteins between various cellular compartments is an important mechanism for functional regulation. Movement of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm not only removes it from its transcriptional targets, but it also allows for further post-translational modifications to occur. In addition, moving p53 to the cytoplasm places it near mitochondria where its transcription-independent pro-apoptotic functions can take place (10Chipuk J.E. Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Droin N.M.

Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). The well accepted model for the nuclear export of p53 requires the dissociation of the tetramer and exposure of the nuclear export sequence for accessibility and recognition by nuclear export machinery such as CRM1. We have shown previously that monoubiquitination is a signal for nuclear export. Here, we have expanded on this notion and shown for the first time that monoubiquitination of p53 has no effect on its ability to tetramerize. These data are significant conclusions in the mechanistic studies of p53 nuclear export, as they show that dissociation of the p53 tetramer as a mechanism for NES exposure is not necessary for efficient nuclear export. Although it is clear that monoubiquitination is an important event for mediating the nuclear export of p53, it is unclear if monoubiquitination of p53 has any effect on its function as a transcriptional activator. In this study, we have developed a two-step approach for purifying pure ubiquitinated p53 from cells. Interestingly, purified monoubiquitinated p53 retains its ability to tetramerize but loses transcriptional activity. The loss of transcriptional activity stems from the inability of p53 to bind DNA and activate target promoters. Plasmid Construction—To construct the p53, p53-UB, Mdm2, p21-Luc, and TK-Luc expression vectors, the DNA sequences corresponding to the full-length proteins were amplified by PCR from Marathon-Ready HeLa cDNA (Clontech) or other templates, and subcloned either into pCIN4 or pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) for expression in mammalian cells. The FLAG and His6 sequences were introduced at the N terminus of p53 and UB, respectively, by PCR. To make the p53-UB fusion construct, p53 was amplified from a pCIN4 template and subcloned into a pCIN4-UB construct lacking the ubiquitin start codon. The p53Δ325-354 construct was a generous gift from Z. Ronai. Protein Purification of Monoubiquitinated p53—To isolate monoubiquitinated p53 from cells, FLAG-p53 and His-UB were transfected into three 15-cm plates containing 293 cells at 70% confluence. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were split 1:4 and incubated for an additional 48 h. The cells were then harvested on ice and lysed in 6 m guanidine buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 0.1 m Na2PO4/NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm imidazole, 0.2% Triton X-100, and fresh protease inhibitors) with mild sonication. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) were then added and lysates were rotated at room temperature overnight. The beads were then washed for 5 min with each of the following buffers as previously described (13Xirodimas D.P. Stephen C.W. Lane D.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 270: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) with some modifications: 6 m guanidinium HCl, 0.1 m Na2PO4/NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm imidazole, 0.2% Triton X-100; 8 m urea, 0.1 m Na2PO4/NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm imidazole; 8 m urea, 0.1 m Na2PO4/NaH2PO4, 0.01 Tris/HCl, pH 6.3, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm imidazole; (BC100) 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl. Ubiquitinated proteins were eluted using 500 mm imidazole at room temperature. The elutions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against BC100 with several changes of the dialysis buffer, and then subjected to a second round of purification with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose beads (M2, Sigma). These beads were then eluted twice using FLAG peptide and the eluates pooled for purified monoubiquitinated p53. Gel-filtration Chromatography—Purification and size fractionation was performed on a Superose-12 column using the SMART/FPLC system (GE Healthcare). For fractionation of the fusion constructs, H1299 cells were transiently transfected with p53wt, p53-UB, p531-290, or p53Δ325-254 and harvested on ice 24 h post-transfection. The cells were then lysed with FLAG lysis buffer for 1 h, cleared by centrifugation, and dialyzed against hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, 10 mm KCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2) overnight. The dialyzed protein was then passed on the column and 40-μl fractions collected. The samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blots using the α-p53 monoclonal antibody (DO-1) (Santa Cruz). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed essentially as described (14Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The long probe (220 bp) was generated by PCR with 5′-tgctgcctgcttcccaggaaca-3′ (sense) and 5′-ccatccccttcctcacctgaaa-3′ (antisense) primers. The probe was 32P end-labeled by using T4 polynucleotide kinase and then purified by placing it on a Bio-Spin P-30 column (Bio-Rad). The binding reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 15 ng of salmon sperm DNA, and proteins as indicated. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature before adding the 32P-labeled DNA probe and further incubated for an additional 20 min. Samples were then resolved on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C followed by autoradiography. Immunofluorescent Staining—For immunofluorescent staining of transiently transfected fusion proteins, p53wt or p53-Ub were transfected into the p53-null H1299 cell line grown on coverslips in 6-well plates. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C and then rehydrated for 5 min at room temperature with serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Cellgro). The cells were then permeablized using 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fisher) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with 1% BSA (Sigma)/Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered salt solution (DPBS) (Cellgro) for 1 h. Primary antibody DO-1 (Santa Cruz) in 1% BSA/DPBS was incubated with the cells for 1 h at room temperature and then washed with 1% BSA/DPBS for 20 min. Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, after a 15-min 1% BSA/DPBS wash, the cells were counterstained with DAPI in the last wash to visualize the nuclei. In Vitro Protein Cross-linking Assay—H1299 cells were transiently transfected with p53wt, p53-UB, p53-GFP, or p53Δ325-354 and harvested on ice 24 h post-transfection. After lysis with FLAG lysis buffer for 1 h, equal protein amounts were incubated with 0, 0.01, or 0.1% glutaraldehyde (Fisher) on ice for 30 min. The samples were then boiled with SDS sample buffer and subsequently resolved on 7% SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis with the anti-p53 monoclonal (DO-1) antibody. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay was performed essentially as described with some modifications (15Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). 1.0 × 107 H1299 cells were transfected with p53wt, p53-UB, or p53-GFP, incubated for 24 h, and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.125 m glycine and the cells were harvested in SDS lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in IP buffer (0.3% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors), followed by sonication to an average DNA length of 500-1000 bp. The samples were cleared by centrifugation, and pre-cleared with protein A-agarose beads pre-coated with salmon sperm DNA (Upstate) for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged and divided into 3 aliquots of 2 ml containing equal protein concentrations, with 30 μl being saved as input control. Antibodies were added to each sample and rotated at 4 °C overnight. 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads pre-coated with salmon sperm DNA were incubated with each sample for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of mixed Micelle wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 5% sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.2% SDS), two times with 1 ml of buffer 500 (0.1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100), two times with 1 ml of LiCl/detergent buffer (0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1mm EDTA, 250 mm LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mm Tris/HCl), and 2 washes with TE buffer (10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA). The beads and input were incubated 2 times with 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1% NaHCO3) for 30 min and incubated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the cross-links. The eluates were then incubated with Proteinase K and RNase for 1 h and extracted with phenol/chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation containing Pellet Paint Co-precipitant (Novagen) to visualize the pellet. After drying, the DNA was dissolved in TE buffer and analyzed by PCR. The full-length p53 polyclonal antibody (FL) (Santa Cruz) was used for all p53 samples. The primers for the PCR corresponded to the 5′ short p21 promoter and had the following sequences: 5′-ctcacatcctccttcttcag-3′ (sense) and 5′-cacacacagaatctgactccc-3′ (antisense). The input DNA was diluted 1:10 for the PCR. The PCR products were amplified for 32 cycles. Western Blot Analysis of Endogenous p21 and Luciferase Reporter Assays—For Western blot analysis of p21 induction, p53-null H1299 cells were transfected with p53wt or p53-UB and harvested on ice 24 h post-transfection. After cell lysis using FLAG lysis buffer, 40 μg of total protein was boiled with SDS sample buffer and loaded on 15% SDS-PAGE gels, followed by Western blot analysis using the anti-p53 monoclonal (DO-1) (Santa Cruz), α-GFP monoclonal (Clontech), or α-p21 (C-19) polyclonal (Santa Cruz) antibodies. For the dual luciferase reporter assays, H1299 cells were transfected with the constructs indicated in the figure legends and included the Renilla luciferase reporter construct in each sample as an internal control. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer and luciferase activities were determined using a dual specific luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). Isolation of Pure Ubiquitinated p53 from Cells—Monoubiquitination has been purported to be a key signal in the nuclear export of p53 and does not require Mdm2 to mediate the physical transfer from the nucleus to cytoplasm (8Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W. Science. 2003; 302: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the nuclear export signal, a region located within the tetramerization domain of p53, needs to be “unmasked” in order for efficient nuclear export to occur (16Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The unmasking of this domain would therefore occur when p53 was in the form of a monomer or dimer and not when in the tetramer formation. We wished to further explore this idea and the role that monoubiquitination might have in it. Particularly, we sought to isolate true monoubiquitinated p53 and assess its ability to tetramerize. To address this issue, we purified ubiquitinated p53 through a two-step purification method to enrich for monoubiquitinated p53. The first step isolated all ubiquitinated proteins and the second step refined the purification to p53-ubiquitinated protein. 293 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged p53wt, Mdm2, and His-tagged ubiquitin and subjected to two rounds of affinity purification (Fig. 1, A and B). First, all ubiquitinated protein was purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads. The eluate was then dialyzed overnight against BC100. The dialysis procedure was critically important for removing all urea buffer and imidazole and to bring the ubiquitinated protein in balance with a buffer compatible with the M2 anti-FLAG beads. The dialyzed eluate was then subjected to a second round of affinity purification using anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads to purify ubiquitinated p53. Because the cells were not treated with 26 S proteosome inhibitors, the enriched population of purified, ubiquitinated p53 was true monoubiquitinated p53 because this particular form is not recognized and degraded by the 26 S proteasome (Fig. 1C, compare lane 1 versus lane 2). Using this method, polyubiquitinated protein would be freely degraded by the 26 S proteasome leaving an enriched population of monoubiquitinated p53. This double purification method using stringent conditions enables us to obtain a pure sample of the small population of monoubiquitinated p53 that exists among total ubiquitinated protein. Importantly, the purified, ubiquitinated p53 was 100% pure and did not contain any contamination from freeform p53 (Fig. 1C, compare lane 1 versus 2). The migration pattern on SDS-PAGE of the purified protein is similar to that of monoubiquitinated and multi-monoubiquitinated p53 as previously reported (Fig. 1C) (8Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W. Science. 2003; 302: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Ubiquitinated p53 Proteins Can Still Form Tetramers—Once we had obtained a pure sample of monoubiquitinated p53, we wished to analyze its tetramerization properties. It has previously been reported that the tetramerization of p53, a requirement for its activity as a sequence-specific transcription factor, can be assessed using gel-filtration chromatography. When placed on a Superose-12 gel-filtration column using the SMART/HPLC system, wild type p53 in tetramer formation has been reported to elute in a fraction corresponding to 440 kDa when compared with known molecular mass standards including albumin, catalase, adolase, and ferritin (17Friedman P.N. Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Whereas the molecular mass of 440 kDa is not the expected size of a true p53 tetramer, which would be expected to be around 200 kDa, this validated observation has been reported to represent a multimeric species of p53 and occurs for both human and murine forms. Using these known standards for the p53 tetramer, we subjected our purified, ubiquitinated p53 protein to gel-filtration chromatography using a Superose-12 column. The eluted fractions were collected and then resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using a p53-specific monoclonal antibody (DO-1) (Fig. 2B). The molecular weight pattern of purified, ubiquitinated p53 was compared with wild type FLAG-p53 that had been transfected into p53-null H1299 cells and purified by M2 anti-FLAG beads (Fig. 2B, second panel versus first panel). Our elution profile was compared with known size standards consisting of albumin, adolase, catalase, and ferritin (data not shown). The majority of purified, monoubiquitinated p53 protein eluted within fraction 15, which corresponds to 440 kDa based on the molecular size standard. Importantly, this pattern of size distribution matched that of p53wt, with the exception of a smaller amount of protein eluting with fractions 24-26, which corresponds to 232, 158, and 67 kDa, respectively. For monomeric p53 controls, we used two mutants that are unable to tetramerize due to a loss of the tetramerization domain: p531-290 and p53Δ325-354 (see Fig. 2A). These mutants were transfected into H1299 cells and purified using M2 beads. Equal amounts of purified protein were then placed on the column and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The controls eluted within the fractions corresponding to the molecular size of monomeric p53, representing dimer and monomer fractions of p53 that collectively match the pattern of size distribution for p53wt previously reported (17Friedman P.N. Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Together, these results indicated that monoubiquitinated p53 is capable of forming tetramers in vivo. In addition, the molecular mass elution pattern of ubiquitinated p53 matched that of wild type p53 within the fraction corresponding to 440 kDa, indicating that monoubiquitinated p53 can also form multimeric species as previously reported for wild type 53. The Monoubiquitination-mimicking p53 Fusion Protein Can Form Tetramers—We next wanted to examine the tetramerization ability and function of monoubiquitinated p53 more closely. However, the purification of truly monoubiquitinated p53 protein from cells proved very challenging, and further the use of it in biochemical assays was difficult due to technical limitations. To help us better address these issues, we decided to use a monoubiquitination-mimicking p53 fusion protein that has been used in previous studies and shown to mimic the effects of post-translational ubiquitination (Fig. 2A) (8Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W. Science. 2003; 302: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 18Terrell J. Shih S. Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The major Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination sites of p53 are located at the C terminus (19Lohrum M.A. Woods D.B. Ludwig R.L. Balint E. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8521-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 20Nakamura S. Roth J.A. Mukhopadhyay T. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8458-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), so we designed a molecule that mimics monoubiquitinated p53 though the C-terminal fusion of an ubiquitin moiety. This particular approach has been shown to alter the subcellular distribution of p53 and the yeast α-factor in a manner reminiscent of post-translational monoubiquitination (8Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W. Science. 2003; 302: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 18Terrell J. Shih S. Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Indeed, expression of this construct in H1299 cells showed a significant cytoplasmic distribution when compared with wild type p53, although a proportion was retained within the nucleus, similar to that previously reported (Fig. 3A) (8Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W. Science. 2003; 302: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Using this p53 fusion protein, we wished to validate our results with the purified, monoubiquitinated p53 by assessing the tetramerization ability of the fusion protein. To do this, p53-null H1299 cells were transiently transfected with constructs expressing the FLAG-tagged p53wt or the p53 ubiquitin fusion protein and affinity purified using anti-FLAG-agarose beads. The purified protein was then subjected to gel-filtration chromatography using a Superose-12 column in a similar fashion as described above and the eluted fractions resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using the anti-p53 (DO-1) monoclonal antibody (Fig. 3B). When the monoubiquitination-mimicking p53 fusion protein was subjected to the column, the molecular weight elution pattern matched that of wild type p53, indicating that monoubiquitinated p53 has the ability of oligomerizing in vivo (Fig. 3B, compare lane 7 top panel versus bottom panel). These results indicate that the monoubiquitination-mimicking p53 fusion protein could readily form tetramers in vivo in a similar fashion to that of wild type p53. These data also support the findings of the tetramerization abilities of purified, monoubiquitinated p53 from cells and argue against the hypothesis that ubiquitination disrupts p53 tetramer formation. Confirmation of the Tetramerization Ability of the Monoubiquitination-mimicking p53 Fusion Protein Using an Oligomerization Assay—We next wanted to expand our tetramerization analysis further for monoubiquitinated p53. To do this, we took an in vitro approach to assess the ability of the monoubiquitination-mimicking p53 fusion protein to form oligomers in an in vitro oligomerization assay. p53-null H1299 cells were transiently transfected with constructs expressing p53 wild type, the monoubiquitination-mimicking p53 fusion protein, p53 protein fused to GFP, or p53Δ325-254. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested on ice and lysed with the FLAG lysis buffer. The lysates were then incubated with an increasing percentage of gluteraldehyde to covalently cross-link any dimers or tetramers that formed. After incubation, equal protein amounts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using the DO-1 antibody (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the monoubiquitinated p53 fusion protein formed both dimer and tetramer/oligomer populations in a similar pattern as that of p53wt (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 1-3 to 4-6). We used a p53 protein fused with GFP at the C terminus as a control (Fig. 2) to ensure that the addition of a nonspecific bulky adduct did not disrupt tetramer formation (Fig. 4A, lanes 7-9). A mutant p53 protein that lacks the tetramerization domain was included as a negative control and showed no slower migrating species on Western blot (Fig. 4A, lanes 10-12). To further confirm these findings, purified GST-p53-UB protein was also used in the in vitro oligomerization assay (Fig. 4B). This protein also showed a gel migration shift with increasing amounts of gluteraldehyde representing dimers and tetramers/oligomers of the protein. Taken together, the in vitro oligomerization assay indicated that the monoubiquitination-mimicking p53 fusion protein was capable of forming dimers and oligomers in vitro in a similar fashion to that of wild type p53.FIGURE 4The monoubiquitination-mimicking p53 fusion protein can form tetramers in an oligomerization assay. A, equal amounts of total protein were incubated with 0, 0.01%, and 0.1% gluteraldehyde on ice for 30 min and resolved on a 7% SDS-PAGE gel followed by Western blot using anti-p53 (DO-1) antibody. B, the in vitro oligomerization assay was repeated using purified GST-p53-UB protein incubated with increasing amounts of gluteraldehyde and resolved on a 7% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot using DO-1.View Large Image"
https://openalex.org/W2121285236,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive tumour with an abysmal prognosis. These cancers are characteristically resistant to glucocorticoid (Gc) action, owing to impaired expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We identified reduced GR expression in human SCLC cell lines, compared to a non-SCLC cell line. The SCLC cells also showed no Gc inhibition of proliferation, in contrast to non-SCLC cells. Retroviral overexpression of GR resulted in significantly increased cell death, which was partially blocked by the GR antagonist, RU486. Indeed, in cells sorted for GR expression, there was rapid, near complete loss of live cells by 72 h, in contrast to control cells that proliferated as expected. Flow cytometry using Annexin V revealed that cell death was by apoptosis. In addition, confocal analysis of fixed cells showed that cells overexpressing GR displayed a significant increase in fragmenting apoptotic nuclei. Microarray studies showed that transgenic GR expression upregulated the proapoptotic genes, BAD and BAX. We have, therefore, identified a profound apoptotic effect of GR in SCLC cells, which may explain the low levels of endogenous GR in SCLC cells. Understanding how GR overexpression leads to apoptotic cell death in SCLC cells may uncover new therapeutic strategies."

Current evidence suggests that oleamide participates in the biochemical mechanisms underlying the drive to sleep, thermoregulation, and antinociception. Despite the potential importance of oleamide in these physiologic processes, the biochemical pathway for its synthesis in vivo has not been established. We report here the discovery of an oleamide synthetase found in rat tissues using [14C]oleoyl-CoA and ammonium ion. Hydrogen peroxide was subsequently found to be a required cofactor. The enzyme displayed temperature and pH optima in the physiologic range, a remarkable resistance to proteolysis, and specificity for long-chain acyl-CoA substrates. The reaction demonstrated Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km for oleoyl-CoA of 21 μm. Proteomic, biochemical, and immunologic analyses were used to identify the source of the oleamide synthesizing activity as cytochrome c. This identification was based upon peptide mass fingerprinting of isolated synthase protein, a tight correlation between enzymatic activity and immunoreactivity for cytochrome c, and identical functional properties shared by the tissue-derived synthetase and commercially obtained cytochrome c.

Curr. Pharm. Des. 1998; 4: 303-314PubMed Google Scholar). Naturally occurring oleamide was first reported in 1989 as one of five primary fatty acid amides present in human serum (2Arafat E.S. Trimble J.W. Andersen R.N. Dass C. Desiderio D.M. Life Sci. 1989; 45: 1679-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Subsequently oleamide was shown to accumulate in the cerebrospinal fluid of sleep-deprived cats and to produce a profound sleep-like state when administered to rodents (3Lerner R.A. Siuzdak G.

These findings led to the proposal that oleamide directly contributes to the biochemical mechanisms underlying the drive to sleep (3Lerner R.A. Siuzdak G. Prospero-Garcia O. Henriksen S.J. Boger D.L.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8078-8082Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and gap junctions (7Guan X. Cravatt B.F. Ehring G.R. Hall J.E. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. J.

Despite the potential importance of oleamide in the genesis of sleep and other physiologic processes, the biochemical pathway for its synthesis has not been established. In 1996 Sugiura et al. (11Sugiura T. Kondo S. Kodaka T. Tonegawa T. Nakane S. Yamashita A. Ishima Y. Waku K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 40: 931-938PubMed Google Scholar) reported that subcellular fractions of rat brain supported oleamide synthesis from radiolabeled oleic acid and ammonia. While the activity was shown to be heat labile, no identification of the factor(s) was reported. Subsequently, Bisogno et al. (12Bisogno T. Sepe N. De Petrocellis L. Mechoulam R. Di Marzo V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) demonstrated the synthesis of oleamide by cultured mouse neuroblastoma N18TG2 cells and found that the activity was associated with a crude membrane fraction but, again, no definitive identification was reported. In this case, however, inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) 2The abbreviations used are: FAAH, fatty acid amide hydrolase; CoA, coenzyme A; ESI, electrospray ionization; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LDS, lithium dodecyl sulfate; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PAM, peptidylglycine-α-amidating monooxygenase; TLC, thin layer chromatography; TPCK, N-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone. 2The abbreviations used are: FAAH, fatty acid amide hydrolase; CoA, coenzyme A; ESI, electrospray ionization; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LDS, lithium dodecyl sulfate; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PAM, peptidylglycine-α-amidating monooxygenase; TLC, thin layer chromatography; TPCK, N-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone. were found to significantly reduce oleamide synthesis. Accordingly, the authors proposed that the oleamide synthetic activity could be due to an FAAH-like enzyme working in reverse. FAAH is considered the main catabolic mechanism for the inactivation of fatty acid amides including oleamide and the endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide (13Bisogno T. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. Curr. Pharm. Design. 2002; 8: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In 1996, Merkler et al. (14Merkler D.J. Merkler K.A. Stern W. Fleming F.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) demonstrated that peptidylglycine-α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) is capable of catalyzing the synthesis of primary fatty acid amides from fatty N-acylglycines in a manner analogous to its essential role in the generation of biologically active amidated peptide messengers (15Eipper B.A. Stoffers D.A. Mains R.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). More recently, this group has reported on the PAM-dependent synthesis of oleamide from oleic acid in N18TG2 neuroblastoma cells with evidence of oleoylglycine as an intermediate (16Merkler D.J. Chew G.H. Gee A.J. Merkler K.A. Sorondo J.P. Johnson M.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12667-12674Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). While these data provide evidence for the roles of oleoylglycine and PAM in oleamide biosynthesis, data from whole animal studies are lacking. In this regard, we recently reported that administration of N-oleoylglycine produced profound physiologic changes in rodents, yet failed to significantly alter serum levels of oleamide as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (17Chaturvedi S. Driscoll W.J. Elliot B.M. Faraday M.M. Grunberg N.E. Mueller G.P. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2006; 81: 136-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because fatty acids are universally activated as their coenzyme A (CoA) derivatives (18Watkins P.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 55-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that oleoyl-CoA was the immediate precursor of oleamide. Using oleoyl-CoA as substrate to screen for oleamide synthesizing activity, we report here the discovery of an oleamide synthetase in ammonium sulfate fractions of rat liver extract and further characterization of this activity from rat kidney, a more abundant source. The activity was found to be stable to heat denaturation and limited exposure to proteolytic enzymes. Ammonium ion was required for oleamide synthesis and the reaction was significantly enhanced by hydrogen peroxide. The activity displayed a physiologic temperature and pH optimum, specificity for long-chain acyl-CoA substrates and a Km for oleoyl-CoA of 21 μm. Proteomic, biochemical, and immunologic analyses were used to definitively identify the source of the oleamide synthase activity as cytochrome c. Radiochemicals—[1-14C]Oleamide (50.5 mCi/mmol) was prepared as a custom synthesis by New England Nuclear Life Science Products, Boston, MA and repurified for use in-house by reverse phase HPLC as described below. [1-14C]Oleoyl-CoA (53 mCi/mmol) was purchased from GE Healthcare (Amersham Biosciences), Piscataway, NJ. Preparation of Tissue Extract—Tissues collected from adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) following CO2 euthanasia were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at –80 °C until processed further. All manipulations were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. Tissue extracts were prepared in 5 volumes (gm/ml) of homogenization buffer (70 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 170 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA) as follows: coarsely minced tissue was processed by Polytron (Brinkman Instruments, Rexdale, Ont., Canada) for 20 s at power setting 6 followed by glass/Teflon homogenization (five up and down strokes). The crude homogenate was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The clear high speed supernatant was used for ammonium sulfate fraction, described below, or heat denaturation as follows: 10-ml aliquots of the high speed supernatant were placed in 16 × 150 mm glass tubes, immersed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and then chilled on ice. The resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant collected and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were estimated by BCA assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Ammonium Sulfate Fractionation—The 100,000 × g supernatant of rat liver homogenate was fractionated with ammonium sulfate by the addition of a 100% saturated solution (prepared in water, pH adjusted to 7.0 with ammonium hydroxide) in volumes determined to give the desired final percent saturation. The solutions were maintained at 4 °C with periodic mixing for 20 min. The resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min and the supernatant stored at –80 °C. Reverse Phase HPLC—Chromatography for both protein and lipid separations was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a series 1100 HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and 4.6 × 250 mm Luna 5μ C18 columns (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). For protein chromatography the system was operated at ambient temperature and column was equilibrated with 97.5% solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 2.5% acetonitrile in water) and 2.5% solvent B (0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). Following sample injection, initial conditions were maintained for 5 min followed by a linear gradient to 92.5% B over 22.5 min. The system was maintained at 92.5% B for 2.5 min and then returned to initial conditions. Lipid chromatography was performed at an operating temperature of 45 °C. Samples and standards were solubilized in ethanol for injection. The column was equilibrated with 50% water/acetonitrile. Upon sample injection a linear gradient was developed over the next 10 min to 100% acetonitrile. The system was maintained at 100% acetonitrile for 10 min and returned to initial conditions over 5 min. Elution profiles were monitored at 280 nm and 214 nm and, additionally for lipids, at 205 nm. Fractions were collected manually and dried either by lyophilization or under a gentle stream of nitrogen. Assay for Oleamide Synthesizing Activity and Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)—Assays for oleamide synthesis were performed in 1.7 ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes in a total reaction volume of 100 μl containing 5 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 7.4, the desired amount of NH4Cl from a 5 m stock solution prepared in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 and [14C]oleoyl-CoA supplemented with non-radioactive oleoyl-CoA added from a 25 mm stock solution prepared in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0 and stored at –80 °C. Distilled water was added to standardize the volume. Reactions were initiated with the addition of sample protein and carried out at 37 °C for the desired time. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 1 n HCl and extracted with 4 volumes of ethyl acetate with vigorous vortexing. Following brief centrifugation, the upper organic layer was transferred to a clean tube and dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen. The dried samples were solubilized in 25 μl of ethanol and spotted to the preadsorbent zone of channeled 20 × 20 cm (19 lanes) 250 μ Silica Gel G Uniplates™ (Analtech, Newark, DE) and air-dried. To obtain consistent chromatography, plates were desiccated for 30–45 min in a drying oven at 95 °C and cooled to room temperature prior to sample application. [14C]Oleamide standard (5,000–10,000 dpm) was spotted in lanes adjacent to samples. TLC plates were developed in an air-tight glass chamber for 1–1.5 h using either a basic solvent system of chloroform/methanol/water/ammonium hydroxide, 90:10:1:0.02 or an acidic solvent system of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid, 90:10:1. The plates were then air-dried, enclosed in cellophane and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen for 16–36 h. Screens were scanned with a Typhoon Variable Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Data were visualized and quantified with Multi Gauge V3.0 software (FUJIFILM, Stamford, CT). For some experiments, data are expressed in arbitrary units which reflect signal intensity output by the Multi Gauge software. Non-radioactive fatty acyl-CoA derivatives, 3% H2O2, bovine catalase, bovine hemoglobin, equine myoglobin, and rat cytochrome c (≥95% purity) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The purity of the rat cytochrome c preparation was verified in-house by HPLC, silver-stained SDS-PAGE, and MALDI-TOF MS. Treatment with Proteolytic Enzymes—Enzymes and inhibitors were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Proteolytic digestions with thermolysin and trypsin were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, respectively. Protein solutions were digested with enzyme at ratios between 40:1 and 85:1 (wt/wt) depending on the experiment. Digestions were stopped with 1:50 (v/v) addition of phosphoramidon (30 μm in water) or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (30 mg/ml in isopropyl alcohol) for thermolysin and trypsin, respectively. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis for Oleamide—Mass analysis was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry using a Voyager™ MALDI-TOF DE STR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Lyophilized samples were resolubilized in acetonitrile and mixed with an equal volume of gentisic acid matrix (Sigma-Aldrich) prepared at 10 mg/ml in acetonitrile and spotted to the MALDI plate. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion reflectron mode with delayed extraction (150 ns) at an accelerating voltage of 20,000 V, a grid voltage of 70%, and a guidewire voltage of 0%. The instrument was calibrated using oleamide standard ([M + H]+ = 282.4845 m/z), 25 ng spotted with matrix as above. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE) and Silver Staining—Proteins were solubilized in 1× NuPAGE™ LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) containing 5 mm dithiothreitol, heated to 70 °C for 10 min and resolved in precast 1.0-mm thick NuPAGE™ Bis-Tris 4–12% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) using MES running buffer (50 mm MES, 50 mm Tris base, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA). Protein molecular weight markers were from Fermentas, Hanover, MD. Proteins were visualized by silver staining with SilverQuest staining kit (Invitrogen). Protein Identification by Peptide Mass Fingerprinting—Protein identifications were assigned on the basis of peptide mass fingerprinting performed as described previously (19Muth E. Driscoll W.J. Smalstig A. Goöping G. Mueller G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein bands stained with Coomassie Blue G-250 were excised from the gel, destained, equilibrated with ammonium bicarbonate buffer, reduced and alkylated, and digested overnight at 37 °C with TPCK-modified sequence-grade trypsin (Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). Peptides were extracted and lyophilized to dryness. Digests were resolubilized in α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid matrix (Sigma-Aldrich) prepared at 10 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and spotted together with 50 fmol of bradykinin and 150 fmol of adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 18–39 as internal calibrants. The peptide mass data were used to query the NCBI rodent protein sequence data base accessed through Protein-Prospector MS-Fit search engine (20Clauser K.R. Baker P.R. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Palmitoyl-CoA Affinity Chromatography—A 300-μl aliquot of 50% slurry of palmitoyl-CoA agarose resin (Sigma) was placed in a 1.7 ml of polypropylene microcentrifuge tube and washed three times with an equal volume of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 by vortexing and centrifugation. Lyophilized samples of HPLC-purified rat kidney oleamide synthesizing activity were routinely reconstituted in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 to a protein concentration of 200 μg/ml. A 220-μl aliquot of this preparation, containing 44 μg of total protein, was treated with thermolysin (500 ng in 5 μl) for 30 min at 37 °C. The digestion was stopped with the addition phosphoramidon (5 μl of 30 μm stock in water), and aliquots of the digest were set aside for enzymatic assay and Western blotting. The remainder (170 μl) was applied to the washed affinity resin and incubated on ice for 2 h with intermittent mixing. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was collected, and the resin washed five times with 300 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The resin was eluted with 170 μl of 666 mm NaCl in 50% methanol/10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 and intermittent vortexing over 15 min at room temperature. The eluate was separated from the resin by centrifugation and collected. Aliquots of the eluate were lyophilized and reconstituted with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 for activity measurements and immunoblot analysis. Western Blotting—Proteins resolved by PAGE (described above) were transferred to Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using 15% methanol in transfer buffer (25 mm Bicine, 25 mm Bis-Tris, and 1 mm EDTA). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.8% NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20 (Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20, TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer. This antibody recognizes denatured cytochrome c from human, rat, mouse, horse, and pigeon. Following extensive washing with TBS-T, membranes were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature in sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer. Membranes were washed extensively with TBS-T, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL plus Western blotting Detection System, Amersham Biosciences). Detection of Oleamide Synthesizing Activity—Oleamide synthesis was first observed when supernatants of high percentage ammonium sulfate fractions of rat liver extract were incubated with [14C]oleoyl-CoA. Panel A of Fig. 1 presents a representative TLC analysis of the reaction products observed. Radioactive bands (arrow at left) that co-migrated with [14C]oleamide standard (center lane) were readily evident at ammonium sulfate cuts greater than 50% saturation. Additionally, heating to 95 °C prior to assay resulted in a small increase in oleamide synthesizing activity with a concomitant decrease in other reaction products (visualized in the lower one-third of the TLC plate). A time course performed with the heat-treated 95% saturated ammonium sulfate fraction (Fig. 1, panel B) demonstrated maximum oleamide synthesis by ∼10 min. Further investigation revealed that ammonium chloride could be effectively substituted for ammonium sulfate in producing oleamide synthetic activity in the absence of the profound protein precipitation resulting from ammonium sulfate. Heating, however, consistently increased the putative oleamide signal and was therefore incorporated as a step in the routine preparation of extracts. A preliminary analysis of the tissue distribution of oleamide synthetic activity revealed higher levels in kidney as compared with liver, brain, muscle, or adipose tissue. Accordingly, all subsequent work was carried out using rat kidney. Initial Characterization of Oleamide Synthesizing Activity—Early in this investigation it was observed that oleamide synthesizing activity in heated kidney extract could be purified and concentrated by reverse phase HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Accordingly, this step was incorporated into the sample preparation for all subsequent experiments. An analysis of the temperature dependence for the oleamide synthesizing activity revealed an optimum between 35 °C and 50 °C, and all subsequent analyses were therefore performed at 37 °C. Fig. 2 presents data further characterizing the HPLC-purified oleamide synthesizing activity from rat kidney. It is evident that the generation of oleamide product was dependent upon the presence of tissue protein (lane 2) and ammonium ion (lane 4) at neutral pH (lane 5). Additionally, the reaction required oleoyl-CoA as substrate and did not utilize oleic acid (lane 8). Unexpectedly, the activity survived treatment with two proteolytic enzymes, thermolysin and trypsin (lanes 6 and 7). In fact, pretreatment with these proteases consistently increased the oleamide synthetic activity in partially purified samples. Similar treatment with other proteolytic enzymes (chymotrypsin, endoproteinase glu-C, and elastase), neither increased nor decreased oleamide synthesizing activity. Verification of Oleamide as the Reaction Product—The authenticity of the putative oleamide product was established by mass spectral analysis. Reaction product was purified by reverse phase HPLC from a large-scale synthesis using nonradioactive oleoyl-CoA (Fig. 3, panel A). The fraction eluting with the retention time of oleamide standard (16.3 min) was collected, dried, reconstituted with gentisic acid matrix, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 3, panel B). The most prominent peak in the spectrum at m/z 282.5 is the correct mass for oleamide ([M + H]+ = 282.4845) and was not present in negative control reactions. ESI MS/MS fragmentation analysis of the m/z 282.5 parent ion produced a spectrum identical to that for oleamide standard (not shown). Additionally, when [14C]oleoyl-CoA reaction products were fractionated by HPLC, a radioactive band that co-migrated precisely with [14C]oleamide standard on TLC was observed (Fig. 3, panel C, lane 4). The authenticity of the oleamide enzymatic product was further confirmed using an alternate TLC solvent system (data not shown; see “Experimental Procedures” for details). These results provide strong evidence that oleamide is indeed a product of the reaction of oleoyl-CoA, ammonium ion, and a tissue-derived catalytic factor. Identification of the Oleamide Synthesizing Activity as Cytochrome c—The stability of the catalytic activity to proteolytic digestion provided a means to reduce the complexity of the sample and identify the activity as cytochrome c. The HPLC-purified activity was digested with thermolysin and re-chromatographed using the same HPLC conditions. As shown in Fig. 4, panel A, the fraction containing the greatest activity eluted at 17.5–18.0 min (fraction 7), and was separated from the majority of the protein, which eluted earlier in the profile as visualized by silver stained SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 4, panel B). Inspection of lanes 6 and 7 revealed that only one protein band coordinately correlated more intense silver staining with increased activity between fractions 6 and 7 (band II). Identification of the four bands in lanes 6 and 7 indicated by arrows was accomplished by peptide mass fingerprinting using in-gel tryptic digestion and MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Table 1 summarizes these data with the identification of band II as somatic cytochrome c. Bands I, III, and IV were identified as superoxide dismutase, acyl-CoA-binding protein and ubiquitin, respectively. These identities were further confirmed by electrospray and time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry.TABLE 1Identification of protein bands by in-gel tryptic peptide mass fingerprintingBandIdentificationAccession no.MrNo. peptides matched% CoverageMOWSEaMolecular weight search. scoreISuperoxide dismutaseP0763215,9128496.5e + 05IICytochrome c, somaticP6289711,60612644.4e + 04IIIAcyl-CoA-binding proteinP1103010,0287674.7e + 05IVUbiquitinP681988,5656802.5e + 04a Molecular weight search. Open table in a new tab Oleamide Synthesizing Activity and Cytochrome c Immunoreactivity Are Coincident through Palmitoyl-CoA Affinity Chromatography—To further characterize the oleamide synthesizing activity from rat kidney extract, affinity chromatography was performed using palmitoyl-CoA agarose resin. In the absence of an oleoyl-CoA affinity resin, we reasoned that the catalytic activity might interact with the closely related palmitoyl-CoA affinity resin, which was commercially available. Activity assays for oleamide synthesis and Western blot analysis for cytochrome c (Fig. 4, panels C and D, respectively) were used to demonstrate that the catalytic activity and immunoreactive cytochrome c, indeed, partitioned in a parallel manner through palmitoyl-CoA affinity chromatography. 89 percent of the total applied catalytic activity adsorbed to the resin and 72 percent of this was recovered in the resin eluate (lane 4). 11 percent of the applied activity was not retained by the resin (lane 5). The immunoblot analysis of these same fractions (Fig. 4, panel D) showed that the signal intensity for cytochrome c closely paralleled the oleamide synthesizing activity of the samples. The characteristic increase in catalytic activity and modest reduction in immunoreactivity following thermolysin treatment is evident by comparing lanes 2 and 3. Similar experiments that examined HPLC fractions, such as those presented in panel A of Fig. 4, also demonstrated a precise correlation between cytochrome c immunoreactivity and oleamide synthesizing activity (not shown). These data strongly support the conclusion that cytochrome c is the oleamide synthesizing activity in rat kidney extract. Oleamide Synthesizing Characteristics of Cytochrome c Are Identical to Those of Rat Kidney Activity—Fig. 5A presents data characterizing the oleamide synthesizing activity of commercially obtained rat cytochrome c. The conditions employed replicated those presented in Fig. 2 for the rat kidney extract. The catalytic propertie"

Here we report that heparin can specifically enhance recombinant sFRP-1 accumulation in a cell type-specific manner. The effect requires O-sulfation in heparin, and involves fibroblast growth factor-2 as well as fibroblast growth factor receptor-1. Interestingly, further investigation uncovers that heparin can also affect the post-translational modification of sFRP-1. We demonstrate that sFRP-1 is post-translationally modified by tyrosine sulfation at tyrosines 34 and 36, which is inhibited by the treatment of heparin. The results suggest that accumulation of sFRP-1 induced by heparin is in part due to the relative stabilization of unsulfated sFRP-1 and the direct stabilization by heparin.

One is that heparin can stimulate sFRP-1 accumulation in a cell type-specific manner. The effect involves FGF-2 and FGF receptor-1. Surprisingly we also find that heparin can affect the post-translational modification of sFRP-1, which induces a mobility shift of the protein on SDS-PAGE. Further study shows that sFRP-1 is tyrosine-sulfated at tyrosines 34 and 36, and heparin treatment inhibits the modification. The data suggests that direct stabilization by heparin and the relative stabilization of unsulfated sFRP-1 contribute partly to the accumulation of sFRP-1 induced by heparin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Cell Culture—All mammalian cell lines (HEK293, CHO, and Lec3.2.8.1) were grown and maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HEK293 cells were cultured in free-style 293 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). CHO-DUKX stable lines were grown in α media containing 10% FBS and 200 nm methotrexate (MTX). HEK293 stable lines were cultured in α media containing 10% FBS and 100 nm MTX. Lec3.2.8.1 stable lines were maintained in glutamine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS and 25 μm methionine sulfoximine.DNA Constructs—For sFRP-1 DNA constructs, C-terminal His6 tags and the mutation V312L/F313E/ΔK314 were incorporated into PCR primers before the stop codon. The PCR products were digested with SalI and EcoRI. The gel-purified DNA fragments were subcloned into pSMED2 (resulted pWZ1028), pSMEDA (resulted pWZ1049), or pSMEG (resulted pWZ1097) behind a murine cytomegalovirus promoter. For expressing C-terminal His6-tagged Agg-2-His6, C-terminal FLAG-tagged Agg-1-E362Q-A520 (pWZ1071), or C-terminal FLAG-tagged Agg-1-A520 (pWZ1072), PCR fragments digested with SalI and XbaI were subcloned into pSMEDA vector. sFRP-1 mutants Y36F (pWZ1134), Y34F (pWZ1143), and Y34F/Y36F (pWZ1148), were generated with the Stratagene mutagenesis kit in pWZ1049. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing.Transient and Stable Expression—Transient expression was performed in either 50-ml spinners or 1-liter spinners. For the 50-ml culture volume, 25 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 400 μg of polyethylenimine (25 kDa, linear, neutralized to pH 7.0 by HCl, 1 mg/ml, Polysciences (Warrington, PA)) in 2.5 ml of serum-free 293 media. For the 1-liter volume, 500 μg of DNA was mixed with 4 mg of polyethylenimine in 50 ml of serum-free 293 media. Then the mixtures were mixed with either 50 ml or 1 liter of HEK293 cells in 293 media with 5% FBS at a cell density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. The spinners were incubated at 37 °C with a rotation rate of 170 rpm on a P2005 Stirrer (Bellco) for 72-144 h before harvest.For the establishment of CHO-DUKX sFRP-1 stable lines, construct pWZ1028 was transfected into CHO-DUKX cells and the transfectomas were selected against 50, 100, or 200 nm MTX for 3 weeks. After screening 72 colonies, three 200 nm MTX-resistant clones (200-10, -11, -12) with the highest expression of sFRP-1 were isolated. In this study, HEK293 cells were also found to be sensitive to MTX at concentrations of 100 nm and above, even though they have two copies of the dihydrofolate reductase gene. To construct a HEK293 stable line for sFRP-1, pWZ1028 was transfected into HEK293-EBNA and transfectomas were selected against 100 or 250 nm MTX for 3 weeks. The two best clones, 100-5 and 100-20, were then isolated. To establish Lec3.2.8.1 stable lines for sFRP-1, pWZ1097 was transfected into Lec3.2.8.1 and the transfectomas were selected against 10 or 25 μm methionine sulfoximine for 3 weeks. Several positive clones were isolated.Immunoblotting, Antibodies, and Chemicals—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (29Zhong X. Kriz R. Seehra J. Kumar R. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Anti-His4 antibody (Qiagen) was used at 0.2 μg/ml. Rabbit polyclonal anti-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-1 and anti-FGFR-2 were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant human FGF-1 (acidic) and FGF-2 (basic) were purchased from Sigma. Heparin, N-desulfated, N-acetylated heparin, and 2-O-desulfated heparin were purchased from Sigma. Endo H and PNGase F were purchased from New England Biolabs.Protein Purification—The conditioned media containing sFRP-1-(His6) from HEK293 cells or from Lec3.2.8.1 cells was supplemented with NaCl to 1 m final concentration and equilibrated with nickel-NTA (Qiagen) resin at 4 °C for about 1 h. The nickel-NTA resin was collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g (Sorvall H-6000A/HBB-6), suspended in 1 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, and packed into a column (GE Healthcare). After extensive washing with 1 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5 (buffer A), and buffer A plus 15 mm imidazole, sFRP-1-(His6) protein was eluted with buffer A plus 200 mm imidazole. The partially purified sFRP-1 was concentrated to about 2 ml using 10K MWCO concentrators (Vivascience) and applied to a Superdex™ 200 size exclusion column (SEC) (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in Buffer A. The protein concentration of the SEC fractions containing sFRP-1 was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using the calculated extinction coefficient.Metabolic Labeling—Stable Lec3.2.8.1 cells for sFRP-1-(His6) (25-6) were grown to confluence and switched to a low sulfate RPMI medium (specialty medium), supplemented with 10% FBS. Before sulfate incorporation experiments, cells were pretreated or mock-treated with sodium chlorate for 3 h. 50 μCi/ml of [35S]sulfate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was incubated with cells in the presence or absence of heparin (50 μg/ml) for 18 h. For labeling in transient HEK293-EBNA expression, cells at 24 h post-transfection were resuspended into labeling medium with [35S]sulfate for 18 h as above. sFRP-1-(His6) in the conditioned media were affinity purified by passing through a small nickel-NTA column.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from HEK293 cells using RNAqueous (Ambion). 10 μg of RNA was resolved by 1.1% agarose, 2% formaldehyde, MOPS gel electrophoresis, blotted onto Nytran Supercharge membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) with 8× SSC, and hybridized overnight at 50 °C with digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes in DIG easy Hyb solution (Roche). After washing at 60 °C (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, the membranes were blocked in Blocking reagent (Roche) for 30 min, and probed with alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche) for 30 min and with Tris saline buffer, 0.3% Tween 20. Signals were visualized with Supersignal (Pierce). Probes were generated by PCR using digoxigenin-labeled nucleotides (Roche).RESULTSHeparin Specifically Stimulates Recombinant sFRP-1 Accumulation in HEK293 Cells—A DNA construct expressing a C-terminal His6-tagged sFRP-1 was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, and between 72 and 120 h, sFRP-1 was detected in the media, although at relatively low levels (Fig. 1A, lanes 1). As part of an effort to increase the expression of sFRP-1 for planned structure/function studies, heparin was tested as an additive to the cell culture media at various times during transfection. Adding heparin at the time of transfection reduced sFRP-1 expression to undetectable levels, most likely a result of the negatively charged heparin binding strongly to the polyanionic polyethylenimine thus interfering with the DNA uptake process (data not shown). Nevertheless, adding heparin 24 or 48 h after transfection significantly enhanced sFRP-1 accumulation in the media (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3). When the cell pellets were analyzed, intracellular sFRP-1 was also accumulated with the treatment of heparin (lane 4 versus 5 and 6). We then tested various concentrations of heparin to determine the optimum concentration for sFRP-1 accumulation. As can be seen in Fig. 1B, heparin at concentrations above 5 μg/ml gave the highest sFRP-1 induction levels, whereas higher levels of heparin resulted in slightly lower sFRP-1 accumulation. Interestingly, under similar expression conditions, the unrelated secreted human proteins aggrecanase I and II (30Glasson S.S. Askew R. Sheppard B. Carito B. Blanchet T. Ma H.L. Flannery C.R. Peluso D. Kanki K. Yang Z. Majumdar M.K. Morris E.A. Nature. 2005; 434: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar) did not show heparin inducible accumulation (Fig. 1C). Collectively, the results indicate that heparin specifically stimulates both extracellular and intracellular sFRP-1 accumulation in HEK293 cells.Purified sFRP-1 Is Biologically Active—To determine whether the enhancement of sFRP-1 by heparin affects biological activity, sFRP-1 produced by HEK293 cells was purified. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” 1 liter of conditioned medium from heparin-induced transient expression of sFRP-1 was prepared. NaCl was added to the conditioned medium at a final concentration of 1 m and sFRP-1 was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” During the purification process, 1 m NaCl was included in all washing or elution buffers. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, sFRP-1 was substantially pure after nickel-NTA (Fig. 2, A, left panel, and B, lanes 1 and 2), and was nearly homogeneous after the Superdex 200 SEC column (Fig. 2, A, right panel, and B, lanes 3 and 4). The sFRP-1 final yield was about 1 mg/liter and runs as an apparent monomer by analytical SEC analysis (Fig. 2A, right panel). N-terminal sequencing confirmed the identity of sFRP-1 and ESI-MS analysis revealed a heterogeneous and higher than expected mass that was assumed to be a result of N-linked glycosylation at two potential sites, Asn172 and Asn262 (data not shown).FIGURE 2Purified sFRP-1 is biologically active. A, protein elution profiling. Conditioned media from transfected 293 cells were passed through the nickel-NTA column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The nickel-purified materials were further purified by the Superdex 200 size exclusion column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, Coomassie Blue-stained gel of purified sFRP-1-(His6). Protein samples after nickel-NTA or Superdex 200 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reduced (lanes 1 and 3) or non-reduced conditions (lanes 2 and 4). C, Wnt-3 antagonistic activity of purified sFRP-1. Wnt3 antagonistic assays with U2OS cells transfected with TCF-luciferase were performed as described in Ref. 31Bhat R.A. Stauffer B. Komm B.S. Bodine P.V. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 37: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the purified sFRP-1 protein was biologically active, the Wnt3 antagonistic activity of sFRP-1 was measured in a functional cell-based assay (31Bhat R.A. Stauffer B. Komm B.S. Bodine P.V. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 37: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this assay, U2OS cells were co-transfected with a β-galactosidase-expressing plasmid, a Wnt3-expressing plasmid, as well as a reporter plasmid containing 16 copies of TCF DNA-binding sites placed in a reverse orientation upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter and the luciferase gene. Then the cells were treated with various amounts of protein samples in the medium for 20 h. The cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. The luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency with β-galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig. 2C, Wnt3 increased the TCF luciferase reporter gene expression in the transfected U2OS cells. The addition of either nickel-NTA-purified sFRP-1 or SEC-purified sFRP-1 decreased the Wnt-mediated response in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the buffer had no effect on the Wnt-mediated TCF-luciferase reporter activation. These data clearly demonstrate that the purified sFRP-1 is functional.Heparin Induction of sFRP-1 Expression Is Cell-type Specific and Requires Heparin O-Sulfation—In addition to transient expression of sFRP-1 in HEK293 cells, stable CHO lines expressing sFRP-1 production were also established. Stable clones of CHO-Dukx cells were obtained by methotrexate selection and screened for sFRP-1 expression by immunoblotting, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Three clones (200-10, 200-11, and 200-12) were isolated that expressed sFRP-1 at ∼50% lower levels than observed in HEK293 transient expression without heparin induction. sFRP-1 produced in CHO cells migrated at a higher apparent Mr than sFRP-1 from HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-6 versus 7), which is likely due to more extensive N-linked carbohydrate modification in CHO cells. To determine whether heparin can also stimulate sFRP-1 accumulation in CHO cell lines, 90% confluent monolayers were treated with 50 μg/ml of heparin. Conditioned medium was harvested at 72 h post-treatment and analyzed for sFRP-1 expression by Western blot analysis. Interestingly, the expression of sFRP-1 in CHO cells was not induced by heparin (Fig. 3A, lane 1 versus 2; lane 3 versus 4; lane 5 versus 6). Similar results were also obtained when conditioned media were harvested at 96 h post-treatment with heparin (data not shown). Clearly the response to heparin in CHO cells is different from that in the HEK293 transient expression experiments and suggests a cell type-specific mechanism.FIGURE 3Heparin effect is cell-type specific and requires heparin O-sulfation. A, heparin cannot stimulate sFRP-1 accumulation in CHO cells. sFRP-1-(His6) expressing CHO stable lines were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were mock-treated or treated with 50 μg/ml of heparin for 72 h. Conditioned media (C.M.) were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-His4 antibody. Lane 7 shows non-heparin treated transient HEK293 expression and relates to Fig. 1A, lane 1. B, heparin can stimulate sFRP-1 accumulation in a HEK293 stable line. A stable line of sFRP-1-(His6) in HEK293 cell was generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were treated or mock-treated with 50 μg/ml of heparin. Conditioned media were collected at different time points. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-His4 antibody. C, effects of modified heparins. sFRP-1 transfected HEK293 cells were left untreated (-) or incubated for 72 h with heparin, or N-desulfated, N-acetylated heparin (dN-heparin), or 2-O-desulfated heparin (dO-heparin), all at 50 μg/ml. Medium samples were collected and analyzed for immunoblotting with anti-His4 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To rule out the possibility that heparin-induced sFRP-1 accumulation was unique to transient expression in HEK293 cells, a stable line of HEK293 expressing sFRP-1 was established as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The stable line was treated with heparin and conditioned media were collected at different time points and sFRP-1 levels were determined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3B, the expression of sFRP-1 in this line responded to heparin at 48 h (lane 4 versus 3) and the effect increased with a longer incubation (lanes 6 and 8). The data clearly indicated that heparin induces sFRP-1 accumulation in both transient and stable HEK293 systems. The enhancement effect by heparin on sFRP-1 appears to be cell-type specific.The interaction of heparin-binding proteins with HS is determined by the sequence and sulfation level of the sugar moieties of HS (32Salmivirta M.

To test whether O-sulfation and N-sulfation are required for heparin activity in sFRP-1 accumulation, sFRP-1-transfected HEK293 cells were incubated with chemically modified heparin that was completely N-desulfated, followed by N-acetylation. Modified heparin lacking 2-O-sulfation was also examined for its ability to stimulate sFRP-1 accumulation. As shown in Fig. 3C, 2-O-desulfated heparin did not stimulate sFRP-1 accumulation (lane 4). In contrast, N-desulfated heparin (lane 3) and native heparin (lane 2) both induced sFRP-1 accumulation, suggesting that O-sulfation but not N-sulfation was necessary for the induction effect.Heparin Does Not Affect Protein Release from the Cell Surface Matrix or mRNA Level of sFRP-1—Heparin is known to release or extract extracellular proteins such as Wnts from the cell surface matrix (3Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). To test whether the heparin effect is simply a competitive binding effect with cell surface proteoglycans, a whole cell sFRP-1 binding study was performed. As shown in Fig. 4A, purified His6-tagged sFRP-1 was incubated with HEK293 cells in cultured media in either the presence or absence of heparin. The concentration of sFRP-1 was at 1 μg/ml,"

It is essential for maintenance of the complex cytoarchitecture of the glomerular filtration barrier within the kidney. In this study, three novel splice isoforms of FAT1 with important functional differences in comparison with wild-type FAT1, FAT1(WT), were identified. The novel variants contained additional short peptide sequences at a specific site of the cytoplasmic domain (+12 or +32 or +8 amino acids, the latter resulting in a premature stop codon). FAT1(+12) was expressed in all peripheral tissues together with FAT1(WT), whereas FAT1(+32) and -(+8TR) were brain-specific. At the subcellular level, exclusively FAT1(WT) was localized along the cellular leading edge, whereas spliced FAT1 isoforms were confined to intercellular junctions. A shift of FAT1(WT) expression toward a predominance of FAT1(+12) was observed in migratory versus quiescent cells. A similar shift was observed in vivo when glomeruli from healthy individuals were compared with those from patients affected by glomerulonephritis. At the molecular level, the differential subcellular localization of FAT1 isoforms was mediated by a novel region harboring a phosphotyrosine-binding-like motif (DN_XYH), which was disrupted by the peptide inserts in the alternative splice variants. Overexpression of FAT1(WT) or specific knockdown of spliced FAT1 isoforms resulted in formation of cellular protrusions or increased wound healing, respectively. In summary, FAT1(WT) is the only FAT1 isoform located along the cellular leading edge. Only FAT1(WT) is up-regulated in migration, induces cellular process formation when overexpressed, and is necessary for efficient wound healing.

FAT cadherins are large ∼500-kDa transmembrane proteins with an extracellular domain containing 34 cadherin motifs and a cytoplasmic domain that harbors several protein interaction motifs (1Tanoue T.

Consistently, genetic inactivation of FAT1 in mice leads to loss of podocyte foot processes in the kidney, which are highly dynamic actin-based structures forming a specialized intercellular junction, termed slit diaphragm (8Ciani L.

In this study, several novel splice isoforms of FAT1 were identified and characterized. Plasmid Constructs—FAT1(WT)mito encoded the fusion protein as follows: N′-3xFLAG-mouse FAT1 cytoplasmic domain (GenBank™ accession number AY256848)-mitochondrial outer membrane targeting sequence from ActA-C′ in the backbone of p3xFLAG-CMV-10 as described (2Moeller M.J.

FAT1 deletion and point mutants of this plasmid were generated using HindIII/XbaI sites by standard PCR mutagenesis. Constructs FAT1(1-184)mito, FAT1(1-190)mito, and FAT1(1-204)mito contained an additional artificially generated spacer (SYPYDLGTWLNIDGFHMS) between FAT1 and ActA.

FAT1(+98)mito was obtained by inserting into the NheI site of FAT1(+3)mito a spacer encoding a portion of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase homolog FRAP (95 aa; XbaI/SpeI-digested from pC4-RHE; Ariad, Cambridge, MA). A similar construct containing FKBP (109 aa, XbaI/SpeI-digested from pC4EN-F1; Ariad) yielded identical results when expressed in mammalian cells (i.e. no mitochondrial rearrangement; data not shown). FAT1(+12+DDN) was generated using FAT1(+12)mito as template and the internal primers fwd 5′-acgcgatgacaatgggtaccactgggat-3′ and rev 5′-cccattgtcatcgcgtggcttgctcaagtc-3′. The controls Dhs-mito and 2xFKBP-mito were generated by shuffling the cytoplasmic domain of murine Dachsous (∼340 aa, from GenBank™ accession number XM_194371) and of 2xFKBP (∼220 aa, from pC4M-F2E, Ariad) 5′ of the mitochondrial outer membrane targeting sequence from ActA into p3xFLAG-CMV-10. For the FAT1(WT)ΔCad encoded, N′-IgG leader sequence (MGWSCIILFLVATATGVHSS)-FLAG-mouse full-length FAT1 aa 3568-4590 (GenBank™ accession number AY598447)-C′ was used. For its generation, FAT1 IMAGE clone IMAGp998D0310967QQ1 nucleotides 3-3074 (GenBank™ accession number BC036134) were PCR-amplified and inserted into SmaI/SalI-digested pEF-DHFR-MT102 (12Mack M. Riethmuller G. Kufer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7021-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). FAT1(Δ160-188)ΔCad was generated by PCR mutagenesis. RT-PCR from Mouse Tissues and Cultured Cells—Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissues using Tri-Reagent® and from cultured cells using RNeasy mini® columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcription of 2-5 μg of RNA, PCR protocols, and β-actin primers have been described (13Braun G.S. Veh R.W. Segerer S. Horster M.F. Huber S.M. Pfluegers Arch. 2002; 445: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). FAT1 primers were directed against mouse nucleotides 370-389 (fwd) and 561-580 (rev) (GenBank™ accession number AY254868), and against corresponding nucleotide stretches of rat and human FAT1 sequences (GenBank™ accession number AF100960 and NM_005245, respectively). Representative FAT1-PCR products were subcloned into pBlunt-PCR® (Invitrogen) and sequenced. For quantitative mRNA expression analysis, PCR bands were recorded using digital imaging (INTAS, Goöttingen, Germany) and analyzed using Labimage software (Kapelan, Halle, Germany). Real Time RT-PCR from Human Biopsies—Glomeruli from human biopsies were collected in the framework of the European Renal cDNA Bank consortium and manually dissected; mRNA was prepared and reverse-transcribed, and real time PCR was performed on a TaqMan ABI 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) as described (14Schmid H.

The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase PCR product and 18 S RNA served as internal standards, yielding comparable results (not shown). FAT1-specific primers (300 nm) and probes (100 nm) were as follows: fwd 5′-tccctgagctccttcca-3′, rev 5′-cgcttggcatccaatctga-3′, internal probe for FAT1(WT) 5′-cgtgcgatgacaatgggtatcactgg-3′, and internal probe for FAT1(+12) 5′-aatgaatctttggctgctcctgacctca-3′.

Antibodies—FAT1(+12)-specific polyclonal antiserum was raised in two rats and one guinea pig against a synthetic peptide “CNKEESLAAPDLSKPRGYH” N′-terminally fused to the antigenic protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antiserum was centrifuged and used in dilutions of 1/50 for IF and of 1/500 for Western blot. Control preadsorption was done overnight at 4 °C (Western blot, 8 μg of peptide/μl of pure serum; IF, 8-800 μg of peptide/μl of pure serum). Other primary antibodies were used at indicated dilutions as follows: previously described mouse α-FAT1(cyto) (2Moeller M.J. Soofi A. Braun G.S. Li X. Watzl C. Kriz W. Holzman L.B.

Secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescence dyes Cy2 and Cy3 were from Jackson ImmunoResearch; phalloidin-TRITC was from Sigma, and Mitotracker® Red CMXRos was from Molecular Probes. Cell Culture and IF—The following cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection: NRK-52E (CRL-1571), RAT2 (CRL-1764), COS-7 (CRL-1651), HEK293T (CRL-11268) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 200 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. A previously described immortalized podocyte cell line was cultured as described (15Schiwek D. Endlich N. Holzman L. Holthofer H. Kriz W. Endlich K. Kidney Int. 2004; 66: 91-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen) for NRK-52E cells and using FuGENE 6™ (Roche Applied Science) or standard calcium phosphate method for COS-7 cells. IF studies were performed according to standard protocols. Briefly, cells grown on glass coverslips (collagen-coated for COS-7 cells) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min (permeabilization omitted for experiments shown in Fig. 7, B and C) or in methanol (-20 °C) for 15 min and subsequently blocked with 10% donkey serum. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 DNA-dye (1/10,000, 10 min). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Mowiol® (Calbiochem). Images were acquired with a Leica DM-IRBE inverted microscope connected to a digital camera and Openlab® (Improvision) software or with a Leica DM-IRBE-TSP inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope connected to Leica confocal imaging software. Preparation for publication was done using Image J 1.33U (National Institutes of Health) and Photoshop® (Adobe) software. Western Blot—For Western blot of recombinant FAT1-mito, COS-7 cell lysates were processed by 10% SDS-PAGE (10 μg/lane) and transferred on nitrocellulose membranes, and bands were visualized using standard ECL (Western Lightning Plus, catalog number NEL105, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For detection of endogenous FAT1, NRK-52E cells were grown on 15-cm diameter dishes and processed by 5% SDS-PAGE, (50-100 μg of lysate/lane; in equal amounts for each group in an experimental series). Experiments were performed at least three times, and representative immunoblots are shown. Time-lapse Microscopy—COS-7 cells grown on round coverslips were transfected with FAT1(WT)mito for 36 h, stained with Mitotracker® red (1/500, 30 min), mounted on an air-tight inverted chamber containing preconditioned medium, and filmed at 37 °C. Mapping of the PTB-like Motif—FAT1-mito constructs were transfected into mammalian cells and assessed for the presence of mitochondrial redistribution into the cell periphery. For each construct at least 100 cells from three independent experiments were examined and classified. RNA Interference—Knockdown of specific endogenous FAT1 isoforms using lentiviral transduction of small interfering hairpin RNA (shRNA) was performed as described previously (2Moeller M.J. Soofi A. Braun G.S. Li X. Watzl C. Kriz W. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3769-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Two alternative FAT1(+12)-specific shRNA sequences were cloned into pLL3.7 (16Rubinson D.A. Dillon C.P. Kwiatkowski A.V. Sievers C. Yang L. Kopinja J. Rooney D.L. Ihrig M.M. McManus M.T. Gertler F.B.

All experiments were performed with 12KD1, now termed KD(+12). As control, two point mutations were introduced into the shRNA hairpin sequence of 12KD1 (tggcagctcctgacgtcagcaa) (termed KD control). KD(FAT1) lentivirus was described previously (2Moeller M.J. Soofi A. Braun G.S. Li X. Watzl C. Kriz W. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3769-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Lentivirus was packaged in HEK-293T cells using a four-plasmid system (16Rubinson D.A. Dillon C.P. Kwiatkowski A.V. Sievers C. Yang L. Kopinja J. Rooney D.L. Ihrig M.M. McManus M.T. Gertler F.B. Scott M.L. Van Parijs L. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar) and used to transduce subconfluent NRK-52E cells with 90% transduction efficiency, as described (2Moeller M.J. Soofi A. Braun G.S. Li X. Watzl C. Kriz W. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3769-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Quantitative data from standard RT-PCR band analysis, real time-PCR quantification, and morphometric cell evaluation were statistically analyzed using Prism software (GranPad™, San Diego, CA). Alternative Splicing of the FAT1 Cytoplasmic Domain—A comparison of the published mouse FAT1 mRNA sequences (GenBank™ accession number AY256848 versus AJ250768) indicated the presence of a putative alternative splice site located at cytoplasmic nucleotide 529/530 (Fig. 1C, gray shaded sequences). Using RT-PCR, three splice inserts from mouse tissues or rat cell lines were cloned and sequenced. The corresponding exon-intron properties were established by comparative genomic sequence analysis (NC_000074.2). The mouse gene locus, mouse mRNA structure, and mouse mRNA/predicted protein sequences of the splice variants are shown in Fig. 1, A-C, respectively. Three exons (cy1-3) encoded the previously described wild-type FAT1 cytoplasmic domain, FAT1(WT) (GenBank™ accession number AY256848). Three alternatively spliced exons (A-C) were identified (Fig. 1A), which were invariantly directly flanked by introns carrying the splice-donor-acceptor consensus sequence 5′-ag...... gt-3′ (not shown). These exons were also present in the rat genome with 100% nucleotide conservation (NC_005115) (not shown). Cloned mRNA variant FAT1(+12) contained exon C alone (36 nt, Fig. 1B), encoding 12 additional amino acids (aa) in frame (Fig. 1C; deposited under GenBank™ accession number DQ320124 (mouse) and DQ320127 (rat)). Cloned mRNA variant FAT1(+32) contained exons B and C (96 nt, Fig. 1B) encoding 32 additional amino acids in-frame (Fig. 1C, DQ320125). Cloned mRNA variant FAT1(+8TR) contained exons A-C (149 nt, Fig. 1B), which led to the premature termination of the predicted protein after just 8 aa resulting in a truncation of the FAT1 cytoplasmic domain immediately after the splice site (Fig. 1C, DQ320126). The data were corroborated by the mRNA sequence submitted to the data base (17Wu Q. Genetics. 2005; 169: 2179-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and by the genomic sequence-derived exon prediction (all numbers are GenBank™ accession numbers) as follows: mouse FAT1(+12) (AJ250768, AY598446, XM_885736); mouse FAT1(+32) (AY598445, XM_896394); mouse FAT1(+8TR) (AY598444, XM_ 896357); and rat FAT1(+12) (L41684). Data base analysis for human alternative splice isoforms revealed an ortholog of mouse FAT1(+12) (AY598439) showing 100% nucleotide insert identity with the mouse and rat sequences and of a truncated form similar to mouse FAT1(+8TR) (AY598440). The Zebrafish genome contained a sequence corresponding to mouse FAT1 exon B that was also flanked by the intron splice consensus sequence 5′-ag...... gt-3′ (data not shown). FAT1 isoform expression was investigated in various mouse tissues (Fig. 1D). FAT1(WT) mRNA was detected in all tissues. FAT1(+32) and -(+8TR) were expressed specifically within the central nervous system where they predominated over FAT1(WT). FAT1(+12) was detected in highest amounts in lung and in trace amounts in all other tissues except brain (Fig. 1D′, brighter exposure of D). Generation of an Antiserum Specific for Alternatively Spliced FAT1 Isoforms—A splice insert-specific antiserum α-FAT1(+12) was raised in rats and guinea pigs against the common additional 12-aa splice insert present in variants FAT1(+12) and FAT1(+32) (Fig. 2A, red). Both α-FAT1(+12) antisera derived from rat or guinea pig yielded identical results with immunoblotting or immunofluorescence (Fig. 2, B-F′). For all experiments the guinea pig antiserum was used except for Fig. 3, A-A″, where the rat antiserum was used. The novel antiserum was compared against a previously described antiserum α-FAT1(cyto) (2Moeller M.J. Soofi A. Braun G.S. Li X. Watzl C. Kriz W. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3769-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) that is directed against the entire FAT1 cytoplasmic domain and detects all FAT1 isoforms (Fig. 2A′, green). To characterize the antiserum, the cytoplasmic domain of either wild-type or spliced FAT1 (termed FAT1(WT)mito and FAT1(+12)mito, respectively; see schematic in Fig. 5A) was targeted ectopically to the mitochondrial outer leaflets in COS-7 cells (2Moeller M.J. Soofi A. Braun G.S. Li X. Watzl C. Kriz W. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3769-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Double immunofluorescent staining using both antisera showed that α-FAT1(cyto) recognized both FAT1mito isoforms, as predicted (Fig. 2, B and C, green fluorescence), whereas α-FAT1(+12) recognized exclusively FAT1(+12)mito-transfected cells (Fig. 2, B′ and C′, red fluorescence), indicating the specificity of the antibody for the splice insert. Of note, FAT1(WT)mito-transfected mitochondria were displaced toward the cellular leading edges, as described previously (2Moeller M.J. Soofi A. Braun G.S. Li X. Watzl C. Kriz W. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3769-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), but FAT1(+12)mito-expressing mitochondria remained in a perinuclear position (see below). Immunoblotting of lysates from FAT1mito-transfected cells confirmed the specificity of α-FAT1(+12) antisera. Pre-adsorption of α-FAT1(+12) with the immunizing peptide abolished the signal (Fig. 2D).FIGURE 3Differential subcellular distribution of FAT1 splice isoforms. A-A″, immunofluorescent staining of subconfluent NRK-52E cells with α-FAT1(cyto) (green) and α-FAT1(+12) (red). α-FAT1(cyto) stained both leading edges (arrowheads) and intercellular junctions (arrows). In contrast, α-FAT1(+12) staining was strictly confined to intercellular junctions (A′). Overlay of both channels demonstrated co-staining along intercellular junctions (A″). B and C, mRNA expression of FAT1(WT) and FAT1(+12) was detected in NRK-52E and RAT2 cell lines, as well as in a murine podocyte cell line (PCL). Corresponding β-actin PCR products from nonsaturating reactions were used to control for equal loading. As controls, the reverse transcriptase or the cDNA template were omitted (RT-, H2O).

A, FAT1 cytoplasmic domain was targeted to mitochondria outer leaflets using a C-terminal signal sequence derived from ActA. B-B″, when overexpressed in COS-7 cells, FAT1(WT)mito-decorated mitochondria accumulated along the cell periphery close to the plasma membrane within the tips of cellular protrusions (2Moeller M.J. Soofi A. Braun G.S. Li X. Watzl C. Kriz W. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3769-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Overexpressed FAT1(WT)mito was detected using α-FLAG antiserum (B), and mitochondria were detected using MitoTracker®-red (B′). Endogenous perinuclear cytoplasmic distribution of mitochondria can be observed in nontransfected cells (1Tanoue T. Takeichi M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2347-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). C and D, as controls, the cytoplasmic domains of dachsous (Dhs) or 2xFKBP (two repeats of FK506-binding protein) were expressed on mitochondrial outer leaflets (α-FLAG staining). No mitochondrial redistribution was observed in these cells. E, similarly, no redistribution was mediated by the FAT1 cytoplasmic domain truncated at aa 184 (α-FLAG staining). C-E, representative cells without mitochondrial rearrangement (0%). Two cells with incomplete or complete mitochondrial redistribution are shown in F (<50%, α-FAT1(cyto)) and G (>50%, α-FLAG). FAT1(1-190)mito was sufficient to mediate complete mitochondrial redistribution (G), whereas a truncated construct just 6 aa shorter was without effect (E, α-FLAG). H-L, NRK-52E cells transfected with various FAT1mito mutants subjected to a wound assay (red, f-actin; green, α-FLAG staining; blue, DNA). FAT1(WT)mito was redistributed toward the leading edge (H, arrowheads), whereas the splice variants +12 and +32 as well as a mutant lacking the identified motif Δ160-188 show normal mitochondrial distribution (arrows). K, FAT1(+8TR) was expressed diffusely in the cytoplasm as a result of a stop codon cleaving off the C-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptide. M, similar protein expression levels of FAT1(WT)mito, FAT1(+12)mito, and FAT1(Δ160-188)mito were verified by α-FLAG immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The capacity of antisera to detect endogenous full-length FAT1 was assessed. Lysates from nontransfected NRK-52E cells were immunoblotted with either α-FAT1(cyto) or α-FAT1(+12), each yielding a band of the predicted size of ∼500 kDa (2Moeller M.J. Soofi A. Braun G.S. Li X. Watzl C. Kriz W. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3769-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2E). Differential Subcellular Localization of Endogenous FAT1 Isoforms—To investigate the potential functional characteristics of FAT1 isoforms, immunofluorescent double stainings of various cell lines were performed. Immunofluorescent staining of early confluent native NRK-52E cells with α-FAT1(+12) revealed a signal at intercellular junctions and the nucleus (Fig. 2F), which could be abolished by antigen-preadsorption (Fig. 2F′). A striking differential subcellular distribution of FAT1 isoforms was observed in subconfluent migrating NRK-52E cells; α-FAT1(cyto) staining was observed along cellular leading edges as well as along intercellular junctions, and in a proportion of nuclei (Fig. 3A, green fluorescence), as described previously (2Moeller M.J. Soofi A. Braun G.S. Li X. Watzl C. Kriz W. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3769-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 4Tanoue T. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). By contrast, α-FAT1(+12) staining was completely absent at leading edges. α-FAT1(+12) staining was only detected along intercellular contacts and within the nuclei (Fig. 3A′, red fluorescence). A similar subcellular distribution of FAT1 isoforms could be observed in RAT2 and COS-7 cells (not shown). It was verified by RT-PCR that cultured NRK-52E cells expressed both FAT1(WT) and -(+12) mRNAs (Fig. 3B). Because FAT1 is essential for glomerular epithelial cells of the kidney in vivo (8Ciani L. Patel A. Allen N.D. ffrench-Constant C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3575-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), the expression of FAT1(WT) and -(+12) mRNAs was evaluated in a murine conditionally immortalized podocyte cell line (15Schiwek D. Endlich N. Holzman L. Holthofer H. Kriz W. Endlich K. Kidney Int. 2004; 66: 91-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, C). The subcellular localization of FAT1 isoforms in this podocyte cell line and in NRK-52E cells was identical (Fig. 3, D-E″). These data indicate that FAT1(WT) was the only isoform localized along the leading edge of lamellipodial protrusions, whereas spliced FAT1(+12) was confined to intercellular junctions. Splicing of Endogenous FAT1 Is Regulated—Because alternative splicing occurred in a tissue-specific fashion in the mouse (Fig. 1, D and D′), it was investigated if the expression of FAT1 isoforms was differentially regulated under different culture conditions in NRK-52E cells. RT-PCR showed that proliferating subconfluent NRK-52E cells expressed predominantly FAT1(WT) mRNA, whereas quiescent cultures grown to confluence for 72 h predominantly expressed FAT1(+12) (Fig. 4A). Quantitative analysis of digitally analyzed band intensities revealed a statistically significant shift by a factor of 2.2 from a relative predominance of FAT1(WT) to a relative predominance of FAT1(+12) between proliferating and quiescent cells (p < 0.002; see Fig. 4A). These data were corroborated at the protein level by immunoblotting of cellular lysates derived from subconfluent, early confluent, or quiescent NRK-52E cells. Again, a significant shift toward the expression FAT1(+12) was observed (n = 3; Fig. 4B). In addition, down-regulatio"

This study aimed to determine whether the transient steatosis resulted from triglyceride accumulation due to the amount of fatty acids preserved through impaired fatty acid oxidation and/or from up-regulation of lipid exchange between liver and adipose tissue. In liver, mildronate decreased the carnitine content by ∼13-fold and, in fasted rats, lowered the palmitate oxidation rate by 50% in the perfused organ, increased 9-fold the triglyceride content, and doubled the hepatic very low density lipoprotein secretion rate. Concomitantly, triglyceridemia was 13-fold greater than in controls. Hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase I activity and palmitate oxidation capacities measured in vitro were increased after treatment. Gene expression of hepatic proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation, triglyceride formation, and lipid uptake were all increased and were associated with increased hepatic free fatty acid content in treated rats. In periepididymal adipose tissue, mildronate markedly increased lipoprotein lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase activities in fed and fasted rats, respectively. On refeeding, carnitine-depleted rats exhibited a rapid decrease in blood triglycerides and free fatty acids, then after ∼2 h, a marked drop of liver triglycerides and a progressive decrease in liver free fatty acids. Data show that up-regulation of liver activities, peripheral lipolysis, and lipoprotein lipase activity were likely essential factors for excess fat deposit and release alternately occurring in liver and adipose tissue of carnitine-depleted rats during the fed/fasted transition.

The experimental procedure also aimed to amplify the relationship between liver and adipose tissue in terms of up- or down-regulation occurring during the fed/fasted state transition.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and TreatmentsOfficial French regulations (number 87848) for the care and use of laboratory animals were followed (number 03056) throughout. Male Wistar rats weighing about 170 g were obtained from the Centre d’élevage Dépré (Saint-Doulchard, France). They were housed 1 week before the beginning of the study in a controlled environment and were fed a standard non-purified diet (AO4, UAR Epinay-sur-Orge, France) containing 3.5% lipids, with free access to tap water. Animals individually housed in stainless steel cages received 80 mg of mildronate (Grindex, Riga, Latvia) per 100 g body weight per day for 10 days. They were daily fed 3 g of the powdered AO4 diet wetted with 2 ml of water containing the drug at ∼10:00 a.m., then 20 g of the same diet wetted with 15 ml of water at ∼2:00 p.m. Mildronate-treated and control rats were used in the fed state (experiment 1) or fasted for 18 h (experiment 2). For the refeeding procedure, 18-h fasted rats were given 10 g of powdered diet wetted with 6 ml of water and were used for blood sampling and organ weighing at regular time interval over the 4 first hours (with 4 rats per time point). Anesthesia was performed by intraperitoneal route with sodium pentobarbital kept at 37 °C.Liver Secretion and Palmitate PerfusionRates of hepatic VLDL-apoB secretion were measured according to the procedure using Triton WR-1339 (19Borensztajn J.

For the perfusion of fed rat livers, the medium contained 0.25 mIU insulin/ml. Over the 40-min perfusion period, the effluent gas was passed through two successive CO2 traps, each containing 150 ml of Carbo-Sorb E (PerkinElmer), that were changed every 10 min. Samples of the final perfusion fluid were placed into vials fitted with conical plastic tubes containing 1.5 ml of Hyamine (PerkinElmer) and were acidified with 3 ml of 10% (w/v) perchloric acid for 2 h. Radioactivity of CO2 trapped into Carbo-Sorb E from the gas flow and into Hyamine after acidification of the perfusion medium was determined after mixing in Permafluor E+ and Ultima Gold XR (PerkinElmer), respectively.

Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05, except for semi-quantitative PCR-related results that were considered significant at p < 0.001.RESULTSBlood and Liver Parameters—Table 1 shows that in both fed and fasted mildronate-treated rats, total carnitine content of blood and liver was dramatically lower than in untreated rats. The other parameters measured in fed animals were not altered by the treatment, except for a slight increase in liver TG, relative to controls. By contrast in rats sacrificed in the fasted state, although the relative liver weight was a little greater after treatment, the liver surface and transverse section appeared creamcolored and accompanied in cells with microvesicular fat accumulation (data not shown). Concomitantly TG content of blood and liver was 13- and 9-fold increased, respectively. There was significantly more FFA in blood and liver, without any change in hepatic acyl-CoA content. In fasted rats, the treatment resulted in a lowering of blood glucose and liver glycogen. When mildronate-treated rats used after a 18-h fast were refed over ∼4 h, the earliest changes were the increase in blood glucose that was more elevated in portal vein than in the upper part of the vena cava, and the reappearance of liver glycogen whose content was linear with the refeeding times used (Fig. 1A). Concomitantly, there was a nearly immediate drop of blood TG (Fig. 1, B and C) and FFA (Fig. 1D) that was significantly more marked in venous blood of the ilio-lumbar region draining large masses of adipose tissue than in arterial blood. However, the high TG content of the steatotic liver upon fasting was maintained for ∼2 h after refeeding, then rapidly regressed with a progressive reversal toward normal values (Fig. 1B). There was a slow increase in PAT weight (Fig. 1C), with values significantly different at p < 0.05 only between 0 and 240 min of refeeding. During the acute decrease in liver TG, it could be constantly noted in all rats, taken individually, slightly greater TG concentrations in venous blood drained from liver than in the portal vein (data not shown). FFA contents of liver, which were significantly decreased in fed rats (Table 1), tended to decrease over the 4-h refeeding period (Fig. 1D).TABLE 1Body, blood, liver, and adipose tissue parameters in fed and fasted mildronate-treated ratsFed state (experiment 1)Fasted state (experiment 2)ControlTreatedControlTreatedBody weight (g)310 ± 8aValues in the same row with different superscript letters are statistically different at p < 0.05.298 ± 7aValues in the same row with different superscript letters are statistically different at p < 0.05.278 ± 4bValues in the same row with different superscript letters are statistically different at p < 0.05.267 ± 8bValues in the same row with different superscript letters are statistically different at p < 0.05.SerumTotal carnitine (μmol liter-1)65.5 ± 15aValues in the same row with different superscript letters are statistically different at p < 0.05.6.2 ± 0.9bValues in the same row with different superscript letters are statistically different at p < 0.05.57.9 ± 6.5aValues in the same row with different superscript letters are statistically different at p < 0.05.4.0 ± 0.3bValues in the same row with different superscript letters are statistically different at p < 0.05.Triglycerides (g liter-1)0.95 ± 0.09aValues in the same row with different superscript letters are statistically different at p < 0.05.1.15 ± 0.13aValues in the same row with different superscript letters are statistically different at p < 0.05.0.35 ± 0.07bValues in the same row with different superscript letters are statistically different at p < 0.05.4.6 ± 1.5cValues in the same row with different superscript letters are statistically different at p < 0.05.Phospholipids (g liter-1)1.58 ± 0.151.42 ± 0.121.32 ± 0.121.39 ± 0.18Cholesterol (g liter-1)0.84 ± 0.120.64 ± 0.080.81 ± 0.090.66 ± 0.10Free fatty acids (mg liter-1)0.05 ± 0.01aValues in the same row with different superscript letters are statistically different at p < 0.05.0.04 ± 0.01aValues in the same row with different superscript letters are statistically different at p < 0.05.0.13 ± 0.02bValues in the same row with different superscript letters are statistically different at p < 0.05.0.22 ± 0.03cValues in the same row with different superscript letters are statistically different at p < 0.05.Glucose (g liter-1)0.95 ± 0.06aValues in the same row with different superscript letters are statistically different at p < 0.05.1.05 ± 0.08aValues in the same row with different supersc"
https://openalex.org/W1989600065,"Although the monomeric GTPases RalA and RalB have been shown to regulate a variety of transcription factors, little is known regarding the differences or similarities in transcriptional programs regulated by RalA compared to RalB. Further, the association of these transcriptional pathways to human carcinogenesis and progression remains unclear. Here, we studied the role of RalA and/or RalB in transcriptional regulation by combining short interfering RNA depletion of Ral with gene expression profiling via microarray in the human bladder cancer cell line, UMUC-3. A large number of genes were found to be similarly modulated in cells with RalA and RalB depletion, suggesting that RalA and RalB impinge on overlapping transcriptional signaling pathways. However, smaller sets of genes were modulated by depletion of RalA or RalB, indicating that these closely related proteins also regulate nonoverlapping transcriptional pathways. Computational analysis of upstream sequences of genes modulated by Ral depletion identified Ras-responsive element-binding protein (RREB)-1, as a putative Ral transcriptional target, which we verified experimentally. Importantly, as a group, Ral-regulated probe sets identified here were disproportionally represented among those differentially expressed as a function of human bladder transformation. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that Ral family members mediate both common and specific transcriptional programs that are associated with human cancer and identify RREB-1 as a novel transcriptional effector of Ral."
https://openalex.org/W2008486116,"During lung development, signaling by Fgf10 (fibroblast growth factor 10) and its receptor Fgfr2b is critical for induction of a gene network that controls proliferation, differentiation, and branching of the epithelial tubules. The downstream events triggered by Fgf10-Fgfr2b signaling during this process are still poorly understood. In a global screen for transcriptional targets of Fgf10, we identified Ctsh (cathepsin H), a gene encoding a lysosomal cysteine protease of the papain family, highly up-regulated in the developing lung epithelium. Here we show that among other cathepsin genes present in the lung, Ctsh is the only family member selectively induced by Fgf10 in the lung epithelium. We provide evidence that, during branching morphogenesis, epithelial expression of Ctsh overlaps temporally and spatially with that of Bmp4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4), another target of Fgf10. Moreover, we show that Ctsh controls the availability of mature Bmp4 protein in the embryonic lung and that inhibiting Ctsh activity leads to a marked accumulation of Bmp4 protein and disruption of branching morphogenesis. Tightly controlled levels of Bmp4 signaling are critical for patterning of the distal lung epithelium. Our study suggests a potentially novel posttranscriptional mechanism in which Ctsh rapidly removes Bmp4 from forming buds to limit Bmp4 action. The presence of both Ctsh and Bmp4 or Bmp4 signaling activity in other developing structures, such as the kidney, yolk sac, and choroid plexus, suggests a possible general role of Ctsh in regulating Bmp4 proteolysis in different morphogenetic events.

At E10.5, secondary buds start to form, and from then on the epithelial tubules undergo a series of patterning events that includes budding, clefting, and dichotomous branching to generate the airways and the alveoli. Genetic analysis has implicated a number of signaling molecules, present in the epithelial and mesenchymal layers of growing buds, in controlling cell survival, proliferation, and fate determination during this process. The mechanisms by which expression of these molecules are regulated are complex and include dynamic induction and spatial restriction of expression and negative feedback suppression (reviewed in Ref. 1Cardoso W.V.

Recent information from cathepsin knock-out mouse models have largely confirmed this view and have shown that specific cathepsin deficiencies have far reaching and discrete consequences on development and homeostasis (11Gelb B.D.

Here we investigate this issue and the biological significance of Ctsh as a target of Fgf10 in the epithelium of developing lung buds. We provide evidence that, during lung branching morphogenesis, epithelial expression of Ctsh overlaps temporally and spatially with that of Bmp4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4), another target of Fgf10. Moreover, we show that Ctsh controls the availability of mature Bmp4 protein in distal lung buds and that inhibiting Ctsh activity leads to Bmp4 accumulation and disruption of bud formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESLung Cultures—Lungs from CD1 mouse embryos were isolated at E11.5-E12, placed onto MF-Millipore membrane filters on the top of a metal mesh on a tissue culture dish, and cultured for 48-72 h with BGjb medium (20 mg/100 ml of ascorbic acid, 1% of inactivated fetal calf serum, and 50 units of penicillin/streptomycin) (5Park W.Y. Miranda B. Lebeche D. Hashimoto G. Cardoso W.V. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In some cultures, heparin beads soaked in either buffer (PBS) or human recombinant FGF10 (100 μg/ml; R&D Systems) were engrafted near distal buds.For the various experiments, BGjb medium was used with the following reagents: pan-RAR antagonist BMS493 (Bristol Meyers Squibb) or all-trans-RA (Sigma), human recombinant BMP4 or Noggin (a specific inhibitor of Bmp4 signaling/receptor binding; R&D Systems) (22Weaver M. Yingling J.M. Dunn N.R. Bellusci S. Hogan B.L. Development. 1999; 126: 4005-4015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), diazomethane derivatives H-Ser(O-Bzl)-CHN2 (cathepsin H inhibitor) (23Angliker H. Wikstrom P. Kirschke H. Shaw E. Biochem.

Saftig P. Peters C. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2177-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and the general transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (Sigma). Lung cultures were collected either for enzyme activity assay, Western blotting, isolation of total RNA for quantitative real time PCR, immunohistochemistry analysis, or in situ hybridization, as previously described (25Lu J. Qian J. Izvolsky K.I. Cardoso W.V. Dev. Biol. 2004; 273: 418-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).For the bud chemoattraction assay, freshly isolated E11.5 distal lung buds were embedded in Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA), and FGF10- or PBS-soaked beads were placed near the distal end of explants shortly before Matrigel solidification (26Weaver M. Dunn N.R. Hogan B.L. Development. 2000; 127: 2695-2704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Matrigel-embedded explants were then cultured for 72 h in BGjb medium supplemented with either 1.0 or 2.0 μm Ctsh inhibitor (Ctshi) or Me2SO alone.In Situ Hybridization—RNA probes were generated using the appropriate RNA polymerases (SP6, T7, or T3) and following the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion). cDNA clones used for probe labeling were obtained from the NIA Mouse 15K cDNA Clone Set, distributed by the Microarray Core Facility of the Tufts University School of Medicine. The accession numbers for the cDNA clones are as follows: Ctsh (BG065250); Ctsl (BG065219); Ctsd (BG074759), and Ctsz (BG064259) (25Lu J. Qian J. Izvolsky K.I. Cardoso W.V. Dev. Biol. 2004; 273: 418-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Bmp4 and Patched probes (gift from A. McMahon, Harvard University) were labeled as described (27Lebeche D. Malpel S. Cardoso W.V. Mech. Dev. 1999; 86: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Isotopic and nonisotopic (digoxigenin) labeling of RNA probes and whole mount in situ hybridization of freshly isolated or cultured embryonic lungs were performed as previously described (6Lu J. Izvolsky K.I. Qian J. Cardoso W.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4834-4841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Western Blotting and Immunohistochemistry—Western blot analysis was carried out in samples of cultured lungs and yolk sacs, as previously described (25Lu J. Qian J. Izvolsky K.I. Cardoso W.V. Dev. Biol. 2004; 273: 418-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were as follows: anti-mouse cathepsin H (polyclonal antibody, catalog number AF1013; R&D Systems), anti-Sprouty2 (rabbit polyclonal antibody, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., catalog number 07-524), anti-α-tubulin (monoclonal antibody; Sigma, catalog number T9026), anti-Bmp4 (mouse monoclonal antibody; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) catalog number sc-12721). The Immune-Star™ HRP chemiluminescent kit (Bio-Rad) and appropriate secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used for Western blotting detection. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 5-μm paraffin sections using the anti-Ctsh antibody above, the cell and tissue staining kits (CTS Series; R&D Systems), and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Cathepsin Activity Assays—The Ctsh activity assay was performed as described earlier (28Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1980; 187: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 29Waghray A. Keppler D. Sloane B.F. Schuger L. Chen Y.Q. J. Biol.

Briefly, embryonic lung cultures were homogenized in a lysis buffer composed of 25 mm MES, adjusted to pH 6. 2, and supplemented with 1 mm EDTA-Na2, 50 mm NaCl, 1.0% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 250 mm sucrose. Complete lysis of the tissues was achieved by three successive, 5-7-s sonication cycles. Clear supernatants were obtained after centrifugation at 4 °C and 10,000 × g for 15 min. The total protein concentration of samples was determined using the micro-BCA kit from Pierce. All enzyme activity measurements were carried out in a calibrated Bio-Tek FLX-800 fluorescence microplate reader, equipped with 355- and 460-nm excitation and emission filters, respectively. Samples (3-10 μl) were pre-incubated for 20 min at 20 °C in Ctsh assay buffer (50 μl final) in the presence of cathepsin inhibitors or Me2SO (vehicle control). Aminopeptidase activity of Ctsh was assayed in 25 mm MES, at pH 6.8, containing 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA-Na2, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 μm puromycin, and 250 mm sucrose using H2N-Arg-MCA as substrate. Assay buffer (50 μl) containing H2N-Arg-MCA substrate was added to preincubation mixes, and fluorescence intensity of the reaction was monitored continuously for 30 min at 37 °C.Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured lungs, treated with DNA-free DNase (Ambion), and reverse transcribed using Superscript II (Invitrogen). cDNA from reverse transcription reactions were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in an ABI 7000 instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using primers (Fgf10, Bmp4, and β-actin) obtained from Assays-on-Demand (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were performed in 50 μl using TaqMan PCR universal master (Applied Biosystems). The relative concentration of RNA for each gene to β-actin mRNA was determined using the equation 2-ΔCT, where ΔCT = (CTmRNA - CTβ-actin RNA).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCtsh Is a Downstream Target of FGF10 in the Developing Lung Epithelium—We have previously characterized the global transcriptional profile of E11.5 mesenchyme-free mouse lung epithelial explants cultured in the presence of recombinant FGF10 (6Lu J. Izvolsky K.I. Qian J. Cardoso W.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4834-4841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Along with the morphological changes associated with initial sealing of the epithelium (0-8 h) and bud initiation (8-24 h), we reported a remarkable induction of Ctsh mRNA expression (4.5- and 36-fold at 8 and 24 h, respectively; p = 0.02) (Fig. 1, A and B).Although other cathepsin genes were identified in our array, none were induced by FGF10 like Ctsh was (Fig. 1). For example, cathepsin L (Ctsl) showed a statistically significant but rather modest increase in expression from 0 to 24 h (Fig. 1). By contrast, cathepsin Z (Ctsz) expression decreased over time. Cathepsin C (Ctsc), cathepsin D (Ctsd), and cathepsin S (Ctss) were detected in lung explants, but expression was not significantly changed in time (Fig. 1; data not shown). Cathepsin B (Ctsb) was undetectable under our experimental conditions (data not shown).To validate the microarray results, first we localized expression of these cathepsins in the uncultured E11.5-E12 lungs by whole mount in situ hybridization. Although Ctsh expression was strong and clearly restricted to distal epithelial buds, Ctsl, Ctsd, and Ctsz transcripts were present mostly in the mesenchyme with some weak signals in the epithelium (Fig. 2, A-D, upper panels). Then we tested the inducibility of cathepsin genes by engrafting heparin beads soaked in recombinant FGF10 or buffer (PBS, control) onto E11.5-12 lung explants, subsequently cultured for 24-48 h. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed that only Ctsh was consistently induced by FGF10 in our assays (Fig. 2, A-D, bottom panels). High levels of Ctsh were found in epithelial cells surrounding the FGF10 bead but not the PBS bead (Fig. 2, E and F). Induction of Ctsh was restricted to previously reported sites of activation of FGF10-Fgfr2b (2Bellusci S. Grindley J. Emoto H. Itoh N. Hogan B.L. Development. 1997; 124: 4867-4878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Park W.Y. Miranda B. Lebeche D. Hashimoto G. Cardoso W.V. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). These results were confirmed by isotopic in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2, G and H). Thus, Ctsh showed a unique distribution and responsiveness to FGF10 in the developing lung epithelium.FIGURE 2Expression pattern of cathepsins in the developing lung and inducibility by FGF10. A-F, whole mount in situ hybridization of Ctsh, Ctsl, Ctsd, and Ctsz in E11.5-E12 lungs freshly isolated (top), or engrafted with heparin beads soaked in FGF10 and cultured for 48h (bottom). In the E12 lung, Ctsh is highly expressed in the distal epithelium (A), whereas Ctsl is essentially mesenchymal (B) and Ctsd and Ctsz are present in both mesenchyme and epithelium (C and D). This pattern is also seen in cultured lungs (A-D, compare arrowheads in top and bottom). Ctsh mRNA is dramatically induced in the epithelium adjacent to the FGF10 bead (arrowheads in A and E; compare with negative control PBS bead). E and F depict Ctsh antisense (AS) and sense (S) probes, respectively (note only background staining with sense probe). By contrast, FGF10 does not induce expression of the other cathepsin genes (B-D, bottom). FGF10 induction of Ctsh is further confirmed by isotopic in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (arrowheads in G and H). At E11 (I), Ctsh expression has not initiated in the lung epithelium (*), but it is present in the pulmonary artery (pa, red arrow) near the trachea. At E14, Ctsh is expressed in the distal lung epithelium (J and K, red arrowheads) and scattered mesenchymal cells (K, blue arrowhead). In the adult lung (L) Ctsh is expressed in type II cells (arrowhead), some endothelial cells (red arrow), and macrophages (not shown). Shown are whole mount (A-F and I) and isotopic (G and J) in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (H, K, and L).

A more detailed survey of the Ctsh expression pattern in the developing lung confirmed persistent expression in distal epithelial buds throughout branching morphogenesis in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 2, A, G, H, J, and K). However, surprisingly, no Ctsh expression was detected in the lung epithelium at E9.5-E11, when Fgf10-Fgfr2b signaling is known to be critical for bud induction and growth of the early lung (3Ohuchi H. Hori Y. Yamasaki M. Harada H. Sekine K. Kato S. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 4Sekine K. Ohuchi H. Fujiwara M. Yamasaki M. Yoshizawa T. Sato T. Yagishita N. Matsui D. Koga Y. Itoh N. Kato S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Ctsh signals were evident in endothelial cells of the pulmonary artery outside the lung, along the trachea, but not in the lung proper (Fig. 2I, arrow). Epithelial signals were promptly detected in nascent lung buds only after secondary buds formed (E12 onward; Fig. 2A). Thus, in the developing lung epithelium, induction of primary and secondary buds occurs in the absence of Ctsh. In the E14.5 lung or at the equivalent time in culture, Ctsh could be also identified in scattered mesenchymal cells, presumably macrophage precursors, since some of these expressed the macrophage marker F4/80 (30Austyn J.M. Gordon S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2K, blue arrowhead; data not shown). In the adult lung, we confirmed Ctsh expression in type II alveolar epithelial cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells (31Yayoi Y. Ohsawa Y. Koike M. Zhang G. Kominami E. Uchiyama Y. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 2001; 64: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).To learn about the overall distribution of Ctsh and to gain insights into its potential role in developmental processes, we performed a comprehensive Ctsh expression analysis in the E7.0-E14.5 mouse embryo. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis revealed a highly restricted expression pattern, with strong signals in the visceral endoderm/yolk sac membrane, the epithelium of lung, kidney, and choroid plexus, and endothelial cells of a few large blood vessels (Figs. 2 and 3). Together, the data suggested that Ctsh may mediate specific events in a limited population of epithelial and mesenchymal derived cells in the mouse embryo. In the lung epithelium, Ctsh does not seem to function until branching morphogenesis initiates.FIGURE 3Ctsh expression in the developing mouse embryo (immunohistochemistry). A, strong Ctsh expression is detected in the visceral endoderm (ve) at E7.0 and at E12 in yolk sac (B and C). Lower levels are detected in the extra embryonic tissue at E7.0 (A).

We asked whether an epithelial signal active in the primary lung bud but not at subsequent stages could be preventing induction of Ctsh by FGF10-Fgfr2b. A recent microarray screen for retinoic acid (RA) targets during organogenesis showed high levels of Ctsh expression in vitamin A-deficient rat embryos (32Flentke G.R. Baker M.W. Docterman K.E. Power S. Lough J. Smith S.M. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 229: 886-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have previously shown that RA signaling is highly active in the epithelium of nascent primary buds, but it is subsequently turned off during branching morphogenesis, coincident with the stage when we first observed epithelial expression of Ctsh. We reasoned that RA might suppress Fgf10-induced Ctsh expression in the lung epithelium. To test this hypothesis, we engrafted FGF10- or PBS-soaked heparin beads onto E11.5 lung explants in which RA signaling was maintained active by treatment with exogenous RA, as previously described (33Desai T.J. Malpel S. Flentke G.R. Smith S.M. Cardoso W.V. Dev. Biol. 2004; 273: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Ctsh expression was determined by immunostaining or Western blotting, and results were compared with lungs cultured under similar conditions in control medium, or in medium containing a pan-RAR antagonist (BMS493) (34Malpel S. Mendelsohn C. Cardoso W.V. Development. 2000; 127: 3057-3067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antagonist was used here as an additional control to ensure that no RA signaling was activated in the whole explant. Western blotting and immunostaining analysis showed that RA treatment markedly reduced the Ctsh protein levels and prevented FGF10-induced expression of Ctsh in the lung epithelium, effects not seen in control or BMS493-treated cultures (Figs. 2H and 4, A-C). These results suggest a model in which Fgf10-mediated induction of Ctsh in the lung epithelium occurs only once endogenous RA signaling has been locally turned off. Although due to technical issues we were unable to properly isolate and culture E9.5-E10 lungs to test this model, we had additional supporting evidence of RA-Ctsh interaction in a foregut culture system used to study organogenesis in vitro (33Desai T.J. Malpel S. Flentke G.R. Smith S.M. Cardoso W.V. Dev. Biol. 2004; 273: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Microarray analysis of E8.5 foregut explants cultured for 24 h in BMS493 revealed significant up-regulation of Ctsh expression compared with controls (-fold change, 1.57; p = 0.04). Conversely, rescuing RA signaling in retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (Raldh2) null foreguts using exogenous RA resulted in marked up-regulation of Ctsh (-fold change, 6.07; p = 0.0006). 3F. Chen, J. Lu, and W. Cardoso, unpublished observations. Thus, Ctsh may be part of a developmental program that is initially suppressed in primary buds by early signals, such as endogenous RA, but is later released during branching morphogenesis.FIGURE 4RA suppresses FGF10-induced expression of Ctsh in cultured lungs. Control (Ctr), all-trans-RA, and BMS493-treated E12 lungs were engrafted with an FGF10-soaked heparin bead and cultured for 48 h. A, Western blot analysis of Ctsh shows marked decrease in both 28- and 22-kDa Ctsh species in RA-treated samples. The RA antagonist BMS493 does not interfere with FGF10 induction of Ctsh, because in E12 lungs endogenous RA signaling is already down-regulated in distal buds; thus, Ctsh is expressed at comparable levels in controls and BMS-treated lungs. B and C, Ctsh immunostaining confirms that almost no signals are present in the epithelium surrounding the FGF10 bead of RA-treated lungs (C, asterisks), whereas strong expression is seen in BMS-treated (B) and control (Fig. 2H) lungs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of Ctsh Activity Using H2N-Ser(O-Bzl)-CHN2—We investigated the role of Ctsh in the developing lung by inhibiting Ctsh activity selectively in organ culture systems.

In phagocytes, lysosome exocytosis is a regulated phenomenon at least in part under the control of the phagocyte-specific and lysosome-associated Src-kinase p61Hck (hematopoietic cell kinase). We show here that p61Hck activation triggered polymerization of actin at the membrane of lysosomes, which resulted in F-actin structures similar to comet tails observed on endocytic vesicles. We correlated this actin-comet biogenesis to a 35% acceleration of p61Hck-lysosomes in cells, which was dependent on actin polymerization and required an intact microtubular network. It was possible to initiate the formation of actin tails on p61Hck-positive lysosomes and on p61Hck-associated latex beads incubated in human phagocyte cytosolic extracts. The in vitro reconstitution on beads indicated that other lysosomal proteins were dispensable in this mechanism. The de novo actin polymerization process was functionally dependent on the kinase activity of Hck, WASp, the Arp2/3 complex, and Cdc42 but not Rac or Rho. Thus, we identified p61Hck as the first lysosomal protein able to recruit the molecular machinery responsible for actin tail formation. Altogether, our results suggest a new mechanism for lysosome motility involving p61Hck, actin-comet tail biogenesis, and the microtubule network.

It becomes increasingly clear that lysosomes in eukaryotic cells can function as secretory organelles and might no longer be considered just as the end point of the endocytic pathway to which proteins and extracellular particles are delivered for degradation. In fact, in several cell types subpopulations of secretory lysosomes are mobilized to achieve various cell functions such as plasma membrane repair during migration (1Reddy A. Caler E.V. Andrews N.W.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4013-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). An actin-dependent motility process, which is not dependent on molecular motors, has been described for late endocytic compartments. This process relies on de novo polymerization of actin at the membrane of the organelle, resulting in the formation of an actin-comet tail and the rocketing of the vesicle (10Ma L. Cantley L.C.

Superti-Furga G. Frame M.C. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 855-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Such an actin-based motility had been initially described for pathogens (e.g. Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella flexneri) (17Gouin E. Welch M.D. Cossart P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) (18Frischknecht F. Way M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 30-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) to propel them within the host cytoplasm using the Arp2/3 complex to initiate actin assembly. Although most bacterial proteins that recruit the host actin polymerization machinery have been identified, the molecules responsible for the recruitment of the actin-assembly machinery at the membranes of endocytic vesicles remain largely unknown. We propose here that Hck is a molecular link able to trigger the actin polymerization process at the membrane of lysosomes. Hck is a protein-tyrosine kinase of the Src (Rous sarcoma virus protein) family that is specifically expressed in phagocytes. In neutrophils, activation of Hck at the lysosomal membrane has been correlated to lysosome (azurophil granule) fusion with phagosomes, which takes place few seconds after the bacteria/cell contact (19Welch H. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 102-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In macrophages, phagolysosome biogenesis takes dozens of minutes to occur. In these cells, Hck activation precedes the translocation of p61Hck-lysosomes toward the phagosomal membrane (20Astarie-Dequeker C. N′Diaye E.N. Le Cabec V. Rittig M.G. Prandi J. Maridonneau-Parini I. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 469-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Astarie-Dequeker C. Carreno S. Cougoule C. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 81-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hck is expressed as two isoforms, p59Hck and p61Hck, located at the plasma membrane and the membrane of lysosomes, respectively (22Carreno S. Gouze M.E. Schaak S. Emorine L.J. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36223-36229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the activation of both isoforms of Hck is associated with actin remodeling. p59Hck activation triggers the actin-dependent biogenesis of membrane protrusions similar to those involved in the engulfment of particles or cell migration (23Carreno S. Caron E. Cougoule C. Emorine L.J. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21007-21016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In cells that are not involved in the phagocytic process, p61Hck activation triggers the biogenesis of actin-rich podosomes in a lysosome-dependent manner via a mechanism that requires intact microfilaments and microtubules (24Cougoule C. Carreno S. Castandet J. Labrousse A. Astarie-Dequeker C. Poincloux R. Le Cabec V. Maridonneau-Parini I. Traffic. 2005; 6: 682-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similarly, Src has been shown to be associated with endocytic vesicles (25Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Varmus H.E. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Its activation occurs during the actin-dependent translocation of the vesicles toward the plasma membrane (16Sandilands E. Cans C. Fincham V.J. Brunton V.G. Mellor H. Prendergast G.C. Norman J.C. Superti-Furga G. Frame M.C. Dev.

Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). While constitutively active v-Src is able to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton (27Frame M.C. Fincham V.J. Carragher N.O. Wyke J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) in a N-WASp (Neural-Wiskott-Aldrich-Syndrome protein)- and Hsp90 (heat-shock protein)-dependent manner (28Park S.J. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1557-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), Src has not been demonstrated to directly control the movement of vesicles. Hck phosphorylates WASp, and a phospho-mimicking mutation of the phosphorylated tyrosine residue enhances the actin nucleation activity of the molecule (29Cory G.O. Garg R. Cramer R. Ridley A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45115-45121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We show here that p61Hck is able to promote actin-comet tail biogenesis in a WASp-, Arp2/3-, and Cdc42-dependent process that we correlated to an increased motility of p61Hck-positive lysosomes in cells.

Anti-Cdc42, -RhoA, and -Rac1 antibodies were, respectively, used at dilution 1:250, 1:200, and 1:500 for Western blot analysis. Plasmids—The coding sequence of wild-type, Y512F constitutively active (ca) or K290E kinase-dead (kd) mutants p61Hck were amplified by PCR using Pfu (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Oligonucleotide 1 (5′-cgagatccatatgggggggcgctcaagc-3′) as a forward primer and oligonucleotide 2 (5′-gcgcctcgagctacggctgctgttggtactgg-3′) or 3 (5′-gcgcctcgagctacggctgctgttggaactgg-3′) as reverse primers were used for p61Hckwt or p61Hckca, respectively, and the plasmid encoding p61Hck-GFP as template (described in Carreno et al. (22Carreno S. Gouze M.E. Schaak S. Emorine L.J. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36223-36229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)). The oligonucleotides 1 and 3 were used to amplify the cDNA encoding p61Hckkd using p61Hckkd-GFP as a template (24Cougoule C. Carreno S. Castandet J. Labrousse A. Astarie-Dequeker C. Poincloux R. Le Cabec V. Maridonneau-Parini I. Traffic. 2005; 6: 682-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The 1.6-kilobase PCR product was cloned into the pPCR-Script vector (Stratagene) before being subcloned into the pET28a vector using the NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes (Ozyme, St. Quentin-en-Yvelines, France). These pET28a-p61Hck plasmids were checked by sequencing. For expression in NIH3T3 fibroblasts of full-length p61Hck wild type, kinase dead, or constitutively active and of p61Hck-Unique domain alone in fusion with GFP, corresponding plasmids were described before (22Carreno S.

Recombinant Proteins Purification—The pET28a-p61Hck proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Briefly, induction of protein expression was carried out at A600 nm = 1.0 in the presence of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thio-galactopyranoside during4hat16 °C. Cells were then collected by centrifugation, washed in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and resuspended in sonication buffer (500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, and protease inhibitor mixture (pepstatin, leupeptin, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin). Recombinant His6-p61Hck proteins were purified by pseudo-affinity using a 1-ml HiTrap Nickel column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Imidazole elution followed by dialysis was performed, and aliquots of p61Hck containing 10% glycerol were stored at -80 °C. p61Hck was identified in the fractions by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot and mass spectrometry. The pGex-VCA (Verprolin-Cofilin-acidic domain of N-WASp) plasmid was kindly provided by Philippe Chavrier (Curie Institute, Paris). The recombinant GST-VCA protein was produced in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. After a 3-h induction at 37 °C with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, the recombinant protein was purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The recombinant human His6-tagged N-WASp was expressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system and purified as described (30Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH3T3 fibroblasts were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The day before transfection cells were seeded in Lab-TekII chambered cover glass (VWR International) at 3.5 × 104 cells/ml for video-microscopy experiments or in 9-cm Petri dishes at 5 × 104 cells/ml for p61Hck-lysosome-containing post-nuclear supernatant preparation and transfected as previously described (23Carreno S.

U937 cells were cultured in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented as above at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere as previously described (31Le Cabec V. Carreno S. Moisand A. Bordier C. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2003-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The Tet-Off MEF3T3 stable cell line in which p61Hckca-GFP can be expressed was cultured as described (24Cougoule C. Carreno S. Castandet J. Labrousse A. Astarie-Dequeker C. Poincloux R. Le Cabec V. Maridonneau-Parini I. Traffic. 2005; 6: 682-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Induction of p61Hckca-GFP expression was obtained by doxycycline depletion for 2 weeks as previously described (32Poincloux R. Vincent C. Labrousse A. Castandet J. Rigo M. Cougoule C. Bordier C. Le Cabec V. Maridonneau-Parini I. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Induced cells were seeded and grown on sterile glass coverslips at a final density of 4 × 104 cells/well. Cells were then fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and F-actin was labeled with Texas Red phalloidin (Molecular Probes) as described (23Carreno S. Caron E. Cougoule C. Emorine L.J. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21007-21016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Video-microscopy and Image Analysis—36 h after transfection cells were observed with an inverted Leica microscope equipped with a heated stage adjusted to 37 °C and a HCX PLAPO 63×/1.4-0.6 objective. Fluorescent pictures were taken through a I2 filter-set (Leica Microsystems, Rueil Malmaison, France) using a Cool-Snap HQ CCD camera (Photometrics, Roper Scientific, Evry, France) driven by Metamorph (Roper Scientifics). Pictures were taken every 5 s as stacks. Observations were performed within 60 min. p61Hck-positive vesicles were followed through the stacks, and distances were measured for 10–20 lysosomes per cell. Five to ten cells per transfection conditions were analyzed, and at least three independent experiments were carried out for each condition. For cytochalasin D, latrunculin A, and nocodazole treatments, drugs were added to cells at 0.5, 0.5, and 5 μm, respectively, 25 min before lysosome movements were being monitored. Velocity distributions were fitted to Gaussian curves with the equation y = amplitude × e-0.5((X-mean)/S.D.)2, where y is the number of lysosomes within a velocity range (X), and S.D. stands for Standard Deviation. Subcellular Fractionation and Cytosol Treatments—The lysosome-containing fraction was prepared after having confirmed that p61Hck-positive vesicles could be loaded with rhodamine-dextran, a characteristic of compartments of the endocytic pathway (22Carreno S. Gouze M.E. Schaak S. Emorine L.J. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36223-36229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For p61Hck-lysosome-containing post-nuclear supernatant preparation, NIH3T3 fibroblasts were washed, resuspended in 2 volumes of lysis buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.7) with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride), and lysed by passage through a 27-gauge needle (15–20 times; cell breakage was monitored by phase microscopy). Centrifugation for 10 min at 300 × g provided the p61Hck-lysosome-containing post-nuclear supernatant. For cytosolic extracts preparation, U937 cells were collected and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen). Two milliliters of cell suspension (1 × 108 cells/ml) in Relax buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Trizma (Tris base), 6 mm EGTA, pH 7.3) supplemented with protease inhibitors (as above) were broken by cavitation as described for neutrophils (19Welch H. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 102-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Lysates were spun at 250 × g and a 15,000-g post-nuclear supernatant was further spun at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The cytosolic fraction was then separated into aliquots and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method and varied from 4 to 12 mg/ml. Xenopus oocyte cytosolic extracts were prepared from non-fertilized oocytes as described (33Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1989; 339: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar) with the following modifications; cytochalasin D and silicone oil were omitted throughout the protocol, and oocytes were activated by three 2-s 60-V DC electrical pulses. Protein concentrations varied from 20 to 25 mg/ml. To remove the Arp2/3 complex from the U937 cytosolic extracts, 26 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) loaded with 0.3 nmol of recombinant glutathione S-transferase-VCA were incubated with 100 μl of the corresponding cytosols for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were removed by a 1300 × g centrifugation, and the supernatant was directly used in the actin-comet tail assay described below. For GDP loading of the cytosolic extracts, cytosols were supplemented with 100 μm GDP and 5 mm EDTA before being incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and then supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2 before being used in the actin polymerization assay described below. For experiments carried out with a dominant negative mutant of the Rho-GTPases Cdc42 or Rac1, cytosolic extracts were supplemented with an optimized concentration of 10 μm N17Cdc42 or N17Rac1, respectively, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C before being used in the actin-comet tail assay described below. For experiments carried out with anti-human WASp blocking antibodies, cytosolic extracts were supplemented with rabbit polyclonal anti-human WASp (sc-8353) antibodies at 1:25 dilution before being used in the actin-comet tail assay described below. For experiments carried out in the presence of anti-human Cdc42 antibodies, cytosolic extracts were supplemented with an optimized concentration of 1 μg of antibodies per 150 μg of total cytosolic proteins and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C before being used in the actin-comet tail assay described below. To functionally inhibit Rho, cytosolic extracts were treated with C3 exoenzyme (1 μg of enzyme per 1 mg of total proteins) for 10 min at 37 °C before being used in the actin-comet tail assay described below. To assess the level of Rho inhibition in the cell extracts treated with active or inactive C3 exoenzyme, the extracts were further incubated with an excess of active C3 exoenzyme (100 μg of enzyme per 1 mg of total proteins) for in vitro ADP-ribosylation, which was performed for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μCi of adenine adenylate-32P dinucleotide per 1 mg of total proteins (34Boyer L. Doye A. Rolando M. Flatau G. Munro P. Gounon P. Clement R. Pulcini C. Popoff M.R. Mettouchi A. Landraud L. Dussurget O. Lemichez E. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, 83% of endogenous Rho were inhibited. In Vitro Polymerization of Actin on Agarose Beads—Agarose-Ni2+ beads (His-Select nickel affinity gel, Sigma) were washed 3 times in 20 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, before being incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of recombinant His6-tagged p61Hck. Beads were then washed twice in Relax buffer, then incubated in 20 mm NaCl, 10 mg/ml BSA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, for 15 min at 4 °C before being washed in Relax buffer. Beads were then incubated for 1 h at 25°C in a 100-μl aliquot of cytosol. An 8-μl aliquot of the reaction was transferred into a tube containing 2 μl of 10 μm rhodamine-phalloidin (Sigma) before being mounted for fluorescence microscopy observations. Snapshots were taken with a constant exposure time of 200 ms. To allow direct visual comparisons, experiments and the corresponding controls were displayed with the same dynamics of gray levels. For further Western blot analysis, beads were washed in Relax buffer as above, and proteins recruited on beads were then separated by SDS-PAGE before immunoblotting with the corresponding antibodies. In Vitro Polymerization of Pyrene-Actin—Optimized concentrations of recombinant human GST-VCA (270 nm) and His6-tagged p61Hck (15 nm) were added to the following reaction mix: 200 μl of U937 cytosol (between 6 and 12 mg/ml of proteins), 20 μl of KMEI 10× buffer (500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 100 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), 1 mm ATP/Mg, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.5 μm F-actin, 0.75 μm Mg2+-actin, and 0.75 μm Mg2+-pyrene-actin. F-actin was prepared as follows. monomeric actin was incubated at 55 μm with 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.3, for 1 h at room temperature before being stored at 4 °C. F-actin stocks were used within 5 days of storage. Pyrene fluorescence (excitation and emission wavelengths were 366 and 407 nm, respectively) was measured with a SAFAS spectrofluorimeter. Actin-comet Tail Assay—For electron microscopy of actin tail, samples were fixed following the recommendations and protocols previously described (35Gounon P. Sansonetti P. Zychlinsky A. Molecular Cellular Microbiology. Academic Press, Inc., New York2002: 531-557Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, 0.2% tannic acid in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, at room temperature. Preparations were then washed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and post-fixed with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, for 30 min at 4 °C. Preparations were carefully washed with water then stained en bloc overnight with 0.5% uranyl acetate and washed again with water before dehydration with ethanol and final embedding in epoxy resin. Thin sections were made, stained, and observed under standard conditions. Recombinant human His6-N-WASp or His6-p61Hck were bound to 1-μm-diameter protein-G-carboxylated beads (Polysciences, TEBU-Bio, France) at a final concentration of 0.4 μm for 2 h at 4°C via anti-His6-tag antibodies (Novagen) and then washed 3 times in 1% Xb-BSA or in 1% BSA-phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), respectively, before being resuspended in 0.1% Xb-BSA or 0.1% BSA-PBS, respectively. Xb buffer contained 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8. 2 μl of functionalized beads or of p61Hck-lysosome-containing post-nuclear supernatant were then incubated in a biomimetic medium: 6 μl of Xenopus oocyte or U937 cell cytosol, 1.6 μm rhodamine-actin, 10 μm F-actin (see above), 0.06 or 2.1 mm 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane for experiments carried out in U937 or Xenopus oocyte, respectively, 0.2 or 14 mm dithiothreitol for experiments carried out in U937 or Xenopus oocyte, respectively, 0.9 mm ATP, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm MnCl2 and 0.2% methylcellulose. Three microliters of the reaction were squashed between a slide and a 22-mm2 coverslip that was sealed with VALAP (a 1:1:1 mix of Vaseline, lanolin, and paraffin). Rhodamine fluorescence was observed directly using a N2.1 filter set on a DM-RE Leica microscope.

https://openalex.org/W2054569061,"Methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs) are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze the thioredoxin-dependent reduction of methionine sulfoxide (MetSO) back to methionine. In vivo, Msrs are essential in protecting cells against oxidative damages on proteins and in the virulence of some bacteria. There exists two structurally unrelated classes of Msrs. MsrAs are stereo-specific toward the S epimer on the sulfur of the sulfoxide, whereas MsrBs are specific toward the R isomer. Both classes of Msrs display a similar catalytic mechanism of sulfoxide reduction by thiols via the sulfenic acid chemistry and a better affinity for protein-bound MetSO than for free MetSO. Recently, the role of the amino acids implicated in the catalysis of the reductase step of Neisseria meningitidis MsrA was determined. In the present study, the invariant amino acids potentially involved in substrate binding, i.e. Phe-52, Trp-53, Asp-129, His-186, Tyr-189, and Tyr-197, were substituted. The catalytic parameters under steady-state conditions and of the reductase step of the mutated MsrAs were determined and compared with those of the wild type. Altogether, the results support the presence of at least two binding subsites. The first one, whose contribution is major in the efficiency of the reductase step and in which the ∊-methyl group of MetSO binds, is the hydrophobic pocket formed by Phe-52 and Trp-53, the position of the indole ring being stabilized by interactions with His-186 and Tyr-189. The second subsite composed of Asp-129 and Tyr-197 contributes to the binding of the main chain of the substrate but to a lesser extent.

Methionine is one of the amino acids in proteins that is the most sensitive to reactive oxygen species (1Vogt W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). It is converted into methionine sulfoxide (MetSO), 2The abbreviations used are: MetSO, methionine sulfoxide; AcMetSONHMe, Ac-l-Met-R,S-SO-NHMe; AcMetNHMe, Ac-l-Met-NHMe; Msr, methionine sulfoxide reductase; Trx, thioredoxin. the function of which is a mixture of two epimers at the sulfur atom, i.e. Met-S-SO and Met-R-SO (2Schoneich C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Formation of MetSO may impair the biological function of the oxidized proteins, depending on the location of the MetSO in the protein. There exist two structurally unrelated classes of methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs) in most organisms, called MsrA and MsrB, which selectively reduce free or protein-bound Met-S-SO and Met-R-SO, respectively. Msrs are described to exert various biological functions in vivo (3Moskovitz J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 4Weissbach H. Resnick L.

They can (i) repair oxidized proteins, and thus, may regulate their function, (ii) play an antioxidant role as oxidation of surface methionine residues is considered as a mechanism that scavenges reactive oxygen species without modification of the properties of proteins, and (iii) play a role in the virulence of some bacteria.

The catalytic mechanism is in agreement with the kinetic mechanism, which was shown to be of ping-pong type for both classes of Msrs (9Boschi-Muller S. Olry A. Antoine M. Branlant G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 10Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Branlant G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2272-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, for both classes of Msrs, the overall rate-limiting step is associated with the Trx-recycling process, whereas the rate of formation of the intradisulfide bond is governed by that of the reductase step, the rate of which is fast (11Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A theoretical study of the reduction mechanism of sulfoxides by thiols has been recently investigated by quantum chemistry calculations, which supports formation of a sulfurane intermediate (13Balta B. Monard G. Ruiz-Lopez M.F. Antoine M. Gand A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2006; 110: 7628-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The amino acids involved in the catalysis of the reductase step of Neisseria meningitidis MsrA have also recently been characterized by molecular enzymology approaches (14Antoine M. Gand A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39062-39070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The invariant Glu-94, 3In this report, MsrA amino acid numbering is based on E. coli MsrA sequence (9Boschi-Muller S. Olry A. Antoine M. Branlant G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). and to a lesser extent Tyr-82 and Tyr-134, were shown to play a major role in the stabilization of the transition state of sulfurane type and indirectly in the decrease of the pKapp of the catalytic Cys-51. A scenario was proposed in which the substrate binds to the active site with its sulfoxide function largely polarized via interactions with Glu-94, Tyr-82, and Tyr-134 and participates via the positive or partially positive charge borne by the sulfur of the sulfoxide to the stabilization of the catalytic Cys. The three-dimensional structures of the MsrAs from Escherichia coli, Bos taurus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and poplar have been recently obtained by x-ray crystallography (15Tete-Favier F.

The MsrA models describe a single-domain protein composed of a central core around which the long N- and C-terminal coils seem to wind. The overall fold is of the mixed α/β type, with the core containing a two-layer sandwich, α-β plaits motif. The active site can be represented as an opened basin easily accessible to the MetSO substrate in which the catalytic Cys-51 is situated at the entrance of the first α-helix of the central core. In all the structures, the active site is occupied by a molecule that is covalently or noncovalently bound to the Cys-51. In particular, in the E. coli MsrA, a dimethyl arsenate is covalently bound, whereas in the M. tuberculosis MsrA, a methionine residue (Met-1) from a neighboring monomer occupies the active site. In both cases, a water molecule is present, the position of which can mimic the oxygen atom of the sulfoxide function of the substrate. One of the methyl groups of the dimethyl arsenate and the ∊-methyl group of Met-1 are bound to a hydrophobic pocket formed by invariant Phe-52 and Trp-53 residues. The Trp-53 indole ring is in interactions with invariant His-186 and Tyr-189 residues, whereas invariant Asp-129 and Tyr-197 residues are in a position to interact with the NH main chain of the Met-1 that occupies the active site of the M. tuberculosis MsrA (see Fig. 1 and see “Results and Discussion” under the paragraph “Rationale for the Substitutions”). In view of this information, it was reasonable to postulate that Phe-52, Trp-53, His-186, Tyr-189, directly or indirectly, and Asp-129 and Tyr-197 residues are involved in the binding of the MetSO substrate via the ∊-methyl group and the main chain, respectively. In the present study, all these residues of MsrA from N. meningitidis were substituted to validate their role. The catalytic parameters under steady-state conditions and of the reductase step of the mutated MsrAs were determined and compared with those of the wild type. Altogether, the results support the presence of at least two subsites involved in substrate binding. The first one, whose contribution is major, is the hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of invariant Phe-52 and Trp-53, the position of the latter being stabilized by interactions with His-186 and Tyr-189. The second subsite is composed of the side chains of invariant residues Asp-129 and Tyr-197. Site-directed Mutagenesis, Production, and Purification of Mutated N. meningitidis MsrAs—The E. coli strain used for all N. meningitidis MsrA productions was BE002 (MG1655 msrA::specW, msrB::a3kana), transformed with plasmid pSKPILBMsrA containing only the coding sequence of MsrA from pilB, under the lac promoter (7Olry A.

The BE002 strain was kindly provided by Dr F. Barras. Its use prevented expression of endogenous wild-type MsrA and MsrB from E. coli, and thus, avoided any contamination of the activity of the N. meningitidis MsrA by the Msrs from E. coli. Site-directed mutageneses were performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Purifications were realized as described previously (11Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mutated MsrAs were pure, as verified by electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining and by electrospray mass spectrometry analyses. Enzymes were stored as described previously. The molecular concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, using extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 26,200 m-1·cm-1 for all mutated MsrAs except W53A and W53F MsrAs, which corresponded to an extinction coefficient of 20,480 m-1·cm-1. Steady-state MsrA Kinetics in the Presence of the Trx-recycling System—Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined with the Trx reductase recycling system (E. coli Trx reductase (1.2 μm), NADPH (0.3 mm)) with saturating concentration of E. coli Trx (100 μm) and by varying the concentrations of AcMetSONHMe. Initial rate measurements were carried out at 25 °C in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8) on a Kontron Uvikon 933 spectrophotometer by following the decrease of the absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADPH. Initial rate data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten relationship using least squares analysis to determine kcat and Km for AcMetSONHMe. E. coli Trx1 and Trx reductase were prepared following experimental procedures already published (19Mulrooney S.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Mossner E. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Ac-l-Met-R,S-SO-NHMe was prepared and purified as described previously (12Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Properties of Mutated MsrAs—The fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of mutated MsrAs, in their reduced and Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide states, were recorded on an flx spectrofluorometer (SAFAS) thermostated at 25 °C in buffer A with 10 μm of each protein, as described previously (11Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For the determination of λmax of the emission spectrum and of the fluorescence intensity at λmax, the excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and the emission was measured from 300 to 450 nm using a 10-nm band-pass for excitation and emission. Determination of the Rate of AcMetNHMe Formation by Single Turnover Quenched-flow Experiments for W53F MsrA—Quenched-flow measurements were carried out at 25 °C on a SX18MV-R stopped-flow apparatus (Applied PhotoPhysics) fitted for double mixing and adapted to recover the quenched samples, as described previously (11Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The apparatus operated in a pulsed mode. Under the conditions used, a minimum aging time of about 25-40 ms was determined. Equal volumes (57.5 μl) of a solution containing 550 μm of W53F MsrA in buffer A and a solution containing AcMetSONHMe in buffer A were mixed in the aging loop. The mixture was then allowed to react for the desired time before being mixed with 115 μl of a quenched aqueous solution containing 2% of trifluoroacetic acid. Quenched samples were collected in a 200-μl loop. For each aging time, four shots were done, and the four corresponding quenched samples were pooled in a volume of 700 μl and then analyzed. After centrifugation, AcMetNHMe quantification in the resulting supernatant was carried out by reverse phase chromatography; 100 μl were injected onto a 4.6 × 250-mm Atlantis dC18 reverse phase column (Waters) on an AKTA explorer system (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with H2O/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. AcMetNHMe was eluted after AcMetSONHMe, with a linear gradient of acetonitrile. Data were plotted as mol of AcMetNHMe formed per mol of MsrA as a function of time. The rate of AcMetNHMe formation was determined by fitting the curve to the monoexponential Equation 1, in which a represents the fraction of AcMetNHMe formed per mol of MsrA and kAcMetNHMe, the rate constant. y=a(1-e-kAcMetNHMe t)(Eq.1) Kinetics of the Formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 MsrA Disulfide Bond in the Absence of Reductant by Single Turnover Stopped-flow Experiment at pH 8—Kinetics of the Trp-53 fluorescence variation associated with the formation of the Cys-51/Cys-198 disulfide bond were measured for F52L, D129A, D129N, H186A, H186N, Y189A, Y189F, Y197A, and Y197F MsrAs at 25 °C on a SX18MV-R stopped-flow apparatus (Applied PhotoPhysics) fitted for fluorescence measurements, as described previously (11Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was set at 284 nm, and the emitted light was collected using a 320-nm cutoff filter. One syringe contained MsrA in buffer A (10 μm final concentration after mixing), and the other one contained AcMetSONHMe at various concentrations, i.e. up to 200 mm for Y197A and Y197F MsrAs and up to 800 mm for F52L, D129A, D129N, H186A, H186N, Y189A, and Y189F MsrAs in buffer A. An average of at least six runs was recorded for each AcMetSONHMe concentration. Rate constants, kobs, were obtained by fitting fluorescence traces with the monoexponential Equation 2, in which c represents the end point and a represents the amplitude of the fluorescence increase (<0). For all mutated MsrAs, the variation of the fluorescence signal as a function of time was of monoexponential type irrespective of the substrate concentration used. y=ae-kobst+c(Eq.2) When saturating concentrations of AcMetSONHMe were observed (for H186N and Y189F MsrAs), the data were fit to Equation 3 using least square analysis to determine kobs max and KS for AcMetSONHMe. S represents the AcMetSONHMe concentration and KS the apparent affinity constant. kobs=kobs maxSkS+S(Eq.3) To determine the pseudo-second-order constant (k2) values, subsaturating concentrations of AcMetSONHMe were used, from 1 to 50 mm for F52L, D129A, D129N, H186A, H186N, Y189A, Y197A, and Y197F MsrAs and from 1 to 20 mm for wild-type and Y189F MsrAs. The slope (k2) of the rate constant (kobs) plotted against the substrate concentration was obtained by linear fitting. For D129A, D129N, Y197A, Y197F, and wild-type MsrAs, k2 values were also determined with subsaturating concentrations of l-Met-R,S-SO and dimethyl sulfoxide as a substrate. As indicated in the Introduction, invariant Phe-52 and Trp-53 form a hydrophobic pocket in which one of the methyl groups of dimethyl arsenate in E. coli MsrA and the ∊-methyl group of Met-1 in M. tuberculosis MsrA is bound (Fig. 1). Therefore, this strongly supported binding of the ∊-methyl group of MetSO to this pocket. Inspection of the MsrA active sites also shows the existence of (i) a hydrogen bond between the NH group of the Trp-53 indole ring and the Nδ of His-186 (distance of 2.9 Å) and (ii) a stacking of the Trp-53 indole ring with the phenyl ring of Tyr-189, the two aromatic rings being parallel at 3.4 Å from each other. These interactions are likely essential to stabilize the positioning of the indole ring adequate for efficient binding of the MetSO substrate via its ∊-methyl group. Thus, two types of substitutions were performed: 1) those that are expected to significantly perturb the binding of the ∊-methyl of the substrate, either directly (F52L, 4For unknown reasons, it was not possible to produce F52V and F52A MsrAs. W53A, and W53F MsrAs) or indirectly (H186A and Y189A MsrAs), and thus, can lead to a KS and a kobs max effects; and 2) those that conserve the ability to position efficiently the indole ring of Trp-53 (H186N by hydrogen bond via the amide function and Y189F by stacking via the phenyl ring) and therefore are expected to have little effect on the kinetic parameters of the reductase step. As mentioned in the Introduction, Asp-129 and Tyr-197 were postulated to stabilize the main chain of the substrate. Indeed, the inspection of the M. tuberculosis MsrA active site, which is occupied by the Met-1 residue, shows that the carboxylate group of Asp-129 makes two hydrogen bonds: 1) one with the NHα of Met-1 engaged in a peptidic bond with His-0 and 2) the other with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-197. Moreover, the Tyr-197 phenyl ring also forms a stacking interaction with the peptide bond between His-0 and Met-1. Thus, to determine their role, Asp-129 and Tyr-197 residues were both substituted: 1) by Ala to disrupt all the stabilizing interactions that can exist and 2) by Asn and Phe, respectively, to conserve one putative stabilizing interaction. As indicated in the Introduction, the rate of the reductase step in MsrA is fast and largely higher than the kcat value. Therefore, to interpret the consequences of a substitution on the kinetic parameters of the reductase step, it was necessary to attain the rate of the reductase step for each mutated MsrA. For that, we took advantage of the Trp-53 fluorescence emission signal intensity of all the mutated MsrAs, except for W53F MsrA, which varied from the reduced to the oxidized disulfide form. In fact, formation of the disulfide bond led to an increase in the Trp-53 fluorescence emission for D129A, D129N, H186N, Y189F, Y197A, and Y197F MsrAs similarly to that described for the wild type (11Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas a quenching was observed for F52L, H186A, and Y189A MsrAs, which is due to an increase of the fluorescence intensity of the reduced form of these mutated MsrAs (see below, paragraph “Fluorescence Properties of F52L, H186A/H186N, and Y189A/Y189F MsrAs”). For all mutated MsrAs, the rate of the reductase step was determined under single turnover conditions, i.e. in the absence of reductant as already described for the wild type (11Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In that context, we have assumed that the reductase step was still rate-determining in the process, leading to formation of the Msr disulfide bond, as demonstrated previously for the wild type (11Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For all mutated MsrAs, k2 values that are representative of the kobs max/KS values were determined under subsaturating concentrations of AcMetSONHMe. When saturating concentration of AcMetSONHMe was observed, KS and kobs max values were also determined. In the absence of the fluorescent probe Trp-53, the kinetics of the reductase step for the W53F MsrA was attained by following the rate of formation of AcMetNHMe under single turnover conditions, i.e. in the absence of reductant (11Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This was done only at two concentrations of AcMetSONHMe (300 and 600 mm) with the use of a rapid mixing apparatus. Formation of ∼0.9 mol of AcMetNHMe/mol of W53F MsrA was observed for both substrate concentrations. The kinetic experiments were performed with AcMetSONHMe as a substrate for all mutated MsrAs. The rationale is that the wild-type MsrA was previously shown to exhibit a better affinity for AcMetSONHMe (KS value of 55 mm) when compared with MetSO, i.e. by a factor of at least 20, in the reductase step (9Boschi-Muller S. Olry A. Antoine M. Branlant G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 11Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, AcMetSONHMe can be considered as a better mimic of MetSO included in proteins when compared with free MetSO. For mutated MsrAs at positions 129 and 197, k2 values were determined not only with AcMetSONHMe but also with MetSO and Me2SO. Indeed, comparison of the k2 values can provide information on the structural factors that are responsible for the enhanced affinity of MsrA for AcMetSONHMe. Kinetic Properties of F52L and W53F/W53A MsrAs—As shown in Table 1, the substitution of Phe-52 by Leu and Trp-53 by Phe or Ala resulted in a significant increase of the Km value for AcMetSONHMe from 60- to 1300-fold, whereas the kcat value decreased in the range of only 4-11-fold. Under single turnover conditions, no saturating kinetic effects with respect to AcMetSONHMe were observed for F52L MsrA up to 800 mm substrate (Fig. 2A). The kobs value determined at 800 mm substrate was 16-fold higher than the kcat value for F52L MsrA, indicating a rate-limiting step still associated with the Trx-recycling step. The k2 value of 0.02 mm-1·s-1 decreased 745-fold when compared with that of the wild type. For W53F MsrA, kobs values of 5.2 and 8.5 s-1 for AcMetNHMe formation were determined at 300 and 600 mm AcMetSONHMe, respectively (Fig. 3). These data indicated: 1) a rate-limiting step still associated with the Trx-recycling step and 2) a substrate saturating effect not yet attained at 600 mm AcMetSONHMe. A k2 value of ∼0.015 mm-1·s-1 can be estimated that is ∼1000-fold smaller than the k2 value of the wild type (Table 1). For both W53F and F52L MsrAs, the kobs value at a substrate concentration of 600 and 800 mm, respectively, is at least 80-fold lower than the kobs max of the wild type. Therefore, the 750-1000-fold decrease in k2 reflects both a kobs max effect and a KS effect. Therefore, it is probable that substituting Phe for Trp-53 and Leu for Phe-52 disrupts, in part, the hydrophobic pocket, and as a consequence, not only decreases the affinity of the substrate by a factor that can be estimated to be at least 20 but also perturbs the positioning of the sulfoxide function relative to that of the catalytic amino acids involved in the sulfoxide reduction. The situation is probably the same and even more pronounced when Trp-53 is substituted by Ala, as suggested by the very high Km value for the substrate (800 mm when compared with 0.6 mm for the wild type).TABLE 1Steady-state and reductase step kinetic parameters of wild-type and mutated MsrAs Steady-state parameters were deduced from nonlinear regression of initial rates to the Michaelis-Menten relationship. k2 values of the reductase step were obtained by linear regression of kobs determined under subsaturating concentration of substrate (see “Experimental Procedures”). It is important to note that the Km values have to be divided by 2 and the k2 values have to be multiplied by 2, taking into account the fact that the R isomer of the sulfoxide function is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of MsrA (7Olry A.

The Km values varied slightly for the H186N and Y189F MsrAs (4-fold increase and 2-fold decrease, respectively) but were strongly increased for the H186A and Y189A MsrAs (165- and 57-fold, respectively) when compared with that of the wild type. Under single turnover conditions, a saturating kinetics effect with respect to AcMetSONHMe concentration was only observed for H186N and Y189F MsrAs, whereas no saturating effect was observed for H186A and Y189A MsrAs up to 800 mm (Fig. 2, A and B). The kobs values determined at 800 mm substrate were 11-, 52-, 190-, and 444-fold higher than the kcat values for H186A, Y189A, H186N, and Y189F MsrAs, respectively, indicating a rate-limiting step still associated with the Trx-recycling step. The KS, kobs max, and k2 values determined for H186N and Y189F MsrAs were in the range of those determined for the wild type (Fig. 2B and Table 1). This was not the case when His-186 or Tyr-189 was substituted by Ala, as probed by the 124- and 25-fold k2 decrease observed, respectively. The k2 decreases reflect both a KS effect and a kobs max effect since the kobs values determined at 800 mm AcMetSONHMe were decreased by 27- and 6-fold for H186A and Y189A MsrAs, respectively, when compared with the kobs max value of the wild type. When compared with the W53F MsrA, the k2 values for H186A and Y189A are decreased less. Altogether, the kinetic data are thus in accord with the postulated role of His-186 and Tyr-189 that favored an efficient positioning of the Trp-53 indole ring via a hydrogen bond and a stacking interaction, respectively. This also agrees with the fact that the conservative substitutions of His-186 and Tyr-189 by Asn and Phe, respectively, have no significant effect on the catalytic efficiency of the reductase step. Fluorescence Properties of F52L, H186A/H186N, and Y189A/Y189F MsrAs—Previous work showed that the fluorescence properties of wild-type MsrA, when excitation was performed at 295 nm, were only due to the contribution of Trp-53 and consequently reflect the microenvironment of the Trp-53 indole ring (11Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Comparison of the emission spectra of all mutated MsrAs with that of the wild-type, of either the reduced or the oxidized disulfide forms, showed no difference except for the reduced form of F52L, H186A, and Y189A MsrAs (spectra not shown). For these mutated MsrAs, the λmax is shifted from 338 to 346 nm, which reflects a microenvironment of the indole side chains of Trp-53 more polar than in the reduced forms of the wild type and the other mutated MsrAs. This is likely due to an increased accessibility of Trp-53 to solvent. Moreover, in contrast to other mutated MsrAs, in particular to H186N and Y189F MsrAs, F52L, H186A, and Y189A MsrAs display a 3.8-, 2.3-, and 2.7-fold increase of the fluorescence intensity at λmax, respectively, when compared with that of the wild type (spectra not shown). This reflects a lesser quenching of the Trp-53 fluorescence. As already mentioned, inspection of the x-ray MsrA structure shows a π-π stacking interaction between the phenyl ring of Tyr-189 and the indole ring of Trp-53. Therefore, Tyr-189 is a good candidate as the quencher of the Trp-53 fluorescence in the wild type. This is in accord with the increase of the Trp-53 fluorescence intensity, which is observed in Y189A MsrA but not in Y189F MsrA that still possesses a phenyl ring. The increase of the fluorescence intensity observed for H186A MsrA and F52L MsrA suggests a separation taking place between Trp-53 and the phenyl ring of Tyr-189 in both mutated MsrAs. In both cases, it is probable that the positioning of the indole ring relative to that of Tyr-189 is perturbed. For H186A, it is likely the consequence of the loss of a hydrogen bond with the indole ring of Trp-53. As a support, H186N MsrA, which conserves the capacity of forming a hydrogen bond, displays similar λmax and fluorescence intensity as the wild type. In the case of F52L, it is probable that substituting Leu for Phe-52 disrupts, in part, the hydrophobic pocket, and in return, destabilizes the positioning of Trp-53 relative to Tyr-189. These interpretations are in accord with the KS effects observed for F52L, H186A, and Y189A MsrAs. The kinetic parameters of D129A, D129N, Y197A, and Y197F MsrAs determined under steady-state conditions showed that the kcat value was not modified, whereas the Km value was increased 16-, 10-, 2.5-, and 5-fold, respectively, when compared with those of the wild type (Table 1). Under single turnover conditions in the absence of reductant, no kinetic saturation effect was observed up to 800 and 200 mm AcMetSONHMe for D129A/D129N and Y197A/Y197F 5For Y197A/Y197F MsrAs, the variation of the fluorescence signal as a function of time becomes, for an unknown reason, not significant for substrate concentration higher than 200 mm. MsrAs, respectively (Fig. 2C). The kobs values determined at substrate concentration of 800 mm for D129A and D129N MsrAs and of 200 mm for Y197A and Y197F MsrAs were 141-, 133-, 208-, and 110-fold higher than their corresponding kcat values, indicating a rate-limiting step still associated with the Trx-recycling step for all these mutated MsrAs. The k2 values were 37-, 19-, 8-, and 3-fold decreased for D129A, D129N, Y197A, and Y197F MsrAs, respectively, when compared with that of the wild type (Table 1). These decreases in k2 reflect essentially a KS effect since the kobs values determined at 800 and 200 mm AcMetSONHMe decreased only 2-3-fold for D129A/D129N and Y197A/Y197F MsrAs, respectively, when compared with the kobs max value of the wild type. The fact that Asp-129 and Tyr-197 were predicted from the three-dimensional structure of MsrA from M. tuberculosis complexed with a Met residue to stabilize the main chain of the substrate raised the question whether they can discriminate in favor of the binding of a protein-bound MetSO against the binding of free MetSO. Indeed, MsrA displays a better affinity of at least 20-fold for AcMetSONHMe when compared with free MetSO. As shown in Table 2, substituting Asp-129 by Ala or Asn and Tyr-197 by Ala or Phe also affected the k2 values with MetSO as a substrate with the same magnitude as with AcMetSONHMe, in contrast to Me2SO, for which the k2 values are not significantly modified except for D129A MsrA. Altogether, the data support: 1) a nondiscriminating role of Asp-129 and Tyr-197 in the recognition of the NH main chain of the MetSO with the amino and carboxyl groups of MetSO either free, and thus, charged, or engaged in amide bonds, as is the case for a protein-bound MetSO; and 2) a higher contribution of Asp-129 to the substrate binding when compared with Tyr-197. Nevertheless, the fact that a phenyl ring can make interaction with a peptidic bond as well as with a protonated amine (21Gruez A. Roig-Zamboni V. Grisel S. Salomoni A. Valencia C. Campanacci V. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Tsou L.K. Tatko C.D. Waters M.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 14917-14921Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) prevents discrimination between a direct role of Tyr-197 in substrate binding or an indirect role, via the orientation of the carboxylate group of Asp-129. Anyway, the contribution of Asp-129 and Tyr-197 remains modest when compared with that of Phe-52 and Trp-53 in terms of KS values.TABLE 2Reductase step second order rate constants k2 of wild-type and mutated MsrAs with different sulfoxide substrates k2 values of the reductase step were obtained by linear regression of kobs determined under subsaturating concentration of substrate (see “Experimental Procedures”). The number in brackets represents the k2 value of mutated MsrAs when compared with the k2 value of the wild type expressed in percentage. It is important to note that the k2 constant for Ac-l-Met-R,S-SO-NHMe and for l-Met-R,S-SO, in contrast to the k2 constant for Me2SO, have to be multiplied by 2, taking into account the fact that the R isomer of the sulfoxide function is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of MsrA (7Olry A.

These factors, if existing, remain to be characterized. In that context, determination of the three-dimensional structure of a complex between a MsrA and a protein MetSO substrate could provide additional information to those obtained from the three-dimensional structure of MsrA from M. tuberculosis complexed with a Met residue. We have shown that for MsrA: 1) the hydrophobic pocket, formed by the side chains of invariant Phe-52 and Trp-53, is the major factor that contributes to MetSO binding via interactions with the ∊-methyl group; 2) invariant His-186 and Tyr-189 are key residues for orienting the Trp-53 indole ring, the positioning of which is essential for an efficient reductase activity to occur; and 3) the side chains of invariant residues Asp-129 and Tyr-197 participate in the substrate binding but are not discriminating in terms of binding between a MetSO either engaged in amide bonds or with amino and carboxyl groups free. The KI value of MsrA for AcMetNHMe is at least 2 m (data not shown). This shows a low affinity of MsrA for AcMetNHMe, although the ∊-methyl group is present. As indicated in the Introduction, Glu-94, Tyr-82, and Tyr-134 are involved in catalysis but not in substrate binding. Moreover, a MetSO substrate such as AcMetSONHMe is bound to the active site with its sulfoxide function largely polarized via interactions with Glu-94, Tyr-82, and Tyr-134. Therefore, the sulfur of the sulfoxide function bears a positive charge, or at least a partial charge, and thus, participates by a substrate-assisted mechanism to interacting and stabilizing the thiolate form of Cys-51 (14Antoine M. Gand A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39062-39070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, the sulfur of AcMetNHMe is rather negatively charged (23Chipot C. Angyan J.G. Maigret B. Scheraga H.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 9788-9796Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Guillot R. Muzet N. Dahaoui S. Lecomte C. Jelsch C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 567-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, a repulsive electrostatic interaction is expected to occur between the sulfur of Cys-51 and the sulfur of the product, which can be considered as an anti-determinant factor that disfavors binding of product such as AcMetNHMe. The consequence is either a higher rate of dissociation of the product from the MsrA-product complex when compared with that of a MsrA-MetSO complex and/or a lower rate of association of the product to MsrA when compared with that of MetSO substrate, and thus, would explain the low affinity of MsrA for AcMetNHMe."
https://openalex.org/W2081797209,"Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a key player in cancer progression and an attractive target for cancer therapy. Several small molecule inhibitors of HIF-1α also induce a DNA damage response. However, whether or not DNA damage is required for or associated with the inhibition of HIF-1α protein accumulation is poorly understood. In this report we investigated the effects of distinct DNA damaging conditions on the hypoxic induction of HIF-1α protein in cancer cell lines. We demonstrate that in addition to topotecan (TPT), a known inhibitor of HIF-1α, UVC, but not other DNA damaging agents (cisplatin, ionizing radiation and doxorubicin), inhibited HIF-1α protein accumulation in a dose-dependent, p53-independent fashion. Low doses UVC decreased HIF-1α translation without affecting global protein synthesis. Inhibition of HIF-1α by UVC required ongoing RNA transcription, but not DNA replication. Moreover, a functional ATR was required for the activation of DNA damage-dependent responses by both UVC and TPT, but was dispensable for the inhibition of HIF-1α protein. Notably, unlike TPT, inhibition of HIF-1α protein by UVC did not require topoisomerase I, suggesting a similar yet distinct mode of action. Our data reveal that UVC is a novel signal associated with inhibition of HIF-1α protein accumulation, and they uncouple the DNA damage-dependent signaling pathway exerted by UVC and TPT from HIF-1α inhibition."
