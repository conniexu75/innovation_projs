https://openalex.org/W2522738868,"Exposure to ambient air pollution is widespread and may be detrimental to human brain development and a potential risk factor for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We conducted a systematic review of the human evidence on the relationship between ASD and exposure to all airborne pollutants, including particulate matter air pollutants and others (e.g. pesticides and metals).To answer the question: ""is developmental exposure to air pollution associated with ASD?""We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature, identified relevant studies using inclusion/exclusion criteria pre-specified in our protocol (registered in PROSPERO, CRD # 42015017890), evaluated the potential risk of bias for each included study and identified an appropriate subset of studies to combine in a meta-analysis. We then rated the overall quality and strength of the evidence collectively across all air pollutants.Of 1,158 total references identified, 23 human studies met our inclusion criteria (17 case-control, 4 ecological, 2 cohort). Risk of bias was generally low across studies for most domains; study limitations were related to potential confounding and accuracy of exposure assessment methods. We rated the quality of the body of evidence across all air pollutants as ""moderate."" From our meta-analysis, we found statistically significant summary odds ratios (ORs) of 1.07 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.08) per 10-μg/m3 increase in PM10 exposure (n = 6 studies) and 2.32 (95% CI: 2.15, 2.51) per 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure (n = 3 studies). For pollutants not included in a meta-analysis, we collectively evaluated evidence from each study in rating the strength and quality of overall evidence considering factors such as inconsistency, imprecision, and evidence of dose-response. All included studies generally showed increased risk of ASD with increasing exposure to air pollution, although not consistently across all chemical components.After considering strengths and limitations of the body of research, we concluded that there is ""limited evidence of toxicity"" for the association between early life exposure to air pollution as a whole and diagnosis of ASD. The strongest evidence was between prenatal exposure to particulate matter and ASD. However, the small number of studies in the meta-analysis and unexplained statistical heterogeneity across the individual study estimates means that the effect could be larger or smaller (including not significant) than these studies estimate. Our research supports the need for health protective public policy to reduce exposures to harmful airborne contaminants among pregnant women and children and suggests opportunities for optimizing future research."
https://openalex.org/W2522746465,"In mice, glutamatergic globus pallidus neurons projecting to the lateral habenula (GPh neurons) bi-directionally encode positive and negative prediction error signals that are critical for outcome evaluation and are driven by a subset of basal ganglia circuits. The basal ganglia play a crucial role in action selection, but their involvement in evaluating the outcome of actions is less well understood. Bo Li and colleagues show that in mice, glutamatergic globus pallidus neurons projecting to the lateral habenula (GPh neurons) evaluate positive and negative action outcomes, thereby biasing subsequent actions, and this requires inhibitory and excitatory inputs to the GPh, respectively. Identifying the origin of these inputs in the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus, the authors propose that information about the selection and evaluation of actions is channelled through distinct, though intermingled, basal ganglia circuits. The basal ganglia, a group of subcortical nuclei, play a crucial role in decision-making by selecting actions and evaluating their outcomes1,2. While much is known about the function of the basal ganglia circuitry in selection1,3,4, how these nuclei contribute to outcome evaluation is less clear. Here we show that neurons in the habenula-projecting globus pallidus (GPh) in mice are essential for evaluating action outcomes and are regulated by a specific set of inputs from the basal ganglia. We find in a classical conditioning task that individual mouse GPh neurons bidirectionally encode whether an outcome is better or worse than expected. Mimicking these evaluation signals with optogenetic inhibition or excitation is sufficient to reinforce or discourage actions in a decision-making task. Moreover, cell-type-specific synaptic manipulations reveal that the inhibitory and excitatory inputs to the GPh are necessary for mice to appropriately evaluate positive and negative feedback, respectively. Finally, using rabies-virus-assisted monosynaptic tracing5, we show that the GPh is embedded in a basal ganglia circuit wherein it receives inhibitory input from both striosomal and matrix compartments of the striatum, and excitatory input from the ‘limbic’ regions of the subthalamic nucleus. Our results provide evidence that information about the selection and evaluation of actions is channelled through distinct sets of basal ganglia circuits, with the GPh representing a key locus in which information of opposing valence is integrated to determine whether action outcomes are better or worse than expected."

https://openalex.org/W2521959277,"This paper presents an experimental characterization of millimeter-wave (mm-wave) channels in the 6.5 GHz, 10.5 GHz, 15 GHz, 19 GHz, 28 GHz and 38 GHz frequency bands in an indoor corridor environment. More than 4,000 power delay profiles were measured across the bands using an omnidirectional transmitter antenna and a highly directional horn receiver antenna for both co- and cross-polarized antenna configurations. This paper develops a new path-loss model to account for the frequency attenuation with distance, which we term the frequency attenuation (FA) path-loss model and introduce a frequency-dependent attenuation factor. The large-scale path loss was characterized based on both new and well-known path-loss models. A general and less complex method is also proposed to estimate the cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) factor of close-in reference distance with the XPD (CIX) and ABG with the XPD (ABGX) path-loss models to avoid the computational complexity of minimum mean square error (MMSE) approach. Moreover, small-scale parameters such as root mean square (RMS) delay spread, mean excess (MN-EX) delay, dispersion factors and maximum excess (MAX-EX) delay parameters were used to characterize the multipath channel dispersion. Multiple statistical distributions for RMS delay spread were also investigated. The results show that our proposed models are simpler and more physically-based than other well-known models. The path-loss exponents for all studied models are smaller than that of the free-space model by values in the range of 0.1 to 1.4 for all measured frequencies. The RMS delay spread values varied between 0.2 ns and 13.8 ns, and the dispersion factor values were less than 1 for all measured frequencies. The exponential and Weibull probability distribution models best fit the RMS delay spread empirical distribution for all of the measured frequencies in all scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2521128606,"Bat guano is a relatively untapped reservoir of information, having great utility as a DNA source because it is often available at roosts even when bats are not and is an easy type of sample to collect from a difficult-to-study mammalian order. Recent advances from microbial community studies in primer design, sequencing, and analysis enable fast, accurate, and cost-effective species identification. Here, we borrow from this discipline to develop an order-wide DNA mini-barcode assay (Species from Feces) based on a segment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I (COI). The assay works effectively with fecal DNA and is conveniently transferable to low-cost, high-throughput Illumina MiSeq technology that also allows simultaneous pairing with other markers. Our PCR primers target a region of COI that is highly discriminatory among Chiroptera (92% species-level identification of barcoded species), and are sufficiently degenerate to allow hybridization across diverse bat taxa. We successfully validated our system with 54 bat species across both suborders. Despite abundant arthropod prey DNA in guano, our primers were highly specific to bats; no arthropod DNA was detected in thousands of feces run on Sanger and Illumina platforms. The assay is extendable to fecal pellets of unknown age as well as individual and pooled guano, to allow for individual (using singular fecal pellets) and community (using combined pellets collected from across long-term roost sites) analyses. We developed a searchable database (http://nau.edu/CEFNS/Forestry/Research/Bats/Search-Tool/) that allows users to determine the discriminatory capability of our markers for bat species of interest. Our assay has applications worldwide for examining disease impacts on vulnerable species, determining species assemblages within roosts, and assessing the presence of bat species that are vulnerable or facing extinction. The development and analytical pathways are rapid, reliable, and inexpensive, and can be applied to ecology and conservation studies of other taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2523151964,"Objective Mild traumatic brain injury is a major public health issue and is a particular concern in sports. One of the most difficult issues with respect to mild traumatic brain injury involves the diagnosis of the disorder. Typically, diagnosis is made by a constellation of physical exam findings. However, in order to best manage mild traumatic brain injury, it is critically important to develop objective tests that substantiate the diagnosis. With objective tests the disorder can be better characterized, more accurately diagnosed, and studied more effectively. In addition, prevention and treatments can be applied where necessary. Methods Two cohorts each of fifty subjects with mild traumatic brain injury and one hundred controls were evaluated with a battery of oculomotor, vestibular and reaction time related tests applied to a population of individuals with mild traumatic brain injury as compared to controls. Results We demonstrated pattern differences between the two groups and showed how three of these tests yield an 89% sensitivity and 95% specificity for confirming a current diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury. Interpretation These results help better characterize the oculomotor, vestibular, and reaction time differences between those the mild traumatic brain injury and non-affected individuals. This characterization will allow for the development of more effective point of care neurologic diagnostic techniques and allow for more targeted treatment which may allow for quicker return to normal activity."
https://openalex.org/W2522503981,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a critical role in regulating airway epithelial homeostasis and responses to injury. Activation of EGFR is regulated by redox-dependent processes involving reversible cysteine oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and involves both ligand-dependent and -independent mechanisms, but the precise source(s) of ROS and the molecular mechanisms that control tyrosine kinase activity are incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of EGFR activation by ATP in airway epithelial cells is closely associated with dynamic reversible oxidation of cysteine residues via sequential sulfenylation and S-glutathionylation within EGFR and the non-receptor-tyrosine kinase Src. Moreover, the intrinsic kinase activity of recombinant Src or EGFR was in both cases enhanced by H2O2 but not by GSSG, indicating that the intermediate sulfenylation is the activating modification. H2O2-induced increase in EGFR tyrosine kinase activity was not observed with the C797S variant, confirming Cys-797 as the redox-sensitive cysteine residue that regulates kinase activity. Redox-dependent regulation of EGFR activation in airway epithelial cells was found to strongly depend on activation of either the NADPH oxidase DUOX1 or the homolog NOX2, depending on the activation mechanism. Whereas DUOX1 and Src play a primary role in EGFR transactivation by wound-derived signals such as ATP, direct ligand-dependent EGFR activation primarily involves NOX2 with a secondary role for DUOX1 and Src. Collectively, our findings establish that redox-dependent EGFR kinase activation involves a dynamic and reversible cysteine oxidation mechanism and that this activation mechanism variably involves DUOX1 and NOX2."
https://openalex.org/W2523713783,"We analyzed the effects of the clinical hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on the plasma antioxidant response and levels of endothelin-1, Interleukine-6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with chronic wounds (20.2±10.0 months without healing). They received 20 HBOT sessions (five sessions/week), and blood samples were obtained at sessions 1, 5 and 20 before and 2 hours after the HBOT. An additional blood sample was collected 1 month after wound recovery. Serum creatine kinase activity decreased progressively in accordance with the wound healing. Plasma catalase activity significantly increased after the first and fifth sessions of HBOT. Plasma myeloperoxidase activity reported significantly lower values after sessions. Plasma VEGF and IL-6 increased after sessions. Endothelin-1 levels were progressively decreasing during the HBOT, being significant at the session 20. Plasma malondialdehyde concentration was significantly reduced at the last session. Both creatine kinase activity and malondialdehyde levels were maintained lower 1 month after wound recovery respect to initial values. In conclusion, HBOT enhanced the plasma antioxidant defenses and may contribute to activate the healing resolution, angiogenesis and vascular tone regulation by increasing the VEGF and IL-6 release and the endothelin-1 decrease, which may be significant factors in stimulating wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2521500422,"Objective Fathers are increasingly involved in care of their babies and young children. We assessed the association of resident fathers’ involvement with subsequent behaviour of their children, examining boys and girls separately. Methods We used longitudinal data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study for children born in 2000–2001, divided into three separate analysis periods: ages 9 months to 3 years, 3 to 5 years, and 5 to 7 years. By exploratory factor analysis of self-reported attitudes and engagement in caring activities, we derived composite measures of various types of father involvement at 9 months, 3 and 5 years. Where possible we created equivalent measures of mother involvement. Child behaviour was assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), which was completed by the mother when the child was aged 3, 5 and 7 years. We estimated gender-specific odds ratios for behaviour problems per quintile of father involvement, using separate logistic regression models for boys and girls in each analysis period. We controlled for a wide range of potential confounders: characteristics of the child (temperament and development at 9 months, and illness and exact age at outcome), equivalent mother involvement where appropriate, and factors related to socioeconomic status, household change, and parental well-being, where statistically significant. Results Paternal positive parenting beliefs at age 9 months and increased frequency of creative play at age 5 years were significantly associated with lower risk of subsequent behaviour problems (SDQ total difficulties) in both boys and girls (p<0.05), odds ratios ranging between 0.81 and 0.89 per quintile of involvement. No associations were observed for other composite measures of caring activity by the father at 9 months, 3 years or 5 years. Conclusion Quality of parenting, rather than the division of routine care between parents, was associated with child behavioural outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2539750952,"Macrophages are important in innate and adaptive immunity. Macrophage participation in inflammation or tissue repair is directed by various extracellular signals and mediated by multiple intracellular pathways. Activation of group VIA phospholipase A2 (iPLA2β) causes accumulation of arachidonic acid, lysophospholipids, and eicosanoids that can promote inflammation and pathologic states. We examined the role of iPLA2β in peritoneal macrophage immune function by comparing wild type (WT) and iPLA2β−/− mouse macrophages. Compared with WT, iPLA2β−/− macrophages exhibited reduced proinflammatory M1 markers when classically activated. In contrast, anti-inflammatory M2 markers were elevated under naïve conditions and induced to higher levels by alternative activation in iPLA2β−/− macrophages compared with WT. Induction of eicosanoid (12-lipoxygenase (12-LO) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2))- and reactive oxygen species (NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4))-generating enzymes by classical activation pathways was also blunted in iPLA2β−/− macrophages compared with WT. The effects of inhibitors of iPLA2β, COX2, or 12-LO to reduce M1 polarization were greater than those to enhance M2 polarization. Certain lipids (lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidic acid, and prostaglandin E2) recapitulated M1 phenotype in iPLA2β−/− macrophages, but none tested promoted M2 phenotype. These findings suggest that (a) lipids generated by iPLA2β and subsequently oxidized by cyclooxygenase and 12-LO favor macrophage inflammatory M1 polarization, and (b) the absence of iPLA2β promotes macrophage M2 polarization. Reducing macrophage iPLA2β activity and thereby attenuating macrophage M1 polarization might cause a shift from an inflammatory to a recovery/repair milieu.

Macrophages facilitate adaptive immunity primarily as antigen-presenting cells (4.Martinez-Pomares L. Gordon S. Antigen presentation the macrophage way.Cell. 2007; 131: 641-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Phagocytosed proteins processed into small fragments can be presented to CD4+ T cells via the major histocompatibility class II receptor (MHC II) (5.Underhill D.M. Bassetti M. Rudensky A. Aderem A. Dynamic interactions of macrophages with T cells during antigen presentation.J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1909-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The critical role of macrophages in initiation and resolution of infection can be observed in models of macrophage depletion; in cases of macrophage insufficiency, experimental mice have an increased susceptibility to infection, and existing infections progress further than in macrophage-sufficient animals (6.Ghoneim H.E.

Immunol. 2013; 191: 1250-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Macrophages also contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer progression, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and atherosclerosis; macrophages are thus targets of emerging therapeutic regimens (7.Li J.

Macrophages in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.Cell. 2011; 145: 341-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). Macrophages also participate in autoimmune-mediated destruction of β-cells and type 1 diabetes (T1D). In diabetes-prone individuals, immune cells including macrophages migrate to pancreatic islets and secrete proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that result in β-cell death (11.Padgett L.E. Broniowska K.A. Hansen P.A. Corbett J.A. Tse H.M. The role of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis.Ann. N.Y. Acad.

The chemokine system in diverse forms of macrophage activation and polarization.Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 677-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar), which are classically activated (e.g. by interferon-γ (IFNγ), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TNFα), and M2 macrophages, which are alternatively activated (e.g. by IL-4 or IL-10) (13.Martinez F.O. Gordon S. The M1 and M2 paradigm of macrophage activation: time for reassessment.F1000Prime Rep. 2014; 6: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (2882) Google Scholar). Whereas M1 macrophages are recognized causative factors in T1D development (14.Calderon B. Suri A. Unanue E.R.

Recent studies suggest that ROS can modulate macrophage polarization and that reduction in ROS generation promotes an M2 macrophage phenotype, blunts M1 macrophage phenotype, and dramatically delays T1D onset (16.Padgett L.E. Burg A.R. Lei W. Tse H.M. Loss of NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide skews macrophage phenotypes to delay type 1 diabetes.Diabetes. 2015; 64: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Lipid signaling is increasingly recognized to modulate inflammation and immune responses (17.Gilroy D.W. Newson J. Sawmynaden P. Willoughby D.A. Croxtall J.D. A novel role for phospholipase A2 isoforms in the checkpoint control of acute inflammation.FASEB J. 2004; 18: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).

The PLA2s hydrolyze the sn-2 substituent from membrane phospholipids to generate a free fatty acid and a 2-lysophospholipid. The fatty acid arachidonic acid can be further metabolized by cyclooxygenases (COXs) and lipoxygenases (LOs) to generate bioactive eicosanoids that include prostaglandins and leukotrienes (19.Khanapure S.P.

We have examined this using iPLA2β−/− and wild type (WT) mouse peritoneal macrophages and report here that iPLA2β deficiency reduces macrophage expression of eicosanoid and ROS-generating enzymes and favors M2 over M1 macrophage phenotypic polarization. These findings suggest that genetic or pharmacologic reduction of iPLA2β activity could reduce inflammation and delay disease progression by shifting macrophage polarization away from proinflammatory and toward an alternatively activated phenotype, thereby reducing proinflammatory lipid and ROS signal generation. PLA2s are ubiquitously expressed and activated in inflammatory settings (17.Gilroy D.W. Newson J. Sawmynaden P. Willoughby D.A. Croxtall J.D.

Analogously, mRNA species encoding iPLA2β (Fig. 1B), iPLA2γ (Fig. 1C), and cPLA2 (Fig. 1D) are evident in already differentiated WT naïve peritoneal macrophages. As expected, macrophages from iPLA2β−/− mice did not express iPLA2β mRNA (Fig. 1B), but their expression of iPLA2γ (Fig. 1C) and cPLA2 (Fig. 1D) mRNA was similar to WT. Neither classical nor alternative activation with IFNγ + LPS and IL-4, respectively, increased expression of iPLA2β mRNA in WT macrophages (Fig. 1B), and iPLA2γ expression with activation was similar between the two genotypes (Fig. 1C). In contrast, cPLA2 expression was increased under both classical and alternative activation, but its induction was similar between WT and iPLA2β−/− macrophages (Fig. 1D). To examine the impact of iPLA2β on polarization of macrophages toward the M1 phenotype, macrophages were treated with IFNγ + LPS, total RNA was isolated, and cDNA was prepared for real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses of various recognized markers of M1 macrophage phenotype. These included Arg2, CCL5, CD68, CXCL10, iNOS, STAT1, and TNFα. Of these, only Arg2 was significantly different between the two genotypes (Fig. 2A) under naïve conditions. After classical activation, CCL5, CD68, CXCL10, STAT1, and TNFα did not differ significantly between the two genotypes (data not shown). However, robust increases in Arg2 (Fig. 2B), iNOS (Fig. 2C), and TNFα (Fig. 2D) in WT peritoneal macrophages were evident. In contrast, induction of all three was blunted in the iPLA2β−/− group. Although Arg1 is recognized as an M2 macrophage marker, there is controversy regarding whether Arg2 is pro- or anti-inflammatory (39.Khallou-Laschet J. Varthaman A. Fornasa G. Compain C. Gaston A.T.

Arginase II promotes macrophage inflammatory responses through mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, contributing to insulin resistance and atherogenesis.J. Am.

In contrast, Arg2 was induced by classical, but not alternative activation. These observations led us to suggest that Arg2 is associated with an M1 macrophage phenotype in our study model. Collectively, these findings suggest that iPLA2β deficiency mitigates polarization of macrophages toward an M1 phenotype. Next, we examined whether iPLA2β expression influenced polarization of macrophages toward the M2 phenotype. Macrophages were treated with IL-4 and processed for RT-qPCR analyses of various M2-related markers. These included Arg1, CCL2, RELA, STAT6, CHIL3, NF-κB1, MRC1, and RETNLA. Under naïve conditions, NF-κB1, MRC1, and RETNLA were unchanged, and CHIL3 decreased in the iPLA2β−/− group relative to WT group (Fig. 4A). However, Arg1, CCL2, RELA, and STAT6 were significantly higher in the iPLA2β−/− group relative to the WT group. Furthermore, under M2 polarizing conditions induction of MRC1, NF-κB1, RELA, and STAT6 was significantly higher in the iPLA2β−/− group, relative to WT group (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that the M2 phenotype is predominant with iPLA2β−/− macrophages. Induction of lipid-metabolizing enzymes and the corresponding accumulations of eicosanoids have been reported at the onset of insulitis and initial stages of diabetes (42.Grzesik W.J. Nadler J.L.

Consistent with this, we find that both ALOX-12 (Fig. 5A) and PTGS2 (Fig. 5B), which metabolize arachidonic acid to generate various oxidized lipids, are induced by classical but not alternative activation in the WT macrophages. We, therefore, compared expression of ALOX12 (12-LO) and PTGS2 (COX2) in macrophages from WT and iPLA2β−/− mice. Under naïve conditions there was no statistical difference in ALOX12 mRNA, but PTGS2 mRNA was significantly higher in the iPLA2β−/− group (Fig. 6A). However, under classical activation conditions, there were dramatic increases in both ALOX12, and PTGS2 mRNA in the WT group (Fig. 6, B and C). In comparison, induction of both was markedly blunted in the iPLA2β−/− group. These findings suggest that downstream generators of proinflammatory lipid signals are subject to modulation by iPLA2β expression.FIGURE 6.ALOX12 (12-LO) and PTGS2 (COX2) in naïve and activated WT and iPLA2β−/− peritoneal macrophages.

To address this, macrophages from WT mice were classically activated in the absence and presence of inhibitors of iPLA2β ((S)-bromoenol lactone (S-BEL)), COX (indomethacin), or 12-LO (cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-α-cyanocinnamate (CDC)), and select M1 markers were assessed. As expected, in the presence of IFNγ + LPS, both Arg2 (Fig. 7A) and iNOS (Fig. 7B) mRNA were dramatically increased, and such increases were significantly inhibited by all three inhibitors. At the protein level, media accumulation of TNFα (Fig. 8A) and IL-1β (Fig. 8B) were increased by activation. Although S-BEL and indomethacin inhibited TNFα production by the macrophages, CDC had no effect (Fig. 8A). IL-1β accumulation was modestly decreased by S-BEL and CDC (∼25%, p = 0.1) but was significantly inhibited by indomethacin (Fig. 8B). In contrast, IL-12, which was also increased by activation, was not affected by any of the inhibitors (data not shown). Furthermore, media accumulation of nitrite, a spontaneous oxidized product of iNOS-generated nitric oxide, which was markedly increased by activation in WT peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 8C), was inhibited by both S-BEL and indomethacin. Consistently, supplementation of the media during activation of macrophages from iPLA2β−/− mice with PGE2, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), or LPA, but not arachidonic acid, significantly elevated nitrite levels in the media (Fig. 8D). In agreement with these observations, endogenous LPA content is lower in macrophages from iPLA2β−/− mice compared with WT (Fig. 8, E and F). These findings suggest that some, but not all, M1 markers are impacted by iPLA2β activation and subsequent generation of COX-derived lipid species.FIGURE 8.Modulation of M1-related factors by inhibitors of lipid-metabolizing enzymes and evidence for involvement of PGE2 in peritoneal macrophages.

https://openalex.org/W2523077991,"Archaeological sites in northern Africa provide a rich record of increasing importance for the origins of modern human behaviour and for understanding human dispersal out of Africa. However, the timing and nature of Palaeolithic human behaviour and dispersal across north-western Africa (the Maghreb), and their relationship to local environmental conditions, remain poorly understood. The cave of Rhafas (northeast Morocco) provides valuable chronological information about cultural changes in the Maghreb during the Palaeolithic due to its long stratified archaeological sequence comprising Middle Stone Age (MSA), Later Stone Age (LSA) and Neolithic occupation layers. In this study, we apply optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating on sand-sized quartz grains to the cave deposits of Rhafas, as well as to a recently excavated section on the terrace in front of the cave entrance. We hereby provide a revised chronostratigraphy for the archaeological sequence at the site. We combine these results with geological and sedimentological multi-proxy investigations to gain insights into site formation processes and the palaeoenvironmental record of the region. The older sedimentological units at Rhafas were deposited between 135 ka and 57 ka (MIS 6 -MIS 3) and are associated with the MSA technocomplex. Tanged pieces start to occur in the archaeological layers around 109 ka, which is consistent with previously published chronological data from the Maghreb. A well indurated duricrust indicates favourable climatic conditions for the pedogenic cementation by carbonates of sediment layers at the site after 57 ka. Overlying deposits attributed to the LSA technocomplex yield ages of ~21 ka and ~15 ka, corresponding to the last glacial period, and fall well within the previously established occupation phase in the Maghreb. The last occupation phase at Rhafas took place during the Neolithic and is dated to ~7.8 ka."

https://openalex.org/W2522725181,"Activation of the blood vessel endothelium is a critical step during inflammation. Endothelial cells stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines play an essential part in the adhesion and extravasation of circulating leukocytes into inflamed tissues. The endothelial egfl7 gene (VE-statin) represses endothelial cell activation in tumors, and prior observations suggested that it could also participate in the regulation of endothelial cell activation during inflammation. We show here that Egfl7 expression is strongly repressed in mouse lung endothelial cells during LPS- and TNFα-induced inflammation in vivo. LPS have a limited effect on Egfl7 expression by endothelial cells in vitro, whereas the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα strongly represses Egfl7 expression in endothelial cells. TNFα regulates the egfl7 gene promoter through regions located between −7585 and −5550 bp ahead of the main transcription start site and via an NF-κB-dependent mechanism. Conversely, Egfl7 regulates the response of endothelial cells to TNFα by restraining the induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin, resulting in a decreased adhesion of leukocytes onto endothelial cells stimulated by TNFα. Egfl7 regulates the expression of these adhesion molecules through the NF-κB and MEK/Erk pathways, in particular by preventing the proteasome-mediated degradation of IkBα both in non-activated endothelial cells and during activation. Egfl7 is thus an endogenous and constitutive repressor of blood vessel endothelial cell activation in normal and inflammatory conditions and participates in a loop of regulation of activation of these cells by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Activation of the blood vessel endothelium is a critical step during inflammation.

Egfl7 is thus an endogenous and constitutive repressor of blood vessel endothelial cell activation in normal and inflammatory conditions and participates in a loop of regulation of activation of these cells by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Endothelial cells line the luminal side of blood vessels in direct contact with the circulation. Under normal conditions, the endothelium forms a non-adhesive and non-thrombogenic surface on which blood cells slide with minimal interactions with the vascular wall. During inflammation, endothelial cells become activated in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, which promote a strong increase in the expression levels of leukocyte adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), 4The abbreviations used are: ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell(s); siCtrl, control siRNA; siEgfl7, siRNA targeting Egfl7; IKK, IκB kinase; qPCR, quantitative PCR. and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). These adhesion molecules are expressed at the endothelial cell surface and participate in the rolling, arrest, firm adhesion, and extravasation of immune cells from the circulation through the endothelium and toward the tissues (1.Muller W.A. Mechanisms of transendothelial migration of leukocytes.Circ. Res. 2009; 105: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Endothelial cell activation in response to inflammation and its subsequent capture of leukocytes is thus a vital response, and its regulation is critical. Excessive or aberrant local activation of endothelial cells leads to inflammatory disorders such as atherosclerosis, chronic inflammation, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Activation of the endothelium is transitory, and endothelial cells resume a basal, non-activated condition when pro-inflammatory cytokines levels recess. Thus, most of the time, the endothelium is non-activated, and there are now several lines of evidence suggesting that this condition depends on the active expression of endogenous genes, which, when repressed, spontaneously trigger endothelial cell activation. Epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (egfl7 or VE-statin) is mainly expressed by endothelial cells during embryonic development and in the adult. Egfl7 codes for a secreted protein that represses smooth muscle cell migration, regulates elastogenesis (2.Soncin F. Mattot V. Lionneton F. Spruyt N. Lepretre F. Begue A. Stehelin D.

These observations were made in situations where the endothelium was severely altered (cancer) or chemically injured and suggested that Egfl7 could possibly regulate the endothelial activation during inflammation, but the exact roles of Egfl7 in this process have not been studied. Furthermore, there is currently no report on the regulation of Egfl7 expression during endothelial cell activation in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. Here, we show that Egfl7 participates in the regulation of endothelial cell activation during inflammation. Egfl7 expression is transitorily reduced under LPS- and TNFα-induced inflammatory conditions in vivo and in endothelial cells treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. TNFα represses egfl7 gene transcription in endothelial cells via the NF-κB pathway. Conversely, Egfl7 represses the TNFα-induced activation of endothelial cells and adhesion of leukocytes, notably by limiting the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin through the repression of the NF-κB and the MEK/Erk pathways. Egfl7 participates in the stabilization of IκBα and inhibits its degradation by the proteasome.

Stuhlmann H. Egfl7, a novel epidermal growth factor-domain gene expressed in endothelial cells.Dev Dyn. 2004; 230: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Comparing in situ hybridization of Egfl7 and immunostaining of CD31 in parallel slides of normal mouse lungs, Egfl7 expression was observed mostly in CD31+ endothelial cells (Fig. 1A). When lungs were dissociated and cells purified by immunoaffinity against cell surface CD31, expression of Egfl7 was detected mostly in the CD31+ enriched fraction (Fig. 1B), confirming that in normal lungs, CD31+ endothelial cells represent the main cell type that expresses Egfl7. To check whether Egfl7 expression was regulated during inflammation, LPS were instilled in mouse lungs as to produce an acute and transitory inflammatory condition. The efficacy of this LPS treatment in inducing lung endothelium activation was confirmed by the observed 3.5- and 2-fold up-regulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 RNA expression levels after 10 h of LPS treatment, respectively (Fig. 1C). The expression levels of E-selectin were up-regulated 250-fold after 10h of stimulation by LPS. All levels were back to almost basal values after 24 h. During this LPS treatment, Egfl7 transcript levels decreased 75% after 10 h when compared with PBS controls and resumed values close to controls after 24 h (Fig. 1C), thus showing a simultaneous and inverse regulation of expression of Egfl7 when compared with leukocyte adhesion molecules. To check whether the down-regulation of Egfl7 could be due to a direct effect of LPS on endothelial cells, primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cultured in vitro were treated with increasing amounts of LPS and expression of Egfl7 assessed. The most active dose of LPS (0.1 μg/ml for 4 h) induced a 20% decrease in Egfl7 transcript levels (Fig. 1D), and a time course treatment of HUVEC with that same dose showed a maximal 20% reduction in expression of Egfl7 after 4 and 8 h (Fig. 1D). This indicated that in lung tissues inflamed using LPS, the much stronger repression of Egfl7 observed was probably not due to a direct effect of the LPS on endothelial cells. Because an LPS treatment in vivo induces the release of TNFα and pro-inflammatory interleukins in tissues (12.Togbe D. Schnyder-Candrian S. Schnyder B. Doz E. Noulin N. Janot L. Secher T. Gasse P. Lima C. Coelho F.R. Vasseur V. Erard F. Ryffel B. Couillin I. Moser R. Toll-like receptor and tumour necrosis factor dependent endotoxin-induced acute lung injury.Int. J. Exp.

Sci. 2008; 1123: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), we then checked whether TNFα could regulate the expression of Egfl7 in vivo. Instillation of TNFα in mice induced a strong increase in ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin expression levels after 10 h, confirming activation of the lung endothelium (Fig. 1E). Under these conditions, TNFα induced a 50% decrease in Egfl7 expression after 10 h and 69% after 24 h when compared with PBS controls at the same time points (Fig. 1E). In vitro, a time course treatment of endothelial cells with TNFα showed a 60% decrease of the levels of Egfl7 transcripts after 6 h of stimulation; these levels were back to control values after 24 h (Fig. 2A). Treating endothelial cells with the other pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1β resulted in a similar but prolonged response while treating with IL6 had no significant effects on Egfl7 expression when compared with controls (Fig. 2B). Accordingly, upon TNFα treatment, Egfl7 protein levels in endothelial cells decreased at 8 h and thereafter when compared with non-stimulated cells (Fig. 2C), and this decrease in expression was also detected by immunofluorescence of Egfl7 in endothelial cells treated with TNFα (Fig. 2D). Because TNFα and IL1β are active angiogenic factors in vivo (14.Fràter-Schröder M. Risau W. Hallmann R. Gautschi P. Böhlen P. Tumor necrosis factor type α, a potent inhibitor of endothelial cell growth in vitro, is angiogenic in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Ophthalmol. 1990; 108: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we tested whether Egfl7 could be regulated by other angiogenic factors such as FGF-2 and VEGF-A165, but neither factor induced significant variations in the expression levels of Egfl7, at any of the concentration tested (Fig. 2E). Egfl7 repression by TNFα was not due to a shorter half-life of its mRNA because the kinetics of decay of the Egfl7 transcripts were similar in HUVEC treated or not with TNFα prior to blocking transcription (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, the decrease in Egfl7 transcript levels induced by TNFα depended on active transcription because it was abolished by treating the cells with actinomycin D before TNFα stimulation (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained when treating endothelial cells with IL1β (not shown). These observations suggested that the egfl7 gene promoter was regulated when treating endothelial cells with TNFα. To address this point, several successive deletion reporter vectors based on the location of conserved regions between the mouse and human egfl7 gene promoters (16.Le Bras A. Samson C. Trentini M. Caetano B. Lelievre E. Mattot V. Beermann F. Soncin F. VE-statin/egfl7 expression in endothelial cells is regulated by a distal enhancer and a proximal promoter under the direct control of Erg and GATA-2.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e12156Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were cloned and transfected in HUVEC, and cells were then stimulated or not with TNFα. The −9008/+50 and −7585/+50 promoter regions were highly active in endothelial cells (Fig. 3C), and treating with TNFα reduced the activity of these fragments by 58 and 46%, respectively. Deletion of the fragment encompassing region B resulted in a loss of sensitivity of the constructs to TNFα: the −5550/+50Luc reporter showed an almost complete lack of sensitivity to TNFα (6% difference versus non-treated) together with a large decrease in global reporter activity when compared with the longer constructs. Further deletions showed no significant differences of activity upon treatment with TNFα either, as seen in shorter mutants (Fig. 3C), which nevertheless maintained a detectable luciferase activity, like in the mouse egfl7 promoter (16.Le Bras A. Samson C. Trentini M. Caetano B. Lelievre E. Mattot V. Beermann F. Soncin F. VE-statin/egfl7 expression in endothelial cells is regulated by a distal enhancer and a proximal promoter under the direct control of Erg and GATA-2.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e12156Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). TNFα and IL1, which repress Egfl7, are known potent inducers of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway in HUVEC (17.Montgomery K.F. Osborn L. Hession C. Tizard R. Goff D. Vassallo C. Tarr P.I. Bomsztyk K. Lobb R. Harlan J.M. Activation of endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 (ELAM-1) gene transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

On the other hand, IL6, which does not the activate the NF-κB pathway in endothelial cells in vitro, including in HUVEC (17.Montgomery K.F. Osborn L. Hession C. Tizard R. Goff D. Vassallo C.

Rheumatol. 2011; 2011: 721608Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), has no effects on Egfl7 expression. We thus suspected that the NF-κB pathway could be involved in the regulation of egfl7 gene expression by TNFα in these cells. Indeed, treating HUVEC with the NF-κB inhibitor BAY117085 prevented the repression of egfl7 induced by TNFα (Fig. 4A), and transfecting cells with the constitutively active NF-κB super-repressor Iκ-Bα S32/36A (21.Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. Phosphorylation of human IκB-α on serines 32 and 36 controls IκB-α proteolysis and NF-κB activation in response to diverse stimuli.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) relieved the repression of the −7585/+50Luc construct induced by TNFα (Fig. 4B). Altogether, the results above show that Egfl7 expression is down-regulated under inflammatory conditions in vivo and in vitro by a direct regulation of its gene in endothelial cells. We had previously observed that repressing Egfl7 could activate endothelial cells in the absence of inflammatory cytokines (7.Delfortrie S. Pinte S. Mattot V. Samson C. Villain G. Caetano B. Lauridant-Philippin G. Baranzelli M.-C. Bonneterre J. Trottein F. Faveeuw C. Soncin F. Egfl7 promotes tumor escape from immunity by repressing endothelial cell activation.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 7176-7186Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In such conditions, repressing Egfl7 increased the expression levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin transcripts and the number of T-lymphocytes spontaneously adhering onto endothelial cells. This added to the present observations suggested that the proper activation of endothelial cells during inflammation may require the simultaneous repression of Egfl7 in these cells. To address this point, we set up RNA interference conditions using two different siRNA which specifically down-regulated Egfl7 expression without affecting that of miR126-3p and miR126-5p (Fig. 5A). This point was particularly important because miR126-3p and miR126-5p are embedded within the egfl7 gene seventh intron, and both are known to affect endothelial cell activation (22.Wang S. Aurora A.B. Johnson B.A. Qi X. McAnally J. Hill J.A. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. The endothelial-specific microRNA miR-126 governs vascular integrity and angiogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 261-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar, 23.Poissonnier L. Villain G. Soncin F. Mattot V. miR126-5p repression of ALCAM and SetD5 in endothelial cells regulates leucocyte adhesion and transmigration.Cardiovasc. Res. 2014; 102: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The effects of siEgfl7 in HUVEC could be rescued by overexpressing Egfl7 by the means of an expression plasmid. This plasmid induced an ∼6-fold overexpression of Egfl7 over the endogenous Egfl7 transcript and abolished the effects of siEgfl7 (Fig. 5B). Importantly, overexpression of Egfl7 in these conditions did not affect the expression levels of miR126-3p nor those of miR126-5p (Fig. 5B). Repression of Egfl7 in endothelial cells by RNA interference followed by TNFα stimulation resulted in a strongly exacerbated activation of the cells: expression levels of ICAM-1 doubled on average at each time point in TNFα-stimulated conditions when compared with control, reaching the highest values after 6 h (Fig. 6A). VCAM-1 expression levels increased 50% over control after 6 h of stimulation when Egfl7 was repressed (Fig. 6A). After 2 h, the levels of expression of E-selectin were not significantly higher than controls when Egfl7 was repressed. However, the peak of expression of E-selectin lasted longer, reaching its maximal values after 6 h in the siEgfl7 condition when expression levels had already dropped by half in the siCtrl condition. To confirm the specific role of Egfl7 in these observations, expression of Egfl7 was rescued using pEgfl7 in HUVEC treated with TNFα for 6 h. Of note, the Egfl7 rescue was as effective in PBS-treated HUVEC as in TNFα-treated HUVEC, thus allowing comparison of the conditions (Fig. 6B). In the pEgfl7-rescued conditions, the expression levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin dropped back almost to siCtrl values in all cases (Fig. 6B), therefore confirming that the effects obtained with siEgfl7 were indeed due to the repression of Egfl7 itself. In good correlation with these results, overexpression of Egfl7 using pEgfl7 also cancelled the stimulating effect of TNFα on the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelial cells monolayer (Fig. 6C), altogether showing that Egfl7 is actually an efficient endogenous repressor of endothelial activation that can counteract the endothelial cell biological response to inflammatory cytokines. Pro-inflammatory cytokines promote the expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells mainly through the activation of the NF-κB pathway (18.Rao R.M. Yang L. Garcia-Cardena G. Luscinskas F.W. Endothelial-dependent mechanisms of leukocyte recruitment to the vascular wall.Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 234-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Treating HUVEC with TNFα in our conditions increased the expression levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin and this effect was abolished in the presence of the inhibitor of NF-κB activation BAY117085 (24.Pierce J.W. Schoenleber R. Jesmok G. Best J. Moore S.A. Collins T. Gerritsen M.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21096-21103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar) (not shown). Because Egfl7 was previously shown to repress NF-κB nuclear translocation in response to hypoxia/reoxygenation and NF-κB DNA binding in response to calcineurin treatment (9.Badiwala M.V. Tumiati L.C. Joseph J.M. Sheshgiri R. Ross H.J. Delgado D.H. Rao V. Epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 suppresses intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression in response to hypoxia/reoxygenation injury in human coronary artery endothelial cells.Circulation. 2010; 122: S156-S161Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10.Badiwala M.V.

Epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 is a novel inhibitor of neutrophil adhesion to coronary artery endothelial cells injured by calcineurin inhibition.Circulation. 2011; 124: S197-S203Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we then assessed whether Egfl7 would also repress endothelial activation through this signaling pathway. Treating endothelial cells with the NF-κB inhibitor BAY117085 suppressed the increase in T-cell adhesion onto endothelial cells transfected with siEgfl7 (Fig. 7A). Treatment with the inhibitor also cancelled the stimulating effects of siEgfl7 on VCAM-1 and E-selectin expression but not on ICAM-1 expression (Fig. 7B). The MAPK/Erk pathway is also known to regulate endothelial cell activation (25.Kuldo J.M. Westra J. Asgeirsdóttir S.A. Kok R.J. Oosterhuis K. Rots M.G. Schouten J.P. Limburg P.C. Molema G. Differential effects of NF-κB and p38 MAPK inhibitors and combinations thereof on TNF-α- and IL-1β-induced proinflammatory status of endothelial cells in vitro.Am. J. Physiol.

Connell M.C. MacEwan D.J. TNFR1-induced NF-κB, but not ERK, p38MAPK or JNK activation, mediates TNF-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression on endothelial cells.Cell Signal. 2007; 19: 1238-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Treating HUVEC with the MEK/Erk inhibitor U0126 increased T-cell adhesion onto endothelial cells and cancelled the promoting effects of siEgfl7 on leukocyte adhesion (Fig. 7C). This treatment cancelled the effects of the siEgfl7 on expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin (Fig. 7D), thus showing that in endothelial cells, Egfl7 constitutively represses ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin through the MEK/Erk pathway. To more precisely identify the mechanisms by which Egfl7 regulates the NF-κB pathway during inflammation, we then performed a detailed analysis of activation of this pathway during TNFα stimulation of endothelial cells. Briefly, in non-stimulated cells, dimers of NF-κB/Rel transcription factors are complexed with the inhibitory IκB protein as inactive factors in the cytosol. Upon TNFα stimulation, phosphorylation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which contains the IKKα and IKKβ catalytic subunits, activates this IKK complex, which in turn phosphorylates IκBα on Ser32 and Ser36. This signal promotes the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome-dependent degradation of IκBα. NF-κB dimers are thus released and translocate into the nucleus. During this process, NF-κB p65 phosphorylation at Ser536 promotes nuclear localization and transcriptional activity (28.Kanarek N. Ben-Neriah Y. Regulation of NF-κB by ubiquitination and degradation of the IκBs.Immunol. Rev. 2012; 246: 77-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). When Egfl7 was down-regulated using siEgfl7 and endothelial cells treated with TNFα, the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 on Ser536, taken as an indicator of NF-κB activation, was detected earlier (5min) and lasted longer (up to 2 h) than in cells transfected with siCtrl (Fig. 8A). Quantification of the signals showed that the phosphorylation levels of NFκB p65 on Ser536 were higher at almost every time point in cells transfected with siEgfl7 than with siCtrl, including without stimulation (time 0; Fig. 8B). This confirmed that Egfl7 repressed the NF-κB pathway both in normal conditions and during activation of endothelial cells. The hyperactivation of the NF-κB pathway mediated by Egfl7 repression was not due to a difference in activation of the IKK complex because total and phosphorylation levels of IKKα and IKKβ were not noticeably different between cells treated with siCtrl and siEgfl7 (Fig. 9). Regarding IκBα phosphorylation, the kinetics under TNFα treatment were slightly different as phosphorylation was detected sooner (5 min) in siEgfl7 condition than siCtrl (Fig. 10A, P-IκBα (Ser32)). The most remarkable effect observed was a large reduction in total IκBα protein levels in cells where Egfl7 expression had been repressed, both without treatment (time 0) and during early TNFα treatment (Fig. 10A, Total IκBα). The repression of Egfl7 also cancelled the neo-synthesis of IκBα observed after 2–4 h of treatment with TNFα in the siCtrl condition. The effects of Egfl7 on IκBα protein levels were not due to variations in the expression levels of"

A cross-sectional study was conducted of 496 aged 26-81 years with (n = 362) and without (n = 134) CAD. Plasma DPP4 activity, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein levels were measured. The coronary atherosclerotic plaques were evaluated by coronary angiography. The CAD patients with (n = 84) and without (n = 278) DM had significantly higher DPP4 levels (11.8 ± 3.1 vs. 6.9 ± 3.5 ng/mL, P<0.01) than the nonCAD subjects. The acute coronary syndrome patients (n = 299) had elevated DPP4 levels than those with stable angina patients (n = 83). CAD patients even without DM had increased plasma DPP4 activities as compared with nonCAD subjects (10.9 ± 4.9 vs. 6.4 ± 3.1, ng/L, P< 0.01). A linear regression analysis revealed that overall, the DPP4 levels were positively associated with LCL-C and hs-CRP levels as well as syntax scores. A multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that plasma DPP4 activity was independent predictor of CAD (odds ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.19-1.73; P<0.01). Our study shows that increased DPP4 activity levels are associated with the presence of CAD and that the plasma DPP4 level serves as a novel biomarker for CAD even without DM."

https://openalex.org/W2522457189,"Axial disorders are considered to appear late in the course of Parkinson's disease (PD). The associated impact on quality of life (QoL) and survival and the lack of an effective treatment mean that understanding and treating axial disorders is a key challenge. However, upper-body axial disorders (namely dysarthria, swallowing and breathing disorders) have never been prospectively assessed in early-stage PD patients.To characterize upper-body axial symptoms and QoL in consecutive patients with early-stage PD.We prospectively enrolled 66 consecutive patients with early-stage PD (less than 3 years of disease progression) and assessed dysarthria, dysphagia and respiratory function (relative to 36 controls) using both objective and patient-reported outcomes.The mean disease duration was 1.26 years and the mean UPDRS motor score was 19.4 out of 108. 74% of the patients presented slight dysarthria (primarily dysprosodia). Men appeared to be more severely affected (i.e. dysphonia). This dysfunction was strongly correlated with low swallowing speed (despite the absence of complaints about dysphagia), respiratory insufficiency and poor QoL. Videofluorography showed that oral-phase swallowing disorders affected 60% of the 31 tested patients and that pharyngeal-phase disorders affected 21%. 24% of the patients reported occasional dyspnea, which was correlated with anxiety in women but not in men. Marked diaphragmatic dysfunction was suspected in 42% of the patients (predominantly in men).Upper body axial symptoms were frequent in men with early-stage PD, whereas women presented worst non-motor impairments. New assessment methods are required because currently available tools do not reliably detect these upper-body axial disorders."

Heat shock protein HSPX when attached to the N-termini of the antigens PE35, tnPstS1 and FbpC1, all the fusion molecules were expressed at high levels in E. coli in a soluble form. ELISA analysis of the plasma samples of TB patients against HSPX-tnPstS1 showed 57.7% sensitivity which is nearly the same as the expected combined value obtained after deducting the number of plasma samples (32) containing the antibodies against both the individual antigens. Likewise, the 54.4% sensitivity of HSPX-PE35 was nearly the same as that expected from the combined values of the contributing antigens. Structural analysis of all the fusion molecules by CD spectroscopy showed that α-helical and β-sheet contents were found close to those obtained through molecular modeling. Molecular modeling studies of HSPX-tnPstS1 and HSPX-PE35 support the analytical results as most of the epitopes of the contributing antigens were found to be available for binding to the corresponding antibodies. Using these fusion molecules in combination with other antigenic molecules should reduce the number of antigenic proteins required for a more reliable and economical serodiagnosis of tuberculosis. Also, HSPX seems to have potential application in soluble expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli."

https://openalex.org/W2522168773,"It has long been a quest in ruminants to understand how two very similar mycobacterial species, Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) and Mycobacterium avium ssp. avium (MAA) lead to either a chronic persistent infection or a rapid-transient infection, respectively. Here, we hypothesized that when the host immune response is activated by MAP or MAA, the outcome of the infection depends on the early activation of signaling molecules and host temporal gene expression. To test our hypothesis, ligated jejuno-ileal loops including Peyer’s patches in neonatal calves were inoculated with PBS, MAP, or MAA. A temporal analysis of the host transcriptome profile was conducted at several times post-infection (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours). When comparing the transcriptional responses of calves infected with the MAA versus MAP, discordant patterns of mucosal expression were clearly evident, and the numbers of unique transcripts altered were moderately less for MAA-infected tissue than were mucosal tissues infected with the MAP. To interpret these complex data, changes in the gene expression were further analyzed by dynamic Bayesian analysis. Bayesian network modeling identified mechanistic genes, gene-to-gene relationships, pathways and Gene Ontologies (GO) biological processes that are involved in specific cell activation during infection. MAP and MAA had significant different pathway perturbation at 0.5 and 12 hours post inoculation. Inverse processes were observed between MAP and MAA response for epithelial cell proliferation, negative regulation of chemotaxis, cell-cell adhesion mediated by integrin and regulation of cytokine-mediated signaling. MAP inoculated tissue had significantly lower expression of phagocytosis receptors such as mannose receptor and complement receptors. This study reveals that perturbation of genes and cellular pathways during MAP infection resulted in host evasion by mucosal membrane barrier weakening to access entry in the ileum, inhibition of Ca signaling associated with decreased phagosome-lysosome fusion as well as phagocytosis inhibition, bias toward Th2 cell immune response accompanied by cell recruitment, cell proliferation and cell differentiation; leading to persistent infection. Contrarily, MAA infection was related to cellular responses associated with activation of molecular pathways that release chemicals and cytokines involved with containment of infection and a strong bias toward Th1 immune response, resulting in a transient infection."

Both men and women aged <35 years (aHR = 31.2, 95% CI = 21.6-45.2), 35-65 years; (aHR = 6.19, 95% CI = 5.09-7.54) and ≥65 years (aHR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.92-2.87) had a higher risk of incident respiratory failure in the SLE cohort. Moreover, the risk of incident respiratory failure was higher in the SLE cohort than the non-SLE cohort, for subjects with (aHR = 2.65, 95% CI = 2.22-3.15) or without (aHR = 9.08, 95% CI = 7.72-10.7) pre-existing comorbidities. In the SLE cohort, subjects with >24 outpatient visits and hospitalizations per year had a higher incident respiratory failure risk (aHR = 21.7, 95% CI = 18.0-26.1) compared with the non-SLE cohort.Patients with SLE are associated with an increased risk of incident respiratory failure, regardless of their age, sex, and pre-existing comorbidities; especially medical services with higher frequency."
https://openalex.org/W2522031616,"In Réunion Island, despite an influenza surveillance established since 1996 by the sentinel general practitioner’s network, little is known about the etiology of Influenza like-illness (ILI) that differs from influenza viruses in a tropical area. We set up a retrospective study using nasal swabs collected by sentinel GPs from ILI patients in 2011 and 2012. A total of 250 swabs were randomly selected and analyzed by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) including research of 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. We detected respiratory viruses in 169/222 (76.1%) samples, mostly rhinovirus (23.4%), influenza A virus (21.2%), influenza B virus (12.6%), coronavirus (4.9%) and Human metapneumovirus (3.6%). Nine swabs (5.3% of positive swabs) revealed co-infections with two viruses identified, among which six concerned co-infections with influenza viruses. We observed important seasonal differences, with circulation of Human Metapneumoviruses, RSV A and B and coronavirus only during summer; whereas parainfluenza viruses were identified only during winter. In conclusion, this study highlights a substantial circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens in Réunion Island throughout the year. It shows that ILI are not only attributable to influenza and underlines the need for biological surveillance. As the use of multiplex RT-PCR showed its efficacy, it is now used routinely in the surveillance of ILI."

https://openalex.org/W2523151011,"Mental imagery occurs ""when a representation of the type created during the initial phases of perception is present but the stimulus is not actually being perceived."" How does the capability to perform mental imagery arise? Extending the idea that imagery arises from learned associations, we propose that mental rotation, a specific form of imagery, could arise through the mechanism of sequence learning-that is, by learning to regenerate the sequence of mental images perceived while passively observing a rotating object. To demonstrate the feasibility of this proposal, we constructed a simulated nervous system and embedded it within a behaving humanoid robot. By observing a rotating object, the system learns the sequence of neural activity patterns generated by the visual system in response to the object. After learning, it can internally regenerate a similar sequence of neural activations upon briefly viewing the static object. This system learns to perform a mental rotation task in which the subject must determine whether two objects are identical despite differences in orientation. As with human subjects, the time taken to respond is proportional to the angular difference between the two stimuli. Moreover, as reported in humans, the system fills in intermediate angles during the task, and this putative mental rotation activates the same pathways that are activated when the system views physical rotation. This work supports the proposal that mental rotation arises through sequence learning and the idea that mental imagery aids perception through learned associations, and suggests testable predictions for biological experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2522177125,"We assessed the ability of whole genome amplification (WGA) to improve the efficiency of downstream polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) directed at ancient DNA (aDNA) of members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). Using extracts from a variety of bones and a tooth from human skeletons with or without lesions indicative of tuberculosis, from multiple time periods, we obtained inconsistent results. We conclude that WGA does not provide any advantage in studies of MTBC aDNA. The sporadic nature of our results are probably due to the fact that WGA is itself a PCR-based procedure which, although designed to deal with fragmented DNA, might be inefficient with the low concentration of templates in an aDNA extract. As such, WGA is subject to similar, if not the same, restrictions as PCR when applied to aDNA."

https://openalex.org/W2522552710,"The copepod Calanus sinicus Brodsky dominates the zooplankton in the Yellow Sea, China, and undergoes over-summering within the Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass (YSCWM). Termination of over-summering and subsequent development are regarded as key processes in population recruitment, and are probably linked to environmental variations in the YSCWM. In this study, we examined the effects of temperature (9 and 18°C) and food conditions (0.1 μg C mL-1 and unfed) on metabolic rates, morphological characteristics, and relative gene expressions of six genes involved in molting, gonad development, lipid catabolism, and stress tolerance processes of C. sinicus during termination of over-summering and subsequent development. Both elevated temperature and external food supply rapidly ended over-summering of C. sinicus, accompanied by up-regulation of the ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) gene expression and increased metabolic rates. These environmental conditions resulted in irreversible termination of over-summering and ensure the success of molting. During subsequent development, the lipid reserve in oil sacs could permit only early gonad development. The food supply might be a trigger to activate the final maturity of gonad by up-regulating expression of the vitellogenin receptor (VgR) gene. Thus, food played an indispensable role in population recruitment after termination of over-summering, whereas the elevated temperature accelerated these physiological processes. This study revealed the first dynamic profiles of physiological processes involved in over-summering termination and the subsequent development of C. sinicus using morphological, physiological and molecular methods simultaneously, confirmed the quiescent state of over-summering C5 copepodites, detected the effects of environmental changes on over-summering termination and subsequent development, and provided a foundation for future investigations of the mechanisms involved in over-summering in YSCWM."

https://openalex.org/W2522560106,"Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE), a transmembrane, multi-ligand, pattern recognition receptor, has been implicated in a range of inflammatory disease including diabetes, cancers, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [1]. In addition to the full length receptor, soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE) has been shown to prevent the development of numerous pathologic states, and therefore highlights RAGE as an attractive therapeutic target [2–7]. sRAGE lacks the trans-membrane domain and is secreted to the extracellular milieu [6]. RAGE and sRAGE share the entire extracellular portion encompassing the V, C1 and C2 immunoglobulin-like domains (Fig 1). This feature renders sRAGE to function as a decoy that binds ligands and reduces the inflammatory signaling capacity of its membrane-bound counterpart [5, 7]. The importance of sRAGE is underscored by clinical cohort studies showing that serum sRAGE levels are correlated with clinical disease states including CVD, diabetes, cancer and various inflammatory disease states [6, 8]."
