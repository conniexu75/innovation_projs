https://openalex.org/W2048064609,"Adult canaries, Serinus canarius, received injections of 3H-labeled thymidine, a marker of DNA synthesis. Thirty days after the last injection, intracellular potentials were recorded from neurons in the nucleus hyperstriatum ventralis pars caudalis, a vocal control nucleus in the telencephalon; these same cells were then injected with horseradish peroxidase. Of the 74 neurons labeled with horseradish peroxidase that were recovered, the nuclei of seven were radioactively labeled. Four of these seven neurons had responded to auditory stimuli. These double-labeled neurons were apparently generated during or after the 3H-labeled thymidine treatment (during adulthood) and subsequently incorporated into functional neural circuits."

https://openalex.org/W1501821322,"A procedure is described for purification of a factor (D-factor)-inducing differentiation of mouse myeloid leukemic cells (M1) into macrophages from serum-free mouse L929 cell-conditioned medium. The procedure included ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-cellulose, Sephadex G-200 and phenyl-Sepharose column chromatographies, reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a C18 hydrophobic support, and high-performance liquid chromatography on a gel-filtration column. The purified factor gave a single band of protein with a molecular weight of 62,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis which coincided with biological activity. Its half-maximal concentration for inducing differentiation of M1 cells into macrophages was 1.7 X 10(-11) M. Even at 2.6 X 10(-9) M, it did not induce colony formation of normal bone marrow cells, suggesting that it was distinct from the growth factor for normal precursors of macrophages and/or granulocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2022663904,"Several naturally occurring and synthetic flavones were found to inhibit the aromatization of androstenedione and testosterone to estrogens catalyzed by human placental and ovarian microsomes. These flavones include (in order of decreasing potency) 7,8-benzoflavone, chrysin, apigenin, flavone, flavanone, and quercetin; 5,6-benzoflavone was not inhibitory. 7,8-Benzoflavone and chrysin were potent competitive inhibitors and induced spectral changes in the aromatase cytochrome P-450 indicative of substrate displacement. Flavones may thus compete with steroids in their interaction with certain monooxygenases and thereby alter steroid hormone metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2010559614,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important human pathogen responsible for over 200 million cases of chronic infection, many of which progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. Although HBV cannot be propagated in tissue culture, highly effective subunit vaccines obtained from the plasma of chronically infected patients have been developed and licensed1–3. Such vaccines are safe but their expense and limited quantities make them unavailable to most Third World countries. Other approaches to vaccine construction, including purification of the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) from genetically engineered eukaryotic cells4–13 and the synthesis of peptides predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the HBsAg gene14–19, are still under evaluation. Another potential application of recombinant DNA technology to vaccine development is the use of live virus vectors to express foreign genes20–25. An infectious vaccinia virus recombinant that expressed the HBsAg in animal cells and which stimulated the production of antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) in rabbits represented a novel candidate vaccine of this class22,23. As a continuation of our earlier study, we now present evidence that chimpanzees vaccinated with a live recombinant vaccinia virus were protected against hepatitis following challenge with HBV."
https://openalex.org/W2085457798,"Auditory and vestibular nerve fibers of the goldfish are strongly directionally sensitive to whole-body acceleration at audio frequencies. The three-dimensional pattern of sensitivity shows that input from a receptor ensemble (hair cells) is essentially equivalent to that expected from a single hair cell having a given three-dimensional orientation of best sensitivity. Fibers from the sacculus, lagena, and utriculus differ with respect to distributions of directional orientation, but are similar in best threshold (less than 1 nanometer, root mean square, at 140 hertz). In combination with other mechanisms for detection of sound pressure, this directionality is a likely basis for directional hearing in fishes, and it could allow the determination of underwater acoustic intensity."
https://openalex.org/W1998922007,"Plasma-free homovanillic acid, a major metabolite of dopamine, was measured in chronically ill schizophrenic patients both before and during treatment with the antipsychotic phenothiazine, fluphenazine. Neuroleptic treatment was associated with a significant time-dependent decrease in plasma homovanillic acid from pretreatment values, which were significantly elevated when compared with those of age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Further, both the absolute concentrations as well as the neuroleptic-induced reductions in plasma homovanillic acid determined over 5 weeks of neuroleptic treatment were statistically significantly correlated with ratings of psychosis and improvement in psychosis, respectively. These findings suggest that the delayed effects of neuroleptic agents on presynaptic dopamine activity may more closely parallel their therapeutic actions than do their immediate effects in blocking postsynaptic dopamine receptors and that a decrease in dopamine ""turnover"" may be responsible for their antipsychotic effects."

The elicitor-active hexa(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glucitol had the following structure: (Formula: see text) The similarity in structure of six of the elicitor-inactive hexa(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glucitols to the elicitor-active hexa(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glucitol established that a highly defined structure is required for elicitor activity. The elicitor-active hexa(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glucitol is the first example of a complex carbohydrate acting as a regulatory molecule in plants.

A specific complex of glomeruli showed increased carbon-14-labeled 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake in response to peppermint odor in 19-day-old pups exposed to peppermint on days 1 to 18 after birth, relative to control pups that had been exposed to clean air. The increased activity was not due to increased respiration of the familiar odor."
https://openalex.org/W2023875499,"Yohimbine hydrochloride, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, increased sexual motivation in male rats as evidenced by increased mounting performance in mating tests conducted after genital anesthetization, increased percentage of male rats ejaculating in their first heterosexual encounter, and induction of copulatory behavior in sexually inactive male rats. These observations lead to the suggestion that alpha-adrenoceptors are important modulators of sexual arousal in intact male rats. These results indicate that pharmacological treatment of sexual (libido) dysfunction may be useful."
https://openalex.org/W2007308912,"The dwarf little (lit) mouse is a model for the human hereditary disorder, isolated growth hormone (GH) deficiency type I1. In these animals, dwarfism results from an autosomal recessively inherited gene mutation. The GH gene is present2 but production of GH mRNA is deficient3, resulting in reduced serum GH and concomitantly decreased serum somatomedin4–6. Growth retardation is evident by 15 days of age and adult animals reach approximately one-half normal size1. Mutant mice of both sexes also exhibit a delayed onset of puberty, with males having a high degree of infertility1. As administration of GH restores growth7, we reasoned that growth failure in the mutant mice might be corrected by providing them with sufficient GH by gene therapy. Here we demonstrate that although the rat and human GH genes alone do not restore growth in transgenic mutants, a metallothionein–rat growth hormone fusion gene (MT–rGH) does. Moreover, the fertility of transgenic mutant males is improved; however, female fertility is impaired."
https://openalex.org/W1487314012,"We have studied by in vitro translation the mRNA population from rat brown fat in two situations where the thermogenic activity of the tissue is stimulated. Both cold exposure of rats and the presence of pheochromocytoma result in marked alterations among the polypeptides synthesized. Notably, in these two situations there was an increased labeling of polypeptides of the size of the heat-shock proteins and an increased labeling of the 32,000-dalton uncoupling protein of brown fat mitochondria, which is responsible for energy dissipation as heat. Stimulation of the thermogenic activity of brown fat thus results in a high level of mRNA encoding the uncoupling protein. Chronic delivery of norepinephrine mimicked the increase of mRNA for the uncoupling protein observed in animals exposed to cold or bearing pheochromocytoma. Thus, a neuromediator such as norepinephrine is able to trigger the induction of the mRNA encoding the mitochondrial uncoupling protein and is able to stimulate mitochondriogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1537484330,"The hemolymph of adult Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm) contains a 17,000-dalton protein that can associate reversibly with the insect lipoprotein lipophorin. The protein is abundant in the hemolymph of the adult, but is found in larval hemolymph in only small amounts, and does not associate with larval lipophorin. On the basis of its association with adult lipophorin, we have designated the protein apolipophorin III. Apolipophorin III was dissociated from adult lipophorin by guanidinium chloride treatment and isolated by gel permeation and ion exchange chromatography. The unassociated apolipophorin III was also purified from lipophorin-free hemolymph by gel permeation, ion exchange, and lectin chromatography. Both preparations have identical isoelectric points and amino acid composition as well as the following properties. Apolipophorin III is a non-glycosylated polypeptide lacking cysteine and tryptophan. The 17,000-dalton polypeptide dimerizes in solution to a protein of Mr = 34,000."

https://openalex.org/W1495890492,"An intracellular protein accelerates the transfer of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester. The fraction of phospholipid transferred was much less than for the less polar lipids. A rich source of this activity was obtained from low ionic strength washes of liver microsomes. The protein was partially purified by column chromatography on Bio-Gel A-5m and hydroxylapatite. The elution position of the transfer protein on gel filtration corresponds to a protein with a molecular weight of about 200,000. The isoelectric point of the partially purified protein is between pH 5.2 and 5.6. At each step of the purification the stimulation of triglyceride transfer was greater than that of cholesteryl ester."
https://openalex.org/W1502819947,"Under physiological conditions of pH (7.4) and chloride concentration (0.15 M), the oxygen affinity of bovine hemoglobin is substantially lower than that of human hemoglobin. Also, the Bohr effect is much more pronounced in bovine hemoglobin. Numerical simulations indicate that both phenomena can be explained by a larger preferential binding of chloride ions to deoxyhemoglobin in the bovine system. Also, they show that the larger preferential binding may be produced by a decreased affinity of the anions for oxyhemoglobin, thereby stressing the potential relevance of the oxy conformation in regulating the functional properties of the protein. The conformation of the amino-terminal end of the beta subunits appears to regulate the interaction of hemoglobin with solvent components. The pronounced sensitivity of the oxygen affinity of bovine hemoglobin to chloride concentration and to pH suggests that in bovine species these are the modulators of oxygen transport in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2090970884,"In response to low-frequency sounds (less than 1.0 kilohertz) auditory nerve fibers in the treefrog, Eleutherodactylus coqui, discharge at a preferred phase of the stimulus waveform which is a linear function of the stimulus frequency. Moreover, the slopes of the phase-versus-frequency functions (equivalent to the system time delays) systematically increase as the characteristic frequency of the fibers decreases. These neurophysiological observations, coupled with the known tonotopy of the amphibian papilla suggest that a traveling wave occurs in the inner ear of frogs despite the absence of a basilar membrane. Electrical tuning may contribute to these characteristic frequency-dependent delays."
https://openalex.org/W1578889779,Acetylcholinesterase from Electrophorus electricus was acetylated during the hydrolysis of [3H]acetylcholine and [3H]acetylthiocholine. The steady state levels of [3H]acetyl-enzyme were measured at different pH and different concentrations of substrate. The maximum acetylation fraction [S)----infinity) at pH 7.0 in 0.5 M salt was 0.65 with acetylcholine as substrate and 0.57 with acetylthiocholine as substrate. Acetylation is faster than deacetylation. The fraction of acetyl-enzyme was not affected by pH which indicates that acetylation and deacetylation are equally affected by changes in pH. This results supports the concept that acetylation and deacetylation involve similar mechanisms.
https://openalex.org/W1490797465,"We report the first time-resolved fluorescence emission spectra and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropies obtained using frequency-domain fluorescence spectroscopy. We examined the fluorophore p-2-toluidinyl-6-naphthalenesulfonic acid (TNS) in viscous solvents and bound to the heme site of apomyoglobin using multifrequency phase fluorometers. Fluorescence phase shift and modulation data were obtained at modulation frequencies ranging from 1 to 200 MHz. For time-resolved emission spectra, the impulse response for the decay of intensity at each emission wavelength was obtained from the frequency response of the sample at the same emission wavelength. The decays have negative pre-exponential factors, consistent with a time-dependent spectral shift to longer wavelengths. These multiexponential decays were used to construct the time-resolved emission spectra, which were found to be in good agreement with earlier spectra obtained from time-domain measurements. Additionally, time-resolved anisotropies were obtained from the frequency-dependent phase angle differences between the parallel and perpendicularly polarized components of the emission. The rotational correlation times of TNS bound to apomyoglobin are consistent with those expected for this probe rigidly bound to the protein. TNS in propylene glycol also displayed a single exponential decay of anisotropy. These results, in conjunction with the previous successful resolution of multiexponential decays of fluorescence intensity (Lakowicz, J. R., Gratton, E., Laczko, G., Cherek, H., and Limkeman, M. (1984) Biophys. J., in press; Gratton, E., Lakowicz, J. R., Maliwal, B. P., Cherek, H., Laczko, G., and Limkeman, M. (1984) Biophys. J., in press) demonstrate that frequency-domain measurements provide information which is, at a minimum, equivalent to that obtainable from time-domain measurements."
https://openalex.org/W1496084247,"The rate of phosphorylation of phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase was found to be under substrate-directed regulation. Thus, L-phenylalanine made the hydroxylase a better substrate for the kinase, whereas the cofactor l-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) was a negative effector. The dephosphorylation of the enzyme by the kinase in the presence of high concentrations of MgADP was also stimulated by phenylalanine and inhibited by BH4. A kinetic analysis indicated that the effects of phenylalanine and BH4 were mediated by distinct sites coupled by a free energy of 3.2 kJ X mol-1. Among the ligands tested, only phenylalanine and BH4 affected the phosphorylation of the hydroxylase at physiologically relevant concentrations. Whereas higher concentrations of several naturally occurring or synthetic amino acids acted like phenylalanine, the widely used synthetic cofactor 6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin did not mimic the effect of BH4. Less phenylalanine was required to activate the phosphorylated hydroxylase (0.9 mol of phosphate/subunit) than the dephosphorylated enzyme (0.07 mol of phosphate/subunit). This was true whether BH4 was present or not. In conclusion, the substrate phenylalanine makes the hydroxylase more prone to cAMP-dependent phosphorylation, which in turn sensitizes the enzyme towards allosteric activation by phenylalanine. The joint operation of these mechanisms in vivo would increase the efficiency with which phenylalanine controls the activity of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1603062756,"Metallothionein was purified from the livers of adult and neonatal rats. The complete amino acid sequences of isoforms I and II of Cd-induced adult metallothionein were determined by automated Edman degradation of CNBr and tryptic peptides of carboxymethylated proteins. Both isoproteins contain 61 residues, but differ at 12 of those positions. The positions of the 20 cysteinyl residues are invariant with respect to those in other known mammalian metallothioneins. Based on the following criteria, the two soluble and constitutive Zn-metallothionein isoforms from neonatal liver appear identical to their corresponding forms in the adult animal: 1) they behave identically on reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, anion-exchange chromatography and nondenaturing gel electrophoresis; 2) their amino acid compositions are the same within experimental error; and 3) their amino acid sequences are identical in the first 23 residues, even though isoforms I and II differ in 7 of those positions. It appears highly likely that isoforms from both neonatal and adult rats are encoded by the same genes, and therefore that the large age-dependent concentration differences seen in the liver must be due to variation in gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1582925438,"The mechanism of phenol hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.7) has been studied by steady state and rapid reaction kinetic techniques. Both techniques give results consistent with the Bi Uni Uni Bi ping-pong mechanism proposed for other flavin-containing aromatic hydroxylases. The enzyme binds phenolic substrate and NADPH in that order, followed by reduction of the flavin and release of NADP+. A transient charge transfer complex between reduced enzyme and NADP+ can be detected. Molecular oxygen then reacts with the reduced enzyme-substrate complex. Two to three flavin-oxygen intermediates can be detected in the oxidative half-reaction depending on the substrate, provided monovalent anions are present. Oxygen transfer is complete with the formation of the second intermediate. Based on its UV absorption spectrum and on the fact that oxygen transfer has taken place, the last of these intermediates is presumably the flavin C(4a)-hydroxide. Monovalent anions are uncompetitive inhibitors of phenol hydroxylase. The mechanistic step most affected is the dehydration of the flavin C(4a)-hydroxide to give oxidized enzyme. Chloride also kinetically stabilizes the blue flavin semiquinone of phenol hydroxylase during photoreduction. These data suggest binding of monovalent anions results in stabilization of a proton on the N(5) position of the flavin."
https://openalex.org/W1548538139,"The internalization of the insulin receptor in the isolated rat adipose cell and the spatial orientation of the alpha (Mr = 135,000) and beta (Mr = 95,000) subunits of the receptor in the plasma membrane have been examined. The receptor subunits were labeled by lactoperoxidase/Na125I iodination, a technique which side-specifically labels membrane proteins in intact cells and impermeable membrane vesicles. Internalization was induced by incubating cells for 30 min at 37 degrees C in the presence of saturating insulin. Plasma, high density microsomal (endoplasmic reticulum-enriched), and low density microsomal (Golgi-enriched) membrane fractions were prepared by differential ultracentrifugation. Receptor subunit iodination was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-receptor antibodies, sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and autoradiography. When intact cells were surface-labeled and incubated in the absence of insulin, the alpha and beta receptor subunits were clearly observed in the plasma membrane fraction and their quantities in the microsomal membrane fractions paralleled plasma membrane contamination. Following receptor internalization, however, both subunits were decreased in the plasma membrane fraction by 20-30% and concomitantly and stoichiometrically increased in the high and low density microsomal membrane fractions, without alterations in either their apparent molecular size or proportion. In contrast, when the isolated particulate membrane fractions were directly iodinated, both subunits were labeled in the plasma membrane fraction whereas only the beta subunit was prominently labeled in the two microsomal membrane fractions. Iodination of the subcellular fractions following their solubilization in Triton X-100 again clearly labeled both subunits in all three membrane fractions in identical proportions. These results suggest that 1) insulin receptor internalization comprises the translocation of both major receptor subunits from the plasma membrane into at least two different intracellular membrane compartments associated, respectively, with the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi-enriched membrane fractions, 2) this translocation occurs without receptor loss or alterations in receptor subunit structure, and 3) the alpha receptor subunit is primarily, if not exclusively, exposed on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane while the beta receptor subunit traverses the membrane, and this vectorial disposition is inverted during internalization."
https://openalex.org/W166890350,"The Na+/Ca2+ exchange system in rat renal cortex basolateral membrane vesicles was studied. Uptake and efflux of Ca2+ in the membrane vesicles were stimulated by trans-Na+. The enhancement of Ca2+ uptake by the intravesicular greater than extravesicular Na+ gradient was inhibited by ionophores that dissipated the gradient, and was increased by an outside negative membrane potential. Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake was saturable with respect to both Ca2+ and Na+. A [Ca2+]0.5 of 8 microM was calculated. The relationship between Na+ concentration and rate of Ca2+ efflux was sigmoidal; a [Na+]0.5 of 15 mM and a Hill coefficient of 2.5 were estimated. Removal of parathyroid glands from the rats resulted in a 40% decrease in the Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake. Infusion of parathyroid hormone (the synthetic tetratriacontapeptide) into these animals fully restored the activity. The isolated basolateral membrane possessed parathyroid hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase. These findings may suggest a mechanism by which parathyroid hormone regulates the reabsorption of Ca2+ in the kidney."
https://openalex.org/W2127812976,"Infection, dissemination, and transmission of an arbovirus in mosquitoes are enhanced by concurrent ingestion of microfilariae. Ingestion of Rift Valley fever virus alone infected only 64 percent of female Aedes taeniorhynchus. Of these, only 5 percent of refeeding mosquitoes actually transmitted virus. In contrast, ingestion of the same amount of virus from concurrently microfilaremic (Brugia malayi) gerbils resulted in 88 percent infection and 31 percent transmission. Enhanced transmission of virus may be attributed to increased transit of virus across the midgut wall. Endemic filariasis may promote arbovirus transmission in nature."

https://openalex.org/W1514221491,"Vitamin D3 25-hydroxylase activity was measured in subcellular and submitochondrial fractions of human liver. Quantitation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was based on high performance liquid chromatography. Vitamin D3 25-hydroxylase activity was detected in the mitochondrial fraction only. The mitochondrial 25-hydroxylase activity was linear with time up to 60 min and with mitochondrial protein up to 1 mg/ml. An apparent Km value of about 10(-5) M was found. Substrate satuation level was not reached. In the presence of 2.4 X 10(-4) M vitamin D3, the rate of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 formation was 0.19 nmol X mg of protein-1 X h-1 After fractionation of the mitochondria, 86% of the 25-hydroxylase activity was recovered in the mitoplast fraction. The outer membrane fraction was devoid of activity. It is concluded that human liver contains only one detectable vitamin D3 25-hydroxylase enzyme localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1545804535,"Characterization of the catecholamine transporter in chromaffin granule membranes has been hampered by the lack of a radioligand with high specific activity which binds selectively to the carrier with high affinity. We report here the identification of a high affinity binding site for [3H]reserpine on chromaffin granule membranes isolated from bovine adrenal gland which has the characteristics expected of the catecholamine transporter. [3H]Reserpine bound predominately to a high affinity site with a Kd for [3H]reserpine of 9 nM and a binding site density of 7.8 pmol/mg of protein. Comparison of the characteristics of the high affinity reserpine binding site to the characteristics of catecholamine transport indicated that (a) the Ki and rank order of potency for inhibition of [3H]reserpine binding by various biogenic amines was similar to their Ki for inhibition of catecholamine transport (b) both the inhibition of (-)-[3H]norepinephrine transport and inhibition of [3H]reserpine binding showed similar stereo-specificity, and (c) Kd for binding of reserpine to chromaffin granule membranes was similar to the Ki for reserpine inhibition of catecholamine transport. These results demonstrate that the high affinity binding site for [3H]reserpine on chromaffin granule membranes is associated with the catecholamine transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1590789672,"The kinetics of exchange of radiolabeled cholesterol and phospholipids between Mycoplasma gallisepticum cells and an excess of small unilamellar phospholipid/cholesterol vesicles were studied using cells enriched with different phospholipid classes but the same fatty acyl content. The rates of the rapidly exchanging cholesterol and phospholipid pools were markedly slower in sphingomyelin-containing cells than in phosphatidylcholine-containing cells. The decreased rates of spontaneous cholesterol and protein-mediated phospholipid exchange from the outer leaflet of the mycoplasma membrane are attributed to stronger interactions between sphingomyelin and cholesterol than between phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. On the other hand, an increase in cholesterol exchange rate was found on incorporation of a cyclopentano-1,3-diacyl-2-phosphatidylglycerol, which interacts less with cholesterol than does the analogous glycero-1,2-diacyl-sn-3-phosphatidylglycerol."
https://openalex.org/W1926935438,"Sodium fluxes in plasma membrane vesicles prepared from the cultured toad kidney epithelial cell line A6 are studied. The vesicles are enriched 7-10 times in apical membrane markers. Sodium uptake is osmotically sensitive and inhibited by low concentrations of amiloride (K0.5 = 7 X 10(-8) M at 1 mM NaCl). Vesicles prepared from aldosterone-treated cells (4.5 h at 10(-7) M aldosterone) show a 2-fold enhancement of amiloride-sensitive sodium flux relative to appropriate controls. The above observations are in good agreement with studies of sodium transport across the apical membrane of intact A6 epithelia. Thus, the amiloride-sensitive sodium transporter in the apical membrane of these cells is preserved in the vesicle preparation, making it possible to study the effects of aldosterone in the absence of nonmembrane-related phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W1650508442,"Abstract As part of the enterohepatic circulation, hepatocytes take up bile acids from the intestines via the hepatic portal blood using a sodium-dependent carrier mechanism and resecrete the bile acids into the bile. In order to assess whether intracellular organelles are involved in the transcellular secretion of bile acids, we measured directly the ability of purified subcellular fractions of rat liver to take up taurocholate using a Millipore filtration assay. Two distinct uptake mechanisms can be discerned, one localized in the plasma membranes and the other in the Golgi and smooth microsomal fractions. Plasma membranes prepared by the method of Fleischer and Kervina (Fleischer, S., and Kervina, M. (1974) Methods Enzymol. 31, 6) take up taurocholate in a saturable manner with an apparent Vmax of 2.4 nmol min-1 mg protein-1 and a Km of 190 microM at 37 degrees C. After preincubation of the membranes with K+ ions, a sodium gradient (100 mM outside) stimulates the uptake rate by 90% with the observed Km unchanged. The stimulation is inhibited by phalloidin but not by bromosulfophthalein. Bile canalicular plasma membranes made according to Kramer et al. (Kramer, W., Bickel, U., Buscher, H. P., Gerok, W., and Kurz, G. (1982) Eur. J. Biochem. 129, 13-24) do not take up taurocholate. The transport by Golgi vesicles and smooth microsomes differs from that in the plasma membrane fraction in that it is not stimulated by a sodium gradient, has a Vmax of 12 nmol min-1 mg protein-1 and a Km of 440 microM at 37 degrees C, and is inhibited by bromosulfophthalein but not by phalloidin. Taurocholate uptake into smooth microsomes is abolished by filipin, an antibiotic that complexes with cholesterol to disrupt the membrane. This suggests that taurocholate uptake occurs into a nonendoplasmic reticulum subfraction since endoplasmic reticulum membranes contain negligible amounts of cholesterol. Little uptake was observed using rough microsomes or mitochondria. A model of transhepatic transport compatible with our observations is that taurocholate uptake into the cytoplasm occurs via the plasma membranes on the sinusoidal side of the hepatocyte; taurocholate is then taken up into smooth vesicles and the Golgi complex and is secreted into the bile by exocytosis as the vesicles fuse with the canalicular plasma membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2022454395,"Crayfish interneurons were identified that appear to be directly responsible for presynaptic inhibition of primary afferent synapses during crayfish escape behavior. The interneurons are fired by a polysynaptic pathway triggered by the giant escape command axons. When directly stimulated, these interneurons produce short-latency, chloride-dependent primary afferent depolarizations and presynaptically inhibit primary afferent input to mechanosensory interneurons."
https://openalex.org/W1503540291,"Physical interactions between the enzymes involved in the catabolism of the neurotransmitter 4-aminobutyrate were detected by means of affinity chromatography and fluorescence techniques. By immobilizing one (4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase) indirectly through antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose, it was possible to demonstrate that succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase interacts with the aminotransferase at neutral pH and ionic strength values higher than 0.2. Increasing the ionic strength of the medium results in dissociation of the enzyme cluster. Binding of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase to the aminotransferase tagged with a fluorescent probe was detected by polarization of fluorescence measurements at neutral pH. Upon saturation of the aminotransferase with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, the polarization of fluorescence increases from 0.13 to 0.21. The results are consistent with a model in which one molecule of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase is bound to one molecule of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.1 microM. Since the concentrations of both enzymes in the mitochondrial matrix have been estimated to be around 2 microM, the results obtained with the purified mitochondrial enzymes strongly suggest that the aminotransferase is saturated with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase to form a stable enzymatic complex under in vivo conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2161379849,"Metal dissociation constants for glyoxalase I from human erythrocytes were determined by use of nitrilotriacetic acid as a metal buffer. The constants for Zn2+, Co2+, Mn2+, and Mg2+ were (2.7 +/- 0.3) X 10(-11) M, (3.0 +/- 0.8) X 10(-10) M, (4.9 +/- 0.5) X 10(-9) M, and (1.0 +/- 0.2) X 10(-6) M, respectively, demonstrating that the natural cofactor, Zn2+, has the highest affinity for the apoprotein. The results are consistent with the proposal of nitrogen and oxygen atoms as ligands to the metal in the active site of glyoxalase I. In the application of the metal buffer technique, it was found that both 1:1 and 1:2 complexes of the metal ions and nitrilotriacetic acid have to be considered."
https://openalex.org/W1588890254,"Primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes were used to study the effects of 100 mM ethanol on various neutral amino acid transport systems. Ethanol exposure for 24 h selectively decreased amino acid uptake by the A and N systems by 40-70%, but had no significant effect on the ASC and L systems. The decrease in the A system was significant after 3 h of ethanol exposure, and the activity was not affected by the presence or absence of ethanol during the uptake measurements. Kinetic analysis showed that ethanol treatment affected predominantly the high-affinity component of A system activity by decreasing the apparent Vmax without significantly changing the apparent Km. Ethanol treatment did not prevent the cells from increasing A system activity in response to insulin and glucagon, but the magnitude of hormone-stimulated uptake was reduced."
https://openalex.org/W1545856361,"Terbium at submillimolar concentrations appears to bind to the calcium site of apo bovine alpha-lactalbumin and stabilizes the N conformation (fluorescence criterion; Kronman, M. J., Sinha, S., and Brew, K. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 8582-8586). At millimolar concentrations however, it binds additionally to a low affinity site of both apo- and calcium-liganded protein, inducing a time-dependent conformational change to an expanded A-like state. The pH dependence of the transformation implicates the alpha-amino group of glutamic acid 1 of the protein in the binding process. The Zn2+ concentration dependence of the fluorescence of the calcium-free protein indicates there to be two binding sites for this metal ion in agreement with the binding studies with Zn2+ (Bratcher, S.C., and Kronman, M. J. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10875-10886). Binding of Zn2+ at submillimolar concentrations stabilizes the A conformation of the protein in contrast to what was observed with Tb3+ at comparable metal ion concentrations. Millimolar concentrations of Zn2+ induce a time-dependent conformational change in both calcium-free and calcium-liganded alpha-lactalbumin to produce an expanded A-like state comparable to that seen with terbium at similar concentrations. In contrast to the expanded A state induced by high concentrations of zinc or terbium, a collapsed A state results from binding of 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer species, EDTA, and ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (Kronman, M. J., and Bratcher, S. C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 5707-5709), lysine methyl ester, arginine methyl ester, and histidine and by increasing ionic strength of the medium. Since the Zn2+ form of the protein (A conformation) promotes lactose synthetase activity (Kronman et al. cited above), the conformational flexibility of alpha-lactalbumin is likely to be of importance in the formation of the catalytically active complex with galactosyltransferase."

Parenterally administered monoclonal antibodies specific for ZP-2, the most abundant zona protein, localize in the zona pellucida. When labeled with iodine-125, these monoclonal antibodies demonstrate a remarkably high target-to-nontarget tissue ratio and provide clear external radioimaging of ovarian tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1489578295,"Two different methods were used to determine the number of Bohr protons released upon oxygenation of human hemoglobin (Hb A) and Hb A lacking beta 146 His (des-His Hb A) at the pH ranging from pH 5.0 to 9.0 in the presence of 0.1 M Cl- at 25 degrees C. One is the direct differential titration method, the other is based on the measurement of oxygen affinity as a function of pH. The results obtained for Hb A or des-His Hb A with two methods were completely mutually consistent. The number of Bohr protons released from des-His Hb A upon oxygenation at pH 7.5 was about 44% less than that from Hb A, while at pH 5.5 the number of Bohr protons taken up by des-His Hb A was 20% greater than that by Hb A. The differences in the number of Bohr protons between Hb A and des-His Hb A could not be simply ascribed to the lack of beta 146 His from Hb A. The pK alpha values, which were determined by the deuterium exchange method using 1H NMR, were 8.0 for beta 146 His of deoxy-Hb A and 6.5 for that of CO Hb A, while those of beta 143 His were 5.2 for deoxy-Hb A and 6.0 for CO Hb A. From these pK alpha values, in addition to those of alpha 1 Val proposed for the modified CO and deoxy-Hb A with carbamylated beta chains by Van Beek and De Bruin (Van Beek, G. M., and De Bruin, S. H. (1980) Eur. J. Biochem. 105, 353-360), it became evident that almost all (about 92%) of the alkaline Bohr protons released upon oxygenation of Hb A in the presence of 0.1 M Cl- could be accounted for by the protons from these 2 residues, although the involvement of other histidine residues could not be denied. About half the acid Bohr protons from Hb A, which corresponds to the higher pH part (above pH 5.0) of the acid Bohr effect, could be explained by the involvement of beta 143 His residue. The residual acid Bohr effect in the more acidic pH region was presumably contributed by an amino acid residue with pK alpha values of 4.05 and 5.95 for the deoxy- and CO Hb A, respectively, although the amino acid residue was unspecified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1504482786,"The rate of proline transport increases when human dermal fibroblasts are grown in physiological levels of hydrocortisone. This response to hydrocortisone is significantly greater in fibroblasts derived from keloids, benign dermal tumors caused by an inherited abnormality in wound healing (Russell, S. B., Russell, J. D., and Trupin, J. S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9525-9531). We report here that increased transport activity is largely accounted for by an increase in Vmax of the System A component of proline uptake; this stimulation is 1- to 2-fold in normal fibroblasts and 5- to 10-fold in keloid-derived cells. Similar results are obtained with 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid, a specific substrate of System A transport, and for the System A components of glycine and alanine uptake. The stimulatory effect of the hormone is blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin D in both keloid and normal cells. Hydrocortisone did not alter the measured membrane potential in either cell type. These data suggest that hydrocortisone induces a protein specifically involved in System A amino acid transport. Keloid cells may provide a unique opportunity to study this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1528753738,"Direct photoaffinity labeling with radioactively labeled adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography was used to identify PAPS binding proteins in a Golgi membrane preparation of bovine adrenal medulla. [3'-32P]PAPS was synthesized from adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) and [gamma-32P]ATP using APS kinase prepared from yeast and was purified by reverse-phase ion pair high performance liquid chromatography. Upon irradiation with UV light, [3'-32P]PAPS, as well as [35S]PAPS under conditions which minimized sulfotransferase-catalyzed incorporation of 35SO4 from [35S]PAPS into proteins, bound selectively to a 34-kDa protein of the Golgi membrane preparation. PAPS binding to the 34-kDa protein was strongly inhibited by the presence of 50 microM atractyloside. The 34-kDa PAPS binding protein therefore appears to be similar to the mitochondrial ATP/ADP translocator with regard to both molecular weight and inhibition by atractyloside of adenine nucleotide binding. Photoaffinity labeling will be useful in the purification and functional identification of the 34-kDa protein."
https://openalex.org/W1482132390,"Hepatic triglyceride was obtained from post-heparin plasma of rats in an electrophoretically homogeneous form. The enzyme had an isoelectric point at pH 4.9 and molecular weight of 65,000. The relation between the lipase and esterase activities of the enzyme was studied using emulsified triolein and water-soluble methyl butyrate (80 mM) as substrates. The same enzyme protein catalyzed the hydrolyses of both emulsified triolein and water-soluble methyl butyrate. The relation of activity to the methyl butyrate concentration differed from those for pancreatic and liver esterase. During purification, the ratio of methyl butyrate to triolein-hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme increased. On digestion of the enzyme with trypsin, the lipase activity was retained. However, the trypsin-treated enzyme was adsorbed to a heparin-Sepharose column and eluted with 0.75 M NaCl, like the untreated enzyme. These results suggest that rat hepatic triglyceride contains a so-called hydrophobic recognition site that is destroyed by trypsin treatment and is distinct from the heparin-binding and catalytic sites."
