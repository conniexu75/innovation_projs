https://openalex.org/W3093646295,"The three-dimensional positions of atoms in protein molecules define their structure and their roles in biological processes. The more precisely atomic coordinates are determined, the more chemical information can be derived and the more mechanistic insights into protein function may be inferred. Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle analysis has yielded protein structures with increasing levels of detail in recent years1,2. However, it has proved difficult to obtain cryo-EM reconstructions with sufficient resolution to visualize individual atoms in proteins. Here we use a new electron source, energy filter and camera to obtain a 1.7 Å resolution cryo-EM reconstruction for a human membrane protein, the β3 GABAA receptor homopentamer3. Such maps allow a detailed understanding of small-molecule coordination, visualization of solvent molecules and alternative conformations for multiple amino acids, and unambiguous building of ordered acidic side chains and glycans. Applied to mouse apoferritin, our strategy led to a 1.22 Å resolution reconstruction that offers a genuine atomic-resolution view of a protein molecule using single-particle cryo-EM. Moreover, the scattering potential from many hydrogen atoms can be visualized in difference maps, allowing a direct analysis of hydrogen-bonding networks. Our technological advances, combined with further approaches to accelerate data acquisition and improve sample quality, provide a route towards routine application of cryo-EM in high-throughput screening of small molecule modulators and structure-based drug discovery."

https://openalex.org/W3094550675,"Abstract The UK Biobank is a prospective study of 502,543 individuals, combining extensive phenotypic and genotypic data with streamlined access for researchers around the world 1 . Here we describe the release of exome-sequence data for the first 49,960 study participants, revealing approximately 4 million coding variants (of which around 98.6% have a frequency of less than 1%). The data include 198,269 autosomal predicted loss-of-function (LOF) variants, a more than 14-fold increase compared to the imputed sequence. Nearly all genes (more than 97%) had at least one carrier with a LOF variant, and most genes (more than 69%) had at least ten carriers with a LOF variant. We illustrate the power of characterizing LOF variants in this population through association analyses across 1,730 phenotypes. In addition to replicating established associations, we found novel LOF variants with large effects on disease traits, including PIEZO1 on varicose veins, COL6A1 on corneal resistance, MEPE on bone density, and IQGAP2 and GMPR on blood cell traits. We further demonstrate the value of exome sequencing by surveying the prevalence of pathogenic variants of clinical importance, and show that 2% of this population has a medically actionable variant. Furthermore, we characterize the penetrance of cancer in carriers of pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. Exome sequences from the first 49,960 participants highlight the promise of genome sequencing in large population-based studies and are now accessible to the scientific community."

https://openalex.org/W3094078202,"Suppressing infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will probably require the rapid identification and isolation of individuals infected with the virus on an ongoing basis. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are accurate but costly, which makes the regular testing of every individual expensive. These costs are a challenge for all countries around the world, but particularly for low-to-middle-income countries. Cost reductions can be achieved by pooling (or combining) subsamples and testing them in groups1-7. A balance must be struck between increasing the group size and retaining test sensitivity, as sample dilution increases the likelihood of false-negative test results for individuals with a low viral load in the sampled region at the time of the test8. Similarly, minimizing the number of tests to reduce costs must be balanced against minimizing the time that testing takes, to reduce the spread of the infection. Here we propose an algorithm for pooling subsamples based on the geometry of a hypercube that, at low prevalence, accurately identifies individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in a small number of tests and few rounds of testing. We discuss the optimal group size and explain why, given the highly infectious nature of the disease, largely parallel searches are preferred. We report proof-of-concept experiments in which a positive subsample was detected even when diluted 100-fold with negative subsamples (compared with 30-48-fold dilutions described in previous studies9-11). We quantify the loss of sensitivity due to dilution and discuss how it may be mitigated by the frequent re-testing of groups, for example. With the use of these methods, the cost of mass testing could be reduced by a large factor. At low prevalence, the costs decrease in rough proportion to the prevalence. Field trials of our approach are under way in Rwanda and South Africa. The use of group testing on a massive scale to monitor infection rates closely and continually in a population, along with the rapid and effective isolation of people with SARS-CoV-2 infections, provides a promising pathway towards the long-term control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."
https://openalex.org/W3094504206,"Cancer arises from malignant cells that exist in dynamic multilevel interactions with the host tissue. Cancer therapies aiming to directly kill cancer cells, including oncogene-targeted therapy and immune-checkpoint therapy that revives tumour-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes, are effective in some patients1,2, but acquired resistance frequently develops3,4. An alternative therapeutic strategy aims to rectify the host tissue pathology, including abnormalities in the vasculature that foster cancer progression5,6; however, neutralization of proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) has had limited clinical benefits7,8. Here, following the finding that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) suppresses T helper 2 (TH2)-cell-mediated cancer immunity9, we show that blocking TGF-β signalling in CD4+ T cells remodels the tumour microenvironment and restrains cancer progression. In a mouse model of breast cancer resistant to immune-checkpoint or anti-VEGF therapies10,11, inducible genetic deletion of the TGF-β receptor II (TGFBR2) in CD4+ T cells suppressed tumour growth. For pharmacological blockade, we engineered a bispecific receptor decoy by attaching the TGF-β-neutralizing TGFBR2 extracellular domain to ibalizumab, a non-immunosuppressive CD4 antibody12,13, and named it CD4 TGF-β Trap (4T-Trap). Compared with a non-targeted TGF-β-Trap, 4T-Trap selectively inhibited TH cell TGF-β signalling in tumour-draining lymph nodes, causing reorganization of tumour vasculature and cancer cell death, a process dependent on the TH2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4). Notably, the 4T-Trap-induced tumour tissue hypoxia led to increased VEGFA expression. VEGF inhibition enhanced the starvation-triggered cancer cell death and amplified the antitumour effect of 4T-Trap. Thus, targeted TGF-β signalling blockade in helper T cells elicits an effective tissue-level cancer defence response that can provide a basis for therapies directed towards the cancer environment."
https://openalex.org/W3099689784,"Practical and useful quantum information processing (QIP) requires significant improvements with respect to current systems, both in error rates of basic operations and in scale. Individual trapped-ion qubits' fundamental qualities are promising for long-term systems, but the optics involved in their precise control are a barrier to scaling. Planar-fabricated optics integrated within ion trap devices can make such systems simultaneously more robust and parallelizable, as suggested by previous work with single ions. Here we use scalable optics co-fabricated with a surface-electrode ion trap to achieve high-fidelity multi-ion quantum logic gates, often the limiting elements in building up the precise, large-scale entanglement essential to quantum computation. Light is efficiently delivered to a trap chip in a cryogenic environment via direct fibre coupling on multiple channels, eliminating the need for beam alignment into vacuum systems and cryostats and lending robustness to vibrations and beam pointing drifts. This allows us to perform ground-state laser cooling of ion motion, and to implement gates generating two-ion entangled states with fidelities $>99.3(2)\%$. This work demonstrates hardware that reduces noise and drifts in sensitive quantum logic, and simultaneously offers a route to practical parallelization for high-fidelity quantum processors. Similar devices may also find applications in neutral atom and ion-based quantum-sensing and timekeeping."
https://openalex.org/W3093992907,"The immune system uses two distinct defence strategies against infections: microbe-directed pathogen destruction characterized by type 1 immunity1, and host-directed pathogen containment exemplified by type 2 immunity in induction of tissue repair2. Similar to infectious diseases, cancer progresses with self-propagating cancer cells inflicting host-tissue damage. The immunological mechanisms of cancer cell destruction are well defined3–5, but whether immune-mediated cancer cell containment can be induced remains poorly understood. Here we show that depletion of transforming growth factor-β receptor 2 (TGFBR2) in CD4+ T cells, but not CD8+ T cells, halts cancer progression as a result of tissue healing and remodelling of the blood vasculature, causing cancer cell hypoxia and death in distant avascular regions. Notably, the host-directed protective response is dependent on the T helper 2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4), but not the T helper 1 cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Thus, type 2 immunity can be mobilized as an effective tissue-level defence mechanism against cancer. Depletion of transforming growth factor-β receptor 2 (TGFBR2) in CD4+ T cells results in IL-4-dependent vascular remodelling, stopping tumour growth in a transgenic mouse model of breast cancer, suggesting that type 2 immunity could be targeted for cancer treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3094058920,"Cancer therapies that target epigenetic repressors can mediate their effects by activating retroelements within the human genome. Retroelement transcripts can form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that activates the MDA5 pattern recognition receptor1-6. This state of viral mimicry leads to loss of cancer cell fitness and stimulates innate and adaptive immune responses7,8. However, the clinical efficacy of epigenetic therapies has been limited. To find targets that would synergize with the viral mimicry response, we sought to identify the immunogenic retroelements that are activated by epigenetic therapies. Here we show that intronic and intergenic SINE elements, specifically inverted-repeat Alus, are the major source of drug-induced immunogenic dsRNA. These inverted-repeat Alus are frequently located downstream of 'orphan' CpG islands9. In mammals, the ADAR1 enzyme targets and destabilizes inverted-repeat Alu dsRNA10, which prevents activation of the MDA5 receptor11. We found that ADAR1 establishes a negative-feedback loop, restricting the viral mimicry response to epigenetic therapy. Depletion of ADAR1 in patient-derived cancer cells potentiates the efficacy of epigenetic therapy, restraining tumour growth and reducing cancer initiation. Therefore, epigenetic therapies trigger viral mimicry by inducing a subset of inverted-repeats Alus, leading to an ADAR1 dependency. Our findings suggest that combining epigenetic therapies with ADAR1 inhibitors represents a promising strategy for cancer treatment."

https://openalex.org/W3094331871,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a mutation or deletion of the maternally inherited UBE3A allele. In neurons, the paternally inherited UBE3A allele is silenced in cis by a long non-coding RNA called UBE3A-ATS. Here, as part of a systematic screen, we found that Cas9 can be used to activate ('unsilence') paternal Ube3a in cultured mouse and human neurons when targeted to Snord115 genes, which are small nucleolar RNAs that are clustered in the 3' region of Ube3a-ATS. A short Cas9 variant and guide RNA that target about 75 Snord115 genes were packaged into an adeno-associated virus and administered to a mouse model of AS during the embryonic and early postnatal stages, when the therapeutic benefit of restoring Ube3a is predicted to be greatest1,2. This early treatment unsilenced paternal Ube3a throughout the brain for at least 17 months and rescued anatomical and behavioural phenotypes in AS mice. Genomic integration of the adeno-associated virus vector into Cas9 target sites caused premature termination of Ube3a-ATS at the vector-derived polyA cassette, or when integrated in the reverse orientation, by transcriptional collision with the vector-derived Cas9 transcript. Our study shows that targeted genomic integration of a gene therapy vector can restore the function of paternally inherited UBE3A throughout life, providing a path towards a disease-modifying treatment for a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder."
https://openalex.org/W3093924387,"Background Quarantine often is an unpleasant experience. The aim of this study is to explore the degree of psychological distress in terms of–Depression, Anxiety and Stress among the adult population in India during the strict 21 days mandatory lockdown. We hypothesize that quantification of psychological impact of current situation will help us to modify the policies and implementation strategies. This assessment might also help in future to keep targeted services in place, to cope up with the psychological distress of the quarantined population. Method A cross sectional survey design was adopted to assess the psychological state of general population in India, during the COVID-19 mandatory lockdown period, with the help of a validated questionnaire. Findings The reported prevalence of depression was around 30.5%, which was the highest among the variables of psychological health. Anxiety was reported by 22.4%, followed by stress which was seen in 10.8% of respondents. In the third week the incidence of depression (37.8% versus 23.4%; p<0.001), anxiety (26.6% versus 18.2%; p<0.001) and stress (12.2% versus 9.3%; p<0.045) was reported to be significantly higher as compared to second week. Interpretation Our results suggest a progressively detrimental impact of lockdown on various aspects of psychological health. We noticed around eight to ten fold increase in the prevalence of depression (30.5%) and anxiety (22.4%) during lockdown, as compared to baseline statistics in Indian population (3·1–3·6% for depressive disorders and 3·0–3·5% for anxiety disorders)."
https://openalex.org/W3094281091,"Transcription factors recognize specific genomic sequences to regulate complex gene-expression programs. Although it is well-established that transcription factors bind to specific DNA sequences using a combination of base readout and shape recognition, some fundamental aspects of protein–DNA binding remain poorly understood1,2. Many DNA-binding proteins induce changes in the structure of the DNA outside the intrinsic B-DNA envelope. However, how the energetic cost that is associated with distorting the DNA contributes to recognition has proven difficult to study, because the distorted DNA exists in low abundance in the unbound ensemble3–9. Here we use a high-throughput assay that we term SaMBA (saturation mismatch-binding assay) to investigate the role of DNA conformational penalties in transcription factor–DNA recognition. In SaMBA, mismatched base pairs are introduced to pre-induce structural distortions in the DNA that are much larger than those induced by changes in the Watson–Crick sequence. Notably, approximately 10% of mismatches increased transcription factor binding, and for each of the 22 transcription factors that were examined, at least one mismatch was found that increased the binding affinity. Mismatches also converted non-specific sites into high-affinity sites, and high-affinity sites into ‘super sites’ that exhibit stronger affinity than any known canonical binding site. Determination of high-resolution X-ray structures, combined with nuclear magnetic resonance measurements and structural analyses, showed that many of the DNA mismatches that increase binding induce distortions that are similar to those induced by protein binding—thus prepaying some of the energetic cost incurred from deforming the DNA. Our work indicates that conformational penalties are a major determinant of protein–DNA recognition, and reveals mechanisms by which mismatches can recruit transcription factors and thus modulate replication and repair activities in the cell10,11. A high-throughput assay that introduces mismatched base pairs into the DNA sequence shows that mismatches can increase transcription factor binding affinity by prepaying some of the energetic cost of distorting the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W3093891788,"Astrocytes tile the central nervous system and are widely implicated in brain diseases, but the molecular mechanisms by which astrocytes contribute to brain disorders remain incompletely explored. By performing astrocyte gene expression analyses following 14 experimental perturbations of relevance to the striatum, we discovered that striatal astrocytes mount context-specific molecular responses at the level of genes, pathways, and upstream regulators. Through data mining, we also identified astrocyte pathways in Huntington's disease (HD) that were reciprocally altered with respect to the activation of striatal astrocyte G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Furthermore, selective striatal astrocyte stimulation of the Gi-GPCR pathway in vivo corrected several HD-associated astrocytic, synaptic, and behavioral phenotypes, with accompanying improvement of HD-associated astrocyte signaling pathways, including those related to synaptogenesis and neuroimmune functions. Overall, our data show that astrocytes are malleable, using context-specific responses that can be dissected molecularly and used for phenotypic benefit in brain disorders."

https://openalex.org/W3094482913,"The seismic low-velocity zone (LVZ) of the upper mantle is generally associated with a low-viscosity asthenosphere that has a key role in decoupling tectonic plates from the mantle1. However, the origin of the LVZ remains unclear. Some studies attribute its low seismic velocities to a small amount of partial melt of minerals in the mantle2,3, whereas others attribute them to solid-state mechanisms near the solidus4–6 or the effect of its volatile contents6. Observations of shear attenuation provide additional constraints on the origin of the LVZ7. On the basis of the interpretation of global three-dimensional shear attenuation and velocity models, here we report partial melt occurring within the LVZ. We observe that partial melting down to 150–200 kilometres beneath mid-ocean ridges, major hotspots and back-arc regions feeds the asthenosphere. A small part of this melt (less than 0.30 per cent) remains trapped within the oceanic LVZ. Melt is mostly absent under continental regions. The amount of melt increases with plate velocity, increasing substantially for plate velocities of between 3 centimetres per year and 5 centimetres per year. This finding is consistent with previous observations of mantle crystal alignment underneath tectonic plates8. Our observations suggest that by reducing viscosity9 melt facilitates plate motion and large-scale crystal alignment in the asthenosphere. Analysis of global three-dimensional shear attenuation and velocity models implies that partial melting in the seismic low-velocity zone enables motion of oceanic plates by reducing the viscosity of the asthenosphere."
https://openalex.org/W3106361461,"Planet formation is generally described in terms of a system containing the host star and a protoplanetary disk1-3, of which the internal properties (for example, mass and metallicity) determine the properties of the resulting planetary system4. However, (proto)planetary systems are predicted5,6 and observed7,8 to be affected by the spatially clustered stellar formation environment, through either dynamical star-star interactions or external photoevaporation by nearby massive stars9. It is challenging to quantify how the architecture of planetary sysems is affected by these environmental processes, because stellar groups spatially disperse within less than a billion years10, well below the ages of most known exoplanets. Here we identify old, co-moving stellar groups around exoplanet host stars in the astrometric data from the Gaia satellite11,12 and demonstrate that the architecture of planetary systems exhibits a strong dependence on local stellar clustering in position-velocity phase space. After controlling for host stellar age, mass, metallicity and distance from the star, we obtain highly significant differences (with p values of 10-5 to 10-2) in planetary system properties between phase space overdensities (composed of a greater number of co-moving stars than unstructured space) and the field. The median semi-major axis and orbital period of planets in phase space overdensities are 0.087 astronomical units and 9.6 days, respectively, compared to 0.81 astronomical units and 154 days, respectively, for planets around field stars. 'Hot Jupiters' (massive, short-period exoplanets) predominantly exist in stellar phase space overdensities, strongly suggesting that their extreme orbits originate from environmental perturbations rather than internal migration13,14 or planet-planet scattering15,16. Our findings reveal that stellar clustering is a key factor setting the architectures of planetary systems."
https://openalex.org/W3094177723,"Antibodies that antagonize extracellular receptor–ligand interactions are used as therapeutic agents for many diseases to inhibit signalling by cell-surface receptors1. However, this approach does not directly prevent intracellular signalling, such as through tonic or sustained signalling after ligand engagement. Here we present an alternative approach for attenuating cell-surface receptor signalling, termed receptor inhibition by phosphatase recruitment (RIPR). This approach compels cis-ligation of cell-surface receptors containing ITAM, ITIM or ITSM tyrosine phosphorylation motifs to the promiscuous cell-surface phosphatase CD452,3, which results in the direct intracellular dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the receptor target. As an example, we found that tonic signalling by the programmed cell death-1 receptor (PD-1) results in residual suppression of T cell activation, but is not inhibited by ligand-antagonist antibodies. We engineered a PD-1 molecule, which we denote RIPR-PD1, that induces cross-linking of PD-1 to CD45 and inhibits both tonic and ligand-activated signalling. RIPR-PD1 demonstrated enhanced inhibition of checkpoint blockade compared with ligand blocking by anti-PD1 antibodies, and increased therapeutic efficacy over anti-PD1 in mouse tumour models. We also show that the RIPR strategy extends to other immune-receptor targets that contain activating or inhibitory ITIM, ITSM or ITAM motifs; for example, inhibition of the macrophage SIRPα ‘don’t eat me’ signal with a SIRPα–CD45 RIPR molecule potentiates antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis beyond that of SIRPα blockade alone. RIPR represents a general strategy for direct attenuation of signalling by kinase-activated cell-surface receptors. A approach termed ‘receptor inhibition by phosphatase recruitment’ is described for attenuating both tonic and ligand-activated cell-surface receptor signalling."
https://openalex.org/W3094621838,"Time-lapse microscopy is routinely used to follow cells within organoids, allowing direct study of division and differentiation patterns. There is an increasing interest in cell tracking in organoids, which makes it possible to study their growth and homeostasis at the single-cell level. As tracking these cells by hand is prohibitively time consuming, automation using a computer program is required. Unfortunately, organoids have a high cell density and fast cell movement, which makes automated cell tracking difficult. In this work, a semi-automated cell tracker has been developed. To detect the nuclei, we use a machine learning approach based on a convolutional neural network. To form cell trajectories, we link detections at different time points together using a min-cost flow solver. The tracker raises warnings for situations with likely errors. Rapid changes in nucleus volume and position are reported for manual review, as well as cases where nuclei divide, appear and disappear. When the warning system is adjusted such that virtually error-free lineage trees can be obtained, still less than 2% of all detected nuclei positions are marked for manual analysis. This provides an enormous speed boost over manual cell tracking, while still providing tracking data of the same quality as manual tracking."
https://openalex.org/W3094453699,"Color-based image segmentation classifies pixels of digital images in numerous groups for further analysis in computer vision, pattern recognition, image understanding, and image processing applications. Various algorithms have been developed for image segmentation, but clustering algorithms play an important role in the segmentation of digital images. This paper presents a novel and adaptive initialization approach to determine the number of clusters and find the initial central points of clusters for the standard K-means algorithm to solve the segmentation problem of color images. The presented scheme uses a scanning procedure of the paired Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) color-channel histograms for determining the most salient modes in every histogram. Next, the histogram thresholding is applied and a search in every histogram mode is performed to accomplish RGB pairs. These RGB pairs are used as the initial cluster centers and cluster numbers that clustered each pixel into the appropriate region for generating the homogeneous regions. The proposed technique determines the best initialization parameters for the conventional K-means clustering technique. In this paper, the proposed approach was compared with various unsupervised image segmentation techniques on various image segmentation benchmarks. Furthermore, we made use of a ranking approach inspired by the Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) method to account for segmentation integrity. The experimental results show that the proposed technique outperforms the other existing clustering techniques by optimizing the segmentation quality and possibly reducing the classification error."
https://openalex.org/W3094074015,"Ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury results in devastating skeletal muscle fibrosis. Here, we recapitulate this injury with a mouse model of hindlimb IR injury which leads to skeletal muscle fibrosis. Injury resulted in extensive immune infiltration with robust neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in the skeletal muscle, however, direct targeting of NETs via the peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) mechanism was insufficient to reduce muscle fibrosis. Circulating levels of IL-10 and TNFα were significantly elevated post injury, indicating toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling may be involved in muscle injury. Administration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a small molecule inhibitor of TLR7/8/9, following injury reduced NET formation, IL-10, and TNFα levels and ultimately mitigated muscle fibrosis and improved myofiber regeneration following IR injury. HCQ treatment decreased fibroadipogenic progenitor cell proliferation and partially inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the injured tissue, suggesting it may act through a combination of TLR7/8/9 and ERK signaling mechanisms. We demonstrate that treatment with FDA-approved HCQ leads to decreased muscle fibrosis and increased myofiber regeneration following IR injury, suggesting short-term HCQ treatment may be a viable treatment to prevent muscle fibrosis in ischemia reperfusion and traumatic extremity injury."

Methylation levels, mRNA and protein expression of NF-κB and SOD2 genes were measured in human endothelial cells exposed to high glucose for 7 days and treated with GLP-1R agonists. Methylation status of NF-κB and SOD2 promoter was also analyzed in 128 diabetics and 116 nondiabetics and correlated with intima media thickness (ITM), an early marker of atherosclerotic process. Cells exposed to high glucose showed lower NF-κB and SOD2 methylation levels, increased NF-κB and reduced SOD2 expression compared to normal glucose cells. Co-treatment with GLP-1 agonists prevented methylation and genes expression changes induced by high glucose. Both high glucose and incretins exposure increased DNA methyltransferases and demethylases levels. In diabetics, incretin treatment resulted a significant predictor of NF-κB DNA methylation, independently of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), glucose and plasma lipid levels. NF-κB DNA methylation inversely correlated with IMT after adjusting for multiple covariates.

https://openalex.org/W3091856220,"Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that mediate the transport of intracellular molecules, including neurodegenerative agents. Exogenously administrated ceramides have been implicated in the acceleration of exosome production by neurons; however, the molecular machinery involved in this process is unknown. Here, we found that ceramides, especially those consisting of long fatty acids, were internalized into the endocytic pathway in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to induce exosome secretion through lysosome-associated protein transmembrane 4B (LAPTM4B). Knockdown of LAPTM4B inhibited the ceramide-mediated increase in exosome release completely. Fluorescence microscopy observations indicated that exogenous ceramides promote the transport of multivesicular bodies to the plasma membranes in a LAPTM4B-dependent manner. Similarly, inhibition of acid ceramidase, which tends to induce intracellular ceramide accumulation, increased exosome production by SH-SY5Y cells in a LAPTM4B-dependent manner. Furthermore, the level of amyloid-s protein (As) was decreased in neuronal cells following treatment with exogenous ceramide or inhibition of acid ceramidase, and this effect was attributed to the LAPTM4B-dependent efflux of As-containing exosomes. Overall, these findings reveal the novel machinery involved in exosome secretion regulated by ceramides and LAPTM4B, and may contribute to efforts to ameliorate the cellular accumulation of neurodegenerative agents such as As."

We inoculated five pregnant macaques with ZIKV and mock-inoculated one macaque in the first trimester. Following birth, growth, ocular structure/function, brain structure, hearing, histopathology, and neurobehavior were quantitatively assessed during the first week of life. We identified the typical pregnancy outcomes of congenital ZIKV infection, with fetal demise and placental abnormalities. We estimated sample sizes needed to define differences between groups and demonstrated that future studies quantifying brain region volumes, retinal structure, hearing, and visual pathway function require a sample size of 14 animals per group (14 ZIKV, 14 control) to detect statistically significant differences in at least half of the infant exam parameters. Establishing the parameters for future studies of neurodevelopmental outcomes following congenital ZIKV exposure in macaques is essential for robust and rigorous experimental design."
https://openalex.org/W3094127818,"Increasing coastal populations and urban development have led to the loss of estuarine habitats for fish and wildlife. Specifically, a decline in complexity and heterogeneity of tidal marshes and creeks is thought to negatively impact fish communities by altering the function of nursery grounds, including predator refuge and prey resources. To offset these impacts, numerous agencies are restoring degraded habitats while also creating new ones where habitat has been lost. To improve understanding of what contributes to a successful restoration, six quarterly sampling events using two gear types to collect small- and large-bodied fishes were conducted to compare the fish community structure and habitat characteristics at three natural, three restored, and three impacted (i.e. ditched) areas along the coast of Tampa Bay, Florida. Overall, impacted sites had significantly lower small-bodied and juvenile fish diversity than natural and restored areas, while restored sites harbored a greater number of fish species than impacted sites for both large- and small-bodied fish. Habitat features such as shoreline slope differentiated impacted and restored from natural areas. Although we did not find a direct correlation, habitat heterogeneity likely played a role in structuring fish communities. These findings provide guidance for future coastal restoration or modification of existing projects. Specifically, the habitat mosaic approach of creating a geographically compact network of heterogenous habitat characteristics is likely to support fish diversity, while decreasing shoreline slope in a greater amount of area within coastal wetland restorations would more closely mimic natural areas."
https://openalex.org/W3093630948,"Loss of chondroitin sulfate (CS) has been reported to play a key role during intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). However, the detailed mechanism of CS and its synthases have not been elucidated. Since CS is mainly synthesized by chondroitin synthases 3 (Chsy3), here, the Chsy3 knockout mice are generated by using CRISPR-Cas9 and semi-cloning technology to study its mechanism during IDD. We find that CS and Chsy3 expression are decreased during IDD both in human and mice nucleus pulposus (NP) tissue, and knockout of Chsy3 shows that spontaneous IDD phenotype resembles that of human samples in the Chsy3−/− mice. Taking advantage of RNA-Seq data, we confirm increased catabolic and decreased anabolic changes in Chsy3−/− NP cells. By using bioinformatic analysis and validation, we find that Hippo signaling pathway is significantly downregulated, and the activation of Yap1 is mainly affected in Chsy3−/− NP cells. Furthermore, functional analyses have shown that Chsy3 could regulate NP cell degeneration by Actin tension mediated activation of Yap1, which is independent of Hippo/Lats signaling. In summary, our findings reveal a novel mechanism that depletion of CS-related Chsy3 can cause spontaneous intervertebral disc degeneration by mediating Yap activation through CS-related actin-tension in NP cells."

The climate in Southern Chile is temperate rainy with high annual precipitations which represents ideal preconditions for survival of Leptospira spp., especially during spring and summer. The aims of this study were to investigate shedding of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in outdoor cats in Southern Chile, to perform molecular characterization of isolates growing in culture, and to assess potential risk factors associated with shedding. Urine samples of 231 outdoor cats from rural and urban areas in southern Chile were collected. Urine samples were investigated for pathogenic Leptospira spp. by 4 techniques: qPCR targeting the lipL32 gene, immunomagnetic separation (IMS)-coupled qPCR (IMS-qPCR), direct culture and IMS-coupled culture. Positive urine cultures were additionally confirmed by PCR. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to molecularly characterize isolates obtained from positive cultures. Overall, 36 urine samples (15.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.4–20.9) showed positive results. Eighteen (7.8%, 95% CI 4.9–12.1), 30 (13%, 95% CI 9.2–18), 3 (1.3%, 0.3–3.9) and 4 cats (1.7%; 95% CI 0.5–4.5) were positive in qPCR, IMS-qPCR, conventional culture, and IMS-coupled culture, respectively. MLST results of 7 culture-positive cats revealed sequences that could be assigned to sequence type 17 (6 cats) and sequence type 27 (1 cat) corresponding to L. interrogans (Pathogenic Leptospira Subgroup 1). Shedding of pathogenic Leptospira spp. by cats might be an underestimated source of infection for other species including humans. The present study is the first one reporting growth of leptospires from feline urine in culture in naturally infected cats in South-America and characterisation of culture-derived isolates. So far, very few cases of successful attempts to culture leptospires from naturally infected cats are described worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W3094478882,"The research objective was to study the presence of DNA damages in haddock exposed to petrogenic or pyrogenic polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from different sources: 1) extracts of oil produced water (PW), dominated by 2-ring PAHs; 2) distillation fractions of crude oil (representing oil-based drilling mud), dominated by 3-ring PAHs; 3) heavy pyrogenic PAHs, mixture of 4/5/6-ring PAHs. The biological effect of the different PAH sources was studied by feeding juvenile haddock with low doses of PAHs (0.3–0.7 mg PAH/kg fish/day) for two months, followed by a two-months recovery. In addition to the oral exposure, a group of fish was exposed to 12 single compounds of PAHs (4/5/6-ring) via intraperitoneal injection. The main endpoint was the analysis of hepatic and intestinal DNA adducts. In addition, PAH burden in liver, bile metabolites, gene and protein expression of CYP1A, GST activity, lipid peroxidation, skeletal deformities and histopathology of livers were evaluated. Juvenile haddock responded quickly to both intraperitoneal injection and oral exposure of 4/5/6-ring PAHs. High levels of DNA adducts were detected in livers three days after the dose of the single compound exposure. Fish had also high levels of DNA adducts in liver after being fed with extracts dominated by 2-ring PAHs (a PW exposure scenario) and 3-ring PAHs (simulating an oil exposure scenario). Elevated levels of DNA adducts were observed in the liver of all exposed groups after the 2 months of recovery. High levels of DNA adduct were found also in the intestines of individuals exposed to oil or heavy PAHs, but not in the PW or control groups. This suggests that the intestinal barrier is very important for detoxification of orally exposures of PAHs."
https://openalex.org/W3094444910,"Several lines of evidence suggest that the aggregation and deposition of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) initiate the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, a genome-wide association study demonstrated that a single-nucleotide polymorphism proximal to the EPHA4 gene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, is associated with AD risk. However, the molecular mechanism of EphA4 in the pathogenesis of AD, particularly in Aβ production, remains unknown. Here, we performed several pharmacological and biological experiments both in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated that EphA4 is responsible for the regulation of Aβ production. Pharmacological inhibition of EphA4 signaling and knockdown of Epha4 led to increased Aβ levels accompanied by increased expression of β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), which is an enzyme responsible for Aβ production. Moreover, EPHA4 overexpression and activation of EphA4 signaling via ephrin ligands decreased Aβ levels. In particular, the sterile-alpha motif domain of EphA4 was necessary for the regulation of Aβ production. Finally, EPHA4 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in the brains of AD patients, and negatively correlated with BACE1 mRNA levels. Our results indicate a novel mechanism of Aβ regulation by EphA4, which is involved in AD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3094571510,"Background Under the pandemic conditions created by the novel coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19), physicians have faced difficult choices allocating scarce resources, including but not limited to critical care beds and ventilators. Past experiences with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and current reports suggest that making these decisions carries a heavy emotional toll for physicians around the world. We sought to explore Canadian physicians’ preparedness and attitudes regarding resource allocation decisions. Methods From April 3 to April 13, 2020, we conducted an 8-question online survey of physicians practicing in the region of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, organized around 4 themes: physician preparedness for resource rationing, physician preparedness to offer palliative care, attitudes towards resource allocation policy, and approaches to resource allocation decision-making. Results We collected 219 responses, of which 165 were used for analysis. The majority (78%) of respondents felt ""somewhat"" or ""a little prepared"" to make resource allocation decisions, and 13% felt “not at all prepared.” A majority of respondents (63%) expected the provision of palliative care to be “very” or “somewhat difficult.” Most respondents (83%) either strongly or somewhat agreed that there should be policy to guide resource allocation. Physicians overwhelmingly agreed on certain factors that would be important in resource allocation, including whether patients were likely to survive, and whether they had dementia and other significant comorbidities. Respondents generally did not feel confident that they would have the social support they needed at the time of making resource allocation decisions. Interpretation This rapidly implemented survey suggests that a sample of Canadian physicians feel underprepared to make resource allocation decisions, and desire both more emotional support and clear, transparent, evidence-based policy."

https://openalex.org/W3094460893,"Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) is a life-threatening autoimmune disorder characterized by a self-mediated attack on circulating red blood cells. The disease occurs naturally in both dogs and humans, but is significantly more prevalent in dogs. Because of its shared features across species, dogs offer a naturally occurring model for studying IMHA in people. In this study, we used RNA sequencing of whole blood from treatment-naïve dogs to study transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression in newly diagnosed animals compared to healthy controls. We found many overexpressed genes in pathways related to neutrophil function, coagulation, and hematopoiesis. In particular, the most highly overexpressed gene in cases was a phospholipase scramblase, which mediates the externalization of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer leaflet of cell membranes. This family of genes has been shown to be critically important for programmed cell death of erythrocytes as well as the initiation of the clotting cascade. Unexpectedly, we found marked underexpression of many genes related to lymphocyte function. We also identified groups of genes that are highly associated with the inflammatory response and red blood cell regeneration in affected dogs. We did not find any genes that distinguished dogs that lived vs. those that died at 30 days following diagnosis, nor did we find any relevant genomic signatures of microbial organisms in the blood of affected animals. Future studies are warranted to validate these findings and assess their implication in developing novel therapeutic approaches for dogs and humans with IMHA."
https://openalex.org/W3094567660,"The Mozambique Indicators of Immunization, Malaria and HIV/AIDS (IMASIDA) survey was conducted in 2015 and used a two Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) (Vironostika HIV-1/2 and Murex HIV-1/2) based algorithm to determine the HIV status of the consented participants. The Mozambique Ministry of Health, with support from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), added Bio-Rad Geenius™ HIV-1/2 Supplemental Assay to the IMASIDA HIV testing algorithm to confirm all specimens that were found to be reactive on one or both EIAs. In total 11690 specimens were collected to estimate the proportion of HIV positive samples. Results indicate that the proportion of HIV positive samples based on the concordant positive results of two EIA assays was 21.5% (2518/11690). The addition of the Geenius assay to the IMASIDA HIV testing algorithm demonstrated that 792 (31.5%) of 2518 specimens were false-positive and reduced the proportion of HIV positive samples to 14.7% (1722/11690), demonstrating the importance of including a highly specific HIV test to confirm HIV diagnosis. HIV surveys exclusively based on EIA testing algorithm may result in misleading high prevalence results. Our results demonstrate that more specific confirmatory testing should be added to the EIA-based algorithms to ensure accurate HIV diagnosis and correct HIV prevalence estimate in cross-sectional surveys."
https://openalex.org/W3093704548,"Postischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical complication and often fatal, with no effective treatment available. Little is known about the role of leukocytes trapped in renal vessels during ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in the postischemic AKI. We designed a new animal model in rats with preforming renal artery lavage prior to IRI to investigate the effect of diminishing the residual circulating leukocytes on kidney damage and inflammation. Moreover, the functional changes of macrophages in hypoxia reoxygenation condition were also analyzed. We found pre-ischemic renal lavage significantly decreased the serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, and downregulated the mRNA and protein expressions in kidneys and urinary secretion of kidney injury molecule-1 of rats after IRI. The renal pathological damage caused by IRI was also ameliorated by pre-ischemic renal lavage, as evidenced by fewer cast formation, diminished morphological signs of AKI in the tissue at 24 hours after IRI. Pre-ischemic renal lavage reduced the numbers of infiltrating CD68+ macrophages and MPO+ neutrophils. The mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory mediator in IRI kidneys and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in circulatory system and urine were also reduced due to pre-ischemic lavage. Compared with nontreated rats with IRI, pre-ischemic renal lavage significantly reduced the phosphorylation levels of ERK and p65 subunit of NF-κB in the kidney after IRI. In addition, we found hypoxia/reoxygenation could promote the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and inhibit the expression of anti-inflammatory factors by regulating ERK/NF-κB signaling pathway. Thus, pre-ischemic renal lavage could clearly reduce the renal damage after IRI by attenuating inflammation, and macrophages trapped in renal vessels during IRI could be important pathogenic factors driving tissue injury."
https://openalex.org/W3093988109,"Diabetic retinopathy is a microvascular complication of hyperglycaemia. Little is known about the association of glucose metabolism and retinopathy signs in the non-diabetic middle-aged population. We studied prevalence of retinopathy in a subsample of Northern Finland Birth Cohort study (NFBC1966) of 1809 subjects, at 47 years of age, without previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes and/or blood pressure-lowering medication. All participants underwent clinical evaluations including an oral glucose tolerance test (glucose and insulin values measured at 0, 30, 60 and 120 min) and HbA1c. The retinopathy signs were diagnosed by fundus photographs and classified according to the Eurodiab classification scheme. The overall prevalence of newly diagnosed retinopathy was 1.4%. The retinopathy signs were significantly associated with increased 30 min, 1-h and 2-h glucose levels and 2-h insulin level in an OGTT. After adjustment with systolic blood pressure, only 30 min glucose, 1-h glucose and 2-h insulin levels were associated with retinopathy signs. Our findings show the potential role of 30 min and 1-h post-load glucose and 2-h insulin levels as risk factors for retinopathy lesions among the participants without previously diagnosed diabetes or hypertensive medication."
https://openalex.org/W3094173674,"In a recent study, using an in vitro model to study intravaginal nanoparticle exposure during yeast infections, we demonstrated that C. albicans exposure suppressed apoptotic gene expression and induced oxidative stress and pyroptosis in vaginal epithelial cells. The mucous-penetrating drug delivery nanoparticles made from poly-(D, L-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-(polyethylene glycol) induced cytotoxicity by activating apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, oxidative stress, and DNA damage repair responses alone and, in some cases with C. albicans. In the current study we evaluated the effects of fluorescently-labelled nanoparticles in CBA/J mice challenged intravaginally for two hours followed by intravaginal challenge with C. albicans for 18 hours. Nanoparticle treatment increased systemic translocation of C. albicans threefold in the heart. C. albicans also increased systemic distribution of the nanoparticles fivefold in the heart. Flow cytometric assays showed co-localization of the nanoparticles with epithelial cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Nanoparticle-treated, C. albicans-infected mice exhibited induction of autophagy, ER stress, apoptosis, and inflammatory serum cytokines. C. albicans infection was associated with pyroptosis and suppressed expression of ER stress and apoptosis-related genes. Induction of apoptosis during nanoparticle treatment and in nanoparticle-treated-C. albicans infected mice was observed as DNA damage responses, mitochondrial depolarization and (Poly [ADP-Ribose] Polymerase) cleavage. C. albicans infection was associated with increased mRNA expression of anti-apoptotic genes. Both C. albicans infection and nanoparticle treatment showed enhanced chemoattraction of dendritic cells and polymorphonuclear cells to factors in vaginal washings in a chemotaxis assay. This study shows that both intravaginal treatment of mice with the nanoparticles and infection with C. albicans induce cytotoxic and inflammatory responses. C. albicans also suppressed cell apoptosis. These results clarify our understanding of how nanoparticles modulate host cellular responses during C. albicans infection and will be applicable for future research and development of intravaginal nanomedicines."
https://openalex.org/W3094250420,"Mass spectrometry is a fundamental tool for modern proteomics. The increasing availability of mass spectrometry data paired with the increasing sensitivity and fidelity of the instruments necessitates new and more potent analytical methods. To that end, we have created and present XFlow, a feature detection algorithm for extracting ion chromatograms from MS1 LC-MS data. XFlow is a parameter-free procedurally agnostic feature detection algorithm that utilizes the latent properties of ion chromatograms to resolve them from the surrounding noise present in MS1 data. XFlow is designed to function on either profile or centroided data across different resolutions and instruments. This broad applicability lends XFlow strong utility as a one-size-fits-all method for MS1 analysis or target acquisition for MS2. XFlow is written in Java and packaged with JS-MS, an open-source mass spectrometry analysis toolkit."
https://openalex.org/W3094597116,"Incineration has emerged as one of the acceptable ways to treat municipal solid waste (MSW) due to its potential in reducing the mass and volume of the waste. However, it produces two major by-product residues, namely MSW-bottom ash (MSW-BA) and MSW-fly ash (MSW-FA). These residues have gained great attention to their hazardous nature and potential to be reused and recycled. In this paper, the physicochemical characterizations of the MSW-BA and the MSW-FA were performed, followed by a systematic investigation of metals extraction from MSW-BA and MSW-FA. Various extracting agents were used to investigate the possibility to extract 21 metals including cadmium (Cd), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb). It was revealed that some metals were present in a high amount in the MSW-BA while other metals were higher in the MSW-FA. Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy results revealed that the MSW-BA was dominated by oxygen (O) 55.4 ±0.6 wt%, silicon (Si) 22.5 ±0.3 wt%, and calcium (Ca) 18.5 ±0.2 wt%. On the other hand, the MSW-FA was enriched with Ca 45.2 ±0.5 wt%, and O 40.3 ±0.4 wt%. From the scanning electron microscopy, the MSW-BA was observed as flaky with an irregular surface that consisted of large pores, while, the MSW-FA was present as agglomerated particles and had a bimodal distribution. Moreover, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that Al-Fe-OH, Al-Al-OH, Si-O, C-O, and C-H were some of the major functional groups present in the ashes. The F-tests concluded that the metal extraction from the MSW-BA and MSW-FA were significantly affected by the acid type. it is concluded that nitric acid and phosphoric acid were the best-suited acid for the MSW-BA while sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid for the MSW-FA. More than 11 wt% of Cd and 9 wt% of Cu were extracted from MSW-BA while 6 wt% of Pb and 4.5 wt% of V were extracted from the MSW-FA. The present methodology is an interesting development in metal extraction from the MSW-BA and the MSW-FA, which can develop in a cost-effective and sustainable option to utilize MSW."
https://openalex.org/W3094620749,"Little is known about body size over the life-course and non-communicable disease risk in low- and middle-income country populations. Our study explored the role of body mass index (BMI) trajectories from infancy through mid-adulthood on cardio-metabolic disease (CMD) risk factors in a prospective cohort of Guatemalan adults. Study participants were born in Guatemala from 1962-77 and have been followed prospectively since participating in a nutrition supplementation trial as children. Sex-specific BMI latent class trajectories were derived using latent class growth modeling from up to 22 possible BMI values from age 1 month to 42 years measured between 1969 and 2004. CMD risk factors were assessed in 2015-17 (at age 37-54 years) using anthropometry, blood glucose and lipids, and blood pressure. We used logistic regression to assess the role of BMI trajectory on CMD risk factors in 510 women and 346 men (N = 856). We identified two BMI latent classes for women (low [n = 287, 56.3%] and high [n = 223, 43.7%]) and three classes for men (low [n = 141, 40.8%], medium [n = 160, 46.2%], and high [n = 45, 13.0%]). Given the small percentage of men in the high BMI latent class, we collapsed the medium and high BMI latent classes for men (n = 205, 59.1%). Among the most prevalent CMD risk factors at ages 37-54 years were abdominal obesity defined by waist-height ratio (99.6% of women and 87.3% of men), obesity defined by percent body fat (96.6% of women and 75.9% of men), low HDL-c (87.5% of women and 74.5% of men), and elevated triglycerides (78.3% of women and 73.6% of men). Except for obesity defined by BMI, we found no associations between BMI latent class and CMD risk factors in women. Among men, BMI latent class was not associated with CMD risk factors after controlling for current BMI. For the CMD risk factors we analyzed, the role of early life BMI on adult CMD appeared to be mediated by adult BMI among men-highlighting the need to establish and maintain healthy body weight over the life course."

While it is known that naïve antigen-specific CD4+ T cells can traffic to the genital tract in an antigen-specific manner, these T cells are not protective during primary infection. Here, we sought to compare the differences between memory and naïve antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in the same mouse following secondary infection using transgenic CD4+ T cells (NR1 T cells). Using RNA sequencing, we found that there were subtle but distinct differences between these two T cell populations. Naïve NR1 T cells significantly upregulated cell cycle genes and were more proliferative than memory NR1 T cells in the draining lymph node. In contrast, memory NR1 T cells were more activated than naïve NR1 T cells and were enriched in the genital tract. Together, our data provide insight into the differences between memory and naïve antigen-specific CD4+ T cells during C. trachomatis infection."
https://openalex.org/W3094252086,"Background Several factors including socio-economic and access to health facility influence burden of intestinal parasites. Epidemiological data from hard to reach areas will help to identify high-risk communities for targeted intervention. We, therefore, assessed the magnitude of intestinal parasites among Zay people residing in three islands of Lake Ziway in Ethiopia. Methods This cross-sectional survey was conducted in March 2013 on 444 individuals aged 6 months to 85 years. Stool samples were analyzed using wet mount and formol-ether concentration methods. Data were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaire and analyzed using STATA version 10. Results Among the study participants, 52% (321/444) were children under 15 years. While 72.8% were positive for at least one intestinal parasite, single, dual and triple infections were found in 42.1%, 23.9% and 6.3%, respectively. Four types of intestinal parasites were detected in two children. The commonest parasites were Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (51.4%), Schistosoma mansoni (17.8%), Giardia lamblia (14.4%), Trichuris trichiura (10.8%), Taenia species (5.6%), Hymenolopis nana (4.5%), Ascaris lumbricoides (4.1%), Entrobius vermicularis (0.9%), Hookworm (0.7%), and Strongyloides stercoralis (0.2%). Remarkable proportion of study participants (51.3%) had no latrine and >85% of the islanders use the lake water for drinking, cleaning or both. About 36% had no information about waterborne and related diseases, while 31% never heard about bilharziasis. Fishing and farming were the main source of income. In the multivariate model, being in the age group > 15 years (AOR = 0.49; 95%CI = 0.28–0.85) and not using lake water for drinking or washing (AOR = 0.52; 95%CI = 0.28–0.99) had protective effect, after adjusting for education, occupation and hand wash after latrine use. Conclusion The observed high rate of intestinal parasites (72.8%) in these hard to reach Islanders of Lake Ziway, warrants targeted and sustainable intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3094245110,"In this study, a novel fiber with slit-crescent-shaped cross-section is proposed to enhance the filtration performance of PM2.5 in fibrous filtration. The collection efficiency of this fiber is simulated by using a Brownian dynamics simulation technique, and its filtration pressure drop is obtained by numerically solving Navier-Stokes equation with Fluent software. A parametric study is performed to improve the optimum filtration performance of the slit-crescent-shaped fiber via adjusting its structural parameters (dimensionless center-to-center spacing and slit width). Results indicate that at the optimal condition, i.e., when dimensionless slit width ranges from 0.2 to 0.4, collection efficiency is enhanced by 13.1%–101.1% relative to the circular fiber for particles ranging from 0.1μm to 2.5μm for the slit-crescent-shaped fiber under various dimensionless center-to-center spacing, and filtration pressure drop is reduced by up to 14.4%. In addition, quality factor is introduced to evaluate the comprehensive filtration performance of the slit-crescent-shaped fiber with different structural parameters, and results show that large dimensionless slit width and small dimensionless center-to-center spacing lead to a much higher quality factor than the circular fiber, especially for particles lager than 0.5μm. The numerical results obtained in this work are conducive to designing high efficiency fibrous filters."
