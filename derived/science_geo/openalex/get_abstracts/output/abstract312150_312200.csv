I say this partly because depth of understanding and knowledge of subject matter enable a teacher to recognize unusual, nontextbook responses as valid and creative and to use them as teaching opportunities.

However, there is a gap in the logic that takes Datta from the hope that Ph.D. scientists will consider careers teaching grades kindergarten through 12 (K-12) to the concept that good teachers produce good students. A Ph.D. is trained primarily to do research; his or her teaching experience is typically limited to university undergraduates. While the subject matter for a university course is arguably more demanding than that for K-12, there are developmental issues in grades K-12 that are perhaps even more demanding. Readiness to learn, self-control, special needs, and English as a second language are a few of these."
