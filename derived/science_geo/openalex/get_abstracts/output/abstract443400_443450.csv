https://openalex.org/W2048323087,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, cognitive and psychiatric manifestations. Since the mutation responsible for the disease was identified as an unstable expansion of CAG repeats in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein in 1993, numerous mouse models of HD have been generated to study disease pathogenesis and evaluate potential therapeutic approaches. Of these, knock-in models best mimic the human condition from a genetic perspective since they express the mutation in the appropriate genetic and protein context. Behaviorally, however, while some abnormal phenotypes have been detected in knock-in mouse models, a model with an earlier and more robust phenotype than the existing models is required. We describe here for the first time a new mouse line, the zQ175 knock-in mouse, derived from a spontaneous expansion of the CAG copy number in our CAG 140 knock-in colony [1]. Given the inverse relationship typically observed between age of HD onset and length of CAG repeat, since this new mouse line carries a significantly higher CAG repeat length it was expected to be more significantly impaired than the parent line. Using a battery of behavioral tests we evaluated both heterozygous and homozygous zQ175 mice. Homozygous mice showed motor and grip strength abnormalities with an early onset (8 and 4 weeks of age, respectively), which were followed by deficits in rotarod and climbing activity at 30 weeks of age and by cognitive deficits at around 1 year of age. Of particular interest for translational work, we also found clear behavioral deficits in heterozygous mice from around 4.5 months of age, especially in the dark phase of the diurnal cycle. Decreased body weight was observed in both heterozygotes and homozygotes, along with significantly reduced survival in the homozygotes. In addition, we detected an early and significant decrease of striatal gene markers from 12 weeks of age. These data suggest that the zQ175 knock-in line could be a suitable model for the evaluation of therapeutic approaches and early events in the pathogenesis of HD."
https://openalex.org/W2073466689,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by severe behavioral, cognitive, and motor deficits. Since the discovery of the huntingtin gene (HTT) mutation that causes the disease, several mouse lines have been developed using different gene constructs of Htt. Recently, a new model, the zQ175 knock-in (KI) mouse, was developed (see description by Menalled et al, [1]) in an attempt to have the Htt gene in a context and causing a phenotype that more closely mimics HD in humans. Here we confirm the behavioral phenotypes reported by Menalled et al [1], and extend the characterization to include brain volumetry, striatal metabolite concentration, and early neurophysiological changes. The overall reproducibility of the behavioral phenotype across the two independent laboratories demonstrates the utility of this new model. Further, important features reminiscent of human HD pathology are observed in zQ175 mice: compared to wild-type neurons, electrophysiological recordings from acute brain slices reveal that medium spiny neurons from zQ175 mice display a progressive hyperexcitability; glutamatergic transmission in the striatum is severely attenuated; decreased striatal and cortical volumes from 3 and 4 months of age in homo- and heterozygous mice, respectively, with whole brain volumes only decreased in homozygotes. MR spectroscopy reveals decreased concentrations of N-acetylaspartate and increased concentrations of glutamine, taurine and creatine + phosphocreatine in the striatum of 12-month old homozygotes, the latter also measured in 12-month-old heterozygotes. Motor, behavioral, and cognitive deficits in homozygotes occur concurrently with the structural and metabolic changes observed. In sum, the zQ175 KI model has robust behavioral, electrophysiological, and histopathological features that may be valuable in both furthering our understanding of HD-like pathophyisology and the evaluation of potential therapeutic strategies to slow the progression of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2101481144,"Ceramide is a key intermediate in the pathway of sphingolipid biosynthesis and is an important intracellular messenger. We recently generated a ceramide synthase 2 (CerS2) null mouse that cannot synthesize very long acyl chain (C22-C24) ceramides. This mouse displays severe and progressive hepatopathy. Significant changes were observed in the sphingolipid profile of CerS2 null mouse liver, including elevated C16-ceramide and sphinganine levels in liver and in isolated mitochondrial fractions. Because ceramide may be involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, we examined whether ROS generation was affected in CerS2 null mice. Levels of a number of anti-oxidant enzymes were elevated, as were lipid peroxidation, protein nitrosylation, and ROS. ROS were generated from mitochondria due to impaired complex IV activity. C16-ceramide, sphingosine, and sphinganine directly inhibited complex IV activity in isolated mitochondria and in mitoplasts, whereas other ceramide species, sphingomyelin, and diacylglycerol were without effect. A fluorescent analog of sphinganine accumulated in mitochondria. Heart mitochondria did not display a substantial alteration in the sphingolipid profile or in complex IV activity. We suggest that C16-ceramide and/or sphinganine induce ROS formation through the modulation of mitochondrial complex IV activity, resulting in chronic oxidative stress.

We now analyze ROS production in CerS2 null mouse liver. ROS levels were elevated along with a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction was observed due to the impairment of complex IV activity by C16-ceramide and sphinganine. Our data are consistent with the notion that ceramides with defined acyl chain lengths impact down-stream signaling pathways in which ROS are involved. The following antibodies were used: anti-nitrotyrosine (Abcam), anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Millipore), anti-4-hydroxynonenal (HNE)-Michael adduct (Calbiochem), and goat anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated (HRP) secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). 4-Nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD)-sphinganine was from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL. WT and CerS2 null mice were maintained in a constant atmosphere under special pathogen-free conditions. Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Weizmann Institute of Science. Mice were sacrificed using CO2. Livers were harvested and transferred to either liquid nitrogen or a fixative agent. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, which included the addition of β-mercaptoethanol. cDNA synthesis was performed using a Verso cDNA kit (Thermo Scientific). RT-PCR was performed using a SYBR Green PCR reaction master mix (Finnzyme) and an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The primer concentration was 1 nm in a reaction volume of 20 μl. Each reaction was performed in duplicate. The thermal cycling parameters were as follows: step 1, 50 °C for 2 min; step 2, 95 °C for 10 min; step 3, 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min. Step 3 was repeated for 40 cycles and was followed by a dissociation step. The relative amounts of mRNA were calculated from the cyclic threshold values using hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) or TATA binding protein (TBP) for normalization. Normalization was assessed using geNorm software. Results are presented as mean of -fold -change of mRNA levels in experimental samples versus controls samples.

The spectrometer operates at 9.3–9.55 GHz and 20-milliwatt microwave. Ten minutes before collection of blood, mice were injected intravenously with 4-phosphono-oxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-hydroxyl (75 μg/kg). Blood was drawn from the heart under ketamine:xylazine anesthesia and measured immediately using glass capillaries. Livers were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 days and then embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections (4-μm thick) were deparaffinized, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by treating with 0.3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide and 0.5% (v/v) HCl in methanol for 30 min. Antigen retrieval was performed using 10 mm citric acid (pH 6.0) for 10 min. To reduce the nonspecific signal, sections were blocked using 20% (v/v) normal horse serum (Vector Laboratories) and 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 2 h. Sections were incubated with an anti-HNE-Michael adduct antibody at a dilution of 1:300 in 2% (v/v) normal horse serum and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. After several rinses in PBS, tissue sections were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated (HRP) secondary antibody at a 1:200 dilution in 2% (v/v) normal horse serum and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Peroxidase activity was detected by incubation with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine for 10 min. Sections were rinsed in distilled H2O, counterstained with hematoxylin, rinsed again under running tap water, and covered with coverslips using Entellan (Merck) as mounting agent. Lipid peroxidation in liver homogenates was determined by measuring levels of hydroxynonenal-histidine (HNE-His) protein adducts, which were quantified using the Oxiselect HNE-His Adduct ELISA kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc.). Protein samples were adsorbed onto a 96-well plate. HNE-protein adducts were probed with an anti-HNE-His antibody followed by an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Levels of HNE-protein adducts were determined using a standard curve prepared from a predetermined HNE-bovine serum albumin standard. Liver tissues were lysed in ∼6 volumes of PBS supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Tissues were homogenized by sonication. Protein was quantified using the BCA reagent (Pierce). Fifty μg of protein was electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific). Hepatocytes were isolated as described with some modifications (26Danial N.N. Gramm C.F.

Mice were perfused through the inferior vena cava with Hanks' buffered salt solution containing 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 0.4 mm EDTA preheated to 42 °C. Perfusion was performed using a peristaltic pump at a rate of 4 ml/min for 4 min. The buffer was immediately replaced with liver digest media (Invitrogen) preheated to 42 °C for 12 min. The liver was collected in 10 ml of plating medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 2% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.1 μm insulin). The liver was dissected using tweezers and passed through a cell strainer (70-μm nylon). Cells were centrifuged at 50 × gav (5 min, 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in 50% Percoll in plating medium. After centrifugation, dead cells were removed, and the pellet was washed twice using plating medium. Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/1.5 ml in collagen-coated 6-well plates. The hepatocytes anchored to the dishes within 2 h. Medium was replaced 2 h after plating with DMEM supplemented with 0.2% BSA, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 2% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 μm dexamethasone, and 1 nm insulin. Culture dishes were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator. In some experiments hepatocytes were incubated with ascorbic acid (4 mm) for 18 h. ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) were measured using 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) (Invitrogen) and 4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorescein (DAF-FM) (Invitrogen), respectively. Hepatocytes were incubated with 100 μm concentrations of either probe in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed 3 times and incubated with PBS for an additional 3 h. Cells were detached from the plates using trypsin-EDTA, centrifuged at 250 × gav for 5 min, and resuspended in PBS. Conversion of the non-fluorescent H2DCF-DA to DCF and DAF-FM to benzotriazole was monitored by FACS (BD Biosciences) at an excitation wavelength of 495 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. SL analyses by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry were conducted using a PE-Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and an ABI 4000 quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer (28Laviad E.L.

https://openalex.org/W2169711067,"Mast cells are hematopoietically-derived tissue immune cells that participate in acquired and innate immunity, as well as in inflammation through release of many chemokines and cytokines, especially in response to the pro-inflammatory peptide substance P (SP). Inflammation is critical in the pathogenesis of many diseases, but the trigger(s) is often unknown. We investigated if mast cell stimulation leads to secretion of mitochondrial components and whether these could elicit autocrine and/or paracrine inflammatory effects. Here we show that human LAD2 mast cells stimulated by IgE/anti-IgE or by the SP led to secretion of mitochondrial particles, mitochondrial (mt) mtDNA and ATP without cell death. Mitochondria purified fromLAD2 cells and, when mitochondria added to mast cells trigger degranulation and release of histamine, PGD2, IL-8, TNF, and IL-1β. This stimulatory effect is partially inhibited by an ATP receptor antagonist and by DNAse. These results suggest that the mitochondrial protein fraction may also contribute. Purified mitochondria also stimulate IL-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release from cultured human keratinocytes, and VEGF release from primary human microvascular endothelial cells. In order to investigate if mitochondrial components could be secreted in vivo, we injected rats intraperiotoneally (ip) with compound 48/80, which mimicks the action of SP. Peritoneal mast cells degranulated and mitochondrial particles were documented by transimission electron microscopy outside the cells. We also wished to investigate if mitochondrial components secreted locally could reach the systemic circulation. Administration ip of mtDNA isolated from LAD2 cells in rats was detected in their serum within 4 hr, indicating that extravascular mtDNA could enter the systemic circulation. Secretion of mitochondrial components from stimulated live mast cells may act as “autopathogens” contributing to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and may be used as targets for novel treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2058456997,"The anti-tumor antibiotic salinomycin (Sal) was recently identified as a selective inhibitor of breast cancer stem cells; however, the effect of Sal on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not clear. This study aimed to determine the anti-tumor efficacy and mechanism of Sal on HCC. HCC cell lines (HepG2, SMMC-7721, and BEL-7402) were treated with Sal. Cell doubling time was determinated by drawing growth curve, cell viability was evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit 8. The fraction of CD133+ cell subpopulations was assessed by flow cytometry. We found that Sal inhibits proliferation and decreases PCNA levels as well as the proportion of HCC CD133+cell subpopulations in HCC cells. Cell cycle was analyzed using flow cytometry and showed that Sal caused cell cycle arrest of the various HCC cell lines in different phases. Cell apoptosis was evaluated using flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 staining. Sal induced apoptosis as characterized by an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Several signaling pathways were selected for further mechanistic analyses using real time-PCR and Western blot assays. Compared to control, β-catenin expression is significantly down-regulated upon Sal addition. The Ca2+ concentration in HCC cells was examined by flow cytometry and higher Ca2+ concentrations were observed in Sal treatment groups. The anti-tumor effect of Sal was further verified in vivo using the hepatoma orthotopic tumor model and the data obtained showed that the size of liver tumors in Sal-treated groups decreased compared to controls. Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining also demonstrated that Sal inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in vivo. Finally, the role of Sal on in vivo Wnt/β-catenin signaling was evaluated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. This study demonstrates Sal inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo and one potential mechanism is inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling via increased intracellular Ca2+ levels."
https://openalex.org/W1977181196,"The Pseudomonas aeruginosa-containing wastewater released by hospitals is treated by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), generating sludge, which is used as a fertilizer, and effluent, which is discharged into rivers. We evaluated the risk of dissemination of antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa (AR-PA) from the hospital to the environment via the wastewater network. Over a 10-week period, we sampled weekly 11 points (hospital and urban wastewater, untreated and treated water, sludge) of the wastewater network and the river upstream and downstream of the WWTP of a city in eastern France. We quantified the P. aeruginosa load by colony counting. We determined the susceptibility to 16 antibiotics of 225 isolates, which we sorted into three categories (wild-type, antibiotic-resistant and multidrug-resistant). Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) were identified by gene sequencing. All non-wild-type isolates (n = 56) and a similar number of wild-type isolates (n = 54) were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. Almost all the samples (105/110, 95.5%) contained P. aeruginosa, with high loads in hospital wastewater and sludge (≥3×106 CFU/l or/kg). Most of the multidrug-resistant isolates belonged to ST235, CC111 and ST395. They were found in hospital wastewater and some produced ESBLs such as PER-1 and MBLs such as IMP-29. The WWTP greatly reduced P. aeruginosa counts in effluent, but the P. aeruginosa load in the river was nonetheless higher downstream than upstream from the WWTP. We conclude that the antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa released by hospitals is found in the water downstream from the WWTP and in sludge, constituting a potential risk of environmental contamination."

Disc degeneration was evaluated using the Pfirrmann grading system. Patients were followed up and low back pain was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) and the effect of back pain on the daily quality of life was assessed using Oswestry disability index (ODI).Forty-four cases had normal anatomical appearance (Modic type 0) and their Pfirrmann grades were 3.77±0.480 and their modified Pfirrmann grades were of 5.81±1.006. Twenty-seven cases had Modic type I changes and their Pfirrmann grades were 4.79±0.557 and their modified Pfirrmann grades were 7.00±0.832. Thirty-six cases exhibited Modic type II changes and their Pfirrmann grades and modified Pfirrmann grades were 4.11±0.398 and 6.64±0.867, respectively. One case had Modic type III changes. Kruskal-Wallis test revealed significant difference in modified Pfirrmann grade among Modic type 0, I and II changes (P<0.01) but no significant difference between Modic type I and II changes (P>0.05). Binary regression analysis showed that Modic changes correlated most strongly with disc degeneration. Follow up studies indicated that the VAS and ODI scores were markedly improved postoperatively. However, no difference was noted in VAS and ODI scores among patients with different Modic types.Modic changes correlate with the Pfirrmann and modified Pfirrmann grades of disc degeneration in lumbar degenerative disease. There is no significant correlation between Modic types and surgical outcomes."

Of particular interest is a pool of Aβ that accumulates intraneuronally and may contribute to neuronal toxicity. The mechanism for intraneuronal accumulation, however, is not well understood and is commonly attributed to impaired removal of extracellular Aβ by neurons. Based on the intracellular distribution of the well established Aβ degrading enzymes, ECE-1 and ECE-2, we tested whether impairments in their catalytic activity could lead to intracellular Aβ accumulation. Using SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing wild-type amyloid precursor protein and pharmacological inhibition of endogenous ECE activity, we found that ECEs participate in the degradation of at least two distinct pools of Aβ; one destined for secretion and the other being produced and degraded within the endosomal-autophagic-lysosomal pathways. Although ECE-1 regulates both pools of Aβ, ECE-2 regulates mainly the intracellular pool of the peptide. Consistent with this result, ECE-2 was found to co-localize with markers of the endosomal/lysosomal pathway but not with a trans-Golgi network marker. Furthermore, ECE-2 was detected in autophagic vesicles in cells treated with chloroquine. Under these conditions, ECE inhibition produced significantly higher elevations in intracellular Aβ than chloroquine treatment alone. This study highlights the existence of Aβ clearance mechanisms by ECEs at intracellular sites of production.

As in the case of extracellular Aβ (eAβ), the mechanism of iAβ accumulation is unknown. Based on the evidence that Aβ is constitutively secreted to the extracellular space following the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase and γ-secretase, it has been assumed that iAβ originates from internalization of secreted Aβ. However, the ultimate γ-secretase cleavage for the release of Aβ is largely conducted at the endosome (15.Small S.A. Gandy S. Sorting through the cell biology of Alzheimer's disease: intracellular pathways to pathogenesis.Neuron. 2006; 52: 15-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), thus requiring intracellular trafficking of Aβ before secretion. At the same time, Aβ-degrading enzymes are active in multiple compartments other than the lysosome and the extracellular space (16.Eckman E.A. Eckman C.B. Aβ-degrading enzymes: modulators of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and targets for therapeutic intervention.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1101-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). If Aβ degradation is an important contributor to the steady-state levels of Aβ before secretion it is then possible that iAβ could accumulate due to failure in Aβ catabolism. To date, several Aβ degrading enzymes have been shown to significantly contribute to Aβ homeostasis (17.Saido T. Leissring M.A. Proteolytic Degradation of Amyloid β-Protein.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2012; 2: a006379Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Numerous studies in vitro and in animal models support the physiological role of insulin-degrading enzyme, neprilysin (NEP), endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) and ECE-2, among others, in Aβ degradation (16.Eckman E.A. Eckman C.B. Aβ-degrading enzymes: modulators of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and targets for therapeutic intervention.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1101-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). NEP, ECE-1 and ECE-2 are members of the M13 family of metalloproteases, type II membrane-bound zinc metalloproteases sensitive to the inhibitor phosphoramidon (PA). ECE-1 and ECE-2, coded by different genes, are characterized by the ability to process big endothelin-1 into the potent vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (18.Turner A.J. Murphy L.J. Molecular pharmacology of endothelin converting enzymes.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Similar to NEP, ECE-1 and ECE-2 are expressed in areas relevant to AD (19.Pacheco-Quinto J. Herdt A. Eckman C.B. Eckman E.A. Endothelin-Converting Enzymes and Related Metalloproteases in Alzheimer's Disease.J. Alzheimers Dis. [Epub ahead of print]. 2012; Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and we have previously demonstrated that in ECE-1 and ECE-2 knock-out mice, there is an increase in endogenous levels of Aβ in brain (20.Eckman E.A. Watson M. Marlow L. Sambamurti K. Eckman C.B. Alzheimer's disease β-amyloid peptide is increased in mice deficient in endothelin-converting enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2081-2084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Although NEP is expressed predominantly on the plasma membrane, the ECE family is more broadly distributed. ECE-1 is composed of four isoforms that are located on the plasma membrane as well as in different intracellular compartments, including the secretory pathway, recycling endosomes, and late endosomes (21.Muller L. Barret A. Etienne E. Meidan R. Valdenaire O. Corvol P. Tougard C. Heterodimerization of endothelin-converting enzyme-1 isoforms regulates the subcellular distribution of this metalloprotease.J. Biol.

For ECE-2, all four isoforms are strictly intracellular, but their distribution has not yet been properly characterized. Based on the diverse intracellular distribution of the ECE family, we investigated how alterations in ECE activity could lead to iAβ accumulation in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells overexpressing wild-type APP as an in vitro neuronal model. cDNAs for human wild-type amyloid precursor protein (APP)695 (NM_201414.2), ECE-1a (NM_001113347.1), ECE-1b (NM_001397.2), ECE-1c (NM_001113348.1), ECE-1d (NM_001113349.1), ECE-2 variant 2 (NM_001037324.2), and ECE-2 variant 5 (NM_001100121.1) were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). ECE-2 variants 2 and 5 have shown to be preferentially expressed in brain (22.Ikeda S. Emoto N. Alimsardjono H. Yokoyama M. Matsuo M. Molecular isolation and characterization of novel four subisoforms of ECE-2.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Variants 2 and 5 were used for transfection of CHO cells. Variant 2 was used for studies in SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing wild-type human APP695 were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and the selective antibiotic geneticin at 400 μg/ml (Invitrogen). Cells were routinely passed by trypsinization. The same medium and maintenance protocol was followed for growing CHO cells. For measurement of Aβ by ELISA, medium and cell extracts were obtained from growing cells at 70–80% confluency in 12-well plates with 500 μl of medium. For transient SH-SY5Y transfection, the “nanojuice” reagent (EMD Chemicals) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions; a booster:DNA ratio of 2:1 was added to DMEM with 10% FBS containing no antibiotics, and cells were incubated for 72 h prior to any assay. Cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer (PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and proteinase inhibitors) and protein homogenates were resolved in Novex® 10–20% Tris-tricine gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. For protein detection, membranes were blocked for 1 h with 10% normal goat serum and incubated with the corresponding primary antibody. Bound antibody was detected with ECL reagents (Millipore) following incubation with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Signal was digitally recorded with the ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare). Cells were fixed with cold methanol at −20 °C for 10 min. As blocking reagent, 5% BSA containing 0.1% Tween 20 was used. Following incubation with primary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 488 and 546-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for visualization under a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 fluorescent microscope. Levels of Aβ1–40 were measured from conditioned medium and Triton X-100 cell extracts using a highly specific sandwich ELISA. The 33.1.1 antibody against the N-terminal region of the peptide was used for capture and the HRP-conjugated 40-specific antibody, 13.1.1, was used for detection.

To define the contribution of ECE activity to iAβ degradation, SH-SY5Y-APP cells expressing endogenous levels of ECEs were treated with 100 μm PA for 48 h, and levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were measured by ELISA in medium and cell extracts. Similar to previous studies (26.Fuller S.J. Storey E. Li Q.X. Smith A.I. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L.

In the same manner, in cell extracts, PA treatment also produced significant elevations in iAβ40 and iAβ42 (Fig. 1, C and D). Demonstrating iAβ accumulation is particularly challenging due to cross-reactivity of specific Aβ antibodies with APP or cleavage products of APP that contain a portion of, or the full Aβ sequence. To define the specificity of the iAβ measurements by our ELISA system, cells were treated with the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT to stop Aβ production and increase intracellular accumulation of C-terminal fragments (CTFS) (28.Dovey H.F.

Functional γ-secretase inhibitors reduce β-amyloid peptide levels in brain.J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1, A and B, levels of eAβ40 and eAβ42 after a 48-h treatment with 100 μm DAPT or PA + DAPT were nearly undetectable. For iAβ analysis in the absence of PA, Aβ40 and Aβ42 measurements were similar with and without DAPT treatment (Fig. 1, C and D), indicating a significant background signal in the cell extracts that is not due to Aβ or CTFs. Importantly, the significant increases in iAβ40 and iAβ42 measured in cells treated with PA were completely blocked by treatment with DAPT, confirming that PA produces iAβ40 and iAβ42 accumulation. As additional confirmation of PA-mediated iAβ accumulation, we repeated the experiments with the CNS-derived H4 cell line transfected with wild-type APP (29.Haugabook S.J. Yager D.M. Eckman E.A. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Eckman C.B. High throughput screens for the identification of compounds that alter the accumulation of the Alzheimer's amyloid β peptide (Aβ).J. Neurosci. Methods. 2001; 108: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similar to the results obtained with SH-SY5Y-APP cells, treatment of H4-APP cells with 100 μm PA for 48 h produced significant increases in both eAβ and iAβ levels (Fig. 1, E and F). Interestingly, H4-APP cells secrete substantially less Aβ than SH-SY5Y-APP cells and only 4-fold higher than wild-type SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown), and yet H4 cells treated with PA accumulated intracellular Aβ at levels greater than SH-SY5Y-APP cells. To verify that the Aβ accumulation was due to impaired degradation rather than increased production, we analyzed by Western blot the levels of full-length APP and CTFs, as a measure of secretase activity. Western blot results using a C-terminal APP antibody showed that APP was preferentially processed by α-secretase, as seen by higher levels of CTF-α than CTF-β and that PA did not alter APP processing (Fig. 2B). As expected, in cells treated with DAPT, we detected a significant increase in the levels of CTFs. This increase was not affected by PA treatment. Also, by immunocytochemistry, we observed that PA treatment did not alter APP distribution in the cell (Fig. 2A), a potential cause for altered Aβ levels (15.Small S.A. Gandy S. Sorting through the cell biology of Alzheimer's disease: intracellular pathways to pathogenesis.Neuron. 2006; 52: 15-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Using N-terminal Aβ antibody 33.1.1 (the capture antibody for our ELISA system), we verified iAβ accumulation by immunocytochemistry. In PA-treated cells, immunoreactivity with a punctuated pattern was detected in the cell body and surrounding the nuclei (Fig. 2A), whereas in control cells, only faint intracellular staining was observed. Finally, the accumulation of Aβ in cell extracts, detected by sandwich ELISA (Fig. 1), and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 2A) was further confirmed by Western blot using either Aβ1–16 antibody 33.1.1 or Aβ17–24 antibody 4G8. A 4-kDa immunoreactive band was detected in extracts from SH-SY5Y-APP cells treated with PA (Fig. 2C). This band was completely absent in extracts of cells co-treated with PA and DAPT. PA inhibits the activity of members of the NEP and ECE families and, less potently, angiotensin-converting enzyme (30.Kukkola P.J. Savage P. Sakane Y. Berry J.C. Bilci N.A. Ghai R.D. Jeng A.Y.

Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: S65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, to differentiate the contribution of the NEP and ECE family members to iAβ removal, we tested the effect of a more selective ECE inhibitor, CGS 35066 (31.Jeng A.Y. De Lombaert S. Beil M.E. Bruseo C.W. Savage P. Chou M. Trapani A.J. Design and synthesis of a potent and selective endothelin-converting enzyme inhibitor, CGS 35066.J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2000; 36: S36-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, a 24-h treatment with CGS 35066 increased the levels of both iAβ and eAβ in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal effects similar to that of PA. In contrast, with the potent NEP inhibitor thiorphan, we found no significant increase in either iAβ or eAβ at doses up to 10 μm after 48 h. These results indicate that NEP and other thiorphan/PA-sensitive proteases do not have a major role in Aβ degradation in our cellular model, consistent with previous reports showing that NEP is poorly expressed in SH-SY5Y cells (32.Belyaev N.D. Nalivaeva N.N. Makova N.Z. Turner A.J. Neprilysin gene expression requires binding of the amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain to its promoter: implications for Alzheimer disease.EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Increased levels of Aβ by PA are likely due to specific inhibition of ECE family members (33.Eckman E.A. Adams S.K. Troendle F.J. Stodola B.A. Kahn M.A. Fauq A.H. Xiao H.D. Bernstein K.E. Eckman C.B. Regulation of steady-state β-amyloid levels in the brain by neprilysin and endothelin-converting enzyme but not angiotensin-converting enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30471-30478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), although we cannot completely rule out the presence of an unidentified ECE-like enzyme. There is no clear understanding of the origin and mechanism of iAβ accumulation in neurons. One possibility is an overloading of the mechanism of eAβ removal via endocytosis. Another possibility is that Aβ accumulates due to dysfunction in an undefined step prior to secretion. To study whether PA was inhibiting the degradation of endocytosed Aβ, we treated empty vector-transfected SH-SY5Y cells with Aβ at levels similar to those secreted by SH-SY5Y-APP cells treated with PA. If iAβ originates from internalization of the extracellular pool, incubation with this amount of exogenous Aβ should produce increases in iAβ similar to those observed in SH-SY5Y-APP cells treated with PA. Fig. 4 shows the results of 48 h of treatment with 5 nm Aβ and 100 μm PA. Levels of eAβ and iAβ were measured soon after Aβ addition and again after 48 h. Aβ measurement after the 48-h incubation period showed a dramatic decrease in the level of exogenous Aβ in the presence or absence of PA, indicating internalization or nearly complete degradation by proteases insensitive to PA. Levels of iAβ were measured to determine whether the peptide had been internalized and accumulated within the cell. There was no increase in iAβ accumulation following treatment with 5 nm Aβ, suggesting that if SH-SY5Y cells endocytose Aβ (34.Ida N. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K.

Frieden C. Pappu R.V. Lee J.M. Amyloid seeds formed by cellular uptake, concentration, and aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 20324-20329Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), any internalized peptide is degraded by non-PA sensitive proteases. The intracellular location of members of the ECE family coincides with compartments where CTF-β is cleaved by γ-secretase to release Aβ (see “Discussion”). Thus, we tested whether iAβ accumulated in Aβ-producing compartments. Immunostaining with an antibody against the C terminus of APP revealed a punctuated staining pattern that was not seen with an N-terminal APP antibody (not shown) and co-localized with iAβ (Fig. 5). Also, the punctuated iAβ staining localized with rab7-positive compartments (marker for late endosome), suggesting that iAβ is degraded at the site of production within the late endosome. ECE-2 has not been as thoroughly investigated as ECE-1. Based on its low pH optimum (5–5.5) and substrate affinities similar to those of ECE-1, it has been postulated that ECE-2 resides in the TGN (36.Emoto N. Yanagisawa M. Endothelin-converting enzyme-2 is a membrane-bound, phosphoramidon-sensitive metalloprotease with acidic pH optimum.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15262-15268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). However, this has not been demonstrated convincingly. We confirmed by RT-PCR that SH-SY5Y cells and H4 cells express ECE-2 (data not shown), but endogenous levels of the protein were only weakly detected with commercially available antibodies. Therefore, we evaluated the cellular localization of the enzyme in transfected cells by immunocytochemistry. We observed that in ECE-2 overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells, ECE-2 partially co-localized with rab5 (early endosomal marker), rab7, and LAMP-1 (lysosomal marker) but not with TGN38 (TGN marker) (Fig. 6). Results suggest that ECE-2 Aβ-degrading activity appears restricted to the endosomal/lysosomal pathway and not the secretory pathway in neuronal cells. Based on the results above and published evidence showing that ECE-1b is also expressed in late endosomes (21.Muller L. Barret A. Etienne E. Meidan R. Valdenaire O. Corvol P. Tougard C. Heterodimerization of endothelin-converting enzyme-1 isoforms regulates the subcellular distribution of this metalloprotease.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we next studied whether ECE-2 and ECE-1b directly participate in iAβ degradation. SH-SY5Y-APP cells were transiently transfected with either enzyme prior to incubation with PA. The relative inefficiency of transfection in this cell line permits the comparison of Aβ accumulation within ECE-overexpressing cells and neighboring non-transfected cells. First, we observed that both ECE-1b and ECE-2 partially co-localized with APP and/or APP CTFs (Fig. 7). In addition, in SH-SY5Y-APP cells treated with PA, overexpression of either ECE-2 or ECE-1b dramatically lowered accumulation of iAβ (expressed as the average number of Aβ-positive granules per cell) as compared with surrounding non-ECE transfected cells (Fig. 8, A and B). Even though these cells were treated with PA, we suspect that intracellular ECE activity was not completely inhibited in the overexpressing cells. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that reductions in extracellular Aβ concentration in ECE-1-transfected CHO cells are not reversed 100% by PA treatment at the concentration u"

https://openalex.org/W2026072716,"Orphan receptor Nurr1 participates in the acquisition and maintenance of the dopaminergic cell phenotype, modulation of inflammation, and cytoprotection, but little is known about its regulation. In this study, we report that Nurr1 contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) within its DNA binding domain and two leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NES) in its ligand binding domain. Together, these signals regulate Nurr1 shuttling in and out of the nucleus. Immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis revealed that Nurr1 is mostly nuclear. A Nurr1 mutant lacking the NLS failed to enter the nucleus. The Nurr1 NLS sequence, when fused to green fluorescent protein, led to nuclear accumulation of this chimeric protein, indicating that this sequence was sufficient to direct nuclear localization of Nurr1. Furthermore, two NES were characterized in the ligand binding domain, whose deletion caused Nurr1 to accumulate predominantly in the nucleus. The Nurr1 NES was sensitive to CRM1 and could function as an independent export signal when fused to green fluorescent protein. Sodium arsenite, an agent that induces oxidative stress, promoted nuclear export of ectopically expressed Nurr1 in HEK293T cells, and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine rescued from this effect. Similarly, in dopaminergic MN9D cells, arsenite induced the export of endogenous Nurr1, resulting in the loss of expression of Nurr1-dependent genes. This study illustrates that Nurr1 shuttling between the cytosol and nucleus is controlled by specific nuclear import and export signals and that oxidative stress can unbalance the distribution of Nurr1 to favor its cytosolic accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2054179167,"DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are formed when cells are exposed to various DNA-damaging agents. Because DPCs are extremely large, steric hindrance conferred by DPCs is likely to affect many aspects of DNA transactions. In DNA replication, DPCs are first encountered by the replicative helicase that moves at the head of the replisome. However, little is known about how replicative helicases respond to covalently immobilized protein roadblocks. In the present study we elucidated the effect of DPCs on the DNA unwinding reaction of hexameric replicative helicases in vitro using defined DPC substrates. DPCs on the translocating strand but not on the nontranslocating strand impeded the progression of the helicases including the phage T7 gene 4 protein, simian virus 40 large T antigen, Escherichia coli DnaB protein, and human minichromosome maintenance Mcm467 subcomplex. The impediment varied with the size of the cross-linked proteins, with a threshold size for clearance of 5.0-14.1 kDa. These results indicate that the central channel of the dynamically translocating hexameric ring helicases can accommodate only small proteins and that all of the helicases tested use the steric exclusion mechanism to unwind duplex DNA. These results further suggest that DPCs on the translocating and nontranslocating strands constitute helicase and polymerase blocks, respectively. The helicases stalled by DPC had limited stability and dissociated from DNA with a half-life of 15-36 min. The implications of the results are discussed in relation to the distinct stabilities of replisomes that encounter tight but reversible DNA-protein complexes and irreversible DPC roadblocks."
https://openalex.org/W1979710854,"Mitochondrial oxidative stress significantly contributes to the underlying pathology of several devastating neurodegenerative disorders. Mitochondria are highly sensitive to the damaging effects of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species; therefore, these organelles are equipped with a number of free radical scavenging systems. In particular, the mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) pool is a critical antioxidant reserve that is derived entirely from the larger cytosolic pool via facilitated transport. The mechanism of mitochondrial GSH transport has not been extensively studied in the brain. However, the dicarboxylate (DIC) and 2-oxoglutarate (OGC) carriers localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane have been established as GSH transporters in liver and kidney. Here, we investigated the role of these carriers in protecting neurons from oxidative and nitrosative stress. Immunoblot analysis of DIC and OGC in primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) and cerebellar astrocytes showed differential expression of these carriers, with CGNs expressing only DIC and astrocytes expressing both DIC and OGC. Consistent with these findings, butylmalonate specifically reduced mitochondrial GSH in CGNs, whereas both butylmalonate and phenylsuccinate diminished mitochondrial GSH in astrocytes. Moreover, preincubation with butylmalonate but not phenylsuccinate significantly enhanced susceptibility of CGNs to oxidative and nitrosative stressors. This increased vulnerability was largely prevented by incubation with cell-permeable GSH monoethylester but not malate. Finally, knockdown of DIC with adenoviral siRNA also rendered CGNs more susceptible to oxidative stress. These findings demonstrate that maintenance of the mitochondrial GSH pool via sustained mitochondrial GSH transport is essential to protect neurons from oxidative and nitrosative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2963598015,"The brain's structural and functional systems, protein-protein interaction, and gene networks are examples of biological systems that share some features of complex networks, such as highly connected nodes, modularity, and small-world topology. Recent studies indicate that some pathologies present topological network alterations relative to norms seen in the general population. Therefore, methods to discriminate the processes that generate the different classes of networks (e.g., normal and disease) might be crucial for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of the disease. It is known that several topological properties of a network (graph) can be described by the distribution of the spectrum of its adjacency matrix. Moreover, large networks generated by the same random process have the same spectrum distribution, allowing us to use it as a “fingerprint”. Based on this relationship, we introduce and propose the entropy of a graph spectrum to measure the “uncertainty” of a random graph and the Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergences between graph spectra to compare networks. We also introduce general methods for model selection and network model parameter estimation, as well as a statistical procedure to test the nullity of divergence between two classes of complex networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods by applying them to (1) protein-protein interaction networks of different species and (2) on networks derived from children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and typically developing children. We conclude that scale-free networks best describe all the protein-protein interactions. Also, we show that our proposed measures succeeded in the identification of topological changes in the network while other commonly used measures (number of edges, clustering coefficient, average path length) failed."

Methodology/Principal Findings To research our hypothesis, we studied the 21 UV filters both available on the market and authorized by European regulations and subjected these filters to the phorbol-myristate-acetate test using mice. We then catalogued the 13 filters demonstrating a significant anti-inflammatory effect with edema inhibition percentages of more than 70%. The filters are: diethylhexyl butamido triazone (92%), benzophenone-5 and titanium dioxide (90%), benzophenone-3 (83%), octocrylène and isoamyl p-methoxycinnamate (82%), PEG-25 PABA and homosalate (80%), octyl triazone and phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid (78%), octyl dimethyl PABA (75%), bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine and diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexylbenzoate (70%). These filters were tested at various concentrations, including their maximum authorized dose. We detected a dose-response relationship.

But there is no clear instruction on which markers should be used at which stage of dementia. This study aimed to first investigate associations of the CSF markers as well as volumes and shapes of the hippocampus and lateral ventricles with MCI and AD at the baseline and secondly apply these baseline markers to predict MCI conversion in a two-year time using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results suggested that the CSF markers, including Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau, distinguished MCI or AD from NC, while the Aβ42 CSF marker contributed to the differentiation between MCI and AD. The hippocampal shapes performed better than the hippocampal volumes in classifying NC and MCI, NC and AD, as well as MCI and AD. Interestingly, the ventricular volumes were better than the ventricular shapes to distinguish MCI or AD from NC, while the ventricular shapes showed better accuracy than the ventricular volumes in classifying MCI and AD. As the CSF markers and the structural markers are complementary, the combination of them showed great improvements in the classification accuracies of MCI and AD. Moreover, the combination of these markers showed high sensitivity but low specificity for predicting conversion from MCI to AD in two years. Hence, it is feasible to employ a cross-sectional sample to investigate dynamic associations of the CSF and imaging markers with MCI and AD and to predict future MCI conversion. In particular, the volumetric information may be good for the early stage of AD, while morphological shapes should be considered as markers in the prediction of MCI conversion to AD together with the CSF markers."
https://openalex.org/W2001471250,"The liver responds to fasting-refeeding cycles by reprogramming expression of metabolic genes. Fasting potently induces one of the key hepatic hormones, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), to promote lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and ketogenesis, whereas refeeding suppresses its expression. We previously reported that the basic leucine zipper transcription factor E4BP4 (E4 binding protein 4) represses Fgf21 expression and disrupts its circadian oscillations in cultured hepatocytes. However, the epigenetic mechanism for E4BP4-dependent suppression of Fgf21 has not yet been addressed. Here we present evidence that histone methyltransferase G9a mediates E4BP4-dependent repression of Fgf21 during refeeding by promoting repressive histone modification. We find that Fgf21 expression is up-regulated in E4bp4 knock-out mouse liver. We demonstrate that the G9a-specific inhibitor BIX01294 abolishes suppression of the Fgf21 promoter activity by E4BP4, whereas overexpression of E4bp4 leads to increased levels of dimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) around the Fgf21 promoter region. Furthermore, we also show that E4BP4 interacts with G9a, and knockdown of G9a blocks repression of Fgf21 promoter activity and expression in cells overexpressing E4bp4. A G9a mutant lacking catalytic activity, due to deletion of the SET domain, fails to inhibit the Fgf21 promoter activity. Importantly, acute hepatic knockdown by adenoviral shRNA targeting G9a abolishes Fgf21 repression by refeeding, concomitant with decreased levels of H3K9me2 around the Fgf21 promoter region. In summary, we show that G9a mediates E4BP4-dependent suppression of hepatic Fgf21 by enhancing histone methylation (H3K9me2) of the Fgf21 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1993579836,"Members of the ETS transcription factor family often target the same binding regions and hence have the potential to regulate the same genes and downstream biological processes. However, individual family members also preferentially bind to other genomic regions, thus providing the potential for controlling distinct transcriptional programmes and generating specific biological effects. The ETS transcription factor ELK1 controls cell migration in breast epithelial cells through targeting a cohort of genes, independently from another family member GABPA, and therefore achieves biological specificity. Here, we demonstrate that GABPA also controls cell migration in breast epithelial cells. However, GABPA controls the expression of a different network of target genes to ELK1. Both direct and indirect target genes for GABPA are identified and amongst the direct targets we confirm the importance of RAC1 and KIF20A for cell migration. Therefore, although ELK1 and GABPA ultimately control the same biological process, they do so by regulating different cohorts of target genes associated with cytoskeletal functions and cell migration control."
https://openalex.org/W2026411958,"Background The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) on the cell surface transmits inflammatory signals. A member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, RAGE possesses the V, C1, and C2 ectodomains that collectively constitute the receptor's extracellular structure. However, the molecular mechanism of RAGE biogenesis remains unclear, impeding efforts to control RAGE signaling through cellular regulation. Methodology and Result We used co-immunoprecipitation and crossing-linking to study RAGE oligomerization and found that RAGE forms dimer-based oligomers. Via non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mutagenesis, we found that cysteines 259 and 301 within the C2 domain form intermolecular disulfide bonds. Using a modified tripartite split GFP complementation strategy and confocal microscopy, we also found that RAGE dimerization occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and that RAGE mutant molecules without the double disulfide bridges are unstable, and are subjected to the ER-associated degradation. Conclusion Disulfide bond-mediated RAGE dimerization in the ER is the critical step of RAGE biogenesis. Without formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds in the C2 region, RAGE fails to reach cell surface. Significance This is the first report of RAGE intermolecular disulfide bond."
https://openalex.org/W2028086687,"Smoking causes endothelial dysfunction and systemic microvascular disease with resultant end-organ damage in the kidneys, eyes and heart. Little is known about microvascular changes in smoking-related lung disease. We tested if microvascular changes in the retina, kidneys and heart were associated with obstructive spirometry and low lung density on computed tomography. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis recruited participants age 45–84 years without clinical cardiovascular disease. Measures of microvascular function included retinal arteriolar and venular caliber, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and, in a subset, myocardial blood flow on magnetic resonance imaging. Spirometry was measured following ATS/ERS guidelines. Low attenuation areas (LAA) were measured on lung fields of cardiac computed tomograms. Regression models adjusted for pulmonary and cardiac risk factors, medications and body size. Among 3,397 participants, retinal venular caliber was inversely associated with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (P<0.001) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio (P = 0.04). Albumin-to-creatinine ratio was inversely associated with FEV1 (P = 0.002) but not FEV1/FVC. Myocardial blood flow (n = 126) was associated with lower FEV1 (P = 0.02), lower FEV1/FVC (P = 0.001) and greater percentage LAA (P = 0.04). Associations were of greater magnitude among smokers. Low lung function was associated with microvascular changes in the retina, kidneys and heart, and low lung density was associated with impaired myocardial microvascular perfusion. These cross-sectional results suggest that microvascular damage with end-organ dysfunction in all circulations may pertain to the lung, that lung dysfunction may contribute to systemic microvascular disease, or that there may be a shared predisposition."
https://openalex.org/W2091024895,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. To date, improvements in hormonal and cytotoxic therapies have not yet led to a sustained remission or cure. In the present study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities of a novel Calotropis procera protein (CP-P) isolated from root bark. CP-P protein inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the suppression of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kB) activation. CP-P, when administered individually or in combination with cyclophosphamide (CYC, 0.2 mg/kg) to rats with 7, 12-dimethyl benz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced breast cancer decreased tumor volume significantly without affecting the body weight. To elucidate the anticancer mechanism of CP-P, antioxidant activities such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and non-enzymatic antioxidant - reduced glutathione (GSH), vitamin E and C generation in the breast were analyzed by various assays. SOD, CAT, GST, GSH, vitamin E and C levels were high in combination-treated groups (CP-P+CYC) versus the CYC alone-treated groups. Also, the combination was more effective in down-regulating the expression of NF-kB-regulated gene products (cyclin D1 and Bcl-2) in breast tumor tissues. Our findings indicate that CP-P possesses significant antitumor activity comparable to a commonly used anticancer drug, cyclophosphamide, and may form the basis of a novel therapy for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2111387245,"Background Robust evidence on interventions to improve the shortage of health workers in rural areas is needed. We assessed stated factors that would attract short-term contract nurses and midwives to work in a rural area of Peru. Methods and Findings A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted to evaluate the job preferences of nurses and midwives currently working on a short-term contract in the public sector in Ayacucho, Peru. Job attributes, and their levels, were based on literature review, qualitative interviews and focus groups of local health personnel and policy makers. A labelled design with two choices, rural community or Ayacucho city, was used. Job attributes were tailored to these settings. Multiple conditional logistic regressions were used to assess the determinants of job preferences. Then we used the best-fitting estimated model to predict the impact of potential policy incentives on the probability of choosing a rural job or a job in Ayacucho city. We studied 205 nurses and midwives. The odds of choosing an urban post was 14.74 times than that of choosing a rural one. Salary increase, health center-type of facility and scholarship for specialization were preferred attributes for choosing a rural job. Increased number of years before securing a permanent contract acted as a disincentive for both rural and urban jobs. Policy simulations showed that the most effective attraction package to uptake a rural job included a 75% increase in salary plus scholarship for a specialization, which would increase the proportion of health workers taking a rural job from 36.4% up to 60%. Conclusions Urban jobs were more strongly preferred than rural ones. However, combined financial and non-financial incentives could almost double rural job uptake by nurses and midwifes. These packages may provide meaningful attraction strategies to rural areas and should be considered by policy makers for implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2038841445,"Gene expression in trypanosomes is mainly regulated post-transcriptionally. Genes are transcribed as polycistronic mRNAs that are dissected by the concerted action of trans-splicing and polyadenylation. In trans-splicing, a common exon, the spliced leader, is added to all mRNAs from a small RNA. In this study, we examined by microarray analysis the transcriptome following RNAi silencing of the basal splicing factors U2AF65, SF1, and U2AF35. The transcriptome data revealed correlations between the affected genes and their splicing and polyadenylation signaling properties, suggesting that differential binding of these factors to pre-mRNA regulates trans-splicing and hence expression of specific genes. Surprisingly, all these factors were shown to affect not only splicing but also mRNA stability. Affinity purification of SF1 and U2AF35 complexes supported their role in mRNA stability. U2AF35 but not SF1 was shown to bind to ribosomes. To examine the role of splicing factors in mRNA stability, mutations were introduced into the polypyrimidine tract located in the 3' UTR of a mini-gene, and the results demonstrate that U2AF65 binds to such a site and controls the mRNA stability. We propose that transcripts carrying splicing signals in their 3' UTR bind the splicing factors and control their stability."
https://openalex.org/W2050452142,"Precise transcription by cellular RNA polymerase requires the efficient removal of noncognate nucleotide residues that are occasionally incorporated. Mis-incorporation causes the transcription elongation complex to backtrack, releasing a single strand 3′-RNA segment bearing a noncognate residue, which is hydrolyzed by the active center that carries two Mg2+ ions. However, in most x-ray structures only one Mg2+ is present. This Mg2+ is tightly bound to the active center aspartates, creating an inactive stable state. The first residue of the single strand RNA segment in the backtracked transcription elongation complex strongly promotes transcript hydrolytic cleavage by establishing a network of interactions that force a shift of stably bound Mg2+ to release some of its aspartate coordination valences for binding to the second Mg2+ thus enabling catalysis. Such a rearrangement that we call active center tuning (ACT) occurs when all recognition contacts of the active center-bound RNA segment are established and verified by tolerance to stress. Transcription factor Gre builds on the ACT mechanism in the same reaction by increasing the retention of the second Mg2+ and by activating the attacking water, causing 3000–4000-fold reaction acceleration and strongly reinforcing proofreading.

The unified mechanism for RNA synthesis and degradation by RNA polymerase predicts that ACT also executes NTP selection thereby contributing to high transcription fidelity. Transcription of DNA by RNA polymerase (RNAP)3 is a highly accurate templated synthesis. The fidelity of transcription relies on both efficient initial substrate selection and on proofreading that removes mis-incorporated residues. Addition of each nucleotide by RNAP yields two principal states (Fig. 1A) such that the enzyme moves forward along the DNA template from the pretranslocated state (I) to the post-translocated state (II), which vacates the active center for the next NTP substrate. The enzyme can also backtrack (state III), which releases the 3′-RNA segment from the RNA/DNA hybrid. Backtracking is strongly promoted when noncognate nucleotide residues are incorporated. The disengaged single strand RNA segment in a backtracked complex can be removed by RNAP in its endonucleolytic mode (1Surratt C.K. Milan S.C. Chamberlin M.

A mechanism for all polymerases.Nature. 1998; 391: 231-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) relies on two Mg2+ ions coordinated by the aspartate triad (β′Asp-460, β′Asp-462, and β′Asp-464) of the active center (Fig. 1B). One of the Mg2+ ions (Mg-I) is coordinated by all three Asp residues, whereas the second Mg2+ ion (Mg-II) is coordinated by only two residues (Asp-460 and Asp-462). The latter are called “bridging” because they connect both Mg2+ ions. During RNA synthesis (Fig. 1B, left panel), Mg-I activates the 3′-attacking hydroxyl of the terminal RNA residue and the α-phosphate of an NTP substrate for nucleophilic attack; Mg-II facilitates release of pyrophosphate. In RNA hydrolytic cleavage (Fig. 1B, right panel), Mg2+ ions switch their role. In this reaction Mg-II activates the attacking water, whereas Mg-I promotes release of the leaving group. One of the ions (Mg-I) is bound with high affinity and the other (Mg-II) with low affinity and has to be stabilized by additional coordination with the following: (i) two terminal phosphates of incoming NTP in polymerization reaction; (ii) the same phosphates of NTP bound to an E site (which is believed to be involved in substrate loading (3Sosunov V.

In the majority of x-ray structures of multisubunit RNAP, only one Mg2+ ion (Mg-I) is seen bound to all three aspartates of the active center. According to quantum mechanics calculations (23Zhu R. Janetzko F. Zhang Y. van Duin A.C.T. Goddard 3rd, W.A. Salahub D.R. Characterization of the active center of yeast RNA polymerase II by DFT and ReaxFF calculations.Theor. Chem. Account. 2008; 120: 479-489Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), this Mg2+ ion forms strong coordination bonds with the aspartates, which makes this state stable. However, all reactions of RNAP require two Mg2+ ions for catalysis, suggesting that this inactive stable state has to be tuned to a catalytically proficient state by inclusion of the second Mg2+ ion. To achieve this, Mg-I must be pushed aside to free the coordination valences of the bridging Asp residues so they can bind Mg-II for catalysis (Fig. 1C). The rearrangement involves repositioning of all three Asp side chains and a drastic change in Mg-I coordination geometry, causing rotation of the bridging aspartates to co-linear orientation (Fig. 1C, right panel). This assumption finds support in recently resolved x-ray structures (3GTG and 3PO3 (24Wang D. Bushnell D.A. Huang X. Westover K.D. Levitt M. Kornberg R.D.

Structural basis of RNA polymerase II backtracking, arrest and reactivation.Nature. 2011; 471: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar)) of TEC in which endonuclease reaction occurs. Analysis of these structures and our biochemical data show that the above rearrangement of the active center can be promoted by the recognition contacts of substrates in both RNA hydrolytic proofreading and RNA polymerization reactions. It is this rearrangement that we refer to herein as active center tuning (ACT). Biochemical analysis of intrinsic endonuclease transcript cleavage in RNAP from yeast, mammals, eubacteria, and thermophilic bacteria revealed species-specific reaction features suggesting considerable differences in the reaction mechanism that have to be explained structurally. The examples are unusually high reaction efficacy in thermophiles (26Hogan B.P. Hartsch T. Erie D.A. Transcript cleavage by Thermus thermophilus RNA polymerase. Effects of GreA and anti-GreA factors.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 967-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the existence of specific endopyrophosphorolytic reaction pathway in pol II of yeast and mammals (27Rudd M.D. Izban M.G. Luse D.S. The active site of RNA polymerase II participates in transcript cleavage within arrested ternary complexes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 8057-8061Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) not seen in bacteria. Exploring the mechanism of endonuclease reaction in Escherichia coli, we find that although consistent with biochemical data obtained on yeast RNAP the x-ray model had to be adjusted for E. coli RNAP to fit the experimental data. This was achieved by placing the nucleoside part of the 3′-disengaged +2 RNA residues into a cavity of the active center on the interface of β and β′ subunits (which we named B site, for base binding), while preserving the orientation of the phosphodiester group seen in x-ray structure 3GTG (Fig. 2). The resulting structural model combined with the ACT mechanism explains the pyrophosphorolytic endonuclease reaction pathway in the yeast enzyme and the absence of endonuclease stimulation by noncognate NTP seen in exonuclease reaction (Fig. 2C). In the living cell, endonuclease transcription cleavage is assisted by Gre factors that strongly increase the reaction rate. We find that these factors build on the ACT mechanism by further increasing Mg-II retention and by activating the attacking water for hydrolytic reaction. The above findings in combination with crystallographic data extend the two-metal active center model to a new level of understanding of unified catalytic mechanism of RNA synthesis and degradation by RNAP. The suggested mechanism for ACT is different from the active center adjustment caused by rearrangement of the trigger loop (15Wang D. Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Kaplan C.D. Kornberg R.D.

Structural basis for substrate loading in bacterial RNA polymerase.Nature. 2007; 448: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), because ACT involves the loading (in hydrolytic RNA cleavage) or proper positioning (in RNA synthesis reaction) of catalytic Mg-II.

The mixture was kept at 40 °C in a tightly sealed tube. The pH was checked and adjusted to 7–8 by LiOH every 3 h, and iodomethane was added so that it was always in excess and formed a layer at the bottom of the tube. In about 30 h, the mixture was poured dropwise into 30 ml of acetone/ether (1:1); the residue was centrifuged, re-dissolved in water, and subjected to preparative TCL in an acetonitrile/water (3:1) developing system. The higher migrating product (Rf 0.32) was eluted with water and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. Yield was 35–40%. As expected, the product had UV absorption spectrum identical to CMP and displayed resistance to alkaline phosphatase. Cytidine 3′-methylphosphate (40 μmol) was dissolved in 1 ml of polynucleotide kinase buffer and supplemented with 0.3 ml of 0.3 m ATP, pH 8.0. Fifty microliters of T4 phage polynucleotide kinase (Biolabs) was added, and the mixture was kept at 37 °C. After 30 h of incubation, TLC analysis revealed nearly complete conversion of the starting material to reaction product, which was purified by column chromatography on Dowex-1 × 2 and isolated as described above for α-methyl-ATP. Yield was 90%. It was obtained from cytidine-5′-phospho-3′-methyl phosphate using the procedure described previously (29Hoard D.E. Ott D.G. Conversion of mono-and oligodeoxyribonucleotides to 5-thiphosphates.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 87: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and purified on Dowex-1 × 2 as described above. Defined TECs were obtained by RNAP “walking” on the 5′-biotinylated T7A1 promoter fragment immobilized on neutravidin-coated agarose (Pierce). The 370-bp DNA promoter fragment with 5′-biotin tag was generated by PCR amplification from promoter-containing pTZ19 plasmid. The open promoter complex was obtained by mixing 1 μl of neutravidin-agarose suspension with immobilized T7A1 promoter with 1 pmol of RNAP in 20 μl of transcription buffer (TB) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and washed with TB (four times by 1 ml). To prepare TEC-13A with labeled penultimate residue, 10 μl of “start” mixture (10 μm ApUpC RNA primer and ATP, GTP 13 μm each) was added to obtain first TEC-11A stalled for the absence of the next substrate. After 2.5 min of incubation at 37 °C, the suspension was washed with cold TB (six times by 1 ml) and 1 μl of [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was added to the reaction mixture. After 15 min of incubation at 0 °C, the beads were washed with cold TB without MgCl2, followed by addition of ATP and MgCl2 (to final concentrations of 30 μm and 1 mm, respectively) and incubation for 15 min at 0 °C. To remove the excess of ATP the mixture was washed by TB (four times by 1 ml). In the case of the internal labeling of RNA, the washed beads containing open complex were supplemented with 10 μl of the start mixture (see above) containing 1 μl of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 13 μm GTP followed by incubation (2.5 min at 37 °C) to obtain TEC-11A. For characterization of the exonuclease reaction, the [α-32P]NTP was introduced into 3′-terminal RNA position of TEC-13A and TEC-21U. ATPαS and CTPαS were introduced in TEC-13A and TEC-14C at 300 μm substrate concentration upon incubation of the relevant TEC at 0 °C for 30 min. TEC-VI of Fig. 7A was obtained by incubation of TEC-11A with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, 3 μm) followed by elongation with 50 μm ATP for 20 min at 0 °C, whereas elongation of TEC-12dC with 150 μm ATP αCH3 (20 min at 37 °C) was used to generate TEC-VII of Fig. 7A. TEC-III was synthesized by elongation of natural TEC-11A with 150 μm ATP αCH3 for 20 min at 0 °C. Incubation of TEC-11A internally labeled at adenylate residues (see above) with 300 μm CTP-3′-methyl phosphate for 20 min at 37 °C yielded TEC-V of Fig. 7. The last four TECs were obtained in the presence of 1.5 mm MnCl2 and 10 mm MgCl2 to facilitate modified substrate incorporation. The modified TECs were washed with cold TB (without MnCl2 or MgCl2) and used in further experiments. For endonuclease cleavage, the sample of stalled 32P-labeled TEC in 10 μl of TB without MgCl2 was diluted by 10 μl of TB, containing various MgCl2 or MnCl2 concentrations, and the mixture was incubated at 21 °C. GreA- and GreB-induced cleavage was performed using an equimolar ratio of a factor to TEC. The cleavage was stopped by adding 1 volume of the loading buffer (7 m urea, 20 mm EDTA, bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol, 0.25% each), and reaction products were resolved on a 20% PAGE (20:3 acrylamide/N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide ratio). In the case of TECs with ATP αCH3 and CTP-3′-methylphosphonate, the reaction products were resolved on 30% PAGE (20:3 acrylamide/N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide ratio, 6 m urea, 1× TBE). The Arrhenius coefficient of 5.6 for endonuclease cleavage reaction was determined by measuring the rate of the reaction at 21 and 37 °C. Details of reaction conditions with PPi and rNTP/dNTP are presented in the figures. For testing the pH dependence of endonuclease cleavage, the stalled 32P-labeled TEC was washed (four times by 1 ml) with cold buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl2, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), and then 10 μl of the samples were mixed with the equal volumes of various pH buffers. The final concentrations of the buffers were as follows: 50 mm Pipes-HCl, pH 6.0, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0–9.0, 50 mm CAPS-NaOH, pH 10.0. Other components were as in TB. A stalled TEC in 10 μl of TB without MgCl2 was supplemented with 20 μm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and 10 mm DTT. The reaction mixture was left at 21 °C. In 10 min, the reaction was stopped by adding of 1 volume of the loading buffer (7 m urea, 20 mm EDTA, bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol 0.25% each) and analyzed by PAGE. Mutational substitutions in RNAP were introduced using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit following the supplier's protocol. We analyzed the 14 available RNAP structures and found that in most cases the coordination geometry of Mg-I corresponds to the inactive state to which Mg-II cannot bind (data not shown); but in two of the structures the carboxylate residues are in the bridging orientation allowing coordination of Mg-II (which was modeled onto the structures as shown in Fig. 1C, right panel). Of particular note is that both of these exceptions represent backtracked RNAP complexes (24Wang D. Bushnell D.A. Huang X. Westover K.D. Levitt M. Kornberg R.D.

Structural basis of RNA polymerase II backtracking, arrest and reactivation.Nature. 2011; 471: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3A, we compare one of these, the backtracked complex of yeast pol II (Protein Data Bank 3GTG), with the closely related pretranslocated complex of that enzyme (PBD 1I6H (30Gnatt A.L.

In the backtracked complex, the contacts of +1 ribose residue with the active center side chains are established, and carboxylate residues Asp-460 and Asp-462 are in the active bridging orientation (Fig. 3, A and C, right panel). These ribose contacts are not established in pretranslocated complex of yeast pol II, in which the active center carboxylates are in inactive, nonbridging orientations (Fig. 3, A and C, left panel).

https://openalex.org/W2028631585,"The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) participates in the regulation of plasma sodium and volume, and gain of function mutations in the human channel cause salt-sensitive hypertension. Roles for the arachidonic acid epoxygenase metabolites, the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), in ENaC activity have been identified; however, their mechanisms of action remain unknown. In polarized M1 cells, 14,15-EET inhibited amiloride-sensitive apical to basolateral sodium transport as effectively as epidermal growth factor (EGF). The EET effects were associated with increased threonine phosphorylation of the ENaC β and γ subunits and abolished by inhibitors of (a) mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (MEK/ERK1/2) and (b) EGF receptor signaling. CYP2C44 epoxygenase knockdown blunted the sodium transport effects of EGF, and its 14,15-EET metabolite rescued the knockdown phenotype. The relevance of these findings is indicated by (a) the hypertension that results in mice administered cetuximab, an inhibitor of EGF receptor binding, and (b) immunological data showing an association between the pressure effects of cetuximab and reductions in ENaCγ phosphorylation. These studies (a) identify an ERK1/2-dependent mechanism for ENaC inhibition by 14,15-EET, (b) point to ENaC as a proximal target for EET-activated ERK1/2 mitogenic kinases, (c) characterize a mechanistic commonality between EGF and epoxygenase metabolites as ENaC inhibitors, and (d) suggest a CYP2C epoxygenase-mediated pathway for the regulation of distal sodium transport."
https://openalex.org/W1995384251,"Few clinically effective approaches reduce CNS-white matter injury. After early in-vivo white matter infarct, NFκB-driven pro-inflammatory signals can amplify a relatively small amount of vascular damage, resulting in progressive endothelial dysfunction to create a severe ischemic lesion. This process can be minimized by 15-deoxy-Δ(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (PGJ(2)), an analog of the metabolically active PGD(2) metabolite. We evaluated PGJ(2)'s effects and mechanisms using rodent anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (rAION); an in vivo white matter ischemia model. PGJ(2) administration systemically administered either acutely or 5 hours post-insult results in significant neuroprotection, with stereologic evaluation showing improved neuronal survival 30 days post-infarct. Quantitative capillary vascular analysis reveals that PGJ(2) improves perfusion at 1 day post-infarct by reducing tissue edema. Our results suggest that PGJ(2) acts by reducing NFκB signaling through preventing p65 nuclear localization and inhibiting inflammatory gene expression. Importantly, PGJ(2) showed no in vivo toxicity structurally as measured by optic nerve (ON) myelin thickness, functionally by ON-compound action potentials, on a cellular basis by oligodendrocyte precursor survival or changes in ON-myelin gene expression. PGJ(2) may be a clinically useful neuroprotective agent for ON and other CNS infarcts involving white matter, with mechanisms of action enabling effective treatment beyond the currently considered maximal time for intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2046622655,"Effective methods of secondary prevention after stroke or TIA are available but adherence to recommended evidence-based treatments is often poor. The study aimed to determine the quality of secondary prevention in usual care and to develop a stepwise modeled support program.Two consecutive cohorts of patients with acute minor stroke or TIA undergoing usual outpatient care versus a secondary prevention program were compared. Risk factor control and medication adherence were assessed in 6-month follow-ups (6M-FU). Usual care consisted of detailed information concerning vascular risk factor targets given at discharge and regular outpatient care by primary care physicians. The stepwise modeled support program additionally employed up to four outpatient appointments. A combination of educational and behavioral strategies was employed.168 patients in the observational cohort who stated their openness to participate in a prevention program (mean age 64.7 y, admission blood pressure (BP): 155/84 mmHg) and 173 patients participating in the support program (mean age 67.6 y, BP: 161/84 mmHg) were assessed at 6 months. Proportions of patients with BP according to guidelines were 50% in usual-care and 77% in the support program (p<0.01). LDL<100 mg/dl was measured in 62 versus 71% (p = 0.12). Proportions of patients who stopped smoking were 50 versus 79% (p<0.01). 72 versus 89% of patients with atrial fibrillation were on oral anticoagulation (p = 0.09).Risk factor control remains unsatisfactory in usual care. Targets of secondary prevention were met more often within the supported cohort. Effects on (cerebro-)vascular recurrence rates are going to be assessed in a multicenter randomized trial."
https://openalex.org/W1967124414,"Protons impart isoform-specific modulation of inactivation in neuronal, skeletal muscle, and cardiac voltage-gated sodium (Na(V)) channels. Although the structural basis of proton block in Na(V) channels has been well described, the amino acid residues responsible for the changes in Na(V) kinetics during extracellular acidosis are as yet unknown. We expressed wild-type (WT) and two pore mutant constructs (H880Q and C373F) of the human cardiac Na(V) channel, Na(V)1.5, in Xenopus oocytes. C373F and H880Q both attenuated proton block, abolished proton modulation of use-dependent inactivation, and altered pH modulation of the steady-state and kinetic parameters of slow inactivation. Additionally, C373F significantly reduced the maximum probability of use-dependent inactivation and slow inactivation, relative to WT. H880Q also significantly reduced the maximum probability of slow inactivation and shifted the voltage dependence of activation and fast inactivation to more positive potentials, relative to WT. These data suggest that Cys-373 and His-880 in Na(V)1.5 are proton sensors for use-dependent and slow inactivation and have implications in isoform-specific modulation of Na(V) channels."
https://openalex.org/W2048826873,"We examined adaptive clinal variation in seed mass among populations of an invasive annual species, Echium plantagineum, in response to climatic selection. We collected seeds from 34 field populations from a 1,000 km long temperature and rainfall gradient across the species' introduced range in south-eastern Australia. Seeds were germinated, grown to reproductive age under common glasshouse conditions, and progeny seeds were harvested and weighed. Analyses showed that seed mass was significantly related to climatic factors, with populations sourced from hotter, more arid sites producing heavier seeds than populations from cooler and wetter sites. Seed mass was not related to edaphic factors. We also found that seed mass was significantly related to both longitude and latitude with each degree of longitude west and latitude north increasing seed mass by around 2.5% and 4% on average. There was little evidence that within-population or between-population variation in seed mass varied in a systematic manner across the study region. Our findings provide compelling evidence for development of a strong cline in seed mass across the geographic range of a widespread and highly successful invasive annual forb. Since large seed mass is known to provide reproductive assurance for plants in arid environments, our results support the hypothesis that the fitness and range potential of invasive species can increase as a result of genetic divergence of populations along broad climatic gradients. In E. plantagineum population-level differentiation has occurred in 150 years or less, indicating that the adaptation process can be rapid."

Here, we tested the effect of 11β-HSD inhibitor, carbenoxolone (CBX) on obesity and associated comorbidities in obese rats of WNIN/Ob strain, a new animal model for genetic obesity. Methodology/Principal Findings Subcutaneous injection of CBX (50 mg/kg body weight) or volume-matched vehicle was given once daily for four weeks to three month-old WNIN/Ob lean and obese rats (n = 6 for each phenotype and for each treatment). Body composition, plasma lipids and hormones were assayed. Hepatic steatosis, adipose tissue morphology, inflammation and fibrosis were also studied. Insulin resistance and glucose intolerance were determined along with tissue glycogen content. Gene expressions were determined in liver and adipose tissue. CBX significantly inhibited 11β-HSD1 activity in liver and adipose tissue of WNIN/Ob lean and obese rats. CBX significantly decreased body fat percentage, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, insulin resistance in obese rats. CBX ameliorated hepatic steatosis, adipocyte hypertrophy, adipose tissue inflammation and fibrosis in obese rats. Tissue glycogen content was significantly decreased by CBX in liver and adipose tissue of obese rats. Severe fat loss and glucose- intolerance were observed in lean rats after CBX treatment. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that 11β-HSD1 inhibition by CBX decreases obesity and associated co-morbidities in WNIN/Ob obese rats. Our study supports the hypothesis that inhibition of 11β-HSD1 is a key strategy to treat metabolic syndrome. Severe fat loss and glucose -intolerance by CBX treatment in lean rats suggest that chronic 11β-HSD1 inhibition may lead to insulin resistance in normal conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2035835672,"The Bacillus Calmette - Guerin (BCG) vaccine provides a critical but limited defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). More than 60 years after the widespread introduction of BCG, there is an urgent need for a better vaccine. A large body of pre-clinical research continues to support ongoing clinical trials to assess whether viral vectors expressing M.tb antigens that are shared by BCG and M.tb, can be used alongside BCG to enhance protection. A major focus involves using multiple unique viral vectors to limit anti-vector immunity and thereby enhance responses to the insert antigen delivered. The successful introduction of viral vector vaccines to target M.tb and other pathogens will be reliant on reducing the costs when using multiple vectors and inhibiting the development of unwanted anti-vector responses that interfere with the response to insert antigen. This study examines methods to reduce the logistical costs of vaccination by mixing different viral vectors that share the same insert antigen in one vaccine; and whether combining different viral vectors reduces anti-vector immunity to improve immunogenicity to the insert antigen. Here we show that a homologous prime-boost regimen with a mixture of MVA (Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara) and Ad5 (human adenovirus type 5) vectors both expressing Ag85A in a single vaccine preparation is able to reduce anti-vector immunity, compared with a homologous prime-boost regimen with either vector alone. However, the level of immunogenicity induced by the homologous mixture remained comparable to that induced with single viral vectors and was less immunogenic than a heterologous Ad5 prime-MVA-boost regimen. These findings advance the understanding of how anti-vector immunity maybe reduced in viral vector vaccination regimens. Furthermore, an insight is provided to the impact on vaccine immunogenicity from altering vaccination methods to reduce the logistical demands of using separate vaccine preparations in the field."
https://openalex.org/W2109210574,"HIV status aware couples with at least one HIV positive partner are characterized by high separation and divorce rates. This phenomenon is often described as a corollary of couples HIV Testing and Counseling (HTC) that ought to be minimized. In this contribution, we demonstrate the implications of partnership dissolution in serodiscordant couples for the propagation of HIV.We develop a compartmental model to study epidemic outcomes of elevated partnership dissolution rates in serodiscordant couples and parameterize it with estimates from population-based data (Rakai, Uganda).Via its effect on partnership dissolution, every percentage point increase in HIV status awareness reduces HIV incidence in monogamous populations by 0.27 percent for women and 0.63 percent for men. These effects are even larger when the assumption of monogamy can be relaxed, but are moderated by other behavior changes (e.g., increased condom use) in HIV status aware serodiscordant partnerships. When these behavior changes are taken into account, each percentage point increase in HIV status awareness reduces HIV incidence by 0.13 and 0.32 percent for women and men, respectively (assuming monogamy). The partnership dissolution effect exists because it decreases the fraction of serodiscordant couples in the population and prolongs the time that individuals spend outside partnerships.Our model predicts that elevated partnership dissolution rates in HIV status aware serodiscordant couples reduce the spread of HIV. As a consequence, the full impact of couples HTC for HIV prevention is probably larger than recognized to date. Particularly high partnership dissolution rates in female positive serodiscordant couples contribute to the gender imbalance in HIV infections."

In this study, we have observed higher sensitivity of doxorubicin-resistant uterine sarcoma MES-SA/DX5 cells to ultrasound exposure compared to its parent counterpart MES-SA cells; however, the results showed that the acoustic irradiation was genotoxic and could promote neotic division in exposed cells that was more pronounced in the resistant variant. The neotic progeny, imaged microscopically 24 hr post sonication, could contribute in modulating the final cell survival when an apoptotic dose of doxorubicin was combined with ultrasound applied either simultaneously or sequentially in dual-treatment protocols. Depending on the time and order of application of ultrasound and doxorubicin in combination treatments, there was either desensitization of the parent cells or sensitization of the resistant cells to doxorubicin action."
https://openalex.org/W2066260115,"Myocardin (Mycd), a key factor in smooth muscle cell differentiation, is constitutively located in the nucleus, whereas myocardin-related transcription factors A and B (MRTF-A/B) reside mostly in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus in a Rho-dependent manner. Here, we investigated the nuclear export of Mycd family members. They possess two leucine-rich sequences: L1 in the N terminus and L2 in the Gln-rich domain. Although L2 (but not L1) served as a CRM1-binding site for Mycd, CRM1-mediated nuclear export did not affect its subcellular localization. Serum response factor (SRF) competitively inhibited Mycd/CRM1 interaction. Furthermore, such interaction was autonomously inhibited. The N terminus of Mycd bound intramolecularly to Mycd, resulting in masking L2. In contrast, the CRM1-binding affinity of MRTF-A was much higher than that of Mycd because both L1 and L2 of MRTF-A served as functional CRM1-binding sites, and the autoinhibition observed in the Mycd/CRM1 interaction was absent in the MRTF-A/CRM1 interaction. Additionally, because the SRF-binding affinity of MRTF-A was lower than that of Mycd, the inhibitory effect of SRF on the MRTF-A/CRM1 interaction was weak. Thus, MRTF-A is much more likely to be exported from the nucleus. These differences could be the reason for the distinct subcellular localization of Mycd and MRTF-A."

Changes in blood flow, systemic hormones, and locally produced factors were indicated as important elements contributing to the response of osteoblastic cells to loading, but research in this field still has many questions. Here, the possible biological involvement of thyroid C cells is being investigated. The paper is a comparison between a case of a wild type single mouse and a over-expressing pleiotrophin single mouse exposed to hypogravity conditions during the first animal experiment of long stay in International Space Station (91 days) and three similar mice exposed to hypergravity (2Gs) conditions. We provide evidence that both microgravity and hypergravity induce similar loss of C cells with reduction of calcitonin production. Pleiotrophin over-expression result in some protection against negative effects of gravity change. Potential implication of the gravity mechanic forces in the regulation of bone homeostasis via thyroid equilibrium is discussed."

The barrier heights are estimated using adiabatic mapping and are shown to give barrier heights to within 3kcal/mol of B3LYP/6-31G(d)//RHF/3-21G results for a small model system. Relatively strict convergence criteria (0.5kcal/(mol{\AA})), long NDDO cutoff distances within the MOZYME method (15{\AA}) and single point evaluations using conventional PM6 are needed for reliable results.

The sequence of host PrP is the major determinant of host prion disease susceptibility. In mice, the presence of allele a (Prnp(a), encoding the polymorphism Leu-108/Thr-189) or b (Prnp(b), Phe-108/Val-189) is associated with short or long incubation times, respectively, following infection with PrP(Sc). The molecular bases linking PrP sequence, infection susceptibility, and convertibility of PrP(C) into PrP(Sc) remain unclear. Here we show that recombinant PrP(a) and PrP(b) aggregate and respond to seeding differently in vitro. Our kinetic studies reveal differences during the nucleation phase of the aggregation process, where PrP(b) exhibits a longer lag phase that cannot be completely eliminated by seeding the reaction with preformed fibrils. Additionally, PrP(b) is more prone to propagate features of the seeds, as demonstrated by conformational stability and electron microscopy studies of the formed fibrils. We propose a model of polymerization to explain how the polymorphisms at positions 108 and 189 produce the phenotypes seen in vivo. This model also provides insight into phenomena such as species barrier and prion strain generation, two phenomena also influenced by the primary structure of PrP."

Thus, Pol δ is likely to be responsible for the majority of DNA synthesis in human cells. DNA polymerase δ 5-fluor-orotic acid deoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate. The accuracy of synthesis by Pol δ is determined primarily by the configuration of the catalytic site, which creates a steric and electrostatic bias for the incorporation of correct nucleotides (reviewed in Ref. 7.Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. DNA replication fidelity.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Replicative fidelity is further enhanced by the intrinsic exonuclease activity (“proofreading”) of Pol δ, which catalyzes the preferential hydrolysis of non-complementary nucleotides at the 3′ terminus (4.Morrison A. Sugino A. The 3′–>5′ exonucleases of both DNA polymerases δ and ϵ participate in correcting errors of DNA replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Gen.

The active site of Pol δ, in the absence of exonucleolytic proofreading, catalyzes one base substitution error per 7,600 nucleotides polymerized in yeast (9.Fortune J.M. Pavlov Y.I. Welch C.M. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase δ: high fidelity for base substitutions but lower fidelity for single- and multi-base deletions.J. Biol.

High fidelity and lesion bypass capability of human DNA polymerase δ.Biochimie. 2009; 91: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Proofreading activity decreases the error rate of the human enzyme by at least 10-fold, an average of one base substitution error per 220,000 nucleotides polymerized. The overall fidelity of cellular DNA replication can be further enhanced to a rate of 1.0 × 10−10 errors per base by extrinsic factors such as the mismatch repair system and by accessory proteins at the replication fork. The structure of the Pol δ catalytic domain, similar with that of most DNA polymerases, resembles an open right hand, with the thumb domain angled across the palm, and one or more α-helical fingers projecting toward the polymerase active site (11.Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Polymerase structures and function: variations on a theme?.J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Swan M.K. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Aggarwal A.K. Structural basis of high-fidelity DNA synthesis by yeast DNA polymerase δ.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The site of deoxynucleotide addition is in a central pocket, through which the template and elongating primer DNA strands are threaded. The addition of the nascent nucleotide is catalyzed by carbonyl groups on key amino acids of the palm domain, along with associated magnesium ions (13.Steitz T.A. A mechanism for all polymerases.Nature. 1998; 391: 231-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). However, the fingers domain is responsible for proper orientation of the incoming nucleotide (12.Swan M.K. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Aggarwal A.K.

Residues in the fingers domain align the paired bases for hydrogen binding, promote base stacking interactions, and make the α-phosphate available for nucleophilic attack by the primer 3′-OH. Alterations in the amino acid composition of the Pol δ catalytic subunit can affect the fidelity of DNA synthesis (for reviews, see Refs. 16.Herr A.J. Williams L.N. Preston B.D.

DNA polymerase δ in DNA replication and genome maintenance.Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2012; 53: 666-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The regions that form the catalytic pocket are structurally and compositionally conserved across all known polymerase species, and very few naturally occurring catalytic site mutations in the human replicative polymerases have been reported. A number of variants have been generated in vitro to study Pol δ kinetics and base selectivity, many of them in critical positions that originally were identified in genetic screens from viral and bacterial studies (18.Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. Motif A of bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase: role in primer extension and DNA replication fidelity. Isolation of new antimutator and mutator DNA polymerases.J. Biol.

These include the positions responsible for discrimination between the deoxyribo- and ribo forms of nucleotides, as well as variants of a conserved leucine in the palm domain that yield a spectrum of activities depending on the amino acid substituted at that position (20.Pavlov Y.I.

Surprisingly, given the essential role of Pol δ, only one catalytic site mutation has been identified in a human disease: the R689W substitution, found in the DLD-2 colorectal cancer cell line (22.Flohr T. Dai J.C. Büttner J. Popanda O. Hagmüller E. Thielmann H.W. Detection of mutations in the DNA polymerase δ gene of human sporadic colorectal cancers and colon cancer cell lines.Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The R689W substitution confers a mutator phenotype and lethal error catastrophe when the analogous variant is expressed in yeast (23.Daee D.L. Mertz T.M. Shcherbakova P.V. A cancer-associated DNA polymerase δ variant modeled in yeast causes a catastrophic increase in genomic instability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Arg689 is located in motif B on the P-helix of the fingers domain, distal to the end that forms the active nucleotide binding site. Because this region of the fingers domain of Pol δ is not well explored, we searched for mutator mutants at the C-terminal end of motif B in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol δ by substituting each position with all possible amino acids. We identified a mutator mutation, A699Q, which appears to be dependent on a new interaction formed between the P-helix and the N-terminal domain. The cognate human mutation (hPol ΔA692Q) was introduced, and this enzyme was purified. We report that hPol δA692Q is a mutator polymerase that generates replicative errors, particularly base substitutions, and exhibits reduced proofreading capacity. These results highlight the critical role played by the fingers domain in maintaining high fidelity DNA synthesis. The S. cerevisiae POL3 gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of Pol δ, was cloned in the LEU2 containing vector YcpLac111. Variants were created at amino acid positions 696–699 on the S. cerevisiae DNA polymerase δ catalytic subunit (POL3) using the common reverse primer 5′-GGCAGCTTCGGTACCAAGATCCATAGCTTCCTT-3′, and the following randomized, site-specific forward primers: 5′-GATGAGAAGGATCCATTCAAAAGAGATGTTTTAAATGGTNNNCAATTGGCTTTGAAGATT-3′; 5′-GATGAGAAGGATCCATTCAAAAGAGATGTTTTAAATGGTAGANNNTTGGCTTTGAAGATTTCA-3′; 5′-GATGAGAAGGATCCATTCAAAAGAGATGTTTTAAATGGTAGACAANNNGCTTTGAAGATTTCAGCT-3′; and 5′-GATGAGAAGGATCCATTCAAAAGAGATGTTTTAAATGGTAGACAATTGNNNTTGAAGATTTCAGCTAAC-3′, where NNN indicates random nucleotides. Following PCR amplification, a library of plasmids harboring random substitutions at the designated positions on the LEU2 containing vector YcpLac111 was transformed into BY4741(pol3Δ0::kanMX) cells harboring YcpLac33-Pol3, a URA3 containing vector that provides wild type S. cerevisae Pol δ, and the cells were grown on Synthetic Dextrose medium (SD medium) lacking leucine and uracil. To remove the YcpLac33-Pol3 vector and thereby select for cells with functionally active polymerase variants, colonies were then transferred to plates lacking leucine, but containing 5-fluor-orotic acid (5-FOA). Surviving colonies from 5-FOA plates were plated onto both Synthetic Complete medium (SC medium) and SD medium lacking arginine and leucine, with canavanine sulfate (60 mg/liter) added for the CAN1 forward mutation assay. Yeast colonies grown on 5-FOA-containing medium and expressing wild type or mutant polymerases were diluted in water. Most of each dilution was spread directly onto canavanine sulfate plates (SD-Leu-Arg+Can), and the remaining 5% was subjected to six 10-fold dilutions. The serial dilutions were plated in 10-μl drops onto SC medium. Eight colonies of each genotype were assayed. After 3 days of growth, the number of colony forming units on each SD-Leu-Arg+Can plate was estimated by assessing growth on SC medium. The mutation rate was determined through the MSS-Maximum Likelihood Estimator method using the web application FALCOR (24.Hall B.M. Ma C.X. Liang P. Singh K.K.

The four-subunit human DNA Pol δ was expressed and purified from bacteria as described (10.Schmitt M.W. Matsumoto Y. Loeb L.A.

Briefly, BL21-tRARE competent cells were co-transformed by electroporation with pET3-PolD1, harboring the Pol δ p125 catalytic subunit, and pCOLA-polD2,3,4, which harbors the accessory subunits of the holoenzyme. Expression was induced by overnight incubation of mid-log phase cells with isopropyl β-d-1 thiogalactopyranoside at 15 °C. Cells were pelleted and frozen, and the crude extract was obtained by 10 rounds of sonication in buffer containing 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, followed by centrifugation of the debris. The purification consisted of two stages: first, the extract was bound to a charged nickel column via a polyhistidine tag on the p12 subunit, and bound proteins were eluted in batch with increasing concentrations of imidazole (30–300 mm). Next, the 300 mm imidazole eluate was subjected to ion exchange purification on a HiTrap SP HP column (GE Healthcare) using a 0.2–1.0 m linear NaCl gradient. The peak fraction was identified by assaying each fraction for DNA polymerase activity by incorporation of [α-32P]ATP into activated calf thymus DNA. The presence of all four subunits in the active fraction was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Flamingo fluorescent protein staining (Bio-Rad) (data not shown). M13mp2 gapped DNA substrate was extended by Pol δ variants at 37 °C for 1 h in a 25-μl reaction containing 86 nmol of enzyme, 1.5 nmol of gapped plasmid, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 50 mm KCl, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. To separate the enzyme and DNA, 0.5 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K was added to each reaction, followed by incubation for an additional 15 min at 37 °C. Most of each reaction was run on a 0.8% TAE agarose gel (Invitrogen Ultra Pure) overnight at 80 V to verify gap filling. MC1061 cells were transformed by electroporation with a 1:10 dilution of the filled DNA substrate, and the transformed cells were combined in soft agar with mid-log CSH50 α-complementation cells, 0.75 mm isopropyl β-d-1 thiogalactopyranoside, 4.4 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and subsequently plated onto agar plates containing VB salts (0.2 mg/ml MgSO4-7H20, 2.0 mg/ml citric acid, 10 mg/ml K2HPO4, 3.5 mg/ml Na(NH4)HPO4-4H2O), 0.4% glucose (w/v), and 0.5 μg of thiamine-HCl. Plaques were visually evaluated for degree of blue pigment, and any clear or light blue plaques were marked. Mutation frequency was determined by dividing the number of mutant plaques by the total number of plaques. Mutant plaques were picked into 0.9% NaCl (w/v) and were used to infect fresh liquid cultures of CSH50 cells to obtain sufficient DNA for sequencing. Mutation rates for base substitutions and ±1 insertions and deletions were calculated using the formula ((N1/N) × MF)/(D × 0.6), where N1 is the number of mutations in that category, N is the total number of mutations, MF is the mutation frequency, and D is the number of detectable sites in that category (26.Bebenek K.

Unincorporated [α-32P]dTTP was removed by Sephadex G-50 filtration, followed by ethanol precipitation. The exonuclease assays contained 0.036–0.2 pmol of polymerase in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 μg of BSA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of a buffer containing 1 mm EDTA. The product was ethanol precipitated, and the supernatant was assayed for released radioactivity by scintillation counting. Steady state nucleotide addition experiments were performed using a 46-bp template, 5′-GCGCGGAAGCTTGGCTGCAGAAGATTGCTAGCGGGAATTCGGCGCG-3′ and a 23-bp primer, 5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCTAGCAAT-3′, or a 24-bp primer, 5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCTAGCAATT-3′ for mismatch extension and degradation studies. Enzyme concentration and time of incubation at 37 °C was established to be linear for each enzyme. The indicated concentrations of enzymes were incubated in a 10-μl reaction with 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 nm primer template, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Reactions were initiated by the addition of nucleotides, run at 37 °C, and then placed on ice and stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 95% (v/v) formamide/20 mm EDTA. After resolution on 14% polyacrylamide gel, the bands were developed on a PhosphorImager device and quantified. Km and Vmax were obtained by curve-fitting the density data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Kaleidagraph (Synergy software). Frequency of misincorporation (finc) was calculated by ((kcat/Km)incorrect/(kcat/Km)correct) (27.Bloom L.B. Chen X. Fygenson D.K. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27919-27930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Motif B of Pol δ is highly conserved at the amino acid level from humans to yeast. To determine the ability of residues Arg696-Ala699 in motif B of S. cerevisiae Pol δ to tolerate substitutions, we undertook a PCR mutagenesis strategy wherein a set of forward PCR primers with randomly substituted nucleotides at the three positions of each codon was used to modify the region, codon by codon. The mixture of primers in a single reaction should have representation of all 64 possible trinucleotides within the codon. Because many codons are degenerate, there was an overrepresentation of more commonly coded amino acids, such as arginine (six possible codons) over more rarely coded amino acids, such as methionine (one codon). The products of the PCR mutagenesis were subcloned into YcpLac111-POL3E (LEU2) and transformed into the yeast BY4741, whose chromosomal copy of POL3, encoding the catalytic subunit of Pol δ, was deleted. As Pol δ is an essential protein, these cells harbor an extrachromosomal copy of POL3 (YcpLac33-POL3 (ura3)). This library of mutant polymerases underwent purifying selection for activity by plasmid shuffling between media lacking leucine and uracil but containing 5-FOA. Colonies that grow on 5-FOA are under the direct control of the product of the PCR mutagenesis reactions, as 5-FOA is toxic to cells that harbor the URA3 cassette. We picked colonies and sequenced motif B to determine the spectrum of surviving substitutions at the first four positions of motif B. Mutagenesis of the 696–699 region of S. cerevisiae Pol δ revealed a large tolerance for single amino acid substitutions (Table 1). At the Arg696 site alone, we identified 13 amino acids representing polar, nonpolar, charged, and hydrophobic residues that could substitute for alanine. This is in contrast to previous work on Escherichia coli Pol I and TaqDNA polymerase using random mutagenesis of the entire polymerase molecule which suggested that this position is very highly conserved (28.Suzuki M.

The previously described mutation, R689W, which was identified in the human colorectal cancer cell line, DLD-1, has been demonstrated to be a strong mutator that is non-viable in haploid yeast (23.Daee D.L. Mertz T.M. Shcherbakova P.V. A cancer-associated DNA polymerase δ variant modeled in yeast causes a catastrophic increase in genomic instability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Consistent with this work, the analogous R696W substitution did not appear in our screen. Among the other positions, Gln697 permitted 10 amino acid substitutions; Leu698 was highly permissive, with 16 possible substitutions; and Ala699 allowed 10 substitutions.TABLE 1Allowable substitutions at amino acids 696–699 of S. cerevisiae POL3Arg696GlnAsnGluAspValIleLeuAlaTyrThrSerGlyCysGln697AsnTrpPheCalIleLeuAlaTyrThrLeu698GlnAsnGluAspValIleAlaTyrThrSerGlyCysHisArgLysAla699GlnMetHisCysValGlyLeuSerTyrThr Open table in a new tab The large number of active substituted proteins served as a pool from which to screen for alterations in DNA polymerase function. We screened the variant strains for increased mutagenesis in a forward mutation assay that is based upon inactivation of the CAN1 gene. A few of the variants demonstrated an increase in mutation frequency, and their mutation rates were subsequently established by fluctuation analysis (Fig. 1A). We identified the A699Q substitution as our strongest mutator, with a mutation rate ∼20-fold higher than wild type Pol δ. By comparison, the exonuclease-deficient Pol δ variant, pol3-01, which lacks the ability to undergo proofreading, has only a 7-fold higher rate than wild type Pol δ in the CAN1 assay. Modeling the A699Q mutation onto the crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Pol δ, consisting of a closed ternary complex containing the catalytic subunit of Pol δ, the template primer, and the incoming complementary nucleotide, reveals four potential contacts that A699Q could make, but that the wild type Ala699 cannot (Fig. 1B) (30.Leaver-Fay A. Tyka M. Lewis S.M. Lange O.F. Thompson J. Jacak R. Kaufman K. Renfrew P.D. Smith C.A. Sheffler W. Davis I.W. Cooper S. Treuille A. Mandell D.J. Richter F. Ban Y.E. Fleishman S.J. Corn J.E. Kim D.E.

ROSETTA3: an object-oriented software suite for the simulation and design of macromolecules.Methods Enzymol. 2011; 487: 545-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). The four positions are located on the N-terminal domain, separated from the P-helix of the fingers domain by an aqueous channel. To explore whether a new intramolecular contact was being made by the A699Q mutation, we constructed Pol δ mutants in which alanine was substituted for these four potential positions of contact: Glu471, Asn536, Tyr537, and Met540. These were made as individual substitutions, as well as in combination with the A699Q mutation. If interaction at any of these target sites substantially contributes to the mutator phenotype of Pol δA699Q, then substituting that target for an alanine residue could suppress the mutator phenotype of A699Q. There was no reduced growth phenotype with E471A, N536A, or M540A, nor was there any abnormal growth phenotype with these mutations in the A699Q background. However, the Y537A mutant grew poorly, producing only microcolonies after several days. As shown in Fig. 1C, fluctuation analysis of the singly and doubly mutated Pol δ species revealed that the single mutants had a base-line rate of mutation similar to wild type. A possible exception is the Y537A variant, which was difficult to assess via canavanine resistance due to its severe growth phenotype. Analysis of the double mutants presents a complicated picture. Three of the double mutants (E471A/A699Q, N536A/A699Q, and Y537A/A699Q) exhibited elevated rates of mutation that were similar, within experimental error, to A699Q alone. The M540A/A699Q variant, however, exhibited a wild type mutation rate, strongly suggesting that an interaction between A699Q and Met540 is responsible for the mutator phenotype of A699Q. The combination of A699Q and N536A produced an apparent increase in mutation rate over A699Q alone, but with high variance. This high level of noise within three independent replicates may reflect a transient interaction with Asn536. Furthermore, the rescue of the Y537A growth phenotype by A699Q suggests a potential interaction between these sites. Alternatively, it may represent the ability of A699Q to compensate for the Y537A substitu"
https://openalex.org/W2015387744,"Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) is an effective therapy to treat patients with chronic dyspepsia refractory to medical management. However, its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood.Gastric pain was induced by performing gastric distension (GD) in anesthetized rats. Pain response was monitored by measuring the pseudo-affective reflex (e.g., blood pressure variation), while neuronal activation was determined using c-fos immunochemistry in the central nervous system. Involvement of primary afferents was assessed by measuring phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in dorsal root ganglia.GES decreased blood pressure variation induced by GD, and prevented GD-induced neuronal activation in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (T9-T10), the nucleus of the solitary tract and in CRF neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. This effect remained unaltered within the spinal cord when sectioning the medulla at the T5 level. Furthermore, GES prevented GD-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in dorsal root ganglia.GES decreases GD-induced pain and/or discomfort likely through a direct modulation of gastric spinal afferents reducing central processing of visceral nociception."

The results show that the same antigen immunized in several rabbits yields polyclonal antibodies with similar epitopes, but with larger differences in the relative amounts of antibodies to the different epitopes. In some cases, unique epitopes were observed for one of the immunizations. The results suggest that polyclonal antibodies generated by repeated immunizations do not display an identical epitope pattern, although many of the epitopes are similar."
https://openalex.org/W2081897214,"The cytosolic NADP+-dependent malic enzyme (c-NADP-ME) has a dimer-dimer quaternary structure in which the dimer interface associates more tightly than the tetramer interface. In this study, the urea-induced unfolding process of the c-NADP-ME interface mutants was monitored using fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation and enzyme activities. Here, we demonstrate the differential protein stability between dimer and tetramer interface interactions of human c-NADP-ME. Our data clearly demonstrate that the protein stability of c-NADP-ME is affected predominantly by disruptions at the dimer interface rather than at the tetramer interface. First, during thermal stability experiments, the melting temperatures of the wild-type and tetramer interface mutants are 8–10°C higher than those of the dimer interface mutants. Second, during urea denaturation experiments, the thermodynamic parameters of the wild-type and tetramer interface mutants are almost identical. However, for the dimer interface mutants, the first transition of the urea unfolding curves shift towards a lower urea concentration, and the unfolding intermediate exist at a lower urea concentration. Third, for tetrameric WT c-NADP-ME, the enzyme is first dissociated from a tetramer to dimers before the 2 M urea treatment, and the dimers then dissociated into monomers before the 2.5 M urea treatment. With a dimeric tetramer interface mutant (H142A/D568A), the dimer completely dissociated into monomers after a 2.5 M urea treatment, while for a dimeric dimer interface mutant (H51A/D90A), the dimer completely dissociated into monomers after a 1.5 M urea treatment, indicating that the interactions of c-NADP-ME at the dimer interface are truly stronger than at the tetramer interface. Thus, this study provides a reasonable explanation for why malic enzymes need to assemble as a dimer of dimers."
https://openalex.org/W2078035987,"In 1991, treasure hunters found skeletal remains in an area close to the destroyed country residence of former Nazi leader Hermann Göring in northeastern Berlin. The remains, which were believed to belong to Carin Göring, who was buried at the site, were examined to determine whether it was possible to make a positive identification. The anthropological analysis showed that the remains come from an adult woman. The DNA analysis of several bone elements showed female sex, and a reference sample from Carin's son revealed mtDNA sequences identical to the remains. The profile has one nucleotide difference from the Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS), the common variant 263G. A database search resulted in a frequency of this mtDNA sequence of about 10% out of more than 7,000 European haplotypes. The mtDNA sequence found in the ulna, the cranium and the reference sample is, thus, very common among Europeans. Therefore, nuclear DNA analysis was attempted. The remains as well as a sample from Carin's son were successfully analysed for the three nuclear markers TH01, D7S820 and D8S1179. The nuclear DNA analysis of the two samples revealed one shared allele for each of the three markers, supporting a mother and son relationship. This genetic information together with anthropological and historical files provides an additional piece of circumstantial evidence in our efforts to identify the remains of Carin Göring."
https://openalex.org/W2124440937,"The transthyretin-like protein (TLP) from Salmonella enterica subspecies I is a periplasmic protein with high level structural similarity to a protein found in mammals and fish. In humans, the protein homologue, transthyretin, binds and carries retinol and thyroxine, and a series of other, unrelated aromatic compounds. Here we show that the amino acid sequence of the TLP from different species, subspecies and serovars of the Salmonella genus is highly conserved and demonstrate that the TLP gene is constitutively expressed in S. Typhimurium and that copper and other divalent metal ions severely inhibit enzyme activity of the TLP, a cyclic amidohydrolase that hydrolyses 5-hydroxyisourate (5-HIU). In order to determine the in vivo role of the S. Typhimurium TLP, we constructed a strain of mouse-virulent S. Typhimurium SL1344 bearing a mutation in the TLP gene (SL1344 ΔyedX). We assessed the virulence of this strain via oral inoculation of mice and chickens. Whilst SL1344 ΔyedX induced a systemic infection in both organisms, the bacterial load detected in the faeces of infected chickens was significantly reduced when compared to the load of S. Typhimurium SL1344. These data demonstrate that the TLP gene is required for survival of S. Typhimurium in a high uric acid environment such as chicken faeces, and that metabolic traits of Salmonellae in natural and contrived hosts may be fundamentally different. Our data also highlight the importance of using appropriate animal models for the study of bacterial pathogenesis especially where host-specific virulence factors or traits are the subject of the study."
https://openalex.org/W2075777212,"RNA interference via exogenous small interference RNAs (siRNA) is a powerful tool in gene function study and disease treatment. Designing efficient and specific siRNA on target gene remains the key issue in RNAi. Although various in silico models have been proposed for rational siRNA design, most of them focus on the efficiencies of selected siRNAs, while limited effort has been made to improve their specificities targeted on specific mRNAs, which is related to reducing off-target effects (OTEs) in RNAi. In our study, we propose for the first time that the enhancement of target specificity of siRNA design can be achieved computationally by domain transfer in heterogeneous data sources from different siRNA targets. A transfer learning based method i.e., heterogeneous regression (HEGS) is presented for target-specific siRNA efficacy modeling and feature selection. Based on the model, (1) the target regression model can be built by extracting information from related data in other targets/experiments, thus increasing the target specificity in siRNA design with the help of information from siRNAs binding to other homologous genes, and (2) the potential features correlated to the current siRNA design can be identified even when there is lack of experimental validated siRNA affinity data on this target. In summary, our findings present useful instructions for a better target-specific siRNA design, with potential applications in genome-wide high-throughput screening of effective siRNA, and will provide further insights on the mechanism of RNAi."
https://openalex.org/W2083947995,"Chmp2b is closely related to Vps2, a key component of the yeast protein complex that creates the intralumenal vesicles of multivesicular bodies. Dominant negative mutations in Chmp2b cause autophagosome accumulation and neurodegenerative disease. Loss of Chmp2b causes failure of dendritic spine maturation in cultured neurons. The homeobox gene Lbx1 plays an essential role in specifying postmitotic dorsal interneuron populations during late pattern formation in the neural tube. We have discovered that Chmp2b is one of the most highly regulated cell-autonomous targets of Lbx1 in the embryonic mouse neural tube. Chmp2b was expressed and depended on Lbx1 in only two of the five nascent, Lbx1-expressing, postmitotic, dorsal interneuron populations. It was also expressed in neural tube cell populations that lacked Lbx1 protein. The observed population-specific expression of Chmp2b indicated that only certain population-specific combinations of sequence specific transcription factors allow Chmp2b expression. The cell populations that expressed Chmp2b corresponded, in time and location, to neurons that make the first synapses of the spinal cord. Chmp2b protein was transported into neurites within the motor- and association-neuropils, where the first synapses are known to form between E11.5 and E12.5 in mouse neural tubes. Selective, developmentally-specified gene expression of Chmp2b may therefore be used to endow particular neuronal populations with the ability to mature dendritic spines. Such a mechanism could explain how mammalian embryos reproducibly establish the disynaptic cutaneous reflex only between particular cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W2090846292,"Background The impact of early postnatal androgen exposure on female laryngeal tissue may depend on certain characteristics of this exposure. We assessed the impact of the dose, duration, and timing of early androgen exposure on the vocal development of female subjects who had been treated for adrenocortical tumor (ACT) in childhood. Methods The long-term effects of androgen exposure on the fundamental vocal frequency (F0), vocal pitch, and final height and the presence of virilizing signs were examined in 9 adult (age, 18.4 to 33.5 years) and 10 adolescent (13.6 to 17.8 years) female ACT patients. We also compared the current values with values obtained 0.9 years to 7.4 years after these subjects had undergone ACT surgery, a period during which they had shown normal androgen levels. Results Of the 19 subjects, 17 (89%) had been diagnosed with ACT before 4 years of age, 1 (5%) at 8.16 years, and 1 (5%) at 10.75 years. Androgen exposure (2 to 30 months) was sufficiently strong to cause pubic hair growth in all subjects and clitoromegaly in 74% (14/19) of the subjects, but did not reduce their height from the target value. Although androgen exposure induced a remarkable reduction in F0 (132 Hz) and moderate pitch virilization in 1 subject and partial F0 virilization, resulting in F0 of 165 and 169 Hz, in 2 subjects, the majority had normal F0 ranging from 189 to 245 Hz. Conclusions Female laryngeal tissue is less sensitive to androgen exposure between birth and adrenarche than during other periods. Differential larynx sensitivity to androgen exposure in childhood and F0 irreversibility in adulthood are age-, concentration-, duration-, and timing-dependent events that may also be affected by exposure to inhibitory or stimulatory hormones. Further studies are required to better characterize each of these factors."
https://openalex.org/W2128662561,"Numerous experimental techniques and computational studies, proposed in recent times, have revolutionized the understanding of protein-folding paradigm. The complete understanding of protein folding and intermediates are of medical relevance, as the aggregation of misfolding proteins underlies various diseases, including some neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we describe the unfolding of M-crystallin, a βγ-crystallin homologue protein from archaea, from its native state to its denatured state using multidimensional NMR and other biophysical techniques. The protein, which was earlier characterized to be a predominantly β-sheet protein in its native state, shows different structural propensities (α and β), under different denaturing conditions. In 2 M GdmCl, the protein starts showing two distinct sets of peaks, with one arising from a partially unfolded state and the other from a completely folded state. The native secondary structural elements start disappearing as the denaturant concentration approaches 4 M. Subsequently, the protein is completely unfolded when the denaturant concentration is 6 M. The 15N relaxation data (T1/T2), heteronuclear 1H-15N Overhauser effects (nOes), NOESY data, and other biophysical data taken together indicate that the protein shows a consistent, gradual change in its structural and motional preferences with increasing GdmCl concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1980740370,"While treating stage III melanoma patients with autologous therapeutic TIL in an adjuvant setting, we previously reported a significant benefit of treatment on both progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with only one invaded lymph node (early stage III) compared to patients with more than one invaded lymph nodes (advanced stage III). In this context, in order to understand the difference of activity of TIL therapy according to the progression of the illness at stage III, the first objective of the present study was to determine potential differences in the characteristics of TIL populations obtained from an early stage III and a more advanced stage III when tumor burden is more important. The second objective was to determine possible differences in tissue expression level of several molecules involved in interactions between tumor cells and T cells between early and advanced stage III considering that the tumor microenvironment of invaded lymph nodes could become more tolerant with the progression of the disease. A total of 47 samples of melanoma invaded LN from stage IIIb (AJCC 2007) melanoma patients treated with TIL plus IL-2 were included in this study. We confirmed that both PFS and OS were significantly associated to the presence of tumor-reactive T-cells among TIL injected to the patients and that these tumor reactive T cells were more frequently observed at the early stage III. Moreover, while analyzing the expression of 17 markers on 34/47 tumor specimens using immunohistochemistry, we identified that 3 tissue markers involved in interactions between melanoma cells and T cells have a significant difference of expression between early and advanced stage III: MHC class I, adhesion molecule ICAM-1 and the co-stimulation molecule LFA-3 had a significantly weaker expression in melanoma tissue specimens from advanced stage III. In addition, the expression of the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor (CD25) and the nuclear transcription factor Foxp3 was significantly increased in the melanoma tissue specimens from advanced stage III. Our results suggest differences in the immunological status of the tumor microenvironment between early and advanced stage III, which could explain the difference in clinical response to TIL infusion in an adjuvant setting between early and advanced stage III."
https://openalex.org/W2002896603,"Introduction Trastuzumab dramatically improves survival in breast cancer patients whose tumor overexpresses HER2. A subpopulation of cells in human breast tumors has been identified with characteristics of cancer stem cells. These breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs) rely on HER2 signaling for self-renewal, suggesting that HER2-targeted therapy targets BCSCs even when the bulk of the tumor does not overexpress HER2. In order to guide clinical trials examining HER2-targeted therapy in the adjuvant setting, we propose a mathematical model to examine BCSC population dynamics and predict optimal duration of therapy. Methods Varying the susceptibility of BCSCs to HER2-targeted therapy, we quantify the average time to extinction of BCSCs. We expand our model using stochastic simulation to include the partially differentiated tumor cells (TCs) that represent bulk tumor population and examine effects of plasticity on required duration of therapy. Results Lower susceptibility of BCSCs and increased rates of dedifferentiation entail longer extinction times, indicating a need for prolonged administration of HER2-targeted therapy. We predict that even when therapy does not appreciably reduce tumor size in the advanced cancer setting, it will eventually eradicate the tumor in the adjuvant setting as long as there is at least a modest effect on BCSCs. Conclusions We anticipate that our results will inform clinical trials of targeted therapies in planning the duration of therapy needed to eradicate BCSCs. Our predictions also address safety, as longer duration of therapy entails a greater potential impact on normal stem cells that may also be susceptible to stem cell-targeted therapies."
