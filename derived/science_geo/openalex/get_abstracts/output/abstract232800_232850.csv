However, their interactions with other components of the NADPH oxidase are poorly defined. We determined whether a direct interaction of Nox1 and Nox4 with the p22phox subunit of the NADPH oxidase occurs. Using confocal microscopy, co-localization of p22phox with Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4 was observed in transiently transfected vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and HEK293 cells. Plasmids coding for fluorescent fusion proteins of p22phox and the Nox proteins with cyan- and yellow-fluorescent protein (cfp and yfp, respectively) were constructed and expressed in VSMC and HEK293 cells. The cfp-tagged p22phox expression level increased upon cotransfection with Nox1 or Nox4. Protein-protein interaction between the fluorescent fusion proteins of p22phox and the Nox partners was observed using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique. Immunoprecipitation of native Nox1 from human VSMC revealed co-precipitation of p22phox. Immunoprecipitation from transfected HEK293 cells revealed co-precipitation of native p22phox with yfp-tagged Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4. Following mutation of a histidine (corresponding to the position 115 in human Nox2) to leucine, this interaction was abolished. Transfection of rat p22phox (but not Noxo1 and Noxa1) increased the radical generation in cells expressing Nox4. We provide evidence that p22phox directly interacts with Nox1 and Nox4, to form an superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase and demonstrate that mutation of the potential heme binding site in the Nox proteins disrupts the complex formation of Nox1 and Nox4 with p22phox.

The phagocyte NADPH oxidase generates superoxide anions (O–2) by reducing molecular oxygen by a transmembrane heterodimer, which carries two hemes and forms a cytochrome b558 complex (1Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vignais P.V. CMLS Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1428-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). This complex functions as a final electron transporter from NADPH to molecular oxygen and consists of a 22-kDa α-subunit (p22phox) and a large β-subunit termed Nox2, formerly known as gp91phox (1Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In human leukocytes, Nox2 is synthesized as a 65-kDa precursor in the Golgi apparatus, whereas mature Nox2 has a molecular mass of 91 kDa because of heavy glycosylation of the protein. The glycosylation pattern, however, has no impact on the function of the protein (3Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 80: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 4Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The anchoring of the hemes in the cytochrome b558 occurs via four histidines located at positions 101, 115, 209, and 222 in Nox2 (5Yu L. Quinn M.T. Cross A.R. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Mutation of any of these histidines, resulting in the loss of a heme in Nox2, leads to a conformational change in the protein and not only prevents O–2 formation but also disrupts the interaction of Nox2 with p22phox (6Biberstine-Kinkade K.J.

Recently, homologues of Nox2 have been identified (7Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D.

Clempus R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: R277-R297Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The homologue Nox1 has been suggested to have a role in the host defense of epithelial cells (11Geiszt M. Lekstrom K. Brenner S. Hewitt S.M. Dana R. Malech H.L. Leto T.L. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and to contribute to signaling leading to hypertrophy and angiogenesis and even tumor formation (7Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S.

Little is known about the functions of Nox4, but high expression of Nox4 has been suggested to induce senescence (8Geiszt M. Kopp J.B. Varnai P. Leto T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8010-8014Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), and evidence indicates that Nox4 may also be involved in redox-mediated signal transduction in mesangial cells (13Gorin Y. Ricono J.M. Kim N.H. Bhandari B. Choudhury G.G. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F219-F229Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), adipocytes (14Mahadev K. Motoshima H. Wu X. Ruddy J.M. Arnold R.S. Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. Goldstein B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1844-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), and endothelial cells (15Ago T. Kitazono T. Ooboshi H. Iyama T. Han Y.H. Takada J. Wakisaka M. Ibayashi S. Utsumi H. Iida M. Circulation. 2004; 109: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). It is well known that Nox2 associates with p22phox in phagocytes. It remains, however, to be determined whether Nox1 and Nox4 are also capable of undergoing such an association with p22phox. Recently, the first indirect evidence for such an interaction has been provided, as the function of Nox1 was observed to depend on the expression of p22phox (16Takeya R. Ueno N. Kami K. Taura M. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Nunoi H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25234-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We set out to determine whether Nox1 and Nox4 exhibit a direct interaction with p22phox and studied the underlying mechanism. This task is, however, complicated by low expression levels of the different Nox homologues and by the lack of specific antibodies, particularly against Nox4. Consequently, plasmids coding for fusion proteins of NADPH oxidase subunits and variants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; yfp, yellow fluorescent protein; cfp, cyan fluorescent protein; HAoSMC, human aortic smooth muscle cells; IP, immunoprecipitation; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. were generated and transiently transfected into different cell types. This approach allows the observation of the tagged proteins by fluorescent microscopy and determination of potential co-localization of the fusion proteins in the cell. Moreover, with the aid of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), protein-protein interaction can be studied using laser scanning microscopy. Finally, specific antibodies directed against the GFP part of the constructs are available and thus allow the detection of the fusion proteins by Western blot analysis and even immunoprecipitation. Generation and Transfection of Fusion Constructs—Plasmids coding for rat full-length p22phox (GenBank™ accession number U18729), rat Nox1 (GenBank™, AF152963), rat Nox2 (GenBank™, AF298656), and rat FLAG-tagged Nox4 (GenBank™, AY027527) were provided by Dr. K. K. Griendling (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). The human p22phox plasmid was a gift from Dr. T. Leto (National Institutes of Health), and mouse Noxa1 and Noxo1 was kindly provided by Dr. B. Banfi (Geneva University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland). pEcfp-N1 and pEyfp-N1, pYFP-MEM, pCFP-ER and pCFP-Endo were purchased from Clontech. Plasmids coding for full-length Nox1 and Nox2, tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (yfp) at the C-terminal end, and full-length p22-phox, tagged with cyan fluorescent protein (cfp) at the C-terminal end, were generated by overlay extension PCR. Full-length Nox4 tagged with yfp was constructed by cloning Nox4 into pEyfp-N1 and subsequently brought into the open reading frame by site-directed mutagenesis. For the fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies, mutants (A206K) exhibiting hydrophilic properties in the GFP variants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis as suggested previously by Zacharias et al. (17Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). H115L mutants of all Nox-yfp constructs and Nox-plasmids were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. All plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. Transfection of HEK293 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) cells was carried out using the conventional calcium phosphate precipitation method. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMC; Clonetics, via Biozym, Hess. Olderdorf, Germany) were transfected using magnetofection of magnetic nanoparticles (Chemicell, Berlin, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions as reported previously by others (18Scherer F. Anton M. Schillinger U. Henke J. Bergemann C. Kruger A. Gansbacher B. Plank C. Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 19Plank C. Schillinger U. Scherer F. Bergemann C. Remy J.S. Krotz F. Anton M. Lausier J. Rosenecker J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out 2 days after transfection. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer containing Tris/HCl (pH 7.4, 20 mm), NaCl (150 mm), Na4P2O7 (10 mm), okadaic acid (10 nm), Na3VO4 (2 mm), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), pepstatin (2 μg/ml), trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (44 μg/ml), and Triton X-100 (1%v/v), left on ice for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. These extracts were used either directly for Western blot analysis or for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments were carried out from the Triton-soluble fraction (500 μg in ∼700 μl), which contained about 30–50% of the total cellular p22phox and Nox content. Following preclearing with protein A/G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), proteins were precipitated using antibodies (1.5 μg) directed against Nox1 (affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal) (20Wingler K. Wunsch S. Kreutz R. Rothermund L. Paul M. Schmidt H.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1456-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), GFP (mouse monoclonal, Roche Applied Science) or p22phox (mouse monoclonal antibody 449, kindly provided by Dr. D. Roos, Sanquin Research at CLB, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands) (21Verhoeven A.J. Bolscher B.G. Meerhof L.J. van Zwieten R. Keijer J. Weening R.S. Roos D. Blood. 1989; 73: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preclearings and post-IP supernatants were loaded on separate gels to confirm specificity of the bands in the immunoprecipitation and to ascertain identical amounts of protein in the IP. The latter was determined by staining for Erk1/2 using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Western Blot Analysis—Protein (20 μg) from Triton-soluble fractions or immunoprecipitates were heated (95 °C, 10 min) in Laemmli buffer, cleared by centrifugation, and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and then blotted onto nitrocellulose. Following blocking in nonfat dry milk (3%), proteins were detected using their respective antibodies. The monoclonal anti-Nox2 antibody α54.1 was kindly supplied by Dr. M. Quinn (Montana State University, Bozeman, MT). The anti-FLAG antibody was purchased from Sigma. Visualization was carried out using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), a commercially available enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences), and x-ray-type photo films (Kodak). Confocal Microscopy and FRET Analysis—HAoSMC or HEK293 cells were seeded on glass coverslips (9 × 9 mm, coated with collagen or fibronectin, respectively) and transiently transfected with the fluorescent fusion construct. 48 h after transfection, the cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde solution (4%), washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and embedded in Dako-Fluoromount (Dako, Hamburg, Germany). Co-localization studies were carried out using a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope LSM 510 META in multi-tracking mode to prevent interference of the dyes. FRET studies were performed at the same machine using living cells and a temperature-controlled setup and the method of acceptor bleaching reported previously by others (22Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 23Karpova T.S. Baumann C.T. He L. Wu X. Grammer A. Lipsky P. Hager G.L. McNally J.G. J. Microsc. 2003; 209: 56-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Briefly, two images were obtained using the multitracking mode (cfp excitation (458 nm); emission detection (475–525 nm), band-pass filter; yfp excitation (514 nm); emission detection (530 nm), long pass filter), high scan speed and low excitation energy. Subsequently, yfp was specifically bleached by the 514-nm laser line, set to high energy using 40 bleaching cycles. After this, two additional images were obtained. Regions of interest were marked in the bleached and nonbleached areas, and the intensity of the cfp fluorescence before and after bleaching was determined. The degree of FRET was expressed as the relative change in intensity of the cfp signal in the bleached region. A plasmid expressing a cfp/yfp-tagged fragment of dystrophin served as a positive control (24Badorff C. Berkely N. Mehrotra S. Talhouk J.W. Rhoads R.E. Knowlton K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11191-11197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Determination of Reactive Oxygen Species Generation—Cells were seeded on 3.5-cm dishes, transiently transfected, and measurements were performed 2 days later. The cells were detached from the dish using phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA and suspended in 100 μl of HEPES-modified Tyrode's solution and transferred to tubes containing 400 μl of HEPES-modified Tyrode's solution and chemiluminescence enhancer. The radical production was determined using a Berthold LB 9505 chemiluminescence counter (Wildbad, Germany). As an enhancer for H2O2, luminol (100 μmol/liter) and horseradish peroxidase (1 unit/ml) was used. Expression of the Fluorescent Fusion Proteins—The NADPH oxidase-GFP fusion proteins were characterized by Western blot analysis. Rat Nox1-yfp, Nox2-yfp, Nox4-yfp, and p22phox-cfp were readily detectable using an anti-gfp antibody. Comparing the molecular mass of the constructs to that of the untagged proteins revealed the expected shift of 27 kDa, the molecular mass of GFP. The fusion proteins derived from the rat Nox sequences generated a distinct band, without signs of a glycosylation smear in HEK293 cells, and the molecular weight displayed equaled the mass predicted from the amino acid sequence (Fig. 1). In contrast, the typical glycosylation smear for Nox2 was detected by the anti-Nox2 antibody in HEK293 cells transfected with a plasmid coding for human Nox2 (Fig. 1E). All fusion proteins generated an additional band slightly smaller than that of YFP, which was recognized by the anti-GFP antibody, indicating that the fusion proteins were degraded to some extent. The anti-Nox1 antibody (20Wingler K. Wunsch S. Kreutz R. Rothermund L. Paul M. Schmidt H.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1456-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) also detected a band of 55 kDa in HEK293 cells, even in nontransfected cells, which corresponded to a strong band observed in Caco-2 cells. The latter cells highly expressed Nox1 and served as a positive control for this protein. As HEK293 cells express Nox1 on the mRNA level (9Cheng G. Cao Z. Xu X. van Meir E.G. Lambeth J.D. Gene. 2001; 269: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), one could speculate whether this signal corresponds to endogenous Nox1 in HEK293 cells. Similar results were obtained using a second Nox1 antibody (data not shown). Cellular Localization of the Fluorescent Fusion Proteins— Expression of p22phox-cfp, as well as Nox1-yfp, Nox2-yfp, and Nox4-yfp in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2) and HAoSMC (data not shown), produced a fluorescence pattern characteristic of cytoskeletal and intracellular membrane association. No interference between the fluorescence of cfp and yfp was observed with the filter setting used. Confocal microscopy of cells co-transfected with p22phox-cfp, together with the different Nox-yfp constructs, revealed marked co-localization of the cfp and yfp fluorescence (HEK293 cells) (Fig. 2) (data not shown). Immunodetection of the fusion proteins using antibodies directed against p22phox, Nox1, and Nox2 yielded co-localization of the fluorescence signals of the fusion proteins to the signal detected by the antibodies (data not shown). The fluorescence fusion proteins largely co-localized with grp-78 (goat polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a marker for endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3A). Co-expression of p22phox-cfp, Nox1-yfp, and Nox4-yfp colocated with the fluorescence obtained by an expression plasmid for a construct targeting cfp to the endoplasmic reticulum (cfp-ER-marker) but not to endosomes (cfp-endo-marker) or the plasma membrane (yfp-mem-marker) (Fig. 3B). To validate that this staining pattern was not a consequence of a disturbed processing of the Noxes due to the fluorescent tag but rather the native localization of the rat proteins in HEK293 cells, untagged rat Nox proteins were expressed and detected by specific antibodies. Using this approach, very similar staining patterns were observed, and no specific expression of p22phox, Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4 in the plasma membrane was observed (Fig. 4).Fig. 3Determination of the intracellular localization of p22phox-cfp and Nox isoforms-yfp fusion proteins.A, HEK293 cells were transfected with Nox2-yfp and p22phox-cfp. The endoplasmic reticulum was stained using an antibody directed against the marker protein grp78 and an appropriate secondary antibody coupled to the dye Alexa-546. Nuclei were stained with Topro-3 iodine (1 μmol/liter). B, transfection of HEK293 cells with either p22phox-cfp (cyan), Nox1-yfp (red), or Nox4-yfp (red) and co-transfection with plasmids coding for the following gfp marker fusion proteins: yfp membrane (yfp-Mem, red), cfp-endosomes (cfp-Endos, cyan), and cfp-endoplasmic reticulum (cfp-ER, cyan).

Transfection of HEK293 cells with plasmids coding for rat p22phox, Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4-FLAG and detection of these nonfluorescent proteins using the appropriate antibodies indicated, as well as a secondary antibody coupled to Alexa-546 nm. In the left panel of A, the nuclei were counterstained using the dye Topro-3 iodine. The plasma membrane was visualized by transfection of yfp membrane. B–D, in the left panels, specific staining of the antibody was depicted using the color red, whereas the background fluorescence, stained green, was used to visualize also the nontransfected cells. In the right panels of A–D, only the specific staining of the antibody used is depicted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Determination of Protein-Protein Interaction by FRET Technique—The FRET technique is becoming a state-of-the-art tool to demonstrate a close (<10-nm) interaction between two proteins (22Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The method of acceptor bleaching, where the light emission of the higher energetic fluorophore is recovered after destruction of the lower energetic energy acceptor, allows the observation of FRET under static conditions (23Karpova T.S. Baumann C.T. He L. Wu X. Grammer A. Lipsky P. Hager G.L. McNally J.G. J. Microsc. 2003; 209: 56-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). During the validation of this method, we observed that even native cfp and yfp, which are thought not to interact, have a tendency to exhibit false positive FRET. Recently, it has been demonstrated that such effects are a consequence of hydrophobic interactions of the GFPs and can be prevented by the introduction of hydrophilic amino acids into the GFP sequence (17Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). Consequently, all studies were performed using the A206K mutants of the GFP variants, which are not prone to such artifacts (17Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). Indeed, transfection of HEK293 cells or VSMC with cfp-A206K, together with yfp-A206 or cfp-A206K with Nox-yfp-A206K, did not yield a significant FRET signal. In contrast, transfection of p22phox-cfp-A206K with Nox1-yfp-A206K, Nox2-yfp-A206K, or Nox4-yfp-A206K resulted in a significant FRET, which was comparable between the Nox homologues studied in both cell types used. Nox-yfp constructs co-transfected with cfp-ER-marker did not result in FRET, demonstrating that the similar spatial distribution of p22phox with the Nox is not responsible for the FRET signal (Fig. 5). p22phox-cfp-A206K did not yield FRET together with yfp-A206K. Stabilization of p22phox by Nox Homologues—Interaction of p22phox with Nox2 in the NADPH oxidase of leukocytes has been shown to stabilize expression of the two proteins. To determine whether such a phenomenon is also evident for Nox1 and Nox4, plasmids coding for the native forms of these two proteins were transfected into HEK293 cells expressing p22phox-cfp. Nox1 and Nox4 both increased p22phox-cfp expression by ∼50% in these cells (Fig. 6). Transfection of yfp or empty vector had no effect on p22phox-cfp expression, excluding vector-vector interaction as a possible mechanism, whereas Nox1-yfp and Nox4-yfp also increased p22phox-cfp expression (Fig. 6). Co-immunoprecipitation of p22phox with Nox Homologues— To demonstrate that such a tight association of p22phox with the Nox homologues, as observed by FRET, also leads to protein interaction, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in HEK293 cells. As this type of cell endogenously expresses p22phox, only Nox-yfp constructs were transfected for this part of the study. This task was complicated by the fact that the heavy and light chains of the immunoglobulins used for immunoprecipitation have molecular weights similar to those of the proteins of interest. With the aid of a mouse monoclonal anti-p22phox and an anti-GFP antibody, p22phox and the different Nox-yfp constructs, respectively, could be immunoprecipitated. Precipitation of p22phox revealed co-precipitation of all three Nox-yfp constructs studied, as observed by a band detected at the expected height by anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 7), as well as by antibodies directed against Nox1 and Nox2 (data not shown). Accordingly, immunoprecipitation of the Nox-yfp constructs by an anti-GFP antibody yielded co-precipitation of endogenous p22phox (Fig. 7). Role of Heme Binding for the Interaction of p22phox with Nox Homologues—Loss of heme binding via exchange of the four histidines at positions 101, 115, 209, and 222 has been shown to disrupt the interaction of p22phox with Nox2. Interestingly, these histidines are highly conserved in all Nox homologues (9Cheng G. Cao Z. Xu X. van Meir E.G. Lambeth J.D. Gene. 2001; 269: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), which may suggest that they are also involved in heme binding in Nox1 and Nox4. In an attempt to study the role of these potentially heme-binding histidines in Nox1 and Nox4, we mutated the histidine at position 115 to leucine in Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4. The introduction of this mutation had no effect on the expression or localization of the Nox-yfp constructs, as determined by Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy (data not shown). Nevertheless, loss of histidine 115 in the Nox-yfp constructs completely prevented the interaction with p22phox; H115L-Nox1-yfp, H115L-Nox2-yfp, and H115L-Nox4-yfp could be immunoprecipitated by anti-GFP antibodies but did not co-precipitate p22phox. Vice versa, immunoprecipitation of p22phox failed to co-precipitate any of the three mutants (Fig. 7). Accordingly, co-transfection of p22phox-cfp with any of the H115L-Nox-yfp constructs did not result in a positive FRET (Fig. 5). Interaction of Nox1 with p22phox in Human Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells—The before-mentioned results suggest that an interaction of p22phox with Nox homologues occurs following transfection; i.e. in a situation of artificially high concentrations of the proteins of interest. To clarify the physiological relevance of this observation, interaction of endogenous Nox1 with p22phox was studied in HAoSMC. Endogenous Nox1 was immunoprecipitated using an affinity-purified rabbit peptide antibody. Interestingly, a protein of ∼75 kDa, which was detected by several anti-Nox1 antibodies directed against different epitopes, was immunoprecipitated by the Nox1 antibody from HAoSMC. Most importantly, p22phox was co-precipitated from HAoSMC by an anti-Nox1 antibody, demonstrating that the interaction of the two components also occurs at physiological protein levels (Fig. 8). Functional Interaction of p22phox with Nox1 and Nox4—In an attempt to demonstrate the functional interaction of p22phox with Nox2 homologues, the native rat plasmids were transfected in HEK293 cells in the presence and absence of rat p22phox and rat p22phox-cfp. As shown in figure 9, transfection of Nox4 into HEK293 cells, which endogenously express human p22phox, significantly increased radical generation. When rat p22phox or rat p22phox-cfp was transfected, H2O2 formation increased further by ∼3-fold. Interestingly, Nox4-dependent H2O2 formation was not affected by co-transfection of mouse Noxa1 and Noxo1 (Fig. 9), whereas these subunits had to be present to facilitate Nox1-dependent radical generation (data not shown). When the H115L mutant of Nox1 was transfected instead of the native constructs, no radical generation was observed, demonstrating that the Nox-p22phox complex (and the heme) is required for functional activity (data not shown). In the present study, we have determined whether a direct interaction of p22phox with Nox1 and Nox4 occurs. We observed that fluorescent constructs of p22phox co-localize with fluorescent Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4 and that this co-localization is so tight, it led to FRET. Moreover, p22phox co-precipitated Nox1-yfp, Nox2-yfp, and Nox4-yfp and vice versa, and this effect was critically dependent on histidine 115 in the Nox proteins. Furthermore, an anti-Nox1 antibody co-precipitated p22phox from native human aortic smooth muscle cells. Finally, p22phox is involved in Nox4-dependent radical formation. These observations demonstrate that the three Nox proteins studied are highly similar in their interaction with p22phox. The Nox1-, Nox2-, and Nox4-yfp fusion proteins expressed in HEK293 cells migrated at the molecular weight calculated from the amino acid sequence, and thus the heavy glycosylation, which is observed for human Nox2 in leukocyte, apparently does not occur in the constructs used. In human Nox2, glycosylation is thought to occur at three sites, positions 132–134, 149–151, and 240–242 (25Wallach T.M. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the current study, plasmids coding for the rat homologues of the oxidase subunit were used. Indeed, it has been reported that these glycosylated residues of Nox2 are not conserved in the rat homologue of the protein (26Bayraktutan U. Blayney L. Shah A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1903-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and transfection of wild-type rat gp91phox also did not exhibit the glycosylation shift. In line with this, it has been observed that, as a consequence of the different glycosylation pattern, the molecular weight of Nox2 varies considerably between species. Nox2 from mice has a molecular mass of only 58 kDa compared with the 91 kDa observed for human Nox2 (3Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 80: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 27Bjorgvinsdottir H. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is controversial whether the endoplasmic reticulum form of Nox2 is associated with p22phox. In leukocytes, this was reported not to be the case (4Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), whereas in nonphagocyte cells overexpressing Nox2 and p22phox cells, similar to the model used in the present study, p22phox and Nox2 already interacted in the ER (4Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Similar observations were made regarding the localization of Nox2 in vascular endothelial cells (26Bayraktutan U. Blayney L. Shah A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1903-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Little is known concerning the intracellular localization of rat Nox homologues and, in particular, regarding the localization of Nox1 and Nox4. In the present study, the fusion proteins exhibited a reticular staining pattern comparable with endoplasmic reticulum and cytoskeletal association. Indeed, some of the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase subunits were found in the Triton-insoluble fraction. 2R. K. Ambasta, unpublished observations. This view is compatible with observations of a tight interaction of the NADPH oxidase with cytoskeletal signaling molecules (28Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. McCormick S. Leidal K.G. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5911-5917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29el Benna J. Ruedi J.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6729-6734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human Nox1, in contrast, is partially localized in the plasma membrane, and this effect might be a consequence of the interaction with an Noxo1 (30Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4737-4742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The main observation of the present study was that not only Nox2, but also Nox1 and Nox4, tightly interact with p22phox. Previously, it has been extensively demonstrated that the interaction of p22phox with Nox2 is required to form a functionally active enzyme in leukocytes (5Yu L. Quinn M.T. Cross A.R. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Recently, it was also demonstrated that co-transfection of p22phox together with Nox1 is required to facilitate Nox1-mediated O–2 generation in CHO-cells, which reportedly lack endogenous p22phox expression (16Takeya R. Ueno N. Kami K. Taura M. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Nunoi H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25234-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that Nox1 is homologous enough to Nox2 that overexpression of Nox1 is able to compensate for the lack of Nox2 in cells derived from patients with chronic granulomatous disease and that Nox1 can be activated by the cytosolic components involved in Nox2 activation (11Geiszt M. Lekstrom K. Brenner S. Hewitt S.M. Dana R. Malech H.L. Leto T.L. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In the present study, we extended this observation by demonstrating that also the rat Nox4-mediated radical production is increased upon transfection of rat p22phox. Interestingly, p22phox appears to be the only subunit required for Nox4-dependent radical generation. Cotransfection of Noxo1 and Noxa1, which are needed to support Nox1-dependent radical generation, was without effect. In the present study, we found no differences between the three rat Nox homologues regarding their ability to bind p22phox and their intracellular localization. Moreover, mutation of Nox histidines, equivalent to position 115 of human Nox2, disrupted p22phox association for all homologues, suggesting that heme binding is similar between the homologues. For the leukocyte oxidase, it has been shown that the heme is centrally important in the interaction of p22phox with Nox2 (4Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, p22phox is not involved in heme binding per se (6Biberstine-Kinkade K.J. DeLeo F.R. Epstein R.I. LeRoy B.A. Nauseef W.M. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31105-31112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Rather, the hemes maintain the tertiary structure of Nox2 in such a way that the interaction with p22phox can occur. The results of the present study suggest that the Nox homologues studied are similar in this regard. Interestingly, almost nothing is known regarding the precise mechanism of p22phox and Nox2 association, and only epitope mapping provides some information regarding the amino acid sequences coming into proximity with each other (31Burritt J.B. DeLeo F.R. McDonald C.L. Prigge J.R. Dinauer M.C. Nakamura M. Nauseef W.M. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol.

Nakamura M. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 45: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Altogether, the function of p22phox is incompletely understood (2Vignais P.V. CMLS Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1428-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The components required for oxidase activity are not located in p22phox. FAD and the hemes are located in the Nox protein. Some controversy exists for the NADPH binding site, which is thought to be positioned in Nox2 (33Koshkin V. Pick E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), whereas others suggest localization in p67phox (34Paclet M.H. Coleman A.W. Vergnaud S. Morel F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9302-9310Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). p22phox is the binding partner of p47phox (35Sumimoto H. Hata K. Mizuki K. Ito T. Kage Y. Sakaki Y. Fukumaki Y. Nakamura M. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22152-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the subunits required for oxidase assembly. Phosphorylation of p22phox in vitro has been demonstrated in the course of activation (36Regier D.S. Greene D.G. Sergeant S. Jesaitis A.J. McPhail L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28406-28412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) but certainly is not central for oxidase activation. In contrast to the Nox homologues, which exhibit tissue-specific expression (9Cheng G. Cao Z. Xu X. van Meir E.G. Lambeth J.D. Gene. 2001; 269: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), p22phox mRNA is widely expressed in high abundance (2Vignais P.V. CMLS Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1428-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 37Parkos C.A. Dinauer M.C. Walker L.E. Allen R.A. Jesaitis A.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), but p22phox protein levels in cells not expressing Nox homologues are low. Moreover, in some forms of chronic granulomatous disease, where Nox2 protein is not synthesized, p22phox protein is undetectable. Most likely the p22phox monomer is rapidly degraded, whereas heterodimer formation with Nox2 prevents this process (1Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vignais P.V. CMLS Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1428-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed that Nox1 and Nox4 also have the capacity to stabilize p22phox expression, as transfection of either wild-type or yfp-tagged Nox1 or Nox4 increased the expression of p22phox-cfp. The mechanism underlying this stabilization has not been determined so far, but it is important to realize that p22phox mRNA expression is not the limiting factor for p22phox protein expression and thus for the formation of the active cytochrome b558. Consequently, endogenous p22phox expression in HEK293 cells (which apparently also express Nox1 to Nox5 endogenously, see Ref. 9Cheng G. Cao Z. Xu X. van Meir E.G. Lambeth J.D. Gene. 2001; 269: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) was sufficient to form complexes with the Nox constructs transfected in the present study. In conclusion, in the present study we have demonstrated that p22phox forms complexes with Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4 and that mutation of histidine 115 in these Nox proteins disrupts the complex formation.

https://openalex.org/W2003890494,"Alzheimer's disease-associated β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) are generated by the sequential proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases. There is growing evidence that cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains are involved in regulating trafficking and processing of APP. BACE1, the major β-secretase in neurons is a palmitoylated transmembrane protein that resides in lipid rafts. A subset of APP is subject to amyloidogenic processing by BACE1 in lipid rafts, and this process depends on the integrity of lipid rafts. Here we describe the association of all four components of the γ-secretase complex, namely presenilin 1 (PS1)-derived fragments, mature nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2, with cholesterol-rich detergent insoluble membrane (DIM) domains of non-neuronal cells and neurons that fulfill the criteria of lipid rafts. In PS1-/-/PS2-/- and NCT-/- fibroblasts, γ-secretase components that still remain fail to become detergent-resistant, suggesting that raft association requires γ-secretase complex assembly. Biochemical evidence shows that subunits of the γ-secretase complex and three TGN/endosome-resident SNAREs cofractionate in sucrose density gradients, and show similar solubility or insolubility characteristics in distinct non-ionic and zwitterionic detergents, indicative of their co-residence in membrane microdomains with similar protein-lipid composition. This notion is confirmed using magnetic immunoisolation of PS1- or syntaxin 6-positive membrane patches from a mixture of membranes with similar buoyant densities following Lubrol WX extraction or sonication, and gradient centrifugation. These findings are consistent with the localization of γ-secretase in lipid raft microdomains of post-Golgi and endosomes, organelles previously implicated in amyloidogenic processing of APP.

Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative dementing disorder, is pathologically characterized by the cerebral deposition of 39–42 amino acid peptides termed β-amyloid (Aβ) 1The abbreviations used are: Aβ, β-amyloid; APP, amyloid precursor protein; PS, presenilin(s); NTF, N-terminal fragment; CTF, C-terminal fragment; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TGN, trans-Golgi network; CHAPSO, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid; DIM, detergent-insoluble membrane; GTEL, Golgi/TGN/endosomes/lysosome-enriched membranes; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol. peptides. Aβ is generated by the sequential processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol.

BACE1, a transmembrane aspartyl protease is the major β-secretase, which cleaves APP within the extracellular/luminal domain, generating the N terminus of Aβ (3Vassar R. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2004; 23: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). A multimeric complex made of four transmembrane proteins is responsible for executing intramembraneous γ-secretase cleavage of APP C-terminal fragments (CTF) and releasing Aβ (4Iwatsubo T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Genetic mutations in the APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes are responsible for familial early-onset Alzheimer's disease (5Price D.L. Tanzi R.E. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. Annu. Rev.

PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode polytopic membrane proteins presenilin 1 (PS1) and PS2, respectively, which as components of the γ-secretase complex play essential role in Aβ production (7De Strooper B.

Considerable evidence suggests that familial Alzheimer's disease-linked PS1 and PS2 (PS) variants exert their pathogenic influence by selectively elevating the levels of highly fibrillogenic Aβ42 peptides (2Sisodia S.S. St George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 4Iwatsubo T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition to APP proteolysis, PS play a crucial role in the intramembraneous γ-secretase cleavage of select type I membrane proteins including the homologues of APP (APLP1 and APLP2), Notch1, and homologues, Notch ligands Delta and Jagged, ErbB-4, CD44, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, N- and E-cadherins, nectin-1α, DCC, p75 neurotrophin receptor, etc. (see Ref. 9Thinakaran G. Parent A.T. Pharmacol. Res. 2004; 50: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition to the growing number of γ-secretase substrates, accumulating evidence from protein interaction and loss of function studies suggest that, aside from Aβ production, PS regulate diverse physiological functions (reviewed in Ref. 9Thinakaran G. Parent A.T. Pharmacol. Res. 2004; 50: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is evident from recent studies that γ-secretase is a multi-protein complex comprised of PS1 (or PS2)-derived N- and C-terminal fragments (NTF and CTF), nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2 (10Takasugi N.

Nicastrin is a type I membrane protein, and PEN-2 and APH-1 are predicted to span the membrane two and eight times, respectively. Results from gene knockout and knockdown studies reveal that γ-secretase components assist each other during biogenesis and exit out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and all four components are required to undergo proper post-translational maturation and achieve stability (reviewed in Ref. 13De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). APH-1 is presumed to have a role in the initial assembly and maturation of PS-nicastrin complexes (14Gu Y.

There has been considerable epidemiological interest in the relationship between cholesterol and susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (26Puglielli L. Tanzi R.E. Kovacs D.M. Nat.

Cholesterol is the major sterol component in most mammalian membranes. Growing evidence implicates specialized cellular membrane microdomains rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, termed lipid rafts, in a number of important biological functions (28Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar). DIM lipid rafts contribute to trafficking of proteins and lipids in the secretory and endocytic pathways by regulating vesicle sorting and formation (29Ikonen E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs in cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched DIM domains. First, DIMs were found to be the principal compartment containing monomeric and oligomeric Aβ in brain (30Lee S.J. Liyanage U. Bickel P.E. Xia W. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Kosik K.S. Nat.

Second, experimental manipulations that result in cholesterol loading and depletion, or affect intracellular cholesterol transport, modulate Aβ production in cultured cells and animal models (26Puglielli L.

Interestingly, a recent study reported that γ-secretase cleavage occurs in lipid rafts, but γ-secretase catalytic activity is independent of the presence of cholesterol (38Wada S.

Thus, it appears that APP processing within cholesterol-rich lipid rafts by secretases, and not the cholesterol levels per se, determines the levels of Aβ production. In this study, we have provided the first detailed characterization of lipid raft association of each of the components of γ-secretase, the enzyme, which plays an essential role in Alzheimer's disease-associated Aβ production. We report cholesterol-dependent association of significant amounts of each of the γ-secretase components to lipid rafts. Moreover, by subcellular fractionation, confocal microscopy, and immunoisolation methods, we show that endogenous PS1, nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2 associate with raft microdomains in post-Golgi and endosome membranes enriched in syntaxin 6, syntaxin 13, and VAMP4. These findings provide novel insights into the subcellular localization of γ-secretase, which has important implications in understanding the regulation of amyloidogenic processing of APP.

Cy2-, or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. Lipid Raft Isolation—Lipid rafts were isolated from nearly confluent cells grown in two 100-mm dishes as described previously (47Roper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 48Brugger B. Graham C. Leibrecht I. Mombelli E. Jen A. Wieland F. Morris R. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 1.5 ml of lysis buffer containing different detergents: 0.5% Lubrol WX (Lubrol 17A17; Serva) or 0.5% Brij-96V (Fluka) in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA; 1% CHAPSO (Amresco) in 25 mm MES (pH 6.5) and 150 mm NaCl (MBS buffer); or 1% Triton X-100 in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 140 mm NaCl. All the lysis buffers were supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were homogenized by five passages through a 25-gauge needle. Lysates were adjusted to 45% final concentration of sucrose (final volume, 4 ml) and transferred to a 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous sucrose gradient is then formed by sequentially layering 35% sucrose (4 ml) and 5% sucrose (4 ml), and the tubes were subject to ultracentrifugation at 39,000 rpm for 19 h in Beckman SW41 rotor at 4 °C. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient using a fraction collector and equal volume of each fraction was analyzed by Western blotting. In some cases samples were concentrated by methanol/chloroform precipitation, or subject to immunoprecipitation before analysis. Mouse primary neurons were lysed in buffer containing 1% Lubrol WX in MES-buffered saline containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C and DIM were prepared as previously described (47Roper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts were also isolated using a non-detergent method as described previously (50Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown to confluency were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 2 ml of ice-cold MBS buffer containing 0.5 m sodium carbonate and protease inhibitors. Cells were disrupted on ice by Dounce homogenization (15 strokes) followed by sonication using 130 watt Ultrasonic Processor (Model GE130) set at amplitude 50 (twelve 5-s bursts). This homogenate was then subjected to fractionation as described above in sucrose gradient containing 250 mm sodium carbonate. Subcellular Fractionation—Cells from two 100-mm dishes were homogenized using a ball-bearing homogenizer with a 12 μm clearance and postnuclear supernatants were fractionated on sucrose density gradients as described previously (18Greenfield J.P. Tsai J. Gouras G.K. Hai B. Thinakaran G. Checler F. Sisodia S.S. Greengard P. Xu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient using a fractionator, and 60 μl of each fraction were analyzed by Western blotting. To isolate lipid rafts from post-Golgi and endosome membranes, fraction 6 (enriched in Golgi/TGN/endosome/lysosome markers) from four gradients were pooled, diluted with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 5 mm EDTA, and subject to centrifugation at 27,000 rpm for1hat4 °Cina SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments). The resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in 0.5% Lubrol WX in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm EDTA, homogenized by five passages through a 25-gauge needle, and subject to flotation density gradient centrifugation as described above. Immunoisolation of Raft Patches Using Magnetic Beads—Monoclonal antibody syntaxin 6, and affinity-purified PS1NT and αPS1Loop antibodies were bound to Dynabeads M-280 beads pre-coated with sheep anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Dynal) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibody OKT8 (recognizes CD8α) and affinity-purified polyclonal antibody STC261 (recognizes a luminal protein that is processed through the secretory pathway) were used as negative controls to establish the specificity of the immunoisolation procedure. Pooled lipid raft fractions 4 and 5 generated from Lubrol WX or non-detergent lysates were incubated with primary antibody-coated magnetic beads for 5 h with continuous slow rotation at 4 °C. Bound immunocomplexes were captured using a magnetic device and washed four times in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl, and eluted in Laemmli buffer. Bound immunocomplexes and an aliquot of the input were analyzed by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence Labeling—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts or HeLa cells cultured on glass coverslips were fixed as described previously (51Hammond A.T. Glick B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3013-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 3% bovine serum albumin. Confocal images were acquired with a 100× oil immersion objective using a Zeiss laser scanning microscope (Pascal 5) and processed using MetaMorph software. PS1 and Mature Nicastrin Are Present in Lubrol WX-insoluble Lipid Rafts—In order to gain mechanistic insights into the amyloidogenic processing of APP in detergent insoluble buoyant membrane domains, we undertook studies to determine the localization of endogenous γ-secretase components within lipid rafts of cultured cells. Previous studies have reported the presence of PS1 derivatives in membrane domains resistant to extraction with certain detergents, indicative of raft localization (30Lee S.J. Liyanage U. Bickel P.E.

https://openalex.org/W1970974410,"Guggulsterone, derived from Commiphora mukul and used to treat obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and osteoarthritis, has been recently shown to antagonize the farnesoid X receptor and decrease the expression of bile acid-activated genes. Because activation of NF-κB has been closely linked with inflammatory diseases affected by guggulsterone, we postulated that it must modulate NF-κB activation. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by investigating the effect of this steroid on the activation of NF-κB induced by inflammatory agents and carcinogens. Guggulsterone suppressed DNA binding of NF-κB induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), phorbol ester, okadaic acid, cigarette smoke condensate, hydrogen peroxide, and interleukin-1. NF-κB activation was not cell type-specific, because both epithelial and leukemia cells were inhibited. Guggulsterone also suppressed constitutive NF-κB activation expressed in most tumor cells. Through inhibition of IκB kinase activation, this steroid blocked IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, thus suppressing p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription induced by TNF, TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, and IKK was also blocked by guggulsterone but without affecting p65-mediated gene transcription. In addition, guggulsterone decreased the expression of gene products involved in anti-apoptosis (IAP1, xIAP, Bfl-1/A1, Bcl-2, cFLIP, and survivin), proliferation (cyclin D1 and c-Myc), and metastasis (MMP-9, COX-2, and VEGF); this correlated with enhancement of apoptosis induced by TNF and chemotherapeutic agents. Overall, our results indicate that guggulsterone suppresses NF-κB and NF-κB-regulated gene products, which may explain its anti-inflammatory activities."
https://openalex.org/W2009838390,"Previous studies show that feedback inhibition of bile acid production by bile acids is mediated by multiple mechanisms, including activation of pregnane X receptor (PXR). Consistent with these studies, the antibiotic rifampicin, a ligand for human PXR, reduces hepatic bile acid levels in cholestasis patients. To delineate the mechanisms underlying PXR-mediated suppression of bile acid biosynthesis, we examined the functional cross-talk between human PXR and HNF-4, a key hepatic activator of genes involved in bile acid biosynthesis including the cholesterol 7-α hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and sterol 12-α hydroxylase (CYP8B1) genes. Treatment with rifampicin resulted in repression of endogenous human CYP7A1 expression in HepG2 cells that was reversed by PXR small interfering RNA. The coactivator PGC-1 enhanced transcriptional activity of HNF-4, and this enhancement was suppressed by rifampicin-activated PXR. Endogenous PGC-1 from mouse liver extracts bound to PXR, and recombinant PGC-1 directly interacted with both PXR and HNF-4 in vitro. Rifampicin-dependent interaction of PXR with PGC-1 was shown in cells by coimmunoprecipitation, and intranuclear localization studies using confocal microscopy provided further evidence for this interaction. In chromatin immunoprecipitation studies, rifampicin treatment did not inhibit HNF-4 binding to the native promoters of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 but resulted in dissociation of PGC-1 and concomitant gene repression. Most interestingly, these rifampicin effects were also observed in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene that contains a functional HNF-4-binding site and is central to hepatic gluconeogenesis. Our study suggests that ligand-activated PXR interferes with HNF-4 signaling by targeting the common coactivator PGC-1, which underlies physiologically relevant inhibitory cross-talk between drug metabolism and cholesterol/glucose metabolism.

Cholesterol 7-α hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and sterol 12-α hydroxylase (CYP8B1) are hepatic enzymes in the neutral pathway for the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids and thus play key roles in cholesterol/bile acid homeostasis (1Zhang M.

Bioactivities of these enzymes are negatively regulated at the level of transcription by the end products of the pathway, bile acids.

In in vivo chromatin studies, we further demonstrated that bile acid-induced SHP recruits an mSin3A-Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex to the native human CYP7A1 promoter, leading to remodeling of the promoter chromatin and concomitant gene repression (5Kemper J. Kim H. Miao J. Bhalla S. Bae Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7707-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although a central role for SHP in this negative regulation of bile acid production has been shown, recent knock-out mouse studies imply that there are additional bile acid-mediated regulatory mechanisms independent of SHP, including activation of mouse pregnane X receptor (PXR) by ligands such as secondary toxic bile acids (6Kerr T.

Treatment with pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile (PCN), a specific ligand for mouse PXR, has also been shown to repress CYP7A1 transcription in mice (8Staudinger J. Goodwin B. Jones S. Hawkins-Brown D.

Furthermore, this CYP7A1 repression was no longer observed in PXR knock-out mice, indicating that PCN-activated PXR mediates suppression of bile acid production (8Staudinger J. Goodwin B. Jones S.

Consistent with these animal studies, administration of the antibiotic rifampicin has been reported to reduce significantly hepatic bile acid levels in cholestatic patients. Thus, rifampicin has been used as a therapeutic agent for pruritus associated with intrahepatic cholestasis (10Hofmann A.F. Gut. 2002; 51: 756-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recently, human PXR was cloned, and rifampicin was identified as a specific ligand for human PXR, implying that activated PXR may be associated with reduced bile acid levels in liver. These clinical observations and experimental studies indicate that ligand-activated PXR reduces hepatic bile acid levels by suppressing CYP7A1 expression, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not known. A possible mechanism for PXR-mediated repression is inhibition of signaling pathway by HNF-4, a key activator of basal expression of CYP7A1 (3Chiang J.Y.L. Endocr.

HNF-4 is a master transcriptional activator for a large number of genes in hepatocytes and pancreatic cells. By using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and promoter microarrays, Young and co-workers (21Odom D.T. Zizlsperger N. Gordon D.B. Bell G.W. Rinaldi N.J. Murray H.L. Volkert T.L.

HNF-4 is central to cholesterol and glucose/energy metabolism because it is a key activator for basal hepatic expression of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 genes and glucose-6-phosphatase and PEPCK genes, which play central roles in bile acid biosynthesis and hepatic gluconeogenesis, respectively (1Zhang M.

By using CYP7A1, CYP8B1, and PEPCK genes as model systems, we have studied molecular mechanisms by which human PXR suppresses hepatic bile acid production and gluconeogenesis. Here we show that ligand-activated PXR attenuates HNF-4 signaling by competing for the common coactivator PGC-1 in hepatic cells and thus causes dissociation of endogenous PGC-1 from HNF-4-bound promoter chromatin, resulting in concomitant gene repression. Our study implies that inhibitory cross-talk mediated by these orphan nuclear receptors may be physiologically relevant in drug and cholesterol/glucose metabolism. Cell Culture—Human hepatic cells (HepG2, ATCC HB8065) were maintained in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) media supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G/streptomycin sulfate and 10% heat-inactivated charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293 from ATCC) and monkey kidney COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media. HepG2 cells were treated with 10 μm rifampicin, 75 μm CDCA (Sigma), 100 μm LCA, and 10 μm PCN for 2–24 h in serum-free media. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using Trizol; cDNA was synthesized, and semi-quantitative PCR was carried out. Sequences for the primers are as follows: forward primer, 5′-ctaaggaggatttcacttgc-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-actggtccaaaggtggacat-3′ for CYP7A1; forward primer, 5′-caagaagattctgctggagg-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-ggatgtcaacatctccaatg-3′, for SHP; forward primer, 5′-aagcatggggatgtgttcac-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-caaacttgcggaactccatg-3′, for CYP8B1; forward primer, 5′-tgcccagtatggagatgtgt-3′, and reverse primer 5′-aattgattgggccacgagct-3′, for CYP3A4; forward primer, 5′-gatgagccgctagcttca-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-ttgccgaagttgtagcca-3′, for PEPCK; and forward primer, 5′-gtcatcaccattggcaatgag-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-cgtcatactcctgcttgctg-3′, for β-actin. Amplifications of 20–22, 26–28, 29–31, 31–32, 29–31, and 30–32 cycles were performed for β-actin, SHP, CYP7A1, CYP8B1, CYP3A4, and PEPCK, respectively. Plasmid Construction—SUPER vectors encoding PXR siRNA were constructed by ligation of a 64-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide containing 5′-gatccccggccactggctatcacttcttcaagagagaagtgatagccagtggcctttttggaaa-3′ into the pSUPER vector (Oligoengine) digested with BglII and HindIII.

Briefly, the DNA probe was a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing either the BARE II region of CYP7A1 or the PBRU region of CYP2B6/CYP2B1, and 5,000–10,000 cpm were added to each reaction. Various amounts of HNF-4, PXR, and RXR were added to the reaction buffer (30 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 4 mm DTT) in the presence of 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a final volume of 20 μl. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the resulting protein-DNA complexes were fractionated on a nondenaturing acrylamide gel. For competition assays, a molar excess (6.25 to 100×) of unlabeled double strand oligonucleotides containing either the DR4 motif or BARE II region was added 5 min before the addition of the probe. GST and FLAG Pull Down Assays—GST fusion proteins, GST-HNF-4, GST-PXR, or FLAG-PXR, were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-RIL (DE3 (pLys)) and purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) or M2-agarose. 35S-Labeled proteins were synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation (TnT kit, Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reticulocyte lysates were precleared by incubation with GST-bound glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 30 min. One μg of GST or GST fusion protein was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 4 μl of the precleared reticulocyte lysate containing the labeled proteins in 100 μl of binding buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 0.25% Nonidet P-40) in the presence of protease inhibitors. After the incubation, the samples were extensively washed and eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione, and the eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography. For FLAG affinity pull downs, 1 μg of FLAG-PXR immobilized to M2-agarose, or M2-agarose was incubated with 500 μg of mouse liver nuclear extracts in incubation buffer at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing five times with incubation buffer, proteins associated with FLAG-PXR were eluted and detected by Western blotting using antisera against PGC-1 (sc-13067). Coimmunoprecipitation Assays—HepG2 cells were transfected with either G4DBD or G4DBDPXR by using electroporation, and after 48 h, the cells were treated with either Me2SO or 10 μm rifampicin for 2 h and subjected to coimmunoprecipitation as described (5Kemper J. Kim H. Miao J. Bhalla S. Bae Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7707-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm K+-Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors). After incubation on ice for 10 min followed by sonication and centrifugation, cell extracts were precleared by incubation with 60 μl of a 25% protein A-Sepharose slurry for 30 min at 4 °C and were then incubated with 3–5 μg of either IgG or Gal4 DBD antisera for 4 h to overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by incubation with 30 μl of a 25% protein A-Sepharose slurry for 1 h followed by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and subjected to Western blotting. Me2SO or 10 μm rifampicin was added during immunoprecipitation and washing steps. Subnuclear Localization Study Using Confocal Microscopy—COS-1 cells were grown on glass coverslips in 6-well plates and cotransfected with either 0.5 μg of GFP or GFPPXR along with expression plasmids for PGC-1 or empty vector. After 24 h, cells were treated with 10 μm rifampicin or Me2SO for 3–4 h in serum-free media. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, mounted with mounting medium that contained propidium iodide, and subjected to confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—ChIP assays were performed as described elsewhere (5Kemper J. Kim H. Miao J. Bhalla S. Bae Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7707-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, HepG2 cells, treated with either 10 μm rifampicin or Me2SO in serum-free media for 6 h, were incubated with 1% formaldehyde at 25 °C for 10 min and subjected to sonication to reduce DNA length to 0.3–1.0 kb. Chromatin was precleared in the presence of 20 μl of normal serum, 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 80 μl of a 25% protein A-agarose slurry. Precleared chromatin samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation at 4 °C overnight in the presence of 6 μg of antisera for PGC-1 (sc-13067), HNF-4 (sc-8987), or normal rabbit serum. After collecting the complex by incubation with 60 μl of a 25% protein A-Sepharose slurry and centrifugation, the beads were washed five times as described (35Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar), and the chromatin immune complex was eluted. After reversing the cross-links, DNA was purified and used as a template in PCR. Semi-quantitative PCR was performed using primer sets specific for the CYP7A1 promoter (forward, 5′-gatatctatgcccatcttaaacagg-3′, and reverse, 5′-gaattcgggaaggatgccactg-3′), a control region from +860 to +1160 in the CYP7A1 (forward, 5′-gaaccacctctagagaatg-3′, and reverse, 5′-gaatctccacataaggataac-3′), the CYP8B1 promoter (forward, 5′-aggtgcaagagctgtctgaa-3′, and reverse, 5′-atggctatgctcctgcggat-3′), and the PEPCK (forward, 5′-gcacagagcagacaatcaat-3′, and reverse, 5′-gacacaacttccaactgact-3′).

A possible peripherin involvement in ALS pathogenesis has been suggested based on studies with transgenic mouse overexpressors and with a toxic splicing variant of the mouse peripherin gene. However, the existence of peripherin gene mutations in human ALS has not yet been documented. Therefore, we screened for sequence variants of the peripherin gene (PRPH) in a cohort of ALS patients including familial and sporadic cases. We identified 18 polymorphic variants of PRPH detected in both ALS and age-matched control populations. Two additional PRPH variants were discovered in ALS cases but not in 380 control individuals. One variant consisted of a nucleotide insertion in intron 8 (PRPHIVS8–36insA), whereas the other one consisted of a 1-bp deletion within exon 1 (PRPH228delC), predicting a truncated peripherin species of 85 amino acids. Remarkably, expression of this frameshift peripherin mutant in SW13 cells resulted in disruption of neurofilament network assembly. These results suggest that PRPH mutations may be responsible for a small percentage of ALS, cases and they provide further support of the view that neurofilament disorganization may contribute to pathogenesis.

Bradley W.G. Ann. Neurol. 1985; 18: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Dysfunction and death of these motor neurons lead to progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, and ultimately paralysis and death, usually within 3–5 years after disease onset (2Mulder D.W. Kurland L.T. Offord K.P. Beard C.M. Neurology. 1986; 36: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The disease occurs in sporadic (SALS) and familial (FALS) forms with an estimated incidence of ∼2 per 100,000. Although most cases of ALS are sporadic, some families demonstrate a clinically indistinguishable form of ALS with clear Mendelian inheritance and high penetrance (FALS). Mutations in the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase gene (SOD1), a ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved metalloenzyme, are responsible for ∼15% of FALS (3Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D.

The ALS2 gene is ubiquitously expressed, and it encodes a protein having multiple motifs with homology to guanine nucleotide exchange factor. To date, there are over 90 different missense mutations that have been reported (www.alsod.org) in the SOD1 gene and up to eight described mutations in the ALS2 gene (5Hadano S. Hand C.K. Osuga H.

However, the mechanism by which mutant SOD1 induces motor neuron cell death remains unclear. A hallmark of motor neurons in ALS is the presence of perikaryal and axonal inclusion bodies composed of intermediate filament (IF) proteins, namely neurofilament and peripherin proteins (13Carpenter S. Neurology. 1968; 18: 841-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Corbo M. Hays A.P. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1992; 51: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 15Migheli A. Pezzulo T. Attanasio A. Schiffer D. Lab. Investig. 1993; 68: 185-191PubMed Google Scholar). Neurofilaments, the major type of IFs expressed in adult neurons, are formed by the co-assembly of three type IV IF proteins, the neurofilament light (NF-L), neurofilament medium (NF-M), and neurofilament heavy (NF-H) subunits. Peripherin is a type III IF protein expressed predominantly in the peripheral nervous system with low levels detectable in spinal motor neurons (16Escurat M. Djabali K. Gumpel M. Gros F. Portier M.M. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 764-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Brody B.A. Ley C.A. Parysek L.M. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 2391-2401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Parysek L.M. Chisholm R.L. Ley C.A. Goldman R.D. Neuron. 1988; 1: 395-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Peripherin expression is increased after neuronal injury (19Troy C.M. Muma N.A. Greene L.A. Price D.L. Shelanski M.L. Brain Res. 1990; 529: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 20Wong J. Oblinger M.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 27: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The peripherin gene (PRPH) comprises nine exons spanning a 3.5-kb region of chromosome 12. The full-length peripherin protein contains 471 amino acids. Peripherin shows similarity in sequence to proteins of the IF family. The IF proteins share a central rod domain comprising 310 residues characterized by the presence of coiled-coil α-helices (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B) connected by short linkers. The rod domain is flanked by an N-terminal nonhelical head domain of variable length and a C-terminal tail domain tail, which is also non-helical with great length variation between different IF proteins. Currently, it remains unclear to what extent IF abnormalities contribute to ALS pathogenesis. Codon deletions or insertions in the KSP phosphorylation domain of NF-H have been detected in a small number of sporadic cases of ALS, ∼1% of total cases (21Figlewicz D.A. Krizus A. Martinoli M.G.

Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 3967-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown how these NF-H variants might predispose to ALS. There is growing evidence for potential peripherin involvement in human disease. Overexpression of peripherin induced motor neuron disease in transgenic mice (24Beaulieu J.-M. Nguyen M.D. Julien J.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and it provoked the death of cultured motor neurons (25Robertson J. Beaulieu J.M. Doroudchi M.M. Durham H.D. Julien J.P. Mushynski W.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, an up-regulation of peripherin mRNA has recently been detected in a familial ALS case (26Robertson J. Doroudchi M.M. Nguyen M.D. Durham H.D. Strong M.J. Shaw G. Julien J.P. Mushynski W.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 939-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Under certain conditions, including in mice expressing a mutant form of superoxide dismutase linked to ALS, the mouse peripherin gene was found to produce a splicing peripherin species that is assembly-incompetent and toxic when expressed in cultured neuronal cells (26Robertson J. Doroudchi M.M. Nguyen M.D. Durham H.D. Strong M.J. Shaw G. Julien J.P. Mushynski W.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 939-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of peripherin in ALS has recently been called into question because neither up-regulation nor suppression of all peripherin isoforms had any effect on disease onset, mortality, and loss of motor neurons in mice expressing mutant SOD1 (27Lariviere R.C. Beaulieu J.M. Nguyen M.D. Julien J.P. Neurobiol. Dis. 2003; 13: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To further examine the possible involvement of peripherin in ALS, we screened the peripherin gene (PRPH) for sequence variations in sporadic and familial ALS cases from North American and European origins. Out of 20 identified PRPH variants, two were detected only in ALS cases and not in age-matched controls. Of particular interest is the discovery of a PRPH frameshift deletion mutant, the expression of which disrupted neurofilament assembly in cultured cells. Patient and Control Samples—All patients were assessed by expert clinicians, and they gave written informed consent. Diagnosis of ALS was made according to El Escorial ALS diagnostic criteria (35Brooks B.R. J. Neurol. Sci. 1994; 124: 96-107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). The FALS panel comprised French (n = 23) samples as well as French-Canadian (n = 10) and North American (n = 7) patients. The SALS sample set comprised French (n = 95) and French-Canadian (n = 54) samples. The FALS cohort exhibited a mean age of onset of 49 years, and the SALS cohort exhibited a mean age of onset of 56 years. Both SALS and FALS cohorts showed a mean disease duration of 4.5 years (see Table I). An initial set of age-match control samples (n = 95) came from non-ALS French individuals. Additional control samples were screened to increase to the power of our analysis and comprised another set of age-match French controls (n = 95).Table IClinical information of the studied ALS cohortPatientTotalMale/FemaleAge of onsetaMean age of onset (with lowest and highest values in parentheses).Spinal onsetbSpinal/bulbar onset information were not available for all the patient.Bulbar onsetbSpinal/bulbar onset information were not available for all the patient.DurationSALS15098/5256 (23-82)62234.5FALS4018/2249 (37-60)944.5a Mean age of onset (with lowest and highest values in parentheses).b Spinal/bulbar onset information were not available for all the patient. Open table in a new tab Variant Detection and Genotyping—DNA was extracted from whole blood and/or transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines using standard procedures. Primers were designed using Lazergene software and synthesized by Invitrogen. Thirteen overlapping primer pairs were designed from genomic DNA to amplify each intron and exon of the PRPH gene including the flanking splice sites and promoter as well of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (see Fig. 1). Products were PCR-amplified, checked on agarose gels, and then sequenced using the forward primer for all of the amplicons. The PCR fragment sequence variations were also sequenced on the reverse strands. The PCR primer pair sequences will be given upon request. Restriction Digest Analysis of Variants—Genotyping of the IVS1 + 69G → C and IVS2–78A → C variants was performed by restriction enzyme digestion analysis. The presence of the IVS1 + 69G → C and IVS2–78A → C variants creates new restriction sites, and amplified PCR fragments were digested with MboII and BamHI, respectively, to identify each of these two variations in the control population. Statistical Analysis—We assessed differences in the distribution of each genotype between the groups (sporadic ALS, familial ALS, and control) by calculating the χ-square contingency test, from which we derived p values with one degree of freedom. DNA Constructs—A 4.1-kb fragment was obtained by PCR amplification of the human PRPH gene. PCR was performed on DNA extracted from a patient blood sample by using PROOFSTART Taq (Qiagen) and the primers 5′-untranslated region, 5′-TGGGGCCTAAGCCAGGTCAACTCT-3′ and 3′-untranslated region, 5′-CTTTGAGCAGGCCTAGGGCAGAGT-3′ for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min. PCR product was cloned using TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The cloned PRPH PCR fragment was then subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA™3.1 (Invitrogen) between the NotI site and the HindIII site of the multiple cloning sites. The cloned PRPH PCR fragments were direct sequenced using the primers described above. Transient Transfection Assays—Sw13vim(–) cells lacking cytoplasmic IFs were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. One μgofDNA from each of these constructs was used: peripherinmouse, peripherin228delC, peripherinIVS8–36insA. Human NF-L and rat NF-M described by Beaulieu et al. (28Beaulieu J.M. Robertson J. Julien J.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) were also co-transfected into the cells with each of the peripherin clones to investigate their co-assembly properties with the peripherin gene product. SW13vim(–) cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min and blocked for 1 h in 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. Immunocytochemistry was performed using antibodies recognizing peripherin (monoclonal antibody MAB1527; polyclonal antibodies AB1530) and polyclonal antibodies to NF-L (AB1983) and NF-M (AB1982), all from Chemicon International, Inc., and used at 1:1000 diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Antibody recognizing vimentin intermediate filament from BD Biosciences (catalog number 550513) was used at 1:500. Antibody distribution was visualized by epifluorescence microscopy after incubation with secondary antibodies, anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (green) or 594 (red) (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:250 for 2 h at room temperature and mounted in Prolong (Molecular Probes). Genetic Screen of Peripherin Gene—DNA samples from 40 unrelated FALS cases (non-SOD1 and non-ALS2 cases) and 54 unrelated SALS cases were initially screened for peripherin sequence variations. Another set of samples from 95 non-related SALS cases was also examined to increase the power of our analysis when it was not possible to confirm or exclude association between PRPH and ALS. Clinical information of the studied ALS cohort is provided in Table I. A total of 20 sequence variations were detected within the peripherin gene (PRPH) of 189 ALS patients (Fig. 1A and Table II). Seven sequence variations occurred within coding regions, and one occurred in the 5′-untranslated mRNA region. The remaining 12 sequence variants were found within introns or within the promoter region of the gene. Seventeen sequence variants consisted of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Of the remaining PRPH variants, one had a deletion of a single cytosine in exon 1, and two had a single nucleotide insertion of either guanine or adenine in the 5′-untranslated region and intron 8, respectively.Table IIDetails, location and genomic context of each sequence variantsVariantExon or Intron No.Amino Acid ChangesFrequency, No. (%)P ValueFALSP ValueSALSP ValuecombinedFALSSALSControl%Coding25G → A1Arg → Gln1/80 (1.3)1/108 (1.0)8/380 (2.1)0.6160.4210.37462C → T1No1/80 (1.3)2/108 (1.9)7/380 (1.8)0.7130.9950.834228delC1No0/80 (0)1/300 (0.3)0/380 (0)420G → T1Asp → Tyr0/80 (0)3/108 (1.5)2/380 (0.5)0.5150.2330.427829G → A4Ala → Thr1/80 (1.3)2/108 (1.9)4/190 (2.1)0.6340.8810.7571083C → G6No1/80 (1.3)1/108 (2.8)4/190 (2.1)0.6340.4460.4491107A → G6No11/80 (13.8)18/108 (16.7)38/190 (20)0.2240.4790.2445′UTR-24G → C1NA1/80 (1.3)0/108 (0)3/1900.8380.1890.320Promoter region-927T → CNANA20/80 (25)17/108 (15.7)37/190 (19.5)0.3100.4210.960-871G → ANANA6/80 (7.5)7/108 (6.5)16/190 (8.4)0.8010.5460.582-244G → ANANA0/80 (0)1/108 (1.0)2/380 (0.5)0.5150.6390.993-97insGNANA0/80 (0)1/108 (1.0)1/380 (0.3)0.6460.3410.611IntronicIVS1 + 69G → C1NA17/80 (21.3)17/108 (15.7)32/190 (16.8)0.3910.8050.750IVS2 - 78A → C1NA0/80 (0)1/108 (1.0)9/190 (4.7)0.0480.0790.011IVS3 + 27T → C3NA16/80 (20)18/108 (16.7)38/190 (20)0.9990.4790.959IVS6 + 27C → A6NA1/80 (1.3)3/108 (2.8)2/190 (1.1)0.8880.2650.403IVS6 + 43C → A6NA3/80 (3.8)4/108 (3.7)7/190 (3.7)0.9790.9930.984IVS7 + 58T → C7NA14/80 (17.5)16/108 (14.8)34/190 (17.9)0.9380.4940.616IVS8 - 36insA8NA0/80 (0)1/108 (1.0)0/380 (0)IVS9 + 350T → GNANA12/80 (15)12/108 (11.1)34/190 (17.9)0.5630.1190.167 Open table in a new tab Of the seven variants occurring in the coding sequence (coding single nucleotide polymorphisms), three are predicted to result in amino acid substitution at residues that are highly conserved between human, mouse, and rat peripherin proteins. These variants are 25G → A (R9Q), 420G → T (D141Y), and 829G → A (A277T). Arginine to glutamine is a non-conservative change occurring in the N terminus head domain of the peripherin protein. Aspartic acid to tyrosine is also a non-conservative change substituting an acidic residue for a polar aromatic residue within the rod domain of the protein. The change of alanine to threonine at amino acid 277 within the rod domain is also a non-conservative substitution of a neutral amino acid for a polar residue. To test whether any of these three PRPH variants may be causative mutations or susceptibility factors for ALS, we compared the frequency of each variant in ALS patients versus normal controls. The variant frequencies and results of statistical analysis are shown in Table II. None of the variant frequencies were found to be significantly increased in ALS patients when compared with the control population. However, we identified two additional variants that were not detected among the control population. One of these consists of a nucleotide deletion (PRPH228delC) resulting in a frameshift within the exon 1 and a premature stop codon (Fig. 2). The predicted truncated protein of 8.8 kDA has 85 amino acids, the first 76 residues corresponding to the normal protein and the other extra 9 derived from the frameshift mutation (Fig. 1B). The female ALS patient having this mutant PRPH died at the age of 65 years old after disease duration of 5 years that had started at the left proximal lower limb. The other insertion variant PRPHIVS8–36insA is unlikely to have a functional impact on the protein, albeit an effect on pre-mRNA processing cannot be excluded as the A insertion could affect the branch point during lariat formation or the transcript regulation. Disruption of Neurofilament Assembly by Expression of Mutant PRPH228delC—To test the effects of the two variants PRPH228delC and PRPHIVS8–36insA on the assembly of IFs, we carried out transfection experiments with the cloned PRPH genes into SW13 cells that lack endogenous IF structures. We have subcloned the PRPH variant alleles into an expression vector driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. As shown in Fig. 3, single transient transfection of vectors expressing human NF-L, normal peripherin (mouse or human), or PRPHIVS8–36insA resulted in self-assembly of proteins into the typical IF network. However, single transfection of the vector for PRPH228delC yielded only weak and diffuse anti-peripherin immunoreactivity in SW13 cells with the absence of the IF network (Fig. 3D). Since peripherin can co-assemble with NF-L (28Beaulieu J.M. Robertson J. Julien J.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and it is co-expressed with neurofilaments in motor neurons, we investigated the effects of co-expression of the PRPH species with either neurofilament NF-L or NF-M proteins in SW13 cells. As expected, the co-expression of normal mouse or human peripherin with NF-L led to the formation of the typical filamentous network immunoreactive for NF-L and peripherin (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar results were obtained by co-transfecting the variant PRPHIVS8–36insA with NF-L (Fig. 4C). However, the co-transfection of PRPH228delC with human NF-L led to the disruption of the IF network (Fig. 4, D–F). Note that the intensity of anti-peripherin immunostaining was much higher in the presence of NF-L than in the single PRPH228delC transfection assay (Fig. 3D), suggesting a stabilization of the mutant peripherin through interaction with NF-L proteins. It is well established that the NF-M and NF-H proteins require the NF-L subunit for neurofilament network formation (28Beaulieu J.M. Robertson J. Julien J.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The co-transfection in SW13 cells of normal peripherin (mouse or human) with NF-M resulted in the formation of punctuate aggregates (Fig. 5, A and B) as reported previously (28Beaulieu J.M. Robertson J. Julien J.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This shows that although peripherin can interact with NF-M to form heteropolymers, the presence of NF-M prevents IF network formation. Similar results were obtained by coexpressing the PRPHIVS8–36insA variant gene with NF-M vector (Fig. 5C). However, no IF protein aggregates have been detected in any SW13 cells after co-transfection of NF-M with the frameshift mutant PRPH228delC (Fig. 5D). A plausible explanation is that this may result from interference of NF-M oligomerization into high molecular weight complexes by interaction with the mutant peripherin consisting of the short N-terminal head region. In this study, we have identified 20 PRPH variants in ALS cases, including three variants predicted to cause non-conservative amino acid changes and one frameshift deletion in exon 1. To assess the possible involvement of these variants in ALS, we compared the allelic frequency of each variant in populations of ALS patients versus controls and examined the cosegregation of the variants with disease status in families. Except for the two variants PRPH228delC and PRPHIVS8–36insA found exclusively in ALS cases, the data did not reveal significant frequency differences between ALS and control individuals for any of the other 18 variants (Table II). We conclude that these latter PRPH variants represent polymorphisms that do not predispose to ALS. As for the PRPHIVS8–36insA variant identified in ALS but not in 380 control chromosomes, there is no evidence based on in vitro transfection assays that this variant had any effects on peripherin processing and assembly into the IF network (Figs. 3C, 4C, and 5C). Therefore, this sequence variation is probably a rare polymorphism. In contrast, we obtained compelling evidence for the deleterious effects of the frameshift mutant PRPH228delC. This mutation in exon 1 is predicted to cause a premature stop codon leading to a truncated protein comprising 76 amino acids of the peripherin head domain (Fig. 1B). As expected, this truncated peripherin species that lacks rod coiled-coil sequences was unable to self-assemble into IF structures (Fig. 3D). It is somewhat surprising that this short peripherin head mutant in SW13 cells was able to disrupt NF-L assembly into IF network (Fig. 4, D–F) and to impede assembly of NF-M into oligomeric structures (Fig. 5D). Although interactions of the peripherin N-terminal head domain with IF proteins have never been documented, studies with the yeast two-hybrid system on domain interactions of vimentin, another type III IF protein, revealed relatively weak interactions between the head domain and other vimentin regions (29Meng J.J.

However, it is generally agreed that the head domain of IF proteins is essential for filament assembly and that transient phosphorylation of the head domain inhibits neurofilament polymerization and IF network formation (30Ching G.Y. Liem R.K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2233-2240PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zheng Y.L. Li B.S. Veeranna Pant H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24026-24032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our observation of IF assembly disruption by the PRPH mutant expression in SW13 cells suggests that the detrimental effect of this mutation is likely related to a disorganization neurofilament network rather than to a 50% reduction of peripherin content resulting from the loss of one intact allele. Moreover, this would be in line with the observation that the peripherin knockout mice do not develop motor neuron disease (32Lariviere R.C. Nguyen M.D. Ribeiro-da-Silva A. Julien J.P. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence for the involvement of neurofilaments in pathogenesis came from the recent discovery of neurofilament gene mutations linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Missense mutations and a 3-bp in-frame deletion in the NF-L gene subunit have been reported in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 (33De Jonghe P. Mersivanova I. Nelis E. Del Favero J.

Codon deletions and insertion in the KSP repeat region of the neurofilament NF-H gene (NEFH) have been detected in a small number of sporadic ALS cases, ∼1% of total cases (21Figlewicz D.A. Krizus A.

However, the functional consequences of these NEFH phosphorylation variants are unknown, and these variants are being viewed as risk factors for the disease. Our discovery of a frameshift mutation in PRPH that can disrupt neurofilament assembly provides the first direct evidence for peripherin involvement in ALS, and it suggests that PRPH mutations may be responsible for a small number of ALS cases. So far, the pathways to neuronal death caused by neurofilament abnormalities remain unknown. Future studies with transgenic mice expressing this PRPH frameshift mutant might provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration.

Irrespective of the labeling protocol, the peptide conformation, and the degree of oligomerization, both Aβ40 and Aβ42 showed a short half-life of 2.5–3.0 min. The liver was the major organ responsible for plasma clearance, accounting for >60% of the peptide uptake, followed by the kidney. In vivo, hepatocytes captured >90% of the radiolabeled peptides which, after endocytosis, were preferentially catabolized and excreted into the bile. Biliary excretion of intact as well as partially degraded Aβ species became obviously relevant at doses above 10 μg.

The capability of the liver to uptake, catabolize, and excrete large doses of Aβ, several orders of magnitude above its physiologic concentration, may explain not only the femtomolar plasma levels of Aβ but the little fluctuation observed with age and disease stages.

Extracellular Aβ amyloid deposits in the form of amyloid plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy as well as intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles co-exist in the brain parenchyma, being the cognitive areas the most severely affected. Aβ, a 39–42-amino acid-long peptide of unknown biological function, is an internal processing product of a larger type I transmembrane precursor molecule, APP, codified by a single multiexonic gene located on chromosome 21 (reviewed in Ref. 1Ghiso J. Frangione B. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2002; 54: 1539-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A soluble form of Aβ (sAβ) is present in the biological fluids of both normal individuals and AD patients as well as in cytosolic soluble fractions of normal, AD, and Down's syndrome brain homogenates (2Seubert P.

Gambetti P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1598-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Notably, an increased amount of sAβ has been reported in AD and Down's syndrome brain tissue in comparison to control individuals (7Teller J.K. Russo C. DeBusk L.M. Angelini G. Zaccheo D. Dagna-Bricarelli F. Scartezzini P. Bertolini S. Mann D.M. Tabaton M. Gambetti P. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Although the primary structures of deposited Aβ and sAβ are indistinguishable, the circulating peptide is predominantly 40 residues long, whereas sAβ42, the major species in parenchymal deposits, is only a minor component of the circulating pool. To the present, it is not clear whether circulating sAβs reflect systemic production, brain clearance, or both. The blood-brain barrier has the capability to modulate sAβ brain uptake and clearance by controlling the uptake of circulating sAβ, either in its free form or bound to its transport apolipoproteins, as well as the elimination of brain-derived Aβ via transport-mediated clearance mechanisms (reviewed in Ref. 8Zlokovic B. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2002; 54: 1553-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Experimentally determined transport rates indicate that the receptor for advance glycation end products mediates the influx of free Aβ into the brain (9Mackic J.B. Stins M. McComb J.G. Calero M. Ghiso J. Kim K.S. Yan S.D. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Frangione B. Zlokovic B. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 734-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), whereas low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2 (LRP-2, also known as gp330 or megalin) is the receptor involved in the uptake of Aβ-apoJ complexes (10Zlokovic B. Martel C. Matsubara E. McCombo J.G. Zheng G. McCluskey R.T. Frangione B. Ghiso J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4229-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In contrast, brain clearance of Aβ at the blood-brain barrier occurs through different receptors, it is largely mediated by LRP-1 and modulated by the LRP-1 ligands apoE and α2-macroglobulin (11Shibata M. Yamada S. Kumar S.R. Calero M. Bading J. Frangione B. Holtzman D.M. Miller C.A. Strickland D.K. Ghiso J. Zlokovic B. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1489-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Different proteases (i.e. neprilysin, endothelin-converting enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme, plasmin, and insulin-degrading enzyme) have been implicated in proteolysis-related clearance of Aβ from the central nervous system (12Carson J.A. Turner A.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 13Morelli L. Llovera R. Ibemdahl S. Castaño E.M. Neurochem.

The systemic, physiologic sAβ excretion/catabolism mechanisms are poorly understood. Clearance experiments in rats showed that after infusion of radiolabeled Aβ peptides into the lateral ventricle, 40% of the injected radioactivity was present in the blood and urine and taken up by the liver and the kidneys in as little as 3.5 min, indicating not only a fast clearance mechanism but also the involvement of systemic organs in the excretion and/or catabolism (16Ghersi-Egea J.-F. Gorevic P. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Patlak C.S. Fenstermacher J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 880-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The high urinary levels of radioactive tracer compared with those in plasma suggested a key role for the renal clearance. In contrast, immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis of urine from normal individuals demonstrated the presence of intact sAβ40 at very low levels, accounting for only a minute fraction of the total circulating pool (17Ghiso J. Calero M. Matsubara E. Governale S. Chuba J. Beavis R. Wisniewski T. Frangione B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), thereby suggesting a different metabolic/excretory pathway. We investigated the excretion/catabolism of human Aβ40 and Aβ42 species in mice using both iodinated peptides and peptides labeled with an intracellularly trapped ligand procedure based on the use of 125I-tyramine-cellobiose (TC), a sugar adduct that is not degraded by mammalian cells and therefore accumulates in the organs involved in the uptake (18Pittman R.C. Carew T.E. Glass C.K. Green S.R. Taylor C.A. Attie A.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This procedure has been widely used to determine sites of catabolism of many proteins, including some related to amyloid diseases, i.e. transthyretin (TTR) (19Makover A. Moriwaki H. Ramakrishnan R. Saraiva M.J.M. Blaner W.S. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8598-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or serum amyloid P component (SAP). Our results indicate that sAβ peptides have a short life in circulation, the liver being the major organ and the hepatocytes the main cell type responsible for their uptake and degradation/excretion. The findings are confirmed in vitro by using hepatocytes in culture and validated in vivo, analyzing Aβ degradation species in the bile of mice injected with human Aβ. Aβ-(1–40) (DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVV) and Aβ-(1–42) (DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVVIA), homologous to residues 672–711 and 672–713, respectively, of human Aβ precursor protein APP770 as well as a derivative of Aβ-(1–40) bearing a single biotin molecule at the N-terminal aspartate residue, were all synthesized at the W. M. Keck Facility at Yale University using N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry, purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), their molecular masses corroborated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, and their concentration assessed by amino acid analysis. Both peptides were supplied as a single component eluted from a reverse phase C4 column with experimental molecular masses of 4329.1 Da for Aβ40 (expected, 4329.9 Da) and 4513.6 Da for Aβ42 (expected, 4514.1 Da). Peptides KCNTATCATQRLANFLVHSSNNFGAILSSTNVGSNTY (37 residues, homologous to human amylin) and KMQQNGYENPTYKGGEQMQN (20 amino acids, homologous to the C terminus of APP) were used as unrelated controls for specificity. Peptides were initially dissolved in either Me2SO or distilled deionized water. The peptides were briefly sonicated, diluted to their final concentration in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS), centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, sterilized using a 0.22-μm pore-size filter (Millex GP; Millipore Co., Bedford, MA), and either immediately used or stored at –80 °C. If Me2SO was used for solubilization, its final concentration in the sample never represented >1% of the total volume. Peptides were analyzed by amino acid sequence and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and structurally characterized via size exclusion chromatography and CD spectroscopy. The integrity of their biological activity was assessed through their binding interaction with apolipoprotein J (apoJ). The degree of oligomerization of the various peptides was measured by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in TBS, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The effluent was monitored by absorbance at 220 nm, and fractions were collected accordingly. Aliquots of ∼200 ng were immediately lyophilized, re-dissolved in sample buffer, and separated on 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The aliquots were then analyzed by Western blot after transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore Corp, Bedford, MA) employing 10 mm CAPS buffer (Sigma), pH 11.0, containing 10% methanol. After blocking for 1 h at 37 °C with 3% nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T), the electrotransferred material was incubated with a mixture of mouse monoclonal anti-human Aβ antibodies 6E10 and 4G8 (Signet, Dedham, MA; 1:5000 in TBS-T) followed by affinity-purified horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (BioSource International; 1:5000 in TBS-T). Fluorograms were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). CD spectroscopy was used to estimate the predominant secondary structure of the different peptides. Spectra in the far-UV light (195–260 nm) were recorded at 24 °C with a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Corp.; Tokyo, Japan), using a cell path of 0.1 cm and a protein concentration of 0.15 mg/ml. Results were expressed in terms of mean residue ellipticity (degree·cm2·dmol–1). The dissociation constants of apoJ interaction with native and iodinated Aβ peptides were estimated by solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using Aβ40- or Aβ42-coated (400 ng/100 μl/well) microtiter plates as described (20Calero M. Tokuda T. Rostagno A. Kumar A. Zlokovic B. Frangione B. Ghiso J. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After blocking with 0.3% gelatin and 3% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 in TBS-T, increasing concentrations of apoJ (0–20 nm) were incubated with the Aβ-coated wells. Bound apoJ was detected with mouse monoclonal G7 (anti-apoJ/clusterin,1:2000; Quidel Corp., San Diego, CA), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse antiserum (1:4000, Amersham Biosciences). The reaction was developed for 15 min with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate (Bio-Rad), stopped with 2.5 n H2SO4, and quantitated at 450 nm on a 7520 Microplate Reader (Cambridge Technology, Watertown, MA). Nonlinear regression analysis and estimation of dissociation constants were assessed with the aid of GraphPad Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Radiolabeling and Characterization of Aβ-iodinated Species—Ten micrograms of the Aβ peptides were labeled with 2 mCi of Na[125I] (Amersham Biosciences) using either lactoperoxidase (Sigma) or N-chlorobenzenesulfonamide (IODO-BEADS, Pierce), according to the respective manufacturer's instructions and standard protocols. Labeled Aβ40 was separated in a C4 narrow bore column (Vydac, The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) using a 30-min 25–40% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and a flow rate of 200 μl/min. Labeled Aβ42 was also separated in a C4 narrow bore column (Vydac) using a 40-min 30–42% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and a flow rate of 200 μl/min. In both cases, specific activities were in the range of 80–100 μCi/μg, and radioactivity was >95% trichloroacetic acid-precipitable. The iodinated Aβ species and the degree of Met-35 oxidation were assessed through MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the HPLC peaks obtained in parallel Aβ-labeling experiments employing Na[127I] (Sigma) instead of Na[125I] under identical experimental conditions. The MS analysis was performed at the New York University Protein Analysis Facility using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) matrix on a Micromass TofSpec-2E MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer in linear mode using standard instrument settings. Because sAβ species in the circulation consist mainly of nonoxidized species, to better reproduce physiological conditions, only those peaks containing iodinated nonoxidized Aβ were used for the uptake experiments. The use of lactoperoxidase consistently rendered lower amounts of undesirable oxidized peptides while maintaining specific activities at similar levels as IODO-BEADS that, in turn, translated in a better yield of nonoxidized, radioiodinated peptides. CD spectroscopy and binding to apoJ were used to demonstrate the lack of structural and functional changes in the Aβ peptides following iodination. The degree of oligomerization of radiolabeled peptides was assessed by Western blot as described above. Two proteins of different molecular masses and well known half-lives in rodents, human IgG (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and SAP (Sigma), were also radioiodinated as above and used as controls for the pharmacokinetic parameters described below. Their specific activities were in the range of 50–70 μCi/μg with >95% trichloroacetic acid precipitability in both cases. Identification of Targeted Amino Acid Residues in the Iodination Procedure—To identify the iodinated amino acid residues, Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) were labeled with Na[127I], the nonoxidized species separated by RP-HPLC identically as above, the resulting peaks subjected to separate proteolytic degradations with three different enzymes (trypsin, endoproteinase Asp-N, and endoproteinase Glu-C), and the subsequent proteolytic fragments analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to assess iodine incorporation. Each of the HPLC-purified, nonoxidized, Na[127I]-labeled Aβ40 peaks (2–5 μg) was dissolved in 5 μl of distilled water, with equal volumes of either 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8, or 100 mm ammonium carbonate buffer, pH 8, and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with either modified trypsin (Roche Applied Science; 1:25 w/w), endoproteinase Asp-N (Roche Applied Science; 1:50 w/w), or endoproteinase Glu-C (Roche Applied Science; 1:25 w/w), respectively. Digests were desalted using Zip-Tip C18 micro RP column (Millipore) as recommended by the manufacturer, utilizing 90% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) for elution prior to MS analysis. To assess iodine incorporation in Aβ42 peptides, identical procedures were followed with the only difference that because RP-HPLC separation of iodinated and nonoxidized species did not result in well delineated separate peaks, as shown under “Results,” the nonoxidized pool was subjected to proteolytic degradation. The resulting peptides were further analyzed by MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry. The labeled 125I-TC adduct was prepared as described before (18Pittman R.C. Carew T.E. Glass C.K. Green S.R. Taylor C.A. Attie A.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) by scaling down the reagents 50 times. In brief, 240 μmol each of cellobiose, tyramine, and NaBH3CN were allowed to react for 6 days at room temperature in 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Following adjustment of the pH to 5.5, the reaction products were separated on a cation exchange column (0.6 × 18 cm AG-50W, Bio-Rad), and the TC adducts were eluted with 0.5 m NH4OH. The adduct, further purified in a silicic acid column (0.7 × 26 cm), was eluted with butanol/acetic acid/water (7:1:2) after free tyramine at the end of the column. The purified TC was freeze-dried and stored at –20 °C until used. Approximately 10 nmol (∼4.8 μg) were radioiodinated with Na[125I] (3 mCi) for 30 min at room temperature in a N-chlorobenzene sulfonamide-coated tube (10 μg; IODO-GEN; Pierce), and the reaction was stopped by transferring the solution to a tube containing sodium metabisulfite and sodium iodine. After labeling, the 125I-TC adduct was activated with cyanuric chloride in acetone (1.8 μg/20 μl) and sodium hydroxide (5 μl of 4 mm) for 20 s, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of acetic acid (3 μl of 10 mm). The activated 125I-TC adduct was immediately bound to the corresponding Aβ peptides by addition to 50 μg of each of the peptides (1 mg/ml in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) and incubation for 1 h at room temperature. The resulting 125I-TC-labeled peptides were separated by RP-HPLC in a Vydac C4 column using the same linear gradients as above. Specific activities of the labeled TC peptides after purification (typically 20 μCi/μg) were calculated from the integration of the peak areas obtained at 220 nm, and the radioactivity counts were obtained from aliquots of the respective pools. Experiments were performed on 8–12-week-old male B6SJLF1/J mice, (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) following approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at New York University. Typically, groups of 6–8 animals were anesthetized with Isoflurane, and the left jugular vein was isolated. Each group received a bolus intravenous injection of 2 × 107 cpm of either 125I-Aβ40, 125I-Aβ42, 125I-TC Aβ40, or 125I-TC Aβ42 peptides in 200 μl of lactate Ringer's solution (106 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 24 mm sodium lactate, 4 mm potassium lactate, pH 7) containing 1% ovalbumin. Blood samples were collected from the tail vein at 0.5, 1.5, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min using heparinized capillary tubes (Fisher). To assess the integrity of the peptides, a plasma aliquot at each time point was cold-precipitated with 12% trichloroacetic acid in lactate Ringer's containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Counts were assessed in a scintillation counter (LS6500; Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA), and total as well as trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts/min were recorded. Results were expressed as remaining counts/min (percentage of initial counts/min) at each bleed time, with the 0.5-min time point considered as 100%. The half-lives of the radiolabeled peptides were calculated from the clearance curves generated by using a standard exponential decay equation in GraphPad Prism, and pharmacokinetic parameters for the IgG and SAP standard proteins were estimated by using noncompartmental pharmacokinetics data analysis from PK Solutions Software (Montrose, CO) following a bi-exponential equation. To assess organ distribution, groups of 6–8 animals received an intravenous injection of 2 × 107 cpm of either 125I-Aβ40, 125I-Aβ42, 125I-TC Aβ40, or 125I-TC Aβ42, as above, and were sacrificed by decapitation at 120 min. All organs, carcass, urine, feces, and bile were collected and weighed; the radioactivity was assessed, and the resulting counts/min were normalized per g of wet tissue. Parenchymal and nonparenchymal liver cells were isolated according to well established protocols (21Seglen P.O. Methods Toxicol. 1993; 1: 231-243Google Scholar, 22Friedman S.L. Methods Toxicol. 1993; 1: 292-310Google Scholar). Briefly isoflurane-anesthetized mice were intravenously bolus-injected with 2 × 107 cpm of either 125I-TC Aβ40 or 125I-TC Aβ42 in 200 μl of lactate Ringer's containing 1% ovalbumin, as described above. After 10 min, the liver was exposed and an intravenous catheter (Angiocath, BD Biosciences) inserted in the portal vein. The iliolumbar vein was then sectioned, and the liver was perfused at 37 °C with perfusion buffer (142 mm NaCl, 6.7 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 6 mm NaOH, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min until the organ was blanched (typically, about 10 min). The liver was subsequently removed from the carcass and further perfused at 37 °C for another 10 min with 0.05% w/v collagenase (type I, Sigma) in 4.8 mm CaCl2, 68.4 mm NaCl, 6.7 mm KCl, 100 mm HEPES, 66 mm NaOH, pH 7.4. After excision, the liver was placed in 20 ml of ice-cold suspension buffer (68.4 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 1.1 mm KH2PO4, 0.7 mm Na2SO4, 30.2 mm HEPES, 3.0 mm TES, 36.3 mm Tricine, 52.5 mm NaOH, 1.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.6 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and gently raked to release the cells. The resulting cell suspension was filtered through a 100-μm nylon mesh to remove connective tissue debris and cell clumps, incubated on a tilting platform at 37 °C for 30 min, cooled in an ice-water bath, and centrifuged at 20 × g (Beckman J-6B) for 2 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was used for further isolation of nonparenchymal cells, and the pellet, enriched in hepatocytes, was resuspended in ice-cold wash buffer (perfusion buffer supplemented with 1.2 mm CaCl2) and further depleted in nonparenchymal cells by four subsequent cycles of low speed centrifugation steps, as above. For the isolation of nonparenchymal cells, all supernatants were pooled, centrifuged at 500 × g for 7 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 2 ml of modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), overlaid on top of a discontinuous 6, 8, 12, and 15% arabinogalactan (Sigma) gradient, and centrifuged at 25 °C for 25 min at 49,000 × g in a Beckman XL ultracentrifuge using a SW-40 rotor (Beckman Coulter). Distribution of the radioactive tracer was assessed in each fraction, and cell morphology was evaluated after cytospin centrifugation (Shandon Cytospin Cytocentrifuge, Thermo Electron Co., Woburn, MA) by Sudan IV and Harris hematoxylin stainings. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in growth media (Eagle's minimum essential medium with 2 mm l-glutamine and Earle's balanced salt solution adjusted to contain 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate (ATCC)), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma), as recommended by ATCC. For maintenance, cells were subcultured at a ratio 1:4 with medium replacement every 3 days. For binding experiments, cells were seeded onto Lab-Tek 4-well glass chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) at a concentration of 7.5 × 104 cells in 0.5 ml of growth media per chamber and cultured for 48 h until 60–70% confluence. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold Dulbecco's PBS and maintained on ice during the subsequent experiment. Biotin-labeled Aβ40 was dissolved in distilled deionized water, briefly sonicated, centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, sterilized using a 0.22-μm pore filter, diluted to 10 μm in culture medium depleted of fetal bovine serum, and allowed to interact with the HepG2 cells for 2 h at 4 °C. After incubation, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS before incubation with fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin (BioSource; 1:500) for 30 min. Following three PBS washes, nuclear DNA was counterstained with 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.5 μg/ml in Vectashield; Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Samples were visualized in an Olympus BX51 epifluorescence microscope, and images were acquired and analyzed with the aid of a digital imaging analyzer using Cytovision software version 2.7 (Applied Imaging Co., Santa Clara, CA). The specificity of HepG2-Aβ40 interaction was assessed by competitive inhibition of biotin-labeled Aβ40 binding by 10-fold molar excess of either unlabeled Aβ40 or unrelated peptides amylin and APP-(751–770). Preparation of Anti-Aβ-coated Paramagnetic Beads—Fifty microliters of goat anti-mouse IgG-coated paramagnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280; Dynal Biotech, Lake Success, NY) were allowed to interact with 3 μg each of anti-Aβ mouse monoclonal antibodies 4G8 and 6E10 (recognizing segments 1–16 and 17–24 of Aβ, respectively) for 2 h at room temperature followed by 16 h at 4 °C under constant end-to-end rotation, and subsequently were washed/blocked with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Aβ Immunoprecipitation in Bile and Urine Samples—Increasing amounts of nonradiolabeled human Aβ40 (0, 1, 10, or 100 μg) in 200 μl of lactate Ringer's solution were bolus-injected intravenously into different sets of mice (n = 2 for 0 μg, n = 8 for 1 μg, n = 7 for 10 μg, and n = 7 for 100 μg Aβ injection). The gallbladders and urinary bladders were removed 5, 15, or 30 min after peptide injection. Following washing out of blood, bile and urine"

In this study, we present evidence that mouse Zip5 is a zinc uptake transporter that is specific for Zn(II) over other potential metal ion substrates. We also show that, unlike many other mammalian ZIP proteins, the endocytic removal of mZip5 from the plasma membrane is not triggered by zinc treatment. Thus, the activity of mZip5 does not appear to be down-regulated by zinc repletion. Zip5 expression is restricted to many tissues important for zinc homeostasis, including the intestine, pancreas, liver, and kidney. Zip5 is similar in sequence to the Zip4 protein, which is involved in the uptake of dietary zinc. Co-expression of Zip4 and Zip5 in the intestine led to the hypothesis that these proteins play overlapping roles in the uptake of dietary zinc across the apical membrane of intestinal enterocytes. Surprisingly, however, we found that mZip5 localizes specifically to the basolateral membrane of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. These observations suggest that Zip5 plays a novel role in polarized cells by carrying out serosal-to-mucosal zinc transport. Furthermore, given its expression in tissues important to zinc homeostasis, we propose that Zip5 plays a central role in controlling organismal zinc status.

Furthermore, given its expression in tissues important to zinc homeostasis, we propose that Zip5 plays a central role in controlling organismal zinc status. Zinc is an essential nutrient for all organisms because of the many important roles this metal plays. Therefore, organisms require efficient mechanisms to take up zinc from their diet or extracellular environment. Zinc can also be toxic if overaccumulated. Thus, precise regulatory mechanisms are also required to control this uptake to maintain an adequate supply of zinc while preventing its overaccumulation. At the cellular level, these homeostatic mechanisms include the regulation of zinc transport into and out of the cell, sequestration within intracellular organelles, and binding of the metal by intracellular macromolecules such as metallothioneins. At the organismal level, tissue-specific homeostatic roles are superimposed on these cellular mechanisms. Zinc homeostasis in mammals is primarily regulated through the control of zinc absorption in the intestine and the loss of endogenous zinc in the intestine and through both pancreatic and liver excretion (1King J.C. Shames D.M. Woodhouse L.R. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1360S-1366SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cousins R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 238-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 3Krebs N.F. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1374S-1377SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under conditions of extreme zinc overload or deficiency, excretion of zinc through the kidney into urine is also a contributing factor to homeostasis. Movement of zinc into and out of cells and subcellular organelles is mediated by zinc transporter proteins. In many organisms, zinc uptake is mediated by members of the ZIP family of metal ion transporters. For example, the ZupT protein of Escherichia coli is involved the uptake of zinc (4Grass G. Wong M.D. Rosen B.P. Smith R.L. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 864-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, zinc acquisition is largely mediated by the Zrt1 and Zrt2 transporters (5Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 6Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In mammals, the Zip1, Zip2, Zip3, LIV-1 (Zip6), KE4 (Zip7), and BIGM103 (Zip8) proteins have been implicated in zinc uptake in a variety of cell and tissue types (7Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol.

The importance of ZIP transporters in dietary zinc uptake in mammals has recently become clear from studies of acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE). 1The abbreviations used are: AE, acrodermatitis enteropathica; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; HA, hemagglutinin; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxodase; TPEN, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F.1The abbreviations used are: AE, acrodermatitis enteropathica; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; HA, hemagglutinin; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxodase; TPEN, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F. AE is a recessive inherited disease of humans that causes impaired absorption of dietary zinc (14Barnes P.M. Moynahan E.J. Proc. Royal Soc. Med. 1973; 66: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 15Neldner K.H. Hambidge K.M. New Eng. J. Med. 1975; 292: 879-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 16Lombeck T.

Dermatol. 1979; 101: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, fibroblasts isolated from AE patients have decreased zinc uptake activity (18Vasquez F. Grider A. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1995; 50: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Grider A. Lin Y.F. Muga S.J. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1998; 61: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These results suggested that AE is caused by mutations affecting a protein responsible for zinc transport into intestinal enterocytes and possibly other cells. Support for this hypothesis was obtained with the cloning of the AE gene, SLC39A4, which encodes a ZIP family zinc transporter designated Zip4 (20Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.M. Zemansky J. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 21Kury S. Dreno B. Bezieau S. Giraudet S. Kharfi M. Kamoun R. Moisan J.P. Nat.

Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Consistent with its proposed role in dietary zinc uptake, SLC39A4 mRNA was detected throughout the small intestine. Consistent with the control of zinc absorption, mouse Zip4 expression and localization is regulated by zinc status (22Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Slc39A4 mRNA levels are elevated in the intestines of animals fed low zinc diets and reduced when dietary zinc is high. We have also recently shown that mZip4 activity is regulated post-translationally in cultured cells; zinc stimulates the endocytosis of the mZip4 protein thereby decreasing zinc uptake activity (23Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4523-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with in vivo data showing that, under zinc deficiency conditions, the mZip4 protein is localized to the apical surface of enterocytes and moves to intracellular sites upon zinc repletion (22Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms are likely to regulate Zip4 activity in vivo. Some results indicate that at least one additional zinc transporter is present on the apical surface of intestinal enterocytes and involved in dietary zinc uptake. First, among the mutations in SLC39A4 gene associated with AE were several mutations that are likely to completely abolish the transport function of the Zip4 protein (20Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.M. Zemansky J. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 21Kury S. Dreno B. Bezieau S. Giraudet S. Kharfi M. Kamoun R.

Genet. 2004; 13: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) yet the symptoms of AE can be ameliorated by increased levels of dietary zinc. Furthermore, some AE mutations fail to map to the same chromosomal region as SLC39A4 (20Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.M. Zemansky J. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Gitschier and co-workers (20Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.M. Zemansky J. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 26Eide D.J. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) identified a possible candidate for this transporter, a ZIP protein that they named provisionally as “hORF1” that is now designated as “Zip5.” This proposed role was especially intriguing given that the Expressed Sequence Tag sequence databases suggested that the corresponding gene, SLC39A5, was expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. In this report, we describe the characterization of the Zip5 protein and address its possible role as an apical zinc uptake transporter. Our studies indicate that Zip5 is a zinc transporter, but, in contrast to our initial hypothesis, this protein is localized to the basolateral and not the apical plasma membrane of polarized MDCK cells. Therefore, we propose that Zip5 acts in vivo in serosal-to-mucosal zinc transport. Plasmids Used—The mZip5 cDNA cloned into pcDNA3.1 Puro(+) was provided by Jodi Dufner-Beattie and Glen Andrews (University of Kansas Medical Center). This construct has the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen epitope fused to the carboxyl terminus of the protein. The HA-tagged mZip4-expressing plasmid was described previously (22Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Both genes were expressed in transfected cells from the vector's CMV promoter. Northern Blots and Tissue RNA Arrays—Human multiple tissue Northern blots and a multiple tissue expression array were purchased from BD Biosciences and probed with a 488-bp 32P-labeled probe containing SLC39A5 open reading frame nucleotides 103–590 according to the manufacturers instructions. HEK293 Cell Culture and Transfection Methods—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) plus 0.45% glucose under 5% CO2. All culture media contained 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 μm non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Zinc depletion of media using Chelex 100 (Sigma) was performed as previously described with minor modifications (27Messer H.H. Murray E.J. Goebel N.K. J. Nutr. 1982; 112: 652-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, a solution of 2% (w/v) Chelex 100 resin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum was incubated with constant stirring overnight followed by filtration through a 0.2-μm filter. HEK293 (∼2 × 106) cells were seeded in 25-mm2 flasks and transfected with the plasmid DNAs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Stably transfected HEK293 cell lines were selected with 2.0 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) 48 h after transfection. Approximately 80% of cells in each population expressed the transgene as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown). Cell viability was assayed with the CellTiter 96®AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega). The conversion of the substrate in this kit was accomplished by using dehydrogenase enzymes found in metabolically active cells. 65Zn Uptake Assays—Transiently transfected HEK293 cells were used for 65Zn uptake assays as described previously (22Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In brief, 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed once in uptake buffer (15 mm HEPES, 100 mm glucose, and 150 mm KCl, pH 7.0) and then added to prewarmed uptake buffer containing the specified concentration of 65ZnCl2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc.) and incubated in a shaking 37 °C water bath for 15 min. Assays were stopped by adding an equal volume of ice-cold uptake buffer supplemented with 1 mm EDTA (stop buffer). Cells were then collected on nitrocellulose filters (Millipore; 0.45-μm pore size) and washed three times in stop buffer (∼10 ml of total wash volume). Cell-associated radioactivity was measured with a Packard Auto-Gamma 5650 γ-counter. In a parallel experiment, cells were washed three times with ice-cold uptake buffer and then lysed in PBS buffer plus 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100. Protein levels were then determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Zinc accumulation was calculated and normalized to protein concentrations. Immunoblotting—Transfected cells were harvested, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, scraped into PBS, and collected by centrifugation. After three additional washes in ice-cold PBS, the cells were lysed by sonication in buffer containing 62 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Diagnostics). Loading buffer was added to the protein extracts and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. (Higher temperatures were found to cause aggregation of these proteins.) Extract volumes equivalent to 20 μg of protein were separated using 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed using a rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Sigma) followed by an anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Pierce). Detection of complexes was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Roche Applied Sciences). As a loading control, the membranes were stripped of antibodies by incubating at 60 °C for 30 min in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% (w/v) SDS), washed in TBST, and reprobed with a 1:40,000 dilution of mouse anti-tubulin (Sigma) primary antibody and 1:10,000 dilution of HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) as secondary antibody. Enzymatic removal of glycosyl groups was performed by using PNGase F (New England Biolabs) treatment of lysates. Cell lysates (20 μg of protein) were denatured in 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 10 min. Nonidet P-40 and sodium phosphate were then added to final concentrations of 1% and 50 mm, respectively. 5 μl of PNGase F (2500 units) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples were then run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel before immunoblotting. For immunoblot analysis of mZip-HA surface levels, the cells were cultured in 6-well trays. In some experiments, ZnCl2 or TPEN was added to the medium at the indicated concentrations and times. Cells were washed three times with PBS on ice, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, blocked, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1:500 primary rabbit anti-HA antibody (Sigma), and then washed five times with PBS to remove unbound antibodies. The cells were then lysed by sonication in buffer containing 62 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Diagnostics). Lysates containing the solubilized anti-HA antibodies that were bound to the surface mZip-HA proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the anti-HA antibodies were then detected using anti-rabbit HRP antibodies (1:10,000). The protein detected in the mZip-HA lanes co-migrated with purified anti-HA antibody (data not shown). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—To assay the surface levels of mZip-HA proteins, cells were grown in 24-well plates for 48 h on sterile glass coverslips. In some experiments, ZnCl2 or TPEN was added to the medium at the indicated concentrations and times. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, and washed three times with PBS. Cells were blocked for 1 h with PBS plus 5% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with a 1:500 dilution of primary rabbit anti-HA antibody (Sigma). The cells were then washed five times in PBS followed by incubation for 1 h with the anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). The cells were washed again with PBS and then examined with an Olympus 1X70 microscope fitted with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal laser. The intracellular distribution of mZip-HA proteins was examined in a similar manner using cells that were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Mouse anti-p230 was used as a marker of the trans-Golgi network (BD Biosciences). Detection of p230 was performed using an anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to Alexa 594. mZip-HA Expression in MDCK Cells—Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. MDCK cells were seeded in 25-mm2 flasks and transfected with the plasmid pcDNA3.1 Puro(+) vector or plasmids expressing mZip-HA proteins. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Stable MDCK cell lines were selected with 5.0 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) 48 h after transfection. The stable cells were cultured on 24-mm Costar Transwell polycarbonate filters with a 0.4-μm pore size at starting densities of 2 × 105 cells per well for 5 days, and then cells were used to assay mZip-HA protein expression and localization as described above. For immunoblot analysis of mZip5-HA apical and basolateral cell surface protein levels, MDCK cells were grown on Costar Transwell filters for 5 days, washed three times with cold PBS, and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then blocked for 1 h with PBS plus 5% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated 1 h at room temperature with 1:500 dilution of primary rabbit anti-HA antibody (Sigma) added to the apical or basolateral side of the monolayer. Control experiments indicated that the antibodies could not diffuse across the cell layer during this incubation. Surface-bound antibodies were then assayed by immunoblotting as described above. Similarity between Mammalian Zip4 and Zip5 Proteins and Their Tissue-specific Patterns of Expression—The mouse Slc39A5 and human SLC39A5 genes encode Zip5, a previously uncharacterized member of the ZIP family. Mouse and human Zip5 are very similar in sequence to each other and also similar to mouse and human Zip4 (Fig. 1). Mouse and human Zip5 share 84% identity, whereas the Zip4 and Zip5 proteins are ∼30% identical. Like other ZIPs, these proteins each have eight predicted transmembrane domains, and the similarity shared between them is greatest in this region. In addition, both Zip4 and Zip5 proteins have long amino-terminal domains. This domain is ∼300 amino acids for Zip4 and about 200 amino acids for the Zip5 proteins. The amino terminus of Zip4 has been shown previously to be extracellular (23Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4523-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Mammalian Zip4 and Zip5 proteins also have a conserved domain with the sequence HEXPHEXGD in predicted transmembrane domain 5. Although the function of this domain is unknown, it is conserved in many ZIP proteins (12Taylor K.M. Nicholson R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1611: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To determine the tissue-specific pattern of Zip5 expression, we probed Northern blots of human mRNAs with a probe generated from the SLC39A5 gene. SLC39A5 expression was highest in liver, kidney, pancreas (Fig. 2A), and throughout the small intestine and colon (Fig. 2B) with little expression detected in other tissues. A similar pattern of expression was observed previously for mouse and human SLC39A4 mRNA (20Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.M. Zemansky J. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 21Kury S. Dreno B. Bezieau S. Giraudet S. Kharfi M. Kamoun R. Moisan J.P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 239-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 22Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, Zip4 and Zip5 are closely related proteins with similar tissue-specific patterns of expression. Probing of a multiple tissue expression array with SLC39A5 indicated that this gene was also expressed in the spleen and appendix as well as fetal liver and fetal kidney (data not shown). No expression was detected in adrenal gland, bladder, thymus, uterus, peripheral blood leukocytes, prostate, salivary gland, testis, lymph node, mammary gland, ovary, and bone marrow. Among cell lines tested, no expression was observed in HL-60, HeLa, K562, MOLT-4, B-cell lymphomas (Raji and Daudi), and SW480 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Expression of mZip5-HA in Transfected HEK293 Cells—To characterize the Zip5 protein and its function, we used an allele of mouse Zip5 with the hemagglutinin antigen (HA) epitope added to its carboxyl terminus to allow specific detection of the protein by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3A (lane 3), cells transfected with a plasmid expressing mZip5-HA from the CMV promoter accumulated a major protein of ∼80-kDa molecular mass and a less abundant protein of 70 kDa. No proteins were detected in HEK293 cells transfected with the vector alone (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). The predicted molecular mass of mZip5-HA is ∼59 kDa. The discrepancy between the observed and expected size was likely the result of N-glycosylation of the mZip5-HA protein. First, a band of the expected 59-kDa size was observed when cells were treated with the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–6). Second, the predicted molecular mass was also observed when lysates were treated with PNGase F to enzymatically remove glycosyl groups (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). Three potential sites of N-glycosylation (Asn-49, Asn-91, and Asn-158) are found in the amino-terminal domain of mZip5 (Fig. 1). The only other potential site is Asn-390, which is predicted to lie within transmembrane domain 4. Therefore, these results are consistent with the topology shown in Fig. 3C in which the amino terminus of Zip5-HA is located on the extracytosolic face of the membrane. Additional data (see below) indicate that the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein is also extracytosolic. mZip5 Is a Zinc-specific Transporter—To examine the ability of Zip5 to act as a zinc transporter, mZip5-HA was expressed in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Pools of transfected cells were collected and assayed for protein expression and zinc uptake activity. Immunoblots of total lysates indicated that these cells accumulated abundant mZip5-HA protein (Fig. 4A). A substantial amount of this protein was located on the plasma membrane. This was shown using an immunoblotting assay to assess the levels of anti-HA antibodies bound to the surface of non-permeabilized HEK/mZip-HA cells (23Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4523-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Kim B.E. Petris M.J. Andrews G. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 23: 24631-24639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal epitope tag of each protein is predicted to be extracellular (Fig. 3C) and therefore exposed to antibody binding in non-permeabilized cells. Cells were grown in basal media, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and the intact cells were then probed with anti-HA antibodies to label mZip5-HA proteins on the cell surface. After extensive washing to remove unbound antibodies, the cells were lysed, and the anti-HA antibodies that had been bound to the cell surface were detected by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4B, a significant amount of anti-HA antibody was bound to mZip5-HA-expressing cells. In contrast, little anti-HA antibody was recovered from vector transfectants. The steady-state distribution of total mZip5-HA will be explored in more detail later in this report. Consistent with the ability of Zip5 to transport zinc, cells expressing mZip5-HA accumulated ∼6-fold more zinc over a 60-min period than did the endogenous uptake activity assayed in vector-only transfectants (Fig. 4C). Only low levels of zinc accumulation were detected when these assays were conducted with chilled cells indicating that zinc accumulation by both mZip5 and the endogenous system present in HEK293 cells are temperature-dependent and therefore likely to be transporter mediated. As shown in Fig. 4D, uptake by the endogenous system and mZip5 was concentration-dependent and saturable. When assayed over a range of zinc concentrations, the uptake activity of mZip5 showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent Km value of 1.7 ± 0.2 μm zinc and a Vmax of 13.2 ± 2 pmol/min/mg of protein. The endogenous system in HEK293 cells had an apparent Km value of 2.1 ± 0.1 μm zinc and a Vmax of 4.1 ± 0.5 pmol/min/mg of protein. Finally, we reasoned that the increased zinc uptake ability observed for mZip5-HA-expressing cells could enhance the ability of these cells to grow under zinc-limiting conditions. mZip5-HA-expressing cells and vector-transfected cells were incubated in increasing concentrations of a zinc chelator, TPEN, for 2 days, and cell viability was then measured. Although both cell types lost viability with increasing concentrations of TPEN, the mZip5-HA cells had significantly increased resistance to the chelator (Fig. 4E). These results are consistent with the ability of mZip5 to transport zinc into the cell where it is then available for zinc-dependent processes. To assess the substrate specificity of Zip5, we examined the effects of various metals on zinc accumulation by cells expressing mZip5-HA. We predicted that high levels of other substrates would compete with zinc and interfere with its uptake via mZip5-HA. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with either the empty vector or the vector encoding the HA-tagged mZip5 protein. Pools of transfectants were assayed for zinc uptake activity with apparent Km levels of 65Zn (1.5 μm) in the presence of either 10- or 50-fold molar excess of competitor metal. Zinc uptake by the endogenous system was strongly inhibited by excess zinc, copper, and cadmium and to a lesser extent by other metals (Fig. 5A). In contrast, zinc uptake by mZip5-HA was strongly inhibited by zinc and was far less sensitive to other metals (Fig. 5B). These results are consistent with the zinc-specific uptake ability of mZip5. A similar result was obtained with mZip1, mZip2, mZip3, and mZip4 suggesting that these proteins are all zinc-specific transpo"
https://openalex.org/W2084990170,"We report here on the expression of slc5a8 in kidney and its relevance to Na+-coupled reabsorption of lactate. slc5a8 is the murine ortholog of SLC5A8, a candidate tumor suppressor gene, which we recently cloned from human intestine and demonstrated its functional identity as a Na+-coupled transporter for short-chain fatty acids and lactate. The slc5a8 cDNA, cloned from mouse kidney, codes for a protein consisting of 611 amino acids. When expressed heterologously in mammalian cells or Xenopus oocytes, slc5a8 mediates Na+-coupled electrogenic transport of lactate/pyruvate as well as short-chain fatty acids (e.g. acetate, propionate, and butyrate). The Na+/fatty acid stoichiometry varies depending on the fatty acid substrate (2:1 for lactate and 4:1 for propionate). This phenomenon of variable Na+/substrate stoichiometry depending on the fatty acid substrate is also demonstrable with human SLC5A8. In situ hybridization with sagittal sections of mouse kidney demonstrates abundant expression of the transcripts in the cortex as well as the medulla. Brush border membrane vesicles prepared from rabbit kidney are able to transport lactate in a Na+-coupled manner. The transport process exhibits the overshoot phenomenon, indicating uphill lactate transport in response to the transmembrane Na+ gradient. The Na+-coupled lactate transport in these membrane vesicles is inhibitable by short-chain fatty acids. We conclude that slc5a8 is expressed abundantly in the kidney and that it plays a role in the active reabsorption of lactate. slc5a8 is the first transporter known to be expressed in mammalian kidney that has the ability to mediate the Na+-coupled reabsorption of lactate.

We conclude that slc5a8 is expressed abundantly in the kidney and that it plays a role in the active reabsorption of lactate. slc5a8 is the first transporter known to be expressed in mammalian kidney that has the ability to mediate the Na+-coupled reabsorption of lactate. l-Lactate is present in blood at a concentration of ∼90 mg/liter (∼1.5 mm), but the urinary excretion of l-lactate is very low (100–600 mg/day). With the normal glomerular filtration rate of 120 ml/min, the fractional reabsorption rate for l-lactate in mammalian kidney is >95% (1Craig F.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1946; 146: 146-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The molecular identity of the transport system that is responsible for such an effective absorption process in the kidney has not yet been established. l-Lactate transport across mammalian cell plasma membrane is mediated by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) 1The abbreviations used are: MCT, monocarboxylate transporter; SMCT, sodium-coupled MCT; HRPE, human retinal pigment epithelial (cell line); Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; NIS, Na+/iodide symporter; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.

Physiol. 2004; 447: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). MCTs are H+-coupled transporters and, therefore, the direction of lactate flux in mammalian cells depends on the net chemical gradients for H+ and lactate across the membrane. The transport process is electroneutral because of the H+/lactate stoichiometry of 1:1. There are several members within the MCT gene family that are expressed differentially in different tissues (2Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 3Halestrap A.P. Meredith D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Many of the MCT gene family members are expressed in the kidney (2Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 3Halestrap A.P. Meredith D.

Because the lumen-facing brush border membrane of the renal tubular cells mediates the first step in the reabsorption of solutes present in the glomerular filtrate, studies have been carried out to determine the transport mechanisms responsible for this process (6Barac-Nieto M. Murer H. Kinne R. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: F496-F506PubMed Google Scholar, 7Barbarat B. Podevin R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12190-12193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mengual R.

These studies have demonstrated that the renal brush border membrane possesses a Na+-coupled transport system for l-lactate. Interestingly, there is no evidence for the presence of any H+-coupled l-lactate transport system in this membrane (6Barac-Nieto M. Murer H. Kinne R. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: F496-F506PubMed Google Scholar). These findings show that MCTs do not play any role in the first step involved in the reabsorption of l-lactate in the kidney. There is no transport system expressed in mammalian tissues and known at the molecular level that has the ability to mediate Na+-coupled transport of l-lactate. Thus, the molecular identity of the renal transport system that mediates the active reabsorption of l-lactate remains unknown. Recently, Li et al. (11Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T.P. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Rerko R.M. Casey G. Issa J.P. Willis J. Willson J.K. Plass C. Markowitz S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8412-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) identified a candidate tumor suppressor gene that is silenced by methylation in human colon cancer. This gene (SLC5A8) codes for a putative transporter belonging to the SLC5 gene family (also known as the Na+/glucose cotransporter gene family). These investigators have also shown that SLC5A8 is a sodium transporter but failed to establish the identity of the cotransported substrate. The expression of this transporter in the colon and its predicted role as a tumor suppressor prompted us to test short-chain fatty acids as potential substrates for this transporter. Short-chain fatty acids such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate are produced in the colonic lumen at high concentrations by the bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates and dietary fiber (12Mortensen P.B. Clausen M.R. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1996; 216: 132-148Crossref Google Scholar, 13Velazquez O.C. Lederer H.M. Rombeau J.L. Adv. Exp. Med.

These fatty acids are the primary energy substrates for the colonic epithelium (12Mortensen P.B. Clausen M.R. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1996; 216: 132-148Crossref Google Scholar, 13Velazquez O.C.

In addition, they prevent colonic cell proliferation and reduce the incidence of colon cancer (16Pouillart P.R. Life Sci. 1998; 63: 1739-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Wachtershauser A. Stein J. Eur. J. Nutr. 2000; 39: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Blottiere H.M.

Cancer Drug Targets. 2003; 3: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we recently tested the hypothesis that SLC5A8 may be a Na+-coupled transporter for short-chain fatty acids (20Miyauchi S. Gopal E. Fei Y.J. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These studies showed that SLC5A8 does indeed mediate the Na+-coupled transport of the short-chain fatty acids acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Interestingly, the transporter also has the ability to mediate Na+-coupled transport of l-lactate. Because the substrate specificity of this Na+-coupled transporter is similar to that of the Na+-independent MCTs, we named this transporter the sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter (SMCT). The ability of SMCT to mediate Na+-coupled transport of l-lactate raises the question as to whether this transporter may be responsible for the active reabsorption of l-lactate in the kidney. To answer this question, we analyzed the expression of this transporter in mouse kidney by molecular cloning, in situ hybridization, functional studies of the cloned murine slc5a8, and a comparison of the functional characteristics of slc5a8 with those of l-lactate transport in purified renal brush border membrane vesicles. These studies demonstrate that SMCT is the transporter that is responsible for the active Na+-coupled reabsorption of l-lactate in mammalian kidney. Materials—The following radiolabeled carboxylates were obtained from commercial sources: l-[14C]Lactate, d-[14C]lactate, [14C]acetate, and [3H]propionate were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO); [14C]pyruvate, [14C]butyrate, [3H]succinate, and [14C]citrate were from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA); and [14C]pentanoate and [14C]hexanoate were from Sigma. Cloning of Mouse slc5a8 cDNA—A cDNA library was constructed in pSPORT1 vector using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from mouse kidney. The full-length murine slc5a8 cDNA was isolated from this library by homology screening. The nucleotide sequence of this clone has been deposited into the GenBank™ data base under the accession number AY484428. Functional Expression of Mouse slc5a8 in a Mammalian Cell Line— The vaccinia virus expression system was used to express the cloned mouse slc5a8 cDNA heterologously in the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line HRPE as described previously (20Miyauchi S. Gopal E. Fei Y.J. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The uptake of radiolabeled l-lactate and other short-chain fatty acids was measured in these cells 15 h following transfection. The transport buffer, in most cases, was 25 mm Mes/Tris (pH 6.5) containing 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm glucose. Transport measurements were made in parallel in vector-transfected cells and in slc5a8 cDNA-transfected cells to account for endogenous transport activity. The slc5a8-specific transport was determined by subtracting the transport values measured in vector-transfected cells from the transport values measured in cDNA-transfected cells. Functional Expression of Mouse slc5a8 in Xenopus laevis Oocytes— Capped cRNA from cloned mouse slc5a8 cDNA was synthesized using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Mature oocytes (stage IV or V) from X. laevis were injected with 50 ng of cRNA. Water-injected oocytes served as controls. The oocytes were used for electrophysiological studies 6 days after cRNA injection. Electrophysiological studies were performed by the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp method (20Miyauchi S. Gopal E. Fei Y.J. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Oocytes were perfused with a NaCl-containing buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.5), followed by the same buffer containing different fatty acids. The membrane potential was clamped at –50 mV. The differences between the steady-state currents measured in the presence and absence of substrates were considered as the substrate-induced currents. To investigate the current-membrane potential (I-V) relationship, step changes in membrane potential were applied, each for a duration of 100 ms in 20-mV increments. In the analysis of the saturation kinetics of substrate-induced currents, the kinetic parameter K0.5 (i.e. the substrate concentration necessary for the induction of half-maximal current) was calculated by fitting the values of the substrate-induced currents to a Michaelis-Menten equation. The Na+ activation kinetics of substrate-induced currents was analyzed by measuring the substrate-specific currents in the presence of increasing concentrations of Na+. The data from these experiments were analyzed by the Hill equation to determine the Hill coefficient (h, the number of Na+ ions involved in the activation process). The kinetic parameters were determined using the commercially available computer program Sigma Plot, version 6.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression and confirmed by linear regression. Determination of Charge/Substrate Transfer Ratio—The charge-to-substrate transfer ratio was determined for l-lactate and propionate in five different oocytes as described previously (20Miyauchi S. Gopal E. Fei Y.J. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21Wang H. Fei Y.J. Kekuda R. Yang-Feng T.L. Devoe L.D.

J. 2004; 378: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For the determination of the charge-to-substrate transfer ratio using the oocyte expression system, high levels of expression of heterologous cRNA are required. We found that the levels of expression of slc5a8 cRNA synthesized from the pSPORT1-slc5a8 cDNA construct were sufficient for simple electrophysiological characterization of the transport process but not for the determination of the charge-to-substrate transfer ratio. Therefore, we amplified the coding region of the murine slc5a8 cDNA by PCR and subcloned the fragment into oocyte expression vector pGH19. The pGH19 vector (kindly provided by Dr. Peter S. Aronson, Yale University School of Medicine) contains the 3′-untranslated region of the Xenopus β-globin gene downstream of the cloning site. cRNAs containing these elements are known to be expressed in oocytes at high levels (23Trudeau M.C. Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Robertson G.A. Science. 1995; 269: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 24Knauf F. Rogina B. Jiang Z. Aronson P.S. Helfand S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14315-14319Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The oocytes were perfused with either 50 μm l-lactate (unlabeled plus radiolabeled l-lactate) or 25 μm propionate (unlabeled plus radiolabeled propionate), and inward currents were monitored over a period of 8–10 min. At the end of the experiment, the amounts of l-lactate and propionate transported into the oocytes were calculated by measuring the radioactivity associated with the oocytes. The area within the curve describing the relationship between the time and inward current was integrated to calculate the charge transferred into the oocyte during incubation with l-lactate and propionate. The values for substrate transfer and charge transfer were used to determine the charge-to-substrate transfer ratio. Subcloning of the Mouse slc5a8 Coding Region in pGH19 Vector— The coding region of mouse slc5a8 was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GATATATAGCCATGGACGCGTCGCGGGACAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAGCTTCACAAGCGAGTCCCATTGATCTTGCC-3′ (antisense) and pSPORT1-slc5a8 cDNA as the template. A HindIII site (indicated by the underlining) was added to the 5′-end of the antisense primer for the purpose of subcloning. The PCR product was first subcloned in a pGEM-T vector and then the insert was released by EcoRI/HindIII double digestion. The pGH19 vector was linearized with EcoRI/HindIII and then used for the ligation of the slc5a8 cDNA insert. The resultant product was partially sequenced to confirm the orientation of the insert. Data Analysis—Experiments with HRPE cells were repeated three times with three independent transfections, and transport measurements were made in duplicate in each experiment. In most cases, electrophysiological measurements of substrate-induced currents were repeated at least three times with separate oocytes. The data are presented as means ± S.E. of these replicates. Statistical analyses were carried out using the Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Northern Blot—A commercially (Origene, Rockville, MD) available multiple tissue blot containing mRNA from different tissues of mouse was used to analyze the tissue expression pattern of slc5a8 transcripts in mouse. This blot did not contain mRNA from small intestine or colon. We therefore prepared a separate blot with mRNA isolated from mouse small intestine and colon. These blots were probed with a 32-P-labeled cDNA probe specific for mouse slc5a8. In Situ Hybridization—Sagittal sections of mouse kidneys were frozen immediately in Tissue-Tek OCT, sectioned at 10-μm thickness, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. As described in our previous publications (25Seth P. Ganapathy M.E. Conway S.J. Bridges C.D. Smith S.B. Casellas P. Ganapathy V. Biochim. Biophys.

Sections were permeabilized further with proteinase K (1 mg/ml) in PBS for 4 min. The proteinase K activity was stopped by rinsing the slides in glycine (2 mg/ml) in PBS. Sections were washed in PBS, equilibrated in 5% SSC, and prehybridized for 2 h at 58 °C in 50% (v/v) formamide, 5% SSC, 2% (w/v) blocking reagent (provided with the DIG nucleic acid detection kit), 0.1% (w/v) N-lauroylsarcosine, and 0.02% (w/v) SDS. Sections were hybridized with the antisense probe (1 μg/ml) and incubated overnight at 58 °C. The sections were washed twice in 2% SSC at 25 °C, twice in 1% SSC at 55 °C, and twice in 0.1% SSC at 37 °C. For immunologic detection of the probe, sections were washed in a buffer containing 0.1 m maleic acid and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.5) and blocked with the same buffer containing 1% blocking reagent. The anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was diluted 1:5000, and slides were incubated with this antibody for 2 h at 25 °C. Sections were washed in the preceding wash buffer containing levamisole (200 mg/ml) twice for 10 min and equilibrated with a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm MgCl2. The color reaction was developed in nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Slides were washed in distilled water and attached to coverslips but not counterstained so that the purplish red colored precipitate, indicative of a positive reaction, could be visualized in the sections. In all cases, some cryosections were hybridized with the sense probe to determine nonspecific binding. For the preparation of antisense and sense (negative control) riboprobes, a ∼500-bp fragment of mouse slc5a8 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pGEM-T vector, and the orientation of the insert was identified by sequencing. The primers used for PCR were 5′-CATTCGTCTCTGTGGCACAATC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAATCGCTGACACTTTCTTAGATG-3′ (antisense), which corresponded to nucleotide positions 693–714 and 1250–1273 in mouse slc5a8 cDNA. We confirmed the specificity of the probe for slc5a8 by searching the GenBank™ data base with the nucleotide sequence of the segment encompassed by the primers as the query. The probes were prepared by in vitro transcription with appropriate RNA polymerases (T7 RNA polymerase for the sense probe and SP6 RNA polymerase for the antisense probe) after linearizing the plasmid with suitable restriction enzymes (NdeI for the sense probe and NcoI for the antisense probe). Transport of l-Lactate in Purified Renal Brush Border Membrane Vesicles—Brush border membrane vesicles were prepared from rabbit kidney cortex by the Mg2+ aggregation method as described previously (27Tiruppathi C. Kulanthaivel P. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 28Tiruppathi C. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14870-14874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane vesicles were preloaded with 20 mm Hepes/Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 300 mm mannitol. The protein concentration of the membrane preparation was adjusted to 8 mg/ml. Uptake of [14C]-l-lactate (10 μm) in these membrane vesicles was measured by the rapid filtration method (27Tiruppathi C. Kulanthaivel P. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 28Tiruppathi C. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14870-14874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Uptake was initiated by mixing 40 μlof membrane suspension with 160 μl of uptake buffer containing radiolabeled l-lactate. The uptake buffer in most experiments was 20 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl. When uptake was monitored in the absence of Na+, the uptake buffer was modified by substituting NaCl with an equimolar concentration of KCl. Uptake measurements were made in triplicate, and the experiments were repeated with two different membrane preparations. Structural Features of Mouse slc5a8 —The mouse slc5a8 cDNA is 5,346-bp-long and codes for a protein consisting of 611 amino acids. The sequence has been deposited into the GenBank™ (accession number AY484428). Hydrophobicity analysis of the amino acid sequence predicts 13 transmembrane domains in the protein with the amino terminus at the exoplasmic side of the membrane and the carboxyl terminus at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. With this topology model, mouse slc5a8 has two putative N-glycosylation sites situated between transmembrane domains 12 and 13. The amino acid sequence of mouse slc5a8 is 95% identical to that of human SLC5A8. It also shows close homology to that of sodium-coupled iodide symporter (NIS) and sodium-coupled multivitamin transporter (SMVT). The sequence identity is 50% with mouse NIS and 46% with mouse SMVT. The amino acid sequence derived from the mouse clone is 100% identical to the sequence that was deposited in the GenBank™ (accession number BAC30480) as an unnamed protein product based on the mouse genome sequence. Tissue Expression Pattern of slc5a8 in Mouse—Northern blot analysis indicates that slc5a8 transcripts are detectable only in the colon, small intestine, and kidney in mouse (Fig. 1). There is no detectable expression of the transporter in the heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and testis. There are three different transcripts (3, 4, and 5.4 kb). Although all three transcripts are expressed in equal amounts in the kidney, the 4- and 5.4-kb transcripts are predominant in the colon and small intestine. Functional Features of Mouse slc5a8 in a Mammalian Cell Expression System—To analyze the transport function of the cloned mouse slc5a8, we first used a mammalian cell expression system. We expressed the cDNA in HRPE cells using the vaccinia virus expression technique and compared the uptake of l-lactate in vector-transfected cells and in cDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). The uptake of l-lactate was significantly higher in cDNA-transfected cells than in control cells. The increase was ∼2-fold. The cDNA-induced l-lactate uptake was influenced by extracellular pH, with optimal uptake occurring at pH 6.5 (Fig. 2B). We then evaluated the transport of eight different monocarboxylates as well as the dicarboxylate succinate and the tricarboxylate citrate using the respective radiolabeled substrates (Table I). The uptake of l-lactate, d-lactate, pyruvate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, pentanoate, and hexanoate was significantly higher in cells expressing mouse slc5a8 than in control cells transfected with empty vector (25–75% increase; p < 0.05). In contrast, the uptakes of succinate and citrate were not different between the control cells and the cDNA-transfected cells. These data show that the cloned mouse slc5a8 is capable of transporting various monocarboxylates. The Na+-dependent nature of mouse slc5a8 was analyzed by studying l-lactate uptake in vector-transfected cells and in cDNA-transfected cells in the presence or absence of Na+. The uptake of l-lactate was ∼90% higher in cells expressing mouse slc5a8 than in control cells when measured in the presence of Na+. But, the cDNA-induced l-lactate uptake was not detectable when measured in the absence of Na+. K+ and Li+ were unable to substitute for Na+ in the uptake process mediated by mouse slc5a8. We also tested the Na+-dependent nature of the transporter with four other substrates (pyruvate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate), and the data showed that the uptakes of these substrates mediated by mouse slc5a8 were also absolutely dependent on the presence of Na+ (data not shown).Table IUptake of various carboxylates by mouse slc5a8Carboxylate substrateUptakeIncreasepSPORT1slc5a8nmol/106 cells/20 min%l-Lactate (50 μm)0.77 ± 0.051.18 ± 0.04ap < 0.05.53d-Lactate (20 μm)0.19 ± 0.010.33 ± 0.02ap < 0.05.74Pyruvate (50 μm)0.65 ± 0.020.89 ± 0.05ap < 0.05.37Acetate (50 μm)0.45 ± 0.020.76 ± 0.06ap < 0.05.69Propionate (50 μm)0.57 ± 0.030.79 ± 0.04ap < 0.05.39Butyrate (50 μm)1.66 ± 0.091.99 ± 0.04ap < 0.05.20Pentanoate (500 μm)3.93 ± 0.124.93 ± 0.22ap < 0.05.26Hexanoate (400 μm)2.53 ± 0.053.11 ± 0.11ap < 0.05.23Succinate (50 μm)0.11 ± 0.010.12 ± 0.029Citrate (50 μm)0.07 ± 0.010.07 ± 0.010a p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Insensitivity of slc5a8 Transport Function to α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic Acid—Because the substrate specificity of slc5a8 was similar to that of MCTs, we examined the influence of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, a specific inhibitor of MCTs (2Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 3Halestrap A.P. Meredith D. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), on the transport function of slc5a8. We measured the uptake of l-lactate and pyruvate in vector-transfected cells and cDNA-transfected cells in parallel in the absence and presence of 5 mm α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Fig. 3). In the absence of the MCT inhibitor, the expression of slc5a8 increased the uptake of l-lactate by 55 ± 5%. Interestingly, the MCT-specific inhibitor did not inhibit l-lactate uptake mediated by slc5a8. Instead, it stimulated the transport function of slc5a8 to a significant extent. In the presence of the inhibitor, the uptake of l-lactate increased 170 ± 7% in cDNA-transfected cells compared with control cells. A similar phenomenon was observed with pyruvate as the substrate. In the absence of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, the uptake of pyruvate was only 30 ± 3% higher in slc5a8-expressing cells than in control cells. However, when the inhibitor was present, the uptake of pyruvate in slc5a8-expressing cells was 165 ± 15% higher than in control cells. We then monitored the ability of short-chain fatty acids to inhibit slc5a8-mediated l-lactate uptake in the presence of the MCT inhibitor. All three short-chain fatty acids tested (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) inhibited the uptake of l-lactate via slc5a8 (Table II). At a"

Neuronal expression of apoE4 or apoE4 fragments in transgenic mice increases tau phosphorylation. To identify the kinase responsible for the increase, we studied transgenic mice expressing human apoE3 or apoE4 in neurons under the control of the neuron-specific enolase promoter. Brain levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and phosphorylated (active) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-Erk) increased with age in both groups but were considerably higher in the apoE4 mice. Other candidate kinases, including glycogen synthase kinase 3beta and cyclin-dependent kinase-5 and its activators p25 and p35, were not significantly altered. The increases in p-Erk and p-tau were highest in the hippocampus, intermediate in the cortex, and lowest in the cerebellum. In the hippocampus, p-Erk and p-tau accumulated in the hilus and CA3 region of the dentate gyrus, where high levels of zinc are found along mossy fibers. In Neuro-2a cells stably expressing apoE3 or apoE4, treatment with ZnCl2 generated 2-fold more p-Erk and 3-fold more p-tau in the apoE4-expressing cells. Phosphorylation of Erk and tau was reduced by preincubation with the Erk pathway inhibitor U0126. Thus, increased tau phosphorylation in apoE4 transgenic mice was associated with Erk activation and could be modified by zinc, suggesting that apoE4 and zinc act in concert to contribute to the pathogenesis of AD."

The mammalian hyaluronidases are considered to be involved in many (patho)physiological processes like fertilization, tumor growth, and metastasis. Bacterial hyaluronidases, also termed hyaluronate lyases, contribute to the spreading of microorganisms in tissues.

Here we show that l-ascorbic acid 6-hexadecanoate (Vcpal) is a potent inhibitor of both streptococcal and bovine testicular hyaluronidase (BTH). Vcpal showed strong inhibition of Streptococcus agalactiae hyaluronate lyase with an IC50 of 4 μm and weaker inhibition of SpnHL and BTH with IC50 values of 100 and 56 μm, respectively. To date, Vcpal has proved to be one of the most potent inhibitors of hyaluronidase. We also determined the x-ray structure of the SpnHL-Vcpal complex and confirmed the hypothesis that additional hydrophobic interactions with Phe-343, His-399, and Thr-400 in the active site led to increased inhibition. A homology structural model of BTH was also generated to suggest binding modes of Vcpal to this hyaluronidase.

FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). It has been identified in essentially all vertebrates and in the capsule of some bacteria. HA is the common preferred substrate of a class of enzymes termed hyaluronidases. The enzymes from bacterial sources are hyaluronate lyases (EC 4.2.2.1) (2Kreil G.

The main degradation products are usually unsaturated disaccharides or tetrasaccharides, which might be utilized by bacteria as an additional carbon source (12Hynes W. Walton S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 183: 201-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The degradation of HA in the host extracellular matrix decreases the viscoelasticity of the ground substance leading to increased spreading of bacteria and the associated toxins in the tissue (12Hynes W. Walton S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 183: 201-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hyaluronidases of eukaryotes are present in many tissues and organs, e.g. the liver, kidney, testes, etc. as well as in the venom of bees, wasps, etc. and the salivary glands of leeches. The latter enzymes act as endo-N-acetylglucosaminidases (hyaluronate glycanohydrolases, EC 3.2.1.35 and EC 3.2.1.36) (2Kreil G. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1666-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 13Meyer K. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3. Academic Press, New York1971: 307-320Google Scholar). Bovine testicular hyaluronidase (BTH) and the distantly related bee venom hyaluronidase (BVH) are well known representatives of these eukaryotic enzymes, but structural information is only available for the bee venom hyaluronidase (14Markovic-Housley Z. Miglinerini G. Soldatova L. Rizkallah P. Müller U. Schirmer T. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). To date, six human hyaluronidases have been cloned (15Csoka A.B. Frost G.I. Stern R. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), and three of them have been expressed in different cell lines, but no larger amounts of the enzymes have been produced for enzymological characterization and structural determination due to difficult isolation and/or purification. Furthermore, in contrast to the bacterial enzymes, the human enzymes, the PH-20 protein, Hyal-1 (16Csoka T.B. Frost G.I. Wong T. Stern R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and Hyal-2, probably exist in several isoforms. They seem to play crucial roles in physiological and pathophysiological processes like fertilization (17Cherr G.N. Yudin A.I. Overstreet J.W. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), embryonic development (18Lepperdinger G. Mullegger J. Kreil G.

Cancer Lett. 2001; 163: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). But, due in part to the lack of potent and selective inhibitors, most of these functions are far from clear. Selective hyaluronidase inhibitors are needed to study the relationships between the enzyme activity and the physiological and pathophysiological effects of hyaluronidases. Moreover hyaluronidase inhibitors could be useful as drugs, e.g. in the treatment of arthroses or, combined with antibiotics, in antibacterial therapy of hyaluronate lyase producing bacteria, e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major human Gram-positive pathogen.

Stern R. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For bacterial hyaluronate lyases, l-ascorbic acid (Vc) (Fig. 1) has been described as a competitive inhibitor of the S. pneumoniae enzyme (SpnHL) with an IC50 value of ∼6 mm (25Li S. Taylor K.B. Kelly S.J. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15125-15130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and various unsaturated fatty acids have been reported to inhibit Streptococcus dysgalactiae hyaluronidase with IC50 values ranging from 1–172 μm (26Suzuki K. Terasaki Y. Uyeda M. J. Enzyme Inhib. Med. Chem. 2002; 17: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, no potent and selective hyaluronidase inhibitors are known to date. Recently, however, the structural basis of the SpnHL-Vc interaction has been elucidated by means of x-ray crystallography (25Li S. Taylor K.B. Kelly S.J. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15125-15130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This structure shows binding of Vc in the active site of the enzyme, and among all the interactions between Vc and the enzyme the importance of hydrophobic interactions with Trp-292 and Tyr-408 is evident. This in turn has suggested that Vc derivatives with increased hydrophobicity might have higher inhibitory activity. To test this hypothesis, l-ascorbic acid 6-hexadecanoate (Vcpal), a highly effective antioxidant (27Klein E. Weber N. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 1224-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and glutathione S-transferase inhibitor (28Mitra A. Govindwar S. Joseph P. Kulkarni A. Toxicol. Lett. 1992; 60: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), was examined as a potential hyaluronidase inhibitor. We therefore investigated the inhibitory effect of Vcpal on the enzymatic activity of two bacterial hyaluronate lyases from S. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae strain 4755 (SagHL) and BTH as the representative of mammalian hyaluronidases. Additionally the structure of SpnHL, co-crystallized with Vcpal, was determined at 1.65-Å resolution providing an opportunity to examine the protein-Vcpal interactions at the molecular level. A homology model of BTH 2Coordinates of the BTH homology model are available from the authors upon request. based on the crystal structure of bee venom hyaluronidase in complex with a HA tetrasaccharide fragment was constructed, and potential modes of binding of Vcpal were predicted by flexible docking. The results should set the stage for the design and development of more potent and selective hyaluronidase inhibitors.

J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 220: 303-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was quantified by determining the turbidity caused by the residual high molecular mass substrate (molecular mass > 6–8 kDa) precipitated with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. The incubation mixture contained 120 μl of citrate-phosphate buffer (solution A: 0.1 m Na2HPO4, 0.1 m NaCl, solution B: 0.1 m citric acid, 0.1 m NaCl; solution A and B were mixed in the appropriate proportions to reach pH 5.0), 30 μl of BSA solution (0.2 mg/ml in water), 30 μl of HA substrate solution (2 mg/ml in water), 50 μl of H2O, 10 μl of Me2SO, and 30 μl of enzyme solution. To account for the different enzymatic mechanisms of bacterial and bovine hyaluronidases the assays were normalized by using equiactive concentrations of 54 ng of bovine testicular hyaluronidase or 2.9 ng of hyaluronate lyase from S. agalactiae strain 4755 or 1.7 ng of hyaluronate lyase from S. pneumoniae in 30 μl of BSA solution. To determine the enzyme activities in the presence of the test compounds, instead of 10 μl of Me2SO 10 μl of varying concentrations of inhibitor were used resulting in a final concentration range from 1.1 to 300 μm for Vcpal and from 1 to 20 mm for Vc, respectively. The final Me2SO concentration was 3.8% (v/v). After incubation of the assay mixture for 30 min at 37 °C, 720 μl of a 2.5% (w/v) cetyltrimethylammonium bromide solution (2.5 g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide dissolved in 100 ml of 0.5 m sodium hydroxide solution, pH 12.5) were added to precipitate the residual high molecular weight substrate and to stop the enzyme reaction. This mixture was again incubated at 25 °C for 20 min, and the turbidity of each sample was determined at 600 nm with a Uvikon 930 UV spectrophotometer (Kontron, Eching, Germany). Experiments were performed in quadruplicate. The turbidity of the sample without inhibitor was taken as reference for 100% enzyme activity, whereas the turbidity of the sample without enzyme (30 μl of BSA solution were used instead) was taken as reference for 0% enzyme activity. The activities were plotted against the logarithm of the inhibitor concentration, and IC50 values were calculated by curve fitting of the experimental data with Sigma Plot 8.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Crystallization of the Complex—For crystallization experiments, the Vcpal was dissolved in 5% Me2SO (v/v), 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4 to the final concentration of 50 mm. The hanging drop vapor diffusion (34McPherson A. Crystallization of Biological Molecules. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1999Google Scholar) using Linbro culture plates (Hampton Research Inc.) at room temperature was used to grow the crystals of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. Equal volumes of protein and reservoir solution (1 μl each) and various amounts of inhibitor solutions (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 μl) were mixed and equilibrated against 1 ml of the reservoir solution. The reservoir solution contained 60–65% saturated ammonium sulfate, 0.2 m NaCl, 2% dioxane, and 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) as reported for the native enzyme crystallization (31Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Mewbourne R.B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). X-ray Diffraction—The crystals of the enzyme-inhibitor complex were cryoprotected using 30% xylitol (w/v), 3.5 m ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) as reported for the native crystals (9Li S. Kelly S. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Standard fiber loops (Hampton Research Inc.) of a suitable size were used to pick up and mount the frozen crystals under a nitrogen flow at -180 °C. The x-ray diffraction data for the enzyme-inhibitor complex was collected using rotation (oscillation) photography and a Quantum 4u CCD detector. The crystallographic setup of beamline 5.0.1 of the Berkeley Center for Structural Biology, Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory was used. The collected data were analyzed, indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 software package (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The crystals were isomorphous to the native S. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase crystals (31Jedrzejas M.J. Chantalat L. Mewbourne R.B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The statistics of the native diffraction data were analyzed.

Water molecules were placed into 3 σ positive peaks in |Fo−Fc| maps when density was also evident in |2Fo−Fc| maps and suitable hydrogen bonding partners were available. The ligand Vcpal was modeled into the catalytic site according to the strong, immediately evident difference density. Sulfate and xylitol molecules, deriving from the crystallization and cryocooling solutions, respectively, were modeled into suitably shaped regions of electron density. Final statistics for the model are shown in Table II. Programs of the CCP4 package (40Collaborative Computational Project No4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

For the homology modeling of BTH the crystal structures of bee venom hyaluronidase were used as templates (Protein Data Bank codes 1fcq, 1fcu, and 1fcv). Since the sequence identity between BTH and bee venom hyaluronidase is only 32%, a multiple sequence alignment including the human PH-20 protein was performed to get more reliable results. The amino acid sequence of BTH (43Meyer M.F. Kreil G. Aschauer H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was aligned with the sequences of bee venom hyaluronidase extracted from the crystal structures and of the human PH-20 protein (Swiss-Prot accession number p38567) using the program ClustalW (44Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). After manual refinement of the sequence alignment a homology model was generated using MODELLER, Version 6.2 (45Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). The resulting model was evaluated for correct local geometry using Procheck (46Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and the SYBYL module PROTABLE. Then the model was protonated using SYBYL 6.8 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO) and energetically minimized with the AMBER all-atom force field (47Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz Jr., K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar) with AMBER all-atom charges (distance-dependent dielectricity constant, 4) up to a root mean square gradient of 0.1 kcal/mol/Å (Powell conjugate gradient). Surfaces and lipophilic potentials of the model were calculated and visualized by the program MOLCAD contained within SYBYL 6.8. Flexible Docking of l-Ascorbic Acid 6-Hexadecanoate Using FlexX— The three-dimensional structure of Vcpal was generated with the SYBYL SKETCH module and energetically minimized using Tripos Force Field with Gasteiger-Hueckel charges (distance-dependent dielectric constant, 1) up to a root mean square gradient of 0.05 kcal/mol/Å (Powell conjugate gradient). The binding pocket of BTH was defined by the amino acids within a sphere of 4 Å around Tyr-220 and Trp-341. All docking calculations were performed with FlexX, Version 1.12 (48Rarey M. Kramer B. Lengauer T. Proteins. 1999; 34: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Previous versions of FlexX tended to overestimate affinity of hydrogen-bonded ligands and performed poorly with relatively lipophilic binding sites (49Stahl M. Rarey M. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Due to the amphiphilic substrate hyaluronan the active site of BTH consists of many polar, mostly ionic amino acids but also contains some hydrophobic residues. Therefore we used the recently developed scoring function ScreenScore that incorporates hydrophobic (50Gehlhaar D.K. Verkhivker G.M. Rejto P.A. Sherman C.J. Fogel D.B. Fogel L.J. Freer S.T. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 317-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) and hydrogen bond score contributions with more realistic weights. Apart from water particle placement (48Rarey M. Kramer B. Lengauer T. Proteins. 1999; 34: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and ScreenScore as a fitness and scoring function for base placement and flexible incremental docking, standard parameters were applied. The results were analyzed and visualized with FlexV, Version 1.6, and SYBYL 6.8. Comparison of Inhibitory Activities of l-Ascorbic Acid and l-Ascorbic Acid 6-Hexadecanoate on Different Hyaluronidases—Recently the inhibitory effects of Vc on SpnHL and BTH have been investigated. In contrast to BTH, Vc inhibits the SpnHL with an IC50 value of around 6 mm under the experimental conditions used (25Li S. Taylor K.B. Kelly S.J. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15125-15130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In our normalized assays with equiactive concentrations the bacterial enzymes were weakly inhibited by Vc with IC50 values of 6 mm for SagHL and 32 mm for SpnHL, respectively, whereas the bovine enzyme was not affected up to 100 mm. Therefore, Vc proved to be a weak but selective inhibitor of streptococcal hyaluronate lyases. Under physiological conditions Vc is suggested to trigger a natural, low level defense mechanism in the human organism against pneumococcal invasion. That Vc weakly inhibits bacterial hyaluronate lyase (25Li S. Taylor K.B. Kelly S.J. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15125-15130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) indicates for the first time that such effects are possibly at least in part related to this enzyme, which is also described as a “spreading factor” facilitating bacterial spread in the host tissues. The crystal structure of the S. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase-Vc complex has been determined (25Li S. Taylor K.B. Kelly S.J. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15125-15130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and suggests which variations of this compound might lead to stronger inhibitors of the enzyme. One possibility is the introduction of lipophilic chains in the 6-position of Vc corresponding to the presence and topology of hydrophobic residues in the catalytic cleft (25Li S. Taylor K.B. Kelly S.J. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15125-15130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic interactions also play an important role for the substrate HA since it has been shown to form a 2-fold helical structure with an extensive hydrophobic patch of about eight CH uni"
https://openalex.org/W2069655842,"Castor bean endosperm contains a well known acid lipase activity that is associated with the oil body membrane. In order to identify this enzyme, proteomic analysis was performed on purified oil bodies. A approximately 60-kDa protein was identified (RcOBL1), which shares homology with a lipase from the filamentous fungus Rhizomucor miehei. RcOBL1 contains features that are characteristic of an alpha/beta-hydrolase, such as a putative catalytic triad (SDH) and a conserved pentapeptide (GXSXG) surrounding the nucleophilic serine residue. RcOBL1 was expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli and shown to hydrolyze triolein at an acid pH (optima approximately 4.5). RcOBL1 can hydrolyze a range of triacylglycerols but is not active on phospholipids. The activity is sensitive to the serine reagent diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate, indicating that RcOBL1 is a serine esterase. Antibodies raised against RcOBL1 were used to show that the protein is restricted to the endosperm where it is associated with the surface of oil bodies. This is the first evidence for the molecular identity of an oil body-associated lipase from plants. Sequence comparisons reveal that families of OBL1-like proteins are present in many species, and it is likely that they play an important role in regulating lipolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1996461835,"The MUC1 transforming protein is aberrantly overexpressed by most human carcinomas. Recent studies demonstrated that MUC1 confers a protective function against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis; however, the mechanisms responsible for this response are not known. The present work demonstrates that MUC1 regulates FKHRL1/FOXO3a, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors that induces oxidant scavenging and DNA repair. We show that MUC1 attenuates activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase → phospho-Akt/PKB pathway in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells and thereby decreases FOXO3a phosphorylation. MUC1 is expressed as an N-terminal ectodomain that is tethered to the cell surface by a C-terminal transmembrane subunit. The results demonstrate that the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to induce FOXO3a activation and attenuation of oxidative stress. We also demonstrate that stable down-regulation of endogenous MUC1 in ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells inactivates FOXO3a, increases intracellular oxidant levels, and sensitizes cells to H2O2-induced necrosis. These findings indicate that MUC1 regulates the FOXO3a signaling pathway in a survival response to oxidative stress.

FOXO3a function is controlled in part by growth factor binding to specific receptor tyrosine kinases and the activation of PI3K.

In turn, Akt phosphorylates FOXO3a, resulting in binding of FOXO3a to 14-3-3 proteins and retention of FOXO3a in the cytoplasm (23Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M. Lin M. Jou P. Hu L. Anderson M.

Fornace Jr., A.J. DiStefano P.S. Chiang L.W. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2002; 296: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Moreover, FOXO3a-mediated activation of Gadd45a expression has indicated that FOXO3a contributes to DNA repair in the response to genotoxic stress (25Tran H. Brunet A. Grenier J.M. Datta S.R. Fornace Jr., A.J. DiStefano P.S. Chiang L.W. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2002; 296: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). FOXO3a also contributes to the induction of apoptosis by activating expression of the Fas ligand gene (23Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M. Lin M. Jou P. Hu L. Anderson M. Arden K. Blenis J. Greenberg M. Cell. 1999; 17: 1959-1968Google Scholar). These findings have indicated that, under lower levels of stress, FOXO3a activates a repair and survival response, and in the presence of irreparable damage, FOXO3a contributes to an apoptotic response. The present studies demonstrate that MUC1 activates FOXO3a. We show that MUC1-CD is sufficient to activate FOXO3a, decrease intracellular ROS levels, and attenuate ROS-induced apoptosis. The results also demonstrate that knocking down MUC1 inactivates FOXO3a and increases the sensitivity of cells to oxidative stress. Cell Culture—HCT116/vector, HCT116/MUC1, and HCT116/MUC1-CD colon carcinoma cells (8Li Y. Ren J. Yu W.-H. Li G. Kuwahara H. Yin L. Carraway K.L. Kufe D. J. Biol.

Ther. 2003; 2: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, Cellgro) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. ZR-75-1 breast carcinoma cells stably expressing a control small interfering RNA (CsiRNA) or a MUC1-specific (MUC1siRNA) (16Ren J. Agata N. Chen D. Li Y. Yu W.-H. Huang L. Raina D. Chen W. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and l-glutamine. Cells were seeded, cultured for 24 h, and then exposed to H2O2 (Sigma) or LY294002 (Sigma). Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed as described (17Yin L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Akt (anti-p-Akt; Cell Signaling Inc.), anti-Akt (Cell Signaling Inc.), anti-phospho-FOXO3a (anti-p-FOXO3a, Cell Signaling Inc.), anti-FOXO3a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-MUC1 C-ter (Ab5, NeoMarkers), anti-cytochrome c (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Inc.), and anti-PKCδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of H2O2 Levels—Cells were incubated with 10 μm DCFH-DA (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence of oxidized DCF was measured at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells were transfected with pFHRE-Luc (23Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M. Lin M. Jou P. Hu L. Anderson M. Arden K. Blenis J. Greenberg M. Cell. 1999; 17: 1959-1968Google Scholar) and SV-40-Renilla Luc (Promega) at a ratio of 10:1 in the presence of LipofectAMINE for 24 h. After washing and incubation for an additional 10 h, the cells were treated with H2O2 and then lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Lysates were analyzed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the dual luciferase reagent assay kit (Promega). Assays of Apoptosis and Necrosis—Sub-G1 DNA content was assessed by staining ethanol-fixed and citrate buffer-permeabilized cells with propidium iodide and monitoring by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) as described (12Ren J. Li Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17616-17622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For assessment of necrosis, cells were incubated in 1 μg/ml propidium iodide/phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature and then monitored by flow cytometry. Clonogenic Survival—Cells were treated with 0.12 mm H2O2 for 16 h, washed, and maintained in complete medium for 10–14 days. Colonies of more than 20 cells were detected by Giemsa staining and scored as positive. MUC1 Attenuates p-Akt and p-FOXO3a Signaling—To determine whether MUC1 affects activation of the PI3K → p-Akt → p-FKHR pathway, lysates from HCT116/vector and HCT116/MUC1 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody against p-Akt. Constitutive levels of p-Akt were higher in HCT116/vector cells as compared with that in two separately isolated clones of HCT116/MUC1 cells (Fig. 1A). Exposure of the HCT116/vector cells to H2O2 was associated with an increase in p-Akt (Fig. 1A). By contrast, phosphorylation of Akt was attenuated in the H2O2-treated HCT116/MUC1 cells (Fig. 1A). The demonstration that Akt levels are similar in the HCT116/vector and HCT116/MUC1 cells indicated that MUC1 expression is associated with decreased phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 1A). As found for p-Akt, H2O2-induced phosphorylation of FOXO3a was also attenuated in the HCT116 cells expressing MUC1 (Fig. 1B). Moreover, we found that H2O2 exposure is associated with increases in FOXO3a levels in both HCT116/vector and HCT116/MUC1 cells (Fig. 1B). To determine whether PI3K contributes to phosphorylation of Akt and FOXO3a, we pretreated the HCT116 cells with the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. The results show that LY294002 decreases constitutive and H2O2-induced p-Akt levels in HCT116/vector cells (Fig. 1C). LY294002 also decreased the constitutively low p-Akt levels in HCT116/MUC1 cells (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained in the separately isolated HCT116/MUC1 clones (data not shown). LY294002 treatment was also associated with decreases in FOXO3a phosphorylation (Fig. 1D), indicating that PI3K regulates p-Akt and p-FOXO3a in both HCT116/vector and HCT116/MUC1 cells. These findings indicate that MUC1 regulates activation of the PI3K → p-Akt → p-FOXO3a pathway. MUC1-CD Is Sufficient to Regulate ROS Levels—To define the region of MUC1 that regulates p-FOXO3a, we performed studies on HCT116 cells stably expressing only the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain (MUC1-CD) (Fig. 2A). Treatment of two separately isolated HCT116/MUC1-CD clones with H2O2 had no detectable effect on MUC1-CD expression (Fig. 2A). To determine whether MUC1-CD affects ROS levels, the cells were incubated with DCFH-DA, and H2O2-mediated oxidation of the fluorochrome was assayed by flow cytometry. As shown for full-length MUC1 (17Yin L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and compared with HCT116/vector cells, expression of MUC1-CD was associated with a substantial decrease in H2O2 levels (Fig. 2B). The cells were also exposed to H2O2 and then assayed for oxidation of DCFH-DA. Compared with HCT116/vector cells, H2O2 levels were attenuated in the HCT116/MUC1-CD, as compared with those in HCT116/vector cells (Fig. 2C). These findings indicate that MUC1-CD is sufficient to confer regulation of oxidant levels. MUC1-CD Is Sufficient to Attenuate PI3K → p-Akt → p-FOXO3a Signaling—Immunoblot analysis of lysates from the HCT116/MUC1-CD cells demonstrated a decrease in p-Akt levels compared with those in HCT116/vector cells (Fig. 3A). H2O2-induced increases in p-Akt as found in HCT116/vector cells were also attenuated by MUC1-CD expression (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained when the lysates from control and H2O2-treated cells were probed for p-FOXO3a and FOXO3a (Fig. 3B), indicating that, like full-length MUC1, MUC1-CD down-regulates Akt and FOXO3a signaling. In addition, treatment with LY294002 decreased constitutive and H2O2-induced levels of p-Akt and p-FOXO3a in both the HCT116/vector and HCT116/MUC1-CD cells (data not shown). Phosphorylated FOXO3a binds to cytosolic 14-3-3 and is thereby sequestered from activating gene transcription. To assess the effects of MUC1 on FOXO3a-dependent transcription, we transfected HCT116 cells with the pF-HRE-Luc reporter construct (23Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M. Lin M. Jou P. Hu L. Anderson M. Arden K. Blenis J. Greenberg M. Cell. 1999; 17: 1959-1968Google Scholar). Analysis of Luc activity demonstrated that activation of the reporter is ∼15-fold higher in the HCT116/MUC1 compared with that in HCT116/vector cells (Fig. 3C). In addition, treatment with H2O2 had little effect on FOXO3a-mediated transcription (Fig. 3C). In concert with these results, the pFHRE-Luc reporter construct was activated over 10-fold in HCT116/MUC1-CD as compared with HCT116/vector cells (Fig. 3D). These findings indicate that MUC1-CD is sufficient to confer attenuation of the PI3K → p-Akt → p-FOXO3a signaling pathway and thereby activation of FOXO3a-mediated transcription. MUC1-CD Attenuates the Apoptotic Response to Oxidative Stress—To determine whether MUC1-CD protects against H2O2-induced apoptosis, we first monitored release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol. Treatment of HCT116/vector cells with H2O2 was associated with increases in cytosolic cytochrome c (Fig. 4A). By contrast, this response was attenuated in the HCT116/MUC1-CD cells (Fig. 4A). H2O2 treatment was also associated with activation of caspase-3 in HCT116/vector but not HCT116/MUC1-CD cells (Fig. 4A). PKCδ is a caspase-3 substrate that is cleaved to a constitutively active catalytic fragment (27Emoto Y. Manome G. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In concert with the results for caspase-3 activation, full-length PKCδ was cleaved to PKCδ catalytic fragment in HCT116/vector but not HCT116/MUC1-CD cells (Fig. 4A). As an additional assessment of the apoptotic response, the HCT116 cells were assayed for H2O2-induced sub-G1 DNA. Treatment of the HCT116/vector cells with H2O2 was associated with greater than 30% apoptosis (Fig. 4B). By contrast, H2O2 had no apparent effect on induction of sub-G1 DNA in HCT116/MUC1-CD cells (Fig. 4B). Analysis of sub-G1 data from three independent experiments confirmed that MUC1-CD expression substantially attenuates H2O2-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4C). Down-regulation of MUC1 Increases H2O2 Levels—To determine whether knocking down MUC1 expression affects oxidant levels, we stably expressed a CsiRNA or a MUC1siRNA in MUC1-positive ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells. Immunoblot analysis confirmed down-regulation of MUC1 N-ter and C-ter expression in ZR-75-1/MUC1siRNA (two separately isolated clones) but not in ZR-75-1/CsiRNA cells (Fig. 5A). As assessed by oxidation of DCFH-DA, down-regulation of MUC1 was associated with an increase in intracellular H2O2 levels (Fig. 5B). Moreover, treatment of the ZR-75-1/MUC1siRNA cells with H2O2 was associated with a substantial increase in DCFH-DA oxidation as compared with the attenuated response in H2O2-treated ZR-75-1/CsiRNA cells (Fig. 5C). Analysis of three separate experiments confirmed that constitutive H2O2 levels are increased by knocking down MUC1 and that the response to H2O2 treatment is attenuated in ZR-75-1/CsiRNA as compared with ZR-75-1/MUC1siRNA cells (Fig. 5D). These results indicate that endogenous MUC1 functions in the regulation of H2O2 levels. Down-regulation of MUC1 Activates PI3K → p-Akt → p-FOXO3a Signaling—To determine whether knocking down MUC1 affects activation of Akt, lysates from control and H2O2-treated ZR-75-1 cells were analyzed for p-Akt. Levels of p-Akt were markedly lower in ZR-75-1/CsiRNA cells compared with that in ZR-75-1/MUC1siRNA cells (Fig. 6A). Moreover, levels of Akt protein were substantially increased as a result of knocking down MUC1 expression (Fig. 6A). H2O2 treatment had little if any effect on p-Akt or Akt levels in the ZR-75-1/CsiRNA and ZR-75-1/MUC1siRNA cells (Fig. 6A). p-FOXO3a and FOXO3a levels were also increased by knocking down MUC1 expression (Fig. 6B). Treatment of the ZR-75-1/MUC1siRNA cells with LY294002 attenuated the increases in p-Akt but had little effect on Akt levels (Fig. 6C). LY294002 also attenuated increases in p-FOXO3a associated with knocking down MUC1 expression (Fig. 6C). These findings indicate that knocking down MUC1 expression is associated with activation of the PI3K → p-Akt → p-FOXO3a pathway. Knocking Down MUC1 Increases Sensitivity to Oxidative Stress—Expression of MUC1 in HCT116 cells attenuates the apoptotic response to oxidative stress (17Yin L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of knocking down MUC1, ZR-75-1 cells were exposed to H2O2 and monitored for sub-G1 DNA. There was no detectable induction of sub-G1 DNA in H2O2-treated ZR-75-1/CsiRNA or ZR-75-1/MUC1siRNA cells (data not shown). We also found no significant effect of H2O2 on annexin-V staining (data not shown), indicating that ZR-75-1 cells positive or negative for MUC1 expression are null for an apoptotic response to oxidative stress. To determine whether ZR-75-1 cells exhibit a necrotic response, we monitored uptake of propidium iodide as a measure of loss of cell membrane integrity. Flow cytometric analysis of control and H2O2-treated ZR-75-1/CsiRNA cells demonstrated a modest necrotic response to oxidative stress (Fig. 7A). By contrast, propidium iodide staining was increased substantially following H2O2 treatment of ZR-75-1/MUC1siRNA cells (Fig. 7A). Similar results were obtained in 3 separate experiments (Fig. 7B), indicating that MUC1 protects against H2O2-induced necrosis of ZR-75-1 cells. To extend these results, we assayed control and H2O2-treated ZR-75-1 cells for colony formation as a measure of survival. H2O2 treatment of ZR-75-1/CsiRNA cells was associated with a partial decrease in colony formation (Fig. 7C). However, in concert with the propidium iodide staining data, survival of ZR-75-1/MUC1siRNA cells was substantially decreased by H2O2 exposure (Fig. 7C). These findings indicate that MUC1 protects ZR-75-1 cells from oxidative stress-induced loss of survival. MUC1-CD Activates FOXO3a—MUC1 is aberrantly overexpressed by carcinomas of the breast, prostate, lung, pancreas, and other epithelia (1Kufe D. Inghirami G. Abe M. Hayes D. Justi-Wheeler H. Schlom J. Hybridoma. 1984; 3: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In association with loss of polarity, MUC1, which is normally found on apical borders, is expressed at high levels over the entire surface of carcinoma cells. MUC1 C-ter is also found in the nucleus and mitochondria of transformed cells (10Li Y. Yu W.-H. Ren J. Huang L. Kharbanda S. Loda M. Kufe D. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 765-775PubMed Google Scholar, 13Li Y. Chen W. Ren J. Yu W. Li Q. Yoshida K. Kufe D. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Li Y. Liu D.

Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Importantly, overexpression of full-length MUC1 is sufficient to confer transformation (14Li Y. Liu D. Chen D. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6107-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 26Huang L. Ren J. Chen D. Li Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Moreover, MUC1 confers resistance to genotoxic and oxidative stress (16Ren J. Agata N. Chen D. Li Y. Yu W.-H. Huang L. Raina D. Chen W. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 17Yin L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). MUC1-dependent activation of the oxidative stress response is mediated at least in part by up-regulation of anti-oxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) expression (17Yin L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The present results extend these observations by demonstrating that MUC1 regulates FOXO3a activation. FOXO3a protects cells from oxidative stress by increasing H2O2 scavenging and inducing DNA repair (25Tran H. Brunet A. Grenier J.M. Datta S.R. Fornace Jr., A.J. DiStefano P.S. Chiang L.W. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2002; 296: 530-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 28Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Moreover, forkhead-induced resistance to oxidative stress has been associated with prolongation of survival (18Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The demonstration that FOXO3a is also activated in HCT116/MUC1-CD cells indicates that the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail is sufficient for stimulation of this pathway. In concert with these results, we found that transcription of the pFHRE-Luc reporter is substantially increased in HCT116 cells expressing MUC1 or MUC1-CD. Moreover, as found for HCT116/MUC1 cells (17Yin L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), expression of MUC1-CD was associated with decreases in constitutive H2O2 levels. The HCT116/MUC1-CD cells also responded to H2O2 exposure with increases in intracellular oxidant levels that were attenuated as compared with those in HCT116/vector cells. In concert with these results and as found for HCT116/MUC1 cells (17Yin L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), MUC1-CD expression is associated with induction of the FOXO3a-responsive Sod2 gene (data not shown). Importantly, FOXO3a protects cells from oxidative damage by activating Sod2 transcription, and Sod2–/– cells do not exhibit FOXO-mediated protection (29Burgering B.M. Kops G.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 352-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). We also found that exposure of the HCT116 cells to H2O2 is associated with increases in FOXO3a levels. The increase in FOXO3a levels was MUC1-independent and may be related to stabilization of FOXO3a in the response to oxidative stress. Further studies will be needed to define the mechanisms responsible for regulating FOXO3a levels. Nonetheless, the present findings collectively indicate that MUC1 activates FOXO3a and that MUC1-CD is sufficient for this response. MUC1-CD Regulates PI3K → p-Akt Signaling—FOXO3a is inactivated by p-Akt-mediated phosphorylation and binding of p-FOXO3a to cytosolic 14-3-3 proteins (23Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M. Lin M. Jou P. Hu L. Anderson M. Arden K. Blenis J. Greenberg M. Cell. 1999; 17: 1959-1968Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that, like p-FOXO3a, levels of p-Akt are decreased in MUC1-positive HCT116 cells. We also found that p-Akt is down-regulated in HCT116/MUC1-CD cells, indicating that the cytoplasmic tail is sufficient to activate signals that control Akt phosphorylation. Recent studies have shown that MUC1 activates the p-Akt pathway in rat 3Y1 fibroblasts (30Raina D. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20607-20612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). MUC1 expression was also associated with increases in phospho-BAD and Bcl-xL, and thereby attenuation of stress-induced apoptosis (30Raina D. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20607-20612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These findings collectively indicate that MUC1 regulates the Akt pathway in different cell types and that the effects of MUC1 are dependent on cell context. Activation of Akt is mediated by PI3K-dependent formation of PI(3,4,5)P3 and phosphorylation of Akt by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (22Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Other work has shown that p66shc functions upstream of p-Akt → p-FOXO3a signaling in the response to oxidative stress (18Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In the present studies, the demonstration that LY294002 blocks constitutive and H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Akt and FOXO3a indicates that PI3K is responsible for activating the p-Akt → p-FOXO3a pathway in HCT116 cells. Assessment of PI3K activity in HCT116 cells expressing MUC1 showed no apparent difference from that in HCT116/vector cells (data not shown). Thus, MUC1 may down-regulate p-Akt levels in HCT116 cells by stimulating phosphatases that regulate Akt phosphorylation. Knocking Down Endogenous MUC1 Inactivates FOXO3a and Increases Oxidant Levels—Stable expression of MUC1 or MUC1-CD in HCT116 cells represents one approach to assessing the effects of MUC1 on the oxidative stress response. Knocking down MUC1 in carcinoma cells that endogenously overexpress this protein was also used to assess the role of MUC1 on FOX3a signaling. In concert with the results in HCT116 cells, knocking down MUC1 in ZR-75-1 cells was associated with increases in p-Akt and Akt levels. Thus, the effects of MUC1 on p-Akt in ZR-75-1 cells can be attributed, at least in part, to lower levels of Akt protein. In this regard, further studies are needed to determine whether MUC1 regulates Akt levels by transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms. Knocking down MUC1 also increased levels of p-FOXO3a and FOXO3a. These results, like those in HCT116 cells, are not attributable to clonal variation as similar findings were obtained in two separately isolated ZR-75-1/MUC1siRNA clones. Moreover, as found in HCT116 cells, constitutive and H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Akt and FOXO3a was attenuated by LY294002, supporting the involvement of PI3K as an upstream effector of p-Akt → p-FOXO3a signaling in ZR-75-1 cells. Knocking down MUC1 in ZR-75-1 cells was also associated with increases in constitutive H2O2 levels. In addition, more pronounced increases in intracellular oxidant levels following H2O2 exposure were observed in the MUC1-negative ZR-75-1 cells. In concert with these results, we also found that knocking down MUC1 is associated with decreases in catalase expression (data not shown). Notably, like Sod2, the catalase gene is responsive to FOXO3a-induced activation. Thus, down-regulating endogenous MUC1 in ZR-75-1 cells results in inactivation of FOXO3a, decreases in catalase levels, and increases in oxidant levels. The results obtained by knocking down endogenous MUC1 in ZR-75-1 cells are thus in agreement with the effects of stably expressing MUC1 or MUC1-CD in HCT116 cells. Overexpression of MUC1 by Human Carcinomas May Protect against Oxidative Stress-induced Cell Death—Full-length MUC1 attenuates H2O2-induced apoptosis of HCT116 cells (17Yin L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that MUC1 transduces stress-induced signals from the cell membrane that protect cells from oxidative damage and death. Indeed, the present work indicates that the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail, which localizes to the nucleus and mitochondria (10Li Y. Yu W.-H. Ren J. Huang L. Kharbanda S. Loda M. Kufe D. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 765-775PubMed Google Scholar, 13Li Y. Chen W. Ren J. Yu W. Li Q. Yoshida K. Kufe D. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Li Y. Liu D.

Positioning of MUC1 along the apical borders of the normal ductal epithelium could function in sensing oxidants in the external environment. In turn, targeting of MUC1-CD to the cytosol or nucleus may contribute to the activation of effectors such as FOXO3a that confer a survival response. Moreover, mitochondrial localization of MUC1 is associated with attenuation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (16Ren J. Agata N. Chen D. Li Y. Yu W.-H. Huang L. Raina D. Chen W. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Human carcinoma cells may have exploited this physiologic mechanism by overexpressing MUC1 to achieve a survival advantage under conditions of oxidative and other forms of stress. In this regard, overexpression of MUC1 has also been shown to confer resistance to genotoxic stress (16Ren J. Agata N. Chen D. Li Y. Yu W.-H. Huang L. Raina D. Chen W. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Importantly, knocking down endogenous MUC1 sensitizes cells to stress-induced apoptosis and necrosis. Thus, down-regulating MUC1 expression or function may represent a potential approach for sensitizing tumors to therapeutic agents, such as ionizing radiation, that increase ROS levels. However, it is presently not known whether the survival advantage attributable to MUC1 expression by carcinoma cells in vitro applies to primary and metastatic MUC1-positive carcinomas in man.

However, the molecular mechanisms regulating Kv channel function in smooth muscle remain unclear. We examined the hypothesis that the vasoactive peptide angiotensin II (Ang II) regulates arterial smooth muscle Kv channel function via calcineurin-dependent activation of the transcription factor NFAT. We found that sustained administration of Ang II decreased Kv currents (IKv) by reducing the expression of Kv2.1 K+ channel subunits. This effect of Ang II was independent of pressure but required Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that calcineurin and NFATc3 are obligatory components of the signaling cascade mediating reduced IKv by Ang II. We conclude that sustained Ang II exposure increases smooth muscle Ca2+, which leads to activation of calcineurin and NFATc3, culminating in decreased Kv2.1 expression and reduced IKv function. These results support the novel concept that NFATc3 controls the excitability of arterial smooth muscle by regulating Kv2.1 expression.

In addition to increasing contractility (1MacKenzie E.T. Strandgaard S. Graham D.I. Jones J.V. Harper A.M. Farrar J.K. Circ.

Lombardi D.M. Bosman F.T. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) and regulation of gene expression (3Suzuki E. Nishimatsu H. Satonaka H. Walsh K. Goto A. Omata M. Fujita T. Nagai R. Hirata Y. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Ang II contracts arterial smooth muscle by increasing intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). Two mechanisms may contribute to increased [Ca2+]i during Ang II stimulation. First, Ang II activates Ca2+ release from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores (4Alexander R.W. Brock T.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Rittenhouse S.E. Hypertension. 1985; 7: 447-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bochkov V. Tkachuk V. Buhler F. Resink T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1996; 222: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Second, Ang II decreases the activity of large conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) (7Bonev A.D. Jaggar J.H. Rubart M. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C2090-C2095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Kv channels (8Hayabuchi Y. Standen N.B. Davies N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2480-H2489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) through a mechanism that involves the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Decreases in outward BK and Kv currents depolarize arterial smooth muscle. Depolarization increases Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, which increases [Ca2+]i, thereby causing contraction. Accordingly, sustained in vivo administration of Ang II leads to hypertension (9Wiener J. Lombardi D.M. Su J.E. Schwartz S.M. J. Vasc. Res. 1996; 33: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A recent study (3Suzuki E. Nishimatsu H. Satonaka H. Walsh K. Goto A. Omata M. Fujita T. Nagai R. Hirata Y. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) suggested that Ang II may regulate gene expression in arterial smooth muscle by activating the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CaN). Although the precise mechanisms by which Ca2+ controls CaN activation are unclear, the prevailing view holds that sustained increases in global Ca2+ are necessary (10Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Upon activation, CaN dephosphorylates the ubiquitous transcription factor NFAT, which translocates to the nucleus and interacts with another transcription factor, GATA6 (11Aramburu J. Rao A. Klee C.B. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 237-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 12Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Formation of this heterodimer results in modification of gene expression. Four (NFATc1–c4) of the five known NFAT isoforms are regulated by CaN (12Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). Expression profiling indicates that NFATc3 predominates in cerebral vascular smooth muscle (14Gomez M.F. Stevenson A.S. Bonev A.D. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Nelson M.T. J. Biol.

Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar) or as a repressor of gene expression (17Chen J. Amasaki Y. Kamogawa Y. Nagoya M. Arai N. Arai K. Miyatake S. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3109-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the functional effects of CaN/NFAT signaling and the role it plays in changing arterial function during Ang II signaling are unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of Ang II and CaN/NFAT signaling on the function of K+ channels in cerebral arterial smooth muscle. We found that in vivo administration of Ang II reduced Kv channel function in cerebral arteries by reducing the expression of Kv2.1 K+ channel subunits. The effects of Ang II on Kv currents were independent of blood pressure. Most importantly, we observed that CaN/NFATc3 activity is necessary and sufficient for Ang II-dependent regulation of Kv currents in arterial smooth muscle. We conclude that activation of NFATc3 by prolonged Ang II signaling decreases Kv channel function by decreasing Kv2.1 K+ channel subunit expression. In Vivo Angiotensin II Administration and Blood Pressure Measurements—We implanted osmotic mini-pumps (Alza) delivering Ang II (250 ng/kg/day) subcutaneously into male Sprague-Dawley rats. Blood pressure measurements were taken using a tail-cuff plethysmograph from Narco Biosystems as described previously (9Wiener J. Lombardi D.M. Su J.E. Schwartz S.M. J. Vasc. Res. 1996; 33: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Animals were handled in strict accordance to the guidelines of the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Organ Culture and Isolation of Arterial Myocytes—Rats and mice (male wild type BALB/c and NFATc3 knock-out; ≈25 g) were euthanized with a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg; intraperitoneally). Cerebral artery segments were cultured as described before (18Kleppisch T. Winter B. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2462-H2468PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, basilar, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries were dissected and put into sterile, ice-cold buffer composed of the following (in mm): 137 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 4.17 NaHCO3, 0.42 Na2HPO4, 0.44 NaH2PO4, 5 glucose, 10 HEPES, supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (1% v/v), Eagle's minimum essential medium amino acid solution (2% v/v), and MEM vitamin solution (pH 7.4). Arteries were cleaned of connective tissue, cut into pieces (∼2 mm in length), and placed in sterile 35-mm Petri dishes containing 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 0.5% albumin (v/v) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (v/v). The arteries were stored for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator fed with a gas mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Smooth muscle cells were prepared from freshly dissected and cultured cerebral arteries as described previously (19Amberg G.C. Santana L.F. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Reversible Permeabilization—Cerebral arteries were reversibly permeabilized using a derivative of a protocol described previously (20Lesh R.E. Somlyo A.P. Owens G.K. Somlyo A.V. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, arteries were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C in the following solution (in mm): 120 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 5 Na2ATP, 20 TES (pH 6.8). Samples were then placed in this solution supplemented with the calcineurin auto-inhibitory peptide (CiP, 100 μm) and Mr 3000 Calcium Green™-dextran conjugate (100 μm; Molecular Probes) or Calcium Green™ alone (200 μm) for 60 min at 4 °C followed by a similar CiP/Calcium Green™-containing solution with elevated MgCl2 (10 mm) for 30 min at 4 °C. Permeabilization was reversed by placing the arteries for 30 min at 22 °C in a MOPS-buffered physiological solution containing the following (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 MgCl2, 5 glucose, 2 MOPS, pH 7.1. Ca2+ was then gradually increased in this solution from nominally Ca2+-free to 0.01, 0.1, and 1.8 mm over 45 min. Arteries were then cultured as described above for 48 h. Adenoviral Infection—The adenoviral construct encoding a constitutively active form of NFAT with an N-terminal EGFP tag (ΔNFAT/EGFP) (21Liu Y. Cseresnyes Z. Randall W.R. Schneider M.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Martin F. Schneider. Briefly, the ΔNFAT/EGFP mutant lacks the first 317 amino acids corresponding to the N-terminal regulatory domain of the protein but retains the Rel homology and transactivation domains. Adenoviral infection and short term culture (48 h) of cerebral arteries was performed as follows. Freshly dissected cerebral arteries were cleaned from connective tissue and placed into 35-mm Petri dishes 1 h prior to exposure to recombinant adenovirus. The culture medium was aspirated, and 1 ml of serum-free MEM containing adenovirus encoding either EGFP (control) or ΔNFAT/EGFP was added to each dish. Adenoviral vectors were added at a multiplicity of infection of 10–100. Following 1–2 h of culture, 1 ml of serum-free MEM was added; after 24 h serum-free culture medium was replaced with 2 ml of MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. We identified positively infected myocytes by fluorescence microscopy 48 h post-infection at the time of experimentation. Electrophysiology—Whole-cell Kv currents were measured using the conventional whole-cell patch clamp technique with the use of an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Cells were continuously superfused with a nominally Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution with the following constituents (in mm): 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 3 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Patch pipettes were filled with a solution composed of the following (in mm): 87 potassium aspartate, 20 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 MgATP, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. The free Ca2+ of this pipette was calculated to be less than 100 nm (determined using WinMAXC software; C. Patton, Stanford University, Pacific Grove, CA). All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). Electrophysiological signals were stored and analyzed by using pCLAMP 8.0 software. Western Blots—Cerebral arteries were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer for 30–60 s in phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The homogenate was cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (22Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. 10 μg of total protein was loaded on a 4–15% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gel and run with an appropriate molecular weight standard at 100 mV for 1 h. Fractionated protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Mini-trans Blot Cell (Bio-Rad) at 100 mV for 1 h at 4 °C. The blots were blocked in TBS/Tween (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at 25 °C. After blocking, blots were incubated with primary antibodies specific to Kv1.2 (Sigma), Kv1.5 (Sigma), and Kv2.1 (Sigma) and TBS/Tween with 1% nonfat milk at 4 °C overnight. Following incubation with the primary antibody, blots were washed three times with TBS/Tween for 10 min and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in TBS/Tween for 2 h. This was followed by incubation with SuperSignal West Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Kv channel protein was quantified by densitometry using an Alphaimager 2200 analysis system and software (Alpha Innotech Corp). Confocal Microscopy and [Ca2+]i Imaging—Confocal images were acquired using Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal system coupled to an inverted Nikon TE300 microscope equipped with a Nikon PlanApo (60×, NA = 1.4) oil-immersion lens. Images were acquired and analyzed with Lasersharp 4.0 (Bio-Rad) software. For [Ca2+]i imaging experiments, cells were loaded with the acetoxymethyl form of the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fluo-4 (5 μm) as described previously (19Amberg G.C. Santana L.F. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In these experiments, background-subtracted fluorescence signals were normalized by dividing the fluorescence (F) intensity at each time point by the resting fluorescence (Fo). Images were pseudo-colored (when appropriate) using Corel Photopaint 11. All imaging experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). Chemicals and Statistics—Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were from Sigma. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Two sample comparisons were made by using Student's t test. Multigroup comparisons were made by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison when appropriate. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. The asterisk is used in the figures to illustrate a significant difference between groups. n values represent number of cells (electrophysiology) or animals (Western analysis) studied. In Vivo Administration of Angiotensin II Decreases Kv Current in Arterial Smooth Muscle—To examine the effects of systemic Ang II on K+ channel function, we implanted subcutaneous osmotic minipumps delivering Ang II (250 ng/kg/day) to male Sprague-Dawley rats. We used systolic blood pressure to establish success of the infusion. Similar to others (9Wiener J. Lombardi D.M. Su J.E. Schwartz S.M. J. Vasc. Res. 1996; 33: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), 7 days after pump implantation, Ang II-infused animals were hypertensive (systolic pressure = 210 ± 10 mm Hg, n = 6) whereas control animals infused with saline (sham) remained normotensive (systolic pressure = 120 ± 10 mm Hg, n = 6). After confirmation of Ang II delivery, we examined K+ currents in cerebral arterial smooth muscle cells from control and Ang II-infused rats (Fig. 1). K+ currents (IK) were evoked in sham and Ang II myocytes by applying 1-s depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of -70 mV to voltages ranging from -60 to +70 mV. In cerebral arterial smooth muscle cells, IK values are primarily composed of voltage-activated (IKv) and large conductance, BK (IBK) currents (23Bolton T.B. Lang R.J. Takewaki T. Benham C.D. Experientia (Basel). 1985; 41: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To separate IKv from IBK, we recorded K+ currents before and after application of iberiotoxin (Ibtx; 100 nm), a specific blocker of BK channels. Fig. 1A shows two sets of representative IK traces recorded from myocytes isolated from sham-treated and Ang II-infused animals. We found that IK was smaller in Ang II cells than in cells from sham arteries (n = 10, p < 0.05). Application of Ibtx (100 nm) reduced the amplitude of K+ currents in sham and Ang II cells. However, the amplitude of the Ibtx-insensitive current, which we designated as the voltage-dependent K+ current (IKv), was smaller in Ang II cells than in sham cells (p < 0.05). In contrast, the Ibtx-sensitive K+ currents (i.e. IBK) were similar in Ang II and sham cells (p > 0.05). Fig. 1B shows the current-voltage relationships of IK, IKv, and IBK in these cells. Note that IK and IKv values were smaller in Ang II cells than in sham cells at most voltages examined. At +70 mV, the amplitude of IK was 35.2 ± 5.1 pA/pF (n = 10) and 15.2 ± 5.1 pA/pF (n = 10, p < 0.05) in sham and Ang II cells, respectively. At +70 mV, IKv was ≈60% smaller in Ang II (10.2 ± 5.1 pA/pF, n = 10) than in sham (25.2 ± 5.1 pA/pF, n = 10, p < 0.05) cells. Conversely, IBK was similar in Ang II and sham cells at all voltages (p < 0.05). These data show that in vivo administration of Ang II decreases IK because of a reduction in the amplitude of IKv but not IBK. In vascular smooth muscle, IKv is thought to be produced by Kv1.2, Kv1.5 (24Albarwani S. Nemetz L.T. Madden J.A. Tobin A.A. England S.K. Pratt P.F. Rusch N.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 551: 751-773Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25Xu C. Tang G. Lu Y. Wang R. Life Sci. 2000; 66: 2023-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and Kv2.1 (25Xu C. Tang G. Lu Y. Wang R. Life Sci. 2000; 66: 2023-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) K+ channel subunits. We used Western blot analysis to examine Kv1.2, Kv1.5, and Kv2.1 protein expression in sham-treated and Ang II arteries (Fig. 1C). In accordance with the ≈60% reduction of IKv observed with our electrophysiological measurements (e.g.Fig. 1, A and B), Western blot analysis revealed a 50 ± 10% reduction in Kv2.1 protein expression (Fig. 1B; n = 5, p < 0.05). Most interestingly, Ang II infusion did not change the amount of Kv1.2 and Kv1.5 protein (p > 0.05). These data suggest that the reduction of IKv observed following Ang II infusion resulted from decreased expression of Kv2.1 channel subunits. Angiotensin II-mediated Decrease of Arterial Smooth Muscle Kv Current Is Independent of Pressure—We investigated the signaling mechanism(s) by which increased systemic Ang II reduced IKv in arterial smooth muscle. First, we tested the hypothesis that the effect of Ang II on arterial smooth muscle IKv was independent of arterial pressure. We assayed the effects of sustained Ang II exposure on IKv by culturing cerebral arteries from normotensive rats for 48 h in the presence or absence of Ang II (100 nm). An important advantage of this approach is that, unlike cultured dissociated cells, myocytes isolated from intact arteries do not undergo significant phenotypic drift during short term (48 h) culture (18Kleppisch T. Winter B. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2462-H2468PubMed Google Scholar). Following 48 h of organ culture, we dissociated myocytes from these arteries and recorded K+ currents as described above. Similar to cells from Ang II-infused rats, IK was smaller in myocytes from arteries cultured with Ang II than in myocytes from control (culture medium only) arteries (Fig. 2, A and B). At +70 mV the amplitude of IK was 37.7 ± 3.8 pA/pF (n = 6) and 19.1 ± 3.6 (n = 7, p < 0.05) in control and Ang II cells, respectively. Consistent with this, at this potential IKv was ≈60% smaller in cultured Ang II (10.8 ± 1.6 pA/pF) than in control cells (28.4 ± 2.1 pA/pF; p < 0.05). As with Ang II infusion, culturing cerebral arteries in the presence of Ang II did not alter IBK (p < 0.05). We used Western blot analysis once again to examine whether a decrease in Kv1.2, Kv1.5, or Kv2.1 protein accompanied the observed reduction of IKvin vitro. Similar to arteries from Ang II-infused rats, we found that Kv2.1 protein levels were about 50% lower in arteries cultured with Ang II than in control (Fig. 2B; n = 10, p < 0.05). Kv1.2 and Kv1.5 protein levels were unchanged in Ang II-incubated arteries (p > 0.05). These data suggest that sustained Ang II signaling is sufficient to decrease IKv by a reduction in Kv2.1 protein expression. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the effect of Ang II on Kv2.1 and IKv are independent of changes in arterial pressure. Activation of Calcineurin Is Necessary for Angiotensin II-induced Reduction of Kv Current in Arterial Smooth Muscle— Ang II has been shown to stimulate the activity of the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase CaN in vascular smooth muscle cells (26Liang H. Venema V.J. Wang X. Ju H. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19846-19851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that activation of CaN underlies the actions of Ang II on IKv in arterial smooth muscle. K+ currents were measured from cells isolated from cerebral arteries cultured with the CaN inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA; 1 μm) in the presence or absence of Ang II (100 nm; see Fig. 3, A and D). CsA alone had no effect on IK, IKv, or IBK (n = 5, p > 0.05). However, we found that with CsA in the culture medium, Ang II no longer reduced IKv (n = 5, p > 0.05), suggesting that calcineurin plays a critical role in the control of IKv by Ang II. To confirm that the effect of CsA resulted from CaN inhibition, as opposed to pharmacological nonspecificity, we performed similar experiments, but with the highly specific CaN autoinhibitory peptide (CiP; 100 μm). CiP was introduced into arterial smooth muscle cells prior to culturing with Ang II (100 nm) using a reversible permeabilization technique. For identification of successful permeabilization, cells were loaded with an Mr 3000 Calcium Green™-dextran conjugate (200 μm for control) or co-loaded with Ca2+ Green-dextran and CiP (100 μm, each). Permeabilized cells were identified by their Ca2+ Green fluorescence (see Fig. 3B), and only positive cells were used for electrophysiological experiments. As with CsA, inhibition of CaN with CiP prevented the reduction of IKv following sustained Ang II exposure (Fig. 3, C and D, n = 6, p > 0.05). These results indicate that activation of a CaN-dependent pathway is necessary for Ang II-mediated reduction of IK. Consistent with this conclusion, CsA prevented the reduction in Kv2.1 (or Kv1.2 and Kv1.5) protein produced by Ang II (Fig. 3E; n = 5, p > 0.05). In addition, we found no difference between the levels of Kv2.1 protein expression arteries incubated in media alone or with CsA (p > 0.05; data not shown). Angiotensin II-mediated Reduction of Kv Current Requires Ca2+Influx through L-type Ca2+Channels—An increase in [Ca2+]i is a necessary step for Ang II-dependent activation of CaN (10Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Indeed, Ang II increases [Ca2+]i in portal vein smooth muscle by enhancing Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels (27Morel J.L. Macrez-Lepretre N. Mironneau J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated if the actions of Ang II on IKv described above require Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels. We first examined the effects of Ang II on [Ca2+]i in freshly dissociated cerebral arterial myocytes. Fig. 4A shows that Ang II (100 nm) evoked a small but sustained (n = 5, p < 0.05) increase in global [Ca2+]i as determined by confocal microscopy. However, in the presence of the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker diltiazem (10 μm), application of Ang II had no effect on [Ca2+]i (n = 5, p < 0.05). This suggests that Ang II increases [Ca2+]i in cerebral arterial smooth muscle in an L-type Ca2+ channel-dependent manner. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that Ca2+ influx through L-type channels is necessary for Ang II-dependent reduction of IKv (Fig. 4B). In these experiments, we measured IKv and IBK amplitudes in myocytes from arteries cultured for 48 h with Ang II (100 nm) in the presence or absence of diltiazem (10 μm). Fig. 4, B and C, shows that diltiazem abolished the decrease in IKv produced by 48 h of exposure to Ang II at all voltages examined (n = 5, p > 0.05). This indicates that Ca2+ influx via L-type Ca2+ channels is required, presumably in order to activate CaN, for Ang II down-regulation of IKv in arterial smooth muscle. Expression of Activated NFATc3 Is Sufficient in Reducing Kv Current in Arterial Smooth Muscle—Members of the NFAT family of transcription factors are among the best characterized substrates for CaN (11Aramburu J.

We investigated whether NFATc3, the primary isoform expressed in cerebral arteries (14Gomez M.F. Stevenson A.S. Bonev A.D. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Nelson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46847-46853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), underlies the actions of Ang II on IKv in arterial smooth muscle cells. We infected intact cerebral arteries with an adenovirus construct expressing a constitutively active, EGFP-tagged, NFATc3 mutant (ΔNFAT). Arteries exposed to an adenovirus expressing only the EGFP tag served as control. Infected myocytes were identified from noninfected myocytes by their EGFP fluorescence (see Fig. 5A). Consistent with a biologically active form of NFATc3, cells expressing the ΔNFAT mutant showed high levels of nuclear fluorescence (Fig. 5A). In contrast, myocytes expressing EGFP alone showed a diffuse, largely cytoplasmic, pattern of fluorescence. Expression of ΔNFAT reduced the amplitude of IK (Fig. 5, B and C; n = 5, p < 0.05) to the same extent as Ang II (p > 0.05). Furthermore, like Ang II, IKv (p < 0.05) but not IBK (p < 0.05) was smaller in ΔNFAT-expressing cells than in EGFP-positive control cells. These findings suggest that Ang II-mediated activation of NFATc3 may underlie the reduction of IK by selectively decreasing IKv in arterial smooth muscle cells. If Ang II and ΔNFAT are reducing IKv through a common pathway (i.e. Ang II is activating NFATc3), then the effects of Ang II and ΔNFAT should not be additive. Indeed, we found that incubation of arteries expressing ΔNFAT in the presence of Ang II (100 nm) did not decrease the amplitude of IKv than either manipulation alone (see Fig. 5, B and C). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that Ang II reduces IKv via activation of NFATc3. NFATc3 Is Necessary for Angiotensin II-mediated Reductions of Kv Current in Arterial Smooth Muscle—To provide direct support for our hypothesis that Ang II reduces IKv through activation of NFATc3, we cultured cerebral arteries from transgenic mice lacking functional NFATc3 expression (c3-KO) (28Ranger A.M.

Fig. 6A shows that control wild type and c3-KO myocytes produced robust IK, IKv, and IBK. Note that the density of these currents in wild type mice was similar to that observed in rat myocytes (p < 0.05). Furthermore, kinetic analysis showed that the rate of activation (at +40 mV, mouse τact = 20.0 ± 1.6 ms, n = 9 versus rat τact = 17.5 ± 2.3 ms, n = 16) and"

AGPs are an important class of plant proteoglycans implicated in plant growth and development. Separation of AG-peptides enabled us to identify eight of 12 AG-peptides from Arabidopsis thaliana predicted from genomic sequences. Of the remaining four, two have low abundance based on expressed sequence tag databases and the other two are only present in pollen (At3g20865) or flowers (At3g57690) and therefore would not be detected in our analysis. Characterization of AG-peptides was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry protein sequencing. These data provide (i) experimental evidence that AG-peptides are processed in vivo for the addition of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, (ii) cleavage site information for both the endoplasmic reticulum secretion signal and the GPI-anchor signal for eight of the 12 AG-peptides, and (iii) experimental evidence that the Gly-Pro motif is hydroxylated in vivo. Furthermore, we show that AtAGP16 is GPI-anchored despite its unusually long hydrophobic C-terminal GPI-signal sequence. Prior to this work, the GPI-anchor cleavage site for only two plant proteins, NaAGP1 from Nicotiana alata and PcAGP1 from Pyrus communis, had been determined experimentally. Characterization of the post-translational modifications of AG-peptides contributes toward obtaining the complete primary structure of this class of biologically important plant proteoglycans and provides a greater understanding of post-translational modifications of plant proteins.

They comprise a large gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana with almost 50 members, when the fasciclin-like AGPs (FLAs) are included (4Schultz C.J. Rumsewicz M.P. Johnson K.L. Jones B.J. Gaspar Y.M. Bacic A. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1448-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). FLAs are chimeric AGPs that contain putative cell adhesion domains in addition to AGP domains (5Johnson K.L. Jones B.J. Bacic A. Schultz C.J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 1911-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 6Johnson K.L. Jones B.J. Schultz C.J. Bacic A. Rose J. The Plant Cell Wall. Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, UK2003: 111-154Google Scholar). Twelve Arabidopsis AGPs belong to a subgroup known as AG-peptides. Their encoded proteins have the hallmarks of the “classical” AGPs, namely an N-terminal secretion signal, a central domain rich in Pro/Hyp, Ser, Thr, and Ala, and a C-terminal region that is predicted to direct the addition of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (7Du H. Clarke A.E. Bacic A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 411-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Schultz C.J. Gilson P. Oxley D. Youl J.J. Bacic A. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The distinguishing feature of the AG-peptides is that the central Pro-rich domain predicted to contain the entire mature protein backbone, is generally between 10 and 13 amino acid residues (9Schultz C.J. Johnson K. Currie G. Bacic A. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). One AG-peptide, AtAGP24, has a longer protein backbone of 17 amino acids residues (4Schultz C.J. Rumsewicz M.P. Johnson K.L. Jones B.J. Gaspar Y.M. Bacic A. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1448-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether the functionality for this class of proteoglycans resides in the glycan, the protein, the GPI-anchor, or some combination of these. One of the long-term goals of our research program is to define the complete primary structure of mature AGPs. AGPs contain large O-linked arabinogalactan (AG) polysaccharides attached to the numerous hydroxyproline (Hyp) residues found throughout the protein backbone (1Gaspar Y.M. Johnson K.L. McKenna J.A.

In some instances, short arabino-oligosaccharides chains (10Qi W. Fong C. Lamport D.T. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 848-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 11Goodrum L.J. Patel A. Leykam J.F.

Rose J. The Plant Cell Wall. Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, UK2003: 111-154Google Scholar, 13Kielizewski M.J. Shpak E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1386-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Modification of the Pro residues in the protein backbone is thought to occur co-translationally as the proteins are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (1Gaspar Y.M. Johnson K.L. McKenna J.A. Bacic A. Schultz C.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Recently a putative plant prolyl hydroxylase was shown to have hydroxylation activity in insects cells on both pro-collagen and plant-specific protein backbones (14Hieta R. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23965-23971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because our understanding of the substrate specificity of individual prolyl hydroxylases is limited, sequencing the protein/peptide backbones of AGPs would make a substantial contribution. Other common post-translational modifications in plants and animals, which are not commonly associated with AGPs, include N-linked glycosylation, myristoylation, phosphorylation, and methylation (15Wilkins M.R. Gasteiger E. Gooley A.A. Herbert B.R. Molloy M.P. Binz P.A. Ou K.L. Sanchez J.C. Bairoch A. Williams K.L. Hochstrasser D.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It is now clear that the broad class of glycan attached to Hyp residues in the protein backbone depends on whether Hyp residues are contiguous or non-contiguous (12Zhao Z.D. Tan L. Showalter A.M. Lamport D.T.A. Kieliszewski M.J. Plant J. 2002; 31: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The Hyp contiguity hypothesis (16Kieliszewski M.J. Lamport D.T. Plant J. 1994; 5: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) states that contiguous Hyp residues (e.g. Ser-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp), as typically found in extensions, are attachment sites for short arabino-oligosaccharides and that non-contiguous Hyp residues (e.g. Ser-Hyp-Ala-Hyp), as typically found in the AG-peptides, are the attachment sites for AG polysaccharides. Our understanding of the genes encoding the enzymes for the glycosylation of Hyp is limited although it is likely that many different glycosyltransferases (GTs) will be involved (6Johnson K.L. Jones B.J. Schultz C.J. Bacic A. Rose J. The Plant Cell Wall. Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, UK2003: 111-154Google Scholar, 17Wilson I.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the addition of AG polysaccharides to AGPs occurs one residue at a time, or whether a glycan core is added en bloc as is the case for N-linked glycans. The AG polysaccharide backbone is repetitive with β-(1 → 3)Galp residues (degree of polymerization of approximately seven) separated by a periodate-sensitive linkage, reviewed in Ref. 1Gaspar Y.M. Johnson K.L. McKenna J.A. Bacic A. Schultz C.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar. The repetitive nature of the AG polysaccharide backbone provides some support for the en bloc addition of the sugars (18Tan L. Qiu F. Lamport D. Kieliszewski M. J. Biol.

Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Most Arabidopsis AGPs are predicted to be, at least transiently, attached to the outer surface of the plasma membrane via a GPI anchor. A plasma membrane localization is consistent with the result of immunolocalization experiments, reviewed in Ref. 23Knox J.P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar. Experimental evidence for the GPI anchoring of only a few plant AGPs has been obtained, PcAGP1 from Pyrus communis (19Youl J.J. Bacic A. Oxley D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7921-7926Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For many other AGPs the predicted in vivo location is based on the presence of a putative signal for GPI-anchor addition based on genomic sequences (4Schultz C.J. Rumsewicz M.P. Johnson K.L.

Science. 2002; 296: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar) there is a need to improve the certainty around GPI-anchor prediction. Although the basic structure of the GPI-signal sequence is conserved among a diverse group of organisms, prediction programs developed for animal and protozoan proteins (30Eisenhaber B. Bork P. Eisenhaber F. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) work poorly for the AGPs. Progress for the prediction of plant proteins has recently been made by two groups (26Borner G.H. Sherrier D.J. Stevens T.J. Arkin I.T. Dupree P. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 31Eisenhaber B. Wildpaner M. Schultz C.J. Borner G.H.H. Dupree P. Eisenhaber F. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 1691-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). With a combination of simple in silico sequence analytic procedures, gene sequence refinement, and human expert judgment, Dupree and colleagues (26Borner G.H. Sherrier D.J. Stevens T.J. Arkin I.T. Dupree P. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) derived a list of 248 potentially GPI lipid-anchored proteins. With the improved genome annotation this approach predicts that there are ∼248 GPI-anchored proteins in Arabidopsis belonging to at least 15 different gene families (32Borner G.H.H. Lilley K.S. Stevens T.J. Dupree P. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The classical AGPs and AG-peptides comprise 12% of the total GPI-anchored proteins, and proteins containing AGP-like domains (AG glycomodules) as part of longer proteins, e.g. certain FLAs and lipid transfer proteins, make up a further 28% of predicted GPI-anchored proteins (32Borner G.H.H. Lilley K.S. Stevens T.J. Dupree P. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The big-Π Plant Predictor was developed by Eisenhaber and colleagues (31Eisenhaber B. Wildpaner M. Schultz C.J. Borner G.H.H. Dupree P. Eisenhaber F. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 1691-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and is available as an online predictor (mendel. imp.univie.ac.at/sat/gpi/plant_server.html). This predictor includes PcAGP1, NaAGP1, and selected AG-peptides among 219 plant proteins with experimentally verified or hypothetically anticipated GPI anchor modification. This has resulted in the prediction that 187 Arabidopsis proteins are GPI-anchored, and 165 of these are the same as predicted by Ref. 32Borner G.H.H. Lilley K.S. Stevens T.J. Dupree P. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar. The discrepancies between the two approaches highlights that the knowledge of the sequence features of the GPI-anchor signal is incomplete and that the big-Π Plant Predictor conservatively extrapolates the current knowledge on uncharacterized proteins. Another new web-based GPI-anchor predictor, “detection of GPI” was developed by D. Buloz and J. Kronegg of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (129.194.185.165/dgpi/DGPI_demo_en.html), however, it does not work well for plant proteins. Although the “detection of GPI” program suggests that both NaAGP1 and PcAGP1 are GPI-anchored, it does not accurately predict the cleavage site for these two AGPs. For example, the experimentally determined GPI cleavage site (ω) for PcAGP1 (GenBank™ accession number U14009) is between Ser120 and Gly121 (19Youl J.J. Bacic A. Oxley D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7921-7926Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), whereas the detection of GPI program (Oct 24, 2003) predicts cleavage between Gly106 and Ser107. The major limitation to accurate GPI-anchor prediction in plants is the lack of experimental verification of GPI anchoring, especially with regard to the determination of the cleavage site (ω) residue. Here, we describe the separation of a family of deglycosylated AG-peptides from the bulk of the AGPs. The small size of the deglycosylated AG-peptides, 10 to 17 residues, allowed them to be analyzed without protease digestion. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) protein sequencing we determined the precise cleavage site for both N- and C-terminal signals. We also established that all Pro residues can be hydroxylated to Hyp for the eight AG-peptides analyzed. No other post-translational modifications were detected. These data contribute toward our goal of determining the complete primary structure of this functionally important group of plant proteoglycans. Plant Material—Wild-type A. thaliana plants were used (Columbia-0 strain CS1092, Arabidopsis Biological Research Center, Columbus OH). For isolation of AGPs the plants were grown in liquid Gamborg's B-5 medium (Invitrogen), pH 5.0. Approximately 50 seeds were surface sterilized by washing once in 70% ethanol for 2 min, followed by 15 min in 5% sodium hypochlorite, 0.1% Triton-X 100, then 4 washes in ultrapure water and finally placed into 50 ml of media in a 250-ml flask. The flasks were placed on a rotating shaker (∼120 rpm) in the laboratory under continuous fluorescent lighting at ∼22 °C. The whole seedlings were harvested after 14 days and freeze dried. Five flasks gave ∼1 g dry weight of tissue after freeze drying. Purification of AG-peptides—AGPs were extracted from freeze dried, liquid culture-grown seedlings as previously described (9Schultz C.J. Johnson K. Currie G. Bacic A. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In brief, following homogenization in liquid nitrogen, detergent-soluble protein was extracted in a buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol), freeze dried, and resuspended in a small volume of 1% (w/v) NaCl. AGPs were selectively precipitated using β-glucosyl Yariv reagent (β-GlcY, Biosupplies, Parkville, Australia) and collected by centrifugation. After washing, the β-GlcY was dissociated from the AGPs using dimethyl sulfoxide and sodium dithionite and removed by desalting on a PD-10 column (Sephadex G-25, Amersham Biosciences). The β-GlcY-precipitated AGP sample was chemically deglycosylated without further chromatography as previous studies have shown that β-GlcY-precipitated AGPs contains no Coomassie Blue-stained proteins on SDS-PAGE (33Mau S.-L. Chen C.-G. Pu Z.-Y. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Bacic A. Clarke A.E. Plant J. 1995; 8: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Deglycosylation of AGPs by Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride—Chemical deglycosylation of AGPs was performed using anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF) for 3 h at room temperature, according to the method of Mort and Lamport (34Mort A. Lamport D. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 82: 289-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) as previously described (9Schultz C.J. Johnson K. Currie G. Bacic A. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The HF was removed under vacuum, then the sample was desalted on a PD-10 column (Sephadex G-25, Amersham Biosciences). The desalted deglycosylated AGP fractions were freeze dried prior to resuspending in 500 μl of ultrapure water. HPLC—Reversed-phase (RP)-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed with a C18 column (Vydac, 218TP52, 5 μm 2.1 × 250 mm) attached to a Hewlett-Packard 1090 Liquid Chromatograph with a diode array detector and analyzed using Chemstation software. AGPs were eluted and collected from the column equilibrated in solvent A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) with a linear gradient of solvent B (0.04% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% acetonitrile): 0 to 30% solvent B in 30 min, then 30 to 100% in 30 min at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Chromatography was monitored by absorption at 214 and 280 nm. A 250-μl aqueous aliquot of the deglycosylated AGP was mixed with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto the C18 column maintained at ambient temperature (21 °C) to give sample A. The remaining deglycosylated AGP sample (approximately 250 μl) was mixed with an equal volume of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto the same RP-HPLC column but the column temperature was increased to 28 °C in an attempt to improve the elution profile to give sample B. Sample B contained ∼80% as much material as compared with sample A based on the absorbance of the largest peak (160 mA for B7 compared with 200 mA for A7). Edman Degradation Protein Sequencing—N-terminal protein sequencing was performed by automated Edman degradation on a sequencer (Model LF 3400; Beckman Instruments) with on-line analysis on a Beckman System Gold HPLC. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF analysis was performed on a Voyager-DE STR MALDI mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems), equipped with a 337-nm N2 laser. Parent ion masses were measured in reflector/delayed extraction mode, with accelerating voltage of 20 kV, grid voltage of 65%, and a 150-ns delay. Positive polarity was used. 50 scans were averaged per sample, and spectra were subject to 2 point external calibration using the most appropriate standards. Initially, MALDI-TOF was performed with external standards to avoid interference and suppression that can occur with internal standards (35Gobom J. Mueller M. Egelhofer V. Theiss D. Lehrach H. Nordhoff E. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 3915-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For sample A, the external standards used were bradykinin, angiotensin I, and adrenocorticotropic hormone peptide-(18–39) with Mr = 1060.5692, 1296.6853, and 2465.1989, respectively. For sample B, the internal standards used were bradykinin, angiotensin I, and adrenocorticotropic hormone-(1–17) with Mr = 1060.5692, 1296.6853, and 2093.0867, respectively. For both internal and external standards, two-point calibrations were used. The matrix used was a 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid-saturated solution in 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Protein Sequencing by Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Most samples were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems QSTAR® XL system using a protana/new objective tip. MS/MS for most ions was performed with an ion source voltage of 1600 V, collision energy of 28 V, with Q1 in low resolution mode. For ions that were difficult to fragment (e.g. sodium and potassium adducts) the collision energy was increased to 40 V. Other samples were analyzed on an LCQ mass spectrometer (Thermo-Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Sample (5 μl) was injected onto a C18 column (Vydac, 300 μm internal diameter × 10 cm). The solvents used were 0.5% acetic acid, 5% acetonitrile (solvent A) and 0.5% acetic acid, 60% acetonitrile (solvent B). Peptides were eluted with a 60-min gradient into the LCQ mass spectrometer with a 4.6 kV source voltage. A cycle of one full-scan mass spectrum (300–2,000 m/z) followed by one data-dependent MS/MS spectrum with a collision energy of 35 V was employed. Sample A10 was run on an Applied Biosystems QSTAR® Pulsar I, using a protana nanospray tip in positive ion mode. MS/MS of ion m/z 616.8 was performed with an ion source voltage of 950 V, collision energy of 40 V, and with Q1 in low resolution mode. Calculating the Predicted Masses of AG-peptides—To calculate the expected mass of each AG-peptide the expected post-translational modifications were included. The “standard” modifications were based on the (i) removal of the N-terminal signal sequence as predicted by SignalP (36Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar), (ii) removal of the C-terminal signal for GPI-anchor addition (assuming the most likely cleavage site based on the animal consensus data (37Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)), (iii) addition of an ethanolamine (43.0422 Da) at the C terminus of the peptide (ethanolamine (et) is the only remnant of the GPI-anchor after deglycosylation), and (iv) hydroxylation of Pro residues to hydroxyproline (Hyp). The monoisotopic mass of unmodified AG-peptides (with N- and C-terminal signals removed) was calculated using MSProduct (prospector.ucsf.edu/ucsfhtml4.0/msprod.htm). Where the mature protein was predicted to have a Gln (Q) residue at the N terminus, the mass for pyroglutamate was used because N-terminal Gln residues on AGPs are frequently cyclized (9Schultz C.J. Johnson K. Currie G. Bacic A. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The masses of modifications such as hydroxylation and methylation were obtained from the FindMod page at the Expasy site (Supplemental Materials Table IV; Ref. 15Wilkins M.R. Gasteiger E. Gooley A.A.

Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003Google Scholar. Purification and Separation of AG-peptides—The large family of AG-peptides from Arabidopsis and the availability of a sequenced genome provide an opportunity for using MS to investigate the predicted post-translational modifications of a large number of proteins without the need for protease digestion of purified proteins and recovery of digestion products. The predicted modifications of AG-peptides include cleavage of ER and GPI-anchor signal sequences, hydroxylation of Pro, and subsequent glycosylation of Hyp residues. To test this idea, total AGPs were isolated from Arabidopsis seedlings and purified by β-GlcY precipitation. The AGP sample was deglycosylated using HF and the deglycosylated AGPs were separated on a C18 column using RP-HPLC (Fig. 1A). Half of the deglycosylated β-GlcY precipitated material (sample A) was used to produce the profiles shown in Fig. 1, A and B. The remaining material (sample B) was chromatographed at a"
https://openalex.org/W2028199453,"The μ opioid receptor (MOR) is expressed in the central nervous system and specific cell lines with varying expression levels perhaps playing important roles. One of the neuronal-specific transcription regulators, neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF), has been shown to repress the expression of neuron-specific genes in non-neuronal cells. However, we showed here that the neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE) of MOR functions as a critical regulator to repress the MOR gene expression in specific neuronal cells depending on NRSF expression level. Using co-transfection studies, we showed that the NRSE of the MOR promoter is functional in NRSF-positive cells (NS20Y and HeLa) but not in NRSF-negative cells (PC12). NRSF binds to the NRSE of the MOR gene in a sequence-specific manner confirmed by supershift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, respectively. The suppression of NRSF activity with either trichostatin A or a dominant-negative NRSF induced MOR promoter activity and transcription of the MOR gene. When the NRSF was disrupted in NS20Y and HeLa cells using small interfering RNA, the transcription of the endogenous target MOR gene increased significantly. This provides direct evidence the role of NRSF in the cells and also indicates that NRSF expression is regulated by post-translational modification in neuronal NMB cells. Our data suggested that NRSF can function as a repressor of MOR transcription in specific cells, via a mechanism dependent on the MOR NRSE.

Three major types of opioid receptors, μ, δ, and κ, have been cloned and shown to belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily (1Kieffer B.L. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The activation of opioid receptors results in analgesia, sedation, euphoria, respiratory depression, and other functions. Subsequently, chronic administration of an agonist promotes tolerance and the development of physical dependence (1Kieffer B.L. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 2Loh H.H. Smith A.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 123-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 3Olson G.A. Olson R.D. Kastin A.J. Peptides. 1997; 18: 1651-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Based largely on pharmacological and clinical observations, the μ opioid receptor (MOR) 1The abbreviations used are: MOR, μ opioid receptor; NRSE, neuron-restrictive silencer element factor; NRSF, neuron-restrictive silencer factor; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; TSA, trichoatatin A; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SOX, Sry-like HMG box; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HDAC, histone deacetylase.1The abbreviations used are: MOR, μ opioid receptor; NRSE, neuron-restrictive silencer element factor; NRSF, neuron-restrictive silencer factor; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; TSA, trichoatatin A; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SOX, Sry-like HMG box; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HDAC, histone deacetylase. has traditionally been considered the main site of interaction of the major clinically used analgesics, particularly morphine (4Wood P.L. Peptides. 1988; 9: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). MOR is mainly expressed in the central nervous system with receptors varying in densities in different regions and perhaps playing different roles (5Delfs J.M. Yu L. Ellison G.D. Reisine T. Chesselet M.F. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 777-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Hyman S.E. Science. 1996; 273: 611-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Maldonado R. Saiardi A.

Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 22-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Thus, the pharmacological properties of analgesic drugs such as morphine will depend on how MOR expression is regulated in the central nervous system. Hence the structure and the transcriptional control regions within the MOR gene that result in this tightly controlled expression could determine the tissue-specific responses to these drugs. The mouse MOR gene spans over 100 kb and consists of multiple exons (9Min B.H. Augustin L.B. Felsheim R.F. Fuchs J.A. Loh H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9081-9085Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10Pan Y.X. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 295: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Several isoforms have been found (9Min B.H.

A. 2001; 98: 14084-14089Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and among them MOR-1 is the major form that is encoded by exons 1, 2, 3, and 4 (9Min B.H. Augustin L.B. Felsheim R.F. Fuchs J.A. Loh H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9081-9085Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The temporal and spatial expressions of the MOR gene, as well as the presence of MOR isoforms, suggest that the control of the transcriptional regulation plays an important role in MOR gene expression. The presence of both distal and proximal promoter regions in the MOR gene has been reported previously (12Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The proximal promoter of the mouse MOR gene is known to be regulated via various cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors, all of which are important for the proximal promoter activity (12Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Ko J.L. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 788-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Ko J.L. Liu H.C. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27678-27685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, MOR can be detected during the ontogenesis of the mammalian central nervous system, indicating its active participation in neural development. Thus μ opioid binding sites are present in the developing rat brain by the 14th day of gestation, whereas mRNA can be detected as early as E11.5 with in situ hybridization. These observations suggest that the MOR is actively involved in the developing mammalian nervous system. We are interested in determining how these expression profiles are established (i.e. what determines the receptor repertoire of specific neurons or cell lines?). There is very little known about the gene structure and the transcriptional control regions that result in this tightly controlled expression. The objective of the present study was to characterize the mechanisms of the cell-specific expression of the MOR gene. The presence of MOR transcripts in specific neuronal cells was correlated with the absence in these cell types of a transcription factor named NRSF (neuron-restrictive silencer factor). A 21-bp DNA element named NRSE for neural-restrictive suppressor element, regulates expression of neural specific genes through the binding of NRSF (15Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 16Huang Y. Myers S.J. Dingledine R. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The repression effected by NRSF required the interaction of NRSF with the histone deacetylase (HDAC), which induces hypoacetylation of histone (16Huang Y. Myers S.J. Dingledine R. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). This transcription factor has been proposed to play an important role in establishing and maintaining expression of neuron-specific genes. Recently studies have shown that NRSEs were found in some non-neuronal genes (17Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), suggesting that NRSF may regulate neuronal as well as non-neuronal genes. Although the regulation of neuronal genes has been widely studied, little information is available on the biological role that the interaction of NRSE-NRSF has in genes inside and outside the nervous system as well as the regulation of NRSF expression in neuronal cells. Previous study (18Kojima T. Murai K. Naruse Y. Takahashi N. Mori N. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 90: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) has shown that the activity of the NRSF promoter functioned equally in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. This result indicated that the post-translational modification of NRSF is important to regulate its target gene. Here we identified a conserved NRSE sequence in the promoter of mouse MOR gene, and we demonstrated that NRSF specifically bound to this mouse NRSE. Finally, we showed that the transcriptional repressor NRSF controlled MOR gene expression in specific neuronal cells. Plasmid Constructs—Constructs encoding a luciferase gene driven by the proximal promoter of the mouse MOR gene (pNRSE) or proximal promoter with mutated NRSE (pNRSEm) were generated by PCR using genomic DNA from mouse NS20Y cells as the template, and an upstream sense oligonucleotide (5′-CTCTTCCCGAGCTCTCTGCAGCATCC-3′), which incorporates a SacI site at the 5′-end and a downstream antisense oligonucleotide (for pNRSE, 5′-GCTGCTGTCCATGGTTCTGAA-3′ and for pNRSEm, 5′-CTGACAGAAATGACCTCAAATGCTTGCTG-3′) that were generated blunt-ended at the 3′-end, was used to amplify the relevant fragments from –452 to +12 (designated +1atthe translation start codon) of the mouse MOR gene. The amplified products were then cloned into the SacI/SmaI sites of a luciferase reporter pGL3 basic vector. Plasmids encoding NRSF (REEX1) and a dominant-negative form of NRSF (p73), designated here as DN-NRSF, were kindly provided by G. Mandel (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Reporter Gene Assay—Human neuroblastoma NMB cells were cultured as described previously (19Hwang C.K. Wu X. Wang G. Kim C.S. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3742-3750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). NS20Y and HeLa cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. PC12 cells were cultured in 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with 10% donor horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated in 6-well dishes at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/well and cultured overnight before transfection. Various plasmids at concentrations indicated in each figure were used with the Effectene Transfection reagent (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, for luciferase reporter analysis of each promoter construct, 1 μg of the reporter plasmid was mixed with the Effectene transfection reagent for 10 min before being added to various cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells grown to confluence were washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer (Promega). To correct for differences in transfection efficiency, a one-fifth molar ratio of a pCH110 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) containing the β-galactosidase gene under the SV40 promoter was included in each transfection for normalization. The luciferase and galactosidase activities of each lysate were determined as described by the manufacturers (Promega and Tropix, respectively). For trichostatin A (TSA, Sigma) treatment, the pNRSE plasmid was transiently transfected into NMB cells, and 24 h after the transfection, the cells were treated with indicated amounts of TSA. Luciferase activities were analyzed after a 24-h treatment. Supershift Assay—Nuclear extracts from NS20Y cells were prepared using a modification of procedures of Dignam et al. (20Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar) and Hennighausen et al. (21Hennighausen L. Lubon H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 721-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a copy of the MOR NRSE (5′-CAGCAAGCATTCAGAACCATGGACAGCAGCGCCGGCCCAGGGA-3′) were synthesized and end-labeled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of [γ-32P]dATP. Free nucleotides were separated by centrifugation through a G-50 column (Roche Applied Science). DNA-protein binding reactions were carried out in a 20-μl final volume of reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 250 μg of poly(dI-dC)/ml. The nuclear extract (10 μg of protein) was added to the reaction buffer in the absence or presence of unlabeled cold competitor and nonspecific oligonucleotide. For the supershift assay, antibodies or preimmune serum were pre-incubated for 30 min on ice before adding the labeled probe. A radiolabeled probe was then added, and the mixture was incubated for a further 20 min on ice. Electrophoresis to resolve DNA-protein complexes was performed in 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 150 V for 2–3 h. The monoclonal antibody against NRSF was obtained from Dr. D. J. Anderson. Anti-interferon regulatory factor 4 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—NS20Y cells were used for ChIP assays. ChIPs were performed using a modified protocol from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Cells in a 10-cm dish (70% confluent) were treated for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C. The cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 8.1, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100), and the nuclei were resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). The lysate was sonicated under conditions yielding fragments ranging from 200 to 1,000 bp. One-tenth of the diluted lysate was used for input, and the residual lysate was subjected to the following immunoprecipitation. Samples were subsequently precleared at 4 °C with recombinant protein A-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology) coated with salmon sperm DNA. Precleared lysate (100 μl) diluted in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl) was used for overnight immunoprecipitation with 10 and 5 μg of NRSF antibody at 4 °C. Complexes were collected for 4 h by using recombinant protein A-agarose beads coated with salmon-sperm DNA. After washing and elution, formaldehyde cross-linking was reversed with a 6-h incubation at 65 °C. Following the reverse cross-linking step, DNA was precipitated following a phenol/chloroform extraction and dissolved in 30 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). PCR reaction mixtures contained 4 μl of the immunoprecipitated chromatin sample with the following primers spanning the mouse MOR promoter region, in 50 μl of total volume. The mouse MOR primers, NSCF and NSCR, produce a 188-bp PCR product, NSCF forward, 5′-CTGTGAGAGGAAGAGGCTG-3′ and NSCR reverse, 5′-AAGTTGAGCCAGGAGCCAGGT-3′. After 35 cycles of amplification, 10 μl of the PCR product was analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. Total RNA Preparation and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated according to the supplier's protocol (TRI Reagent, Molecular Research Center, Inc.). For reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), 5 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with superscript II reverse transcriptase using random hexamers as primers. PCRs were carried out with one-tenth of the volume of the reverse-transcribed product in a final volume of 50 μl using TaqDNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and were performed in a GeneAmp 9600 PCR machine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCR cycle conditions for NRSF consisted of 95 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s followed by a 10-min extension at 72 °C (35 cycles) and for MOR consisted of 95 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, followed by a 10-min extension at 72 °C (40 cycles). PCR products were separated in a 1.5% agarose gel with Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Primer sets used for human and mouse NRSF mRNA (22Palm K. Metsis M. Timmusk T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and human and mouse MOR are as follows. For human NRSF, the primers were hNRSFF (5′-GAATCTGAAGAACAGTTTGTGCAT-3′) and hNRSFR (5′-ACAGCAGATAGTAGCAACTTCAAA-3′). For mouse NRSF, the primers were mNRSFF (5′-GAATCTGAAGAGCAGTTTGTGCAT-3′) and mNRSFR (5′-ATGCACAAACTGCTCTTCAGATTC-3′). The human MOR transcript was amplified with primer set P2Ss (5′-CTCCGTGTACTTCTAAGGTGGGAG-3′) and TM2as (5′-GGCTAAGGCATCTGCCAGAGCAAG-3′). Similar reactions were carried out using primers for β-actin (23Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J.

The resulting PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. The DNA sequences of PCR products were confirmed by automated sequencing. Quantitative analyses were done using ImageQuant 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences) software. Small Interfering RNA-based (siRNA) Experiments—A small interfering RNA-based (siRNA) strategy (24Donze O. Picard D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e46Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) was employed to silence the endogenous mouse and human NRSF in NS20Y and HeLa cells involved in MOR gene regulation. NRSF and scrambled siRNAs were generated using the procedure of Donze and Picard (24Donze O. Picard D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e46Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and T7 RiboMAX Express RNAi system (Promega). Briefly, the siRNA sequences for NRSF and primers were chosen using the website-based tool, siRNA Target Designer from Promega. The primers for mouse NRSF are NRSF si-SS, 5′-AAGCACTGTTGTTGAAGAGACTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAGGATCC-3′, and NRSF si-AS, 5′-AAGTCTCTTCAACAACAGTGCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAGGATCC-3′. The primers for human NRSF are hNRSF si-SS, 5′-AAGATGCACAAACTGTTCTTCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAGGATCC-3′, and hNRSF si-AS, 5′-AAGAAGAACAGTTTGTGCATCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAGGATCC-3′. The target sequences for the NRSF gene are underlined, and the remaining 3′-regions of each primer are the corresponding T7 promoter sequences. The T7 si primer, 5′-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′ was synthesized, and scrambled primers (sense and antisense) as negative siRNA control were also synthesized. The oligonucleotide-directed production of small RNA transcripts with T7 RNA polymerase, described previously (24Donze O. Picard D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e46Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 25Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar), was carried out using the T7 RiboMAX Express RNAi system. Sense and antisense 21-nucleotide RNAs generated in separate reactions were annealed by mixing both transcription reactions and incubating at 70 °C for 10 min followed by 20 min at room temperature to obtain small interfering double-stranded RNA synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase. The mixture was then purified by isopropanol precipitation, washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in the appropriate amount of nuclease-free water. The concentration of siRNAs used was 1–3 μg in each transfection for NS20Y and HeLa cells using RNAiFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Forty-eight hours after the transfection, total RNA was prepared using TRI Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions and used to perform RT-PCR analysis. Quantitative analyses were done using ImageQuant 5.2 software. Identification of the Mouse MOR Promoter Region—As shown in Fig. 1A, the 21-bp NRSE identified in human (from nucleotides –12 to +9) is highly homologous to mouse and rat MOR sequences and to the consensus NRSE sequence. Previous studies have shown that 22 more genes (17Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), 17 of which are expressed mainly in neurons, were found to contain NRSE-like sequences, and the results of gel-shift assays indicated that at least 7 bases (Fig. 1A, lowercase letters) of the residues of the NRSE are not critical for NRSF binding activity. The 14 bases of the core sequence (Fig. 1A, capital letters) are likely to include residues that are relatively more important for function (17Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The NRSE of mouse, rat, and human MOR have only one residue mismatched compared with functional known NRSE consensus sequences (Fig. 1A). Mori et al. (26Mori N. Schoenherr C. Vandenbergh D.J. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mutating two adjacent G residues (Fig. 1A, underlined in core region) to T residues drastically reduced both NRSF binding and silencing. The MOR NRSE in all three species also has these two adjacent G residues, warranting further studies to investigate a possible role of NRSE/NRSF in MOR gene regulation. Expression of NRSF and MOR in Different Cell Lines—Neuronal NMB (MOR-positive) and NS20Y (MOR-negative) cell lines, and non-neuronal cervical carcinoma HeLa (MOR-negative) were used as models to study the mechanism controlling the cell-specific expression of the MOR gene. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to RT-PCR analysis to detect the expression of the NRSF and MOR transcripts from those cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, MOR transcripts were detected in NMB cells but not in NS20Y and HeLa cell lines. All these cells express a high level of the NRSF mRNA in the order of HeLa > NS20Y > NMB cells. By contrast, the NRSF protein expression level was low in the MOR-positive NMB cells and was high in MOR-negative NS20Y and HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). Because NRSF may act in a concentration-dependent manner (15Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 27Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar), the low level of NRSF in NMB cells may be insufficient for silencing activity. Functional Analysis of the 5′-Flanking Region of the Mouse MOR Promoter—Studies in our laboratory show that expression of MOR is driven by two promoters, distal and proximal (12Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Both promoters exhibit characteristics of housekeeping genes lacking a TATA box, and the distal promoter is known to be 20-fold less active the proximal promoter based on quantitative RT-PCR using adult mouse brain mRNA (12Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The proximal promoter region of the MOR gene, which spans ∼200 bp in length (from –450 to –249 bp, the translation start site is designated as +1) has proximal promoter activity to regulate MOR transcription (29Seth K.A. Majzoub J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13917-13923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of the NRSE DNA element on the proximal promoter activity (comprising –450 to +12 bp) of the mouse MOR gene was examined in MOR-positive (NMB) and MOR-negative (NS20Y and HeLa) cell lines (Fig. 2). The MOR promoter/reporter plasmids, pNRSE containing the native NRSE sequence (5′-GCTGCTGTCCATGGTTCTGAA-3′), pNRSEm (5′-CTGACAGAAATGACCTCAAATGCTTGCTG-3′), and pNRSEnon (deleted the NRSE), were each constructed with the 5′-flanking region (from –450 to –9) of the mouse MOR gene linked to a luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). The activity of the reporter in tested cell lines was negatively regulated when the NRSE DNA element was present in the MOR promoter construct, pNRSE (Fig. 2A). The promoter activity of pNRSE construct in NMB cell lines was ∼5-fold lower than that of the pNRSEm and pNRSEnon constructs. This promoter activity of the pNRSE construct in NMB cells was relatively higher than the activities of the pNRSE construct in NS20Y and HeLa cell lines. This might be a result of the low level of NRSF expression in NMB cell lines compared with its level in the other two cell lines. In addition, we used a heterologous promoter to examine the role of MOR NRSE (Fig. 2B). The NRSE DNA element of MOR and a mutated NRSE (the mutated site is the same as in pNRSEm) were each inserted into SacI/XhoI sites (upstream of the SV40 promoter) of pGL3-promoter vector, generating pSVNRSE and pSVNRSEm, respectively. The promoter activity of the pSVNRSE construct in NMB, NS20Y, and HeLa cell lines was attenuated by ∼38, ∼50, and ∼60%, respectively, compared with the activity of the pGL3-promoter. When the mutated NRSE construct (pSVNRSEm) was transfected into the same cells, the promoter activities were not significantly changed. All these data suggest that the NRSE of the MOR promoter functions as a negative cis-acting element in all tested cells for the homologous MOR promoter as well as for the heterologous SV40 promoter. Dominant-negative NRSF (DN-NRSF) Reversed NRSF-mediated Suppression of MOR Promoter Activity in Several Cell Lines—To evaluate whether the suppression of MOR NRSE promoter activity is reversed by a DN-NRSF, we cotransfected a DN-NRSF expression plasmid with either reporter construct pNRSE or pNRSEm. DN-NRSF encodes only the DNA-binding domain of NRSF without the two repressor domains of the protein (10Pan Y.X. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 295: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, when the pNRSE construct was transfected into NMB, NS20Y, and HeLa cells in the presence or absence of DN-NRSF, all the MOR promoter activity was derepressed. This effect was absent when the mutated NRSE construct (pNRSEm) was cotransfected into these three cell lines. Because the DNA-binding domain of DN-NRSF was enough to compete with the endogenous NRSF for the NRSE binding sequence (15Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), these data indicated that the repression of pNRSE promoter activity in these cells was mediated by NRSF binding to the MOR NRSE, resulting in antagonizing the transcriptional effects of the wild type NRSF protein. These results were further confirmed with the following experiments as shown in Fig. 4. We transfected NMB cells with either the DN-NRSF expression plasmid or the control vector for the analysis of endogenous MOR transcripts in NMB cells. Transfection of DN-NRSF resulted in markedly increased MOR transcript levels, compared with mock and vector control cells (Fig. 4). These results suggested that the repression of MOR transcription is mediated by NRSF binding to the NRSE of the MOR promoter in neuronal NMB cell lines.Fig. 4Expression of DN-NRSF derepressed the endogenous MOR transcription in NMB cells. A, NMB cells were transfected with DN-NRSF and vector for 48 h, and RNA was harvested, digested with DNase, and reverse-transcribed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” cDNA was amplified using PCR and primer pairs specific for the MOR and β-actin. Lane 1, 100-bp marker; lane 2, mock; lane 3, transfected with DN-NRSF expression vector; lanes 5, 6, and 7, omitted reverse transcriptase as a control. Negative and positive controls were performed the same as in the legend to Fig. 1. B, quantitative data for lanes 2–4 of A were analyzed by using ImageQuant 5.2 software after β-"
https://openalex.org/W2048555187,"Myoblast fusion is a critical process for the terminal differentiation of skeletal muscle. To elucidate the intracellular mechanisms regulating myoblast fusion, we studied the roles of signaling through the small GTPase Rho and its effector, the Rho-associated kinase ROCK, in myoblast fusion of mouse C2C12 cells. We found that Rho activity, which was high in proliferating myoblasts, decreased during myogenesis. Expression of a constitutively active form of Rho blocked myoblast fusion, but not the earlier steps of differentiation. Consistently, ROCK activity was also decreased in differentiating C2C12 cells, and an active ROCK mutant prevented their fusion. Furthermore, inactivation of ROCK by the specific inhibitor Y-27632 enhanced myoblast fusion, even in cells expressing the active Rho mutant. Thus, the down-regulation of Rho/ROCK signaling is required for myoblast fusion. We also found that Rho/ROCK signaling was required for retaining FKHR, a transcription factor implicated in myoblast fusion, in the cytoplasm and that inactivation of ROCK was essential for the nuclear accumulation of FKHR that took place just before the onset of myoblast fusion. Moreover, ROCK directly phosphorylated FKHR in vitro. We conclude that the inactivation of Rho/ROCK signaling is a prerequisite for FKHR nuclear translocation and myoblast fusion in C2C12 cells, providing evidence for a novel regulatory role of Rho/ROCK signaling in myogenic differentiation.

In the development of skeletal muscle, mononuclear myoblasts are differentiated from multipotent mesodermal precursor cells in an ordered multistep process requiring the sequential activation of myogenic transcription factors followed by myoblast fusion. In the myoblast, the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix factor MyoD, the earliest marker of muscle differentiation, initiates the myogenic program by activating the expression of various muscle-specific genes. In a later stage of myogenic differentiation when these genes are sufficiently expressed, myoblast fusion is started and is followed by up-regulation of myosin heavy chain (MHC) 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, myosin heavy chain; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PH, pleckstrin homology; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S- transferase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase.1The abbreviations used are: MHC, myosin heavy chain; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PH, pleckstrin homology; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S- transferase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase. expression in multinucleated myotubes and muscle fiber formation. In a series of these events, myoblast fusion is the critical step triggering terminal differentiation. In vertebrates, cell-surface molecules such as cadherins, the Ig superfamily members neural cell adhesion molecule and vascular cell adhesion molecule, the tetraspanins CD9 and CD81, and ADAM (adisintegrin and metalloproteinase) proteins, as well as extracellular matrix receptors, have been implicated in the regulation of myoblast fusion (1Dickson G.

J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2973-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it was also reported that β1 integrins regulate myoblast fusion and sarcomere assembly in vivo (11Schwander M. Leu M. Stumm M. Dorchies O.M. Ruegg U.T. Schittny J. Muller U. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 673-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In contrast to these cell-surface molecules, however, little is known about the intracellular molecules that regulate myoblast fusion. Recently, the a transcription factor FKHR (Forkhead in human rhabdomyosarcoma) was reported to be required for myoblast fusion in primary myoblasts (12Bois P.R. Grosveld G.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). FKHR was suggested to up-regulate the expression of the genes involved in cell fusion (prosaposin, frizzled-4, and slow myosin heavy chain) or extracellular matrix remodeling (procollagen types V and XVIII, fibulin-2, tenascin-C, and ankyrin-3) (12Bois P.R. Grosveld G.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of FKHR disturbs myoblast fusion, but not myogenic gene expression such as that of myoD or myogenin (12Bois P.R. Grosveld G.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In cell lines such as 293, FKHR activity is negatively regulated by phosphorylation, and the phosphorylated form is exported from the nucleus in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway-dependent manner (13Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 14Biggs III, W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K.

Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5367) Google Scholar). In contrast, in primary myoblasts, FKHR intracellular localization is regulated in a manner dependent on an unknown Ser/Thr kinase but independent of the PI3K/Akt pathway (12Bois P.R. Grosveld G.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus, it has not been elucidated how FKHR localization is regulated in myogenic differentiation to trigger myoblast fusion.Rho GTPases are molecular switches that control a variety of cytoskeleton-dependent cell functions such as actin cytoskeleton organization, microtubule dynamics, membrane transport, cell polarity, and transcriptional activity (16Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). Rho also plays a critical role in skeletal muscle differentiation. Rho-dependent activation of serum response factor is required for myoD or α-actin gene expression, thereby promoting myogenin expression and subsequent differentiation in myoblast cell lines (17Carnac G. Primig M. Kitzmann M. Chafey P. Tuil D. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1891-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18Takano H. Komuro I. Oka T. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30287-30294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although Rho had been thought to be a positive regulator of myogenesis, several reports showed Rho to be a negative regulator (20Beqaj S. Jakkaraju S. Mattingly R.R. Pan D. Schuger L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Meriane M. Roux P. Primig M. Fort P. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2513-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For example, high RhoA activity maintains the undifferentiated mesenchymal cell morphology and prevents smooth muscle differentiation (20Beqaj S. Jakkaraju S. Mattingly R.R. Pan D. Schuger L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in rat L6 myoblasts transfected with an active RhoA mutant, no multinucleated myotubes are detected even under differentiation conditions (21Meriane M. Roux P. Primig M. Fort P. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2513-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, these reports imply the possibility that Rho contributes negatively to morphological differentiation; however, there is no direct evidence showing that Rho regulates myoblast fusion.To elucidate the intracellular mechanisms regulating myoblast fusion, we focused on the function of Rho in myoblast fusion. Among a number of its effectors enabling various functions of Rho (22Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar), we studied Rho-associated kinase ROCK/Rho kinase/ROK, which has been identified as a direct effector of RhoA (23Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 24Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N.

Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). The Ser/Thr kinase ROCK has been implicated in the regulation of assembly of the actin cytoskeleton and cell contractibility by phosphorylating various substrates (26Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study showed that Y-27632, a ROCK inhibitor, induces the precocious expression of cardiac α-actin in chick embryos, implying that ROCK negatively affects myogenic differentiation (27Wei L. Roberts W. Wang L. Yamada M. Zhang S. Zhao Z. Rivkees S.A. Schwartz R.J. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 2953-2962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, very little information regarding the function of ROCK in myogenesis has been obtained.In this study, we investigated the involvement of Rho/ROCK signaling in myoblast fusion in mouse C2C12 cells. We demonstrated that both Rho and ROCK activities were decreased during myogenesis. Constitutive activation of Rho or ROCK caused a defect in myoblast fusion but did not abrogate expression of MyoD and myogenin. This phenotype was coincident with cytoplasmic retention of the transcription factor FKHR. Furthermore, inhibition of ROCK highly enhanced myoblast fusion in association with nuclear accumulation of FKHR, which was a direct substrate of ROCK. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that down-regulation of Rho/ROCK signaling is an essential process for myoblast fusion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Insulin-like growth factor-1 was purchased from Sigma. Anti-MHC monoclonal antibody (MF20) was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA). Mouse anti-RhoA (26C4), anti-myogenin (F5D), and anti-Myc epitope tag (9E10) monoclonal antibodies; rabbit anti-MyoD, anti-myogenin, and anti-Myc epitope tag polyclonal antibodies; and goat anti-ROCK-I polyclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Y-27632, a ROCK inhibitor, and wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, were obtained from Calbiochem. Rabbit anti-FKHR polyclonal antibody came from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA).Plasmids—pEF-BOS-HA-RhoAV14 was provided by Dr. K. Kaibuchi (Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan), and pCAG-Myc-ROCK was provided by Dr. S. Narumiya (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). Constitutively active RhoAV14 was excised from pEF-BOS-HA-RhoAV14 by BglII digestion and ligated into the expression plasmid pCAGIpuro-Myc, yielding pCAGIpuro-Myc-RhoAV14. To obtain the constitutively active pCAG-Myc-ROCK-IΔC construct lacking the C terminus containing the Rho-binding domain and PH domain of ROCK-I, pCAG-Myc ROCK was digested with XhoI (28Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), inserted into an adaptor sequence including a stop codon, and then self-ligated.Cell Culture and Transfection—C2C12 mouse myoblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (growth medium). To induce differentiation, C2C12 cells were shifted to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum and 80 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor-1 (differentiation medium). The cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After 36 h of transfection, the cells were shifted from growth medium to differentiation medium and then incubated for an additional 144 h to allow full differentiation into multinucleated myotubes. To isolate RhoAV14-C2C12 stable transfectants, transfected cells were selected by incubation in the presence of 3 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma).Immunofluorescence and Calculation of Fusion Index—Immunofluorescence staining was conducted using antibodies against MyoD, myogenin, MHC, FKHR, and the Myc epitope tag, followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies, i.e. Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 25 °C, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 25 °C. After blocking with 5% skim milk in PBS, cells were treated with primary antibodies for 1 h at 25 °C, washed three times with PBS with shaking, and then incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at 25 °C. After three final washes with PBS, coverslips were applied, and the cells were observed. Expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) was visualized directly. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 applied with the secondary antibodies. Microscopy was performed with a Zeiss Axiophoto epifluorescence microscope, and captured images were processed and superimposed using the IPLab software package (Scanalytics, Billerica, MA). The fusion index was calculated using the following formula: (nuclei within MF20-stained myotubes/total number of nuclei) × 100.Preparation of Cell Lysates—C2C12 cells were washed with PBS and lysed with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm Na3VO4). Cell debris was then pelleted at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected as the whole cell lysate. To obtain cytosolic extracts, C2C12 cells were lysed with buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm Na3VO4 and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected for the cytosolic extract. The pellet was lysed with buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 25% glycerol, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm Na3VO4 and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as the nuclear extract.GTP-bound RhoA Pull-down Assay—Cells were washed once with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed in pull-down buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were saved as the cell lysates. After the protein concentration had been determined, 200 μg of protein from the cell lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as a negative control or with 20 μg of GST-rhotekin Rho-binding domain-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Chicago, IL) for 45 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with pull-down buffer, and GTP-bound RhoA was detected by immunoblotting with anti-RhoA antibody.Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay for ROCK—ROCK was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates by incubating equal amounts of precleared lysate proteins (100 μg) with anti-ROCK antibody (5 μg/tube) or normal goat IgG (5 μg/tube) as a negative control at 4 °C with constant shaking, and then the immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and three times with kinase buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol) and immediately used for the kinase assay. The beads were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 0.6 mg/ml histone H1 (Roche Applied Science) or 2 mg/ml GST-FKHR (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (200 mCi/ml) and 10 μm ATP in kinase buffer. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Histone H1 or GST-FKHR was separated by SDS-PAGE, and 32P incorporation was measured using a Fuji BAS2000 imaging analyzer and quantified by Cerenkov counting.RESULTSRho Activity Is Decreased during Myogenesis—Although a number of studies have evaluated the functions of Rho in myogenesis, the change in Rho activity during differentiation has not been clearly shown. To investigate Rho activity during myogenesis in vitro, we measured RhoA activity in mouse C2C12 myoblasts by employing a pull-down assay that captures only the active GTP-bound form of RhoA. The level of GTP-bound RhoA was high under proliferative conditions (0 h in Fig. 1, A, first panel; and B); however, it decreased rapidly within 2 h after the shift to differentiation medium (2 h in Fig. 1, A, first panel; and B), presumably because of serum withdrawal from the culture medium. RhoA activity was maintained at a moderate level for at least 2 days and declined slightly, reaching a background level by day 4 of differentiation. These observations indicated that Rho inactivation during myogenic differentiation occurred in a biphasic manner. In the first phase, at the beginning of differentiation, Rho activity was promptly decreased. Thereafter in the second phase, from days 2 to 4 of differentiation, residual Rho activity was completely lost. It is notable that the RhoA protein level was slightly decreased from days 2 to 4 of differentiation, with this decrease being concomitant with the second inactivation of Rho (Fig. 1A, third panel).Excessive Rho Activity Suppresses Myoblast Fusion and MHC Expression—Because Rho activity decreased during myogenesis, we hypothesized that down-regulation of Rho might be important for the progression of myogenesis. To examine whether such down-regulation is required for myogenic differentiation, we established active RhoA mutant (RhoAV14) stable transfectants of C2C12 cells, which exhibited high Rho activity even under the low serum conditions (Fig. 2A). Little or no multinucleated myotubes were detected in RhoAV14-C2C12 transfectants after 6 days in differentiation medium (Fig. 2B, panels b and d), whereas a number of MHC-expressing multinucleated myotubes were formed in the control C2C12 cultures (panels a and c). No multinucleated myotubes were observed even after the RhoAV14-C2C12 cells had been allowed to grow in differentiation medium for up to 1 month (data not shown), indicating that multinucleated myotube formation was completely blocked, not simply delayed. In cultures of RhoAV14 transfectants, although MHC (late marker)- and myogenin (intermediate marker)-expressing cells were detected, none of these cells underwent cell fusion (Fig. 2B, panel d). To evaluate which stage of differentiation was blocked by RhoAV14, we performed immunoblot analysis for detection of differentiation markers. As shown in Fig. 2C, expression of MHC was remarkably suppressed in RhoAV14 transfectants, whereas no noticeable effects on the expression of MyoD (early marker) or myogenin were observed. From our detailed observation of C2C12 cell differentiation in vitro, we found that MHC expression started in a certain population of mononuclear myoblasts and rapidly increased concomitant with the initiation of myoblast fusion. Taking this observation into consideration, the defect in MHC expression in RhoAV14 transfectants is clearly caused by failure of their fusion. We excluded the possibility that this failure of myogenesis was due to excessive apoptosis or cellular proliferation because their DNA content measured by flow cytometry did not indicate a significant difference between the two transfectants (data not shown). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that high Rho activity completely suppresses myoblast fusion and the subsequent activation of MHC expression without affecting cellular proliferation or survival.Fig. 2Active Rho mutant inhibits multinucleated myotube formation and MHC expression. A, C2C12 cells were stably transfected with a control vector or the constitutively active RhoA mutant Myc-RhoAV14 (RhoAV14-C2C12) and cultured in growth medium (20% fetal bovine serum (FBS)) or differentiation medium (1% fetal bovine serum) for 16 h. The levels of the GTP-bound form of Rho were measured (upper panel). RBD (Rho-binding domain) indicates a loading control of the GTP-bound RhoA pull-down assay (lower panel). cont, control. B, control (panels a and c) and RhoAV14-C2C12 (panels b and d) cells were cultured in differentiation medium for 6 days. The cells were then fixed and stained for MHC (green) and myogenin (red). Cells were co-stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue) to identify nuclei. Panels a and b show phase-contrast images, and panels c and d show fluorescence microscopic images. Note that myogenin and MHC were expressed in mononuclear cells in RhoAV14-C2C12 cultures (arrows in panel d). Magnifications are ×40 (panels a and b) and ×200 (panels c and d). C, cell lysates were prepared from control or Myc-RhoAV14-expressing C2C12 (RhoAV14-C2C12) cells at day 2 (MyoD) or day 6 (MHC and myogenin) of differentiation and immunoblotted with anti-MHC, anti-myogenin, anti-MyoD, or anti-Myc epitope tag (9E10, for Myc-RhoAV14) antibody. Amido Black staining is indicated as a protein normalization control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)ROCK Activity Is Down-regulated during Myogenesis—To address how RhoA regulates myogenic differentiation through its effector, we examined changes in ROCK activity during myogenesis. For this purpose, endogenous ROCK was immunoprecipitated from C2C12 cell extracts that had been prepared at different times after the shift to differentiation medium, and the immunoprecipitates were assayed for kinase activity using histone H1 as a substrate. The level of ROCK activity was considerably high at the beginning of differentiation (0 and 2 h in Fig. 3, A, upper panel; and B) but then declined to ∼50% of the peak within 2 days of differentiation. ROCK activity subsequently decreased gradually from days 2 to 6, reaching the background level at day 8 (Fig. 3, A, upper panel; and B). We also obtained the same result, even when we used MYPT-1, known as a specific substrate of ROCK, for the kinase assay (data not shown). In contrast to Rho, the ROCK protein level remained constant during differentiation (Fig. 3A, lower panel). It should be noted that there was a time lag between the first acute inactivation of Rho and the gradual inactivation of ROCK (compare 2 h in Figs. 1B and 3B), although ROCK is a direct effector of Rho (24Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Kakizuka A. Morii N. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). These results indicate that ROCK is active during the early and intermediate stages of C2C12 cell differentiation.Fig. 3ROCK activity during myogenesis. A, ROCK-I was immunoprecipitated with anti-ROCK-I antibody from whole cell lysates prepared at different times during differentiation (0 and 2 h and 2, 4, 6, and 8 days after differentiation). The immunoprecipitates were assayed for kinase activity using histone H1 as a substrate, whose phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography (upper panel). Levels of ROCK-I were confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-ROCK-I antibody (lower panel). cont, control.

The data were summarized from three independent sets of experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Acceleration of Myoblast Fusion by Precocious Inactivation of ROCK—To investigate whether ROCK is involved in myogenesis during the early and intermediate stages of differentiation, we tested the effect of Y-27632, a pharmacological inhibitor of ROCK/Rho kinase/ROK, whereby ROCK was inactivated in the early stage of differentiation just after the change to differentiation medium. C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in differentiation medium for 4 days in the presence or absence of Y-27632, and then the morphological change in the cells and MHC expression were monitored. As shown in Fig. 4A (panels b and d), syncytia that included a number of nuclei were dramatically increased in the presence of Y-27632. The high degree of myoblast fusion in Y-27632-treated cultures was also confirmed by determining the fusion index, which was enhanced by ∼4-fold in the presence of Y-27632 at day 6 of differentiation (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Effect of ROCK inhibitor on C2C12 cell differentiation. A, C2C12 cells were cultured in differentiation medium for 4 days in the presence (panels b and d) or absence (panels a and c) of 10 μm Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of ROCK. The cells were then fixed and stained for MHC (green; panels c and d). Cells were co-stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue; panels c and d) to identify nuclei. Panels a and b show phase-contrast images, and panels c and d show fluorescence microscopic images to detect MHC. Note that inhibition of ROCK by Y-27632 greatly facilitated formation of MHC-expressing multinucleated myotubes. Magnifications are ×40 (panels a and b) and ×200 (panels c and d). B, C2C12 cells were cultured in differentiation medium in the presence (▴) or absence (○)of10 μm Y-27632 and then fixed and stained for MHC at the indicated periods. The percentage of nuclei in multinucleated MHC-positive myotubes was calculated as a fusion index. The error bars represent the S.E. from 10 independent fields. C, cell lysates were prepared from control and Y-27632-treated C2C12 cells at the indicated periods (0, 2, 4, and 6 days after differentiation) and immunoblotted with anti-MyoD (first panel), anti-myogenin (second panel), or anti-MHC (third panel) antibody. Amido Black staining is indicated as a protein normalization control (fourth panel). Note the acceleration of MHC expression in Y-27632-treated C2C12 cells, in which it was readily detected after only 2 days of differentiation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further examine which event of the myogenic differentiation program was promoted by Y-27632, we performed immunoblot analysis of MyoD, myogenin, and MHC at different time points of differentiation (Fig. 4C). In Y-27632-treated C2C12 cells, the expression pattern of MyoD was not significantly different from that in control cells (Fig. 4C, first panel). However, at day 6, the expression of myogenin in the treated cells was decreased (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 4 and 8), probably because these cells were fully"
https://openalex.org/W2052796543,"The Rho family of small GTPases controls a wide range of cellular processes in eukaryotic cells, such as normal cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, gene regulation, actin cytoskeletal organization, cell fate determination, and neurite outgrowth. The activation of Rho-GTPases requires the exchange of GDP for GTP, a process catalyzed by the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. We demonstrate that a newly identified guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GEFT, is widely expressed in the brain and highly concentrated in the hippocampus, and the Purkinje and granular cells of the cerebellum. Exogenous expression of GEFT promotes dendrite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons, resulting in spines with larger size as compared with control spines. In neuroblastoma cells, GEFT promotes the active GTP-bound state of Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA and increases neurite outgrowth primarily via Rac1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PAK1 and PAK5, both downstream effectors of Rac1/Cdc42, are necessary for GEFT-induced neurite outgrowth. AP-1 and NF-κB, two transcriptional factors involved in neurite outgrowth and survival, were up-regulated in GEFT-expressing cells. Together, our data suggest that GEFT enhances dendritic spine formation and neurite outgrowth in primary neurons and neuroblastoma cells, respectively, through the activation of Rac/Cdc42-PAK signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2153383004,"MeCP2 is a transcription factor that recognizes and binds symmetrically methylated CpG dinucleotides to repress transcription. MeCP2 can associate with the Sin3a/histone deacetylase corepressor complex and mediate repression in a histone deacetylase-dependent manner. In extracts from rodent tissues, cultured cells, and Xenopus laevis oocytes, we find that only a small amount of mammalian MeCP2 interacts with Sin3a and that this interaction is not stable. Purification of rat brain MeCP2 (53 kDa) indicates no associated proteins despite an apparent molecular mass by size exclusion chromatography of 400–500 kDa. Biophysical analysis demonstrated that the large apparent size was not because of homo-multimerization, as MeCP2 consistently behaves as a monomeric protein that has an elongated shape. Our findings indicate the MeCP2 is not an obligate component of the Sin3a corepressor complex and may therefore engage a more diverse range of cofactors for repressive function.

Cytosine methylation is an important epigenetic mark on vertebrate genomes (1Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3159) Google Scholar). In mammals, methylation occurs mostly in the context of the CpG dinucleotide and can account for about 70–80% of genomic CpGs (2Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5254) Google Scholar). CpG methylation acts as an additional means of controlling genome function, beyond DNA base pair sequence. Because DNA methylation is copied faithfully to the newly replicating DNA strands during cell division, these marks can be maintained across development and act as a form of epigenetic memory. There are two general mechanisms by which CpG methylation is believed to function. First, modification of cytosines in the recognition sequence of DNA-binding proteins can inhibit their binding to cognate sequences and thus deny access to regulatory regions. Second, proteins have been identified that specifically bind the methyl-CpG dinucleotide via a methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) 1The abbreviations used are: MBD, methyl-CpG binding domain; HDAC(s), histone deacetylase(s); DTT, dithiothreitol; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EGS, ethylene glycolbis succinimidylsuccinate; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; AE, anion exchange; CE, cation exchange; r, recombinant.1The abbreviations used are: MBD, methyl-CpG binding domain; HDAC(s), histone deacetylase(s); DTT, dithiothreitol; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EGS, ethylene glycolbis succinimidylsuccinate; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; AE, anion exchange; CE, cation exchange; r, recombinant.

MeCP2 dysfunction is the sole identified determinant of Rett syndrome, the most common inherited form of mental retardation in females (19Amir R.E. Van den Veyver I.B. Wan M. Tran C.Q. Francke U.

MeCP2 has been shown to interact with the Sin3a-HDAC chromatin remodeling complex (14Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar). In Xenopus laevis it was reported that MeCP2 partially cofractionated with the Sin3a complex and proposed that xMeCP2 occurs in a stable complex with xSin3a (21Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A.

Both MeCP2 and Sin3a bind the promoter region of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene (23Chen W.G. Chang Q. Lin Y. Meissner A. West A.E. Griffith E.C. Jaenisch R. Greenberg M.E.

A similar situation occurs at the X. laevis xHairy2a gene, where MeCP2 and Sin3a bind upstream of the promoter region and repress transcription (26Stancheva I. Collins A.L. Van den Veyver I.B.

Native MeCP2 has not been purified previously from mammalian sources, leaving open the possibility that it may exist in a novel multiprotein complex. Here we investigate the association of MeCP2 with the Sin3a complex from both mammalian sources and X. laevis, and we purify native MeCP2 from rat brain. We conclude that MeCP2 does not stably associate with the Sin3a complex. Moreover, we find no evidence that MeCP2 forms a stable association either with itself or with other proteins in nuclear extracts. Hydrodynamic analysis of MeCP2 shows that it behaves as an elongated monomeric molecule. These findings raise the possibility that DNA-bound MeCP2 interacts differently with partner proteins compared with its unbound form. In addition, the results suggest that MeCP2 might interact with a range of cofactors in addition to Sin3a.

Ni-Nta affinity buffers (N) were 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (pH 8.0), supplemented with 20 mm imidazole (N20), 100 mm imidazole (N100), or 250 mm imidazole (N250). Gel filtration buffers were made in 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 3 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, supplemented with 150 mm KCl (GF150) or 500 mm KCl (GF500). Isolation of Rat Brain Nuclei and Nuclear Protein Extraction—Rat brains (∼450 brains obtained from Pel-Freez Biologicals) were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle. The brain powder was diluted 5 volumes to 1 in ice-cold buffer A containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mm EDTA, 2 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, and complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) followed by homogenization in a 60-ml Dounce (Braun) on a Potter S (Braun) motorized homogenizer (five strokes at 1100 rpm). The homogenate was layered onto a 10-ml cushion of buffer A and centrifuged in pre-chilled SW28 rotor at 24,000 rpm in an Beckman XL100 ultracentrifuge for 40 min at 3 °C. Recovered nuclei were resuspended in 5 volumes of buffer B containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and incubated on ice 10 min. The nuclei were pelleted at 250 × g and resuspended in 1 volume of buffer C containing 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 26% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) supplemented 400 mm NaCl. The extraction was allowed to proceed for 1 h on ice, and then the nuclei were pelleted at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was taken as the nuclear extract and dialyzed to the indicated salt concentration. Immunoprecipitation—MeCP2 or Gal4 antibodies were incubated with 500 μg of rat brain nuclear extract at 4 °C for 4 h. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the reaction and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer and run on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. MeCP2 (14Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar), Sin3a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC994 K20), and topoisomerase I (SC10783 H300) were identified by Western blotting. Large Scale Purification of Native MeCP2—All chromatography and dialyses were performed at 4 °C, and MeCP2 (14Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar), Sin3a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC994 K20), and HDAC 1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC7879 H51/SC7899 H54) containing fractions were identified by Western blotting. Rat brain nuclear extract (26 ml of 400 mm NaCl extraction) was dialyzed against CE150, and the insoluble material was pelleted at 13,000× g for 20 min at 4 °C. Soluble material (140 mg) was loaded onto an 8-ml SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column and eluted with a 160-ml linear gradient of CE100 to CE1000 collecting 4-ml fractions. MeCP2-containing fractions were combined (8.8 mg) and dialyzed against AE100. Dialyzed protein was loaded onto a 1-ml MonoQ (Amersham Biosciences) column and eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient of AE100 to AE1000. MeCP2-containing fractions from the flow-through and wash were combined (4 mg) and dialyzed against CE100. The protein was loaded onto a 1-ml heparin (Amersham Biosciences) affinity column and eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient of CE100 to CE1000. MeCP2-containing fractions (0.408 mg) were combined and dialyzed into N20. Ni-NTA resin (0.65 ml; Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with N20 was added to the dialyzed protein and mixed at 4 °C for 1 h. The Ni-NTA was applied to a 10-ml disposable column (Bio-Rad). The column was washed thoroughly with N20 and then eluted in batch with N100 and N250. MeCP2 eluted at the N100 step, and these fractions were pooled (0.148 mg). An aliquot of the N100 elution was applied to a Superose 12 (Amersham Biosciences) column and eluted from the column in GF500 collecting 0.5-ml fractions. Proteins from the gel filtration column were Western-blotted to identify MeCP2-containing fractions, and subsequently trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and stained with Sypro-Ruby stain (Bio-Rad). Bands were excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometry—To identify purified proteins, excised bands were in-gel trypsinized, and peptides were eluted from the gel slice. Mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on an Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-STR matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight instrument using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix. Spectra were analyzed in MS-Fit and then submitted to Protein Prospector (prospector.ucsf.edu/) for peptide matching. Xenopus Oocyte Extract and xMeCP2 Chromatography—Oocyte extract was prepared from one female as described previously (21Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). The extract (90 mg) was then loaded onto a 10-ml Bio-Rex 70 column exactly as described previously (21Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar) in Bio-Rex 70 exchange buffer (BE100) containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and washed with three column volumes of BE100. The column was batch-eluted with Bio-Rex 70 exchange buffer containing 500 mm NaCl (BE500), and fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with three independent xMeCP2 antibodies and an xSin3a antibody (a gift of P. L. Jones). The BE500 elution (250 μl) was separated on a Superose 6 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column in GF150 collecting 0.5-ml fractions. Proteins were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and run on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and Western blotted for xMeCP2 and xSin3a. MeCP2 Expression Plasmid—A human MeCP2 cDNA was used to PCR-amplify MeCP2 with primer pairs containing a 5′ NdeI site corresponding to the initiating ATG and 3′ EcoRI site downstream of the endogenous MeCP2 stop codon. The PCR fragment was inserted into the NdeI/EcoRI sites of the bacterial expression plasmid pET30b (Novagen) to create an untagged bacterial MeCP2 expression vector pET30bhMeCP2. Expression and Purification of Full-length Untagged MeCP2 in Bacteria—pET30bhMeCP2 was transformed into BL21 codon plus bacteria (a gift from Robin Allshire). Bacterial cultures (usually 0.5 or 1 liter) were grown in LB at 37 °C until the culture reached an A600 of 0.5 absorbance units. Cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted and lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) by sonicating on output setting 4–5 at 30% for 3 min with a Branson 250 sonifier. Extracts were centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 20,000 × g, and Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer were added to the supernatant. Recombinant MeCP2 was allowed to bind the beads mixing for 1 h at 4 °C and then applied to a 10-ml disposable column. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of N20 and batch-eluted with N250. MeCP2-containing fractions were identified by Coomassie Blue staining and dialyzed into CE200. The protein from the Ni-NTA elutions was loaded onto an Sp-Sepharose column and eluted with a linear gradient of CE200 to CE1000, and the MeCP2-containing fractions were combined and directly loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 26/60 (Amersham Biosciences) column and eluted with GF500. MeCP2-containing fractions were combined and dialyzed against CE200 and then loaded onto a 1-ml MonoS column. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of CE200 to CE1000, and MeCP2-containing factions were combined and dialyzed into CE200 and stored at –20 °C. Bandshift Analysis—Increasing concentrations of rMeCP2 (50, 100, 250, 500, and 750 ng) were bound to the CG11 probe (30Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. McKay S. Kleiner E.L. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 499-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) either methylated or unmethylated. The CG11 probe containing 27 CpGs was generated by digesting out an EcoRI/HindIII (New England Biolabs) fragment from the plasmid pCG11 (30Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. McKay S. Kleiner E.L. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 499-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The 135-bp CG11 fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis and agarose gel extraction. The CpGs in the resulting fragments were methylated with SssI methyltransferase (New England Biolabs), and the methylated or unmethylated CG11 probe was end-labeled with [32P]dCTP using Klenow (Roche Applied Science). The binding reactions were assembled in buffer containing 6 mm MgCl2, 3% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 150 mm KCl, 100 ng/μl poly(dA-dT) (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature in the absence of probe, and then the probe was added and incubated a further 25 min. The reactions were run on a 1.5% agarose gel and dried onto DE-81 anion exchange paper (Whatman). The bandshifts were exposed on a phosphor screen and analyzed on a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Competition with cold methylated and unmethylated probe at ∼100-fold excess was used to demonstrate the specificity of the bandshift. EGS Cross-linking—An EGS (Pierce) stock solution was made fresh to 25 mm in Me2SO. 5 μg of rMeCP2 was incubated in CE200 (without DTT or EDTA) with increasing concentrations of EGS (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 mm) in a 50-μl reaction volume. BSA (5 μg, monomer) and ADH (5 μg, tetramer) were included as internal controls for cross-linking efficiency. Cross-linking reactions were carried out at room temperature for 30 min. Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) (5 μl of 1.5 m) was added to quench the reaction for 15 min at room temperature. SDS-PAGE loading buffer (4×) was added, and the proteins separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Coomassie Blue staining to visualize the proteins. Gel Filtration and Sucrose Gradient Analysis of rMeCP2—A Superose 12 HR 10/30 gel filtration column was pre-equilibrated with gel filtration standards thyroglobin (669 kDa, RS = 8.5), apoferritin (443 kDa, RS = 6.1), B-amylase (200 kDa, RS = 5.4), ADH (150 kDa), BSA (66 kDa, RS = 3.55), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa, RS = 2). Recombinant MeCP2 (125 μg) was loaded onto the column pre-equilibrated with buffer GF500. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and 50 μl of each fraction was separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and Coomassie Blue-stained to verify the identity of protein observed from the A280 trace. Relative absorbance at 280 nm was plotted as the protein eluted from the Superose 12 column, and the radius was calculated by using an equation derived from the plotted standards. For sucrose gradient sedimentation ∼15 μg of rMeCP2, 50 μg of apoferritin (17.7 S), 30 μg of B-amylase (8.9 S), 50 μg of ADH (7.4 S), and 50 μg of BSA (4.3 S) were loaded onto a 13-ml linear 5–20% sucrose gradient made in 0.3 m KCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The gradient was centrifuged for 19 h at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 4 °C. Fractions (0.5 ml) were taken from the top of the gradient, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, run on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, Western-blotted using an anti-MeCP2 antibody or on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and Coomassie Blue-stained for the indicated standards. Densitometric analysis utilized Gene Tools Analysis Software package (SynGene), and values were adjusted for background. Intensity was plotted by fraction to determine the relative sedimentation coefficient of rMeCP2. Molecular Weight and Frictional Coefficient Calculations—Calculations to determine molecular weight and frictional coefficient (f/f0) were applied as described (31Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 32Kolb S.J. Hudmon A. Ginsberg T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol.

Biochemical Analysis of MeCP2 in Nuclear Extracts—Previous studies have demonstrated that Xenopus (21Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar) and mammalian MeCP2 can associate with the Sin3a complex (14Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar), but the properties of the mammalian Sin3a/MeCP2 interaction remain to be investigated. We confirmed that in rat brain nuclear extracts Sin3a is coimmunoprecipitated by antibodies against MeCP2 (Fig. 1a), but the amounts are small relative to input. In order to evaluate the relative amount of MeCP2 residing in a stable Sin3a complex, nuclear extracts from either rat brain or NG108 (mouse-rat neural-glial fusion) tissue culture cells were separated by size exclusion chromatography, and the resulting fractions were analyzed by Western blot with antibodies against MeCP2, Sin3a, and HDACs 1 and 2, which are components of the Sin3a complex. To our surprise most of Sin3a-containing fractions were devoid of detectable MeCP2. The majority of Sin3a eluted over the apparent molecular mass range of 500 kDa to 2 mDa, showing significant overlap with HDAC 1/2-containing fractions (Fig. 1b). In contrast, MeCP2 eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 400–500 kDa (Fig. 1b). Biochemical Purification of MeCP2 from Rat Brain—The predicted molecular mass of MeCP2 based on its amino acid sequence is between 52.4 and 53 kDa, depending on species. This is much smaller than the apparent molecular weight observed by size exclusion chromatography, indicating that MeCP2 may exist in a multiprotein complex. To test this possibility, a large scale biochemical purification of rat brain MeCP2 was devised (Fig. 2a). During the purification, MeCP2, Sin3a, and HDAC 1/2 were tracked by Western blotting. Sp-Sepharose and MonoQ columns efficiently separated MeCP2 from the majority of the Sin3a and HDAC 1/2-containing fractions, confirming that the majority of MeCP2 from nuclear extract is absent from the Sin3a complex. After four purification steps, three polypeptides were detected by SDS-PAGE, of which the middle band was identified as MeCP2 by Western blot (Fig. 2c). A final size exclusion chromatography step was applied to fractions eluted from the Ni-NTA column. SDS-PAGE of the resulting fractions (Fig. 2d) demonstrated that the apparent molecular weight of MeCP2 (400–500 kDa) remained constant over the purification. The SDS-PAGE analysis also showed a 90-kDa band whose elution profile overlapped with MeCP2. This protein was identified by mass spectrometry (data not shown) as topoisomerase I. We were able to rule out the possibility that MeCP2 associated with topoisomerase I as MeCP2 antibodies were unable to immunoprecipitate topoisomerase I from rat brain nuclear extract (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, an independent purification starting with 10 mg of rat brain extract yielded MeCP2 with the same Superose 12 size exclusion profile but in the absence of detectable topoisomerase I (data not shown). We conclude that MeCP2 in rat brain extracts, despite its large apparent molecular weight, does not exist in a complex with other proteins. Biochemical Analysis of MeCP2 from X. laevis Oocytes—A previous report (21Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar) suggested that X. laevis MeCP2 cofractionated with X. laevis Sin3a (xSin3a). To re-visit this observation, we made extract from X. laevis oocytes and separated it by Bio-Rex 70 ion exchange chromatography (Fig. 3, a and b), using the procedures described previously (21Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Western blots using antibodies directed against xMeCP2 and xSin3a were used to monitor the elution of these proteins (Fig. 3b). Proteins from the Bio-Rex 70 step were separated by size exclusion chromatography, and fractions were analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 3c). The xSin3a protein elutes in a complex with an apparent mass of 500 kDa to 2 mDa, whereas xMeCP2, like mammalian MeCP2, elutes with an apparent molecular mass of 400–500 kDa. In agreement with our observations in mammalian extracts (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) and with an independent study of Xenopus oocyte extracts (33Ryan J. Llinas A.J. White D.A. Turner B.M. Sommerville J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2441-2452PubMed Google Scholar), X. laevis MeCP2 does not coelute with fractions containing the majority of the xSin3a corepressor complex.

https://openalex.org/W1976321043,"Rhodobacter capsulatus E1F1 grows phototrophically with nitrate as nitrogen source. Using primers designed for conserved motifs in bacterial assimilatory nitrate reductases, a 450-bp DNA was amplified by PCR and used for the screening of a genomic library. A cosmid carrying an insert with four SalI fragments of 2.8, 4.1, 4.5, and 5.8 kb was isolated, and DNA sequencing revealed that it contains a nitrate assimilation (nas) gene region, including the hcp gene coding for a hybrid cluster protein (HCP). Expression of hcp is probably regulated by a nitrite-sensitive repressor encoded by the adjacent nsrR gene. A His6-HCP was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified. HCP contained about 6 iron and 4 labile sulfide atoms per molecule, in agreement with the presence of both [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-2S-2O] clusters, and showed hydroxylamine reductase activity, forming ammonia in vitro with methyl viologen as reductant. The apparent Km values for NH2OH and methyl viologen were 1 mm and 7 μm, respectively, at the pH and temperature optima (9.3 and 40 °C). The activity was oxygen-sensitive and was inhibited by sulfide and iron reagents. R. capsulatus E1F1 grew phototrophically, but not heterotrophically, with 1 mm NH2OH as nitrogen source, and up to 10 mm NH2OH was taken up by anaerobic resting cells. Ammonium was transiently accumulated in the media, and its assimilation was prevented by l-methionine-d,l-sulfoximine, a glutamine synthetase inhibitor. In addition, hydroxylamine- or nitrite-grown cells showed the higher hydroxylamine reductase activities. However, R. capsulatus B10S, a strain lacking the whole hcp-nas region, did not grow with 1 mm NH2OH. Also, E. coli cells overproducing HCP tolerate hydroxyl-amine better during anaerobic growth. These results suggest that HCP is involved in assimilation of NH2OH, a toxic product that could be formed during nitrate assimilation, probably in the nitrite reduction step.

Bacteria use nitrate as a nitrogen source for growth, as a terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration, or as an electron sink for redox balancing. Three different types of bacterial nitrate-reducing systems have been described: the cytoplasmic assimilatory Nas, the membrane-bound respiratory Nar, and the periplasmic dissimilatory Nap (1Moreno-Vivián C. Cabello P. Martínez-Luque M. Blasco R. Castillo F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6573-6584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Richardson D.J. Berks B.C. Russell D.A. Spiro S. Taylor C.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 165-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Nitrate assimilation is a key process of the nitrogen cycle that has been an object of biochemical and genetic research in higher plants, fungi, algae, and cyanobacteria, although it has only been scarcely studied in other bacteria. It is firmly established that the assimilatory nitrate-reducing system consists of a nitrate transport system and two metalloenzymes, the assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reductases, which catalyze the stepwise reduction of nitrate to nitrite and ammonium (1Moreno-Vivián C.

Plant Physiol. 1981; 32: 169-204Crossref Google Scholar). Nitrate assimilation is usually regulated by nitrate/nitrite induction and ammonium repression. Genes coding for the assimilatory nitrate-reducing systems are normally clustered and have been cloned in several bacteria. These gene clusters code for regulatory and structural proteins required for uptake and reduction of both nitrate and nitrite (1Moreno-Vivián C. Cabello P. Martínez-Luque M. Blasco R. Castillo F.

Only a few strains of purple phototrophic bacteria assimilate nitrate. Rhodobacter capsulatus E1F1 uses nitrate or nitrite as a nitrogen source, but only under photoanaerobic conditions because nitrite or hydroxylamine are toxic for heterotrophic growth (5Moreno-Vivian C.

The purified assimilatory nitrate reductase of this strain is composed of a 95-kDa catalytic subunit with iron-sulfur and molybdenumbis-molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactors, and a 46-kDa FAD-containing diaphorase (7Blasco R.

However, the crystallographic structures at high resolution of the D. desulfuricans and D. vulgaris HCPs reveal that they do not contain a [6Fe-6S] cluster but instead have two types of iron-sulfur centers: cluster 1, a typical cubane [4Fe-4S] coordinated by four Cys residues located in the N-terminal domain, and cluster 2, a novel hybrid [4Fe-2S-2O] center located at the interface of the three protein domains (14Arendsen A.F.

An unusual feature of the hybrid center is that it has four different oxidation states within the biologically relevant range of redox potentials. EPR spectra of the reduced HCP from Escherichia coli indicate the presence of an N-terminal [2Fe-2S] center instead of a [4Fe-4S] cluster (18Van den Berg W.A. Hagen W.R. van Dongen W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 666-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The Cys motif for binding this cluster 1 in Desulfovibrio and other strictly anaerobic bacteria has the C-X2-C-X7–8-C-X5-C spacing, whereas in E. coli and other facultative anaerobic bacteria has the sequence C-X2-C-X11-C-X6-C (18Van den Berg W.A. Hagen W.R. van Dongen W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 666-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Pereira A.S. Tavares P. Krebs C. Huynh B.H. Rusnak F. Moura I. Moura J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Genes encoding HCP proteins have been identified in a large number of both strict anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria and Archaea. However, hcp genes are not present in the completely sequenced genomes of some prokaryotes. In E. coli (18Van den Berg W.A. Hagen W.R. van Dongen W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 666-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), Thiobacillus ferrooxidans (20Dominy C. Deane S.M. Rawlings D.E. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 3123-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). and Salmonella enterica (21Kim C.C. Monack D. Falkow S. Infect. Immunol. 2003; 71: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a gene coding for a putative NADH oxidoreductase (hcr) is located immediately downstream of the hcp gene, and the HCR protein of E. coli catalyzes reduction of HCP in the presence of NADH (18Van den Berg W.A. Hagen W.R. van Dongen W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 666-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, hcr genes are not found near the hcp genes present in the genomes of other bacteria and Archaea. Despite the fact that HCP has received a lot of attention due to the unusual properties of its hybrid cluster, the regulation and the physiological function of this protein remain enigmatic. As the E. coli and Morganella morganii HCPs are only detected in cells grown anaerobically with nitrate or nitrite, it has been suggested that HCP have a role in nitrate and/or nitrite respiration (18Van den Berg W.A. Hagen W.R. van Dongen W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 666-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A similar increase in the expression of hcp gene was observed during anaerobic growth with nitrate in Shewanella oneidensis (22Beliaev A.S. Thompson D.K. Khare T. Lim H. Brandt C.C. Li G. Murray A.E. Heidelberg J.F. Giometti C.S. Yates III, J. Nealson K.H. Tiedje J.M. Zhoui J. OMICS J. Integrative Biol. 2002; 6: 39-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and a nitrite-inducible Fnr-dependent promoter was identified upstream of nipAB, the hcp-hcr homologues of S. enterica (21Kim C.C. Monack D. Falkow S. Infect. Immunol. 2003; 71: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, in Clostridium perfringens HCP has been proposed to be involved in the adaptive response to oxidative stress (23Briolat V. Reysset G. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2333-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that the E. coli HCP protein exhibits an oxygen-sensitive hydroxylamine reductase activity (24Wolfe M.T. Heo J. Garavelli J.S. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5898-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similarity of the HCP proteins to the FeNiS-containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases has also been observed, and interestingly, a variant of Rhodospirillum rubrum CO dehydrogenase carrying a H265V amino acid substitution acquires hydroxylamine reductase activity (25Heo J. Wolfe M.T. Staples C.R. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5894-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). EPR and crystallographic studies also suggest that HCP could act as a reductase, although its physiological role as hydroxylamine reductase has been questioned (17Aragão D. Macedo S. Mitchell E.P. Romão C.V. Liu M.Y. Frazão C. Saraiva L.M. Xavier A.V. LeGall J. van Dongen W.M. Hagen W.R. Texeira M. Carrondo M.A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this work we describe for the first time the capability of R. capsulatus E1F1 to growth with hydroxylamine as the sole nitrogen source under phototrophic conditions, and the cloning of a nitrate assimilation (nas) gene region that includes a hcp gene, which is probably regulated by a nitrite-sensitive repressor encoded by the adjacent nsrR gene. A recombinant His6-tagged HCP protein has been expressed in E. coli, and the hydroxylamine reductase activity of the purified protein has been characterized. Evidence that the HCP protein is responsible for the in vivo hydroxylamine reduction is also presented. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in Table I. R. capsulatus was grown at 30 °C on peptone-yeast extract plates or RCV minimal medium (26Weaver P.F. Wall J.D. Gest H. Arch. Microbiol. 1975; 105: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) under phototrophic (light-anaerobiosis) or heterotrophic (dark-aerobiosis) conditions, as previously described (31Reyes F. Roldán M.D. Klipp W. Castillo F. Moreno-Vivián C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). d,l-Malate (4 g liter–1) was routinely used as the carbon source, and glutamate, KNO3, NH4Cl (1 g liter–1 each), KNO2 or NH2OH (1 mm each) were used as the nitrogen sources. E. coli strains were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani (LB) liquid or solid media at 37 °C (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or anaerobically in the LB medium with 10 mm KNO3 and 0.4% glycerol.Table IBacterial strains and plasmids used in this workPhenotype or characteristicsaAmpR, ampicillin-resistance marker; ChlR, chloramphenicol-resistance marker; KanR, kanamycin-resistance marker; TetR, tetracycline-resistance marker; StrR, streptomycin-resistance marker.Source or ref.Bacterial strainsR. capsulatus E1F1Wild type, Nas+26Weaver P.F.

Open table in a new tab Preparation of Cell-free Extracts—Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min, washed, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), and broken by cavitation at 90 W for 15 s (3 pulses of 5 s) in a VibraCell sonifier. The extracts were placed into anaerobic tubes under argon atmosphere, centrifuged again at 20,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatant was kept anaerobically at –20 °C until use. Analytical Determinations and Enzyme Assays—Cell growth was followed turbidimetrically measuring the absorbance of the cultures at 680 nm for R. capsulatus or at 600 nm for E. coli strains. Ammonium was determined by the phenol-hypochlorite method (32Solorzano L. Limnol. Oceanogr. 1969; 14: 799-801Crossref Scopus (3136) Google Scholar) using the microdiffusion technique as described by Wolfe et al. (24Wolfe M.T. Heo J. Garavelli J.S. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5898-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Hydroxylamine was measured by the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate reaction as previously described (33Korpela T.K. Mäkelä M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Protein was estimated according to Lowry et al. (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217315) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Labile sulfur determination in the purified HCP was performed by reaction with N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and FeCl3 following the described methods (36Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and using a calibration curve with Na2S·9H2O in NaOH (under nitrogen atmosphere) as standard. Labile iron was determined in samples heated at 80 °C for 10 min by reaction with sodium methasulfite and bathophenanthroline as previously described (37Nilsson U.A. Bassen M. Sävman K. Kjellmer I. Free Radic. Res. 2002; 36: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), using a calibration curve with FeSO4·7H2O as standard. Hydroxylamine reductase activity was routinely assayed anaerobically (argon atmosphere) measuring the ammonia generated in the reaction with reduced methyl viologen as artificial electron donor (24Wolfe M.T. Heo J. Garavelli J.S. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5898-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained, per ml, 100 μmol of CHES (pH 9.3), 10 nmol of EDTA, 0.5 μmol of methyl viologen, 10 μmol of sodium dithionite, 10 μmol of NH2OH, and the adequate amount of cell extract or HCP protein. When required, other electron donors were used, or the assays were carried out in the presence of possible enzyme inhibitors at the indicated concentrations. NADH-dependent hydroxylamine reductase activity in R. capsulatus cell-free extracts was assayed by following NADH oxidation at 340 nm in anaerobic cuvettes containing, per ml, 100 μmol of CHES (pH 9.3), 10 nmol of EDTA, 0.25 μmol of NADH, 10 μmol of NH2OH, and the adequate amount of cell extract. The apparent Km values for NH2OH and methyl viologen were determined by varying the concentrations of these substrates in the assay (from 0 to 50 mm for NH2OH and from 0 to 10 mm for methyl viologen). Determination of the optimal pH for hydroxylamine reductase activity was performed by using either a mixed buffer (MES, MOPS, HEPES, Tris-HCl and CHES, 10 mm each) or a 100 mm CHES buffer at various pH values. The presented data are representative of at least three independent experiments with standard deviations lower than 15%. DNA Methods—Routine DNA manipulations (DNA isolation, restriction enzyme analysis, agarose gel electrophoresis, cloning procedures, and PCR amplifications) were performed using standard methods (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Conserved motifs in the bacterial nitrate reductases were used to design nas-specific primers taking into account the preferential codon usage of R. capsulatus. Thus, the amino acid sequences of the assimilatory nitrate reductases of Klebsiella oxytoca (PID 4755082), Bacillus subtilis (PID 2828506), Shewanella frigidimarina (PID 2275099), Oscillatoria chalybea (PID 899356), Synechocystis sp. (PID 1652567), and Synechococcus sp. (PID 397157) were aligned and the conserved motifs TGQPNAMGGRE, GTMTNSERRVTL, and AFRPPPGEARADW (positions 343–353, 466–477, and 480–492 of the Synechocystis sp. protein, respectively) were selected for the synthesis of one specific forward primer (NAS2) and two reverse primers (NAS3a and NAS3b). The amplification reactions were performed as described previously (38López-Lozano A. Diez J. El Alaoui S. Moreno-Vivián C. García-Fernández J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Ecol. 2002; 41: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), using the NAS2 primer 5′-ACSGGSCAGCCSAACGCSATGGGSGSCCGSGA-3′ and either the NAS3a primer 5′-GAYSCGSCGYTCCGAGTTSGTCAYSGTGCC-3′ or the NAS3b primer 5′-CCAGKCSGCSCGSGCYTCGGCSGGSGGCGG-3′. For the construction of a genomic library of R. capsulatus E1F1, the Lambda FIX® II/XhoI Partial Fill-In Vector Kit (Stratagene) was used following the instructions of the suppliers, and the total genomic DNA from strain E1F1 was partially digested with Sau3AI. The optimal conditions for obtaining the appropriate insert sizes, from 9 to 23 kb, were 0.06 unit of the enzyme, 20 μg of DNA and 15 min incubation. This Sau3AI-digested DNA was partially filled in with dGTP and dATP using the Klenow polymerase, and then ligated into the vector. DNA was packed using the Gigapack® II Packing Extract Kit (Stratagene) under the conditions recommended by the suppliers. Southern blots and hybridization experiments were carried out with the non-radioactive digoxigenin kit from Roche Applied Science. DNA sequencing was performed automatically using an ABI PRISM 373 sequencer and sequence analysis was carried out with the Genetics Computer Group software package programs and data base searches using the BLAST program (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). The pCap27 plasmid with the 2.8-kb SalI DNA fragment carrying the hcp and nsrR genes (see Fig. 1), and the different mobilizable suicide vectors (pSUP) indicated in Table I were used to construct an insertion mutant in the hcp gene of R. capsulatus, and the resulting recombinant plasmids were mobilized from E. coli S17-1 into R. capsulatus E1F1S by filter matings (27Moreno-Vivián C. Roldán M.D. Reyes F. Castillo F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 115: 279-284Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Construction, Expression, and Purification of a His6-tagged HCP Protein—A 1.6-kb DNA fragment with the whole hcp gene was amplified by PCR using the primers HcpF (5′-AGCCTTCCGGATCCATTGCATCCAATG-3′, BamHI restriction site underlined) and HcpR (5′-CACAAAGCCACTCCACCTGTCTCG-3′). This fragment was first cloned into pGEM-T and then subcloned, as a SalI-BamHI fragment, into the pQE32 expression vector to give the final construct pHCP1, in which the polyhistidine coding sequence of the vector was fused inframe to the 5′ end of the R. capsulatus hcp gene. This plasmid pHCP1 was sequenced to confirm that the fusion was made in the correct reading frame and to check the absence of possible mutations generated by PCR. The E. coli JM109 strain carrying the pHCP1 plasmid was cultured aerobically at 37 °C on a shaker at 250 rpm in conical flasks with LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml–1). When the cultures reached an absorbance at 600 nm of about 0.6, 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce HCP expression and the cultures were grown for a further 3 h. After disrupting the cells, 1 mm of the protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm thiocyanate, 0.2 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 20% glycerol were also added, and these soluble extracts containing the recombinant HCP protein were loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column. Proteins were eluted with an imidazole gradient (10 to 500 mm), and fractions were kept under argon atmosphere until use. Western Blots with Anti-His6 Antibodies—For electrophoretic separation, samples were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels, with 14% (w/v) resolving gels and 5% (w/v) stacking gels. These gels were used in Western blot analysis or were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Western blots to detect the His6-tagged HCP protein were performed by using monoclonal anti-polyhistidine clone his-1 from mouse ascites fluid as primary antibody and anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate from goat as second antibody. UV Visible Absortion Spectra—HCP samples were placed in anaerobically sealed serum-stoppered quartz cuvettes and spectra were recorded before and after addition of dithionite, thionine, or hydroxylamine in a DU 7500 (Beckman) spectrophotometer. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of the R. capsulatus E1F1 nas Gene Region—To identify and clone the DNA region encoding the assimilatory nitrate reduction system of R. capsulatus E1F1, PCR amplifications were performed using genomic DNA from the strain E1F1 as template and nas-specific primers designed taking into account the Rhodobacter codon usage, as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” DNA fragments of about 400 and 450 bp were amplified using the NAS2/NAS3a and NAS2/NAS3b primer pairs, respectively, and cloned into the pGEM-T vector. These sizes agree with the length of the DNA regions located between the primers in the different genes coding for bacterial assimilatory nitrate reductases. Sequencing of both fragments confirmed that they correspond to the expected internal regions of the R. capsulatus E1F1 nasA gene coding for the catalytic subunit of the nitrate reductase. The 0.45-kb fragment of the nasA gene was also used as a probe for the screening of a genomic library of R. capsulatus E1F1 generated in the lambda Fix® II vector (Stratagene), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two positive cosmids containing the putative nas gene region of this bacterium were identified. One of them was subjected to restriction analysis and four SalI DNA fragments of 2.8, 4.1, 4.5, and 5.8 kb were present in the corresponding insert (Fig. 1). Cloning and sequencing of these fragments revealed the presence of a 17,155-bp nas gene region that includes putative genes coding for an ABC-type nitrate/nitrite transport system (nasFED), structural genes encoding the nitrate reductase (nasA), and the nitrite reductase subunits (nasB, nirD), regulatory genes (nsrR, nasTS), and genes probably involved in taxis toward nitrate (nnrS) and in the synthesis of the molybdenum-bis-molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor (moaD) of the nitrate reductase and the siroheme cofactor (cysG) of the nitrite reductase (Fig. 1). The nucleotide sequence data of this 17-kb nas gene region have been deposited in the EMBL, GenBank™, and DDBI Nucleotide Sequence Databases under the accession number AY273169. The 2.8-kb SalI fra"

Four aptameric binding motifs directed at blood-borne targets are used as a model set from which larger, multidomain aptamers are constructed in a straightforward manner. Intra- or intermolecular ligation of precursor oligonucleotides provides a stabilizing mechanism against degradation by the predominant exonuclease activity of blood products without the need for post-selection chemical modification. In many cases, circular DNA aptamer half-lives are extended beyond 10 h in serum and plasma, making such constructs viable for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Duplexes and three-way junctions are used as scaffold architectures around which two, three, or four aptameric motifs can be arranged in a structurally defined manner, giving rise to improved binding characteristics through stability and avidity gains. Circular aptamers targeted against thrombin display improved anticoagulant potency with EC50 values 2–3-fold better than those of the canonical GS-522 thrombin DNA aptamer. Intrinsic duplex regions provide an opportunity to incorporate additional transcription factor binding motifs, whereas ancillary loops can be used to provide further functionality. These anticoagulant aptamers provide a starting point for merging the principles of DNA nanotechnology with aptameric functions.

Gut. 2003; 52: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) by processes that have recently been automated (11Cox J.C. Hayhurst A. Hesselberth J.R. Bayer T.S. Georgiou G. Ellington A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e108Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Simultaneous advances in signaling and detection strategies have improved the outlook for aptamer arrays in proteomic and biosensor applications. Whereas the high affinity and specificity of aptamers toward their molecular targets make them well suited for these tasks, the susceptibility of natural nucleic acids to nucleolytic degradation is a serious hurdle for uses in biological fluids. Strategies to improve the nuclease stability of aptamers, as for antisense nucleic acids, have included the use of chemical modifications such as phosphorothioate, locked nucleic acid, 2′-O-methyl- and 2′-fluoro-nucleotides (12Kurreck J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1628-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), as well as mirror-image Spiegelmers (13Vater A. Klussmann S. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2003; 6: 253-261PubMed Google Scholar). Of most relevance for potential therapeutic applications, some common nucleic acid stabilization strategies have encountered problems associated with toxic degradation products (14Levin A.A. BBA-Gene Str. Expr. 1999; 1489: 69-84Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In addition, modification performed post-selection can alter the subtle binding interactions of the selected natural aptamer (15Boiziau C. Dausse E. Yurchenko L. Toulme J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12730-12737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Blank M. Weinschenk T. Priemer M. Schluesener H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16464-16468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Circularization of natural aptamers is an attractive alternative to chemical modification for improving aptamer stability. With the majority of nucleic acid degradation activity arising from plasma exonucleases (17Shaw J.P. Kent K. Bird J. Fishback J. Froehler B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), modification of exposed termini often achieves a sufficient improvement in stability for use in vivo (12Kurreck J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1628-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), and circular constructs eliminate this primary source of degradation entirely. Moreover, circularization permits the use of natural nucleotides, which should avoid potential toxicity associated with chemical modification. In principle, circular aptamer constructs can be produced by either intra- or intermolecular ligation followed by exonucleolysis of unreacted products, a straightforward and efficient approach to their preparation (see Fig. 1A). With selected aptamers often forming a stem-loop structure, closing the stem into a duplex with a hairpin loop should not appreciably alter the binding loop structure and may confer added stability. Furthering this concept, two stem-loop aptamers with complementary overhangs can in principle be ligated to form a double-headed dumbbell aptamer linked by a duplex region. By analogy, higher order multiheaded aptamers could then be formed around single or double junction architectures (see Fig. 1B). With the ability to combine multiple aptamer activities into a single construct comes the notion of multitasking or pleiotropic aptamers. Functions are not confined to those associated with aptameric activity only, as transcription factor recognition or other sequences can be introduced into duplex regions and specific labels can be added as loop components (see Fig. 1C). In this way, modular pleiotropic constructs with a broad range of combinatorial functions could be produced from a smaller number of aptameric heads. The ability to incorporate multiple identical binding domains in a structurally determined manner may improve binding characteristics through avidity gains in a manner analogous to antibodies. Other benefits of multivalency may lie in the development of aptamer therapeutics for diseases that require simultaneous binding of two or more targets, such as disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, treated by combining anticoagulant and antiselectin therapy (18Norman K.E. Cotter M.J. Stewart J.B. Abbitt K.B. Ali M. Wagner B.E. Wallace W.A.H. Forlow S.B. Hellewell P.G. Blood. 2003; 101: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), or for cancers associated with coagulation enhancement (19Zacharski L.R. Cancer Lett. 2002; 186: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here we report the design and construction of multimeric DNA aptamers based largely around a blood coagulation model. The archetypal GS-522 DNA aptamer (3Bock L.C. Griffin L.C. Latham J.A. Vermaas E.H. Toole J.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 564-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (2117) Google Scholar), which binds to the fibrinogen exosite I of thrombin, is used to compare the activities and stabilities of multivalent circular constructs also based around this aptamer domain. Oligonucleotides—Controls were GS-522 (thrombin exosite 1), GGTTGGTGAGGTTGG and 60–18(29) (thrombin exosite 2), AGTCCGTGGTAGGGCAGGTTGGGGTGACT.

Dimeric aptamer formation was as follows: cTA-1 = pT-1 + pA-1 + ligation (L), cTT-1 = pTT-1 + L, cTT-2 = pTT-2 + L, cTU-1 = pTU-1 + L, cTU-2 = pTU-2 + L, cTU-3 = pTU-3 + L, cTT-6 = (2 × pT-6) + L. Trimeric aptamer formation was as follows: cTTA-1 = pTT3–1+ pA-1 + L, cTTA-2 = pTT3–2 + pA-1 + L, cTUA-1 = pTU3–1 + pA-1 + L, cTSA-1 = pTS3–1 + pA-1 + L, cTRA-1 = pTR3–1 + pA-1 + L. Tetrameric aptamer formation was as follows: cTTTT-1 = (2 × cTT3–1) + L and cTTTT-2 = (2 × cTT3–2) + L. Aptamer Preparation—Oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma Genosys, Oswel, Eurogentec, or Genset Pacific in desalted form with 5′-phosphate groups to allow for subsequent ligation. For constructs that required the ligation of multiple oligonucleotide sequences, each was added at an equimolar ratio typically at a concentration of 100 μm. Prior to ligation, constructs were heated to 95 °C in T4 DNA ligase buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, pH 7.8) and slow-cooled to room temperature. Typically, T4 DNA ligase was added at 10 units/μg oligonucleotide and incubated overnight at 15–37 °C. Following a further incubation at 75 °C for 10 min, products were exchanged into the appropriate buffer by spin column chromatography (Bio-Rad Micro Biospin-6), and any remaining uncircularized oligonucleotides were digested with either T4 DNA polymerase or exonuclease III. For the production of unsymmetrical or heteromeric constructs, EcoRI and MfeI restriction enzymes were included in the ligation reaction and/or added after ligation to ensure unwanted symmetrical or homomeric products were relinearized. Reaction mixtures were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation prior to quantitation by UV spectrophotometry (Varian Cary100 Bio). Products were verified by mobility analysis following native and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8–20%). Thermal Melt Analysis—Melting profiles were obtained using a Varian Cary 100 Bio spectrophotometer and analyzed with Cary Thermal software. Aptamers at a concentration of 2 μm were heated to 95 °C and slow-cooled in selection buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) prior to obtaining melting profiles at a heating rate of 1 °C/min. Physical Stability—Aptamer constructs at a concentration of 300 nm were incubated in blood products at 37 °C for periods up to 30 h. At each time point, 150 μl of samples were removed and diluted into 350 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and 500 μl of TE-saturated phenol-chloroform. The solutions were repeatedly heated to 50 °C and vortexed. An oligonucleotide standard was added prior to phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation to allow for normalization of extracted samples. Purified samples were run on denaturing PAGE gels. Following staining with Sybr Green II (Sigma), the intact aptamer and oligonucleotide standard bands were quantitated with a Fluor-S imager (Bio-Rad). Functional Stability—Aptamer constructs (100 nm) were incubated at 37 °C in 67 μl of serum or plasma for periods up to 30 h. Following incubation, clotting in the incubated samples was initiated with the addition of thrombin (final concentration 12.3 nm) and fibrinogen (final concentration 2 mg/ml) (added only for serum assays) with selection buffer and 10 mm CaCl2 up to a volume of 200 μl. The clotting reaction was monitored at 410 nm in a microtitre plate reader. Clotting times were determined as the point of half-maximal absorbance change. Anticoagulant Activity—Fibrinogen (2 mg/ml) and aptamer (0–1 μm) were preincubated in selection buffer plus 10 mm CaCl2, 33% serum plus 10 mm CaCl2, or 33% plasma at 37 °C. Coagulation was initiated with warmed thrombin (final concentration 12.3 nm) or thrombin plus CaCl2 and monitored at 410 nm in a microtitre plate. Clotting times, which were typically standardized at 22 s, were determined as the point of half-maximal absorbance change. EC50 values were determined as the aptamer concentration producing a doubling in clotting time. Aptamer Design and Construction—To explore basic aspects of multivalent circular aptamer construction, four natural DNA aptamer domains that bind vascular protein targets were sourced from the literature. These domains, which were all compatible with hairpin loop formation, bound to thrombin exosite I (the “T” aptamer head) (3Bock L.C. Griffin L.C. Latham J.A. Vermaas E.H. Toole J.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 564-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (2117) Google Scholar), thrombin exosite II (the “U” head) (20Tasset D.M. Kubik M.F. Steiner W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), l-selectin (“S”) (21Hicke B.J. Watson S.R. Koenig A. Lynott C.K. Bargatze R.F. Chang Y.F. Ringquist S. Moon-McDermott L.

Investig. 1996; 98: 2688-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and a red blood cell marker (“R”) (22Morris K.N. Jensen K.B. Julin C.M. Weil M. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2902-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). A uniquely aminated (“A”) hairpin derived from a well characterized DNA loop (23van Dongen M.J.P. Mooren M.M.W. Willems E.F.A. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Wijmenga S.S. Hilbers C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was included as an ancillary domain. All aptamer sequences were designed with additional flanking regions to form extended stem-loop structures. For the U, S, and R aptamer heads, whose minimal motifs already carried short stem regions, sequences were simply extended as necessary. For the T aptamer head, additional complementary sequence was added to both ends of the canonical 15-mer oligonucleotide to form the required stem. A non-pairing thymidine residue was generally included adjacent to the 5′ end of the minimal motif to allow for a degree of structural compensation. In construct nomenclature, the prefix “p” denotes a 5′-phosphate group (indicating linearity) whereas “c” denotes a covalently circularized product, with suffix numerals denoting individual constructs. Thus, pTT-1 is a folded but unligated aptamer with two thrombin exosite I binding regions, whereas cTUA-2 is a circular construct with three heads: thrombin exosite I, thrombin exosite II, and an aminated hairpin. Combined with other construction principles described below, this set of building blocks permits the production of a wide diversity of aptamers with two, three or four functional heads (Fig. 1, A–C). After annealing, the template oligonucleotide for the simplest circularization reaction forms a dumbbell structure with aptamers located at the extremities separated by a singly nicked duplex (Fig. 1A, i). This nick can be sealed by ligation using chemical methods or a DNA ligase to form a divalent circular aptamer (Fig. 1A, ii). Any unligated aptamer can be removed by exonucleolysis (Fig. 1A, iii) prior to final product cleanup. Good ligation efficiency is an essential requirement for efficient circular aptamer production. Although various constructs could be successfully ligated using chemical methods, 1S. M. Knox and G. C. King, unpublished data. we here concentrate upon enzymatic ligation for compatibility with bioprocessing. Designing constructs with the shortest possible duplex region between functional aptamer domains may prove important for both functionality and production. Whereas pTT-1 containing a 6-bp internal duplex could not be circularized under any conditions attempted using T4 DNA ligase, pTT-2 containing an 8-bp duplex was ligated at a yield of ∼40% under the reaction conditions tested (Fig. 2A). Because general rules for predicting ligation efficiency are not apparent, ligation of a set of three closely related pTU constructs differing only in a single duplex position adjacent to the T head was examined for comparison with pTT-2 (Fig. 2A). Addition of a single base pair to the duplex of pTU-1 (i.e. 9 bp in total) resulted in near quantitative ligation of the construct (Fig. 2A) consistent with the behavior of pTT-1 and pTT-2. For the pTU-2 construct, where the duplex length was increased to 10 bp by the addition of an adenine residue to pair with the non-bonding thymine adjacent to the T head, ligation efficiency actually dropped slightly to 90%. Moreover, demonstrating the balance of influences upon ligation efficiency, replacement of this terminal A:T pair with a clamping G:C pair in the pTU-3 construct caused ligation efficiency to drop significantly to 60% yield (Fig. 2A). To reduce the size and complexity of oligonucleotide precursors, single ligation of an aptamer (Fig. 1B, i) can be replaced by double ligation of two smaller precursors bearing complementary oligonucleotide overhangs (Fig. 1B, ii–iv), thereby introducing modularity through specific hybridization and ligation. To further generalize the concept of modularity, any desired binding activities should preferably be combined without the need to synthesize new precursor sequence(s) for every desired aptamer combination. The use of palindromic sequence overhangs (Fig. 2B, i) can facilitate this goal but introduces the complication of allowing hybridization between identical components, forming undesired homodimers at the same time as the desired heterodimer. For the production of pure heterodimers, this situation can be overcome by the use of a pair of related restriction enzymes that digest only homodimers while leaving heterodimers intact (Fig. 2B, ii). The EcoR I/Mfe I restriction enzyme pairing works well in this context (Fig. 2C). For higher order circular aptamers, specific architectures can be constructed depending upon the intended use and the desired orientations of the functional heads. Three-way junctions can form the underlying structural motif for triple-headed circular aptamers (Fig. 1B, iii), whereas four-headed constructs can be formed from a topologically distinct dimer of three-way junctions (Fig. 1B, iv) or from a single four-way (Holliday) junction (not shown). Three-way junction sequences can be specifically chosen to project functional heads in particular orientations either symmetrically or asymmetrically. Using rules previously developed for sequences defining three-way junction structure (24van Buuren B.N.M. Overmars F.J.J. Ippel J.H. Altona C. Wijmenga S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), two examples of asymmetrical junctions J3CC (25Rosen M.A. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6576-6587Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and TWJ3 (26Overmars F.J.J. Pikkemaat J.A. van den Elst H. van Boom J.H. Altona C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 702-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were chosen for use here. The asymmetric orientation allows for the production of triple-headed circular aptamers that are topological analogues of protein antibodies containing two (homo- or heteromeric) binding domains and an ancillary/signaling domain. Two structural isomers of the asymmetric junction can form with alternate arms stacked in a colinear manner (Fig. 3). The J3CC sequence produces a structure that strongly favors only one isomer. The TWJ3 sequence, although found primarily as the other isomer, is less stable in this form with more flexibility in the junction similar to the hinge region of antibodies. This design flexibility has potential use for tethered constructs where binding domains can be directed away from the surface, preventing unfavorable steric obstruction. The relative orientation of binding heads can also be manipulated by varying the length of intervening duplex. With approximately 10 nucleotides per turn of B-form DNA, the addition of five nucleotides to the linking duplex results in a 180° rotation of aptamer heads relative to each other. In addition to heteromultivalency of the aptameric components (Fig. 1C), further functions can be incorporated into the duplex region(s) of circular aptamers. For DNA aptamers, a transcription factor decoy sequence (Fig. 1C, iii) can be employed to sequester a specific transcription factor to modulate gene expression. The result is a broad range of pleiotropic aptamer constructs produced from a relatively simple set of precursors. Quantitative stability and activity data for several multivalent anticoagulant aptamer constructs are summarized in Table I.Table IStability and activity data for multivalent circular aptamersAptamerMelting temp.Activity EC50Physical half-lifeFunctional half-lifeBufferSerumPlasmaSerumPlasmaSerumPlasma°CnmhhGS-52219.3 (2.7)107 (5)123 (6)0.25 (0.1)0.6 (0.1)cTA-122.8 (1.2)136 (9)157 (12)pTU-154.93.9 (0.9)12.4 (4.8)cTU-177.99.2 (1.5)59.9 (2.9)61.7 (5.8)7.3 (2.2)21.5 (4.2)19.0 (0.8)25.7 (2.2)pTU-253.83.6 (0.4)7.6 (2.1)cTU-277.911.8 (0.9)67.7 (5.6)77.2 (6.3)6.8 (1.1)15.4 (3.3)8.4 (1.7)10.9 (1.3)pTU-357.05.5 (0.8)8.5 (2.7)cTU-382.126.0 (2.7)154 (14)179 (5)9.4 (0.8)16.9 (2.9)9.0 (1.6)10.4 (1.2)pTT-255.15.6 (0.6)16.9 (5.4)cTT-279.87.0 (1.2)40.6 (2.0)45.0 (3.5)13.6 (3.5)32.1 (4.2)18.2 (1.0)34.5 (2.8)cTT-627.7 (3.1)158.2 (10)182 (7)cTUA-219.9 (2.4)125 (6)130 (4)cTSA-229.4 (2.4)174 (9)201 (9)cTRA-229.6 (3.0)169 (10)190 (13)cTTA-111.1 (0.6)63.9 (3.4)66.6 (3.1)cTTA-212.9 (1.5)76.9 (4.8)85.0 (6.2)cTTTT-16.1 (1.5)39.0 (1.6)44.7 (3.0)cTTTT-29.2 (0.7)55.4 (2.6)59.5 (1.3) Open table in a new tab Stability—With enhancement of stability being a primary goal of circularization, thermal melting analysis was undertaken to examine the effect of circularization upon double-headed circular aptamers (Fig. 4A, Table I). For the pTT-2, pTU-1, pTU-2, and pTU-3 constructs, ligation to their covalent circular forms produced an average increase in melting temperature of 24 ± 1 °C, a highly significant gain in thermal stability. The physical stability of circular constructs to nucleolytic degradation was then tested by incubation in blood products (Fig. 4B). The canonical GS-522 DNA aptamer displayed a physical half-life of 15 and 36 min in pooled human serum and plasma, respectively, consistent with expectations. Interestingly, even the unligated double-headed constructs showed a large improvement in serum and plasma stability compared to GS-522 with half-lives ranging between 3.6–5.6 h in serum and 7.6–16.9 h in plasma. Evidently, if termini of a linear sequence are held in a nicked duplex structure, exonuclease activity can be reduced dramatically in comparison to structures with exposed termini. When ligated, resistance to exonucleolytic degradation improved further with approximately an additional 2-fold gain in stability across the constructs tested, producing half-lives of 6.8–13.6 h and 15.4–32.1 h in serum and plasma, respectively (Fig. 4B, Table I). In serum, which lacks specific binding proteins for the cTT and cTU constructs, the somewhat higher nucleolytic stability of cTT-2 over comparable cTU constructs is indicative of the greater stability of the T aptamer head over the U head. This may be correlated to the more compact structure of the T head, restricting access of endonucleases to susceptible binding sites. Of interest for future exploration, a degree of variation in stability was observed in blood products obtained from individual donors compared with pooled serum and plasma (Fig. 4B). In addition to the physical resistance of circular aptamers to degradation, measuring the ability of constructs to retain binding activity following extended incubation in serum or plasma will provide an indication of their functional stabilities. For constructs containing a T head, thrombin-induced fibrinogen clotting can be prolonged by aptamer binding and inhibition at thrombin exosite I, giving a measure of aptamer activity. Good exponential decay curves yielding well defined half-lives were observed in all cases examined (Fig. 4C, Table I). Measured functional half-lives of double-headed constructs ranged from 5.2–9.6 h in serum (Fig. 4C) and 10.2–25.3 h in plasma (Fig. 4D), in generally good agreement with the physical stability values. For cTT-2 and cTU-1 in serum, it appears that the functional half-lives in serum (18.2 and 19.0 h, respectively) may be substantially greater than the physical half-lives (13.6 and 7.3 h, respectively), suggesting the retention of significant activity by partially degraded aptamers. From these measurements it is clear that circularization provides adequate protection for sustained aptamer activity in biological fluids. Anticoagulant Activity—To examine the effect of the number and orientation of thrombin-binding domains upon the anticoagulant activity of related multivalent circular aptamers, one or more T heads were incorporated into di-, tri- and tetravalent constructs. Anticoagulant activities, expressed as the aptamer concentration required to double the fibrinogen assay clotting time (EC50), were compared against the activity of the canonical GS-522 aptamer in buffer, serum, and plasma (Fig. 5, Table I). GS-522, which is closely related to the T head used here, displayed an EC50 of 19.3 ± 2.7 nm in buffer. In contrast, the thrombin exosite II-binding aptamer 60–18(29), from which the U head is derived, did not inhibit clotting at concentrations up to 1 μm, some 2000 times the reported Kd value for thrombin binding (20Tasset D.M. Kubik M.F. Steiner W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) (data not shown). For all constructs EC50 values were ∼5-fold higher in serum and plasma than in buffer alone, most likely because of nonspecific interactions with prevalent vascular proteins, reducing the effective aptamer concentration. Combination of T heads with other aptamer domains produced largely rationalizable results. Whereas the cTA-1 construct displayed EC50 values about the same as GS-522, consistent with its single inhibitory head, cTU-1 and cTU-2, which also possess only a single active inhibitory head, displayed EC50 values of 9.2 and 11.8 nm, respectively, in buffer (Fig. 5, Table I). On an active T head basis, these two constructs were the most potent of the set examined. This activity enhancement can be directly attributed to avidity gains caused by binding of the U domain to thrombin exosite II, although the U head is not explicitly inhibitory itself. Binding of the U domain is expected to increase the effective aptamer concentration in the vicinity of thrombin, resulting in an improved EC50. Notably, the related cTU-3 construct did not display the activity advantage of its near siblings, highlighting the importance of local aptamer-stem structure upon activity. Combination of two inhibitory T heads into the homodivalent cTT-2 construct caused EC50 to drop to 7 nm in buffer, almost a 3-fold improvement over GS-522. This improvement may arise from both an avidity gain and the greater structural integrity of the circular construct, producing additional activity beyond the simple doubling in aptamer functionality. Interestingly, cTT-6, which contains a longer internal duplex bearing a cAMP-response element transcription factor binding sequence, displayed an EC50 that was somewhat worse than GS-522 despite containing two inhibitory T heads. To generate various tri- and tetravalent constructs, two distinct three-way junction architectures were employed for the production of these higher order species. Three-headed aptamers built around a three-way junction axis"
https://openalex.org/W2111079470,"APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G) is an innate intracellular antiretroviral factor that can inhibit viral retroelements such as retroviruses and hepadnaviruses. However, it is unknown whether it can act on non-viral substrates. Retrotransposons are transposable elements that cumulatively account for about one third of the human genome. They are commonly classified in long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, which are strongly homologous to retroviruses, and non-LTR retrotransposons also known as L1 elements or LINE-1 (long interspersed nucleotide element-1) elements. Most of the L1 elements are defective and only a small number are very active in vivo, but they are responsible for nearby all of the retrotransposition in the human population. The cloning of active human L1 elements has allowed the development of tissue culture-based assays for measuring their retrotransposition potential. We used such an assay to demonstrate that APOBEC3G, which impairs the replication of exogenous retroelements, does not affect the replication of endogenous L1 retrotransposons."

These data suggest that the major mechanism for induction of apoptosis in late generation mTR-/- cells is independent of chromosome segregation and that loss of telomere function through progressive telomere shortening in the absence of telomerase leads to recognition of telomeres as DNA breaks. The telomeres consist of tandem sequence repeats bound by specific telomere proteins and are required for chromosome stability. Telomere sequence loss during replication (1Olovnikov A.M. J. Theor. Biol. 1973; 41: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar, 2Watson J.D. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 239: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) is balanced by sequence addition by telomerase. Telomerase contains an essential RNA and a catalytic protein component (3Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1985; 43: 405-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar). Telomere-binding proteins bind to the repeat sequence to help carry out telomere function. Loss of either telomere-binding proteins or telomere sequence causes telomere dysfunction, although the mechanisms by which this occurs are not yet clear. When a dominant negative version of the telomere-binding protein TRF2, which removes endogenous TRF2 from telomeres, is expressed, cells undergo chromosome fusions, cellular senescence, and apoptosis (4Karlseder J. Broccoli D. Dai Y. Hardy S. de Lange T. Science. 1999; 283: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). In contrast to this rapid effect caused by the removal of telomere-binding proteins, telomere sequence loss that occurs in the absence of telomerase generates a more gradual response. Yeast grown in the absence of functional telomerase show progressive decline in growth potential (5Lundblad V. Szostak J.W. Cell. 1989; 57: 633-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Once sufficient telomeres are critically short, cells arrest at G2/M and show increased genomic instability (6Hackett J.A. Feldser D.M. Greider C.W.

Mice that lack the RNA component of telomerase (mTR-/-) have decreased fertility, increased T cell apoptosis, and an increased number of chromosome fusions after successive interbreeding for four to six generations (9Blasco M.A. Lee H.-W.

The mTR-/- mice revealed that telomeres play two different roles in tumorigenesis. Short telomeres trigger cell death that may contribute to reduction in tumor progression (11Greenberg R. Chin L.

Cell. 1999; 97: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar); on the other hand, short telomeres also lead to an increase in tumor formation in some mouse models (12Artandi S.E.

Broken ends are recognized and repaired by specific proteins including DNA-PKcs, Ku, the MRX complex (MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1/Xrs2), RPA, ATM, ATR, ATRIP, and others (reviewed in Ref. 17Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar). Unrepaired DNA breaks can lead to chromosome instability (reviewed in Ref. 18Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Thus, when cells encounter irreparable damage, they may undergo programmed cell death to protect the organism. Failure to eliminate damaged cells may result in chromosome rearrangements, often leading to further instability (reviewed in Refs. 17Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar and 19Rich T. Allen R.L. Wyllie A.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). One of the earliest events at the site of DNA damage is the phosphorylation of histone variant H2AX, γ-H2AX (20Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4203) Google Scholar). The presence of γ-H2AX provides the platform for other damage proteins such as p53BP1, Mre11, and Brca1 to localize to the break site (21Celeste A. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Kruhlak M.J. Pilch D.R. Staudt D.W. Lee A. Bonner R.F. Bonner W.M. Nussenzweig A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of telomere function has been proposed to mimic a DNA double-stranded break. However, the relationship between telomere function and the DNA damage response pathway is complex. A major role of the telomere is to distinguish natural chromosome ends from DNA breaks. At the same time, many proteins involved in DNA damage response such as Ku, MRX complex, and DNA-PKcs normally localize to telomeres (22Hsu H.L. Gilley D. Blackburn E.H. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12454-12458Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 23Zhu X.D. Kuster B. Mann M. Petrini J.H. de Lange T. Nat.

In yeast, when an endogenous DNA break is created, some of the telomere-bound DNA repair proteins relocalize from the telomere to the DNA break site. In addition, the cells that are deleted for these damage recognition/repair genes often have altered telomere length (25Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P.

When dysfunctional telomeres are generated either through removal of telomere-binding proteins or through telomere shortening in the absence of telomerase, DNA damage pathways are activated. Yeast with critically short telomeres activate DNA damage checkpoints and cells arrest at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (7Enomoto S. Glowczewski L. Berman J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2626-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8IJpma A. Greider C.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 987-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 30Johnson F.B.

Overexpression of dominant negative TRF2 in human cells triggers p53- and ATM-dependent apoptosis (4Karlseder J. Broccoli D. Dai Y. Hardy S. de Lange T. Science. 1999; 283: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Short telomeres trigger a p53 response in late generation mTR-/- mice (15Chin L. Artandi S. Shen Q. Tam S. Lee S.-L. Gottlieb G. Greider C.W. DePinho R.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 527-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), and cells with short telomeres have an enhanced sensitivity to ionizing radiation (31Wong K.K. Chang S. Weiler S.R. Ganesan S. Chaudhuri J. Zhu C. Artandi S.E. Rudolph K.L. Gottlieb G.J. Chin L. Alt F.W. DePinho R.A. Nat.

Thus, although it is clear that dysfunctional telomeres send a signal similar to DNA damage, the mechanism that recognizes telomere dysfunction is not clear. The increased apoptosis in late generation mTR-/- cells may be due to recognition of critically short telomeres as double-stranded DNA breaks. Alternatively, it may be due to chromosome fusions and subsequent breakage of dicentric chromosomes. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we studied apoptosis in late generation mTR-/- T lymphocytes. We found that apoptosis was independent of M phase progression, suggesting that the breakage of dicentric chromosomes is not a major factor in triggering apoptosis. In addition, we found that the damage marker γ-H2AX localized to the telomere in late generation mTR-/- cells. Our results suggest that critically short telomeres are recognized directly as DNA breaks. Mice—Two independent lines of mTR-/- mice were used. Line 1 used for spectral karyotyping analysis was 60% C57BL/6, 37.5% 129/Sv, and 2.5% SJL as described (9Blasco M.A. Lee H.-W. Hande P.M. Samper E. Lansdorp P.M. DePinho R.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). Line 2 used for T cell and MEF 1The abbreviations used are: MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; ConA, concanavalin A; IL, interleukin; TUNEL, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine; CFSE, carboxy-fluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester; FISH, fluorescent in situ hybridization. studies was derived from line 1 by backcrossing to C57BL/6J as described (33Hemann M.T. Strong M.A. Hao L.Y. Greider C.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 67-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and T Lymphocyte Purification—To purify T cells, splenocytes were isolated through negative selection with T cell enrichment gravity flow through kit (13031; StemCell Technologies). The purified T cells were stimulated with 4 μg of ConA (Sigma) and 20 units of IL-2 (Roche Applied Science) at 2 million cells/ml of medium. TUNEL Analysis—Isolated T cells were stimulated with ConA and IL-2 in culture for 48 h prior to TUNEL analysis. The cells were analyzed by an in situ cell death detection kit (1 684 795; Roche Applied Science). Spectral Karyotyping—Spectral karyotyping was performed on late generation mTR-/- splenocyte metaphases as described (34Liyanage M. Coleman A. du Manoir S. Veldman T. McCormack S. Dickson R.B. Barlow C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Janz S. Wienberg J. Ferguson-Smith M.A. Schrock E. Ried T. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The splenocytes were cultured and stimulated with 1 mg of lipopolysaccharide (Sigma), 400 μg of ConA, and 200 units of IL-2 for 48 h. The cells were arrested in colcemid for 1 h and then swelled in 4% KCl for 4 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed six times in 3:1 methanol:aceitic acid fixative. The metaphase spreads were hybridized and analyzed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Spectral Imaging). Cell Staining and FACS Analysis—Unfixed cells were washed with PBS and stained prior to FACS analysis. For cell apoptosis analysis, Annexin V-Alexa 568 was used as suggested by the vendor (1985485; Roche Applied Science), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled anti-BrdU (556028 PharMingen) was used to detect S phase progression of the cells. Cell cycle analysis was carried out by washing cells with PBS once and then incubating in staining solution (in 10 ml of PBS with 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg of RNase A, and 50 mg of propidium iodide) for 30 min in the dark. For CFSE (C1157 Molecular Probe) analysis, T cells were washed once with PBS and then resuspended at 4 million cells/ml in PBS and stained with 2 μm CFSE for 8 min in the dark at room temperature. 5 ml of culture medium was then added to the cells and incubated for 5 min in dark. Stained cells were washed three times with PBS and then cultured at 2–4 million cells/ml of culture medium with ConA and IL-2 in the dark. Cytospin Preparation and Immunostaining—The cells were washed once with PBS and then treated with 0.075 m KCl for 2 min, and the metaphases were prepared by spinning cells on to slides in a cytospin centrifuge (Thermo Shandon Cytospin 3) at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The cells attached to the slides were fixed with methanol or ethanol for 1 h at –20 °C. The cells were stained with 1:4000 γ-H2AX antibody (16193; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or 1:400 p53BP1 (a gift from Dr. Junjie Chen). A secondary antibody was used at 1:10,000 Cy3 or 1:1000 fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson Immunoresearch). Both primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in KCM (120 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.1% Triton X-100). For staining with both γ-H2AX and telomere FISH, the cells were treated with RSB buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) for 10 min at 37 °C, then cytospun at 2000 rpm for 5 s, and then fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 10 min. The slides were washed with PBS and treated with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in PBS. Because cytospun metaphases often contain partial metaphase chromosome sets, we quantitated the average number of chromosomes/spread and found no significant difference between wild type and late generation mTR-/- (p > 0.05). γ-H2AX signals were scored first before telomere FISH. Immunoblot Analysis—The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm sodium chloride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (1836153; Roche Applied Science) and 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1(P2850; Sigma) after 48 h of stimulation. The antibodies used were: anti-Actin (A2066, 1:2000; Sigma), anti-Ser15 phospho-p53 (9284, 1:1000; Cell Signaling), anti-Ser317 phospho-Chk1 (A300–163A, 1:500; Bethyl), anti-Bax (2772, 1:2000; Cell Signaling), and anti-cleaved Caspase 3 (9661, 1:1000; Cell Signaling). The band intensity was normalized to the actin level with the ImageGauge program. Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts—MEFs were generated as described (9Blasco M.A. Lee H.-W. Hande P.M. Samper E. Lansdorp P.M. DePinho R.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). The metaphases were generated from passage 3 MEFs from wild type and mTR-/- as described above. Late Generation mTR-/- Mice T cells Undergo Apoptosis in Response to Mitogen—To examine the role of short telomeres in apoptosis of lymphocytes, we stimulated late generation mTR-/- mouse T cells in vitro for 48 h and stained with annexin V to identify apoptotic cells and with propidium iodide to determine DNA content. Late generation mTR-/- T cells showed an increase in apoptotic cells compared with age-matched wild type cells (Fig. 1A) in agreement with a previous report (35Lee H.-W. Blasco M.A. Gottlieb G.J. Horner J.W. Greider C.W. DePinho R.A. Nature. 1998; 392: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Three independent experiments with mTR-/- mice showed a consistent 2-fold increase in the total number of annexin V-positive mTR-/- T cells compared with wild type. After 48 h in culture without stimulation, both wild type and mTR-/- T cell cultures showed a high level of apoptosis (36Lenardo M. Chan K.M. Hornung F. McFarland H. Siegel R. Wang J. Zheng L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 221-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). At 48 h post stimulation, the cells had identifiable G1, S, and G2 peaks typical of proliferating cells (Fig. 1B); thus, cells were not entering apoptosis because of a lack of stimulation. The unstimulated cultures exhibit a predominant G1/G0 peak and substantial sub-G1/G0 peak that represents the apoptotic cells (Fig. 1B). There was an increase in the sub-G1/G0 peak in stimulated mTR-/- culture compared with wild type T cells (Fig. 1B), consistent with the increase apoptosis observed by annexin V staining (Fig. 1A). To further examine the apoptosis in T cells, we quantitated the number of TUNEL-positive cells in wild type and mTR-/- mice. 26% of the mTR-/- T cells were TUNEL-positive cells, whereas only 14% of T cells from wild type cultures were positive. To test whether this increase in apoptosis results from increased DNA damage response in mTR-/- cells, we used Western analysis to examine the level of several markers of DNA damage response. We found an increase in phosphorylated form of Chk1 in mTR-/- T cells (Fig. 3D). We further found a 2-fold increase in p53 phosphorylated at serine 15, cleaved caspase 3, and BAX in mTR-/- protein extract (data not shown). T Cell Apoptosis Is Independent of Chromosome Segregation—To determine whether the apoptosis and induction of a DNA damage response in late generation mTR-/- T cells was due to short telomeres or to chromosome breakage at metaphase, we examined the cell cycle dependence of apoptosis. When mTR-/- T cells were grown in the presence of BrdU for 48 h, 89% the cells were both BrdU- and annexin V-positive. This result indicates that annexin V-positive cells in the late generation mTR-/- culture have replicated at least once (Fig. 2A). Telomere dysfunction causes end-to-end fusion in mTR-/- cells (9Blasco M.A. Lee H.-W. Hande P.M. Samper E. Lansdorp P.M. DePinho R.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar); therefore, the apoptosis seen may be the consequence of the breakage of dicentric chromosomes during segregation. To examine this possibility, we determined whether apoptosis in these cells requires the completion of M phase. T lymphocytes from wild type and late generation mTR-/- mice were first stimulated to cycle and then arrested with colcemid, a drug that inhibits spindle formation. The initial stimulation was required to distinguish those cells in the population that were capable of dividing initially from those that were not. If the increased level of apoptosis in mTR-/- cells requires chromosome segregation and breakage of dicentrics, then colcemid arrest should reduce the overall number of annexin V-positive cells. The percentage of annexin V-positive cells in the mTR-/- cultures did not decrease in the presence of colcemid in three independent experiments (Fig. 2C). To test the completeness of the colcemid block, we used both FACS analysis and CFSE staining. Colcemid arrest increased the number of G2/M cells by 2.5-fold for both wild type and mTR-/- T cells (Fig. 2B). CFSE is a cytoplasmic fluorescence dye that reduces its intensity by half every time the cell divides. We used this dye to determine the number of cell cycles that cells completed after stimulation (Fig. 2D, black bars). When cells were arrested with colcemid from 36 to 42 h after stimulation, the percentage of cells that had undergone four divisions decreased 2–4-fold in wild type and mTR-/- cells (Fig. 2D). Although FACS analysis and CFSE staining showed an efficient colcemid arrest, there was no comparable decrease in the level of apoptosis in the arrested cell population. This indicates that breakage of dicentric chromosomes at mitosis is not the predominant mechanism that leads to apoptosis in mTR-/- cells. If apoptosis in mTR-/- cells was due to the accumulation of chromosome breaks in the cell divisions prior to arrest, we would expect to see translocations indicative of breakage, fusion, and bridge cycles. To address this possibility, we examined chromosome structure using spectral karyotyping. In agreement with previous reports (9Blasco M.A. Lee H.-W. Hande P.M. Samper E. Lansdorp P.M. DePinho R.A. Greider C.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar), chromosome fusions were seen in the metaphase spreads from mTR-/- T cells (Table I). However, although fusions were seen, only 3 of 1100 late generation mTR-/- metaphases showed translocations. Because cycles of breakage, fusion, and bridge formation would lead to chromosome translocations, the low level of such rearrangements suggests that the accumulation of broken chromosomes through breakage, fusion, and bridge in the first few cell cycles is not the major mechanism that triggers apoptosis in mTR-/- cells.Table IKaryotype analysis of splenocytes from late generation mTR-/- miceMetaphases examinedTranslocationsaTranslocation scored through spectral karyotype analysisFusions968bTotal number of metaphases from BL/6 and BL/6 129 mix background strains3193cRef. 33162dTotal number of metaphases from BL/6 and 129S6/SvEvTac mix background0100eRef. 48a Translocation scored through spectral karyotype analysisb Total number of metaphases from BL/6 and BL/6 129 mix background strainsc Ref. 33Hemann M.T.

We examined whether phosphorylated H2AX, called γ-H2AX, one of the earliest modifications that occur at sites of double-stranded DNA breaks, is localized to telomeres. As a positive control we irradiated wild type cells with γ radiation, and these irradiated cells showed dosage-dependent γ-H2AX staining of metaphase chromosomes (Fig. 3A). We then generated metaphases from mature T cells from wild type and late generation mTR-/- mice. γ-H2AX staining was observed near the termini of chromosomes in the mTR-/- cells (Fig. 3B). We quantitated the γ-H2AX staining in wild type and late generation mTR-/- T cells from three independent mice. The chromosome termini from late generation mTR-/- T cells showed more γ-H2AX staining than wild type T cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3C). The low level of γ-H2AX staining observed on wild type chromosome ends may represent a low level of dysfunctional telomeres in wild type cells or may be due to telomere proximal signal that cannot be distinguished from telomeres in this assay. γ-H2AX Staining of Short Telomeres in MEFs—To test whether short telomeres from other cell types are also bound by γ-H2AX, we generated independent MEF lines from late generation mTR-/- and wild type animals. Interphase MEFs showed an increase of γ-H2AX and p53BP1 foci staining in late generation mTR-/- compared with wild type cells (data not shown). MEF metaphases were stained for γ-H2AX. Late generation mTR-/- MEFs showed a higher frequency of γ-H2AX staining at telomeres than wild type MEFs (Fig. 4). To determine whether the increase in γ-H2AX foci in late generation mTR-/- MEFs was specific to telomeres, we quantitated the γ-H2AX signal that was not telomeric. The ratio of telomeric signal to nontelomeric signal was 2.7-fold higher in late generation mTR-/- MEFs compared with wild type MEFs (Table II). This result further suggests that γ-H2AX is localized to short telomeres. The chromosome preparations from MEF cultures were more easily resolved and had a better morphology than those isolated from T cells. Thus, for technical reasons, we cannot compare the absolute number of γ-H2AX-positive telomeres in mTR-/- T cells versus MEFs.Table IITelomeric and nontelomeric γ-H2AX staining in MEFsNumber of chromosomesaTotal number of chromosomes analyzed for each genotypeNontelomeric γ-H2AX signalbPercent represents nontelomeric γ-H2AX signal divided by total γ-H2AX signalTelomeric γ-H2AX signalcPercent represents telomeric γ-H2AX signal divided by total γ-H2AX signalRatiodRatio represents telomeric γ-H2AX signal divided by nontelomeric γ-H2AX signalWild type23769 (43%)12 (57%)1.3mTR-/-246831 (22%)110 (78%)3.5a Total number of chromosomes analyzed for each genotypeb Percent represents nontelomeric γ-H2AX signal divided by total γ-H2AX signalc Percent represents telomeric γ-H2AX signal divided by total γ-H2AX signald Ratio represents telomeric γ-H2AX signal divided by nontelomeric γ-H2AX signal Open table in a new tab H2AX Signals Localize to Short Telomeres—The shortest telomeres in the population show no telomere signal in FISH and are referred to as signal free ends (33Hemann M.T. Strong M.A. Hao L.Y. Greider C.W. Cell. 2001; 107: 67-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Although telomere dysfunction may occur on telomeres that contain some telomere signal by FISH, telomeres that lack signals are more likely to be recognized as dysfunctional. To determine whether the γ-H2AX-positive chromosome ends correlated with short telomeres, we combined telomere FISH analysis with γ-H2AX staining. γ-H2AX-positive spreads were probed with telomere FISH to identify signal free ends. 67% of signal free ends from late generation mTR-/- cells showed co-localization with γ-H2AX, whereas wild type cells did not have signal free ends (Table III). This suggests that the shortest telomeres in the population are more likely to be recognized as DNA damage.Table IIICo-staining of γ-H2AX on SFE in mTR-/- cells SFE, signal free ends.SFEγ-H2AX on SFEγ-H2AX with signal%%%mTR-/-a312 total chromosomes scored. 95% confidence interval does not overlap with wild type by exact binomial confidence interval test1.91.27.7Wild typeb194 total chromosomes scored005.7a 312 total chromosomes scored. 95% confidence interval does not overlap with wild type by exact binomial confidence interval testb 194 total chromosomes scored Open table in a new tab Loss of telomere function has been suggested to mimic a double-stranded DNA break. Dysfunctional telomeres may cause rearrangements through homologous recombination and end-to-end chromosome fusions (33Hemann M.T. Strong M.A. Hao L.Y. Greider C.W.

Nature. 1998; 392: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Because chromosome breaks also cause arrest and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 38Friedberg E.C. DNA Repair. 1st Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1985Google Scholar), damage induction caused by telomere dysfunction may be a secondary effect of breakage of dicentric chromosomes. In human cells that have lost telomere function through overexpression of dominant negative TRF2, apoptosis is not dependent on the S phase, suggesting that breakage of dicentrics is not responsible for apoptosis in these cells (4Karlseder J. Broccoli D. Dai Y. Hardy S. de Lange T. Science. 1999; 283: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). In this study we tested whether a different form of telomere dysfunction, generated by telomere shortening in the absence of telomerase, is due to recognition of telomere damage directly or due to breakage of dicentric chromosomes in cycling mitotic cells. Mitosis Is Not Required for Apoptosis in Late Generation mTR-/- T Cells—We had previously reported that meiotic spermatogonia cells apoptosis is not due to chromosome breakage in telomerase knockout mouse (10Hemann M.T. Rudolph K.L. Strong M.A. DePinho R.A. Chin L. Greider C.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Here we found that in mitotic cells, the disruption of the spindle did not reduce the apoptosis in late generation mTR-/- T cells. Because colcemid blocks microtubule polymerization, it is unlikely that the integrity of the chromosomes was compromised. Furthermore, the low fraction of metaphases that had translocations cannot explain the number of apoptotic cells observed. This suggests that the repeated breakage of fused chromosomes is unlikely to be responsible for the apoptosis in the late generation mTR-/- cells. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that some cells undergo apoptosis in response to chromosome breaks, although this does not seem to be the predominant pathway. Short Telomeres and DNA Breaks Illicit Similar Response—Later generation mTR-/- mice and cells show an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (31Wong K.K. Chang S. Weiler S.R. Ganesan S.

Med. 2000; 192: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), suggesting that there is an additive effect of short telomeres and double-stranded DNA breaks. Cells with only a few short telomeres may not show a cellular response or may adapt to this low level of damage (39Sandell L.L. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 40Lee S.E. Moore J.K. Holmes A. Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. Haber J.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). However, when the overall level of damage increases above a threshold through induction of double-stranded breaks, a cellular response is triggered. This suggests that the pathways responding to telomere dysfunction and DNA breaks overlap. Although the checkpoint pathways that are activated by DNA breaks and telomere dysfunction are similar, it is not clear whether there might be proteins that specifically recognize telomere damage. Many different proteins that respond to DNA double-stranded breaks including Ku, DNA-PKcs, Nbs1, and Mre11 also associate with telomeres (22Hsu H.L. Gilley D. Blackburn E.H. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl.

Science. 1998; 280: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), We chose to examine γ-H2AX, which is thought to be a very early event in damage signaling. The localization of γ-H2AX to dysfunctional telomeres suggests that pathways for signaling damage are conserved. In addition to these conserved proteins, there may be specific proteins not yet discovered that distinguish the signal sent from a dysfunctional telomere and the signal sent from a DNA break. It would be interesting to determine whether the response to telomere dysfunction may be different in subtle ways from the response to double-stranded breaks. Different Types of Telomere Dysfunction Signal DNA Damage—Telomere dysfunction is a term often used to describe many different physical changes to telomeres. Loss of telomere function can be brought about in several ways including alteration of telomere-binding proteins (4Karlseder J. Broccoli D. Dai Y. Hardy S. de Lange T.

A recent study showed that telomere shortening in primary human cells leads to binding of γ-H2AX, p53BP1, and other damage recognition proteins on telomeres (44d'Adda di Fagagna F. Reaper P.M.

In another study interphase human cells overexpressing dominant negative TRF2 also showed localization of γ-H2AX as well as other DNA damage response proteins to interphase telomere foci (44d'Adda di Fagagna F.

Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1549-1556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Together with these two reports, our study further supports the idea that when telomeres become dysfunctional, either through removal of binding proteins or the shortening in the absence of telomerase, they are recognized as DNA breaks directly. Despite the similarity in the downstream response, the fundamental molecular components of telomere function that are disrupted by dominant negative TRF2 and loss of telomerase may be different. Telomere shortening may lead to a loss of binding sites for essential proteins or may physically disrupt the ability of telomeres to form T loops (46Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of dominant negative TRF2 removes endogenous TRF2 and its binding partners from the telomere (4Karlseder J. Broccoli D. Dai Y. Hardy S. de Lange T. Science. 1999; 283: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar) and also TRF2 interacts with damage response pathways (23Zhu X.D. Kuster B. Mann M. Petrini J.H. de Lange T. Nat.

Although chromosome fusion and apoptosis occur in response to both methods of telomere dysfunction, the pathways that respond may differ in subtle ways that could have profound cellular consequences. It will be interesting to decipher the similarities and differences in how cells respond to different kinds of telomere dysfunction.

Insights into their synthesis in metazoans are reported here through molecular studies in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Two I(1,4,5)P3 kinase gene products are implicated in initiating catabolism of these important IP regulators. We find dmIpk2 is a nucleocytoplasmic 6-/3-kinase that converts I(1,4,5)P3 to I(1,3,4,5,6)P5, and harbors 5-kinase activity toward I(1,3,4,6)P4, and dmIP3K is a 3-kinase that converts I(1,4,5)P3 to I(1,3,4,5)P4. To assess their relative roles in the cellular production of IPs we utilized complementation analysis, RNA interference, and overexpression studies. Heterologous expression of dmIpk2, but not dmIP3K, in ipk2 mutant yeast recapitulates phospholipase C-dependent cellular synthesis of IP6. Knockdown of dmIpk2 in Drosophila S2 cells and transgenic flies results in a significant reduction of IP6 levels; whereas depletion of dmIP3K, either α or β isoforms or both, does not decrease IP6 synthesis but instead increases its production, possibly by expanding I(1,4,5)P3 pools. Similarly, knockdown of an I(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase results in significant increase in dmIpk2/dmIpk1-dependent IP6 synthesis. IP6 production depends on the I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 2-kinase activity of dmIpk1 and is increased in transgenic flies overexpressing dmIpk2. Our studies reveal that phosphatase and kinase regulation of I(1,4,5)P3 metabolic pools directly impinge on higher IP synthesis, and that the major route of IP6 synthesis depends on the activities of dmIpk2 and dmIpk1, but not dmIP3K, thereby challenging the role of IP3K in the genesis of higher IP messengers.

Two key differences between the proposed metazoan and defined yeast pathways are: 1) the initiation step in the synthesis of IP6 occurs through an I(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase (IP3K) and not Ipk2, and 2) the requirement of an I(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase, orthologs of which have not yet been found in the budding yeast genome. The cloning of plant and metazoan Ipk2 (also referred to as inositol phosphate “multi-kinase”; IPMK) and Ipk1, both of which were found to possess similar activities as their yeast counterparts, has raised the possibility that synthesis of higher IP messengers in metazoans may occur similarly to that in yeast (18Stevenson-Paulik J.

Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified orthologous kinase and phosphatase genes in the Drosophila that may contribute to higher IP synthesis in metazoans. Detailed biochemical analysis was used to characterize the I(1,4,5)P3 kinases proposed to initiate the first phosphorylation step of higher IP production, and subsequent use of RNA interference in culture cells and transgenic flies provided gene-specific knockdowns of each activity to dissect the IP synthesis pathway. We find that the synthesis of IP5 and IP6 in the fruit fly is dependent on Ipk2 and Ipk1, but not IP3K, 5-phosphatase or I(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase activities. Our data provide a novel molecular basis for higher IP production in a metazoan and support a role for Ipk2 as a key gatekeeper for activating this important signaling pathway.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Construction—Drosophila EST SD14726, SD19941 were obtained from Research Genetics and used as templates for amplification of dmIpk2 and dmIP3Kβ, respectively.

PCR products were then cut with the following enzymes and ligated in-frame with the pUNI10 Lox recombination site or into the pGEX-KG GST expression vector. dmIP3Kβ: SmaI and XbaI (for pUNI10 used SmaI and HpaI), dmIpk2: EcoRI and SalI. pGEX-KG plasmids were transformed into DH5α-competent cells. pUNI10 constructs were recombined into a pRS314 host vector containing Lox site, MYC3, TRP1, CEN, and a copper inducible promoter (CUP1). The recombined plasmid was transformed into ipk2Δ and ipk2Δ ipk1Δ yeast strains using standard yeast transformation techniques.Bacterial Expression of dmIpk2 and dmIP3Kβ—For recombinant protein expression, transformed Escherichia coli (DH5α) were grown at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.6 and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were recovered by centrifugation at 4 °C, resuspended in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and lysed with four passes through a cell cracker (a high shear fluid processing system for cell rupture, Microfluidics Corp.). Lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g. The GST fusion proteins were purified over glutathione Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were eluted from the glutathione Sepharose using 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm glutathione. For antibody production GST-dmIpk2 was cleaved with thrombin protease according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Purified protein was injected into rabbits and antiserum was isolated (BIOSOURCE). dmIpk2 protein was detected using standard Western blotting techniques.Inositol Phosphate Kinase Assay—All unlabeled IPs were purchased from Cell Signals, Inc. Tritiated IPs were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. I(1,4,5,6)[32P]P4 was generated using 500 ng of recombinant Arabidopsis Ipk2 in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 μm I(1,4,5)P3, and trace amounts of [32P]ATP. To generate I(1,3,4,6)[32P]P4, unlabeled 5.0 μm I(1,4,5)P3 was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 7.5 μg dmIP3K and trace amounts of [γ-32P]ATP in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 to create I(1,3,4,5)-[32P]P4. Human Type I 5-phosphatase (900 ng) was then added to this reaction and incubated at 37 °C to produce I(1,3,4)[32P]P3. The I(1,3,4)[32P]P3 product was incubated at 37 °C in a reaction containing 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 14 mm phosphocreatine, phosphocreatine kinase, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 600 ng of human type I 5-phosphatase and 200 ng of 5/6 kinase (a kind gift from Steve Shears) to yield I(1,3,4,6)[32P]P4. Kinase assays were carried out essentially as described by Stevenson-Paulik et al. (18Stevenson-Paulik J. Odom A.R. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42711-42718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Kinetic Assays—The Km and Vmax of the enzymatic interaction between dmIpk2 and dmIP3Kβ, and various substrates were determined. The following reaction mixture was prepared: 250 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% BSA, 2 mm ATP, 100 mm MgCl2, 80 cpm/μl radiolabeled substrate, 10 ng dmIpk2 or dmIP3Kβ, and various concentrations of unlabeled substrate in a 20-μl reaction volume. The reaction was stopped by the addition of HPLC buffer or 1.0 m HCl. 10 mm NH4H2PO4 (pH 3.5) was then added to the reaction and analyzed by Partisphere strong anion exchange HPLC. The kinase kinetics was calculated from measured changes in the substrate area under the curve (AUC) peak.RNAi in S2 Cultured Cells—Drosophila ESTs SD14726, SD19941, RE1770, and GH07317 were obtained from Research Genetics and used as templates for amplification of dmIpk2, dmIP3Kβ, dm5PtaseI, and dmIpk1, respectively. dmIP3Kα template was amplified using genomic DNA prepared from S2 cells. FTZ (dsRNA control) template was amplified from a cDNA library provided by Rick Fehon. Templates for dsRNA synthesis were made by PCR using the EST clones as templates and the following primers. dmIpk2: 5′-TTAAT ACGAC TCACT ATAGG GAGAA CAGGT TGCGG GTCAC ACATT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTAAT ACGAC TCACT ATAGG GAGAT GCAGC TGGCG GAGTA CTTCC-3′ (reverse), dmIP3Kβ: 5′-TTAAT ACGAC TCACT ATAGG GAGAA CCGGC AAGAA GCAGA GCTCC-3′(forward) and 5′-TTAAT ACGAC TCACT ATAGG GAGAC GCTCT TCTTG ATGCC CTCGA-3′ (reverse), dm5Ptase: 5′-TTAAT ACGAC TCACT ATAGG GAGAG GATGT GTTTC TGGTC ACGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTAAT ACGAC TCACT ATAGG GAGAG GTATG AACTA GGGCT CTTCT G-3′ (reverse), (dsRNA control) Ftz: 5′-TTAAT ACGAC TCACT ATAGG GAGAG CCGAC AACAT GAACA TGTAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTAAT ACGAC TCACT ATAGG GAGAC CATTC TTCAG CTTCT GCGTC-3′ (reverse), dmIpk1: 5′-TTAAT ACGAC TCACT ATAGG GAGAG GAGCA GCGAG GAGTG GTGGA G-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTAAT ACGAC TCACT ATAGG GAGAC GTTTA TCCAG AATCT ATCGT C-3′ (reverse), dmIP3Kβ: 5′-TTAAT ACGAC TCACT ATAGG GAGAG ACTCA AGCAG CTATG GAAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTAAT ACGAC TCACT ATAGG GAGAG CTGCA CTTGA CACTT GAAAC G-3′ (reverse). Primers all contain T7 promoters on their 5′-ends. Transcription reactions were carried out using the DNA templates with the MEGAscript T7 transcription kit (Ambion). The RNA was purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation and resuspended in DEPC-treated H2O to a final concentration of 3 μg/μl. RNA strands were then annealed by heating to 70 °C for 30 min and cooling to room temperature overnight.S2 cells were propagated in Schneider's Drosophila media (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum dialyzed and heat inactivated (Hyclone) and 10 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in Drosophila-SFM (Invitrogen) to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and plated into 6-well plates (1× 106 cells/well). 15 μg of dsRNA was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were then supplemented with 2 ml of Schneider's Drosophila media/fetal bovine serum/Penn/Strep and incubated for 4–6 days at 25 °C. In the case that RNAi knockdowns were extended over a period of 15 days, dsRNA-treated cells were counted after 8 days, split, and again treated with dsRNA as described above.Northern Analysis of S2 Cells—Probes for Northern analysis were made using DNA templates for dsRNA as described above. DNA templates were then incubated with 32P-labeled dCTP and the random-primed DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. S2 cells were treated with dsRNA for 6 days as described above. 3 ml of cells were then recovered by centrifugation at 4 °C. Total RNA was then isolated using the Qiagen RNA purification system according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was then separated on a 2% agarose gel and transferred to hybond nitrocellulose paper (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA probe was then hybridized in ExpressHyb hybridization solution according to the man ufacturer's instructions (Clontech).Kinase Assays on S2 Cell Extracts—dsRNA-treated cells (3 ml) were recovered by centrifugation at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture. The cells were lysed with ten half-second pulses, three times on a setting of 3 using a Branson sonifier and diluted to a stock concentration of 1 mg/ml. Activity assays were carried out in 20-μl volumes with 5 μg of S2 extract, 10 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.25 units/μl creatine phosphokinase, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 5 μm inositol polyphosphate, and 10,000–20,000 cpm labeled inositol polyphosphate. Labeled inositol polyphosphates were [3H]I(1,4,5)P3, I(1,4,5,6)[32P]P4, and 32P-I(1,3,4,5,6)P5. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for various times from 5 to 200 min. Reactions were stopped with the addition of 0.5 n HCl and analyzed by HPLC or TLC.In Vivo Labeling of S2 Cells and Saccharomyces cerevisiae—S2 cells were treated with dsRNA as described above or no dsRNA as a control. On day four or thirteen, [3H]inositol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) was added to the media to a final concentration of 80 μCi/ml. Cells were then incubated for 2 days at 25 °C. On day 6 or 15, the cells were recovered by centrifugation and washed once in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.). Yeast cultures were incubated in minimal media lacking tryptophan and 150 μm CuSO4 for 2 days at 30 °C for 2 days. [3H]Inositol was added to a final concentration of 80 μCi/ml. Soluble inositol polyphosphates were harvested and analyzed by HPLC using a Partisphere SAX strong-anion exchange column as described previously (7York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).Construction and Analysis of Fly Lines—Df(2L)BCS16 was obtained from the Bloomington stock center. NleΔ8 was a kind gift from S. Cohen (27Royet J. Bouwmeester T. Cohen S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7351-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For dmIpk2 RNAi, we obtained the pWIZ vector from Richard Carthew to construct a transgene containing inverted repeats of a 200-bp region of dmIpk2 separated by a 74-bp intron spacer (28Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Methods. 2003; 30: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The following primers were used to generate the dmIpk2 region containing XbaI restriction sites on both ends: 5′-CTAGT CTAGA ACGAC TATTC AAGAC TGGCT G-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTACT CTAGA TCATC ATCGG TGGAG TATTG-3′ (reverse). The PCR product was then subcloned into the pWIZ vector using AvrII and NheI sites and checked for proper orientation. For expression of FLAG-dmIpk2 we cloned the dmIpk2 coding region into pBSIISK with sequence for an N-terminal FLAG epitope inserted (a kind gift from Rick Fehon). The following primers were used to PCR dmIpk2 from the EST containing SmaI and HindIII restriction sites: 5′-TCTGG ACCCG GGATG GCCAA GAGTG ATCAGG AG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGAGC T CGA A AGCTT TCATC GGTGG AGTAT TGATT G-3′ (reverse). The FLAG epitope and dmIpk2 were then subcloned into pP[UAST]. pWIZ-Ipk2 and pP[UAST]-FLAG-dmIpk2 constructs and a P-element transposase plasmid were injected in w1118 embryos and germ line transformants were selected with the w+ marker (29Beall E.L. Mahoney M.B. Rio D.C. Genetics. 2002; 162: 217-227PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygous w+ lines were generated with standard balancer chromosomes. For fly labeling, 3–6-day-old adult males were fed a 5% sucrose solution containing 500 μCi/ml [3H]inositol for 4 days. 2B. Elliot and V. Bankaitis, personal communication. Soluble IPs were extracted as described above.Salivary Gland Stains—FLAG-dmIpk2 expression was induced by crossing p[FLAG-dmIpk2]/cyo to Gal4 expressing flies under the actin promoter (P[FLAG-dmIpk2]/Actin). Salivary glands were dissected from 3rd instar larvae and fixed in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) and 3.7% paraformaldehyde for fifteen minutes. Glands were then washed in PBS-T and blocked overnight in PBS-T + 5% goat serum. Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was added to the blocking buffer and incubated for one hour with agitation. Salivary glands were washed three times with PBS-T. An anti-mouse cy3 secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was incubated with the salivary glands for 1 h. The glands were washed, stained with DAPI (Sigma), and mounted with ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes). Glands were visualized with a Zeiss Axioscope equipped with Metamorph software.RESULTSIdentification of Drosophila Genes Involved in Inositol Polyphosphate Synthesis—In this study, we utilize the tractable fly model system to study mechanisms of higher IP synthesis in metazoans. Initially, our analysis focused on two I(1,4,5)P3 kinase-dependent IP synthesis models, one derived from genetic yeast studies and one proposed from biochemical characterization of pathways metazoans (Fig. 1A). The initiation steps for each model are distinct and require I(1,4,5)P3 kinase activities encoded by separate gene products. Ipk2 functions in yeast as a dual specificity kinase that converts I(1,4,5)P3 to I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and in metazoans IP3K phosphorylates I(1,4,5)P3 to I(1,3,4,5)P4. Of interest, the two I(1,4,5)P3 kinases are members of a small family of IP kinases that share an evolutionary ancestor and common amino acid motifs, but possess divergent substrate specificities (6York J.D. Bradshaw R.A. Dennis E.A. Handbook of Cell Signaling, Volume 2. 2. Elsevier Science, 2003: 229-232Google Scholar, 8Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The second and third steps of the pathway proposed in metazoans require inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, which converts I(1,3,4,5)P4 to I(1,3,4)P3, and I(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase that produces I(1,3,4,6)P4 (30Majerus P.W. Kisseleva M.V. Norris F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10669-10672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The fourth step in the metazoan pathway is proposed to be accomplished through the 5-kinase activity of Ipk2, which produces I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 from the I(1,3,4,6)P4 substrate. The last step for IP6 synthesis in both yeast and metazoans requires Ipk1, an I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 2-kinase.In order to identify various kinase and phosphatase members of these pathways, we performed in silico searches (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/and www.flybase.net/blast/) of the Drosophila genome using hallmark motifs for each gene product. Four predicted gene products were found that harbor the IP kinase motif PXXXDXKXG: CG13688 (PcvmDvKmG), CG4026 (PcvmDiKmG), CG1630 (PcvmDcKvG), and CG10082 (PcilDlKmG). Sequence analysis of CG13688 (designated here as dmIpk2) revealed that it is most similar to Ipk2 homologs from other species (Fig. 1B). dmIpk2 is a 310 amino acid polypeptide encoded by a single exon with 37% similarity and 24% identity to the human Ipk2. CG10082 (designated dmIP6K) shared the highest degree of homology with mammalian IP6 kinases (also referred to as diphosphoryl inositol synthetases). IP6Ks use IP5 and IP6 as substrates to generate inositol pyrophosphate species. The putative dmIP6K open reading frame codes for an 893 amino acid protein and contains 36% similarity to human IP6K2 (GenBank™ accession number AF177145). Further studies will be required to elucidate whether this putative gene translates into a functional IP6 kinase as it will not be discussed here. The other two PXXXDXKXG-containing proteins (CG4026 and CG1630) share 59% similarity and are highly homologous to mammalian IP3K (Fig. 1B). Three different isoforms of IP3K (A–C) are described in higher eukaryotes that differ in sequence, tissue and subcellular localization. CG4026 (dmIP3Kα, originally annotated as dmIP3K1) was previously identified as an IP3K that confers resistance to oxidative stress when overexpressed in adult flies (31Monnier V. Girardot F. Audin W. Tricoire H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1250-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). CG1630 (dmIP3Kβ, originally annotated as dmIP3K2) is most similar to the human IP3K B (45% similar and 37% identical). The putative IP3Ks do not contain calmodulin-binding sites at their N terminus as are found in mammalian I(1,4,5)P3 3-kinases.Type I enzymes in the 5-phosphatase family have high catalytic efficiency as D5 specific phosphatases against I(1,4,5)P3 and I(1,3,4,5)P4, and contain a highly conserved motif (r/n)-XP(s/a)(w/y)(c/t)DR(i/v)(l/i) (30Majerus P.W. Kisseleva M.V. Norris F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10669-10672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This pattern motif was used to search Drosophila genome and identified a predicted gene product, CG31107 (designated dm5PtaseI), of 400 amino acids having 58% similarity and 43% identity to the human type I 5-phosphatase identified. Although no other putative type I 5-phosphatases were identified in the annotated genome we found that Drosophila contain open reading frames that encode two type II 5-phosphatase isozymes (CG6805 and CG9784), a synapto"
https://openalex.org/W2082177591,"Staphylococcus aureus is among the most prevalent and antibiotic-resistant of pathogenic bacteria. The resistance of S. aureus to prototypal β-lactam antibiotics is conferred by two mechanisms: (i) secretion of hydrolytic β-lactamase enzymes and (ii) production of β-lactam-insensitive penicillin-binding proteins (PBP2a). Despite their distinct modes of resistance, expression of these proteins is controlled by similar regulation systems, including a repressor (BlaI/MecI) and a multidomain transmembrane receptor (BlaR1/MecR1). Resistance is triggered in response to a covalent binding event between a β-lactam antibiotic and the extracellular sensor domain of BlaR1/MecR1 by transduction of the binding signal to an intracellular protease domain capable of repressor inactivation. This study describes the first crystal structures of the sensor domain of BlaR1 (BlaRS) from S. aureus in both the apo and penicillin-acylated forms. The structures show that the sensor domain resembles the β-lactam-hydrolyzing class D β-lactamases, but is rendered a penicillin-binding protein due to the formation of a very stable acyl-enzyme. Surprisingly, conformational changes upon penicillin binding were not observed in our structures, supporting the hypothesis that transduction of the antibiotic-binding signal into the cytosol is mediated by additional intramolecular interactions of the sensor domain with an adjacent extracellular loop in BlaR1."
https://openalex.org/W2160948226,"The matricellular protein CCN1 (CYR61) regulates multiple cellular processes and plays essential roles in embryonic vascular development. A ligand of several integrin receptors, CCN1 acts through integrin α6β1 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) to promote specific functions in fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. We have previously identified a novel α6β1 binding site, T1, in domain III of CCN1. Here we uncover two novel 16-residue sequences, H1 and H2, in domain IV that can support α6β1- and HSPGs-dependent cell adhesion, suggesting that these sequences contain closely juxtaposed or overlapping sites for interaction with α6β1 and HSPGs. Furthermore, fibroblast adhesion to the H1 and H2 peptides is sufficient to induce prolonged MAPK activation, whereas adhesion to T1 induces transient MAPK activation. To dissect the roles of these sites in CCN1 function, we have created mutants disrupted in T1, H1, and H2 or in all three sites in the context of full-length CCN1. We show that the T1 and H1/H2 sites are functionally non-equivalent, and disruption of these sites differentially affected cell adhesion, migration, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and regulation of gene expression. Disruption of all three sites completely abolished α6β1-HSPG-mediated cellular activities. All mutants disrupting T1, H1, and H2 fully retain αvβ3-mediated pro-angiogenic activities, indicating that these mutants are biologically active and are defective only in α6β1-HSPG-mediated functions. Together, these findings identify and dissect the differential roles of the three sites (T1, H1, H2) required for α6β1-HSPG-dependent CCN1 activities and provide a strategy to investigate these α6β1-HSPG-specific activities in vivo.

The significance of this protein family is underscored by the finding that targeted disruptions of Ccn1 (cysteine-rich 61, Cyr61) and Ccn2 (connective tissue growth factor, Ctgf) both lead to lethality in mice but with distinct phenotypes (4Mo F.E.

Cancer. 2003; 10: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). CCN1 was first identified as a cysteine-rich protein of ∼40 kDa encoded by a growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene (11O'Brien T.P. Yang G.P. Sanders L. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Upon synthesis, CCN1 is quantitatively secreted and associates with the ECM and the cell surface, in part because of its high affinity for HSPGs (12Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar). As is characteristic of the protein family, CCN1 is composed of an N-terminal secretory signal followed by four distinct modular domains with sequence similarities to insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP), von Willebrand factor type C repeat (VWC), thrombospondin type I repeat (TSP1), and regions of Slit and mucins in the C terminus (CT) (13Bork P.

As a modular ECM protein with characteristics intermediate between growth factors, cytokines, and structural ECM molecules, CCN1 can be considered a “matricellular” protein that serves regulatory roles without functioning as an integral component of structural elements (14Bornstein P.

In keeping with its structural roots in ECM proteins, CCN1 functions as a ligand of integrins, which are heterodimeric transmembrane signaling receptors that mediate diverse cellular responses to ECM proteins (18Miranti C.K.

In fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells, integrin α6β1 and HSPGs act as co-receptors to mediate cell adhesion, and these co-receptors also support smooth muscle cell migration (21Chen N.

By contrast, the pro-angiogenic activities of CCN1 in activated endothelial cells are all mediated through integrin αvβ3 (25Leu S.-J. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F. J. Biol.

Focusing on the first three domains of CCN1, we have recently identified a novel integrin α6β1 binding site, T1, in domain III (26Leu S.J. Liu Y. Chen N. Chen C.C. Lam S.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33801-33808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this study, we have uncovered two additional sequences, H1 and H2, that can support α6β1- and HSPG-dependent cell adhesion. To dissect the functional roles of the three sites for α6β1-HSPG interaction, we have created CCN1 mutants disrupted in T1, H1, and H2 and in all three sites. Analysis of these mutants shows that CCN1-receptor interaction through T1 (binding only α6β1) and H1/H2 (interacting with both α6β1 and HSPGs) differentially regulate cell adhesion, migration, MAPK activation, and regulation of gene expression. In particular, T1 and H1/H2 induce transient and prolonged p42/p44 MAPK activation, respectively. Disruption of all three sites completely abolish α6β1-HSPG-mediated activities but retain αvβ3-dependent pro-angiogenic activities. These findings identify and dissect the sites required for α6β1-HSPG-dependent CCN1 activities, show that they can be dissociated from αvβ3-mediated functions, and provide a molecular strategy for dissecting integrin-specific CCN1 functions in an in vivo context. Antibodies, Peptides, and Reagents—Rat type I collagen, vitronectin, laminin, and VEGF were purchased from Collaborative Biomedical (Bedford, MA). BSA, heparin (sodium salt, from porcine intestinal mucosa), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and control normal mouse IgG were obtained from Sigma. GRGDSP and GRGESP synthetic peptides and function-blocking mAbs against integrin β1 (clone P4C10) were from Invitrogen. mAbs against integrin αvβ3 (clone LM609, azide-free) and integrin α6 (clone GoH3, azide-free) were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA) and Immunotech (Marseille, France), respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies against total and dually phosphorylated p42/p44 MAPKs were from Promega (Madison, WI). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Microtiter wells were coated with GST fusion proteins or BSA (50 μl/well) overnight at 4 °C followed by blocking with 1% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. Protein-coating efficiency was examined by incubation with an anti-GST mAb (2 h at 37 °C) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1 h at 37 °C). The color reaction was developed and quantified by absorbance measurements at 420 nm (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Preparation of GST-Peptide Fusions, CCN1, and Mutant Proteins—The coding sequences for various CT domain peptides (Table I) were amplified by PCR using the murine Ccn1 cDNA as template, essentially as described (26Leu S.J.

Primers used corresponded to the appropriate coding sequence and contained the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites for cloning. PCR products were purified on polyacrylamide gels, digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and ligated into the pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). All cloning steps were confirmed by sequence analysis. GST-peptide fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer followed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. GST-T1 peptide fusion protein was prepared as described previously and GSTT1-(K239E) peptide fusion was prepared similarly (26Leu S.J. Liu Y. Chen N. Chen C.C. Lam S.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Using the same procedure, the previously constructed DM coding sequence was used to generate the DM construct with a FLAG tag. The SM (K239E) mutant was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using a two-step PCR procedure as described (27Koskinen P. Lehvaslaiho H. MacDonald Bravo H. Alitalo K. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 615-618PubMed Google Scholar). The internal primer sets were 5′-GTCTTGGTCCCAGTGTTCCGAGAGCTGCGG-3′ and 5′-CACTGGGACCAAGACGTGGTCTGAACGATGC-3′. This construct also created a silent mutation at C237, thereby providing a screening marker by eliminating a BSP12861 restriction site. The outside primers used in PCR were F1 and F2 as described above. SM was constructed using the mouse Ccn1 cDNA with a FLAG tag as PCR template, and TM was created by using DM as a template to generate the K239E mutation. All constructs were confirmed by direct sequence analysis. To express CCN1 and mutant proteins, recombinant baculovirus stocks were prepared as previously described (28Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and used to infect SF-9 cells maintained under serum-free conditions in EX-CELL 400 medium (JRH Biosciences) at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Media were collected 36-40 h post-infection, cleared by centrifugation, and adjusted to 0.4 m salt before loading onto an affinity column with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). The column was washed with 0.4 m NaCl, 50 mm Hepes at pH 7.4 before elution with the FLAG peptide, DYKDDDDK, in the washing buffer. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and immunoblotting. Pooled fractions for each construct were dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes at pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl overnight at 4 °C to remove the FLAG peptide. Alternatively, the bound protein was eluted with 0.1 m glycine followed by neutralization with 1 m HEPES at pH 8.0. Proteins eluted by both methods exhibited the same activities. Construction and purification of the CCN1-H1 and CCN1-H2 mutants (Fig. 4B) were previously described (21Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Cell Adhesion—Primary human foreskin fibroblast (ATCC CRL-2076, passage 2) were kept in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and used within 10 passages (21Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Primary bovine aortic smooth muscle cells were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and maintained in their smooth muscle basal medium supplemented with SmGm-2 (5% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 2 ng/ml human fibroblast growth factor, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 50 ng/ml amphotericin-B, 5 μg/ml insulin) (24Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Lindner V. Chen N. Lam S.C. Lau L.F. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1441-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Primary HUVEC were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Medium 200 containing 2% serum and endothelial growth supplements according to vendor protocols (Cascade Biologics) and used within the fifth and tenth passages for all experiments (25Leu S.-J. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46248-46255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For fibroblast adhesion assays, test proteins were coated onto 96-well microtiter plates (BD Biosciences) in phosphate-buffered saline (50 μl per well), and wells were blocked with 1% BSA at room temperature for 1 h. Fibroblasts were washed, detached in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2.5 mm EDTA, resuspended in serum-free basal medium, and allowed to adhere to wells at 5 × 105 cells/ml (50 μl/well). For HUVEC, detached cells were resuspended in serum-free basal medium containing 0.2% BSA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, at 7 × 105 cells/ml with 0.5 mm Mn2+ for 30 min to activate integrin receptors. Where indicated, cells were preincubated with EDTA, peptides, heparin, or function-blocking mAbs for 30 min (fibroblasts) or 60 min (endothelial cells) before plating. Adherent cells were fixed 20 min after plating and stained with methylene blue before quantification by dye extraction and measurement of absorbance at 620 nm as described (7Chen C.-C. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10443-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Where indicated, fibroblasts were treated with heparinase I (EC 4.2.2.7; 2 units/ml, Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min before plating. MAPK Activation and Gene Expression—Primary human fibroblasts were serum-starved, resuspended in serum-free medium, and plated on 35-mm dishes pre-coated with CCN1 (10 μg/ml), SM (10 μg/ml), DM (250 μg/ml), or laminin (10 μg/ml) for various times. Clarified cell lysates were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with polyclonal anti-MAPK antibodies or antibodies specific for dual-phosphorylated p42/p44 MAPKs. To test the effects of soluble CCN1 and mutants on gene expression, serum-starved cells were treated with 10 μg/ml protein in serum-free condition for 24 h. Total cellular RNA was isolated, resolved on agarose-formaldehyde gel, blotted onto nylon membrane, and hybridized to [32P]dCTP-labeled probes for human VEGF-A, MMP-1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNAs as described (9Chen C.-C. Mo F.-E. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47329-47337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The blots were washed at high stringency (0.1 × SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at 65 °C) and analyzed by Phosphor-Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Pro-angiogenic Activities—HUVEC migration, thymidine incorporation, apoptosis, and endothelial tubule formation assays were performed as described previously (25Leu S.-J. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46248-46255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). VSMC Migration Assay—Cell migration assay was performed using a modified Boyden chamber as previously described (29Falk W. Goodwin Jr., R.H. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 33: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Test proteins were diluted in smooth muscle basal serum-free medium containing 0.5% BSA, loaded in the lower chamber in quadruplicate, and covered with a polycarbonate filter (5 μm pore diameter, Nucleopore). VSMC were trypsinized, resuspended in serum-free smooth muscle basal medium containing 0.5% BSA, and applied to the upper chamber (5 × 104 cells/well). After a 6-h incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2, the membrane was removed and stained with Diff-Quik (Dade-Behring). The chemotactic response was determined by counting the total number of cells migrated in 10 randomly selected microscope fields at 400× magnification. Identification of Two Novel Peptides That Support Integrin α6β1- and HSPG-dependent Cell Adhesion—Previous analysis of a C-terminal-truncated CCN1 mutant indicated the presence of an integrin α6β1 binding site within the first three domains (24Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Lindner V. Chen N. Lam S.C. Lau L.F. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1441-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), leading to the identification of a novel α6β1 binding site, T1, in domain III (26Leu S.J. Liu Y. Chen N. Chen C.C. Lam S.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33801-33808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). More recent studies, however, suggested the potential presence of additional α6β1 binding sites in the CT domain (see below). To evaluate this possibility, we constructed a series of six overlapping peptides encompassing the entire CT domain as fusion proteins linked to GST (Table I). The fusion proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity and showed similar coating efficiency on microtiter wells as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an anti-GST antibody (data not shown). We tested the ability of these GST-peptide fusion proteins to support primary human fibroblast adhesion, which occurs through α6β1 and HSPGs when CCN1 serves as substrate (21Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the H1 and H2 peptide fusion proteins were able to support fibroblast adhesion, whereas GST alone and other peptide fusion proteins were inactive. Consistent with an integrin-mediated event, cell adhesion to H1 and H2 was inhibited by EDTA or Ca2+, whereas Mg2+ restored cell adhesion in EDTA-treated cells (Fig. 1B). Further, preincubation of fibroblasts with function-blocking mAbs against integrin α6 (GoH3) or β1 (P4C10) abolished cell adhesion to H1, H2, or CCN1, whereas mAbs against αvβ3 (LM609) or control mouse IgG had no effect (Fig. 1C). These results show that fibroblast adhesion to H1 and H2 is mediated through integrin α6β1. It is noteworthy that the H1 and H2 sequences subsume multiple basic residues previously identified to be important for binding heparin (21Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether cell adhesion to GST-H1 and GST-H2 also involved heparin binding. Indeed, the presence of soluble heparin in the plating medium, thereby saturating the heparin binding sites of CCN1, obliterated cell adhesion to the GST-H1 or GST-H2 as well as to CCN1 (Fig. 1D). Likewise, treatment of fibroblasts with heparinase I to remove heparin moieties from cell surface HSPGs completely inhibited cell adhesion to H1, H2, and CCN1, whereas the heparinase-treated cells adhered to laminin or vitronectin indifferently. Thus, fibroblast adhesion to H1 and H2 also requires interaction with cell surface HSPGs, suggesting that H1 and H2 contain closely juxtaposed or overlapping sites for interaction with α6β1 and HSPGs. Construction of CCN1 Mutants Disrupted in Binding Sites for the α6β1-HSPG Coreceptors—Results above indicate that CCN1 contains three sequences important for interaction with α6β1 and HSPGs: T1, H1, and H2. To dissect their relative contributions to CCN1 functions, we constructed mutants in the context of full-length CCN1 that are disrupted in T1 (SM, single mutant), H1 and H2 (DM, double mutant), and all three sites (TM, triple mutant) (Fig. 2A). To disrupt the T1 site (GQKCIVQTTSWSQCSKS), we turned to previous mutagenesis in which each conserved residue was individually altered (26Leu S.J. Liu Y. Chen N. Chen C.C. Lam S.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33801-33808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Alanine substitution in any of 4 residues (Trp-234, Ser-235, Ser-238, Lys-239) reduced α6β1-mediated cell adhesion by >90%, and mutation in both Thr-231 and Thr-232 completely abolished cell adhesion. However, our attempts to produce mutant CCN1 proteins with alanine substitutions in these critical T1 residues did not yield soluble proteins (data not shown). The expressed mutants aggregated and formed inclusion bodies inside the cell, suggesting that these mutants adopted detrimental conformations that prevented them from being secreted. To avoid mutations that may cause major structural changes, we applied two algorithms, PSIPRED and FRAGFOLD (30McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar, 31Jones D.T. Proteins. 2001; 45: 127-132Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar), to predict possible structural alterations that may result from mutations. Each of the critical residues in T1 was substituted with each of the other 19 amino acids to predict the protein structure using these algorithms. Consistent with the inability of alanine substitution mutants to be secreted, the T1 region of CCN1 appears highly sensitive to perturbation. Substitutions of the critical residues in T1 with nearly any amino acid resulted in drastic changes in the predicted protein structure. However, we found one mutation, namely K239E, that did not elicit a predicted conformational change. To test the efficacy of this mutation in disrupting interaction with α6β1, we constructed a GST fusion protein linked to the T1 peptide carrying the K239E mutation (GQKCIVATTSWSQCSES). Fibroblast adhesion to this mutant peptide was assessed. GST-T1 (wild type) and GST-T1-(K239E) have similar coating efficiency as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). As expected, fibroblasts adhered to the GST-T1 fusion but not to BSA or the GST control (Fig. 2B) (26Leu S.J. Liu Y. Chen N. Chen C.C. Lam S.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33801-33808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). GST-T1-(K239E) was completely unable to support cell adhesion, indicating that the single charge-reversed K239E mutation effectively abolished T1 binding to integrin α6β1. We, therefore, constructed the K239E mutation in the context of full-length CCN1, designated SM (Fig. 2A). We have previously shown that mutations in the basic residues within the H1 and H2 sequences obliterated heparin binding in CCN1 (21Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We, therefore, incorporated these mutations, changing KGKKCSKTKKSPEPVR (H1) to AGAACSATAKSPEPVR and FTYAGCSSVKKYRPKY (H2) to FTYAGCSSVAAYAPKY in CCN1 to create the mutant DM (Fig. 2A). In addition, we also create"

More recently, a screen of Rho family GTPases revealed a marked activation of PLC-ϵ when coexpressed with RhoA, RhoB, or RhoC but not with Rac or Cdc42 (24Wing M.R. Snyder J.T. Sondek J. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41253-41258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This activation depended on a unique ∼65 residue-insert within the Y box of the catalytic TIM barrel of PLC-ϵ, and co-precipitation studies indicated an interaction between PLC-ϵ and RhoA. Although these results suggest that PLC-ϵ is a direct, downstream effector of Rho GTPases, other interpretations are also consistent with the data.To provide incontrovertible evidence for direct activation of PLC-ϵ by GTP-bound Rho GTPases, we overexpressed and purified a large fragment of the phospholipase (PLC-ϵ EF-RA2; ∼118 kDa) and present here the enzymatic characterization of this fragment reconstituted with phospholipids and GTPases. Relative to previously purified PLC isozymes, purified PLC-ϵ EF-RA2 exhibited similar specific phospholipase activity and phosphoinositide substrate preferences. Moreover, our analyses illustrate direct, guanine nucleotide-dependent activation of PLC-ϵ by RhoA and further implicate the catalytic core of PLC-ϵ as the effector region necessary for RhoA-stimulated phospholipase activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The open reading frame of rat PLC-ϵ was a kind gift from Grant Kelley (State University of New York, Syracuse, NY). A PLC-ϵ-specific antibody was generated by BIOSOURCE against a predicted exposed sequence (amino acids 1523–1540; LKAHQTPVDILKQKAHQL) directly C-terminal to the X box of the catalytic core. 3H-Labeled phosphoinositide substrates were prepared from [3H]inositol-labeled turkey erythrocytes as described previously (4Waldo G.L. Boyer J.L. Morris A.J. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14217-14225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). His6-tagged tobacco etch virus protease was purified as described previously (25Kapust R.B. Tozser J. Fox J.D. Anderson D.E. Cherry S. Copeland T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar).Purification of PLC-ϵ EF-RA2—A fragment of PLC-ϵ encompassing approximately one-half of the EF-hand repeats through the second RA domain (amino acids 1258–2215) was amplified from full-length PLC-ϵ by PCR and subcloned into NcoI/XhoI-digested pFastBacHT, which incorporates a His6 tag and a tobacco etch virus protease site at the amino terminus of the expressed enzyme. Baculovirus encoding PLC-ϵ EF-RA2 was generated using the Bac-to-Bac method (Invitrogen). HighFive insect cells at a density of ∼2.0 × 106 cells/ml were infected with virus encoding PLC-ϵ EF-RA2 at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0. After 48 h of incubation at 27 °C, cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in 100 ml of buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10% glycerol) with two EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed using an EmulsiFlex C5 cell homogenizer (Avestin), and the lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The clarified supernatant was diluted to a final volume of 150 ml and loaded onto a 5-ml HighTrap metal chelate column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with Ni2+. Purification steps included a 10-column volume buffer A wash and a 10-column volume 3% buffer B wash (buffer A + 1 m imidazole). Recombinant protein was eluted with 10 column volumes of 40% buffer B collected in 5-ml fractions. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were dialyzed overnight against buffer A in the presence of His6-tagged tobacco etch virus protease to remove the His6 tag from PLC-ϵ EF-RA2. The cleaved protein was subjected to a second passage over a Ni2+-charged metal chelate column and eluted with 5 mm imidazole as a final purification step. Fractions containing the purified protein were pooled and concentrated using a 50,000 MWCO PES centrifugal filtering device (Vivascience). The final concentration of the recombinant protein was determined by comparing a Bradford assay to bovine serum albumin standards. Purification of avian PLC-βt was described previously (26Waldo G.L. Paterson A. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PLC-β2 PH-C2 is a fragment of full-length human PLC-β2 that encompasses amino acid residues 1–801 and was purified as described previously (11Snyder J.T. Singer A.U. Wing M.R. Harden T.K. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Purification of FLAG-tagged PLC-ϵ Constructs—Construction of mammalian expression vectors for PLC-ϵ EF-Ct and PLC-ϵ EF-CΔY was described previously (24Wing M.R. Snyder J.T. Sondek J. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41253-41258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). PLC-ϵ EF-Ct spans amino acids 1198–2281, and PLC-ϵ EF-CΔY spans amino acids 1198–2281 but lacks 62 amino acids (residues 1667–1728) that occur as an ∼70-amino acid insert that is conserved in all orthologues of PLC-ϵ. COS-7 cells were seeded on 150-mm dishes at a density of 5.0 × 106 cells per dish and maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 90% air, 10% CO2. Sixty microliters of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used to transfect 20 μg of each PLC-ϵ vector construct per dish according to the manufacturer's protocol. The overexpressed recombinant PLC isozymes were purified using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma). Briefly, ∼36 h after transfection, growth medium was removed from the cells, and the dishes were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate, 2.7 mm potassium chloride, 137 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4). After aspiration of the phosphate-buffered saline, 1 ml of lysis buffer was added per dish, and the dishes were incubated for 15 min with shaking. Cells were scraped from dishes, and the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The resultant supernatant was subjected to a single gravity flow passage over a 1-ml bed volume of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel and washed with 10 bed volumes of Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) to remove unbound proteins. Recombinant protein was then collected in six 500-μl elutions with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide in Tris-buffered saline.Purification of Small GTPases—The coding sequences of human monomeric GTPases were amplified by PCR and ligated into BamHI/XhoI-digested pFastBacHT. Baculovirus encoding the Rho family GTPases was produced using the Bac-to-Bac system. Recombinant proteins were expressed in HighFive insect cells at a density of ∼2.0 × 106 cells/ml after infection with baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0. The cells were harvested after 48 h at 27 °C by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol) with one EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor tablet. Membranes of virus-infected cells were harvested by high speed centrifugation at 100,000 × g of the cell lysate for 1 h. Lipidated, membrane-bound GTPases were solubilized by detergent extraction of the harvested membranes in buffer A containing 1% purified sodium cholate and one EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor tablet for1hat4 °C. Solubilized membrane proteins were recovered by centrifugation of the extracted membranes at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The clarified supernatant was diluted with buffer A to achieve a final detergent concentration of 0.3% and was subsequently loaded onto a HighTrap metal chelate column charged with Ni2+. Recombinant protein was collected over an imidazole gradient running from 0 to 1 m over 20 column volumes. Fractions containing the recombinant GTPase were pooled and concentrated using 10,000 MWCO PES centrifugal filtering device. The concentrations of the individual GTPases were determined by quantifying the binding of [35S]GTPγS under the same buffer conditions used for reconstitution of the GTPases in phospholipid vesicles described below.Phospholipase C Assay—Two different procedures were utilized for measuring phospholipase activity of PLC enzymes. Initial experiments measuring maximum enzymatic activity were carried out in the presence of a detergent substrate mixture. The second assay employed phospholipid vesicles combined with purified GTPases in cholate-containing buffers prior to the addition of PLC-ϵ. Assays were performed interchangeably using either [3H]PtdIns(4)P or [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 as substrate as indicated in the figure legends.Maximum enzymatic activity was determined as previously described (4Waldo G.L. Boyer J.L. Morris A.J. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14217-14225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, PLC isozymes were incubated in final buffer conditions including 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 120 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 5.8 mm MgSO4, 0.5% cholate, 100 μm free calcium, 0.16 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 100 μm PtdIns(4)P (Avanti Polar Lipids), and ∼10,000 cpm/assay [3H]PtdIns(4)P in a final volume of 60 μl. Assays were at 30 °C for 10 min and were terminated by the addition of 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 100 μl of 10 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Centrifugation of the reaction mixture separated aqueous [3H]Ins(1,4)P2 from precipitated [3H]PtdIns(4)P, and soluble [3H]Ins(1,4)P2 was quantified by liquid scintillation counting.Most experiments to determine enzyme characteristics and potential regulation by small GTPases utilized phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)- and PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing lipid vesicles in assays that were previously described (27Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, recombinant proteins were presented in lipid vesicles containing 50 μm PtdIns(4,5)P2, 500 μm PE (Avanti Polar Lipids), and ∼10,000 cpm of [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 per assay. Final buffer conditions were 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 70 mm KCl, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.16 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 1 μm free Ca2+ in a final volume of 60 μl. The concentration of free calcium was calculated using WinMAXC software (Stanford University). All reactions were performed at 25 °C for 10 min after the addition of the indicated PLC enzyme. Experiments designed to determine the substrate selectivity of PLC-ϵ EF-RA2 utilized 1 nmol each of PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2, along with 30 nmol of PE per assay. Only the 3H-labeled phosphoinositide substrate was changed for each condition.For experiments determining the effects of small GTPases on phospholipase activity, 10 μl of purified G protein was reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles, resulting in a final cholate concentration of 0.05%. The small GTPases were loaded with nucleotide by incubation with 10 μm GDP or 10 μm GTPγS under assay conditions for 20 min at 25 °C prior to the addition of PLC. Assays were initiated by the addition of PLC enzyme and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 100 μl of 10 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. [3H]Inositol(1,4,5) trisphosphate was quantified by liquid scintillation counting of the soluble fraction after centrifugation of the reaction mixture.RESULTSPurification of PLC-ϵ EF-RA2—A fragment of PLC-ϵ (Fig. 1A) encompassing approximately half the EF-hand repeats through the second RA domain (amino acids 1258–2215) was purified after overexpression from a recombinant baculovirus in HighFive insect cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The soluble fraction of the enzyme bound efficiently to a metal chelate column as a first purification step. After tobacco etch virus protease cleavage of the affinity tag, a second passage over a metal chelate column yielded a nearly homogeneous preparation of the recombinant protein (Fig. 1B). The purified PLC-ϵ fragment migrated as a species of ∼118 kDa on SDS-PAGE as seen by Coomassie staining and immunoblot analysis with a PLC-ϵ-specific antibody. Contaminating proteins observed by Coomassie staining were not immunoreactive, suggesting that the impurities were not breakdown products of the PLC-ϵ fragment. The typical yield of purified PLC-ϵ was 0.5–1.0 mg/liter baculovirus-infected insect cells. Multiple attempts to purify full-length PLC-ϵ after insect cell expression have yielded insufficient amounts of purified protein.PLC Activity of PLC-ϵ EF-RA2—The purified PLC-ϵ fragment exhibited phospholipase C activity in assays utilizing a detergent and lipid mixture containing 50 μm [3H]PtdIns(4)P as substrate (Fig. 1C). Enzymatic activity depended on the amount of purified phospholipase and was linear over a range of concentrations. The observed enzymatic activity of ∼10 μmol/min/mg of protein was similar to that of the widely studied purified avian PLC-βt (4Waldo G.L. Boyer J.L. Morris A.J. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14217-14225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Boyer J.L. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 13508-13514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent assays were performed utilizing PE- and PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing vesicles either in the absence of detergent when examining PLC-ϵ activity alone or in the presence of 0.05% sodium cholate when reconstituting PLC-ϵ with vesicles containing purified small GTPases. Phosphoinositide hydrolysis was linear for at least 10 min under the conditions of these assays (Fig. 2A). Similar to other PLC isozymes, enzymatic activity of PLC-ϵ EF-RA2 depended on the concentration of free calcium with an EC50 value of ∼65 ± 11 nm (n = 3), and maximum activity was observed at a concentration of ∼1 μm free Ca2+ (Fig. 2B). Kinetic analyses of PLC-ϵ EF-RA2 were performed utilizing PE- and PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing vesicles presented at various concentrations in the bulk medium (see “Experimental Procedures”). These experiments and Hofstee analyses revealed a Vmax of ∼6.5 μmol/min/mg of protein and a Km value for PtdIns(4,5)P2 of ∼6.0 μm (n = 3) (Fig. 2C). The phospholipid substrate selectivity of PLC-ϵ EF-RA2 was determined using PE- and PtdIns-containing vesicles composed of an equal ratio of PtdIns:PtdIns(4)P:PtdIns(4,5)P2. The recombinant PLC-ϵ fragment hydrolyzed phosphoinositides with a rank order of selectivity of PtdIns(4,5)P2 > PtdIns(4)P > PtdIns (Fig. 2D).Fig. 2Characterization of the phospholipase activity of PLC-ϵ EF-RA2.A, time course of PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis in the presence of PLC-ϵ EF-RA2 (10 ng) was tested either in the absence (open squares) or presence (closed circles) of 300 nm inactive (GDP-bound) RhoA or in the presence of activated (GTPγS-bound) RhoA (closed triangles). B, PLC-ϵ EF-RA2 was incubated with phospholipid vesicles containing [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 substrate under varying calcium concentrations in the absence of RhoA (open circles) or presence of 300 nm GTPγS-bound RhoA (closed circles). C, the lipase activity of PLC-ϵ EF-RA2 (2 ng) was assayed with increasing concentrations of PtdIns(4,5)P2 substrate. The data shown are the mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments, and the inset is a Hofstee plot of the data. D, the substrate selectivity of PLC-ϵ EF-RA2 was tested by presentation of either [3H]PtdIns (black bars), [3H]PtdIns(4)P (dashed bars), or [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 (open bars) with equal amounts of each cold substrate per assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Enzyme activity was tested with two different concentrations of the purified enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Activation of Recombinant PLC-ϵ by RhoA—Previous studies indicate that the Rho family members, RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC, induce stimulation of phospholipase activity when transiently coexpressed with PLC-ϵ in COS-7 cells (24Wing M.R. Snyder J.T. Sondek J. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41253-41258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To determine whether the stimulation of PLC-ϵ by Rho family GTPases is direct, RhoA was expressed from a recombinant baculovirus in insect cells, purified to near homogeneity from detergent-extracted membranes, and reconstituted in substrate-containing phospholipid vesicles. As illustrated in the time course assay in Fig. 2A, recombinant RhoA (300 nm) stimulated phospholipase activity of PLC-ϵ by 2.5-fold in the presence of GTPγS but had no effect in the presence of GDP. To further assess this phenomenon, RhoA was reconstituted over a wide range of concentrations in mixed detergent phospholipid micelles, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis was quantified in the presence of the purified PLC-ϵ fragment (Fig. 3). The amount of recombinant PLC-ϵ used (∼2 ng) for reconstitution with the GTPases was adjusted to achieve a basal activity of 5–10 pmol/min. RhoA caused a 2–3-fold stimulation of PLC-ϵ in all experiments. Stimulation was GTPγS-dependent, and half-maximal activation was observed at a concentration of RhoA of 58 ± 18 nm (n = 4). The calcium dependence for activation of PLC-ϵ was not changed in the presence of GTPγS-activated RhoA (Fig. 2B). GTPγS-dependent activation of PLC-ϵ was not observed with non-lipidated RhoA purified from bacteria, suggesting that C-terminal isoprenylation of RhoA may be required for activation (data not shown).Fig. 3Activation of PLC-ϵ by RhoA. Increasing concentrations of recombinant RhoA purified from detergent-extracted HighFive insect cell membranes were reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Assays included PLC-ϵ EF-RA2 in mixed detergent phospholipid micelles containing [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2. After a 20-min preincubation of RhoA with either 10 μm GDP (open circles) or 10 μm GTPγS (closed circles), PLC-ϵ EF-RA2 (1–2 ng) was added and the assay was performed for 10 min at 25 °C. Basal activity of PLC-ϵ EF-RA2 in the absence of RhoA (5–15 pmol/min) was subtracted to give the final values. The results presented are the mean ± S.E. of four individual experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The selectivity for activation of PLC-ϵ by Rho family GTPases was examined by assessing the potential capacity of purified Rac1 to activate PLC-ϵ following purification of the lipidated form of the GTPase from baculovirus-infected insect cells. At relatively high concentrations (300 nm), Rac1 caused an increase in PLC-ϵ activity. However, no guanine nucleotide dependence was observed (Fig. 4). Lower concentrations of Rac1 also had no effect on PLC-ϵ in the absence or presence of GTPγS (data not shown), and the increased activity observed at higher GTPase concentrations may result from contaminating proteins that accompany the purification. Although Rac1 had no effect on PLC-ϵ activity, this Rho family GTPase caused an ∼2-fold GTPγS-dependent stimulation of PLC-β2 PH-C2 (Fig. 4), which is consistent with previously published data (8Illenberger D.

The specific function of PEN-2 is unclear. To explore its function and intermolecular interactions, we conducted deletion and mutagenesis studies on a series of conserved residues at the C terminus of PEN-2. These studies suggest that: 1) both the presence and amino acid sequence of the conserved DYLSF domain at the C terminus of PEN-2 (residues 90–94) is critical for binding PEN-2 to other components in the presenilin complex and 2) the overall length of the exposed C terminus is critical for functional γ-secretase activity.

These studies suggest that: 1) both the presence and amino acid sequence of the conserved DYLSF domain at the C terminus of PEN-2 (residues 90–94) is critical for binding PEN-2 to other components in the presenilin complex and 2) the overall length of the exposed C terminus is critical for functional γ-secretase activity. The presenilin proteins (PS1 and PS2) are evolutionarily conserved polytopic transmembrane proteins that are required for the regulated intramembranous proteolysis of several Type 1 transmembrane proteins including the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), 1The abbreviations used are: APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; PS, presenilin; NCT, nicastrin; Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; CHAPSO, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid.

There are also a series of residues at the hydrophilic C terminus (residues 90–101) that are conserved during evolution and that we hypothesize are functionally important (see Fig. 1A). In support of this, one of the three naturally occurring loss-of-function mutants in C. elegans is a stop codon mutation at residue Trp74, which truncates the protein near the beginning of this C-terminal hydrophilic loop (8Francis R.

To explore this hypothesis, we have investigated the functional effects of mutations in this C-terminal domain. Our data indicate that both the overall length of the exposed C terminus of PEN-2 and the sequence of a highly conserved DYLSF motif within this domain are important for binding of PEN-2 to other components of the presenilin complex and for proper function of the complexes during NCT maturation, presenilin endoproteolysis, and Aβ secretion. Construction of Expression Plasmids and Stable Cells—A cDNA clone encoding human wild-type PEN-2 was generated by PCR from a human brain cDNA library. Using this cDNA as a template, constructs encoding an N-terminal V5-tagged wild-type and mutant PEN-2 were obtained by PCR using 5′-GAATTCCAGCTATGGGTAAGCCTATCCCTAACCCTCTCCTCGGTCTCGATTCTACGAACCTGGAGCGAGTGTCCAAT-3′ as a forward primer, and 5′-CTCGAGCTCAGGGGGTGCCCAGGGGTAT-3′ for wild-type PEN-2, 5′-CTCGAGCTCACCGGTAGATCTGGAAGAT-3′ for del84–101, 5′-CTCGAGCTCACCCAAGGGCACCCCAGCG-3′ for del90–101, and 5′-CTCGAGCTCAGGTGAAGGAGAGGTAGTC-3′ for del96–101 as a reverse primer.

Consequently, all constructs were tagged with V5 at the N terminus and, following direct sequence verification, were ligated into the expression vector pcDNA4 (Invitrogen). The N-terminal V5 tag partially interferes with the recognition epitope (residues 1–26). However, transient transfection of N-terminal V5-tagged wild-type PEN-2 constructs into cells in which PEN-2 expression had been suppressed by RNAi (see below) confirmed that the V5-tagged protein was expressed and fully complemented the loss of endogenous PEN-2, resulting in restoration of PS1 endoproteolysis, nicastrin maturation, and Aβ production. HEK293 cells stably expressing APPswe were transfected with these plasmids or with empty vector (as a negative control) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Stable transfectant cells were selected in 150 μg/ml zeocin. For a stable PEN-2 knock-down cell line, the oligonucleotides against PEN-2 160–180 were ligated with pSUP vector (Oligoengine) as per the manufacturer's instruction. After confirming the sequence, pSUP/PEN-2 160–180 and pCDNA6/V5 vector (Invitrogen) were stably transfected into a HEK293 clone stably expressing APPswe, using LipofectAMINE and were selected with blasticidin (10 μg/ml).

Immunoprecipitation—Membrane fractions isolated from HEK293 cells were lysed with 1% CHAPSO (Sigma) in a buffer containing 10% glycerol. After preclearing with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, the cell lysates were incubated with the appropriate antibody.

The values of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 were compared by Student's t test. Because the DYLSF mutants represent a population of related mutants that are not fully independent of each other, we analyzed the mutations involving the DYLSF domain including the deletion mutants as a single population to avoid the risk of false positive results arising from multiple comparisons. The AAA (IPG), del96–101, KDAS, and del100–101 mutants were individually compared with wild-type PEN-2 because they represent a small number of tests of a different hypothesis (that the length of the C terminus is critical). Functional Domain Analysis—To explore the function of the conserved residues at the C terminus of PEN-2, we initially created three overlapping deletion mutants: del84–101, del90–101, and del96–101 (Fig. 1B). When these cDNAs were stably transfected into HEK293 cells stably expressing APPswe, they produced proteins of the expected molecular weight (Fig. 2A, top panel). Immunoprecipitation with PS1 revealed that the wild-type exogenous V5-tagged PEN-2 co-precipitated with PS1 (Fig. 2B, panel 1). The wild-type V5-tagged PEN-2 protein also displaced endogenous PEN-2 (Fig. 2, A, panel 2, and B, panel 2). (Note that the N-terminal V5 tag partially interferes with the recognition epitope (residues 1–26), so that the V5-tagged and endogenous PEN-2 peptides can be easily distinguished by their differential affinities for anti-V5 antibodies and the antibody to residues 1–26 of PEN-2. Note also that the interference with the anti-PEN-2 antibody recognition sequence has no functional effect because transient transfection of N-terminal V5-tagged wild-type PEN-2 constructs into cells in which endogenous PEN-2 expression had been suppressed by RNAi (see below) fully complemented the loss of endogenous PEN-2, resulting in restoration of PS1 endoproteolysis, nicastrin maturation, and Aβ production.) In contrast, mutant PEN-2 with a deletion after residue 96 (del96–101) moderately reduced the binding of the exogenous PEN-2 to PS1, nicastrin, and APH-1 and was able to partially displace endogenous PEN-2. However, deletion of residues 84–101 or 90–101 dramatically reduced the amount of exogenous PEN-2 that was co-precipitated with PS1 (Fig. 2B, panel 1). Furthermore, because these overexpressed deletion mutant PEN-2 molecules did not bind PS1 (Fig. 2B, panel 1), they also failed to displace the endogenous PEN-2 (Fig. 2A, panel 2), which therefore continued to interact and co-precipitate with PS1 (Fig. 2B, panel 2). As would be predicted, the del84–101 and del90–101 did not co-precipitate with either APH-1 or nicastrin (Fig. 2B, panels 4 and 5). These observations suggest that the C terminus, and in particular residues 90–96, which contain the highly conserved DYLSF motif, may either: 1) be essential for the stability of PEN-2; 2) be essential for the proper trafficking of PEN-2; or 3) be involved in binding of PEN-2 to other components of the presenilin complex. To explore whether these mutants caused destabilization of PEN-2, we assessed cellular PEN-2 levels following cycloheximide blockade of protein synthesis in HEK293 cells. Endogenous PEN-2, wild-type PEN-2 tagged at the N terminus, and del96–101 mutant constructs had equivalent stability with a half-life of ∼9–10 h (Fig. 3). In contrast, both the del84–101 and del90–101 deletion mutants were highly unstable, with a half-life of approximately 4 h. This result is not surprising because the del84–101 and del90–101 molecules are not incorporated into presenilin complexes and are therefore not stabilized. However, it is also possible that these proteins might be intrinsically unstable and that they are simply degraded before they can interact with the other components of the presenilin complexes. To exclude this possibility, we transiently expressed V5-tagged wild-type and mutant PEN-2 peptides in PS1 and PS2 double knock-out ES cells, where the stabilizing influence of presenilin complexes are not present, thereby allowing a direct comparison of the intrinsic stability of the wild-type and deletion mutant peptides. In PS1::PS2 double knock-out ES cells, the stability of transiently expressed wild-type and mutant PEN-2 proteins were equivalently reduced to less than 4 h, confirming that the mutant PEN-2 proteins were not intrinsically unstable (data not shown). To explore whether these mutants caused mistrafficking of PEN-2, we investigated the subcellular distribution of endogenous and exogenous PEN-2, using biochemical fractionation on iodixanol gradients. This study revealed that endogenous PEN-2 is predominantly located in intracellular membrane structures, especially those of the endoplasmic reticulum (colocalizing with calnexin) and the Golgi network (co-localizing with GM130) (Fig. 4, panel 3). The distributions of exogenous V5-tagged wild-type PEN-2 as well as the del84–101, del90–101, and del96–101 mutants were essentially identical and just slightly shifted with regard to the distribution of endogenous wild-type PEN-2 because of the presence of the additional V5 tag and/or because of modest overexpression (Fig. 4, panels 4–7). Previous studies have suggested that PEN-2 plays a role in presenilin endoproteolysis, nicastrin maturation, and Aβ generation (8Francis R. McGrath G. Zhang J. Ruddy D.A. Sym M. Apfeld J. Nicoll M.

Several of the mutants described above, even when stably overexpressed, are unable to displace endogenous PEN-2 from functional complexes. As a result, it is impossible to measure the functional properties of these PEN-2 mutants in cells expressing endogenous PEN-2. To circumvent this problem, we created PEN-2 knock-down cells by stable expression of PEN-2 siRNA. In these PEN-2 knock-down cells, endogenous PEN-2 protein is moderately (clone 10) or severely depleted (clones 13, 17, and 19) (Fig. 5, top panel). In agreement with previously reported studies using transient siRNA expression of PEN-2 (16Prokop S. Shirotani K. Edbauer D. Haass C. Steiner H. Crystal A.S. Morais V.A. Fortna R.R. Carlin D.

These PEN-2 knock-down cells also showed significant reductions in the amount of mature PS1-NTF, and these reductions in PS1-NTF levels were in proportion to the degree of depletion of PEN-2. As expected from previous work showing that APH-1 is a stable initial scaffolding molecule (21Gu Y. Chen F. Sanjo N. Kawarai T. Hasegawa H. Duthie M. Li W. Ruan X. Luthra A. Mount H.T. Tandon A.

However, Aβ secretion was significantly reduced compared with mock cells (Fig. 5, panel 7). To assess the interaction of these PEN-2 deletion mutants (del84–101, del90–101, and del96–101) with nicastrin, presenilins, and APH-1 in the absence of interference from endogenous PEN-2, we transiently expressed each of these deletion mutants in the PEN-2 knock-down cells. As expected from the initial immunoprecipitation experiments reported above, both the del84–101 and the del90–101 mutants bound poorly to the other presenilin components even in the absence of endogenous PEN-2 (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 4). Again in agreement with the results reported above, the binding of the del96–101 mutant to nicastrin, PS1, and APH-1 was reduced, but less severely than binding of del84–101 and del90–101 mutants. To further explore the sequence specificity of the apparently important conserved DYLSF domain at residues 90–94, we created a deletion mutant (del90–94), and a series of missense mutations in which either single residues, two residues, or five residues within the 90–94 domain were mutated to alanine (Fig. 1C). We then repeated the co-immunoprecipitation studies. Deletion of residues 90–94 or missense mutation of all five residues to alanine caused a dramatic reduction in the interaction between presenilin 1, nicastrin, and APH-1 (Fig. 6, lanes 10 and 11). In contrast, mutation of a single residue or two residues had variable but generally less severe effects on the interaction of PEN-2 with the other components as measured by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6, lanes 6–9). To assess the functional properties of these PEN-2 mutants, we next examined their ability to rescue presenilin complex formation and maturation in PEN-2 knock-down cells. Transient transfection of wild-type PEN-2 in PEN-2 knock-down cells significantly rescued nicastrin maturation, PS endoproteolysis, and Aβ secretion (Fig. 7, panels 1, 2, and 5), and was associated with slight reduction of APP-CTF (Fig. 7, panel 4). In contrast, transient expression of the AAAAA poly-substitution of residues 90–94, (Fig. 7) and the del84–101, (Fig. 8) del90–94, (Fig. 7), and del90–101 (Fig. 8) deletion mutants, which do not bind efficiently to other presenilin complex components, had little or no ability to rescue presenilin complex maturation and/or Aβ secretion (Fig. 7, panels 1, 2, and 5). The sAPP was unchanged in these cells (Fig. 7, panel 6), indicating that these mutants had not altered APP maturation, trafficking, or cleavage by α- and β-secretase. These effects were robust, being replicated in all three independent PEN-2 knockdown cells. In contrast to the profound loss-of-function effects of the AAAAA and del90–94 mutants, mutation of only one or two residues of the DYLSF domain caused variable but milder reductions in nicastrin maturation and PS endoproteolysis and Aβ secretion (Figs. 8, lanes 6–9, and 9A, lanes 6–9), and the degree of reduction was commensurate with the effect of each mutant on the interaction with other presenilin complex components. For instance the most conservative mutation DYLSF → EYLSF caused modest reductions in binding, complex maturation, and Aβ secretion (Figs. 8, lane 8, and 9, lane 8).Fig. 8NCT maturation and PS proteolysis were rescued by partial substitution mutants in DYLSF domain and AAA (IPG) mutant not by del84–101, del90–101, del96–101, AAAAA, del90–94, del100–101, and KDAS.

B, secreted Aβ in the condition medium was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (n ≥ 3 independent replications). wt, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Despite the fact that the del96–101 mutant binds more efficiently to other presenilin complex components than do the remaining PEN-2 deletion mutations, the del96–101 mutant only partially rescued presenilin complex maturation and function (with activity being equivalent to that of the other deletion mutations). We reasoned that this reduced rescue activity of the del96–101 mutant despite its only mild reduction in binding could occur if there are specific residues in the 96–101 domain that are critical for PEN-2 activity. There are three highly conserved residues in this domain: Ile at codon 96, Pro at codon 97, and Gly at codon 99. An alternate possibility is that the absolute length of the C terminus is critical to the function of PEN-2, and this deletion (and all of the other deletions) has altered this property. This latter possibility is supported by the prior report that exogenous wild-type C-terminally tagged PEN-2 failed to complement loss-of-function alleles in the C. elegans PEN-2 gene (8Francis R. McGrath G. Zhang J. Ruddy D.A. Sym M. Apfeld J. Nicoll M. Maxwell M. Hai B. Ellis M.C. Parks A.L. Xu W. Li J. Gurney M. Myers R.L. Himes C.S. Hiebsch R. Ruble C. Nye J.S. Curtis D. Dev.

To resolve this dichotomy, we made three constructs: one with alanine missense mutations at all three conserved residues, one with a four-residue (KDAS) C-terminal addition, and one with a deletion of the two non-conserved C-terminal residues, AAA (IPG), KDAS, and del100–101, respectively (Fig. 1D). Immunoprecipitation experiments following transient expression of these constructs in PEN-2 knock-down HEK293 cells revealed that the AAA (IPG) mutant bound to the other presenilins complex components comparably with that of wild-type PEN-2. However, the KDAS and the del100–101 mutant had a moderate reduction in binding that was similar in magnitude to the reduction in binding of the del96–101 mutant (Fig. 6, lane 15 for del100–101; not shown for KDAS). As would be expected from these binding assays, transient expression of the AAA (IPG) mutant nearly completely rescued both nicastrin maturation, PS endoproteolysis, and Aβ secretion, whereas the KDAS and the del100– 101 mutant had minimal effect (Figs. 8, lanes 14, 15, and 18, and 9A, lanes 14, 15, and 18). These data indicate that, in addition to the sequence and size of the conserved DYLSF motif at residues 90–94, another critical factor for nicastrin maturation and PS endoproteolysis is the length of the C terminus (Fig. 9). Our data reveal that PEN-2 plays a role in nicastrin maturation, PS endoproteolysis, and Aβ secretion and are in agreement with several previous reports (8Francis R. McGrath G. Zhang J. Ruddy D.A.

However, our data also reveal that the C terminus is important in: 1) modulating the interaction of PEN-2 with the other presenilin complex components, 2) supporting nicastrin maturation and PS endoproteolysis, and 3) supporting Aβ secretion. Our intensive mutation analysis suggests that both the sequence of the DYLSF domain and the absolute length of the C terminus are important for these activities. The deletion mutants, and to a lesser degree the individual missense mutations of the DYLSF domain, affect the binding of PEN-2 to the presenilin complex (and as a result they also affect presenilin complex assembly, maturation, and γ-secretase activity to an equivalent degree). On the other hand, modulation of the length (but not the sequence) of the exposed extreme C terminus of PEN-2 has less impact on PEN-2 binding to the complex but does have a significant affect on presenilin complex maturation and γ-secretase activity. We interpret these findings to mean that: 1) the amino acid sequence of the DYLSF domain is important for the physical binding of PEN-2 to the other presenilin complex components and 2) the absolute length of the C terminus is important for PEN-2 activity within functional presenilin complexes. The DYLSF domain has no conserved homology by BLAST database search. However, the YLSF sequence matches the tyrosine-based sorting signal (YXX[LMVIF]) in the cytoplasmic tail of several proteins including the mu subunit of the AP (adaptor protein) complex, TGN38, epidermal growth factor receptor, mannose 6-phosphate receptor, and furin (25Boll W.

Although the YLSF motifs in these examples work in the cytoplasm, it is conceivable that the DYLSF domain of PEN-2 could also be involved in targeting PEN-2 to nascent presenilin complexes or may simply be a binding motif required for the interaction of PEN-2 with other proteins in the PS1 complex. The fact that the absolute length (but not the sequence) of the C terminus of PEN-2 is critical for presenilin complex function but does not affect binding of PEN-2 to the complex suggests that the C terminus may be involved in maintaining non-sequence-based spatial interactions (e.g. spatial packing) with other components of the presenilin complex. A similar critical sensitivity to the length of the C terminus has been reported for both PS1 and PS2 (29Tomita T. Tokuhiro S. Hashimoto T. Aiba K. Saido T.C. Maruyama K. Iwatsubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21153-21160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because the C termini of both PS1/PS2 and PEN-2 are oriented in the cytoplasm, additional experiments will be needed to discern whether the C termini of these two proteins in fact interact, whether directly with each other or with a third protein. However, taken together these data raise the possibility that PEN-2 might function as an important linker/spacer molecule that maintains spatial interactions between various presenilin complex components.

Intracellular proteins are degraded in the cytosol predominantly by the 26/20 S proteasome, and a fraction of these cleavage products are transported by TAP into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, where they bind to major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. Peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex I are transported to the cell surface where the antigenic cargo is displayed to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, which eventually eliminate infected or transformed cells (1Grommé M. Neefjes J. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 181-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). TAP belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, the members of which use ATP to translocate a large variety of solutes across biological membranes (2Higgins C.F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). ABC transporters share a common structural organization with two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and two transmembrane domains. The TAP complex is a heterodimer composed of TAP1 (ABCB2) and TAP2 (ABCB3). Both subunits consist of a transmembrane domain followed by an NBD (3Abele R. Tampé R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The peptide-binding pocket is located in the transmembrane domain (4Nijenhuis M. Hämmerling G.J. J.

Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The NBDs contain the Walker A and Walker B consensus sequences and the C-loop (ABC signature motif). The Walker A (GXXGXGK(S/T)) and Walker B (ΦΦΦΦD, where Φ resembles any hydrophobic amino acid) motifs are involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. The Walker B motif is extended by a conserved glutamate (underlined) (ΦΦΦΦDE), which has been postulated to be the catalytic base for ATP hydrolysis (6Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E.

Two ATPs are sandwiched at the interface between the two NBDs, positioned by the Walker A/B motifs of one NBD and the C-loop of the other NBD (Fig. 1A). In the dimer, the γ-phosphate of ATP is fixed by additional hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl group of the highly conserved serine (underlined) and the amide of the invariant second glycine (underlined) of the C-loop (LSGGQ). Although these studies elucidate structural aspects of the symmetric NBD dimer formation, the functional asymmetry of the NBDs in some ABC transporters is not yet explained. The functional non-equivalence of the two NBDs of TAP may be reflected in variations of the conserved motifs. Notably, all differences from the canonical sequences of ABC proteins affect ATP-binding site I, which, per definition, is built up by the Walker A and B motifs of TAP1 and the C-loop of TAP2. For example, the conserved glutamate (putative catalytic base) downstream of the Walker B motif in TAP1 is replaced by an aspartate, and the conserved histidine of the H-loop (switch region) of TAP1 interacting with the γ-phosphate of ATP is exchanged for glutamine (Fig. 1A). Most remarkably, these changes in TAP1 are coupled to alterations in the C-loop of TAP2, which is degenerate from the canonical LSGGQ sequence to LAAGQ (Fig. 1B). The serine in the C-loop is fully conserved among all human ABC transporters, and substitution of this residue is only found in TAP2 (Fig. 1B). In this study, we examined the contribution of the ABC signature motifs to the functional asymmetry of both TAP subunits by single site mutations and chimeras. Materials—8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP was purchased from ICN. Peptides used in this study were RRYQKSTEL (R9LQK) and RRYQNSTEL (N-glycosylation site is underlined).

Baculovirus Expression Constructs—Human TAP1 was cloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of pFastBacDual (Invitrogen) under the control of the polyhedrin promoter (pFastBacDual.TAP1wt). Human TAP2 was cloned into pFastBacDual in the XhoI and SphI sites downstream of the p10 promoter (pFastBacDual.TAP2wt). Site-directed mutations (L643A, TAP1; G646V, TAP1; G646D, TAP1; L607A, TAP2; G610V, TAP2; G610D, TAP2; S644A/G645A, TAP1; and A608S/A609G, TAP2) were introduced by sequence overlapping PCR using pFastBacDual.TAP1wt or pFastBacDual.TAP2wt as templates. The sequences of the sense oligonucleotides were as follows: 5′-GCTGGGAGCCAGGCGTCAGGGGGTCAG-3′ for TAP1L643A; 5′-CAGCTGTCAGGGGTTCAGCGACAGGCAG-3′ for TAP1G646V; 5′-CAGCTGTCAGGGGATCAGCGACAGGCAG-3′ for TAP1G646D; 5′-GGAAGCCAGGCGGCTGCGGGACAGAAAC-3′ for TAP2L607A; 5′-GCTGGCTGCGGTACAGAAACAACGTC-3′ for TAP2G610V; 5′-GCTGGCTGCGGACCAGAAACAACGTCTG-3′ for TAP2G610D; 5′-GCTGGGAGCCAGCTGGCAGCGGGTCAGCGACAGGCA-3′ for TAP1S644A/G645A; and 5′-GAAGGGAAGCCAGCTGTCTGGGGGACAGAAACAACG-3′ for TAP2A608S/A609G, respectively (mutated bases are underlined). The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutated TAP1 fragments were subcloned into the pFastBacDual.TAP2wt and vice versa, resulting in plasmids encoding both subunits (pFastBacDual.TAP1/TAP2). Recombinant Baculovirus, Virus Infection, and Preparation of Microsomes—Recombinant bacmid DNA was produced by transformation of the DH10Bac with pFastBacDual.TAP1/TAP2 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). To generate recombinant baculovirus, Sf9 insect cells were transfected with 5 μg of bacmid DNA using the BaculoGold transfection kit (BD Biosciences). After 7–9 days, the supernatant was harvested and used for further amplification of the virus. TAP mutants were expressed by infection of Sf9 cells with a multiplicity of infection of 3–5. Microsomes were prepared as described previously (24Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Peptide Binding and Transport—Peptide binding to TAP was performed using filter assays and 125I-labeled peptides as described previously (17Chen M. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29686-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Filter plates (MultiScreen plates with glass fiber filter, pore size 1 μm; Millipore) were pre-incubated with 100 μl of 0.3% polyethylene imine followed by incubation with 100 μl of 0.2% dialyzed bovine serum albumin. Radiolabeled peptides were incubated with TAP-containing microsomes (15 μg protein) in 50 μl of AP buffer (phosphate-buffered saline buffer and 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7) at 4 °C for 15 min. Microsomes were added to the filter plate and washed three times with 150 μl of ice-cold AP buffer. Radioactivity on the filters was determined by γ-counting. Background binding was determined in the presence of a 400-fold excess of unlabeled peptides. Specifically bound peptides were plotted against total peptide concentration and fitted with the Langmuir (1:1) binding equation, shown in Equation 1,B=Bmax×[P]KD+[P](Eq. 1) where B corresponds to the bound peptide, KD is the dissociation constant, [P] is the concentration of peptide, and Bmax is the maximal amount of bound peptides. In vitro transport assays were performed using the peptide RRYQNSTEL as described previously (17Chen M. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29686-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP Photo-cross-linking—Microsomes (100 μg protein) were suspended in 25 μl of transport buffer (20 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaN3, 1 mm ouabain, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 15% glycerol, pH 7.5) containing 2.5 μm of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. After 5 min of incubation on ice, samples were UV light-irradiated for 5 min at 4 °C. TAP was solubilized and disassembled by incubating with immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal, and 0.5% SDS, pH 7.5) at 37 °C for 15 min. TAP1 and TAP2 were immunoprecipitated separately by their respective antibodies, 1p2 and 2p3, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (17Chen M. Abele R. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29686-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Afterward, the proteins were transferred from the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was finally exposed to BIOMAX™ MS films (Kodak) with an intensifying screen at -80 °C. To check if equal amounts of TAP1 or TAP2 were immunoprecipitated, the same membranes were developed with monoclonal antibodies against TAP1 (148.3) or TAP2 (435.3). To ensure that only single subunits were immunoprecipitated, the antibodies were removed from the blot membrane by incubation for 20 min at 50 °C with stripping buffer (40 mm Tris, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5). Then, a second immunodetection was performed with polyclonal antibodies against TAP1 (1p2) or TAP2 (2p3). Single Site Mutants of the C-loop—It was recently shown that the NBDs from both TAP1 and TAP2 are required for a functional TAP complex (19Daumke O. Knittler M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Arora S. Lapinski P.E. Raghavan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7241-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and that peptide binding stimulates ATP hydrolysis in both subunits (13Gorbulev S. Abele R. Tampé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 29686-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Different transport activities of Walker A mutants indicate, however, a functional asymmetry of the two TAP subunits (14Lapinski P.E. Neubig R.R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7526-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Karttunen J.T. Lehner P.J. Gupta S.S. Hewitt E.W. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2001; 11: 242-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). TAP1 and TAP2 also show an asymmetry in their C-loops, LSGGQ versus LAAGQ. The serine residue and second glycine residue (underlined) of the C-loop (LSGGQ) contacting the γ-phosphate of ATP are highly conserved among members of the ABC superfamily, whereas the other positions in the C-loop are more divergent (Fig. 1). To examine the function of the different ABC signature motifs of both subunits, we first focused on the leucine and the highly conserved second glycine in the C-loop. The leucine, which is not in contact with ATP, is not as conserved as the remaining residues. In human ABC transporters, this residue is, in certain cases, replaced by bulky aromatic amino acids. Substitution of the leucine with the charged residue arginine eliminated the expression of the P-glycoprotein in Sf9 cells (25Bakos E. Klein I. Welker E. Szabo K. Muller M. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, we exchanged this leucine with alanine, a less bulky residue, to avoid similar problems. In addition, the invariant glycine was changed to valine or aspartate, because analogous mutations in the CFTR cause cystic fibrosis (26Cutting G.R. Kasch L.M. Rosenstein B.J. Zielenski J. Tsui L.C.

The equivalent mutations in the P-glycoprotein, the yeast pheromone transporter Ste6p and the Escherichia coli maltose permease decrease or interrupt the ATPase as well as the transport activity (28Panagiotidis C.H.

In our studies, all mutated half-transporters were combined with a wild type counterpart, which resulted in three pairs of mutants. These six TAP mutants are termed ASGGQ/wt versus wt/AAAGQ, LSGVQ/wt versus wt/LAAVQ, and LSGDQ/wt versus wt/LAADQ (mutated residues of TAP1/TAP2 are underlined). All TAP1 and TAP2 constructs were cloned into one baculovirus to circumvent the problem of double infections and expressed in Sf9 insect cells under the control of the polyhedrin and p10 promoter, respectively. Three days after infection, cells were harvested, and microsomes were isolated. The expression level of the TAP1 and TAP2 subunits and peptide binding capacity of different microsomes were analyzed and compared with the wild type protein. All of the constructs can be expressed in Sf9 cells (Fig. 2A). In microsomal preparations, the expression level of the various constructs varied by a factor of two. In correlation to wild type TAP, TAP1 of all mutants shows a slightly higher expression than TAP2 (Fig. 2B). As peptide binding of TAP requires both subunits (5van Endert P.M. Tampé R. Meyer T.H. Tisch R. Bach J.F. McDevitt H.O. Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 7-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we conclude that single TAP1 subunits are present in a slight excess. Single Site Mutations in the C-loop Affect neither Peptide nor ATP Binding to TAP—Peptide binding is a prerequisite for peptide transport (5van Endert P.M. Tampé R. Meyer T.H. Tisch R. Bach J.F. McDevitt H.O. Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 7-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and mutations in the Walker A motif of TAP were found to influence peptide binding at the transmembrane domain (15Karttunen J.T. Lehner P.J. Gupta S.S. Hewitt E.W. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7431-7436Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Saveanu L. Daniel S. van Endert P.M. J. Biol.

Therefore, we investigated whether these single site mutations in the C-loop have an impact on peptide binding. Binding affinities for the peptide R9LQK (RRYQKSTEL) were determined at 4 °C in the absence of ATP. As shown in Fig. 3, the data can be fitted according to a Langmuir (1:1) binding model for all TAP variants. The dissociation constant of wild type TAP was 270 nm, and all mutants showed similar peptide affinities (Table I). This finding demonstrates that the C-loop mutations do not affect the peptide-binding pocket. Because both subunits are essential for peptide binding, these results further demonstrate that these mutations do not interfere with the assembly of the heterodimeric TAP complex.Table IPeptide dissociation constants (KD) of C-loop mutants of TAP Mutated residues are underlined.TAP1/TAP2KDμmWild typewt/wt0.27 ± 0.06Single site mutantsASGGQ/wt0.50 ± 0.09LSGVQ/wt0.37 ± 0.13LSGDQ/wt0.36 ± 0.08wt/AAAGQ0.41 ± 0.10wt/LAAVQ0.30 ± 0.07wt/LAADAQ0.21 ± 0.06Chimeraswt/LSGGQ0.34 ± 0.02LAAGQ/wt0.27 ± 0.03LAAGQ/LSGGQ0.32 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab We further analyzed nucleotide binding of the C-loop mutants by 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP photo-cross-linking. After photo-cross-linking, the TAP complex was solubilized by Igepal and disrupted by SDS treatment. TAP1 and TAP2 were separately immunoprecipitated by polyclonal antibodies and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting and autoradiography. The amount of immunoprecipitated TAP was quantified by immunodetection in combination with enhanced chemiluminiscence. By a second immunodetection with an antibody specific for the other TAP subunit, it was ensured that only one of the two subunits was analyzed by autoradiography. For TAP1, degradation products corresponding to mini7TAP were visible (32Koch J. Guntrum R. Heintke S. Kyritsis C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10142-10147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). All TAP variants bound 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, which was competed out by an excess of ATP (Fig. 4). As the binding studies were performed at the KD of 8-azido-ATP (33Lapinski P.E. Raghuraman G. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8229-8237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the influence of the mutations on ATP binding can be directly studied by comparing the ratio of ATP photo-cross-linking to immunoprecipitated TAP1 or TAP2. As shown in Fig. 4, the normalized ratios for all C-loop TAP mutants are very similar. In summary, we concluded that these single site mutations do not influence ATP binding to TAP. This is in agreement with studies on single TAP subunits and TAP complexes, all showing similar affinities for ATP in the micromolar range (33Lapinski P.E. Raghuraman G. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8229-8237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Single Site Mutations of the C-loop Severely Affect Peptide Transport—All described C-loop mutants had no significant effect on peptide or ATP binding. Finally, the peptide transport activity of these C-loop mutants was investigated. In vitro peptide transport assays were performed as described using TAP-containing microsomes and the radiolabeled peptide RRYQNSTEL (9Neefjes J.J. Momburg F. Hämmerling G.J. Science. 1993; 261: 769-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 24Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the TAP concentration determined by immunoblotting was kept constant. In contrast to wild type TAP, we did not observe any transport activity for all mutants over a period of 2 min. Thus, the transport assay was extended to 5 min. Even under these prolonged transport periods all TAP complexes containing TAP1 mutants remained inactive (Fig. 5). In contrast, TAP complexes with mutated TAP2 transported peptides, albeit with much lower efficiency than wild type TAP. As these TAP mutants showed no difference in peptide or ATP binding, the loss of function must be related to disabled ATP hydrolysis. A Shift from the Canonical to the Degenerate C-loop Slows Down the ATP Hydrolysis—Based on the fact that the equivalent C-loop mutations in TAP1 and TAP2 described to date behaved differently, we focused on residues of the ABC signature motif that differ in TAP1 and TAP2 (LSGGQ versus LAAGQ). We studied TAP complexes containing two canonical C-loops (LSGGQ(wt)/LSGGQ), switched C-loops (LAAGQ/LSGGQ), or two degenerate C-loops (LAAGQ/LAAGQ(wt); mutated residues are underlined). Microsomes were prepared from insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus. The expression levels of all C-loop chimeras are similar, although the TAP2 levels in the mutated TAP complex were reduced in comparison to wild type (Fig. 6). We then studied the peptide binding of the C-loop chimeras using the same procedure as described above. The slightly reduced peptide-binding capacity of the TAP mutants correlates with the decreased TAP2 level (Fig. 6B), because only heterodimers of TAP1 and TAP2 can bind peptides (5van Endert P.M.

Immunity. 1994; 1: 7-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, all C-loop chimeras bind peptides with a similar affinity as that of wild type (Fig. 7 and Table I), demonstrating that the degenerate C-loop does not affect peptide binding.Fig. 7Peptide binding of the C-loop chimeras.

Herein, we investigated the HIF-1α-mediated gene expression of carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) in response to hypoxia and changes of intracellular calcium levels in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Decreasing the intracellular calcium level by BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid) induced HIF-1α nuclear accumulation and enhanced HIF-1 DNA binding within 1 h of incubation. Like hypoxia, BAPTA stimulated HIF-1-dependent transcription by increasing the activity of the C-terminal transactivation domain of HIF-1α and greatly enhanced expression of the HIF-1 target gene CA9. Detailed analysis of HIF-1α accumulation revealed that BAPTA attenuated the interaction of HIF-1α with von-Hippel-Lindau protein thus decreasing proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α. Knock down of HIF-1α mRNA and protein by small interference RNA for HIF-1α revealed that both hypoxia and the BAPTA-induced gene expression of CA9 were strictly dependent on HIF-1α. In contrast, elevation of cytosolic calcium level by thapsigargin reduced the BAPTA-mediated effects. Measurements of intracellular calcium under hypoxia revealed a change in the cellular calcium distribution. BAPTA-dependent induction of HIF-1 activity was not caused by its in vitro capability to chelate iron. Instead, effective chelation of cellular calcium caused the accumulation of HIF-1α protein through inhibition of HIF-prolyl hydroxylases and activated HIF-1-dependent gene expression under normoxic conditions.

HIF-1α is constitutively synthesized but sent to destruction by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in normoxia (6Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol.

Poellinger L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4298-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oxygen dependence of this process depends on the post-translational hydroxylation of HIF-1α at proline residues 564 and 402 by prolyl hydroxylases (13Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J.

Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3844) Google Scholar). Activity of these prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) requires oxygen. Thus, under hypoxic conditions when prolyl hydroxylation ceases, HIF-1α is not recognized by pVHL and evades degradation. In addition, trans-activity of HIF-1α is regulated by oxygen-sensitive hydroxylation of the asparagine residue 803 by a related asparagine hydroxylase called FIH-1 (15Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1α accumulates, translocates into the nucleus, and forms an active HIF-1 complex that turns on expression of target genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), erythropoietin, glucose transporter-1, and carbonic anhydrase (CA9) (16Wenger R.H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1151-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 17Bracken C.P. Whitelaw M.L. Peet D.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1376-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition to this well established O2-dependent activation mechanisms of HIF-1α, a role for changes in intracellular calcium levels in hypoxia-induced gene expression has been postulated. After prolonged hypoxic incubation, an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration was observed in some cell lines (18Arnould T. Michiels C. Alexandre I. Remacle J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19Mottet D. Michel G. Renard P. Ninane N. Raes M. Michiels C. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Increased calcium concentrations have been suggested to be involved in hypoxia-induced expression of tyrosine hydroxylase gene (23Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Furnari B.A. Lawson E.E. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol.

But unlike hypoxia or hypoxia-mimicking agents, the elevation of intracellular calcium concentration neither induced HIF-1α protein nor stimulated HIF-1-dependent transcription (27Salnikow K. Kluz T. Costa M. Piquemal D. Demidenko Z.N. Xie K. Blagosklonny M.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1734-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Instead, increased intracellular calcium activated VEGF expression through an AP-1-dependent pathway during hypoxia (26Damert A. Ikeda E. Risau W. Biochem.

Physiol. 2003; 194: 30-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) reported that elevated calcium levels after prolonged hypoxia increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2/1 (ERK 2/1) activation and increased HIF-1 transcriptional activity but did not induce HIF-1α accumulation. However, HIF-1α accumulation and activation is instantaneous upon the onset of hypoxia (28Jewell U.R. Kvietikova I. Scheid A. Bauer C. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1312-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), and it has not yet been clarified whether changes in intracellular calcium level play a role in this early phase of hypoxia. Herein, we studied the effect of decreased intracellular calcium level in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells on HIF-1 activation and expression of a typical HIF-1 target gene, carbonic anhydrase 9, under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Reagents—Me2SO and citric acid trisodium salt (dihydrate) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and desferoxamine mesylate (Desferal®) was from Novartis Pharma (Nuremberg, Germany). 2,2′-Dipyridyl, Chelex 100 (chelating resin; iminodiacetic acid), ferrous ammonium sulfate, 8-hydroxyquinoline, and propidium iodide were obtained from Sigma. BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetomethylester), BAPTA hexapotassium salt, thapsigargin, and the fluorescent dyes Oregon Green® 488 BAPTA-1-AM (OG-BAPTA-AM), Oregon Green® 488 BAPTA-1, hexapotassium salt, Fura-2-AM, and PhenGreen™ SK (PG SK, diacetate) were purchased from Molecular Probes Europe BV (Leiden, Netherlands). 1,10-Phenanthroline was obtained from Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell Culture Experiments and Hypoxic Induction—SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were kept in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Cambrex, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin in a normoxic atmosphere of 5% CO2 (by vol.) in air. Renal clear cell carcinoma cells RCC4 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. For cell culture experiments, cells were either exposed to normoxia or placed in a hypoxic incubator with 3% O2, 92% N2, 5% CO2 (Heraeus incubator, Hanau, Germany) for variable periods of time. Severe hypoxia was established by using anaerobic-culture jars with hydrogen- and CO2-generating envelopes (BD Biosciences). For manipulation of intracellular calcium levels, cells were incubated in medium supplemented with either 5 μm BAPTA-AM (stock solution: 50 mm in Me2SO) or 10 nm thapsigargin (stock solution: 1 mm in Me2SO) for the indicated periods of time. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell protein extracts were prepared from 35-mm dishes of cells that were about 80% confluent. Cells were lysed in 50-μl extraction buffer (300 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) for 20 min on ice and centrifuged (3600 × g at 4 °C for 5 min). The supernatant was used as whole cell extract, and the protein concentration was determined using a protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). 50 μg of protein per lane was loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and after electrophoresis blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Monoclonal anti-HIF-1α (diluted 1:250, BD Transduction Labotatories, San Diego, CA), anti-p53 (diluted 1:500, Oncogene, San Diego, CA), and anti-α-tubulin (diluted 1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) served as primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10000 dilution, Sigma) as the secondary antibody. ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from 60-mm dishes of subconfluent cells by using the method of Schreiber (29Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the HIF-1 binding site from the hypoxia response element (HRE; 5′-GCC CTA CGT GCT GTC TCA-3′) of the erythropoietin 3′ enhancer were end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP (ICN, Munich, Germany) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). DNA-protein binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl containing 5 μg of nuclear extract, 30 fmol of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides, and a nonspecific competitor (50 ng of calf-thymus DNA) in binding buffer (60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 12 mm HEPES, 4 mm Tris, pH 7.9) for 30 min at room temperature. 1 μg of monoclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) was added for supershift detection of the HIF-1 complex and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. The dried gels were exposed to x-ray films. Plasmid Constructs—The pH3SVL plasmid, containing six HIF-1-binding sites from the transferrin 3′ enhancer controlling the pGL3 vector (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) was generously provided by Roland Wenger (30Rolfs A. Kvietikova I. Gassmann M. Wenger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20055-20062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The empty vector without HIF-1-binding sites (pGL3 promoter or promoter/enhancer vector; Promega) served as a control to exclude unspecific activation of the reporter gene. To measure the activation of HIF-1α by its C terminus the Gal4 chimeric activator/reporter system was used in which the HIF-1α 775–826 C-terminal transactivation domain (C-TAD) is fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. The cytomegalovirus promoter ensures expression of the fusion protein. The reporter plasmid contains the luciferase gene under the control of Gal4 binding sites. Both plasmids of the chimeric activator/reporter system were generously provided by Peter Ratcliffe (31Pugh C.W. O'Rourke J.F. Nagao M. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11205-11214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Cell Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—1 × 107 SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with 10 μg of pH3SVL plasmids or control plasmid (Promega) or with 5 μg of Gal4-C-TAD and 15 μg of GAL4-Luc plasmids together by electroporation method at 975 microfarads, 250 V, in 0.4-mm thick cuvettes using a Gene Pulser and Capacitance Extender apparatus (Bio-Rad). After recovering, the cells were split in 18 aliquots and grown in 6-well dishes overnight. After treatment with BAPTA-AM or thapsigargin under normoxic or hypoxic atmosphere for 4 or 6 h, cells were lysed in a buffer made of 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerin, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.8. Luciferase activity was determined with the luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized to total cellular protein. Luciferase activity of the control vector without HIF-1 binding sites was not affected by hypoxia, BAPTA-AM, or thapsigargin treatment (data not shown). All transfections were at least done in three separate culture dishes; data are expressed as means ± S.D. Reverse Transcription and Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted with the guanidinium isothiocyanate method as described previously (32Stolze I. Berchner-Pfannschmidt U. Freitag P. Wotzlaw C. Rossler J. Frede S. Acker H. Fandrey J. Blood. 2002; 100: 2623-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with oligo(dT) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Human CA9 cDNA and cDNA of the housekeeping gene 60 S acidic ribosomal protein were quantified by real time PCR using the qPCR™ Mastermix for SYBR Green I (Eurogentec, Verviers, Belgium) and the GeneAmp5700 sequence Detection System (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The PCR reactions were set up in a final volume of 25 μl with 0.5 μl of cDNA, in 1× reaction buffer with SYBR Green I, 10 pmol of forward and 10 pmol of reverse primer. The primers used were as follows: human CA9, forward 5′-CAC GTG GTT CAC CTC AGC AC-3′ and reverse 5′-CAG CGA TTT CTT CCA AGC G-3′; human 60 S acidic ribosomal protein: forward: 5′-ACG AGG TGT GCA AGG AGG GC-3′ and reverse: 5′-GCA AGT CGT CTC CCA TCT GC-3. The PCR amplification profile was as follows: 10 min at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Agarose gel electrophoresis, purification, and DNA sequencing confirmed the identity of the PCR products. 1:10 dilutions of purified PCR products starting at 1 pg to 0.1 fg were used as standards. The quantified cDNA of the CA9 was normalized to cDNA of the 60 S acidic ribosomal protein and expressed as normalized CA9 mRNA level. All RT-PCRs were done in triplicate from RNA from three separate culture dishes. Data are the means ± S.D. RNA Interference Treatment—For HIF-1α siRNA experiments 1 × 107 SH-SY5Y cells were electroporated with 20 μm double-stranded antisense oligonucleotides specific for HIF-1α mRNA (antisense: 5′-ACA CAC UGU GUC CAG UUA G-3′; sense: 5′-CUA ACU GGA CAC AGU GUG U-3′; GenBank™ accession number: HIF-1α NM_001530) or scrambled sequence siRNA control duplexes II (MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). Control cells were electroporated without oligonucleotides under the same conditions. After electroporation the cells were split in 15 aliquots and grown in 6-well dishes (final concentration of siRNA oligonucleotides: 200 nm) for 24 h and then exposed to normoxic or hypoxic atmosphere for the indicated time. Cells were lysed, and total RNA or protein was extracted as described above. In Vitro Protein Interaction Assay—The impact of BAPTA on recombinant HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) was studied by the in vitro protein interaction assays as described previously (33Metzen E. Zhou J. Jelkmann W. Fandrey J. Brune B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3470-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The assay makes use of the interaction between the C-terminal oxygen degradation domain of HIF-1α (ODD, amino acids 549–582) and pVHL, which requires the presence of hydroxyproline in the ODD. To test hydroxylase-dependent effects of BAPTA on HIF-1α-pVHL interaction in normoxia, we produced GalDBD-HIF-1α549–582, PHD2, and 35S-labeled pVHL in T7-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega). GalDBD-HIF-1α549–582 was purified with GalDBD antibodies conjugated to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and suspended in a reaction buffer (5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) supplemented with cofactors (1 mm ascorbate, 1 mm α-ketoglutarate, 20 μm FeCl2). GalDBD-HIF-1α549–582 was then incubated for 30 min with BAPTA hexapotassium salt (final concentration, 10–500 μm) or either with 200 μm CaCl2 or FeCl2 before recombinant PHD2 expressed in reticulocyte lysate was added. The reaction was terminated after 30 min by addition of desferoxamine mesylate (final concentration, 100 μm). Streptavidine-agarose was added, and incubations went on for 16 h on an end-over-end rotator at 4 °C. Unbound 35S-pVHL was removed by washing, beads were boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the supernatant was subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. Bound 35S-pVHL was detected by autoradiography. The VHL gene contains an internal in-frame methionine at codon 54, thus two pVHL isoforms were regularly detected. In all experiments unprogrammed reticulocyte lysates served as negative controls. To test for hydroxylase-independent effects of BAPTA during protein interactions, we incubated a synthetic peptide resembling the biotinylated hydroxyproline ODD (Biosyntan, Berlin, Germany) with 35S-labeled pVHL expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Immunofluorescence Studies—SH-SY5Y cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 24-well dishes overnight. Subconfluent cells were fixed by ice-cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for 5 min on ice and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. As primary antibody the mouse monoclonal anti-HIF-1α (1:50 dilution, BD Transduction Laboratories) and as secondary antibody an Alexa-568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400, Molecular Probes) antibody was used. Coverslips were mounted on the slides with Mowiol (Calbiochem). Visualization was performed with a Nikon E1000 microscope (Nikon, Düsseldorf, Germany), equipped with a charge-coupled digital camera (Optronics, Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany) and the image acquisition software EZ2000 (Coord, Utrecht, Netherlands). Fluorescence emission was encoded in gray levels shading from black (low intensity of emission) over gray to white (high intensity of emission). Determination of the Effect of Intracellular Chelatable Iron on the Fluorescence of OG-BAPTA and PG SK by Laser Scanning Microscopy—SH-SY5Y cells were cultivated for 24 h on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips. Cells grown on coverslips were transferred to a modified Pentz chamber, which was described earlier (34Pentz S. Horler H. J. Microsc. 1992; 167: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with warm (37 °C) HBSS (137.0 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 25.0 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and then loaded with calcium indicator Oregon Green® 488 BAPTA-1-AM (OG-BAPTA-AM, 5.0 μm; stock solution: 5 mm in Me2SO) for 30 min at 37 °C in HBSS. Loading of the cells with the fluorescent iron indicator PG SK (Phen Green SK, 20 μm of the diacetate for 10 min in HBSS, 37 °C) was performed as described previously (35Petrat F. de Groot H. Sustmann R. Rauen U. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Afterward, the cells were washed twice with HBSS and incubated for 5 min (experiments with OG-BAPTA-AM) or 15 min (experiments with PG SK) in the absence of the probes, respectively, and subsequently covered with HBSS (37 °C). Fluorescence was measured with a laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with an argon and a helium/neon laser. The objective lens was a 63× numerical aperture 1.40 Plan-Apochromat. The pinhole was set at 118 μm, giving confocal optical slices of about 1.0 μm in thickness. Green fluorescence of OG-BAPTA-AM and PG SK, respectively, excited at 488 nm using the argon laser power supply at 6.75 milliwatts was collected through a 505-nm long-pass filter at 10-min intervals. Image processing and evaluation were performed using the “Physiology Evaluation” software of the LSM 510 imaging system (36Petrat F. de Groot H. Rauen U. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The intracellular level of chelatable iron was manipulated 5–10 min after the beginning of the measurements by addition of the highly membrane-permeable FeCl3:8-hydroxyquinoline complex (8-HQ, 10.0 μm) or membrane-permeable iron chelators (2.0 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 5 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl, or 10 mm desferoxamine mesylate, Desferal®) to the supernatant (35Petrat F. de Groot H. Sustmann R. Rauen U. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 37Petrat F. Rauen U. de Groot H. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Determination of the Effect of Chelatable Iron Ions on the Fluorescence of OG-BAPTA in Cell-free Systems—The effect of Fe2+ and Fe3+ on the fluorescence of OG-BAPTA (Oregon Green® 488 BAPTA-1, hexapotassium salt) was determined in two different media: 1) a simple buffered solution containing 2 mm ascorbate (freshly prepared) in imidazole buffer (10 mm), pH 7.2, and 2) a medium designed to simulate the composition of the cytosol (37Petrat F. Rauen U. de Groot H. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This “cytosolic” medium, which is rich in physiological iron-chelating ligands and reductants, contained 100 mm KCl, 5 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm MgCl2, the full amino acid composition contained in minimum essential medium Eagle (from Sigma), 6.85 mm glucose, 1.5 mm lactate, 230 μm citrate, 138 μm pyruvate, 2.99 mm inorganic phosphate, 4 mm ATP, 4.5 mm glutathione, and 2 mm ascorbate (both freshly prepared), and 10 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.2 (37Petrat F. Rauen U. de Groot H. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). All components of the media were dissolved in double-distilled water. The final media were treated with Chelex 100 to minimize their heavy metal contamination. Aliquots (3 ml) of the “cytosolic” medium, the simple buffered solution or “interaction medium” (containing reaction buffer, cofactors, and reticulocyte lysate) from the in vitro HIF-1α-pVHL interaction assay (diluted 1:100) were transferred into a modified Pentz chamber (37 °C), and OG-BAPTA (5.0 μm final concentration) was added and mixed with the media. The fluorescence of OG-BAPTA was determined as described for the cellular measurements (but at 30-s intervals) using the laser-scanning microscope. The quenching effect of Fe2+ on the fluorescence of the dye was determined by adding 50 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate from a freshly prepared stock solution (1 mm) in distilled water supplemented with 20 mm ascorbate (35Petrat F. de Groot H. Sustmann R. Rauen U. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Fe3+ was added as FeCl3 or as ferrous ammonium sulfate from a normoxic stock solution (1.0 mm) without ascorbate. Due to the rapid autoxidation of Fe2+ ions in aqueous solutions at neutral pH, this solution exclusively contained ferric iron ions as confirmed using the ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange assay (38Wolff S.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 182-189Crossref Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Experiments with Fe3+ were performed in the absence of the reducing equivalents ascorbate and glutathione within the media. Ca2+ Measurements in SH-SY5Y Cells by OG-BAPTA-AM Fluorescence Microscopy—SH-SY5Y cells were grown to 80% confluence on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 6-well dishes overnight and placed in a modified Pentz chamber. Cells were loaded with the calcium indicator Oregon Green® 488 BAPTA-1-AM (OG-BAPTA-AM, final concentration 5 μm) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice and incubated for another 10 min. Durin"
https://openalex.org/W2164726947,"In the Trypanosomatidae, trypanothione has subsumed many of the roles of glutathione in defense against chemical and oxidant stress. Crithidia fasciculata lacks glutathione S-transferase, but contains an unusual trypanothione S-transferase activity that is associated with eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1B (eEF1B). Here we describe the cloning, expression, and reconstitution of the purified α, β, and γ subunits of eEF1B from Leishmania major. Individual subunits lacked trypanothione S-transferase activity. Only eEF1B, formed by reconstitution or co-expression of the three subunits, was able to conjugate a variety of electrophilic substrates to trypanothione or glutathionylspermidine, but not glutathione. In contrast to the C. fasciculata eEF1B, the L. major enzyme also displayed peroxidase activity against a variety of organic hydroperoxides. The enzyme showed no activity with hydrogen peroxide and greatest activity with linoleic acid hydroperoxide (1 unit mg–1). Kinetic studies suggest a ternary complex mechanism, with Km values of 140 μm for trypanothione and 7.4 mm for cumene hydroperoxide and kcat = 25 s–1. Immunofluorescence studies indicate that the enzyme may be localized to the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. These results suggest that, in addition to its role in protein synthesis, the Leishmania eEF1B may help protect the parasite from lipid peroxidation. In the Trypanosomatidae, trypanothione has subsumed many of the roles of glutathione in defense against chemical and oxidant stress. Crithidia fasciculata lacks glutathione S-transferase, but contains an unusual trypanothione S-transferase activity that is associated with eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1B (eEF1B). Here we describe the cloning, expression, and reconstitution of the purified α, β, and γ subunits of eEF1B from Leishmania major. Individual subunits lacked trypanothione S-transferase activity. Only eEF1B, formed by reconstitution or co-expression of the three subunits, was able to conjugate a variety of electrophilic substrates to trypanothione or glutathionylspermidine, but not glutathione. In contrast to the C. fasciculata eEF1B, the L. major enzyme also displayed peroxidase activity against a variety of organic hydroperoxides. The enzyme showed no activity with hydrogen peroxide and greatest activity with linoleic acid hydroperoxide (1 unit mg–1). Kinetic studies suggest a ternary complex mechanism, with Km values of 140 μm for trypanothione and 7.4 mm for cumene hydroperoxide and kcat = 25 s–1. Immunofluorescence studies indicate that the enzyme may be localized to the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. These results suggest that, in addition to its role in protein synthesis, the Leishmania eEF1B may help protect the parasite from lipid peroxidation. Parasitic protozoa of the family trypanosomatidae cause disease and death throughout the tropical and subtropical world. Trypanosoma brucei infections are estimated to cause ∼400,000 cases of sleeping sickness per year; Trypanosoma cruzi, the cause of Chagas' disease, chronically infects ∼17 million people and Leishmania spp. are thought to cause 2 million cases of leishmaniasis per year. 1World Health Organization (www.who.int/en/). Current chemotherapies for these diseases are, on the whole, ineffective and toxic (2Fairlamb A.H. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 488-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 3Croft S.L. Coombs G.H. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), whereas effective vaccines may never be developed. The development of effective treatments for these infections is therefore an urgent necessity. New anti-parasitic drugs can be developed from inhibitors of biochemical pathways that are essential for parasite survival but absent from the host. One such target is the thiol metabolism of trypanosomatids. Uniquely, this is dependent upon trypanothione (N1,N8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine or T[SH]2) 2The abbreviations used are: T[SH]2 and T[S]2, trypanothione and trypanothione disulfide, respectively; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TST, trypanothione S-transferase; TryX, tryparedoxin; GPX, glutathione peroxidase; eEF1B, eukaryotic elongation factor 1B complex (formerly eEF-1βγδ; eEF1Bα formerly eEF-1β; eEF1Bβ formerly eEF-1δ; and eEF1Bγ formerly eEF-1γ); CuOOH, cumene hydroperoxide; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BiP, immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein; CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene.

Science. 1985; 227: 1485-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), whereas their human hosts use glutathione ((γ-l-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine or GSH). Trypanothione is involved in protective processes, defending against oxidative stress through peroxidase systems (5Flohe L. Hecht H.J. Steinert P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 966-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), against reactive aldehydes through the glyoxalase system (6Irsch T. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 371-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Vickers T.J. Greig N. Fairlamb A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 27246-27256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All these processes depend upon trypanothione being maintained in its dithiol form by trypanothione reductase. This NADPH-dependent flavoenzyme is essential to the trypanosomatids (9Tovar J. Wilkinson S. Mottram J.C. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10Dumas C. Ouellette M. Tovar J. Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Tamar S. Olivier M. Papadopoulou B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2590-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) as, in these organisms, it is the only known route for the transfer of reducing equivalents from NADPH to low molecular mass thiols. In addition, because these parasites lack an equivalent to thioredoxin reductase, T[SH]2 also reduces their orthologues of thioredoxins, the tryparedoxins (TryX) (5Flohe L. Hecht H.J. Steinert P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 966-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The role of T[SH]2 in the defense against oxidative stress is particularly important, as reactive oxygen species are critical to the host-parasite interaction (11Nathan C. Shiloh M.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8841-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several of the clinically used drugs, such as the antimonials used to treat leishmaniasis, and the nitroimidazoles and nitrofurans used to treat Chagas' disease, may all act through the induction of oxidative stress (12Fries D.S. Fairlamb A.H. Abraham D.J. Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery: Chemotherapeutic Agents. John Wiley & Sons, New York2003: 1033-1087Google Scholar). Trypanosomatids lack catalase and selenium-dependent peroxidases and are unusually dependent upon a set of thiol-dependent peroxidases (5Flohe L. Hecht H.J. Steinert P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 966-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These enzymes fall into two classes, both of which are thought to contain a redox-active cysteine residue in their active sites that is reduced by their first substrate and then oxidized by the hydroperoxide second substrate (13Nogoceke E. Gommel D.U. Kiess M. Kalisz H.M. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 14Hillebrand H. Schmidt A. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol.

However, they vary in their abilities to metabolize aryl and alkyl hydroperoxides, such as cumene hydroperoxide (CuOOH). Recently, a second class of peroxidases has been discovered in T. cruzi (18Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Kelly J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Taylor M.C. Bromley E.V. Miles M.A. Kelly J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 6809-6815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with higher activity toward hydrophobic hydroperoxides. These are homologues of the selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase (GPX), with the active site selenocysteine being replaced by a cysteine residue. However, with the exception of the T. cruzi GPX II (20Wilkinson S.R. Taylor M.C. Touitha S. Mauricio I.L. Meyer D.J. Kelly J.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), these enzymes use TryX, rather than GSH as their preferred reductant (14Hillebrand H. Schmidt A. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6809-6815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Taylor M.C. Bromley E.V. Miles M.A. Kelly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17062-17071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, another class of enzymes that are important in the metabolism of hydrophobic hydroperoxides are the glutathione S-transferases or GSTs. The GSTs are detoxification enzymes that catalyze the nucleophilic attack of GSH on a wide variety of hydrophobic substrates (23Mannervik B. Danielson U.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 283-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). These enzymes can therefore not only reduce the phospholipid hydroperoxides generated during lipid peroxidation (24Hurst R. Bao Y.P. Jemth P. Mannervik B. Williamson G. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 25Sun Q. Komura S. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 39: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar), but they can also detoxify the reactive aldehydes such as 4-hydroxynon-2-enal produced by the breakdown of these oxidized lipids (26Berhane K. Widersten M. Engstrom A. Kozarich J.W. Mannervik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1480-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Recently, a trypanothione S-transferase (TST) activity was detected in several members of the trypanosomatidae and purified from Crithidia fasciculata. The TST complex was identified as the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1B (eEF1B), which is involved in ribosomal protein synthesis, and the TST active site localized to the γ subunit (eEF1Bγ) (8Vickers T.J. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27246-27256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Previous studies in other organisms had shown that the other two subunits (eEF1Bα and -β) of eEF1B act to recycle translation elongation factor 1A complexed with GDP back to the active GTP-complexed form (27van Damme H.T. Amons R. Karssies R. Timmers C.J. Janssen G.M. Moller W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Janssen G.M. Moller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The S-transferase activity of eEF1Bγ suggests possible roles of this subunit in translational responses to oxidative and xenobiotic stress. In this paper we describe the expression of the three subunits of the Leishmania major eEF1B and the reconstitution and enzymatic characterization of the complex. The eEF1B holocomplex, but not the isolated subunits, was able to catalyze the conjugation of T[SH]2 to a variety of electrophiles, being most active with hydrophobic hydroperoxides. Materials—Thymine hydroperoxide was synthesized from 5-hydroxymethyluracil and purified as described (29Hahn B.S. Wang S.Y. J. Org. Chem. 1976; 41: 567-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Linoleic acid hydroperoxide (13(S)-hydroperoxy-9(Z),11(E)-octadecadieonic acid) was synthesized using soybean lipoxidase and purified as described (30Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Ursini F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Recombinant T. cruzi trypanothione reductase was purified as previously described (31Borges A. Cunningham M.L. Tovar J. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). L. major Friedlin A1 clone promastigotes and C. fasciculata chanomastigotes were cultured as described (32Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Trypanothione disulfide (T[S]2) and glutathionylspermidine disulfide were purchased from Bachem. Cloning of L. major eEF1B Subunits—The genes encoding the L. major eEF1B subunits were identified in the L. major genome data base (www.genedb.org). The eEF1Bα gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA, using the sense primer 5′-CATATGTCCACCCTCAAGGAAGTCAAC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GGATCCTTAAATCTTGTTCCAGGCGACGA-3′. The PCR product was then cloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO plasmid using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen) and fully sequenced. Similarly, an eEF1Bβ gene was amplified and cloned using the sense primer 5′-CATATGTCTCTGAAGGACGTGAGCAAGAAG-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GGATCCTCAGATCTTGTTCCAGGCGACGA-3′ and the eEF1Bγ gene using the sense primer 5′-CATATGACCTACAAGCTCCTCGCCC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GGATCCTTACTTGAAGCAGCGGCCCTC-3′. These primers added 5′ NdeI sites and 3′ BamHI sites (underlined), allowing subcloning of these three genes into the expression plasmid pET3aTr (33Tan S. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 21: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and, in addition, the eEF1Bβ gene into pET15b (Novagen). The polycistronic expression construct pST39.eEF1B was assembled by the insertion of these three genes into translation cassettes 1, 2, and 4 of the polycistronic expression vector pST39 (33Tan S. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 21: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). First, the eEF1Bβ gene was excised from pET15b.eEF1Bβ by digestion with XbaI and BamHI, this removed a fragment containing the plasmid 5′-untranslated region and the eEF1Bβ gene as an in-frame fusion with the vector-derived N-terminal hexahistidine tag. This fragment was then ligated into the corresponding sites of pST39, to create the plasmid pST39.eEF1Bβ. Similarly, the eEF1Bα gene was excised by EcoRI and HindIII digestion from pET3aTr.eEF1Bα and ligated into these sites in the pST39.eEF1Bβ plasmid, to create pST39.eEF1Bαβ. The eEF1Bγ gene was then re-amplified, using the pET3aTr.eEF1Bγ plasmid as template, the sense primer 5′-CCCGGGTTGGAATTCGCTAGCTCTAGAAATAAT-3′, and the antisense primer 5′-CTCGAGTTACTTGAAGCAGCGGCCCTC-3′. These primers amplified a fragment containing the pET3aTr 5′-untranslated region and added a 5′ XmaI site and a 3′ XhoI site (underlined), allowing subcloning into the BspEI and XhoI sites of the pST39.eEF1Bαβ plasmid, to create pST39.eEF1B. Expression and Purification of eEF1B Subunits—The pET3aTr. eEF1Bα, -β, and -γ plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLys-S Escherichia coli. These were grown at 37 °C in LB media containing 100 μg ml–1 carbenicillin and 12.5 μgml–1 chloramphenicol to an OD of 0.6. After cooling to 25 °C, expression was induced for 4 h with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-galactopyranoside and the cells then harvested and frozen. All three eEF1B subunits were expressed as untagged proteins from pET3aTr and purified by anion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. Unless otherwise specified, all procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in a final volume of 30 ml of lysis buffer (75 mm (Na+) phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm benzamidine, 3 μgml–1 leupeptin, 250 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin A) to which dithiothreitol and EDTA were added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were then lysed by sonication (4 × 30-s bursts), with cooling to <4 °C between pulses. After centrifugation (45,000 × g, 1 h), the supernatant was applied at 2 ml min–1 to a 25-ml (1.6 × 8 cm) Q-Sepharose HP anion-exchange column equilibrated in either buffer A (20 mm (Na+) histidine, pH 6) for eEF1Bα and -β, or buffer B (25 mm (Na+) bis-Tris, pH 6.5) for eEF1Bγ. The column was washed for 30 min and bound proteins were then eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl, in the same buffer. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled and concentrated to 5 ml. This sample was then applied to a 319-ml (2.6 × 60 cm) Superdex 200 26/60 size-exclusion column equilibrated with buffer C (50 mm (Na+) HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.01% (w/v) NaN3) and eluted at a flow rate of 2 ml min–1. Complex Reconstitution—Purified eEF1B subunits were mixed at a final concentration of 50 μm in 400 μl of buffer C containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. The mixtures were either separated by size-exclusion chromatography, as described below, or dialyzed for 1 h against 1 liter of buffer B and applied at 2 ml min–1 to a 1-ml (0.64 × 3 cm) Resource Q anion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer B. Bound proteins were then eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in buffer B. Polycistrionic Expression and Complex Purification—BL21(DE3) pLys-S E. coli, transformed with pST39.eEF1B, were grown and protein expression was induced, as before. The cells were lysed, as described above, in lysis buffer modified by the addition of 500 mm NaCl and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. After centrifugation (45,000 × g, 1 h), the supernatant was applied at 2 ml min–1 to a nickel-charged 5-ml HiTrap chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer D (50 mm (Na+) phosphate, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl) and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm imidazole in buffer D. Fractions containing eEF1B were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of buffer B containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, and then further purified by anion-exchange chromatography using a 25-ml Q-Sepharose HP column in buffer B, as before. Physical Characterization of Proteins—Subunit masses were measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a Voyager-DE STR (PerSeptive Biosystems). The relative molecular masses (Mr) of complexes were measured by size-exclusion chromatography using a 24-ml (1 × 30 cm) Superdex 200 HR 10/30 size-exclusion column equilibrated with buffer C, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min–1. Carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa) were used as standards. Production of Antiserum Against C. fasciculata eEF1B and Immunoblot Analysis—A polyclonal antiserum was raised in BALB/c mice against the purified C. fasciculata eEF1B complex (34Cooper H.M. Paterson Y. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology, Volume 3. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 2.4.1-2.4.9Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 106) from C. fasciculata and L. major cultures were harvested and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was then performed, essentially as described (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using a 1:10,000 dilution of the primary polyclonal antiserum and a 1:5000 dilution of secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, Sigma). Bound antibodies were detected using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunolocalization of L. major eEF1B—L. major promastigotes were washed twice in PBS before being dried onto polylysine-coated microscope slides. The cells were then fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, followed by methanol at –20 °C for 2 min. Following a 30-min incubation in PBS containing 1% (w/v) saponin and 1 mg ml–1 heat-treated RNase, the fixed cells were incubated in PBS containing 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum for 5 min. The cells were then co-labeled with anti-C. fasciculata eEF1B antiserum (1:500 in PBS) and anti-T. brucei BiP antiserum (1:200 in PBS; raised in rabbits against the T. brucei homologue of immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP); a gift from James D. Bangs, University of Wisconsin-Madison Medical School, Madison, WI). Following incubation for 1 h in a dark humid chamber, the slides were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h in fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antiserum (1:500 in PBS, Sigma) and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antiserum (1:500 in PBS, Sigma). The slides were washed with PBS before being mounted using the SlowFade Light Antifade kit with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Images were collected using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M fluorescence microscope. Enzyme Assay—TST was assayed at 25 °C in 100 mm (Na+) phosphate, pH 6.5, using either a Shimadzu UV-2401 PC or a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. In the standard assay T[SH]2 was produced immediately before use by mixing T[S]2 (Bachem) with a 2-fold excess of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and a 5-fold excess of NaOH. One unit of TST activity corresponds to 1 μmol of sulfhydryl group conjugated per min. Unless otherwise noted, the activities with these substrates were calculated using the published absorbance coefficients for the corresponding GSH conjugates. In the case of the peroxidase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and thioltransferase assays, TCEP was omitted and the required concentration of T[S]2, glutathionylspermidine disulfide (Bachem), or GSSG was reduced by 10 μg ml–1 trypanothione or glutathione reductase and a 150 μm excess of NADPH, before addition of the second substrate. Linoleic acid hydroperoxide assays contained 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in the final volume. The rate of these reactions was followed by observing the consumption of NADPH at 340 nm. Hydroperoxide concentrations were standardized using a modified TCEP assay for peroxide (36Han J. Yen S. Han G. Han P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 107-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples of hydroperoxide were reduced by 75 μm TCEP in 50 mm (Na+) Tris, pH 7.5. After a 5-min incubation at 25 °C, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) was added to 200 μm and the absorbance at 412 nm was used to calculate residual TCEP, using the extinction coefficient of 14.14 mm cm–1 for the TNB– anion (37Collier B. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 310-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). When this procedure was used to assay linoleic acid hydroperoxide, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 was included in the buffer. Nomenclature—In this paper we have used IUBMB nomenclature, with the elongation factor 1B complex (previously eEF-1βγδ) being referred to as eEF1B. The subunits of the complex are, in order of increasing size, elongation factor 1Bα (previously eEF-1β), referred to as eEF1Bα; elongation factor 1Bβ (previously eEF-1δ) referred to as eEF1Bβ, and elongation factor 1Bγ (previously eEF-1γ) referred to as eEF1Bγ. Cloning of L. major eEF1B Subunits—The L. major eEF1B subunit genes identified were the eEF1Bα gene, LmjF36.1430; two identical eEF1Bβ genes, LmjF34.0820 and LmjF34.0840; and the eEF1Bγ gene, LmjF09.0970. The predicted products of the eEF1Bα, -β, and -γ genes were 61, 68, and 67% identical to their T. cruzi homologues L12583, L12584, and P34715, respectively. In addition, the masses of the predicted products of these genes (23.2, 25.5, and 46.1 kDa, respectively) were very similar to the masses of the subunits of the purified C. fasciculata eEF1B complex (22.8, 26.5, and 46.3 kDa, respectively) (8Vickers T.J. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27246-27256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Purification and Characterization of the Subunits of L. major eEF1B—All three subunits of L. major eEF1B were expressed at a high level as soluble proteins from pET3aTr. This allowed the simple purification of these proteins by anion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography to more than 95% purity (Fig. 1). The masses of eEF1Bα and -β were significantly different from their apparent mass by SDS-PAGE (Table I). This has previously been noted for the C. fasciculata eEF1Bα and -β proteins and may relate to the low isoelectric points of these proteins (predicted pI values of 4.56 and 5.07 for L. major eEF1Bα and -β, respectively), as the anomalous migration in SDS-PAGE of other highly acidic proteins has been noted previously (38Graceffa P. Jancso A. Mabuchi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). All three subunits self-associated in solution, with the eEF1Bα and -β forming complexes of similar molecular mass. These may represent a eEF1Bα heptamer (predicted Mr 162,000) and a eEF1Bβ hexamer (predicted Mr 153,000).

Open table in a new tab Reconstitution of eEF1Bαβ and eEF1B Complexes—The purified subunits were co-incubated at 1:1 ratios in three pairwise combinations and one 1:1:1 eEF1Bα, -β, and -γ combination. Initially, these mixtures were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2). Only the ternary mixture formed a novel complex of Mr 540,000 (Fig. 2, closed squares), whereas no additional high molecular mass peaks were observed in any of the binary combinations. However, as separation of the individual subunits was not possible because of the similar Mr values of their homocomplexes, these data do not exclude the formation of other heterocomplexes. The four protein mixtures were therefore also separated by anion-exchange chromatography and this showed that an αβ heterocomplex was formed (data not shown). The subunit stoichiometries of the purified αβ and αβγ complexes were determined by SDS-PAGE and densitometry. This indicated that the αβ species contained the subunits in a 1:1 ratio and that the subunits in the αβγ complex were at a 1:1:2 ratio (Fig. 1). In combination with the Mr values of these complexes, this suggested that the species formed were an (αβ)4 octamer and an [αβ(γ2)]4 hexadecamer (Table I). The latter agrees with our previous analysis of eEF1B from C. fasciculata (8Vickers T.J. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27246-27256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Only the [αβ(γ2)]4 holocomplex showed TST activity with CDNB or CuOOH substrates (Table I). Polycistronic Expression of Recombinant L. major eEF1B Complex—As these reconstitution experiments indicated that all three subunits were required to form a complex with S-transferase activity, the three subunits were cloned into the pST39 polycistronic expression vector. The fusion of an N-terminal hexahistidine tag to eEF1Bβ allowed the simple purification of the eEF1B holocomplex by metal-affinity chromatography followed by anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 3A). The purified complex is more than 95% pure but appears to show some proteolytic degradation of the eEF1Bα subunit. The Mr of the recombinant complex was 570,000 and is identical, within the precision of the method, with the Mr of the holocomplex formed by reconstitution from the isolated subunits. Subcellular Localization of eEF1B—An antiserum was produced that detected all three subunits of the C. fasciculata eEF1B (Fig. 3B, lane 1). Immunoblotting of L. major extracts (Fig. 3B, lane 2) and recombinant L. major eEF1B (data not shown) showed that this antiserum cross-reacted with the eEF1Bβ and -γ subunits, but not the eEF1Bα subunit. This antiserum was therefore used to determine the subcellular localization of the L. major eEF1B by im"
https://openalex.org/W2148595039,"Class I ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides in mammals and many other organisms. The RNR subunit R2 contains a dinuclear iron center, which in its diferrous form spontaneously reacts with O2, forming a μ-oxo-bridged diferric cluster and a stable tyrosyl radical. Here, we present the first crystal structures of R2 from mouse with its native dinuclear iron center, both under reducing and oxidizing conditions. In one structure obtained under reducing conditions, the iron-bridging ligand Glu-267 adopts the μ-(η1,η2) coordination mode, which has previously been related to O2 activation, and an acetate ion from the soaking solution is observed where O2 has been proposed to bind the iron. The structure of mouse R2 under oxidizing conditions resembles the nonradical diferric R2 from Escherichia coli, with the exception of the coordination of water and Asp-139 to Fe1. There are also additional water molecules near the tyrosyl radical site, as suggested by previous spectroscopic studies. Since no crystal structure of the active radical form has been reported, we propose models for the movement of waters and/or tyrosyl radical site when diferric R2 is oxidized to the radical form, in agreement with our previous ENDOR study. Compared with E. coli R2, two conserved phenylalanine residues in the hydrophobic environment around the diiron center have opposing rotameric conformations, and the carboxylate ligands of the diiron center in mouse R2 appear more flexible. Together, this might contribute to the lower affinity and cooperative binding of iron in mouse R2.

Biol. 2001; 77: 177-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The RNR enzymes isolated so far have been grouped into three main classes based upon the different oxygen dependence and metal cofactors involved in the generation of the catalytically essential free radicals as well as structural differences (3Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 4Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Class I can further be subdivided into Ia and Ib based on differences in amino acid sequence (4Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Class Ia is found in eukaryotes and some bacteria and viruses, whereas class Ib is not found in eukaryotes. Class I RNRs are composed of two homodimeric protein subunits, termed R1 and R2 (2Eklund H.

Rev. 1998; 98: 705-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar); however, the R1 subunit of mouse RNR has been suggested to also occur in an active hexameric form (7Kashlan O.B. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1696-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In mammals, three genes for class Ia RNR have been identified, one gene for the large subunit, R1, and two isoforms of the small subunit, R2 and p53R2. Whereas the “normal” R2 is only present during replication of DNA in the S phase (8Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), p53R2 can be induced throughout the cell cycle by the signaling protein p53 in response to DNA damage (9Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) and probably also a p53-independent pathway (10Graff P. Seim J. Åmellem Ø. Arakawa H. Nakamura Y. Andersson K.K. Stokke T. Pettersen E.O. Cell Prolif. 2004; 37: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this work, we focus on the normal S phase-specific isoform of R2. The normal mammalian R2 has recently also been suggested to be an oncoprotein under hypoxia (10Graff P. Seim J. Åmellem Ø. Arakawa H. Nakamura Y. Andersson K.K. Stokke T. Pettersen E.O. Cell Prolif. 2004; 37: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Each R2 subunit contains a dinuclear iron center and a tyrosyl radical site (Tyr-177 in mouse R2) which are essential for initiation of the nucleotide reduction process taking place at the active site in R1. The diiron center of R2 can exist in different oxidation states. If molecular oxygen is allowed to react with the diferrous R2 (Fe(II)Fe(II)), it will spontaneously oxidize the diiron center through a series of intermediate states, leading to a μ-oxo-bridged diferric iron cluster (Fe(III)Fe(III)) and a stable tyrosyl radical. The dinuclear iron center is located within a four-helix bundle (11Nordlund P. Eklund H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and is coordinated by carboxylate (Glu/Asp) and histidine side chains from the four helices (12Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 13Nordlund P. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 123-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Very similar centers are found in many other proteins (e.g. the hydroxylase component of methane monooxygenase (MMOH) and Δ9-stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (Δ9-D)). All of these proteins have dinuclear iron centers that bind dioxygen, and together they form a family called diiron-oxygen proteins (14Andersson K.K. Gräslund A. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 43: 359-408Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar), but their biological roles are very different (11Nordlund P. Eklund H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 14Andersson K.K. Gräslund A. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 43: 359-408Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Wallar B.J. Lipscomb J.D.

Ed. 2001; 40: 2782-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar); MMOH oxidizes methane to methanol in methanotrophic bacteria, Δ9-D introduces a double bond into saturated fatty acids, and the R2 subunit of RNR generates, as mentioned above, a tyrosyl radical essential for the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides in eukaryotes and many bacteria and viruses. It is the first and second coordination sphere of the diiron center in each protein that determines the outcome of the reaction with oxygen. Therefore, it is of great interest to obtain detailed knowledge of the environment of the diiron center and compare it with iron-clusters from different proteins derived from various species. Although R2 from both mouse and Escherichia coli belongs to the same class of RNR (class Ia), the sequence identity is only ∼20% (18Thelander L. Gräslund A. Metal Ions Biol. Syst. 1994; 30: 109-129Google Scholar), and the iron-oxygen cluster in mouse R2 is much more labile compared with E. coli R2 (19Nyholm S. Mann G.J. Johansson A.G. Bergeron R.J. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26200-26205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are also significant differences in the spectroscopic properties (14Andersson K.K. Gräslund A.

The crystal structure of E. coli R2 has been solved for several different conditions (e.g. the reduced diferrous form (30Logan D.T. Su X.D. Åberg A. Regnström K. Hajdu J. Eklund H. Nordlund P.

Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 177-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar)). The x-ray structure of the active radical containing R2 protein, however, is not known. In a recent study combining single crystal EPR and x-ray crystallography on the same crystal, it was suggested that the tyrosine ring could be shifted by about 1 Å away from the diiron center in the radical state compared with the nonradical diferric state (32Högbom M. Galander M. Andersson M. Kolberg M. Hofbauer W. Lassmann G. Nordlund P. Lendzian F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3209-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The high resolution structure (1.4 Å) of the diferric R2 presented in that work showed that the two irons are five- and six-coordinated, respectively, whereas previous structures suggested two six-coordinated irons (12Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 13Nordlund P. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 123-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Also in the reduced form of R2, different coordination numbers for the irons have been proposed based on x-ray structures; the original structure suggested that both ferrous iron ions were four-coordinated (30Logan D.T. Su X.D. Åberg A. Regnström K. Hajdu J. Eklund H. Nordlund P. Structure. 1996; 4: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), but a more recent structure, which was obtained after iron reconstitution into apo-R2 crystals at neutral pH, suggested that the two irons here were best described as four- and five-coordinated, respectively (31Voegtli W.C.

Soc. 2003; 125: 15822-15830Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which is more consistent with, for example, CD and magnetic CD spectroscopic data (33Yang Y.-S. Baldwin J. Brenda A.L. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 8495-8510Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The first x-ray structure of the R2 protein from mouse was solved in 1996; however, under the crystallization conditions used (pH 4.7), only one of the two metal binding sites was partially occupied (site 2, Fe2; the site furthest away from the radical harboring tyrosine 177) (34Kauppi B. Nielsen B.B. Ramaswamy S. Kjøller-Larsen I. Thelander M. Thelander L. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recently, we published the first crystal structures of mouse R2 with fully occupied metal sites by soaking crystals in solutions of cobalt(II) at different pH values (35Strand K.R. Karlsen S. Andersson K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34229-34238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In agreement with the earlier results, only one metal ion was bound to the protein when the protein crystal was equilibrated at pH 4.7, but when the protein was soaked at pH 6.0, crystals with two fully occupied metal ion sites were obtained. In this work, we describe the first crystal structures of mouse R2 with intact native dinuclear iron center, both under reducing and oxidizing conditions. We observe interesting carboxylate shifts of the carboxylate ligands, showing a very flexible structure around the dinuclear iron center. Under reducing conditions, the bridging ligand Glu-267 of mouse R2 adopts the μ-(η1,η2) coordination mode, which is postulated to be very important for proper oxygen activation (36Andersson M.E.

Based on these new structural data, we discuss the observed differences in the spectroscopic data for the class I RNR enzymes. All commercial reagents were used as obtained: sodium acetate (Sigma), ammonium iron(II) sulfate ((NH4)2Fe(II)(SO4)2·6H2O) (Merck), methylviologen (1,1′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium dichloride hydrate) (Sigma), sodium dithionite (Aldrich), 96% glycerol (Prolabo), phenosafranine (Aldrich), sodium l-ascorbate (Sigma), and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate/potassium dihydrogen phosphate (Merck). Cloned mouse apo-R2 protein was prepared and purified as reported earlier (37Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The protein was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at pH 4.7 according to the previously published protocol (38Nielsen B.B. Kauppi B. Thelander M. Thelander L. Kjøller-Larsen I. Eklund H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The crystals were shaped like thin sheets with a size of up to 0.05 × 0.10 × 0.50 mm and belong to space group C2221. Reducing Conditions—For Structure 1, a 10-μl solution of (NH4)2Fe(II)(SO4)2 was added to crystals of apo-R2 protein in 10 μl of mother liquor (pH 4.7) (final iron concentration 5 mm) and incubated for about 3 h. The (NH4)2Fe(II)(SO4)2 solution consisted of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) to which the redox mediator methylviologen and phosphate-buffered (pH 6.0) redox agent sodium dithionite was added, giving a final concentration of 2 mm methylviologen and 0.5% dithionite in the crystal soaking solution. The methylviologen works also as a redox indicator, since its blue color would disappear in the presence of oxygen. The final pH in the soaking solution was measured with pH paper to pH 6.0. One crystal was then moved to a cryosolution (mother liquor containing 25% glycerol and 0.5% sodium dithionite solution, pH 6.0) for 30 s, mounted in a rayon loop, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Two other batches of reduced crystals were obtained where the iron(II) solution was modified to contain either 2 mm sodium ascorbate as reducing agents and 2 mm phenosafranine as redox indicator (Structure 3) or unbuffered 0.5% sodium dithionite (Structure 4) as reducing agent and no redox indicator. Oxidizing Conditions—For Structure 2, a 10-μl solution of (NH4)2Fe(II)(SO4)2 was added to crystals of apo-R2 protein in 10 μl of mother liquor (pH 4.7) (final iron concentration 5 mm) and incubated for about 3 h. The (NH4)2Fe(II)(SO4)2 solution consisted of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5), sodium ascorbate (final concentration 2 mm), and phenosafranine (final concentration 2 mm) as redox indicator, since an excess of oxygen changed the color of the solution from yellow to red. One crystal was then moved to an aerobic cryosolution (mother liquor containing 25% glycerol) for 30 s, mounted in a rayon loop, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The final pH in the soaking solution was measured to pH 6.0. Several diffraction data sets were collected at MAXII-I711 in Lund, the Swiss-Norwegian beam line (BM1) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, and at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron in Hamburg (see Table I). All data sets were processed and scaled using Denzo and Scalepack (39Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar), and a mouse apo-R2 protein structure (34Kauppi B. Nielsen B.B. Ramaswamy S. Kjøller-Larsen I. Thelander M.

The CNS program suite (40Brüger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. GrosseKunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nigles M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L.

The electron density maps and omit maps clearly showed electron density for iron ions in all of the structures in the previously described metal binding site 1 and 2 in R2. The iron ions were included in the coordinate files, and water molecules were added to the model in positions with well defined electron density and reasonable hydrogen bond geometries and refined in CNS.

Quality of the Models—In this paper, we describe the x-ray crystal structures of the dinuclear Fe-R2 center formed under reducing (Structure 1 in Table I) and oxidizing (Structure 2 in Table I) conditions. Data from two additional structures obtained under different reducing conditions are also presented in Table I (Structures 3 and 4). The Ramachandran plots for Structures 1 and 2 reveal that between 91.9 and 94.2% of the nonglycine and nonproline residues are in the most favored regions for the reduced and oxidized structure, respectively. Just a single residue, in a flexible loop of Structure 1 with diffuse electron density, is in the generously allowed regions. The mean coordinated error for the structures calculated from the method of Luzzati is between 0.27 and 0.28 Å. Just as for the mono-Fe-R2 (34Kauppi B. Nielsen B.B. Ramaswamy S. Kjøller-Larsen I. Thelander M. Thelander L. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the N-terminal (residues 1–67) and C-terminal (residues 349–390) ends are poorly resolved or not visible at all in the electron density maps due to large flexibility. In both the reduced and oxidized structures, some areas of the structures show very high B-factors and occasionally poorly defined electron density, typically in the loop area residues, 111–125, 186–193, 196–203, and 306–312. The electron density maps are of better quality around the diiron cluster. Compared with the mono-Fe structure of mouse R2 (at pH 4.7) (34Kauppi B. Nielsen B.B. Ramaswamy S. Kjøller-Larsen I. Thelander M. Thelander L. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we have made changes in the region of residues 75–85. These amino acid residues are part of a loop region that forms the dimer interface of R2 (Arg-79 to Pro-85), and the improved orientation of this loop provides a better contact region between the two protomers. We now observe that Arg-80 in one protomer forms an interaction with Glu-144 in the other protomer and possibly also Arg-79 with Glu-192. Interestingly, we obtain a better fit to the electron density map for the amino acids Phe-84 and Pro-85 when Pro-85 is in the cis configuration. As mentioned above, the C-terminal end (residues 349–390) is poorly resolved or not visible at all in the electron density maps due to large flexibility. In the oxidized structure, we observe additional electron density within the previously proposed “open” channel reaching from the protein surface to the diiron site (34Kauppi B. Nielsen B.B. Ramaswamy S. Kjøller-Larsen I. Thelander M. Thelander L. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This density could not be fitted with water molecules and might originate from amino acids in the flexible C terminus of the enzyme. The C-terminal tail might fold back and into the channel as part of the mechanism that controls the access to the dinuclear cluster from the protein surface.

One such protein activated by cardiac remodeling is related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK, also known as pyk2). Adenoviral-mediated expression of RAFTK in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes involves concurrent increases in phosphorylation of Src, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 leading to characteristic apoptotic changes including cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, caspase-3 activation, and increased DNA laddering. DNA laddering was decreased by mutation of the Tyr402 Src-binding site in RAFTK, suggesting a central role for Src activity in apoptotic cell death that was confirmed by adenoviral-mediated Src expression. Multiple apoptotic signaling cascades are recruited by RAFTK as demonstrated by prevention of apoptosis using caspase-3 inhibitor IV (caspase-3 specific inhibitor), PP2 (Src-specific kinase inhibitor), or Csk (cellular negative regulator for Src), as well as dominant negative constructs for p38β or MKP-1. These RAFTK-mediated phenotypic characteristics are prevented by concurrent expression of wild-type or a phosphorylation-deficient paxillin mutated at Tyr31 and Tyr118. Wild-type or mutant paxillin protein accumulation in the cytoplasm has no overt effect upon cell structure, but paxillin accumulation prevents losses of myofibril organization as well as focal adhesion kinase, vinculin, and paxillin protein levels mediated by RAFTK. Apoptotic signaling cascade inhibition by paxillin indicates interruption of signaling proximal to but downstream of RAFTK activity. Chronic RAFTK activation in cardiac remodeling may represent a maladaptive reactive response that can be modulated by paxillin, opening up novel possibilities for inhibition of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and structural degeneration in heart failure.

Thus, paxillin was implicated in the RAFTK/pyk2 signaling cascade leading to heart failure as a target substrate of RAFTK/pyk2-mediated phosphorylation. RAFTK/pyk2 signaling has been extensively characterized in nonmuscle cells where postulated effects include coordinate regulation of cytoskeletal protein phosphorylation in combination with FAK 1The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; WT, wild-type; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; β-gal, β-galactosidase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.

Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Cumulative published studies suggest that the involvement of the RAFTK/pyk2-Src signaling axis in cell survival or death is context dependent. Apoptotic signaling has been linked to RAFTK/pyk2 wild-type (WT) expression in thymocytes, whereas kinase inactive RAFTK/pyk2 or treatment with the Src kinase inhibitor PP1 blocked apoptosis (16Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Pandey P. Treon S. Teoh G. Raje N. Rosen S. Krett N. Husson H. Avraham S. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6733-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).

RAFTK/pyk2 expression is developmentally regulated in the heart and abundant in vascular smooth muscle cells where activation of ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is influenced by RAFTK/pyk2. RAFTK/pyk2 concentration in cardiomyocytes is much greater in neonates than adults and is highly dependent on calcium transients and contractility (26Bayer A.L. Ferguson A.G. Lucchesi P. Samarel A.M.

Paxillin, a constituent member of focal adhesions, serves as an adaptor protein that associates with signaling and cytoskeletal molecules involved in the regulation of focal adhesion dynamics such as RAFTK/pyk2, FAK, c-Src, Csk, protein-tyrosine-phosphatase-PEST, talin, and vinculin (29Turner C.E.

Antibodies and Chemical Reagents—Phosphorylated sites on signaling proteins were detected using antibodies to RAFTK/pyk2 (Tyr(P)402 and Tyr(P)881), Src (Tyr(P)416), and paxillin (Tyr(P)31 and Tyr(P)118) from BIOSOURCE-QCB, (Camarillo CA), and phospho-c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and phospho-p38 (all from BIOSOURCE). Membranes were reprobed with anti-RAFTK/pyk2 and anti-paxillin monoclonal antibodies (both from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington KY), anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-JNK, anti-p38, and anti-Src antibodies (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly MA). Anti-vinculin antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-FAK polyclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Laboratories (Waltham, MA). For immunoblot studies, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies directed against goat, rabbit, and mouse IgG were used (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For confocal studies, primary antibodies were detected by fluorescently tagged (fluorescein isothiocyanate) secondary IgG antibodies directed against the appropriate primary host species as well as phalloidin labeled with Texas Red or Cy5 fluorophores (all from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Ribonuclease A (Sigma), cleaved caspase-3 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling), proteinase K (Invitrogen) and anti-cleaved-anti-PARP site (214/215) polyclonal antibody (BIOSOURCE-QCB) were used for experiments related to apoptotic signaling. Caspase-3 inhibitor IV Ac-Asp-Met-Gln-Asp-CHO (Ac-DMQD-CHO) and PP2 (both from Calbiochem) and Z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-chloromethylketone (Z-DEVD-cmk, Bachem, Torrance CA) were used to inhibit apoptotic signaling cascades. Neonatal Rat Ventricular Myocytes Isolation—Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were isolated from hearts of 2–3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats by multiple collagenase type I (Worthington) and pancreatine (Sigma) digestions as described previously (31Clerk A. Bogoyevitch M.A. Anderson M.B. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32848-32857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myocytes were preplated for 2 h in M-199 plus 15% fetal bovine serum to reduce nonmyocyte contamination and plated at various densities either on plastic chamber slides pretreated with laminin (Sigma) or 1% gelatin-coated dishes and left in a 5% CO2 incubator for 18 h. The next day, myocytes were washed and refed with serum-free M-199 culture medium. Adenoviruses Constructs and Infections—Rat RAFTK/pyk2, paxillin cDNA fragments encoding both WT and phosphorylation-deficient mutants (at Tyr402 for RAFTK/pyk2, Tyr31-Tyr118 for paxillin), and Src kinase cDNAs (Upstate Biotechnology) were used to create replication-defective recombinant adenoviruses with the Ad Easy system (Microbix Biosystem, Inc., Ontario, Canada) as directed by the manufacturer. Dominant negative adenoviruses for MKP-1 and P38β were kindly provided by Dr. J. Molkentin (Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Cincinnati, OH). Csk adenoviruses were graciously provided by Dr. S. Tanaka (Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Subconfluent cardiomyocyte cultures maintained in serum-free conditions for 24 h were infected with recombinant adenoviruses, including β-galactosidase (β-gal)-expressing adenovirus as a control for 2 h at a multiplicity of infection of 60:1, and then medium was aspirated and replaced with maintenance medium. Lysates for biochemical studies were prepared ∼24 h after infection. For co-infection experiments, initial infections were performed with one adenovirus and allowed to proceed for 24 h to allow for protein accumulation prior to secondary adenoviral infection. Inductors and Inhibitors of Apoptosis—Cardiomyocytes were treated with staurosporine (1 μm, for 12 h) to induce apoptosis, whereas inhibition of apoptosis was mediated by 2-h treatment with either 10–100 μm concentrations of PP2, caspase-3 inhibitor IV (Ac-DMQD-CHO), or Z-DEVD-cmk. All infections were all performed 24 h after respective treatments. Immunoblotting—Lysates from neonatal rat ventricular myocytes cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EGTA) containing a mixture of protease (100 μm sodium orthovanadate and NaF, 10 μm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol and 10 μg/ml each pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone) and phosphatase (10 nm each cypermethrin and okadaic acid and 100 μm phenylasine oxide) inhibitors. Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were probed with various primary antibodies as indicated and detected by enhanced chemifluorescence according to manufacturer protocols (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to phospho-Src-529, phospho-JNK, and/or phospho-p38-MAPK. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with either anti-pan-Src-, JNK-, or p38-MAPK antibodies. Blots were quantified by laser scanning densitometry. Results were expressed as the ratio phosphorylated protein kinase form to total protein kinase level. All blots were controlled for equal loading using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein level determination as a standard. For reprobing, membranes were stripped overnight in stripping solution (30% sulfosalicylic acid, 30% trichloroacetic acid, 0.5% Ponceau S), washed, blocked, and reprobed. Immunostaining—Cardiomyocytes cultured in plastic chamber slides pretreated with laminin were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and blocked with 10% horse serum (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were left overnight followed by secondary antibody incubation for 2 h. Slides were washed, mounted, and evaluated by confocal microscopy. Cardiomyocyes were readily identified by labeling with Texas Red-phalloidin to visualize myofibrils of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. DNA Fragmentation—Cardiomyocytes were treated with 1 ml of lysis buffer (0.8 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 8 mm Tris-HCl (TE, pH 8.0) and 4% SDS). DNA was extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Resulting DNA was incubated with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) for 2 h at 50 °C to facilitate protein disruption. After a second extraction with an equal volume of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), DNA was precipitated from the upper aqueous phase with 0.1 volumes of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ice-cold ethanol at -20 °C overnight. The next day, DNA was centrifuged, washed, dried, and resuspended in TE buffer followed by a 60-min incubation with ribonuclease A (2 mg/ml) at 37 °C. Samples were re-extracted, and DNA was precipitated as described above. Finally, pellets were resuspended in TE buffer, and DNA concentrations were quantified from the absorbance at 260 nm. 8–10 μg of DNA samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and visualized by staining with a solution containing 0.2 μg/ml of ethidium bromide. Expression of Results and Statistical Analysis—Data are represented as means ± S.E. of the number of independent experiments indicated (n) or as examples of representative experiments performed on at least three separate occasions. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance, and comparisons between groups were performed using a protected Tukey's t test. Values of p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 were set as the limit of statistical significance. Adenoviral-mediated Expression of RAFTK/pyk2 Enhances Kinase Activity and Induces Alteration of Cardiomyocyte Structure—Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were infected with recombinant adenoviral vectors expressing RAFTK/pyk2 (WT) or a mutated construct with impaired Src-binding activity (Tyr402). Infected cardiomyocytes showed accumulation of RAFTK/pyk2 (WT or Tyr402 mutant) in the cytoplasm and increases of 4.8- and 5.2-fold, respectively over β-gal expression. Overexpression of RAFTK/pyk2 (WT) increased the level of detectable phosphorylation at either residue Tyr402 or Tyr881 over 13-fold relative to control cultures infected with adenovirus expressing β-gal, consistent with activation (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the detectable phosphorylation level of the Tyr402 residue following expression of the mutant RAFTK/pyk2 (Tyr402) was reduced 0.5-fold relative to β-gal controls with a moderate rise in Tyr881 phosphorylation of 3.6-fold (Fig. 1A). RAFTK/pyk2 (WT) overexpression leads to marked cardiomyocyte remodeling and loss of myofibril organization mainly in peripheral regions whereas intact myofibrillar structures were maintained in the cell center (Fig. 1B, 2). In comparison, RAFTK/pyk2 (Tyr402) overexpression did not promote loss of myofibril organization, and peripheral attachments of myofibrils remained intact (Fig. 1B, 3). RAFTK/pyk2 Expression Induces Apoptotic Signaling in Cardiomyocytes—Cultures infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing RAFTK/pyk2 (WT), RAFTK/pyk2 (Tyr402), or β-gal as a control were evaluated for apoptotic signaling. DNA fragmentation assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis was clearly increased in cultures expressing RAFTK/pyk2 (WT) but not substantially enhanced by the Tyr402 mutant (Fig. 2A). RAFTK/pyk2 (WT) expression induces a 2-fold increase in cleaved PARP relative to β-gal, whereas total PARP was reduced by 43% (Fig. 2B). Content of cleaved caspase-3 was also increased by RAFTK/pyk2 adenovirus over 3.5-fold compared with control β-gal infection (Fig. 2C). Participation of caspase-3 in RAFTK/pyk2-induced apoptotic signaling was confirmed by preemptive pharmacologic inhibition with Z-DEVD-cmk or Z-DMQD-CHO (caspase-3 inhibitor IV), which prevented DNA cleavage (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these results support the conclusion that sustained increases in RAFTK/pyk2 activity are pro-apoptotic involving a caspase-3 dependent signaling pathway. RAFTK/pyk2 Activity Increases Phosphorylation of Src—Src kinase is activated by RAFTK/pyk2 via interaction with the Tyr402 residue and phosphorylation of Src at Tyr416 is indicative of activation. Immunoblots demonstrate marked increases in levels of RAFTK/pyk2 protein following infection with adenoviruses expressing RAFTK/pyk2 (WT) or the Tyr(P)402 mutant (Fig. 3upper panel). Immunoblotting for phosphotyrosine shows elevation of the phosphoprotein signal at 116 kDa in cultures expressing RAFTK/pyk2 consistent with the mobility of this kinase (Fig. 3, middle panel at arrow). It is tempting to speculate that the higher molecular weight phosphotyrosine immunoreactive band present in all samples is FAK based upon mobility at ∼125 kDa and the loss of signal in the presence of RAFTK/pyk2 overexpression consistent with results shown later (see Fig. 5). The expression of RAFTK/pyk2 but not the Tyr(P)402 mutant led to increased immunoreactivity for Tyr416 on Src consistent with activation of the kinase. Collectively these results indicate that RAFTK/pyk2 but not the Tyr(P)402 mutant is capable of enhancing Src phosphorylation following overexpression.Fig. 5RAFTK/pyk2-mediated loss of focal adhesion proteins is restored by paxillin overexpression. A, quantitation of immunoblot analysis for total protein content of culture lysates following infection with either RAFTK/pyk2 (WT) or the RAFTK/pyk2 (Tyr402) mutant construct. Both RAFTK/pyk2 constructs show comparable decreases in FAK and vinculin, whereas the decrease in paxillin is markedly enhanced by RAFTK/pyk2 (WT) relative to the Tyr402 mutant construct. Signal intensities were corrected for effects of adenoviral infection by standardization to β-gal controls followed by correction for minor loading variations by normalization to GAPDH signal. **, p < 0.01 and *, p < 0.05 versus β-gal infection. B, confocal micrographs of neonatal cardiomyocytes expressing β-gal, paxillin (WT), or paxillin (Tyr31-Tyr118). Immunoreactivity with antibody to paxillin (green) is low in cells expressing β-gal but is readily visible in cells expressing either paxillin (WT) or paxillin (Tyr31-Tyr118). Phalloidin labeling (red) reveals normal sarcomeric organization in all infected cells undisturbed by paxillin accumulation. C, quantitation of immunoblots for FAK or vinculin content in culture lysates following infection with paxillin constructs either alone on in combination with RAFTK/pyk2 constructs. Paxillin content is markedly increased in all cultures, and subsequent challenge with RAFTK constructs does not significantly decrease FAK or vinculin protein levels. Signal intensities were corrected for effects of adenoviral infection by standardization to β-gal controls followed by correction for minor loading variations by normalization to GAPDH signal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) pyk2/RAFTK-induced Apoptosis Involves Src-dependent Signaling Cascades—Activation of Src by RAFTK/pyk2 raises the possibility that Src kinase participates in RAFTK/pyk2-mediated apoptosis. The role of Src as a mediator of apoptotic signaling by RAFTK/pyk2 was confirmed by adenoviral-mediated expression of Src kinase (WT and constitutively activated, Fig. 4A), expression of C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), a negative regulatory kinase of Src family tyrosine kinases (Fig. 4B), and pharmacologic treatment with PP2, an Src-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Fig 4C). Overexpression of Src induced DNA fragmentation in cardiomyocyte cultures consistent with induction of apoptosis (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, DNA laddering was diminished by Csk (WT) accumulation in cultured cells prior to subsequent challenge infection with RAFTK/pyk2 (WT) adenovirus the following morning (Fig. 4B). In comparison, expression of a Csk dominant negative mutant failed to inhibit DNA laddering. Consistent with previous results (Fig. 2), infection with the RAFTK/pyk2 (Tyr402) mutant had negligible effects upon DNA laddering in all experiments (Fig. 4). Similar to findings for Src inhibition, DNA laddering was also diminished by inhibition of p38 signaling by dominant negative mutants of either p-38β isoform or MKP-1 prior to subsequent challenge infection with RAFTK/pyk2 (WT) adenovirus the following morning (Fig. 4D). Taken together, results shown in Fig. 4 delineate a cascade of apoptotic signaling triggered by RAFTK/pyk2 activity leading to cell death that is antagonized by inhibition of Src kinase. RAFTK/pyk2 Activity and Loss of Focal Adhesion-associated Proteins Is Restored by Paxillin Overexpression—RAFTK/pyk2-mediated induction of remodeling (Fig. 1B) suggests that focal adhesions may be affected, so immunoblotting was performed to determine expression levels of focal adhesion-associated proteins. Protein content of FAK, paxillin, and vinculin were all significantly reduced (29, 75, and 33%, respectively) following RAFTK/pyk2 (WT) expression relative to lysates from control cel"

Transgenic mice expressing elevated PKCβII in the colonic epithelium (transgenic PKCβII mice) exhibit hyperproliferation and enhanced colon carcinogenesis. Here we demonstrate that nullizygous PKCβ (PKCβKO) mice are highly resistant to azoxymethane (AOM)-induced preneoplastic lesions, aberrant crypt foci. However, reexpression of PKCβII in the colon of PKCβKO mice by transgenesis restores susceptibility to AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis. Expression of human PKCβII in rat intestinal epithelial (RIE) cells induces expression of endogenous rat PKCβII mRNA and protein. Induction of PKCβII is dependent upon catalytically active PKCβII and does not appear to involve changes in alternative splicing of the PKCβ gene. Two human PKCβ promoter constructs are activated by expression of PKCβII in RIE cells. Both PKCβ promoter activity and PKCβII mRNA levels are inhibited by the MEK1 and -2 inhibitor U0126, but not the Cox-2 inhibitor celecoxib in RIE/PKCβII cells. PKCβ promoter activity correlates directly with expression of endogenous PKCβII mRNA and protein in HT29 and HCT116 human colon cancer cell lines. PKCβ promoter activity and PKCβII mRNA expression in HCT116 cells are inhibited by the selective PKCβ inhibitor LY317615 and by U0126, demonstrating autoregulation of PKCβII expression. Transgenic PKCβII mice exhibit specific induction of endogenous PKCβII, but not its splice variant PKCβI, in the colonic epithelium in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate that 1) expression of PKCβII in the colonic epithelium is both necessary and sufficient to confer susceptibility to AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis in transgenic mice, 2) PKCβII regulates its own expression in RIE and human colon cancer cells in vitro and in the colonic epithelium in vivo, and 3) PKCβII autoregulation is mediated through a MEK-dependent signaling pathway in RIE/PKCβII and HCT116 colon cancer cells.

PKCβII also induces an invasive phenotype in RIE cells through activation of a novel proinvasive PKCβII → Ras → PKCι/Rac1 → MEK signaling pathway that is distinct from that responsible for TGFβ resistance (12Zhang J.

Thus, PKCβII promotes AOM-induced colon cancer through activation of at least two distinct signaling pathways, one that confers TGFβ resistance and a second that induces invasion in intestinal epithelial cells. Here we resolve two critical questions regarding PKCβII and colon carcinogenesis. First, we provide direct evidence that PKCβII expression is both necessary and sufficient for AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis. Second, we identify a major mechanism by which PKCβII expression is regulated in the colonic epithelium. Our results demonstrate that PKCβII induces its own expression in RIE and human colon cancer cells in vitro and in the colonic epithelium in vivo. PKCβII autoregulation is dependent upon PKCβII activity and is mediated predominantly through transcriptional activation of the PKCβ promoter through a PKCβII-, MEK-dependent signaling pathway. Our results suggest that PKCβII autoregulation plays a key promotive role in carcinogen-induced colon cancer.

Gustafson W.C. Schattenberg D.G. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Colons were everted and washed with Hepes-buffered saline (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. Colonic crypts enriched in epithelial cells were released by incubation in Hepes-buffered saline containing 10 mm EDTA, and isolated crypts were collected by centrifugation. Mesenchymal cells were isolated by gentle scraping from the remaining colon tissue using a plastic slide coverslip. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueous reagent (Ambion), treated with DNase for 15–30 min, and subjected to RT-PCR analysis as described previously (8Murray N.R. Jamieson L. Yu W. Zhang J.

QRT-PCR was carried out using target-specific probes and primers to detect PKCβIIa (probe spanning exons 16 and 17 of the human PKCβ gene), PKCβI (probe spanning exons 16 and 18), and PKCβI and PKCβIIb (probes internal exon 18) mRNA species. PKCβ reagents were generated using the Assay by Design program from Applied Biosystems, Inc., and were validated by demonstrating a linear relationship between ΔCt and cDNA concentration over a wide range of sample concentrations. Commercially available, validated primer and probe sets for mouse E-cadherin and vimentin were from Applied Biosystems (Assays on Demand). Data were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA abundance to control for RNA concentration. Standard curves were established using serial dilution of a reference sample. TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and RNase inhibitor were used (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Amplification data were collected using an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900 sequence detector and analyzed using the Sequence Detection System software from Perkin Elmer Life Sciences. Kinase-deficient Mutant of Human PKCβII Mutation and Retrovirus Transfection—A kinase-deficient mutant of human PKCβII (kdPKCβII) was generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis to mutate lysine 372 of PKCβII, a residue essential for ATP binding and kinase activity, to tryptophan using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) as described previously (12Zhang J.

The kdPKCβII mutant was inserted into the pBabe/Flag/puro retroviral expression vector, and virus stocks were produced using Phoenix-E cells. Puromycin-resistant, stable transfectants were generated as described previously (12Zhang J. Anastasiadis P.Z. Liu Y. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol.

Expression of PKCβII or kdPKCβII was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using anti-FLAG and anti-PKCβII antibodies as described previously (12Zhang J. Anastasiadis P.Z. Liu Y. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P.

Cloning and Characterization of the Human PKCβ Promoter—Two PKCβ promoter constructs consisting of 2.3 kb (pkcβ-2.3) and 500 bp (pkcβ-0.5) of 5′-flanking sequence were cloned by PCR from a human genomic DNA library using the Genome Walker Kit (BD Biosciences, Clontech). The resultant PCR products were confirmed by sequencing and found to correspond to the sequence reported in the public human genome sequence data base. Promoter constructs were cloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3 (Promega) to yield pPKCβ/luc reporters. Promoter activity was assayed by co-transfection of 1 μg of pGL3-pkcβ-0.5 or pGL3-pkcβ-2.3 plus 50 ng of phRL-SV40 into RIE, HCT116, and HT-29 cells using the FuGene6 lipofection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described by the manufacturer. 24 h after transfection, cells were assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega) as described previously (11Yu W. Murray N.R. Weems C. Chen L. Guo H. Ethridge R. Ceci J.D. Evers B.M. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol.

Results are expressed as firefly luciferase activity normalized to Renilla luciferase, which served as a control for transfection efficiency. Expression of PKCβII in the Colonic Epithelium Is Necessary and Sufficient to Confer Susceptibility to Colon Carcinogenesis—The impetus for studying the regulation of PKCβII expression in the colonic epithelium comes from our observation that PKCβII expression is elevated in colonic preneoplastic lesions, ACF, and colon tumors of mouse exposed to the chemical carcinogen azoxymethane (7Gokmen-Polar Y. Murray N.R. Velasco M.A. Gatalica Z. Fields A.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1375-1381PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic PKCβII mice expressing elevated PKCβII in the colonic epithelium to levels consistent with those observed in AOM-induced colon tumors exhibit hyperproliferation of the colonic epithelium and increased sensitivity to AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis (9Murray N.R. Davidson L.A. Chapkin R.S. Gustafson W.C. Schattenberg D.G. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, PKCβII levels correlate with colon carcinogenesis, and elevation of PKCβII levels by transgenesis leads to a cancer-prone phenotype. However, a remaining question was whether PKCβII expression was necessary for AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis. To address this question, we determined the susceptibility of PKCβKO mice (13Leitges M. Schmedt C. Guinamard R. Davoust J. Schaal S. Stabel S. Tarakhovsky A. Science. 1996; 273: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) to AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis (Fig. 1). Wild-type and PKCβKO mice were treated with AOM to induce colon carcinogenesis and assessed for development of ACF as described previously (9Murray N.R. Davidson L.A. Chapkin R.S. Gustafson W.C. Schattenberg D.G. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). ACF are considered preneo-plastic lesions, and their number is highly predictive of subsequent colon tumor formation (16Magnuson B.A. Carr I. Bird R.P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4499-4504PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bird R.P. Cancer Lett. 1995; 93: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). PKCβKO mice exhibit a statistically significant, 3-fold decrease in ACF formation when compared with wild-type mice. These results demonstrate that expression of PKCβII is an important determinant of susceptibility to AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis. We next assessed the role of PKCβII expression in the colonic epithelium in susceptibility to colon carcinogenesis. For this purpose, PKCβKO mice were crossed to transgenic PKCβII mice to generate PKCβKO/PKCβII mice. PKCβKO/PKCβII mice are nullizygous for the PKCβ gene by virtue of the germ line disruption of the endogenous PKCβ gene (13Leitges M. Schmedt C. Guinamard R. Davoust J. Schaal S. Stabel S. Tarakhovsky A. Science. 1996; 273: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, these mice are capable of expressing PKCβII only in the colonic epithelium due to the presence of transgenic human PKCβII, whose expression is restricted to the colonic epithelium (9Murray N.R. Davidson L.A. Chapkin R.S. Gustafson W.C. Schattenberg D.G. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). When PKCβKO/PKCβII mice are treated with AOM, ACF formation is restored to levels indistinguishable from wild-type mice. These data demonstrate that expression of PKCβII within the colonic epithelium is both necessary and sufficient to confer susceptibility to AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis. Expression of Human PKCβII in RIE Cells Induces Expression of Endogenous PKCβII—Since PKCβII expression in the colonic epithelium is an important determinant of colon cancer susceptibility, we next assessed the mechanism by which PKCβII expression is regulated. An important clue came from a genomic analysis of RIE and RIE/PKCβII cells for potential PKCβII gene targets. This analysis revealed that the endogenous rat PKCβ gene is induced by the presence of human PKCβII (data not shown). To confirm these results, we generated real time PCR reagents that detect rat PKCβ mRNA species but not the human PKCβII transgene. Alternative splicing of PKCβ mRNAs is complicated, with evidence of tissue-specific differences in splice patterns (18Blobe G.C. Khan W.A. Halpern A.E. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10627-10635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chalfant C.E. Mischak H. Watson J.E. Winkler B.C. Goodnight J. Farese R.V. Cooper D.R. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 910-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The PKCβ gene can be alternatively spliced to produce at least three mRNA splice variants termed PKCβI, PKCβIIa, and PKCβIIb (20Chalfant C.E. Watson J.E. Bisnauth L.D. Kang J.B. Patel N. Obeid L.M. Eichler D.C. Cooper D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 910-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). To determine whether PKCβII induces expression of a specific splice variant of the endogenous PKCβ gene, we developed PCR reagents to detect each of these splice variants and determined the level of each variant by quantitative real time PCR in RIE and RIE/PKCβII cells (Fig. 2B). Whereas RIE cells contain no detectable PKCβ mRNA species, RIE/PKCβII cells express abundant endogenous PKCβIIa and PKCβIIb mRNA but no detectable PKCβI mRNA. The pattern of expression of the three splice variants of PKCβ is very similar to the pattern of expression of these variants in rat brain, a very abundant source of PKCβI and PKCβII mRNA. In contrast to RIE/PKCβII cells, RIE cells transfected with a kinase-deficient mutant of PKCβII (RIE/kdPKCβII cells) express no detectable rat PKCβ mRNAs. Taken together, these data demonstrate that PKCβII induces expression of PKCβII. The PKCβIIa mRNA species is the major form produced, with lower but detectable amounts of the PKCβIIb mRNA. PKCβII autoinduction requires the kinase activity of PKCβII, since kdPKCβII does not induce endogenous PKCβ expression. Immunoblot analysis of total cell extracts from RIE and RIE/PKCβII cells with a specific antibody to PKCβII revealed, as expected (12Zhang J. Anastasiadis P.Z. Liu Y. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22118-22123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), that RIE cells express no detectable PKCβII protein (Fig. 2C). In contrast, two immunoreactive bands corresponding to PKCβII are detected in RIE/PKCβII cells. Immunoblot analysis with an anti-FLAG antibody confirmed the identity of the slower migrating band as transgenic FLAG-tagged human PKCβII. The faster migrating band is not recognized by the anti-FLAG antibody and co-migrates with rat brain PKCβII, indicating that it corresponds to endogenous rat PKCβII. Immunoblot analysis using a PKCβI-specific antibody revealed no detec"

Here we show that activation of STAT1 is an early response to DNA damage and that STAT1 activation requires PKCδ. Treatment of HeLa cells with etoposide results in phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser727 and the association of STAT1 with PKCδ. Etoposide increases transcription from STAT1-dependent reporter constructs. Increased transcription, as well as STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation, can be blocked by inhibition or depletion of PKCδ. To ask if STAT1 is required for PKCδ-mediated apoptosis, we utilized U3A STAT1-deficient cells. Induction of apoptosis by PKCδ is suppressed in U3A cells but can be rescued by co-transfection with STAT1α but not STAT1 mutated at Ser727. Nuclear accumulation of STAT1, phospho-Ser727 STAT1, and PKCδ are detectable 30–60 min after treatment with etoposide. Nuclear localization is necessary for apoptosis, since a nuclear localization mutant of PKCδ does not induce apoptosis in U3A cells reconstituted with STAT1α, and a nuclear localization mutant of STAT1 does not support PKCδ-induced apoptosis in U3A cells.

Phosphorylation at Tyr701 by the Janus family of tyrosine kinases (JAK) leads to STAT1 dimerization via its Src homology 2 domains, exposure of a dimer-specific nuclear localization signal, and subsequent nuclear translocation (21Aaronson D.S.

Activated STATs, together with co-factors such as c-Jun, BRCA1, MCM5, IRF-1, IRF-9, and cAMP-response element-binding protein, regulate transcription by binding to GAS or ISRE elements in the promoters of specific target genes (21Aaronson D.S.

The identification of STAT1 Ser727 as a potential regulatory site for STAT1 proapoptotic functions, and the observation that PKCδ can phosphorylate STAT1 at Ser727 in response to some stimuli, suggests a link between these two proapoptotic signaling pathways. Here we show that activation of STAT1 is an early response to DNA-damaging agents and that activation of STAT1 in apoptotic cells requires PKCδ. Our studies indicate that induction of apoptosis requires nuclear translocation of PKCδ and STAT1 as well as STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation. These studies demonstrate a novel and functional interaction between PKCδ and STAT1 during DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Cells and Cell Culture—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.

Immunoblot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were harvested for immunoblot analysis using MSLB buffer (15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). Nuclear fractions were isolated using a nuclear/cytosol fractionation kit (Biovision) according to the manufacturer's instructions except that 1 mm NaVO3 was included in all buffers, and Triton X-100 was added to the nuclear extraction buffer at a final concentration of 1%. Protein concentrations were determined using the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). The following antibodies were used: anti-GFP, Zymed Laboratories Inc. (catalog no. C163); antihuman PKCδ, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA (catalog no. C-20, sc-937); anti-STAT1 p84/p91, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (E23); anti-phospho-Tyr701 STAT1, Cell Signaling Technology (catalog no. 9171S) or Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog no. sc-7988); anti-phospho-Ser727 STAT1, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY (catalog no. 06-802); anti-tubulin, BD Pharmingen (catalog no. 556321); anti-lamin B, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog no. sc-6217). Immunoblot analysis was done as previously described using 50 or 100 μg of protein (5Reyland M. Anderson S. Matassa A. Barzen K. Quissell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11915-11923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (232) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 0.5 or 1 mg of protein was mixed with the appropriate antibody overnight, and the antigen-antibody complexes were recovered by incubation with Sepharose-protein A (Sigma) for 1–4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in MSLB buffer, and the precipitated proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Plasmid Constructs—Generation of mouse pGFPPKCδ and pGFPN-LMFL8δ has been previously described (12DeVries T.A. Neville M.C. Reyland M.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6050-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The plasmids pSTAT1α (ST1α) and pSTAT1α S727A (ST1α S727A) were obtained from Dr. James Darnell (Rockefeller University) (23Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). The plasmids pGFPST-AT1α (ST1α) and pGFPST1α L407A (L407A) were obtained from Dr. Nancy Reich (SUNY Stony Brook) (22McBride K.M. Banninger G. McDonald C. Reich N.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The interferon stimulatory response element (ISRE) and GAS cis-reporting systems and the pCIS-CK negative control plasmid were purchased from Stratagene. To generate the PKCδ-specific siRNA, pRETRO-SUPER (37Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar) was digested with BglII/HindIII and ligated to the double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-GATCCCCGAACGCTTCAACATCGACATTCAAGAGATGTCGATG-TTGAAGCGTTCTTTTTTGGAAA-3′. Transient Transfection—For terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis, subconfluent 2fTGH and U3A cells were transiently transfected using a 6:1 lipid/DNA ratio of FuGene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Etoposide (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO and used at a final concentration of 50 or 100 μm as indicated in the figures. Human recombinant interferon-γ (IFNγ) was purchased from Sigma and added at a final concentration of 5 ng/ml 30 min prior to harvesting. HeLa cells were transfected with the pISRE and pGAS cis-reporter plasmids or the pCIS-CK control plasmid using the calcium phosphate method. Cells were co-transfected with pCMV β-galactosidase as a control for transfection efficiency. Luciferase and β-galactosidase were assayed as previously described (38Reyland M.E. Williams D.L. White E.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C780-C789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The siRNA vector, pRETRO-SUPER, was introduced into HeLa cells by square wave electroporation. TUNEL Analysis and Cell Counts—TUNEL analysis was performed using the in situ cell death detection kit TMR Red (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. GFP-positive cells were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy, and TUNEL-positive cells containing GFP were quantified as the percentage of the total GFP-positive cells per field. Greater than 250 cells were counted for each variable per experiment. Etoposide Regulates STAT1-dependent Transcription—STAT1 is required for apoptosis induced by doxorubicin and cisplatin and for the induction of apoptotic genes such as Bax, Fas, and Noxa, suggesting that induction of STAT1-dependent gene transcription is an important component of apoptosis induced by DNA damage (20Townsend P.A. Scarabelli T.M. Davidson S.M. Knight R.A. Latchman D.S. Stephanou A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5811-5820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). STAT1 drives transcription through binding to GAS or ISRE elements in STAT1-responsive genes (21Aaronson D.S. Horvath C.M. Science. 2002; 296: 1653-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). To determine whether the DNA-damaging agent, etoposide, can regulate STAT1-dependent transcription, HeLa cells were transfected with promoter-reporter plasmids containing either a GAS or ISRE element, and transfected cells were treated with etoposide for 6 h. As shown in Fig. 1A, both promoters are expressed basally, and the addition of etoposide increases transcription from each promoter >2-fold. We have previously shown that PKCδ is required for etoposide induced apoptosis (12DeVries T.A. Neville M.C. Reyland M.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6050-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of PKCδ to the induction of STAT1-dependent transcription by etoposide, we have used the PKCδ-specific inhibitor, rottlerin, as well as depletion of PKCδ by expression of a PKCδ-specific siRNA. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1B, HeLa cells were transfected with the pGAS or pISRE reporter plasmids and then pretreated with the PKCδ inhibitor, rottlerin, prior to the addition of etoposide. Rottlerin has previously been shown to block etoposide-induced apoptosis (5Reyland M. Anderson S. Matassa A. Barzen K. Quissell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11915-11923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (232) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, rottlerin completely suppresses etoposide induction of the pGAS reporter and suppresses induction of the pISRE reporter by about 80%, indicating that PKCδ activity is required for the induction of STAT1-dependent transcription. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1C, HeLa cells were transfected by electroporation with a plasmid that expresses an siRNA directed against PKCδ or the vector control. After 48 h, PKCδ protein is depleted >90% using this strategy (see Fig. 5C). Cells were then transfected a second time with pGAS luc or pISRE luc using the calcium phosphate method, followed by treatment with etoposide. As shown in Fig. 1C, inhibition of PKCδ expression suppressed the etoposide-mediated induction of both promoters while only slightly suppressing basal expression of these promoters. The etoposide induction of pGAS luc was suppressed by 50%, whereas the induction of pISREluc was reduced by 30%. Taken together, these data suggest that etoposide induces transcriptional activation of STAT1-responsive genes in apoptotic cells and that this activation requires PKCδ activity. In the case of both rottlerin and the siRNA to PKCδ, etoposide induction of the GAS promoter was suppressed to a greater extent than induction of the ISRE promoter. This differential sensitivity may reflect the fact that the GAS element preferentially binds STAT1 homodimers, whereas ISRE element preferentially binds STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers (21Aaronson D.S. Horvath C.M. Science. 2002; 296: 1653-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar).Fig. 5Inhibition of PKCδ diminishes Ser727 (P-S727) phosphorylation of STAT1.A, HeLa cells were incubated with Me2SO alone, 100 nm Go6976, 160 nm Go6983, or 1 μm rottlerin for 1 h and then treated for the indicated times with 100 μm etoposide. Lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitated with an antibody to STAT1, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for phospho-Ser727 STAT1 (P-S727; top) or total STAT1 protein (bottom). B, HeLa cells were transfected with pRETROSUPER alone (siRNA control), or pRETROSUPER with siRNA to PKCδ (siRNAδ) for 48 h and then treated for the indicated times with 50 μm etoposide (Etop). Whole cell lysates were immunoblotted for phospho-Ser727 STAT1 (top) or total STAT1 (bottom). Duplicate samples are shown for each time point. C, lysates from the experiment in A were immunoblotted with an antibody directed to the C terminus of human PKCδ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) STAT1 Is Phosphorylated at Ser727 in Response to Etoposide—Activation of STAT1, leading to the transcription of STAT1-regulated genes, is regulated by phosphorylation of STAT1 at Tyr701 and Ser727. Phosphorylation at Tyr701 is important for nuclear translocation and retention (22McBride K.M. Banninger G. McDonald C. Reich N.C.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation at Ser727 is required for maximal transcriptional activation of STAT1-dependent genes, including genes required for the apoptotic response (23Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell J. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 28Ramana C. Chatterjee-Kishore M. HNguyen H. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2619-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To ask whether changes in phosphorylation of STAT1 occur in response to etoposide, we utilized antibodies that specifically recognize STAT1 phosphorylated at Tyr701 or Ser727. As demonstrated in Fig. 2A (top), STAT1 is phosphorylated at Ser727 in untreated HeLa cells, and treatment with etoposide results in an increase in phosphorylation at this site within 60 min, which is sustained for at least 4 h. In contrast, no basal phosphorylation at STAT1 Tyr701 is detectable in HeLa cells (Fig. 2A, middle). Likewise, phospho-STAT1 Tyr701 was not detectable in cells treated with etoposide; however, Tyr701 phosphorylation was observed in response to IFNγ treatment as has been previously reported. Previous studies from other laboratories suggest that STAT1 phosphorylated at Tyr701 is dephosphorylated in the nucleus and subsequently exported into the cytoplasm (39Meyer T. Hendry L. Begitt A. John S. Vinkemeier U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18998-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 40Meyer T. Marg A. Lemke P. Wiesner B. Vinkemeier U.

Science's STKE. 2003; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2003/195/re13)PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether the lack of detectable STAT1 phospho-Tyr701 is due to its rapid dephosphorylation, HeLa cells were pretreated with pervanadate prior to the addition of etoposide. Whereas some accumulation of phospho-Tyr701 STAT1 was observed in pervanadate pretreated cells, etoposide did not further increase the amount of phospho-Tyr701 STAT1 (data not shown). Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 is mediated by the JAK tyrosine kinases, JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2. To further address the contribution of Tyr701 phosphorylation to etoposide-induced STAT1 activation, we have utilized three human fibroblast cells lines, each deficient in one of these tyrosine kinases. As shown in Fig. 2B, treatment of the control cell lines, 2fTGH and 2C4, with etoposide results in the rapid phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser727. A similar time course of STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation was observed in U1A (TYK2-deficient) and U4A (JAK1-deficient) cells. Etoposide-induced STAT1 S727 phosphorylation was also observed in the γ2A (JAK2-deficient) cells; however, in this cell line, the time course was slightly delayed, and phosphorylation appeared to be more robust, suggesting that a JAK2-regulated pathway may suppress the etoposide-induced phosphorylation of STAT1. Taken together, these data indicate that etoposide-induced activation of STAT1 does not require the JAK family of tyrosine kinases and suggests that Ser727 phosphorylation of STAT1 is sufficient for activation of STAT1 in apoptotic cells. Association of STAT1 and PKCδ in Etoposide-treated Cells— Recent studies suggest that PKCδ is required for phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser727 in response to IFNα, IFNγ, and interleukin-6 (31Uddin S. Sassano A. Deb D.K. Verma A. Majchrzak B. Rahman A. Malik A.B. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24392-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of PKCδ to etoposide-induced phosphorylation of STAT1, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to STAT1 and immunoblotted for PKCδ or phospho-Ser727 STAT1 (Fig. 3A). An association of STAT1 with full-length PKCδ was observed as early as 30 min after etoposide treatment and was concomitant with phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser727 (Fig. 3A, top and bottom). In the experiment shown in Fig. 3B, lysates from etoposide-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKCδ and immunoblotted for STAT1. Immunoprecipitation of PKCδ likewise demonstrated an etoposide-dependent association with STAT1, which was detectable within 30 min of etoposide stimulation. Since in HeLa cells the cleavage product of PKCδ does not accumulate until 12–24 h after etoposide treatment (data not shown), whereas PKCδ and STAT1 associate within 30 min, our data suggest that STAT1 interacts with PKCδ prior to its caspase cleavage. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3C, pretreatment of HeLa cells with the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone does not inhibit the association of PKCδ and STAT1 or the phosphorylation of STAT1 Ser727 in etoposide-treated cells. Thus, caspase activation is not required for interaction of PKCδ with STAT1 or for phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser727. Our studies indicate that in HeLa cells the full-length PKCδ protein associates with STAT1 prior to caspase cleavage of PKCδ. To address this further, we have utilized parotid C5 cells, which undergo early and robust cleavage of PKCδ in response to etoposide (5Reyland M. Anderson S. Matassa A. Barzen K. Quissell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11915-11923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Fig. 3D shows that in parotid C5 cells, etoposide induces the association of PKCδ and STAT1 by 2 h, and this association is greatly diminished by 4 h. Loss of the association of PKCδ and STAT1 parallels the initiation of cleavage of PKCδ at 4 h as shown in Fig. 3E. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the etoposide-induced association of PKCδ and STAT1 is an early event in the apoptotic pathway and that loss of this association is co-incident with caspase cleavage of PKCδ. Additionally, the observed co-association between PKCδ and ST"

These mutations resulted in the loss of AhR binding to endogenous XAP2 in COS-1 cells and reduced binding of exogenously expressed XAP2. Cellular localization of the mutant AhR-yellow fluorescent protein fusion proteins remained nuclear when XAP2 was co-expressed, while the non-mutant receptor was redistributed to the cytoplasm. XAP2 expression caused an overall repression of constitutive and ligand-induced AhR transcriptional activity. However, increased expression of XAP2 had no effect on the AhRY408A mutant transcriptional activity. Additionally the XAP2 binding-deficient AhR mutants showed overall higher transcriptional activity when compared with the non-mutant receptor. Interestingly reduced incorporation of the Hsp90 associated co-chaperone p23 in the unliganded AhR complex was observed with increasing XAP2 expression. The displacement of p23 from Hsp90 did not occur when increasing levels of XAP2 were introduced in COS-1 cells in the absence of the AhR; thus this displacement event occurs specifically within an AhR complex. Finally XAP2 itself was capable of existing in multimeric complexes, and these complexes did not require Hsp90 or AhR to form. However, it is not yet clear whether XAP2 can exist within the AhR complex in more than one copy.

The activity of many basic helix-loop-helix Per/ARNT/Sim proteins is regulated by an external stimulus such as light/dark cycle or oxygen stress (for reviews, see Refs. 1Panda S. Hogenesch J.B.

Analogously the AhR can be activated by a wide variety of structurally diverse exogenous ligands as well as some endogenous compounds (for a review, see Ref. 3Denison M.S. Nagy S.R. Annu. Rev.

Ligand binding to the AhR initiates the formation of the nuclear transcriptionally active AhR/ARNT heterodimer through an ill defined mechanism referred to as transformation. The binding of the AhR/ARNT heterodimer to its specific DNA enhancer element results in the increased transcription of a battery of metabolically important enzymes (13Nebert D.W. Roe A.L. Dieter M.Z. Solis W.A. Yang Y. Dalton T.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 65-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). XAP2, also known as AhR-associated protein 9 (8Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11452-11456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) or AhR interacting protein (9Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8878-8884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), was initially discovered by its ability to interact with and repress transactivation by the hepatitis B virus X protein (14Kuzhandaivelu N. Cong Y.S. Inouye C. Yang W.M. Seto E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It was subsequently identified as an AhR-interacting protein by a yeast two-hybrid screen and was also found as part of the AhR complex within mammalian cells (10Meyer B.K. Pray-Grant M.G. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Perdew G.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). It displays primary sequence homology with the FKBP family of immunophilins (8Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11452-11456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) but is not characterized as an immunophilin because it does not appear to possess the ability to bind immunosuppressant drugs such as FK506 (15Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S. Dunham E.E. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33580-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Like some immunophilins, XAP2 can interact with the carboxyl-terminal half of Hsp90 through its TPR domain. In addition to interacting with Hsp90, XAP2 can interact directly with the AhR in the absence of Hsp90 (16Meyer B.K. Perdew G.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8907-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Expression of XAP2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using ectopically introduced AhR results in increased receptor activity compared with when the AhR is expressed alone (15Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6153-6159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover expression of XAP2 in mammalian cells can result in increased AhR activity (9Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8878-8884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). This elevated AhR activity observed with high XAP2 expression is likely due to increased AhR stability caused by XAP2 (17LaPres J.J. Glover E. Dunham E.E. Bunger M.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6153-6159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Stabilization of the AhR by XAP2 in mammalian cells has been attributed to reduced levels of AhR ubiquitination when XAP2 is co-expressed (18Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Along those lines, XAP2 reduces the ability of the E3 ligase carboxyl-terminal Hsc70-interacting protein to initiate proteasome-mediated degradation of AhR (19Lees M.J. Peet D.J. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35878-35888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Conversely XAP2 has been shown to repress constitutive and ligand-induced mouse AhR activity in the presence of low ligand concentrations (20Petrulis J.R. Kusnadi A. Ramadoss P. Hollingshead B. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2677-2685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Additionally repression of human AhR activity by XAP2 in cell culture has been reported (21Ramadoss P. Petrulis J.R. Hollingshead B.D. Kusnadi A. Perdew G.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The discrepancies observed in the modulation of AhR activity by XAP2 may be related to the interplay between AhR stabilization caused by overexpression of XAP2 and other potential repressive properties such as cytoplasmic retention of the AhR. The Hsp90-associated co-chaperone p23 has been shown to modulate the function of a number of steroid hormone receptors (22Freeman B.C. Felts S.J. Toft D.O. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 422-434PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the glucocorticoid receptor shows increased stability and higher capacity to bind hormone when complexes are associated with p23 (23Dittmar K.D. Demady D.R. Stancato L.F. Krishna P. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Like many members of the steroid hormone receptors that bind Hsp90, p23 has been observed in a complex with the AhR. The ablation of the yeast p23 homolog sbaI causes reduced activity of ectopically expressed AhR that can be rescued by the exogenous introduction of SBAI or human p23 (24Cox M.B. Miller III, C.A. Toxicol. Lett. 2002; 129: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In vitro association of p23 with receptor may enhance the ability of the AhR to bind the nuclear import protein pendulin (25Kazlauskas A. Sundstrom S. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), mediating efficient import of the receptor to the nucleus. The absence of p23 in the AhR complex allows AhR/ARNT heterodimerization in the absence of ligand (12Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13519-13524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Additionally ligand-induced formation of the DNA-bound AhR/ARNT heterodimer is enhanced by p23 in vitro (26Shetty P.V. Bhagwat B.Y. Chan W.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This report examines the properties of AhR complexes that fail to bind XAP2. By introducing a single point mutation in the XAP2 binding region of the AhR we determined how the loss of functional XAP2 association with the AhR affects its transcriptional activity, its cellular localization, and the ability of p23 to exist in the unliganded AhR complex. These results suggest that XAP2 incorporation in the AhR complex is not required for the formation of a functional AhR but that it acts as a modulator to differentially regulate AhR activity possibly by regulating the levels of p23 incorporation in the AhR complex. Cell Culture and Expression Constructs—COS-1 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in α modified minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 1000 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma).

AhR point mutation constructs were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) creating pcDNA3/mAhRY408A-FLAG, pcDNA3/mAhRY408K-FLAG, pcDNA3/mAhRY408A, pEYFP/mAhRY408A, and pEYFP/mAhRY408K. To create pCI/XAP2-HA, pCI/XAP2 was used as a template to PCR amplify the XAP2 cDNA modifying the stop codon to add a carboxyl-terminal HA tag. The PCR cDNA product was flanked with XhoI and XbaI sites, and the XAP2-HA cDNA was ligated into pCI empty vector via XhoI and XbaI sites. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—All transfections in COS-1 cells were performed using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) as specified by the manufacturer. Reporter assays were carried out in 6-well dishes using 70–90% confluent cells at the time of transfection. DNA amounts in each well were as follows: 0–100 ng of AhR, 0 or 200 ng of XAP2, 30 or 100 ng of the AhR-driven luciferase reporter plasmid pGUDLUC 6.1, and empty expression vector to total 1.5 μg of DNA/well. Cells were dosed for 8 h with Me2SO carrier solvent (Sigma), 1 nm TCDD (a gift from Dr. Steven Safe), or 10 μm benzo[a]pyrene (Aldrich) 18 h after starting the transfection. Cells were lysed with 1× Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase assays were carried out using a Turner TD-20e luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA), and values were normalized to protein content (Pierce) determined using a Spectracount™ spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Fluorescent Microscopy—COS-1 cells were transfected in 30-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) with 0.75 μg of pEYFP/AhR, pEYFP/AhRY408A, or pEYFP/AhRY408K plus 0.75 μg of pCI/XAP2 or pcDNA3 empty vector to a total of 1.5 μg of total DNA/dish. Approximately 12 h after transfection cells were visualized using a Nikon 60×A/1.40 oil objective with a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope (Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and photographed using a SPOT™ RT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). In Vitro Interaction of XAP2 with AhR Mutants—pcDNA3/mAhR-FLAG, pcDNA3/mAhRY408A-FLAG, pcDNA3/mAhRY408K-FLAG, and pCI/XAP2 were separately in vitro translated using a TnT® T7 coupled reticulocyte transcription/translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. AhR and XAP2 were translated in 50- and 100-μl reactions, respectively. 10-μl aliquots of each translation were mixed and incubated on ice for 1 h. The incubated mixture was then diluted with 700 μl of binding buffer (MENG (25 mm MOPS, 2 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, and 10% glycerol (pH = 7.5)), 20 mm Na2MoO4, and 2 mg/ml BSA), applied to 40 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma), and mixed on a platform rocker for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were washed four times with binding buffer minus BSA plus 50 mm NaCl, and samples were resolved by TSDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and visualized by autoradiography using Biomax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.). FLAG Immunoprecipitations—COS-1 cells were transfected in 10-cm2 dishes with pcDNA3/mAhR-FLAG, pcDNA3/mAhRY408A-FLAG, or pcDNA3/mAhRY408K-FLAG plus pCI/XAP2 or empty vector to equal 8–10 μg of total DNA/transfection. After 18 h transfected cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 500 μl of MENG, 20 mm Na2MoO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mg/ml BSA, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 20 min at 4 °C. The lysate was then diluted to 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with MENG, 20 mm Na2MoO4, and 1× protease inhibitors. Cytosol was obtained by centrifugation of lysates for 30 min at 21,000 × g. Cytosol was applied to 40 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel. Samples were mixed on a platform rocker for 1.5 h at 4 °C and then washed three times with MENG, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Na2MoO4, 100 mm NaCl. Samples were resolved using TSDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. XAP2 Immunoprecipitations—COS-1 cells were transfected in 10-cm2 dishes with pcDNA3 empty vector, pcDNA3/mAhR, or pcDNA3/mAhRY408A plasmids and brought up to 8 μg of total DNA/transfection with additional pcDNA3. After 18 h transfected cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1 ml of MENG, 20 mm Na2MoO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture for 20 min at 4 °C. Cytosol was isolated by centrifugation of samples at 21,000 × g for 30 min. 400 μl of lysate plus 400 μl of binding buffer (MENG, 20 mm Na2MoO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mg/ml BSA) was applied to 50 μl of Protein A-agarose (Pierce) prebound to either control rabbit IgG or polyclonal XAP2 antibody (31Bolger G.B. Peden A.H. Steele M.R. MacKenzie C. McEwan D.G. Wallace D.A. Huston E. Baillie G.S. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33351-33363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Samples were mixed at 4 °C for 2 h and washed three times with MENG, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Na2MoO4, and 50 mm NaCl. Samples were resolved by TSDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. p23 Immunoprecipitations—Transfections and cytosol preparations for p23 immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described above. Cytosol was prepared in the same manner as for FLAG immunoprecipitations except the lysates were not diluted to 0.5% Nonidet P-40 before centrifugation. Protein A-agarose was prebound with JJ3 antibody (a gift from Dr. David Toft) or IgG control antibody. Isolated cytosol was diluted to 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with MENG, 20 mm Na2MoO4, 5 mg/ml BSA and applied to JJ3- and IgG-Protein A resin. Samples were rocked on ice for 2 h and subsequently washed three times with MENG, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Na2MoO4, and 50 mm NaCl. Samples were resolved using TSDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. Geldanamycin Treatment of Transfected Cells—Duplicate 10-cm2 dishes of COS-1 cells were transfected with empty vector, pcDNA3/mAhR, or pcDNA3/mAhR plus pCI/XAP2 to a total of 8 μg/dish. After 18 h transfected cells were treated with 500 nm geldanamycin or Me2SO carrier solvent for 2 h. Following geldanamycin treatment p23 immunoprecipitations were performed in the same manner as described above. Assessment of XAP2 Binding in More than One Copy—COS-1 cells were transfected in 10-cm2 dishes with pCI/XAP2-FLAG, pCI/XAP2-HA, and pcDNA3/mAhR in the combinations indicated. For each transfection pcDNA3 empty vector was used to a total of 8 μg of DNA/dish. Cytosol preparation and FLAG immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. Antibodies and Immunoblotting—TSDS-PAGE-resolved proteins were visualized by immunoblot using the following antibodies: for AhR, RPT-1 or RPT-9 (32Perdew G.H. Abbott B. Stanker L.H. Hybridoma. 1995; 14: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); for Hsp90, anti-Hsp84 and anti-Hsp86 (33Perdew G.H. Hord N. Hollenback C.E. Welsh M.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); for XAP2, ARA-9 monoclonal (Novus Biologicals) or anti-XAP2 rabbit polyclonal (Affinity BioReagents); for p23, JJ3; for FLAG, anti-FLAG (Affinity BioReagents); and for HA, anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Chemiluminescence visualization was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) combined with the SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce) and visualized with X-Omat Blue film (Kodak). For autoradiography one of two methods was used: either 125I-secondary IgG antibodies or 125I-strepdavidin (Amersham Biosciences) were used with biotin-conjugated secondary IgG antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.). Autoradiograms were visualized using Biomax MS film (Kodak). XAP2 Interaction with the AhR Complex Is Mediated through Nonpolar Amino Acid Residues—To analyze AhR function in the absence of XAP2 we desired to create a mutant form of the AhR unable to bind XAP2. We first sought to determine whether the presence of XAP2 in the AhR complex was mediated through electrostatic or nonpolar forces. To accomplish this, AhR-FLAG and XAP2 were separately in vitro translated and then incubated together followed by FLAG immunoprecipitation of the AhR. As seen in Fig. 1, washing the immunoadsorbed complexes with buffer (0.05–1 m NaCl) of increasing ionic strength had little effect on the ability of XAP2 to coprecipitate with the AhR. Conversely washing the complexes with buffer containing increasing concentrations of non-ionic detergent (0.05–0.4% deoxycholate) efficiently stripped XAP2 from the immunoprecipitated AhR. This result suggests that XAP2 association in the AhR complex is mediated by nonpolar or hydrophobic amino acids. Tyrosine 408 Is Essential for XAP2 Interaction with the AhR—Past experiments using AhR deletion constructs have determined the AhR region required for interaction with XAP2 to be contained by amino acid residues 380–419 (15Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S. Dunham E.E. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33580-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 16Meyer B.K. Perdew G.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8907-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In an attempt to create a mutant AhR that does not bind XAP2 but is otherwise unaltered we focused on mutating amino acids of the AhR that were not shared between XAP2, Hsp90, and ligand binding but were exclusive to mediating only XAP2 interaction with the AhR. It was determined by single site alanine scanning mutagenesis that tyrosine 408 (Tyr-408) is vital in maintaining stable XAP2 interaction with the AhR. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, Tyr-408 was found to be outside of the Hsp90 and ligand binding domains of the receptor. The mutation of Tyr-408 to either an alanine (AhRY408A) or lysine (AhRY408K) was created in the AhR and AhR-FLAG plasmids, and the ability of XAP2 to interact with these mutant receptors was analyzed in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2, B, C, and E) or by using in vitro translated products (Fig. 2D). COS-1 cells were transfected to express AhR-FLAG, AhRY408A-FLAG, or AhRY408K-FLAG in the presence or absence of co-expressed XAP2. After 18 h, cytosol from transfected cells was prepared, and FLAG immunoprecipitations were performed. As seen in Fig. 2B, AhRY408A-FLAG and AhRY408K-FLAG lacked the ability to bind endogenous XAP2, and each mutant showed reduced binding to XAP2 when it was co-expressed with the receptor. In vitro translated AhRY408A-FLAG and AhRY408K-FLAG were also deficient in binding to translated XAP2 when the constituents were separately translated and incubated together on ice for 1 h (Fig. 2D). Furthermore immunoprecipitation of endogenous XAP2 from COS-1 cells expressing non-FLAG-tagged AhR or AhRY408A again showed a lack of XAP2 interaction with the mutant AhR (Fig. 2E). It is important to note that Hsp90 binding to the AhR point mutants was unaltered (Fig. 2C), and therefore the reduction of XAP2 binding observed in these point mutant receptors apparently cannot be attributed to a change in the amount of Hsp90 found in the receptor complexes. AhR-YFP Point Mutant Cellular Localization Is Unaltered by Expression of XAP2—Previous reports have demonstrated that XAP2 can sequester the AhR in the cytoplasm (17LaPres J.J. Glover E. Dunham E.E. Bunger M.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6153-6159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 28Petrulis J.R. Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37448-37453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was expected that the XAP2 binding-deficient AhR mutants would display altered cellular localization compared with the non-mutant receptor. As shown in Fig. 3, expression of AhR-YFP in COS-1 cells resulted in a mostly nuclear localization of fluorescent receptor. Additionally the co-expression of XAP2 along with AhR-YFP resulted in a redistribution of fluorescence exclusively to the cytoplasm. The expression of AhRY408A-YFP or AhRY408K-YFP alone showed a similar cellular distribution of receptor compared with AhR-YFP. Unlike AhR-YFP, however, XAP2 expression had no effect on AhRY408A-YFP or AhRY408K-YFP localization confirming that direct interaction of XAP2 with the AhR is required for the cytoplasmic retention of the AhR upon co-expression of XAP2 in COS-1 cells. In a previous study using COS-1 cells (28Petrulis J.R. Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37448-37453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) it was established that AhR-YFP exhibits a mostly nuclear localization when ∼25% of AhR complexes are bound by endogenous XAP2. In this study we used slightly larger amounts (0.75 versus 0.5 μg/10-cm2 culture dish area) of receptor plasmid in each transfection. Under these conditions we would expect the non-mutant AhR-YFP to be expressed at high enough levels that less than 25% of the receptor is bound by endogenous XAP2, thus explaining a perceived inability of endogenous XAP2 to sequester the receptor in the cytoplasm. The Absence of XAP2 in the AhR Complex Results in Elevated Basal and Ligand-induced Transcriptional Activity—Contrary to reports by other laboratories (9Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8878-8884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 15Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S. Dunham E.E. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 6153-6159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that basal and ligand-induced AhR activity can be globally repressed upon the increased expression of XAP2 in COS-1 cells (21Ramadoss P. Petrulis J.R. Hollingshead B.D. Kusnadi A. Perdew G.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Petrulis J. Perdew G. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 2002; 141: 25Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Based on the XAP2-mediated effects we have observed, it was anticipated that AhR complexes lacking the functional binding of XAP2 would display altered transcriptional activity. AhR-FLAG or AhRY408A-FLAG was expressed in COS-1 cells in the presence or absence of co-expressed XAP2. Transfected cells were treated for 8 h with normal medium, Me2SO vehicle, or 1 nm TCDD, and transcriptional activity was assessed by luciferase production. As we have previously reported, basal AhR-FLAG activity was repressed by XAP2 coexpression. However, the co-expression of XAP2 with AhRY408A-FLAG had no effect on the basal transcriptional activity (Fig. 4A). Additionally ligand-induced activity of AhR-FLAG was reduced by the increased expression of XAP2, while the XAP2 binding-deficient mutant displayed the same activity in the presence or absence of exogenously expressed XAP2. Results from Fig. 4A suggest that the AhRY408A-FLAG protein displays an overall increase in transcriptional activity. To verify that the increase in activity seen with the XAP2 binding-deficient AhR mutant was not merely due to the increased expression of that protein, the experiment was repeated, and cell lysates were prepared from a subset of untreated cells following an 8-h ligand treatment with 1 nm TCDD or 10 μm benzo[a]pyrene. Western blot analysis confirmed that when AhR-FLAG, AhRY408A-FLAG, and AhRY408K-FLAG were expressed at equal levels a considerable increase in basal and"
https://openalex.org/W2042340343,"Proteasomal dysfunction may underlie certain neuro-degenerative conditions such as Parkinson disease. We have shown that pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome in cultured neuronal cells leads to apoptotic death and formation of cytoplasmic ubiquitinated inclusions. These inclusions stain for α-synuclein and assume a fibrillar structure, as assessed by thioflavine S staining, and therefore resemble Lewy bodies. α-Synuclein is thought to be a central component of Lewy bodies. Whether α-synuclein is required for inclusion formation or apoptotic death has not been formally assessed. The present study examines whether α-synuclein deficiency in neurons alters their sensitivity to proteasomal inhibition-induced apoptosis or inclusion formation. Cortical neurons derived from α-synuclein-null mice showed a similar sensitivity to death induced by the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin compared with neurons derived from wild-type mice. Furthermore, the absence of α-synuclein did not influence the percentage of lactacystin-treated neurons harboring cytoplasmic ubiquitinated inclusions or alter the solubility of such inclusions. In contrast, however, ubiquitinated inclusions in α-synuclein-deficient neurons lacked amyloid-like fibrillization, as determined by thioflavine S staining. This indicates that although α-synuclein deficiency does not affect the formation of ubiquitinated inclusions, it does significantly alter their structure. The lack of effect on survival in α-synuclein knock-out cultures further suggests that the fibrillar nature of the inclusions does not contribute to neuronal degeneration in this model. Proteasomal dysfunction may underlie certain neuro-degenerative conditions such as Parkinson disease. We have shown that pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome in cultured neuronal cells leads to apoptotic death and formation of cytoplasmic ubiquitinated inclusions. These inclusions stain for α-synuclein and assume a fibrillar structure, as assessed by thioflavine S staining, and therefore resemble Lewy bodies. α-Synuclein is thought to be a central component of Lewy bodies. Whether α-synuclein is required for inclusion formation or apoptotic death has not been formally assessed. The present study examines whether α-synuclein deficiency in neurons alters their sensitivity to proteasomal inhibition-induced apoptosis or inclusion formation. Cortical neurons derived from α-synuclein-null mice showed a similar sensitivity to death induced by the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin compared with neurons derived from wild-type mice. Furthermore, the absence of α-synuclein did not influence the percentage of lactacystin-treated neurons harboring cytoplasmic ubiquitinated inclusions or alter the solubility of such inclusions. In contrast, however, ubiquitinated inclusions in α-synuclein-deficient neurons lacked amyloid-like fibrillization, as determined by thioflavine S staining. This indicates that although α-synuclein deficiency does not affect the formation of ubiquitinated inclusions, it does significantly alter their structure. The lack of effect on survival in α-synuclein knock-out cultures further suggests that the fibrillar nature of the inclusions does not contribute to neuronal degeneration in this model. Since the identification of two α-synuclein mutations that are linked to the development of autosomal dominant Parkinson disease (PD) 1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson disease; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; LBs, Lewy bodies; WT, wild-type; DIV, days in vitro; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HMW, higher molecular weight; KO, knock-out.1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson disease; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; LBs, Lewy bodies; WT, wild-type; DIV, days in vitro; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HMW, higher molecular weight; KO, knock-out.

Additional genetic abnormalities have since been described in patients with PD, including mutations in the genes encoding for Parkin (3Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar) and UCH-L1 (4Leroy E. Boyer R. Auburger G. Leube B. Ulm G. Mezey E. Harta G.

These two proteins are notable in that they are both involved in proteasomal-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, linking dysfunction of ubiquitin-dependent protein clearance to the pathogenesis of PD (5Lang-Rollin I. Rideout H. Stefanis L. Histol. Histopathol. 2003; 18: 509-517PubMed Google Scholar). Parkin has E3 ligase activity, which is sensitive to PD-linked mutations (6Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y.

UCH-L1 is a neuronal-specific protein that mediates the de-ubiquitination of proteins and the cleavage of pro-ubiquitin polypeptides into monomeric ubiquitin (4Leroy E. Boyer R. Auburger G. Leube B. Ulm G. Mezey E. Harta G. Brownstein M.J. Jonnalagada S. Chernova T. Dehejia A. Lavedan C. Gasser T. Steinbach P.J. Wilkinson K.D. Polymeropoulos M.H.

More recent data suggest that the main function of UCH-L1 is to stabilize monomeric ubiquitin (8Osaka H. Wang Y.L. Takada K. Takizawa S. Setsuie R. Li H. Sato Y. Nishikawa K. Sun Y.J. Sakurai M.

Another report suggests that UCH-L1 has an additional E3 ligase activity that may be more relevant to its relationship to PD (9Liu Y. Fallon L. Lashuel H.A. Liu Z. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 2002; 111: 209-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). In addition, α-synuclein may associate with the 19 S or the 20 S proteasome (10Ghee M. Fournier A.

It is a natively unfolded protein and aggregates in vitro following an ordered transition to an oligomeric protofibril and ultimately to a fibrillar β-pleated sheet structure. Regions within α-synuclein have been identified that mediate or are necessary for such oligomerization or aggregation of the protein (16Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 11: 1318-1320Crossref Scopus (1242) Google Scholar, 17Giasson B.I. Uryu K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Biol.

Neurobiol. 2004; 30: 1-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α-Synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies (LBs) in PD, and purified LBs have been shown to contain aggregated α-synuclein (19Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (5968) Google Scholar, 20Baba M. Nakajo S. Tu P.H. Tomita T. Nakaya K. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Iwatsubo T. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 154: 879-884Google Scholar). Despite its abundance within LBs, it is, however, not clear whether α-synuclein is required for their formation or is involved in mediating toxicity associated with these structures.The data concerning the role of α-synuclein in cell death are somewhat contradictory. Several groups have reported that overexpression of mutant and, in some cases, wild-type (WT) α-synuclein directly induces death of various cell types (e.g. see Refs. 21Ostrerova N. Petrucelli L. Farrer M. Mehta N. Choi P. Hardy J. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Saha A.R. Ninkina N.N. Hanger D.P. Anderton B.H. Davies A.M. Buchman V.L. Eur. J.

In contrast, several reports suggest a survival-promoting activity of WT or even mutant α-synuclein (25Da Costa C.A. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 26Da Costa C. Paitel E. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3095-3099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the potential role of α-synuclein in cell death path-ways remains unclear.In addition to genetic data, pathological evidence indicates that proteasomal dysfunction occurs in the substantia nigra of PD patients (28McNaught K.S. Jenner P. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 297: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 29Tofaris G.K. Razzaq A. Ghetti B. Lilley K.S. Spillantini M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44405-44411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We have used pharmacological inhibitors of the proteasome to model such pathological features of PD. Proteasomal inhibition of cultured rat cortical neurons induces apoptotic death (30Qiu J.H. Asai A. Chi S. Saito N. Hamada H. Kirino T. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 259-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Rideout H.J. Stefanis L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions that contain, among other proteins, ubiquitin and α-synuclein (31Rideout H.J. Stefanis L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cell death and inclusion formation have also been observed in dopaminergic PC12 cells (32Rideout H.J. Larsen K.L. Sulzer D. Stefanis L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) as well as cultured ventral midbrain neurons (33McNaught K.S. Mytilineou C. Jnobaptiste R. Yabut J. Shashidharan P. Jenner P. Olanow C.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and in vivo following infusion of the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin into the substantia nigra (34McNaught K.S. Bjorklund L.M. Belizaire R. Isacson O. Jenner P. Olanow C.W. Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). An important feature of the cellular inclusions induced by inhibition of the proteasome is that they possess a fibrillar structure reminiscent of LBs and other inclusions, as revealed by the fluorescent histochemical marker thioflavine S (31Rideout H.J. Stefanis L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The formation of ubiquitinated inclusions in this model is a regulated process requiring ubiquitination of specific substrates and transcription (31Rideout H.J. Stefanis L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, as with LBs, it is not clear whether α-synuclein is required for their formation.In the present work, we address the following questions. 1) What is the conformation of α-synuclein within cortical neuronal inclusions following proteasome inhibition? 2) What is the effect of lack of α-synuclein on the formation, solubility, and structure of such inclusions? 3) Does lack of α-synuclein alter the sensitivity of cortical neurons to proteasomal inhibition-induced death?EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Genotyping—Rat embryonic cortical neurons were prepared as described (31Rideout H.J. Stefanis L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 35Stefanis L. Park D.S. Friedman W.J. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6235-6247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α-Synuclein +/+, +/–, or –/– neurons (36Dauer W.T. Kholodilov N. Vila M. Trillat A.C. Goodchild R. Larsen K.E. Staal R. Tieu K. Schmitz Y. Yuan C.A. Rocha M. Jackson-Lewis V. Hersch S. Sulzer D. Przedborski S. Burke R. Hen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14524-14529Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) were obtained from embryonic day 16 mouse embryos resulting from heterozygous matings as described (37Dietrich P. Rideout H.J. Wang Q. Stefanis L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 430-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Genotyping was performed on each individual embryo by PCR from tail DNA. The primers used were as follows: 1) SYN6591, TCA CAC TTA CAC CAG GAC TTG G and 2) SYN7005, GTC CCT GTT TGT TTC TGA GAG C to detect the wild-type allele; and 3) synNEO, ATG GAA GGA TTG GAG CTA CGG G to detect the targeted allele.Induction of Neuronal Death—Cortical neurons were cultured for 3 or 10 days in vitro (DIV) before application of reagents. The reason these two time points were selected was that, as we have previously reported, there is a marked induction of the levels of α-synuclein during this period in rat cortical neuron cultures (38Rideout H.J. Dietrich P. Savalle M. Dauer W.T. Stefanis L. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A similar induction is seen between DIV 3 and DIV 10 in embryonic day 16 mouse cortical neurons (data not shown). On DIV 3 or 10, the inhibitor of the 20 S proteasome lactacystin (39Fenteany G. Schreiber S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) was added to the cultures. At indicated times following addition of lactacystin (10 μm) or camptothecin (10 μm), cells were lysed and neuronal viability was estimated using counts of intact nuclei as described previously. (35Stefanis L. Park D.S. Friedman W.J. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6235-6247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total surviving neurons are expressed as the percentage of untreated cultures at the time of cell lysis. In parallel experiments, the percentage of apoptotic nuclei, as an index of neuronal cell death, was assessed using the nuclear dye Hoechst 33342 (Sigma, 1 μg/ml) as described previously (35Stefanis L. Park D.S. Friedman W.J. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6235-6247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence—Neurons grown on glass coverslips were fixed in freshly prepared 3.7% formaldehyde for 25 min at 4 °C and then incubated with 10% normal goat serum with 0.4% Triton X-100 to block nonspecific binding, followed by incubation with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Specific antibodies used were rabbit anti-ubiquitin (1:100; Dako), mouse anti-polyubiquitin (1:200; Affinity), or mouse anti-synuclein-1 (1:50; Transduction Laboratories). Following incubation with fluorescent secondary antibodies (Cy2, 1:100 or Cy3, 1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch), coverslips were placed on glass slides and visualized using standard epifluorescence or confocal microscopy (Ziess LSM410). For thioflavine S staining, freshly fixed cells were incubated with 0.05% thioflavine S in phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma), washed for 5 min three times with 80% EtOH, and then blocked for subsequent immunostaining.For counts of ubiquitin- and thioflavine S-positive cytoplasmic inclusions, stained coverslips were observed by a rater blinded to both the genotype and the experimental condition using standard epifluorescence (100× magnification). From three to four coverslips per individual embryo, 100 cells were observed each and assessed for the presence of discrete ubiquitin- or thioflavine S-positive cytoplasmic inclusions as described previously (31Rideout H.J. Stefanis L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The data were pooled from embryos of the same genotype for analysis.For in situ extraction of soluble protein (31Rideout H.J. Stefanis L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), cells were incubated with detergent-containing extraction buffer (85 mm PIPES, pH 6.94, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)) for 10 min at room temperature, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed as above with 3.7% formaldehyde for 25 min at 4 °C. The fixed cells were then processed as described for anti-ubiquitin. We have previously shown that proteasome inhibitor-treated rat cortical neurons show insoluble ubiquitinated inclusions that are resistant to such extraction (31Rideout H.J. Stefanis L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Western Immunoblotting—Rat cortical neurons exposed at DIV 3 or DIV 10 to lactacystin (10 μm) for 30 h were incubated, as described above, with detergent-containing extraction buffer at room temperature for 10 min. The soluble extracted material in the buffer was removed, and the remaining insoluble material was scraped in the same buffer and solubilized by sonication. The samples were diluted in SDS-sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-synuclein 1 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories; 1:1000) or rabbit anti-α-synuclein (1:500; generously provided by Dr. Janetta Culvenor, University of Melbourne) (40Culvenor J.G. McLean C.A. Cutt S. Campbell B.C.V. Maher F. Jakala P. Hartmann T. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Li Q.-X. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1173-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse or rabbit antibodies (Pierce; 1:10000) and developed with SuperSignal West (Pierce). Equal protein loading was assessed by Ponceau S staining or stripping of the membranes and probing for mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma; 1:20,000).RESULTSα-Synuclein Accumulates within Insoluble Inclusions in Proteasome Inhibitor-treated Rat Cortical Neurons—We have previously demonstrated that the ubiquitinated inclusions formed following proteasomal inhibition resist in situ extraction by a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (31Rideout H.J. Stefanis L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the α-synuclein that we had identified within such inclusions would also be detergent-insoluble we performed similar in situ extraction of embryonic day 18 rat cortical neurons cultured for 10 days (DIV 10) and then treated with lactacystin (10 μm, 30 h) or vehicle (control). Cultures were then fixed and immunostained for anti-ubiquitin and anti-α-synuclein. Control cultures of rat embryonic cortical neurons showed little cytoplasmic ubiquitin and α-synuclein immunostaining following in situ extraction (Fig. 1A, top panel). In contrast, lactacystin-treated cultures showed a dramatic accumulation of ubiquitin immunoreactivity distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm (not shown) or organized within discrete cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. 1A, bottom panel, arrow) as we have reported previously (31Rideout H.J. Stefanis L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Many of the ubiquitin-positive inclusions also showed clear α-synuclein co-localization (Fig. 1A, arrow). Similar results were obtained with DIV 3 cultures (data not shown).Oligomerization of Detergent-insoluble α-Synuclein following Inhibition of the Proteasome—The results presented above indicate that α-synuclein accumulates within detergent-resistant inclusions in proteasome inhibitor-treated neurons. To determine the nature of α-synuclein within such inclusions, we performed Western immunoblot analysis of the detergent-insoluble fractions. Using a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against synuclein-1, we observed a reduction in the 15-kDa α-synuclein monomer band (Fig. 1B, asterisk) in lactacystin-treated samples. Upon longer exposure of the film we observed two higher molecular weight (HMW) bands in lysates derived from lactacystin-treated neurons migrating at Mr ∼45,000–50,000 and 65,000–70,000. These bands are present in multiple independent samples derived from lactacystin-treated cultures (Fig. 1B, arrows). The sizes of the HMW α-synuclein immuno-reactive bands do not indicate ubiquitination, which would be represented by multiple bands separated by Mr ∼8,000. It is likely that the bands we have identified with this antibody represent oligomeric forms of α-synuclein, in particular a trimer and a tetramer. Similar findings were obtained with DIV 3 cortical neuronal cultures (data not shown).To confirm the formation of the HMW oligomeric α-synuclein species, we utilized a second antibody raised against the C terminus of human α-synuclein. The monomeric form of α-synuclein is indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 1C, whereas the HMW oligomeric species are indicated by brackets. This α-synuclein antibody provided an increased sensitivity in detecting the HMW oligomeric species compared with the mouse monoclonal antibody (compare Fig. 1B and 1C). There are three apparent clusters of HMW α-synuclein oligomers in lactacystin-treated detergent-insoluble fractions migrating at Mr ∼31,000–35,000, 43,000–49,000, and 65,000–70,000 (Fig. 1C). These clusters confirm the oligomerization of α-synuclein revealed by the mouse monoclonal synuclein-1 antibody. The additional bands detected by this antibody may represent other post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. We conclude that α-synuclein is at least partially present in an oligomeric form within detergent-insoluble inclusions in neurons treated with lactacystin.Deletion of α-Synuclein Does Not Alter Neuronal Sensitivity to Apoptotic Stimuli—Given the relationship between α-synuclein and the proteasome as well as the reported effects of α-synuclein on the apoptotic pathway, we wished to determine whether lack of α-synuclein would have an effect on neuronal survival/death following exposure to lactacystin. To this end, we used cultures derived from WT or knock-out (KO) α-synuclein mice (36Dauer W.T. Kholodilov N. Vila M. Trillat A.C. Goodchild R. Larsen K.E. Staal R. Tieu K. Schmitz Y. Yuan C.A. Rocha M. Jackson-Lewis V. Hersch S. Sulzer D. Przedborski S. Burke R. Hen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14524-14529Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). There was no difference in survival, as assessed by counts of intact nuclei (Fig. 2A) or apoptosis, as assessed by counts of apoptotic nuclei (Fig. 2B) between WT and α-synuclein KO cultured cortical neurons.Fig. 2The absence of α-synuclein does not alter the sensitivity of cortical neurons to various cell death agents. Mouse embryonic cortical neurons were plated in 96-well plates for counts of intact nuclei (A) or on glass coverslips for counts of apoptotic nuclei (B). In A, neurons cultured for 3 or 10 DIV were exposed to the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (10 μm, 24 h), the cells were lysed, and intact nuclei were counted. Survival was expressed relative to untreated control neurons within the same genotype. Other cells were exposed to the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin (10 μm, 12 h) and lysed and counted similarly. Note that there is no significant difference in survival in response to either agent between wild-type or α-synuclein knock-out cultures. The number above each bar represents the number of individual embryos that were assessed. In B, neurons were cultured for 3 or 10 DIV prior to exposure to lactacystin (10 μm) for 16 or 24 h, fixed, and stained with the nucleic acid dye Hoechst. The numbers represent the percentage of apoptotic nuclei. The number of individual embryos assessed is shown in the legend. Note that as with intact nuclear counts, there is no significant difference in the induction of apoptotic death in neurons from wild-type or α-synuclein knock-out embryos. In all cases, counts were performed by a rater blind to the genotype.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To investigate whether the lack of effect of deleting α-synuclein was specific for the apoptotic stimulus of proteasomal inhibition, we also tested the effects of the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin on these cultures. We and others have previously reported that this agent induces apoptotic death of postmitotic neurons (35Stefanis L. Park D.S. Friedman W.J. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6235-6247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Morris E.J. Geller H.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 757-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Again, there was no difference in survival or apoptosis between WT and α-synuclein KO neurons (Fig. 2, A and B). We conclude that deleting α-synuclein has no significant impact on survival of embryonic cortical neurons exposed to apoptotic stimuli and, in particular, to proteasomal inhibition.Absence of α-Synuclein Does Not Alter the Number or the Solubility of Ubiquitinated Inclusions Formed following Lactacystin Treatment—Given the correlation between α-synuclein and cytoplasmic inclusions, we wished to investigate whether its presence was required for inclusion formation in this model. We therefore treated α-synuclein WT and KO cortical neurons with lactacystin and 16 and 24 h later assessed the percentage of neurons that showed cytoplasmic ubiquitinated inclusions. There was no difference between the two genotypes (Fig. 3).Fig. 3The absence of α-synuclein does not affect the formation of ubiquitinated inclusions in cortical neurons exposed to proteasome inhibition. Embryonic cortical neurons from wild-type (filled bars) or α-synuclein knock-out (open bars) were cultured on glass coverslips for 3 or 10 DIV, exposed to lactacystin (10 μm) for 16 or 24 h, fixed, and immunostained for ubiquitin. The percentage of neurons harboring single cytoplasmic ubiquitin-positive inclusions was determined by a rater blind to the experimental conditions and genotype. The number of individual embryos assessed is indicated in the legend. Note that cortical neurons from wild-type and α-synuclein knock-out embryos show the same extent of ubiquitinated inclusion formation in response to inhibition of the proteasome with lactacystin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The possibility existed that α-synuclein may not alter the initial formation of the inclusions but may alter their subsequent solubility through its aggregating properties. Using the same in situ detergent extraction method as in Fig. 1, we were unable to find a significant difference between the two genotypes in terms of detergent-insoluble ubiquitinated inclusions (Fig. 4, A and B).Fig. 4The absence of α-synuclein does not affect the solubility of ubiquitinated inclusions formed in cortical neurons following proteasome inhibition. A, cortical neurons were prepared from wild-type or α-synuclein knock-out embryos and grown on glass coverslips for 3 DIV, exposed to lactacystin (10 μm, 24 h) extracted in situ with 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer, fixed, and immunostained for ubiquitin. Note the prominent insoluble ubiquitinated inclusion (arrows) in lactacystin-treated neurons from wild-type and α-synuclein knock-out embryos. B, stained coverslips were examined by a rater blind to the genotype and experimental condition to determine the percentage of neurons harboring detergent-insoluble ubiquitinated inclusions.

https://openalex.org/W2033748171,"Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) is a potent motogen for vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). To understand its motogenic signaling events, we have studied the role of the Janus-activated kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/STAT) pathway and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). PDGF-BB stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak-2 and STAT-3 in a time-dependent manner in VSMCs. In addition, AG490 and Jak-2KEpRK5, a selective pharmacological inhibitor and a dominant negative mutant, respectively, of Jak-2, attenuated PDGF-BB-induced STAT-3 tyrosine phosphorylation and its DNA binding and reporter gene activities. PDGF-BB induced VSMC motility in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum effect at 10 ng/ml. Dominant negative mutant-dependent suppression of Jak-2 and STAT-3 blocked PDGF-BB-induced VSMC motility. PDGF-BB induced the expression of cPLA2 in a Jak-2/STAT-3-dependent manner, and pharmacological inhibitors of cPLA2 prevented PDGFBB-induced VSMC motility. Furthermore, either exogenous addition of arachidonic acid or forced expression of cPLA2 rescued PDGF-BB-induced VSMC motility from inhibition by blockade of Jak-2 and STAT-3 activation. Together, these results for the first time show that PDGF-BB-induced VSMC motility requires activation of the Jak-2/STAT-3/cPLA2 signaling axis.

The dysfunctional endothelial cells and inflammatory cells at the site of vascular injury produce a large number of molecules with a broad spectrum of biological activities (1Ross R. N. Engl. J.

The availability of these substances at the site of vascular injury, therefore, provides a permissive milieu for VSMC dedifferentiation (9Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The dedifferentiated VSMCs gain their embryonic non-contractile and synthetic state phenotype and contribute to the progression of lesions such as restenosis after angioplasty via their migration from media to intima and multiplication in intima (10Regan C.P. Adam P.J. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Several studies have reported that inhibition of expression of the molecules that are produced at the site of vascular injury or suppression of their biological activities regresses the lesion development (11Ferns G.A.A.

As a large number of molecules are involved in the formation of arterial wall lesions, identifying the unifying mechanisms of these molecules may eventually lead to development of better therapeutic agents against these vascular lesions. Janus-activated kinases (Jaks) are a group of non-receptor tyrosine kinases that via tyrosine phosphorylation modulate the activities of a group of transcriptional factors, namely signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) (13Darnell Jr., J.E.

A large body of data indicates that STATs play an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (15Fukuda T. Ohtani T. Yoshida Y. Shirogane T. Nishida K. Nakajima K.

Arachidonic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, is an important component of membrane phospholipids and is released acutely in response to a variety of agents, including growth factors, cytokines, hormones, and oxidants (18Piomelli D.

Upon release, it is either metabolized via the cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, or cytochrome P450 monooxygenase pathways producing prostaglandins, hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids, and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, respectively, or is reincorporated into membrane phospholipids via esterification involving arachidonoyl-CoA synthase and arachidonoyl-lysophospholipid transferase (18Piomelli D.

Among the large family of phospholipase A2s characterized thus far, cPLA2 appears to be one of the major sources of arachidonic acid release and therefore one of the major sources of production of the eicosanoid metabolites of arachidonic acid in response to various agonists in different cell types (36Fujishima H.

Recently, we have reported that activation of the Jak/STAT pathway is required for PDGF-BB-induced cPLA2 expression and proliferation in VSMCs (39Yellaturu C.R. Rao G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9986-9992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). PDGF-BB is also a potent motogen for VSMCs and is involved in the migration of VSMCs from media to intima leading to neointima formation (4Jawien A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Lindner V. Schwartz S.M. Clowes A.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 89: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 5Kalmes A. Vesti B.R. Daum G. Abraham J.A. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular events of PDGF-BB-induced motility in VSMCs, we now have studied the role of Jak-2/STAT-3 and cPLA2. Here, we report for the first time that PDGF-BB induces VSMC motility via activation of Jak-2/STAT-3, which targets the induction of expression of cPLA2. Reagents—Aprotinin, dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium orthovanadate, sodium deoxycholate, leupeptin, and HEPES were purchased from Sigma. AG490 was obtained from Calbiochem. Arachidonic acid was purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Anti-cPLA2 antibodies (2832) and phospho-specific anti-STAT-3 (9131S) antibodies were procured from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Phospho-specific anti-Jak-2 (44-426Z) antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Jak-2 (SC-294) and anti-STAT-3 (SC-482) antibodies and consensus STAT-3 oligonucleotide (5′-GATCCTTCTGGGAATTCCTAGATC-3′, 3′-CTAGGAAGACCCTTAAGGATCTAG-5′) (SC-2571) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cell Culture—VSMCs were isolated from the thoracic aortae of male Sprague-Dawley rats by enzymatic dissociation as described earlier (40Rao G.N. Katki K.A. Madamanchi N.R. Wu Y. Birrer M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6003-6010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were growth-arrested by incubating in DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum for 72 h and were used to perform the experiments unless otherwise stated. Cell Motility—VSMC motility was measured by cell-wounding assay (41Zhuang D. Ceacareanu A.C. Lin Y. Ceacareanu B. Dixit M. Chapman K.E. Waters C.M. Rao G.N. Hassid A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H2103-H2112Google Scholar). Quiescent confluent monolayers of VSMCs were wounded with a sterile pipette tip to generate a cell-free gap of ∼1 mm in width, and the wound location in the culture dish was marked. Cells were washed, and fresh serum-free DMEM was added and photographed to record the wound width at 0 h. To prevent replicative DNA synthesis, hydroxyurea was added to the medium to a final concentration of 5 mm just before the addition of agonist. Twenty-four h after the appropriate treatments, photographs were taken again at the marked wound location. Cell migration was measured using the NIH Image 1.62 program, and the cell motility was expressed as distance migrated in μm units. To test the effect of dominant negative mutants of Jak-2 and STAT-3 on PDGFBB-induced motility, cells were first transfected with Jak-2KEpRK5 or FS3DM for 48 h and quiesced before they were subjected to agonist-induced motility. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared from treated or untreated VSMCs as described previously (40Rao G.N. Katki K.A. Madamanchi N.R. Wu Y. Birrer M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6003-6010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The protein content of the nuclear extracts was determined using a Micro BCA™ protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Protein-DNA complexes were formed by incubating 5 μg of nuclear protein in a total volume of 20 μl consisting of 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 3 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 15% glycerol, and 100,000 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe for 30 min on ice. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel using 1× Tris-glycine-EDTA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 200 mm glycine, 0.1 mm EDTA). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using the T4 polynucleotide kinase kit (Promega) following the supplier's protocol. Western Blot Analysis—After appropriate treatments, VSMCs were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Cells were lysed by thawing in 250 μl of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and scraped into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. After standing on ice for 20 min, the cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell extracts containing an equal amount of protein were resolved by electrophoresis on 0.1% SDS and 10% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences). After blocking in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, the membrane was treated with appropriate primary antibodies followed by incubation with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using a chemiluminescence reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences). Transient Transfection and CAT Assay—VSMCs were plated evenly onto 100-mm dishes and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. At 50–80% confluence, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum, and cells were transfected with pSIE-CAT plasmid using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Thirty h after transfection, VSMCs were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of AG490 (25 μm) for 4 h, and cell extracts were prepared. Wherever the effect of dominant negative STAT-3 mutant was tested on agonist-induced CAT activity, cells were co-transfected with FS3DM and pSIE-CAT plasmids. VSMC extracts were normalized for protein and assayed for CAT activity using [14C]chloramphenicol and acetyl coenzyme A as substrates. The substrate and products were extracted with ethyl acetate, separated by thin layer chromatography, and subjected to autoradiography. Statistics—All of the experiments were repeated three times with similar results. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. The treatment effects were analyzed by Student's t test. p values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. In the case of CAT activity, EMSA, and Western blot analysis, one representative set of data is shown. To understand the signaling events underlying PDGF-BB-induced motility in VSMCs, we have studied the role of the Jak/STAT pathway. Quiescent VSMCs were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for various times, and cell extracts were prepared. An equal amount of protein from the control and each treatment was analyzed by Western blotting for tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak-2 and STAT-3 using their phospho-specific antibodies. PDGF-BB stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of both Jak-2 and STAT-3 in a time-dependent manner with a maximum effect of about 20-fold at 10 min and reaching basal levels by 4 h (Fig. 1). Jaks phosphorylate STATs on tyrosine residues and activate them, although other mechanisms were also reported to be involved in the activation of these transcriptional factors (42Nguyen H. Ramana C.V. Bayes J. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33361-33368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 43Sachsenmaier C. Sadowski H.B. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3583-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To find whether PDGFBB-stimulated STAT-3 tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by Jak-2, we tested the effect of AG490, a potent and specific inhibitor of Jak-2 (44Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). AG490 (25 μm) significantly inhibited PDGF-BB-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 (Fig. 2, upper left panel). To confirm the pharmacological effect of AG490 on PDGF-BB-induced STAT-3 phosphorylation, we next tested the effect of dominant negative Jak-2 (Jak-2KEpRK5). Forced expression of Jak-2KEpRK5 also reduced PDGF-BB-induced STAT-3 phosphorylation by about 50% (Fig. 2, upper right and lower panels).Fig. 2AG490 and Jak-2KEpRK5, a specific pharmacological inhibitor and a dominant negative mutant, respectively, of Jak-2, attenuate PDGF-BB-induced STAT-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Quiescent VSMCs were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of AG490 (25 μm) for the indicated times, and cell extracts were prepared. An equal amount of protein from the control and each treatment was analyzed by Western blotting for pSTAT-3 using its phospho-specific antibodies. To test the effect of Jak-2KEpRK5 on STAT-3 tyrosine phosphorylation, VSMCs were transfected first with and without Jak-2KEpRK5 and quiesced. Cells were then treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for 10 min, and cell extracts were prepared. An equal amount of protein from the control and each treatment was analyzed for pSTAT-3 as described above. As a loading control, the blots were reprobed with anti-STAT-3 antibodies. The bar graph represents the quantitative data of three independent experiments on the effect of dominant negative Jak-2 (DnJak-2) on PDGF-BB-induced STAT-3 tyrosine phosphorylation. *, p < 0.01 versus control; **, p < 0.01 versus PDGF-BB treatment alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Upon tyrosine phosphorylation, STATs undergo either homo- or heterodimerization and translocate to the nucleus, where they bind (in this case STAT-3) to their consensus DNA binding sequence present in the promoter regions of genes and induce transcription (13Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar, 45Ehret G.B. Reichenbach P. Schindler U. Horvath C.M. Fritz S. Nabholz M. Bucher P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6675-6688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). To find whether tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 correlates with an increase in its transcriptional activation, its DNA binding activity was measured. Quiescent VSMCs were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for 2 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared. Equal amounts of nuclear protein from the control and each treatment were analyzed by EMSA for STAT-3-DNA binding activity using 32P-labeled consensus STAT-3 oligonucleotide as a probe. PDGF-BB increased STAT-3-DNA binding activity by 4-fold, and it was inhibited by AG490 (Fig. 3A, left panel). Forced expression of either dominant negative Jak-2 (Jak-2KEpRK5) or STAT-3 (FS3DM) also substantially reduced PDGF-BB-induced STAT-3-DNA binding activity (Fig. 3A, right panel). To confirm that increased STAT-3-DNA binding activity leads to an increase in its transactivation activity, VSMCs were transiently transfected with a STAT-3-dependent reporter plasmid, pSIE-CAT, quiesced, and treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for 4 h, and cell extracts were prepared. Cell extracts normalized for protein were assayed for CAT activity. PDGF-BB induced STAT-3-dependent CAT activity by 3-fold, and AG490 substantially inhibited this response (Fig. 3B, left panel). FS3DM also blocked PDGF-BB-induced STAT-3-dependent CAT activity (Fig. 3B, right panel). These findings are consistent with our previous observations on PDGF-BB activation of the Jak/STAT pathway (39Yellaturu C.R. Rao G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9986-9992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To understand the role of the Jak/STAT pathway in PDGF-BB-induced VSMC motility, we first studied a dose-response effect of PDGF-BB. A cell-free gap was generated in a monolayer of quiescent VSMCs as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cells were then treated with and without various doses of PDGF-BB for 24 h, and cell motility was measured. As shown in Fig. 4A, PDGF-BB induced VSMC motility in a dose-dependent manner. Maximum VSMC motility was observed in response to 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB. We now examined the effect of Jak-2KEpRK5 and FS3DM. Forced expression of either Jak-2KEpRK5 or FS3DM significantly prevented PDGF-BB-induced VSMC motility (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4PDGF-BB induces VSMC motility in a Jak-2/STAT-3-dependent manner.A, a cell-free gap was made in a monolayer of quiescent VSMCs and treated with and without various doses of PDGF-BB for 24 h, and cell motility was measured using the NIH Image 1.62 program.

Because cPLA2 plays a predominant role in arachidonic acid release in response to a variety of bioactive agents including growth factors (27Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G.J. Hage W.J. deLaat S.W.

To test this possibility, quiescent VSMCs were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for various times, and cell extracts were prepared. An equal amount of protein from control and PDGF-BB-treated cells was analyzed by Western blotting for cPLA2 using its specific antibodies. PDGF-BB induced cPLA2 expression in a time-dependent manner with 2- and 3-fold increases at 8 and 16 h of treatment, respectively (Fig. 5A). PDGF-BB also induced the expression of cPLA2 mRNA by 4- and 5-fold at 8 and 16 h of treatment, respectively, as measured by Northern blot analysis using 32P-labeled rat cPLA2 cDNA probe. 2N. Dronadula et al., unpublished observations. To understand whether the Jak/STAT pathway plays a role in PDGF-BB-induced expression of cPLA2, we next studied the effect of AG490. AG490 completely inhibited PDGF-BB-induced cPLA2 expression (Fig. 5B). To obtain additional evidence on the role of the Jak/STAT pathway in PDGF-BB-induced cPLA2 expression, we tested the effect of dominant negative Jak-2 and STAT-3 mutants, Jak-2KEpRK5 and FS3DM, respectively (17Wu Y.Y. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2147-2156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 53Feng J. Witthuhn B.A. Matsuda T. Kohlhuber F. Kerr I.M. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2497-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, forced expression of Jak-2KEpRK5 or FS3DM also blocked PDGF-BB-induced expression of cPLA2. Next we examined the role of cPLA2 in PDGF-BB-induced VSMC motility using a pharmacological approach. Use of methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) and palmitoyl trifluoromethyl ketone (PACOCF3), two structurally different and specific inhibitors of cPLA2 (38Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 54Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), significantly blocked PDGF-BB-induced VSMC motility (Fig. 6). If Jak-2/STAT-3 signaling mediates PDGF-BB-induced VSMC motility via induction of expression of cPLA2, then one would expect that exogenous addition of arachidonic acid would rescue PDGFBB-induced VSMC motility from inhibition by blockade of Jak-2/STAT-3 activation. To test this, a cell-free gap was made in a monolayer of quiescent VSMCs that were forced to express FS3DM and treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of exogenously added arachidonic acid (5 μm) for 24 h, and cell motility was measured. As shown in Fig. 7, arachidonic acid rescued PDGF-B-induced VSMC motility from inhibition by FS3DM. Exogenous arachidonic acid (5 μm) also surpassed the inhibitory effect of AG490 on PDGF-BB-induced VSMC motility (Fig. 7). To confirm this result further, VSMCs were co-transfected with dominant negative Jak-2 (Jak-2KEpRK5) or STAT-3 (FS3DM) along with and without an expression plasmid for rat cPLA2 (pcDNA3-cPLA2), quiesced, and treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for 24 h, and cell motility was measured.

This conclusion is supported by the following observations. 1) PDGF-BB stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak-2 and STAT-3 in a time-dependent manner. 2) The tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 and its DNA binding and reporter gene activities induced by PDGF-BB are mediated by Jak-2 as its inhibition by pharmacological and dominant negative mutant approaches suppressed the activation of STAT-3. 3) Jak-2-dependent STAT-3 activation is required for VSMC motility induced by PDGF-BB as dominant negative mutants of these signaling molecules prevented the VSMC motility in response to this agonist. 4) PDGF-BB-induced cPLA2 expression is sensitive to inhibition by dominant negative mutants of Jak-2 and STAT-3. 5) Pharmacological inhibition of cPLA2 blocked PDGFBB-induced VSMC motility. 6) Exogenous addition of arachidonic acid rescued PDGF-BB-induced VSMC motility from inhibition by blockade of Jak-2 and STAT-3 activation. 7) Forced expression of rat cPLA2 also overcame the inhibitory effect of dominant negative Jak-2 and STAT-3 on PDGF-BB-induced VSMC motility. In addition to its role in cell proliferation and differentiation (15Fukuda T. Ohtani T. Yoshida Y. Shirogane T. Nishida K. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Hirano T.

In this regard, the present study provides evidence for a role of cPLA2 as one of the distal molecules in Jak-2/STAT-3-mediated cell migration. Analysis of both human and rat cPLA2 promoters for regulatory elements also revealed the presence of several binding sequences for STATs (57Wu T. Ikezono T. Angus C.W. Shelhamer J.H.

It was reported that arachidonic acid and its eicosanoid metabolites play a role in cell migration (46Ott V.L. Cambier J.C. Kappler J. Marrack P. Swanson B.J. Nat.

Arachidonic acid and its eicosanoid metabolites have also been shown to activate GTPases via inhibition of GTPase-activating proteins (29Golubic M. Tanaka K. Dobrowolski S. Wood D. Tsai M.H.

Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). Based on these observations it is presumable that Jak-2/STAT-3-mediated cPLA2 expression may be involved in a sustained arachidonic acid release producing eicosanoids, which in turn promote VSMC chemotaxis. A large body of evidence indicates that cPLA2 mediates the release of arachidonic acid and, thereby, eicosanoid production in response to a variety of bioactive agents (18Piomelli D. Curr. Opin.

In earlier studies, we have reported that Jak-2/STAT-3 mediates PDGF-BB-induced arachidonic acid release in VSMCs (39Yellaturu C.R. Rao G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9986-9992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid, while serving as a precursor for the production of biologically important lipid mediators, is also a crucial component for membrane phospholipid remodeling. Phospholipase A2s via production of arachidonic acid and lipid mediators have been reported to play a role in membrane phospholipid remodeling (59Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8527-8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 60Serhan C.N. Haeggstrom J.Z. Leslie C.C. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1147-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane protrusion, retraction, and contraction forces that are essential for cell motility involve membrane phospholipid remodeling. In this regard, it is tempting to speculate that Jak-2/STAT-3-dependent cPLA2 expression may be involved in membrane phospholipid remodeling during cell motility. Future studies are required to test the role of the Jak/STAT/cPLA2 signaling axis in PDGF-BB-induced cytoskeleton and membrane phospholipid remodeling. In summary, the present study demonstrates for the first time that Jak-2/STAT-3 mediates PDGF-BB-induced motility in VSMCs via targeting the induction of expression of cPLA2. We thank Drs. James N. Ihle, Ralph A. Bradshaw, and Howard Young for providing Jak-2KEpRK5, pFS3DM, and pSIE-CAT plasmids, respectively. We also are grateful to Dr. Chandrahasa R.

Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Class 1A and 1B enzymes represent the major receptor-regulated kinases and are heterodimers composed of a regulatory subunit and a catalytic subunit. The three major isoforms of the Class 1A catalytic subunits have molecular masses of about 110 kDa and are termed α, β, and δ. Although there are multiple spliced isoforms of the p85 regulatory subunit for these p110 isoforms, the full-length molecule has two SH2 domains and a SH3 domain that interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (1Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4681) Google Scholar, 2Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Thus, the Class 1A enzymes are markedly stimulated by growth factors and other stimuli that activate receptor tyrosine kinases (1Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4681) Google Scholar, 2Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The Class 1B catalytic subunit also has a molecular mass of 110 kDa; its catalytic subunit is termed p110γ. The regulatory subunit for this isoform has a molecular mass of 101 kDa, has no recognizable protein-protein interaction domains, and dimerizes with the p110γ catalytic moiety (2Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 9Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K.

The p110γ form of the enzyme is highly expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin and is markedly activated by interaction with the Gβγ dimer released after activation of receptors (9Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T.

Thus, ligands working through G protein-coupled receptors regulate the p110γ form of PtdIns 3-kinase and, hence, affect cell survival, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, cell shape changes, and cell migration, which are of central importance to the biology of hematopoietic cells (13Srinivasan S.

Based on experiments performed with mice in which the p110γ isoform of PtdIns 3-kinase has been genetically ablated, this effector has multiple roles in the function of platelets, neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, and monocytes (17Hirsch E. Katanaev V.L. Garlanda C. Azzolino O. Pirola L. Silengo L. Sozzani S. Mantovani A. Altruda F. Wymann M.P. Science. 2000; 287: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 18Sasaki T.

For example, neutrophils from p110γ –/–mice show no increase in PIP3 levels upon stimulation of the fMet-Leu-Phe receptor, no activation of protein kinase B, and clear defects in the respiratory burst, cell shape changes, and migration (17Hirsch E. Katanaev V.L. Garlanda C. Azzolino O. Pirola L. Silengo L. Sozzani S. Mantovani A. Altruda F. Wymann M.P. Science. 2000; 287: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 18Sasaki T.

The G protein-signaling pathway is surprisingly complex with large families of molecules comprising the receptors, G proteins, and effectors (20Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 21Cabrera-Vera T.M. Vanhauwe J. Thomas T.O. Medkova M. Preininger A. Mazzoni M.R. Hamm H.E. Endocr.

Most cell types express multiple isoforms of each category, raising questions regarding the signaling specificity inherent in the multiple isoforms of these proteins (20Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 21Cabrera-Vera T.M. Vanhauwe J. Thomas T.O. Medkova M. Preininger A. Mazzoni M.R. Hamm H.E. Endocr.

The isoforms of the G protein α and βγ subunits contribute extensively to the specificity of this signaling system. Receptors couple selectively to certain α subunits, and most effectors interact selectively with the different isoforms of the α and βγ subunits (20Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Thus, an important issue in cell signaling is identification of the protein-protein interactions underlying responses to G protein-coupled receptors. Given the primary role of the G protein βγ subunit in the activation of the p101/p110γ form of PtdIns 3-kinase (9Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S.

Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), we investigated the ability of a complete spectrum of G protein α subunits and βγ dimers to activate the p110γ isoform of PtdIns 3-kinase. Using pure, recombinant proteins reconstituted into synthetic lipid vesicles, we find that the p110γ isoform responds selectively to the different βγ dimers and does not respond to activated α subunits. Moreover, the specific form of the γ subunit in the βγ dimer and the prenyl group on its C terminus play major roles in the activation of PtdIns 3-kinase.

The cDNA for the p101 subunit was used to prepare a p101 baculovirus with a FLAG epitope on the N terminus using complimentary synthetic oligonucleotides to create the FLAG sequence. The new cDNA was subcloned into the XhoI and EcoRI sites in the Sf9 transfer vector pAcSG2, sequenced, and the recombinant virus was prepared via our standard techniques (26Graber S.G.

Cell culture, viral amplification, and baculovirus infections for protein production were performed in the presence of 1.0% antibiotic/antimycotic (10,000 units/ml penicillin G, 10,000 mg/ml streptomycin, and 25 mg/ml amphotericin B). Sf9 insect cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 3 with recombinant baculoviruses expressing G protein α and/or βγ subunits or with viruses for the p101 and the p110γ subunits of PtdIns 3-kinase prepared as described above. The incubations were allowed to proceed for ∼60–80 h or until cell viability fell to 80%, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 100 × g. For the purification of G protein α and βγ subunits, the cell pellet was washed three times in insect cell phosphate-buffered saline (7.3 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.2, 58 mm KCl, 47 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm CaCl2) and resuspended in an ice-cold buffer composed of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol supplemented with a mixture of freshly prepared protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (at 2 mg/ml), benzamidine at 20 mg/ml, and Pefabloc SC Plus at 100 mg/ml) and frozen. Cell pellets were stored in this buffer at –80 °C before G protein purification (see below). Pellets that were to be used for purification of PtdIns 3-kinase were processed immediately as freezing and thawing cell pellets released proteases active on the p101 subunit (see below). Purification of G Protein βγ Subunits—The βγ dimers were purified using a Gi1α affinity chromatography procedure that uses a His6-tagged α subunit to select properly modified G protein βγ subunits (37Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Sf9 insect cells were co-infected with the His6-Gi1α baculovirus along with the specific β and γ baculoviruses of interest, and the cell membranes were prepared as described and extracted with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 5 μm GDP, the above protease inhibitors, and 0.1% Genapol (31McIntire W.E.

A subsequent wash with base Ni2+-NTA buffer containing 0.1% Chaps was performed before elution of the βγ dimers with Ni2+-NTA base buffer containing 50 mm MgCl2,10mm NaF, and 30 μm AlCl3. Protein was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 30 concentrator and exchanged twice using Ni2+-NTA base buffer containing 0.1% Chaps.

Moreover, the γ subunits engineered to have altered CAAX sequences (e.g. γ2-L71S) were shown to have the expected change in the prenyl group at the C terminus of the γ subunit (i.e. farnesyl on γ2-L71S) (34Myung C.S.

Purification of G Protein α Subunits—The method for purification of G protein α subunits is based on the affinity procedure used for the βγ purification. The procedures used for purification of the α subunits of Gi, Gq, Gs, and Go were very similar; our methods for purification of Gs and Gq have been described in detail (29Lindorfer M.A. Myung C.S.

Sf9 cell membranes containing the Gαβ1HF·γ2HF were prepared, the heterotrimer was extracted from the membranes with 0.2% Genapol, the extracts were applied to a Ni2+-NTA column and washed, and the α subunits were purified by elution from the column with a buffer containing 50 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, and 30 μm AlCl3.

The purified α subunits were concentrated to a volume of 100–200 μl, separated into aliquots, and stored at –80 °C. Each preparation of G protein α subunit used in this study was functional based on its ability to couple to recombinant receptors and βγ subunits when reconstituted into Sf9 cell membranes (29Lindorfer M.A. Myung C.S.

Purification of Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase—After infection with the recombinant baculoviruses for p101 and p110γ as described above, Sf9 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 100 × g. The cell pellet was not frozen; rather, it was washed three times in insect cell phosphate-buffered saline, then lysed by nitrogen cavitation at 0 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, and the standard mixture of protease inhibitors. The extract was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris, then immediately centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min, and 100 ml of supernatant was loaded onto a 1.75-ml Ni2+-NTA column. The Ni2+-NTA column was washed with 17.5 ml (10 bed volumes) of a wash buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl with the above protease inhibitors and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. To remove the Triton from the column it was washed with 17.5 ml of the wash buffer in which the Triton was replaced with 280 mm NaCl. Finally, the column was washed with 17.5 ml of the wash buffer containing 10 mm imidazole. PtdIns 3-kinase was eluted from the column with 10 ml of wash buffer containing 70 mm imidazole, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 1.0% (w/v) betaine. The protein eluted from the Ni2+-NTA column was immediately loaded onto a 3-ml anti-FLAG-agarose affinity gel column, and the column was washed with 30 ml (10 bed volumes) of 25 mm"
https://openalex.org/W1994943196,"The γ-secretase complex catalyzes the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein in its transmembrane domain resulting in the formation of the amyloid β-peptide and the cytoplasmic APP intracellular domain. The active γ-secretase complex is composed of at least four subunits: presenilin (PS), nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, where the presence of all components is critically required for γ-cleavage to occur. The PS proteins are themselves subjected to endoproteolytic cleavage resulting in the generation of an N-terminal and a C-terminal fragment that remain stably associated as a heterodimer. Here we investigated the effects of modifications on the C terminus of PS1 on PS1 endoproteolysis, γ-secretase complex assembly, and activity in cells devoid of endogenous PS. We report that certain mutations and, in particular, deletions of the PS1 C terminus decrease γ-secretase activity, PS1 endoproteolysis, and γ-secretase complex formation. We demonstrate that the N- and C-terminal PS1 fragments can associate with each other in mutants having C-terminal truncations that cause loss of interaction with nicastrin and Aph-1. In addition, we show that the C-terminal fragment of PS1 alone can mediate interaction with nicastrin and Aph-1 in PS null cells expressing only the C-terminal fragment of PS1. Taken together, these data suggest that the PS1 N- and C-terminal fragment intermolecular interactions are independent of an association with nicastrin and Aph-1, and that nicastrin and Aph-1 interact with the C-terminal part of PS1 in the absence of an association with full-length PS1 or the N-terminal fragment. The γ-secretase complex catalyzes the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein in its transmembrane domain resulting in the formation of the amyloid β-peptide and the cytoplasmic APP intracellular domain.

Sequential proteolytic processing of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase and γ-secretase generates the Aβ peptide (2Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 296: 2156-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase cleavage occurs within the lipid membrane bilayer, an event referred to as regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP), i.e. the enzyme cleaves the peptide bond within the transmembrane domain of its substrate (3Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). An increasing number of type I membrane proteins have been shown to undergo γ-secretase-dependent RIP, among these are Notch, CD44, ErbB-4, and E-cadherin (reviewed in Ref. 4De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). The sequential processing of these proteins on the luminal side of the membrane and within the transmembrane domain results in the release of an intracellular signaling portion of the protein. Thus, concurrent with γ-secretase-mediated Aβ generation, a cytosolic fragment, the APP intracellular domain (AICD) is formed. AICD associates with the cytosolic adaptor protein Fe65, translocates to the nucleus, binds to the histone acetyltransferase Tip60, and functions as a regulator of transcription (5Cao X. Südhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). The N terminus of AICD is located 7–9 residues C-terminal to the site predicted by the γ-secretase cleavages generating Aβ40 and Aβ42 (6Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G.

The full-length PS proteins are endoproteolytically cleaved in hydrophobic domain 7 by an unidentified “presenilinase,” which converts the holoprotein into N- and C-terminal fragments (NTF and CTF) that remain associated as heterodimers (17Thinakaran G.

The role of the other components in the γ-secretase complex is less well understood, but a picture is emerging that the formation of the complex and the stabilization of the individual components is a coordinated and complex process (reviewed in Ref. 4De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar).Here we investigated the importance of the C-terminal domain of PS1 for γ-secretase complex activity and endoproteolysis. Previous work presented by Tomita et al. (23Tomita T. Takikawa R. Koyama A. Morohashi Y. Takasugi N. Saido T.C. Maruyama K. Iwatsubo T. J.

We used a recently devised luciferase-based AICD generation system (25Karlström H. Bergman A. Lendahl U. Näslund J. Lundkvist J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6763-6766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) to assay γ-secretase activity in PS-deficient cells after transfection of PS1 with modified C termini. In parallel, we used co-immunoprecipitations to monitor interaction of modified PS1 molecules with other γ-secretase components. We report that deletions of the PS1 C terminus affect PS1 endoproteolysis, γ-secretase complex assembly, and activity when expressed in PS-deficient cells. The deletions also affected Pen-2 stability and nicastrin maturation. Most interestingly, when wild-type NTF is co-expressed with C-terminally truncated CTF, the NTF and CTF forms heterodimers, although the interaction with nicastrin and Aph-1 is severely reduced. In addition, we show that CTF alone interacts with immature nicastrin and Aph-1 in cells that express CTF on a PS null background.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs—cDNAs encoding PS1 and PS1 CTF in the pcDNA3 and pcDNA3.1 vectors were used to generate point and deletion mutations with PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis according to the QuickChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). PS1 constructs used for generating stable cell lines were cloned into the pGwCAGiRESpuro vector by using regular cloning procedures with EcoRI (New England Biolabs) restriction enzyme digestion. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Additional DNA constructs used were PS1 NTF in the pcDNA3 vector, cytomegalovirus-βgal encoding β-galactosidase, MH100 encoding luciferase, and C99-GVP encoding the fusion protein of β-cleaved APP with a Gal4 DNA-binding and a transactivating VP16 domain introduced after the transmembrane domain of APP, between the triple lysine anchor and the cytoplasmic tail. The three latter constructs have been described elsewhere (25Karlström H. Bergman A. Lendahl U. Näslund J. Lundkvist J. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 4014-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Cell Culturing—Blastocyst-derived embryonic stem cells deficient in PS1 and PS2, BD8 cells, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2.4 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and nonessential amino acids (27Donoviel D.B.

BD8 cells stably expressing PS1, C-terminally truncated PS1, PS1 NTF, or PS1 CTF were cultured as BD8 cells with additional puromycin (1 μg/ml).Transfection Experiments and Luciferase Reporter Assay—Stably transfected BD8 cells were generated from BD8 cells transfected with PS1, PS1–450stop, PS1–460stop, PS1 NTF, or PS1 CTF by selection with puromycin (1 μg/ml). Single clones were analyzed with Western blot for PS1 expression and expanded.Transient transfections were performed in 6-well tissue culture plates for co-immunoprecipitations and in 24-well tissue culture plates for luciferase reporter assay experiments measuring AICD generation. Briefly, BD8 cells were plated at a suitable density the day before transfection. The cells were transfected according to the LipofectAMINE PLUS method (Invitrogen). For each well of a 6-well tissue culture dish, 1 μg of the indicated PS1 DNA construct was included in the transfection mixture. In transfection experiments using NTF + CTF, 500 ng of each construct were used per well. The cells were analyzed 48 h after transfection with co-immunoprecipitation.For the luciferase-based reporter assay (25Karlström H. Bergman A. Lendahl U. Näslund J. Lundkvist J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6763-6766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), cells were transfected with 100 ng of MH100, 50 ng of cytomegalovirus-βgal, and 100 ng of C99-GVP per well. Vectors encoding holo-PS1 (100 ng) or PS1 fragments (100 + 100 ng) were included in the mix. Empty pcDNA3.1 vector (100 ng) was added to adjust for differences in DNA amounts. Within each luciferase reporter experiment triplicates were performed, i.e. three wells were transfected with each of the DNA constructs analyzed. Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection in 100 μl of lysis buffer per well (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.65% Nonidet P-40), and luciferase activity was monitored luminometrically after addition of luciferin and ATP (BioThema). The β-galactosidase activities of the cell lysates were determined by measuring absorbance at 405 nm in β-galactosidase buffer (10 mm KCl, 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 8 mmO-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside), to equalize for differences in transfection efficiencies. In addition, the cell lysates were analyzed for PS1 expression by Western blot.Antibodies—The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments: UD-1, raised against the N-terminal residues ERVSNEEKLNL of Pen-2 (28Bergman A. Hansson E.M. Pursglove S.E. Farmery M.R. Lannfelt L. Lendahl U. Lundkvist J. Näslund J. J. Biol.

Sam Gandy and Paul Matthews, respectively.Immunoprecipitation—Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out 48 h post-transfection or from stably transfected BD8 cells. Cells grown in 6-well tissue culture dishes were lysed in 0.5 ml of co-immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 1% CHAPSO) per well and briefly sonicated. The samples were kept on ice, and all incubations were performed at 4 °C. Lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation (100 000 × g, 20 min). The CHAPSO-soluble supernatant was pre-cleared with protein A- and G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and subsequently incubated with primary antibody (dilution 1:500) overnight with end-over-end rotation. The following day, a mixture of protein A- and G-Sepharose was added to the samples, and the incubation was continued for 1 h. Monoclonal α-His antibody or preimmune sera were used as negative controls. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in co-immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.5% CHAPSO and once in phosphate-buffered saline. Laemmli sample buffer was subsequently added to the Sepharose and incubated at room temperature for 30 min prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.Proteasomal Inhibition—BD8 cells stably expressing PS1–450stop, PS1–460stop, or PS1 wild-type were treated with 2 μm of the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 (Calbiochem) or Me2SO. After an 8-h incubation period, cells were harvested, and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot.Western Blot and SDS-PAGE—Samples were loaded on 10–20% Tris-Tricine gels (Invitrogen) and resolved using electrophoresis with upper (0.1 m Tris, 0.1 m Tricine, and 1% SDS) and lower (0.2 m Tris) buffer systems. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and incubated with the indicated antibodies. The proteins were visualized with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence (Pierce) and exposure on Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). For Western blots shown in Figs. 4B and 5, protein concentration of the cell lysates was determined using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and an equal amount of protein was loaded.Fig. 5C-terminal truncations affect stabilization and maturation of γ-secretase complex components Pen-2 and nicastrin in stably transfected BD8 cells. Cell lysates from untransfected (untfx) BD8 cells and BD8 cells stably expressing PS1–450stop, PS1–460stop, and PS1 wild-type (wt) were prepared and evaluated with respect to the γ-secretase complex components Pen-2 and nicastrin. A, stabilization of Pen-2 was ascertained in the lysates from wild-type and truncated PS1-expressing cells by immunoblotting. The highest level of Pen-2 was observed for wild-type PS1 cells.

We wanted to determine in closer detail how the PS1 C terminus controls these two processes. The PS1 I467R mutant has been reported previously (23Tomita T. Takikawa R. Koyama A. Morohashi Y. Takasugi N. Saido T.C. Maruyama K. Iwatsubo T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10627-10634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to be deficient in endoproteolysis and to increase the ratio of secreted Aβ42 to Aβ40. Because these data were obtained in cells containing endogenous PS, we wanted to express the I467R mutant in PS null cells (27Donoviel D.B. Hadjantonakis A.-K. Ikeda M. Zheng H. St. George-Hyslop P. Bernstein A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In addition to I467R, we generated PS1 with two other point mutations at well conserved C-terminal residues, H463A and A461F. We made use of a luciferase-based reporter system that quantifies AICD formation from a C99 molecule that contains a Gal-4 DNA-binding domain and a VP16 transactivating domain (25Karlström H. Bergman A. Lendahl U. Näslund J. Lundkvist J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6763-6766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Bergman A. Religa D. Karlstrom H. Laudon H. Winblad B. Lannfelt L. Lundkvist J. Näslund J. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 287: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In transiently transfected PS null cells neither the I467R mutant nor the H463A and A461F mutants had an appreciable effect on γ-secretase activity or endoproteolysis compared with wild-type PS1 (Fig. 1, A and B, and not shown). However, exchanging the three most C-terminal residues 465–467 (Phe-Tyr-Ile), which are uncharged, to a stretch of three constitutively charged glutamates affected both γ-secretase activity and endoproteolysis of the artificial mutant molecule (Fig. 1, A and B). On longer exposure, a faint NTF band could be detected from the triple-Glu mutant (not shown). Thus, the invasive triple-Glu mutant was more deficient in rescuing γ-secretase activity and endoproteolysis in PS null cells than the single point mutations; therefore, the integrity of the PS1 C terminus appears to be important for PS1 function.Fig. 1γ-Secretase activity and PS1 endoproteolysis in PS null cells transfected with PS1 having point mutations in the C terminus.A, luciferase activity was monitored to measure γ-secretase cleavage and AICD generation from the C99-GVP reporter molecule in PS-deficient BD8 cells. Cells were transfected with wild-type (wt) PS1 and PS1 having the following point mutations: three glutamate residues (3×Glu) in the position of the three most C-terminal residues F465E/Y466E/I467E, I467R, and H463A, respectively. The bar graph shows mean luciferase activity of triplicates in arbitrary units (a.u.) with error bars indicating standard error. ANOVA followed by Fisher's protected least significant distance post hoc test were used to analyze the results. ***, p < 0.001 versus wild-type PS1. B, cell lysates were analyzed for PS1 expression by immunoblotting for holo-PS1 and NTF (upper panel) and for CTF (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)C-terminal Deletions of PS1 and Their Effect on γ-Secretase Activity and PS1 Endoproteolysis—Prompted by the findings from the triple-Glu C-terminal mutant, we wanted to assess qualitatively the functional impact of truncations of the PS1 C-terminal domain on PS1 endoproteolysis and γ-secretase activity. An array of C-terminally truncated PS1 molecules was transiently expressed in PS null cells, and γ-secretase activity and AICD formation were quantified by using the luciferase reporter system (Fig. 2A). The PS1–465stop and PS1–466stop mutants reconstituted γ-secretase activity to levels similar to the wild-type molecule. In addition, endoproteolysis of PS1–465stop and PS1–466stop was similar to wild-type PS1 (Fig. 2B, lanes 8–10). This implies that Tyr-466 and Ile-467 are not essential for endoproteolysis and reconstitution of γ-secretase activity in PS-null cells. The luciferase response was significantly lower for the mutants ending at His-463 and Glu-464 (Fig. 2A), whereas endoproteolysis of the PS1–463stop and PS1–464stop molecules appeared normal compared with the wild-type PS1 molecule (Fig. 2B, lanes 6, 7, and 10). In contrast, the PS1–450stop, PS1–455stop, and PS1–460stop mutants all showed defects both in rescuing γ-secretase activity and endoproteolysis (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 3–5). It appears that the decline in γ-activity and endoproteolysis correlate with the size of truncation in the PS1 C-terminal.Fig. 2AICD generation and endoproteolysis from PS1 with C-terminal deletions.A, luciferase activity was measured to determine AICD generation from the C99-GVP reporter molecule in PS-deficient BD8 cells transfected with wild-type PS1 or PS1 having C-terminal deletions lacking 1 (466), 2 (465), 3 (464), 4 (463), 7 (460), 12 (455), or 17 (450) residues, respectively. B, cell lysates from the luciferase measurements were analyzed for PS1 expression by immunoblotting. Note the decreased endoproteolysis for PS1 with seven or more residue truncations (lanes 3–5). C, AICD formation from the C99-GVP reporter molecule was monitored by luciferase activity in PS-deficient BD8 cells transfected with wild-type PS1 or PS1 with 7-, 12-, and 17-residue C-terminal truncations, respectively. The transfections were performed with or without wild-type CTF. D, expression of PS1 in cell lysates from the luciferase measurements in C was visualized by immunoblotting. Note the rescue of endoproteolysis upon co-expression of CTF with the C-terminally truncated constructs (lanes 4, 6, and 8). A cross-reactive species is indicated by a filled circle. Data in A and C are presented in bar graphs showing mean luciferase activity of triplicates in arbitrary units (a.u.) with error bars indicating standard error. Statistical analysis of the results in A and C was carried out using ANOVA followed by Fisher's protected least significant distance post hoc test. ***, p < 0.001; **, p < 0.01; and *, p < 0.05 versus wild-type PS1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To ensure that the larger C-terminal truncations did not induce structural re-arrangements of the entire PS1 molecule, the PS1–450stop, PS1–455stop, and PS1–460stop truncated molecules and wild-type PS1 were co-expressed together with CTF (29Laudon H.

If the NTF portion of the molecule is correctly inserted into the membrane, the addition of a wild-type CTF would restore functionality to PS1 (29Laudon H. Mathews P.M. Karlström H. Bergman A.

Indeed, in the presence of CTF all three truncated constructs were endoproteolyzed, and γ-secretase activity was restored in PS-deficient cells (Fig. 2, C and D).Co-immunoprecipitations of γ-Secretase Complex Components in the Presence of PS1 C-terminal Deletions—The reduction in activity and endoproteolysis for the PS1–450stop, PS1–455stop, and PS1–460stop mutants could result in an impaired interaction with one or more of the other γ-secretase complex components. To address this we performed co-immunoprecipitations in 1% CHAPSO (31Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Here we describe that in C2C12 cells, BMP-2 decreases myogenin expression induced by des-(1,3) insulin-like growth factor-1 (des-(1,3)IGF-1) or ectopically expressed from a constitutive promoter, even in conditions where myogenin mRNA levels were unaffected. Addition of BMP-2 decreases myogenin protein half-life to 50%, whereas proteasome inhibitors abolish these effects. Forced expression of Id1, either by transient transfection or under the control of an inducible system, causes degradation of myogenin in the absence of BMP-2. In contrast, E47 overexpression blocks the inhibitory effect of BMP-2 on myogenin levels. Finally, expression of E47 in 293 cells stabilizes myogenin, an effect that is dependent on the heterodimerization mediated by their helix-loop-helix. Our findings indicate that induction of Id1 not only blocks transcriptional activity but also induces myogenin degradation by blocking formation of myogenin-E47 protein complexes.

Mesenchymal cells differentiate into distinct cell types, such as adipocytes, osteoblasts, or myoblasts. Differentiation has two stages; first is the commitment to a particular cell lineage, and secondly, cells start to express the proteins that characterize their final phenotype. Commitment to a specific lineage depends on mutually exclusive factors. Thus, signals that induce a particular phenotype repress others. For example, signals that induce the osteoblastic phenotype, such as BMPs (bone morphogenetic proteins), 1The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; MRF, muscle regulatory factor; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; LLnL, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; tTa, tetracycline-regulated transactivator; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HEK, human embryonic kidney; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. repress myogenic differentiation in vitro (1Yamaguchi A.

Science. 1983; 220: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The capacity of mesenchymal cells to differentiate into distinct cell types is a result of the expression and function of determination genes, which include distinct families of transcription factors known as master genes. Thus, the fate of the mesenchymal precursors depends on the expression of a specific combination of master genes: the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family for myoblasts, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) and CAAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) families for adipocytes, and core binding factor α-1 (Cbfa-1) and Osterix for osteoblasts (4Molkentin J.D.

Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2797) Google Scholar). The myogenic bHLH family, also known as muscle regulatory factors (MRFs), is formed by four members, MyoD, myogenin, Myf5, and MRF4 (4Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 7Parker M.H. Seale P. Rudnicki M.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These were identified by their ability to induce the differentiation of non-muscle cells into a muscle phenotype (8Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2479) Google Scholar, 9Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 628-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Whereas MyoD and Myf5 are involved in the initial determination state, myogenin and MRF4 participate in terminal differentiation (7Parker M.H. Seale P. Rudnicki M.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The MRFs, which belong to the superfamily of bHLH transcription factors, contain a conserved basic DNA-binding domain and a helix-loop-helix motif, which is essential for dimerization. MRFs heterodimerize with the E family of ubiquitously expressed bHLH factors (10Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B.

Biol. 1992; 12: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Assembly of the heterodimer allows correct juxtaposition of the two basic regions, which leads to binding and activation of E-boxes (CANNTG), DNA motifs in the promoters of skeletal muscle-specific genes (12Ephrussi A. Church G.M. Tonegawa S. Gilbert W. Science. 1985; 227: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 13Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Mesenchymal cells use redundant mechanisms to ensure that the muscle differentiation program is activated only at the appropriate moment. These mechanisms probably also control the timing of other mesenchymal differentiation programs with the concomitant block of muscle differentiation. The first checkpoint is the expression of the master genes for the myogenic program. Thus, myogenin is absent in proliferating myoblasts, and its expression is induced by factors that stimulate the myogenic program, such as the decrease in growth factors or presence of IGF-1 (9Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 628-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 14Wright W.E. Sassoon D.A. Lin V.K.

Physiol. 1991; 53: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of MyoD and myogenin mRNA is suppressed by incubation with BMP-2 (16Katagiri T. Akiyama S. Namiki M. Komaki M. Yamaguchi A. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The second level of control is covalent modification, mainly phosphorylation of the transcription factors. Thus, myogenin is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (17Li L. Zhou J. James G. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M.P. Olson E.N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) (18Blagden C.S. Fromm L.

Signalling. 2004; 16: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) in its DNA-binding domain, thereby inhibiting DNA binding. Similarly, overexpression of protein kinase A inhibits the transcriptional activity of MRF4 (20Hardy S. Kong Y. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5943-5956Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and myogenin (21Li L. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4478-4485Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The third level of control is through interaction with other proteins that regulate the activity of transcription factors. For example, the hypophosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) associates with MyoD and is required for the efficient transactivation of E-box-containing muscle-specific promoters (22Gu W. Schneider J.W. Condorelli G. Kaushal S. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 72: 309-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Moreover, several proteins that participate in the control of the cell cycle, such as Fos, Jun, or the adenoviral protein E1A, directly interact with MRFs and inhibit their transcriptional activity (23Bengal E. Ransone L. Scharfmann R. Dwarki V.J. Tapscott S.J. Weintraub H. Verma I.M. Cell. 1992; 68: 507-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 24Li L. Chambard J.C. Karin M. Olson E.N.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4714-4727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the helix-loop-helix transcription factors can be negatively regulated by the Id family of proteins (26Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar, 27Norton J.D. Deed R.W. Craggs G. Sablitzky F.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 410-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Id members are helix-loop-helix factors that lack the basic region that allows DNA binding. Thus, Ids heterodimerize with the E-factors and inhibit their binding to DNA. Ids sequester ubiquitous E-factors (27Norton J.D. Deed R.W. Craggs G. Sablitzky F. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 58-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and act as dominant negative regulators with respect to the tissue-specific helix-loop-helix proteins (MyoD, myogenin, etc.). Here we describe a new posttranscriptional mechanism implicated in the inhibition of the myogenic program by BMP-2, the abrupt degradation of myogenin by a mechanism that involves the proteasome. This mechanism is dependent on the induction of Id proteins by BMP-2. Materials—Human recombinant BMP-2 was obtained from the Genetics Institute, and N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (LLnL) was from Sigma. Des-(1,3)IGF-1 was from Angelika F. Schutzdeller (Tubingen, Germany). Cell culture media, fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics were obtained from Invitrogen. The other reagents were of analytical or molecular biology grade and were purchased from Sigma or Roche Applied Science. Cell Culture and Transfections—C2C12 mouse cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Confluent cells were differentiated in DMEM containing 2% horse serum in the presence or absence of 2 nm BMP-2 or 2 nm des-(1,3)IGF-1 for the times indicated. For short incubations, C2C12 cells were first depleted of growth factors for 24 h in DMEM containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. C2C12 cells were transiently transfected after addition of differentiation medium with pIRESbleo-Id1 (the murine Id1 cDNA was obtained by PCR, sequenced, and subcloned into pIRESbleo from Clontech), pcDNA3-E47 (a generous gift from Dr. Pura Muñoz-Canoves), or pcDNA3 using polyethylenimine (PEI) (Aldrich) (30Abdallah B. Hassan A. Benoist C. Goula D. Behr J.P. Demeneix B.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1947-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Stable clones of C2C12 cells were generated by transfecting 10 μg of pcDNA3-myogenin or pcDNA3 and selection using G418 (400 μg/ml) for 2–3 weeks. We used three clones that expressed distinct levels of myogenin (Fig. 2, Clones 5, 7, and 8) or the C2C12-pcDNA3 control cells. We generated an inducible clone of Id1 in C2C12 cells (C2C12-pTISN-Id1) following the Tet-Off protocol described by Chambard and Pognonec (31Chambard J.C. Pognonec P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3443-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). First, we used two distinct vectors that code for tetracycline-regulated transactivator (tTA) and puromycin resistance under the control of a tTA-responsive promoter (tetO-CMV) to generate C2C12 cells that stably expressed the tTA. After selection of clones resistant to puromycin, we transfected Id1 cloned in the pTISN vector (which expressed neomycin resistance), where Id1 was under the control of the tTA-responsive promoter. After selection, clones expressed Id1 in inverse proportion to the tetracycline concentration in the culture medium. The concentration of tetracycline was 100 ng/ml in all experiments. To reverse the effect of tetracycline, cells were incubated for 12 h in the presence of tetracycline, rinsed five times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated in normal medium in the absence of tetracycline for the times indicated. HEK-293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were transiently transfected using polyethylenimine. The expression vectors encoding full-length E47, E47 lacking the helix-loop-helix (E47ΔHLH, which codes for amino acids 1–386), or E47 containing the helix-loop-helix (E47+HLH, which codes for amino acids 387–649) were kindly provided by Dr. P. Muñoz-Canoves and tagged with Myc. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed twice in cold PBS and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100) for 15 min at 4 °C. Western blots were performed as described previously (2Viñals F. Lopez-Rovira T. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The blots were incubated with polyclonal Id1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal antimyogenin 1F8 antibody (a generous gift from Dr. Pura Muñoz-Canoves, Centre de Regulació Genòmica, Barcelona, Spain), polyclonal E47 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma), polyclonal anti-ERK2 (32McKenzie F.R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13476-13483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), or monoclonal anti-Myc (Sigma) in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Northern Blot—Total RNA from cells was extracted using the phenol/chloroform method (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar), and Northern blot with 20 μg of RNA was performed as described previously (2Viñals F. Lopez-Rovira T. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized to the mouse myogenin cDNA or rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Studies—Cells were cultured on glass coverslips for 24 h and transfected with the plasmids indicated. 48 h after transfection, cells were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After four washes with PBS, they were permeabilized with PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, rinsed four times with PBS, and blocked for 30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were incubated with mouse monoclonal 1F8 antimyogenin antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-Id1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or rabbit polyclonal anti-E47 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature, followed by Texas Red- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, cells were incubated with Hoechst 333258 (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted using Mowiol (Calbiochem), and immunofluorescence was visualized with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope. BMP-2 Induces the Degradation of Myogenin in C2C12 Cells—C2C12 cells incubated for 3 days with a limited supply of growth factors (2% horse serum) or in the presence of 2 nm des-(1,3)IGF-1 (a potent myogenic inducer) (15Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Magri K.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 34Kaliman P. Canicio J. Shepherd P.R. Beeton C.A. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) differentiated to multinucleated myotubes. These myotubes expressed typical skeletal muscle markers, such as myogenin (Fig. 1A). Treatment with BMP-2 not only blocked myotube formation (2Viñals F. Lopez-Rovira T. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 35Chalaux E. Lopez-Rovira T. Rosa J.L. Bartrons R. Ventura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 537-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and myogenin expression (Fig. 1A) but also stimulated typical osteoblastic markers, such as osteocalcin or alkaline phosphatase (2Viñals F. Lopez-Rovira T. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 36Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). Simultaneous treatment of cells with both factors abolished myogenin expression (Fig. 1A), whereas the osteoblastic markers were maintained (data not shown). Furthermore, the addition of des-(1,3)IGF-1 12 or 24 h after BMP-2 did not reverse its inhibitory effects, and levels of myogenin remained low. In contrast, addition of BMP-2 12 or 24 h after IGF-1 caused a progressive decrease in myogenin levels (Fig. 1A). Thus, the effects of BMP-2 on myogenin expression were dominant over those of des-(1,3)IGF-1. BMP-2 inhibits transcription of the myogenin gene (16Katagiri T. Akiyama S. Namiki M. Komaki M. Yamaguchi A. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To evaluate the time course of the inhibitory effect of BMP-2 on myogenin expression, we incubated C2C12 cells in the presence of BMP-2, des-(1,3)IGF-1, or both factors for 4 or 8 h. After a 4-h incubation, BMP-2 induced Id1, an inhibitor of the family of helix-loop-helix transcription factors (28Ruzinova M.B. Benezra R. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 410-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 29Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Ogata T. Wozney J.M. Benezra R. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9219-9222Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and its expression was maintained until 8 h (Fig. 1B). Des-(1,3)IGF-1 induced myogenin mRNA and protein at 4 and 8 h (Fig. 1C) but did not inhibit Id1 induction by BMP-2. Incubation in the presence of BMP-2 blocked the myogenin protein induction not only at 8 h but also at 4 h, in conditions where the myogenin mRNA induction was unaffected (Fig. 1, B and C). To identify the mechanisms involved in the effect of BMP-2 on myogenin protein levels over short times, we first evaluated a possible effect of BMP-2 on the IGF-1 signaling pathways. C2C12 cells were preincubated in the presence of BMP-2 followed by the addition of des-(1,3)IGF-1 for 30 min or 1 h. We did not detect any difference in ERK1/2 or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase stimulation by des-(1,3)IGF-1 in the presence or absence of BMP-2 (data not shown). The observation that BMP-2 blocked myogenin protein induction at 4 h, independently of transcriptional regulation, led us to hypothesize that BMP-2 affects myogenin protein stability. To test this hypothesis, we generated stable clones of C2C12 that express myogenin under the control of an independent promoter (cytomegalovirus promoter of the vector pcDNA3). We generated three independent clones (Fig. 2A, Clones 5, 7, and 8) with distinct expression levels of the myogenin mRNA and protein. Myogenin transcription from these clones did not respond to BMP-2 (Fig. 2B). In all the cases BMP-2 caused a time-dependent decrease in the levels of myogenin protein, which was already observed 4 h after the addition of BMP-2 (Fig. 2A). The rate of myogenin decrease depended on the initial levels of myogenin expressed in each clone. Thus, in those that expressed low levels, the rate of decrease was faster than in those that expressed high myogenin levels (Fig. 2A), indicating the dependence of a limiting factor that controlled myogenin degradation by BMP-2. To confirm the data obtained by Western blot experiments, we performed immunofluorescence studies with antibodies against myogenin. As described previously (38Brennan T.J. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 582-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), myogenin was immunolocalized in the nucleus of C2C12 cells (Fig. 2C). Incubation for 4 h with BMP-2 caused a significant decrease in the myogenin signal, without causing a clear effect of protein relocalization at the subcellular level. Myogenin Is Degraded by a Proteasome-dependent Mechanism—To confirm an induction of the degradation of the myogenin protein by BMP-2, we incubated cells with BMP-2 for 1 h, and after this preincubation, we added cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, and then harvested cells after a range of times. In control conditions myogenin had a short half-life of about 60 min (Fig. 3A), which is consistent with the findings of other studies (39Edmondson D.G. Brennan T.J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21343-21346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of BMP-2 increased the rate of myogenin degradation, causing the half-life to fall to 30 min, confirming that the short term effect of BMP-2 was because of an increase in myogenin degradation. The BMP-2-dependent decrease in myogenin protein levels may be explained by its degradation by a ubiquitin-proteasome system. Proteasome is one of the systems most often used by the cellular machinery to control the levels of subtly regulated proteins (40Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 41Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6902) Google Scholar). To assess this possibility, we preincubated cells in the presence of LLnL, a potent inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome (42Seemuller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Lowe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Addition of the inhibitor in the absence of BMP-2 caused a clear increase in the levels of myogenin (Fig. 3B) both in its major 36-kDa form and in a higher Mr form because of its phosphorylation (data not shown) (39Edmondson D.G. Brennan T.J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21343-21346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Zhou J. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6232-6243Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These results indicate that myogenin was degraded in basal conditions by a proteasome-dependent mechanism. More importantly, addition of LLnL before incubation with BMP-2 abolished the effect of the cytokine, and the accumulation of myogenin was at levels comparable with those obtained in the LLnL condition (Fig. 3B). Id1 Is Sufficient to Mediate the BMP-2-induced Degradation of Myogenin—One of the mediators of the antimyogenic response of BMP-2 is the induction of the Id proteins that act as dominant negative inhibitors of the tissue-specific helix-loophelix transcription factors (36Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar, 37Ogata T. Wozney J.M. Benezra R. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9219-9222Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 44Lopez-Rovira T. Chalaux E. Massague J. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3176-3185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Given these effects, one possibility was that the induction of Id by BMP-2, by sequestering E-factors, not only blocked the transcriptional activity of myogenin but also served as an intermediate for the increase in myogenin degradation. To test this, we transiently transfected clones of C2C12 that expressed ectopic myogenin with Id1, and we immunolocalized both proteins. Cells that did not express Id1 clearly expressed myogenin in the nucleus (Fig. 4A). Id1 was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm as described before (45Jen Y. Weintraub H. Benezra R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1466-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 46Iavarone A. Garg P. Lasorella A. Hsu J. Israel M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1270-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The overexpression of Id1 in the absence of BMP-2 always caused a decrease in the levels of myogenin. To further confirm these effects in a more controlled system, we used the Tet-Off system to generate an inducible Id1 expression system in C2C12 cells. Id1 expression in these cells was an inverse function of the tetracycline in the medium. Thus, in the presence of 100 ng/ml tetracycline in the medium for 12 h Id1 expression was abolished (Fig. 4B). After removal of tetracycline, expression levels increased with time but did not exceed the physiological levels obtained after 4 h of stimulation with BMP-2 (Fig. 4B). In these conditions of Id1 expression and in the absence of other effects caused by the presence of BMP-2, the myogenin protein decreased in an inverse function of Id1. These results confirmed that Id1 was sufficient to cause the drop in the levels of myogenin working as a mediator for the effects of BMP-2. E47 Protects Myogenin from Degradation Induced by BMP-2—The E family of transcription factors is essential for the transcriptional activity of the MRFs on the specific E-boxes of the muscle-specific gene promoters (12Ephrussi A. Church G.M. Tonegawa S. Gilbert W. Science. 1985; 227: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 13Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). If Id1 promotes degradation of myogenin by releasing this factor from the heterodimer with the E-members, overexpression of an E-member should prevent the effect of BMP-2. To evaluate this, we transfected E47 expression constructs in C2C12 cells expressing ectopic myogenin. Incubation for 8 h with BMP-2 caused a large decrease in the myogenin expression in these cells (Fig. 5A). In contrast, most cells that overexpressed E47 (Fig. 5A, green nuclei) maintained the expression of myogenin and were refractory to the BMP-2 effect. 5% of the control cells that expressed green fluorescent protein still maintained the myogenin expression after 8 h of incubation in the presence of BMP-2. In contrast, 90 ± 4% of cells that overexpressed E47 maintained the myogenin expression. To biochemically confirm these data, mock or E47 expression plasmids were cotransfected with a plasmid that encoded puromycin resistance. After 24 h of transfection, puromycin was added to the culture medium to select cells that had incorporated the expression plasmids. The resistant cells were incubated for 0, 4, or 8 h in the presence of 2 nm BMP-2. Overexpression of E47 blocked myogenin degradation even 8 h after the addition of BMP-2 (Fig. 5B). In contrast, myogenin was degraded by BMP-2 in the control cells that expressed pcDNA3. These results confirmed the hypothesis that Id was a mediator for the effects of BMP-2 observed through a mechanism that involved the sequestering of endogenous E-proteins. To confirm these data obtained analyzing the endogenous myogenin protein in C2C12 cells, we expressed myogenin in HEK-293 cells. Basal levels of myogenin expression in these cells were low (Fig. 6A). As it was observed in C2C12 cells, incubation with LLnL caused a strong increase in the levels of myogenin. Co-expression of E47 with myogenin caused the stabilization of the protein in the absence of LLnL, confirming the stabilizing role of heterodimerization with E-proteins. In contrast, addition of a Myc6 tag to the N terminus of myogenin blocked its high degradation rate as it was highly expressed in the absence of LLnL (Fig. 6A). Finally, to analyze the importance of myogenin-E47 heterodimer formation in myogenin stability, we made similar assays using two E47 deletion mutants (E47ΔHLH, defective in heterodimer formation (47Voronova A. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4722-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and E47+HLH, which contains the bHLH). The E47 mutant unable to heterodimerize with myogenin was also defective"
https://openalex.org/W1999149190,"We report the identification of a novel cDNA fragment that shows significantly reduced expression in cancerous tissue compared with paired non-cancerous liver tissue in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The full-length transcript of 1733 bp encodes a protein of 308 amino acids that has all the hallmark features of mitochondrial carrier proteins. We designate the novel protein as HDMCP (HCC-down-regulated mitochondrial carrier protein). The HDMCP orthologs in human, mouse, and rat are found to exhibit close similarity in protein sequence and gene organization, as well as exclusive expression in the liver. Moreover, conserved syntenic regions have been demonstrated at the HDMCP gene locus in the human, mouse, and rat genome. Taken together, we suggest that HDMCP might have a conserved and unique biological function in the liver. Overexpression of HDMCP in transiently transfected cancer cells results in the loss of staining by MitoTracker dye, indicating that HDMCP could induce the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). However, HDMCP-mediated disruption of ΔΨm is not related to mitochondrial permeability transition or apoptosis. In addition, we further demonstrate that the dissipation of ΔΨm is accompanied by significant reduction of cellular ATP in 293T cells overexpressing HDMCP or uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). Our present findings suggest that HDMCP might be one of the long postulated uncoupling proteins that catalyze the physiological “proton leak” in the liver. The down-regulation of HDMCP in HCC cancer cells might result in the elevation of ΔΨm, a common phenomenon found in cancer cells.

It has been suggested that chronic hepatitis B and C virus infection, dietary aflatoxin, alcohol consumption, and hepatic iron overload are the etiological factors for HCC development. However, the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for HCC are still not well defined. Mitochondrial defects caused by altered expression of respiratory chain subunits and glycolytic enzymes, decreased oxidation of NADH-linked substrates, as well as mitochondrial DNA mutations have been proposed to contribute to the development and progression of various cancer types including HCC (1Modica-Napolitano J.S.

It has long been recognized that the most well known function of mitochondria is the production of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. During mitochondrial respiration, the transfer of electrons along the respiratory chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane is coupled to the translocation of protons (H+) from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. This process generates a proton electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is known as the proton-motive force. This proton-motive force is used to drive the protons back into the matrix through F0F1-ATP synthase resulting in the synthesis of ATP (6Mitchell P. Moyle J. Nature. 1965; 208: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 7Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of The Cells. 3rd Ed. Garland Publishing, New York1994: 653-684Google Scholar). Alternatively, the proton-motive force can also be dissipated by “proton leak” catalyzed by multiple parameters, such as classical uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation (8Heytler P.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1980; 10: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Terada H. Environ. Health Perspect. 1990; 87: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), fatty acids (10Kohnke D. Ludwig B. Kadenbach B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) of brown adipose tissue (11Klingenberg M. Trends Biochem.

Biomembr. 1999; 31: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) arises from the net movement of positive charge across the inner mitochondrial membrane, reflecting the balance between processes that contribute to the generation of the proton gradient and those that consume it (7Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of The Cells. 3rd Ed. Garland Publishing, New York1994: 653-684Google Scholar). In the early 1980s, Chen and co-workers (13Summerhayes I.C. Lampidis T.J. Bernal S.D. Nadakavukaren J.J. Nadakavukaren K.K. Shepherd E.L. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This is in agreement with a later report showing that ΔΨm of carcinoma cells is ∼60 mm higher than that of control epithelial cells (18Modica-Napolitano J.S. Aprille J.R. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4361-4365PubMed Google Scholar). However, to date, no real understanding of the biochemical basis has been proposed for this well defined observation for cancer cells. We report here the isolation and characterization of a novel protein that might be one of the long postulated liver tissue-specific uncoupling proteins. It bears all the hallmark features of the mitochondrial carrier proteins and is significantly down-regulated during the development of HCC. We designate this novel protein as HCC-down-regulated mitochondrial carrier protein (HDMCP). Tissue Specimens—Paired samples of cancerous and non-cancerous liver tissue of a total of 52 patients undergoing hepatic resection as treatment for HCC were retrieved from the National Cancer Centre Tissue Repository. Resected tissue was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were collected with written informed consent from the patients. Among the 52 pairs of HCC samples, 18 were randomly selected for spotted array analysis, 7 for real time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis, and 27 for Affymetrix analysis. Cell Culture—HepG2, Hep3B, WRL68, SNU-182, SNU-398, SNU-449, and SKHep1 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. HuH7, HLE, PLC/PRF/5 and HuH6, clone 5 (HuH6-C5), were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank. CNE-2 (a nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line) has been described earlier (19Ng A. Tang J.P. Goh C.H.K. Hui K.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were obtained from Dr. Paula Lam (National Cancer Centre, Singapore). All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/100 μg/ml), 2 mm l-glutamate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Subtracted cDNA Library Construction and Screening by Microarrays—Two reciprocal subtracted cDNA libraries were generated between cancerous and non-cancerous liver tissue from an HCC patient using a cDNA synthesis and plasmid cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the recommended protocol with some modifications. Briefly, tracer cDNA was hybridized twice with biotinylated driver mRNA prepared by Photoprobe Biotin Labeling/Detection kit (Vector Laboratories). The removal of biotinylated RNA and DNA hybrid was carried out by extraction twice with VECTREX Avidin D (Vector Laboratories). Second strand DNA of the subtracted cDNA was then generated by random priming, ligated to pSPORT1, and transformed into Epicurian Coli XL-2-blue ultracompetent cells (Stratagene). A total of 789 cDNA clones, including clone C78, the gene focus in the present study, were derived from these two libraries. These clones were PCR-amplified, purified, and spotted in duplicate onto glass slides using the GMS 417 microarrayer (Genetic Microsystems). 10 μg of total RNA were labeled and hybridized to the arrays by using the two-step 3DNA™ expression array detection kit (Genisphere Inc). RNA from a normal liver sample is served as a reference in each hybridization. The arrays were scanned using the GMS 418 array scanner (Genetic Microsystems) and analyzed using ImaGene 4.0 software (Biodiscovery, Los Angeles). Signal intensities of Cy5 (test samples) and Cy3 (reference) were normalized by applying a scale factor to all intensities measured for the Cy5 channel to generate a Cy5/Cy3 intensity ratio of 1 in the majority of the spot elements. The calibrated Cy5/Cy3 ratios represented relative gene expression. RNA Isolation, Real Time RT-PCR, and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized with random hexamers (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)12–17 primers (Invitrogen) using Super-Script II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantification of C78 and 18 S rRNA expression was performed on a RotorGene real time PCR machine (Cobett Research, Australia) using QuantiTech™ SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). The primer sequences were as follows: C78-RT-F and C78-R (Fig. 3) for C78 and 5′-CCTGCGGCTTAATTTGACTC-3′ and 5′-CGCTGAGCCAGTCAGTGTAG-3′ for 18 S rRNA. All PCRs were performed in duplicate. Standard curves of C78 and 18 S rRNA were generated independently by 10× serial dilution of template DNA. The relative copy number of each sample was calculated according to the corresponding standard curve using RotorGene version 4.6 software. Normalization was performed in each sample by dividing the copy number of C78 to that of 18 S rRNA. The relative expression levels were calculated by arbitrarily designating the lowest normalized value to 1. A human multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech) was hybridized with probes prepared by purified C78 and β-actin PCR product and labeled using Strip EZ™ DNA kit (Ambion) in Ultrahyb (Ambion). Autoradiography was conducted on Kodak BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak) at -80 °C. Affymetrix GeneChips Analysis—5 μg of total RNA was used to generate biotinylated cRNA, followed by hybridizing to Affymetrix HGU133A and -B GeneChips according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After scanning, the average intensity for the genes in total was normalized to 100. Probe ID representing HDMCP was selected. Cloning of a Full-length HDMCP cDNA and DNA Sequencing—C78 sequence was searched against the EST data base by the BLAST program and was found to be highly homologous to EST clone (AA677293). The EST sequence was found to be located at position 137,866 to 138,343 in BAC clone R-638I2 (AL157871) using the BLAST program. The GENSCAN web server at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html) was employed to predict putative genes in an ∼13 kb of DNA sequence encompassing the EST sequence from BAC clone R-638I2. A putative gene was predicted to encode a protein of 323 amino acids (aa). cDNA was generated from total RNA derived from a normal liver sample by random priming by using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), as well as ThermoScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR product generated by C78-F and C78-R primers (Fig. 3), designed according to GENSCAN-predicted exons, was confirmed by sequencing. In order to get the full-length sequence of C78, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) was performed using the FirstChoice ™ RLM-RACE kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was first amplified with a 5′-RACE outer primer (provided in the kit) and C78RC-OR primer (Fig. 3), followed by a second PCR using a nested 5′-RACE inner primer (provided) and C78RC-IR primer (Fig. 3). The transcription initiation site was mapped by sequencing the PCR products that were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI Prism 377XL automated DNA sequencer using ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystem). In Silico Cloning of HDMCP Orthologous Gene in Mouse and Rat, as Well as Determining Gene Organization and Conserved Syntenic Regions—HomoloGene data base from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) shows possible homologous genes of HDMCP in the mouse and rat species. First, the cDNA and protein sequences of HDMCP orthologous genes derived from AY569438 (human), BC055027 (mouse), and XM_234551 (rat) were analyzed by multiple sequence alignment using ClustalW version 1.8 available at GenomeNet service at Kyoto University Bioinformatics Center (clustalw.genome.ad.jp/). Based on the conserved protein sequences in HDMCP orthologs, and later confirmed by PCR and autosequencing, we concluded that the first 9 aa of protein sequence encoded by exon 1 in the rat ortholog was replaced by a stretch of unrelated 17 aa in XM_234551 (AY603424). Second, the cDNA sequence of the mouse ortholog was used as a template to align an ∼7-kb rat genomic DNA sequence encompassing the sequence of XM_234551, to assist in determining exon 1 with a start codon, and assembling the 5′and 3′-untranslated regions (UTR). Furthermore, gene organization of each ortholog was determined by BLAST 2 sequence algorithm using cDNA sequences and their corresponding genomic DNA sequences, together with the consensus rule for splice sites, which are dinucleotides GT and AG next to the 5′ and 3′ intron boundaries. In order to determine the syntenic regions at the HDMCP gene locus in human, mouse, and rat genomes, the map location of human, mouse, and rat HDMCP orthologs was first identified. The gene content of the genomic region flanking the HDMCP gene was determined by using Map Viewer from the NCBI in human and corresponding mouse and rat chromosomes. The regions of synteny between human, mouse, and rat chromosome were then determined by analyzing and comparing each gene using HomoloGene data base from the NCBI. Construction of HDMCP-FLAG and Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2)-FLAG Protein—HDMCP was first amplified from normal liver RNA with specific primers HDMCP-F and HDMCP-R (Fig. 3). The PCR product then served as a template to generate the HDMCP-FLAG protein using two additional steps of PCR. HDMCP-F was the forward primer for both PCRs. A FLAG peptide tag (KDDDDKYD) at the C terminus of the fusion protein was first generated by the reverse primer containing the 3′-end of the HDMCP coding sequence and part of the FLAG sequence (5′-GTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCTGTGAGCAGACCCCGGGC-3′; the FLAG sequence is underlined). The second PCR was then performed using the reverse primer containing a stop codon and part of the FLAG sequence that overlapped with the reverse primer from the first PCR (C-FLAG, 5′-GCCCTACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTT-3′; the stop codon is italic, and the FLAG sequence is underlined). The UCP2-FLAG protein was generated by a similar approach from cDNA of human skeletal muscle. Forward primer UCP2-F (5′-ATCATGGTTGGGTTCAAGGCCACAGAT-3′) was used together with first PCR reverse primer (5′-GTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCGAAGGGAGCCTCTCGGGA-3′; the FLAG sequence is underlined) and second PCR reverse primer (C-FLAG, same as above). Platinum Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) was used for all amplifications. The first five cycles of amplification were programmed as 94 °C for 3 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The remaining 25 cycles were programmed as 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. A single deoxyadenosine (dA) was added to the 3′-end of the final PCR products by Taq polymerase (Promega) and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Positive clones were confirmed by sequencing. Subcloning into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was performed by restriction enzyme digestion and standard ligation protocols. The gene orientation was verified by restriction enzyme digestion. Transfection, Immunostaining, and ΔΨm Detection—Cells grown on coverslips in a 6-well tissue culture plate were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3/HDMCP-FLAG plasmid using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For time course analysis of HDMCP expression, cells were stained at 4, 6, and 24 h after transfection. For ΔΨm restoration studies in HDMCP-overexpressed cells, fresh media containing test compound (either 5 μm cyclosporin A, 50 μm bongkrekic acid, or 5 μg/ml oligomycin (Sigma)) were added after the cells were transfected for 2 h and incubated for another 22 h. To determine the ΔΨm, cells were incubated in media containing 250 nm MitoTracker Orange™ (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in culture media at 37 °C for 10 min and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 5 min. After washing with PBS, nonspecific staining was blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were then incubated overnight with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Stratagene) at 4 °C. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h in Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Ab) (Molecular Probes), coverslips were washed in PBS and mounted onto slides with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole containing VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories). Slides were examined using the LSM-510 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). In addition, cells were incubated with anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (pAb) (Sigma) and anti-mitochondrial mAb (Neomarker) or anti-cytochrome c mAb (Promega) 24 h posttransfection. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ab and Alexa Fluor 546or Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ab were used for primary Ab detection. TUNEL Assay—In situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) was used to detect apoptotic cells at day 3 after transfection in Hep3B cells. Briefly, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, rinsed with PBS, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min on ice. Cells were then treated with TUNEL reaction mixture in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 1 h in the dark, followed by rinsing three times with PBS. To visualize HDMCP protein, cells were incubated with anti-FLAG mAb followed by incubation of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ab. Measurement of ATP and ADP/ATP Ratio—293T cells in 6-well plates were transfected with pcDNA3/HDMCP-FLAG, pcDNA3/UCP2-FLAG, or pcDNA3 vector alone, using LipofectAMINE with PLUS reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell pellets were collected 24 h after transfection and resuspended in Nucleotide Releasing Buffer (NRB). The ATP and ADP were assayed by a luminometric method using ApoSENSOR™ ADP/ATP ratio assay kit (Biovision). To measure the ATP level, 1 μl of ATP-monitoring enzyme diluted in 50 μl of NRB was added to 100 μl of cell lysate and read immediately with a 10-s integration on a LumatLB 9507 (Berthold technologies) (data A). To measure the ADP level, the sample was read again after 10–15 min (data B). 1 μl of ADP-converting enzyme diluted in 50 μl of NRB was then added and read immediately (data C). The ADP level was calculated as data C - data B. The background-subtracted luminescence values (relative light units) were normalized for total protein in each sample. In order to compare the results of eight independent transfections, the relative light units/μg of protein of vector control was set as 100% to compare the changes of ATP, ADP, and ADP/ATP ratio in HDMCPand UCP2-overexpressed cells. Statistical Analysis—The statistical differences between groups were analyzed by using Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test for paired samples. Twotailed p values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Identification of a Significantly Down-regulated cDNA Fragment in Cancerous Liver Tissue Compared with Paired Noncancerous Liver Tissue from HCC Patients—We employed spotted microarrays to screen a total of 789 cDNA clones derived from two reciprocal subtracted cDNA libraries generated from cancerous and paired non-cancerous liver tissue from an HCC patient. Among the differentially expressed cDNA clones, C78 was found to be the most significantly and consistently downregulated novel cDNA fragment in the cancerous tissue compared with paired non-cancerous liver tissue in a total of 18 pairs of HCC samples. Fig. 1A shows the significant downregulation of C78 in cancerous tissue of 18 pairs of HCC samples using spotted microarrays for differential cDNA library screening. Real time RT-PCR using seven independent pairs of HCC samples demonstrated 3–460-fold reduction of C78 gene expression in the cancerous tissue. This represents relative expression levels ranging from 115 to 725 copies in non-cancerous tissue compared with 1–40 copies observed in cancerous tissue (Fig. 1B). These results were further confirmed when 27 independent pairs of HCC samples were studied using Affymetrix GeneChips showing the median expression level in cancerous tissue was significantly lower than that in non-cancerous liver tissue (101 versus 1800 intensity unit; p = 0.001, Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test) (Fig. 1C). We investigated the endogenous expression of HDMCP in HCC cell lines compared with a normal liver sample using real time RT-PCR. C78 was shown to be significantly down-regulated in the HCC cell lines compared with that of the normal liver sample. After normalization to 18 S rRNA for an equal amount of template loading, the relative expression levels were shown as follows: normal liver (∼50,000 copies); Hep3B, HuH6-C5, and HepG2 (∼230–265 copies); SNU-499 (∼160 copies); HuH7 and WRL68 (∼25–40 copies); PLC/PRF/5, HLE, SNU398, SKHep1, and SNU186 (∼1–10 copies). Northern Blot Analysis Revealed the Exclusive Expression of C78 in Liver Tissue—C78 cDNA fragment probe was employed to poly (A)+ RNA isolated from 12 different human tissue types in order to determine the tissue distribution of C78. Fig. 2 shows that the C78 mRNA transcript of ∼1.8 kb could be detected predominantly in the liver. No signal could be detected in the other tissues examined. Cloning of Full-length C78 and the Detection of an Alternatively Spliced C78 Transcript—The initially isolated C78 cDNA fragment contains 197 nucleotides (nt) plus a poly(A) tail. We first extended the sequence of C78 to 477 nt by identifying a highly homologous EST clone, IMAGE clone 454792 (AA677293). By using the GENSCAN program, a putative gene could be predicted within the stretch of an ∼13-kb DNA sequence encompassing the 477-nt DNA sequence from the BAC clone R-638I2 (AL157871). As predicted, a 1.5-kb DNA fragment was generated by RT-PCR by using primers designed from the GENSCAN-predicted gene. 5′-RACE using cDNA generated by both SuperScript II and ThermoScript reverse transcriptase amplified a consistent product of ∼350 bp. However, the latter template generated an additional band of ∼420 bp (data not shown). According to the sequences of both DNA fragments, they shared identical transcription initiation sites, and their 3′-end sequence overlapped with the 1.5-kb fragment mentioned above. After comparing to the human genomic DNA sequence, the shorter fragment was subsequently found to comprise exons 1–4, whereas the longer fragment was found to splice at a different 3′-splice acceptor in intron 2 which therefore generated an additional stretch of 61 nt between exons 2 and 3 (Fig. 3). We concluded that besides obtaining the full-length C78 cDNA of 1733 bp (AY569438), we had also identified an alternatively spliced transcript (AY570298). The predicted full-length product is consistent with the 1.8-kb transcript identified in the liver mRNA (Fig. 2). Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the full-length C78 cDNA comprised an open reading frame for a polypeptide of 308 aa and the 5′and 3′-UTR of 73 and 733 nt in length, respectively (Fig. 3). The alternative splice form, however, was found to encode a peptide of only 30 aa in length due to a premature termination codon present within the additional 61-nt stretch (AY570298). Several cDNA sequences in UniGene Cluster Hs.108268 (chromosome 14 open reading frame 68, C14orf68) were found to have a coding region identical to the C78 cDNA sequence but with minor variations of DNA sequences at the UTR. The C78 cDNA identified in the present study (AY569438) has longer 5′and 3′-UTR in comparison to the reported cDNA sequence (BX248260). The other two cDNA sequences (XM208731 and AK092001) both have a stretch of 97 nt missing at the 3′-UTR. C78 Is a Mitochondrial Carrier Protein and Is Tentatively Designated as HDMCP—Sequence analysis reveals that the 308-aa polypeptide encoded by the full-length C78 clone is highly similar to mitochondrial carrier proteins. Fig. 4 shows the comparative alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of C78 and three human mitochondrial carrier proteins including C14orf69 (Q8N8R3), mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier protein (CAC) (O43772), and mitochondrial glutamate carrier 1 (GHC1) (Q9H936). Like the other mitochondrial carrier proteins, C78 comprises three highly conserved homologous tandem repeats of ∼100 aa each with the typical mitochondrial carrier signature GX3GX8PX(D/E)X(I/L/V)(K/R)X(R/K)XQX20–30GX4(Y/W)(R/K)GX9P (20Kobayashi K.

Each repeated element is made of two anti-parallel transmembrane hydrophobic α-helices (Fig. 4, open boxes) linked by an extensive hydrophilic region (Fig. 4, solid line). The three tandem repeats are linked by short extramembranous hydrophilic loops (Fig. 4, dashed line). Thus a total of six hydrophobic segments (Fig. 4, denoted as TM1 to TM6) are capable of being folded into membrane-spanning α-helices with the three long hydrophilic segments connecting the two α-helices in each repeat protruding into the mitochondrial matrix (21Palmieri F.

ATP synthase is the enzyme responsible for ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation or photophosphorylation in membranes of bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. In its simplest form, exemplified by the Escherichia coli enzyme studied here, it contains eight different subunit types. Three catalytic sites, located at the interfaces of α and β subunits in the membrane-extrinsic α3β3 hexagon, operate in concert to synthesize ATP. Reactions at the catalytic sites are controlled by rotation of the γ subunit within the α3β3 hexagon. The γ subunit is part of the “rotor,” composed of γ, ϵ, and a ring of c subunits. Passage of protons down the transmembrane proton gradient, through the membrane-buried interface between the cring and the a subunit, energizes the rotor. A “stator” immobilizes the catalytic sites during rotation. Consisting of the b2δ subunits, the stator is attached to a subunit in the membrane and to the α3β3 hexagon. Experimentally, the enzyme can be resolved readily into water-soluble F1 and water-insoluble F0 sectors, which correspond to the membrane-extrinsic α3β3γδϵ and membrane-located ab2cring subcomplexes, respectively. F1 retains catalytic ATPase activity (a physiological activity in E. coli) and is used extensively for studies of the catalytic sites.

Further, we have proposed that proton gradient-mediated Pi binding is an important factor in the ability of the enzyme to bind ADP during ATP synthesis in the face of an apparently prohibitive ATP/ADP cellular concentration ratio (1Weber J.

Thus studies on determinants of Pi binding in catalytic sites are likely to be valuable in understanding the catalytic mechanism. In a recent paper (7Ahmad Z. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31505-31513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we found that βArg-246 1E. coli residue numbering used throughout.1E. coli residue numbering used throughout. is one residue that is important for binding of Pi.X-ray crystallography studies by Walker, Leslie, and colleagues (8Menz R.I.

Fig. 1, A–C, shows the structures of catalytic sites containing the transition state analog MgADP-AlF4− (Fig. 1A), the late transition state/early ground state analog MgADP-AlF3 (Fig. 1B), and the posthydrolysis state with MgADP and SO42− (Fig. 1C), respectively. In Fig. 1, A and B, fluoroaluminate is believed to be in the position of the γ-phosphate, and in Fig. 1C, SO42− is thought to mimic Pi. The central location of residue βAsn-243 in the Pi-binding subdomain is evident from Fig. 1. The ND2 atom of the Asn side chain points toward the γ-P/Pi moiety, whereas the OD1 atom points toward neighboring residues that line the end of the Pi-binding pocket. Also, it may be noted that βAsn-243 lies close to βArg-246, the Pi-binding residue mentioned above. For these reasons, we decided to investigate the possible role of βAsn-243 in Pi binding.Direct measurement of Pi binding to F1 or intact ATP synthase catalytic sites is difficult due to low affinity for Pi in absence of a proton gradient (1Weber J. Senior A.E. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 2Senior A.E. Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 188-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystallography studies suggested alternative, indirect approaches, namely the use of surrogates for Pi or the γ-P of ATP such as fluoroaluminate, fluoroscandium, and fluoroberyllate, or the use of NBD-Cl, 2The abbreviations used are: NBD-Cl, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; DTT, dithiothreitol.2The abbreviations used are: NBD-Cl, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; DTT, dithiothreitol. which reacts specifically with residue βTyr-297 (10Orriss G.L. Leslie A.G.W. Braig K. Walker J.E. Structure. 1998; 6: 831-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), located at the end of the Pi binding subdomain (Fig. 1D). The value of this last approach is enhanced by the fact that protection from covalent reaction with NBD-Cl is afforded by Pi in the concentration range 2–10 mm, as was first shown by Perez et al. (11Perez J.A. Greenfield A.J. Sutton R. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 198: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with mitochondrial membranes and confirmed by us (7Ahmad Z. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31505-31513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in E. coli F1 and membrane F1F0. Here we utilized these methods to study the role of residue βAsn-243 in the Pi-binding subdomain. It was anticipated that this residue might not be directly involved in Pi binding, since it lacks positive charge; rather, it appeared more likely from its central position in the Pi-binding subdomain to be involved in hydrogen bond formation with surrounding residues, including βArg-246, and also with water molecules, including, indirectly, the putative “attacking water.” We mutagenized residue βAsn-243 to Ala to remove the side chain and eliminate hydrogen bond interactions and to Asp to introduce a negative charge and retain hydrogen bonding capacity. The two mutant enzymes, while both functionally impaired, showed different properties when subjected to assays aimed at examination of Pi binding and transition state characteristics, allowing deductions about the role of the natural residue βAsn-243.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of E. coli F1, Assay of ATPase Activity of Purified F1, and Measurement of Growth Yield in Limiting Glucose Medium—F1 was purified as described in Ref. 12Weber J.

Prior to experiments, F1 samples (100 μl) were passed twice through 1-ml centrifuge columns (Sephadex G-50) equilibrated in 50 mm TrisSO4, pH 8.0, to remove catalytic site-bound nucleotide (13Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured in 1 ml of assay buffer containing 10 mm NaATP, 4 mm MgCl2,50mm TrisSO4, pH 8.5. Specific activity was measured at 30 °C (wild type, βN243A) or 37 °C (wild type, βN243D). Measurements of inhibition of ATPase activity by inhibitors were done at 23 °C (wild type, βN243A) or at 37 °C (βN243D). Reactions were started by the addition of enzyme and stopped by the addition of SDS to 3.3% final concentration. Pi released was assayed as described in Ref. 14Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol.

DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the presence of mutations and absence of undesired changes in sequence, and the mutations were transferred to pSN6 on SacI-EagI fragments, generating the new plasmids pZA3 (βN243A/βY331W) and pZA4 (βN243D/βY331W), respectively.

NaADP and NaATP were added incrementally. For ATP and ADP titrations, the buffer was 50 mm TrisSO4, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA. Excitation was at 295 nm, emission was at 360 nm in a SPEX Fluorolog 2 spectrofluorometer. Final enzyme concentration in the cuvette was 150–200 nm, and enzyme was incubated 10 min at room temperature before titration was begun. Background signals due to buffer were subtracted, and volume and inner filter effects were corrected by carrying out parallel titrations with wild-type F1. Calculation of nucleotide binding parameters was accomplished by fitting theoretical curves to the measured data points using SigmaPlot.

The same was found here with the βN243A and βN243D mutants Open table in a new tab Inhibition of ATPase Activity—For fluoroaluminate, fluoroscandium, and fluoroberyllate inhibition, F1 was incubated for 60 min at 23 °C in 50 mm TrisSO4, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaADP, and 12 mm NaF at a protein concentration of 0.4–2.0 mg/ml in the presence of AlCl3, ScCl3, or BeSO4, added at varied concentrations (see “Results”). 50-μl aliquots were then added to 1 ml of ATPase assay buffer, and activity measured as above. It was confirmed in control experiments that no inhibition was seen if MgSO4, NaADP, or NaF was omitted. For NBD-Cl inhibition of purified F1, NBD-Cl was prepared as a stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide and protected from light. Enzyme (0.4–2.0 mg/ml) was reacted with NBD-Cl for 60 min in the dark, at 23 °C, in 50 mm TrisSO4, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgSO4, and then 50-μl aliquots were transferred to 1 ml of ATPase assay buffer to determine activity. Where protection from NBD-Cl inhibition by ADP or Pi was determined, F1 was preincubated 60 min with protecting agent before the addition of NBD-Cl. MgSO4 was present, equimolar with ADP or Pi. Control samples containing the ligand without added NBD-Cl were included. Neither Pi (up to 50 mm) nor MgADP (up to 10 mm) had any inhibitory effect alone. For measurement of azide inhibition, sodium azide at varied concentrations was added directly to the ATPase assay buffer, to which F1 was added to start the reaction.RESULTSProperties of βN243A and βN243D Mutants of E. coli ATP Synthase—The role of residue βAsn-243 in the phosphate-binding subdomain of E. coli ATP synthase catalytic sites was investigated by mutagenesis. Mutants βN243A and βN243D were obtained by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and expressed in the ATP synthase complex in strain DK8, which lacks all ATP synthase structural genes. The additional mutation βY331W was present in both cases to allow monitoring of nucleotide binding affinity and stoichiometry in purified F1 by fluorescence titration. It has been previously established that the βY331W mutation alone does not significantly impair ATP synthase function (17Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Table I shows that the mutation βN243A reduced growth yield moderately and allowed partial growth on plates containing succinate, demonstrating that it partly impaired oxidative phosphorylation in vivo. 3It should be noted that high expression in the system used increases the amount of ATP synthase in the membranes. The βN243D mutation prevented growth on succinate plates and reduced growth yield strongly, showing that oxidative phosphorylation was greatly impaired.Table IEffects of βAsn-243 mutations on cell growth and F1-ATPase activityMutationaWild type, pBWU13.4/DK8; null, pUC118/DK8Growth on succinateGrowth yield in limiting glucosebData are means of six determinations that agreed closely (±10%)ATPase activity of purified F1bData are means of six determinations that agreed closely (±10%)%μmol/min/mgWild type+++10028cMeasured at 30 °C; 42dMeasured at 37 °CNull–46–βN243A+880.95cMeasured at 30 °CβN243D–510.033dMeasured at 37 °Ca Wild type, pBWU13.4/DK8; null, pUC118/DK8b Data are means of six determinations that agreed closely (±10%)c Measured at 30 °Cd Measured at 37 °C Open table in a new tab Purified F1 proteins were obtained and shown to have the same subunit composition and purity as wild-type enzyme by SDS-gel electrophoresis. Trp content was 12 mol/mol in both mutant enzymes, confirming their purity. Specific ATPase activities are shown in Table I. βN243A enzyme was 30-fold less active than wild-type. Preliminary assays showed that βN243D had very low activity at the standard assay temperature of 30 °C; hence, it was necessary to assay at 37 °C for long times. We confirmed that the reaction stayed linear for at least 2 h, and the very low rate of nonenzymatic ATP cleavage was controlled for. βN243D F1 ATPase activity was reduced by 1300-fold relative to wild type; thus, the introduction of Asp in place of Asn had a severe effect.Catalytic Site Nucleotide Binding Properties of the Mutant βN243A and βN243D F1 Enzymes—Nucleotide binding to catalytic sites of soluble F1 was determined using the quench of fluorescence of the introduced βTrp-331. Calculated Kd values for ATP, ADP, MgATP, and MgADP are shown in Table II. In βY331W enzyme (representative of wild type) ATP and ADP are known from previous work to bind with the same affinity at all three sites (13Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Löbau S. Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3648-3656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and this behavior was also seen in the mutants. In βN243A, Kd(ADP) was slightly lower than in βY331W, but βN243D bound ADP 4-fold more tightly than βY331W, showing that the introduced carboxyl did not appear to interact with the negative charge on ADP. In both mutants ATP binding was weakened (by 3–4-fold), with βN243D showing the larger effect. In βY331W enzyme, MgADP and MgATP bind to the three catalytic sites with widely different affinities (13Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20462-20467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Löbau S. Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3648-3656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This “asymmetric” behavior was retained in the mutants. The βN243A mutant bound MgADP more weakly than βY331W at site 2 (by 12-fold) and site 3 (by 4-fold), with KdADP at site 1 similar to normal. The βN243D mutant bound MgADP more tightly than βY331W at site 1 (by 3-fold) and site 3 (by 2-fold) with KdADP at site 2 similar to normal. βN243A bound MgATP similarly to βY331W at site 1, but with 16-fold lessened affinity at site 2 and similar affinity to βY331W at site 3, whereas βN243D bound MgATP 4-fold more weakly at site 1 and 2-fold more weakly at sites 2 and 3. Overall, except for the two cases noted where the changes in Kd were on the order of 10-fold, the changes seen were small (e.g. compare with previous data showing 30–4000-fold changes in other impaired mutant enzymes) (24Löbau S.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In both mutants, all three catalytic sites would be occupied by MgADP or MgATP at saturation (∼1mm), and no general trends were evident in perturbation of nucleotide binding that could readily explain the effects seen on ATPase activity.Inhibition of ATPase Activity of F1 by Analogs Fluoroaluminate, Fluoroscandium, and Fluoroberyllate—Wild-type or βY331W E. coli F1-ATPase is strongly inhibited by AlCl3 in combination with NaF, ADP, and Mg2+ (26Lunardi J.

Fig. 2A shows that the βN243A mutant F1 was inhibited more potently than wild type by ADP-fluoroaluminate. IC50 values were as follows: wild type, 70 μm; βN243A, 18 μm.

Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For subunits c and c′, the essential glutamic acid residue is present in the last transmembrane segment, whereas for subunit c″ the essential glutamic acid residue is present near the middle of the molecule (32Mandel M.

It is these essential glutamate residues that are believed to undergo reversible protonation and deprotonation during rotary catalysis and that are thought to interact with Arg735 of subunit a to activate proton release. It is therefore important to define the helical interactions that occur between the proteolipid subunits and subunit a within the V0 domain.We have previously demonstrated by cysteine-mediated cross-linking that TM7 of subunit a is in close proximity to TM4 of subunit c′ and have identified the helical faces of these subunits that interact (36Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41908-41913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present study we have extended this analysis to the interaction of subunit a and subunit c″, whose topology and location of essential residues make it unique among the proteolipid subunits of both the V and F-ATPases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Strains—Zymolyase 100T was obtained from Seikagaku America, Inc. Protease inhibitors and the monoclonal antibody 3F10 (directed against the HA antigen) that is conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were from Roche Applied Science. The monoclonal antibody 10D7 against the yeast 100 kDa a subunit Vph1p (37Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was from Molecular Probes. Escherichia coli and yeast culture media were purchased from Difco Laboratories. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase and other molecular biology reagents were from Fisher and New England Biolabs. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and most other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Yeast strains lacking the VMA16, VPH1, and STV1 genes were constructed by replacing the entire coding region of VMA16 with the TRP gene and insertion of the LEU gene into the VPH1 gene and the LYS gene STV1 gene at the positions indicated by Manolson et al. (38Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the YPH500 strain (MAT alpha ade2, ura3, leu2, his3, trp1, lys2). The proteolipid Vma16p was tagged at the C terminus with the 9-amino acid epitope (YPYDVPDYA) from influenza hemagglutinin (HA) as described previously (34Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5821-5827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). YEPD buffered to pH 5.5 or pH 7.5 was used for selection of strains showing a vma– phenotype.Transformation and Selection—Site-directed mutants of Vph1p and Vma16p were constructed using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega), and the presence of the mutations was verified by sequencing the entire length of subcloned DNA. Plasmids carrying mutations of a and c″ are co-transformed into yeast cells lacking functional endogenous Vph1p, Stv1p, and Vma16p by the lithium acetate method (39Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). The transformants were selected on histidine minus and uracil minus plates and growth phenotypes of the mutants were assessed on YEPD plates buffered with 50 mm KH2PO4 or 50 mm succinic acid to either pH 7.5 or pH 5.5.Analysis of Subunit Expression and V-ATPase Assembly—Yeast vacuolar membranes and whole cell lysates were prepared using the protocol described previously (40Horazdovsky B.F. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4953-4962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates and vacuolar membrane enriched fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–15% gradient acrylamide gels. The presence of Vma16p on vacuolar membranes was detected by Western blotting using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody 3F10 against HA, while Vph1p was detected using the monoclonal antibody 10D7 (Molecular Probes), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) (36Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41908-41913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Blots were developed using a chemiluminescence detection method obtained from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD).Cross-linking of Subunits a and c″ by Cu(1,10-phenanthroline)2SO4 (CuP)—Cross-linking between cysteine residues introduced into subunits a and c″ was performed using the protocol described previously by Jiang and Fillingame (42Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Vacuolar membrane vesicles (∼50μg of protein) were washed in labeling buffer (5 mm Tris-Mes, pH 7.5, 0.25 mm MgCl2 and 1.1 m glycerol). 2.5 mm Cu(1,10-phenanthroline)2SO4 was added, and samples were incubated for 60 min at room temperature to catalyze disulfide bond formation. The reaction was terminated by addition of EDTA and N-ethylmaleimide to a final concentration of 15 mm and 20 mm, respectively. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–15% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody 3F10 against the HA epitope tag (36Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41908-41913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Blots were developed using the Supersignal ULTRA chemiluminescent system (Pierce).Other Procedures—ATPase activity was measured using a coupled spectrophotometric assay and ATP-dependent proton transport was measured by fluorescence quenching using the fluorescence probe ACMA as described previously (43Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were carried out in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin A, a specific inhibitor of the V-ATPase (44Drose S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described by Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205955) Google Scholar).RESULTSGrowth Phenotype of Yeast Strains Expressing Single Cysteine-containing Mutant Forms of Vma16p and Vph1p—To study the interaction between subunits a and c″, a yeast strain disrupted in the two genes that encode subunit a (VPH1 and STV1) as well as the gene encoding subunit c″ (VMA16) was constructed as follows. Using the parental strain YPH500, the VMA16 gene was replaced with the TRP gene, and the LEU and LYS genes were inserted into the VPH1 and STV1 genes, respectively, as previously described (38Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Preston R.A. Stenbit A. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M. Preuss D. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14294-14303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The VMA16 gene was expressed in this strain using the pRS413 plasmid containing the HIS marker whereas the VPH1 gene was expressed using the pRS316 plasmid containing the URA marker. A Cys-less form of Vph1p has previously been shown to support wild-type growth at pH 7.5 (21Leng X.H. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14655-14661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), suggesting it forms a V-ATPase complex possessing at least 20% of wild-type levels of activity in vitro (47Liu J. Kane P.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10938-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15MacLeod K.J. Vasilyeva E. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 150-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells co-expressing Cys-less forms of both Vph1p and Vma16p also displayed wild-type growth at pH 7.5, indicating that none of the endogenous cysteine residues in either protein are essential for activity.TM7 of Vph1p contains a buried arginine residue (Arg735) that is absolutely required for proton transport by the V-ATPase and that has been proposed to interact with the buried carboxyl groups on the proteolipid subunits (26Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12397-12402Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Unique cysteine residues were therefore introduced at nine different positions along TM7 of Vph1p, including sites predicted to reside on the same helical face as Arg735 (Ser728, Ala731, Ser732, Ala738, Leu739, and Ala742), sites adjoining this helical face (Leu734 and Leu736) and sites on the opposite helical face (Tyr733). Unique cysteine residues were also introduced into the two transmembrane helices of Vma16p that contain buried acidic residues. Assuming a four transmembrane segment model of Vma16p (34Nishi T. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5821-5827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), these correspond to TM2 and TM4 (see “Discussion”). In TM2 of Vma16p, which contains the essential glutamic acid residue Glu108, cysteine residues were introduced at Ser103, Ile104, Ile105, Phe106, Ser107, Glu108, Val109, Val110, Ala111, and Ile112. These residues correspond to approximately the central half of TM2 of Vma16p and represent all of the helical faces of this segment (33Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In TM4 of Vma16p, which contains a buried glutamic acid reside (Glu188) that is not essential for proton transport (33Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), cysteine residues were introduced at Ile184, Leu185, Val186, Ile187, Glu188, Ile189, Phe190, Gly191, Ser192, and Ile193. The yeast strain disrupted in VMA16, VPH1, and STV1 was then transformed with plasmids bearing the Cys-less form or one of the single cysteine-containing mutants of Vma16p as well as one of the single cysteine-containing mutants of Vph1p. The growth phenotype of the resultant 189 double-replacement strains at pH 7.5 is shown in Table I. As expected from previous results, strains bearing mutations at Glu108 of Vma16p showed no growth at neutral pH whereas most strains expressing the E188C mutant of Vma16p displayed a wild-type growth phenotype (33Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For mutations in the a subunit, the only mutation to seriously compromise growth at pH 7.5 was Y733C. The majority of the 189 double mutants tested showed normal (or near normal) growth at neutral pH, suggesting that the resultant V-ATPase complexes possessed significant activity in vivo.Table IGrowth phenotypes of Cys-substituted mutants at pH 7.5Subunit c″TM7 of subunit aSer728Ala731Ser732Tyr733Leu734Leu736Ala738Leu739Ala742Cys-less+++a+++ indicates wild-type growth.+++++b++ indicates partially defective growth.+c+ indicates severely defective growth.+++++++++++++++Ser103++++++++++++++++++++++Ile104+++++++++++++++++++++++Ile105+++++++++++++++++++Phe106++++++++++++++++++++++++Ser107++++++++++++++++++++++++Glu108-d- indicates no growth.--------Val109+++++++++++++++++++++++Val110++++++++++++++++++++++++Ala111++++++++++++++++++++++++Ile112++++++++++++++++++++++++Ile184++++++++++++++++++++++++Leu185++++++++++++++++++++++++Val186+++++++++++++++++++++++Ile187+++++++++++++++++++++++Glu188+++++++++++++++++++++++Ile189++++++++++++++++++++++++Phe190+++++++-++++++++++++++Gly191+++++++++++++++++++++++Ser192+++++++++++++++++++++++Ile193++++++++++++++++++++a +++ indicates wild-type growth.b ++ indicates partially defective growth.c + indicates severely defective growth.d - indicates no growth. Open table in a new tab Assembly of V0 Complexes Containing Cysteine Mutations in Subunits a and c″—To assess the effects of the mutations in Vma16p and Vph1p on assembly of the V0 domain, partially purified vacuolar membranes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies against both Vph1p and the HA-tagged Vma16p. As can be seen in Fig. 1, vacuolar membranes from all of the double replacement strains tested showed wild-type levels of both Vph1p and Vma16p, suggesting normal assembly and targeting of the V0 domain (37Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).While proton transport and ATPase activities have not been measured for vacuoles from the 189 double mutant strains analyzed, it was felt that useful information about the arrangement of V0 subunits could be obtained even from complexes lacking substantial activity, as for those displaying a vma– phenotype (Table I). This is similar to previous studies of contacts between subunits a and c′ of the V-ATPase (36Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41908-41913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and subunits a and c of the F-ATPase (42Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), where many of the strongest cross-links were observed for complexes lacking activity as assessed by their growth phenotype.ATPase and Proton Transport Activity of E108Q and E188Q Mutants of Subunit c″—It had previously been reported that the mutations E108Q in TM2 but not E188Q in TM4 of subunit c″ led to a vma–phenotype (33Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, the E108Q mutation resulted in loss of 99% of wild-type ATPase activity in isolated vacuolar membranes and qualitative loss of vacuolar acidification as assessed by quinacrine staining of vacuoles in vivo (33Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). By contrast, the effect of the E188Q mutation on ATPase activity was not determined and the effect of this mutation on proton transport was not quantitated. We therefore measured both proton transport and concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity in vacuolar membranes isolated from the wild-type strain and strains expressing the E108Q or E188Q mutations in subunit c″ as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In agreement with the previous findings (33Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), vacuolar membranes from the strain expressing the E108Q mutant of subunit c″ possessed no detectable ATP-dependent proton transport or concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity. Interestingly, vacuolar membranes from the strain expressing the E188Q mutant had 87 ± 7% of the wild-type ATPase activity but only 64 ± 4% of wild-type proton transport activity. These results suggest a partial uncoupling of the E188Q mutant and a possible function of this residue in proton transport.Cysteine-mediated Cross-linking of Subunits a and c″ Using Cupric Phenanthroline—To determine the proximity of cysteine residues introduced into TM7 of subunit a to cysteine residues introduced into TM2 and TM4 of subunit c″, vacuolar membranes were isolated from each of the strains expressing single cysteine-containing forms of Vph1p and Vma16p followed by cross-linking using cupric phenanthroline, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was performed using the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody 3F10 directed against the HA epitope tag introduced at the C terminus of Vma16p.

In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a lethal disease that is caused by the lack of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin, the cytosolic calcium concentration is known to be increased, and this increase may lead to cell necrosis. Here, we used myotubes derived from control and mdx mice, the murine model of DMD, to study the calcium responses induced by nicotinic acetylcholine receptor stimulation. The photoprotein aequorin was expressed in the cytosol or targeted to the plasma membrane as a fusion protein with the synaptosome-associated protein SNAP-25, thus allowing calcium measurements in a restricted area localized just below the plasma membrane. The carbachol-induced calcium responses were 4.5 times bigger in dystrophic myotubes than in control myotubes. Moreover, in dystrophic myotubes the carbachol-mediated calcium responses measured in the subsarcolemmal area were at least 10 times bigger than in the bulk cytosol. The initial calcium responses were due to calcium influx into the cells followed by a fast refilling/release phase from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In addition and unexpectedly, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor pathway was involved in these calcium signals only in the dystrophic myotubes. This surprising involvement of this calcium release channel in the excitation-contraction coupling could open new ways for understanding exercise-induced calcium increases and downstream muscle degeneration in mdx mice and, therefore, in DMD.

DMD results in progressive muscle degeneration (1Emery A.E. Neuromuscul. Disord. 1991; 1: 19-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar) that ultimately leads to premature death by respiratory or cardiac failure during the third decade. Pharmacological interventions such as glucocorticoids improve the quality of life of patients (2Muntoni F. Fisher I. Morgan J.E. Abraham D. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2002; 12: S162-S165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). DMD is caused by the absence of dystrophin, a 427-kDa protein localized under the plasma membrane (3Ahn A.H. Kunkel L.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In normal skeletal muscle fibers, dystrophin is associated with a glycoprotein complex and provides a linkage between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton. This complex tends to stabilize the plasma membrane (4Fabbrizio E. Bonet-Kerrache A. Limas F. Hugon G. Mornet D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown that the absence of dystrophin in DMD impairs the stability of the plasma membrane, resulting in a greater fragility toward mechanical stress and increased permeability to calcium (Ca2+) (5Gillis J.M.

Indeed, it has been proposed that an alteration of Ca2+ homeostasis might be responsible for the muscle degeneration that occurs in muscle fibers from DMD patients or in those of the mouse model of DMD, the mdx mouse (10Turner P.R. Fong P.Y. Denetclaw W.F. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1701-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 11Gailly P. Biochim. Biophys.

Elevations of cytosolic or nearplasma membrane Ca2+ concentrations in myotubes and skeletal muscle fibers from DMD patients or mdx mice have been reported (13Robert V. Massimino M.L. Tosello V.

How this increased entry of Ca2+ affects the local concentration of Ca2+ in subcellular compartments and whether this process is involved in the development of the disease is still unclear (15Ruegg U.T. Gillis J.-M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 351-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However it has already been suggested that altered Ca2+ homeostasis and fiber degeneration in mdx mice is “use-dependent” (16Sacco P. Jones D.A. Dick J.R. Vrbova G. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1992; 82: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Vilquin J.T. Brussee V. Asselin I. Kinoshita I. Gingras M. Tremblay J.P.

In skeletal muscle cells and myotubes, it has been shown that activation of nicotinic receptors leads to plasma membrane depolarization, which triggers a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel opening. Contraction is then triggered by the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through the opening of ryanodine receptors, which are activated by voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (19Berchtold M.W. Brinkmeier H. Muntener M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1215-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). However, although the role of ryanodine receptors and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are well established in excitation-contraction coupling, the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum possesses another type of Ca2+ release channel, IP3 receptors (20Powell J.A.

In many cells, increases in intracellular Ca2+ are mediated by the inositol 1,4,5-trisphoshate pathway in the following manner. The activation of numerous G-protein-coupled receptors triggers hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate IP3, which triggers the opening of IP3 receptors, and intracellular Ca2+ increases (23Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6146) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IP3 receptors may also be involved in the control of Ca2+ influx through plasma membrane store-operated Ca2+ channels (24Ma H.T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K.

In addition, it has been suggested that the intracellular messenger IP3 may contribute to excitation-contraction coupling (28Vergara J. Tsien R. Delay M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6352-6356Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown that IP3 can potentiate depolarization-induced Ca2+ release or produce the contraction of intact or skinned skeletal muscle fibers (29Talon S. Vallot O. Huchet-Cadiou C. Lompre A.-M. Leoty C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: R1164-R1173Google Scholar, 30Talon S. Huchet-Cadiou C. Leoty C. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 438: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yamaguchi N. Kasai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These results suggest that IP3 may play a role in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle cells. Furthermore, it has also been shown that the plasma membrane depolarization that activates voltage-gated Ca2+ channels can induce IP3 production and IP3 receptor activation in myotubes with a mechanism involving a G-protein (20Powell J.A.

Physiol. 2000; 278: C998-C1010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The mechanisms involved in Ca2+ responses during physiological stimulation (using nicotinic receptor agonists) have not been studied in dystrophic myotubes to date. Here, we have studied the IP3 receptor pathway in dystrophic myotubes using plasma membrane-targeted aequorin (SNAP-25 aequorin) for measuring the near-plasma membrane Ca2+ concentration. We show here that SNAP-25 aequorin is a reliable tool to measure Ca2+ increases occurring just below the plasma membrane. We also show that nicotinic receptor stimulation triggers nearplasma membrane Ca2+ increases that depend on IP3 receptor activation in myotubes derived from mdx mice only, thus showing a non-common pathway for excitation-contraction coupling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Cultures of purified myoblasts were prepared in Petri dishes (Falcon; BD Sciences) and maintained at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.The cell cultures were obtained as described previously (34Pinset C. Montarras D. Celis J. 2nd Ed. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, New York1998: 226-232Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 3-week-old mdx C57Bl/10 and control C57Bl/10 mice were killed by cervical dislocation, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle was aseptically removed bilaterally, cleaned of its tendinous ends and adhering connective tissue, and minced into small pieces of ∼1 mm3. Individual muscles from two mice were pooled. After the muscle tissues were rinsed in DMEM (Invitrogen), digestion was performed by three successive rounds of incubation in 10 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), and 0.15% Pronase (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C. After the first incubation (5 min), the tissues were triturated with a serologic pipette, and the supernatant, containing mainly blood cells and connective debris, was discarded. The second and third incubations lasted 20 min each with frequent triturations. The supernatants were collected, pooled, filtered through a 40-μm mesh cell strainer (Falcon; BD Biosciences), and centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in growth medium (see below), and the suspensions were plated onto collagen type I-coated (1 μg/cm2; Sigma) 100-mm diameter Petri dishes, one dish per original muscle. Growth medium was composed of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of DMEM and MCDB202 (CryoBioSystem) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, 2% Ultroser® SF (Biosepra SA), antibiotics (Ciproxin; Bayer), and NaHCO3 from concentrated solution (Invitrogen) to get 2.6 g/liter in complete medium. Myoblasts were plated on coated dishes and grown for ∼2 days in growth medium. For the experiments, cells were transfected (see below) and induced to fuse by changing the growth medium to differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 1.7% fetal calf serum, 3.3% horse serum (Sigma), 10 μg/ml insulin (Fluka), and Ciproxin).Transfection—Myoblasts were plated at 12,000 cells/cm2 on 13-mm Thermanox coverslips (Nalge Nunc International) in four-well plates. When 80–90% confluent, growth medium was removed and replaced with a serum-free medium, Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected overnight using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 1 μg of DNA per 2 μl of transfection reagent. The DNA-LipofectAMINE 2000 complex was prepared in Opti-MEM I medium. After overnight incubation, this medium was replaced by a differentiation medium. Myotubes were used 3 or 4 days after differentiation.Plasmids—The aequorin plasmids were gifts from T. Pozzan, Padova, Italy. Cells were transfected with a pcDNAI expression vector containing a cDNA encoding either green fluorescent protein (GFP) for localization or wild type aequorin for Ca2+ measurement, both fused with the SNAP-25 targeting sequence to measure subsarcolemmal calcium (pm[Ca2+]) (35Brini M. Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 46: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or with cytosolic aequorin to measure cytosolic calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]c) (13Robert V. Massimino M.L. Tosello V. Marsault R. Cantini M. Sorrentino V. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4647-4651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The IP3 sponge plasmid was a gift from H. L. Roderick and M. D. Bootman, Cambridge, United Kingdom. Cells were co-transfected with a pdc515 expression vector (Microbix Biosystems Inc.) containing a cDNA encoding enhanced GFP, the high affinity IP3 sponge (36Uchiyama T. Yoshikawa F. Hishida A. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8106-8113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and a pcDNAI expression vector containing a cDNA encoding the SNAP-25 aequorin.Confocal Microscopy—Mdx myotubes were grown in plastic culture dishes and transfected with a pcDNAI expression vector containing the cDNA encoding a GFP-tagged SNAP-25 targeting sequence. Confocal imaging was performed on a living myotube on a LSM 510 Meta confocal scanner mounted on an upright Axioskop 2 FS microscope (Carl Zeiss). Fluorescence was excited at 488 nm, and emission was detected at 505–530 nm using a 40 × 0.8 numerical aperture water immersion objective (Achroplan, Carl Zeiss). Simultaneous differential interference contrast images of cells were recorded on the transmitted light detector with the polarized 488-nm light used for GFP fluorescence excitation.Intracellular Calcium Measurement—After 3 or 4 days of differentiation, subsarcolemmal Ca2+ concentration was determined in a population of myotubes as described previously with minor modifications (37Challet C. Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Ruegg U.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3791-3797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, the SNAP-25 aequorin was reconstituted in a Ca2+-free physiological salt solution (PSS) (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.6) containing 0.1 mm EGTA and 5 μm coelenterazine (Calbiochem) for 1 h before the experiment to decrease the [Ca2+] within the cell. Cells were superfused at a rate of 1 ml/min in a custom-made 0.5-ml chamber thermostated at 37 °C (MecaTest, Geneva, Switzerland). Emitted luminescence was detected at 466 nm with a photomultiplier apparatus (EMI 9789A, Electron Tubes Limited, United Kingdom) and recorded every second using a computer photon-counting board (EMI C660) as described previously (38Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The relationship between recorded counts and [Ca2+] is shown in Equation 1 (39Alvarez J. Montero M. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar),[Ca2+](in M)=ratio+(ratio×KTR)−1KR−(ratio×KR)with ratio=(LLmax)1/n(Eq. 1) where L represents the recorded photons/s and Lmax represents the remaining photons that correspond to the total light output during the whole experiment minus the photons emitted up to the measured point. KTR and KR are the parameters of the aequorin and n is the number of Ca2+ binding sites. At 37 °C, KTR = 120, KR = 1.01E + 07 m-1, and n = 2.99. Total light output was obtained by exposing cells to 10 mm CaCl2 after permeabilization with 100 μm digitonin to consume all the aequorin.45Ca2+Influx Measurement—Influx measurement was performed using 45Ca2+ (5–50 mCi/mg; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described with minor modifications (40Passaquin A.C. Lhote P. Ruegg U.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, myotubes were washed twice and preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min in 250 μl of the PSS solution described above also containing 0.12 mm CaCl2 and, eventually, the indicated inhibitor. 45Ca2+ influx was initiated by incubation with 200 μl of PSS containing 1.2 mm CaCl2 alone or with 100 μm carbachol (CCh) and 0.4 mCi of 45Ca2+ for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were subsequently washed four times with ice-cold PSS containing no CaCl2 but 0.1 mm EGTA (to remove extracellularly bound 45Ca2+). Cells were lysed with 250 μl of 1% SDS (w/v). The radioactivity of the lysate was measured by scintillation counting (Packard 460C, Zurich, Switzerland). Values are expressed in counts per minute.Data Analysis—Data analysis was performed using the software GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) and Matlab (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA). Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance between the different values was assessed with the unpaired Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance test followed by a Dunnett test. p > 0.05 was considered not significant; p values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSAs the removal of intracellular Ca2+ is required for the complete reconstitution of aequorin (41Marsault R. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), SNAP-25 aequorin-expressing cells were preincubated in Ca2+-free PSS containing 0.1 mm EGTA for 1 h before performing the experiment. For each experiment the basal level of luminescence was recorded for 1 min before performing the experiment. The stimulus applied was PSS containing 1.2 mm Ca2+ and the test compounds.SNAP Aequorin Localization—To investigate the localization of the SNAP-25 aequorin, cells were transfected with cDNA encoding the GFP fused with the SNAP-25 targeting sequence. Fig. 1 shows a representative confocal section of a transfected living mdx myotube after 3 days of differentiation. SNAP-25-GFP-mediated fluorescence (Fig. 1A) appeared to be mainly localized at the sarcolemma when compared with the localization assessed with differential interference contrast imaging (Fig. 1, B and C). However, some SNAP-25-GFP fluorescence was detected in the cytosol, which could correspond to a non-palmitoylated protein (35Brini M. Pinton P. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 46: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with control C57 myotubes (data not shown).To further investigate the localization of the SNAP-25 aequorin, cells were incubated for 10 min with the high affinity Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM to buffer cytosolic Ca2+. Cytosolic Ca2+ responses assessed with cytosolic aequorin triggered by CCh and Ca2+ readdition were completely inhibited in cells loaded with BAPTA-AM (Fig. 2A). In contrast, in cells transfected with SNAP-25 aequorin the maximal Ca2+ responses and time to peak values (17.50 ± 2.0 s and 20.17 ± 2.7 s) were not significantly reduced by BAPTA-AM (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that Ca2+ responses measured with SNAP-25 aequorin were due to Ca2+ increases in a restricted area under the plasma membrane, presumably where BAPTA-AM had very limited access. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2C, the Ca2+ peaks triggered by these stimuli were 10 times larger when measured with SNAP-25 aequorin than with cytosolic aequorin (4.97 ± 0.66 and 0.53 ± 0.04 μm, respectively). Altogether, these results indicate that SNAP-25 aequorin was mainly localized at the plasma membrane. Therefore the probe appears to be a reliable tool for measuring near-plasma membrane Ca2+ concentrations.Fig. 2BAPTA-AM effect on the Ca2+ response. A and B, representative traces of the global Ca2+ concentration in a population of EDL mdx myotubes showing the effect of a 10 μm BAPTA-AM preincubation compared with non-treated myotubes. Confluent myoblasts were transfected with cytosolic aequorin (A) and SNAP-25 aequorin (B). Myotubes were used at days 3 or 4 after differentiation. Arrows indicate the beginning of stimulation with CCh. C, summarizing histogram; a cross indicates myoblasts transfected with SNAP-25 aequorin. Cytosolic Ca2+ response with BAPTA-AM is not shown because of complete abolition. The bar graphs correspond to mean [Ca2+] values ± S.E.

Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J Biochem. 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), on subsarcolemmal Ca2+ transients in both control and dystrophic myotubes. As shown in Fig. 3, 100 μm CCh together with 1.2 mm Ca2+ triggered peak pm[Ca2+] increases of 1.06 ± 0.11 μm for control cells and 4.97 ± 0.66 μm for dystrophic cells, representing a 4.5-fold increase. When cells were incubated for 10 min with 75 μm 2-APB, the CCh-induced Ca2+ response was not significantly changed in control myotubes but was significantly decreased in dystrophic myotubes (from 4.97 ± 0.66 to 1.63 ± 0.21 μm). These results therefore suggest that the Ca2+-release pathways involved in CCh responses are different between control and dystrophic myotubes and that the IP3 pathway may be involved in CCh-induced Ca2+ responses. We then investigated the pathway involved in dystrophic myotubes.Fig. 3CCh-induced Ca2+ response in control and dystrophic cells. Shown is a summarizing histogram showing the effect of 1.2 mm Ca2+ readdition together with 100 μm CCh and 75 μm 2-APB in control C57 and dystrophic myotubes. The bar graphs correspond to mean pm[Ca2+] values ± S.E. (n ≥ 4; ns, not significant (p > 0.05); *** corresponds to a significant inhibition (p < 0.001) using an unpaired Student's t test). Plain columns represent results from the control cells; hatched columns represent results from the dystrophic cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Ca2+Increases Triggered by CCh Are Mediated by Nicotinic Receptors—The application of CCh together with Ca2+ triggered pm[Ca2+] increases of a maximal amplitude of 4.97 ± 0.66 μm. As shown in Fig. 4, C and E, preincubation of cells for 10 min with atropine (100 μm), a selective muscarinic receptor antagonist, did not affect the maximal amplitude of the CCh-induced Ca2+ peak. On the other hand, 10 min of incubation with the highly selective nicotinic receptor antagonist d-tubocurarine (10 μm) decreased CCh-induced Ca2+ responses from 4.97 ± 0.66 μm in non-treated cells to 1.47 ± 0.03 μm in the presence of the compound (Fig. 4, D and E). Average CCh responses in the presence of d-tubocurarine were not statistically different from the Ca2+ responses triggered by Ca2+ readdition alone. Altogether, these results indicate that CCh-induced Ca2+ increases were mediated by the activation of nicotinic receptors.Fig. 4Nicotinic receptors are involved in the CCh-induced response. A–D, representative traces of subsarcolemmal Ca2+ increases in a population of EDL-derived mdx myotubes showing the effect of 1.2 mm Ca2+ readdition (A), 1.2 mm Ca2+ readdition together with 100 μm CCh (B), 100 μm atropine (C), and 10 μmd-tubocurarine (D). Arrows indicate the beginning of stimulation with CCh. E, summarizing histogram; the bar graphs correspond to mean pm[Ca2+] values ± S.E.

Fig. 5A shows that CCh-induced Ca2+ increases were triggered by an influx through plasma membrane Ca2+ channels. Indeed, incubation for 10 min with 1 mm cadmium, a non-selective Ca2+ channel inhibitor (43Oba T. Yamaguchi M. Wang S. Johnson J.D. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1416-1420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), drastically decreased the CCh-induced Ca2+ response (from 4.97 ± 0.66 μm for non-treated cells to 0.46 ± 0.02 μm for treated cells). Moreover, CCh had no effect on the pm[Ca2+] when added to a Ca2+-free solution, whereas the addition of CCh together with Ca2+ led to a Ca2+ response (Fig. 5B). These results strongly suggest that the Ca2+ responses were triggered at least in part by Ca2+ influx through plasma membrane Ca2+ channels.Fig. 5Initial Ca2+ influx induced by CCh.

https://openalex.org/W1977169791,"Expression of the glycogen-targeting protein PTG promotes glycogen synthase activation and glycogen storage in various cell types. In this study, we tested the contribution of phosphorylase inactivation to the glycogenic action of PTG in hepatocytes by using a selective inhibitor of phosphorylase (CP-91149) that causes dephosphorylation of phosphorylase a and sequential activation of glycogen synthase. Similar to CP-91194, graded expression of PTG caused a concentration-dependent inactivation of phosphorylase and activation of glycogen synthase. The latter was partially counter-acted by the expression of muscle phosphorylase and was not additive with the activation by CP-91149, indicating that it is in part secondary to the inactivation of phosphorylase. PTG expression caused greater stimulation of glycogen synthesis and translocation of glycogen synthase than CP-91149, and the translocation of synthase could not be explained by accumulation of glycogen, supporting an additional role for glycogen synthase translocation in the glycogenic action of PTG. The effects of PTG expression on glycogen synthase and glycogen synthesis were additive with the effects of glucokinase expression, confirming the complementary roles of depletion of phosphorylase a (a negative modulator) and elevated glucose 6-phosphate (a positive modulator) in potentiating the activation of glycogen synthase. PTG expression mimicked the inactivation of phosphorylase caused by high glucose and counteracted the activation caused by glucagon. The latter suggests a possible additional role for PTG on phosphorylase kinase inactivation.

A unique property of GL is its allosteric binding site for phosphorylase a, which accounts for the inhibition of glycogensynthase phosphatase activity by low concentrations of phosphorylase a (5Browne G.J. Delibegovic M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This mechanism enables reciprocal control of the phosphorylation state of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase (1Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Accordingly, glucose or selective inhibitors of phosphorylase a that favor the tense conformation, which is a better substrate for dephosphorylation, cause depletion of phosphorylase a (conversion to phosphorylase b) and sequential activation of glycogen synthase, whereas ligands that favor the phosphorylated state cause inactivation of synthase (14Bergans N.

Using a selective phosphorylase inhibitor (CP-91149) that causes depletion of phosphorylase a and sequential activation of glycogen synthase (17Martin W.H. Hoover D.J. Armento S.J. Stock I.A. McPherson R.R. Danley D.E. Stevenson R.W. Barrett E.J. Treadway J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1776-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), it has been shown that phosphorylase a has a very high negative flux control coefficient on glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes, indicating that a small depletion of phosphorylase a causes a large fractional stimulation of glycogen synthesis (15Aiston S.

In this study we used CP-91149 to test the hypothesis that inactivation of phosphorylase has an important contributory role to the glycogenic action of PTG in hepatocytes. The results show that the glycogenic action of PTG in hepatocytes involves multiple mechanisms, including inactivation of phosphorylase and translocation of glycogen synthase.

Hepatocyte Isolation and Treatment with Adenoviruses—Hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion (20Agius L. Peak M. Alberti K.G.M.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) of the livers of male Wistar rats (170–240 g) (B & K, Hull, UK). Hepatocytes were suspended in MEM containing 6% (v/v) newborn calf serum and plated in multiwell plates (20Agius L. Peak M. Alberti K.G.M.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). After cell attachment (∼2 h) the medium was replaced with serum-free MEM containing the adenovirus followed by a 3-h incubation. The medium was then supplemented with serum-free MEM containing 5 mm glucose and 10 nm dexamethasone, and cells were cultured for 16 h. Preparation of Recombinant Adenoviruses—PTG was subcloned into the tetracycline-responsive Adeno-X DNA vector (21Greenberg C.C. Meredith K.N. Yan L. Brady M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30835-30842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The PTG-adenovirus and the regulatory adenovirus (Adeno-X Tet-Off) were diluted in MEM containing 0.5 μg/ml poly-l-lysine hydrobromide. Hepatocyte monolayers were incubated with the PTG-adenovirus (75–1800 pfu/cell). Where indicated, cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml doxycycline to inhibit PTG expression (21Greenberg C.C. Meredith K.N. Yan L. Brady M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30835-30842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To confirm transfection efficiency, cells were treated with an adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase and stained (22Orlicky D.J. Schaak J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 460-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolic Incubations—Incubations for the determination of glycogen synthesis were performed for 3 h in fresh MEM containing 10 mm glucose, [U-14C]glucose (2 μCi/ml), and other additions as indicated. Incubation was terminated by washing with 150 mm NaCl, and cells were extracted in 0.1 m NaOH. The incorporation of radiolabel into glycogen was determined (20Agius L. Peak M. Alberti K.G.M.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cell glycogen content was determined enzymatically (20Agius L. Peak M. Alberti K.G.M.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Incubation sequences for glycogen synthase and phosphorylase a were performed with 10 mm glucose without radiolabel, and cells were extracted as described previously (23Aiston S. Andersen B. Agius L. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Active and total glycogen synthase were assayed without or with glucose-6-P, respectively (24Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar), in the homogenate. Active synthase is expressed as milliunits/mg protein or as the activity ratio (active/total). Total synthase activity was not affected by CP-91149 or PTG expression but was increased by glucokinase expression (2.7 ± 0.4 to 3.4 ± 0.4 milliunits/mg). Distribution of total synthase between the 13,000 × g pellet and supernatant was determined as described previously (3Aiston S. Green A.R. Mukhtar M. Agius L. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and is expressed as pellet percentage of the total. Phosphorylase a was assayed in the supernatant spectrometrically in the glycogenolytic direction and is expressed as milliunits/mg protein (15Aiston S. Hampson L. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Agius L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23856-23866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Distribution of phosphorylase a between the pellet and supernatant was determined radiochemically (3Aiston S. Green A.R. Mukhtar M. Agius L. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Aiston S. Andersen B. Agius L. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) from the incorporation of [1-14C]glucose-1-P into glycogen (25Gilboe D.P. Larson K.L. Nuttall F.Q. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 47: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and expressed as pellet percentage of the total. Activities were found to be 2-fold higher by the radiochemical assay compared with the spectrometric assay (3Aiston S. Green A.R. Mukhtar M. Agius L. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—For determination of phosphorylase and PTG protein, cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and protein was transferred to nitrocellulose. Phosphorylase was determined with a mouse IgG (clone 3G1) (Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ) (3Aiston S. Green A.R. Mukhtar M. Agius L. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PTG was determined as described previously (21Greenberg C.C. Meredith K.N. Yan L. Brady M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30835-30842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG and visualization with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). PTG Overexpression Stimulates Glycogen Synthesis and Inactivates Phosphorylase—Cells transduced with graded titers (75–1800 pfu/cell) of PTG-adenovirus showed increased expression of PTG protein, with a greater distribution in the 13,000 × g pellet compared with the supernatant (Fig. 1). Using a β-galactosidase adenovirus, we confirmed that transfection efficiency was >70% at viral titers >300 pfu/cell. In the rest of this study we used viral titers from 75 to 1800 pfu/cell or of 300 and 1800 pfu/cell, representing intermediate and high expression, respectively. The highest PTG overexpression increased glycogen synthesis 9-fold and active glycogen synthase 3-fold and decreased phosphorylase a by 85% (Fig. 2, A, C, and E). These effects are qualitatively similar to the effects of the phosphorylase inhibitor CP-91149 (Fig. 2, B, D, and F), which causes inactivation of phosphorylase, sequential activation of glycogen synthase, and stimulation of glycogen synthesis (15Aiston S. Hampson L. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Agius L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23856-23866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Martin W.H. Hoover D.J. Armento S.J. Stock I.A.

There was an inverse correlation between the activity of active glycogen synthase and phosphorylase a in cells incubated with CP-91149 or overexpressing PTG (Fig 2G). However, activation of synthase by CP-91149 reached saturation at lower activities of phosphorylase a, suggesting an additional role for PTG in activating synthase independently of dephosphorylation of phosphorylase a when the latter is below a threshold. Stimulation of glycogen synthesis by PTG expression was greater than with CP-91149, also indicating involvement of additional mechanisms (Fig. 2H). We confirmed that doxycycline counteracts the stimulation of glycogen synthesis by the PTG-adenovirus but not the stimulation by insulin, indicating that the metabolic changes in cells treated with PTG-adenovirus are not caused by nonspecific effects of the adenovirus. Effects of PTG Are Additive with Glucokinase Expression but Not with Phosphorylase Inactivation—To further test the role of phosphorylase inactivation in the glycogenic action of PTG, we determined the combined effects of PTG expression (300 and 1800 pfu/cell) and either incubation with CP-91149 or glucokinase expression (6–8-fold), because glucokinase and CP-91149 activate glycogen synthase by increasing glucose-6-P (26Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or by depleting phosphorylase a (15Aiston S. Hampson L. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Agius L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23856-23866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar), respectively. CP-91149 activated glycogen synthase and stimulated glycogen synthesis in non-transduced cells at the lower level but not at the higher level of PTG expression, whereas glucokinase expression had an additive effect with PTG expression on glycogen synthase activation and glycogen synthesis stimulation (Fig. 3). Inactivation of phosphorylase a by PTG expression was additive with the effects of CP-91149 and glucokinase expression (Fig. 3C). The lack of further activation of glycogen synthase in the combined presence of CP-91149 and PTG expression (Fig. 3, B compared with C) can be explained by inhibition of synthase phosphatase when phosphorylase a is above a certain threshold. Conversely, the additive effects of glucokinase and PTG on glycogen synthase can be explained by the role of glucose-6-P (27Villar-Palasi C. Guinovart J.J. FASEB J. 1997; 7: 544-558Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar) in potentiating synthase phosphatase activity by PTG or GL. Effects of PTG Expression Are In Part Counteracted by Muscle Phosphorylase—To further test the role of phosphorylase in the glycogenic effect of PTG, we determined the effects of PTG expression in combination with either expression of the muscle isoform of phosphorylase (MGP) or with short term incubation with glucagon (Fig. 4). Expression of MGP was associated with small changes in the activity of phosphorylase a (Fig. 4C), despite a large increase in total phosphorylase as confirmed by immunoblotting (2–4-fold, results not shown), indicating that the expressed protein is predominantly in the dephosphorylated state as shown previously (15Aiston S. Hampson L. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Agius L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23856-23866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar). MGP expression partially counteracted the activation of glycogen synthase and stimulation of glycogen synthesis by the lower level of PTG expression, whereas glucagon suppressed the activation of glycogen synthase and stimulation of glycogen synthesis by the higher PTG expression. The latter effect could not be explained by increased phosphorylase a because high PTG expression counter-acted the activation of phosphorylase by glucagon. PTG Overexpression Causes Translocation of Glycogen Synthase to the Pellet—The greater stimulation of glycogen synthesis by PTG expression compared with CP-91149 (Fig. 2) suggests that inactivation of phosphorylase and activation of synthase cannot fully explain the glycogenic action of PTG. We therefore tested the effects of PTG expression on the compartmentation of glycogen synthase, using a similar approach as used previously (26Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Ara C.

Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to study glucose-6-P-mediated translocation. Expression of PTG caused a 5-fold increase in the distribution of total glycogen synthase in the pellet (Fig. 5A), whereas glucokinase expression and CP-91149 caused a 4-fold and 3-fold increase, respectively, in agreement with previous studies (26Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 29Aiston S. Coghlan M.P. Agius L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2773-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Translocation by PTG expression was slightly higher (30–50%) in cells treated with CP-91149 or overexpressing glucokinase (Fig. 5A). For cells expressing PTG and/or MGP without or with incubation with CP-91149 there was a correlation between glycogen synthesis and the distribution of glycogen synthase. However, stimulation by glucokinase expression and inhibition by glucagon could not be explained by changes in glycogen synthase distribution (Fig. 5B). PTG Overexpression Causes Translocation of Phosphorylase a to the Pellet—Because glucose-6-P causes translocation of phosphorylase (determined enzymatically or by immunoblotting (3Aiston S. Green A.R. Mukhtar M. Agius L. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Aiston S. Andersen B. Agius L. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)) as well as glycogen synthase from the supernatant to the pellet (26Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Fernandez-Novell J.M. Arino J. Vilaro S. Bellido D. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we tested the combined effects of PTG and glucokinase expression on the distribution of phosphorylase. There was an additive effect of glucokinase and PTG on translocation of phosphorylase a (Fig. 6A), which correlated with the translocation of glycogen synthase (Fig 6B). Glucagon slightly lowered the distribution of phosphorylase a in the pellet. This effect was further investigated in time course experiments (see below). It is noteworthy that translocation of glycogen synthase to the pellet correlated with the relative distribution of phosphorylase a and not with the absolute activity of phosphorylase a in the pellet. This correlation is similar to previous findings (3Aiston S. Green A.R. Mukhtar M. Agius L. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) on glucose-6-P-induced translocation in which translocation of phosphorylase a was associated with translocation of immunoreactive protein. Enzyme Translocation during PTG Expression Is Not Secondary to Glycogen Accumulation—Cells treated with adenovirus for expression of PTG show progressive glycogen accumulation (12Berman H.K. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26421-26425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26396-26400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To test whether the translocation of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase to the pellet is secondary to glycogen accumulation, hepatocytes treated with PTG-adenovirus were cultured with glucagon (2 μm) plus dibutyryl cAMP (50 μm) to suppress glycogen deposition (Fig. 7A). When the distribution of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase a in the pellet were plotted against the glycogen content, the data for incubations without or with glucagon plus dibutyryl cAMP were not superimposed (Fig. 7, B and C), showing that enzyme translocation in cells expressing PTG cannot be fully explained by glycogen accumulation. As in the other experiments there was a strong correlation (p < 0.0001) between synthase and phosphorylase a distribution in the pellet (Fig 7D). PTG Expression Counteracts the Acute and Sustained Activation of Phosphorylase by Glucagon—The inactivation of phosphorylase caused by PTG expression could be caused by either an increase in phosphorylase phosphatase or by inactivation of phosphorylase kinase. To test the latter possibility, we compared the effects of PTG expression with incubation with the phosphorylase inhibitor (CP-91149) or a potent inhibitor (KT-5720) of phosphorylase kinase (30Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar) on the time course of activation of phosphorylase by glucagon. In non-transduced cells, glucagon caused rapid activation of phosphorylase that peaked within 2 min in the homogenate and pellet but reached a maximum in the supernatant after 30 min (Fig. 8A). The activity in the pellet, expressed as a percentage of the total (Fig. 8B), showed a biphasic effect with a maximum at 2 min, suggesting that activation by phosphorylase kinase occurs at least in part in the particulate fraction followed by translocation to the soluble fraction. The phosphorylase kinase inhibitor caused a delay in peak activation, whereas the phosphorylase inhibitor caused both a delay in peak activation and suppression of maximum activation. PTG expression caused a greater suppression of the glucagon-induced activation than either of the inhibitors (Fig. 8C). Inactivation of Phosphorylase a by Glucose and PTG Is Not Additive—Because glucose is the main substrate regulator of phosphorylase in liver, we tested whether glucose (25 mm) has additive effects with PTG expression on phosphorylase a activity in the homogenate and supernatant fractions (Fig. 9). Glucose (25 mmversus 5 mm) decreased the activity of phosphorylase a by 46% in the supernatant and by 29% in the homogenate in untreated cells. The decrease in phosphorylase a activity in the homogenate is a measure of dephosphorylation, whereas the decrease in the supernatant is the combined effect of dephosphorylation and translocation. The effects of glucose and PTG were not additive suggesting that PTG mimics the effect of glucose. PTG expression activates glycogen synthase and stimulates glycogen storage in various cell types (8Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Berman H.K. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Newgard C.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 30835-30842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylase a has major roles in the control of synthase phosphatase (1Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and the rate of glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes (15Aiston S. Hampson L. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Agius L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23856-23866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Aiston S. Coghlan M.P. Agius L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2773-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we tested the role of inactivation of phosphorylase in the glycogenic action of PTG in hepatocytes. We show that, in addition to a direct role as a synthase phosphatase (8Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), there are two key mechanisms by which PTG promotes glycogen storage: depletion of phosphorylase a and translocation of glycogen synthase. The role of PTG as a phosphorylase phosphatase was evident from the progressive decline in phosphorylase a with PTG expression and from the counteraction of the activation of phosphorylase by glucagon. To test the contribution of depletion of phosphorylase a to the activation of glycogen synthase and stimulation of glycogen synthesis, we used a selective inhibitor of phosphorylase (CP-91149) that causes activation of glycogen synthase by depleting phosphorylase a (17Martin W.H. Hoover D.J. Armento S.J. Stock I.A. McPherson R.R. Danley D.E. Stevenson R.W. Barrett E.J. Treadway J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1776-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). There was an apparently similar inverse correlation between activation of glycogen synthase and depletion of phosphorylase a in response to either CP-91149 or PTG expression; however, in the former but not the latter case, synthase activation approached saturation. This suggests that activation of synthase by PTG involves two components: an indirect mechanism via depletion of phosphorylase a and a direct mechanism as a synthase phosphatase that is apparent when depletion of phosphorylase a approaches saturation. The lack of additive effects of PTG expression and CP-91149 on activation of synthase indicates that PTG shares a common mechanism with CP-91149 and supports the role of phosphorylase a depletion as a contributing mechanism to the activation of synthase. The partial counter-action by muscle phosphorylase expression on synthase activation by PTG is further evidence supporting the role of phosphorylase. It is noteworthy that, although phosphorylase a is a more potent inhibitor of synthase phosphatase than phosphorylase b (1Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), the latter also has inhibitory activity (31Alemany S. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1986; 198: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The effect of MGP may be caused by binding to GL or the result of competition with glycogen synthase for PTG (32Fong N.M. Jensen T.C. Shah A.S. Parekh N.N. Saltiel A.R. Brady M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35034-35039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). PTG expression was more effective in counteracting the activation of phosphorylase by glucagon than either the phosphorylase inactivator or the inhibitor of phosphorylase kinase (KT-5720). The latter compound was identified as a cell permeable inhibitor of protein kinase A (33Kase H. Iwahashi K. Nakanishi S. Matsuda Y. Yamada K. Takahashi M. Murakata C. Sato A. Kaneko M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) and was subsequently shown to be a potent inhibitor (IC50 11 nmversus 3.3 μm) of phosphorylase kinase (30Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). At 20 μm, KT-5720 caused a delay in the activation of phosphorylase by glucagon but did not affect the sustained activation. The greater efficacy of PTG expression in counteracting activation of phosphorylase by glucagon than either the phosphorylase kinase inhibitor or CP-91149 could be the result of a dual role of PTG in promoting dephosphorylation of both phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase. The additive effects of PTG and glucokinase expression on synthase activation can be explained by the complementary roles of glucose-6-P, derived from glucokinase (a positive modulator) and depletion of phosphorylase a (a negative modulator) on synthase phosphatase activity by substrate-directed mechanisms (Fig. 10). The additive activation of synthase by glucokinase and PTG expression can also be explained by the direct effect of PTG as a synthase phosphatase (8Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Guinovart J.J. FASEB J. 1997; 7: 544-558Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar) potentiating synthase phosphatase activity. Although the lack of additive stimulation of glycogen synthesis by PTG expression and the phosphorylase inactivator confirms a role for inactivation of phosphorylase, it does not exclude additional mechanisms. We have shown that, in hepatocytes, inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3 cause a large activation of glycogen synthase but have little impact on glycogen synthesis (29Aiston S. Coghlan M.P. Agius L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2773-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The greater maximal stimulation of glycogen synthesis by PTG expression compared with the phosphorylase inhibitor indicates that in addition to synthase activation other mechanisms must be involved. Translocation of glycogen synthase to the pellet is a likely contributing mechanism as shown by the correlation between glycogen synthesis and synthase distribution in the pellet in cells expressing PTG or treated with CP-91149. This translocation is not secondary to glycogen accumulation and is best explained by a targeting role of PTG. Fig. 10 shows a tentative model for the changes in distribution (between soluble and particulate fractions) and in the activation state of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase in response to the stimuli tested in the present and previous studies (3Aiston S. Green A.R. Mukhtar M. Agius L. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Aiston S. Coghlan M.P. Agius L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2773-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Translocation of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase a occurs in tandem in response to elevated glucose-6-P (3Aiston S. Green A.R. Mukhtar M. Agius L. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Aiston S. Andersen B. Agius L. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or PTG expression (present study). The effect of glucose-6-P could be tentatively explained by an increased affinity of glycogen synthase for PTG-PP1 (see above). The phosphorylase inhibitor causes translocation of glycogen synthase to the particulate fraction concomitant with dephosphorylation of phosphorylase a (29Aiston S. Coghlan M.P. Agius L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2773-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus phosphorylase a may have a dual role in the particulate fraction as an allosteric inhibitor of GL-PP1 synthase phosphatase and as a substrate for phosphorylase phosphatase in association with PTG or GL. The time course of activation of phosphorylase b by glucagon suggests that phosphorylation occurs in the particulate fraction and may be followed by translocation to the soluble fraction. It seems likely therefore that the particulate fraction is the site for both dephosphorylation and phosphorylation of glycogen synthase and that phosphorylase and the soluble fraction in part represent a storage pool of the enzymes. PTG may have a dual role in the dephosphorylation of phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase and translocation of enzymes from the soluble pool to the particulate fraction. High glucose concentration suppresses glycogenolysis not only through glucose-mediated allosteric inhibition of phosphorylase a and dephosphorylation (1Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) but also through glucose-6-P-mediated dephosphorylation of phosphorylase a and translocation (3Aiston S. Green A.R. Mukhtar M. Agius L. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Aiston S. Andersen B. Agius L. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Two explanations are possible for the lack of additive effects of glucose and PTG on inactivation of phosphorylase a. First, glucose is more effective at promoting dephosphorylation at high activities of phosphorylase a. Second, glucose and/or glucose-6-P acts on a similar pool of phosphorylase a as PTG expression and induces translocation and dephosphorylation by similar mechanisms. In summary, the glycogenic action of PTG in hepatocytes is caused by multiple mechanisms. In addition to a direct effect as a synthase phosphatase (8Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), inactivation of phosphorylase by PTG is an upstream event in the mechanism by which PTG activates glycogen synthase and translocation of glycogen synthase contributes to the glycogenic mechanism.

Protein kinase C has been known to modulate PLC signaling by G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor-tyrosine kinases, although the molecular target has not been identified in most instances. In each case phorbol myristate acetate pretreatment of HL60, HeLa, and COS-7 cells abrogated PLC stimulation by the agonists formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, ATP, and epidermal growth factor, respectively. Here we show that phosphorylation of PITPα at Ser166 resulted in inhibition of receptor-stimulated PLC activity. Ser166 is localized in a small pocket between the 165–172 loop and the rest of the protein and was not solvent-accessible in either the PI- or phosphatidylcholine-loaded structures of PITPα. To allow phosphorylation at Ser166, a distinct structural form is postulated, and mutation of Thr59 to alanine shifted the equilibrium to this form, which could be resolved on native PAGE. The elution profile observed by size exclusion chromatography of phosphorylated PITPα from rat brain or in vitro phosphorylated PITPα demonstrated that phosphorylated PITPα is structurally distinct from the non-phosphorylated form. Phosphorylated PITPα was unable to deliver its PI cargo, although it could deliver phosphatidylcholine. We conclude that the PITPα structure has to relax to allow access to the Ser166 site, and this may occur at the membrane surface where PI delivery is required for receptor-mediated PLC signaling.

Originally identified as soluble proteins of ∼35 kDa, the family of PITP-related proteins has subsequently grown to include three subgroups of proteins all containing a PITP domain (2Hsuan J.

Although both PITP isoforms can be used interchangeably in the reconstitution assays, they are likely to have some distinct functions in vivo. Deletion of the PITPα or PITPβ genes give distinct phenotypes; deletion of the PITPα gene leads to neurodegeneration and early death, while deletion of PITPβ is embryonically lethal (17Hamilton B.A. Smith D.J.

Studies using genetic manipulation have failed to clarify the role of PITPα in PLC signaling possibly because of the overlapping roles of these isoforms (19Cunningham E. Tan S.W. Swigart P. Hsuan J.

Biol. 2003; 13: 78-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The ability of PITPα and PITPβ to transfer PI makes these soluble proteins ideally suited for regulating the spatial and temporal provision of PI in specific membrane compartments or in the nucleus where it can be phosphorylated by specific lipid kinases (2Hsuan J. Cockcroft S. Genome Biol. 2001; (http://genomebiology.com/1465-6906/2/REVIEWS3011)PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cockcroft S. De Matteis M.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 180: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently we have reported the plasma membrane association of both PITPα and -β isoforms when cells are activated by EGF to stimulate phospholipase C activity (20Larijani B. Allen-Baume V. Morgan C.P. Li M. Cockcroft S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 78-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated forms of PI play essential roles in many cellular processes. The major requirement is for PI 4,5-bisphosphate at the plasma membrane where it is a substrate for both PLC and phosphoinositide 3-kinases, enzymes whose activity is regulated by cell surface receptors. Additional roles include regulation of ion channels, enzymatic activity of phospholipase D, maintenance of the cytoskeleton, and recruitment of target proteins by interaction with their phosphoinositide-binding domains including PH (pleckstrin homology), PX (pho × homology), FYVE, and ENTH (epsin/N-terminal homology) (21Cockcroft S. De Matteis M.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 180: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Cullen P.J. Cozier G.E. Banting G. Mellor H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R882-R893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Proteins containing these domains appear to be involved in membrane traffic including endocytosis, exocytosis, and vesicle budding. Many previous studies have reported that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) attenuates receptor-coupled PLC activity thus providing a negative feedback signal to limit the magnitude and duration of receptor signaling. Despite numerous examples of such regulation, the target for PKC-mediated inhibition has not been identified (Ref. 23Yue C. Ku C.Y. Liu M. Simon M.I. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30220-30225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar; for reviews, see Refs. 24Rana R.S. Hokin L.E. Physiol.

These studies include both the G-protein-regulated PLCβ family and receptor-tyrosine kinase-regulated PLCγ family. Additionally no single lipid kinase has yet been identified that provides a dedicated pool of PI 4,5-bisphosphate for PLC-mediated hydrolysis. There are altogether four PI 4-kinases (Type II p55 isoforms (α and β) and Type III PI 4-kinase α and PI 4-kinase β) and at least three phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases (plus splice variants) (26Gehrmann T. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). So far there has been no evidence for negative regulation by phosphorylation of any of the lipid kinases by PMA. The signal transducing system and the phospholipases are different depending on the receptor, and the only common molecule that participates in both G-protein-regulated systems and receptor-tyrosine kinases is PITPα (10Kauffmann-Zeh A.

In this study we examined the possibility that phosphorylation of PITPα by PKC may be responsible for the negative feedback inhibition. While this study was in progress, van Tiel et al. (29van Tiel C.M. Westerman J. Paasman M. Wirtz K.W.A. Snoek G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21532-21538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported that PITPα was phosphorylated on Ser166in vitro by PKC. In the present study, we identified Thr59 (minor) and Ser166 (major) as two residues that when phosphorylated are negative regulators of receptor-stimulated PLC signaling. Our results support a model in which a structurally distinct pool of PITPα is phosphorylated at the membrane, and this phosphorylated PITPα is unable to deliver its PI cargo in exchange for PC at the plasma membrane. Materials—All standard chemicals were obtained from Sigma. γ-Labeled [32P]ATP, 32Pi, [3H]inositol, and [14C]acetate were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Rat brain PKC (catalog no. 539494) was purchased from Calbiochem. This preparation predominantly contains the conventional PKC isoforms α, β1, β2, and γ. Endoproteinase Glu-C (V8 protease) and trypsin (modified) were sequencing grade and were obtained from Roche Applied Science. The lipids used for exchange were dimyristoyl PC, egg yolk PC, and bovine brain PI all from Sigma. Phosphorylation of PITPα by PMA Treatment of HL60 Cells—HL60 cells (2 × 108 cells) were washed and resuspended in 2 ml of buffer (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4), and the cells were incubated for 1 h with 1 mCi of 32P-labeled sodium orthophosphate at 37 °C. The cells were washed, resuspended in 4 ml, and allowed to equilibrate for 15 min at 37 °C. 900 μl of the cells were then added to tubes containing 100 μl of PMA (100 nm final concentration), and the cells were incubated for 0, 30, 60, and 300 s at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 500 μl of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm PIPES, pH 6.8) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. PITPα was immunoprecipitated using 5F12 monoclonal antibody (30Prosser S. Sarra R. Swigart P. Ball A. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) coupled to Sepharose, and immunoprecipitates were washed five times in lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, Western blotted, phosphorimaged, and probed using the monoclonal antibody 5F12. Analysis of Receptor-stimulated Phospholipase C in Intact Cells—For HL60 cells, confluent suspension cultures (106 cells/ml) were incubated with 300 μm dibutyryl cAMP to differentiate the cells for 48 h in Medium 199 in the presence of 1 μCi/ml [3H]inositol. HeLa cells and COS-7 cells were labeled overnight with 2 μCi/ml [3H]inositol in Medium 199 supplemented with 1.5% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 5 μg/ml insulin and transferrin. In all cases, the cells were washed with HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm LiCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2) and incubated with agonist. For HL60 cells, the cells were stimulated with fMLP (1 μm) for the indicated times. COS-7 cells were stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml), and HeLa cells were stimulated with ATP (1 mm) for 20 min. Cells were pretreated with PMA (100 nm) for 5 min prior to stimulation with the agonist where indicated. Inositol phosphates were measured as described previously (8Cunningham E. Thomas G.M. Ball A. Hiles I. Cockcroft S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 775-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Production of Polyclonal Antisera to Phosphorylated Ser166—Peptide synthesis and immunization were performed by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). The peptide sequences CEDPAKFKSIKTGRGP and CEDPAKFKpSIKTGRGP (where pS is phosphoserine) were synthesized, and two rabbits were immunized with the latter phosphorylated peptide. (Cysteine was added at the N terminus to aid coupling for the immunization process.) The serum was first purified using a Protein G-agarose column (10 ml). Serum was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, applied to the column at 1 ml/min, and then washed extensively with TBS (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl), 0.02% NaN3. Bound antibody was eluted using 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and then neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 7.4. (The Protein G column was then washed with 6 m urea before reuse). The eluted antibody was concentrated and desalted to TBS, 0.02% NaN3 (8 ml). Peptide (10 mg) was coupled to 1 ml of N-hydroxysuccinimideagarose columns (Amersham Biosciences) using the manufacturer's suggested coupling conditions. Two columns were made, a column containing the phosphorylated peptide and a second with the non-phosphorylated peptide. Protein G-purified immunoglobulins were purified using the peptide columns. Initially the Protein G-purified immunoglobulins were applied to the phosphopeptide column at 0.2 ml/min, and the flow-through was then reapplied (to recover losses). The column was then washed extensively with TBS, 0.02% NaN3, and the bound immunoglobulins were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5 (3 ml) and immediately desalted to TBS/NaN3 (4 ml). The resultant immunoglobulins were tested on dot blots containing dilutions of the synthetic phospho- and non-phosphopeptides. The antibody was further purified by applying to the non-phosphopeptide column. Briefly 1 ml was applied to the column and allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min. The non-bound immunoglobulin (containing phosphopeptide antibodies) was washed through with 1 ml of TBS and then reapplied to the column in 2 × 1-ml lots (leaving to stand for 30 min in between). The column was then washed with 1 ml of TBS resulting in 3 ml of non-bound immunoglobulin. This preparation, depleted of antibodies against the non-phosphorylated peptide, was then used for Western blots. The specificity of the phosphoantibody was validated using the following criteria. The antibody was tested using PITPα mutants where the phosphorylation site was mutated to alanine (Fig. 4B) and by competing antibody binding with prior incubation with phosphopeptide and λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) treatment of phosphorylated PITPα (data not known). Production of PITPα-specific Polyclonal Antisera—Antibodies were raised in two rabbits against a specific PITPα peptide C-terminal sequence (CMRQKDPVKGMTADD). Peptide synthesis and immunization was performed by Eurogentec. Cysteine was added at the N terminus to aid coupling for the immunization process. The antisera were checked against recombinant PITPβ to confirm that they were specific for PITPα. Phosphorylation of PITPα in Acutely Permeabilized Cells—HL60 cells were acutely permeabilized with 0.6 IU/ml streptolysin O in PIPES buffer (20 mm PIPES, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml glucose, pH 6.8) in the presence of 1 mm MgATP, 2 mm MgCl2, and calcium buffered with EGTA at pCa 7 or 5 (31Stutchfield J. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). His-tagged wild-type and T59A PITPα proteins were included as indicated. Phospholipase C was stimulated with 10 μm GTPγS (31Stutchfield J. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PMA (100 nm) was added to the cells for 10 min prior to permeabilization. Following incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, cells were removed by centrifugation, and the proteins were recaptured using nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were extensively washed with PIPES buffer (containing no bovine serum albumin or glucose). Proteins were eluted with 500 mm imidazole, desalted to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and concentrated. Quantities of each protein were estimated, and equal amounts were examined for phosphorylation by Western blotting. Preparation of Rat Brain Cytosol Enriched in PITPα—Rat brains (9.5 g) were homogenized in 19 ml of buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1 ml of protease inhibitors (Sigma catalog no. P-2714). The homogenate was centrifuged to pellet membranes and insoluble material at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. Cytosol (20 ml) was filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane and concentrated in an Amicon pressure filtration device with a 10-kDa membrane to 10 ml (16 mg of protein/ml). PITP was purified from 9 ml of this cytosol (total protein, 144 mg) by gel filtration using a Superdex-75 HR 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences). 5-ml fractions were collected, and PITPα-containing fractions were located by Western blotting with PITPα- and with phospho-Ser166-specific antibodies. Fractions enriched in PITPα were pooled and concentrated for use in the in vitro phosphorylation assay. Phosphorylation of PITPα in Vitro—Partially purified rat brain PITPα (16 μg of protein) and 0.34 μg of thrombin-cleaved recombinant PITPα were phosphorylated with PKC (0.1 unit) in a volume of 50 μl containing 20 mm Tris·Cl, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm CaCl2, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 10 μg/ml diacylglycerol, 100 μm MgATP, 200 μCi–2 mCi/ml γ-labeled [32P]ATP (pH 7.5) for 1 h and analyzed by Western blotting. Recombinant PITPα protein was initially phosphorylated with the His tag remaining; however, it was discovered that the His tag was phosphorylated by PKC. The His tag was therefore removed by thrombin cleavage prior to PKC treatment. PITPα proteins were desalted into cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.4) and incubated with 1 unit of thrombin/mg of PITP for 16 h at 25 °C. PITPα was repurified by size exclusion chromatography. Cleaved recombinant PITPα was phosphorylated with purified rat brain PKC (Calbiochem). PITPα was preincubated with PI vesicles (40-fold molar excess) for 5 min at 30 °C to exchange the bound ligand to PI from the bacterially derived phosphatidylglycerol (32Hara S. Swigart P. Jones D. Cockcroft S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14909-14913Google Scholar). The mixture was phosphorylated with 70–350 ng (0.1–0.5 units) of PKC/5–10 μg of PITP in a volume of 50 μl containing 20 mm Tris·Cl, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm CaCl2, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 10 μg/ml diacylglycerol, 100 μm MgATP, 200 μCi–2 mCi/ml γ-labeled [32P]ATP (pH 7.5) at 30 °C for 20 min or 1 h as indicated. Phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were imaged using a phosphorimaging system (Fuji BAS1000). HPLC Analysis of Phosphopeptides—For HPLC analysis of the phosphopeptides, the phosphorylated protein was initially digested with proteases (trypsin or Glu-C). The phosphorylated protein was treated with 1% SDS and 10 mm dithiothreitol and boiled for 3 min. The protein was additionally treated with 4-vinylpyridine (0.5%) for 30 min at room temperature. SDS-PAGE was performed using 4–12% bis-Tris gels (Novex, Invitrogen) and MES running buffer. The band corresponding to PITPα was excised with a clean, sharp scalpel blade and placed into a clean siliconized tube (Sigma). The gel piece was washed sequentially with (i) water, (ii) 50% acetonitrile, (iii) 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and (iv) 50% acetonitrile, 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate each for 15 min. The piece was then crushed using an Eppendorf homogenizer. The resulting crushed gel pieces were incubated with 100% acetonitrile for a further 15 min and then dried under vacuum. After drying, 200 μl of Digest buffer (50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 0.025% Zwittergent 3–16) and 2–4 μg of sequencing grade protease (trypsin or Glu-C) were added and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Proteases were solubilized in 1 mm HCl at 1 mg/ml. More Digest buffer was then added to completely cover the gel pieces, and the mixture was left at 30 °C for 16 h. Following overnight digestion, the supernatant was removed from the gel pieces and filtered using an Ultra-MC filter unit (Millipore). The total volume of the filtrate was determined, and an equal volume of 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid was added. The peptides were then run on a C18 Vydac column (catalog no. 218TP54). The column was run at 0.8 ml/min using water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Pump A) and 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Pump B). Gradient conditions were 0–90 min, 0–30% B; 90–110 min, 30–50% B; 110–120 min, 50–100% B; 120–130 min, 100% B; and 130–140 min, 100–0% B. Fractions (0.5 min/0.4 ml) were collected at 0–120 min. Radioactivity was determined using Cerenkov counting in a Packard liquid scintillation counter. Mutagenesis and Purification of Recombinant PITPα Proteins in Escherichia coli—Human PITPα was expressed using pET14b vector (Novagen). Mutagenesis was performed using PCR with the following mutagenesis primers: T59E, 5′-GGCCAGTACGAACACAAGATC-3′, 3′-GATCTTGTGTTCGTACTGGCC-5′; S166E, 5′-GCAAAATTTAAAGAAATCAAAACAGGCC-3′, 3′-GGCCTGTTTTGATTTCTTTAAATTTTGC-5′; T169E, 5′-TAAATCTATCAAAGAAGGCCGAGGACC-3′, 3′-GTCCTCGGCCTTCTTTGATAGATTTA-5′; T198E, 5′-CAAACTGGTGGAAGTCAAGTTCAAG-3′, 3′-CTTGAACTTGACTTCCACCAGTTTG-5′; T251E, 5′-GGAAGAAGAGGAAAAGAGACAGC-3′, 3′-GCTGTCTCTTTTCCTCTTCTTCC-5′; T59A, 5′-GGCCAGTACGCACACAAGATC-3′, 3′-GATCTTGTGTGCGTACTGGCC-5′; S166A, 5′-GCAAAATTTAAAGCAATCAAAACAGGCC-3′, 3′-GCCTGTTTTGATTGCTTTAAATTTTGC-5′. Primers for the 5′ and 3′ ends (5′-CTCCGACCATATGGTGCTGCTCAAGGAGTATCG-3′ and 5′-CCGGGATCCTAGTCATCTGCTGTCATTCC-3′) were used to ligate the mutated sequences into pET14b vector with NdeI and BamHI. Proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified using nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Invitrogen) as described previously (32Hara S. Swigart P. Jones D. Cockcroft S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14909-14913Google Scholar). The His-tagged proteins were desalted to PIPES buffer (20 mm PIPES, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, pH 6.8), concentrated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. When required, the His tag was removed following cleavage with 1 unit of thrombin/1 mg of PITPα proteins (16 h at 25 °C) followed by size exclusion chromatography. Native PAGE—Thrombin-cleaved wild-type and T59A (10 μg) proteins were resolved by native PAGE. Novex Tris/glycine native gels (10–20%), Tris/glycine running buffer, and sample buffer were obtained from Invitrogen. Gels were run at a constant 125 V for 5 h at room temperature. Proteins were additionally examined by SDS-PAGE to check for purity. Reconstitution of G-protein-stimulated Phospholipase C Activity in Permeabilized HL60 Cells—The reconstitution of PLC activity was measured for each mutant using cytosol-depleted HL60 cells (8Cunningham E. Thomas G.M. Ball A. Hiles I. Cockcroft S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 775-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In brief, [3H]inositol-labeled HL60 cells were permeabilized with streptolysin O to remove endogenous PITPs, washed, and stimulated with GTPγS (10 μm) in the presence of Ca2+ (1 μm) and 1 mm MgATP. After incubation for 20 min at 37 °C, the production of 3H-labeled inositol phosphates was measured as an indicator of PLC activity. Transfer and Binding of PI and PC—Transfer of PI by PITPα in vitro was measured by monitoring the transfer of [3H]inositol-labeled PI from microsomes to non-labeled liposomes as described previously (28Thomas G.M. Cunningham E. Fensome A. Ball A. Totty N.F. Tro"
https://openalex.org/W2163086900,"Saccharomyces Sac3 required for actin assembly was shown to be involved in DNA replication. Here, we studied the function of a mammalian homologue SHD1 in cell cycle progression. SHD1 is localized on centrosomes at interphase and at spindle poles and mitotic spindles, similar to α-tubulin, at M phase. RNA interference suppression of endogenous shd1 caused defects in centrosome duplication and spindle formation displaying cells with a single apparent centrosome and down-regulated Mad2 expression, generating increased micronuclei. Conversely, increased expression of SHD1 by DNA transfection with shd1-green fluorescent protein (gfp) vector for a fusion protein of SHD1 and GFP caused abnormalities in centrosome duplication displaying cells with multiple centrosomes and deregulated spindle assembly with up-regulated Mad2 expression until anaphase, generating polyploidy cells. These results demonstrated that shd1 is involved in cell cycle progression, in particular centrosome duplication and a spindle assembly checkpoint function.

These results demonstrated that shd1 is involved in cell cycle progression, in particular centrosome duplication and a spindle assembly checkpoint function. Accurate transmission of genetic material to daughter cells in mitosis is essential. The mitosis checkpoint, also known as the spindle assembly checkpoint, is a crucial process to prevent resumption of DNA synthesis before mitosis has been completed and to ensure that chromosomes segregate evenly to daughter cells (1Lanni J.S. Jacks T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The centrosome composed primarily of γ-tubulin is a major microtubule-organizing center in eukaryotic cells and plays a prominent role in mitosis, ensuring the establishment of bipolar spindles and balanced chromosome segregation. The mitotic spindle is composed primarily of microtubules, which are dynamic cytoskeletal polymers of α/β-tubulin subunits with an intrinsic structural polarity. Chromosome movement on the spindle during mitosis and meiosis is powered and regulated by the centromere of chromosomes. Nascent mitotic spindle assembly is a dynamic process with dissociating and reassociating microtubules attaching to chromosomes at their kinetochores. At the site of cell division, mitotic spindle pole bodies are localized in the cortex of the nucleus and recruit proteins involved in actomyosin ring assembly during mitotic spindle assembly (2Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Cytokinesis, the final step of cell division, is affected by a wide range of chromosomal perturbations, and the spindle checkpoint is of great importance and has been intensively investigated. The Saccharomyces suppressor of actin 3 (Sac3) 1The abbreviations used are: Sac3, suppressor of actin 3; SHD1, Sac3 homology domain 1; GANP, germinal center-associated nuclear protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Mad2, mitotic arrest-deficient 2; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PI, propidium iodide; siRNA, small interfering RNA; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. gene is a suppressor of actin formation and Sac3 mutants cause a delay of the cell cycle at the G2/M transition, abnormal DNA synthesis, and different types of abnormal actin assembly (3Bauer A. Kölling R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1575-1583PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that mammalian homologues of Sac3 might play critical roles in cell cycle progression at the mitosis to postmitosis transition. We have identified a mouse gene homologous to Sac3, designated Sac3 homology domain 1 (shd1), and determined its sequence (GenBank™ accession number AJ131957). In mouse and human cells, two kinds of genes show sequence similarity to Saccharomyces Sac3; one is the germinal center-associated nuclear protein (ganp) gene that is up-regulated in germinal center B cells of peripheral lymphoid follicles created in response to T cell-dependent antigens (4Kuwahara K. Yoshida M. Kondo E. Sakata A. Watanabe Y. Abe E. Kouno Y. Tomiyasu S. Fujimura S. Tokuhisa T. Kimura H. Ezaki T. Sakaguchi N. Blood. 2000; 95: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Abe E. Kuwahara K. Yoshida M. Suzuki M. Terasaki H. Matsuo Y. Takahashi E. Sakaguchi N. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 255: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the other is the shd1 gene. The Sac3 homology region is 600 amino acids in mouse and is the middle peptide of the 210-kDa GANP, which also carries regions possibly involved in other function(s). The Sac3 homology region, however, is almost the entire putative SHD1 protein; amino acids 70–425 of the 425 amino acid SHD1 sequence. These two mammalian molecules with Sac3 homology might play a role in mitosis similar to Saccharomyces Sac3. We report here studies of the expression and function of SHD1 protein. SHD1 is localized on centrosomes at interphase and at spindle poles and mitotic spindles at M phase. Using RNA interference suppression of shd1, we have investigated how SHD1 might affect the cell cycle and demonstrate that the expression of SHD1 might be necessary for centrosome duplication and proper spindle formation during cell cycle progression. This notion was confirmed in vitro by transfection with a mouse shd1 cDNA clone that encodes the Sac3 homology peptide as a fusion protein of SHD1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP). The results from both experiments suggest that SHD1 is involved in regulation of the cell cycle at M phase. Mice and Cell Culture—C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Japan (Yokohama, Japan). NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan), 2 mm l-glutamine (Cambrex, Baltimore, MD), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. Polyclonal Antibody (Ab) and Monoclonal Ab (mAb) against Mouse SHD1—Polyclonal anti-SHD1 Ab was prepared by immunization of rabbits with glutathione S-transferase-SHD1 protein using the same shd1 cDNA fragment introduced into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Antisera were purified using protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). A rat mAb against mouse SHD1 (clone 45-87) was prepared by the standard procedure (6Kuwahara K. Tomiyasu S. Fujimura S. Nomura K. Xing Y. Nishiyama N. Ogawa M. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Izuta S. Sakaguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10279-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Ten micrograms of total protein, measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories), was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. For detection of endogenous SHD1, polyclonal anti-SHD1 Ab was used in combination with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary Ab followed by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was reprobed with anti-β-actin mAb (clone AC-15; Sigma) to provide an internal standard and to evaluate the amount of cell extract in different lanes. Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on coverslips and in Lab-Tek Chambers (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) were rinsed with PBS and fixed in PBS containing 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. For staining of SHD1, γ-tubulin, pericentrin, α-tubulin, and mitotic arrest-deficient 2 (Mad2), cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min. After washing with PBS, fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed with PBS, and then blocked for 15 min with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The primary Abs were as follows. Rat anti-mouse SHD1 mAb (45-87) was described above. Mouse mAbs were anti-γ-tubulin (clone GTU88, Sigma) and anti-α-tubulin (clone B-5-1-2, Sigma). Polyclonal rabbit anti-Mad2 and anti-pericentrin Abs was purchased from Covance (Berkeley, CA). Signal probes were either Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG Ab, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Ab, Texas Red-X conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Ab, or Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG Ab (all from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 1 μg/ml RNase A. After extensive washing with PBS, the slides were counterstained with 5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Roche Applied Science) and 10 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI, Sigma) in PBS for 20 min and mounted with anti-fade mounting medium (2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in 80% glycerol). Images collected using fluorescent microscope (BX51, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) or confocal laser scanning microscope (FV500, Olympus) were processed using Photoshop software. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—siRNA representing shd1 cDNA nucleotides 532–1364 and luciferase cDNA nucleotides 128–1045 were generated in vitro by using Dicer siRNA Generation kit (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). PCR products with T7 promoter sequences were transcribed in vitro, and the resulting double-stranded RNA was digested with recombinant Dicer enzyme to convert siRNA. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with shd1-siRNA using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. After 72 h, cells were harvested and analyzed. luciferase-siRNA was used as a control, and rhodamine-labeled non-silencing siRNA (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to check the transfection efficiency. SHD1 disruption was estimated by comparing the ratio of SHD1 and β-actin band intensities (each analyzed by quantity software of the Discovery System, VersaDoc, Bio-Rad) between control and shd1-siRNA transfections. Electron Microscopic Analysis—Cultured cells were fixed in situ with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 100 mm cacodylate buffer and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer. After dehydration in graded ethanol solutions, samples were embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections and serial thick sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed in an H-7500 electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Five microgram of total cell RNA extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was used as template for cDNA synthesis with Superscript II (Invitrogen). PCR amplification was carried out with primers for shd1 and β-actin using Pfu-Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (5Abe E. Kuwahara K. Yoshida M. Suzuki M. Terasaki H. Matsuo Y. Takahashi E. Sakaguchi N. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 255: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The primers for shd1 transcripts were 5′-GGGGATCCACCATGGCGGAGGTGGCGAGCTTTGT-3′ (shd-1 forward primer) and 5′-GGCCCGGGCTAGAGCTTTGCGGCGGGCATACC-3′ (shd-1 reverse primer). The primers for β-actin were described previously (5Abe E. Kuwahara K. Yoshida M. Suzuki M. Terasaki H. Matsuo Y. Takahashi E. Sakaguchi N. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 255: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Stable shd1-gfp Transfectants—Mouse shd1 cDNA was cloned into a pSVEGFP pA expression vector under SV40 promoter control (7Kuwata N. Igarashi H. Ohmura T. Aizawa S. Sakaguchi N. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6355-6359PubMed Google Scholar). After confirming SHD1 protein expression by the fusion protein GFP signal in COS7 cells, the construct was transfected into NIH3T3 cells with a pKJ2 vector containing a neomycin resistant gene using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen) and selected with G418 (0.6 mg/ml; Promega, Madison, WI). Two weeks after selection, GFP-positive cells were sorted using FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences-Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA) and then cultured in complete medium containing G418 (0.6 mg/ml). Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were suspended in hypotonic PI solution (50 μg/ml in 0.1% sodium citrate and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing RNase A (250 μg/ml). After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, cells were analyzed by FACS Calibur with MODFIT LT software (BD Biosciences). Expression of SHD1 during Cell Cycling—Expression of endogenous SHD1 protein was examined by Western blot analysis. Anti-SHD1 Ab identified a 49-kDa band in spleen cells (Fig. 1A). We then examined the subcellular distribution of SHD1 by immunofluorescent staining in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1, B and C). During cell cycling, SHD1 was evident at centrosome of interphase and mitotic cells as colocalized with γ-tubulin expression, and spindle-like structures were also observed at mitosis by anti-SHD1 staining (Fig. 1B). Next we examined the localization of SHD1 during early and late mitosis extensively with anti-SHD1 mAb, anti-α-tubulin mAb (microtubules), and DAPI (DNA). SHD1 was observed at spindle poles and spindles during metaphase, anaphase, and telophase and at midbody during cytokinesis as colocalized with α-tubulin expression (Fig. 1C), similar to observations for NudC (8Aumias J.P. Williams S.N. Luo W. Nishino M. Caldwell K.A. Caldwell G.A. Lin S. Yu-Lee L. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1991-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), Ask1 (9Li Y. Bachant J. Alcasabas A.A. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 183-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), CHO1 (10Matuliene J. Kuriyama R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1832-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and STK15/BTAK/aurora2 (11Zhou H. Kuang J. Zhong L. Kuo W.-L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). These results suggest that SHD1 might be involved in chromosome segregation, mitosis progression, and cytokinesis during cell cycling. Effect of Cell Cycle Progression in shd1-siRNA-Treated Cells—We employed experiments to examine the effect of suppression of SHD1 expression using shd1-siRNA with the Dicer system. Treatment with shd1-siRNA reduced the shd1 transcription to 18% (Fig. 2A, the expression in S**versus in L** in comparison with β-actin transcripts in the left panel) and the protein expression to 16% (the expression in S**versus in L** in comparison with β-actin on Western blot analysis in the middle panel and the relative values shown in the right panel). The transfection efficiency was 60–80% as measured with a rhodamine-labeled non-silencing siRNA (data not shown). Interestingly, the shd1-siRNA treatment increased the number of cells bearing micronucleus (Fig. 2B, left panel) as counted (8.5% of shd1-siRNA-treated versus 3.0–3.9% of controls) (Fig. 2B, right panel). The γ-tubulin expression showed defective centrosome duplication in shd1-siRNA-treated cells, displaying only a single apparent centrosome at one of the poles at metaphase (Fig. 2C, nearly 50% of cells and the representative picture are shown), whereas no such defect was detected in the controls. Pericentrin staining showed the cells with similar abnormality of the centrosome duplication displaying a single centrosome in shd1-siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 2D). Electron microscopic observation on thick sections spanning entire cells confirmed the presence of orthogonal centriole pairs in the control luciferase-siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 2E). However, the careful observation of shd1-siRNA-treated cells demonstrated the cells with only a single centriole (Fig. 2E). These observations confirmed the abnormality of centrosome duplication in shd1-siRNA-treated cells.Fig. 2Impairment of mitotic progression in SHD1 knockdown cells.A, expression of shd1 transcripts and SHD1 protein in shd1-siRNA-treated cells.

Western blot analysis was carried out as in Fig. 1A. Relative amount of SHD1 protein was expressed as percentage in comparison with luciferase-siRNA-treated cells based on the expression of β-actin (right panel) as measured by a photoimage system. B, increased number of cells with micronuclei in shd1-siRNA-treated cells. Parent NIH3T3 cells, luciferase-siRNA-treated cells, and shd1-siRNA-treated cells were stained with DAPI. Representative data showing micronuclei (indicated by arrowheads) were shown (left panel). The percentages of micronuclei were calculated under fluorescent microscope (right panel, *, p < 0.05). The experiments were carried out three times, and each number was counted from 200 cells per group. C and D, impairment of centrosome duplication in shd1-siRNA-treated cells. luciferase- and shd1-siRNA-treated cells were stained with anti-γ-tubulin mAb or with anti-pericentrin Ab and PI. Centrosomes at the poles are indicated by arrowheads. E, monocentriole cells were observed in cells treated with shd1-siRNA by electron microscopy. Overview of the cell identified the cells at the nuclear envelope breakdown. Careful examinations of more than 200 cells revealed cells with a single centriole in the shd1-siRNA-treated cells but showed only the cells with pairs of orthogonal centrioles in the luciferase-siRNA-treated cells. Arrowheads indicate the centrioles, and the bars are the scales for the length of 1 μm. F, insufficient spindle formation in shd1-siRNA-treated cells. luciferase- and shd1-siRNA-treated cells were stained with anti-α-tubulin mAb and PI. G, decreased expression of Mad2 in shd1-siRNA-treated cells. luciferase- and shd1-siRNA-treated cells were stained with anti-Mad2 polyclonal Ab and PI. Mad2 expression was down-regulated at the kinetochore in shd1-siRNA-treated cells in comparison with in luciferase-siRNA-treated cells (as indicated by arrows).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The α-tubulin expression clearly demonstrated the insufficient spindle formation in shd1-siRNA-treated cells, displaying no clear bipolar localization of spindle poles and instead the deregulated distribution of α-tubulin gathering at one of the poles with unaligned chromosomes and barely detectable spindles at the misaligned chromosomal area (Fig. 2F, b–d; more than 66% of metaphase cells). There is no clear midbody matrix in comparison with the control cells (nearly 50% of anaphase cells, representative picture in Fig. 2F, f). shd1-siRNA-treated cells showed down-regulation of Mad2 expression, especially as a form associated with chromosomes (Fig. 2G; in nearly 50% of prometaphase cells as indicated by an arrow in the lower panel). Recent studies have shown that spindle assembly checkpoint proteins, Mad2 and Bub1, localize at the kinetochores of vertebrate cells during part of mitosis (12Chen R.H. Waters J.C. Salmon E.D. Murray A.W. Science. 1996; 274: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 13Li Y. Benezra R. Science. 1996; 274: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 14Taylor S.S. McKeon F.

As the spindle assembly checkpoint, Mad2 up-regulation delays cell cycle progression at anaphase (16Straight A.F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R613-R616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In normal cells and mock transfectants, Mad2 expression appears exclusively at prometaphase and is detected at the kinetochores (as indicated by an arrow in the upper panel). These results demonstrated that the regulation of SHD1 expression during cell cycling is important for proper centrosome duplication and mitotic progression. Effect of shd1-gfp Transfection on Cell Cycle Progression of NIH3T3 Cells in Vitro—To confirm that the abnormalities were caused functionally by suppression of shd1 transcripts, we addressed if the adverse effect was observed in the shd1 overexpressed cells. A vector that expresses a fusion protein of SHD1 amino acids 70–425 and GFP was introduced in NIH3T3 cells, and the shd1-gfp transfectants were selected by GFP-positivity after short term culture. The shd1-gfp transfectants mostly express GFP signal (82%, Supplemental Fig. 1) and showed the introduced SHD1-GFP protein in addition to the similar expression level of endogenous SHD1 protein (Fig. 3A). The same blot was confirmed by anti-GFP Ab (data not shown). DNA profiles after PI staining and FACS analysis showed that shd1-gfp transfectants lacked G0/G1 cells containing 2n DNA and most cells had 4n DNA (Fig. 3B). However, some shd1-gfp transfectants showed greater DNA content, between 8n and 16n in DNA profiles. Microscopic analyses showed abnormalities of multi-nucleated cells, in shd1-gfp transfectants (Fig. 3C, left panel, and the calculated numbers in the right panel) in comparison with mock transfectants (data not shown). These results suggest that shd1-gfp transfection generates polyploid cells with more DNA content than the 2n of G0/G1 cells. Electron microscopic analysis of shd1-gfp transfectants found pleomorphism (Fig. 3D). Compared with mock transfectants (a), the shd1-gfp transfectants showed abnormalities in nuclear architecture (30% of cells). The shape of nuclei varied, ranging from multilobulated to multinucleated (b and c), which was apparently different from the control (a). These observations suggest that introduction of shd1-gfp interferes with chromatin segregation into daughter nuclear compartments. Abnormality of Mitotic Progression in shd1-gfp Transfectants—To study whether the mitosis triggered in shd1-gfp transfectants is affected, we examined expression of γ-tubulin in the transfectants (Fig. 4A). In mock transfectants, γ-tubulin foci were observed in >97% of mitotic cells as clear twin spots at centrosomes at the poles in a bipolar fashion connecting to chromosomes. In contrast, >30% of mitotic cells in the shd1-gfp transfectants did not show a typical twin pattern but had irregular and uneven profiles and abnormal localization with more spots, suggesting that centrosome duplication was abnormal.Fig. 4Expression of mitotic checkpoint molecules in shd1-gfp transfectants.A, centrosomes in shd1-gfp transfectants. The expression of γ-tubulin was examined in comparison to DNA staining. Arrowheads indicate abnormal numbers and localization of centrosomes. B, abnormalities of spindle formation in shd1-gfp transfectants. The expression of α-tubulin was examined in comparison to DNA staining. In comparison with control cells during metaphase showing a typical appearance (a), shd1-gfp transfectants showed abnormal spindle polarization (b, tripolar; c, tetrapolar; and d, multipolar) and the defects of chromosome alignment (c and d, arrowheads). At anaphase, formation of midbody matrices and spindle poles were inhibited in shd1-gfp transfectants. In comparison to the normal formation of the midbody matrix and spindle poles in mock-transfectants (e), shd1-gfp transfectants lacked the formation of spindle poles (f and g) and/or midbody matrix (g, arrow). C, aberrant localization of Mad2 during metaphase and anaphase in shd1-gfp transfectants. Mad2 expression was examined in comparison to DNA staining. In anaphase, Mad2 was at the kinetochores in shd1-gfp transfectants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We examined spindle assembly in mitotic phase in shd1-gfp transfectants by α-tubulin and DNA staining (Fig. 4B). Compared with mock transfectants with clear bipolar spindles (a), shd1-gfp transfectants showed various abnormalities (i.e. tripolar (b), tetrapolar (c), and multipolar (d) spindles; 70% of cells), which may cause asymmetrical repartitioning of chromosomes at metaphase. These chromosome segregation defects also included unaligned and unattached chromosomes (Fig. 4B, c and d, arrowheads). During anaphase, spindle poles were not clear (50% of cells, Fig. 4B, f and g) compared with control cells. More severe anaphase defects were absence of dense midbody matrix formation at the intercellular bridge region (Fig. 4B, g, an arrow indicates the position for dense midbody matrix). The shd1-gfp transfectants showed up-regulation of Mad2 expression with irregular distributions at metaphase compared with mock transfectants (Fig. 4C and Supplemental Fig. 2). shd1-gfp transfectants showed Mad2 expression at metaphase and anaphase (10–15% of cells), where Mad2 is inactive and is normally undetectable, suggesting that Mad2 is still active during anaphase in shd1-gfp transfectants. These results confirmed that the cell cycle effect in the dicer shd1-siRNA was indeed caused by the down-regulation of shd1 expression. The studies reported here show that shd1 expression is involved in regulation of cell cycle progression for proper cell division, especially at centrosome duplication, the spindle assembly checkpoint from metaphase to anaphase, and spindle formation. SHD1 is localized at the mitotic structures during the cell cycle. To understand the role of SHD1 in regulating the cell cycle, the level of shd1 expression in NIH3T3 cells was modulated by transfection with shd1-siRNA and shd1 cDNA treatment. Suppression of endogenous SHD1 expression by shd1-siRNA treatment clearly demonstrated the abnormality in centrosome formation. The shd1-siRNA-treated cells showed the decreased potential of centrosome duplication, displaying a single apparent centrosome at metaphase with γ-tubulin assembly. Spindle assembly of the shd1-siRNA-treated cells are irregular without any clear foci of two spindle poles at the proper sites but instead distribute the weaker α-tubulin gathering at the margin of the chromosomal area at mitosis. These results suggested that the decrease of SHD1 expression resulted in the weaker potential to create the γ-tubulin assembly to generate clear bipolar centrosomes, which is essential for the accurate separation of tetraploid chromosomes toward two daughter cells. Contrary to the RNA interference suppression method, the shd1-gfp transfectants in the studies reported here displayed the opposite effect upon centrosome amplification, of which abnormality is similar to cells lacking p53 (17Fukasawa K. Choi T. Kuriyama R. Rulong S. Vande Woude G.F. Science. 1996; 271: 1744-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), with abnormal centrosome amplification generating multiple spindle poles in both cases. p53 has the potential to mediate its checkpoint functions as a transcription factor: p53 activates certain genes by binding to p53 response DNA elements and represses transcription of other genes lacking p53 response elements. SHD1 might act on one of the pathways critical for suppressing cytokinesis. Caffeine treatment generally rescues G2/M arrest caused by irradiation by a p53-dependent mechanism (18Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). However, shd1-gfp transfectants were less sensitive to caffeine rescue (data not shown). No increase of apoptotic cells in shd1-gfp transfectants were observed, suggesting that the cell cycle alteration induced by shd1 over-expression either is not directly regulated by a p53-dependent mechanism or is associated with regulation of downstream p53-dependent transcription. A similar phenotype also resulted from impaired spindle formation, which is regulated by the spindle checkpoint. A critical requirement for spindle checkpoint function is the activation of Mad2, which prevents activation of anaphase-promoting complex-Cdc20 thereby suppressing Pds1 activation and blocking cell division (19Yu H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Mad2 expression was decreased in shd1-siRNA-treated cells and adversely increased in shd1-gfp transfectants, suggesting that shd1 affects the cell cycle via a mechanism associated with Mad2 up-regulation. We speculate that increased Mad2 is a response to accelerated cell cycle progression via anaphase-triggered SHD1 expression. However, it is possible that SHD1 has an anti-Mad2 effect on the late M phase checkpoint, and cell cycle progression might be regulated by a balance between SHD1 and Mad2. To investigate direct interactions of SHD1 and Mad2, we examined whether these molecules were associated in transfectants, but no evidence of direct interaction was found by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (data not shown). It is now important to determine how Mad2 expression is regulated by increased SHD1 expression. The shd1-siRNA-treated cells displayed metaphase cells with decreased number of centrosomes, and the chromosomes seem to be aligned on the metaphase plate but the alignment was apparently different from the control cells (Fig. 2C). To further examine the abnormality of the shd1-siRNA-treated cells, we carried out the electron microscopic observation, which definitely showed the cells with a single centriole in shd1-siRNA-treated cells but not in the control-treated cells. Recent report demonstrated that spindle formation and centrosome duplication might occur through various different mechanisms (20Fisk H.A. Mattison C.P. Winey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14875-14880Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Another report demonstrated the case of functional spindles despite an abnormal centriole (21Bobinnec Y. Khodjakov A. Mir L.M. Rieder C.L. Edde B. Bornens M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1575-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Acentriolar cells might modify the distribution of pericentriolar material at mitosis, which will be partially focused at minus ends of spindle microtubules, and then recruit other spindle pole components together. The shd1-gfp transfectants showed metaphase cells with asymmetrical repartitioning of chromosomes that was presumably caused by the multiple spindle poles (17Fukasawa K. Choi T. Kuriyama R. Rulong S. Vande Woude G.F. Science. 1996; 271: 1744-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). However, the shd1-gfp-transfected anaphase cells showed no clear spindle poles at this stage. The apparent chromosome segregation seemed to be unaffected regardless of the abnormality of the spindle pole formation, suggesting that the alternative mechanism might be in action as reported previously (22Varmark H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 91: 904-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces Ipl1p/human homologue aurora2 is a cell cycle-regulated protein associated with the spindle. Ipl1p mutants can separate sister chromatids but are defective in chromosome separation. During S phase, the centrosome duplicates and begins to separate. At anaphase, when the DNA separates, spindle poles are found at opposite poles in of each wild-type bud, but in Ipl1p mutants the spindle poles separate to opposite poles even though the DNA segregates asymmetrically (23Biggins S. Severin F.F. Bhalla N. Sassoon I. Hyman A.A. Murray A.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ipl1p mutant cells have two spindle poles throughout the cell cycle, similar to wild-type cells. However, the studies reported here found that shd1-gfp transfectants show apparent abnormalities in the number and movement of centrosomes during mitosis. SHD1 may be involved in regulation of centrosome duplication, separation, and/or correct localization. Therefore, we speculate that SHD1 involvement in regulation of spindle poles begins at an earlier stage than Ipl1p/aurora2 and that both can subsequently cause kinetochore abnormalities during late M phase. Mammalian Sac3 homologues have been characterized; the ganp gene on human chromosome 21 and two related isoforms on syntenic mouse chromosome 10, a 210-kDa GANP (4Kuwahara K. Yoshida M. Kondo E.

GANP has a region with sequence similarity to Sac3 in addition to functional domains for amino-terminal RNA-primase and carboxyl-terminal MCM3-binding activities (4Kuwahara K. Yoshida M. Kondo E.

Because Saccharomyces Sac3 does not have these latter two functional domains, the shd1 may be a better functional analog of Saccharomyces Sac3. SHD1 has no other apparent functional consensus motifs or domains associated with cell cycle regulation and gene transcription. SHD1 has 81% sequence similarity to the human shd1 gene, and both human and mouse genes are similar to Saccharomyces Sac3. We have documented a functional role for SHD1, the smallest cell cycle regulatory protein with Sac3 homology. Abnormal SHD1 expression may be related to the aneuploidy common in tumors and correlated with metastasis and poor prognosis (25Sandberg A.A. Mutat.

TraI cleaves supercoiled <i>oriT</i> DNA with site and strand specificity <i>in vitro</i> but fails to initiate unwinding from this site (<i>nic</i>). The helicase requires an extended region of adjacent single-stranded DNA to enter the duplex, yet interaction of purified TraI with <i>oriT</i> DNA alone or as an integral part of the IncF relaxosome does not melt sufficient duplex to load the helicase. This study aims to gain insights into the controlled initiation of both TraI-catalyzed activities. Linear double-stranded DNA substrates with a central region of sequence heterogeneity were used to trap defined lengths of R1 <i>oriT</i> sequence in unwound conformation. Concomitant reconstitution of TraI DNA transesterase and helicase activities was observed. Efficient helicase activity was measured on substrates containing 60 bases of open duplex but not on substrates containing ≤30 bases in open conformation. The additional presence of auxiliary DNA-binding proteins TraY and <i>Escherichia coli</i> integration host factor did not stimulate TraI activities on these substrates.

In this case, a part of the chemical energy derived from ATP cleavage is used for Ca2+ transport, and a part is converted into heat.

Thus, during the course of the reaction, the amount of heat released varies depending on how much ATP is cleaved in each of these two routes.Recently, Bianconi (11Bianconi M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18709-18713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) found that the enthalpy for the reactions of yeast hexokinase varies depending on the isozymes used, and Szöke et al. (12Szöke A. Scott W.G. Hajdu J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 18-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in an elegant theoretical analysis proposed that enzyme could adjust the reaction path by altering the reversible interchange of different forms of energies (chemical, electrical, and mechanical). In these views, the same reaction catalyzed by different enzymes would lead to the release of different amounts of heat. In the report by Szöke et al. (12Szöke A. Scott W.G. Hajdu J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 18-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), it was proposed that the amount of heat produced during PPi hydrolysis by the soluble and membrane-bound PPases should be markedly different. The soluble PPase would convert ΔG into heat, whereas for the membrane-bound PPases, less heat should be released because part of the energy derived from PPi hydrolysis would be captured and used by the enzyme to pump protons across the membrane. In this report we measure the heat release during PPi hydrolysis using yeast-soluble inorganic PPase and the membrane-bound PPase of corn vacuoles. We found that indeed the amount of heat released during PPi hydrolysis varies depending on the enzyme used, but contrary to the proposal by Szöke et al. (12Szöke A. Scott W.G. Hajdu J.

The excitation wavelength was set at 415 nm, and the emission wavelength was set at 485 nm. The reaction was carried out in 2 ml of medium containing 10 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.5, 3 μm 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm PPi, and different KCl concentrations. FCCP was dissolved in ethanol. The amounts used were such that the ethanol concentration in the reaction mixture was never higher than 0.5% (v/v). At this concentration, ethanol had no effect on either the H+ gradient or PPi hydrolysis. Yeast inorganic PPase was lyophilized from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sigma catalog number I-1643, lot 74H 7045). PPase activity was measured colorimetrically by determining the rate of Pi liberation (20Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar).Heat of Reaction—This was measured using an OMEGA Isothermal Titration Calorimeter from Microcal, Inc. (Northampton, MA). The calorimeter sample cell (1.5 ml) was filled with reaction medium, and the reference cell was filled with Milli-Q water. After equilibration at 30 °C, the reaction was started by injecting either soluble yeast PPase or vacuolar vesicles into the sample cell, and the heat change was recorded for 30 min. The heat change measured during the initial 2 min after injection of the enzymes was discarded in order to avoid artifacts such as heat derived from the dilution of the enzyme in the reaction medium and binding of ions to the enzymes. The duration of these events is less than 1 min (1de Meis L. Bianconi M.L. Suzano V.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Reis M. Farage M. de Meis L. Mol.

J. 2003; 375: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Calorimetric enthalpy (ΔHcal) is calculated by dividing the amount of heat released by the amount of PPi hydrolyzed. The units used are moles for substrate hydrolyzed and kilocalories for heat released. Negative values indicate that the reaction is exothermic, and positive values indicate that it is endothermic. The enthalpy of buffer protonation (ΔHp) was measured at 30 °C by measuring the heat released following the addition of known amounts of HCl to the assay medium, and the value found was –3.8 kcal/mol (9de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41856-41861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Experimental Procedure—All experiments were performed at 30 °C. In a typical experiment, the assay media were divided in two samples, which were used for the simultaneous measurement of PPi hydrolysis and heat release. The syringe of the calorimeter was filled with either a solution of yeast PPase or a suspension of corn vacuoles, and the temperature difference between the syringe and the reaction cell of the calorimeter was allowed to equilibrate, a process that usually took between 8 and 12 min. During equilibration, the enzymes used for measurements of PPi hydrolysis were kept at the same temperature, length of time, and protein dilution as the enzymes kept in the calorimeter syringe. These different measurements were started simultaneously with enzymes to a final concentration of either 40.0 μg/ml for the corn vacuolar PPase and 0.2 μg/ml for yeast PPase.RESULTSKinetics Properties—Plants, protozoa, and photosynthetic bacteria have a membrane-bound PPase, which is able to use the chemical energy derived from PPi cleavage to pump H+ across the membrane (16Façanha A.R. de Meis L.

Potassium activates the hydrolysis of PPi, and the K+ concentration needed for half-maximal activation varies depending on the organism used to isolate the vacuoles (16Façanha A.R. de Meis L.

With the maize root vacuoles used in this work, half-maximal activation of PPi hydrolysis (Fig. 1A) and half-maximal proton gradient formation (Fig. 1B) were obtained in the presence of 5–10 mm KCl (Fig. 1A). Contrasting with the vacuolar PPase, the soluble yeast PPase does not convert chemical energy into osmotic energy and is not activated by K+. The optimum pH of both vacuolar and yeast PPase is in the range of pH 7.0–8.0 (data not shown). Accordingly, all our experiments were performed at pH 7.5. The yeast PPase is inhibited by NaF (26Baykov A.A. Fabrichniy I.P. Pohjanjoki P. Zyryanov A.B. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11939-11947Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Pohjanjoki P.

As for the various membrane-bound PPases so far described, the vacuolar PPase is not inhibited by NaF (22Maeshima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, concentrations of NaF higher than 1 mm were not used in order to avoid the formation of magnesium fluoride complexes and the decrease of the free Mg2+ concentration in the medium. The specific activity of the vacuolar PPase varies depending on the plant species and tissue used. The values previously reported for corn roots (16Façanha A.R. de Meis L.

In this report, the activity among the various vacuoles preparations used varied between 0.05 and 0.11 μmol of PPi/mg·min–1. The specific activity of the purified soluble yeast PPase used was much higher than that of corn vacuoles and varied between 40 and 48 μmol of PPi/mg·min–1 (Fig. 1). In Refs. 22Maeshima M. Biochim.

Open table in a new tab Most surprisingly, when the hydrolysis was catalyzed by the vacuolar PPase, the heat released during the cleavage of each PPi molecule was significantly larger than that measured with yeast PPase (Table I). As far as we know, the ΔHcal for PPi hydrolysis has not been measured previously using a vacuolar PPase as catalyst. Different from the yeast PPase, with the vacuolar PPase the heat released during PPi varied depending on the K+ concentration in the medium (Figs. 3 and 5 and Table I). In the presence of a gradient and 5 mm KCl, the heat released was 22.8 kcal/mol PPi and decreased to 9.7 kcal/mol PPi as the K+ concentration in the medium was raised from 5 to 100 mm.The proton ionophore FCCP impairs the formation of a H+ gradient (Fig. 1) and enhances the vacuolar PPase activity (Fig. 6), indicating that the accumulation of H+ in the vesicle lumen partially inhibits the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme. A similar phenomenon was previously observed with SERCA and is referred to as “back inhibition” (4de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). At all K+ concentrations tested, the heat released for each PPi molecule cleaved in the presence of a gradient was larger than that measured in the presence of FCCP (Fig. 6 and Table I).Fig. 6Effect of H+-gradient on the rates of PPi and heat release by corn vacuoles. The assay medium composition was 50 mm MOPS-Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 0.3 mm PPi, 0.6 mm MgCl2, and 5mm KCl in the presence (•) or absence (○) of 5 μm FCCP. A, PPase activity; B, heat release; C, values of A and B were plotted as heat released versus PPi cleaved.

On the basis of the theoretical analysis by Szöke et al. (12Szöke A. Scott W.G. Hajdu J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 18-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the finding that the vacuolar PPase released more heat per mol of PPi hydrolyzed than the soluble yeast PPase appears to be paradoxical. However, when compared with the SERCA (5Reis M. Farage M. Souza A.C. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42793-42800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 6de Meis L. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 41856-41861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the data indicate that the vacuolar PPase can cleave PPi through two different catalytic routes with different caloric yields, and the choice between the two routes varies depending on the KCl concentration in the medium and on whether or not a H+ gradient is formed across the vesicle membranes.Energy of Hydrolysis of Phosphate Compounds during Catalysis—A common feature of different enzymes involved in energy transduction is that during catalysis there is a significant decrease of the substrate energy level that takes place at the catalytic site before its cleavage (Table II). In these enzymes, work is performed during the decrease of the energy level of the phosphate compound. Data obtained in different laboratories indicate that the conversion of the phosphate compound from high to low energy is promoted by a change of water activity at the catalytic site of the enzyme, and this decrease can be explained by the solvation energy theory (33de Meis L.

In leaky vesicles (no gradient) practically all the ATPase activity measured is coupled with the translocation of Ca2+ across the membrane.

Na,K-ATPase, also called the sodium pump, is a heterodimeric protein consisting of α- and β-subunits. It pumps 3 Na+ out of the cell and 2 K+ into the cell during each transport cycle at the expense of ATP hydrolysis, and this activity maintains transmembrane gradients of the ions. Na,K-ATPase belongs to the P-type ATPase family in which the mechanism of action involves formation of a transient, covalently phosphorylated intermediate during the reaction cycle. Other P-type ATPases include sarcoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane Ca-ATPase, H,K-ATPase found in stomach and colon, and several prokaryotic transport enzymes (1Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M.

Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 14Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), the parts of the polypeptide that are exposed in the cytoplasm are organized into three interacting domains designated A, N, and P. The P (phosphorylation) domain is composed of the intracellular loop between TM4 and TM5, with the N-terminal part (roughly Asn330–Asn359) connecting to TM4, and the C-terminal part (roughly Lys605–Asp737) connecting to TM5. The aspartate residue (Asp351) that accepts the γ-phosphate from ATP during ATP hydrolysis is situated in the C-terminal end of the central β-strand of domain P. The N (nucleotide binding) domain is inserted between the two parts of the P domain (roughly Gln360–Arg 604). The A (anchor) domain is composed of the N terminus of the polypeptide and the loop between TM2 and TM3. It undergoes large conformational changes during the transport cycle. The cytoplasmic loop between TM6 and TM7 (L6/7, Phe809–Ser830) wraps around TM5 and is close to the P domain and the transmembrane domain. The function of L6/7 has been investigated extensively in Ca-ATPase and is controversial. Falson and co-workers and Menguy and co-workers (15Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. Deschamps S. Moller J.V.

They proposed that L6/7 serves as an initial cation binding site in Ca-ATPase. Zhang et al. (18Zhang Z. Lewis D. Sumbilla C. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8758-8767Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) reported that mutations in L6/7 reduced enzyme phosphorylation from both ATP and Pi, and several aspartate to asparagine mutations (D813N/D815N/D818N) also reduced Ca2+ affinity. They proposed that the effect of the mutations on Ca2+ affinity was probably because mutations in L6/7 influenced the correct positioning of TM6, and that L6/7 was important in stabilizing the phosphorylation domain and the cation binding domain in Ca-ATPase. In the Ca-ATPase crystal structure, L6/7 is close to the P domain and the transmembrane domain, in a good position to mediate communication between the phosphorylation site and the cation binding site, and Toyoshima et al. (13Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar) suggested that L6/7 may function as a coordinator between these sites. In the Na,K-ATPase, Shainskaya et al. (20Shainskaya A. Schneeberger A. Apell H.-J. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2019-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) measured the effects of chymotrypsin digestion of L6/7 on the release of a TM5/TM6 fragment from the membrane and on Rb+ occlusion. Release of the fragment was prevented by occluded monovalent cations or by the competitive antagonists Ca2+, Mg2+, La3+, p-xylylene bisguanidinium (pXBG2+), m-xylylene bisguanidinium (mXBG2+), 1-bromo-2,4,6 tris(methylisothiouronium)benzene (Br-TITU3+), and 1,3-dibromo-2,4,6-tris (methylisothiouronium)benzene (Br2-TITU3+). They proposed that L6/7 of Na,K-ATPase serves as an initial binding site for the monovalent cations and the cation antagonists, but that only the monovalent cations subsequently become occluded. In the experiments reported here, mutations to L6/7 amino acids were found to have only small effects on the apparent affinity of the Na,K-ATPase for the transported cations, and failed to prevent the binding of Br-TITU3+ to the enzyme. These results are most easily understood if the binding of transported cations and cation antagonists occurs to sites on Na,K-ATPase outside of L6/7. All enzymes used for molecular cloning were obtained from New England Biolabs or Roche Applied Sciences and were used as recommended by the suppliers. Pfu polymerase was obtained from Stratagene. Ouabain was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and the concentration of ouabain in solution was determined by spectrophotometry (21Wallick E.T. Schwartz A.

Phosphate Concentration Dependence of the Mg2+and Pi-dependent Ouabain Binding—The apparent affinity of the Na,K-ATPase for Pi was measured by equilibrium Pi- and Mg2+-dependent ouabain binding in 20 nm [3H] ouabain, 4 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) with 0–10 mm Pi. Data were fitted to a rectangular hyperbola to obtain the K0.5 for Pi. 18O Oxygen Exchange Measurements—18O exchange between Pi and water was measured as previously described (25Farley R.A. Elquza E.

The exchange rate and the partition coefficient (Pc) were estimated from the isotopomer distribution at a single time point by non-linear least squares. Parameters relating exchange to metal cofactor and substrate binding and to the equilibrium between non-covalently and covalently bound Pi were estimated by globally fitting the rate equation for ordered binding of Mg2+ before Pi to plots of the exchange rate as a function of both Mg2+ and Pi concentration (25Farley R.A.

Heat Inactivation of Ouabain Binding—1 mg of crude yeast membrane protein was suspended in 0.4 ml of 25 mm imidazole/HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) and was heated at 50 °C for 90 s. The ouabain binding capacity of the sample was measured at 37° after heating and was compared with that of the control sample without heating. The experiments were done in triplicate. Steady-state Phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP—Steady-state phosphoenzyme formation was carried out in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was initiated by adding the [γ-32P]ATP, and was continued for 10 s before being quenched by 0.8 ml of 1 m H3PO4 (pH 2.4). After quenching, the tubes were immersed in ice for 10 min. After adding 100 μg of bovine serum albumin, the samples were pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed three times by centrifugation with 1.1 ml of cold washing buffer (0.25 m H3PO4, pH 2.4), once with 1.1 ml of cold distilled water, and were dissolved in 35 μl of sample loading buffer (prepared by adding 0.2 ml of 50% glycerol containing 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue and 10 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol to 0.8 ml of 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1% SDS) (18Zhang Z. Lewis D. Sumbilla C. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15232-15239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The entire sample was applied to a 4% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, pH 6.2 (18Zhang Z. Lewis D. Sumbilla C. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15232-15239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After running the gel at 100 mA for 3 h at 4 °C, the gels were dried overnight in a fume hood. Radioactive phosphoenzyme was detected by autoradiography, and the quantitation of the phosphoenzyme specific to Na,K-ATPase was obtained by liquid scintillation counting of slices corresponding to the α-subunit bands of the dried gel. Reactions carried out with 100 mm KCl replacing NaCl served as control for background phosphorylation. Time course of E2P → E2 Dephosphorylation—Phosphorylation at low concentration of Na+ in the absence of added K+ will accumulate E2P (28Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The time course of E2P → E2 can be obtained by measuring the disappearance of the phosphoenzyme after adding K+ to the enzyme (E + Na+1 + ATP [lrarr2] E1P [lrarr2] E2P + K+ [lrarr2] E2). Enzyme was phosphorylated in 50 μl of 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP on ice for 15 s. Dephosphorylation was initiated by adding 10 μl of a chase solution to give a final concentration of 0.1 mm KCl and 10 mm EDTA, followed by adding 100 μl of quench solution (2 m H3PO4, pH 2.4) at serial time points. The reaction was carried out in 2-ml tubes with magnetic stirring. After adding an additional 0.8 ml of 1 m H3PO4 (pH 2.4) containing 100 μg of bovine serum albumin, the reaction solutions were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min to pellet the protein. Reactions carried out in the presence of 20 mm KCl replacing NaCl served as control for background phosphorylation. Pellets were washed, proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis, and radioactive phosphoenzyme was quantified as described above. The data were fitted to a monoexponential equation: y = ae-kt + y0, where y is the amount of phosphorylated Na,K-ATPase, a is the maximum phosphorylation, y0 is phosphoenzyme present at long times, k is the rate constant, and t is the chase time. Ouabain-sensitive K+-stimulated Phosphatase Activity using p-Nitrophenylphosphate (PNPP) as Substrate—The assay was carried out in duplicate in a total volume of 1 ml of 20 mm HEPES/triethylamine (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm EDTA, 25 mm KCl, 50 μm dithiothreitol, 2 mmp-nitrophenylphosphate, plus or minus 0.1 mm ouabain. The reaction was started by adding 100 μg of SDS-extracted yeast membrane protein to each tube at 30-s intervals. After a brief vortex, the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 2 ml of 1 n NaOH. After brief centrifugation, the absorbance at 410 nm was measured for the clear supernatants. The ouabain-sensitive K+-stimulated phosphatase activity was calculated as the rate of p-nitrophenylphosphate hydrolysis in the absence of ouabain minus that in the presence of ouabain, normalized to the ouabain binding capacity of each sample. Western Blot—100 μg of SDS-extracted yeast membrane proteins were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. 100 ng of SDS-purified dog kidney Na,K-ATPase was used as positive control and membranes from non-transformed yeast served as a negative control. After electrophoresis samples were transferred to Immobilon P membranes and incubated with monoclonal antibody 5 (D. Fambrough, Johns Hopkins), which is specific for the α-subunit of Na,K-ATPase. Image detection was done using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. Calculations and Data Analysis—Origin and Microsoft Excel were used to analyze the data. Best fits for non-linear curve fitting are shown as lines in the figures, and the extracted parameters are given in the tables and figure legends. Standard deviations or standard errors are indicated for the means and for parameters extracted by non-linear curve fitting. Student's t test was used for most statistical analysis. Free Pi and Mg2+ concentrations were calculated using Winmaxc v2.00, www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html. Expression of Na,K-ATPase in Yeast—The amino acid sequences of L6/7 in human Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit and in rabbit sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase are shown in Fig. 1. The effects of alanine substitutions of charged residues, prolines, and conserved residues in L6/7 of the human Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit were examined after expression of the protein in yeast cells. As shown in Fig. 2, all mutants were detected in membranes prepared from transformed yeast cells, although the triple mutant E825A/E828A/D830A and the E825A, E828A, and M832A mutants were expressed at lower levels than wild type and most other mutants. All mutants except for the E825A/E828A/D830A mutant bound ouabain in an Mg2+- and Pi-dependent equilibrium ouabain binding assay. Unlike the other mutants and wild-type enzyme, the E825A and E828A mutants lost the ability to bind ouabain after SDS extraction of crude microsomal membranes. The ouabain binding capacity (Bmax) of the mutants in SDS-extracted yeast membranes varies, ranging from 3 to 29 pmol/mg protein (Table I). The dissociation constant for ouabain (Kd) for most mutants was similar to the wild-type value, ranging from 9 to 31 nm, except for R837A, which had a Kd of 218 nm, 12-fold higher than that of wild-type Na,K-ATPase, and for R837K, which had a Kd of 66 nm, a 3.6-fold increase.Fig. 2Expression of L6/7 mutants of Na,K-ATPase in yeast membranes.

Open table in a new tab Effects of Mutations on Na,K-ATPase Activity—The ouabain sensitive Na,K-ATPase activity was measured on SDS extracted yeast membranes. Without SDS extraction the fraction of ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity is too small to be detected in the presence of endogenous yeast ATPase activity, and SDS extraction increases the fraction of ouabain sensitive ATPase activity in the membranes by inhibiting endogenous yeast ATPase activity. After SDS extraction the ouabain-sensitive fraction is usually 30–50% of total ATPase activity. The turnover number of wild type Na,K-ATPase expressed in yeast membranes was 3364 ± 124 min–1 (S.E.). The results shown in Table I express the turnover number of the mutants as a percentage of the wild-type value. R834A, R837A, and R848A had less than 50% of wild-type ATPase activity, whereas D830A, I831A, P836A, and P839A retained 60–80% of wild-type ATPase activity. The activities of K833A, K840A, D842A, and E847A were greater than 90% of the wild type, and the activities of both R837K and K843A were significantly greater than wild type. ATPase activity for E825A and E828A could not be measured because of their loss of ouabain binding after SDS extraction, and ATPase activity for M832A could not be accurately measured because of its low expression level. Effects of Mutations on Na+and K+Affinity of Na,K-ATPase—In the presence of saturating concentrations of ATP, the apparent affinity of E1 for Na+ can be measured by the Na+ dependence of ouabain binding (E1 + Na+ + Mg2+ + ATP [lrarr2] EP + ouabain [lrarr2] EP·ouabain). In this reaction, E binds to Na+1 with high affinity and is phosphorylated in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ to EP, which binds ouabain to form a stable EP·ouabain complex. In the presence of Mg2+ and Pi, the apparent affinity of E2 for K+ can be measured by K+ inhibition of ouabain binding (E2(2K) [lrarr2] K+ + E2 + Mg2+ + Pi [lrarr2] EP + ouabain [lrarr2] EP·ouabain). In this reaction, K+ binds to E2 and antagonizes ouabain binding by competing for E2 with Pi and phosphoenzyme formation. Na+ also inhibits Mg2+- and Pi-dependent ouabain binding (E1Na+ [lrarr2] Na+ + E1 [lrarr2] E2 + Mg2+ + Pi [lrarr2] EP + ouabain [lrarr2] EP·ouabain). Both the E1/E2 equilibrium and the affinity of E1 for Na+ affect the amount of EP formed from Pi in the presence of Mg2+ and Pi, and affect the amount of ouabain bound and the value of IC50 for Na+. Most mutations did not change the apparent affinity of the pump for Na+ or K+. For Na+-dependent ouabain binding (Fig. 3), the K0.5 value for Na+ ranged from 0.7–1.6 mm for wild-type and most mutants, which is close to the reported K0.5 values of 0.7 mm and 0.6 mm measured by Na+-dependent steady-state phosphoenzyme formation (11Pedersen P.A. Nielsen J.M. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17818-17827Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Nielsen J.M. Jorgensen P.L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The K0.5 values of E825A and R837A for Na+ were increased by 2–3-fold. For K+ inhibition of ouabain binding (Fig. 4), the IC50 for K+ of wild type and most mutants was 0.3–0.4 mm, consistent with the reported value of K0.5 of 0.31 mm (12Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Nielsen J.M. Jorgensen P.L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and 0.77 mm (29Crambert G. Hasler U. Beggah A.T. Yu C. Modyanov N.N. Horisberger J.-D. Lelievie L.

For Na+ inhibition of ouabain binding, the IC50 value of wild type for Na+ was 20 ± 1 mm (Fig. 5). The IC50 for Na+ inhibition of ouabain binding for most mutants was not different from wild type, but it was increased 1.5–3-fold for E825A, E828A, and R834A, and it was decreased 3-fold for R837A. The effects of E825A, E828A, and R837A on apparent cation affinity are summarized in Table II.Fig. 4KCl inhibition of ouabain binding. 0.5–1 mg of yeast microsomal membrane proteins were incubated with 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 20 nm [3H]ouabain, 4 mm H3PO4, 4 mm MgCl2, and various of KCl for 1 h at 37 °C.
