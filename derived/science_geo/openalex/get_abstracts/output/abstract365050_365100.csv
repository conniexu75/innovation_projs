https://openalex.org/W2001615843,"The origin of cooperation is a central challenge to our understanding of evolution. The fact that microbial interactions can be manipulated in ways that animal interactions cannot has led to a growing interest in microbial models of cooperation and competition. For the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to grow on sucrose, the disaccharide must first be hydrolysed by the enzyme invertase. This hydrolysis reaction is performed outside the cytoplasm in the periplasmic space between the plasma membrane and the cell wall. Here we demonstrate that the vast majority ( approximately 99 per cent) of the monosaccharides created by sucrose hydrolysis diffuse away before they can be imported into the cell, serving to make invertase production and secretion a cooperative behaviour. A mutant cheater strain that does not produce invertase is able to take advantage of and invade a population of wild-type cooperator cells. However, over a wide range of conditions, the wild-type cooperator can also invade a population of cheater cells. Therefore, we observe steady-state coexistence between the two strains in well-mixed culture resulting from the fact that rare strategies outperform common strategies-the defining features of what game theorists call the snowdrift game. A model of the cooperative interaction incorporating nonlinear benefits explains the origin of this coexistence. We are able to alter the outcome of the competition by varying either the cost of cooperation or the glucose concentration in the media. Finally, we note that glucose repression of invertase expression in wild-type cells produces a strategy that is optimal for the snowdrift game-wild-type cells cooperate only when competing against cheater cells."
https://openalex.org/W2081927805,"Although the classification of cell types often relies on the identification of cell surface proteins as differentiation markers, flow cytometry requires suitable antibodies and currently permits detection of only up to a dozen differentiation markers in a single measurement. We use multiplexed mass-spectrometric identification of several hundred N-linked glycosylation sites specifically from cell surface-exposed glycoproteins to phenotype cells without antibodies in an unbiased fashion and without a priori knowledge. We apply our cell surface-capturing (CSC) technology, which covalently labels extracellular glycan moieties on live cells, to the detection and relative quantitative comparison of the cell surface N-glycoproteomes of T and B cells, as well as to monitor changes in the abundance of cell surface N-glycoprotein markers during T-cell activation and the controlled differentiation of embryonic stem cells into the neural lineage. A snapshot view of the cell surface N-glycoproteins will enable detection of panels of N-glycoproteins as potential differentiation markers that are currently not accessible by other means."

https://openalex.org/W2055580813,"Loss-of-function mutations in the FLG (filaggrin) gene cause the semidominant keratinizing disorder ichthyosis vulgaris and convey major genetic risk for atopic dermatitis (eczema), eczema-associated asthma and other allergic phenotypes. Several low-frequency FLG null alleles occur in Europeans and Asians, with a cumulative frequency of approximately 9% in Europe. Here we report a 1-bp deletion mutation, 5303delA, analogous to common human FLG mutations, within the murine Flg gene in the spontaneous mouse mutant flaky tail (ft). We demonstrate that topical application of allergen to mice homozygous for this mutation results in cutaneous inflammatory infiltrates and enhanced cutaneous allergen priming with development of allergen-specific antibody responses. These data validate flaky tail as a useful model of filaggrin deficiency and provide experimental evidence for the hypothesis that antigen transfer through a defective epidermal barrier is a key mechanism underlying elevated IgE sensitization and initiation of cutaneous inflammation in humans with filaggrin-related atopic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2164693027,"Innate social behaviours emerge from neuronal circuits that interpret sensory information on the basis of an individual's own genotype, sex and experience. The regulated aggregation behaviour of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a simple animal with only 302 neurons, is an attractive system to analyse these circuits. Wild social strains of C. elegans aggregate in the presence of specific sensory cues, but solitary strains do not. Here we identify the RMG inter/motor neuron as the hub of a regulated circuit that controls aggregation and related behaviours. RMG is the central site of action of the neuropeptide receptor gene npr-1, which distinguishes solitary strains (high npr-1 activity) from wild social strains (low npr-1 activity); high RMG activity is essential for all aspects of social behaviour. Anatomical gap junctions connect RMG to several classes of sensory neurons known to promote aggregation, and to ASK sensory neurons, which are implicated in male attraction to hermaphrodite pheromones. We find that ASK neurons respond directly to pheromones, and that high RMG activity enhances ASK responses in social strains, causing hermaphrodite attraction to pheromones at concentrations that repel solitary hermaphrodites. The coordination of social behaviours by RMG suggests an anatomical hub-and-spoke model for sensory integration in aggregation, and points to functions for related circuit motifs in the C. elegans wiring diagram."

https://openalex.org/W2108098152,"We present a yeast chemical-genomics approach designed to identify genes that when mutated confer drug resistance, thereby providing insight about the modes of action of compounds. We developed a molecular barcoded yeast open reading frame (MoBY-ORF) library in which each gene, controlled by its native promoter and terminator, is cloned into a centromere-based vector along with two unique oligonucleotide barcodes. The MoBY-ORF resource has numerous genetic and chemical-genetic applications, but here we focus on cloning wild-type versions of mutant drug-resistance genes using a complementation strategy and on simultaneously assaying the fitness of all transformants with barcode microarrays. The complementation cloning was validated by mutation detection using whole-genome yeast tiling microarrays, which identified unique polymorphisms associated with a drug-resistant mutant. We used the MoBY-ORF library to identify the genetic basis of several drug-resistant mutants and in this analysis discovered a new class of sterol-binding compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2033710792,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), oxidative stress is present early and contributes to disease pathogenesis. We previously reported that in Tg19959 transgenic AD mice, partial deficiency of the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) exacerbated amyloid pathology. We therefore asked whether MnSOD overexpression would prove beneficial against AD pathogenesis, by studying the offspring of Tg19959 mice crossed with MnSOD- overexpressing mice. At 4 mo of age, there was a 2- to 3-fold increase in MnSOD protein levels in Tg19959- MnSOD mice compared to Tg19959 littermates. Tg19959-MnSOD mice also had a 50% increase in catalase protein levels, a 50% decrease in levels of oxidized protein, and a 33% reduction in cortical plaque burden compared to Tg19959 littermates. Spatial memory was impaired and synaptophysin levels were decreased in Tg19959 mice compared to wild-type littermates, but memory and synaptophysin levels were restored to wild-type levels in Tg19959-MnSOD littermates. These benefits occurred without changes in sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble or formic acid-soluble Aβ pools or Aβ oligomers in Tg19959-MnSOD mice compared to Tg19959 littermates. These data demonstrate that facilitation of the mitochondrial antioxidant response improves resistance to Aβ, slows plaque formation or increases plaque degradation, and markedly attenuates the phenotype in a transgenic AD mouse model.— Dumont, M.,Wille, E., Stack, C., Calingasan, N.

https://openalex.org/W2062018774,"Humans are exposed to radiation through the environment and in medical settings. To deal with radiation-induced damage, cells mount complex responses that rely on changes in gene expression. These gene expression responses differ greatly between individuals and contribute to individual differences in response to radiation. Here we identify regulators that influence expression levels of radiation-responsive genes. We treated radiation-induced changes in gene expression as quantitative phenotypes, and conducted genetic linkage and association studies to map their regulators. For more than 1,200 of these phenotypes there was significant evidence of linkage to specific chromosomal regions. Nearly all of the regulators act in trans to influence the expression of their target genes; there are very few cis-acting regulators. Some of the trans-acting regulators are transcription factors, but others are genes that were not known to have a regulatory function in radiation response. These results have implications for our basic and clinical understanding of how human cells respond to radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2024575029,"Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, chronic interstitial lung disease that is unresponsive to current therapy and often leads to death. However, the rate of disease progression differs among patients. We hypothesized that comparing the gene expression profiles between patients with stable disease and those in which the disease progressed rapidly will lead to biomarker discovery and contribute to the understanding of disease pathogenesis. Methodology and Principal Findings To begin to address this hypothesis, we applied Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) to generate lung expression profiles from diagnostic surgical lung biopsies in 6 individuals with relatively stable (or slowly progressive) IPF and 6 individuals with progressive IPF (based on changes in DLCO and FVC over 12 months). Our results indicate that this comprehensive lung IPF SAGE transcriptome is distinct from normal lung tissue and other chronic lung diseases. To identify candidate markers of disease progression, we compared the IPF SAGE profiles in stable and progressive disease, and identified a set of 102 transcripts that were at least 5-fold up regulated and a set of 89 transcripts that were at least 5-fold down regulated in the progressive group (P-value≤0.05). The over expressed genes included surfactant protein A1, two members of the MAPK-EGR-1-HSP70 pathway that regulate cigarette-smoke induced inflammation, and Plunc (palate, lung and nasal epithelium associated), a gene not previously implicated in IPF. Interestingly, 26 of the up regulated genes are also increased in lung adenocarcinomas and have low or no expression in normal lung tissue. More importantly, we defined a SAGE molecular expression signature of 134 transcripts that sufficiently distinguished relatively stable from progressive IPF. Conclusions These findings indicate that molecular signatures from lung parenchyma at the time of diagnosis could prove helpful in predicting the likelihood of disease progression or possibly understanding the biological activity of IPF."
https://openalex.org/W2853874477,"The versatility of Ca2+ signals derives from their spatio-temporal organization. For Ca2+ signals initiated by inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), this requires local interactions between InsP3 receptors (InsP3Rs) mediated by their rapid stimulation and slower inhibition\ by cytosolic Ca2+. This allows hierarchical recruitment of Ca2+ release events as the InsP3 concentration increases. Single InsP3Rs respond first, then clustered InsP3Rs open together giving a local 'Ca2+ puff', and as puffs become more frequent they ignite regenerative Ca2+ waves. Using nuclear patch-clamp recording, here we demonstrate that InsP3Rs are initially randomly distributed with an estimated separation of 1 m. Low concentrations of InsP3 cause InsP3Rs to aggregate rapidly and reversibly into small clusters of about four closely associated InsP3Rs. At resting cytosolic [Ca2+], clustered InsP3Rs open independently, but with lower open probability, shorter open time, and less InsP3 sensitivity than lone InsP3Rs. Increasing cytosolic [Ca2+] reverses the inhibition caused by clustering, InsP3R gating becomes coupled, and the duration of multiple openings is prolonged. Clustering both exposes InsP3Rs to local Ca2+ rises and increases the effects of Ca2+. Dynamic regulation of clustering by InsP3 retunes InsP3R sensitivity to InsP3 and Ca2+, facilitating hierarchical recruitment of the elementary events that underlie all InsP3-evoked Ca2+ signals."
https://openalex.org/W2095026873,"The binding of Bcl-2 to Beclin-1 reduces Beclin-1's capacity to induce autophagy. Here, we have tested whether the interaction is reciprocated by loss of Bcl-2's anti-apoptotic function. We targeted Bcl-2 to mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induced apoptosis using several apoptotic stimuli that initiate ER and/or mitochondrial signaling pathways (UV radiation, TNF and cycloheximide, staurosporine, thapsigargin and tunicamycin). When Beclin-1 and Bcl-2 were expressed together in HeLa cells, Beclin-1 (but not Beclin-1 lacking the Bcl-2-binding domain) followed Bcl-2 to the appropriate organelle with complete or near-complete overlap (comprising 60 and 30% of cells, respectively). The interaction between Beclin-1 and Bcl-2 was verified by immunoprecipitation, and a membrane-proximate localization of Beclin-1 was shown by immunoelectron microscopy. Apoptosis was followed by measuring changes in nuclear morphology, caspase-3 activity, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage or punctation of mRFP-Bax on mitochondria. Binding of Beclin-1 to Bcl-2 did not modify apoptosis irrespective of Bcl-2 concentration, location or apoptotic stimulus. A similar result was obtained in Atg5−/− cells that are autophagy-deficient, arguing against compensation for the loss of protection by Bcl-2 by autophagy-mediated survival induced by Beclin-1. Hence, although Beclin-1 contains a BH3-only motif typical of pro-apoptotic proteins, it is a negligible modulator of Bcl-2's anti-apoptotic function."

Relevant amino acid sequences of these recombinant peptides are listed in supplemental Table S2. Domain structures of fibrillin-1 recombinant polypeptides are shown schematically in Fig. 1A. All fibrillin-1 recombinant polypeptides were harvested from the media of stably transfected 293/EBNA cells and were purified using chelating chromatography, followed by molecular sieve chromatography, as we have described previously (9Isogai Z.

For construction of rF68 (EGF1-2-2: substitution of EGF3 with EGF2 within the context of rF23), both rF23 and an intermediate construct, rF67, were used as PCR templates. To construct rF67 (deletion of EGF3 within the context of rF23), the rF23 expression construct was used as a template for PCR, using primers pCEP-5′ and JE2-H1-AS, which together generated a NheI-BbsI fragment. Additionally, primers JH1-S and pCEP-3′ were used to generate a BbsI-XhoI fragment. Finally, a NheI-XhoI-restricted pCEPSP expression vector was ligated with the NheI-BbsI-restricted PCR product and the BbsI-XhoI PCR product to generate pCEPSP-rF67. To continue with construction of rF68, pCEPSP-rF23 was used as a template to generate a NheI-BsmBI PCR product using primers pCEP-5′ and JE2-E2-AS. Primers JE2-S and pCEP-3′ were used to make a BsmBI-XhoI PCR product. Finally, a NheI-XhoI restricted pCEPSP expression vector was ligated with the NheI-BmsBI-restricted PCR product and the BsmBI-XhoI-restricted PCR product to yield pCEPSP-rF68. For construction of rF79 (EGF1-2-1: substitution of EGF3 with EGF1 within the context of rF23), an intermediate construct, rF69, was used as a PCR template. To generate rF69, primers JE1S and JE1-H1-AS were used along with the rF23-pCEPSP expression construct as template to generate an XbaI/BsmBI-BbsI PCR product. Similarly, primers JH1-S and pCEP3′ were used along with the pCEPSP-rF23 expression construct as template to generate a BbsI-XhoI PCR product. Finally, a XbaI-XhoI-restricted pBluescript II SK(+) cloning vector was ligated with the XbaI/BsmBI-BbsI PCR product and the BbsI-XhoI PCR product to yield pBluescript II-rF69. Next, a third PCR product was generated with primer pCEP-5′ and JE2-E1-AS with pCEPSP-rF23 as template to generate a NheI-BsmBI product. Then the NheI-BsmBI-restricted fragment was ligated with the BsmBI-XhoI-restricted pBluescript-rF69 fragment and a NheI-XhoI restricted pCEPSP vector to yield pCEPSP-rF69. Then to create rF79 (revision of rF69 to juxtapose exon boundaries exactly), two initial PCR products were made using pCEPSP-rF69 as template. Primers pCEP-5′ and rF79AS generated one product, and primers rF79S and pCEP-3′ generated the other product. Equimolar amounts of the two products were mixed to generate a third product by overlap extension PCR, which was then restricted with NheI-XhoI and cloned into the pCEPSP expression vector to generate pCEPSP-rF79. For construction of rF80 (deletion of Hybrid1), pCEPSP-rF23 was used as a template along with primers pCEP-5′ and JE3-cb1-AS to generate a NheI-BbsI PCR product. Another PCR product used primers Jcb1-S and pCEP-3′ with template pCEPSP-rF23 to yield a BbsI-XhoI product. The two PCR-restricted products were ligated with the NheI-XhoI-restricted pCEPSP expression vector to yield pCEPSP-rF80. For construction of rF23mut1 (EGF3 N164S within the context of rF23), primers pCEP-5′ and N164SmutAS were used with template pCEPSP-rF23 to generate one PCR product. Primers N164SmutS and pCEP-3′ were used with template pCEPSP-rF23 to generate another PCR product. The two PCR products were then mixed in equimolar amounts to generate a product by overlap extension PCR, which was then restricted with NheI and XhoI. The digested product was then cloned into the pCEPSP expression vector to yield pCEPSP-rF23mut1. Recombinant LTBP-1K and LTBP-4K were previously described (9Isogai Z. Ono R.N. Ushiro S. Keene D.R.

For this study, we generated polyclonal antibodies in rabbits using recombinant LTBP-1C (pAb 8579) and recombinant LTBP-4K (pAb 2101). New Zealand White rabbits were immunized several times with 100 μg of immunogen emulsified in an equal volume of TiterMax Gold adjuvant (Sigma) and injected subcutaneously in several sites. These LTBP antisera demonstrated minimal cross-reactivity with the other recombinant polypeptide in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (supplemental Fig. S1) or in Western blotting (data not shown). Lack of cross-reactivity was also indicated by immunofluorescence of tissues (Fig. 4). Monoclonal anti-fibronectin (monoclonal antibody 84) was produced and characterized in our laboratory (data not shown). Binding analyses were performed using a BIAcoreX instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Recombinant LTBP-1 (rL1K), LTBP-4 (rL4K), full-length fibulin-2, -4, or -5 peptides were covalently coupled to CM5 sensor chips (research grade) using the amine coupling kit following the manufacturer's instructions (BIAcore AB). Resonance units coupled to the chips were 638 and 1455 resonance units for rL1K; 630 for rL4K, 3400 for fibulin-2; 2700 for fibulin-4; and 1225 for fibulin-5. Binding responses due to analyte interaction with the surface coupled ligand were normalized by subtraction of background binding to uncoupled control flow cells. Binding assays were performed at 25 °C in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) P20 surfactant (HBS-EP buffer, BIAcore AB). Fibrillin peptides were diluted in HBS-EP buffer and then injected at different concentrations and at constant flow rates over immobilized LTBP peptides. For competition assays, the fibrillin peptide, rF23 (at a constant concentration of 80 nm), was preincubated with the competitor LTBP peptide, rL1K, at concentrations of 50–800 nm for ∼1 h prior to injection. To account for variations of the fibrillin signal due to buffer changes caused by the addition of different amounts of competitor, we generated a buffer-matched control without competitor in which the maximum response was set in each case as the 100% reference signal. The surface was regenerated with a pulse of 10 mm glycine, pH 1.7. Kinetic constants were calculated by nonlinear fitting (1:1 interaction model with mass transfer) to the association and dissociation curves according to the manufacturer's instructions (BIAevaluation 3.0 software). Apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were then calculated as the ratio of kd/ka. Fibroblasts were derived from explant cultures of neonatal skin obtained from Fbn1 (31Carta L. Pereira L.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (MediaTech, Hendon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) and penicillin/streptomycin (MediaTech). 1 × 105 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin were plated onto 4-well permanox Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY) and were grown for 4, 9, or 13 days. Slides were fixed in cold methanol for 10 min and incubated in primary antibody for 3 h at room temperature. All of the primary antibodies were diluted 1:200 in PBS. Secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG, or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen), were diluted 1:1000 in PBS and incubated on the sections for 30 min at room temperature. Slides were coverslipped with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen). Tissues were snap frozen in isopentanes and were then embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Four-μm cryosections were cut using a Leica CM1850 cryostat. Sections were air dried overnight at room temperature and were then fixed for 10 min in cold acetone and incubated in primary antibodies diluted 1:200 in PBS for 3 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber. After washing in PBS, sections were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody diluted 1:1000 in PBS. The sections were washed thoroughly and coverslipped using ProLong Gold antifade reagent with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Slides were viewed on a Zeiss AxioVert 200 microscope, and micrographs were recorded digitally using AxioVision software (version 4.5). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and Western blotting were performed as previously described (16Isogai Z. Aspberg A. Keene D.R. Ono R.N. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol.

Total RNA preparations from mutant and wild type cells were generated by pipetting 1 ml of TRIzolTM reagent (Invitrogen) onto each well following the manufacturer's protocol and subsequent sample purification using the RNeasyTM kit (Qiagen). RNA samples were quantified by photospectrometry and 0.5 μg of RNA per sample was reverse transcribed using the Bio-Rad iScriptTM cDNA synthesis kit. Samples in triplicate were amplified using the iTaqTM SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in an iQTM5 Multicolor Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Analysis of data were performed using the 2−ΔΔCt method (33Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116613) Google Scholar) and quantitated relative to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene. Gene expression was normalized to wild type cell lines, which provided an arbitrary constant for comparative fold-expression. Recombinant fibrillin-1 polypeptides rF23, rF23mut1, rF68, and rF79 were dialyzed into 10 mm NaPO4, 100 mm sodium fluoride, pH 7.4. Samples were analyzed in a 0.1-mm cell at 25 °C, with CD measurements taken from 260 to 190 nm using a Jasco J-500A instrument. Concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Dermal fibroblasts established from neonatal wild type, fibrillin-1 (Fbn1) null, and fibrillin-2 (Fbn2) null mice were examined by immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and quantitative real-time PCR, to determine the status of LTBPs in the absence of fibrillin-1. Fibroblasts were tested by immunofluorescence after 4, 9, and 13 days in culture. Wild type extracellular matrix contained fibrillin-1 positive microfibrils (Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescence staining with antibodies specific for LTBP-1 or LTBP-4 demonstrated matrix incorporation of both LTBPs in wild type cultures grown for 9 days (Fig. 2, B and C). Fbn1 null fibroblasts demonstrated no fibrillin-1 staining and were also negative for fibrillin-2 staining, consistent with low expression levels of Fbn2 (data not shown). No matrix incorporation of LTBP-1 or LTBP-4 was found in Fbn1 null cultures, even after 13 days in culture (Fig. 2, E and F). Fbn1 null fibroblasts did, however, assemble a matrix containing fibronectin (Fig. 2D). In contrast, Fbn2 null cultures grown for 9 days elaborated an extensive fibrillin-1 containing matrix (Fig. 2G), in which both LTBPs were assembled (Fig. 2, H and I), just like the wild type cultures. 4-Day cultures yielded similar results, except that matrix incorporation of LTBP-4 appeared less abundant (data not shown). Western blots of Fbn1 null cultures demonstrated that LTBPs were secreted into the medium (Fig. 3A), even though LTBP proteins were not incorporated into the Fbn1 null extracellular matrix (Fig. 2, E and F). To quantitate the relative levels of LTBPs in wild type, Fbn1 null, and Fbn2 null cultures, quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed. Results showed similar expression levels of LTBP-1 and LTBP-4 in Fbn1 and Fbn2 null cultures (Fig. 3B). Because LTBPs were easily detected in the Fbn2 null matrix by immunofluorescence, lack of matrix incorporation of LTBPs in the Fbn1 null fibroblasts is likely not due to reduced expression levels of LTBPs in the Fbn1 null cells. Early postnatal tissues were also examined to determine whether LTBPs are present in matrices devoid of fibrillin-1. In tissues containing fibrillin-1 (that is, in wild type as well as in Fbn2 null tissues), LTBP-4 antibodies stained the matrix in tissue-specific fibrillar patterns, similar to fibrillin staining patterns. LTBP-4 was detected in fibrillar patterns in the dermis of wild type and Fbn2 null (Fig. 4A) mice and in wild type perichondrium (Fig. 4B). In Fbn1 null skin (Fig. 4A) and Fbn1 null perichondrium (Fig. 4B), fibrillin-2 antibody staining patterns were abundant and fibrillar, similar to fibrillin-1 staining patterns in wild type tissues (data not shown). Fibrillin-2 staining was used to identify fibrillar bundles of microfibrils in Fbn1 null tissues. Although LTBP-4 antibodies stained a subset of fibrillin microfibrils, the fibrillar staining patterns were similar to fibrillin. In contrast, LTBP-1 was apparent at the dermal-epidermal junction in skin, but was not present in dermal elastic fibers (data not shown), indicating that LTBP-1 is also associated with a subset of fibrillin microfibrils. LTBP-1 was detected in fibrillar patterns, similar to fibrillin, in the perichondrium and tendon (Fig. 4B). We previously used double immunostaining as well as immunoelectron microscopy to demonstrate colocalization of LTBP-1 and fibrillin-1 in human perichondrium/tendon (9Isogai Z. Ono R.N. Ushiro S.

Here we investigate whether the mobility of small fluorescent proteins is affected by the chromatin density. Diffusion of inert fluorescent proteins was studied in living cell nuclei using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) with a two-color confocal scanning detection system. We first present experiments exposing FCS-specific artifacts encountered in live cell studies as well as strategies to prevent them, in particular those arising from the choice of the fluorophore used for calibration of the focal volume, as well as temperature and acquisition conditions used for fluorescence fluctuation measurements. After defining the best acquisition conditions, we show for various human cell lines that the mobility of GFP varies significantly within the cell nucleus, but does not correlate with chromatin density. The intranuclear diffusional mobility strongly depends on protein size: in a series of GFP-oligomers, used as free inert fluorescent tracers, the diffusion coefficient decreased from the monomer to the tetramer much more than expected for molecules free in aqueous solution. Still, the entire intranuclear chromatin network is freely accessible for small proteins up to the size of eGFP-tetramers, regardless of the chromatin density or cell line. Even the densest chromatin regions do not exclude free eGFP-monomers or multimers."

This suggests that the inhibition of itch by scratching is state-dependent in the spinal cord. Itch is relieved by scratching, but the neural mechanisms that are responsible for this are unknown. Spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons respond to itch-producing agents and transmit pruritic information to the brain. We observed that scratching the cutaneous receptive field of primate STT neurons produced inhibition during histamine-evoked activity but not during spontaneous activity or activity evoked by a painful stimulus, suggesting that scratching inhibits the transmission of itch in the spinal cord in a state-dependent manner."

https://openalex.org/W2103233885,"This study shows that chronic amphetamine exposure in rats downregulates the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit on striatal neurons. This loss of NR2B has consequences for synaptic transmission and for behavior, sensitizing the rats to the stimulant. Plastic changes in glutamatergic synapses that lead to endurance of drug craving and addiction are poorly understood. We examined the turnover and trafficking of NMDA receptors and found that chronic exposure to the psychostimulant amphetamine (AMPH) induced selective downregulation of NMDA receptor NR2B subunits in the confined surface membrane pool of rat striatal neurons at synaptic sites. This downregulation was a long-lived event and was a result of the destabilization of surface-expressed NR2B caused by accelerated ubiquitination and degradation of crucial NR2B-anchoring proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The biochemical loss of synaptic NR2B further translated to the modulation of synaptic plasticity in the form of long-term depression at cortico-accumbal glutamatergic synapses. Behaviorally, genetic disruption of NR2B induced and restoration of NR2B loss prevented behavioral sensitization to AMPH. Our data identify NR2B as an important regulator in the remodeling of excitatory synapses and persistent psychomotor plasticity in response to AMPH."
https://openalex.org/W2017241556,"Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process that develops in individuals with known risk factors that include hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, influenced by diet. However, the interplay between diet, inflammatory mechanisms and vascular risk factors requires further research. We hypothesised that interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling in the vessel wall would raise arterial blood pressure and promote atheroma.Apoe(-/-) and Apoe(-/-)/IL-1R1(-/-) mice were fed high fat diets for 8 weeks, and their blood pressure and atherosclerosis development measured. Apoe(-/-)/IL-R1(-/-) mice had a reduced blood pressure and significantly less atheroma than Apoe(-/-) mice. Selective loss of IL-1 signaling in the vessel wall by bone marrow transplantation also reduced plaque burden (p < 0.05). This was associated with an IL-1 mediated loss of endothelium-dependent relaxation and an increase in vessel wall Nox 4. Inhibition of IL-1 restored endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and reduced levels of arterial oxidative stress.The IL-1 cytokine system links atherogenic environmental stimuli with arterial inflammation, oxidative stress, increased blood pressure and atherosclerosis. This is the first demonstration that inhibition of a single cytokine can block the rise in blood pressure in response to an environmental stimulus. IL-1 inhibition may have profound beneficial effects on atherogenesis in man."
https://openalex.org/W2001832472,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as a fuel-sensing enzyme that is activated by binding of AMP and subsequent phophorylation by upstream kinases such as the tumor suppressor LKB1, when cells sense an increase in the ratio of AMP to ATP. Acute activation of AMPK stimulates fatty acid oxidation to generate more ATP and simultaneously inhibits ATP-consuming processes including fatty acid and protein syntheses, thereby preserving energy for acute cell-surviving program, whereas chronic activation leads to inhibition of cell growth. The goal of the present study is to explore the mechanisms by which AMPK regulates cell growth. Toward this end, we established stable cell lines by introducing a dominant-negative mutant of AMPK α1 subunit or its shRNA into the prostate cancer C4-2 cells and other cells, or wild type LKB1 into the lung adenocarcinoma A549 and breast MB-MDA-231 cancer cells, both of which lack functional LKB1. Our results showed that the inhibition of AMPK accelerated cell proliferation and promoted malignant behavior such as increased cell migration and anchorage-independent growth. This was associated with decreased G1 population, downregulation of p53 and p21, and upregulation of S6K, IGF-1 and IGF1R. Conversely, treatment of the C4-2 cells with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-D-ribonucleoside (AICAR), a prototypical AMPK activator, caused opposite changes. In addition, our study using microarray and RT–PCR revealed that AMPK regulated gene expression involved in tumor cell growth and survival. Thus, our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of AMPK action in cancer cells and presents AMPK as an ideal drug target for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1972002559,"HIF-1alpha is overexpressed in many human cancers compared to normal tissues due to the interaction of a multiplicity of factors and pathways that reflect specific genetic alterations and extracellular stimuli. We developed two HIF-1alpha chimeric reporter systems, HIF-1alpha/FLuc and HIF-1alpha(DeltaODDD)/FLuc, to investigate the tightly controlled level of HIF-1alpha protein in normal (NIH3T3 and HEK293) and glioma (U87) cells. These reporter systems provided an opportunity to investigate the degradation of HIF-1alpha in different cell lines, both in culture and in xenografts. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed different patterns of subcellular localization of HIF-1alpha/FLuc fusion protein between normal cells and cancer cells; similar differences were observed for HIF-1alpha in non-transduced, wild-type cells. A dynamic cytoplasmic-nuclear exchange of the fusion protein and HIF-1alpha was observed in NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells under different conditions (normoxia, CoCl2 treatment and hypoxia). In contrast, U87 cells showed a more persistent nuclear localization pattern that was less affected by different growing conditions. Employing a kinetic model for protein degradation, we were able to distinguish two components of HIF-1alpha/FLuc protein degradation and quantify the half-life of HIF-1alpha fusion proteins. The rapid clearance component (t(1/2) approximately 4-6 min) was abolished by the hypoxia-mimetic CoCl2 MG132 treatment and deletion of ODD domain, and reflects the oxygen/VHL-dependent degradation pathway. The slow clearance component (t(1/2) approximately 200 min) is consistent with other unidentified non-oxygen/VHL-dependent degradation pathways. Overall, the continuous bioluminescence readout of HIF-1alpha/FLuc stabilization in vitro and in vivo will facilitate the development and validation of therapeutics that affect the stability and accumulation of HIF-1alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2140841695,"Akt signaling has been implicated in a number of diseases, but its role in brain disorders is less clear. Here, the authors report that CTMP, an endogenous inhibitor of Akt, is critical in the neurodegeneration that is associated with stroke. Blockade of CTMP in a stroke model rescues hippocampal neurons. Dysregulation of Akt signaling is important in a broad range of diseases that includes cancer, diabetes and heart disease. The role of Akt signaling in brain disorders is less clear. We found that global ischemia in intact rats triggered expression and activation of the Akt inhibitor CTMP (carboxyl-terminal modulator protein) in vulnerable hippocampal neurons and that CTMP bound and extinguished Akt activity and was essential to ischemia-induced neuronal death. Although ischemia induced a marked phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Akt, phosphorylated Akt was not active in post-ischemic neurons, as assessed by kinase assays and phosphorylation of the downstream targets GSK-3β and FOXO3A. RNA interference–mediated depletion of CTMP in a clinically relevant model of stroke restored Akt activity and rescued hippocampal neurons. Our results indicate that CTMP is important in the neurodegeneration that is associated with stroke and identify CTMP as a therapeutic target for the amelioration of hippocampal injury and cognitive deficits."
https://openalex.org/W2059576320,"During development, elaborate patterns of cell differentiation and movement must occur in the correct locations and at the proper times. Developmental timing has been studied less than spatial pattern formation, and the mechanisms integrating the two are poorly understood. Border-cell migration in the Drosophila ovary occurs specifically at stage 9. Timing of the migration is regulated by the steroid hormone ecdysone, whereas spatial patterning of the migratory population requires localized activity of the JAK-STAT pathway. Ecdysone signalling is patterned spatially as well as temporally, although the mechanisms are not well understood. In stage 9 egg chambers, ecdysone signalling is highest in anterior follicle cells including the border cells. We identify the gene abrupt as a repressor of ecdysone signalling and border-cell migration. Abrupt protein is normally lost from border-cell nuclei during stage 9, in response to JAK-STAT activity. This contributes to the spatial pattern of the ecdysone response. Abrupt attenuates ecdysone signalling by means of a direct interaction with the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain of the P160 ecdysone receptor coactivator Taiman (Tai). Taken together, these findings provide a molecular mechanism by which spatial and temporal cues are integrated."
https://openalex.org/W2062840218,"The complex processes linking obesity to its deleterious health consequences are finally being unraveled. Inflammation is receiving increased attention for its potential role in the pathogenesis of disorders ranging from insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) to steatohepatitis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent back-to-back studies show that obesity perturbs inflammatory gene networks, and hint at causal relationships between inflammation and disease traits associated with the metabolic syndrome. Approaches used in these studies are distinct from classical genome-wide associational studies or tissue-specific mRNA expression profiling, as they rely on ‘neural networks’ and high-powered computational methods to interconnect genetic, genomic and environmental data into a ‘causal’ model.

Gene expression was assessed as a quantitative trait to predict which features of obesity promote disease. The first study revealed a tendency towards activation of an inflammation network in adipose tissue of Icelandic subjects with a higher body mass index1. Parallel results were found in the second study, which similarly analyzed adipose tissue and liver from obese and control mice2. A major strength of this approach is that individual state changes can be considered in the context of other changes occurring not only in the tissue being examined, but simultaneously in other tissues, and in the context of genetics, environmental determinants, and even over time. As a word of caution, however, these are early days in systems biology, and findings are limited by the quantity and accuracy of the data used to construct the networks.

The relatively unbiased approach used in these studies affirms a role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases. The approach should also provide new biomarkers for obesity and related metabolic diseases. An additional major promise of such systems biology approaches is in their application to drug discovery. The administration of a drug provides a single perturbation that should influence multiple components of the system. The approach should provide valuable information about mechanisms of action, not only for the drug’s beneficial effects but also for side effects that may limit utility. Identification of new biomarkers for assessing response to a drug should also provide avenues for personalized medicine, by tailoring interventions to an individual’s underlying disease mechanisms.

How do these new findings fit the larger, emerging picture of obesity-induced inflammation? Epidemiological evidence relating inflammation to T2D and obesity has existed since the 1950s3, but was not considered in terms of pathogenesis until the 1990s. The list of markers shown to be elevated in obesity includes white blood cell count and plasma concentrations of sialic acid, C-reactive protein (CRP), TNF-α, and IL-6, among other factors3,4, and the list continues to grow.

TNF-α was hypothesized to mediate obesity-induced inflammation, because it is produced in adipose tissue and neutralization in mice curbed insulin resistance5. However, TNF-α neutralization trials in humans were negative6, which dampened enthusiasm not only for TNF-α as a drug target in T2D, but for the ‘inflammation hypothesis’ of T2D. New discoveries continued to rekindle interest in this area of investigation despite these ongoing debates.

The discovery that obesity also activates intracellular pathways, including IKKβ/NF-κB and JNK7,8, added fuel to the inflammatory hypothesis. Upregulation of the IKKβ/NF-κB axis leads to the excess production of multiple potential mediators of inflammation, whereas JNK activation impinges on insulin signaling through phosphorylation of serine residues of IRS-1. Stimuli potentially activating both IKKβ/NF-κB and JNK in obesity can be separated into extracellular ligands, such as proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 or fatty acids binding to TLRs -- and intracellular stimuli such ER or oxidative stress and ceramides3. Determining which processes initiate obesity-induced inflammation is an active area of investigation.

The discovery of macrophages in obese adipose tissue was another milestone towards better understanding obesity-induced inflammation9,10. Macrophages appear to accumulate in obese fat in response to adipocyte stress and death, possibly due to insufficient angiogenesis and hypoxia. Although incompletely understood, the macrophages may participate in the development insulin resistance, T2D and CVD through production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other factors. Inhibition of NF-κB or JNK in macrophages improves insulin resistance11,12.

Importantly for patients with T2D or CVD, these recent discoveries promise potential new avenues for treatment. Despite the earlier failures with TNF-α blockers, it now appears that inflammation will provide viable therapeutic targets. Two approaches are already being validated in clinical trials, anti-inflammatory salicylates and IL-1 blockade. The salicylates are atypical members of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory class of drugs, which target NF-κB as opposed to the cyclooxygenase enzymes, Cox1 and Cox2. Salsalate, a salicylate prodrug, has been shown to have glucose lowering efficacy in small trials13, with larger TINSAL-T2D trials ongoing (www.TINSAL-T2D.org). The recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra, currently approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis, also improves glycemia in patients with T2D14. IL-1 blockade and salsalate are both likely to improve β cell function and insulin resistance, although anakinra reportedly targets β cells and salsalate effects have focused on insulin sensitivity13,14.

While it is too early to say whether salicylate or anakinra will go the distance, these approaches have already served to validate inflammation as a pharmacological target in T2D. Moreover, these approaches are vastly different from one another, as anakinra is an injected biological that binds extracellular IL-1 proteins, whereas salicylate (salsalate) is an orally active small molecule that acts in cells to inhibit transcription. This suggests that numerous nodes or points within inflammation networks may be targeted in diabetes - which is good news, as the therapeutic area of inflammation is rich in molecular targets that have already received great attention from the pharmaceutical industry.

Of course salsalate and anakinra target inflammation systemically, while potential targets identified by the back-to-back studies of Schadt and Stefansson and colleagues are restricted to adipose tissue. Unless the studies are expanded to other tissues, which is both feasible and a strength of the approach, the potential targets they identify will be in adipose tissue. Modulation of these targets could have systemic effects and even β cell effects, but this needs to be shown. The authors pointed out that several genes already related to obesity, Zfp90, C3ar1, Hsd11b1 and Tgfbr2, were identified by and thus validated their approach. They also studied 3 additional genes, Lpl, Lactb and Ppm1l, which they identify as “previously unknown obesity genes,” although lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) is certainly well known to researchers in the field. The independent ablation of each of these genes leads to an overweight or obese phenotype.

Additional studies will determine whether these are bona fide drug targets or ‘just’ research tools. But it is certain that these types of systems biology, network analysis approaches will prove to be invaluable in the hunt for safer and more efficacious drugs that are tailored to obese subjects and patients with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2150683218,"The cytokine, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), is encoded in a functionally polymorphic locus and subjects with high-expression MIF alleles are at an increased risk of inflammatory disease. Severe sepsis is the leading cause of death in intensive care units, and the prevailing hypothesis is that an excessive innate response contributes to its pathogenesis. To assess if MIF alleles influence the clinical course of infection, we conducted a case-control study to assess susceptibility and a parallel inception cohort study of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to assess risk of severe sepsis and 90-d mortality. Two distinct polymorphisms in the MIF promoter were analyzed: a G/C transition at -173 and a CATT repeat at -794. The frequency of both polymorphisms was similar in the CAP cohort (n=1739) and controls (n=639); however, the 90-d mortality was lower for the high-expression C allele (P=0.003). This association remained significant after adjusting for demographics, comorbid conditions, and disease severity score [hazard ratio=0.64 (0.44-0.91), P=0.01]. The hazard ratio was similar in different geographic subcohorts, and the association remained significant after adjusting for false discovery. These data indicate that polymorphisms associated with higher MIF expression may have a beneficial effect in community-acquired pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W1986836275,"The tumor suppressor p53 protein supports growth arrest and is able to induce apoptosis, a signaling cascade regulated by sequential activation of caspases. Mechanisms that lead from p53 to activation of individual initiator caspases are still unclear. The present model for caspase-2 activation includes PIDDosome complex formation. However, in certain experimental models, elimination of complex constituents PIDD or RAIDD did not significantly influence caspase-2 activation, suggesting the existence of an alternative activation platform for caspase-2. Here we have investigated the link between p53 and caspase-2 in further detail and report that the latter is able to utilize the CD95 DISC as an activation platform. The recruitment of caspase-8 to this complex is required for activation of caspase-2. In the experimental system used, the DISC is formed through a distinct, p53-dependent upregulation of CD95. Moreover, we show that caspase-2 and -8 cleave Bid, and that both act simultaneously upstream of mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Finally, a direct interaction between the two caspases and the ability of caspase-8 to cleave caspase-2 are demonstrated. Thus, the observed functional link between caspase-8 and -2 within the DISC represents an alternative mechanism to the PIDDosome for caspase-2 activation in response to DNA damage."

We employed Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) via fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to study the interaction of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain (TMD) of HA with agly co sylphos pha tidyl ino si tol (GPI)-anchored peptide, an established marker for rafts in the exoplasmic leaflet of living mammalian plasma membranes.

Assembly of enveloped viruses requires the selective recruitment of viral components at distinct sites of the host cell membranes from which viruses bud. One of the most intensely studied enveloped viruses with respect to assembly is the influenza virus, in which budding takes place at the plasma membrane of epithelial cells. Three membrane proteins are embedded in the influenza virus envelope: hemagglutinin (HA), 3The abbreviations used are:HAhemagglutininFLIMfluorescence lifetime imaging microscopyFRETFörster resonance energy transferGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolGFPgreen fluorescent proteinCFPcyan fluorescent proteinYFPyellow fluorescent proteinmCFP and mYFPmutated CFP and YFP, respectivelyTMDtransmembrane domainCTcytoplasmic tailDRMdetergent-resistant membraneCHOChinese hamster ovarySFVSemliki Forest virusMβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrin. 3The abbreviations used are:HAhemagglutininFLIMfluorescence lifetime imaging microscopyFRETFörster resonance energy transferGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolGFPgreen fluorescent proteinCFPcyan fluorescent proteinYFPyellow fluorescent proteinmCFP and mYFPmutated CFP and YFP, respectivelyTMDtransmembrane domainCTcytoplasmic tailDRMdetergent-resistant membraneCHOChinese hamster ovarySFVSemliki Forest virusMβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrin. which mediates binding of the virus to the host cell and fusion with cell target membrane (1.White J. Helenius A. Gething M.J. Nature. 1982; 300: 658-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); neuraminidase; and the proton channel M2. The inner viral membrane leaflet is covered by the matrix protein M1, which is supposed to mediate binding of the eight viral RNA-nucleoprotein complexes harboring the genetic information of the virus. Several studies support a role of lipid domains as a platform for enrichment of viral components. HA, the most abundant envelope protein of the influenza virus, has been found to be enriched in detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fractions (2.Scheiffele P. Rietveld A. Wilk T. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2038-2044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 3.Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K.

A. 2003; 100: 14610-14617Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Typical lipid components of those fractions are saturated phospholipids, glycosphingolipids, and cholesterol, which are known to form liquid-ordered domains (5.De Almeida R.F. Loura L.M. Fedorov A. Prieto M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1109-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This has led to the idea that so-called lipid rafts, which resemble liquid-ordered domains, could function as assembly sites. Support for this hypothesis was given by the observation that the lipid composition of the influenza virus envelope is more similar to that of a raft than to the overall plasma membrane (2.Scheiffele P. Rietveld A. Wilk T. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2038-2044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 6.Zhang J. Pekosz A. Lamb R.A. J.

As it has been shown that DRM fractions may not represent the native state of lipid domains, in particular of rafts (7.Heerklotz H. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2693-2701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 8.Munro S. Cell. 2003; 115: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar), subsequent efforts have focused on other techniques to assess the lateral organization of HA. Electron microscopy studies using immunogold labeling (4.Takeda M. Leser G.P. Russell C.J. Lamb R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A specific problem encountered in studying the lateral organization of proteins in the plasma membrane is that lipid domains as rafts are typically organized at a submicroscopic level. Indeed, several attempts to image raft domains in biological membranes have suggested that rafts are very small and highly dynamic (11.Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 456-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 12.Silvius J.R. Nabi I.R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2006; 23: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A guiding study in the characterization of lipid domains in biological membranes has been performed by Mayor and colleagues (13.Sharma P. Varma R. Sarasij Ira R.C. Gousset K. Krishnamoorthy G. Rao M. Mayor S. Cell. 2004; 116: 577-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) on the plasma membrane of CHO-K1 cells. Based on homoFRET measurements they have shown that about 20–40% of GFP-tagged glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) (for review see Brown and Rose (14.Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar)) and other GPI-anchored proteins are organized with about three to four copies in small cholesterol-sensitive clusters. Mathematical modeling of those experimental data is consistent with a domain diameter of about 5 nm (13.Sharma P. Varma R. Sarasij Ira R.C. Gousset K. Krishnamoorthy G. Rao M. Mayor S. Cell. 2004; 116: 577-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the lateral organization of the C terminus of HA, corresponding to the transmembrane domain (TMD), and the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of the protein in the plasma membrane of CHO-K1 cells, taking advantage of the well characterized spatial arrangement of the raft marker GPI in those cells (see above). Lateral organization was studied essentially by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)-based FRET between CFP (donor) and YFP (acceptor). For this purpose, we replaced the ectodomain of HA by YFP and studied FRET between this construct and GPI-CFP. As a complementary approach, we performed ensemble measurements in suspensions of plasma membranes purified from cells expressing fluorescent GPI and HA constructs. We measured homoFRET by time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, providing information on the aggregation/clustering state of the fluorescent constructs, which is important in rationalizing the FLIM-FRET data. The sequence TMD-HA consisting of the TMD and CT as well as 38 amino acid of the ectodomain of HA from A/FPV/Rostock/34 (H7N1) corresponding to ASIRNNTYDHSKYREEAMQNRIQIDPVKLSGYKDVILWFSFGASCFLLLAIAMGLVFICVKNGNMRCTICI (glycosylation site, single underline; palmitoylation site, double underline; TMD, bold) was tagged on its N terminus with YFP (or CFP) and expressed in CHO-K1 cells. Palmitoylation sites were mutated to serine for generation of the non-palmitoylated variant TMD-HAC3S. The raft markers GPI-CFP and GPI-YFP were kindly provided by Patrick Keller (15.Keller P. Toomre D. Diaz E. White J. Simons K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). To exclude dimerization of fluorescent proteins, constructs with the mutation A206K in the fluorescent proteins (16.Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar) were also generated (mCFP, mYFP). For assessment of palmitoylation and endoglycosidase H resistance see the supplemental Experimental Procedures on-line. SFV-E2-mCFP was provided by Bastian Thaa. 4B. Thaa, unpublished data. Cells were depleted of cholesterol by treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD). Depletion was quantified by using [1α,2α(n)-3H]cholesterol. The partition of constructs in DRM was assessed by Western blot after Triton X-100 treatment of cells and centrifugation in sucrose gradient. Plasma membrane extracts were obtained by homogenization of cells and Nycodenz step gradient centrifugation. For more details see the supplemental data. For cytochalasin D treatment, CHO-K1 transfectants were incubated with a 1 μm solution of cytochalasin D at 37 °C for 20 h. Cells were then washed with Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline and supplied with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red before measurement (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany). Intensity measurements as well as FLIM-FRET measurements were carried out using an inverted FluoView 1000 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a time-resolved LSM Upgrade kit (PicoQuant, Berlin, Germany) and a ×60 (1.35 numerical aperture) oil immersion objective at 25 °C. Images with a frame size of 512 × 512 pixels were acquired. FLIM was used to study energy transfer between the GPI-CFP raft marker (donor) and the different TMD-HA-YFP variants (acceptor). CFP was excited at 440 nm using a laser diode and detected in the range of 460 to 490 nm. YFP was excited at 515 nm using an argon laser and detected in the range of 535 to 575 nm. The CFP lifetime of cells expressing GPI-CFP only was measured first. The selection of cells coexpressing both proteins was based on fluorescence emission in the CFP and YFP channels after sequential excitation. FLIM images of the donor in the absence and in the presence of acceptor were acquired upon excitation of the donor at 440 nm. Fluorescence intensities were analyzed by the ImageJ analysis program, which enables selection and analysis of the same area for pictures taken sequentially. For FLIM measurements, CFP was excited at 440 nm using a pulsed laser diode. Fluorescence was detected by a single photon avalanche photodiode (SPAD) and a 470 ± 15 nm bandpass filter. Electrical signals were processed by using the TimeHarp 200 PC card. Analysis of FLIM images was performed using SymPhoTime software (PicoQuant), taking into account the instrument response function. FLIM pictures were accumulated for 90 s (60 frames with an average photon count rate of ∼2–4 × 104 counts/s), and the plasma membrane was analyzed selectively. The measured photons-per-pixels corresponding to the plasma membrane were combined into a decay curve that was further analyzed by fitting it using a nonlinear least squares iterative procedure as the sum of two exponential terms. This kind of fitting is required because fluorescent proteins variants are known to show a multiple exponential decay (17.Lackowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy 3rd Ed.. Springer Science+Business Media, New York2006Crossref Scopus (17811) Google Scholar). For every single cell the average lifetime of CFP was calculated using the following equation (17.Lackowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy 3rd Ed.. Springer Science+Business Media, New York2006Crossref Scopus (17811) Google Scholar). τAV=∑iαiτi(Eq. 1) Quality of fits was judged by the distribution of the residuals and the χ2 value. The efficiency of FRET (E) was calculated using the equation, E(%)=1−τDAτD(Eq. 2) where τDA is the average lifetime of the donor in the presence of the acceptor and τD is the average lifetime of the donor expressed alone. The FRET efficiency (E) of every cell coexpressing donor and acceptor was plotted against the fluorescence intensity of the acceptor (FYFP) in this cell. The data points were fitted according to the equation, E(%)=EMAX(%)×FYFPFYFP+KD(Eq. 3) assuming that E is a hyperbolic function of the amount of acceptor. Emax (in %) is the maximal FRET efficiency calculated from the fitting (16.Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar). Equation 3 provides a dissociation constant (KD) as a parameter to assess the associative properties of donor and acceptor (see Table 1).TABLE 1Fluorescence intensity and anisotropy decay parametersSampleα1τ1α2τ2α3τ3τDχ2ϕ1ϕ2χ2tot〈r〉nsnsnsnsnsns−MβCD0.190.630.331.920.483.642.501.091.16331.200.33+MβCD0.160.580.351.830.493.632.511.17ND321.230.34+TMD-HA- mYFP0.240.400.311.510.253.782.271.21NDNDNDND Open table in a new tab TMD-HA protein expression levels were monitored by measuring the fluorescence intensity of proteins at the plasma membrane. Confocal images were collected after sequential excitation of CFP and YFP, keeping all measurement conditions constant, and plasma membrane fluorescence intensity was analyzed. The mean intensity of the acceptor was taken as a measure for the amount of acceptor expressed after subtraction of the background. The amount of unquenched donor in the plasma membrane of cells expressing both acceptor and donor was determined correcting the measured donor intensity (ID) for the fluorescence decrease of the donor due to FRET. To estimate the efficiency of energy transfer (E) for every single cell, the average lifetime of a cell coexpressing donor and acceptor and the mean average lifetime of 10 cells expressing the donor alone were used. The unquenched donor amount (D) is then calculated as follows. D=ID(1−E)(Eq. 4) The steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence instrumentation is the same as described previously (18.De Almeida R.F. Loura L.M. Prieto M. Watts A. Fedorov A. Barrantes F.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2006; 23: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements on purified plasma membrane suspensions at 25 °C, excitation and emission wavelengths were 435 and 477 nm for CFP and 515 and 535 nm for YFP, respectively (for protein concentrations, see Table 2). Fluorescence intensity and anisotropy decay curves were obtained by the single-photon timing technique. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 415 and 460–490 nm, respectively (CFP channel), or 490 and 520–560 nm (YFP channel). For fluorescence anisotropy decay collection and analysis see De Almeida et al. (18.De Almeida R.F. Loura L.M. Prieto M. Watts A. Fedorov A. Barrantes F.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2006; 23: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Both fluorescence intensity and anisotropy decay were analyzed with TRFA software (Scientific Software Technologies Center, Minsk, Belarus). Based on the rates of fluorescence anisotropy decay due to homoFRET, the distance R between fluorophores was calculated according to Gautier et al. (19.Gautier I. Tramier M. Durieux C. Coppey J.

Photochem. Photobiol. 1979; 29: 1091-1097Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), as described in Sharma et al. (13.Sharma P. Varma R. Sarasij Ira R.C. Gousset K. Krishnamoorthy G. Rao M. Mayor S. Cell. 2004; 116: 577-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), as follows. τϕ1=12ω(Eq. 5) with ω=32κ2(R0R)6τAV(Eq. 6) where τϕ1 is the short rotational correlation time (see “Results”), κ2 = ⅔, and R0 is the Förster radius (obtained from Patterson et al. (21.Patterson G.H. Piston D.W. Barisas B.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar)). To study the lateral organization of the HA transmembrane domain with the cytoplasmic tail, we fused the N terminus of this sequence with the C terminus of YFP, replacing essentially the HA ectodomain. This construct was not delivered to the plasma membrane of CHO-K1 cells (not shown). However, upon fusion of the HA signal peptide to the N terminus of the fluorophore (Fig. 1), TMD-HA-YFP and TMD-HAC3S-YFP were transported to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, A and B). The constructs contain a short sequence of the HA ectodomain bearing a potential glycosylation site (NNT). Apart from monomers, the constructs formed stable dimers (supplemental Fig. 1A). We could not detect any difference between constructs with wild type (CFP, YFP) and those with mutated fluorescent proteins (mCFP, mYFP), preventing any potential dimerization of fluorescent proteins (see below and “Experimental Procedures”). Endoglycosidase H digestion (supplemental Fig. 1B) reveals that TMD-HA dimers, but not monomers, acquire endoglycosidase H-resistant carbohydrates, a modification that occurs during the transport of proteins through the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane (22.Copeland C.S. Doms R.W. Bolzau E.M. Webster R.G. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Hence, only the dimeric form of TMD-HA is transported to the plasma membrane. Labeling of the protein with [3H]palmitate confirmed palmitoylation of the TMD-HA-YFP and the lack of palmitic acid attachment to TMD-HAC3S-YFP (supplemental Fig. 1C) (23.Veit M. Kretzschmar E. Kuroda K. Garten W. Schmidt M.F. Klenk H.D. Rott R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2491-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Triton X-100 extraction revealed the partition of TMD-HA-YFP to DRM fractions similar to that known for full-length HA (4.Takeda M. Leser G.P. Russell C.J. Lamb R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14610-14617Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 24.Tall R.D. Alonso M.A. Roth M.G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1D). In contrast, TMD-HAC3S-YFP did not localize at all to those fractions, confirming that palmitoylation is an important signal for DRM partition. To compare the results obtained from different cells, we routinely verified that the protein amount in the plasma membrane was comparable among the different experiments. TMD-HA expression levels were monitored by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the proteins at the plasma membrane. Fig. 3 shows that the mean intensity ratio between donor and acceptor (D/A ratio) is similar among different donor and acceptor pairs. Hence, FRET efficiencies for different combinations of donor-acceptor pairs could be compared directly.FIGURE 2Characterization of expression and fluorescence lifetime of TMD-HA-YFP and TMD-HAC3S-YFP.

Each set was done on the same day, and each point refers to a single cell. Although we found variations in lifetimes among sets, these values were highly reproducible within the same set of experiments. An unpaired t test was performed to assess statistical significance (see p values in legends to FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). The average donor lifetimes of cells expressing only GPI-CFP vary within a given range, which does not significantly overlap with the shorter average lifetimes of donor-acceptor coexpressing cells. To exclude the possibility that any FRET was the result of dimerization of the fluorophores, we also studied constructs with the mutation A206K of CFP and YFP, known to prevent any direct interaction between fluorescent proteins (16.Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar). Again, we could not detect any difference in FRET between constructs with wild type (CFP, YFP) and mutated fluorescent proteins (mCFP, mYFP) (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). Therefore, although the results with both forms of fluorescent proteins are shown in FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, we will not distinguish further between them in this section. First, we verified that GPI-anchored fluorescent proteins are raft-associated. The lifetime of GPI-CFP in the plasma membrane was significantly shorter when the protein was coexpressed with the acceptor GPI-YFP, due to FRET (Fig. 5A). To disrupt rafts, plasma membranes were depleted of cholesterol by preincubating the cells with MβCD. Under our conditions, 12 ± 3% (n = 2, in duplicates) of the cholesterol was extracted from the cells. Cholesterol depletion led to a reduced FRET efficiency (Fig. 5A), confirming that GPI-CFP localizes to rafts (13.Sharma P. Varma R. Sarasij Ira R.C. Gousset K. Krishnamoorthy G. Rao M. Mayor S. Cell. 2004; 116: 577-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 14.Brown D.A. Rose J.K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar). Coexpression of GPI-CFP with TMD-HA-YFP led to a significant shortening of donor lifetime (Fig. 4A) as evident from typical FLIM images for a cell expressing donor only (Fig. 2, C and E) and a cell expressing both donor and acceptor (Fig. 2, D and F). This could be attributed to FRET, which was about 10%. For each experiment the mean average lifetime of 10 cells was taken, and the FRET efficiency was calculated. In Fig. 5B the average efficiency is shown. Upon cholesterol depletion, a decrease of FRET was observed between GPI-CFP and TMD-HA-YFP (Fig. 5B). To probe whether MβCD was extracting GPI-CFP, fluorescence in the supernatant isolated from the treated cells was measured. The fluorescence intensity was in the range of a few percent of the total CFP intensity (not shown) showing that the donor was stably anchored to the membrane. Moreover, CFP lifetime in cells expressing only the donor was not affected by MβCD treatment (2.37 ± 0.02 ns in nontreated cells (n = 14); 2.33 ± 0.02 ns after MβCD treatment (n = 12). Data represent mean ± S.E.). FLIM data were also analyzed by a model used by Zacharias et al. (16.Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar) who have shown that the dependence of the FRET efficiency (E) as a function of the acceptor fluorescence intensity (here FYFP) provides insight into the clustering of donor-acceptor pairs. When E (%) is fitted to a hyperbolic function (as described under “Experimental Procedures”), reflecting a simple saturating binding model of a ligand to its receptor, the relation between FYFP and the dissociation constant KD allowed us to assess the clustering of the probes. KD provides a parameter for the degree of clustering. If FYFP > KD, clustering of acceptor and donor occurs, and FRET is largely independent of acceptor concentration. However, if KD is in the same range of, or even larger than, FYFP, FRET efficiencies are approximately proportional to the acceptor surface densities, reflecting that the donors and acceptors are mutually randomly distributed and FRET is due to random distribution on the cell surface. However, KD values cannot be compared between different experiments (16.Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar). When fitting the FRET efficiency for GPI-CFP/TMD-HA-YFP as a function of the acceptor intensity (TMD-HA-YFP) we found FYFP > KD (see Fig. 6, A and B). KD increased 4-fold upon cholesterol depletion, indicating a reduced clustering. A similar observation was made for GPI-CFP/GPI-YFP (see Fig. 6, C and D).

We found that thioredoxin, Txnl1/TRP32, binds to Rpn11, a subunit of the regulatory complex of the human 26 S proteasome. Txnl1 is abundant, metabolically stable, and widely expressed and is present in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Txnl1 has thioredoxin activity with a redox potential of about -250 mV. Mutant Txnl1 with one active site cysteine replaced by serine formed disulfide bonds to eEF1A1, a substrate-recruiting factor of the 26 S proteasome. eEF1A1 is therefore a likely physiological substrate. In response to knockdown of Txnl1, ubiquitin-protein conjugates were moderately stabilized. Hence, Txnl1 is the first example of a direct connection between protein reduction and proteolysis, two major intracellular protein quality control mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2120996370,"Preparation of monodisperse vesicles is important both for research purposes and for practical applications. While the extrusion of vesicles through small pores (∼100 nm in diameter) results in relatively uniform populations of vesicles, extrusion to larger sizes results in very heterogeneous populations of vesicles. Here we report a simple method for preparing large monodisperse multilamellar vesicles through a combination of extrusion and large-pore dialysis. For example, extrusion of polydisperse vesicles through 5-µm-diameter pores eliminates vesicles larger than 5 µm in diameter. Dialysis of extruded vesicles against 3-µm-pore-size polycarbonate membranes eliminates vesicles smaller than 3 µm in diameter, leaving behind a population of monodisperse vesicles with a mean diameter of ∼4 µm. The simplicity of this method makes it an effective tool for laboratory vesicle preparation with potential applications in preparing large monodisperse liposomes for drug delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2065259435,"Selenium is an essential micronutrient for humans and animals, and its deficiency can predispose to the development of pathological conditions. This study evaluates the effect of selenium deficiency on the thioredoxin system, consisting of NADPH, selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and thioredoxin (Trx); and the glutathione system, including NADPH, glutathione reductase, glutathione, and glutaredoxin coupled with selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase (GPx). We particularly investigate whether inactive truncated TrxR is present under selenium-starvation conditions due to reading of the UGA codon as stop. Feeding rats a selenium-deficient diet resulted in a large decrease in activity of TrxR and GPx in rat liver but not in the levels of Trx1 and Grx1. However, selenium deficiency induced mitochondrial Grx2 10-fold and markedly changed the expression of some flavoproteins that are involved in the cellular folate, glucose, and lipid metabolism. Liver TrxR mRNA was nearly unchanged, but no truncated enzyme was found. Instead, a low-activity form of TrxR with a cysteine substituted for the penultimate selenocysteine in the C-terminal active site was identified in selenium-deficient rat liver. These results show a novel mechanism for decoding the UGA stop codon, inserting cysteine to make a full-length enzyme that may be required for selenium assimilation."
https://openalex.org/W2129894637,"ADAMTS1 (adisintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 1) is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family. We have previously reported that ADAMTS1 was strongly expressed in myocardial infarction. In this study, we investigated whether hypoxia induced ADAMTS1 and investigated its regulatory mechanism. In hypoxia, the expression level of ADAMTS1 mRNA and protein rapidly increased in endothelial cells, but not in other cell types. Interestingly, the induction of ADAMTS1 by hypoxia was transient, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor induction by hypoxia in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) increased in a time-dependent manner. CoCl2, a transition metal that mimics hypoxia, induced ADAMTS1 in HUVEC. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 dose-dependently inhibited the increase of ADAMTS1 mRNA expression in hypoxia. We characterized the promoter region of ADAMTS1, and the secreted luciferase assay system demonstrated that hypoxia induced luciferase secretion in the culture medium 4.6-fold in HUVEC. In the promoter region of ADAMTS1, we found at least three putative hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) binding sites, and the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed HIF-1 binding to HIF binding sites in the promoter region of ADAMTS1 under hypoxia. Recombinant ADAMTS1 protein promoted the migration of HUVEC under hypoxic conditions. In summary, we found that ADAMTS1 is transiently induced by hypoxia in endothelial cells, and its transcription is mediated by HIF-1 binding.

In arthritic cartilage, aggrecan breakdown, mediated by members of ADAMTS, not matrix metalloproteinases, is one of the features of the progressive stage.

Low oxygen tension (hypoxia) affects endothelial cells in a number of ways, including the transcriptionally regulated expression of vasoactive substances and matrix proteins (11Faller D.V. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1999; 26: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). One mechanism of the regulation of gene expression in response to hypoxia is mediated by the transcriptional factor HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 1) (12Wiesener M.S. Maxwell P.H. Ann. Med. 2003; 35: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is a heterodimer composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β/ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) subunits. In normoxia, HIF-1α protein undergoes rapid ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (13Kapitsinou P.P. Haase V.H.

In this study, we found that the exposure of endothelial cells to hypoxia up-regulated ADAMTS1 expression, and the transcriptional activation of ADAMTS1 was mediated by HIF-1, which binds to HREs in the promoter region of the ADAMTS1 gene. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. HUVEC and human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) were purchased from Sanko Junyaku (Tokyo, Japan), and human microvascular endothelial cells were purchased from Kurabo (Osaka, Japan). Endothelial cells were cultured in EBM-2 (Cambrex Bioscience, Walkersville, MD) with a kit containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), growth factors, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, as previously described (16Miyoshi T.

Human skin fibroblasts and ARPE cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Cells prior to passage 10 were used for analysis. Cells were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and 20% O2 in a humidified chamber. For hypoxic stimulation, cells were diluted to 2.0 × 105 cells in a 12-well plastic plate and cultured for 48 h, and control cultures were continuously incubated in 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Hypoxic cultures were placed within an incubator chamber (ASTEC Co. Ltd., Fukuoka, Japan), filled with 1% O2, 5% CO2, and balance N2 for the times indicated. For chemically mimicked hypoxia, cobalt chloride (CoCl2) was used at a final concentration of 150 μm. We also tested inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis under hypoxia. Actinomycin D (RNA synthesis inhibitor; 100 μg/ml) or cycloheximide (a protein synthesis inhibitor; 100 μg/ml) was added prior to stimulation. Purified recombinant human ADAMTS1 protein (amino residues 50–734) was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002) was purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA), dissolved in DMSO, and used at the final concentrations indicated under hypoxic conditions. The viability and proliferation of HUVEC were determined using a standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl) 2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) viability test (CellTiter AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI)) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a suspension of transfected HUVEC (1.5 × 105 cells/well) in 1000 μl of EBM2 with 2% FBS was added to 12-well plates for the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Cells were allowed to recover for 18 h, and the following day, cells were stimulated with hypoxia (1% O2) for 24 h and then normoxia (20% O2) for 24 h, respectively. After collecting culture medium at each point (Fig. 6B), cell viability was measured using a plate reader (17Cory A.H. Owen T.C. Barltrop J.A. Cory J.G.

For the functional assay, HUVEC (1 × 105 cells/well) in 500 μl of EBM2 with 2% FBS were seeded into 24-well plates and stimulated with hypoxia (1% O2) for 12 h with each concentration of recombinant ADAMTS1 protein. All samples were read in quadruplicate. Following stimulation, the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and total RNA was extracted as previously reported (19Yamawaki H. Hirohata S. Miyoshi T. Takahashi K.

Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed using a LightCycler rapid thermal cycler system (Roche Applied Science) following the previously reported protocol (20Flannery C.R. Little C.B. Caterson B.

The intra- and interassay coefficients of variations were <5% and were reasonably small compared with those in other reports. The primers used in this study are listed in Table 1. Regarding internal control, we used a human housekeeping gene primer set (Takara, Ohtsu, Japan) and determined the most stable housekeeping genes according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 15 primers for housekeeping genes were examined, and we selected the three most stable genes (human ATP5F1 (ATP synthase, H+-transporting, mitochondrial F0 complex, subunit B1), RPLP0 (ribosomal protein, large, P0), and RPLP2 (ribosomal protein, large, P2)) as suitable internal controls for our analysis (data not shown). Subsequently, the threshold cycle (Ct) (i.e. the number of cycles at which the amount of the amplified gene of interest reached a fixed threshold) was determined. The amount of ADAMTS1 or VEGF mRNA under normoxic and hypoxic conditions was normalized to the internal control. The data obtained with RPLP0 and RPLP2 are not shown, because the results were identical to those obtained with ATP5F1 (data not shown). To verify the presence and the predicted size of amplified fragments, PCR products were separated by electrophoresis and visualized in 1.5% agarose gels with ethidium bromide.TABLE 1Primers used for PCR analysisPrimerSequenceADAMTS1 Forward5′-GGACAGGTGCAAGCTCATCTG-3′ Reverse5′-TCTACAACCTTGGGCTGCAAA-3′ChIP a Forward5′-GCCCTTCAGAAGTAAGCTGAGTTG-3′ Reverse5′-GCTCCAAGTAGATCTGGGTCCTTT-3′ChIP b Forward5′-GGAGACCAGTTCGAGCACTA-3′ Reverse5′-GCTATATCCGCGTTACGAAAGCG-3′ChIP c Forward5′-GATATAGCCTTTTCCCTTCCT-3′ Reverse5′-TCGAGAAATGATCGGCTC-3′ChIP d Forward5′-TGTTGAGTGAAAGCACGCAGACTG-3′ Reverse5′-GCCAGGTGACACTTCCTACG-3′ Open table in a new tab After stimulation, the cells were washed once with PBS and then scraped from the plates. Cells were solubilized in 250 μl of CelLyticTM M (Sigma) with a protease inhibitor mixture. After incubation in a rotator at 4 °C for 15 min, the samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected. The protein concentration of the cell extracts was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Fifteen micrograms of total protein were used for Western blot analysis, as described previously (22Hirohata S. Wang L.W. Miyagi M. Yan L. Seldin M.F. Keene D.R. Crabb J.W. Apte S.S. J. Biol.

Briefly, ∼30 μl of each sample were mixed with 5× sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE using a gradient gel (5–15%) (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrate cellulose membranes (Advantech, Tokyo, Japan) overnight at 4 °C and then blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dried skim milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T). The membranes were hybridized at 4 °C overnight with anti-ADAMTS1 antibody (3C8F4; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). After stringent washing with PBS-T three times for 5 min each at room temperature, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies (MP Biomedicals, Aurora, OH). Following three successive washes with PBS-T, immunoreactive bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL plus; GE Healthcare). Signals were detected with LAS1000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan), and the densitometry was performed with Image J software (W. Rasband, Research Services Branch, NIMH, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and normalized to the signal intensity of β-actin for equal protein loading control of each sample in each experiment. This quantification was performed with the linear range of the standard curve defined by the standard sample, β-actin, for all densitometry analysis. We used the secreted luciferase vector system as previously reported (24Secchiero P. Corallini F. Rimondi E. Chiaruttini C. di Iasio M.G. Rustighi A. Del Sal G. Zauli G. Blood. 2008; 111: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The structures of ADAMTS1 promoter-luciferase constructs are shown in Fig. 5. To generate the ADAMTS1 promoter reporter plasmid, a fragment containing bases −1638 through −342 of the ADAMTS1 gene 5′-flanking region was amplified by PCR with a proofreading enzyme (Takara LA taq; Takara, Ohtsu, Japan) using human genomic DNA as a template. Following amplification, PCR products were run on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and then cloned into pCR®2.1-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Inserts were excised by digestion with the restriction enzyme EcoRI and then ligated into the promoterless pMetLuc-Reporter vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). After confirming the insert direction by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing, each construct was used for the secreted luciferase assay system. As the positive control, pMetLuc-Control vector (Clontech) was used, and an empty pMetLuc-Reporter vector was used for negative control. Electroporation was performed using a Microporator (BMS-MP-100; Microporator, Seoul, Korea), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were removed from the plate with trypsin, centrifuged, and dissolved in serum-free medium. Cells and constructs were mixed into the buffer, and, after exposure to electricity (1000 V for 30 ms, two pulses), cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells in 12-well dishes with 1000 μl of culture medium. After seeding, cells were allowed to recover for 18 h. The medium was then changed, and cells were stimulated for 24 h under 1% O2 (hypoxia). After 24 h of stimulation, the medium was collected and then incubated for another 24 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and 20% O2 (normoxia), and the medium was collected again (Fig. 6B). The secreted luciferase was measured with the Ready-to-glow secreted luciferase reporter system (Clontech), according to the manufacturer's instructions, in a luminometer. The ChIP assay of the ADAMTS1 promoter region was performed as previously described using a commercially available system (ChIP assay kit; Upstate/Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions (23Yaykasli K.O. Oohashi T. Hirohata S. Hatipoglu O.F. Inagawa K. Demircan K. Ninomiya Y. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2009; 323: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 × 106 HUVEC in a 10-cm dish were stimulated with either normoxia or hypoxia for 3 h. Chromatin was cross-linked with formaldehyde (final concentration at 1%) at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were then washed with PBS, centrifuged, lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, 1 m KCl, 10% Nonidet P-40) in the presence of protease inhibitors, and incubated for 10 min on ice. Cell lysates were sonicated for 5 s six times to shear DNA to a length of 200–800 bp. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were transferred to new tubes. Supernatants were precleared with a mixture of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose 50% slurry for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged, agarose was then pelleted, and supernatants were transferred to new tubes. For immunoprecipitation, anti-HIF-1α monoclonal antibody (Novus Biologicals Antibodies, Littleton, CO) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Isotype-matched mouse IgG2b (Ancel Corp., Bayport, MN) served as a negative control. We also used anti-acetyl-histone H4 antibody (Upstate/Millipore) as a positive control. The next day, samples were washed with four supplied washing buffers for 15 min each at 4 °C with gentle rotation and then eluted twice with elution buffer for 15 min each. The eluted chromatin was dissolved in Tris-EDTA buffer, and agarose beads were spun down. Cross-links were reversed by the addition of 20 μl of 5 m NaCl to a volume of 500 μl of chromatin-containing buffer and by heating the mixture to 65 °C for 4 h. EDTA and Tris-HCl buffers were added together with proteinase K. Sheared DNA was recovered using a DNA recovery kit (NucleoSpin Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany). To identify immunoprecipitated ADAMTS1 genomic DNA, PCR was performed using the primers listed in Table 1. PCR was performed at 96 °C for 4 min and then 96 °C for 30 s, 56 or 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 30 cycles, as previously described (25Sezaki S. Hirohata S. Iwabu A. Nakamura K. Toeda K. Miyoshi T. Yamawaki H. Demircan K. Kusachi S. Shiratori Y. Ninomiya Y. Exp. Biol. Med. 2005; 230: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We used input DNA (genomic DNA after sonication) as a positive control and immunoprecipitated DNA with mouse IgG2b as a negative control for the experiments. The endothelial cell migration assay was performed as previously described (26Petersen E.J. Miyoshi T. Yuan Z. Hirohata S. Li J.Z. Shi W. Angle J.F. Atherosclerosis. 2008; 198: 301-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In brief, HUVEC (passages 6–8) were seeded on a collagen-coated 24-well plate to 70% confluence. After an 18-h incubation, a single uniform scratch was made using a 1000-μl blue plastic pipette tip. The scratch resulted in a cell-free gap of ∼1.0 mm between two adjoining areas of HUVEC. The medium was changed to with or without recombinant ADAMTS1 protein, and HUVEC were incubated under normoxia or hypoxia for 12 h. After incubation, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (w/v in PBS), and each scratch was photographed along the length of the scratch, starting proximally and ending distally (n = 6). Areas covered by migrating cells across wound edges were quantitatively measured using Win Roof software (Mitani Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. unless specifically mentioned. Student's t test was applied for statistical analysis, as appropriate. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. We first examined whether the expression of the ADAMTS1 gene is induced in hypoxic HUVEC. As shown in Fig. 1A, the ADAMTS1 mRNA expression significantly increased as early as 1 h after hypoxic stimulation, as seen in quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis. Interestingly, the increase of ADAMTS1 mRNA by hypoxia peaked at 3 h, decreased at 6 h, and then returned to the normal level (normoxia) at 24 h. The production of ADAMTS1 at the protein level by hypoxia was confirmed to be transient by Western blot analysis and was quantitatively analyzed (Fig. 1B). The increased expression of ADAMTS1 protein was parallel to the mRNA expression increase in hypoxic HUVEC. CoCl2, a chemically mimicked hypoxic condition, also increased the expression of ADAMTS1 mRNA (Fig. 1C). We then examined the hypoxic induction of ADAMTS1 mRNA expression in other endothelial cells (Fig. 2). Both human microvascular endothelial cells and HPAEC increased the ADAMTS1 mRNA expression by hypoxia, but the induction pattern and its increase differed somewhat depending on the cell line. The induction of ADAMTS1 mRNA by hypoxia was also confirmed in mice using mouse brain endothelial cells (data not shown).FIGURE 2Induction of ADAMTS1 mRNA expression by hypoxia was examined in other endothelial cell lines (human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) and HPAEC). Human microvascular endothelial cells and HPAEC were incubated under hypoxic conditions, and ADAMTS1 mRNA levels were examined (n = 4 each). The relative expression level of ADAMTS1 mRNA normalized with an internal control was shown as the -fold increase compared with that under normoxia. ADAMTS1 mRNA expression level was increased under hypoxia in several endothelial cell lines. Human microvascular endothelial cells and HPAEC were treated by hypoxia, as indicated. *, p < 0.05 compared with the control (normoxia).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then treated HUVEC with actinomycin D and cycloheximide and examined the effect of hypoxia on ADAMTS1 transcription. Although actinomycin D markedly blocked the expression of ADAMTS1 mRNA, cycloheximide had no effect on the ADAMTS1 mRNA expression, indicating that new protein synthesis under hypoxia is not required for ADAMTS1 mRNA induction (Fig. 3). We then examined the hypoxic induction of ADAMTS1 mRNA in other types of cells (Fig. 4A). The cells examined in this study (fibroblasts and ARPE) did not show a significant increase of the ADAMTS1 mRNA expression by hypoxia. We then compared the pattern of ADAMTS1 and VEGF mRNA expressions in HUVEC and fibroblasts in hypoxia, respectively. In HUVEC, ADAMTS1 mRNA expression was increased by hypoxia, and then VEGF mRNA expression gradually increased (Fig. 4B). In fibroblasts, as shown in Fig. 4C, the VEGF mRNA expression was gradually increased by hypoxic stimulation, whereas ADAMTS1 mRNA was not significantly altered. These results indicate that the induction of ADAMTS1 mRNA by hypoxia is specific to certain types of cells. It is known that hypoxia increases the phosphorylation of AKT downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation (27Fischer S. Wiesnet M. Marti H.H. Renz D. Schaper W. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 198: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Treating cells with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002) blocks the induction of ADAMTS1 mRNA expression in HUVEC under hypoxia in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, attenuated ADAMTS1 mRNA expression by hypoxia in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). PD98059, an extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor, moderately attenuated ADAMTS1 mRNA expression but did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, VEGF mRNA expression was attenuated by SB203580 but not by LY294002 in hypoxic HUVEC (Fig. 5D). To confirm that the increase in ADAMTS1 mRNA was related to an increase in gene transcription, we used a luciferase construct in which the ADAMTS1 promoter (∼1.8 kb) was inserted into the luciferase gene. We amplified the 5′-flanking region of the ADAMTS1 gene (−1628 to +207) to the upstream of the luciferase reporter gene with specific primers (Fig. 6A). Sequence analysis of the 1.8-kb promoter region revealed that the ADAMTS1 promoter contains a TATA box-like sequence. Promoter data base analysis revealed the presence of several conserved HIF (a major regulatory factor of hypoxia-induced gene expression) binding elements in the construct. To determine which region is responsible for hypoxic induction of ADAMTS1, we prepared seven different constructs by deleting the ADAMTS1 gene (Fig. 6A), and secreted luciferase activity was measured in HUVEC under hypoxia (Fig. 6B). In normoxia, luciferase activity by the ADAMTS1 promoter was low compared with the pMetLuc-Control vector (Fig. 6C). HUVEC were cultured for a further 24 h under hypoxia, and we measured the luciferase activity again (Fig. 6D). Luciferase activity was normalized to the change of that in the pMetLuc-Control vector as 1.0 (Fig. 6E). Luciferase activities driven by −1628, −1493, −1271, −960, −706, and −451 bp of ADAMTS1 promoters were induced 2.6–4.6-fold under hypoxia, but deletion of the sequence between −451 and −342 bp a"

In the P. berghei γ-spz model, protection is linked to liver CD8+ T cells that express an effector/memory (TEM) phenotype, (CD44hiCD45RBloCD62Llo ), and produce IFN-γ. However, neither the antigen presenting cells (APC) that activate these CD8+ TEM cells nor the site of their induction have been fully investigated. Because conventional (c)CD8α+ DC (a subset of CD11c+ DC) are considered the major inducers of CD8+ T cells, in this study we focused primarily on cCD8α+ DC from livers of mice immunized with Pb γ-spz and asked whether the cCD8α+ DC might be involved in the activation of CD8+ TEM cells. We demonstrate that multiple exposures of mice to Pb γ-spz lead to a progressive and nearly concurrent accumulation in the liver but not the spleen of both the CD11c+NK1.1− DC and CD8+ TEM cells. Upon adoptive transfer, liver CD11c+NK1.1− DC from Pb γ-spz-immunized mice induced protective immunity against sporozoite challenge. Moreover, in an in vitro system, liver cCD8α+ DC induced naïve CD8+ T cells to express the CD8+ TEM phenotype and to secrete IFN-γ. The in vitro induction of functional CD8+ TEM cells by cCD8α+ DC was inhibited by anti-MHC class I and anti-IL-12 mAbs. These data suggest that liver cCD8α+ DC present liver-stage antigens to activate CD8+ TEM cells, the pre-eminent effectors against pre-erythrocytic malaria. These results provide important implications towards a design of anti-malaria vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2045601906,"Human meiotic crossovers mainly cluster into narrow hot spots that profoundly influence patterns of haplotype diversity and that may also affect genome instability and sequence evolution. Hot spots also seem to be ephemeral, but processes of hot-spot activation and their subsequent evolutionary dynamics remain unknown. We now analyze the life cycle of a recombination hot spot. Sperm typing revealed a polymorphic hot spot that was activated in cis by a single base change, providing evidence for a primary sequence determinant necessary, though not sufficient, to activate recombination. This activating mutation occurred roughly 70,000 y ago and has persisted to the present, most likely fortuitously through genetic drift despite its systematic elimination by biased gene conversion. Nonetheless, this self-destructive conversion will eventually lead to hot-spot extinction. These findings define a subclass of highly transient hot spots and highlight the importance of understanding hot-spot turnover and how it influences haplotype diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2003231937,"The anti-inflammatory activity of the phytoalexin resveratrol (RSV) was evaluated in C5 anaphylatoxin (C5a)-stimulated primary neutrophils and in a mouse model of acute peritonitis. Pretreatment of human and mouse neutrophils with RSV significantly blocked oxidative burst, leukocyte migration, degranulation, and inflammatory cytokine production. The anti-inflammatory activity of RSV was a function of inhibition of sphingosine kinase (SphK) activity (IC50 ~20μM) within 5 min of exposure, its membrane localization, and SphKl-mediated Ca2+ release. As an experimental control, the SphKl pharmacological inhibitor AAtdimethyl sphingosine (DMS) was used to compare the inhibitory effect of RSV. We also provide evidence that the SphK inhibitory effect of RSV was mediated via its ability to block phospholipase D (PLD) activity and membrane recruitment. Furthermore, RSV blocked ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which functioned independently of SphK1 in this study. To provide in vivo relevance to these data, C5a-induced model of acute peritonitis was established, and the effects of prior injection of RSV were investigated. Indeed, prior injection of RSV virtually completely attenuated the effects of C5a on vascular permeability, neutrophil migration, release of interleukin β, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 6, and the chemokine MIP-la. Taken together, these data demonstrate strong anti-inflammatory activity of RSV in vitro and in vivo and highlight SphK1 as a potential target of this remarkable phytoalexin. These data could have tremendous implications for the clinical use of RSV in inflammatory pathologies.— Issuree, P. D. A., Pushparaj, P. N., Pervaiz, S., Melendez, A J.

https://openalex.org/W2095949077,"Relationships among biochemical signaling processes involved in Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent phosphorylation of smooth muscle myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) were determined. A genetically-encoded biosensor MLCK for measuring Ca2+-dependent CaM binding and activation was expressed in smooth muscles of transgenic mice. We performed real-time evaluations of the relationships among [Ca2+]i, MLCK activation, and contraction in urinary bladder smooth muscle strips neurally stimulated for 3 s. Latencies for the onset of [Ca2+]i and kinase activation were 55 ± 8 and 65 ± 6 ms, respectively. Both increased with RLC phosphorylation at 100 ms, whereas force latency was 109 ± 3 ms. [Ca2+]i, kinase activation, and RLC phosphorylation responses were maximal by 1.2 s, whereas force increased more slowly to a maximal value at 3 s. A delayed temporal response between RLC phosphorylation and force is probably due to mechanical effects associated with elastic elements in the tissue. MLCK activation partially declined at 3 s of stimulation with no change in [Ca2+]i and also declined more rapidly than [Ca2+]i during relaxation. The apparent desensitization of MLCK to Ca2+ activation appears to be due to phosphorylation in its calmodulin binding segment. Phosphorylation of two myosin light chain phosphatase regulatory proteins (MYPT1 and CPI-17) or a protein implicated in strengthening membrane adhesion complexes for force transmission (paxillin) did not change during force development.

How these signaling pathways intersect the responses of the primary Ca2+/CaM pathway during physiological neural stimulation is not known. There is also evidence that smooth muscle contraction requires the polymerization of submembranous cytoskeletal actin filaments to strengthen membrane adhesion complexes involved in transmitting force between actin-myosin filaments and external force-transmitting structures (20.Gunst S.J.

In tracheal smooth muscle, paxillin at membrane adhesions undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to contractile stimulation by an agonist, and this phosphorylation increases concurrently with force development in response to agonist. Expression of nonphosphorylatable paxillin mutants in tracheal muscle suppresses acetylcholine-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, tension development, and actin polymerization without affecting RLC phosphorylation (24.Gunst S.J. Tang D.D. Opazo Saez A. Respir. Physiol. Neurobiol. 2003; 137: 151-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 25.Opazo Saez A. Zhang W. Wu Y. Turner C.E. Tang D.D. Gunst S.J. Am. J. Physiol.

Thus, paxillin phosphorylation may play an important role in tension development in smooth muscle independently of RLC phosphorylation and cross-bridge cycling. Specific models relating signaling mechanisms in the smooth muscle cell to contraction dynamics are limited when cells in tissues are stimulated slowly and asynchronously by agonist diffusing into the preparation. Field stimulation leading to the rapid release of neurotransmitters from nerves embedded in the tissue avoids these problems associated with agonist diffusion (26.Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Am. J. Physiol.

In urinary bladder smooth muscle, phasic contractions are brought about by the parasympathetic nervous system. Upon activation, parasympathetic nerve varicosities release the two neurotransmitters, acetylcholine and ATP, that bind to muscarinic and purinergic receptors, respectively. They cause smooth muscle contraction by inducing Ca2+ transients as elementary signals in the process of nerve-smooth muscle communication (28.Silinsky E.M. Redman R.S. J.

We recently reported the development of a genetically encoded, CaM-sensor for activation of MLCK.

Persechini A. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Upon dimerization, there is significant FRET from the donor enhanced cyan fluorescent protein to the acceptor enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. Ca2+/CaM binding dissociates the dimer resulting in a decrease in FRET intensity coincident with activation of kinase activity (31.Geguchadze R. Zhi G. Lau K.S. Isotani E. Persechini A. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, CaM-sensor MLCK is capable of directly monitoring Ca2+/CaM binding and activation of the kinase in smooth muscle tissues where it is expressed specifically in smooth muscle cells of transgenic mice. We therefore combined neural stimulation with real-time measurements of [Ca2+]i, MLCK activation, and force development in smooth muscle tissue from these mice. Additionally, RLC phosphorylation was measured precisely at specific times following neural stimulation in tissues frozen by a rapid-release electronic freezing device (26.Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Am. J.

Results from these studies reveal that physiological stimulation of smooth muscle cells by neurotransmitter release leads to rapid increases in [Ca2+]i, MLCK activation, and RLC phosphorylation at similar rates without the apparent activities of Ca2+-independent kinases, inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase, or paxillin phosphorylation. Thus, the elemental processes for phasic smooth muscle contraction are represented by this tightly coupled Ca2+ signaling complex. Transgenic mice with CaM-sensor MLCK expression specifically in smooth muscle tissues were bred and screened as previously described (6.Isotani E. Zhi G. Lau K.S. Huang J. Mizuno Y. Persechini A. Geguchadze R. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6279-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Expressed amounts of the MLCK CaM-sensor were less than 30% of the content of endogenous kinase and stresses generated by bladder strips from wild-type and transgenic animals were comparable (6.Isotani E. Zhi G. Lau K.S. Huang J. Mizuno Y. Persechini A. Geguchadze R. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6279-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Transgenic animals showed no obvious phenotypic differences from wild-type mice. All animal protocols were approved by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center IACUC. Mouse bladder tissues were obtained from 8–12-week-old transgenic mice expressing CaM-sensor MLCK or age-matched wild-type mice. Briefly, the urinary bladder was removed, opened, and urothelium removed by blunt dissection. The smooth muscle layer was dissected into longitudinal strips (0.5 × 0.5 × 8.0 mm) that were mounted on a fluorescence myograph (Scientific Instruments, Heidelberg, Germany) or an isometric force apparatus. Strips were equilibrated and stretched 1.2 times slack length. All protocols were performed in physiological salt solution (in mm: 118.5 NaCl, 4.75 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.2 KH2PO4, 24.9 NaHCO3, 1.6 CaCl2, 10.0 d-glucose, pre-gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 35 °C). Simultaneous measurements of force and FRET ratio or [Ca2+]i were made as previously described (6.Isotani E. Zhi G. Lau K.S. Huang J. Mizuno Y. Persechini A. Geguchadze R. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6279-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because of the potential for CaM-sensor fluorescence to interfere with the fluorescence of Indo-1 in muscle strips and the potential for overexpressed green fluorescent protein containing proteins to interfere with muscle contraction by interacting with myosin (32.Agbulut O. Huet A. Niederländer N. Puceat M. Menasché P. Coirault C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10465-10471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we determined that there was no difference in the latency of force development between wild-type and CaM-sensor transgenic mice (data not shown). These data are consistent with previous analyses on force development with the agonist carbachol and KCl (6.Isotani E. Zhi G. Lau K.S. Huang J. Mizuno Y. Persechini A. Geguchadze R. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6279-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). FRET ratio, [Ca2+]i, and force measurements were recorded on a Powerlab 8/SP data acquisition unit (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO). For FRET measurements, the muscle strips were illuminated with an excitation wavelength of 430 nm, and emission light was detected by two photomultipliers using 480- and 525-nm filters. The extent of MLCK activation was determined from the 480/525-nm emission ratio (FRET ratio) for strips electrically stimulated with conditions (50 Hz, 20 V, 0.5-ms duration) that induce maximal muscle contraction. Strips were stimulated at 5-min intervals for up to 20 times to collect data for signal averaging. Global intracellular calcium concentrations were measured by the Indo-1 fluorescence ratio in wild-type bladder strips as described previously (6.Isotani E. Zhi G. Lau K.S. Huang J. Mizuno Y. Persechini A. Geguchadze R. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6279-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Bladder smooth muscle strips were incubated in the dark with physiological salt solution containing 10 μm Indo-1 AM, 0.01% pluronic F-127, and 0.02% cremophor for 4 h at room temperature. After incubation, tissues were mounted in the fluorescence myograph and washed with fresh physiological salt solution for 30 min at 35 °C. Strips were illuminated at 365 nm and emission intensities were measured at 405 and 485 nm to obtain an emission ratio of 405 to 485 nm. Strips were stimulated as for FRET measurements. Fluorescence ratio data were analyzed over the course of a contraction-relaxation cycle with 50 Hz stimulation for 3 s followed by 12 s relaxation (Fig. 1). To improve signal-to-noise and retain temporal resolution, unfiltered signals were averaged (8–20 contractions from a single strip) after alignment to the initial stimulus pulse using a signal-averaging program written for Matlab. Latency for an increase in the fluorescence ratio was estimated as the time after stimulus initiation at which the signal no longer oscillated below the mean of the average resting value. Strips of bladder smooth muscle were dissected and mounted by silk thread to Grass FT03 force transducers for measurement of isometric force. Fine silver wire attached directly to the ends of the tissue allowed continuous field stimulation of the preparation between the time the organ bath was lowered and the tissue was frozen. After mounting, strips were equilibrated, stretched to optimal length, and pre-contracted with 65 mm KCl. Strips remained quiescent for at least 30 min and were frozen immediately following 0, 100, 250, 1200, or 3000 ms of 50 Hz electric field stimulation. Force development was recorded on a Powerlab 8/SP data acquisition unit (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO). Muscle strips were frozen with a rapid-release electronic freezing device with hammer surfaces pre-chilled in liquid nitrogen (33.Thompson C.I. Rubio R. Berne R.M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 1980; 238: H389-H398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the relaxation period, urinary bladder strips were frozen at 2, 5, 7, or 12 s after a 3-s electric field stimulation with the freezing device. Frozen samples were stored at −80 °C until they were added to a frozen slurry of acetone in 10% trichloroacetic acid, thawed, homogenized in 10% trichloroacetic acid and 10 mm dithiothreitol, and then centrifuged to process for protein phosphorylation measurements. Muscle proteins precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid and 10 mm dithiothreitol were solubilized in 8 m urea sample buffer and subjected to urea/glycerol-PAGE at 400 volts for 80 min (RLC) or 150 min (CPI-17) to separate non-phosphorylated and monophosphorylated protein forms (14.Mizuno Y.

Chem. 1989; 264: 21223-21229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with polyclonal antibodies against smooth muscle RLC or CPI-17. The ratio of monophosphorylated RLC or CPI-17 to total RLC or CPI-17 (nonphosphorylated plus monophosphorylated) was determined by quantitative densitometry and expressed as mole of phosphate/mol of protein. Protein samples prepared in urea sample buffer were added to 0.2 volumes of SDS sample buffer containing 250 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 40% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and visualized by immunoblot staining using antibodies to total MYPT1 and phospho-MYPT1 at Thr-696 or Thr-850 (Upstate, Waltham, MA); total MLCK (Sigma) and phospho-MLCK at Ser-1760 in the CaM-binding sequence (numbering for human MLCK sequence) (Invitrogen); and total paxillin (BD Biosciences) and phospho-paxillin at Tyr-118 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). The phosphorylation of MYPT1 and paxillin are expressed as a ratio relative to that obtained with tissues treated with 10 μm carbachol for 1 or 5 min, respectively, whereas MLCK phosphorylation is relative to results obtained with 65 mm KCl for 1 min. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed by paired Student's t test for [Ca2+]i, MLCK activation, and force development, independent t test for phosphorylation of RLC, CPI-17, MYPT1, paxillin, and MLCK. Two-tailed values were used and p values <0.05 were considered significant. Experiments were performed to optimize stimulus parameters such as strength, duration, or frequency for selective stimulation of intramural nerves in strips of mouse urinary bladder (26.Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1985; 249: C238-C247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Selected parameters were 20 V, 0.5 ms duration, 50 Hz direct current pulses to the muscle chamber to induce maximal contractile responses that were inhibited 57 ± 7% (n = 5) by the muscarinic antagonist 0.1 μm atropine. The neurally mediated contractile responses were inhibited 28 ± 5% (n = 5) with a combination of purinergic antagonists suramin and α,β-methylene ATP (10 μm each), whereas the addition of antagonists of both receptors inhibited contraction 93 ± 2% (n = 10). The contractile responses to neural stimulation were 1.45 ± 0.18 times the maximal response obtained with carbachol. These results are similar to previous reports on mouse bladder smooth muscle (29.Heppner T.J. Bonev A.D. Nelson M.T. J. Physiol. 2005; 564: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30.Werner M.E. Knorn A.M. Meredith A.L. Aldrich R.W. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2007; 292: R616-R624Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) indicating the robust neural responses are mediated by both muscarinic and purinergic receptors. For fluorescence studies and contractile measurements during neural stimulation, data were acquired continuously for 15 s. In Fig. 2A, the time for the onset of force development is illustrated in a typical tracing, whereas Fig. 2B shows contraction-relaxation responses over 15 s. Representative tracings of the Indo-1 ratio (F405/F485), FRET ratio (F480/F525), and force are shown in Fig. 2C. Measurements of neurally stimulated bladder smooth muscle strips demonstrated that [Ca2+]i and MLCK activation increased rapidly upon electric field stimulation, whereas force development lagged, reaching its maximal response more gradually (Fig. 2C). During the relaxation phase following a 3-s stimulation, MLCK activation declined faster than [Ca2+]i (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2C). Phosphorylation of RLC was measured in quick-frozen muscle samples at the indicated times by urea-glycerol PAGE (Fig. 2D). RLC phosphorylation was low in the nonstimulated bladder smooth muscle and increased rapidly with neural stimulation (0.11 ± 0.08 to 0.51 ± 0.06 mol of P/mol of RLC), consistent with the rapid MLCK activation. There were significant changes in [Ca2+]i, MLCK activation, and force within the first 250 ms of neural stimulation (Fig. 3). Latencies for the onset of [Ca2+]i and MLCK activation were not significantly different (p = 0.33) at 55 ± 8 and 65 ± 6 ms, respectively (indicated by arrows in Fig. 3). Both [Ca2+]i and MLCK activation increased rapidly following their respective latencies, and RLC phosphorylation was significantly elevated by 100 ms. Latency for the onset of force was significantly longer at 109 ± 3 ms. In addition, beyond the absolute latency, force increased considerably more slowly than RLC phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Delays due to coupling between [Ca2+]i and MLCK activation appear insignificant. [Ca2+]i, MLCK activation, and RLC phosphorylation responses continued to increase rapidly after 250 ms, reaching maximal values at 1.2 s (Fig. 4). [Ca2+]i and RLC phosphorylation remained at maximal values up to 3 s, whereas MLCK activation partially decreased. Isometric force developed more slowly, reaching a maximal value after 3 s of stimulation. The times required for one-half maximal responses for [Ca2+]i, MLCK activation, and RLC phosphorylation were similar (250 ms), whereas force development was slower (1200 ms). MYPT1 and CPI-17 phosphorylation play important roles in modulation of RLC phosphorylation and Ca2+ sensitization by inhibiting myosin light chain phosphatase activity (12.Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1325-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar, 14.Mizuno Y. Isotani E. Huang J. Ding H. Stull J.T. Kamm K.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C358-C364Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because MLCK activation decreased at 3 s without a significant decrease in RLC phosphorylation, we measured MYPT1Thr-696, MYPT1Thr-850, and CPI-17 phosphorylation (Fig. 5). We previously showed that treatment of mouse bladder tissues with 10 μm carbachol for 1 min significantly increased phosphorylation of MYPT1Thr-696 and CPI-17 (14.Mizuno Y. Isotani E. Huang J. Ding H. Stull J.T. Kamm K.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C358-C364Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used this treatment as a positive control for analysis. Compared with values obtained without neural stimulation, phosphorylation of MYPT1Thr-850 and CPI-17 did not change up to 3 s (Fig. 5). MYPT1Thr-696 did not change significantly until 3 s. However, in smooth muscle tissues that were stimulated an additional 2 s (5 s total) there were significant increases in MYPT1Thr-696 and MYPT1Thr-850 phosphorylation that were similar to values obtained with carbachol stimulation for 1 min (108 ± 15 and 79 ± 5%, respectively). There was no increase in CPI-17 phosphorylation at 5 s of neural stimulation (22 ± 2%). These data indicate that phosphorylations of MYPT1 and CPI-17 do not play a significant role in the initial contractile response of bladder smooth muscle to neural stimulation. Paxillin at membrane adhesions undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation concurrently with force development with agonist. This response is thought to play a role in the polymerization of submembranous cytoskeletal actin filaments that increases the rigidity of the membrane during tension development and allows force transmission of phosphorylated, cycling myosin cross-bridges (20.Gunst S.J. Zhang W. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C576-C587Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also measured paxillin phosphorylation in response to neural stimulation (Fig. 5). Relative to the phosphorylation response with carbachol, there was no significant increase in paxillin phosphorylation by 3 s of neural stimulation. After stimulating smooth muscle tissues for 3 s, responses were measured during the subsequent relaxation period; values were normalized to the values obtained at 3 s of stimulation (Fig. 6). The extent of MLCK activation declined rapidly, whereas [Ca2+]i declined more slowly. Force declined more slowly than RLC phosphorylation. Estimated half-times for decreases in [Ca2+]i, MLCK activation, and force during the relaxation phase from the continuous measurements were 2.6 ± 0.4, 0.7 ± 0.9, and 3.2 ± 0.6 s, respectively. The estimated half-time for RLC dephosphorylation is at least 1.2 s. Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of MLCK has been implicated in a Ca2+ desensitization mechanism by inhibiting Ca2+/CaM binding to the kinase (35.Stull J.T. Tansey M.G. Tang D.C. Word R.A. Kamm K.E.

https://openalex.org/W2003642703,"Mammalian Stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) is a glycoprotein that has been implicated in various biological processes including angiogenesis. Aberrant STC1 expression has been reported in breast, ovarian and prostate cancers, but the significance of this is not well understood. Here, we report that oxidative stress caused a 40-fold increase in STC1 levels in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). STC1−/− MEFs were resistant to growth inhibition and cell death induced by H2O2 or by 20% O2 (which is hyperoxic for most mammalian cells); this is the first phenotype reported for STC1-null cells. STC1−/− cells had higher levels of activated MEK and ERK1/2 than their wild-type (WT) counterparts, and these levels were all reduced by stable expression of exogenous STC1 in STC1−/− cells. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition by PD98059 or UO126 of MEK and therefore of ERK1/2 activation restored sensitivity of STC1−/− cells to oxidative stress. We also found that H2O2-induced STC1 expression in WT cells was abolished by inhibition of ERK1/2 activation. Thus, the ERK1/2 signaling pathway upregulates STC1 expression, which in turn downregulates the level of activated MEK and consequently ERK1/2 in a novel negative feedback loop. Therefore, STC1 expression downregulates prosurvival ERK1/2 signaling and reduces survival under conditions of oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2032169725,"Tumor suppressor p53 regulates the expression of p53-induced genes (PIG) that trigger apoptosis. PIG3 or TP53I3 is the only known member of the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily induced by p53 and is used as a proapoptotic marker. Although the participation of PIG3 in the apoptotic pathway is proven, the protein and its mechanism of action were never characterized. We analyzed human PIG3 enzymatic function and found NADPH-dependent reductase activity with ortho-quinones, which is consistent with the classification of PIG3 in the quinone oxidoreductase family. However, the activity is much lower than that of zeta-crystallin, a better known quinone oxidoreductase. In addition, we report the crystallographic structure of PIG3, which allowed the identification of substrate- and cofactor-binding sites, with residues fully conserved from bacteria to human. Tyr-59 in zeta-crystallin (Tyr-51 in PIG3) was suggested to participate in the catalysis of quinone reduction. However, kinetics of Tyr/Phe and Tyr/Ala mutants of both enzymes demonstrated that the active site Tyr is not catalytic but may participate in substrate binding, consistent with a mechanism based on propinquity effects. It has been proposed that PIG3 contribution to apoptosis would be through oxidative stress generation. We found that in vitro activity and in vivo overexpression of PIG3 accumulate reactive oxygen species. Accordingly, an inactive PIG3 mutant (S151V) did not produce reactive oxygen species in cells, indicating that enzymatically active protein is necessary for this function. This supports that PIG3 action is through oxidative stress produced by its enzymatic activity and provides essential knowledge for eventual control of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1981663871,"Osteopontin (OPN) is a cytokine and ligand for multiple members of the integrin family. OPN undergoes the in vivo polymerization catalyzed by cross-linking enzyme transglutaminase 2, which consequently increases the bioactivity through enhanced interaction with integrins. The integrin alpha9beta1, highly expressed on neutrophils, binds to the sequence SVVYGLR only after intact OPN is cleaved by thrombin. The SVVYGLR sequence appears to be cryptic in intact OPN because alpha9beta1 does not recognize intact OPN. Because transglutaminase 2-catalyzed polymers change their physical and chemical properties, we hypothesized that the SVVYGLR site might also be exposed on polymeric OPN. As expected, alpha9beta1 turned into a receptor for polymeric OPN, a result obtained by cell adhesion and migration assays with alpha9-transfected cells and by detection of direct binding of recombinant soluble alpha9beta1 with colorimetry and surface plasmon resonance analysis. Because the N-terminal fragment of thrombin-cleaved OPN, a ligand for alpha9beta1, has been reported to attract neutrophils, we next examined migration of neutrophils to polymeric OPN using time-lapse microscopy. Polymeric OPN showed potent neutrophil chemotactic activity, which was clearly inhibited by anti-alpha9beta1 antibody. Unexpectedly, mutagenesis studies showed that alpha9beta1 bound to polymeric OPN independently of the SVVYGLR sequence, and further, SVVYGLR sequence of polymeric OPN was cryptic because SVVYGLR-specific antibody did not recognize polymeric OPN. These results demonstrate that polymerization of OPN generates a novel alpha9beta1-binding site and that the interaction of this site with the alpha9beta1 integrin is critical to the neutrophil chemotaxis induced by polymeric OPN."

We and others have previously reported association between WNK1 and BP variation. Using tag SNPs (tSNPs) that capture 100% of common WNK1 variation in HapMap, we aimed to replicate our findings with BP and to test for association with phenotypes relating to WNK1 function in the British Genetics of Hypertension (BRIGHT) study case-control resource (1700 hypertensive cases and 1700 normotensive controls). We found multiple variants to be associated with systolic blood pressure, SBP (7/28 tSNPs min-p = 0.0005), diastolic blood pressure, DBP (7/28 tSNPs min-p = 0.002) and 24 hour urinary potassium excretion (10/28 tSNPs min-p = 0.0004). Associations with SBP and urine potassium remained significant after correction for multiple testing (p = 0.02 and p = 0.01 respectively). The major allele (A) of rs765250, located in intron 1, demonstrated the strongest evidence for association with SBP, effect size 3.14 mmHg (95%CI:1.23-4.9), DBP 1.9 mmHg (95%CI:0.7-3.2) and hypertension, odds ratio (OR: 1.3 [95%CI: 1.0-1.7]).We genotyped this variant in six independent populations (n = 14,451) and replicated the association between rs765250 and SBP in a meta-analysis (p = 7 x 10(-3), combined with BRIGHT data-set p = 2 x 10(-4), n = 17,851). The associations of WNK1 with DBP and EH were not confirmed. Haplotype analysis revealed striking associations with hypertension and BP variation (global permutation p<10(-7)). We identified several common haplotypes to be associated with increased BP and multiple low frequency haplotypes significantly associated with lower BP (>10 mmHg reduction) and risk for hypertension (OR<0.60). Our data indicates that multiple rare and common WNK1 variants contribute to BP variation and hypertension, and provide compelling evidence to initiate further genetic and functional studies to explore the role of WNK1 in BP regulation and EH."
https://openalex.org/W2021034116,"p53 is eliminated from K-Ras-mutated cancer cells through direct interaction with Snail. However, it is not achieved through proteasome-mediated degradation or transcriptional repression. Here we provide evidence that p53, binding with Snail, is exported from a K-Ras-mutated cell through a vesicle transport-like mechanism, independently using a p53-nuclear-exporting mechanism. Although we can detect p53 in culture media, a majority of p53 might be degraded by extracellular proteases. Thus, we can recover the secreted p53 in culture media by the inhibition of protease and endocytosis. In addition, a considerable amount of p53 is endocytosed by neighboring cells. As p53 resorption occurs in a K-Ras-dependent manner, treatment of recombinant p53 is detected in the whole-cell lysate of K-Ras-mutated cells, but not in that of wild-type cells. Using the property of p53, we can deliver the chemical (propidium iodine) into K-Ras mutated cells selectively. In contrast, Snail, a co-secreted protein with p53 in response to oncogenic K-Ras, shows resistance to endocytosis and protease, and results in remaining in the media. Thus, we can detect an autoantibody against Snail in the serum of a human cancer patient. Our finding can be used for a mutant K-Ras-specific anticancer drug delivery system and for the diagnosis of pancreatic, colon and lung cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2025886777,"c-Rel is a member of the Rel/NF-κB transcription factor family and is predominantly expressed in lymphoid and myeloid cells, playing a critical role in lymphocyte proliferation and survival. Persistent activation of the c-Rel signal transduction pathway is associated with allergies, inflammation, autoimmune diseases, and a variety of human malignancies. To explore the potential of targeting c-Rel as a therapeutic agent for these disorders, we designed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence c-Rel expression in vitro and in vivo. C-Rel-siRNA expression via a retroviral vector in a B cell tumor cell line leads to growth arrest and apoptosis of the tumor cells. Silencing c-Rel in primary B cells in vitro compromises their proliferative and survival response to CD40 activation signals, similar to the impaired response of c-Rel knockout B cells. Most important, in vivo silencing of c-Rel results in significant impairment in T cell-mediated immune responses to antigenic stimulation. Our study thus validates the efficacy of c-Rel-siRNA, and suggests the development of siRNA-based therapy, as well as small molecular inhibitors for the treatment of B cell tumors as well as autoimmune diseases."

Given that HSP60 is not a transmembrane protein, the mechanism by which these auto-Abs induces apoptosis is unclear. EC membrane proteins were analyzed using bidimensional electrophoresis and Far Western blot, and the HSP60 receptor was identified by mass spectrometry. Heat stress-dependent synthesis of HSP60 and receptor was examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR, and expression was examined by flow cytometry and indirect immunofluorescence. Interaction was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitations. Lipid rafts were purified to evaluate specific localization, and the apoptotic response was investigated by blocking monoclonal Ab. Mitochondrial HSP70 (mtHSP70) was identified as an HSP60 receptor. Stress was required for ECs to up-regulate mRNA and express mtHSP70 on their surface. HSP60 and mtHSP70 colocalized and interacted within lipid rafts. They were associated with chemokine CC motif receptor 5 (CCR5), also induced at the mRNA and protein levels in stressed ECs. CCR5 was involved in the anti-HSP60-triggered apoptosis of ECs. These results provide new insights into the mechanism by which anti-EC auto-Abs from vasculitides induce apoptosis of ECs."

Nerve terminals are generally considered to be the destination points for electrical signals, which propagate unidirectionally from the soma to nerve terminals. We found that small hyperpolarizations or depolarizations (∼10 mV) generated under physiological conditions in rat nerve terminals backpropagated up the axon (∼400–800 μm) and changed the threshold for initiating action potentials and thus firing patterns. These results suggest a mechanism for information processing in neurons and neuronal circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2066920752,"Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) belongs to the fold type I family of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme and forms 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (KDS) from l-serine and palmitoyl-CoA. Like other alpha-oxamine synthase subfamily enzymes, SPT is different from most of the fold type I enzymes in that its re face of the PLP-Lys aldimine is occupied by a His residue (His(159)) instead of an aromatic amino acid residue. His(159) was changed into alanine or aromatic amino acid residues to examine its role during catalysis. All mutant SPTs formed the PLP-l-serine aldimine with dissociation constants several 10-fold higher than that of the wild type SPT and catalyzed the abortive transamination of l-serine. These results indicate that His(159) is not only the anchoring site for l-serine but regulates the alpha-deprotonation of l-serine by fixing the conformation of the PLP-l-serine aldimine to prevent unwanted side reactions. Only H159A SPT retained activity and showed a prominent 505-nm absorption band of the quinonoid species during catalysis. Global analysis of the time-resolved spectra suggested the presence of the two quinonoid intermediates, the first formed from the PLP-l-serine aldimine and the second from the PLP-KDS aldimine. Accumulation of these quinonoid intermediates indicated that His(159) promotes both the Claisen-type condensation as an acid catalyst and the protonation at Calpha of the second quinonoid to form the PLP-KDS aldimine. These results, combined with the previous model building study (Ikushiro, H., Fujii, S., Shiraiwa, Y., and Hayashi, H. (2008) J. Biol.

This was demonstrated as follows: (i) chicken liver was excised and kept in sterile tubes for 1 to 3 hours at 37°C; (ii) this induced apoptosis (possibly because of oxygen deprivation), as shown by the electrophoretic nucleosomal ladder produced by DNA preparations; (iii) low molecular-weight DNA fragments (∼200 bp) were cloned, sequenced, and shown to derive predominantly from genes and surrounding 100 kb regions; (iv) a few hundred cuts were produced, very often involving the same chromosomal sites; (v) at comparable DNA degradation levels, micrococcal nuclease (MNase) also showed a general preference for genes and surrounding regions, but MNase cuts were located at sites that were quite distinct from, and less specific than, those cut by apoptosis. In conclusion, the approach presented here, which is the mildest and least intrusive approach, identifies a preferred accessibility landscape in interphase chromatin."

Chem. 2004; 279: 2507-2512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported that Oxa1 protein functions in the export of a single hydrophilic loop region that was artificially produced by ligating the C-terminal region of cytochrome b with cytochrome c oxidase subunit II and placed between TM segments. Direct interaction of Oxa1 with an immature subunit in complex V was observed during its biogenesis (19Jia L. Dienhart M.K. Stuart R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1897-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). So far, these studies have only been performed in yeast, and no information is available on the mechanism of topogenesis in mammals with regard to how Oxa1 is involved in the export of multiple regions in a protein molecule. Our in vivo study revealed that the correct topogenesis of Oxa1 in the MIM proceeds as a result of the cooperation of all five TMs and that the cooperation of TM1 and the species-conserved six-residue segment (GLPWWG) in the N-terminal flanking region is essential for export from the matrix of both the N-terminal segment and hydrophilic L2 into the IMS.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The following antibodies were obtained from the indicated sources: rabbit polyclonal antibodies against hemagglutinin (HA) tag (Covance, Berkeley, CA), mouse anti-T7 monoclonal antibody (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), and mouse monoclonal antibody against human Oxa1 (BD Biosciences). Rabbit anti-Tim23 and anti-Tim44 polyclonal antibodies were obtained as described previously (20Ishihara N. Mihara K. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Other chemicals were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan).Isolation of Rat Oxa1 Protein (rOxa1) cDNA—A cDNA of rOxa1 was isolated from a rat liver cDNA library using a reverse transcriptase based-method (SuperScript, Invitrogen). Oligonucleotides were designed according to a rat-expressed sequence tag data base. PCR products amplified with 5′-AAGCTTGCCACCATGGGTTCAGTTTGCCGTCGC-3′ and 5′-TCTAGAGCCGAGTGTGTCCTGCCACGGCTT-3′ were digested with HindIII/XbaI. The fragments were ligated into a HindIII/XbaI-digested mammalian expression vector, pRcCMV (Invitrogen). The amino acid homology of rOxa1 to other species was 35% (yeast), 65% (human), and 87% (mouse; supplemental Fig. 1).Modification of rOxa1 for Analyses of Mitochondrial Targeting Signal and N-terminal Export—All constructs with an HA tag at the C-terminal portion were generated using PCR and expressed in HeLa cells. To analyze the rOxa1 targeting signal, we constructed the following deletion proteins: rOxa1Δ(1–44) lacking amino acid residues 1–44, rOxa1Δ(1–64) lacking amino acid residues 1–64, rOxa1Δ(18–44) lacking amino acid residues 18–44, and rOxa1Δ(1–29) lacking amino acid residues 1–29. The T7 tag was introduced to the 70th amino acid from the N terminus of rOxa1 (70T7) to examine the N-terminal export to the IMS. The T7 tag was also inserted at amino acid residue 238 (238T7) to study translocation of the loop between TM2 and TM3 into the IMS.Construction of rOxa1-dihydrofolate Reductase or Green Fluorescent Protein Fusion Proteins—The following portions of rOxa1 were used to generate the fusion proteins (designated in parentheses): N-terminal residues 44 (N44), 100 (N100), 135 (N135), 144 (N144), 147 (N147), and 153 (N153) and transmembrane segment 1 (TM1), 1 and 2 (TM(1–2)), 1, 2, and 3 (TM(1–3)), 1, 2, 3, and 4 (TM(1–4)), and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (TM(1–5)). TM1 of the fusion construct was replaced with TM2 or TM3 to create fusion proteins TM2 and TM3, respectively. Each segment was amplified by PCR and fused with the folding incompetent (methotrexate-insensitive) dihydrofolate reductase-HA (21Vestweber D. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1147-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or green fluorescent protein.Glycine Scanning—Amino acid residues in the conserved “GLPWWG” region located in the N-terminal flanking region of TM1 were substituted with glycine using PCR to obtain D128G, L129G, L131G, P132G, W133G, W134G, A136G, and W133G/W134G.Analysis of Intracellular Localization of rOxa1 Using Fluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed to examine intracellular localization of rOxa1. Anti-calnexin antibody (Stressgen Biotechnologies, British Columbia, Canada) was used to identify the ER. Mitochondria were visualized with MitoTracker Red (Invitrogen). rOxa1-HA, rOxa1Δ(1–44), and rOxa1Δ(1–64) were detected by anti-HA antibody followed by a secondary fluorescein-labeled or Texas Red-labeled secondary antibody.Cell Fractionation and Protease Protection Experiments—After a 24-h incubation after transfection with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics), HeLa cell suspensions were homogenized by passing back and forth 15 times through a 27-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml syringe in homogenization buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, and protease inhibitor mixture, Complete (Roche Diagnostics)). Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation. For protease protection experiments, mitochondria (40 μg) were incubated in the presence or absence of digitonin (final concentrations, 0.08, 0.1, or 0.12%) or 1% Triton X-100 on ice for 10 min followed by the treatment of 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K on ice for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid. In the alkaline treatment experiment, mitochondria were incubated in 0.1 m Na2CO3 on ice for 30 min followed by ultracentrifugation to separate the supernatant and membrane fractions, which were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting. The filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies, and bands were detected with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences).Knockdown of Human Oxa1 in HeLa Cells—A double-stranded short inhibitory RNA (siRNA) targeting human Oxa1 protein (5′-CAACGCAUGCGGAAUCAGU-3′) was transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The protein expression was monitored 24 or 48 h after the transfection. For evaluation of the N-terminal export in the Oxa1 knockdown cells, N153 or 238T7 was transfected with FuGENE 6 24 h after siRNA (100 nm) introduction. The N-terminal export and the translocation of loop region L2 were examined 15 h after transfection.RESULTSSubmitochondrial Localization of rOxa1—Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that C-terminal HA-tagged rOxa1 (rOxa1-HA) expressed in HeLa cells colocalized with MitoTracker Red (supplemental Fig. 2). Comparison of SDS-PAGE mobility of in vivo and in vitro expressed forms revealed that rOxa1-HA is synthesized as a preprotein with a size ∼6.8 kDa higher than that of the mature form (Fig. 1B). The construct in which the N-terminal 64-residue segment of rOxa1-HA was deleted, rOxa1Δ(1–64), had the same mobility as HeLa cell-expressed rOxa1-HA on SDS-PAGE, suggesting that the processing point was likely located between amino acid residues 64 and 65 (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2).The matrix-targeting signal-truncated versions rOxa1-HA, rOxa1Δ(1–44), and rOxa1Δ(1–64) failed in mitochondrial localization and showed an ER distribution, indicating that TMs present in the mature domain act as ER-targeting and insertion signals (supplemental Fig. 2) whose function was suppressed by the N-terminal presequence, as is the case for ABCme, a half ABC transporter of MIM (22Miyazaki E. Kida Y. Mihara K. Sakaguchi M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1788-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To examine submitochondrial localization, the mitochondria were isolated from HeLa cells and treated with proteinase K in low concentrations of digitonin. The 41-kDa rOxa1-HA band was shifted to 33 kDa in the presence of 0.08–0.10% digitonin (Fig. 1D, lanes 1–3). Under this condition, Tim23, which is embedded in the MIM through four hydrophobic TMs, extruding a bulk N-terminal segment to the IMS, was degraded by the protease (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3), indicating that the MOM was permeabilized. A matrix marker, Tim44, on the other hand, was protected from protease treatment under these conditions, indicating that the MOM was specifically permeabilized by 0.08- 0.1% digitonin, whereas the MIM remained intact (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3). The 33-kDa band was completely digested by proteinase K under 1% Triton X-100 (lane 5). These results indicated that mature rOxa1-HA was embedded in the MIM extruding the N-terminal segment to the IMS. The endogenously expressed human Oxa1 (Oxa1Hs) produced a similar protease protection pattern (Fig. 1D). Because mitochondria-imported rOxa1-HA was resistant to alkaline extraction, it was firmly inserted into the MIM (supplemental Fig. 3A, lanes 7 and 8). To analyze membrane orientation of the N-terminal segment of mature Oxa1, a T7 tag was introduced in the N terminus near TM1 of rOxa1-HA (70T7; Fig. 1A). Proteinase K treatment of mitochondria harboring 70T7 produced an HA-positive, but T7-negative, 33-kDa band under low digitonin concentrations (Fig. 1E, lanes 3–5). Together, these findings indicate that the N-terminal portion (71 residues) of mammalian Oxa1 was exposed to the mitochondrial IMS, whereas the C-terminal segment localized in the matrix. Hereafter, the proteinase K-resistant band produced by proteinase K after permeabilization of the MOM was monitored as a measure of MIM integration of Oxa1 constructs in the correct orientation.Mitochondrial Targeting Signal of rOxa1—Fluorescence microscopy of fusion proteins comprising various lengths of the N-terminal portion of rOxa1 and green fluorescent protein revealed that the N-terminal 45 amino acids functioned as a mitochondrial targeting signal in rOxa1 (data not shown). To analyze the signal in more detail, the N-terminal 45-amino acid residue segment was partially deleted to generate rOxa1Δ(18–44) and rOxa1Δ(1–29) (supplemental Fig. 3). Both constructs expressed in HeLa cells were imported into mitochondria with lower efficiency compared with intact rOxa1, and a significant amount of the unprocessed form was detected in the post-mitochondrial supernatant and mitochondrial fractions, although rOxa1Δ(18–44) underwent efficient matrix targeting signal (MTS) processing by mitochondrial processing peptidase compared with rOxa1Δ(1–29) (supplemental Fig. 3A). Both constructs produced a mature protein band of 41 kDa, as did wild-type rOxa1-HA, indicating that the processing occurred at the same site as in the Oxa1 precursor, irrespective of the length of the MTS. The precursors of both constructs were sensitive to the externally added proteinase K (supplemental Fig. 3A, lanes 10, 11, 18, and 19), and a significant fraction was resistant to alkali extraction (lanes 15, 16, 23, and 24), indicating that translocation of both constructs was partially halted, thereby exposing the bulk portion to the cytoplasmic side. Moreover, rOxa1Δ(1–29) exhibited lower export efficiency of the N-terminal segment of the mature protein compared with rOxa1Δ(18–44) (supplemental Fig. 3B). Of note, rOxa1Δ(1–44) recovered in the mitochondrial fraction was completely degraded by externally added proteinase K (supplemental Fig. 3A, lanes 26 and 27). These findings indicated that the mitochondrial-targeting signal of rOxa1 was within the N-terminal 45-residue region that was composed of two potentially active segments, both of which were necessary for efficient import into the mitochondria. Notably, these results also indicate that the processing efficiency of the signal limits the export of the N-terminal portion of mature Oxa1.All Five TMs Are Required for Efficient Integration of rOxa1 into the MIM—To analyze the regions responsible for rOxa1 topogenesis, various lengths of the N-terminal rOxa1 regions were fused to a reporter protein dihydrofolate reductase-HA, expressed in HeLa cells, and their intra-mitochondrial localization was analyzed by proteinase K digestion (Fig. 2A). These experiments revealed that the MTS in N100, N135, and N144 was efficiently processed and the mature proteins were translocated into the matrix (Fig. 2B). In the case of proteins containing the regions downstream from TM1 to TM4, approximately half of the fraction of each construct successfully integrated into the MIM in the correct topology, exposing the N-terminal region into the IMS and the C-terminal region in the matrix, whereas the other fraction was completely translocated from the MIM into the matrix (Fig. 2, B and C). In striking contrast, efficient N-terminal export and membrane integration were observed for the fusion protein containing all five TMs (Fig. 2, B–D). Furthermore, the extent of membrane integration as assessed by alkali extraction was significantly lower for the constructs carrying incomplete sets of TMs compared with the constructs with a full set of the TMs (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results indicated that all five TMs were required for the complete translocation of the N terminus into the IMS and the membrane integration of the remainder of the segment.FIGURE 2Examination of submitochondrial localization of rOxa1-dihydrofolate reductase fusion proteins.

We, therefore, examined the involvement of this region for the N-terminal export. Constructs with deletions of this region, TM1Δ(130–135) and rOxa1Δ(130–135) (Fig. 3A), were efficiently imported into the matrix but failed to export the N-terminal segment into the IMS (Fig. 3B, lanes 2, 3, 8, and 9); thus, transported constructs seemed to be weakly associated to the inner membrane because they were partially susceptible to alkali extraction (lanes 5, 6, 11, and 12). The TM1-deleted rOxa1 also had severe export deficiency that was similar to the hexapeptide-deleted constructs (Fig. 3B, lanes 2, 3, 8, 9, 14, and 15), whereas deletion of the other TMs resulted in milder inhibition of the export (Fig. 2, B–D). Together, these results clearly indicated that the hexapeptide and the region near TM1 are both essential for the IMS export of the N-terminal region and correct membrane integration of rOxa1. Considering that in rOxa1Δ(TM1) the hexapeptide is localized away from TM2, the hexapeptide seems to function only when located in the vicinity of TMs (see below).FIGURE 3Glycine-scanning experiments in the conserved GLPWWG region.

Glycine substitution at Leu-131, Trp-133, and Trp-134 impaired the N-terminal export activity (Fig. 3C, lanes 13–15 and 19–24, and D), and substitution of both Trp-133—Trp-134 with glycine (W133G, W134G) drastically inhibited N-terminal export (Fig. 3, C, lanes 4–6, and D). The W133G-W134G construct was also extracted with alkaline to the same extent as observed in the hexapeptide-deleted constructs TM1Δ(130–135) and rOxa1Δ(130–135) (data not shown). Glycine substitution of the amino acid residue in TM1 did not affect the N-terminal export activity (Fig. 3C, lanes 25–27, and D). These results indicated that LXWW in the hexapeptide sequence is critical for the export activity.The Hexapeptide Functions as a General N-terminal Export Signal in the N-terminal Vicinity of an Appropriate TM—To examine whether the hexapeptide sequence affects topogenic function of TMs other than TM1 in Oxa1, N-terminal export was investigated for constructs in which the TM1 segment (mean hydrophobicity, 2.2) in the reporter (see Fig. 2A) was replaced with TM2 or TM3 (mean hydrophobicity 2.1 and 1.9, respectively; Fig. 4A). In the original context, TM2 and TM3 assume a Nin-Cout and Nout-Cin topology in the inner membrane, respectively. When TM1 was replaced with TM2 or TM3, N-terminal export was essentially supported (Fig. 4B, lanes 7–9 and 13–15). In contrast, when the hexapeptide was deleted from the constructs, the export activity was compromised (lanes 10–12 and 16–18), thereby suggesting that the species-conserved hexapeptide, when appended to the N terminus near an appropriate TM, cooperates with the TM to function as the N-terminal export signal irrespective of the TM authentic orientation in the original context.FIGURE 4Effect of the hexapeptide sequence on the N-terminal export of TM2 and TM3.

To examine the translocation of the loop region along with the N-terminal export, the T7 tag was introduced into the middle of L2 (238T7; Fig. 5A). Mitochondria harboring 238T7 produced a major 25-kDa band when treated with proteinase K under the MOM-permeabilized condition; the size of the band corresponded to the fragment containing the segment downstream from TM3, clearly indicating that the loop region was exposed to the IMS (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 3). The hexapeptide mutant, 238T7(W133G,W134G), however, did not produce the 25-kDa band, indicating that mutation also compromised the translocation of the loop region (Fig. 5B, lanes 8 and 9). These findings indicated that translocation of the loop region occurred concurrently with the N-terminal export, a mode that supports the deduced mechanism in which all five TMs are integrated as a block coupled with IMS export of the N-terminal segment (see Fig. 2).FIGURE 5Intermembrane segment export of the short loop between TM2 and TM3 using T7-tag insertion constructs.

When it is produced in excess by cancers it can cause hypercalcemia, and its local production by breast cancer cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of bone metastasis formation in that disease. Antibodies have been developed that neutralize the action of PTHrP through its receptor, parathyroid hormone receptor 1, without influencing parathyroid hormone action through the same receptor. Such neutralizing antibodies against PTHrP are therapeutically effective in animal models of the humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy and of bone metastasis formation. We have determined the crystal structure of the complex between PTHrP (residues 1–108) and a neutralizing monoclonal anti-PTHrP antibody that reveals the only point of contact is an α-helical structure extending from residues 14–29. Another striking feature is that the same residues that interact with the antibody also interact with parathyroid hormone receptor 1, showing that the antibody and the receptor binding site on the hormone closely overlap. The structure explains how the antibody discriminates between the two hormones and provides information that could be used in the development of novel agonists and antagonists of their common receptor.

Winslow G.A. Wettenhall R.E. Hammonds R.G. Moseley J.M. Difenbach-Jagger H. Rodda C.P. Kemp B.E. Rodriquez H. Chen E.Y. Hudson P.J. Martin T.J. Wood W.I. Science. 1987; 237: 893-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). It revealed PTHrP as a previously unrecognized hormone, related in evolution to the calcium-regulating PTH, but important in the pathogenesis of the humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, a syndrome in which hypercalcemia occurs without evident bone metastases. Whereas PTH consists of 84 amino acids, human PTHrP has three alternative splice products of 139, 141, and 173 residues. Apart from 8 of the first 13 residues of PTH and PTHrP being identical, there is no significant identity between these peptides (2.Moseley J.M. Gillespie M.T. CRC Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1995; 32: 299-343Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PTHrP actively promotes bone resorption, doing so in a manner identical to that of PTH by acting upon the receptor (PTH1R) it shares with PTH. The PTH1R is located on cells of the osteoblast lineage, which program the formation and activation of osteoclasts, and on cells of the kidney tubule, through which both PTHrP and PTH promote cyclic AMP and phosphorus excretion but reduce calcium excretion. Other actions of PTHrP that reflect those of PTH include the ability to relax vascular and other smooth muscle. This response may reflect a physiological function of PTHrP rather than of PTH and is consistent with PTHrP production and local action on smooth muscles at various sites (3.Clemens T.L. Cormier S. Eichinger A. Endlich K. Fiaschi-Taesch N. Fischer E. Friedman P.A. Karaplis A.C. Massfelder T. Rossert J. Schlüter K.D. Silve C. Stewart A.F. Takane K. Helwig J.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 1113-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).The first 34 amino acids of each hormone contain the full biological activities of both PTH and of PTHrP to activate the PTH1R (4.Mannstadt M. Jüppner H. Gardella T.J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1999; 277: 665-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of PTHrP and PTH between residues 14 and 34 are interesting in that, although they are not homologous, nevertheless they appear to be critical for binding of each to the seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor, PTH1R (4.Mannstadt M. Jüppner H. Gardella T.J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1999; 277: 665-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the first 34 amino acids of PTH and PTHrP two functional regions have been revealed based on structural and cross-linking studies (5.Barden J.A. Kemp B.E. Eur. J.

These studies have indicated that the C-terminal half of the first 34 residues of each hormone comprises the high affinity binding domain, interacting with the N-terminal portion of the extracellular domain of the receptor. The N-terminal half of each hormone activates the receptor through contact points on the extracellular loops and juxtamembrane regions (9.Bergwitz C. Gardella T.J. Flannery M.R. Potts Jr., J.T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26469-26472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Despite their equal ability to activate through the PTH1R, it was clear from the earliest work, even with antibodies against peptides within the first 14 residues of PTHrP, that highly specific antibodies could be generated that discriminate between PTH and PTHrP (10.Moseley J.M. Kubota M. Diefenbach-Jagger H. Wettenhall R.E. Kemp B.E. Suva L.J. Rodda C.P. Ebeling P.R. Hudson P.J. Zajac J.D. Martin T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Likewise, polyclonal antibodies against PTHrP-(1–34) that neutralized its effects completely in vitro in promotion of cyclic AMP production in response to PTHrP without any detectable neutralizing effect on PTH were used to prevent and to treat hypercalcemia in nude mice bearing xenografts of PTHrP-secreting human cancers (11.Kukreja S.C.

Similar results were obtained with a neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody against PTHrP (13.Sato K. Yamakawa Y. Shizume K. Satoh T. Nohtomi K. Demura H. Akatsu T. Nagata N. Kasahara T. Ohkawa H. Ohsumi K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Subsequently, after the finding that breast cancer metastases to bone were enriched in PTHrP production (14.Powell G.J. Southby J. Danks J.A. Stillwell R.G. Hayman J.A. Henderson M.A. Bennett R.C.

Hypertens. 1996; 5: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) used an experimental model in nude mice in which human breast cancer cells grow as lytic deposits in bone after intracardiac injection and showed that PTHrP production by the cancers contributed to the process of tumor establishment and growth in bone by promoting osteoclast formation and bone resorption. Furthermore, the tumor establishment and growth in bone could be prevented by treating the mice with a monoclonal antibody against PTHrP (16.Guise T.A. Yin J.J. Taylor S.D. Kumagai Y. Dallas M. Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1544-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) or with a bisphosphonate (17.Yoneda T. Michigami T. Yi B. Williams P.J. Niewolna M. Hiraga T. Cancer. 2000; 88: 2979-2988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to inhibit bone resorption.The efficacy of anti-PTHrP antibodies in treating both humoral-mediated hypercalcemia in cancer and bone metastasis formation and growth in mouse models raises the prospect of humanized forms of these antibodies being used as therapeutic agents in these diseases in human subjects, and preclinical data have been obtained in support of that (18.Saito H. Tsunenari T. Onuma E. Sato K. Ogata E. Yamada-Okabe H. Anticancer Res. 2005; 25: 3817-3823PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Onuma E. Tsunenari T. Saito H. Sato K. Yamada-Okabe H. Ogata E. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 116: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). With that in mind, the present project was undertaken in which we have made use of a monoclonal antibody prepared against human PTHrP (residues 1–34), which neutralizes the actions of PTHrP through PTH1R without any action against PTH. The antibody has been complexed with recombinant human PTHrP (residues 1–108) to generate crystals that have been used to analyze the three-dimensional structure with the aim of discovering the structural basis of neutralization of PTHrP action by the antibody.DISCUSSIONThe biological assay data confirm the selectivity of the monoclonal antibody for PTHrP and not PTH and the capacity of this antibody to neutralize the effects of PTHrP both in vitro and in vivo. The mouse antibody used in this work was used to develop humanized forms, with no significant differences among these molecules in inhibiting PTHrP action in vitro or cancer-induced hypercalcemia in vivo (26.Onuma E. Sato K. Saito H. Tsunenari T. Ishii K. Esaki K. Yabuta N. Wakahara Y. Yamada-Okabe H. Ogata E. Anticancer Res. 2004; 24: 2665-2674PubMed Google Scholar). The KD for binding of antibody to PTHrP-(1–34) was calculated at 1.02 × 10−10 m, and the epitope for binding was shown to be between residues 20 and 30, with some contribution from residues 15–20 (26.Onuma E. Sato K. Saito H. Tsunenari T. Ishii K. Esaki K. Yabuta N. Wakahara Y. Yamada-Okabe H. Ogata E. Anticancer Res. 2004; 24: 2665-2674PubMed Google Scholar). The region between residues 14 and 34 of PTH has been shown to be responsible for binding to the PTH1R (31.Gardella T.J. Wilson A.K. Keutmann H.T. Oberstein R. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg M. Nussbaum S.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2024-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), although all residues between 1 and 34 of the native (1–34) sequences of PTH and PTHrP are required for full signaling. Several substitutions in shorter analogs have yielded peptides with substantial activity, some with virtually full agonist activity (32.Shimizu M. Carter P.H. Khatri A. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3068-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the neutralizing antibody described here specifically recognizes and complexes with residues 14–31 even though a much larger form of the molecule, PTHrP-(1–108), has been presented to it in the crystallization studies. We saw no electron density for the hormone beyond residue 31, indicating the rest of the molecule is highly mobile. NMR studies of longer length PTHrP show that the hormone adopts little, if any, regular structure beyond this region in solution 7J. A. Barden, unpublished results. in accord with our results.A number of studies have identified specific residues of PTHrP involved in receptor binding. Arg-20 and Leu-24 are the only two residues that are strictly conserved among PTH/PTHrP sequences in the C-terminal region (between residues 14 and 31) (Fig. 3). Bearing in mind that PTH and PTHrP bind to the same receptor, these positions are then most likely important for receptor binding. In the crystal structure Arg-20 and Leu-24 make extensive interactions with the antibody. Residues Phe-23, Leu-24, and Ile-28 are intolerant to substitution by polar residues (31.Gardella T.J. Wilson A.K. Keutmann H.T. Oberstein R. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg M. Nussbaum S.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2024-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33.Gardella T.J.

Photo-affinity cross-linking experiments of all residues between 22 and 35 suggest that Phe-23, Leu-27, and Ile-28 are positioned close to the receptor, and photolabeling of Leu-24 caused a 10-fold reduction in receptor binding (8.Gensure R.C. Gardella T.J. Jüppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28650-28658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All three residues form extensive van der Waals interactions with the antibody. On the other hand residues Lys-26, Gln-29, and Asp-30 of PTH can be mutated without effect on receptor binding (34.Gardella T.J. Luck M.D. Wilson A.K. Keutmann H.T. Nussbaum S.R. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6584-6588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Studies of PTH/PTHrP chimeras have led to the identification of sites of receptor binding at position 19 of PTH that are incompatible (34.Gardella T.J. Luck M.D. Wilson A.K. Keutmann H.T. Nussbaum S.R. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6584-6588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Position 19 in PTHrP is an arginine, whereas in PTH it is a glutamate. In the crystal structure Arg-19 is in hydrogen bonding distance of the hydroxyl of Tyr-31 of the light chain and forms a salt bridge with Asp-96 and is immediately adjacent to Arg-20 that appears to be playing a critical role in mediating 4 hydrogen bonds with the antibody. In PTHrP Glu-30 forms hydrogen bonds to the side chain hydroxyl of Ser-52 and the backbone of Gly-54, both of the heavy chain. It is easy to envisage that replacement of Glu-30 by aspartic acid in PTH (Fig. 3) could readily retain these interactions through use of a bound water molecule. All these observations suggest that the interaction surface of PTHrP used by the neutralizing antibody is the same surface used by the hormone in interacting with its receptor.The region between residues 15 and 34 of either hormone contains the principal determinants of binding to the receptor, and indeed such a fragment can inhibit binding of either natural ligand (34.Gardella T.J. Luck M.D. Wilson A.K. Keutmann H.T. Nussbaum S.R. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6584-6588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that either hormone binds to the same location on the receptor despite bearing only two identical residues. A helical wheel analysis of the PTHrP structure (Fig. 3) provides a molecular explanation for this puzzle; one face of the helix is more conserved (four strictly conserved or conservative substitutions), and it is residues from this face that interact with antibody or receptor. Thus, we propose that the conformation of this region when bound to the receptor is likely to remain α-helical as seen in the structure here.In support of this hypothesis is the recently published crystal structure of PTH (residues 15–34) bound to the extracellular domain of the human PTH1 receptor (35.Pioszak A.A. Xu H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 5034-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The structure reveals that PTH binds as a single continuous helix into a hydrophobic groove formed by a three-layer α-β-βα-fold. The “hot dog in a bun” analogy used by the authors is reminiscent of the way that PTHrP is recognized by the neutralizing antibody described here. Although the secondary structural elements used to recognize hormone are very different between receptor and antibody, there are a number of similarities. In both cases ∼900 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area is buried on hormone binding, and the surface complementarity fits (36.Lawrence M.C. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar) are very similar (data not shown). The receptor structure confirms that the antibody does recognize the same surface of the hormone that the receptor uses. A number of PTH residues (Val-21, Trp-23, Leu-24, Leu-28, Val-31) form a hydrophobic face on the helix that interacts with the hydrophobic groove of PTH1R, anchored by polar interactions at the N and C termini of the PTH fragment. In a similar manner, PTHrP is recognized by its monoclonal antibody. The equivalent core residues in PTHrP (Phe-23, Leu-24, Ile-28) interact with a hydrophobic pocket in the antibody (Fig. 1c). PTH residue Arg-20, completely buried in the complex structure, forms salt bridges and hydrogen bonds to the receptor as the same residue in PTHrP does with the antibody (Fig. 1b). It should be noted that the side chains of conserved residues Arg-20 and Leu-24 adopt different conformations in the different hormone complex structures.PTH and PTHrP are equally well recognized by the same PTH1 receptor. The only data of which we are aware concerning the relative affinities of PTH and PTHrP for the PTH1R were based on receptor binding and fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based kinetic analysis (37.Dean T. Vilardaga J.-P. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 38.Dean T. Linglart A. Mahon M.J. Bastepe M. Jüppner H. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These indicated that PTH-(1–34) bound more strongly than PTHrP-(1–36) to a high affinity conformational state of the PTH1R and, furthermore, that mutation of His-5 to Ile-5 in PTHrP-(1–36) resulted in receptor interaction indistinguishable from that of PTH-(1–34). Given the bulkiness of antibodies, the binding site of a neutralizing antibody toward PTHrP need not overlap with the receptor binding site to achieve the selectivity toward PTHrP and still interfere with the receptor binding. Nevertheless, the binding site in our structure of PTHrP-(1–108) in complex with the selective neutralizing antibody closely overlaps the binding site to the receptor. We can now begin to consider the molecular basis by which certain antibodies discriminate between PTHrP and PTH. The consistent finding that antibodies can readily be prepared against PTHrP that do not recognize PTH, even in great excess, has been very helpful in the development of discriminatory plasma assays and in the study of tissue distribution of PTHrP using immunohistology (2.Moseley J.M. Gillespie M.T. CRC Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1995; 32: 299-343Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The same specificity has been applied to a number of polyclonal antisera that have been used in vivo (12.Kukreja S.C. Shevrin D.H. Wimbiscus S.A. Ebeling P.R. Danks J.A. Rodda C.P. Wood W.I. Martin T.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 82: 1798-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 39.Henderson M.A. Danks J.A. Slavin J. Byrnes G.B. Choong P.M.F. Spillane J.B. Hopper J.L. Martin T. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2250-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and to the monoclonal antibodies used by Sato et al. (13.Sato K. Yamakawa Y. Shizume K. Satoh T. Nohtomi K. Demura H. Akatsu T. Nagata N. Kasahara T. Ohkawa H. Ohsumi K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and Guise et al. (16.Guise T.A. Yin J.J. Taylor S.D. Kumagai Y. Dallas M. Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1544-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Such discrimination would be essential for an antibody to be used therapeutically because as the excess PTHrP is neutralized and serum calcium returns to normal, the suppressed PTH level rises, and normal physiological controls return. It is worth noting in this regard that a neutralizing antibody is aimed at preventing the deleterious effect of excess PTHrP, acting on the skeleton generally and on the kidney to cause the humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. On the other hand PTH plays an important role in normal calcium homeostasis and, additionally, acts as an extremely effective anabolic therapy on the skeleton when administered by daily injection to subjects with osteoporosis (40.Neer R.M. Arnaud C.D. Zanchetta J.R. Prince R. Gaich G.A. Reginster J.Y. Hodsman A.B. Eriksen E.F. Ish-Shalom S. Genant H.K. Wang O. Mitlak B.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1434-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (3824) Google Scholar). Thus, structural information concerning molecular mechanisms of inhibition of PTHrP-receptor interaction can usefully complement other studies of the detailed interaction of both ligands with PTH1R.There are a number of factors that explain how the antibody discriminates between PTHrP and PTH even though they are both recognized by the same receptor. First, we superimposed the PTHrP structure onto the PTH1-receptor complex structure (data not shown). We find that PTHrP docks well into the ligand binding groove of the receptor as might be expected, with PTH possessing an extra turn of helix at its C-terminal end. We then superimposed the two complex structures, which reveals that the extra turn of helix in PTH sterically clashes with a complementarity-determining region of the antibody, providing a compelling explanation for the antibody specificity. Another factor could be related to residue 23 that is a phenylalanine in PTHrP but a tryptophan in PTH. The phenylalanine residue is located in a tight hydrophobic pocket of the antibody made up of residue Tyr-59 of the heavy chain and Thr-97 and Phe-102 of the light chain (Fig. 1c). A tryptophan residue would be too bulky to fit in this pocket without local readjustments. Modeling based on the PTH-PTH1R structures suggests the side chain would clash with Tyr-104 of the antibody heavy chain. In addition, the substitution of Leu-27 in PTHrP by a lysine residue in PTH would contribute to the disruption of the hydrophobic pocket as its side chain is immediately adjacent to the side chain of Phe-23 (Fig. 1c). Conversely, in the PTH-receptor structure Leu-27 superimposes with the aliphatic portion of the lysine residue, thus maintaining key van der Waals interactions with the receptor.A means of antagonizing the deleterious effects of PTHrP in contributing to the skeletal complications of cancer could be an attractive therapeutic approach even bearing in mind the possibility of actions of PTHrP at earlier stages of cancer that could impair invasion (39.Henderson M.A. Danks J.A. Slavin J. Byrnes G.B. Choong P.M.F. Spillane J.B. Hopper J.L. Martin T. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2250-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 41.Bakre M.M. Zhu Y. Yin H. Burton D.W. Terkeltaub R. Deftos L.J. Varner J.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The first step in evaluating this possibility is the use of humanized monoclonal anti-PTHrP. What could be even more attractive is the prospect of using the structural information obtained from analysis of the PTHrP-antibody complex together with that obtained from other approaches to ligand structure and interaction with receptor to design small molecule mimetics of the antibody or mimetics of PTHrP that would compete for receptor binding without causing signaling.

It revealed PTHrP as a previously unrecognized hormone, related in evolution to the calcium-regulating PTH, but important in the pathogenesis of the humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, a syndrome in which hypercalcemia occurs without evident bone metastases. Whereas PTH consists of 84 amino acids, human PTHrP has three alternative splice products of 139, 141, and 173 residues. Apart from 8 of the first 13 residues of PTH and PTHrP being identical, there is no significant identity between these peptides (2.Moseley J.M. Gillespie M.T. CRC Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1995; 32: 299-343Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PTHrP actively promotes bone resorption, doing so in a manner identical to that of PTH by acting upon the receptor (PTH1R) it shares with PTH. The PTH1R is located on cells of the osteoblast lineage, which program the formation and activation of osteoclasts, and on cells of the kidney tubule, through which both PTHrP and PTH promote cyclic AMP and phosphorus excretion but reduce calcium excretion. Other actions of PTHrP that reflect those of PTH include the ability to relax vascular and other smooth muscle. This response may reflect a physiological function of PTHrP rather than of PTH and is consistent with PTHrP production and local action on smooth muscles at various sites (3.Clemens T.L. Cormier S. Eichinger A. Endlich K. Fiaschi-Taesch N. Fischer E. Friedman P.A. Karaplis A.C. Massfelder T. Rossert J. Schlüter K.D. Silve C. Stewart A.F. Takane K. Helwig J.J. Br. J.

The first 34 amino acids of each hormone contain the full biological activities of both PTH and of PTHrP to activate the PTH1R (4.Mannstadt M. Jüppner H. Gardella T.J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1999; 277: 665-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of PTHrP and PTH between residues 14 and 34 are interesting in that, although they are not homologous, nevertheless they appear to be critical for binding of each to the seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor, PTH1R (4.Mannstadt M. Jüppner H. Gardella T.J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1999; 277: 665-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the first 34 amino acids of PTH and PTHrP two functional regions have been revealed based on structural and cross-linking studies (5.Barden J.A. Kemp B.E. Eur. J.

These studies have indicated that the C-terminal half of the first 34 residues of each hormone comprises the high affinity binding domain, interacting with the N-terminal portion of the extracellular domain of the receptor. The N-terminal half of each hormone activates the receptor through contact points on the extracellular loops and juxtamembrane regions (9.Bergwitz C. Gardella T.J. Flannery M.R. Potts Jr., J.T.

Despite their equal ability to activate through the PTH1R, it was clear from the earliest work, even with antibodies against peptides within the first 14 residues of PTHrP, that highly specific antibodies could be generated that discriminate between PTH and PTHrP (10.Moseley J.M.
